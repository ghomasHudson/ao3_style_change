“We walked the dogs,” John explained, eyeing Greg’s new failed abomination. But wasn’t that the goal with these exhibits?
"You should've thought about that earlier," said a voice behind them. It was the Prefect.
“What are you doing here?” Sherlock hissed at his older brother, robes sweeping the cold December floor.
“Oh, did they?” McGonagall said, mildly amused. “I cannot say that I agree with their teaching techniques, but it does sound rather helpful. Now, let’s review our latest spell. Mr Selcout, if you please.”
“Nah, only saw you guys in movies.”
They looked at each other. As soon as their eyes met, they broke down laughing, for which they were scolded by the Professor - it also earned them quizzical looks from their classmates, but they didn't really care.
“So,” John said once he laid on his back, staring at the ceiling. He was aware of Sherlock’s eyes roaming all over him. “Bored yet?”
“Stop before I erase you from existence!” he shouted, rounding the corner as Cage threw himself in the direction of Sam’s room. He had no idea where he was, but he was buying himself time.
Sam and Dean exchanged a glance when he turned around, shrugging. “Yeah, kinda,” Dean answered awkwardly. He cleared his throat. “How long have you been doing these tours?”
Hi! Back with another chapter, alebit short. We went distance studying in Slovakia again, and it's a bit tougher than the first quarantine, but! I!! wrote!!! something!!!! anyway!!!!! Wheeeeee!!!!!!
Sherlock nodded, their hands lifting the sheet over the pile of sharp shards, shielding the being within. Why did Greg even own it? Where did he get these things, and how come he never noticed how weird that shit was? First the dolls, then this predatory mirror saying cryptic messages about doomsday….
He schooled his expression into a soft smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes and said, “Alright, but come to the attic. Irene and I have a girls’ night today.”
“I suggest you two go to bed,” he said, smiling warmly at the two of them as if this was a casual evening, no mentions of a possible want to murder the younger boy next to Blake. “Gryffindor and Slytherin are surely waiting to celebrate this with you, and I don’t want them to wait for an excuse to make a noise for much longer.”
“Well, you thought wrong. What’s it to you? You’re not my minder. I can deal with my problems myself.”
"Sherlock, it's not a good idea to play with this…. Whatever it is in the dungeons," John said, helping him stand. The echo of the wind sounded throughout the walls and corridors.
?!” Irene exclaimed, taking an automatic step back. Normandy was, in fact, a weird mechanical skeleton operated by tiny female-resembling creatures with butterfly-like wings and pink skin. There were three of them, dressed in green leaves tailored to their body type. One was operating the face (that one was sheepishly smiling at her with its tiny, pointy teeth), one was in charge of the skeleton’s arms and the last operated legs. It was almost comical, weren’t it for the fact that she was facing unknown supernatural creatures alone. Dammit. Why was Sherlock always right, even when they’re facing a new concept of magic and similar bullshit?
"It better be," murmured Ron and he got lightly slapped on the arm by Hermione.
“Nope. And the British Letters and the Grimms are of no help so far, but that’s to be expected. Irene’s dad is being careful -- we don’t want them mixed up in this and scout the town when it did no harm until now.”
She came to where John and the rest were standing, laughing giddily. She put a hand over Mrs Hudson’s, singing, “Something tells me your name’s Martha!” And she moved on, with another wink aimed at John. He shuddered when she turned her back to them.
As they retreated to their respective rooms, Sherlock heard Cas being called over by Sam. They had a private debriefing amongst themselves.
Hello, everyone! Last chapter of ep3 is here, ready to mingle.
I hope you're all doing okay, and that you're getting enough sleep!
The Doctor seemed mildly impressed by the Alex Hirsch story, though. “Alex? King Awesome-Sauce? I knew he must have ended up in that chocolate abomination. Did it preserve him for all those years?”
“I’m great, no worries,” John reassured her. She could really let go of him now. Instead, she kept watching him like a hawk, her smile big and frozen. He jerked his head at Irene and Sherlock behind them in hopes of diverting her attention. “Uhm, can I introduce you? That’s Irene and Sherlock, my friends. They came over for the summer.”
“Don’t lose hope. You might have a surprise growth spurt before you’re twenty-one.”
Sherlock pushed on John’s shoulders lightly, toppling them over, mouths on each other, John’s hands resting on his lower back. But as John’s own back hit the mattress, a startled squeak made them stop. Sherlock frowned, and John fished for the intruder: Archie the Unicorn.
“Nothing. I’ll just find a better opportunity to talk some sense into you, then.”
“Nothing, so let’s circle the cemetery and we’ll see.”
Sherlock virtuously ignored Mike’s hollow chuckle now that the situation lightened up with the idea and hope that he was going to solve this.
He sighed, withering about in his bed, facing away from the four-poster bed in which his (former?) best friend slept soundly. Weirdly enough, he felt comforted by the… Slytherin Champion, Blake? Selcout. But Harry couldn’t be sure he wasn’t with Malfoy, even though Angelina explained to him that he was a new student from Ilvermorny (strange to change schools in your last year, isn’t it?). He was well aware that the Slytherins wouldn’t let him live this down.
When he looked over his shoulder to make sure John was alright with him changing the topic so suddenly -- terpenes
He took out one, which left around six more inside, and he tucked it away. The biscuits were for special occasions, and he guessed that this was one of them. He had around three months of travel, so he could eat two per month. That was good enough reasoning and dividing.
Hi peeps! Here's a delivery of another chapter~ we're halfway through this episode!
Updated: 6.10. 2020
“Tedious. Say everything or nothing.”
The two didn't make it that far. As though she were a ghost, the Prefect girl appeared in front of them again, John dragging Sherlock to the side.
“No.”
“Nothin’,” Greg said, sounding exhausted all of a sudden. He looked at John and gave him a weak smile. “Sorry, it’s just too hot. Had to sit down. I realised I forgot to call Sally about the range this year.”
Receiving a text from John agreeing to meet him in the back, he stuffed the phone in his back pocket and aimed his way to the bathroom on the ground floor.
“It’s her style of clothing.”
“When are you going to talk to him?”
“No, but maybe some other time.”
“As you wish, your majesty. Oh, also: what happened to that bitch, Cas?”
“Choose whatever you want, of course,” the upkeeper told them, eagerly awaiting their responses. She and John exchanged a knowing smile. “The pie is only a suggestion.”
“A bit, yeah.”
for something I didn’t do!”
“I think she’s fine,” John said, shrugging. “Has a few loose marbles but I mean… Yeah, okay. I see your point. But I can’t  imagine anyone else teaching Divination, honestly. She just fits the subject.”
"Can’t imagine why," John snorted and Sherlock smirked, but he didn’t pry his eyes away from Fletcher. His clothes signalled that he was constantly changing locations, they were worn-out, he was materialistic and in debt with many people. Addicted to gambling, a pathological liar, but not a good one. Weak-willed, skittish, greedy, easy to intimidate.
in Sherlock and even his odd hobbies and obsessions with experiments, chemistry, and recently also theories about the mystery journal. John
Greg buried his face in his face. Even on his day off he couldn’t get rest. The worst thing was that they were probably right. He never was one for knowing what looked good on him and what did not (Mrs Hudson helped him a lot nowadays, honestly - plus he mostly played it cool with shirts and trousers, that worked marvels), but he still thought his hair as it was now was fine. Hm. He’ll consider it. But he won’t tell them they had already partially won. They probably knew in spite of his protest.
There. He said the word. He had to take a risk.
The taller ghoul looked up, eyes glassy. It had skin missing here and there, and it was mostly wrinkly and tough. It was hard to tell their sex, because with time, all the obvious signs to tell males and females apart just rotted away. This was caused by radiation -- but where they got in contact with it, no one knew, and the ghouls usually didn’t remember or didn’t disclose that information. However, they didn’t transmit the radiation, which was a relief.
“Nothing, that’s the problem. You had coloured ones too, where did you put them?”
This was dire. Sam didn’t like the sound of it. He had witnessed enough premises like this in his life to know that shit was about to hit the fan, as Dean would say. And if Cas had a headache, that could foretell another ‘seizure’ in the foreseeable future. They had to dig up more immediately.
“As you may remember, I mentioned that TARDIS has stopped here without our intention. She stops in Cardiff on occasion to recharge. Her energy’s been on the lower side recently, so I anticipated she’d take us there sooner or later. You see, there’s a Rift that cuts through the area, and that’s where TARDIS gets her power from when she needs it. I have a theory --”

Thank you all for reading and I wish you all a nice day/night wherever you are~
“Why do you women have the need to make me feel queasy about my hair? I’m not even forty yet!”
The former were currently seated in Irene and Sherlock’s attic room, analysing dirt samples from various areas across the forest. Irene heard Sherlock’s rapid monologue, categorising the variabilities and unique distinctive properties aloud to John. She was positive that he could battle Dave Strider and Eminem with how fast he talked. Hm. The potential was immense, who would win? Maybe the universe wouldn’t be able to handle those two arses in a face-off.
“Let’s see,” Kate’s nose wrinkled and she tucked her feet under her butt. “I may or may not sneak up here when my job gets boring… all day, every day.”
“I’m waiting for the results,” Sherlock said, eyes darting back to the ceiling. Was it delirium or was it melting? Slight dehydration probably. He also hadn’t slept for five days in a row, what with the unsubsiding hot air during nights and the experiments he ran. It was starting to wear off on him. His eyelids were heavier and heavier, until his consciousness slid from under him, somewhere far away and he drifted off.
“A little. I don’t need much sleep, you know that.”
She saw him out on the roof where she handed him the salami and bread, then the water bottle. They timed it perfectly. Five second later, Cas knocked on the door and walked in. He heeded Irene’s instructions and changed clothes.
“When Greg lost his fishing permit -- Jake took it because he was curious what it was. And while I tried to get at Jake for stealing my phone too, I told Greg to tell tourists that we’re de-ghostifying the porch. And he gave me the whole of it for rolling in dirt and dust for half the day.”
Will waved a hand in a ‘don’t worry about it’ motion. “Naw, chill. Besides, you said we should write you a list. Jake wants to write it himself, he won’t let me or Hulk or Poki do it. So you still have some time. It’s not like us dolls seek out comfort. For us, it’ll be more for the aesthetic.”
“Oh, this is finally going to be exciting!” Sherlock said once they were out of the dungeons. Snape gave them homework to research uses of Flobberworm Mucus until next week.
“You slept for seven hours,” Sherlock raised an eyebrow, but likewise settled himself next to John on his back. He cuddled closer, throwing his right leg oever John’s, whose arm wound around his torso and dragged him closer. Ah, that was better. Curious how fast he got used to this… domesticity, of sorts. It felt natural, safe. As if the last puzzle piece fell into place.
“Does it matter?” Sherlock said, kicking a cable out of the way. A rush of blood pinkened his cheekbones, he could feel it. That was embarrassing.
“Wait, really?” John looked from Sherlock to Irene. She was done with his right foot and moved onto his left. “Since when?”
“Right. Well, thanks. I’ll better go catch up with Sherlock.”
Professor Snape went over the names first, ticking off attendance swiftly and precisely. He slammed the registry shut with a thud and his dark eyes swept over the students before him. Similarly to Professor McGonagall, he had the gift to make everyone shut up and pay attention without even trying to - and this was just his third day teaching.
Take care and don't turn small,
When John looked up, his eyes widened, and the chair fell backwards as he hurried to snatch a lighter Irene held under the crumpled paper. “No! Wait!” He knocked the item out of her grasp with a swat, taking the document back from her.
“Mhm.”
“None of your business.”
John sucked in a breath. “A little. Just shocked mostly, I think. I guess we’re lucky this isn’t deadly or poisonous. What did you want to do with this?”
“Who is ‘L’?” John asked. “A co-author?”
“It’s nothing, just me overthinking,” he said, rubbing his temples.
Funny how he used the supernatural as his front to catch the attention of the feeble minds passing Reichenbach Falls. Mary knew what tours he gave, and what abominations he glued together from his dumpster diving and antique sales scavenges he then showed off to his customers in the gift shop. He had no idea what kind of
. There has to be something that can fix it in the journal.”
“Really? I never baked.”
Magnussen reached into a drawer to take out a bunch of files. He tossed two Seb’s way and he fanned through them. One file contained information about an old property on the edge of town, long abandoned, worn-out, and ruined from the lack of upkeep. Nothing spectacular, if they can track an owner it won’t be hard to buy them out, if not, then the access and acquisition will be even easier.
"Wait, really?" said Ron, awestruck that they were actually met with a positive response.
“He met John!”
“Yeah, gotta catch up.” A loud yawn. “Good night, Sherlock. I’ll see you in the morning.”
“I haven’t had the opportunity to discover any powers of my own,” Sherlock said. Dean sneezed loudly, and Gabriel lowered the volume, not saying the customary ‘bless you’ unlike Cas. “Which brings me to our next question: how come you’re able to use your powers to such an extent as this, but not Castiel?”
“Very true. I had a friend who liked to dress up as Halloween monsters every day of the year except for Halloween. Spooked everyone out when he showed up to school looking normal and casual. We thought aliens abducted him.”
John glanced at him but quickly returned his attention to the road. Sherlock mostly hummed as Irene spoke on the other side, and John rolled the windows in an effort to cool the interior of Greg’s car. Summer was far from his favourite season. He liked autumn and spring the most. Winter was fine as long as it wasn’t windy. But summer was on thin fucking ice, or would be, if it didn’t melt.
When Sherlock turned to grab the stroller and leave this hellish place on Earth, it wasn’t there. And neither was Rosie.
"Lestrade would let us know ahead of time," Sherlock said. He came closer to John, who also looked around, suspicious and on his toes.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock,” Irene told him, for all it was worth. He’s developed a bond with them too quickly. He claimed that he shielded himself from sentiment, but he fell harder and faster than most in reality.
Ten minutes later they were both unpacked, if by unpacked on Irene’s part means that her clothes covered half of the room like glitter. Jumpers, tank tops, shorts, jeans, dresses, and shoes of every colour covered the surface, and yet Irene did nothing to change it in spite of Sherlock scowling at her. Right now she was preoccupied with putting up posters from cheap teen magazines on her side of the attic roof which she found lying about God knows where.
“He’s a bit of a psycho, but anyway -- you said you ran away from squirrels?”
“Roger that! I’ll call her and we’ll brainstorm.”
TARDIS took them back to the past half-hour. The Doctor gave out instructions as they marched out to fulfill their goal to make Mike and Molly happy.
She was currently clutching a Barbie doll that Dean had bought her the day prior, yelling senselessly at her.
. Can’t believe I thought you’re younger. You’re really getting old.”
“What’s wrong?” Irene blurted out, horrified that they caused some uncanny time paradox. Donna seemed equally alarmed and the Doctor was frowning.
“What’s a variable?”
“Hello, mama,” Sherlock said lightly, but not loudly. Soft sounds are more pleasant. He made a few kissy noises, letting a bunch of fries on his thighs for the puppy to eat as he got another handful and offered it to the mother. “Want some? I have plenty. You don’t have to worry, I won’t hurt you or your baby.”
John opened the bathroom doors and peered out to see Sherlock sulkily leaning against the wall opposite. “Sorry,” John said, “forgot to mention Irene has new friends over.”
(See the end of the chapter for
His eyes drifted to John’s, whose mouth was slightly agape, but not in the horrified sense of the word. More amused and entertained than offended. He licked his lips, mouth opening and closing, no word leaving his throat. He blinked, bit his cheek, as if trying not to chuckle.
“Cas! You’re finally here!” Irene said, unceremoniously dropping on her knees in front of them, dripping wet. Sand stuck to her like glitter, except that this was easily washable, unlike the remaining red pieces in Sam’s hair he was finding to this day. “How was your short trip to the town?”
Updated: 15.10. 2020
Seb drove home. He lived in an apartment building in the centre of town, an affluent neighbourhood and a lot of innocent people around him. He liked his charades where he helped people out and the barbecues, they could basically vouch for him for anything if he asked nicely at this point.

Thank you all for reading and I wish you all a nice day/night wherever you are~
It was just after Halloween. Owls flew in and out, carrying the Daily Prophet to every soul they spotted - in other words, it was a mess. A cheerful one at that. The wizarding war Voldemort declared on the Ministry and muggles was over and trials of his followers were soon to begin. But most importantly, no one knew what exactly happened that killed Voldemort, just that there was a boy found in Godric’s Hollow. Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Orphaned, both parents dead. Betrayed by their maniacal best friend, Sirius Black, or so the papers wrote. People believed the Dark Lord was gone forever.
I reblog stuff here. (Did I do linking right?)
Sitting then and there, John nodded internally. Sherlock was still nearby; he didn’t shift or move away, though he did fix his gaze forward at the two women’s backs. He was worrying his lips absentmindedly, looking strangely vulnerable in the red and orange light.
The evening continued peacefully, John forgetting about Sherlock and Greg. In turn, they apparently forgot about him. It wasn’t until half past eleven that he and Carl were done with their homework and decided to pack it up and go sleep. In the bathroom John changed into his pyjamas, awfully exhausted. His hair was greasy, but it was quite short to be of any notice. He’ll wash it tomorrow.
I love Donna
on the 10th, I haven't reviewed this chapter and there was a section that still had to be written, so I got anxious and said nope
“Yes, that would make him the only one in his category,” grumbled Moody, his magical eye spinning up and down, looking Blake over curiously. “Good thinking, Selcout.”
“He raised an Acromantula under his bed,” Sherlock said. John lifted an eyebrow.
A snort escaped John’s nose forcefully, and he upturned his face to avoid Irene’s death glare.
“Both, I guess,” Greg shrugged, taking a seat next to Kate. Mrs Hudson smiled at them over the rim of her cup. Then Greg caught a glance of something better. “Is that lip gloss?”
“It won’t work,” the Doctor told them airily, crossing his arms.
My humble tumbrl:
“I can imagine. Does Greg plan to sell it?”
"I only stated that if he wants to cheat on his girlfriend, he should do it with a person that doesn't cheat with her at him at the same time," Sherlock said, voice flat. Professor Slughorn wrote instructions on the board to turn to page twenty-eight in their books to start working on their first potion.
“Absolutely. How else am I supposed to collect blackmail material? You should’ve seen Dimmock when he got out of the pool. I also got a shot of him jumping in the pool and his face is priceless.”
“I could give you pirate names,” Sherlock mused out loud. He looked the mother over, and searched his mind for any female pirates he may remember. “Maybe Grace O’Malley? Shortened to Grace, of course. That’s more practical. Do you like Grace?”
“Blueberry jam!” John said enthusiastically, his eyes brightening up. “We forgot that the last time, so that. Please. Also cookies-flavoured ice-cream. And pistachio. And Angelo’s lasagna. And also toast and milk, we’re out of those, but I put it on your shopping list. Oooh! And don’t forget cini-minis or some other cereals, but not cornflakes. And --”
here's a gif of Cas awkwardly hugging Sam that I foudn that's thematic, although Sam isnt' in the Falls yet
But Greg couldn’t unload fifteen years of planning upon his dearest guy in the world just like that, could he? Of course not. He shouldered it all throughout both their external hardship, he can do so for a few more weeks. He hated that he worried John like this, but occasionally… well. It was hard to snap out of his misery when he had a moment of vulnerability.
“This is our Sorting Hat,” Dumbledore explained, taking it and stepping aside to a chair that sat near the entrance door. He motioned Blake to take a seat. “Professor McGonagall usually has the honour of putting the Hat on, but she is rather busy with her pupils at the present moment.”
“Don’t you
music. So essentially, he put on the cassettes and led them to the world of Queen and David Bowie.
“I am. And House Elves confirmed it for me, so no more evidence is needed. You should probably go inside.”

"Wow," Harry breathed. "You’re one of the few people to actually say his name without flinching."
episode 6, chapter 1
“What about chihuahuas?” Sherlock smirked, and the three of them walked to the cashier’s.
“Oh, please! Pretty please, Greg,” she begged, pouting and putting on her best puppy-eyed stare, hands clasped together in a prayer gesture.
“I said shoo, you foul junkie!” Greg shouted again, swatting the deer on its left hind leg. And finally, the deer left, letting out a disappointed grunt as the forest flora embalmed it.
“I always get you the best presents.”
“No, he’s legit,” Sherlock said, watching Castiel up and down. “How did you end up in the closet? You were sitting on the bed!”
“I figured. When are we going? The session starts at four.”
When the Shack was acceptably presentable to Greg, he declared the day over and let everyone breathe. He didn’t stop nagging them about some things he thought they could’ve done better, but he didn’t push it. He clearly sensed that even Mrs Hudson was getting irritated.
<3 I hope you're all doing good!
. He’d almost forget what with the Mycroft fiasco and late-night studying for the year’s last essays and tests. That cheered Sherlock up a little - he’d sniff out every viable book on the subject in their family library at home, mark his words.
“‘Kay, Bumble.”
“I’m  here because of John.”
The evening weather was warm and slow, unlike Greg’s car that swished through the mostly abandoned streets like greased lightning. The radio blasted ‘
“I would never let that happen, and I never will,” John said adamantly, holding Sherlock’s gaze and hoping to communicate how much he meant it. And there it was again, that feeling of closeness and slight deja vu that he experienced before. The familiarity of this situation, as if they’d had this conversation before. If only John could close the distance and kiss Sherlock….
“What if we became one illegally?”
For a bit, Sherlock thought all his protective walls and restraint he placed upon himself would crumble -- and he would not mind it. No, he certainly would not, if they were to close the space between….
“Yes, we did that as warmups with our models before every fashion show, it helps ease the anxiety.”
“Satisfied?” John asked, smiling at Sherlock. In the shadow John’s silhouette threw at him his eyes were marine blue and seaweed green.
“It won’t until I get there,” Kate said, locking her phone. “Why?”
“I made it up.”
“I’m sorry about that. So your mom probably had people search for Mycroft, right?”
“Why not? I also don’t pay. Comes in handy, at least I’ll know when to withdraw my savings and flee to Chile to tend to Alpacas and breed cats,” the postman said mildly, shrugging.
Blake heard Snape snort in disbelief somewhere in the shadows.
Sherlock’s cheeks grew redder the more put on the spot he was. Kate listed all her own stuffed animals and their names in hopes to make him feel more comfortable, but it only served to rile him up further. Irene found it hilarious. “I know it’s fine to have stuffed animals!” he snapped, exhaling sharply as John put an arm around his waist.
when the stress levels were higher than the Shack’s profits. That used to be rare. But then, one summer, Greg smoked every day, and it stayed since. John had no proper recollection of his time here from then, he was eight, coming up on nine years old. But he had a memory of his grunkle slouching on the porch in the evenings when he thought John was prancing about. Yes, that memory was very vivid.
. Sherlock seemed to find John’s giggles infectious in turn, and they were stuck in a circle of endless laughter for a few minutes. Then Sherlock tried to tip them over with John weakened by the fits of giggles.

“And you won’t dare anger me, either,” Cage said, and Sherlock could have sworn his immovable features darkened. “Now that you know our secret, you must

“I suppose so. Don’t get excited, though. He’ll be back.”
“I agree that we should postpone this,” John said. He bit on his fist to stifle a yawn. “Irene’s got the pictures for you, Sherlock. That’s some data to work with. The rest can wait. It’s not like OG will rot and start smelling.”
“I have to get at you, someday. But first I’ll have to figure out what makes
A strategy that Cas thought of was to pin him to the ground and either let a rogue lightning bolt electrocute him or just vaporise him into thin air. Perhaps both. One thing he was sure about was that Nicolas Cage impostors were a tedious nuisance to deal with.
His reflection barked out a laugh, so not him, shifting its imaginary weight to his left (right?) leg. “I don’t exactly flail my secrets around. I only reveal myself to those in need.”
When she looked up to meet Mrs Hudson’s eyes, she found something akin to sadness in her gaze, a tiny lopsided smile on her thin, dry lips. “Of course there is chemistry between them,” Mrs Hudson cleared her throat, looking away. Irene thought for a moment she saw the woman’s eyes glass over, but she was probably overthinking this.
“Hm, I suppose you do have a point,” Sherlock said, weighing the options. He rubbed his chin, fixing his silver gaze on John. “Yes, it would be nice to have this secluded spot as this cultivation point for the species. John, you’re brilliant! A conductor of light, even, just like the flower.”
“Be right back, guys. Keep an eye on him, Greg.” His friend nodded and patted Sherlock on the shoulder, prompting him back into the compartment.
“He thinks I trust him that Potter is our little innocent, unfortunate soul,” Draco laughed. “Pansy told you what I plan to do?”
Irene forced herself not to smile, grin, or do anything incriminating with her mouth or facial expression that would let Sherlock sniff this out. She pretended to be on her own phone under the table and put John’s on the leathered cushion face-down. The smile he gave Angelo when he brought him his food could be described as satisfied. And that wasn’t only due to the mouth-watering pancakes.
“You look horrible,” John said flatly. Irene hopped off the table to come take a proper look at him. The dogs were under it, trying to ignore the still raging storm outside. “And you’re dripping all over the floor.”
“Sure. Uhm,” John said, looking at Sherlock pointedly. He currently kept his gaze fixed on John, hands behind his back, back straight. He didn’t get the memo. “Can you… Turn around?”
Irene smiled. “Yeah, I think so. Ripping off tourists like a pro.”
“And get a hunch as a result?” Sherlock arched a sardonic eyebrow, straightening himself on the chair automatically. “No, thank you. I need to have my back straight as a rod if I want to loom over people in the future.” He frowned at John’s snort. “What?”
The Professors set out to walk again, passing by Sherlock and John, who were thankfully unnoticed. John thought they even became statues for a minute for real.
“That’s a deal, then. But wait, why did you take me here in the first place? Why reveal yourself to me?”
Unbeknownst to him, Sherlock reached into his trouser pockets and retrieved John’s phone. He didn’t care about that much, but it surprised him.
“Irene’s obvious awesomeness aside,” John cleared his throat diplomatically, “how do you go about finding a person you’ve likely never met before?”
“Knight, probably. I’m too poor to be a King.”
“How did that happen?” Sam asked, jutting his chin at Dean in search of an answer.
“I was there when the first page was published. Or around that period. I never got around to finishing it, though.”
Every day, his second pair of watches ticked and tocked the countdown until the end of October, a maddening rhythm setting off alarms in Greg. Fifteen years of work were coming to fruition, and he wasn’t sure whether to be relieved or even more anxious. Both, probably. He wasn’t terrified, at least not in the current moment, but who knows?
Cage raised his arms in the air. “Finally, a worthy opponent!
“I know you do.”
“You said he would fall in love with me if I used the necklace!” Mary accused, her fury increasing. The necklace glowed yellow.
“Hi! I’ve heard
He fumbled around in his chair, rousing himself to a sitting position. His back hurt a bit, strained from the pose he half-lied in. He gripped the walkie-talkie harder, knuckles paling with strain. He wanted to hold onto this only channel of communication he had for as long as he could, but if he doesn’t leave now, it will be marginally more difficult to sneak out once the household wakes up.
“Mmm, yeah. It makes no sense, so let’s just ignore me. I do that sometimes. How do we try this out?” John looked around, setting his backpack on the ground, resting the journal on top of it.
There were no transmissions in the past week, but he was able to track the dimensional movement of his dear Captain, and it went without fuss. Good to see that. There have been times where he got stuck in a dimension for months on end. Greg wished they could have clearer, two-way communication like they did at the beginning when his husband got dragged in-between universes fifteen years ago. They had a secret language and symbols they used to talk in when they were children, and it continued until they were adults and separated, too. But even that became nigh impossible to maintain. Their walkie-talkies had functioned for four years, and it was a tremendous relief as they tried to figure out their next course of action, but… Greg could only guess whether his messages were received. Their made-up language worked after the walkie-talkie attempts fucked up, but even that was harder to catch nowadays. No wonder he was greying before forty.
Once closed, Sherlock jumped up excitedly and grabbed John by the shoulders.
John squinted at him and jabbed a forefinger in his uncle’s shoulder. “Pretty well, excluding three minutes ago when you cockblocked me and Sherlock.”

“I just… forgot my underwear,” John said, gesturing at his drawers. He padded towards it, grabbed a fresh pair of briefs and sweatshorts, winked after overcoming his initial shock, and disappeared.
“Castiel who?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Sometimes I like to be the sole hypocrite but okay. Well, I also chose lavender shampoo because it’s tinted with purple. The colour, obviously. And… I dunno, I like purple. Always did, in fact. I never liked shampoos or body wash in other colours, namely because I got used to it as a child, too.”
“For what?”
, you negligent poultry!”
His grunkle shrugged as he rolled up the sleeves of his shirt. “It’s a remote spot. All kinds of odd people can hang out there. Just watch out in case they look at you weird. But it’s shining brightly today, so all of ‘em should be tucked away somewhere cool.”
“Are you sure?” John asked softly, knocking on the stone as well. No signs of it disappearing or changing into a fizzy, translucent spell. “The dungeons are pretty confusing to me.”
“Oh no,” Donna whispered.
“We’ll see. If I gamble, I could earn money on vacation as well.”
“Before we part ways,” Mary said, eyeing Moran standing in the doorway, “can you tell us something? Do you know of any other ghouls who are in need of help?”
To his surprise, he didn’t have to wait long. The door sprung open ever so slightly, a quiet murmur inviting him in. He slithered through the gap inside, taking his Cloak off immediately.
“Right. Cool, just… let me know. And no problem, the traffic was slow today.”
“That’s… good or bad?” Dean asked, gently prodding the territory. John stood up and went to feed Redbeard and Grace.
I reviewed this chapter, but a few slip-ups are possible. I am central European, not English, plus this isn't britpicked, I don't have a Brit of my own to watch out for the lingo :D if you see any mistakes, feel free to point them out!
a little bitch. We’re going to the nest tonight.”
"Who was he?" said Greg in disbelief.
They got to devising Marina’s escape plan, and on the beach, the engine of Chevy Impala ‘67 roared its arrival.
John clung to Sherlock, the wind getting stronger and stronger, his feet slipping. Their bodies were too small and thin to resist this, and they were both blown back to the start of the passage,landing on their butt's for soft landing. By some miracle they were unharmed.
This fic is divided into 3 seasons. Season 1 is currently being published, and has 100 chapters. Season 2 has roughly 110 chapters, and the third is around 90, give or take, that’s too far to be known for sure yet.
.” Irene giggled, as did Kate and Mrs Hudson. “Anyway, you unruly women, how much do you place on this bet?”
“Lovely,” Irene smacked her lips, scrunching up her nose as she looked at John’s hands. “What is that?”
Mirage glared at him, but there was nothing else to say. He fucked up, he was reaping what he sowed. Dipshit.
“Cas,” Dean interrupted, smirking, “you kinda did. Is he aware of this? You reading his entire mind?”
“Oh! Can I join? I haven’t had much time to see what he does, or explore the museum.”
“I will,” Sherlock returned the smile curtly. He stumbled into the kitchen. Plopping down onto a chair, he took out his phone and scrolled through his gallery. He’ll have to reevaluate what to do regarding John Watson. It was impossible to avoid him the whole summer. And… perhaps it won’t be as bad?
“Sorry, I’m fucking tired,” John mumbled into the crook of his neck. He rolled off so that he was wedged between the wall and Sherlock, who tried not to feel distracted by John lying there basically half naked.
“And Molly just… accepted? Just like that?”
“Alright. Go ask the boys if they want some too, will you?”
Mycroft and Sherlock often used to play pirates when the former visited the Adler-Holmes family at their estate in England during summers. Mycroft was elected as the Captain, while Sherlock referred to himself as his best First Mate. Irene chose the role of the Queen of England and sent them on adventures to hunt treasures and wicked creatures of the night. This roughly translated into sweets and chocolates that Mycroft had bought with him from Canada or America (treasure hunts); he used to travel a lot. Sherlock had given Mycroft the pirate name of Redbeard, because one summer he came home sporting a stubble, and him being ginger made their pirate cosplays double endearing.
John thought about it for a while. “Alright, but isn’t there a way the flower could, I dunno, take roots? That it would grow here every year permanently? I mean, it’s pretty, it would be a shame if you use up the only one around here and possibly never see another one again, no?”
“Sure, Mom, what else?” Dean rolled his eyes, turning his back to them. “Cas, you ready? Oh
At last they halted, lips still brushing lightly against the other’s. In the distance outside they could hear a low grumble of thunder approaching.
“Oh, Sherlock,” she tutted. “It’s alright, dear. It’s nothing in the grand scheme of things. I just feel sorry for the Other Greg. He didn’t get much of a chance to meet our idiot tourists, did he? We are all tired, we should get some rest and you may find more clues you overlooked in the morning. I overreacted myself.”
I hope you peeps are good~
“Guilt tripping me, John? I thought we were family!”
, so he wasn’t going to let this slide.
Mary’s scarf sprawled over the back of her seat, flouncing from side to side as the car bumped on the road into town. The tips of her fingers danced furiously over her phone’s keyboard as she tapped out a message to an unknown number. Ugh, Irene hated that clicking sound. Why can’t people turn it off?
“Grocery shopping? Is that what you lot do nowadays? Aren’t you bored?”
“I guess.”
“Hopefully. It could be an external, far more superior force meddling with our lives. Could be God, but then again, it’s not like he cares nowadays.”
“Yeah, and also the Netflix adaptations and medicine. ‘Back in my day I could binge three shows in a day! Now I can’t watch one episode without the need to pee constantly!’”
“Glad to see you have blackmail material on your brother,” John murmured, rubbing his cheek against the back of his hand. “Jesus. I mean, it’s their thing. But as a future doctor, I should be disapproving, don’t you think? At the same time, though, I don’t want to be a little bitch and be a dictator. I won’t tell Sherlock what he’s able to do and what he’s not. That’s not how a relationship works.”
First of all, I want to say a huge THANK YOU to all of you who read, kudoed, and commented on this fic, seriously y'all, it made my heart melt and my motivation skyrocketed :') and soon we will have 1K hits!! that's amazing!! Back in February I never would've thought I'd get near a thousand :') ily ♥ y'all float my boat~
He stopped at the attic door, hovering at the threshold. What Dean had said in the morning made him think of his actions. Irene didn’t explicitly say that she minded him quietly coming in, but what if she did? It was shortly after seven o’clock, he should knock first.
But then, out of the blue (or black in this case, it was after all underground) the light breeze changed into a string wind, blowing against the boys with immense strength.
. What is so complicated about buying groceries? You go in, find what you need, throw it in the cart, cash it, done. Happy ending. Fin. You go home.
“You would do that?” Marina squealed happily. “Thank you! I shall repay you by sending you letters in bottles and sea horses!”
“Aha,” Greg replied, full of concentration. Kate found it hilarious.
“Worse,” Sherlock said, but his voice was muffled, so the word came out as
John raised an eyebrow and dove into the fridge to retrieve a bottle of iced tea. He poured them each a glass and sipped on the amber liquid. “I’m not. Chill, Sherlock, I won’t bite your head off. It’s both our fault.”
"No? He says that if you joined him, he would provide you with anything you could ask for, especially the detective. If it were on me, I'd have you killed already, and believe me, I'm inching for it, but I've heard about you. Sherlock Holmes, a detective with extraordinary talent. The Dark Lord counted on this, so he is willing to give you a few days to think it through. He would like help solving a mystery or two, so he will be patient with you."
“How spicy?” Sherlock asked, the tip of his forefinger tracing printed letters laminated under a shiny layer of plastic.
"Everything fine?" John asked the scrunchy boy.
“I’m glad, my Mum loves him. And Queen. What do you think, Sherlock?”
“Neither is Sherlock,” Irene said, hoping to give the racoon reassurance.
“Whichever version you’ll give me,” Sherlock said, his hold tightening for a second. Redbeard yawned and curled up to Grace.
“So far it seems like Slytherin or Ravenclaw fit me quite well,” Blake whispered, aware that Dumbledore was still surveying him.
“Alright… Thank you.” Anthea responded with a half-hearted salutation and retreated back to the wardrobe again. Of course, logic dictated that change of clothes was in order, but Sherlock couldn’t help but frown at the idea that someone may see him in his less than usual grace. He’ll have to sneak it out. He had packed four pairs of sweatpants and had five more t-shirts apart from his pyjamas to change into. Jeans, trousers, and shirts with suit vests made up most of his wardrobe, but occasionally, he liked the comfort of cotton sweatpants when a lazy day begged to be had, which didn’t happen often but frequently enough to guarantee their use.
“Of course, John, I’m not an idiot.”
“It’s nothing, really,” Mrs Hudson said, folding her paper napkin over and over. “I… I’m not a schoolgirl anymore to be having a crush…”
“I do,” said Cas. “My amnesia allowed that particular memory.”
“Look, Irene,” John straightened in his chair, looking at the clock on his bedside table. “It’s half past midnight. I appreciate your concern, but I’d rather not talk about my rather obvious crush, as I just found out, this late. Or early. Whatever. I want to get Mary out of the way first.” He swallowed the hard lump in his throat. Thinking about what creeped on him today made his stomach cramp. Every instinct told him to run in the other direction, said direction being Sherlock. But he already confirmed, and he was no coward. He can survive an hour in his ex’s presence, just this once. Give her a clear message that no, thank you, but I’ve met a brilliant guy and I’m not interested in anything you have to offer -- please move on.
“How do you think someone made a vengeful spirit like that?” he asked rhetorically. They walked out and he took Irene’s hand again. She was singing
“Where you off to?” John said groggily. Sherlock’s heart swelled, and he leaned in to press a kiss to John’s temple, crossing his right leg over the left to shield his stupid, misbehaved crotch. He almost gave in to John’s tugs to get him to lie again, but he could really use that shower to wash off the sweat. “I want cuddles.”
“Alright, alright,” Irene interrupted before it got out of hand. “How about you and Will and the rest make a list? Hold on, you don’t have paper or pen…. Never mind that. I’ll get you some basic stuff and we will figure out from there what we can afford to get you, okay?”
“Yeah. I must admit that it’s easy to do this when he’s business focused. And if I get caught, I just say I used the restroom. Or that I needed to change my tampons, which scares him away.”
. I’m using that.”

Mrs Hudson’s forehead crinkled, and she shot Irene a confused look before her face smoothed out. She checked the contents of her purse, clearing her throat. “I suppose we should go, then. These people are crazy when it comes to entertainment. They’re like a stampede.”
Into battle!
The sleepover was a roaring success. They moved the afterparty to the attic room shortly after most of the town’s teenage population left for the O’Leary invitation. Molly and Violet were lovely companions, similarly crazy to Irene when Homestuck was mentioned. The three spent the night helping Kate tidy up -- which was not as hard as she had anticipated. However, the storm took them by surprise, and everyone who chose to stay hurried home. Eddie, Billy, and Mike went in Mike’s mom’s minivan and Kate got a ride from Mrs Hudson.
John answered by pursing his lips together, a tug at the corner of his mouth a sign of his knowing why Sherlock remained so composed. Apparently he also found Wilkes inane and birdbrained. John put his palms on top of the other, bending his knees slightly for Sherlock to use as leverage. Sherlock shook his head, telling him to go first.
And with that, he drove off, leaving Mary standing dumbfounded on the curb before she cussed off the next person walking by as she hurried to the car in which she and her friend arrived there. She was
“Excuse me, can I sit here? Other tables are packed,” she said in an English accent, but the three young adults barely noticed her. Irene mumbled something akin to ‘sure’ and the woman took her seat on the opposite bench, their back half turned to her.
“Don’t you remember what the book said about this town?” he hissed at her, wishing to intimidate her back somehow as much as she did him. She didn’t back off. “Trust no one!”
"What the hell was that?!" John asked after the initial shock wore off. He was immediately scolded by the librarian, so he had to conceal his confusion, perplexed. "How did you-"

Yes, your traits are very well balanced, but there's fire in you that outshines the other choices slightly. Truly, it's stronger than you let on or realise.
“Get a room, you two,” she said jokingly. They retreated back to the house, the structure offering a cool shield from the blazing sun.
“Nah, I’ll drive you,” John said, ruffling Sherlock’s hair and kissing his cheek. He went to put on a grey t-shirt and changed his shorts, keeping up the conversation while oblivious to Sherlock’s thirsty stares. “I want to run into a few shops so I can give you a lift, buy what I need and then wait for you. They’re like an hour long, right? We could hang out after if you want. Have ice cream or something cold. I hate this hot weather.”
The muffled cry of Molly being hit square in the eye reached her ears. She and Donna winced. “It is done.”
Cas appeared thoughtful, feet shifting on the carpet. “How do you choose a stuffed animal?”
“Took you long enough,” Greg’s voice cut in through the kissing session. Granted, they did just barge into the house like a pair of cannonballs, but dammit! Couldn’t he just skiddaddle out of there silently?
“I’ll eat whatever you put in front of me,” Irene said, rubbing her belly for emphasis. John held the door open for them, letting them close on their own when everyone got inside.
“Well, I don’t see vampires,” Mike chuckled with forced airiness, trying to lighten up the mood. Sherlock tuned out the others who began to fight over who was going in next. Pity they ignored his literary rant. Stoker’s Dracula belonged among few of the classical books Sherlock bothered to read as an adolescent. Though that was due to the fact that his older brother liked the story.
“So I’ve heard,” Mary sighed, tossing the magazine aside. She cast her a forced smile. “Get to the point. Show’s starting in ten minutes.”
John's expression, if it were visible, would be horrified. His head said 'run', but his instinct held him there right next to Sherlock.
“You didn’t do exactly well with seducing your Golden Boy using the necklace, did you?” he teased. Mary grit her teeth. “Speaking of which, any theory why that didn’t work out, Miss Morstan?”
“We should hurry up before they catch onto us,” Irene said, breathing heavily, her perfect hair a mess now. She kept checking their backs for any signs of the creatures.
Sam and Dean regarded him with a careful look.
Mike chuckled, a bitter sound to Irene’s ears. Sherlock started speaking in his puppy voice to Redbeard. “Let’s say an old friend showed up. And he asked Molly out.”
“I’ll stare you down.”
“You don’t want to stay for that? I can drop off the dogs alone and come ‘round in like thirty minutes.”
“What would be illogical?” John asked, tapping into the room with a fresh batch of popcorn, still steaming from the microwave blasting.
John parked Greg’s car along the sidewalk, just about fifty meters away from the restaurant. He borrowed it under the pretense of going to visit Mike Stamford, a local boy he befriended a couple years ago. Greg didn’t know John and Mary had dated. John never got around to casually mentioning it since they got together at the end of summer before he left for uni that year, and it was mostly long-distance. They broke up a few months later either way, there was no reason mentioning it to Greg.
“Yes?”
He saluted to his reflection, letting out a shaky sigh as he put on his mask of indifference.
Hello, people, unfortunately no bonus chapter because I barely delivered this one. I'm changing seminars to bio and chem, so I gotta study. Plus, I am pre-writing another fanfiction series that will start being published in September, promo will be published on my two tumblrs in August! My bff Bee even did fanart, but you'll have to wait a bit until we do the character calls, twelve more days from now! I am pretty excite about it y'all :) drop by when you have time to spare?
Greg took a deep breath. He’d worked himself up in the car, but now that it was pointed out he listened and clapped his mouth shut. “Fine. Whatever. You kids go prance around or something, meet me here in thirty minutes. But if you come back and act and talk like the idiots around us, you’re dead to me.”
Once he was done, he closed off the taps and stepped on a mat at the border of the shower corner, reaching for a towel. John made a quick work of drying himself, suddenly realising that he forgot to grab a fresh pair of boxer briefs. And he sure as fuck won’t put the pair he slept in back on. Eh, fuck it.
“To do a good deed?” John offered. Cas tilted his head.
“Because we can’t risk an item suddenly going berserk on us, Sherlock,” John told him, nudging his ankle under the table. Sherlock’s shoulders sagged and he made puppy eyes at him.
“I thought Mrs Hudson bought it for herself?” John said, perplexed, but he opened his container nevertheless.
“Dear John Eckbert… how is this possible?” Irene gestured at the lot of them. Her eyebrows reamined up, brown eyes tired and confused. “Is this magic? How was this not in the journal?”
“Sure. Anyway, time to sleep. Gerta will keep you company.”
,” Cage warned. John, uncharacteristically, didn’t listen.
So yes, Irene will have to disappoint and break lots of hearts this summer. Horrible, she knew, but even the best in this field needed a gap year (okay, not a year - but a few months to gather her thoughts, perhaps?) and there wasn’t a better opportunity than precisely right now. And besides…. Was it even worth it? She did date a lot of people, and there was nothing wrong with that. But thinking back, it wasn’t fulfilling, was it? She met a lot of interesting people along the way, but she never felt anything stronger for any of her dates. Not even for Normandy, though they did step onto the ‘girlfriend’ territory quite quickly.
“And? Doesn’t make me obliged to -- oh, right. Fine.” Irene snorted as she passed them and walked Cas out of their way. Sherlock’s hatred for household chores was obvious and strong like Mr Ripper’s tiger eye resistance, but his desire to snog the hell out of John? Stronger than Wakanda’s vibranium. And John’s plan had finally dawned on him. Sweet summer child.

of theirs gives us to sleep in. And I’ll sulk there for the rest of summer if I can.”
Mrs Hudson stopped and her hand shot up to her necklace. “You’re right! We shouldn’t lose more time. Goodness, John, why didn’t you say something sooner? Wasting time like this, tsk.”
Personally, I have nothing against it (yet) because I haven't eaten it though the idea is.... odd. I may give it a try. For the time being, we have John who hates it, Sherlock who is 50/50, and Greg who loves it. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be~ Do you like pineapple on your pizza?
“I had my subordinates like Uriel to report to me, if necessary,” Cas explained, coming to sit next to him on the bed. “And… I don’t know. My higher-ups, as you’d call them, never expressed their need for me to be present on Earth. That is, until Azazel and then Lilith became a problem and you needed to be resurrected. I was always supposed to go over battle tactics and oversee other angels practising their combatting techniques. I do know a fair amount of human history from our records. I did like reading about it in Enochian. I miss our library, though I’ve never spent time in a human library, so that could be refreshing.”
Thank you all for reading, and I wish you all a happy day/night wherever you are~

“Not just a captain of, like, an army, but in general. However I felt that day, I devised a scenario and acted it out with myself. I was shy so I didn’t play these with other kids. But when I was alone, I used to go into our garden or the forest nearby and spend hours there just roaming the space and coming up with ideas and stories that I daydreamed of. I didn’t mind playing the captain of a fictional human army, but I was really into
“You’re still fired up about that? Why?”
Janine gave her a funny look. “Jeez, you’re weirder than you look. No sense for fashion or style.”
I hope you all are doing fine and you're staying healthy <3
“Not really. You really didn’t have to slap me, though.”
“Who?”
When he turned around, he was momentarily stunned to see Sherlock had arranged five slices of pizza, each of different kind, and he loomed above it, silver eyes skimming over them as if they were an interesting species of salamander’s tongue.
They ate in silence, both their bellies starving and devouring their bites in quick succession. Before Sherlock caught up to it, his sandwiches were gone, and his hunger sated. God bless John and his simple yet delicious culinary prowess.
Sherlock shook with laughter. “You’re awful. But yes, I suppose they do. Let’s stop the unwanted innuendos.”
“You might ask him on Friday. Also, Sam wants to switch babysitting duties. He says you’re due.”
“About what?” Dean chirped, placing a blanket around her shoulders. She snuggled into it, her nose buried under the rim of it.

people.”
for two whole days?”
The outer circle was the thinnest, just a silver lining. The second circle inside of the protection of the silver lining was the largest and divided into six sections, each for one colour of the rainbow. Each colour also bore a symbol. The third inner circle was thinner, the sections shifted so that they lay between two primary colours, mixing them into a shared colour. And covered in squares of black and white, a triangular shape from the innermost circle stared curiously at Castiel. The triangle had an oval horizontal eye in whose centre was an upright standing number eight -- or was it the flipped infinity symbol?
Carl also turned up at the feast. As Greg had assumed, he was around Jim Moriarty, who sulked as hard as ever and kept quiet during the dinner. From what John gathered, Carl had a nice holiday. His family was from Ireland, and he travelled to Wales to see his mom's second cousins he'd never met before, but they were nice people and he enjoyed his stay.
“It’s the principle of the thing, John!” Irene glared. “Do you know how you ignore certain things and then you notice them and suddenly you can’t
“Oops,” John said, biting on the inside of his cheek, eyes serious and daring. His height couldn’t compare with how high his courage levels were. “Sorry mate. Didn’t see you there. Gotta go have dinner.”
to be John’s girlfriend! She’s not even his type!”
The elf under him shrunk in size, it seemed. All from the sheer ominous presence Sherlock emitted like the sun and consumed all the available air akin to a blackhole. His nerves were fried, and he was at his wit’s end. If Sherlock doesn’t bully the elf to tell him where Rosie is right
Take care,
“Believe me, so did I. But enough of our shared trauma for today. Care for a brownie, dear?”
The Doctor leaned his hip on the yellowish console panel. His short brown hair was ruffled and stuck up at odd angles as he ran a hand through it. “TARDIS doesn’t let herself be handled until her energy restores,” he explained. “It’s like filling up your car’s tank, in a way. She feeds off the Rift. Timey wimey stuff and all that. But the Rift here in Reichenbach Falls makes her more pliant. I think she sensed your call and distress over your friend’s situation and decided to help you. Something about this town makes it possible for TARDIS to create a loop and rewind in the smallest amounts.”
He moved for the door, but stopped midway to glance at Sherlock who turned his back on him while listing through a book about potions.
“As we were falling, Irene napped and Dean and I were talking. For the majority of the time nothing happened. It was boring, to be honest. It was pitch black, but I used my grace to keep ambient light near us so that we could see one another.”
“Over a week,” she said. She lay on her bed, Cas mirroring her and taking a seat on Sherlock’s. Irene pouted thoughtfully. “But it feels longer. They’ve had that connection since they met in July. Sometimes it seems like they’ve known each other for years instead of almost two weeks. They fit together like two peas in a pod. It was clear as a blue sky to me since I’ve seen them in one room together.”
An adorable frown formed on Sherlock’s forehead. “I don’t remember that.”
of them.
“I did. I solved cases for the local police.”
“I could lie,” John suggested, shrugging. He dug his arm under Sherlock’s pillow, resting his head down next to his.
The teachers were out of the question; he had tried to persuade them to tell him more about the Chamber, but all had brushed him off, most of them with a scolding. Well, how else was he supposed to solve it, then? None of them appreciated his genius. Technically, he could ask Mycroft for the records, but that would be too easy and he had no desire to see his posh face or to hear his questions as to why he needed them.
Take care and don't get *short* with anyone :D
“Fine! I’m not!” John said, doing a mental checklist to see what could be done. Common knowledge told him that merfolk could survive on land, but their magic would be impacted negatively. However, their body temperature must be regulated, or they must be supplied with lots of clear water. That’s what he remembered from childhood and his schooling. “But if you paid more attention to them, you’d see that they’re clearly unwell.”
"Harry, is it?" she asked, her smile growing when he nodded. "Oh, I heard so much about you! Come with me, the boys stormed out some time ago but they will be back soon, I think."
“That’s a random question even for you.”
“No idea. I never cared to ask.”
John’s smile didn’t wither at all while listening to his friend speak. He grew more amused, intrigued. Maybe even proud, but the slyness of it stayed. His mouth twitched when Sherlock finished.
“Sherlock?” John said, perched on one knee besides him. He rested his warm hand on Sherlock’s shoulder blades. “This isn’t the best time to read, you know?”
The stranger’s face tilted to watch her, alarmed, and his posture straightened. “Me?”
Not long after ‘
John kissed the underside of Sherlock’s jaw, relishing the way his breath hitched. “And what were you and Irene up to besides making new friends?”
“Just a jumpy goat,” Dean said, shoving him towards his bedroom. Sam attempted to shove him into a wall but his smaller body wasn’t as strong as his older brother’s. “Piss off! I wanna sleep.”

. The broken, poorly-hidden expression on Sherlock’s face exterminated the relief that had momentarily sprung to life in John’s chest. Not even a week ago, in the safely unfamiliar space of a hospital room, Sherlock had clung to him, wrung out, seeking the comfort of John’s body just as much as John had wanted his; had offered, almost by accident, the three words no one on earth had ever been fortunate enough to hear from him (at least John suspected so; not like that). John refused to give them back.
. Ha! I said, I’d do whatever they asked me to with the goat if I could have a million quid!’ She cackled merrily. John tried to look amused. ‘But any of us who actually have any of the
John had no idea what he had done, and Sherlock felt a widening terror in his chest that he was, inevitably, going to find out. Because Sherlock had spent two days in Bergen unable to stop thinking about the flatness of John’s top lip whenever he could not get good tea (which Bergen, for all its covert merits, did not offer), and Sherlock could not control either his feelings or himself. Sherlock had shouted at old ladies and small children; he wondered, in the small hours of the night, precisely how long it would take to infect a population of 10,000 with

, who for all her innumerable strengths was quite obviously not a person with battle instincts, no sense (that is, nothing like Sherlock’s finely-crafted sense) of how to read situations and adjust accordingly, a matter of body language and contextual clues that John, with his intuitive perceptibility, could pick up and fit himself to in seconds.

‘God,’ John pushed the curls flat back (up/down) against the top of Sherlock’s forehead with a steady solid hand, ‘you’re such a bastard.’ His long nose slotted alongside Sherlock’s, hands sliding over Sherlock’s shirt down over his shoulderblades, his sensitive ribs, his hips, pressing Sherlock unimaginably closer, friction rocking them both like flint, sparking, urgent, sharp, ‘—fuck, c’mon, help me get these

Outside, he inhaled the first proper deep breath since entering his windowless cell of an exam office that morning. Rolling his neck and twisting his spine to crack from the long while at his desk, John smirked all over again at the burn in his sides, his legs, his own wrists…

‘I think it might be today,’ she said, in a voice he hadn’t heard yet. Solemn. Preparing him.
‘Shut
She knew me.’
Bold as brass, smirking as though he had not been minutes away from coming in his fussy special concert suit, Sherlock raised an imperious eyebrow. ‘I simply mean, it was a longer week for some of us than for others.’
Unable to keep his own hideous thoughts to himself tonight, Sherlock put his laptop aside and (gingerly) got to his feet. ‘John, you are addicted to a certain… lifestyle.’
John sighed. He supposed he ought to go home.
be married to him in three weeks’ time.’
‘If you’d rather I can go back up —’
It wasn’t, Sherlock was well aware. Unlike the recent spats they’d been having, this one felt suddenly charged with things Sherlock had been withholding — fears he had been successfully (up to now he’d thought so, anyway) deleting as soon as they came into his head since the first morning Sherlock had searched the kitchen shelf only to realise he no longer remembered whether the coffeepot had initially belonged to John or himself. Yet here they all were, tumbling out like spun blue and green marbles spilled across a floor…
"Obviously."
“Shit, sorry,” John said, carefully depositing Sherlock back on the succulent grass. His hands stayed around Sherlock’s waist, however, and Sherlock’s rested on John’s shoulders. Sherlock weighed less than he anticipated, but it didn’t take John by surprise. He was tall and skinny, all bones and clothes, really. But not only that, he could feel the muscles under his touches. Sherlock wasn’t weak, it was just a clever deception. Before they could lean in and kiss, the puppy whined, begging for their attention. “Are you going to introduce us?”
Carefully so as to not bump into the tennis ball, Sherlock circled around it. Papers upon papers from the newspapers that lied around the Shack idly in stacks now covered the attic’s floor, the beds, the nightstands… everything in sight had stale newspapers stuck on top of it. Not that Sherlock would mind a stain here and there, but John insisted they save themselves the pain of cleaning up later and brought up a large pile of the useless print.
Sherlock automatically rolled his eyes. "It's no good seeing you, is it?"
They were each other’s living musical.
“Step-sister.”
“Nothing is moving anywhere, Irene,” he said, irritated. She flipped another page and angled it to her lamp’s light to get a better look at the pages.
“I’ll die from how cute Red is,” John said, grunting as he flopped back on the blanket he and Sherlock brought along from the Shack. Yesterday they greeted new family members in the house, so naturally they had to take them on walks. Sherlock roused John at 4:30, unable to contain his giddiness and child-like need to see that they truly kept the dogs.
Also, my heart goes out to the SPN fans. I'm rewatching s1 right now, but for the sake of this fic as I planned before I'll stick with the first *4 or 5 seasons, then it's canon divergence. Plot reasons. My Destiel? Guys, they'll be on the gay frequency of my Johnlock. I know in episode 2 I mentioned an event from probably season 6-ish, but this is fanfiction, why give a damn about that now? Details :D I'll smooth things over (canon divergence yo), but more on that later!
But still, three more hours had passed and the Mystery Shack stayed silent. Greg also slept in, which was rare. He was usually the first person to be up and about, even before Mrs Hudson came in to work. Today’s morning, though, was slow as fuck. John got bored, but there was no way he was going to go and wake up Sherlock and Irene prematurely. He’d settled for doing a bit of stretching in his room, exercising a little, then taking a shower. But seeing as it had turned to only six in the morning, he wanted to bang his head on his door. Six hours awake and no signs of exhaustion that would make him sleepy. Great. He had journaled for a while until he heard the attic room door open, and the stairs creak under somebody’s feet. He’d shoved his journal behind his nightstand and got up. He had left his own door open and had his purple and yellow glass stained window opened to let some fresh air in. Not that he was ashamed of writing into a journal (or diary, whatever), but he’d rather no one else read it. For now. He used it to catalogue some of his worst childhood memories, which helped him distance himself from the events, and it could be depressive in some passages. And despite what Sherlock had said, well. John still felt like it would burden him too much. At this point in time, at least, and he didn’t plan on bringing this up so drastically early on in their relationship. But hey, if Sherlock desired it, he had the pass to ask Greg.
“Ah, sort of like a deja vu.”
“I guess I’ll have to have my fingers crossed to have a mermaid girlfriend,” she sighed dramatically and then blew on her nail polish to dry faster again, even shaking her hands to achieve the status of being able to touch stuff without the polish distorting. “I guess I should slow down on the dating front. It’s not like I had much luck in Toronto either. You know what? That’s exactly what I’m going to do. I think I’m way better at matchmaking others than myself. Yes, I’ll do that!”
"Then you would've logically gone outside, not into my room," Sherlock snapped and he sat down on his bed, arms crossed. "Why must you snoop in my things all the time?"
“You’re thinking too much,” Sherlock said, humoured by John’s lack of coordination and overly mechanical movements that were more rusty than fluent.
Eventually, the journal revealed, the author forced himself to overcome his fear of water, at least to a tolerable enough level and they set out to investigate the haunted island on the lake. The ghost was indeed as ancient as the town of Reichenbach Falls itself, and what was even more exciting was that she was able to talk under certain circumstances that weren’t purely related to her murdering her victims. The author’s notes read as such:
“It’s merch. It’s Karkat and Dave from a webcomic called Homestuck,” Irene replied dryly, crossing arms over her chest. She slapped Janine’s hand away when she attempted to grab at the material.
It all began when this summer, the Adler-Holmes parents decided to take a trip around the world. Not wanting their children to spend the holidays alone in London, they arranged with their old family friend for them to stay with him for the two months. Mummy Holmes was especially worried about her son, Sherlock, who had the tendency to lock himself away in his room to either sulk or experiment. Pfft, as if he needed any other interaction save for the family dinners and family time spent over tabletop games.
“We’ll marry when he comes back,” Gloria said icily, hands fidgeting. “He’ll marry me and we’ll live in peace in our cottage, alone and happy. Without you.”
“Should I make coffee?”
Sherlock shrugged. “You were in the bathroom. I hoped to tell you as soon as you got out but you’re sneaky.”
“Will we have to destroy the rings?” Sherlock whispered to Dean while James and Gloria stood up. He shrugged, opening his flask with holy water and sniffing it.
“I can assure that if that were the case, he'd have new ones already,” Mycroft said, amused. “But please, he's a Ravenclaw, not a savage to destroy books that contain knowledge. No, I want to ask you for a favour.”
“Is that all?” Sherlock asked monotonously, his blue and green eyes boring into the angel. Cas nodded weakly. “This is the first time you’ve been contacted, yes?”
John stood up abruptly, leaving a flabbergasted Irene behind as he hurried to the library entrance. Out on the front porch, he used his navigation skills and interspatial imagination to follow the marked trail. If he was correct, then they had to go to the local cemetery up the road, which wasn’t that far off. Couple hundred meters at most. Yes, that made sense.
“Oh. Are you sure? I could nick Greg’s wallet or blackmail him to give us the dough.”
“Dean, Cas!” Martha said, beaming at the two of them. Only then had Dean realised that he had been standing in the archway like an idiot, reminiscing. “Come in, I’ve got plenty of food done.”
Gloria’s form twitched. Her eyes darkened. “James trusted him and so did I, but neither of them came back. They argued before James was taken, but in the end it didn’t matter.”
Sherlock felt a pang of guilt and opened his mouth to say something, but John caught his eyes and giggled. “I’m just messing with you,” he said, waving his fingers about. “It didn’t hurt at all. Now. What were you thinking about? What do we do about the Chamber?”
“Nope, just busy,” John said, fistbumbping him. “Sorry, Greg needs help around the house constantly these days. I see you’ve met Irene, Billy.”

And hope they did. Afterwards, their conversation shifted to trivial matters, namely beauty drama and then regarding what they’d gift Greg for his upcoming birthday in September. There was a problem: nothing they brainstormed seemed to suit the title of being ‘perfect’ for John’s uncle.
“Your accent,” the girl said, looking at him, her lips upturned and face bright. “You’re the student from Ilvermorny, right? I like your English.”
He flicked a hand through his hair as he passed her, rolling up his sleeves while he walked to his car. His rage within was evident. Vivien attempted to talk to him, but Greg cussed her out in French and sped off, leaving a cloud of dust in his wake.
With a wave of her hand she disappeared into the corridor, her heels clicking against the wooden floor until she got on the carpet. Lestrade huffed a tired sigh. He made the wise decision not to question her further.
“Stop. Please don’t blame yourself on this. Sure, you could’ve labeled it or specified it, but we have three more people in the house and it can be a bit distracting. I said that it’s fine. As long as we don’t slip up and Greg doesn’t find out, we’re good. If it lasted more than three or four days, I’d probably be freaking out right now.”
“Oh, hi,” Blake said, lifting both eyebrows in surprise. He hasn’t had time to go find Harry on his own among his studying duties, but it seems like he manifested him. Harry hovered at the side of the table, one hand clutching the strap of his backpack. “Uhm, want to sit down? I actually wanted to talk to you.”
Sherlock sat up, hands on hips as he regarded John with an inscrutable expression of a very serious chemist who got interrupted conducting a Very Serious™ experiment. “John Watson,” Sherlock declared in his most British voice, “will you, oh my dearest of Canadians, allow me to conduct an experiment in sensuality on you?”
The past year and a half -- almost two -- were hellish. The Apocalypse had been aborted, but truth be told, the events of his confrontation of Michael and Lucifer were fuzzy. A lot has gone down since then, namely his search for Cas when he went missing. He and Sam worked with Bobby, Rufus, and a select few other hunters to sniff out leads. They even trapped demons to bully them into cooperation, but all of their attempts were unsuccessful. And Sam and Dean had gotten desperate.
John, like any non-masochistic, rational human being, became very protective of this weakness after discovering its existence. He tried not to be too obvious about how his heart raced when Sherlock put himself into danger, or how he watched his steps so closely, or how he would wake in terror at night and just stand outside Sherlock's bedroom door and listen to him breathe, just to make sure he was still there, alive, okay.
“You’re like me,” he looked at John questionably. “How long…?”
“You’ve had more than I have,” Sherlock grumbled.
"I'm your brother's boyfriend, and I'm tired of watching him go through hell, worried about his twin sister who won't pull her act together," Sherlock was too calm, gaze leveled on the lesser being.
"I'd be lost without my soldier," Sherlock said truthfully, but his voice was edged with humour.
"Double homicide...any ideas?" John asked, sounding genuinely interested.
“Oh, terribly easy- it was the gardener, obviously.”
“Forever,” John laughed. Lestrade cocked an eyebrow. “Oh, fine- years and years. I’ve known him nearly as long as we’ve been alive, and we’ve always got on.”
"Sherlock!" he snapped. "Leave her be!"
"I need to make a call."
“I flirt with you all the time,” Sherlock defended himself.
John worked on removing Sherlock’s shirt, and tossed it off the side of the bed, running his hands up and down his sides causing goosebumps to rise across Sherlock’s skin.
“What?”
“What?”
And he was hooked up to machines that made this very evident to
“Aww, don’t be upset,” John turned back to him, kissing Sherlock to distract him. He leaned over him, deepening the kiss when the doorbell rang through the flat.
“I know you didn’t know. I ensured you didn’t, because being a soldier makes you happy and I will not go out of my way to stop your happiness, despite how every one of his lot views me as a selfish bastard,” he pointed to Lestrade who looked very awkward. “And maybe I am, because your happiness is crucial to my own. That means that I will nurse your wounds and deal with the PTSD and let you go off to be shot at whenever you find yourself bored, but please don’t act like it’s easy for me. Because I barely sleep and barely eat and have to fill my time with ridiculous bloody puzzles so as to keep distracted, especially considering you are so against me inhaling a little nicotine.” Sherlock licked his lip, looking away to calm his emotions after his little rant.
“So Sherlock was telling me,” John said. “So sorry to hear about your husband, by the way.”
“Oh, when? Is it when I’m not there to hear it?” John asked.
John gasped. “Sher-Sherlock?”
"Sherlock, I don't want to talk about the skull!"
John watched Sherlock in the wheelchair, resisting the urge to chuckle at the position he was in. His long legs were bent up high into the air, leaning to the left so as to take the pressure off his right foot. He was pouting as his eyes scanned the sterile room with a few different brightly-colored fliers. There was nothing there to hold the genius' interest. He glowered and heaved a dramatic sigh as the Caribbean eyes focused back on his doctor friend.
“Oh, hello, John,” Lestrade smiled, taking in his appearance- no shirt, sex-crazed hair, flushed cheeks. “Bad time?”
"You want a dance so badly? Fine! But if I
Sherlock had wandered in, wrapped in the sheet they had used the night before. It looked and smelled quite obviously of sex, and it was not the impression John wanted to present so shortly after meeting someone.
“You should have observed. You should have inferred. How would you feel if I ran off into dangerous situations where it’s a guarantee the other people have guns and you weren’t allowed to follow?” Sherlock snapped. “How powerless and miserable would you be?”
“No,” he said, and he tried to hide his frustration at this fact.
“No more opium,” he promised.
He looked around, saw the nurse smile at him a moment.
“Believe it or not, I enjoy being with my husband,” John said stoically. He didn’t want to lose his temper again, so rather than stay and bicker, he followed Sherlock under the police tape to the body.
and thus we must deal with their presence during the holiday season. It was intolerable enough without this. If John hadn't brought up all the Christmases I was absent…" Sherlock rolled his eyes, looking vaguely regretful as he referred to the years post fake suicide. Mycroft didn't like pondering that time too much either; first, he thought he had lost his brother. When he found out he was wrong, and he had to assist him, he had to deal with lying to Greg, with whom he was just beginning a relationship with, and the guilt of knowing all of it was his fault to begin with, all stemming from a miscalculation with disastrous effects. Dealing with Greg after he found out about Mycroft's falsehood was enough to make his already cautious nature on higher alert. It was rare that the man was wrong. He didn't require a repeat performance.
“I’m required to see a therapist because of my medical discharge, and she’s been talking about my trust issues lately, and here I am spilling my guts to someone I barely know,” John chuckled. “Oh Ella will be so proud.”
"Your vocabulary diminishes severely when you get inebriated," Sherlock looked both entertained and exasperated.
“His name is Charles Augustus Magnussen.”
"John, this is Detective Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard, his Sergeant, Sally Donovan, and I frankly don't know the names of the rest of his team...except Anderson. But he has so few brain cells he doesn't count."
"We have yet to crack the Maxwell case, you have your time at the A&E to fill, you agreed to help me with the fluoride experiments, and you are now living with a patient! No free time."
"Do you have the number of the hospital he is staying in?" Sherlock asked. The soldier gave him a sheet of paper with the name of the hospital and the direct line to his room. He left after that, and Sherlock went over to Lestrade.
“Ahh but you were never seen with anyone. No one was ever at home. All communication could be linked back to your detective work….or your little science experiments. You were for all intents viewed as asexual, flirting only for cases,” she gave him a seductive look.
"I want to see you in uniform."
"Oh yes, the scarf; he does so enjoy a good cashmere accessory." They both let our small bits of laughter, looking away from each other so as to pretend they weren't having "a moment"; they would blame the bad alcohol later if it was brought up.
"So, Dr. Watson, do you get any free time when you're not being a hero?" she looked up at him with large green eyes.
“Mmmm,” Sherlock groaned. “That tickles.”
“What?” she asked.
Sherlock found John’s mouth in the dark. John gasped a little in surprise.
"Oh how beautiful that world would be, one where everyone would actually THINK!"
"I told you that and you got shot!"
"Ummm NO."
Sherlock took up became a Consulting Detective with New Scotland Yard while John was away. He had followed every development in forensic science throughout the years, making some improvements under aliases himself. It made him aggravated with men like Anderson who he doubted could tell his left from his right if put under any amount of pressure.
"I need to get back there!" Sherlock insisted, straining, looking over the men.
“I could understand. I’m actually here to apologize for Sally’s behaviour.” Lestrade cleared his throat.
"Good. Now." Mycroft cleared his throat as the song changed to something classical, a tune he knew. "May I have this dance?"
“Sherlock Holmes.”
“Yes, I’ll use one for the more disagreeable experiments,” Sherlock nodded.
“Um, hello,” John said, pressing his lips together to keep from upsetting Sherlock with his amusement. “I’m the husband.”
"Is it not customary to give your significant other a kiss before bed?"
"My phone is dead. May I use yours?"
“Actually, Mrs. Hudson, that’s what I needed to talk to you about,” Sherlock said. She looked up at him. “We’ve known each other for a few years, you and I. When we first met, you remember I said I had to get back to London because someone was waiting for me, yes?”
Sherlock whipped around, surprised to see Lestrade and a few other officers in a group.
Sherlock watched him for a moment before gripping his hand and letting John pull him to his feet.
"Well... what are we in for today?" she tried again. Still, she was met with silence.
"Sherlock," John warned. Sherlock gave a heaving sigh as he lifted his leg up.
"That that's not the case? I would have to agree," he mumbled. He cleared his throat. "Umm, Sherlock, how long have you wanted to do that?"
"You two are actually getting along," John giggled, having ingested more than his fair share of the wine. "I never thought I would see the day. Praise baby Jesus."
"It's Christmas. I was trying to be Christmas-y."
"Thanks, Greg," John tried to smile. "And thanks for the flowers, Donovan, Anderson."
The only thing that Sherlock noticed that was different was John visiting the taverns more often. One night, Sherlock had had enough and went to see him. He hadn’t been there long, still had his first mug of wine in front of him, so he was sober. He looked up, saw Sherlock, and took in his appearance. Sherlock was sober, had been for weeks, and John could tell. He motioned to the seat next to him, then ordered another drink from the bar. Sherlock sat down, feeling relieved.
John just gave Sherlock a fondly exasperated look.
“Oh shut up, you know I’m clever,” John threw his head back.
"What time will you be back?" he asked.
“I’m sorry,” John apologized.
"It's not funny," he snarled. "Why do we have to wait on a doctor here, when I have a live-in one at home?"
"Well we're not all Sherlock bloody Holmes, are we?"
"I can handle it. I won't take any drugs," the alien eyes were focused and his features were set, determined.
"She-"
The screaming echoed through the flat. Sherlock was in the kitchen working on an experiment related to decomposition rates when he heard the pained sounds coming from upstairs. He stood, thinking something was wrong before realizing what must be going on. Every time John returned from war, he dealt with the nightmares. Sometimes they lasted a week and made him yell orders, but those were the less violent ones. When he was injured, they became worse and lasted longer. Considering he had been shot after years of exposure, these were bound to be the bad kind. The screaming always disconcerted Sherlock, though.
"You're welcome," Anderson shrugged.
Sherlock looked over at him in shock. “Magnussen has people under his thumb, John. Isn’t it the right thing to do, to help?”
"We need to talk about this," Sherlock said.
John turned on the tall man behind him, kissing him thoroughly, just to show off for his audience, to stake his claim.
"John isn't gay," Anderson snorted. "Any reasonably intelligent person could see that."
Hours ticking by as they rehearsed the names, dates, practices, and any other relevant data pertaining to the seediest of just-barely-legitimate and some wholly underground art markets, dealers, exhibitions, trading hotspots, etc. Between them, Sherlock was genuinely relieved to find, John and Molly made a decent show of remembering the majority of the information Sherlock (and, admittedly, certain corners of the internet) had presented to them.
Breathless, breaking a kiss to take a shuddering gasp of air, Sherlock forced words through his vocal cords: ‘I don’t make you happy, I make you miserable, and I don’t know how –’
) had made their – her – appearance.
,’ Sherlock drawled disdainfully, with such a sneer in his voice that John couldn’t repress a wince. His good humour with this day – or whatever remained of it – evaporated.
‘I need to see Horner,’ Sherlock interrupted, setting off without them.
‘John, I have known many people in this world, but made few friends, and I can safely say you are the bravest, and kindest, and wisest human being I have ever known.’
‘Two.’
Chapter 4: Sherlock
He shut himself off, down down down
‘C’mon,’ murmured John, and retroactively Sherlock put two and two together: the pull of John’s hands (, the loss of his jacket,) and the shuffle of their footwork across the worn carpet over several previous minutes guiding him, dazed and drained, to the settee.
John charged towards him suddenly, crowding and stopping only a foot away, breathing hard.
‘Well, I’m not sure, but…’ She looked between them as though she was being quite reasonable and they were deliberately misunderstanding. ‘You know, the – the security services, or your… your brother, or… them! Whoever does…

She huffed, bright and bubbly performance faltering for the first time since she started down this path. ‘Johnny, if you utter one bloody word —’
‘Sorry!’ she blustered, ‘Was just going to wash my hands.’
‘I found him as I was on my way home last night,’ she told them, regarding the bird – an African Grey parrot (

’If it’ll help you take your meds,’ John replied flatly, in a lowered voice. Sherlock usually didn’t need it to take pills (a fact John refused to consider too closely until the case was over), but he hadn’t exactly been getting the doctor-recommended fluid intake today. ‘All the evening and dinner-time ones: actually. We have to keep on the schedule, like we discussed. And, as a matter of fact, you might as well go while the shower’s free —’
‘But look!’ Sgt. Challa called, panting and running into the room. ‘LOOK!’
Bradstreet looked commandingly at the accused, his solemn anticipation of the murder case giving way to his dogged adherence to procedure. ‘I think you’d better come upstairs to the interrogation room, sir, while we get this whole affair cleared up.’
John felt his laughter curdle in his throat. ‘It’s obvious, is it? Let me tell you, it
*Updates for the next two weeks will be suspended while the world, possibly, ends. Between Sunday's ep, next Friday's American end-of-days inauguration of evil, and my enormously important phd exam the Wednesday after that, I really cannot spend as much time as I love to do on getting the last few chapters into suitable shape for posting. But I swear, once we get past those few milestones, up the chapters shall go!*
With his customary stern frown of poorly masked excitement, Sherlock stood. The towel dripped a soft tattoo into the carpet at his feet.
Her reply was virtually instantaneous.
Mind Palace-John stalked the corridor with the air of a prowling lion. ’Let me tell you, the thrill I’d get out of breaking his arm? Not so fleeting.’
a dog? That seemed, though Sherlock had a hard time putting his finger on exactly which, to breech several social codes of friendly and gift-giving behaviour.
‘Your mattress is a plinth of stale bread, we are destroying it the moment we get home.’
But no, there was no forgiving grace in the chill of the evening air. His brother brought the two pieces to his eye and, just as Sherlock himself had done only minutes earlier, thumbed in the back of the slightly oversized red-and-black
. Afraid of losing this. Afraid of allowing himself to want it, to have it, real and forever. Sabotaging it, even, something Mike Stamford had once drunkenly accused John of doing himself, after yet another girlfriend had dumped him.
Eventually, vocal chords gummy with lachrymosal mucous, Sherlock pulled back and sniffed, ‘I hate this ridiculous bed.’
He thumped his crisp pillow.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘It certainly won’t get
His dark eyes alighted upon me at last, and I found there not so much accusation as… bewilderment.
Sherlock, as it happened, had continued to deny snoring ever since John had first woken to it, more than a month ago now. ‘Deny’ was probably too light a term: ‘outright denounce the possibility of, at an increasing volume’ probably hit closer to the mark. But years of playing the role of teasing annoying little brother were not wasted on John, nor was the time-honoured British pastime of taking the piss out of a fellow soldier. For a week, he’d hidden nose strips in Sherlock’s nightstand, mentioned in Mrs Hudson’s hearing that Sherlock might need an herbal soother for his post-nasal drip, even renamed Sherlock in his phone with the little yellow symbol of the nose. Sherlock’s face when John had begun typing a blog post describing Sherlock’s snores and snuffles in the moments before a bomb explosion at a stakeout (a true story) had been so hilariously furious that John had spent the rest of that afternoon forgetting and remembering it by turns with giggles under his breath. Sherlock had, naturally, retaliated with the entirely anticipated jibes about the size of John’s own nose — but of course he was about thirty years too late for that one to sting. Once again, John considered the fact that a peevish Sherlock resembled nothing so much as the disgruntled ravens at the Tower of London, or maybe the squawking parrot John had had to prevent Sherlock from keeping, because

As hungry (and hell, massively keyed up) as he’d come home feeling, he’d forced it aside. Got to his feet. Went through the steps, unsure if the curled up lump behind him was listening or, worse, not. Put his phone and wallet and watch on the dressing table — stacked, since there wasn’t room on this side, amidst Sherlock’s mysterious selection of knick-knacks and the very low lamp. Folded his trousers and shirt with the familiar motions of undressing with that air of privacy reserved for groups of people pretending they couldn’t see each other’s bits. Fortunately their washing was mixed (because John was the only one who bothered to do it, when Mrs. Hudson was too busy or too put-out), so he could at least avoid trespassing (
Standing on John’s threshold, holding his sandwich, he felt completely ridiculous. John had been swimming in endorphins (so was he), but surely he…
‘Fuck,’ John gasped, unable to contain himself. Sherlock had the nerve to chuckle shakily. John felt like he was boiling. He traced his fingers across Sherlock’s abdomen again for the sheer thrill of it. After several heated seconds he lifted his eyes to Sherlock’s. The sight of him, waiting and half-dressed and stunning in the reflection of the kitchen glow, flooded him with the desire to see him

and jumps of systole and diastole until they were burned into his retinas, the harsh light of the screen blaring plenty loud in the near-darkness. (Hospital rooms were never completely dark, of course. He was long since resigned to that.) He hadn’t wanted to look at his face, so he’d watched the monitor, only interrupted when various people came to check his vitals, all on schedule (it was a good hospital), and he was forced to stand up and move away and release his hand. Once they were gone, John smartened the terrible knit blanket (it was a good hospital, it wasn’t the Savoy) and stowed himself in the mass-produced faded blue leather-and-metal chair by the bed. If he spoke to anyone, he couldn’t remember having done it later.
‘It’s not like it is in the movies,’ says a familiar voice in his ear — all medical rationality, morbid knowledge — ‘there’s not a great big spurt of blood, no choking on your own bile.’
‘That’s not why I liked… Look, I admit that I — that sometimes I get tetchy and restless,
It was true and infuriatingly false — he hadn’t touch anything since his half-finished buttery toast this morning, the remembrance of which made him feel distinctly sick.

John’s exhale contained a laugh as he moved to sit in his armchair, and Sherlock’s mouth twitched in satisfaction. John was impressed. Excellent.
‘It’s not as though you take aeons to wash, John.’
‘Which is why I reminded her that I slept about half this much in Afghanistan and even less during my second year of med school. Not to mention during about half the cases.’ He shrugged. ‘Are you cold?’

Now, the staff at the hospital were professional, answering his questions but stopping short of friendly with him: a professional distance they had to maintain in case things went south. They didn’t ask him to leave, though, which John chalked up to the best the British government could do by way of apology.
I would like to thank anyone reading this on, well, reading this! Thank you for the kudos, comments, hits, everything! It all makes me fuzzy and happy inside, hehe, especially now that biology and chemistry seminars are stressing me tf out :D

, but the deadline was drawing closer. Much closer. Damnit, he lost so much time sleeping when he could’ve absorbed facts about what allergies the Southafrican Yellowtail had!
Lestrade was sitting cross-legged on the cashier counter, chatting amiably with whom Sherlock presumed to be the owner -- a tall, muscular man with thick glasses wearing a Big Bang Theory hoodie. He had his head shaven, probably as a result of genetic balding early on in his twenties. Instead of trying to maintain few patchy spots of hair, he embraced his new style and submitted to his genetic inheritance. A good move on his part.
’ with such a force that made him bend in the waist and knees. He ran the back of his hand under his itchy nose, eyes squeezed shut, grunting in exasperation. When he opened them, a frown creased his forehead. “What?”
As soon as he stepped out after parking on the curb he was greeted by three neighbours. He waved back, putting on his best smiles and attitude. God, how he hated them.
“Sherlock!” Irene shouted when she saw him from behind the swarm of the winged creatures. “Normandy was three pixies in a goth trench coat and they’re all little bitches!” She swatted another feral pixie in the face, destroying its perfectly applied makeup as Sherlock took out the mystery journal.
“Okay, Princess. Cas, how you doin’?”
“Yes, debatable, and yes. They’re conventionally hot, I’d say. Their sexual orientations, well, I do get vibes, but I don’t want to assume. With John I got confirmation right away because I pried, but in his case I just
“Mama Odie has been around since that year,” Lestrade explained, the handcuffs clanking as he tried to stretch his arms. He glared at the offensive metal, then shot a look to Donovan who feigned ignorance to his staring.
the one!”
“Good, I don’t care either. Oh! John, now that I have you here -- Kate and I have an idea.”
John obeyed, manhandling the struggling mirror Sherlock to his real one. It proved to be harder than he expected, and avoiding the kicks even more so, but once he finally managed to press the pale hand to its counterpart reflected in the silver surface, it stopped.
Sherlock craned his neck to have a look at the curious bird, arching an eyebrow. “Greetings. How are you?”
in which there is fluff
“Well,” the pixie fumbled with her thumbs. “Thing is, you shouldn’t have been able to find her. Irene is in no danger, you see. She’s only becoming our Mom and staying with us for all eternity. Right, Mom?”
Donna looked over her shoulder in a very conspiratorial way. She leaned on her elbows and over the table, Irene mirroring her. Donna seemed to be having a mild internal struggle. “It’s going to sound unbelievable…”
“Eh, he doesn’t need it tonight. He’s already snoring out on the back porch. God, what’s Irene gonna do?”
Harry chuckled at that, this being the second-or-so time Blake has seen him unwind a little. He’d ask how he felt, but if the answer wasn’t obvious by the way he announced the task and dragons, then Blake would’ve been blind and deaf. Goodness, he’s fourteen and has to face a beast this dangerous?
“John!” Sherlock from the mirror said, relief in his voice shattering John one piece at a time. What the hell happened here? “You’ve got to get me out of here!”
The bags under his eyes were witnesses to Blake’s workaholic diligence to get as much done as possible. But that proved to be rather difficult and he couldn’t get help from any teachers -- that was against the rules, despite Fleur and Krum apparently getting help from their headmasters. He can do better than that. He
“So? What about your end of the deal?” the ghoul said, shyly, wringing its calloused hands in a repetitive motion. The other ghoul paid them no attention, sighing somewhat resignedly.
“Uhm…. On a scale of one to mental asylum, how much will you believe me?” Irene asked, huffing a nervous laugh, tapping her foot against the dry ground. Jake withdrew his snout and angled his head to look at them.
“I know!” Mike said fervently, looking as upset at the memory as Irene felt. “She became a lot quieter after that experience. Now that she’s in college she’s finding it a lot easier to interact with our peers, thankfully. And she studies what she likes, so.”
“Okay. Don’t be long, love.”
“But what about Greg?” Irene asked, letting Grace sniff her leg. John’s uncle is very lenient when it comes to their quirks, but there is a line somewhere, however far in the distance.
John stopped, glancing at the pile of books they’d accumulated. He threw the backpack over his shoulder, taking the heaviest tomes into an awkward embrace. “I’ll make it quick,” he promised, telling Irene where to take the other books he couldn’t pick up. He ran up further into the library, trying to find a cart where he could deposit the historical books.
“Unfortunately for you,
“You?!” Incredulity evident in Irene’s voice, she took a further step to the back. They were caged in here, the literal Cage blocking their only way out. “But… We’ve burnt you!”
“Exactly. Now I’m not explicitly stating that we should definitely cosplay a pirate and a Stargate captain, but I’m heavily implying it.”
The torches lightning the passageway were put out by the wind, thin lines of smoke slithering upwards in the damp air.
“So you had sent Aurora to Mrs Hudson’s room to retrieve the knitting needles - but why? That’s very particular.”
at you, because no parent just lets their children be kidnapped. Hypothetically or not. Human beings are vile in general, and we’ve solved quite a few cases where you saw that oftentimes, the kidnapping happens out of the blue, and not many have a quick reaction to act on it. Besides, if I were to leave Rosie with you, you’d know. I’d make sure you

“We’re alright,” Will said, his voice indicating a hint of mirth. Irene knelt down as he walked closer, hands shoved in the pockets of his jeans. Pocahonthas was busying herself folding paper planes out of the scraps that were scattered on the ground. “Poki is becoming a star athlete, and Hulk got into the lore of the book you brought us.”
fucking
many memes out of this!”
He took it out and turned it in his hands, fingers brushing the tender and faded dyed leather. It was thick yet light, its aged pages yellow and brown. A silvery outline of an opened umbrella gilded the front. What caught Sherlock’s attention was the fact that he had seen a similar image elsewhere for sure, which struck him as odd, but he couldn’t put his finger on as to why. In the middle of the lining, there was an imprinted letter ‘M’ with the number three at its index. He flipped the book open (no signature) and read the introduction paragraph on the very first page.
John and Harry pushed past a family of three who were bidding goodbye to their other kid already seated in the train. Why not go a little to the side, then? The Watson siblings said goodbye five minutes ago to their father before sprinting all the way here. He couldn’t go with them, he had an important meeting in half an hour, plus the kids were already old enough to navigate themselves on the platform easily.
A FAMILY REUNION! can you smell the story behind it? Yep, Mrs Hudson is related to the Winchesters. More on that later.
“Thank you, you’re generous. I keep thinking of how wonderful the life of a child can be. Unfortunately that’s not the case for everyone, but mine was great until Mycroft’s disappearance. I had Irene at my age level, which wasn’t bad, but I looked up to Mycroft and wanted to go on real adventures with him. A child’s imagination is the most vivid thing in the world, aside from when you’re using drugs.”
“Simple -- I don’t think about it,” John replied, downing his glass and setting it on the tray. He patted Sherlock’s shoulder blades, nodding at the shelves. “Speaking of which, Mr Tall Guy, get these on the counter, please.”
Fingers intertwined, John nudged Sherlock to the left to avoid tripping over a twig. Sherlock had his nose buried in the journal that he held up to his face with his free left hand. John kept him steady and right so that he didn’t need to fuss over the logistics of the real world while he looked for an interesting phenomena to investigate. He mumbled affirmations or scoffed from time to time, and John enjoyed the peace and closeness between them, thumb brushing over Sherlock’s knuckles periodically.
“Because you’re putting your tiny neck on the line for a problem that doesn’t involve you, fluffy boy. Is there a chance for you to have backup? I’ll be worried if you go alone.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“So what ‘best part’ am I missing?”
“How many?” said Sherlock.
John crossed his arms and hummed. “How so?”
John leaned on his elbows, the wooden railing bearing the weight without complaint. The night air was chilly, but there was no relief to his lungs as there were still remains of the humid, hot weather from the last two weeks. However, he was pleased to see that wind was picking up, sneaking into the crowns of trees and shaking them up. The sky darkened further. A storm was coming at last.
also, I officially graduated high school on Friday! I can finally go study at a uni in September, and my future major gives me idea for another Sherlock AU, tbh,,,,,,
Sherlock didn’t look back, instead going straight in the attic. He very much tried not to imagine John changing his clothes to a more comfortable t-shirt and shorts. And he failed, which in turn made his cheeks heat up, and he had to burrow his face into his cooled off pillow. Lying face down, he tampered down any other thirsty thoughts his treacherous mind unexpectedly produced. He was in some deep, deep trouble. And it was getting uncontrollably out of hand.
“Can we call you Cas?” John asked.
“I’m curious what else that woman has up her sleeve,” he said, rubbing the back of his neck. Then he turned to the teens, shoulders slumping a bit. He didn’t get a pinch of sleep, the dark bags under his eyes told Sherlock as much. “Will you manage not to yell now? I was dozing in my office and then I hear Irene screaming her lungs out like we have a serial killer here with a chainsaw.”
“Remember the technique of the spell, this is usually asked about on N.E.W.T.s. I should hope that most of you already know this,” McGonagall said, throwing the Seventh Years a stern glance. “And don’t forget about proper pronunciation of an incantation as well as precision in your wand movements. Yes, I’m talking to you, Miss Lively.”
“How can you be so sure?”
“I’ll tell you at home,” John said into the fabric of Sherlock’s hoodie. His head tilted, and he nuzzled into Sherlock’s neck. They swayed backwards, and he had to do a weird tap dance to prevent them from falling over. “But we solved a case, if you can call it that.”
“No, I need to make a call first, sorry,” John said apologetically, stuffing his hands deep in his jean shorts pockets. Sherlock looked him over head to toe, raising an eyebrow quizzically. “I’ll join you in a bit, though. I’ll take Greg’s car.”
Sam jerked away in an instant. “Stop! It tickles.”
“Whoa, that escalated quickly,” Dean said from where he was peeking over the corner. Irene flipped him off as well, much to his scandal.
There is the sound of metal hitting concrete and we hear Dean curse [bleep it out, editor] and his steps hurry back to the house. Cas slides lower on the couch as if to hide. Maybe he thinks Dean turned into a T-Rex and if he doesn’t move, he won’t see him cowering under useless newsprint. Dean, unfortunately, is still a Winchester and a pain in the ass, so he just storms in, fuming, gripping the doorframe and stares at the bundle on the couch.
Sherlock watched him go, checking him out in the process shamelessly -- he
“The Absolutely Gorgeous Reichenbach Angel!” he said sweetly, and the music aided the effect using soft piano keys. “She’s the one who listens and helps you deal with your problems - and is also a psychic! Why waste your time with irrefutable conmen living in wacky Shacks? Agra is here! But you can call her Mary.
"That Ravenclaw weirdo too?"
“Mhm. Sneaking out from dormitories after curfew, too.”
The man turned on his heels, swinging his umbrella over one shoulder leisurely. John watched him go, undecided whether he was insulted or just annoyed. In the end he huffed a sigh himself, rolling his eyes and turning to walk back inside his house.
“She’s obviously a scam.”
Sherlock wouldn't let it on, but he was secretly very glad John took the offer. There was something about him that wasn't that annoying to Sherlock as it usually was the case with his peers. And most importantly, he wasn't outright angry when he blurted out a deduction or so, he thought it was brilliant. Sure, he heard people use it a lot so the word lost its meaning, but this was somehow different.
“Speak for yourself, old man. When did you get home?”

Giggles transformed into laughter, mud and water soaking into the floorboards below John. Sherlock was sprawled half on top of him, and when their eyes met, he dipped his head and kissed John again. Because he could.
“I’m so sorry,” Sherlock whispered, hugging John tighter around the waist. “It must’ve been horrible to find out when….”
A cold, wet nose tucking under Sherlock’s chin startled him out of his thoughts.
“It’s
“What’s up?” Irene asked, her face innocently blank.
“Alright, I’ll meet you then!” Irene agreed and rushed upstairs. The guys were out for who knows how long, she may as well use it to her advantage and go see Jake. She changed outfits for more comfortable shorts and a slightly oversized t-shirt that once belonged to her dad. It had a tour of The Beatles printed on the back, the font faded due to frequent washing and years of use.
Thank you all for reading/ visiting, and have a nice day/ night!
He carefully slid behind the vending machine and spent the next two hours in the basement. Alone. Downstairs in the chilled caved-in air, he plopped down heavily on a spinning chair whose wheels were sawn off ages ago.
“Let’s hope not. But I have a last question before we return to my bakery,” Gabriel said, turning to John. “Does Greg know about Castiel?”
The Potions class was a bit boring to John in his First Year. This year, however, things were going to change. For worse or the better, he didn’t know yet.
It’s been too long since he’s flown.
There were equations scattered around the pages, the handwriting hardly legible in some parts. There wasn’t much to tell him, truth be told. Half the text was coded in one way or another. Perhaps this is what the cryptic message in the third-quarter of the journal is about? As far as Sherlock observed, there were no keys to decode the ciphers in the journal. Smart, whoever compiled this was definitely smart enough.
Thank you, Sue~
“That’s fucking bizarre,” Irene concluded and Sherlock had to agree.
Well. Why let it bother him now? Sherlock, Greg, Irene, Mrs Hudson -- they served as his anchor in this. A solid beacon of light, a lighthouse amid the dark, bewildered sea of his torturous thoughts. True, only Greg knew the full depth of his traumas and dilemmas (for now, and perhaps Mrs Hudson as well), but all these people? They did more for him than his family ever combined, save for his younger sibling.
“Problem?”
“Hey, John, you could make us popcorn,” Greg said five minutes into the ads. There was no sign of them stopping anytime soon.
right, “- and pretend this silver-grey is the only colour, now
“Would you believe he’s Canadian?” Irene murmured as John coughed to mask his laugh.
be a way to exact vengeance on that hateful woman Adler! I can’t harm her, that’s not nearly enough than what she deserves… No, I have to
“I suppose you’re right,” Greg sighed, scratching the back of his neck. “Sorry, I mean it, it’s just that my dad has a lot of problems at work because of him. Imperius Curses and the like. It’s not easy.”
Sherlock grabbed John by the elbow and scowled at him, disapproval evident in his features. “I do not want the birds to come for your ass.”
The racoon tardily waddled up to Lestrade’s hand. He bared his upper lip, showcasing his tiny yet pointy yellowish teeth, cautiously nipping the salami from Greg’s fingers. Greg withdrew his hand and placed another piece of deli meat on it, carefully offering it to the racoon once it was done eating the first bit.
“Shit,” he said under his breath. Cas, who was observing a framed painting of three cats in a giant throne chair, appeared at his side.
“Will you go and talk to him?” Mary asked, her tone neutral. She didn’t like getting to know others in the Club. Not as a necessity by any means. She had no need for superficial camaraderie that’d turn their back on her whenever the opportunity dictated it. Right now, though, she had to feign interest and be amicable enough to work out what they were dealing with. Bonus if she was the one who fulfilled the task and moved ranks.
“Shush! We won’t speak of the racoon incident. Is it just me or is Grace limping?”
“We should get rid of the crystal,” Kate beat her to it, and she nodded in agreement. “It does more bad than good. Can I crush it?”
“What, why?” Billy and Eddie asked, puzzled by Sherlock’s apprehension. Even John seemed perplexed, but remained silent. Instead, he observed the others to gauge their reactions. Sarah next to them even looked up from her phone.
“I followed Mary around town today,” he said, his tail curling up around his body. “She went to the mall, but I wasn’t allowed to enter so I waited until she came out. She was furious, I could smell her anger from fifty feet away. I hung out a bit longer and guess who was there? That moron guy.”
rude, you know? It was like we’ve known ourselves for years and I felt that he wouldn’t mind. But hey, we can speculate among ourselves, you and I.”
“We’ll check it out. She doesn’t need a whole wardrobe, just enough for three days.”
“And that man over there has crippling anxiety over asking his coworker out,” Sherlock said, a bit louder than he planned, eliciting a startled, wide-eyed stare from the man who stood over bags of dog food clutching a box of chocolates, a trembling thumb jumping across the man’s phone screen as he undoubtedly texted a message to said coworker. “He’ll say yes, most probably. ‘Tis the season and all that.”
of his swing, the girls cheering at his victory, but the mirth was short-lived. The ball flew further in the stalls and behind the tackled bottles that now littered the ground, bouncing off of a box propped in the back, firing back to where Molly stood, clueless of what was coming. The ball hit her square in the face -- well, the outer edge of her eye socket, forceful enough to leave a bruise in its wake.
“Ha, I bet. Who even

“Almost cuddling,” John corrected, but she saw no difference in that.
fun fact: this chapter is 43 words over my word limit I set for myself last year, so extra content?
Sherlock hummed in response. They arrived at Angelo’s. The time showed six o’clock in the afternoon, sharp. He’d ask more, fascinated by every single bit of life John had experienced prior to meeting Sherlock, but it could wait.
Irene bit her upper lip, peeking over the ledge again. She doubted they had a chance of surviving a jump in the bush. Fuck. “I don’t know. Maybe if we jumped onto something soft, but…”
and its readers will
“Ha, well… I’ll tell you later.” His fingers sneaked into John’s hair. “Also, John?”
“Okay. Buckle up, here comes the story about the boy who lived!”
John looked to his mom for some idea of sorts, anything, but she apologetically shrugged and kept on eating.
“Sure. We’ll be your guards if needed. God knows I’ve witnessed too many exes getting possessive. But it won’t hurt to give her the benefit of the doubt.”
“Ugh, I hate that colour,” Irene uttered, completely put off by Mary’s fashion choice. John snorted at that. Yeah, it wasn’t to his taste either. “It doesn’t suit her one bit.”
Back in the hall the atmosphere quietened, save for the thundering beat of his heart and the static popping of lightbulbs above. On his left there was a window of sorts for serving food. Sherlock stood by, leaning his elbows on the sill, staring skeptically at Kate and Irene trying out a nacho sauce machine. John took a moment to appreciate the view, letting his gaze trail the length of Sherlock’s long, aesthetic, toned, strong legs, and then stopped to kick himself mentally before he got too far.
“Listen dude,” John found himself saying. “I’m sorry you’re lonely, but
blasted off. “What’s up with the radio nowadays? Ten years ago it was the same amount of shit, but a bit better. I miss the old days.”
“Hey, uh,” Greg came forward, holding two paper cups full of coffee in both hands. He looked calmer, relieved. “I went out and brought some iced coffee. I know you like those. The guys have drank theirs, and I kept yours in the fridge since it’s too hot to keep it normal outside.”
“And…. Have you talked to Sherlock?”
“Little bastard, what about my self-esteem?” Greg had sobbed fakely, shoving John with his elbow. If it weren’t for Mrs Hudson coming in at that moment, there surely would have been plates and cups breaking.
“When Irene interrupted the other day? You were talking about your experiments but then she came in, you got petty, and then you switched the topic as if we were on it for hours. I thought you… remembered?”
Cas watched his every move, gaze unrelenting and posture alert. He looked at John and Sherlock, a silent question in his eyes, but Sam spoke up first. “So… you talked it out?”
“Did you tell Sam?”
“The…” He repeated the gesture, awkwardly. John laughed, putting his fork down.
“It’s alright, mate,” Greg said, “I saw your brother, and he’s pretty tall. You’ll catch up sooner or later.”
“I don’t understand why the author would introduce this concept only to jeopardise it by making the Unforgivable Curse so powerful that there is no counterspell. Why would that dark wizard use it at every other opportunity to kill the protagonist? He has no creativity. I understand that he’s petty and probably tired of his plans getting delayed, but that’s just ridiculous. From what you have said it seems that there are other spells that could achieve it and cause pain, but he chooses to go along with the curse that doesn’t even hurt you and kills you instantly. He is evil, sure, his genocide ideals align with dictators in human history, but pretty mediocre by the sound of it.”
“You sing?” John asked, Sherlock averting his gaze to the windows in embarrassment.
“Boyfriend is fine, as far as terms go,” Sherlock shrugged, walking them up the stairs once more. “Now go and dry yourself off so I can have a shower.”
“You get spam in real life?”
“Alright then, kid, I’ll be your second big brother. Where’s Sam?”
Mycroft rolled his eyes and John saw how characteristic of the brothers it was. "Believe me, I do, but he is too proud to accept my help. Thus my offer."

“Oh my God, she’s awful,” Sherlock complained, muttering into John’s beige t-shirt.
The corner of Cas’ mouth quirked, and Irene grabbed a pair of white shorts and a pink blouse and a bra to change from her pyjamas in the bathroom. Cas trailed behind her, but he waited outside for obvious reasons. Once Irene resurfaced in the best lesbian image of herself, she trotted downstairs, Cas in tow.
“I got scared,” the girl mumbled, resting her head on Dean’s chest. Cas noticed how he moved his hand up and down her back in what he guessed was a soothing motion. Irene had done that when they hugged as well. He should remember that; his people skills needed to be brushed upon.
“Biscuits,” John grinned, reaching for a package of some rock-like food Sherlock doubted was edible. “Twice baked. Here.”
Normandy took a stand in front of Irene in the shadow that obstructed Sherlock’s view of Irene, and the goth girl leaned in, arms drawing around his step-sister’s neck. She took something out of her pocket. Sherlock’s heart raced, and he frantically tapped his knuckles against the stained glass in hopes of getting Irene out of her love-struck reverie.
“Is that so? Potter is in danger of his life?” someone else barked out a laugh. “Don’t be ridiculous. There is only so much he can come up with. He’s a show off.”
“Oh, I would forget, here,” she handed them each a refrigerated bottle of water. “You must be thirsty, drink up. Summer only just started officially and it’s already too hot.”
“Good, but let me explain so that we’re on the same page,” Sherlock cut in, spitting words faster than Eminem or Daveed Diggs in his rendition of ‘
Mirage rolled his eyes. “Precisely.”
They burst out laughing at Kate’s impression of their future eighty-year-old arses, shoulders shaking violently.
recently, I have started watching Smosh Pit and I gotta say, I love these guys so much?? Bee is obsessed with dream smp, and I'm here in my corner laughing my ass off at their try not to laugh videos and other series, we're both crazy while Dee supports us sipping a margarita
“You’re welcome!” John said cheekily, and for a bit there was a spark of connection, of something deeper. Their eyes met, and warmth spread through Sherlock’s chest that filled him with joy and contentment.
“Do you know that I am considering buying one as well? There are never enough precautions,” she said, and Greg could hear her sardonic smile through the dial. “Oh, you should’ve seen John and Sherlock…”
As they walked past the Santa Claus scam (Sherlock smelling nicotine, which narrowed his senses), one young elf in particular made it a point to wave at Rosie, saying, “Have a happy, merry Christmas!”
"Hm? Oh, yeah," he nodded. The Baker Street flat felt surreal at times. It didn’t look like a wizard den, they haven’t really flashed spells around for even the most seemingly mundane tasks - well, he wouldn’t know, he spent minimum time here. "Kreacher handles the cooking and he’s a lot more vigorous to do the cleaning too. We told him to take it easy, but he refused. He seems very happy at last. The place is slowly becoming a second home to us."
“And you think it’s stupid, the whole show. Which it is, I won’t deny it. But it’s fiction, Sherlock. A silly one, but fiction nonetheless. It doesn’t have to be accurate or make sense.”
“Then listen to me. Future doctor, remember?
“Uh, American football. Rugby. She gets really heated over the matches. Don’t bring up the Oregon Rugby League if you don’t want a powerpoint presentation on it. But I’d recommend it, Molly does nice presentations.”

persona’s recollections of them.”
Kate merely shrugged at the news. “Greg’s as good as us. Guy earned a place at the table, don’t you think?”
To be honest, this wasn’t his fault. He wasn’t sure falling was either of the three’s fault, but Irene got the closest to the pit when she’d dragged them out to the forest to have an adventure on their own when everybody else left the house, and she slipped. Cas and Dean, having fast reflexes and saviour instincts engraved in their molecules and flesh, reached for her but she dragged them in, the soil at the edge of the pit crumbling beneath their feet. They were falling and falling and Dean and Irene screaming half their lungs out, but the dawn of realisation hit them that indeed, they were in a bottomless pit. Cas tried to use his wings to cooperate and fly them out, but they accelerated beyond the point of using the current to their advantage. And so they were stuck in an infinite loop until it threw them up at the beginning. That’s what was written in the mystery journal -- the author speculated it was an infinite loop with a chance of swallowing you forever, but it also had a great chance of throwing you out. Except for socks, especially if you really needed them.
She ushered her time traveller party back in TARDIS without explaining what went awry this time around, the blue door shutting by itself behind her. She took a deep breath, leaning against the firm metal as she collected her thoughts. “Have you discovered anything new?”
“Yeah, of course. I’ll make sure I don’t forget the dogs’ leashes.”
Irene and Kate stared at him in utter disbelief, but Mrs Hudson merely blinked and resumed the conventional means of conversation, steering it back to cucumber masks. Greg enjoyed confounding people around him, even though most of them thought he was joking when he recounted the many stories he had up his sleeves. Little did they know…. Hm, he wondered how Bobby was doing these days. The last time they had contact was what, ten years ago? Hopefully he was still alive. Hunter or not, he deserved peace too. And they had had fun together.
“None of your business,” the hunter growled, standing up to reveal that half his face was bloodied beyond recognition, bits of flesh hanging from his cheek and jaw. John would wince in sympathy were the man more friendly.
"You okay? We were just joking," he said, eyebrows furrowed and a smile on his face.
John was sure Sherlock was blushing under the cover of shadows of the night sky. Truth be told, he never looked better -- well, perhaps every day -- and John fought the urge to kiss him
“Not the worst plan we’ve had,” Sherlock replied smugly, letting his arms fall limp along his lean body. He was wearing an olive jacket over a purple t-shirt. He and Irene bothered to put on jeans for the occasion of going to town. Greg dressed in his usual suit trousers and white shirt, but John went in his second set of pyjamas, because giving a fuck about that when you’re tired, on holiday, and in mud-filled square in Oregon, is simply out of the equation.
“Is it because of your wings?” John asked, walking behind them. Cas ducked his head, tilting it from side to side.
“Underestimating me, Sherly?”
“What’s wrong, Sherlock?” Lestrade asked, hopping down on the floor.
He was breathing heavily, the adrenaline built up fast. He thought John may dismiss him as the crazy one, but he just stared at him, eyebrows lifted. He breathed in and Sherlock sucked in a breath, preparing to be laughed at.
“No, but…”
*Sam Winchester heavy breathing* LORE!
“Dull, but I concede your point,” Sherlock’s shoulders rose and fell.
“Please behave,” John said mildly, but forcefully enough to stop the siblings from bickering. Sherlock turned to Greg, who happily consumed the rest of the sandwiches akin to a vacuum, or a very hungry beagle.
“Three, actually.”
in which there is a mysterious journal
“What’s gotten into you?” John said, looking to the side at his friend. He only got a glimpse of his reflection in the window (which badly needed a wash, remind Greg -- oh, who’s he kidding, he’ll have to do it). Sherlock pouted, teeth chewing at the inside of his bottom lip. “Is it because I broke up your fight? Seriously, I knew you and Wilkes aren’t exactly on the best of terms, but is that what you want? To fight with someone who isn’t even worth it? Honestly, Sherlock. I thought you knew better than to get into brawls with
“Hungry?” he asked John, following him back inside.
"I do, but exploring the castle with you is not as dreadful as I thought it would be. Don't take it personally."
“Blueberry for me,” Sherlock decided, handing Mrs Hudson the card as she stood up to go order. She didn’t need to ask John, he also loved the blueberry deliciousness, but his absolute favourite was Angelo’s apple pie. Sherlock, however, didn’t know this. “Wait -- what about John?”
“Sounds good. Cas?”
Silence. John’s brows furrowed as he repeated the question, but no answer came. Did Sherlock seriously think that pretending he wasn’t there would fool John?
episode 5, chapter 4
John shrugged and got up to clean the table. Sherlock helped him, memorising what belonged where in the meantime as they danced around each other. John left the pancakes on the table, covered with a large see-through plastic bowl for Irene to see. It was strangely domestic and synchronized.
John followed him out and down on the platform, making sure the tapestry looked undisturbed. “Wow, how come no one knows about this?”
“Well, that was easy,” he laughed awkwardly, scratching at the nape of his neck. “Uh… hi? I mean, we expected the search for you to be longer…”
“Yes,” Sherlock said. “Lestrade isn’t the most observant person when it comes to business outside of the Mystery Shack.”
Dozens of them soared through the sky about to charge on the two wizards.
"Thanks," John said after the class was over. Sherlock nodded and the two departed. "If you get in trouble you know who to call!"
He turned to face Selcout, whose eyes softened a bit at the gesture, but he didn’t dare say anything. He put a hand on his shoulder, prompting him up, which Selcout did, though he looked a little confused at the change. More and more Slytherins were stunned by what he just said, some were muttering,
“What?”
Special thanks to Bee and Dee, the two crazy women I subject to the deep lore of this fic <3
Also, hah, Sherlock trying to be suave about his feelings, but is he? Hmmmm
He crept up to the vending machine inside the gift shop by the door near the museum part of the Shack and typed in a four-digit code. He waited for the machine to soundlessly slide to the left so he could slither into the space behind it, a set of stairs leading deeper under the house.
there's throwback to a certain spn episode, but idk the number so if ya know let me know pls
Filtering out the sounds of splashing water and giggles, Sam opened the door on the driver’s side and collapsed into the seat. He reached into the storage compartment and took out their father’s journal. It was much smaller and compact than Sherlock’s -- that was more of a tome, to be honest -- but it had provided them with invaluable information throughout their years of hunting all the same. He flipped through it, looking for any clues regarding mermaids -- and he got nothing. No lore. That was anticlimactic.

“That woman over there by the cat food has forty-seven of them,” he said, pointing a finger at the older lady in a huge, pink coat. “People would say she’s crazy, but that’s just a stereotype. And why? Because most people are quick to judge and cling to societal judgement that ostracizes anyone who isn’t like them. Crazy cat ladies are said to have lost their marbles, which is an idiom for implying someone who is bonkers, but that lady over there is the CEO of a fashion company. You can tell that by her outfit, and the brand, plus the way she confidently carries herself around. She likely has no children and the cats are a replacement, but she takes great care of them. She has the means to do so.”
John’s cheeks flared up bright red. He stuttered a hesitant answer, and Greg left him splash in the puddle. “I - you - we… Fuck, okay! Fine, whatever. I don’t want to give myself some false hope, alright? Sherlock’s smarter than anyone I know, he’s funny, and his take on things is refreshing and…”
"Pretty please?"
. And
“I’d rather wait,” he shook his head. “Just… until this curse thing is sorted out.”
The Doctor claimed his position at the console panel. The turquoise light illuminated his sharp face like a maniacal villain, except he was a very sweet if eccentric alien. “It’s rewind time, everybody!”
basically can' wait to show you the rest of it muehehehe
His phone rang, startling him out of his exhausted reverie. Greg pushed himself off the wall he leaned against, his body heavy and going limp. The ID of the caller displayed a familiar name.
Take care and don't get stuck in a time loop,
“Can I have breakfast first? You can interrogate me later. Besides, how come you remembered only now? I thought you being a Ravenclaw and so
Sherlock winced at the sight, but she only had two stuck in her palm. Mrs. Hudson raised her eyebrows slightly and blinked. That wasn’t the usual response to getting splinters.
He looked at the man, now breathing heavily, chest and sternum shaking from the sheer effort to stay alive. John was a man of his word, and he would be damned if he let a merfolk dry out on land. Shivers ran down his spine as the last throes of screams trailed after them, and he quickened his pace. Murmuring, he started sending his forest healing magic through his fingertips to aid the merfolk’s immune system fight the fever. Time was their enemy.
don't worry folks, I got enough for this fic, I'm just a bit unhappy about the potterlock fic and how I neglected it and it's just a teeny bit demotivating that I wasn't able to focus on it more during the school year, sigh
“I’m glad you like it! I’ll make sure to pass your compliments to the chef. How’s Greg doing?”

My humble tumblr:
“I’m curious, ‘s all,” John shrugged. Sherlock felt his gaze on himself. He didn’t answer. “Hold on - do you even
Thank you all for reading, I hope you'll enjoy this chapter! We're almost at 500 hits like whoa :0 COOKIES FOR YOU! <3 I'm listening to Schuyler Sisters from the Hamilton musical, and they just sang 'Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now~'

“Hm. I haven't thought of that. What if his birthday is on Christmas Eve? Does he hate it because he gets less presents?”
They marched back to the castle that threw long shadows over the Forbidden Forest. They slipped in, quiet as mice, ears propped to listen to any sign of Prefects or Filch patrolling the halls.
“Why pinetree?”
“Black with monochromatic colours of the rainbow, I think.”
Sherlock licked his lips, regarding Irene as though he were her tired nanny. Usually it was the other way around. But this moose of a Brit hadn’t a clue of what it felt like to not be able to reach your favourite item in the cupboard, having to use chairs or
“Fine,” Sherlock huffed, closing the journal and tossing it under his pillow. Lying down on his side, he propped his head on his palm. The three of them formed a sort of triangle; John sat backed up against Sherlock’s bedside table, Irene at the end of his feet a little more to the middle of the room, and then Sherlock on his bed. “What gossip do you have, then?”
Henry hooted anyway, and Carl startledly sat up, eyes wide with fear.
“He does, actually. Not toys, but he used to be in charge of a garrison,” Dean said, smirking.
“That’s pretty rude, you know,” Irene deadpanned, her voice low. Her shoulders froze, her back rigid in defense. “I didn’t get to Toronto for nothing. Fashion isn’t black and white. It is whatever makes a person their own self.”
Thnak you for reading, and I wish you all a very nice day/night wherever you are~
“Your timing is, as always, horrid, Lestrade,” Sherlock clipped, standing up. He held out a hand for John, who accepted it and shut the doors close. No need to flood the house.
Dean shrugged. “Sure, Princess. I’ll get you the biggest teddy there is!”
“Too bad, we’ve got two dogs already. Grace, stay! It’s a goat, not a tiger.”
John considered that. His family was full of smokers and he grew up hating the habit. When he arrived first to Reichenbach Falls sixteen years ago, Greg wasn’t smoking. He took it up gradually, but suddenly nonetheless. Mrs Hudson had once told him that it used to be a stress reliever, but
“Disgusting analogy. But yes, you’re right. That only applies to Mummy’s baking, and Mrs Hudson’s excellent pies, though.”
Distinctly he heard John speak and had to tune in to let the words sink in. “Sorry, what?”
He gulped down half of the bottle in seconds. He hadn’t realised how thirsty he was. The air was heavy, suffocating, not because the ventilation broke down, but rather from the anxiety building up. The M Club irritated him greatly to near apoplexy, and the fact that he hadn’t figured out what to do about the curse that plagued him every day didn’t add much positivity. It didn’t cause anything overly hurtful -- well, debatable if it ever comes to breaking it and the fallout of what it had done -- but it drove him nuts. What could cause a block so seamless and subtle you yourself started questioning your own sanity? He had a nagging thought that the M Club could have had their fingers in the scheme, but they’re a bunch of morons playing big boys who are in reality incapable of proper brainwork. Idiots. Or rather, idjits, that fits them more.
Cas promised that he would tell them immediately once he was able to perceive their auras. He cleared his throat, standing up to wake up Irene. She stirred, clearly unhappy about the intrusion.
“I wonder how the kids are doing,” he blurted out suddenly. Mrs Hudson was going off tangent about boutique shops and a bakery in the south of town she liked back in the day.
important.”
And, starting September first, they got down to solving the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets. But, unbeknownst to them, it would reveal far more than what they had expected.
Jim sniffed. John stood there like a glued chess piece, absolutely stunned by how fast this deduction proceeded and he wasn't prepared for it. Carl had the same reaction, as if he were hit by a brick wall. Tears ran down the little boy's cheeks, wetting his skin and farther saddening his already heartbroken face. He hastily grabbed his school bag and got out of there as fast as his legs allowed him to. Carl looked to John for some kind of explanation, but didn't wait around and (after scowling at Sherlock) ran after Jim.
Soooo, there's that just one more chapter and we move onto another episode out of twenty!
The Doctor crossed his arms, then compulsively uncrossed them and scratched his head. Donna took popcorn out of somewhere and nudged Irene to eat. “Cardiff serves as a veil or a portal, if you will. It allows spacecraft coming through to be regulated by Torchwood, usually. Extraterrestrials can cross to Earth and back.”
“There’s bound to be a reason behind this,” Sherlock muttered, and his hands met under his chin in a prayer gesture as they often did when he was thinking and deducing. “It’s not a coincidence anymore. If Cas says it’s blatant to him, then they’re significant. The bee… I’ve seen it before. Cas, could you confirm our aura colours when you see them clearly?”
Sherlock took the liberty of sitting atop a countertop, legs hanging freely. If he could, he’d be right next to John, but he already spread out food over his side of the counter. He watched him quietly for a moment, contemplating the question. ‘Rating today’ is a broad task. Overall it was looking good so far. Individual periods, less so, except for the most recent one. He sensed a drop of shyness, possibly regarding their coital activities…
episode 5, chapter 5
“Sheesh! Just askin’. Can’t a superior know how his inferior colleague’s love life is doing? After all, you put a lot into it. Such high stakes. Joining the Club to beg to get him to break up with his…”
He tried to be as vague as possible. He wouldn’t mind revealing it to John, Sherlock, and Irene, but that could wait. He wouldn’t want for John’s uncle to arrive in the midst of his retelling.
In retrospect, Dean and Cas should’ve been warned about handling tiny Irene, but it’s been a literal decade and a half since Sherlock’s interaction with her child persona. She seemed taken by the hunters and angel, though, so it was a good sign and she behaved nicely in their presence. However, he should have known that it was only calm before the storm.
“You know,” Marina said, purring. “Maybe… Maybe living here could be more bearable. With friends, I mean.”
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!”
“If you need to see him urgently, I’ll go and find him,” Sherlock offered, bobbing his head towards the front door.
Irene and the group cooed over it together and Jake shifted in her lap, unaware of what to do when he’s being the centre of many people’s and puppets’ affection. Pocahontas petted his snout and hugged him around the neck. Someone’s stomach grumbled.
Ah, it’s that Potter kid some people fussed about. He could see it now, and he instinctively searched for the foolproof sign that it is indeed him - the scar, which was described by many over the years. Blake didn’t know how to feel about this whole ordeal.
episode 15, chapter 2
Inside, they settled into a stall in the middle of the diner, Sherlock sat near the window, Irene graciously sliding in next to him while Mrs Hudson seated herself on the opposite side of the cubicle. Since it was lunch, a number of people came in to eat the cook’s delicious meals. After a short reading of the menu, Irene made up her mind and said she’ll have a french toast. Sherlock chose to go with the omelette.
As such, they ended up holding onto the woman’s fringe, light as feathers so that they went unnoticed. Until later when she blew the hair out of her eyes and Irene and Kate were sent flying again, landing on top of her head. In her car. With
Irene gave him a wicked smile, a playful yet crude spark in her deep blue eyes. “Would you be able to outwit a detective dog, Mr Know-It-All?”
Sherlock sucked in a breath. Good, he doesn’t have to face him that soon. Maybe, if he’s clever enough, he can avoid him all summer, if only to escape Irene’s remarks. But meeting Lestrade’s gaze, he felt a frown scrunch up his brows. Lestrade eyed him with a
“We’re here for horcruxes, Mr. Holmes. Voldemort used dark magic to create them to make sure he becomes immortal. Professor Dumbledore and I put the pieces together shortly before… Well, Professor Lupin managed to contact us and direct us to you. Technically Hermione did, but you get the gist of it.”
He resurfaced steadily, as if he were underwater and swimming up from depths of an ocean. His ears tuned to a weak melody he recognised, but not immediately. He stirred, his neck stiff, but John’s voice commanded him to stay as he was.
played on the radio when we drove to the mall,” John explained. “Cas liked the song.”
John put a hand on Sherlock’s forehead (again - was this a land custom?), and Sherlock blinked mutely, tilting his head upright to communicate that he was listening.
Sherlock took out his wand, pointed at the stone wall and said, "Alohomora!"
Sigh. How did he end up here?
“Obviously,” said Sherlock and he greeted the unexpected guests politely.
Greg pinched the bridge of his nose. He should’ve called an exterminator, or a veterinarian to extract the animal. Why were
The former statement calmed Gloria down. The latter made her shake, her ghostly outline blurring noticeably, the sky above them falling dark. Sherlock knew he was walking on thin ice.
“This was after you left Florida or before?” Mrs Hudson inquired, helping Irene chop the cucumbers into thin round slices.
“Irene’s is blood-red like her unwithering rose and yours is purple, like that talking mirror had suggested. John’s stayed the same, golden-yellow. Sam has none to speak of, but that can be either because he’s an abomination by Heaven’s standards or because the origin of this is out of this world, which would confirm my suspicion.”
“What’s up?”
I'll see you on the 25th!
Alright, fuck this. Either he was going delirious or he became a part of some hallucinating phenomenon he had no clue existed. Fuck. Three times. THREE that John had returned to that stupid fucking flower parade bullshit where Mrs Hudson picked out that (actually very pretty) stupid fucking flowerpot and sunflower seeds.
Come dusk, John was exhausted. He passed a good chunk of territory since morning, but this monotonous routine would be his sole companion for the foreseeable future. Well, he guessed that was a better alternative than listening to some twat going on and on about the weather and meaningless crap like that.
Back then, Sherlock’s developing feelings were nothing but a desperate cry in the distance behind mountains of worry and denial. Today, they reign a whole wing in his Mind Palace shamelessly, and he lets them. He didn’t even remember the last time he was this happy and elated. Maybe sometime in March, but that point in time is somehow blurry in his mind -- strange, he usually has a clear memory of everything. Who cares? He has John, that’s enough now.
Yesterday’s conversation with Sherlock stuck out to him. He found it adorable how forthcoming Sherlock was in his curiosity about John and everything that concerned him. The immeasurable comfort and domesticity between them didn’t even feel new, as though it had always been present. He chuckled to himself; is this what those alleged ‘soulmate’ connections were like? But one thing bugged him. Now, he had nothing against Sherlock asking him about his family, but he’d been honest when he told him that he doesn’t know how to talk about ‘everything’ -- he’s used to shutting up about it, letting it sink to the deepest crevices of his being to rot there. Hence the reference to Greg, who knows most of what had happened over the years. His family was a headache at the best of times, and at the worst…
“How about I buy the water, still?” Irene suggested. She sniffed at her armpit, the musky smell building up. “It’s hot as hell, the dogs will need it. I’ll run here and then back to catch Mike before Andrew West ruins his chance.”
“Yeah, I knew most of them by heart,” John laughed, and Sherlock finally joined him on the bed. Sherlock leaned in to press their mouths together, nipping at John’s lower lip, and John put his arms around Sherlock’s waist pulling him into an embrace and into his lap.
That… was a reasonable compromise. Still, Dean and Castiel’s reaction was hardly predictable. However, Sam’s curiosity made him nod absently, pondering the possibility, and Irene took it as an all-the-way agreement. “Great! Can you tell Cas and Dean while I go get Marina? Thanks!”
That almost gave him a whiplash. John abruptly turned the other way should Sherlock realise what he said and have a meltdown over it. Oh shit. His heart raced, picking up speed as waves of affection flooded him anew. John risked a glance over his shoulder to see Sherlock going about his castle building business, discussing wings or whatnot with Redbeard and Grace. Judging by the looks of it Sherlock either hadn’t realised what he’d said or pretended he didn’t utter a word.
“Mrs Hudson likes her flower beds a lot,” he said by way of explanation. He navigated them to his car, backseats of which were covered in numerous paper bags, each containing whatever the upkeeper requested. Lestrade unlocked the car, locks clicking inside the four doors. “And the lady there owes me a favour because I helped her out years ago. Never intended her to actually owe me, but she insists and so far she repays me in flowers.”
“Maybe, but that’s not
He quickly rewound the video and watched the ordeal again - her teeth fell out as if it were Mrs Hudson’s prosthetic dentals, which was both appalling and scary.
“That’s repetitive,” John stated, leaning into Sherlock’s shoulder.
“I... No? No, I would’ve remembered. I have to ask him. I only know he hates Christmas. Ridiculous git.”
Irene grinned. “Okay, Johnny.
get involved with Henry for his own good -- don’t scare him, don’t stress him.”
He pointed at the medium large slurpee cup at the kitchen counter. The sweet liquid was trickling down its side lazily, as if provoking Sherlock to chuck it down the drain. Which is exactly what he’d do, if it weren’ for Irene who already chugged it into her belly. Great. Just what they needed. A kid junkie Irene high on sugar.
“I don’t particularly fancy another trip in the car with Lestrade that soon, to be honest,” Sherlock said, cheekily, getting an eye roll out of the man himself and a giggle out of John.
“What do you mean?”
Mary’s phone buzzed again, but she retrieved it from under her fluffy pillows in no hurry. “What? Yes, grandpa. I’ll be at the tent in ten minutes for the rehearsal. Yes. Love you too, bye.”
"You changed your mind." It was a statement. John walked next to Sherlock up the stairs, Peeves somewhere above them throwing water-filled balloons at students.
The actor doll ripped the sword out with ease -
. But I do find it hilarious that you interrogated a whole elf and ran miles worth marathon in the short span of half an hour.”
“For ruining our date,” Sherlock said, averting his gaze from John to the floor, shifting his weight on a canted hip.
“Jesus, okay! Stop! I’m not talking with you about this over the phone! That’s just… no!”
“Dean made use of the multiple-headed bear you have there,” Cas added. “He called it Huggybear and charged people for hugging it.”
“Yes!”
“They’re adults, of course they’re fine,” she soothed him, smiling. “You don’t have to worry. John is especially responsible and well versed in your business plan to navigate the Shack for a few days.”
“Okay. Do we jump across?”
But as it turned out, he didn’t have to go far to stumble upon Sherlock. The moment he exited the shop, the uninviting sounds of threats and taunts reached his ears, unpleasant as they were. The Mall wasn’t terribly busy, and the row was happening at a strategic place away from the eyes of visitors, save for the audio broadcast.
“Know her?” Mrs Hudson cackled, dabbing at her eyes with a napkin. “I
“I…. My memory is very flimsy. I have no idea how I ended up here. The last thing I know is that I was with my friend Dean and… suddenly I wake up and I see a supposedly extinct dodo in front of me. Shouldn’t we be in Mauritius?”
Irene laughed, thinking of how Sherlock could come across as intimidating. He never fooled her, but she could see how his long, gangling limbs and and searching, intelligent gaze made people and Jake alike unsettled. “You don’t have to worry about my brother. He’s just a twat and a giant, pining idiot.”
“Because it contains such ingredients. I try to choose products that weren’t tested or made immorally. Thankfully more companies consider the vegan option nowadays.”
“Jesus, John was right,” Irene sighed in relief, and a bit of shame gnawed at her conscience. “We shouldn’t have toyed with the crystals.”
“Guys, listen - what happened today? That was
“Oh….kay? I supposed that’s good? Listen, if this is about bribing me to spy on him to see if he goes around provoking-”
The kids all yelled, and an invisible force hurdled them down on the satin seats. Sherlock clutched John’s wrist tightly on instinct. Eddie, Billy, and Wilkes were lifted from the ground and transferred to the front row by the same unknown force, and Kate and Sarah were dragged across the carpet as well.
about it.”
He suppressed a shudder at the thought of these creatures existing. No. Nope. Away with this. He was
Greg frowned. "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, John. He's the most evil wizard ever. He has those cronies helping him, the Death Eaters. My dad's been having troubles because of them lately."
The mute princesses clapped, but Cage didn’t seem satisfied. He stormed off to their display, waving the knife threateningly above them as they cringed away from it. “Louder and more sarcastically!”
John jumped into action, brain in overdrive. Careful so as not to step on the wing, its twin spread out on the other side of a man lying face-down in the grass, he called out to Sherlock. He kneeled by the left side of the man whose short jet black hair stuck out in all directions. John put the back of his hand close to the man’s face to see if he was breathing: he was. He hesitated. How should he turn him around when he possessed such large wings? And what even
And sure enough, by the end of the week Greg managed to convince a House Elf he was a friend of the robes' owner. His name was Anderson, a Third Year Hufflepuff. A rather crude looking guy.
“Oh, at least you won’t have to spend time crammed up in a plane over the Atlantic,” Mummy had said over the phone a month ago. “After all, Toronto is closer to Oregon than London.”

“Not bad. We sold some merch, the t-shirts are the favourites today, and then the caps. An old couple bought five Sascrotch statues. I have no idea what they found so funny that they’re going to display it in their funeral home.”
“But well worth it, Sebastian,” Magnussen said, pouring himself whiskey from a flask. He offered some to Seb, but he declined. “She’s bound to the Club by contract. Even if her beloved Golden Boy went insane and incoherent, she wouldn’t be able to do a sliver of action about it. She’s in my possession now, and she’s not escaping in the foreseeable future. Plus the serum did work.”

There was a half-growl, half-whimper coming from his bedroom. Seb’s head snapped up, eyes blazing. “Shut up!”
Hi people! I am horrible and procrastinated on this again. So barely 2k words and another mini cliffhanger. But I delivered, so there's that!
special thanks to bee, dee, and my friend T <3
Twenty minutes later, Sherlock was softly snoring on his side of the car. Redbeard and Grace were out of it too, and John had a difficulty keeping his eyes open. As he pulled up to the Shack, Grace stirred awake. John turned the AC off and got out.
"Why do I bother, I'll be there to save you anyway," he sighed, defeated. He knew what to expect, though he had no intentions of thinking about it.
“That sounds dangerous,” James said with a frown, hugging Gloria tighter.
please have a look:
“I knew you’d do it!” Kate said, rushing past him with Sarah to explore the inside of the theatre.
Naturally, Sherlock stepped closer, invading John’s personal space. He was used to it by now, after a year of dating ever since the day they met, this was nothing new to him. John held up the paints for Sherlock to take and the detective inspected them carefully.
“Oh, hello, John,” the imposter greeted from the side, calm and collected. John shot him a glare. “Don’t be angry, I told you I’ll be back shortly. A bit of an inconvenience, seeing Sherlock here, though. Not for long.”
“I’ll keep that in mind,” John said briefly, eyebrows hitching up. Then he countered her with a question of his own. “How are you?”
“Sure! They smell delicious.”
Sherlock’s curls flounced as he shook his head. “Not really. It’s similar, but I’d be the first Consulting Detective out there. I could help police in London or wherever I end up, but preferably there. God knows Scotland Yard is always in need of help.”
Thank you all for reading and I wish you all a very nice day/night wherever you are~
episode 2, chapter 4
“What about Angelo?” Greg asked, walking to her sink to wash his and Sam’s plates.
If the victim were alive, one way or another, with the help of a necromancer or without, it may have been able to support the statement or deny it. Unfortunately, the body has gone stone cold long before it was discovered, thus the possibility was annihilated beyond obvious. Now the body lay twisted on the ground into a form that roughly resembled a human pretzel. A crumpled note was imprisoned by the grip of his rigor mortis fingers, small enough to go unnoticed by the forensics team. Well, not really. They were just idiots.
“Oh, don’t worry. I don’t let casual people have meals on the house that often,” he winked at her, mischief sparkling in his eyes, and he retreated to the kitchen. Angelo shouted the order out loud, put on his chef’s hat, and proceeded to dish out their meals in record time.
He spotted the firepit Mrs Hudson had mentioned before she departed. It was close to the main road, flames alight even though dying out slowly as they ate at the last bits of fuel they had. Mrs Hudson surely didn’t expect them to wander out at this hour being chased by maniacal cursed dolls, John imagined.
Updated: 25.2. 2021
“You can keep dreaming, Graham,” John teased, eliciting a smirk from Sherlock and a squint from Greg. “Sorry, couldn’t resist. Want to listen to more Queen?”
John put on a poker face when Mrs Hudson swooned over petunias and orchids for the seventh time as they passed the garden section at the general store’s property. She and Greg had assured him it would be a quick job. Get in, find the target, pay if applicable, and get out. Mrs Hudson insisted on paying and pointedly glared at Greg so that he wouldn’t try to scam the owners.
“You’re the one to speak. You have a tooth sweeter than the blood of Oompa Loompas.”
Sherlock waltzed into the kitchen, regretfully seeing Lestrade seated behind the table, cigarette in hand. Mrs Hudson was working outside, then.
“Who are you?” Lestrade asked, knowing she must be important if Sally let her past the tape.
“Okay,” he began when Irene had gone. “We’ve met a woman who has ridiculous amounts of information on you, can deduce you, and apparently knows about someone you know about who you’ve not told me about. So, what do we do?”
“No, not really...I was the one acting like a tit this time,” John explained, taking a long swig of his drink.
“Oh, Sherlock is still working on the case,” John chuckled. “He has high government clearance.”
“Oh you don’t worry about me after all this time,” John rolled his eyes, handing Sherlock a mug and taking one for himself. “This is hardly the first time I’ve been on the battlefield.”
“Fine, I would like to experience mutual orgasms with you,” Sherlock made sure to make his voice as deep as possible, turning it into a purr.
"I don't know," John snapped. However, he took a deep breath, walking over and kissing him. "I love you," he said much more gently.
"Gregory insisted. The good doctor did as well, I assume?"
