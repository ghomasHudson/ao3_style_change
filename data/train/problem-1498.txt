she turned to face John momentarily and took a deep breath. A big explanation was coming, he thought.  “I need to explain something,” she started. “I’m not a fraud or a plagiarist, like Leslie.” She sighed.  “Seeing as you have me over a barrel, here…I might as well just tell you—” and here she interrupted herself, saying, “—one sec—” and then she stood up awkwardly and shuffled around her small seat. She sat down again on the other side of it, now facing them both and they stepped back a bit to give her some room - like her audience. John crossed his arms, which Sherlock knew to be one of his listening positions, and waited.
too.’ John jerked his head back from Sherlock's shoulder, out of his friend's hand, so he could look at Sherlock's face. He needed to see his face at that moment to know for sure.
and lunged forward to capture John in a genuinely affectionate embrace. John dropped his overnight bag just in time but the flowers and the bottle of wine he was carrying were unavoidably enveloped in Mr. Holmes' enthusiastic welcome. "Hello, hello! How lovely to see you, dear boy!" bellowed Mr. Holmes warmly, clapping John on the back and then releasing him.
as opposed to
'Oh, of course,' thought John. He sipped his tea and waited and moments later, Sherlock said, "Train leaves in an hour and ten from Liverpool Street. Fancy a trip to the seaside?" He grabbed his coat and dropped his phone into the pocket. As he put his scarf on, he said flippantly, "Oh, and er…” he lifted his chin and John caught but didn’t understand the mischievous glint in his eye. “…Bring your book."
That took the wind out of John's sails. "Me?" he asked.
He went all round it while John stood and watched, his hands in his pockets, waiting for some comment.
” and then he shook his head, laughing and still grinning, had added, "Sometimes you do really shock me, Sherlock!" but Sherlock saw that he was shocked and amused and not shocked and angry.
He remembered the heavy pressure of the sun, a hot weight on his shoulders and neck, an incessant itch on his left calf just below his knee from a mildly infected mosquito bite. He remembered the tinny voice squawking in his ear piece, the drop of sweat trickling down the side of his face and tickling at the front of his right ear, near where his helmet strap was. He remembered that someone had just begun to shout hoarsely in the Pashto language; they were yelling, "To the left, to the left!" frantically from the broken ruins of a house in front of him and his platoon. John looked through his gun sight and had taken a deep slow breath and as he had let it go, he had begun to scan the windows of the building through it, and then his left shoulder went wrong beside him. Something hit it with the force of a flying brick and it simply stopped being his left shoulder. Then it exploded in a ball of burning agony, and he gasped and swore in a small, small voice because he knew it was bad. Nothing with that agonising, numbing, dead, burning pain was going to be anything less than very,
John knew better than to make any mention of it though. Mycroft was standing at the sink when they entered the room, swirling some hot water around in the teapot to warm it first.
John smiled. "Good," he said. He knew it was. He knew that he was good at it.  The sports masseur girlfriend used to say that he had very 'good hands'. Apparently some people just did. So he concentrated on doing a really good job, changing the position and direction of his pressure and working on the various muscle groups between Sherlock's shoulder blades and then at the base of his neck, being careful to avoid too much superficial friction on Sherlock’s skin so it wouldn't get uncomfortable.
Sherlock and John could hear Siger asking Agatha politely about her journey, and she then began detailing the horrors of travelling long distance by public transport. John glanced over at Sherlock and said, “Shouldn't we go and…?” He inclined his head towards the kitchen, meaning
“Exactly that. I wrote it and sent it to Mycroft. From Greg.”
The words were like insults. ‘And it's all John's fault.’
moaned Greg, laughing, loving it.  “I suspected it last night but if you're gonna keep sayin’ it like that, I really don't stand a chance…Let me just finish my toast a minute—” he waved what was left, “—and I
So at that, John laughed for real and went over there, and over the next three-hot-and-steamy-quarters of an hour later, Sherlock told him
John too, was thinking desperately of not coming -
"Shut up, for one thing," snarled John, and grabbed one of the chairs angrily from the table at his side. He set it behind Sherlock but turned it sideways, so that when Sherlock sat down, the back of the chair would be positioned at his right side and therefore Sherlock's entire back would be exposed for John to reach.
he moaned again, mostly to himself, as he squeezed it quite pleasingly hard. Mycroft’s auditory mind palace Greg-room was having to enlarge itself exponentially for all this vocal delight. Let alone all the visuals. The sensations and feelings he really didn't know quite what to do with yet… He lowered his head to kiss Greg, holding himself up on one forearm, with his fingers in Greg’s hair, and his other hand slipping under Greg’s shoulder; pressing his pelvis and rolling his hips slowly against Greg’s, the oil squelching filthily and silkily between them. Mycroft released Greg’s mouth to gasp at the slick sensation as their lower bodies began to slide against each other frictionlessly. “Gosh,” Mycroft whispered, “this is rather…”
“Still yes," confirmed Sherlock again with a desperate conviction, and that was enough for John.
“Oh, goody!
Sherlock fixed his gaze on John and narrowed his eyes, canting his head away whilst keeping his eyes still. The effect was very disconcerting.
but not quite enough. Mycroft moaned with his mouth closed a second time, more a long reverberation in his throat, and suddenly Greg released Mycroft’s neck and growled, “Right,
There was a moment of silence where only the rain could be heard on the glass outside.
John cried out as he finished. As the shock waves slowly began to spiral down, John opened his eyes and looked at Sherlock and found Sherlock was watching him with a look of intense focus on his face. ‘He was doing what I did,’ thought John, ‘watching me at the moment of release.’ Sherlock let go of John's cock slightly but kept his hand where it was. John smiled, a little embarrassed at his enthusiastic and very vocal release. He loosened his own hold on Sherlock. “Er…well…” he began, and Sherlock smiled.
Mycroft nodded quickly to indicate he was following the story and that Greg should continue. So Greg did. “Yeah, well, anyway, Sherlock realised that the bloke was
pause. He tried to stab me in the throat, but I was lucky and I managed to half block the blow so he only got me in the chest."
John felt his face redden. “I…erm…it's....ah...no one else can—” he stopped.
“That won’t be strong enough for that big pot, darling, put some more in,” she said to him briskly, as an aside, and then to Siger, she said, “Sigs, darling, do you think you could chop this up?” She flicked the water off the parsley into the sink and reached up to a shelf in the wooden beam above her head for a big double-handled herb chopper. Mycroft absently handed her a tea towel from a rail next to him and she wiped the chopper blade briefly before then handing that to Siger as he came over to the sink to wash his hands. Neither she, nor anyone else present, paid any attention at all to Sherlock’s request for a murder; making John smile to himself at the gloriously oiled workings of the Holmes family mechanics. How nothing like his own they were, he thought…and thank God for that.
John squeezed his hand. It fitted firm against his own like their two hands were made to fit together. 'You and me against the world,' thought John, and now he really smiled, because Sherlock, who was still watching him, smiled back and asked, “Now what?”
"I think it's just a muscle and joint strain to the spinal joints of your upper back and the base of your neck, and some minor abrasions, here and here," John said. As he said the words,
"This is the picture," said Sherlock, holding the oil painting up high against the wall and then moving to stand over to one side, so that John could see it.
a first!
“Oh,” said Sherlock. He thought about it for moment and turned back to his laptop.
…To hear Sherlock moaning and gasping John’s name as John worked on his neck with everything he had to offer, moved his hand and and fist and fingers on Sherlock’s cock, delved deeper into Sherlock’s expensive underwear and then with both hands, pulled them down further over his lean hips to cup and squeeze and then stroke his bollocks lightly, as John liked to be stroked. Sherlock’s hot gasped reply as John murmured his name into his ear - and oh,
to all of it.” Mycroft glanced up at him. He had one arm up behind and under his head, his face was flushed, his hair in disarray of its normally neat swept up and over manner, and as Mycroft watched, Greg brought his other hand up and scrubbed through his already wild hair, his eyes closed, his mouth slightly open.
“Well, I thought you’d appreciate some nice scoff after you’d been painting outside in the cold all day,” Clarissa replied.
Grieving for Sherlock's death and for his loss all over again, because until now he had never been able to really let that grief out. He could

Sherlock took this in. He wasn’t sure that John was ready to do it himself yet, so he did it for him. He kept his eyes on John's and reached down slowly and deliberately. John moved away slightly to let him do it, as Sherlock unbuttoned his own trousers and then undid his flies. The sound of his zip was loud in the near silence of their breathing.
why Sherlock didn’t want to repeat Alex Burson's words, you could say he had pushed Sherlock to it. Mainly in retaliation for the eyes in the cup at 6 a.m. So; true, fair enough, he had
Mycroft’s insides, usually so sturdy and resilient, whirled and spun again. “Constantine’s for breakfast?” he murmured demurely, displaying nothing of this continuing inner acrobatics apart from the answering smile growing on his lips.
…one night stands….Y'know? Last night was—I don’t want a…a quick one off, I mean. I wanna…I wanna see you again.”
“Hey, I forgot the—what are you up to?” asked John, coming back into the flat abruptly, and belatedly realising from the sudden flurry of movement at the table in the sitting room that he had just caught Sherlock doing something that he didn't want to be caught doing. “What are you doing?” asked John, and he went over to the table, but only to get the shopping list that he’d forgotten. Sherlock stayed seated at the table but he was obviously hiding something underneath it in his lap. John had a horrible idea that he knew what it was. His heart sank. Sherlock had been twitchy since stopping smoking again and John was suspicious. He wasn't a control freak, but if Sherlock was hiding something, John just wanted to know what it was. Both Sherlock’s hands remained discretely hidden, out of sight. John retrieved his list calmly from the other side of the table where he’d left it, without looking at Sherlock, and stood opposite him, folding the piece of paper over to fit it into his wallet.
…" said John to him, very slowly, the threat quite clear in his voice and his stance. He also said very clearly,

said John, jerking back in surprise, and he didn’t know what he had been expecting, but he truly had not been expecting that. He looked at Sherlock, who had his poker player’s face on.

given him the vision to see what Sherlock meant to him.
Eventually they reached the quay again and Gabriella lead them to a narrow little dead-end road, which was off the main footpath alongside it. The road was called Silver Street and her house turned out to be the very last one. It was a white weather-boarded fisherman's cottage, with wisteria growing up and over a tall black metal arch which was positioned over the front gate. The wisteria wasn't in flower, or even in leaf, but John knew what it was. His grandparents had had one growing up the south side of their house, and the main trunk had been as thick as the seven-year-old-John's thigh. He knew a wisteria when he saw one.
He stepped away from the bed to create a bit of space to undress and then he pulled up his undone trousers and pants and smoothly knelt down, first onto one knee and then the other, to untie his shoe laces and then one by one, remove his shoes. This was neatly done and easy enough, but socks were always an issue. One could not stand naked and remove the socks last, it was the most unromantic look that he knew. So, instead, he stood elegantly stork-like and managed to do it with some vague degree of grace, watching Gregory sit on the floor on his heels and watch him back, quite blatantly, as Mycroft then proceeded to remove every thread of his clothing. He slipped his trousers off and folded them loosely, going over to hang them delicately over the top of Greg’s wardrobe door, taking a deep breath before he slid his underpants off with his back to Greg, and then he draped those on top of his trousers, knowing that Greg was getting a full unobstructed view of his backside while he did it. “Cor, but you’ve got
There was a significant-sounding silence. “You did say ‘exactly’ - you did ask me to tell you exactly what he said…what did you expect?” Sherlock asked, slowly.  “And why

have something to do this morning, but as that involved a rather boring Skype video call with the Icelandic P.M. and not Gregory Lestrade, he decided he would reschedule it as soon as he could get to his phone without being obvious.
“Now, please! Do start everyone!” said Lucia as she finally pulled in her chair at the table, adding and pointing, “the little jug there is the pomegranate sauce, don’t forget to drizzle that over your salad!” and then she said, looking at them both, “Now, come on you two, what did you get, John? Agatha?” She flapped her hand excitedly at them before she picked up her knife and fork.

But hearing Sherlock gasp that word like that
"Were you with her long, the girlfriend who taught you how to do massage?" Sherlock reiterated.
…clouding his thought processes; auditory was bad enough, but now visual… and it wouldn't go away. Every time he waved it away, it kept coming back.
Let me make this clear, none of it was me; I owe everything that is cricket-related in this fic to the wonderful Galadriel 1010, who answered all my cricket questions with good humour and loads of obscure references and some brilliant lines of total cricket-gibberish. Agatha wouldn’t have been the same without you, Gala! ❤️
he thought.
It wasn't like he hadn't seen this sort of thing before - it was often used as a ruse by couples who had neglected to buy their tickets before boarding the train, had spotted him coming, and were trying to avoid getting caught and fined a penalty charge - but there was just something very honest and joyful -
that about another man's cock, let alone Sherlock's. Sherlock simply lay there, motionless, watching John devour him visually. And John was suddenly brought to mind of a leopard on a branch, which may or may not know it is beautiful, but all the same, doesn't really care either way as all its attention is focused on its prey. Oh, he can be so graceful, thought John, admiring him, but right now his friend had not so much grace, but a stark demanding beauty, and John burned to look at him, like a moth to the flame.

John peered over at her hands. She was struggling with a tiny cellophane envelope which held a printed slip of paper and a flimsy red piece of film, in the shape of a fish.

“Oh. A dose?" asked John, leaning back against the worktop.
Greg was still laughing, a bit. “No, but seriously, I’d love you to come and watch a game. Sometime. If you want. Casual clothes. Cheering an’ rugby shirt not necessary.” He sipped his coffee, grinning at Mycroft from behind the mug. “No banner either, don’t worry.”
Sherlock didn't return the greeting but said instead, "There's coffee in the kitchen, if you want it."
John did that thing with his face, a kind of frowning and then a pursing of his lips and raising of his eyebrows which meant;
Immediately, the vision of his Gregory on a rugby field -  muddied up, pumped up, kicking a rugby ball straight up between the top H of the field goal posts - sprang delightfully into his mind and glowed there like a shining dream.
But Greg had thought nothing at all of his impulsive swooping kiss and was behaving perfectly normally. He grinned, delighted, at Mycroft. “You’re totally wasted in the British Government...” he remarked, still grinning, squeezing Mycroft’s fingers again.
"Who is Jamie Hinderson?" asked John, absently, deciding that Sherlock didn't need any stitches as it wasn't that serious. He thought that a few steri-strips would do the trick for the deepest part of the wound.
he thought with a deepening horror. He cleared his throat again somewhat desperately. Sherlock frowned and looked at him carefully and John cringed with embarrassment under the sharp scrutiny of his gaze.
What had happened earlier that morning was that John had woken abruptly at 6.02 a.m., to the stench of something obnoxious burning downstairs and had pounded down the staircase in just his pants and skidded into the kitchen; heart in his mouth that something had caught fire…but when he spun round the kitchen doorway and realised the full extent of the situation, his heart dropped safely back down again and he just thought in total resignation,

John just smiled, shaking his head. He liked very much all the good-natured teasing and fun that went on in the Holmes’ family.

Sherlock shook his head and grinned back at him. “John, you are truly full of marvels,” he said sincerely, making John feel all warm inside.
at the end of that sentence caught in his throat and he couldn't get it out.
"I'm not. It's just..." What was it exactly?
“Really not necessary,” insisted Agatha, holding up her own free hand to stop him. “You just have to know how to handle the little blighters! Besides, they know me, they don't know you…” she finished the sherry in one last swallow and put the glass down firmly, pushing it back from the table’s edge with finality. “…I’ve got a technique! I just bundle them up in a towel, give 'em the drops and then stuff a couple of peeled prawns into 'em for their after-drop treat. Jilly’s told me where her prawns are. I’ll be
Captain John Watson, of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers, a veteran of three years in Afghanistan, of Kandahar, Helmand and of Bart’s bloody hospital, stood in the doorway and snorted at this, but he didn’t move. Then he lifted his own chin in defiance and stood up straighter. “Why?” he said roughly, frowning with the smile still on his face, and crossed his arms again, though the mood this time he did it was distinctly different.  “What ya gonna do if I don’t?” he asked in a gruff confrontational voice. He knew how much Sherlock loved this sort of stuff.
But Greg was simply relieved. “You don’t...ahh...

amiss here.
he almost moaned in fervent agreement.
The wine flowed and the food was, as ever at Constantine’s, fantastic. Their conversation was natural and easy, and towards the end of the main course, Greg’s began to grow gradually what could only be described as slightly more…
So. Then, there followed nearly two years out in the field, under Mycroft, under other orders - alongside others and on his own - seeking them all out. Sometimes he won, sometimes he lost, but he never

in that coat, you great idiot,' and then he baulked at the errant thought that had come into his head. He froze, eyes a bit wide.
He was right though, they didn't talk about it. Sherlock didn't mention it when he came home and neither did John. It was as if it had never happened.
“I don’t know,” said Sherlock, busy typing. “Apparently not.”
note’s
Never, never, never again, he thought afterwards.
Sherlock looked back at him standing there and, just as John had intended, he read John's intentions instantly in his eyes and his body language and the look on his face.
And John had barked out a shout of laughter, scandalised, and exclaimed, "No
Things had been very bad between John and Mary since Sherlock's plane turned around in the sky and came back to touch down again on the runway. When Sherlock had got off the plane and stepped back down onto the tarmac, John remembered then, as he came striding back towards them, that Mary had let go of his hand. Perhaps she had known then that she couldn't possibly compete, and that was when the clock had really started ticking.
Lucia was by then emptying her peelings into a green compost caddy on the kitchen worktop. As she brushed the last bits off her hands, she glanced at him and said casually, “You took your time…!”
All three sat in stunned admiring silence until John smiled and said, "See what I mean?" He knew he sounded proud of Sherlock, he couldn’t help it; he was.
“A rather long story,” replied Sherlock, smiling back at her and sitting back down in his armchair again. John followed suit. The cushions on the sofa were feather-filled, ancient and very soft. He sank down gratefully. Sherlock very briefly explained that they knew Nicolette the gallery owner, who had asked them to locate her artist and the missing pictures, and how they had done so, but he kept his explanation very short and to the point. Clarissa’s manner seemed to change as she listened, and John noticed a slight hardening of her face and a subtle change in her previously very open body language.
Greg smiled. “Oh, I’ve got plenty to offer yer, Mycroft, but what’d yer like to drink?”
"Good," said John with disgust, rubbing his head. There was a lump the size of an egg rising behind his ear. He resisted the urge to kick the bloke in the other knee for balance and/or good measure. The man's injured knee was swelling already, John could see it through the material of his jeans. Incapacitated, then, that was enough. "It's just your kneecap that's dislocated, stop making such a fuss," said John. He stood up, carefully, and got out his mobile, scrolling through his contacts till he reached Greg Lestrade. He clicked on 'call' and then he heard Sherlock call out his name from across the car-park. He had appeared at the opposite wall and John could see he was holding someone by one shoulder, frog-marching them ahead of him. Sherlock's captive had a very bloody nose and was staggering a bit. "John! Are you alright?" Sherlock called.
he thought. But it would have been far quicker to just run upstairs and grab his phone from where it was charging on his old bedside table. He shook his head at himself in disdain. However, as he picked up the elusive calculator, the large wad of police reports started to slide out of his hand. He managed to hang onto those - and the calculator, just - but the folded sheet of A4 he’d balanced on top of the police papers dropped to the floor, and it opened up a bit when it landed.
Instead of answering, Sherlock turned his head a fraction and shot a glance up from under his eyebrows to look at John, who was still reading, oblivious to the heated discussion going on in Sherlock's head. John's face had a mind of its own as he sat reading, and as he watched John, Sherlock's heart did that odd, single, strong, hard beat again. And then he was more honest with himself than he had ever been in his whole life, and he answered. ’I don't correct them about John and I because I wish it were true,’ he thought. And
When Greg stood up and slipped his suit jacket on, he never took his eyes from Mycroft. Mycroft tried not to notice as he tucked his gold card back into his wallet, but he glowed under Greg's gaze. Greg noticed
Too late, indeed. Sally’s sharp eyes had drifted southwards. “Mmm. Doesn’t
"No, here, had one of those big boats with sails,  moored on some estuary somewhere in—"
Greg made a sound in response that caused Mycroft’s insides to tighten. Then he growled,
"Oh, right, I see,” said John, vaguely, thinking, 'And you wanted to play in it just before you brought me up here. Why was that?' He didn't ask though.
he moaned brokenly, as Mycroft warmed up, approaching the task with great relish.
They had to change trains once, but by lunchtime, they reached Burnham-on-Crouch; a small, pretty coastal town on the edge of an estuary that time forgot. They got off the train and began to walk. It was lovely - and just as John remembered it. It was quiet and interesting, full of old buildings and white, weather-boarded fisherman's cottages. Sherlock said nothing whilst John admired the scenery and the architecture. John knew this area vaguely well, thanks to the ex-girlfriend, and he began to relay an anecdote back to Sherlock that she had told him, about the history of the village (and one pub in particular) which had been an infamous smugglers’ meeting point, until Sherlock snapped at him about his historical knowledge being wildly inaccurate and so John, finally really pissed off with Sherlock, just shut up and fumed silently.
he said sincerely, when he could speak.“I…I like that. I didn't know I would, but…I
John was quite incapable of replying, just at that moment. He had heard the phrase before, 'the mind boggles' and he suddenly realised that his face must now be making a rather perfect illustration for that very phrase. The perpetrator of the crime, Alex Burson, was a coarse, gruff-voiced, sixty-six-year-old cockney; built like the proverbial small brick house and born and bred in the East End of London where he had lived all his life. He actually quite sounded like the actor Ray Winstone in character, at his most threatening, perhaps also whilst having a really bad day and maybe immediately after realising that he’d just run out of his favourite full-tar fags. He did not sound
- but, he thought, on another completely different track, he was at the same time marvelling over how often Gregory had managed to surprise him over and over again this evening. He felt taken out of himself, like he had earlier in the restaurant; once again released from having to be the person that he always had to be. It was so exhilarating, this freedom.
John pulled a face to himself, wondering how many times now they had had a cryptic exchange like that one, and followed him up.
John looked up at Sherlock, and took a deep breath and asked him again, quietly but more clearly, "Do you know why I was…
Greg grinned. “I said it ‘adn’t finished yet…but that it’s been bloody amazin’ so far…”
"My name is Sherlock Holmes and this is Dr. John Watson," Sherlock supplied formally, his voice soft and persuasive, “and—”
but orderly, somehow, with the same bare walls and plain furnishings. It wasn’t. It
"He didn't want to murder me, John, just rough me up a bit and threaten me. He knew straight away I wasn't who I'd said I was, but of course he didn't let on. He thought I was a private investigator. He said he was going to 'throw me in the freezer to teach me a lesson'...The
looked. They were so close physically - staring into each other's eyes, Sherlock seated, John leaning over him holding his face, and John could feel his heart begin to beat quite hard and this was suddenly no longer a professional medical inspection of an injured patient, it had become something different. An awkward moment where they were on the very edge of...something else. But John was a professional and not knowing quite how to handle what was happening, he turned to what he knew best. Safest. Not handling it at all. "Your eyes are fine, the pupils are normal," said John, letting go of Sherlock's chin and standing up straight again. His fingers tingled where they had touched Sherlock's face and he rubbed them lightly together out of Sherlock's sight.
"Stuffed to the gunnels" means "really full". 😬 I love these.
When he had got home, John had asked, "Anything happening at the station?" And Sherlock had thought of the exchanges with Donovan and Anderson, and knew John would appreciate what he had said to shut her up and so he had told John the story.
have admitted to a soul how he felt about Sherlock, before or even after it was too late; even after Sherlock had died on the pavement before him and John had thought that he was gone and lost to him forever. Not admitted it to his bereavement counsellor; not to Ella, his therapist; not to himself, and now, here was Sherlock
It was over-whelming and terrifying. And a part of him was also vaguely aware that they were right in front of the window. But then Sherlock brought his hand up from John's neck to the side of John's face, and slid his fingers round and spread them in John's hair, the ball of his thumb cupping soft on the angle of John's jaw, and he leaned forward and down to John and John could have no doubt about his friend's intentions.
They couldn’t hear Lucia’s reply, as she spoke quite quietly, but as Agatha was getting closer, they certainly heard hers.
"Oh, wow," said John in admiration, and stepped backwards in order to be able to view it properly. "Excellent birds!" He liked the way the artist had depicted the beautiful birds, their wings spread delicately in flight and reflected in the mirror-smooth surface of the water below them.
…stop fantasisin’
It was
“Yeah, I know. Good, unnit?” remarked Greg, smiling saucily.
Sherlock brought the paper up again and turned his mind outward for further proof. He thought about how so often people looked at Sherlock and John, saw their close proximity, saw their body language, saw the way they looked at each other and then assumed that they were a couple. Assumed they were
‘Alright then,’ he thought. ‘What shirts have I got clean?’
Mycroft could not answer that - not with Gregory Lestrade undoing his belt in this darkened, moonlit bedroom. He couldn’t think of anything to say but
“Yeah, good, thanks! Your family are so lovely,” he said, taking a different one from the first.
“Ahh…in that case,” he said quickly, just as Greg was leaning over for the mug, “you’ll find three Marlboro Red in the pocket of my overcoat downstairs…” He sat back and waited.

hidden the iron in the top of the broom cupboard after all." Sherlock briefly made a world-recognised 'fist of triumph' gesture and shook it in the air in front of his chest. "I knew it," he said smugly. "Of course it was him.
” he said, delighted.
he thought. “Just M, now, is it?” he called casually after Greg, “No I-5 or I-6?” He took a neat bite of the toast.
alright, and he licked his lips. “I’ll get the taxi,” he said and he went to the bar to order one.
she barked at them. John could hardly believe his eyes. He spluttered a bit with laughter until Mycroft and Sherlock both turned to glare at him - whereupon he struggled to control it. He felt like he was back at school.
A waitress appeared at their table. “Good evening, gentlemen,” she murmured pleasantly, politely handing them the menus and the wine list. She went through the specials on the tiny, ornate, hand-held blackboard, and then left them in peace to make their choices.
Sherlock didn’t answer but he shoved his chair back a bit harshly (to show his irritation at Mycroft getting one over at him, John thought, perceptively), and then he stalked over to the fridge to get the milk.
“Fine,” he responded dismissively. That would have been it, but John saw the elaborated pointing gesture that Siger performed discreetly behind Agatha’s back which prompted Sherlock to ask, “Yourself?”
“What are you saying, Gregory?” Mycroft asked, pink cheeked, het up, more gloriously dishevelled than Greg had ever seen him.
you busy this mornin’?” he asked hesitantly.
Sherlock turned to look at him fully and started to unwind his scarf. “Not really, if you shorten them to Gab and Gabe,” he replied. “Then they sound quite different.” He dropped his scarf on his lap and took his gloves off too.
I said to her,

It was
“Yah,” she replied and she brought it into his office. Mycroft made no move to take it so she deposited it on his desk. “Hand delivered,” she added, mysteriously, as she put it down. Mycroft glanced at it in consternation. Plain business style white envelope, no cellophane window, rather cheap stationery, his full name hand-written in a hand that he didn't recognise, right-handed writer, in a rush, black Bic biro, the word
He scrambled back up the decadently-trashed bed to kiss Greg, draping his body over Greg’s again, one knee bent up to support his weight and up high on his forearms, so that Greg could breathe. From this perfect vantage point, he bent his head lightly kissed him hello.
“I’d imagine so. It certainly looks it!” said Mycroft, as Greg stuck the cigarette back in his mouth and returned to briskly rubbing both his arms at once, trying pretty ineffectively to keep himself warm whilst also keeping most the smoke going outside. Unfortunately, the smoke was having other ideas. “Bloody hell,” muttered Greg in irritation, and he opened up the balcony door fully and stepped out onto the balcony.
Oh yes!' thought John wildly, 'Oh my God,
“Ha ha ha,” spat Sherlock, deadpan, “Gosh, and how very droll you are, Mycroft!" he muttered, and he shook his head at his brother witheringly, pulling up his lip in a perfect imitation of said small child’s unpleasant sneer.
“Where's the nearest hospital with an A&E?" snapped John.

"Handle it?" offered Sherlock, placidly, not moving.
he said through his laughter.
“Who calls their twins Gabriel and Gabriella anyway?" he remarked.

And he knew that look.

"Sit down, sit down," instructed Gabriella, pulling off and discarding the artist's smock and her battered jacket untidily onto the back of a faded dark red leather armchair. She went through a doorway to a small kitchen. Sherlock sat down on the armchair and John chose one side of an equally aged but mismatched sofa next to twin bookcases.
asked John, intrigued, hoping for a childhood story. He knew so little about Sherlock’s childhood.
said Greg seriously, eyes widening, and Mycroft laughed. He had to get him back somehow. Greg couldn’t make all the jokes.

like some people had said about him. It was not that mundane or clumsy - it was so often much more explosive than that. As if he'd almost seen it all along, but had just been looking at it from slightly the wrong angle, or it had been there but been blurred, and then suddenly something changed in a burst of high frequency energy and he had just
how to handle it.
Having completed his own helping duty by that time, Mycroft hung the damp tea towel neatly over the rail on the Aga to dry and took the opportunity to disappear wordlessly from the room.

smiled.
That was most odd of him to say that word in that context, and he had said it without really thinking. It was the sort of comment John made; that he said he "loved" something to mean he really enjoyed it, or liked it immensely, or relished it. Maybe it was simply too much time spent with John and he was picking up on these slang 'John-isms'.
Mycroft could see what was going on here and he chose to rise above it. "As far as I am currently aware, all is well at home and Her Majesty is presently enjoying the delights of her Sandringham estate." Then he raised his eyebrows in an expression that clearly read,
He didn't answer, but immediately held out his open palm defiantly to John.
It didn’t change the fact that he still wanted to kill him for daring to do it though.
And that ‘yes’ had been hot and instant and absolutely whole-hearted.
And John found he needed to start to do it. His gaze fixed on Sherlock’s face and then he moved towards Sherlock suddenly, who stepped towards him and now neither of them looked away.
'Bad?' John mouthed at Sherlock, over his captive's bowed head.
Answer:
he asked, uncertainly.
to you?” John persisted.
Sherlock had watched John grow paler and paler and though he didn't ask if John was alright, he said immediately,   "Good idea. I think I might go and lie down too." He watched John as he said it.
~~~~~
and Sherlock’s clear and unwavering look answered him.
"Move over," said Sherlock quietly, like this was the most normal thing in the world.
I want…I wanna do that to you, the neck thing,” he said, breathlessly.
Sherlock was, as always, enamoured by this thing that John did that he’d only very rarely seen directed at him until they finally got together. Flirtatious John certainly showed his tongue at lot. He tended to lick his lips when he was nervous or apprehensive, but he also tended to do it when he was flirting. Sometimes Sherlock still couldn’t believe his luck at fully being on the receiving end of this at long last.
There was a general consensus of agreement from some and a total blank and slightly horrified silence from others. John had never expected anything less.
Greg smiled, the lines on his face deepening attractively. His eyes were very warm. “Well. I suppose we do,” he agreed. The smile never left his face. He looked down at the thick cream-coloured menu before him, still smiling. “Are we going for starters as well, then, or straight to the main?” he asked, running a finger down the list of dishes as he scanned them; rather charmingly, Mycroft thought. “When I came with Zac we had the duck for starters,” Greg continued, musingly, “but it was so fantastic I wished I’d ‘ad it as my main course…” but Mycroft’s attention had caught unpleasantly on the male name in that sentence.
John snorted. As he turned away to go and put the kettle on, he grinned and threw back over his shoulder, “Well, at least if you put that, he’ll know
he exclaimed, mortified, putting the glass down quickly further back from Mycroft and instantaneously finding the washing up sponge was the closest. He snatched it up and let go of Mycroft, veering away from him to perform the rescue operation. He quickly scooped up the little stream and wiped around the puddle, glancing down in dismay at Mycroft’s trousers. “Oh Jesus, Mycroft, I’m really sorry!” he said. “Let me get you something to put on it, I’ve got some—” he leaned to the side to toss the saturated washing up sponge into the sink.
John almost yelled from the doorway, still catching his breath, adrenaline pumping, as Sherlock stood ineffectively waving the folded newspaper at the smoke alarm, pre-empting its pending decision to possibly start alarming, but half-heartedly, knowing it only would if it thought it really needed to. And ok, there wasn't really that much actual smoke for it to get upset about anyway, true, but the stench was indescribable. Sherlock did not so much as bat an eyelid at John’s chaotic appearance. “Just conducting an experiment on how high temperatures affect the cornea,” he supplied breezily. “Been thinking about the effects of exposure to extreme heat on the human body. However, I do think I may have slightly overdone the temperature/length of heat exposure ratio.” He swirled over to the microwave.
"Alex Burson, at the end, what did he say to you? I missed most of it because I was trying to keep the daughter-in-law talking downstairs in the garage while we waited for Lestrade."
"Er, yes, lovely, thanks, Mr. Holmes," replied John after just the smallest of pauses, dropping his overnight bag against the wall in the hallway.
he said softly, mostly to himself.
Sherlock lifted a hand in farewell as he passed through the archway front gate and he said it once, but was not nearly as effusive in saying his goodbyes as John was.
At that moment, Sherlock leaned backwards subtly behind her line of sight, looking at John and meaning to catch John's eye with his movement. He succeeded and they exchanged a significant look. Sherlock was making sure John had seen and acknowledged the similarity of style.
It was too much. It was not enough.
previously, the man she had secretly forgiven, been meeting up with when John was at work, and the man whose baby she said she now carried. And as she had walked down the steps of their building to the taxi waiting outside, she had turned back and said, "I can't be Sherlock for you, John, I can never be Sherlock…so maybe it’s just as well…” She still had tears on her face. He shouted furiously that he didn't know what she meant by that and he went after her and grabbed her arm to stop her and asked her what the fuck she was talking about.
“I see. But…if you don’t actively dislike being called ‘Gregory’, then may I call you that?” Mycroft seemed unusually unsure of himself.

Of course it wouldn't go away, because his helpful subconscious was trying to tell him something.
I’d love to go.
At the centre of his anger, there was grief, but amongst all of the negative, toxic emotions he was feeling, he was relieved. He was relieved that he was free.
"Thank you," the artist responded shortly but didn’t move to carry on.  Everything in her manner said,
"Oh, she's absolutely hilarious, John," interjected Mrs. Holmes, "she's
When he had grasped Sherlock's shirt, one of his top buttons had surrendered and popped open. As he had taken Sherlock over to the wall, a second button near the top had followed the first, so Sherlock's shirt was hanging slightly open already. John looked at the pale skin, newly exposed at Sherlock's chest. The sight of it made his heart pound. Oh, yes, this was different; different from anything else John had ever done, but that didn't mean he didn't want to do it.
Later on it veers away from canon…but before (and while) it does, it gets very angsty. It will all end well though, however, I totally promise you that!! ❤️
By now John was fairly close to a minor paroxysm of frustration. He banged his hand a little on the desk. “Oh, for God’s—
"You most certainly are not," Sherlock said and John could hear in his voice that he had smiled too. There was a pause. Then Sherlock added, in a contemplative tone, "That's far more true than you realise, John."
Mycroft drew in breath softly at the sight of him concentrating on the task in hand, not realising how the moonlight lit up his features so strikingly. His hair was dark silver in the darkness, bright silver in the moonlight; he glanced up at Mycroft at the sound of his gasp, and
had the calculator? Where the sod is it?!”
He was so astonishingly right that John's indignant anger was almost obliterated. Almost. He offered no praise for that deduction though, and he crossed his arms without realising he'd done it.
"Passionate," he said suddenly, in a soft expressionless voice, making Agatha chuckle and Mycroft snort.
John was annoyed that Sherlock had been so insistent that he didn't need John for this one, as he had said he was only going to scout the place out and not put himself at risk, but then he had come back looking like a Christmas turkey. "That's why you need back-up if you're going to risk being carved up like a—” he started, but he stopped himself. John was angry, but he also realised that talk wasn't getting this wound sorted out, and anyway, anger wasn't conducive to good health care. Or a good repair, in this case. He took a deep breath and expelled some air out forcefully through his nose. "Oh, let me get my kit," he said. He went and got his kit and some gloves.
thought Greg, still holding the piece of paper in his hand. He swallowed.
"Why don't
gasped Sherlock.
“What did it say?” demanded Greg. Despite the situation, a newly-awakened part of Mycroft’s mind was finding Gregory’s Detective Inspector’s interrogation…
John’s frown deepened.
Greg had got the cap off. “Alright, MI5,” he grinned, “I can see
“Well, look, I’ll go out on the balcony so I don’t make everything stink a’ smoke - especially your stuff.”
Agatha had filled the kettle, switched it on and was noisily selecting mugs. “Who wants tea?” she asked the room in general. All those in favour said aye, and as she gathered mugs and then milk from the fridge she remarked, “Siggy-darling, what are you looking at on your phone? Not golf again?”
(N.B.: The book is also called ‘Maurice’, like the film and it was written by E. M. Forster. We (in the U.K.) pronounce Maurice like "Morris", just so you know! :)
“Funny, isn’t it,” said John thoughtfully, looking down at her elegant artistic writing, wondering why she had underlined that one word. “Fancy calling your twin children such similar names…I mean, ‘Gabriel and Garbriella.’ So eccentric. Can you imagine calling them for dinner? Must have been confusing.” But he wasn’t really thinking about their names, it was the first two lines of her message that had really set him thinking the most.
, I mean, not to actually go up there on the stage…” he paused, then said, “…but if yer did, then God forbid anyone who tried to heckle you! You could just look down your nose at them silently with those incredible laser beam eyes of yours and they’d shrivel up at yer feet.
…So it’s important because there's something about it I need to know…
And then, soon after he had had that dream, Mary had started work at the surgery.
The walk apparently took 35 minutes from start to shed and early on John realised that Sherlock was going to stay moodily silent the whole way. John didn't care. He found he was really enjoying the beautiful scenery and the fresh sea air;  the calling of sea birds and the crisp, bright winter's day were like a balm to his city-worn soul. Early January was usually a bit depressing outdoors, but today it was wonderful. He felt on top of the world.

In his bedroom, John turned to face his friend. The look on John’s face read,
want to know for the blog, but I wanted to get you back and I thought I’d do it by making you have to say something you didn’t want to,” John replied helplessly.
No angst in this one. :)
Mycroft Holmes, who claimed to play only a minor role in the British Government, gasped and practically shivered at the sensation of this man’s hot breath on his skin, his hand on his hip, moving down lower on his behind. He made a tiny sound of surprise that this would be all it took to bring him down. He swallowed hard again. He had to try to regain

because there was no obvious sign of trauma on the unmarked body.
“Ooh, ooh, Sherlock!” she called excitedly from her armchair as he went towards the kitchen again fifteen minutes later. “Are you making me another gin and tonic yet?” she said, as he went past her - under instructions to get the second plate of Lucia’s vol-au-vents to pass around. He stopped and looked at her, the first empty plate of canapés still in his hand. “I wasn’t, but I am able to do so…” he said bluntly.
if I smoke?” Greg asked, with sudden realisation that Mycroft might.

“Where do you want these?” he said brusquely, at the very same moment that Mycroft said firmly, “I’ve finished the rosemary…” they both paused for a second, not looking at each other, then obviously thinking along the same lines, they both said quickly, “What’s next?”
“Oh, everything,
“What was that bit about ‘final word’?” asked Clarissa suddenly, frowning.

Agatha looked over at John. “I’m next to you, John!” she announced in great delight, gesturing at him excitedly with her nearly-empty glass. She then finished the G&T in one last big gulp and banged her glass down firmly on the side table beside her.
“What the—
Mycroft really didn’t think he could
Sherlock from now on. And oh, how that realisation had hurt.
She showed them through the narrow hallway into a cluttered but interesting small sitting room, full of unusual textural items like driftwood sculptures connected together in abstract forms with thick black wire, various small sculptures on busy shelves interspersed with books, and on the walls there were various paintings of seascapes and landscapes. There were lots of photographs too, mainly black and white - some large, some small -  and John glanced at some of them quickly, but not for too long; he didn't want to appear nosy. The smell of something bready baking drifted intriguingly and deliciously through from the kitchen. John sniffed the air discreetly but appreciatively. Sherlock glanced around the room, cataloguing stuff, his face blank.
Well. That did it, all right. That was several lines well and truly crossed, right there. And other things. Sherlock continued to look back at John coldly for a long moment, the temperature dropping to below zero, then he sat back in the chair, tossed the paper aside, and spoke.
…to lie down...with me?"
The woman shook her head. “Well done on that one,” she said. “There were plenty of us who were very suspicious about that so-called ‘lucky find’!”
No signature.”
Greg let go of Mycroft’s hand to open the door and as he pushed it fully open and withdrew the key, he stepped inside and said over his shoulder, “Er, excuse the mess, I...er...didn’t plan on...” It was as if he suddenly remembered what state he’d left it in. “When I asked you back, I just thought...” He stopped in the hallway and gestured to an irregularly-shaped wooden board set high up on the wall, lined with assorted wobbly, handmade metal coat hooks, both large and small. It looked like a flat plank cut from extremely long piece of silvery driftwood. “There’s a—if you wanna take your coat off..or your jacket...” he said, walking on past it straight down the short corridor to where Mycroft could see the kitchen at the end, via the low level lights under the wall cabinets that had been left on. Greg threw out an arm to indicate an open door on the left side of the corridor as he passed it. “The lounge is in there,” he said, stopping to reach briefly round the door frame of the room to switch the light on, and then continuing on to the kitchen. “Make yourself at home! I’ll get us that scotch,” he said as he went.
Sherlock paused with his mouth just inches away from John's, and John thought, 'He's waiting for this to be my decision too,' and he flicked a glance from Sherlock's mouth up to his eyes and this time it was he who read Sherlock's mind. He saw the question there in Sherlock's eyes and he knew the answer in his heart instantly.
he indicated where both abrasions were with a light touch close to each. "At least you don't need A&E for this one," he remarked, smiling now.
Sherlock said nothing.
"Where to, Guv?" asked the cabbie innocently.
She smiled. “I don’t mind you asking. You’ll won’t place it, people never do - I moved around the U.K. such a lot as a child, I’m a real mix-bag,” she said, still smiling.
Greg breathed silently into his ear for two soft breaths, his hand now sliding slow over Mycroft’s back and down towards the rounded cheek of his arse. Mycroft waited like a tightly strung bow as Greg’s fingers trailed delicately round the curve of his hip on the way down.
John thought, dreading the rejection to follow.
“Mycroft…” Greg said, “I’m really sorry…I feel a bit…erm….” He looked at Mycroft and pulled a face. “I need a cigarette,” he admitted. “I‘m tryin’ to stop but… I…
John read it, eyes widening too as he did so, and then he looked at Sherlock - there was an expression of stunned pleased amazement on Sherlock’s face, almost identical to the one that he was sure was on his own.
“Oh, do you not? That’s unusual. You usually do," observed Sherlock drily, who, apart from the pink cheeks, was seemingly completely calm and unaffected.
a lot for me recently…” and here he started to smile, “I don’t know if you’ve noticed…?” He gestured pointedly between the two of them.
On the left turn, as their knees pressed together once again with the movement of the cab, Greg found Mycroft’s fingers there instead of the bony prominences of his knee. And so Mycroft's plan worked perfectly. Greg reached down and took hold of the long, elegant fingers, first gently interlacing them with the back of his own, and then lifting them and bringing Mycroft’s hand over to his own knee where he then enfolded Mycroft’s hand in his own in a tight, warm clasp; in the dark secrecy of the cab holding it much more fully than he had at the table in the restaurant.
but then, he had woken up this morning feeling odd. Feeling a sense of achievement, like he did when he'd just worked something out that had been on his mind for a while and he was puzzled as to what it was, but then as he laid in bed, he smelt the coffee which had woken him up, and so he reached for his phone on the bedside table and texted John,
Mycroft could take no more procrastination. “Oh, hang the blasted trousers!” he asserted, and he demonstrated his total disregard in the state of his trousers by pulling Gregory back in and snogging him senseless instead; expensive whisky seeping through to his expensively-clad backside or not.

(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, that's good,” Sherlock replied, his own voice a dark rumble, “because I rather find that I liked doing it to you…” and as he spoke, he went to work on John's ear and neck.
John went and stood behind him and he could see immediately that it was not as bad as it had first seemed. Just a very minor laceration, then, deep at the start but then less so as it went on, becoming more just a deep scratch which petered out to nothing, but it was clean, and should heal well. It did need to be cleaned up and covered properly, but was nothing to be overly concerned about. Hopefully. He put his hand on Sherlock's uninjured right shoulder to steady him before he pressed carefully just above and then just below the wound at the top. The blood was oozing slightly but not pouring, and it had already started to clot.
like Mrs. Lestrade’s handwriting…?” Sally said, thoughtfully, looking down at it pointedly. She raised her eyebrows and looked at him without lifting her head. Greg snatched the envelope and stuffed under the paperwork pile. “Look, haven’t you got work to do?” he shot back, but he was smiling.
do you know?" he persisted, feeling that Sherlock didn't just mean he knew by the physical evidence in and on the book itself that he had just so accurately described.
he thought.
Greg leaned forward and kissed him again as he tossed his own tissue over Mycroft’s shoulder - vaguely towards the basket on the floor, but missing it completely and not caring. “You could never be a wet dishrag - you long, tall hot drink o’ water, you,” he said reassuringly as he moved back to his side of the bed. Mycroft burst out laughing.
“Right at the bottom of the top middle drawer,” came the yawned response, which was the drawer where John currently was. He gave in then and just lifted out the huge sheaf of what turned out to be photocopies of the cold case police reports, which were all stapled together in twos and threes, and then a single sheet of white A4, loosely folded in thirds under them, and finally spied the stupid calculator right at the bottom of it all.
"I'm glad to be here, Mrs. Holmes," he said, and he meant it. She smiled broadly and gave the flowers a deep appreciative sniff. "Oh, please, it's Lucia, John!” she said, “
“I mean…

Over a delicious breakfast of the (very good) granary toast topped with real butter and some wonderful homemade marmalade from Greg’s sister - Greg described this as ‘second breakfast’, seeing as the doughnuts he said counted as the first - Mycroft was thinking vaguely that he should perhaps give notice of his intention to leave soon. Not that he really wanted to, seeing as he was enjoying some small kind of Breakfast Heaven in Greg’s garden right now. It might be the usual tiny London garden, but it was an absolute sun-trap. Plus, a morning spent with Gregory Lestrade doing nothing at all was far preferable to what he
this for quite some time in advance to get a table at Constantine’s the night before St. Valentines day.”
John just watched him, thinking.
Sherlock brought the re-filled pepper grinder to Lucia and went to return the big container to the pantry.
John felt a wave of hot, astonished delight wash over him. So, ok, then; apparently he had the secret ability to make Sherlock Holmes
Gabriella and Clarissa both stood on the doorstep and waved them goodbye as they set off down the path; laden with paintings, scones and - John, at least - full of good cheer. Given the sudden chill turn the evening had taken, John was really grateful for that break in the warm and having had something to eat and drink to tide them over for the journey home.
” she said, as she came over and put it on the table beside him.
But then Sherlock had come back.
was what I meant,” replied Greg between breaths - also apparently having trouble processing - and he pressed his teeth lightly into Mycroft’s shoulder now, swirling his tongue, making Mycroft gasp again. Greg twisted slightly and shifted, pressing his cock more against the crease of Mycroft’s groin on his captured thigh. He moaned a little again from between closed lips in another of those deep rumbling purrs and then he concentrated. “I
Mycroft, all at once, delighted with this new, previously un-deduced knowledge of his lover and amused by Greg’s total understanding and acceptance of the Holmes’ brothers’ trait - one which most people found disturbing and odd - found himself enjoying being ordered about. Very much so, in fact. It seemed he and his brother had more than one thing in common.
he practically shouted. “Because you let me think you were dead and you
He was humiliated, he was angry about what she had done to him, but he was glad…
thought John wildly, and in unison they grinned at each other through the lust and each slid a hand into the top of the other’s underwear.
"I am lucky," Sherlock replied, suddenly. "I am very lucky to have you," he added, suddenly serious, his gaze still directed straight ahead.
The truth is out there.
’ thought John, now understanding the mischievous glint. "You read my books?" he said, somewhat crossly.
"A couple of years ago? Which magazine?" asked Sherlock, like that mattered.
"There, then!" John snarled.
“Well. Cheers!” said Greg quickly to Mycroft, proffering his glass. Mycroft lifted up his own and clinked it.
thought Mycroft in an ardent rush of admiration. Greg folded his trousers over quickly and without ceremony and simply dumped them on the floor. “They can wait…I can’t,” he said with a grin. Then he asked, “You comin’ over?” and he flipped the duvet back off the bed and slid down into it. He arranged himself artistically, lying on his side, up on one elbow, his head resting on one palm and he looked expectantly at Mycroft. “Let’s get warm, then!” he said invitingly, spreading an arm over the empty side of the bed and smoothing the sheet down, and then he grinned again knowingly at the cheesiness of his invitation. But Mycroft just smiled shyly and got into the bed gratefully, feeling very self-conscious, as Greg shifted backwards slightly so that Mycroft had room to lie opposite him.
Mycroft thought, as Greg reached for his hand again across the table.
So John would do what it took to protect Sherlock. And Sherlock knew he would do so again, if necessary. And that was important.
The “Apollo” that Greg refers to is a theatre in Hammersmith, London (it’s actually called The Hammersmith Apollo Theatre, but is known as The Apollo) and they do indeed do a real stand-up night called “Live at the Apollo” which is televised on BBC 2 over here late on Friday nights. It’s absolutely great. I wish Greg would take

she murmured quickly into it, making him literally burst out laughing.  Sherlock looked at him sharply and frowned - while also managing to raise an inquiring eyebrow at the same time. John shook his head at him, still grinning, and, on looking in his own cracker, he discovered that he had a red paper hat and a tiny nail file. ‘Mmm. Maybe could come in useful as a concealed weapon?’ he thought wryly, laying it on the table and looking around as he put his hat on to see what everyone else had got. His wasn't really a great prize and cracker-prize envy had been a very real thing amongst his sister and cousins when John was growing up.
mind before to interfere, but…things have
“Mmm,” said Sherlock, neutrally, his eyes never leaving the screen. Then he added dismissively, not looking at John, “Well, that thing you’ll find on the bed, then, that’s not from me.”
He blinked. He looked at Sherlock standing silhouetted in the sunlight at the window, and as Sherlock turned his head away suddenly to look out at the street again, John saw the top of the white dressing covering his knife wound above the open neck of his pyjama top. Unlike the head-chef's knife wound months ago, this one
he murmured harshly, as Greg’s slowly thrusting movements picked up pace.
In case you're not a native-English speaker, the line "[to add] some fuel on the fire" when speaking about a person or situation means to aggravate the situation or to make it worse. In this case, John is teasing Sherlock about being wrong because he knows it will annoy him, hence the next thing I was going to put here in my little notes; "to get a rise out of [someone]"...is to deliberately annoy them for comic effect. (He really takes himself very seriously sometimes. John occasionally likes to work on this.)
Relieved, Mycroft smiled warmly back at his relaxed posture and said with some relief, “Good morning…” He wasn’t quite sure what to say next.
He held out his hand to for her to shake before she could reach him, far away from his body at the end of a rather rigid arm - in effect, a warding off handshake rather than a welcoming one; the length of his straight arm quite effectively holding her back. Undeterred, she grasped his hand in both of hers like she had John’s and shook it vigorously. “

moment about using the ensuite bathroom, they ended up back on and then in Greg’s bed, first both wearing Greg’s bathrobes and then both not.
“In fact,” Sherlock continued, “about that…I’m expecting a happy announcement any time now,” and he glanced back down at his phone screen again as if expecting it to arrive there and then.
Lucia stopped for a moment and turned to face him. “No, no, John, you’re absolutely fine as you are! I just really want to get changed out of my cooking clothes. I smell of that bloody goose fat and I’m covered in gravy spots!”
But then, there was a fly in the ointment of all that was
Sherlock was recalcitrant about the crackers. “Oh, whoopee, more miniature plastic nail clippers and another magic ring puzzle," said Sherlock acidly, without moving. “Can’t wait to find out what I get this time…”
John kept his eyes on his carrots, but could not stop the smile from rising to his face. This scene was like a comedy sketch.
Well! It's taken me over a year (15 months!!!) to write and publish this. Must be some kind of record? It is 5k+ words of Mystrade morning-after fun though, so hey! Enjoy! ☺️
'Not interested in what they think in their tiny little minds,' replied Sherlock. 'Don't care.'
"               I     love                 you, John,"
“She’s been upstairs on our bed again, Siggy!” announced Lucia with a firm look in his direction, and then turned back to John. “Jilly next-door adopted her from the Cat Rescue, but she didn’t get on with her two, so we’ve taken her in,” she said, by way of explanation. She got up from the table to make more tea.
In that case, maybe he did know which was worse.
“Oh good, then that means I can show you
But they were still kissing each other, with no sign of it stopping, so yes, clearly it was.
‘Did the man ever stop flirting?’ thought Mycroft, delighted. He thought he might be grinning again, but even knowing that, he didn't feel inclined to stop. This was

barked his mind, quickly. But John knew what would help Sherlock's neck.
“Yes, thank you. I’m gasping,” said Sherlock, rather dramatically.
“No. I don’t,” she said with finality, and John thought with some amusement, ‘Well! That was
but it was nothing compared to the joy, the blinding joy of
No, John thought, relieved, well, maybe this was going to be fine after all...who knew, maybe it would even be more than fine.
Greg gripped Mycroft’s hand and with it, he pulled himself up lightly up to stand. Then he let go of it and instead brought his own hand up to Mycroft’s right shoulder, sliding it up to his neck as he leaned in slowly to kiss him. Greg’s other hand came up to rest on the front of Mycroft’s left shoulder, from there sliding down Mycroft’s chest, over his waistcoat, and down to the buttons at the front. He kissed Mycroft as he carefully unbuttoned each one one-handed, and as he opened the garment, he marvelled at the dove grey silk lining that was revealed, the inner material matching the waistcoat’s back panel.
been in the middle of a deeply private conversation before Sherlock burst in. If so, then, John wondered, who could it have been with to make him look so flushed. He didn’t think he’d ever seen that expression on Mycroft’s face before. Maybe he’d been texting someone.
Gabe.”
“No expense spared, then?” said Mycroft, sipping his coffee.
"Oh...erm...I didn't mean...I didn't mean..." John couldn't form the words. "I didn't mean, I
“Listen, I really wanna come now. But I want us ter finish at the same time,” Greg said abruptly, his fingers stroking lightly on Mycroft’s lower back.
And then he thought, ‘Actually, it's more than remarkable...it's
like Gabriel Peters. She’s blatantly copying his style!’
The force of it sent a jolt of desire straight to John's stomach. Sherlock kept his hold on John's arm, but he began to rise to stand up. John loosened his own hold on Sherlock's shoulders and let go of him, dropping his hands to his sides while Sherlock turned elegantly as he rose to face John, still looking at him, smoothly shoving the chair that stood between them to one side, out of the way, with his leg and with his other hand; sliding his right hand up over John's rolled up shirt sleeve, and up to grip his upper arm. Now Sherlock stood in front of John, face to face. He had kept his hold on John's arm throughout the whole movement of getting up, and he had also held John's gaze just as firmly. He moved his right hand further up to John's shoulder, then up to the collar of his shirt and his fingers made contact with John's neck, while John stood rooted to the spot, his scalp tingling, his heart pounding, neurons firing off in all directions, and he was thinking wildly, ‘Oh my God Sherlock, really?
“Goose, John! I hope that’s ok with you?” said Lucia, who had come back to the table with a sponge in her hand to wipe the surface where she had been working. She stopped mid-wipe, appearing momentarily concerned. “Sherlock didn’t say you had any dietary requirements?” she added hopefully, looking suddenly like she had just realised she’d completely forgotten to ask.
Earlier in the week, Sherlock had been bored and at John's suggestion, he had gone in desperation to Lestrade, to ask for some cold cases to occupy him.  Sherlock had been going up in the lift on the way to Lestrade’s office, and the lift doors had opened and in had got Anderson. Sherlock had looked him up and down and noticed things but said nothing. Anderson glared back at him, red-faced, bristling and waiting for Sherlock to speak, but Sherlock didn't bite. In the end he raised his eyebrow and said coldly, "Something wrong, Anderson?"
he breathed dramatically, making the word sound as suggestive as humanly possible.

he exclaimed, giving in to it completely, his hand stilled for a moment, his eyes closed in rapture, and as he utterly gave himself over to the incredible sensation, he heard his lover murmur,
to the dry cleaners. They wanted to check with the police to see if it was stolen and I had mugged someone for it." He had held the ice pack away from the side of his head briefly to speak, because holding it in place over the bruise and cut that was there was impairing his ability to submit John to the full blast of his icy stare. Then he realised that having to admit now how he had avoided bleeding on his coat - that he had actually carried his coat home to avoid this from happening - didn't go quite so well with the icy stare, so looking rather more demure, he re-applied the ice pack, and said defensively, "No, I...I carried it."
“But…ok, but what did he say?" asked John, surprised, because Sherlock didn't usually pass up any excuse to shine his brilliant deductive light in John’s general direction. Sherlock didn’t seem too keen on telling him exactly what had happened, for some strange reason. "Oh, he was very erudite - he largely just swore copiously,” replied Sherlock after a moment, in a flippant, sarcastic tone, now folding the paper back and scanning the inside front page. John waited for more but it was clear Sherlock had finished speaking.
Siger came out of the pantry then with the ground almonds and awkwardly clutching some other packages of dried fruit and nuts - along with his phone, which he was looking at again. “Temperature’s dropping!” he said cheerfully, now glancing over to peer out of the window and check the slightly leaden sky as he brought the packages over to the table. As John and Sherlock turned and left the room, John heard Lucia say crossly to Siger, “Do put your phone away, darling! I need your
“Yes,” whispered back Mycroft, quite still too, on tenterhooks to hear what he knew Greg was going to say.
“Sherlock, I love it, thank you,” replied John sincerely, and he put one hand onto to Sherlock’s shoulder and leant down to kiss him. “Almost as much as I love you,” he added when they separated.
The man just doesn’t care, thought Mycroft, he’s a law unto himself. He couldn’t stop smiling from the unbridled joy that this thought brought him.
He nearly opened his mouth to speak, to ask if Sherlock was sure about this before it was too late, and before they would never be able to calmly go back to how blind they had both been, but as he looked openly back at John, Sherlock thought,
It might be February but phew...is it just me or is it getting hot in here? ;)
like is standing right in front of me...” Mycroft sipped his own scotch slowly, using the glass to cover his mouth after he had spoken words he could hardly believe he was able to say. As he lowered the glass again, he licked his lips discretely, feeling the sweet burn of the whisky pass down his throat. He didn’t even realise he was doing it until it was done, but he had mirrored Greg’s stance in a postural echo, leaning back slightly against the worktop and crossing his legs at the ankle.
off…” he hadn’t meant it to sound quite so depressing. But Sherlock was sanguine about it.
“Busy,” was all Sherlock said. “Never mind, John, it wasn't urgent, I’ll ask Mrs. H if she can get some from Sainsbury’s when she goes out.” He’d found the coffee and was looking for the scissors in the top drawer to open the packet.
