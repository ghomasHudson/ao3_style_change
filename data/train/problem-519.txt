A small treacherous part of Sherlock’s heart leaps at John’s comment. He was fully expecting John’s usual ‘Not gay.’
Irene gently grasped him by the shoulders and guided him to sit down on the closed toilet. She took up his razor and tilted his head back and drew the razor across his jaw. She moved gently across his face. The familiar pull of the blade was almost hypnotic and Sherlock found himself relaxing into her efficient touch. He came back to himself as Irene wiped the last bits of shaving cream off of his face.
“I suppose I should.” John says. “But I don’t. Even before she shot you, the cracks were showing. Do you remember the morning we found you in the drug den?”
Tignes is a ski resort spread over several small hamlets that mostly consist of hotels. Two artificial lakes dot the barren countryside, the large Lac du Chevril, and the small Lac de Tignes higher up on a plateau-like area surrounded by high, white-tipped peaks. During a previous visit, John learned that the original village of Tignes lies at the bottom of Lac du Chevril. It was submerged in the early 1950s, its inhabitants forced to move away or live in the newly built ski resort, subsequently named ‘Super Tignes’. Situated above the treeline and intensely used for ski-tourism in winter as indicated by many ski-lifts on the hillslopes, in summer the resort looks a little drab, particularly now with most flat areas still covered in slush or thawing sleet, and heavy clouds shrouding the highest peaks. But given the good infrastructure and density of hotels, which mostly come in the form of modernist concrete blocks with local touches such as long balconies or facades covered in wooden cladding, the place is a good choice for a stopover, particularly for the rest day, because it offers plenty of accommodation for the entire Tour caravan, the press and fans, and even visiting families.
“Am I?” Sherlock tucks his nose against John’s neck. He smells John’s soap, the rain, and the tang of sweat from their earlier exertions.
“Your Army doctor is out having his mild sexual identity crisis, but it is a mild crisis, Sherlock. He’s been thinking about the two of you as a couple since our conversation at Battersea.”
“You’ll go.” Sherlock interrupts. “You’ll find another girlfriend and leave me and I can’t…I can’t-”
“Tha-nk yo-ou” Sherlock says and sniffs suspiciously at the drink. He figures it’s unlikely that she would try to poison him with so many witnesses and he takes a cautious sip. Donovan turns to watch the dart game. Lestrade is winning.
“Stay?” Sherlock asks. He knows his voice is small, he feels vulnerable, flayed open. He has handed John his heart and if John chooses, he can crush it.
“What the fuck did you just say?” John is smiling. Sherlock has seen this smile before. It’s a harsh, deadly smile that comes before someone gets hurt.
Sherlock’s relative happiness has come at a brutal cost. John’s wife did not slide into anonymity. Her ties to Moriarty caught up to her at last. She and John’s child paid the ultimate price for that association.
Donovan is the one to deliver Lestrade's round of drinks. As she passes Sherlock his gin and tonic she catches his eye and smiles at him, flicking her eyes to where John is still absentmindedly rubbing Sherlock’s back. Sherlock wonders if it is possible for his face to get any more red. He somehow manages to avoid her gaze and school his face into a neutral mask.
“What on earth are you talking about, Sally?” Sherlock snaps. “He might as well forfeit the game; he’ll never catch up to Lestrade.”
“No, but it’s part of your profession to find out those things. Who are you working for, Miss Adler? Our side (including the Americans) or the Nazis?”
Now and again he still feels the odd craving, despite having stopped smoking over three months ago. Having been forced to stop, more like, on doctor’s orders. In April, after a spring of feverish work due to the capture of a German trawler near the Lofoten Islands which had yielded a complete set of Enigma keys for the month of February, Sherlock contracted pneumonia. Not heeding his body’s warning signs, and continuing to work, at one point he collapsed rather spectacularly while setting out on his bike. Subsequently, he spent two weeks in hospital and two on sick leave at his lodgings, almost too weak to use the stairs, his shoulder aching from where he’d hit the ground. He should have stayed off work longer to recover properly, but he had entreated Dr. Stamford to allow him back as soon as he was (shakily) on his feet again, the boredom of being confined to his small room almost unbearable. But he
She takes another sip of her tea, the hand lifting her cup trembling slightly. John reaches out and places a comforting hand on her shoulder, rubbing it gently. It seems to calm her because Molly draws a deep breath, gives him a quick, grateful smile, and continues,
Jeannine cocks her head. “What kind of thing? Being interested in another human being? Having a friend?”
On the first free page in the notebook, he writes today’s date, the first of September, and makes a sketch of the tyre imprint he has found in the earth next to the road. John comes and hunches down next to him, careful not to disturb the marks. They’re considerably well defined, enough to make out the profile of the tyre, but not enough to distinguish its make. But at the moment, every little bit of information might be important and therefore should not be overlooked.
He isn’t, though. He’s all but fine. Being different, being lonely has never been so obvious and weighed so heavily on him. He neglects his studies, spends days in his room scraping on his violin or conducting chemical experiments that lead nowhere. He can’t seem to gather his thoughts, can’t concentrate, can’t compose, can’t sleep, has even less appetite than usual. He feels torn between contacting Victor and at least listening to his story and trying to delete him completely. He starts to smoke to ward off the hunger he does feel. Even though he loathes the reek of smoke and the taste of cigarettes, the nicotine helps him think. He composes, he begins to collect different types of cigarette ash and writes a paper about their properties in the detection of crimes. One day when he does venture outside and into the lab, he encounters a group of grad students experimenting with spiders and the effects various drugs have on their net-spinning capabilities. The experiment is quite fascinating. Even more so is the cocaine Sherlock nicks from them. He reads up on the drug, decides against snorting it. He doesn’t throw it away, though. One evening when he is feeling particularly out of sorts, his cherished mind sluggish (probably from dehydration and lack of food), he mixes up a seven-percent solution and injects it into his arm.
One of the stalls was unlocked, and as they approached, two men rose from where they had been kneeling. One, a tall man of about John’s age, looked so much alike Mr. Hutchinson that he assumed him to be his brother, Carl. The other, a white-haired man in his late fifties with a short beard and a trim, somewhat ascetic appearance had to be Dr. Hensley. He was wearing a stethoscope round his neck and was in the process of peeling off a pair of disposable gloves.
“Really? You’re this genius, a man who can look at others and deduce everything about them from their haircut or phone or whatever, and despite years of sharing a flat with me, you couldn’t deduce that I was head over heels in love with you?”
Slowly, as Churchill makes his way over to his group of underlings, the crowd begins to disperse. Sherlock takes leave of John and Molly, and follows his colleagues of Hut 8 to his workplace. Stepping into the stuffy hut feels almost a little alien. He has only been away for a few days. When he was on sick leave due to pneumonia, he was absent for far longer. And yet while everything looks, sounds and smells familiar (Turing’s mug chained to the radiator, the empty tea-cups and stacks of papers on the various desks, the dead butterfly at the window, the reek of Magnussen’s pipe and slightly musty smell of the linoleum flooring, the low murmur of voices, the scribbling of pencils and occasional shuffle of papers), it feels to him as if he’s been gone for a lifetime and has returned a different man.
Then the torch’s beam moves on, and the footsteps recede down the tunnel. How long until they round the corner, shine their light down the flight of stairs and notice that only one body is lying there? How long until they turn around and begin their search? Sherlock slides the flint into his pocket, takes a deep breath, wills his headache to subside (and fails) before resolutely stepping forward and pulling himself up. Even though the pounding in his head becomes strong enough to send another wave of nausea through his stomach, he manages to scramble up more quickly than he had feared. Panting slightly, he rushes over to the staircase, the residual light from the other end of the tunnel just strong enough for him to see the opening, a dark hole in the colourfully tiled wall.
With this, he leaves, his quick footsteps echoing through the church. John raises his eyebrows. “Lovely chap. Any more of your old Uni-friends riding in this Tour?”
“We give them extra food rations because my brother has a farm and we’re never short of eggs and things, and they provide us with the odd spare canister of petrol now and again.”
“I see him as a threat,” returned Sherlock grimly. Looking at him, his stern, thoughtful, worried expression, John thought he understood.
Sherlock came over when John was washing his hands next to the sick horse’s stall, looking both smug and slightly irritated.
For a while, neither spoke. John wondered whether he was supposed to continue reading, but Sherlock made no indication. At length, however, he stirred slightly. “They never made up,” he said quietly.
John is familiar with the area, generally known as “The Hell of the North”. The Trouée d’Arenberg is a staple of Paris-Roubaix – arguably the most difficult of the one-day races because it includes long sectors of
John shakes his head. “Not really, no. But I feel guilty all the same.” He gathers together their cups and saucers and begins to rinse them. Sherlock watches him until the doctor gives him a look over his shoulder. “How about putting away milk and biscuits, Sherlock?”
“Despite so many people turning vegetarian or vegan, there’s quite a market round here now for organically and ethically produced meat,” explains Barbara. “As well as other sustainably produced goods.”
John nods. Rising in the saddle, cycles up to Sherlock who is only a little ahead, almost as though he has been waiting for John. He looks up when John catches up with him and scrutinises his injuries.
As if reading his mind, John reaches for his hand. Sherlock looks up in surprise at the forward gesture. Even though Mrs. Hudson knows about their relationship, her sister has been kept in the dark. Strangely, even now she takes John’s blatant expression of affection as one of friendship. It’s both a relief and a disappointment. Sherlock feels a brief but powerful urge to pull John over to him and kiss him right in front of their landlady, to show her plainly that they aren’t just good friends but lovers, that John is the love of his life, the man he has bound himself to by a vow and a blade of grass, the one person he intends to spend the rest of his life with should their fates allow.
“What’s the mood in the team?” asks John. He really wants to know, but he also wants to give Sherlock, who has begun to pace the room like a caged tiger, a little break from all the attention, and from having to constantly explain and defend himself.
“Was there an autopsy?” asked Molly who had stepped round her desk and joined the three in the middle of the room.
John comes back to where Sherlock is standing and gently sweeps his hands up and down Sherlock’s arms “Come on,” he murmurs. “Let’s get you warmed up yeah?”
Sherlock nods takes a deep breath. “So long, John… So long I’ve wanted this. I never… I never thought you felt the same way.”
“Now let’s pick out an outfit,” she said breezily and walked into his bedroom. When Sherlock had caught up to her, she had his wardrobe flung open and was rifling through his clothing. She pulled out his newest silk shirt. It was a deep blood red undershot with black and he hadn’t had a chance to wear it yet. He knew that it contrasted well with his pale skin. He pulled out his current favourite black suit and turned to see that Irene was rummaging through his pants drawer.
“I believe that is what you are getting ready for,” Irene said, smiling. Sherlock sighed and picked up the phone.
Irene followed him sedately. She still had a small smile on her lips and her arms folded across her chest. She stood in front of Sherlock and raised a shapely eyebrow.
Donovan looks at Sherlock and something flits across her eyes that he can’t quite identify, sadness and empathy and determination. They are emotions that Sherlock is not used to seeing on Donovan’s face and he’s waiting for her usual derisive scowl.
A whine claws its way out of Sherlock’s throat, and he finds himself crushing John against him. Heat blossoms between them where they are pressed together from knee to chest. John gentles the kiss trailing soft small nips along Sherlock’s jaw till his mouth is next to Sherlock’s ear.
Thank you again to everybody who braved the cliffhanger and left comments or kudos on the last chapter or the story in general, and also, as usual, to my brilliant beta rifleman_s.
Sherlock caught his drift. Colour crept up his cheeks. “Oh, never mind that. Just ignore it. It’s fine.”
Officially, Mary Elizabeth Watson neé Morstan is dead. Tragic complications during and after the birth of her daughter brought about her demise. Officially, John is a widower. Officially, his daughter was stillborn due to a severe genetic defect. Unofficially, though ...
“I knew I wasn’t only queer one in our family. I knew it, I knew it. Congrats on finally stepping out of the closet, Johnny. Are you going to go public? When? How?”
John laughs. Nodding towards the underground sign on Southampton Row, he says, “Let’s hope the Piccadilly Line is running.”
“Bloody hell,” comments John. In front of him, van Coon has slowed down enough to listen in on the conversation. The blackboard man nods.
John flushed in shame. “Yeah,” he admitted. “Come to think of it, I think I hurt Sherlock when I did, particularly after he’d come to terms with the fact that he might not be completely above sentiment as he’d always upheld, and was actually fancying me a bit. But he never said, not until recently. But as I said, he never seemed to have any issue with being considered queer. He only gets annoyed when they assume he’s stupid or got something wrong, when they insult his intellect. But to be honest, I don’t even know what he identifies as.”
John holds him tighter, burrowing his head into the warm chest. “When did you become so wise?” he sobs.
After a quick breakfast (with hot tea) he set out for the surgery, checking his surroundings carefully for inconspicuous black cars and resisting the temptation to flag down a cab. It would provide more comfort than the Tube, but cause him to be late for work again because of the inevitable rush-hour gridlock.
Sherlock’s eyes narrow dangerously. He looks frustrated and positively angry of a sudden, mostly at himself. “What happened with Victor was unplanned,” he hisses. “And that, precisely, was the problem. It happened because I let sentiment take over. And look where it got me. I tried to resist it. I knew it would end in disaster. And I was right. Hence, all further thought about potential relationships, romantic, sexual, whatever, is moot. I don’t want one, never really wanted one. The one time I, in a moment of weakness, dared to ... ‘indulge’, as you might call it, nearly cost me my career, my health, and my sanity. It was hateful. The emotional turmoil, the feeling of being enslaved to my baser instincts, the threat of losing control completely ...” He actually shudders before sitting up in bed with his back to John, running both hands through his hair. Drawing back the cover, he slips out. John sits up, too, and holds up both hands in a placating gesture.
John gazes at him and smiles warmly. “Don’t forget to look at the stage now and again to maintain appearances,” he says with a wink, and gives Sherlock’s knee a quick, cheeky squeeze.
Moriarty and Magnussen battle it out for second place in this stage, with Magnussen outsprinting Moriarty and winning some highly coveted bonus seconds as well, cementing him in second place overall with only two seconds after Moriarty, who retains yellow. Next arrive Sherlock, Wilkes and Ricoletti, all clocking the same time. The first six places of the GC are now Moriarty, Magnussen, Baskerville, Ricoletti, Wilkes and Sherlock, all of them extremely close together within the scope of under two minutes. No great changes are expected before the penultimate stage, the time trial on Saturday, which offers the last opportunity to reshuffle the top ten.
John tried to keep the disappointment out of his voice. “Okay. Fine. Do try and get some rest nonetheless. And please know that the offer extends to other nights as well. Your own room must still reek of your botched experiment. So … yeah. Feel free to kip here if you like.”
“Illegal, you mean?” says Sherlock. “Don’t fret, I won’t report you. We’ll probably require your services again. You may need to identify someone to confirm whether it was the man who offered to buy Adler’s films from you. That could mean having to talk to the police, but the officer who’s going to do the questioning is someone you can trust.”
Both men turn to her. She shrugs, her expression grim. “Don’t pretend you didn’t think about it. I’m still cross with Jan about the shit he pulled. He’s still banned until next year, the stupid boy. One more transgression, and it’s going to be a lifetime ban for my little brother, the idiot. And with so much pressure resting on Sherlock now, and with the rumours about his past ... must be hard to fight the temptation of a quick boost.”
The transfer to Cahors, the start town of tomorrow’s stage, passes quickly. Everybody on the bus is in excellent spirits, watching videos of Kit’s win several times and ribbing him gently about his hugging spree and the fact that he barely managed to get a word out during his interviews because he was crying so much. Kit takes all of it in stride. Team Speedy’s is again leading in the team classification, and remain one of the few teams which still has its full roster intact. Most others have shed riders by now due to accidents, illness, or disqualification. Chances are good that they’re all going to make it to Paris now, to John’s great relief. He always hates it when teammates have to leave a race early.
For most of their meal, they had the breakfast room to themselves. Sherlock had desisted from bringing his laptop, having plucked it in to charge in their room. Instead, he was checking his mobile every few minutes, until John clanged his spoon into his cereal bowl and heaved a sigh.
Mrs. Cook beams at John. “Well, then all is well. I can arrange for some toiletries and towels, in case you haven’t brought any.”
“My colleague had a nightmare,” he says, truthfully, “which woke me up as well. It took him a while to calm down again. Affected by his experiences in the war, you see.”
during his first attempt. Sherlock can read him and his reactions during intercourse quite well, and should be able to adjust his ministrations accordingly to make this pleasurable for him.
“Would you prefer me to help you get rid of it here or ... somewhere else?” he asks, gazing up at Sherlock through his lashes. He’s nervous, too. Even though he has been with men before, it’s never been serious. None of his relationships – not even his failed marriage to Mary – have ever be this serious, this important, than what he has with Sherlock now – and has had all along, the friendship, the trust, the knowledge that this remarkable, strange, wonderful person is the love of his life. This is ... everything. He doesn’t want to mess it up.
“I was wondering where you’d gone,” says John, stepping over to him while the woman embraces her daughter who tells her about Spot, and how Sherlock helped bury him. Sherlock brushes his earthy hands on his suit that could do with a good brushing and cleaning, dusty as it is from the explosion and John tackling him to the ground. He notices that John is watching him with a strange, soft expression. Fond seems to be the right term for it. Warmth spreads through him, and he smiles involuntarily. His smile, however, soon morphs into an expression of pain. His head has been throbbing continuously. He takes a step, sways, and curses under his breath. Apparently he has hit his head harder than he thought. Immediately John is at his side, his fond expression replaced by a worried one.
The trouble, however, is that John isn’t doing it deliberately. Probably, it was only his natural reaction to having a warm body in his reach again after a long dry spell. As soon as he wakes, awkwardness will abound, they’ll blush and avoid looking at each other, and of course not talk about it. They’ll get ready and have breakfast and set out, and no mention will be made about their sleeping arrangements. Sherlock is torn between terminating the wonderful coincidence
Noticing someone’s presence, Mrs. Hudson turned. Her cheeks were still flushed in anger, but now her face shifted into a relieved smile. “Oh John, dear, good to have you back. I don’t know what came over this one today. I was happy when I realised he was back early, thought it’d cheer you up since you’d been so lonely these past days, but then he storms out almost knocking me over on the stairs, and comes back shortly after and starts whatever he did to blow up the kitchen table, and then the fire alarm goes off, and Mrs. Turner phones me that there’s all this smoke coming from the flat, and when I come up here he’s smoking again as if all this stench wasn’t enough, and —”
Sherlock gave him a cocky grin, which, despite his attempt at maintaining a stern expression, John felt compelled to return. “You too,” said Sherlock, before snatching back Fenja’s reins and beginning to lead her off to the thicket he had indicated previously.
When Lestrade is concentrating on the traffic again, Sherlock reaches for John’s hand that has been resting on the seat between them and squeezes it briefly. John smiles, his eyes twinkling. Sherlock smiles as well, feeling floaty and light and altogether happy.
Sherlock empties his tea and returns the cup to the strongly patterned saucer. “This has been very helpful so far. If anything else comes to mind, do write it down. Now, show me Jenny’s room, please.”
From the inner pocket of his coat, Sherlock carefully withdrew a small bird figure folded from the tin foil wrapper of a chocolate bar and held it up for John and Lestrade to see. “There were other small figures, but I left them at the site.”
He can feel John swallow deeply and draw a shuddering breath. “God, Sherlock. I think I’d like to rap your brother round the ears for being such an arsehole.”
Mycroft’s eyebrow twitches at the obviously unexpected thanks. “You are welcome. Mummy will be pleased to hear that you have found a ... friend at last. She worried about you.”
a seven-percent-solution of cocaine. Far more efficient and easier to control.  I never used when I was racing, though, only after I had quit pro-cycling.”
“I found some biscuits, too, but I didn’t trust them,” he says when he draws up a chair, sits, and begins to spoon powdered milk into his tea. Sherlock sits as well.
John smiled broadly as Sherlock’s eyes lit up. Did the man even know how beautiful he was in moments of intellectual bliss? “You’re cordially invited to join me,” John told him happily. “Both for breakfast and the cycling afterwards.”
“Right. The man Mrs. Matthews knocked out in self-defence is a wanted criminal. It’s unfortunate that he was killed, because we were hoping to hear his statement in another case. Excuse me.” With that, Sherlock begins to force his way through the broken hedge and climb down the bank, silently cursing his leg. The policemen spot him and come over, waving at him to not approach further. Behind them, the Shires have begun to drag the car out of the field.
After a brief visit to the loo he cautiously stepped into the kitchen. The partly destroyed table was still uncluttered, meaning Sherlock hadn’t devised any more experiments last night, which John thoroughly approved of.
Sherlock’s eyes briefly skip to him and his no doubt guilty expression, and he grins ever so briefly. “Found the shower manipulation, I take it?”
He remembers how thirty years ago, Ellie already had a reputation for strangeness among the Warringtons and their friends. Aunt Mabel chatted with her occasionally, and went round to borrow eggs and margarine, but from her remarks Sherlock concluded that she didn’t have a high opinion of her neighbour who she thought was sloppy and unorganised, watching telly all day and putting out washing on a Sunday (oh, the scandal) because she was too lazy to do it during the week like normal people. Uncle Richard couldn’t stand her, calling her ‘mental’ and once, when he was angry about her dog digging in the Warringtons’ front garden, an ‘ugly witch’.
Surprised by his own fitness, John is happy to stay with Kit and Sherlock. Gregson works in the wind as long as he is able, to drop out and continue at his own pace just after one of the decisive points in the climb to Col du Galibier: at about half the distance from Valloire to the pass, the road, which after an initial, painful ascent of about nine percent, levelled out to climb steadily alongside the Valloirette in a steep-sided valley, crossing the small river by a bridge in a narrow, almost 180 degree bend. Immediately afterwards, the road rises steeply with a gradient of over twelve percent, criss-crossing a sheer mountain-slope in narrow serpentines until reaching an alpine plateau from which the final ascent to the pass is already visible. As expected, attacks are staged on the steep ramps, but whenever one of the favourites tries to get away, the others quickly counter. It’s exhausting and exciting both, as are the views all around them. They are far above the treeline now, alpine meadows flowering around them with patches of snow clinging to the northern faces of the mountains rising on all sides. Cotton grass waves in the breeze, high above in the cloudless sky rooks are gliding on the thermal currents. Northwards, the road the riders followed out of Valloire shows like a grey ribbon snaking up the valley, a line of cars and cyclists crawling along with brightly coloured spectators to both sides.
Sherlock huffs and picks up his dressing gown. “It’s more than ‘like’, actually. Really, John, do we have to discuss this now? I love you, okay? Have loved you ever since we first met at Barts. Took me a while to recognise these feelings for what they were, and then all this Moriarty stuff happened, and I had to leave and ... anyway. They haven’t changed. The feelings. Are you coming now or not?”
“I have too little hard evidence for a verdict, and I don’t base my deductions on belief. But being hit by so much bad luck in one day ... it seems more than mere coincidence, particularly when said bad luck was doled out so ... strategically.”
Lestrade takes his leave, his eyes lingering on Molly’s happy face. When he is out of earshot, “You are aware he likes you, aren’t you, Molly?” says Sherlock.
“I’m here, Sherlock,” soothed John, trying to sound calm despite his voice hissing through his teeth. “I’m here, I’m fine. Please, wake up.”
John squeezed his shoulder gently and pressed a kiss to the top of his head. Sherlock sighed. “My mother did know about the cocaine. She expressed her stern disapproval and disappointment on various occasions. She tends to express her disappointment quite often when I am concerned, although she seems to have finally made her peace with my choice of occupation and lifestyle, and the fact that I’m never going to bend all my energy on achieving the Nobel Prize, unless it be for my attempts to find a remedy for the alarming decline of bee populations around the world.”
Recalling he wanted to take a picture of the tree skeletons in the river, he slowed down when he reached a road branching off to the left, shortly before the first houses of Valloire came into view. The road, or dirt track, rather, crossed the river by a narrow bridge. Unfortunately it was not fit for a road bike so he had to dismount to walk his machine over the rocky surface that would have posed a challenge even for a mountain bike. Without the wind chill of descending at speed, the heat of the afternoon sun bore down on him and he quickly shed the jacket. Casting a glance over his shoulder, his eyes followed the road as far as they could to try and spot Sherlock but he couldn’t see him. Hoping his always observant friend would see his bike, he deposited it against the bridge’s railing as he crossed to reach the footpath leading down to the water. Again, he wondered about Sherlock’s delay, hoping he simply got distracted by something and stopped to investigate, as opposed to a crash.
He swerved to avoid a drift of leaves that covered half the path, having seen Sherlock do the same in front of him as they were rolling down a small descent. The leaves were often wet and slippery under their narrow tyres, meaning they had to exercise extra care. To their left, the line of trees flanking the road grew less dense. John saw Sherlock stretch a little in the saddle and gaze in that direction as if he’d spotted something and wanted to point it out to John. Then hell broke loose.
John beams at him, actually beams. Sherlock feels his face twitch and he surrenders to the temptation to smile as well, wilfully disregarding the keen glances Mrs. Hudson gives the two of them.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed as he watched his father jerk up his chin defiantly. “Because you are, aren’t you?”
“It’s true,” says John. “I’m not gay. Thing is ... I don’t think I’m altogether straight, either. Perhaps you’re right with your labels thing. Perhaps they’re just not ... helpful for some people. My sister always knew she was a lesbian, and she wears that label proudly, and good for her. But I ... girls were always easier.”
“Probably, yes,” says Sherlock. “I expect my brother or one of his underlings to show up any minute now.”
“What? Are you out of your fucking mind? Why on earth would you climb a drain? At four in the morning. In fucking Belgium.”
Right, he reasoned, likely he had cried out. He’d never been particularly vocal in bed, but this just now had been special. It was to be hoped that Emma had already risen and was in the bathroom or the kitchen, out of earshot. If not ... well, this was potentially going to be awkward.
Stealing a glance at John who stands with his back to the window gazing about the room, he wonders what the other thinks of his abode. His flat is not furnished to entertain guests. The only people he used to receive were clients and occasionally members of the police force – or, even more rarely and definitely unwillingly, his brother. Therefore, his living room largely functions as a library, a place for research, not relaxation. The adjacent kitchen has rarely seen the preparation of food, but has rather been used as a laboratory for his chemical or forensic experiments. His bedroom is tiny and rarely used as Sherlock often falls asleep on the sofa in the living room. The bathroom facilities are shared and situated on the first floor.
“For your information,” John’s lips are almost touching his ear, his breath tickling Sherlock’s skin, making him shiver and swallow hard, “I have it on good authority that I can do skilful things with my tongue. In a variety of places.”
Sherlock perks up at this, turning on his side to face John and gazing at him keenly. “Strangely how?”
John drew a deep breath. “Good to have you back,” he whispered, knowing he wasn’t just referring to Sherlock’s trip to Switzerland.
“It was yew,” he admitted hoarsely. “But it shouldn’t affect him so. I mixed a few ground needles into his oats three days ago, not enough to render him in such a state by a long way. It was just meant to give him a mild colic. I don’t know why he’s so badly off suddenly. Yew works straight away, and it didn’t endanger him at all back when I gave it to him. He had a bit of diarrhoea a few hours after feeding time on Sunday, just enough so that he couldn’t train on Monday and yesterday. A rival of the owner who’d missed out on buying the stallion has been ... sponsoring me, and doing so generously. But as I said, I never meant to kill him. So whatever he has, it’s not yew poisoning. His metabolism should already have gotten rid of the toxin.”
He tries out some of the other moles and freckles on his neck and presses his nose and ears for good measure. Perhaps he’s got something like a switch on him, a button that when pressed in the right way sends him back in time. But if there is, he doesn’t find it. Or perhaps it simply doesn’t work when he presses it himself. Perhaps someone else has to do it. Or perhaps he needs to be agitated or upset or frightened. Perhaps the two resets that happened where rather because of him being highly emotional – something he has been struggling to suppress and control ever since Mycroft told him that it’s better to not let one’s feelings show too much – than because of somebody pressing a freckle on his neck.
They grin at each other. “Good luck, love,” says John softly, and with a last, gentle stroke along Sherlock’s arm which makes the other’s breath hitch, he leaves him to finish his warm-up in peace, and for himself to get ready to hit the road.
“Some people never have partners, and that’s fine, too. But for John, I wouldn’t have bothered either, I think. And even with him it took me years to admit to myself that I had fallen in love with him. He needed even longer.”
As expected, Victor Trevor launches another attack at Farthing Common, leaving Girotti and the Selters’ rider behind on the steepest stretch of the climb. Stapleton manages to cling to his rear wheel for a while during the descent from the last hill, then drops back as well once they’ve reached the flats, unable to match Trevor’s time trial honed speed. Despite his efforts, however, Trevor’s lead decreases constantly, mainly due to the combined efforts of Teams Speedy’s, CAM and Brook Consulting, who have now joined the fray and doing their bit for keeping speed high in the peloton, which consequently has been pulled into a long, drawn out line, almost a single file, instead of a huddled group. When there are ten kilometres to go, Trevor’s lead has narrowed down to twenty seconds. Stapleton has long vanished in the main field. Two other breakaway attempts have been stalled. On the next long, even stretch of road, Trevor can be seen ahead, a small, solitary figure accompanied by one of his team’s cars and the camera motorcycle, as well as the helicopter hovering overhead. As the distance decreases even more, the team car is told to drop back to make space for the imminent capture of the escapee.
“Monday morning. I’m taking the early train to Edinburgh, then on to Inverness to catch a transport to Scapa Flow.”
Closing his eyes, Sherlock tries to reconstruct the steps of their lovemaking in order to decide what he could improve during the second attempt. The thought of John wanting another go thrills him, far more than he anticipated it would when he allowed his mind to contemplate potential encounters with John. Now that he knows what it feels like to be touched by John, he can make informed guesses, even deductions about what John enjoys. Most probably, John did things to Sherlock that he himself likes, hoping that Sherlock might share his preferences. Sherlock vows to put this knowledge to use. The nerves and apprehension of the first time are a thing of the past. He feels far better prepared to take an active part in the activities, instead of simply lying back and letting emotion overwhelm him.
Daniel halts in the door, giving Sherlock a long and undeniably curious once-over. Sherlock wonders what he, with his limited abilities at observation and deduction, learns about him. Suddenly, he wishes he had brought his coat. He feels small and vulnerable without his armour of Irish tweed, and hates himself for it. After all, he knows he cuts a sleek, professional and even somewhat dashing figure in his Spencer Hart suit. At least that’s what Mrs. Hudson and even John have claimed over the years. Usually, he can use his appearance to impress and even intimidate people, even though deep down he considers himself ungainly and not very attractive with his disproportionate body and alien-looking face.
John gazed up at him, swallowing slightly and licking his lips again. He had not reckoned with such a direct assault, and it left him bewildered and more than aware of his own confused feelings. He returned Sherlock’s intense stare staunchly, his stance tense, before shrugging slightly and releasing a breath. “I don’t know,” he replied honestly.
“Do what? Use illegal means to get fit again, speed recovery? Is that the kind of pressure you were talking about?” John wants to know.
While the two lawyers and the photographer were walking ahead, talking animatedly in rapid Italian, Ivan lagged behind slightly. John didn’t need Sherlock’s deductive skills to realise he was doing it on purpose. Slowing down, he waited for the other to catch up.
He clears his throat, nods to the stunned riders, most of whom hadn’t expected to be given a speech like this so early in the morning, and from Lestrade no less, and sits. Conversation rises like a wave. John leans closer to Sherlock who is daintily eating a yoghurt generously heaped with granola and blueberries. “You knew? How?”
Sherlock nods. “In all likelihood, yes. Well spotted, John. Apparently Kenworthy and the soldiers were right about his interest in The Woman. And did you notice her reaction? She recognised him, I’m sure. Even expected him, perhaps.”
“He did not take it so well, however,” says John. “He tried to make light of it, but her leaving him must have smarted because he didn’t expect it.”
The thought surprises John. He’s not usually a selfish person, but this degree of consideration and selflessness is unprecedented. He still has a small measure of hope that Sherlock does in fact feel drawn towards him but hasn’t decided yet whether he wants to try his hands at another relationship ever again. John shakes his head at himself. Other riders are currently worrying about what this Tour de France still has in store for them. He is worrying about whether his roommate is in love with him.
“Hey, what are you up to?” John asked. “If you think of going over alone and accosting them in your charmingly direct manner, you can forget about that right away. They’re three, and they don’t look like they’d take kindly to anybody interrupting their little party. We’re both going, or nobody is.”
Some of the riders whistle softly. All of them have been tested rigorously during training, enduring frequent unannounced visits by anti-doping agencies, their locations known to these organisations around the clock. The idea that Sherlock underwent an even stricter regime brings on looks of pity but also admiration. He appears to have taken his return to cycling very seriously indeed. John begins to wonder whether the case Sherlock said he was working on isn’t just an excuse. Sherlock has an addictive personality, no doubt. And cycling can be highly addictive. John knows this only too well.
“Probably not,” Sherlock mutters, gazing intently to where two Brook Consulting team cars are parked. John is too small to see precisely what he has spotted there. “Excuse me for a moment,” says Sherlock, taking off the blanket and winding his way through the commotion. Emptying his mug with a gulp, John sets off after him.
Mary nods wisely at this. “Maybe they believe digestion slows them down,” she quips, at which Sherlock frowns, because that’s something he’s actually claimed now and again.
“I take it you are Mr. Holmes’ landlord,” butts in John. “In that case, would you please oblige us by opening the door to his flat. Mr. Holmes was hurt in the bomb blast while he was warning the children playing at the site, thus saving them from grave injury or even death. I am Dr. Watson of the Royal Navy and need to see to his wounds.”
“What? It’s true.” Sherlock’s playful smile changes to something more serious. John detects a hint of insecurity, quickly hidden by an expression of carefully studied disinterest. “So ... have you considered the offer?”
Daniel glances towards the stairs. “I bet she has. Well,” he clears his throat, “all right, then. See you tomorrow. And thank you once again. For finding her and bringing her back unharmed.”
The derelict house at Lauriston Gardens where in previous timelines, Jennifer Wilson died, lies empty and silent when they arrive, having walked the last few hundred yards from Brixton High Street because Sherlock wanted to get a feel for the vicinity – and also to watch out for Hope’s cab. There is no sign of it yet. The street is deserted but for a ginger cat sitting on a fence post, eyeing John and him lazily. The wind has picked up. Soon, it’s going to bring the rain that came down in Cardiff when Wilson boarded the train to London.
However, some work had been done to the interior recently. The back room had been screened off by some wooden planks, over which now an auburn head with a white stripe down its nose was gazing curiously at the men and their steeds. The foal whinnied again, and the Icelanders answered. Straw rustled when the Suffolk Punch moved about excitedly, snorting and tossing its head. It was indeed quite large for an animal that wouldn’t even be accounted a yearling yet. John wasn’t sure if the foal was able to fully raise its head in its stable. Even Sherlock had to duck slightly while still wearing his riding helmet because the ceiling was very low. Some old cables were dangling from it in a corner, but any lamps or other fixtures had long since disappeared.
He clambers onto John’s bed and sits down next to him. John studies the photographs. He’s been to the original Speedy’s Cafe on Baker Street before, mostly doing promotion for the team, so he recognises the exterior of the Georgian building with its black door and brass lettering. “The flat is on the first floor, with an additional room on the second,” explains Sherlock as he scrolls through a collection of images. “Mrs. Hudson lives downstairs and uses the third floor as attic space. Right, these are the kitchen and parts of the living room.”
Sherlock clears his throat. “Apologies, sir, but you cannot park your car here. Moreover, there is no need to wait. Miss Adler plans to stay longer and has communicated that she might even sing again. If you want to stay, you’ll need to move the car to another location.”
Next to the door, Moran’s housekeeper is standing by, watching the scene with a pale, drawn face. “I didn’t know,” she mutters when, upon Lestrade’s invitation, she hesitantly steps into the room “You must believe me, Inspector, I didn’t know,” she assures Lestrade, wringing her hands. “I was aware of Lord Moran’s visits to Germany, yes, and knew he had friends there. But I’d never have thought he’d support their leaders and their despicable politics. I have been with the family for a long time, and they never showed any indication of having this kind of wretched allegiance. Lady Moran certainly doesn’t. She’s a staunch Tory through and through, and friends with Mr. Churchill. She’ll be disgusted. She’ll be outraged. And so am I. I have two nephews who are fighting the Germans. I would never have thought that Lord ... Mr. Moran could have been working for
“She has connections who provide her with petrol,” says The Woman when after the service, and after Molly, Sally and Charlie have lit candles for Jenny, they meet in the small graveyard surrounding the church, “although Robert would have made sure I had means of transportation without having to rely on the trains. He couldn’t come himself, was required back at his station in Kent, but sends his regards.”
Of course Sherlock noticed him staring. He straightened up and drew a deep breath to put even more strain on his poor buttons.
Sherlock makes a face. Normally, he wouldn’t even consider involving the person at the other end of that line, but ever since he’s found the soggy message on Jennifer Wilson’s body, he feels something churning in his gut. There is more to her death than a suicide, he is certain of it. And to properly investigate, he’ll need time off work, and more resources than he commands at the moment. There is a good chance that he will require his brother’s help, loath though he is to ask for it.
“Sherlock.” He opened his eyes to see Irene squatting in front of his chair. “Go have a shower, you’ll feel more yourself.”
Sherlock estimates it will be another four months before John starts dating again. He doesn’t want to think about how long after that it will be before John finds the next Mrs. Watson and leaves 221b. So Sherlock is at the pub,
John bucks his hips up slightly, and suddenly their cocks are slotted together, and a low moan tears itself from his throat. The sound makes Sherlock gasp. He cannot help but twitch his hips forward and John wenches his mouth off of Sherlock.
Sherlock let the towel drop and slid on the black briefs, he looked at himself in the mirror. The shower and shave had made him feel better and Irene had done a proficient job. It was a good thing that she was there to help him shave because his hands had been shaking so badly that he surely would have cut himself.
Sherlock has no memory of the rest of the walk back to 221B. He comes back to awareness when they are in the darkened hallway. Power knocked out by the storm—John hustles him up the stairs and firmly closes and locks the door to the flat behind him. Despite the lingering heat Sherlock finds himself shaking so hard his teeth are chattering.
That realization hit like a knife in his heart. How utterly foolish. Of course John didn’t feel the same way. He felt the hot sting of tears behind his eyes. He would not cry. He squared his shoulders, lifted his head haughtily, and was about to turn to leave when the door suddenly burst open.
… because he has no idea how long he will have these moments with John, and he wants to savor every one that he has left.
Sherlock stomped up the stairs, muttering darkly to himself as he pushed past Irene. “Of course not. Why panic? Why would I possibly panic? It’s not like the only friend I have ever had has just heard my utterly pathetic love confession and is, as we speak, running for the hills. No, why on earth would I bloody well panic?” He walked across the sitting room and threw himself dramatically into his chair.
Aside from him and John, there were no other customers in the restaurant and every other table had at least half a dozen flickering candles of various sizes scattered across their surfaces.
“For what? Another night of pining? A night of staring at an empty chair? Oh god …” Sherlock covered his face with his hands and took a deep shuddering breath. Had he ruined everything? Could he hope that John might just pretend he had never heard Sherlock’s confession?
“Very nice,” Irene purred from where she sat perched on the edge of his bed. He looked at his watch: it was 7:15, time for him to start heading to Angelo’s.
He dressed carefully and opened the door. Irene was waiting for him in the hallway. He gave up trying to discourage her and let her lead him back to the bathroom where she applied just the right amount of product to his still damp hair and teased it into luscious curls. When she was done, he stood in front of his wardrobe mirror and admired her handiwork. The deep red of the shirt made his skin look luminescent and brought out the contrast of his dark hair. All of his suits were expertly tailored and this one was no exception.
Despite the storm and the power outage, Sherlock feels warm and utterly safe.The warm glow of the candles is briefly interrupted by a flicker of lightning and in the distance there is a low rumble of thunder. John’s breathing slows into the rhythm of sleep. Wrapped in their comfortable nest, Sherlock lets the steady sound of John’s breath draw him down into slumber.
He doesn’t want to think about the inevitability of John leaving. Doesn’t want to risk letting his feelings be known, doesn’t want to have what little he has with John now, destroyed by John’s discomfort. He is so lost in his own mind that he doesn’t see the man who steps in his way until the last minute. He mutters an apology and tries to step around him, but the burly man purposefully shoves into Sherlock, knocking him off his feet.
Sherlock opens his mouth and tries to speak, but nothing comes out. Concerned, John steps closer. “Sherlock?”
John moves closer to him and slides his warm hand on to the small of Sherlock’s back again. Sherlock cannot quite suppress a shiver. “You Ok? We can go home if you want.” John’s voice is pitched low only for Sherlock’s ears. He turns to face John and is surprised by how close John is. He can smell the beer on John’s breath and wonders if his mouth would taste of hops and malt. He knows that he is staring at John’s mouth for longer than is strictly appropriate and it takes a monumental effort to drag his gaze to John’s eyes.
“I love you, I love you, I think I have always loved you,” Sherlock whispers against John’s mouth. Their foreheads press together, breath mingling as they trade gentle kisses back and forth.
“Yes, Sherlock Holmes. I think the love of your life has just asked you out to a romantic dinner and I think it’s about bloody time. If you play your cards right, by the end of tonight none of your arch enemies can ever refer to you as ‘The Virgin’ again.”
He starts backing up towards the bedroom drawing Sherlock along with him. Along the way they begin to pluck at each other’s wet clothing, snatching increasingly heated kisses as they stumble down the hallway. John slows them as they reach the door, easing heated frantic kisses to slow soft ones. With feather light fingertips he takes Sherlock’s face in his hands. He take slow deep deliberate breaths until Sherlock begins to match his breathing.
“Several times, yes. Very helpful for finding particular types of pollen. They also sell vegetables, but flowers are the main business. Although one can get good pies there.”
John rolled his eyes. “The stuffed creature on Katie’s shelf that kept you awake two nights ago, you daftie. Deleted it already, have you?”
John laughs. “Yes. Hope your natural curiosity will prevail. So, let’s see ... lips, hands. Lips with an exclamation mark? Talking?”
John laughs softly. “Yes, I can imagine it well: you standing in a corner of a posh ball room or something, looking all mysterious and handsome in your tuxedo, smoking a cigarette and glaring at the assembly because they’re all getting on your nerves just by existing.”
He is in the kitchen making himself a cup of tea when his phone chimes on the living room desk. Sherlock dashes over to check. The text is from John. Sherlock’s heartbeat speeds up.
“Quite, yes,” nods Sherlock. “A number of points require further investigation. If possible, I should like to ask Mr. Moran some questions.”
This is more than Sherlock has heard John say during all of yesterday. And the day before. He is delighted, and lets it show with a soft smile and a low chuckle. “Oh, I think we’ll manage to afford the journey even without the Warringtons covering travelling expenses, John,” he says airily. “Although I propose we rent a car instead of relying on the questionable services of Southern Rail.”
Sherlock grins from one ear to the other. He very much wants to kiss John right now, but knows that he must desist.
They don’t quite manage to catch the escapees, though, who maintain a steady lead of about two minutes. When it becomes clear that they are going to nab the sprint points, the three teams cease their tempo-work. In the hilly terrain that follows, the breakaways, working together well, increase their lead to over nine minutes.
He looks as though he wants to say more, but in this moment, Angelo arrives, carrying a small cardboard box. He looks very pleased with himself. “I hope you’ve enjoyed your meals.” Both men nod.
“Try thinking about Mycroft,” a sleep-roughened voice rumbled into John’s ear which caused him to freeze in shock. Against the back of his neck, he felt Sherlock grin as he burrowed his nose into the hairs at John’s nape. “Helps me in most of these cases, even the more persistent ones.”
,” adds Kit. “What an idiot. Wonder when they’ll manage to clear the road. I could do with a hot shower.”
John didn’t remark on how closely his friend seemed to be listening to his doings and tried not to think about what else he might have heard. He ran a hand over his face. “I haven’t had a nightmare for a while. And this dream was just strange. I only remember snatches and they don’t make any sense. Not that I mourn the absence of the others.”
“One must be tired indeed to spell ‘eins’ wrong,” remarks Sherlock. “Also, the Enigma is operated by two people, one typing, one noting down the coded letters as they show up illuminated. The third person is the radio operator converting the cypher into Morse code.”
“My beliefs don’t enter into this, detective inspector,” replies Sherlock. “The evidence we have accrued so far points that way.”
“Yes, this sounds like a good place to investigate,” he says. John frowns, and Daniel looks pleased.
“‘Further development of our relationship’? Christ, Sherlock, you sound like one of these magazines we keep in the waiting room at my surgery.”
Sherlock nods, retrieves his wallet and begins to count out the money. John raises an eyebrow but takes it, subtracting, however, the value for his own ticket and pushing the coins back to Sherlock, who, rather reluctantly, pockets them.
, one of the best biographies of the author to date, detailing not only the development of his legendarium, but also his time as an officer at the Somme, thus indicating that you are a fan of his fantasy books and familiar with them, and interested in the First World War as well. This particular battle seems to be important for your family because you’re wearing a good luck charm round your neck – cyclists tend to be ridiculously superstitious, don’t they? The charm, if I saw it correctly before you buttoned up your shirt, is a piece of shrapnel, possibly inscribed and wrought into jewellery, as was common amongst soldiers serving in the trenches of the First World War. There is a medical journal in your bag, specialist literature, not widely available to laymen. I would say you were given this copy by the team’s physician, Doctor Sawyer, with whom you entertain friendly relations, probably because you’ve known each other from before you went pro – balance of probability says you met at college or university, and at one time were more than friends.”
“The man who, by taking into account all evidence we had should have been the prime suspect turned out to have a very tight alibi. And yesterday a new body turned up in the Tanks at Tate Modern. Lestrade just emailed photographs.”
“So who’s behind all this? It’s pretty ... wild, isn’t it? Ingenious, too. And a bit ... don’t know. Cheeky.”
Apart from Molly, he knows of nobody else who has ever shown even the slightest romantic or even blatantly sexual interest in him. His unusual looks combined with his curt and brutally honest, abrasive personality usually took care of potential suitors, putting off even the more daring candidates. Bletchley Park is the first place where people actually suffer him to work with them and seriously value his input. Despite his initial misgivings about his work here, fired by his resentment over having been forced to leave his beloved London, he has to admit he likes it. He likes the work – most days, at least –, he enjoys the genuine approval of his colleagues. He would not go as far as calling any of them friends, apart from Molly, perhaps. But they are tolerable, and they not only tolerate him, but actually value his contributions. And then there are his landladies, true angels, both of them, albeit very chatty and sometimes overbearingly coddling ones. If anybody loves him, albeit not romantically but rather maternally, it must be them.
Again there were some looks, but none of the men decided to comment, and to John’s relief, the conversation soon drifted to other subjects. A second bottle of wine was brought and emptied, there was a round of rather excellent grappa, and by the time they were finished darkness had fallen. To John’s slight surprise, when he checked his mobile upon departing the restaurant, there was no message from Sherlock. Obviously the case was taking up every available bit of his time and concentration so that he didn’t even bother texting John snippets of thought like he often did even when in full case-mode.
It’s an unusually hot day for London and the air conditioner in the pub is having a hard time keeping up.
Could she be right? Could it be that John had heard him and felt the same way? Was it possible that after all these years of longing, he could have what he wanted? And was it possible that the night might end with John Watson in his bed? That thought made Sherlock’s lips twitch up into a smile. Before he knew it he was just a block away from Angelo’s.
“I’ve got you, I’ve got you. Oh look at you, God, if I could come again I would just looking at you now.” John’s arms are still around him and he shifts both of them, gently rolling Sherlock onto his side. But Sherlock is still shaking, overwhelmed, trembling with the enormity of what has just happened. He doesn’t realize that he is crying until he sucks in his breath in a ragged sob.
At that precise moment both Sherlock and Irene heard that distinct creak of the eleventh riser on the staircase.
Sherlock nods but avoids John’s eyes. He’s not sure that John knows that his relapse had more to do with his despair over John’s wedding, than trying to get Magnussen’s attention.
“It isn’t like that.” Sherlock grits out. “He isn’t… We’re not…” He swallows. He doesn’t want to think about this, doesn’t want to acknowledge it out loud. “We’re not a couple.” His voice is far more raw than he would like it to be.
Before they have traveled far, there is a flash and the ominous rumble of thunder. Fat cool drops of rain begin to pelt them. They look at each other, realising that it’s unlikely they’ll get home before the rain starts in earnest. Foolish grins break out on their faces; they start to run, hoping to make it to 221B before they are completely drenched.
Sherlock scowls fiercely. Donovan cannot possibly be serious. He snatches up the rest of his drink and gulps it down in one swig. “He married a woman. ‘Not gay,’ remember?” He’s just starting to get drunk enough to not care what he has just revealed to Donovan. She looks like she’s about to say something else, but Sherlock ignores her and catches John’s eye. He lifts his empty glass and mimes getting John another drink. John grins at him and nods and Sherlock slides carefully off his stool.
“Oh, I’d almost forgotten,” Lestrade says, “I brought a cold case file if you want to have a look at it Sherlock.”
There is another flash of lightning and the thunder this time is so loud that Sherlock can feel it in his chest. His laughter dies abruptly and he stops in his tracks.
“Yes.” Briefly, Sherlock explains about Hope’s ‘game’, how he lures his victims in, threatening them with a fake gun but mostly appealing to their intellect and pride and taste for danger, their desire to prove themselves cleverer than he.
“For the record, you’ve worn my coat before on two occasions. So there is no need to mark today in the calendar or make a blog post about it. You can fetch the milk for the next three months, if you feel the need to repay me.”
“Right,” says John slowly. “I ... don’t really understand what’s supposed to be important about that, but it looks as if you’ve got more. So out with it, before you burst from sheer excitement.”
“No, not exactly. But it helped disperse the memories of my dream, so I thank you for that. I agree, however, that we should try to get some rest now. Otherwise, if our landladies find you in my bedroom in the middle of the night, they might get the wrong idea.”
In contrast, looking after Tiffany, who is bright and inquisitive and a bit weird even by Sherlock’s standards – delightfully so – is wonderful. It takes Sherlock’s mind off the tensions between John and him, tensions Sherlock knows he bears some guilt for without knowing how to solve them. He often wishes he’d had more experience with relationships than mere theoretical knowledge, things he’s read in books or in help forums on the internet. He loves John deeply, knows the feeling is mutual. At least they managed to sort this out recently. He wants to make John happy and not be a bother, but more often than not, he doesn’t know how, and says and does things he later realises hurt John. And John, despite having more of a past in terms of (failed) relationships than Sherlock, doesn’t seem to be faring any better.
Like John, he has been extremely busy lately, solving cases online for private clients and occasionally venturing out to help Lestrade and some of the other Met officers. John expected Sherlock to soon be bored out of his mind with the restrictions the pandemic imposed on their daily life, but Sherlock manages to occupy himself surprisingly well: experimenting, solving cases, composing, reading, cooking for them now and again. He even cleans and tidies up once in a while, and has been looking after their laundry, the sterilisation of their masks, and, most shockingly of all, shopping.
John’s face splits into a warm smile. “A lifetime, eh? Well, let’s hope this bloody war isn’t going to mess up this opportunity. I for one wouldn’t mind functioning as your object of study and distraction for the rest of our lives.”
Sherlock feels a stab in his chest. Oh God. What if John has only been playing with him? What if he doesn’t mean any of what he has done? What if it’s just been a game to him, or worse ... what if John is the spy? What if he’s been trying to charm his way into Sherlock’s good books to become privy to his work and all the secrets this entails? He could be working for Mycroft after all. Worse, he could be working for the enemy, could be a German spy. Sherlock prides himself of being highly perceptive, and moreover always rational, uninvolved, an outside observer keeping his emotional distance. Until John Watson came along and wrought havoc with his rationality and emotional detachment, dragging down his perceptive abilities with him.
“How very creative. Wonder if they had to look up the word before they used it. This is actually much better than what I got ten years ago. I was just a sad junkie unable to cope with his sudden success then, now I am a psychopathic, perverse, predatory, doping homosexual whore.”
They spent at least half an hour with the bees. As Linda had said, there wasn’t much to see because the insects had already turned in to hibernate. That didn’t stop Sherlock from asking one highly specific question after the other and requesting to see her equipment. Linda, obviously revelling in having such an informed and interested guest, happily showed him around.
“The flat did not show any signs of forced entry or someone searching it,” said Sherlock. “But it is possible she had something in her bag.”
John shrugged. “Talking that way about a murder investigation still falls in the ‘bit not good’ category in my book, whatever Sherlock thinks. But yes, I like helping him, and sometimes simply watching him, especially when he’s in full case mode and you can almost see the cogs working in that magnificent brain of his.”
John laughs softly. “Well, I for one am rather knackered, given we had so little sleep last night. We could try ... ‘or’, but I’m not convinced I’m going to be of much use to you in that department tonight. Sorry.”
Sherlock picks up the can and frowns at it. It’s a jarring, unfitting thing in this tranquil natural world. He doesn’t like it, because it reminds him of other people staying here. Rationally, he knows he is not alone. In fact, it’s quite a marvel that no hikers, dog-walkers or sheep farmers have shown up so far. The place must be popular with wanderers because of the nice view. And judging by the bicycle tracks he saw earlier, some of the local youngsters seem to come up here, too. Maybe it was they who lit the fire, hidden away from the disapproving eyes of their adults. Maybe, if he digs deeper, he’ll find other cans and bottles, and cigarettes, too. Stupid idiots. The least they could do would be to take their litter with them upon leaving, instead of spoiling the countryside with it.
Right now, he stands staunchly at his side, glancing about the room with a mixture of wonder and light amusement, particularly when his eyes fall on the stuffed dogs: old Wuffles, the Wheaten Terrier, flanked now by a cream-coloured poodle and some kind of terrier mix, the latter being Mr. T whom Sherlock recalls from his childhood days.
