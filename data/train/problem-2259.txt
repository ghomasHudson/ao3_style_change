John follows and takes a seat at the couch, looking up at the clock. “That’s not going to work this time,” John says.
Mycroft’s eyes light up. “She could use the doctor as leverage against you! This could be used to our advantage! This may be an excellent idea after all.”
“No, an invitation. It’s part of the game.” Sherlock leans down again, this he picks up a large, black button. “Mine,” he says, picking up the sleeve of his Belstaff that’s draped over John’s arm. He compares the button for John’s benefit. “I thought I’d lost it from my coat a few days ago, but it seems that Ms. Kratides nipped and planted it here.”
As they climb down through the rocks to the beach below, it’s slow going, but Sherlock quickly remembers the path he took as a boy.
Afterward, John had told himself many lies. He told himself nothing had happened. He told himself he wasn't gay. He thought that maybe if he told himself enough times, it would become true. But it didn't. No matter how many times he repeated it, he still remembered how Steven made him feel.
John thinks back to all he knows regarding Ms. Kratides. Mycroft said Sophy is biding her time. They need to draw her out.
Moriarty had a hand in this before his demise, it seems. Who was he? The name sets him on edge. He decides to search his mansion for anything that’s there. He closes his eyes, his back resting against the headboard, steepling his fingers and pressing them against his lips. He stands in front of his grand mansion and steps inside the large, wooden doors leading inside. He takes the winding stairs up. On the second floor at the end of the hall, there’s a door with the name “James Moriarty” written neatly on a placard in Sherlock’s hand. He reaches for the knob, turns, and pulls.
“Interesting.” His eyes tell Will what he’s thinking. It’s not a question, but it’s one he hadn’t pondered. Why these subjects? For someone who says he dislikes the company of others, Will chooses people as subjects. It’s like John knows what’s inside him, what he won’t even admit to himself.
“Of course,” she adds and winks again. Will wonders if she has a tic.
His heart is racing. He feels like he's panicking. But they're on the island. Safe.
“You did bug the flat then,” John says.
With his other hand, he latches on to my hair and tugs me to a sitting position on the filthy, disease infested cot.
So there I was about to have a drink with Lestrade. I even had the pint to my lips when Sherlock whisked in from the street, took my hand, and pulled me off the stool. And where did we go? Straight into a cab, where Sherlock went immediately into that mind palace of his. Next thing I know we're dropped off at a small, private airfield to the sound of the waiting a sleek, black helicopter already warming up for us.
Sherlock eyes go wide. “Oh! I have the one you left for me,” Sherlock reaches inside his belstaff and pulls out his worn copy of
“I didn’t think you’d like it. People don’t.”
His heart feels like it’s beating out of his chest. His minds struggles to scan through drugs that trigger fatal arrhythmias. He’s seen Cardiff Infirmary pharmacy, but he can’t access what he needs. It’s mixed up and jumbled inside his head. He does manage to narrow the possibilities down, but he's so slow! He’s become all those normal people he detests! How do they stand it?!
"It must be feeding," Sherlock says, a little winded but voice filled with awe. He's bouncing up and down like a kid at a carnival. John breathes hard next to him. His leg hurts a bit, but it felt good racing after Sherlock again. Sherlock smiles fondly at him.
“A nun cussing! Abominable! Won’t you end up in hell?”
"I don't think he has many friends," John finally said."He's not into large lecture halls. He calls most people 'idiots.' I think he includes some of his professors in that description."
He’s not sure if Will read his blog, but he suspects he did. It was the last thing open last night when he finally went to bed. He doesn’t know how he feels about Will knowing his personal fears revealed there. Suddenly John sees that thinking about all this sitting across the table from Will is just as revealing.
“You can’t blame yourself for that, and I’ll never blame you for it. It was never your fault. I think about Mary or your sister. I could hate them, but what good would that do? They punished themselves. Mary’s plan to leave me ended her. I’ve thought a lot about it—what Eurus did to us. I tried to reach inside myself to understand why. What drives someone to do what she did? Then it suddenly occurred to me: it wasn’t an experiment. It was Eurus’ quest to discover emotion.”
“I also found listening devices in Lestrade’s office,” Sherlock says.
The car pulls ahead of him, then stops. John does too. He thrusts his hands into his pockets while he shakes his head in resignation.
He continues to leer down at John's naked and flushed form. He makes a show of grasping his long cock in his hand and strokes it firmly until it stands tall and proud. He shifts around the bed as John lifts his head to watch.
“And to know where to send the bill. I can tell you that I have no memory prior to two years ago. When can I leave?”
The words were stamped inside his head now, and there would be only one way to rub it off.
“Correct. I’d say you have about ten minutes or less.” Gone are the musical Welsh rhythmic inflections replaced by British RP.
I detest instant coffee, but John preferred it. He grew up on it. I declined his offer to assist, and I put on the kettle for the instant but brewed some for myself. Despite this, he may as well have made it. He opened the cupboard and took out his favorite coffee mug and my cup and added my usual four heaping spoons of sugar.
Sherlock's grin turns wicked as he grabs John's other wrist and knots the cord. John notices that he's careful to place his own fingers between the knot and John's wrist so that it won't restrict his circulation. Sherlock secures the other end of the cord to the opposite bedpost. John tugs to test Sherlock's knots.
As unresponsive as she was, I attempted to teach her to waltz, thinking I could reach her, but she stood immovable. Her arms limply hanging from her sides, her feet refusing to take one step, she stared through me as if I was not there.
“I was in the lab with only one door and no windows, I couldn’t smell them, but I felt them. I touched the steel table, then pressed my hands and called on my powers. Nothing! My body betrayed me. Instead, my heat erupted and my scent filled the room. I was trapped.”
As a boy, he began simple and twirled them between his thumb, index and middle finger, learning how to create captivating motions and stunning displays. But over the years, he learned that it was essential to use all the fingers in the presentation. Sherlock dazzled those who watched. Even his mum and dad were impressed.
Sherlock’s heart nearly stops when he sees someone behind her being dragged across the floor by two me, his head bowed.  Sherlock makes certain his own face doesn’t betray him.
and look for buried treasure with Redbeard.
“You’re saying it’s possible that what she’s putting out there about Mycroft is actually true?”
No one seems to have brought along anything for him. Not that kidnappers generally pack for you, but it this were Sherlock, he'd remember to send some clothes, wouldn't he? After a few days underway, some of the crew take pity and donate their extras.
Sherlock flopped back into the bed, staring at the ceiling, willing himself to get a grip. Instead his own hand reached inside his pants and he stroked himself in time with John's hips. His own cock jerked and wept in his palm.
Sherlock is stunned. Eurus. They’re talking about his sister, and what happened to her. But he can't think. His head feels as if it will explode.
“So is she dead or not?”
, the chapter that revealed the covert purpose was in "The Unseen."
James clapped again. “Oh, it gets better yet! You’re jealous! I do so love that you’re jealous.”
She pinches his leg hard and he flinches. Then she takes his wrist and feels his pulse. “Not done yet. I do wish you’d hurry up and die. I have so much to do today.”
I want to kiss him so badly at times like these. It’s hard to push down the urge.
Sherlock felt his heart rate drop.
The crash of waves breaking on the reef makes John think he's misheard Sherlock. John swallows.
John rolls, shifts into him, on top of him. And all Sherlock’s nerve ending spark into overload. As John’s hands brush his skin at his waist his finger tugs at the top of his scrubs, and he helps Sherlock slide them over his head. Skilled fingers find the tie on the bottoms and pull them loose.
“And he ate most of the popcorn.” Mary raised an eyebrow.
"That's fine. It happens," John said. Another British guy. John wondered how so many of them were fetching up here in the Upper Midwest.
Sherlock holds his breath as a spike of pain shoots through his head.
“It’s a miracle,” John says almost moaning at how good it tastes. What can’t that man do?
John groans again on the floor. Sherlock keeps himself from looking down at him as he stands.
“Knocking me senseless again won’t help,” I say. “I have cement attached to my feet. Did you think I was going to walk over to the dock and jump in?”
"You're convinced that I'm not a dangerous person, but you're not sure about yourself," Will explains. "And I believe the reverse to be true. We're at an impasse on that point, but as we're talking about dangerous people, protection seemed like a logical follow-on."
Sherlock steps up to the table looks down and concurs. He’s sorry he’ll have to tell John that he was right, they do have another victim.
John’s lips are hard and soft and filled with contradictions. His mouth is slippery and slick and sweet as candy. His tongue is thick and powerful and relentless. It stabs and explores inside Sherlock’s mouth. The air is hot surrounding them. He needs to remove these clothes.
“I agree, but it will never happen unless attitudes change. It’s still illegal for single Omega’s to take suppressants.”
“Knowing Sherlock, I don’t think this Lord Blackwood will have a choice.” John watches Sherlock’s progress. He’s stopped again. “One of those buildings wouldn’t happen to be Capital Tower?” John asks.
"Oh, do try not be an ignoramus!" Sherlock said. "Even you should be able to follow the trail of blood and intestines that begins about fifty metres from here."
"Wonderful!" She walked him to the door. "I look forward to having my son here again. Both of my sons." She hugged him again, this time squeezing him tightly.
"What a pity! It might rain and..." She saw Sherlock putting on his coat and scarf and realized it was pointless to make him do anything. "Fine. It's still light out so I'm sure it'll be fine but please be careful. Promise me that you'll come back soon."
John settled in by the driver's side. Sherlock stayed in the middle to cuddle up against him. He rested his head on John's shoulder.
John turned so his abdomen could touch Sherlock's. He placed his hand on his shoulder and squeezed it firmly.
John turned the keys to start the truck and the same gurgling noise clanged from the engine. A sputtering sound came after. He turned the keys forward and tried again. The engine faltered and made a low spitting sound. It wouldn't start.
John looked down at the speedometer and waited for what was coming. He knew Sherlock had a smart ass comment brewing.
Mycroft slapped his hands away and tutted.
"But John..."
After sharing snarls with Mrs. Hudson, he then stayed looking at Sherlock. His eyes were piercing right through him. Had he had superpowers of his own and if his eyes could form laser beams, he very well could've made a hole through his skull. He enjoyed the baffled look on his little brother. One of his little brothers.
Sherlock and John held hands as they walked back to the truck.
"He goes by Stephen. Stephen Strange, as I know him. Many others refer to him as Doctor Strange."
Sherlock only eats two but always orders three because he knows that even after four, John can always eat one more. Besides, interestingly enough, the cashier only charges him for two. Sherlock never bothers to correct their mistake because he feels they deserve it for not paying attention.
Sherlock took it and looked over it curiously. It was his five year old self, kneeling on a sandy beach next to what seemed to be another child. It had been ripped in half so they were unable to see the full image on the right. All they could make out was half of someone's face and body. They could see their dark, straight hair hanging just below the ear, their light colored summer jumper and shorts, and what looked to be a deep shade of brown penny loafers. Mrs. Holmes took great care of her memories but throughout the years, naturally, the outer layer had developed a yellow tint.
He jumps down and grabs John’s shoulders. “Box? As in Pandora’s Box?”
One stop at the nurses station tells John that most of the staff confirm what William said: they refuse to go into Will’s room anymore with chipped ice or the like. Only Sister Katherine does so willingly, and she is far crankier than Will. She just sasses back and Will respects it. John does his rounds quickly when he sees Greg leaving Will’s room with his eye twitching.
Easy enough to distract those within and slip into the storage area where, just as he suspected, easy access through a service panel. He finds himself on a stairwell that takes him to an upper parking ramp. His ankle is hot and swollen. When he put his shoe on earlier, it barely fit, and when he pressed his fingers into his flesh, an indentation remained. He pushes on, ignoring the pain.
And that was the other thing. He had an answering machine.
"I win frequently."
“Most people are what you call ‘rubbish’ at keeping secrets, let alone hiding them. It would be next to impossible for the average individual not give away the ruse. No one in his family
"The rotting eelgrass gives out a pungent smell of iodine," Sherlock says. "It's particularly strong here. I wish I had thought to pack my microscope and some supplies. I'd love to do some tests on its decomposition. There're so many possibilities."
“Who did send Batman?” John asks me. We’re at Regent’s Park. I suggested we take a second walk today. This afternoon it’s the swings.
Norbury says. “Familiar?”
"Your clothes were so...binding. Those buttons on your shirt were about to pop on their own." He slid up the bed closer to Sherlock's head. "I do want you, but I will wait if you do not want this."
Sherlock could feel him peering at him. He felt uncomfortable. He moved over to stand next to the client's chair. Grabbing on to his elbows, he kept his arms folded closes to his chest. There was too much going through his mind. Far too many thoughts.
It had been one week since the funeral. John, always the resilient man, was standing motionless facing the door with his hands secured by his sides. Through polished eyes he tried to count the chips as he always did when he needed to regain composure. Living with Sherlock meant it was often enough for him to know that there were exactly 59. At that moment, he could not focus on a single one.
Having been in the military, John was capable of cooking almost anything. However, because Sherlock had a thing for sweets, he always made French toast. Sometimes he would add chocolate chips or fresh strawberry pieces on top. The only thing Sherlock hated was whipped cream so he never bothered with it.
"What is it? What's all the commotion about?!" Mrs Hudson tried to catch her breath.
John slouched on the seat. He looked down between his legs. His dick had shifted to one side and it's remarkable size had made the denim rise up. He never wore skinny jeans but the way he was right now made it seem as if he did. He could feel his erection aching underneath.
"Did she have what?"
John joined in and together they were laughing quite energetically. They laughed so loudly that Mrs Hudson ran back upstairs.
John had both hands on the steering wheel and as he sped up on the lonely road, he replied, "I took it in last week for a tune up. It's fine."
Sherlock waits for John to start eating his food first because he loves watching him take that first bite. He loves watching the juice drip from the corner of his mouth down to his chin. He gazes at him quite carefully and it's like he himself can already taste the salty, sour, crispy goodness. He knows something is delicious if John moans a little while he chews. Sherlock waits for him to nod in satisfaction and then proceeds to eat his.
John sucked on Sherlock's top lip while his hand crept over to his waist to unbutton his pants. Sherlock pulled apart from their kiss to unbutton his aubergine colored shirt.
"We can't stay. Right, John?" Sherlock looked towards him and with his eyes pleaded for him to agree.
"It may be the first but it certainly won't be the last." John giggled.
Sherlock's stare turned into a gaze. He was admiring John's handsome face.
John broke his daze, turned to look at him and said, “You’re right, Sherlock. It’s not the best time for anything right now. Alright?” The feeling in his hands revived, allowing him to place his left palm against his forehead. He could feel the stinging in his hand. It slowly made its way up to his shoulder. He welcomed the pain for it would give his head a moment to recover.
John asked, "Did she have it too?"
Mycroft was unphased by the doctor's stern tone. "No, our sibling did not die in a fire. This is the story we tell family and friends. Yes, we have a brother but he no longer goes by Eurus." Mycroft closed his eyes. He took a deep breathe in and for a moment wondered if he should proceed. He decided it was time. He opened his eyes to look up at the ceiling again.
After a while, they started to feel the evening's cool air and so they got dressed soon after.
They kissed again.
John wondered, "That doesn't sound too bad. She was mischievous but I don't think that was enough to cause concern."
Sherlock loves Sunday mornings because John wakes up early to make breakfast. He always finds John singing and dancing in the kitchen. It's the one time he finds him roaming around their flat in nothing but his boxers.
Mycroft had seen this occur plenty of times before but it still managed to startle him. He regained his cool. He placed his hands in his pockets and held on to his grin. It was almost evil.
Another ten minutes passed by. Mycroft could've waited all day had it not been for John. He had started to return the gestures, making the sounds that went along with it.
He cupped his face just as a father would while speaking to his young child. "Mycroft, Doctor Strange is a fictional character created by The Strand. The stories they print are not real. They're pretend. You know, make believe." John's eyes got smaller. "Do you understand?"
"No, I've only seen you with your parents and this one with Mycroft. Oh, isn't that sweet?" John held up a picture that showed a well-rounded Mycroft carrying baby Sherlock.
They were silent. Ten minutes passed by and neither of them uttered a word. Had Sherlock allowed a clock in the house, you could've heard it ticking.
The laughter started to die down. Mrs. Hudson entered the room and began pouring everyone tea.
Mycroft's ears turned a slight pink and he chuckled to the audience in the room. "Oh,  Stephen. Still quite the comedian, I see." He looked around and then got up to walk towards the fireplace. He stopped right in front of Sherlock. He took the call off of speaker and brought the phone to his ear. He said, "It is time."
Sherlock was already in the truck, sitting in the passenger side. John took out the keys from his jean pocket and hopped in.
They drove down a countryside road. There wasn't much to look at except for big lonely trees every now and then. The summer rain had made the hills on the side of the road a deep shade of green.
"The deduction thing", responded John.
Sherlock loves Tuesdays because they go out for fish tacos at Rubio's. He use to hate fish but John once begged him to try it and he did. He'd do anything for John. All it took was one bite for him to say that beer battered fish tacos were what Tuesdays were all about.
There always seemed to be a lot of patients scheduled for Mondays. What bothered John the most were the walk-ins because sometimes they came in crying.
Mrs. Holmes had stopped by the day before to drop off some old photographs John had requested for a slideshow that was to be shown during the wedding.
Sherlock pulled back a bit and said, "You know what." He looked at John waiting for him to make eye contact. Their eyes met and he asked ever so softly, "Please?"
John tried to steady his breathing. He watched Sherlock's fingers as they worked their way from his throat to the bottom just above his belly button. Sherlock swung his shirt wide open, revealing his defined chest and abdomen.
"Sherlock, what's this?" John asked while handing him the photo.
"Er. He- hello." John struggled to reply.
John put his foot on the breaks and slowly came to a halt. "What is it? What's wrong?"
They smiled at each other and started kissing again.
John nodded, accepting the facts.
It was a 1950 classic Chevy. It was cherry red with whitewashed tires. Sherlock had surprised him with it for his birthday only six months ago. It was John's other interest.
The rain wasn't as harsh anymore but the occasional bursts of showers occurred.
"You mean to tell me that we have a brother who is named after a fictional character? A superhero, as they say?" Sherlock looked upset but after a moment he burst out laughing.
Using their juices, they gave each other a few more strokes.
John knew the task wouldn't be easy but it was a promise he could keep. He'd find a way. Even if he had to tie him up and drag him here by his hair. "I promise."
Sherlock gasped for air, tried hard not to blink and persisted on. "I have solved so many cases. The ones I haven’t solved, I have learned to embrace. I can live with my cruel imperfections. But if I must live with all of my sins, then let me be redeemed by living the rest of my life caring for you, protecting you… loving you. I cannot live without you.” His voice got stronger. “You are the one thing in this world, the only human being that I refuse to give up on. Your happiness is all that matters to me. If the only success I have is in making you feel as happy as you’ve made me then I have beaten every curse placed upon me. If giving up these… these puzzles means that I can ensure your safety, then so be it. I surrender who I am for who you are.” Sherlock paused for a second, realizing John hadn’t moved at all. He asked himself, “Has he blinked?”
Sherlock had walked further in and stopped at a patch of purple and yellow flowers. He bent down to pluck a couple.
This was Sherlock’s deepest, darkest secret and he had condemned himself for having said it out loud. That is how he felt. John’s denial had pushed Sherlock into a river. Slowly he began to drown.
Sherlock was standing behind him, facing the window. He closed his eyes as he attempted to swallow. He felt the muscles in his throat contract and then instantly opened his eyes again. “I know this isn’t the best time to say this but…” He took a deep breath in and continued, “I must be honest with you, John.” Sherlock looked down at his shoes and waited to see if he would respond. He did not. Sherlock whispered, “Did you hear me, John?” He paused, this time looking at the back of John’s head. He was like a child waiting to be scolded by his parents.
Sherlock said again, “It is not the best time but I simply must tell you-”.
They were all curious as to who this man was. Could it be that Mycroft was telling the truth? Sherlock wasn't quite convinced. This sleuth could never believe in the mystic arts. Could he?
"Say it." Sherlock begged.
The fire portal slowly started to vanish. All that remained were traces of the tiny flares.
John found his voice and spoke, “Don’t. Stop.” One hand at his hip and the other motioned towards Sherlock pleading him to stop. He said, “Don’t do this. Not now.“
Just as John was opening the door for Sherlock, the rain started coming down again. Sherlock adjusted his coat and sat down right away. He leaned over to the driver side to push the door open for John.
Sherlock looked straight ahead and said nothing. He simply opened his door and climbed out.
"Let me see", John said as he touched Sherlock's head. "Here, I got it." He began to run his fingers through his soft dark curls. He let out a small laugh and said, "Maybe it was too much. We've never done this."
Mycroft stared at nothing but thought of many possible continuations. He hesitated a moment before finally telling the truth.
He turned off the engine and left the keys hanging. As soon as he got out, he called out to Sherlock. "What's wrong?" Seeing that he wasn't about to stop and give him an answer, he followed him.
John's eyes were wider. Despite the shock, he kept his cup steady.
John puckered his lips to one side and thought for a brief second before answering. "Eh, yeah. No, we can't stay. We have that thing with Greg tomorrow morning and the eh...the fitting for the suits." He felt guilty for lying.
John thought long and hard. Finally he said, “No, Sherlock.” Parting his lips was like trying to move mountains. “I don’t. Not like you want me to. You are…just… you are my friend, my best friend… but um…” His voice began to fail. “A friend. Nothing more.” He knew this wasn’t true but he hoped he could sound convincing. The torture of this lie was too great and he began to cry.
John was intrigued.
They were happy. Even if the truck never started again and for whatever reason they had to walk home the rest of the way, it wouldn't matter. There was nothing that could take away their bliss.
His favorite thing to do is to step out of the bedroom with the sheets wrapped around him because John once said he looked like a disheveled greek god. He had found it silly the first time he heard this but he loved the way John blushed looking at him. He would do anything to get his cheeks flushed because he loves the way his nose crinkles when he's bashful. It works every time.
Later that day, Sherlock had called his mother, something he rarely ever did, to inquire about it. He didn't get a straight answer and having felt like it was a waste of time, he quickly thanked his mother and hung up.
They couldn't hear Stephen's response but tried to make out whatever mumbles they could. They understood nothing.
Why the sudden interest?
John could flee from his desires and disappear into nothingness; the unforgiving wind his only friend. Or he could stay. Stay and relish in the fire that was their love. John was torn between what he felt in his heart and what he had to do. He could not begin to explain to Sherlock why he was obligated to leave and break his heart. He knew that if he offered any comfort it would be twice as hard to abandon him and it would certainly gaurantee his death. They were watching and he would never put his life in danger.
"Yes, mother. We promise." He kissed her forehead and let her hug him for a good while. Then off he went.
Sherlock's mouth opened a little wider. Just as he began yelling out his lover's name, he felt a rush go through his whole body and then he came. John felt the warmth of it on his hand and a little on one of his thighs. He followed right away, spilling all over Sherlock's stomach.
Sherlock loves Wednesdays because John comes home at noon and then they head over to the park. He spends the morning preparing snacks because he knows John likes to munch on food while he's sitting under a tree, admiring the clouds in the sky. He knows this because he sits and admires John.
"What is it?" John asked curiously.
John let out a sigh of relief and took the flowers from him. He looked up at him with loving eyes. Then looked down at the pretty flowers to admire their color and smell. He looked back up at him and smiled. "You've been very sweet lately. I'm not complaining but what's gotten into you?"
John felt him smile against his lips and he gave him one as well.
John had his cup of tea to his lips. Before sipping, he looked at Sherlock and raised his eyebrows while shaking his head. He was pondering on what was going through his mind because for once, after many years of being able to read him, he couldn't now. He took a small but loud sip and whispered towards him, "Love, you don't actually believe him, right? You know he's-", he stopped and made a gesture with his hand suggesting he was crazy.
"What did you think I was doing?" Sherlock asked.
Sherlock started bouncing a little in his chair and the air kisses got more lively.
"This is the lie we tell our family to account for the disappearance of... our brother."
This sent chills down Sherlock's neck and down his back. John placed his hand inside Sherlock's underwear, took ahold of his hard dick, and sprung it out. He repeated it again as he did. "Mmm, my posh boy."
It was a mixture of his slight headache and John's comment that annoyed Sherlock. "You're right. It was too much. Especially since you want to wait until our wedding night to have sex again."
John returned the hug and after a long embrace, they parted.
He likes the coffee. It's always cold but it's good.
John, still snickering, got up from his chair and walked over to sit next to Mycroft. He plotted himself on the couch and placed the back of his hand on Mycroft's forehead. "You don't have a fever. Have you been eating well? Staying hydrated, are you?" He tried to contain his giggles but failed each time.
There were no cars or houses to be seen for miles all around. They looked out the windows and noticed fog floating in behind the hill tops near them.
_______
John was quick to slip off his oxford blue flannel shirt and Sherlock assisted with the t shirt underneath.
John always said that things that are different are better because they have their own unique pattern in life. Sherlock once asked if that applied to people as well. He remembers John taking his hand, kissing it, and saying, "Especially you, my love. Especially you."
In his hand, Sherlock already had a small bouquet arranged. He looked up at his fiancée and handed him the bunch.
Sherlock, however, continued. "Let me say this. John, I’m so sorry for what’s happened. I’m sorry about your daughter…about Rosie.” He fought back tears. “I loved her, too. You know that. It was not suppose to be this way! If I could change things, I would. I’d bring her back to you, John. I would take her place, for you.” He paused for a moment to remember her laughter. If he was still hurting he knew John was too. He began to speak quickly to prevent further harm. “Being with you has been exhilarating. Being by your side has made me realize that I do feel. And, John”, Sherlock looked away for a quick second. This time he consumed the only gulp he could. Turning to face him again he said, “I feel…so much.”
They started kissing again. They both closed their eyes and as if they could read each other's thoughts, Sherlock grasped John's cock and John grabbed his.
"Promise me, Sherlock."
"I'm sorry. I am. It's just..." John bit his lip in an attempt to bury his grin. He examined his future brother-in-law. "Well, you don't actually expect us to believe this, do you?"
He peeked over to get a look at Sherlock's crotch. He saw his pants stretched over his thighs. The pleats by his pockets were wrinkled. John looked right at the center and focused on the perfectly rounded bulge. He licked his lips at the thought of his long dick popping out.
Recently, he had let his mustache grow. Sherlock wasn't fond of it and he teased him. "Why not let your beard grow too?" John accepted this rhetorical remark as a challenge.
John gave him a couple of strokes and then focused on the head. He used two fingers to circle the top. He felt precum and rubbed it all over. He used his thumb to brush the frenulum.
Sherlock swung one leg over John's waist and as he straightened up to straddle him, he bumped his head on the roof of the truck.
"Yes, I'm alright." Sherlock sat back down beside him. "I don't think this is going to work", he said as he massaged the top of his head.
"Yes and no."
John grabbed his undershirt and began to clean up both of them.
They hold each other tightly but it never seems to be close enough. No matter how long the embrace is, Sherlock can never get warm. He doesn't tell John because then he would argue about how he shouldn't eat ice cream. And Sherlock loves ice cream!
Sherlock finished taking off the rest of his shirt. He arched his back a little and titled his head to the side so John could have more of his neck to lick. He swung his arms over John's shoulders and closed his eyes.
"John, now? Are you ready now? Can I toss it?" Sherlock loves throwing in a bath bomb. His favorite is "Sex Bomb" from one of his favorite stores, Lush. Not only does he enjoy watching them dissolve, he loves the way John smells of jasmine afterwards. He feels there's no point in using one if it's not made up of powerful aphrodisiacs because bubble baths are important. He takes them very seriously.
"Hey, I thought you only wanted me to call you that when I bend you over?"
Sherlock’s voice started to fail. His hands started to tremble and his eyes started to react. The tears burned his cheeks as they rolled past down to the floor. Some were heavy like iron and they struck at his chest. He felt his heart beat faster, punching his lungs, making it harder to breathe. His thoughts were unclear of everything but this. He was not going to deny this feeling anymore. He could not. Not anymore. The only thing he fought was his own body, battling himself not to collapse.
John finally broke his trance. His eyes now focused over Sherlock’s shoulder. He didn’t say a word but his face was relaxed.
Stephen sighed into the phone and replied, "New York. Why are you acting so...strange? What trouble have you gotten into now?" He laughed gently.
Sherlock doesn't like to see John stressed out but he loves that he can help him unwind with a neck massage.
"Ow!" He cried out.
"Oh, look at this one! Baby Sherlock in a bath tub. Seems you were always fond of bubbles." John teased him. "And look here, you trying to be cute, holding your blankie."
“Yes, whatever you want,” he agreed automatically pushing his hips up.
Um, so what about that swing? It what Sherlock and John’s relationship has become. Sherlock has learned to love himself, trust himself. He is completed by his own acceptance of who he is. He is independent on his own swing. If he gets tangled in the swing, he could get hurt. If he jumped off when too high, he could too. Unlike the seesaw, it’s about his actions. With Rosie, John puts her in the child’s swing. Age appropriate. He teaches her how to swing, then let her go as high and as fast as she can. Consider the freedom of flying high in the air. As long as she and Sherlock hang on tight, they’re both in relatively safe seats.Finally, they all soar alongside and in unison, independent yet together. Safe with the ones they love.
John lets out a disgusted huff. “I knew it!” John says. “She did know!”
One the note itself.
“Why thank you, John. At least someone has manners in this home other than Martha.”
John’s mind turns to other things. Although he told them not to worry, Mrs. Hudson will most likely be in a panic by now anyway since he hasn’t returned. He’s wondering what Molly is thinking. As for Lestrade, the last time John talked to him was about Sherlock. And Sherlock? What kind of danger is he putting himself into?
______________________
“Do you plan to tell us why we’re here sometime soon?” Sherlock asks. “
As he studies, a secret smile appears on John’s lips. His eyelids flutter. It's a good dream. Sherlock hopes that smile is for him. Sherlock smiles back, and it doesn't matter that John can't see. Curled up on the bed, equally entranced is Blackbeard.
In a dream-like state, John drifted. He could hear bits and pieces of conversations. He didn’t know if they were real or imagined. In his mind he watched Moriarty walk away. John raced after him to the dorm. Like many dreams he’d had, his legs felt as if they had irons on them, holding him back. The sidewalk became a lake covered with ice. He slipped. The treacherous ice cracked beneath his feet, splintering. The lake threatened to take him beneath the ice, never to escape. He was too close to the edge. He had to warn Sherlock. He couldn’t let himself slip into the water. He concentrated on remaining upright. If he fell, he would be lost.
“Very well, get up,” she says.
"Look... I've heard all the fucking messages your brother has left for you. You need to tell me straight out why this associate professor has you so tied up in knots that you're willing to ask a favor from the brother who you've been trying to avoid for months."
“No use pushing that call button,” she says. “It’s disconnected. Not that your hands will be of any use.”
of sex he was thinking about that got him into trouble. The boys’ locker room, the Rest Area, his roommate. People got beat up and worse for what he did. He’d hoped to feel some sort of relief after letting go and giving in once again to what some call unnatural desires. Instead he felt like he was going to vomit. He couldn’t stop thinking: Did he look different? Are people staring at him and giving him the hairy eyeball? Could they tell “I’m John Watson, and I like it up the ass”? There! Someone was staring at him right now! Looking at him as if he was a freak! Did he have horns sticking out of his head?
“Oh, shut up. I have to drink tea from a tin cup.”
"Of course it's cold, John. We are locked in a freezer." He placed the bag back on the shelf and spun around, facing me.
"Whyever do we need police? We have Sherlock Holmes," she said simply, staring at her note. "The. Great. Detective," she read.
One fact he does know about his brother, Mycroft always believes his way is the only way.
Then she quit speaking. I’ve hypothesized the causes, microscopically examined each moment before she shut herself off from the world. I’ve dissected each movement, each syllable from her lips. No matter what the stimulus, she no longer answered or acknowledged anyone or anything. I was invisible. Seeing her hollow left me hollow on every visit.
John chewed his lip. That Sherlock never quite looked like he belonged in this world didn’t help at all. Moran hated him. Moriarty coveted him. The other people in the room didn’t even matter. What did matter was that John loved him, and he couldn’t risk having Moran put a bullet in his head. He didn’t think Moriarty would allow Moran to shoot Sherlock, but he couldn’t chance it. Mary began moaning—someone who definitely didn’t count. Still, he didn’t want her dead. Another moan came from her. Must be she was finally regaining consciousness.
As those lips turn up at the corners, John loves him all the more. John drags a chair over next to Sherlock’s bed and takes a seat close to his head.
"How convenient. What else do you have? Take away? And we're here why? Because Mary was going to kill me?" John spits out.
“Blood hell!” John shouts.
“I have been told I don’t have a heart.”
could be the one in the dead in the bushes or arrested for public indecency or sodomy.
Sherlock always knew dogs smiled but can now attest that cats do too. Blackbeard sits, tail motioning his new master’s sleeping form. They’ve been watching together for hours. While Sherlock isn’t licking his paws or cleaning behind his ears, he occasionally stretches his back against the door frame like a cat.
“Yeah, you are getting eaten up,” John says. "Although it might not all be by the mosquitoes. There's other things to consider. Later."
Not that John would ever blame Sherlock for pretending. God knows, John hates the fussiness of wedding planning yet he insists he's enjoying it. Sherlock knows that. Mary must. As Sherlock has told him so many times before, he's bad at hiding his feelings. He flinches, thinking about being left out of something he doesn't really want to be a part of.
I walk around Lestrade and up the stairs, and he follows me.
“What does that mean?” John presses his back into the cushion and stretches his legs out in front of him. He loves first class.
Sherlock opens his eyes almost as wide as his mouth. "Oh, John!" he sings out in a mock-falsetto voice. "Your knot is sooo big. Will it fit?" He smirks as he points his spoon at where the cords are connected.
. He doesn’t look anything like a bat. The cape somewhat resembles a bat’s wings, but the rest?
“Except it was real. The bullet was real.”
Sherlock laughs.  “Yes, but that’s not where I’m referring to.”
Of course he’s still not going to share his bloody plan! They leave the greenhouse behind, and John asks again twice before they get to the flat. Still nothing from Sherlock.
He stopped in front of the massive double doors and stared into the eyes of the lion's -head knocker. It was roughly the size of the real thing.
She ushered us through the large entryway and stared up at the staircase. We stood behind her, both looking up to see what had drawn her gaze. She seemed to change her mind, though, and began to lead us through a long hallway, deeper into the building.
“It’s possible he’s faking, but I don’t think so,” John says. “It’s directly related to his head trauma. His memory will probably return, but it’s unusual he doesn’t remember who he is— that’s more likely from psychological trauma of some sort.”
I admit that I played around with this chapter after hotshoeagain edited it, so any errors are mine!
“John, I think I’m either hyperventilating or having a heart attack.”
“Of course. But you often carry it with you like yesterday, except when you left it in your locker at hospital, then in your desk. For defense and security.”
He waits for me. Rosie waits for me. They’re both standing near the door. I hear them go down the stairs. They’ll wait. Rosie waits, but that doesn’t mean she has to like it.
"Terribly sorry about that," he said to John.
“Before I begin to explain,” he said, “you need to clear your head of preconceptions you have about life and death. It’s not what you believe, Sherlock.”
“Enough of your petty remarks,” Mycroft says. “I’m here to get your answer.”
“It’s not an interrogation, if that’s what you think. I’m preparing you. I’m merely asking you questions I know Sherlock’s mum will ask.”
Cryptic as usual. “I’m sure it was,” I say aloud to myself. I have a hollow feeling inside that Mycroft already knows, already knew.
“You’re going give him another seizure,” John says, shaking his head as he looks the dapper man up and down. It’s not what a person normally wears in this neighborhood. “Is that an umbrella?”
John’s heart races. His sister and Sophy killed Sherlock’s dog?! My god. No wonder Sherlock blocked it. John tries to see Sherlock’s reaction, but he’s half hidden from John’s eyesight beside Greg.
The lines in the creases come back to me:
We slip under the stream. The water washes over us both, and John’s arm anchors me. He soaps up a flannel and hands it to me, but not before kissing my hand. His lips press delicately to each knuckle. The water is warm, but I shiver. As the water sluices over us, he washes my back, my thighs. His circular movements and massaging fingers relax my tense muscles. Having him touch me this intimately is rapture, but it’s nothing compared to when he reaches for the shampoo. God, he washes my hair. His sure fingers massage the lather into my scalp. His doctor hands take care to ensure my stitches remain dry. All the while, we’re both aroused, our cocks bumping each other's legs and buttocks. It’s the most exquisite torture. I don’t want it to end, and I am sorely disappointed when he turns off the tap.
“This should slow you down if you try to escape,” John said as he secured him with rope through the aluminum loop on the kitchen table leg.
Sherlock nodded slowly. "That is exactly why I warned you."
“You bloody, bloody idiot.”  He pats me, then brushes his hand over my face.
John takes one look at the car and shakes his head. “No. Just, no!” he lowers his voice.
“They?” I take a seat across from him.
“I hope you plan to share afterward,” Mycroft says.
Abraham Markham hands it to me. It’s folded into the shape of a heart with my name on the front. My own heart thumps rapidly. I’ve only just remembered part of that piece of me, but I do know her handwriting.
Murder? Boring. Nothing to solve, not even minor elements of plot.
“I know you and Lestrade are good friends,” Sherlock says. “I hope what I do will not compromise your
"I'm sorry. I would give you something for the pain, but I need to know what part of your arm there is to salvage. This is despicable to let you suffer like this and allow the infection to spread as it has. We need to get your fever down."
“They would not do the same if the positions were reversed.”
“I kept him in your room when Lestrade came,” Sherlock says.
“I’m not sexist. Women are equal opportunity murderers.They also trim their nails,” William says. “This man was obviously sedated enough not give much of a fight, yet conscious enough to understand what’s was happening to him. But you already knew that, Doctor Hooper. The murderer is smart and careful.”
“What makes somebody ordinary?” Mycroft poses to John, changing the subject.
"That's good?"
“Or Anthea.” Sherlock sets the tiny device on the end table and smashes it with his thumb.
As John handed the files to Moriarty, John tried to remain stoic.
"I'm sure it is, but Mycroft has had so much practice at it," John says, crossing his arms.
“My bedroom,” John says.
“Yes, well, none taken. I guess. Anyway, Mr. Beefcake has stumped us for weeks! You know how much I hate undetermined cause of death? William Hawkins knew! Immediately!”
come on to John very strong. If it was …
“Exactly. What’s really messy is not having a solution. That’s what you want. I’m offering you more than just to help us out in the labs. You would be invaluable there, but I think solving this little serial killer case first might take the edge off before diving in. No need to involve the authorities. I have someone who’s trying to push into my territory. The end game is to frame me for these murders. It’s all been laid out neatly, the crumbs all leading to me.”
John can't wrap his head around Sherlock the wedding planner. His nods of approval have sent John reeling, beginning with the selection of the venue as Goldney Bristow. The too-bright-a-yellow reception hall wasn't enough. No. Sherlock actually high-fived Mary when she suggested including a complimentary colour on the invitations because of the cornflower blue in the wallpaper. Then Sherlock insisted that the groom's and best man's tuxedoes match. Exactly. Now the cake and her dress? Three days ago he'd even caught Sherlock folding napkins. Sherlock? Napkins? Why is he doing all this?
There was barely room to scoot between the wall and the olive steel tanker desk. With the two filing cabinets, a person could barely move between them.
do to be able to be with him again. Instead of encountering a dark formless figure that Sherlock could only feel. What wouldn't he give to see those sweaty thighs flex and shoulders strain?
John waits for Will to say more. But he grows quiet and withdraws into that place where he goes. It makes John worry all the more for him.
Over the years, I've had cadaver feet in my bed, faux-blood oozing out of my toothpaste tube, and pickled eyeballs in my pork pie. I doubted this was about an unsolved murder. More like an elaborate game to terrify me on—as he always put it—All Hallow's Eve.
“We haven’t decided on a name. Yet,” Sherlock says, rubbing the cat’s head.
Sully doesn’t have the clean, clear sands of Whitesands Bay, but Sherlock prefers this. Along the dark stoned beach, are sandy coves where he’d play as a child. He’d bring his copy of
"No!" John shouts.
“I don’t remember you. I don’t remember much. I don’t know why,” he says, honestly. Anthea’s seems to be convinced that he doesn’t remember. “I need something. Some proof that you’re really Anthea.”
Sherlock scowled. He never turned his back on him as he hung his coat in the corner.
John blushes beautifully, and Sherlock feels a bit of heat in his own cheeks as they race up the stairs, open the door, and slip inside. Coats, scarves, and shoes come off fast at the door between quick kisses.
Twenty minutes later and each with a cup of tea, we sat in the parlor as Sherlock explained to Marilyn whose hand was in the freezer and why Brutus was killed.
Four black bean-bag chairs joined the throw pillows on the floor. John hated those squishy chairs. When he sat down, he had to crawl out of the damn things. He hated that they were the only options people had here. He’d either had to sit in one of them, or the lone aluminum folding chair at the desk. Or one of the beds.
"How do you do that?"
John waits until Sherlock nods to him that the room is clean. “Other than riling up Greg and making it look like you’re on the outs so Sophy can hear you through her listening devices, you’re just flying by the seat of your pants, aren’t you?”
“Nice to see you,” he says to Sherlock, warming his hands with his breath.
Moriarty stood back up, brushing off his trousers. His eyes never left the body as he circled it. Both kept an ear toward Lestrade as he talked to the boy who had been the one to discover the woman's body—or what was left of it. The lad had mistaken the corpse for a tossed-out mannequin until he'd stepped closer. Lestrade had taken him aside to calm him.
He gave me a cocky grin. “I would love one,” he said.
As he inspects Blackwood, he scans the room for clues. A struggle. All that was once on top of his desk, is on the floor, the side desk drawer is open with a service revolver still in place. His mind unravels it. A frame. Not for Sophy, but him. It’s all too clear. She thinks he’ll be completely dependent on her now. To hide him from authorities, keep him, manipulate him. Blackwood knew his killer, that is certain. Then he sees the wound on his neck. A scratch. The killer broke a nail. He runs his hands and inspects the floor. Nothing. Then he remembers, the woman at the desk with the freshly done nails.
. I practically choked on the words, recalling that day he trapped me.
“Oh, don’t play innocent. You know very well what bomb. The bomb Sherlock strapped to your chest.”
It could be worse. He could be in another country instead of a few miles away from John. One thing he didn’t want to be was a man like the old fisherman. He didn’t want to become a man filled with regrets and what-ifs.
Will rolls his eyes."I slept, and just like I do every few nights, I had a dream that seemed important. It
I, who used to live for the game, feel numb. I want no part of this. Not from her.
"What? I thought we weren't going to play Mycroft's games any more."
"As it states in your note, your love was forbidden and kept a secret from your disapproving parents. This was the story that your lover told you long ago and had you write down."
“His fifth birthday,” Mummy says. “Little Myc so loved his ‘fuzzy-wuzzies,’ as he called them. He wore them even after his big toes poked out of the seams. He insisted that Dad cut off the feet so could keep wearing them. Before he gave them up, the sleeves were up to Myc’s elbow and feet to his knees. Even then, he kept them under his pillow until he was twelve.”
Later, as William follows behind John upstairs to his new room, he strains to look around the crate to see John’s nice, “round bottom” that he’d heard nurses speak about at hospital. He’d listened to them appreciate John’s “good features” along with his “good nature.” William recalls a touch of annoyance when nurse Sarah slipped John a note in his scrub pocket. He must remember to remove it and throw it away.
James enjoyed inflicting pain. James was like old man Rogers who lived near their family home who had laughed as he drowned stray cats in his well. Rogers would taunt young Sherlock, believing that Sherlock shared that love. But he didn't. Sherlock loved cats. He hated hearing their cries for help. He would cover his ears and cry.
“Nice?” Sherlock asks with a soft smile.
“You haven’t said much about
"At first I think she actually believed you'd been kidnapped. I was most convincing. And it was true. You
"What good is a pretty face if I am dead? I can't do anything in my current state. My ability is fettered. I need medical treatment."
"Do keep telling yourself your little fairy tales. I will never understand your fascination with that psychopath. I was so hoping your new dalliance with your roommate would let you put aside this obsession."
Sherlock deduced that John's quilt must mean something similar. The frayed edges were carefully mended, and the original fabric patches in subtle floral patterns of browns and blues were patched with clashing purple and orange fabric scraps. Tattered and faded from years of a little boy dreaming beneath, it had been kept alive with caring hands.
be practical."
“You must accept this fact," Merlin says. "If you do not, a time will come when you no longer care about living. Remember this pain and this loss. Living the lie of who you are, an alchemystic, you must also accept. You are omega. Embrace that, but hide what you are. While you may be forced to hide it from the world, never hide it from yourself. Do not become the abomination the word sees within your own mind."
“Yes, why? Why do most murderers move their victims?”
“Yes, and it shouldn’t be.”
Sherlock head jerks up. Note?
Even as he hears John say this, Sherlock knows John would never shirk his duties to family or friends.
“Oh, and you think the street is a better? Are you coming back to your room quietly or do I need to call an orderly?”
"John, come back. Without a life or death situation, our union will never come to pass." He wasn't making much sense. Or maybe he was just too hard to understand with his teeth chattering.
“Yes, that’s the young man.”
John knew that for the rest of his life he would know that what had happened between them was more than just some hand job and a hot mouth. At least on his part, he felt love—or he thought he did. And for that one special summer, for the very first time, John had felt happy.
“I abhor people.”
The lagoon is spectacular, and it's easy to lose track of the time. The sun is high, the sand is blindingly white, and the aquamarine water has emerald green patches like glass. John can vividly see the life beneath. He wishes he knew the names of the colorful fish. He had little time to appreciate them on his little trip in from the freighter.
This time it was Sherlock who stopped Marilyn. With his foot in the door.
Mom would still plant petunias and marigolds. Three weeks later after his dad was finally fired, John thought that one good thing might follow from it: his father couldn't afford to go to John's Tavern.
The chair was either very relaxing or he’d been … “drugged,” John said.
“You removed the modicum tempus. You can perform the seal,” I suggest.
, now he’s just excited to show John his beloved childhood memories. John’s looks handsome and rugged wearing khakis and an old, grey Nirvana t-shirt. Sherlock feels just as comfortable dressed in worn jeans and his usual blue scrub shirt. He remembers a time when he only wore designer clothes. Life changes.
Sherlock tenses, and at first John fears he’s pulling away—  that this is all too much for him. Then Sherlock’s spine lifts in invitation. He stifles a cry, and John thinks again, maybe it is too much. But Sherlock own hand joins John’s with a growl, and he thrusts through their fingers. John’s free hand grasps Sherlock’s soft, silky curls. His own breath breaks, and he shivers along with Sherlock as he comes in his hand.
He stands in his old room before they depart and straightens his collar in his old dresser mirror. He’s changed since the last time he saw himself in its reflection. Over five years ago, he came to this room an unhappy man. Ten before that a confused young man on holiday from uni. As a boy, he stood in front of it in his pirate hat. But never Eurie, not this dresser.
Grateful moans of deliverance escaped him. “You are a genius, John. It no longer feels as if I was boiling my hand in hot oil!”
At Mycroft's name, Sherlock nods and, after refilling his rehydration bottle, leaves him to rest. A few hours later John wakes again to Sherlock checking the wound on his leg.
“I told your brother this. I spoke to her twice. The first time she came to see Mary and I. The second, I spoke to her alone. She gave me the note then.”
He sets the glass aside, and his hand trembles adjusting the drip on my IV. I see a story behind this beyond his obvious injury to the shoulder. It’s then that I notice my own arm. My automail is also gone!
He would think it would be some sort of French name, not Spanish. He recalls that it means hope or expectation. What does that bloody mean?
“I never thought of it as that,” John says, picking up his newspapers and notes off the coffee table next. He sets them on the counter next to his open laptop.
“He might not be happy, but he needs to know who he can trust. We all need to know who we can trust.”
"Any sand is too sandy," Sherlock says. "It would be miserable. I don't want to chance opening that wound. But we did pass that bungalow."
“I’d like to know who I can’t trust,” Greg says.
"You're not alone in this, you know. You made a friend in Molly today. And Lestrade texted earlier, still working on your ID."
“I did read that it’s important children remain hydrated,” I say.
John hasn’t been tested this much since he was in uni. Sherlock Holmes presents one exam after another. Each time, the course changes.
Sherlock thrusts his hips. Cocks slip and slide together, the heat from the friction builds between them. Sherlock could time it all, but he lives for the feeling instead. The sweat on their bellies and thighs mingle as they push together again and again and again. Skin on skin.
Sherlock only caught bits and phrases from them after that such as “he means well” and “he’s clueless” and “lovable arse.” Then they giggle. And point. At him. He doesn’t recall Anthea ever smiling at all before this.
I am most sorry for your current circumstances, but know that it was imperative that I remove you from danger immediately. I trust you will find the accommodations to your liking. I will be in contact with you and explain all as soon as the threat has passed. Until then, know that what I have done, I have done for your own well-being.
"He's dehydrated from the fever, and this automail arm needs to come off. It's gangrenous where it’s attached. I'll need to remove most of what's left of his real arm to the shoulder. He'll require new automail since the tissue around it is putrid. A new semi-blood seal will have to be formed. God, knows if I can even find an alchemist to do it."
-------------------------
He lets go of my hand as I open the car door. “I must do this alone.”
Sherlock
He wants this. Sherlock inside him, filling him. Sherlock kneels behind him. The air around them is hot and humid, but full of Palmyra's perfumes: the sweet flowers, the sand and sea. All flood his senses. Even his own breathing mingles with the sound of the water in the lagoon lapping against the side of the boat.
“I didn’t expect he would be at the table too,” John says.
“Yes, yes,” I huff a sigh of indignation. “Feet in this pail and you add cement. I do so love the Thames. Never thought it would be my final resting place. It does fit in with the cesspool of criminals that are drained into it. I, however, do not intend to be one of them.”
“Ready?” John says, bounding through the door.
As he splashes across an inlet, he notes how deep the water is. It's only to his ankles, but he doesn't want to be stranded on one of these smaller islets when the water rises. He keeps close track of where he's been and where his ketch is moored. He's surprised how the tide rises and falls. It's slow and steady. As the afternoon progresses, he finds an airstrip, although it's overgrown with the fern that covers the islands along with other foliage John isn't familiar with. It clearly hasn't been used in some time.
"Show yourself," Magnus orders.
Sherlock can’t help smearing what's left of the ice cream around John’s arse. With a gasp, he pushes his cock completely into John until his thumbs are on each side at the root of his cock. He regains control, inhaling and exhaling slowly until he's centered, then pushes in and pulls out with purpose.
That night I lay awake in my bed. I know what I have to say to John. There is so much I haven’t said. But with this new discovery, I feel as if it will be what drives John away. I try to put that out of my mind until I have the link. Instead, I think about the characteristics on the blog and my John the BAMF. John has a need for sustenance, for information. He loves it when I deduce, but I love his reaction to me more.
"I assure you, John, that I don't believe that I'm a superhero."
Sherlock knows he could be off with his paces by a foot or possibly two but within minutes of digging...
stop laughing.” Sherlock snaps his hips and hits John’s prostate with precision. “Is this working?”
some psychopathic killer? A Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde? He’d remember, wouldn’t he? Or he’d leave some evidence behind. Perhaps he did, he thinks. Perhaps he has hidden things from himself, scraped the incriminating soil off of his shoes, washed the tell-tale hairs off of his clothes.
“Aren’t you two cozy!” she says, taking a seat at the edge of the bed. “I guess I didn’t understand completely how things have changed between you. I must admit I rather expected as much.”
“And there are no police waiting outside your room thanks to us,” Molly says. “You need to get better. Let’s concentrate on that.”
“I know why, and there’s no other reason why you should be reluctant to tell me. I know this has to do with Mary, and that’s why you’ve been holding back.” I open my eyes to see John shooting me daggers. ”Vivian Norbury did know Mary, but there’s more isn’t there? A lot more.”
There were even some surprises: Summers visiting “Skully” Island were really Sully Island. Pictures of Eurus and Helena on the beach. Memories of Redbeard at his feet. Scenes of Christmases long ago.
Sherlock stripped down to his skivvies and climbed into the top bunk.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And you’re just telling me this now?”
“You’re always in the middle of some experiment. Waiting for you to come to your senses is so tedious.” He tapped his shoes on the floor. “You’ve become boring with your little playmate. He is rather cute. Such lovely blond locks and puppy dog eyes, but I bet he bites.”
John moans between them, and Sherlock’s hands itch to touch him, to find out if he is well, but to do that would put John in more peril.
"Sure you were."
“That is does.”
I think John reads this jump in my mind. He seems to understand me--as much as anyone possibly could. While I don’t forget his concern for me is that of a doctor for his patient, I can’t help but feel that there’s more.
“What about Beca Bellin? Even if she is the most unconventional hospital director that ever was, she should know. She paid for the cameras in the locker room— even though I wondered if it had more to do with her seeing a few of the younger docs starkers. You probably should tell her. I wouldn’t be surprised if she didn’t already know. After you got her all riled up to solve the thefts. Said they were…” Mike makes air quotes. “‘
.” John turns from Sherlock, ignoring his own pain and kneels down next to Sophy. He puts pressure on her chest, and she manages a strangled laugh, blood bubbling up from her lips.
"I am not a cold-blooded contract assassin who once worked for James Moriarty."
I borrowed Mike’s car to help move him in. We had a bit of excitement on the way home when I took this wrong turn, but all went well in the end.
As he got to the podium, John was staring straight into Doyle's eyes.
I scream. “Please, no!” It’s the same long and loud and pitiful cry I made during the botched transmutation when Alphons and I tried to bring back our mother. Like that day, there is no answer to my screams. No one cares, no one hears.
“Mmm,” she says. “I want ta-toes.”
—————————
"In that case, it's impossible. No hospital. The master would rather let him die."
“You are, and so quick to deny it.” He looked down at his watch. “I must run. I have another appointment.”
"Yet," I said.
“And find some way to see him.”
“Ah, yes. Anthea. I spoke to her. I did need a bit more concealer to cover
"Too hard. I don't want it to damage your leg further."
A fiddle? John wasn't sure what to say to that. He wasn't much into country music. But no. Sherlock wouldn't be into country. More like classical music. That wasn't that much better in John's mind.
“So, we’re both just slumming in the psych department,” she said, and nudged him playfully in the side.
“Get out! Just get out!” Lestrade stands, slamming his fist on his desk.
John laughs as William snaps the lock back. “You’re brilliant.”
In this new real, I hear muffled voices exchange, but it sounds as if I'm still buried deep within the cave.
John and Art know it’s happening before Sherlock seems to. His pale eyes begin to roll back and his arms and legs quake. It’s terrifying for John to witness and be unable to help. Art gently lies Sherlock down flat and monitors him carefully. He’s not convulsing, and it’s over as fast as it started. John’s relieved to see that Sherlock remains conscious although disoriented.
John looked up at the clock. It had been over fifteen minutes since Mary went to get the coffee. It was taking her longer than he expected. Must be she had to make another pot. Despite how ground-breaking this study they’d be working on was, John couldn’t feel too excited about it. His mind kept returning to Sherlock, and also to the fact that he’d come here to quit.
"My arm is being rejected," I say slowly. "I have a serious infection. I am an adept alchemist, I am of no use in this condition. If I do not receive medical treatment, the infection will spread and I will die. I will be of no value to you."
Markham’s face turns bright red. “Well, that was embarrassing,” he says.
“One would think he would be over his infatuation, but he seems to carry with him a romantic notion that you killed yourself jumping off the campus clock tower to spare him,” Mycroft answered.
“You know why,” I say. “They thought they needed the money to run away. Your husband disapproved of your daughter's boyfriend, forbidding her to see him. They planned to just leave the fake ransom note, but your husband found it on the table in the foyer when he came home from work early. He heard a crash from upstairs, dropped his keys, and rushed to your daughter’s bedroom. Your daughter and boyfriend had already ripped through the room, throwing the bedspread and sheets off the bed, brushing objects off tables, breaking the mirror and lamp in an attempt to make it look as if there was a struggle. Poor attempt, obviously staged. The broken lamp was thrown against the wall.”
"She doesn't remember. She has anterograde amnesia."
"You should stay far away from him," Sherlock said. "Far, far away. I'd say another county, but I'll grant you that wouldn't be practical."
Moran scooted the rocking chair closer to the fireplace with his leg.
“In my quest to procure rare elements, I often had to go in disguise. It would not be wise to come as the one of the heirs to a pharmaceutical empire since I often met with felonious and nefarious persons along the way. I also look incredible in tights.”
I even missed my pain in the arse brother Mycroft! God, at that moment, I wanted to see his face again. He did love me despite his insistence that caring was a weakness. He was to be executed by the State for opposing the government, and I never told him I cared.
She got her jean jacket, and John unhooked his. Mary reached out and touched one of the sleeves.
who lashed out at
Sherlock had known he would do this. From the moment he'd heard about it, he'd known. He was bored, and it sounded a bit dangerous.
The second Sherlock said it, John had already blown off his warning to stay away. He was intent on finding out more about Moran and Moriarty. He'd be damned if he didn't at least try. If they happened to show up at his work-study, John was going to find out all he could.
.  Now he’s crying too.
I’d loosened the cement considerably with my earlier jiggling and jouncing. It was possible that I could work my way out of the concrete since my socks and shoes and ankles were loose enough. The bucket slips off the plank, but catches on the next. I
He began tapping the pen again. John wondered if it was some sort of nervous habit.
“I know the feeling,” John adds with a sigh.
"I have some entertainment for you, too. A message from your
As John put on his coat and stepped to the edge of the doorway, a maniacal giggle echoed into the cabin.
He expected it. He’d watched the nurse on call carefully— a young man too stupid to deceive Sherlock, yet he hadn’t seen it happen. Conclusion: IV was tagged and tainted when the nurse hooked up the bag.
His eyes open to the sound of...someone else. He doesn't recall crawling to the ketch. He turns his head to see a mop of black curly hair and a lanky form in cut-off shorts and t-shirt. He's also as pink as a lobster.
“Sophy, do shut up,” Mycroft says.
It’s also not Sophy’s, Sherlock thinks. He’s seen her writing. He has an example of it hidden in his pocket. As Molly, Beca, and Anthea talk, Sherlock half listens to their discussion while his mind races, thinking about John. Sherlock messages him again. This time to tell him there is another victim. John answers.
John had stopped playing. He was thinking. Thinking about how to answer the question.
He never followed them. Instead, he'd imagine what seamy acts they were committing: who was on their knees? Who was taking it up the ass? What makes a man come to this place for sex? But John knew why. He just wasn't brave enough to be one of them. Yet.
I almost missed her looking down at her note again. This was even more puzzling..
Most of the theater was cleared, few people were still leaving. John stubbornly remained seated with Mary still seated next to him.
“I’ll take that under advisement.”
"Come," John says breathlessly.
It is not irony that Mary would fake her death as I had. Irony is not planned.
He’s pushing her in the high-backed bucket swing. It hugs her safe and secure. As usual she’s singing out, “High!”
Another challenge was that it has been a long time since I’d written a story by the seat of my pants. Writing and posting as I go was once my usual method, but over the last five years, I’ve been plotting out most of my stories. I haven’t written piece by piece where I let the story take me for a ride since I’d written in the
Sherlock can’t help recalling the other words he’d said during his performance. About love. He’s twitching a bit himself overthinking why he even said such a thing. It seemed like an excellent idea when he said it. In retrospect, he may have gone into the not good area.
But I had to write it down here because I want you to read it. You need to know you’re important and that I want this or whatever it is even though I could do without that brother of yours. For your sake, I’ll try not nut him again.
“You do know me, at least, who I was,” he said.
“They tell me to fuck off, cross themselves, or say I have the third eye.”
----------------------------------
John watches as the Sherlock reluctantly lets the paramedic check his pulse and blood pressure.
--------------
Blowing out a trail of gray smoke, he shot yet another glance at the bathroom stall wall. The words were still there. No one had carved over them. The words screamed out at John, but would someone actually answer them? Once again, he felt the strong pull—his secret need—a pull stronger than any other he'd felt in his life.
John nods his head, but he adds nothing. No comments about his sexuality. He’s not bothered to address it. In fact, it’s been years since he’s bothered to say a word at other’s innuendos. Instead a small smile plays on John’s lips. I think he finally understands the sting his words had on me, or is it possible that he cares for me on a deeper level? A rush of hope takes hold of me once again.
A thorough visual external examination comes first. Sherlock determines more with the clothes on than without. He sees a middle-class male in his sixties, hair recently trimmed, well-groomed salt and pepper beard, teeth perfect. Molly is correct. The crescent shaped marks on his neck aren’t older, the coloring is wrong. His face is congested and cyanotic. The skin on his upper eyelids blotched with petechiae— round clusters of blood pooled under the skin’s surface. This happened recently. Tailored suit, posh. Shoes designer, but older. On the sole they have the same sawdust. Sherlock’s mind automatically turns to the lumber yards, but what if it’s as simple as a home woodshop? A private place, lure him there, then kill him. Dump the body elsewhere. He removes the clothes from the body when he finds a note. Not one sewn or pinned, just slipped into his pocket. It’s the same dress shirt the others wore. On the note was written: “Join us or John is next.”
Sherlock first took in those powerful legs, made that way from all of the running they did. John still had his shirt on but it was ridden up exposing bits of his abdomen. Most importantly John was hard, his length jutting proudly from his body. The liquid gathering at the tip begging for a touch of Sherlock’s tongue. Sherlock bent his head forward without hesitation, but was stopped when John’s hand pushed against his shoulder halting any further action.
It had the beginnings of an erotica novel. John once again hit down on the delete button with more vigor than the key really required. He ran a hand shakily through his hair and tried to find a new way of introducing what had happened. The doctor attempted to bring up the rest of the details to the case, but found his memories were blurred with his constant thought of Sherlock having a go of it on the couch. John glared at the couch like it was the culprit to this entire mess. How had Sherlock solved it? A misplaced blank sticky note. Maybe just figure out the beginning later and start with the middle and end of it.
Sherlock was tapping his foot. Whatever patience had been there was quickly evaporating. He was ready for a new more interesting subject while John was left feeling fascinated. “If you’d like to talk about romanticism and conquests I’d suggest inviting Garret for a pint.”
Sherlock gave him a bright electric glance from the corner of his eyes. “If I’d known you were going to repeat yourself I’d have said no to the first question.”
“Ridiculous.”
His skin may have been permanently dyed the color of cherries. “No.” It wasn’t exactly a lie. He hadn’t thought of it at all until two days ago.
John went over to the fridge before his mind could dance in any unwanted directions. “Tea?”
Because those things, weren’t real. Sherlock pushed himself up from the blankets that he had been laying under for too long. An achy haze settling over him as he forced his eyes open to take in the surroundings The stench in the air was  not John,  but dirt and grime. Crackheads milling about. Most of them laying down in the half dream state that Sherlock had been in. He was still high, could feel the opiates pounding through his system. It was all for the sake of a case of course, is what he told himself.  The drugs made him think things he didn’t normally allow himself to think, take him so deep into his mind palace that it felt real. It all felt real until this moment.
“You told me you were married to The Work,” John breathed, just the slightest hitch in his breath to indicate anything was going on with him. Both of their eyes roved over each other and Sherlock couldn’t just stand here and talk when John’s language worked so much better. He crowded John stepping into his space. Making him backpedal towards the sofa. Sherlock watched as John’s pupils were blown wide by the action.
“How many experiments have you conducted?”
“I know,” John said and it was the wrong words, but Sherlock didn’t care as John came off of the sofa to sit down next to him. Sherlock pushed himself closer. “I want it to always be like this.”
John gave Sherlock a hard look that the detective pretended to be oblivious of until, with a huff, he picked up the baked good and began peeling away the liner. Sherlock did so with precision, slowly making his way clockwise until it had been completely removed.
John handed Sherlock his cuppa. Their hands lingered, always lingering. John was the first to draw back and sit in his seat. Sherlock pursed his lips and studied the contents of his mug, savored it’s warmth. John’s hands were warm, they had calluses from too many jumped over fences, hand grasping last calls, and familiarizing itself with its owner’s gun on a near daily basis. He had strong hands Sherlock decided. There were no traces on his palms to tell where else they had been today.
“Yes.” When John made no other movements, “Thank you.”
“Quiet. You shouting your internal monologue is interrupting my concentration.”
“Are you asking me about sex, John?” There was a definite glimmer of amusement as Sherlock continued staring down the instrument. He paused to scribble notes continuing not to look at his flatmate directly. The disregard displayed was perhaps the most frustrating aspect of it all.
“Are you sure?”
John quickly backspaced that line of thought out of existence. It had only half been a joke. He couldn’t be the only one in the world that when faced with this, found it completely bizarre and life altering. Life altering perhaps was a strong statement, maybe perspective changing. This wasn’t what his audience craved. They enjoyed the narrative of their adventures together. Alright, so maybe a lot of their audience would welcome that kind of post. A confirmation that they possibly, in some kind of realm in which Sherlock is normal enough to do...
I didn’t think I’d get here at some points during this year, but here is the final chapter of An Average Person’s Perspective! Thank you to everyone who stuck along with me through this and to newer readers as well. Every comment has deeply been appreciated. Thank you as well to
John didn’t seem to find anything wrong, waiting there patiently. “It was simple,” he reiterated drumming his hands along the arm chair and resisting the urge to bounce his leg up off the ground. In that moment Sherlock was grateful for the imaginary barrier the kitchen presented. He needed to think.
“Breakfast?” Sherlock ignored this question in favor of the slides. He took out a new one and held it up in the little natural light that was trickling in. “Sherlock.”
“Well get on with it,” John said in a teasing manner. Sherlock continued to stare down at John willing the words to come. His gaze was unwavering, he wouldn’t move from this spot until he had said it. He watched as John grew ‘uncomfortable.’ His darker eyes sliding away as his face started flush. Sherlock could practically hear the pounding.
The plan was to sort out his thoughts. Figure out why he couldn’t stop thinking about the event that had taken place in their living room and from there find a way to get rid of the thoughts all together. He made little headway, and the next morning admitted defeat.
John was left with a cold sinking feeling as Sherlock pulled away, his footsteps receding into the kitchen. This went beyond the usual embarrassment the detective sometimes caused and into the waters of humiliation.
. I say that because she fell for your food pun related pick-up line. Really, John? You might as well have been reading some of your poetry. Interestingly, you’ve rescheduled on her twice and intend to cancel without picking out a new date. Why? You find being distracted on dates by cases and my well being moderately acceptable, but thinking about another man touching his cock while at dinner may be considered a bit rude. Don’t worry, I don’t misunderstand that for anything other than human curiosity. That’s not the only reason you are canceling, you are also bored. Sick of the niceties, politeness, and practically scheduled sexual intercourse and masturbation. You want excitement and barely any of
“Hmmm,” Sherlock hummed with a musical quality so that the end uplifted. “No you weren’t.” John only then chanced a look up at his flatmate. The detective was looming over him with a face that would have been blank if it wasn’t for the narrowed quality of his eyes. There was a razor edge to the blue-green that left John feeling like he’d been stabbed in the gut. All warmth and the escape of blood he didn’t know how to control. John turned away in a hurry.
"The violin."
"And it's unlikely they ever will. Hence the title."
“God! You are going to kill me.”
I take a deep breath. John is waiting for me to continue, to explain. I closed my eyes, recalling that day. I was in the early stages of heat when the sudden grinding and shrieking of chamber doors being forced open with jimmy bars rocked me with panic.
They spend the rest of the morning reading and researching at lightning broadband speed. Sherlock jokes with John, and John winks back at him. John is flirting. At least Sherlock thinks he is.
"I will."
“That’s too bad, but the place we’re staying is nice.”
He shoved his hands under his armpits to keep them warm. He wasn’t certain if they were shaking from cold or from what Sherlock just revealed.
Doctor Bellin met with me. I'd hoped she was going to congratulate me for being right about the thief after all. Too much to hope, I suppose. She jumped right over that bit and told me she was hiring him as morgue attendant! Not entirely what I was expecting. Then she rattled off these reasons.
She laughs. “But you could appreciate the artistry. I know that. I must say I’m glad you decided not to bring any company; I did think our meeting for tomorrow night might include a few extras, Mr. Holmes, although I am still a bit wary.”
It’s true, but I don’t know what to say to him.
He was right— she was a bit older.
Sherlock strode through, and I behind him.
"That was different. The seizure," John observes. Sherlock nods.
Sherlock's lips are even softer than before as they whisp against his. He doesn't think he's ever coveted a kiss more. If he had a mind palace like Sherlock's, he'd save it in a special room. He hopes that's what Sherlock is doing right now.
He doesn't get far before he realizes he should have brought one of the sun hats and looked around to find more appropriate footwear. He grabs a dried palm frond and uses it to shade his head.
They continue sleeping next to each other. They've only kissed and held each other—Sherlock's still treating John as if he might break.
When John comes back down, the tea is made and waiting on the coffee table. I almost make a I’m a Little Teapot joke, but he sits down on the couch and picks up his mobile. Before he takes a sip, he frowns as he reads the text.
He cracks me hard in the face with the side of the Glock. Blinding pain bursts through my eye socket and cheek. My head flies back—an excellent opportunity to rock the chair and move my feet and legs.
Sherlock is surprised to see Anthea walk in with Beca just as the examination is completed.
No way he’d go back to get something warmer. He needed to be away from Sherlock. John’s first reaction had been to hit him in the face. He could go to the library, or early to work study. He wasn’t scheduled to work until two o’clock, but East Hall was closer.
I sluggishly walked over to him. Instead of wrapping his coat around me to share the warmth, he spun around and waltzed over to the other side of the freezer.
He falls sleep, thinking about Sherlock and taking chances.
“It drifted against the door,” John observed.
"Maybe I should spread these lovely legs and bind your ankles." Sherlock sits on his haunches between John's thighs to admire his captive. "You shaved them just for me." He runs his hands up John's calves, over his knees, and caresses the top of his legs. "So smooth."
-------------------------
“Did I give you? I’m not telling!” she sings out. “Guess! Oh, but you can’t. That mind of yours is all a-jumble!”
“And miss out on biscuits and tea? Of course he is!”
He could never predict John's words or actions as he could other people's. Why just yesterday morning, Sherlock was sleeping when John dangled a white bag with Bagel Fragel written on the front over his head. As he climbed down from the top bunk, Sherlock was skeptical, but then John reached inside the bag and handed him the best bagel Sherlock had ever tasted. Who knew that Ann Arbor could offer such wonders as the Fragel, a deep-fried raisin packed dough covered in cinnamon and sugar that melted in his mouth? And the coffee?
like my sister.”
Better to hide. John kept his head down, his neck tucked, and eyes on his feet the rest of the way to his work-study program.
He welcomes John as he takes the last step, and they stand toe-to-toe. He wants to stop thinking. John has been so careful of Sherlock since he came home. Like he’s going to break in two.
“I see our new patient affects you the same way he affects most of the staff here,” John observes.
Almost. He needed one bit of further proof. He could be nosy, or he could just ask.
When he burst into the dorm room and set the bag on the chair next to the bed with a flourish, John didn't make eye contact at all. Instead, he sat on his bed, legs crossed, his eyes fixed on his biology book. Sherlock walked around next the bed to get his attention, but John continued to read—or seemed to read.
“Papa!” she chimes from upstairs behind the baby gate that is now entirely useless. She scales over it and navigates the stairs backward and bottom first at least once daily. I go up to see how she is, and end up reading to her. I keep listening for the door downstairs. John is taking far longer than I had anticipated. I’ve found Rosie’s attention span when reading far exceeds the usual toddler’s I have researched. Rosie is obviously advanced. I am able to read the entirety of
John looks up to see Will standing in front of a large map of Cardiff bus routes which he has pinned to the wall and is marking up with a series of lines. He's holding three pens of different colors and apparently needs a fourth. "I thought you said you
“A pirate? You mean, besides yourself?” John chuckles, the corner of his mouth turning up.
“It’s been brief. For the most part I was searching for who I was and found that there are hundreds of thousands looking for loved ones in London alone, but nothing about me.”
“No one’s going to die,” John says.
“I would feel more comfortable at our place,” Sherlock says, and John’s face heats up like he’s been caught. “When it gets light out, we should go there.”
John’s body is a shambles, but he's all smiles and sighs and shaking limbs. He murmurs Sherlock’s name as his love collapses next to him. A moment later, Sherlock begins to gently untie the cords.
"This summer. I had, well, sex." Although the tone in John's voice didn't reveal much to Sherlock, his eyes did. He looked past Sherlock, eyes foggy. He was remembering, remembering that night.
John stretches his legs out on the bed. Kicking the quilt aside, he twirls the cords in his hands, then begins practicing tying knots. He finishes a bowline and tests it, snapping the cord tight.
The floor shakes, the cave trembles, crumbles, and crashes down. The heritage of all alchemystics, the founding Omega and Alpha Primoras, are buried beneath rubble. A stalactite breaks loose above me. My feet refuse to budge and allow me to escape. I am already speared in place, the target of its fall.
It was that day, too, that John notes that the sharks only seem to traverse the channels that rise and lower with the tide. He surmises that it's their feeding ground.
“I didn’t believe it either. That’s why I thought the whole experience was a hallucination. Then one of them came to me again. About a week before Mary shot me, I was browsing in that old bookshop I love in Soho. One of the same angels who visited me in Afghanistan took me aside and told me I would need a new vessel.”
The Personal Blog of Dr. John H. Watson
“What?!”
And he is decidedly alpha, his pheromones fill my senses, and it's a far more satisfying drug than I have ever taken.
It was only this morning that they kissed and held each other. It seemed so simple then. But life isn’t simple and happiness never lasts. Not for John Watson.
? Dear, dear. I never expected to hear that American slang from your lips. What would mummy say?”
“Your voice sounds so familiar.” I was dizzy and felt light headed. This couldn’t be happening.
Sherlock shook his head. This wasn’t the reaction he wanted from John. He was upset, distrurbed. What game was James playing?
"John. Give me a moment. I can say the words." Even with his resonant, deep voice he had to shout it. His coat whipped around him.
"Yes, Dr. Watson. We
When they reach the warehouse doors, they drop me while the accomplice unlocks and the scissor doors push open, it’s stubborn and the casters groan their reluctance. My captors’ distraction proves advantageous. It’s long enough to send John a fast text message. I roll on my side. I’ve messaged in more awkward positions. They don’t notice. Idiots.
“Yes, you did. The entire death scene was staged, made to look as if you were killing me. She didn’t take the bullet for me. It was intended for her. She jumped into the shot. She thought it wasn’t real, but you wanted her dead. Gone forever. Real bullets.”
Since I had on a warm jumper, I held out my leather jacket to Ellen, the woman who had opened the door for us and still followed. Sherlock was wearing one of those thin silk shirts of his that barely stayed buttoned. He shook his head and kept his Belstaff.
"Vices. Yeah." John's eyes locked on to Sherlock's mouth as he polished off the last bite of sandwich.
"Please," John says.
John always says he’s brilliant and clever. Sherlock loves those words. He preens and purrs at them. Sometimes he thinks he may be too clever. John believes he’s going off with Sophy along with Sherlock. Just how keen would John be to know he was the bait, the final nudge, to get Sherlock’s supposed cooperation from her? Mycroft understood Sherlock’s intentions regarding John and his plan. John did not.
Sherlock stares at the door, deep in thought. John looks down at their hands together and gives a squeeze, then softly brushes his thumb across Sherlock’s knuckles.
“Sherlock could do these magic tricks. Sleight of hand. He was so clever.”
"Hmm, it's in her long term memory. But that's not much help if we're human ice lollies by the time she finds the note."
“You insisted that I remove it. I believe your exact words were, 'rip it off.' It wouldn’t have mattered ... I had to take it off. You wouldn’t have survived if I’d left it attached."
Sorry this chapter took so long. Real life getting in the way (a lot of us have had this happen lately). Here it is!
Sherlock smiles like a little boy on Christmas. "Yes, John, pirates. A Spanish pirate ship, the
John leads him through our home, and Rosie verifies my earlier conclusion and squeals, “Kitty! It’s a kitty!”
Take out it was. The prices here were reasonable—at least that was what Molly had said. While Sherlock did tend to forget to eat, he never forgot to pay John back.
“Well, don’t
John recalls the fences and cryptic warning signs he'd seen when he found the sea turtle pond during his first week here. So many dangers for a seeming paradise.
“You are bluffing, Mr. Holmes. Any other reason in particular for your change of plans?” she asks.
(See the end of the chapter for
Two pairs of legs poked through at the top of the snowbank. He knew two of those long legs. As they slid through, he saw that the other pair belonged to Sebastian Moran, and that he had a gun pressed to Sherlock’s temple. Despite it all, Sherlock was rolling his eyes at Moriarty’s cackling from the depths of the blizzard behind him.
Sherlock pulled away from John’s mouth gasping. There was no good natured humor or sweet John left in those eyes. They were hooded dark masses of lust that left Sherlock’s mouth hanging open. He’d only ever imagined that it could be like this. That it could all be this simple.
Nothing should be particularly exciting about watching someone eating a muffin. As far as food went it wasn’t too noteworthy. It could be annoyingly messy and texture varied wildly based on preparation. The ones John had bought at the supermarket tended to be on the drier side, but satisfactory. There was nothing about Sherlock slowly taking a bite that should have caused any sort of reaction. Sherlock wasn’t even really paying attention to eating at this point. He was almost completely distracted with the microscope. Crumbs smeared inelegantly across the corner of his mouth making the detective appear more human than usual. Sherlock wiped it away with barely any accuracy using his thumb, his tongue briefly flicking out to catch the pieces of food.
John tried to work up a scowl, but drew back in a bit of a panic instead. Sherlock had given no indication of noticing his meandering until now. There had been no inflection or tone to what had just been said. No hidden meanings, yet John couldn’t help but search and find millions of them.
John’s breath came out in a woosh of air he didn’t even know he had been holding. The sound caused Sherlock to give him a moment’s attention that led to several additional moments. The first glance was a grazing familiar one that stopped with a furrow of eyebrows. It retreated and Sherlock’s gaze went from the bottom of John’s shirt to his hand, to his shoes, to collar, to hair, mouth, and then eyes in seemingly random order. They were quick appraisals that took pieces of a puzzle that Sherlock easily knew how to put together.
“Have you been experimenting lately?” John’s attempts at disinterested interest were not the most successful. With that question came an entirely different set of imagination. Sherlock the scientist. Scrutinizing, not missing anything, able to deduce everything. He’d seen people come apart with a few select choices of Sherlock’s words. There was no telling what he would be able to do with his hands.
With the addition of another murder, Sherlock expertly solved the case in a spectacular fashion. John had followed along loyally while a myriad of explicit thoughts ran through his head. Not explicit in a way that was -- there was no good way of describing the interest John had taken in Sherlock’s newly revealed aptitude towards self stimulation (as Sherlock put it) that wouldn’t make him sound less than straight. Despite the many attempts of banishing the thoughts and moving on with his life as it had been, John couldn’t be rid of them.
