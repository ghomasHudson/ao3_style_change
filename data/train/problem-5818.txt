Steve can’t help but smiling as witnessing this, he can’t believe they’ve gone through a whole dinner just the two of them without having a political discussion of sorts or getting into an argument over the Avengers and which line to keep regarding some world event, as it’s usually the case whenever they both get hungry whilst in the middle of a meeting and decide to take a break to fill their stomachs. Tonight was different, it

. Seems like he just can’t stop.
Steve knows that he shouldn’t, no matter what, because yeah, Tony jokes around a lot but can also be dreadfully serious at times, and he doesn’t want to risk spoiling this evening just because he’s not versed enough in dating to know how to read a situation. But if he could read Steve’s mind, he would tell him there’s no way you can ever be one hundred percent sure of something like this, no matter how experienced you are.
“SCPD. You are surrounded. This is your last warning. Place your ha—“
, he thinks, but before his mind can formulate a response, he slips back into unconsciousness.
Now what’s left to establish is the great mystery that is Tony. Sure, being out for four days explains his worry, and maybe he’s also feeling guilty for not having realised straightaway that Steve had been hit - although, really, he shouldn’t - but that doesn’t quite cut it. He feels the answer is right there, yet for some reason, he just can’t pin it down.
But Steve shakes slightly his head and painfully stretches a hand out to catch Tony’s: “Do you still love me?”
“Tony, please…”

“C’mon, Steve, dancing means
“I-I don’t know, I… fell asleep” he replies, feeling stupid and useless and guilty whilst his heart is racing way too fast.
“J-Jean,
Steve’s eyes light up as he understands the hidden implication lying underneath that statement: “You mean…” he starts, but leaves the sentence hanging; because yeah, he’s old fashioned and everything, but by now he has spent enough time in the twenty-first century to know that some things are better left unsaid.
Now realizing that this mistake has come into being, in fact, because he has let his imagination (or fears) running wild, Tony shakes his head to himself and lets out a nervous chuckle, because he knows that he has to own what he just confessed moments earlier.
“Look, I’m sorry, it just sorta came out of my mouth before I could stop myself, it was a… last resort thing. I understand if you’re mad.”
“How do you know his name?” Steve asks, taking a step forward without even realizing it, as to protect Tony.
After it happened, people had tried to convince him to take up another room – the compound has plenty of free ones, just another reminder of what could have been if only the mission in Laos had never taken place, or had gone in a different direction, the
“I told him. He didn’t flinch. Wasn’t surprised either. I think he knew already to be fair.”
And Tony seals the vow with a deep kiss, his body moving independently as he climbs on Steve’s lap, gently pushing him down on the mattress again even if he really shouldn’t, because they both have places to be, battles to fight. But he doesn’t stop, neither does Steve, and before long their moans fill the room once more as they lose themselves into each other yet again.

“Here, let me show you…” he offers, picking up his own set again to show it off to his companion. “You just put your middle here and then you move them with the other two fingers. It might take you a bit of practice, so don’t worry, it’s completely normal.”

“Anything to help you. What you’re doing is very brave.” T’Challa says after they’re through with the usual pleasantries.
He really wishes he had been, at least wouldn’t have to endure this conversation now. But he refrains from saying that out loud. He knows the other doesn’t quite enjoy this kind of sarcasm.
“Let’s go.” Tony replies in more or less the same tone, stepping outside his room and following the other man outside, where the Quinjet is waiting for them.
What have you got to lose?”

“Listen, it’s okay, alright? You’re good. I… I overreacted. Things like
Tony can’t help but giggling, slightly amused and decisively impressed, because he wasn’t expecting him to not fail.
He knows that Miss Goodwin is looking at him, he can feel her scared glance, so he turns to her and gives her a brief nod. But if he thought she would fall in line just like that, he was solely mistaken.
His phone rings once again. It has barely stopped since this morning, and it’s only 11am. This is going to be a hell of a long day.
calls him by his first name, except, well, mainly Pepper and Steve, plus he’s never told him he could do that – although that might be beside the point, him being the President and all.
The sound of the alarm – yet another thing that he hasn’t changed, because Tony had been the one setting it, at 7:05, such a peculiar time he had always thought, until he was explained that would give ten minutes for just the two of them, before the daily chaos started, and from that day onwards he had loved the reminder – brings him back to the present, making him finally stand up and getting inside the shower. He lets water fall heavily on his head, mechanical movements reach out for the shampoo first and the liquid soap after as he washes his body, his mind elsewhere, because the one stain he wishes to erase is impossible to scrub away. Ten minutes later is finally out of the bedroom, wearing a black wool jacket on a black shirt and black trousers, such an unusual look on him and he hates it with a passion, but couldn’t help himself while he was choosing his clothes, Tony’s voice in the back of his mind telling him that sometimes social costumes are there for a reason, specifically in an occasion as today. He drags his feet to the kitchen and is surprised to not find anyone in there, although he soon realizes that it’s not because everyone is still asleep, but because they know better that to stumble on his path today, especially
. Take all of your knowledge of gender stereotypes and throw it away, okay? I’m serious. The gender of the person in front of you doesn’t matter, you just can’t act like you’re the only one who can make decisions. You already have… a really defined body that give off that vibe, you don’t need your actions to match it too. You get what I mean?”
“Captain Rogers?”
They’ve spoken in the same exact moment, and that makes them both chuckle in embarrassment; the analogy with teenagers continues in Tony’s mind, and for the life of him he can’t remember when was the last time he felt so awkward around someone. This is just not in his
where he is and, although he’s repeated over and over that he has no intention of taking part in Fury’s plan, Tony knows he wouldn’t back away from this.
“W-What was that for?” the other asks, his glance indecipherable.
He definitely hadn’t even considered this opportunity, although it makes perfect sense. Was he expecting the whole world to just stop rotating merely because he had decided to take time off? Of course he had, but that’s beyond the point. He doesn’t exactly know how to feel about this, and the confusion must be showing on his face because Pepper gives out a chuckle after the silence goes on a bit too long.
There’s an exasperated, loud sigh in the room, which he ignores anyway, because he really couldn’t care less. After just a few seconds more, he slides his hand to touch the armor’s forearm, hoping that the residue of battery which allowed him to come out of it, back in the cave, will be enough to unlock the fist still holding the ring. Thumb and forefinger pressed together, he almost closes his eyes in an attempted prayer, but before he can think of anything, as if answering his wishes, the suit gives a low-key buzz, opening up the hand to reveal the ring.

? – and this thought is already driving him insane.
“Oh baby, you’re okay, I was so worried…” the other replies, his voice sounding a little hoarse, suggesting that he’s been… well, crying, Tony can’t help but thinking, and the thought gives him goosebumps, because he’s never seen Steve shred a single tear in all the years he’s known him. “Of course I’m here, where else would I be?”
in a casual business attire. He is so mesmerized that for a bunch of seconds his mouth is simply paralyzed and he stands there, looking at Steve, not exactly knowing what to say except for the one thought that keeps buzzing into his head:
everything is, and the thought sends an involuntary shiver down his spine. Of course, new buildings always sound so
Steve doesn’t know if he agrees with this statement – in his opinion it can easily be used by people with no moral ground to justify bad decisions – but finds himself smiling nevertheless, at the way Anthony has used his nickname. Maybe it’s because the other has told him about his adversity towards the Army, but on his mouth it sounded exactly how Steve himself likes to hear it being said. Just three simple letters with no deep meaning or connotation whatsoever, because he’s captain of
“Relax, he’s fine, he’s just busy with a mission…” There’s the smallest shift in the way Fury is sitting – he moves his weight from the right leg to the left – and whilst it should be undetectable and possibly irrelevant, Tony’s senses are way too used to catch the tiniest of details by now that even this one doesn’t go unnoticed by his subconscious, and once he registers it in his mind, it rings his invisible alarm bell.
It’s a general question Jessica asks, an
“Uncle Sam would be hurt to hear you saying that. And baseball, really? Thought you’d be a football guy.”
“God, it’s not just one reason… Like for starters, I don’t ‘date’. I don’t know what to do on a date. Dates are just not my thing.”
Again, relief surfaces in his eyes. He’s going to be okay.
After that night, he doesn’t hear anymore from either Steve or Fury, which, if at the beginning doesn’t surprise him too much – he knew that the pager would stop working once they got overseas, he had designed them after all – the more time passes the more frustration it causes him, because he feels like he’s been pretty much left to his own. It doesn’t help that his situation remains precarious for about one month after Election Day, as he finds himself in a sort of limbo in which nobody tells him anything but he’s asked to ‘stay in touch’, as Mr. Grey so graciously put it. He figures he might be offered some sort of position within the new government (after all the large sum of money he

When Fury briefly looks down before continuing, Tony he’s one hundred percent sure he’s not going to like what he’s about to say.
“It’s Captain America, sir.”
Tony cocks a brow at that: “But Eyepatch there called you ‘Cap’, which I take is short for ‘Captain’…”
, because the stakes are too high for them to reignite their feelings now, it’d be pure masochism and there’s absolutely no need for that, not when the line they’re walking on is already as thin as it can possibly be; one single misfire and it will break.
. Whether they admit it out loud to one another is, of course, a different matter entirely.
a voice in his mind tells him,
As per usual, Tony didn’t just order a few trees, but what it seems like enough to start his own fruit company. And, as eager as Steve is to be doing something useful, he doesn’t know a thing about plants, or flowers, or anything green. After the delivery guy drops off the cargo - a grand total of 72 baby trees, or whatever they are called - Jarvis tasks Steve with digging holes for them about 20 feet apart, which, having an arm still trapped inside the cast, takes him all morning.
for it – and then he starts to tell a story – completely made up – about how the Avengers would have lost each and every time if they didn’t have weapons –
“I believe that, because the same thing happened to me.” Steve nods, and there’s a different light in his eyes now, as he slowly comes to realize there’s some truth in those words. Which makes Tony smile again, almost by reflex.
“We don’t have a choice,” Fury interrupts them now, the tone of one whose patience is running out, “He was the only other person who knew about this safe – he mentioned something about a pact they made before the war became global – and he showed me a letter from Howard Stark in which the powers of these rings are explained. See, the problem is, Stark only had nine of them. One was missing. Still is. And without it, they can’t be used. Now, we believe the robber doesn’t know this
“Wait, what? You mean
In the days and weeks that follow, Steve forgets about Tony and his strange behaviour at the hospital, his newfound passion absorbing most of his time. After an additional ten days, his cast gets taken off and he goes back to training, but he doesn’t ask for his shield, preferring to allow his body the whole length of recommended rehabilitation time before changing his status to ‘active’ again on the Avengers board. Instead, he opts to test out his body with a special DIY project: the construction of a small greenhouse to house cacti, orchids, ferns, oranges and peaches. It takes him just a little over a day to complete, and once it’s done, he plans a further visit to the garden centre, both to order its inhabitants and some decorative additions to make it homier, for lack of a better adjective.
“I really wouldn’t know…”
to disobey the order and
He stops, trying to see if his words make any sense to Pepper as they did to him, but he can’t quite figure it out; they probably do, at least to some extent, but of course because she has never had any contact with aliens and gods and whatnot it’s more of a trusting exercise for her. He understands this, and doesn’t want to make her life even harder than it has been in the past couple of years. So he takes a deep breath and catches her hand, holding it tight and looking into her eyes as saying the next few words.
“Don’t come looking for me, alright? And if someone tells you they
“Was that General Ross by any chance?” he asks, because he doesn’t see the point in pretending to be a complete idiot when they both know he isn’t.
And then something else happens.
Stay calm,
in the room, but not Steve’s.
“So… What do you think?” he asks again all the same after a minute, looking at Steve with a serious glance that tells the other this is a genuine question, and not one meant to pull his leg.
it’s making him, because slowly but surely he loses the red line of his thoughts, words coming out of his mouth without a logical concatenation. Tony decides to wait it out, painfully as it is, but when the other says something along the lines “I wouldn’t be a soldier if I wasn’t a soldier”, he knows he

“Yeah, so I gathered, thank you for clarifying that.”
“Yeah, I meant it like reaching dessert without someone trying to kill us, that sort of thing…”
“ ‘M fine…” he eventually manages to babble, his voice sounding so crooked and feeble that he has trouble recognising it as his own.
As he checks in at the Mediterranean hotel about six days later, the manager informs him that he’s needed in the second conference room at the top floor, and Tony can’t help but smiling immediately as imagining being in Steve’s arms once again, because although it hasn’t been nearly as long or as challenging as during the previous months they’ve been apart – when he had constantly been on edge and for the most part he had no idea what he was doing, or if he was doing it

He smiles at Steve, then Steve returns the smile.
. Too painful. As the hours start piling up and he keeps drinking, as he watches Bucky and Sam making their way to the dance floor, as the club slowly but steadily becomes more and more packed, Steve can feel his body starting to protest, almost aching for a contact that has been missing for far too long – he doesn’t even want to
that–“
“See, you keep mentioning my ‘abilities’, but I’m telling you, I have no idea what you’re talking about. Sure, I’m strong, hard to deny it, but other than that…”
And for the time being, that’s all they can do.
He takes a deep sigh, shaking his head to himself as to get rid of all these nasty thoughts, the last thing he needs right now. Can’t be going into the most terrible battle kind of wishing you were dead already, can you? It doesn’t seem that productive, or smart. He opens the drawer of his bedside table and looks at the bunch of envelopes tied together by an elastic band. The first one says ‘Pepper’ on the front, but the rest of them are all directed to different people (although he can only hope that, was he to actually die, there would indeed be some of those other addressees left alive). Rhodey, Happy, May, Steve, Bruce, Nat, even Thor; he still doesn’t know why he wrote letters to all of them – it was only meant to be one letter for Pepper, to try and explain, once and for all, why he did what he did, over and over – but after the first one he found himself not able to stop. His words contained far too many feelings, they were soppy and cheesy and totally uncharacteristically of him, so much so that, were people to read them, they would probably think someone else had been their author instead.
“W-where am I?” he crocks out, his voice sounding quite foreign as it hits the walls around him, making him realize that there’s a IV in his veins and some pads on his chest. He doesn’t even know why he asked that question: nobody seems to be within hearing distance. But as it turns out, he’s wrong about this.
“FRIDAY? Locate Captain Rogers for me, please?”
“Why did you never tell me that people knew about us, Tony?”

“Um… Thank you?”
“Not for the time being, this is more of a… I-need-a-favor kind of call.” Tony explains, half apologetic, because asking for help still doesn’t come natural to him. But that doesn’t seem to be a problem on the other end of the line.

“Hey, you alright?”
“Wait, are you… asking me out?”
“I know, because it has to be
to him? Whew. When exactly did this happen?”
“You’re gonna pay for this…” he groans, slipping a hand down his trousers to hold himself, and although in a normal situation he would be embarrassed, he simply doesn’t have the energy to hide away right now. “Where are you going?”
And then, just when he thought he had managed to find a way to be okay with what he’s doing, it comes another blow; it’s the Monday before Election Day, and the campaign’s last stop is, unsurprisingly, in Indiana. The crowd is their biggest ever, and for the occasion they ask him to stay on stage for the whole duration of the President’s speech; not thinking much of it (and, to be fair, not seeing any plausible reason to decline), he agrees, so instead of walking off stage he takes place on the right of the man now talking into the microphone. It’s the same words he’s heard over and over for the past month and a half: enough immigrants, less taxes, who cares about the environment and so on – pretty soon his mind goes back to the final fight with Thanos, how he and Steve and Thor and Carol had spent months planning each and every move they were going to do once on Titan, practicing for twenty hours a day their steps and even their speeches, just to make sure they had everything covered as much as possible.
“Sorry I’m late, everyone. I got lost on my way here, for some reason,” Steve apologizes, looking quickly around to spot a free chair, and even though Tony is

of it.
Rhodey smiles and is about to reply when FRIDAY’s voice plays in the room, catching them both off guard. Tony had completely forgotten he had installed the A.I. in the speakerphones of his room.
“Do you think it’s gonna work?”
“Yeah, sure…” the other mumbles, and Tony could have said just about anything at that point and getting the same exact reply.
, but the suit is propriety of  this man here, and I won’t be allowed any further remarks on this subject. Have I made myself clear?”
“Stark…”
, and that makes for such a great change that nobody wants to spend a single minute questioning it for fear it could just as easily disappear. Not that it bothers Tony in the slightest, he’s used to it by now and to be fair, people not noticing when he’s not in the attendance gives him some degree of freedom and choice that he wouldn’t otherwise have. Still, he probably should stop and get a move, because even though he could decide not to show up to any of those parties, one thing that he does indeed want is to spend Christmas Day somewhere that is not

“This is
It takes some time – and a couple more of handkerchiefs – but eventually he manages to get all the crusty blood off Steve’s face. He knows it does nothing for the wounds, nevertheless he thinks it makes him more… himself, and maybe that could help him on a psychological level. He has no clue really, but at this point it doesn’t really matter to him. And maybe it’s just his mind playing tricks on him, but when Steve talks again, his voice sounds somewhat stronger.

– matter of fact Tony has decided to keep quiet as much as possible, because if the theory that has been forming in his mind is correct (and the facts to his disposal corroborate it so far) talking would bring more problems than anything else. “We should walk” he had said, and Steve had just nodded in reply.
As he stands on the Capitol on Inauguration Day in a particularly cold and grey morning in mid-January, Tony has to keep his head occupied as much as possible so to not focus on the embarrassing amount of xenophobia, racism ad misogyny that permeates each and every word of the President’s address; it’s nothing new really, just a slightly more elaborate and somewhat refined treatment of the promises on which his whole campaign was based, but knowing that this guy will actually do his best to implement them makes them sound all too scary and real now. Nodding from time to time for the sole benefit of the cameras, Tony can’t help but thinking about Steve, wondering whether he’s watching him right now, maybe taking time out of whatever it is they’re doing overseas, or if he’s in his mind
“Okay…” Steve nods, redness still spreading on his cheeks as Tony leans in for a goodbye kiss before disappearing out of the door.
Steve has no idea where this might be going and is a bit afraid to ask, so he just stays there, eyes fixed on the cactus in front of him, nodding as if he’s actually getting it.
When he walks into his hotel room, a couple of hours later, a piercing headache and the
“That’s not what I was going for…” a voice replies, and Tony knows deep down that’s impossible, he
“Whatever…”
The awkward moment seems to be averted, because there’s a general nod and the sound of chopsticks getting separated one from the other. He can already feel the magic combination of rice and fish melting together in his mouth while his thumb and index fingers are about to close on a nigiri, but before they can, he becomes painfully aware of a new subtle atmosphere of suspension around the table.

for the two of them to be on a team together right now. Steve himself seems to be sharing the same thought, because he doesn’t give any sign of acknowledging his presence as he takes his seat right next to him. But if that’s more than okay with Tony, it seems to prompt some muttering and
“In English, thank you.”

team.
to know the truth, however impossible it might sound. Here’s the deal…”
“I tried to tell him that too…” he sighs, but Steve is not really paying attention now, he’s mostly ranting to himself.
After what came out of his mouth the last time, Tony doesn’t trust himself to speak, not for the time being anyway, so he launches himself towards Steve, wrapping his arms around his neck as he kisses him with an intensity he’s quite sure he has never felt before, pulling him along as he lies down again, causing the box to fall off the bed.
, closes the gap between them and, ignoring the bottles between them, cups Steve’s face with his hands and kisses him gently. It’s a short, sweet, seventh-grade kind of kiss, the one that parents exchange when they’re in front of their kids and that you learn to associate with love, sure, but also safety and home.
kind of money… the sky is the limit, Mr. Grey.” he smirks, trying not to feel disgusted with himself, while the guy next to him is struggling to keep his excitement under control.
This cannot be happening, it surely is just a nightmare, or a hallucination. Or maybe someone is twisting the very fabric of reality so now everything is upside down. It
he needs to be from here on out. In the series of Cabinet meetings that follow Inauguration Day the President makes sure to remind everyone in the room that he intends to keep the promises he made to his peers during the campaign, and that he wants the three important ones done by the end of the month, which leaves them all with about ten days to work the logistics out.
“Well, well, well, if ain’t this a surprise…” Clint’s voice reaches his ears
by it.
something, or if it’s just another figment of his imagination playing tricks on him – it wouldn’t be the first time something like that happens.
“Great, you know me, so you know I’m not just gonna take your word about not being able to get out, right? I mean, that’s my trademark. One of them, anyway.”
. Tony couldn’t disagree more. He’d much rather forget about the whole incident. But he knows that wouldn’t work with the blonde, so he takes a deep breath and allows him to catch up.
, he wonders to himself, passing a hand over his face to keep himself from saying it out loud, knowing that he’s not ready to risk it, not yet, although it’s been six months now, which is the minimum recommended to wait before going back. He didn’t even want to do this initially, he felt it would be inopportune, wrong, and could be interpreted the wrong way. Not by Steve, of course not, but he couldn’t be sure he wouldn’t tell anyone, even if just to seek some comfort, some reassurance that he wasn’t going completely insane after all. But then as the date approached, he started to feel like he
“Do you ever wonder—“
He arrives in D.C. in the early afternoon – trains are so fast nowadays that he doesn’t even have time to doze off before the conductor announces over the speakers they’re approaching their destination – and sure enough both of his friends are right there to meet him. He doesn’t really get a say of what happens next: although he tries to resist, his protests are shut down every step of the way, until he just resigns to the idea of letting them have all the decisional power for once. The first stop is a barbershop (“Really, Steve, the long hair is fine if you take care of it, but you

He’s quick to blink away his puzzlement, but nevertheless has to take a long sip of water in order to conjure up a proper reply.
His voice is soft and kind, his words just what Tony wanted to hear right now, and once again he can’t help himself but wondering exactly how and when they started to be so in sync with one another. He closes his eyes, swallows and tells himself that this is not the time to stay on the line just to hear Steve’s breathing into the receiver, no matter how much he’d love that, so he forces himself to speak.

If he had an ordinary job, today would be filed under the category “just another day at the office” for the most part of it. Which loosely translates as half an hour meeting with Tony and Thor interrupted by a false alarm – believe it or not they have at least half a dozen of them every day – followed by an hour each of physical and strategical training with the new rooster, followed but what appeared to be a red alert emergency that was a pallid orange one at best. After a quick lunch, it is a series of simulations, external meetings, paperwork or a combination of the three. Exciting as being an Avenger, one of Earth’s mightiest heroes might sound, 90% of the time that role requires a lot of faffing about and making sure a lawsuit is not around the corner when the bad guys actually hit. Which, incidentally, is the part of the job he likes the least, needless to say.

“I swear to god, if you say ‘Steve’ one more time…”
, and I used to go along with it because what’s the harm in it, right?” he shrugs, looking at the empty glass in front of him and wishing they had already ordered wine. He checks if the maître is around but can’t spot it:
He doesn’t quite know what he was expecting – probably either a “What’s ‘it’?’” or a “Are you kidding me?” – but that’s not where Fury is going, because all he does is keeping his eye on Tony, staying silent for so long that he has no alternative but talking again: “So, uh… We can’t do that, if we’re against each other.
“Does it matter?”
“Any idea who this guy is, Nick?”
Steve sighs but doesn’t add anything else, mostly because he doesn’t have the energy to argue, but also because he seems to enjoy the other man’s dedication, or at least that’s what Tony hopes.
He can’t quite believe that he’s said all of this out loud, it was supposed to be a conversation between himself, and nothing more. He looks away, not exactly trusting himself to say another word. When he hears Steve standing, his heart skips a beat and he thinks that he’s blown it, that this is it: he has finally revealed himself for the fool he always knew he was.
“You may… and look up when you do, please.”
“What can I do for you, Nick?”
– but still doesn’t think he is, because there’s a subtext out in the open which is kind of hard to ignore.
“Maybe not, but he’s a smart man and he’ll understand it’s for a higher purpose.”

She’s not sold, of course, but pretends to be. “Okay, well, if you need anything – and I mean it – you know where to find us. Don’t be a stranger, Steve.”
And Tony smiles first, but then lets out a heartily laugh, rubbing some more unexpected tears out of his face: “Gosh, yes, yes I would.”

“I won’t,”
“I know…

“… Assuming it’s still a thing people drink?”
And maybe Steve knows that’s not what he meant, because he doesn’t enquire any further, although can’t keep an amused smile out of his face. They walk in silence for a while, side by side, and Tony gets a little lost into his thoughts as looking at the Christmas decorations already up and shining in the streets, although it’s merely the second of December and there are so many catastrophes that could happen before the 25

“Yeah, that has been Hank’s understanding as well. We should get back there as soon as possible. How does tomorrow sound?”

“Yeah, well, I wasn’t in the mood.” Tony mutters, and by god, he wishes people would just stop hold up his past decisions against him every single chance they get.
The honest answer would be ‘I don’t know’, but of course he’s not going to say that. He goes for “Give me a second,” instead, mostly to try and figure out their next move, but right in this moment some sort of light catches the corner of his eye. Thinking it’s just a sun ray reflecting on something shiny, he keeps silent in the comms as he moves toward whatever grabbed his attention.
“Namor?”
Tony doesn’t want to know what that means, not one bit. But he’s torn now,
His voice leaves behind a funny silence, which quickly grows to be uncomfortable for him because Steve keeps mum for the longest time, leaving Tony wondering what the hell the other is thinking.

“That’s bullshit and you know it!” Steve cuts him short, shaking his head in disbelief. It was so stupid of him, believing this was going to be any different. The government only looks out for itself, doesn’t it?
Steve is about to reply, but Tony precedes him, looking down and talking as if he was answering a simple question in physics class back in high school: “Energy can’t be destroyed or created, it can only be transformed…”
“You know what?,” he eventually says, after what seems to be an eternity, “You
at him to stop – he can’t help but leaning in for yet another kiss, less chaste this time, tongue slipping inside Steve’s mouth to caress his, gently yet hungrily. He parts only once he’s completely out of breath, taking a step back as to remind the other that he doesn’t have the same super soldier stamina, and it’s only now that realizes what Steve has been holding for all this time above their heads: a mistletoe.
“You’re the closest friend I’ve got…” Steve begins, and then before Tony can insert himself into that pause, he adds: “… who is also very popular with people.”
they would jump on the chance of getting their hands over the precious Iron Man suit. But Steve has spent way too much time filled with regret for not saying no when it needed to be said, or agreeing to shortcuts when it wasn’t really necessary. When he left the Army, he told himself: never again. And a promise is a promise.

To maybe have a chance of resuming a somewhat normal life. To think about the future.

not working so we’ll have to come up with a new plan and I just…” he makes another pause, longer this time, and Tony uses it to leave a kiss on Steve’s cheek, rubbing his nose against his skin. “Let’s do it. Let’s get married tomorrow.” Steve gives him an awkward smile as he finishes his sentence, and Tony nods his approval before kissing him gently, figuring it’s the only appropriate response to his words.

Although the news should change his schedule, it really doesn’t, not just because today is marked as an off day, but because even under normal circumstances nothing could ever get in the way of his coming here, first thing in the morning and last thing at dawn. It’s what takes the precedence, no matter what. Aliens? Super-villains? Terrorists? For an hour before 10am and after 4pm they’re someone else’s problem, a written condition of him taking up his role again. Nobody was crazy enough to contest that.
now, Steve!”
he curses in silence, shaking his head to himself and starting to feel a ridiculously amount of sadness overpowering him, and every bit of self-control he has left. He stands up and circles the bed around so to face Steve as he sits on his heels, swallowing some courage before letting his words out for the very first time since his visits started, hurrying them to prevent his rational side to stop him, because he
Tony catches a glimpse of Rhodey walking away, and although he wishes he didn’t, he can’t blame him, not really. He himself doesn’t want to get involved in this. He briefly considers making a run for it, plain and simple, but that would be a real dick move.
Wait what?
“Oh, yes, of course, I’m sorry…” Steve mumbles, stepping aside and opening the door to let him in.
“So?” he asks straightaway, and by his tone Tony knows he’s been patiently waiting with the phone within reach who knows for how long.
kept me in the loop, especially with stuff like

He doesn’t know, nor does he think it’s within his ability of comprehension, because when tries, he finds himself at loss of appropriate names to describe it. Again he attempts to move his limbs, to talk, but it’s all pointless, it feels like he is beyond being in the tangible plane of existence.
“Wanna taste it too, blon—“ Tom begins, but he never finishes his sentence as a powerful punch hits his left cheek, sending him against the wall and immediately on the floor, unconscious, and without wasting any time around, Steve launches himself to gain control of the gun fallen nearby, now without an owner.
“What do you mean, it doesn’t matter? I told you I’m not comf—”
– probably just a reflex of his subconscious, still mostly asleep – before he forces himself to cut it out.
gun, and even without turning he can tell the shooter is next to the doors.
“I’m sorry, I don’t… The only thing I know is that he’s on a really secret mission somewhere, but other than that…” the other eventually says, his voice slightly lower as if he was whispering a secret. “I’m sure he’s fine though” he then adds, and Tony can tell it is just wishful thinking, but he’s glad to hear it anyway.
He smiles, feeling a new warmth making its way into his chest, alleviating its tightness and delivering more air into his lungs. Just then, a short vibration warns him that one minute has already gone by.
“Someone is eager…” Mark observes just before taking him with his mouth, whole, and Steve hates everything. His body, for not listening to his brain. The guy on his knees in front of him, for giving him a pleasure he doesn’t want nor feel like he
intends to know what caused Tony’s state: “What do you mean, you ‘guess’? You don’t

it has been, it makes him furious with himself – and tonight Tony has promised himself that enough is enough, Sundays are meant to be kept free even if Japan is thirteen hours ahead of the East Coast which means he should actually be on his way there right now, rather than entering the Avengers base garage in upstate New York. He’ll think about that tomorrow, he’ll come up with a plan like he always does.
“Sorry, what did you just say? I don’t think I’ve heard you right…”
, he reflects now,
if he was one hundred percent sure that he had one person in his corner, just
, and that’s why, having basically run away after that impromptu kiss two nights ago, he’s literally locked himself into his lab and has been there ever since, siege protocol activated, dark blinds pulled all the way down to shield it from outsiders’ looks, surviving on a diet of black coffee and rice cakes. He would go on like this for a couple of weeks at least, except of course Steve has other plans in mind.
Waiting for the others to arrive, he begins surveying the scene, looking for any clues about the location of this ‘ring’ they’re after (maybe unsurprisingly, Fury didn’t provide them with any visual reference of what the object might look like). However, the cave looks barren, and once again Steve wonders about the Namor guy who tipped them off (he doesn’t know him, of course, but the rest of the group isn’t particularly fond of him, which is reason enough for Steve to be skeptical).
‘I’ve gone ahead. See you there’ he scribbles on the whiteboard on the fridge, and then he’s on his way out.
Tony is in love.
“Well, this went much worse than I had anticipated, so thank you.” he sighs, standing up. When she does too, he pulls her in another long hug that she wasn’t expecting. “I am sorry, you know…” he whispers after a bit, hoping that she’ll hear the honesty in his voice. She does.
“Tony?”
“Oh yeah, definitely. Despite costing like a sandwich… But don’t you worry, I know just the place.”
“Thanks,” Steve nods, although not quite sure why, maybe to try and put the kid more at ease. But if that was indeed his intention, it fails miserably, because in his eyes there’s a hint of embarrassment now, for some reason unknown to him.
, in fact, give in to such feelings. Furthermore, being a Stark and having access to a ridiculous amount of money from the start had meant receiving (mainly sexual) attentions from the kind of people those things seem to naturally attract: one night standers, social climbers, gold-diggers of all genders. Put everything together and it’s not all that difficult to understand why a) trusting people doesn’t come easy to him, and b) romantic gestures aren’t really his forte. Nevertheless, he feels like trying to give Steve a sort of traditional date, something that would make him feel at ease and resemble the idea of a romantic evening which used to be in fashion in the late Thirties as much as possible. So he asks FRIDAY the names of the top ten restaurants in New York, picks one with the most varied menu (he still has no idea what the other likes in terms of food, but he doesn’t particularly want to ask him either), books the whole place up for the evening and gives the maître precise instructions as the conduct the staff needs to keep (he puts special emphasis on not making it look like they’re tiptoeing around them or, on the contrary, that they’re just waiting for a word to approach them). The next step is to actually
“No, I mean… What is going on? Why are you leaving?” the other man asks, getting closer again, and Tony could swear the electricity in the air is now palpable.
“No. That can’t be.” He moves past the doctor and approaches the bed. Steve is still there, his body warm to the touch. “How long have you tried CPR for?”
Now it’s Tony’s turn to stare, as he refuses to believe what his ears have just heard. His head is suddenly overwhelmed with questions. What sort of crap is this? How long has he known? Who else does? Why was he okay with Clint and Lang pulling out but not him? Eventually, he focuses on the one that he judges the most pressing: “Goddamn it, Nick, when is it gonna be my turn to be happy? Why does everyone get their chance to lead a normal life but me?”
, not in any way that counts. But before that he was a
“The robot I sent over to your farm to install the security system…” he replies, holding in a chuckle because, even if his eyes are still closed, he can well picture the other’s puzzled expression.
of what has been going on in his mind for the last five minutes, but he knows words could never suffice so he puts all of that into the kiss, slipping his tongue gently into the other man’s mouth to caress his and his hands under Steve’s polo shirt to caress the skin he hasn’t touched in
. The elections are only a few months away and frankly, it’s not looking very good. People are scared, they’re bound to make
Tony turns to look at Steve as he spoke, his own heart aching when he hears the increased tone of terror in the other man’s voice. For once he doesn’t think, he just leans his hand on Steve’s shoulder, squeezing it gently hoping to transmit some reassurance of sorts.
“Mrs. Young, what is this?” he asks his secretary via intercom, because although he’s had a lot of different things running through his mind lately, missing something
“Glad you liked it…”
“Afraid can’t do that, son. Need to get outta here. And
“What kind of question is that, Hank? Can’t just leave it here…”
“So, how did I—“
“You alright there, Steve?”
Nobody can say that he didn’t try, of this he’s sure. It had been relatively easy for the first couple of days: reading files (plus a book) and watching documentaries he had been meaning to for ages, letting Clint teaching him how to play computer games and hanging out with Natasha while she was busy cracking a code. Then he got progressively more restless, monotony setting in along with the feeling of being useless every time that damn alarm goes off, all because of Tony and his fixations. As a matter of fact, Steve had grown convinced that the other was purposely avoiding his company, for reasons completely unknown to him. But today his personal mission is to find the guy and have a straight conversation with him, no matter how hard or awkward that can be. Because today marks two weeks since he’s been back home, he’s feeling well, and, quite frankly, he’s had enough. He wants his shield back (and access to the gym again).
“Indeed it is, the Elves themselves would be impressed, and that is saying a lot…”
“Uh, excuse me, who are you, where are we, and most importantly, how do we get out of here?” asks Tony, a nervousness in his tone that he wishes he could disguise somehow. If the being minds to be questioned, it surely doesn’t show any signs, as his voice doesn’t register any variation as he answers.
“Send me your coordinates, I’m coming.”
A silent nod.
It takes a while, but eventually his brain starts gearing up again whilst a helicopter is flying him to the hospital. With the sniper still at large, possibly ready to strike again, he decides the only smart thing to do is to let the world believe the person who did it… succeeded. He can’t bring himself to say the exact words out loud, even if he really should. Because doing it would mean entertaining, even just as a mere possibility, that idea, and sorry, he’s not doing it, not now, not ever. Steve is Steve, right? He’s America’s one and only super soldier. He’s been around for nearly a century. A stupid and insignificant human mercenary is not going to do much damage now, is it? What a nonsense.
“Hell yeah,” Steve replies, and for the first time in almost ten years he feels
“So… would you like to see the master bedroom?” he whispers as they momentarily part to inhale some air, his attention completely on the other man now.

“Apologies. Had forgotten something,” he feels like explaining, mostly so not to jinx the mission with early complains – the last thing they need.
If Steve was here, he would know
Slowly but surely, a light bulb switches on in Steve’s brain, and he nods, standing up: “Oh, right. Yes, sorry, I’d all forgot about that. I didn’t assume you’d still be up for it though.”
Eyes fixed on the time projection on the ceiling, he’s been watching minutes slowly going from 00 to 59, only to start back again, for the last five hours that he’s spent in bed, trying to get some sleep – although after the first sixty minutes went by, he knew that it was never going to arrive, not tonight anyway. He had briefly toyed with the idea of hitting the gym around 3am, just to do something and maybe get rid of the restlessness that has been crippling him all day, but eventually decided against it, because didn’t want to risk anyone spotting him in there, awake, punching bags, imagining they were

“Technically it’s the US, yes, but given it’s my signature – and my money – on the ‘Avengers Protocol’…” he shrugs, and not for the first time he wonders whether people are actually going to to believe he was indeed a mole once the plan goes down, because every now and then Thanos’ words come back to haunt him, particularly that
“I love you, Steve, and I never stopped, god knows how much I wanted and tried to make myself stop. I’ve been in love with you since the first time we kissed, years ago, and I’ve never been able to let you go. Couldn’t get you out of my heart even when my brain was hating every damn fiber of your being for what you had done, for the way you lied about my parents. And I despise this place for making me saying this shit out lout but goddamn it, it’s been tearing me apart for almost three years now, and I just can’t take it anymore.”
“I’m not, I just can’t believe you said that to someone. I mean, we didn’t exactly… discuss it, you know?”

, but Cap? Although he would never admit it out loud, Cap holds a special place in his heart, always has. Don’t they say you should never meet your heroes? Yeah, Tony guesses that’s part of the reason why. You inevitably get attached beyond your wildest expectations, and especially in this line of work, that comes with a very dangerous price.
“Tell me the truth, how are you doing?” Steve whispers into his ear after a bit, leaving a kiss on his cheek that sends shivers down Tony’s spine.
“Are you… alright?” the other asks, frowning, not quite sure what to make of such a secretive entrance.
“Which part of ‘your ten minutes are up’ didn’t get through that big brain of yours, exactly?” the guard’s voice interrupts his offer, and Steve finds himself chuckling for a brief moment at the absurdity of the situation.
He does. And for a while they just sit there, next to each other, in religious silence. But it’s a comfortable one this time. which neither of them minds. Pretty soon Tony’s head gently falls on top of Steve’s shoulder, and after just a few seconds blond hair starts tickling his forehead, making him smile.

“I’m Steve. Grant is my middle name too, if you can believe it,” comes the answer, and with it a small, rectangular paper is handed to him, but it’s not made of the usual material, it’s slightly
“There’s been a shooting, sir.”
A silent nod pervades the circle, and just like that a bulb goes off into Steve’s brain, the link so clear that he can’t believe he didn’t make it on the spot. Iron Man. Of course. That’s why the Stark name sounded so familiar. After his father disappeared, his mum had to pick up extra shifts at the diner in order to put enough food on the table, which meant Steve spent a lot of time either at home alone or sitting in one of the restaurant booths reading. They couldn’t afford proper kids’ books, or TV, so when he came across a box full of old comics outside a house with a white fence – the piece of paper on top of it said ‘Free to a good home’ – Steve didn’t hesitate for one second and picked up the heavy container carrying it back home. When he opened it, he found hundreds of comic books inside. The title on the vast majority of them said: Iron Man.
His voice is shaking too evidently now for him to keep pretending he’s not hearing it; so he turns to face him, and does something that he would have never done back on Earth: he takes Steve’s hands into his, leaning his forehead against his, and starts singing softly:
that doesn’t work: he could never match Steve’s strength, no matter what. An even if he’s well aware of this, he can’t help but getting even more pissed at him.
“I need you to promise me, kid. Can I trust you?”
. He knows it’s petty, but Steve is tempted to say no anyway just because Fury keeps using it even though he asked him twice not to.
“It was 1980 and it was
Tony swallows, throwing his head back to let Steve kissing him again as he starts walking out of the living room, carrying him in his arms, knowing that he meant every word.
he reprehends himself, although he cannot keep an honest smile from popping up on his lips, and he sighs softly, part of him really wishing someone would do this for real with him, because when was the last time it happened? He can’t remember, which probably means the answer is
“What? No, of course I’m not…” he hurries to mutter, and then, as seeing Tony’s cheeky smirk: “I mean, have you seen where I’m living? Hard to meet people when you’re this far away from civilization…”
“No, but it originated from
“Now what?,” he asks Jarvis at that point.
Tony winks at him, smirking, and Steve can’t help but flushing on his cheeks as he looks away before mumbling, fully embarrassed: “I wasn’t implying…”
“I don’t want to talk about work but I
one, which is now much easier and less time consuming than before, something that presents him with the incredible opportunity to actually have a few hours of sleep on most nights.
“Either this neighborhood has just gotten ten times more dangerous, or it did, Steve. The ring is gone.” Tony replies, biting his lip as the reality hits him. He hopes he hasn’t been too arrogant, thinking he had mastered modern tracking devices and such. Only one way to know for sure. He stands up again, ignoring the light dizziness that hits him as he does, and in a few quick steps he reaches the table in the kitchenette, powering up the laptop lying on it before letting himself go on one of the chairs.
Yeah, that’s what going to happen. He knows it. But he’s going to make sure that Steve is well rested and looked after for at least a couple of days before he lets him out of the doctors’ sight again, no matter how hard Roger will try and protest. That will also give them the chance to catch the perpetrator and make sure they don’t see the light of day ever again. He might even try and push for the death penalty. Sure, Washington doesn’t have it anymore, but hey, special occasions call for special measures, right?
“Gotta admit, this is a nice piece of armor,” Hank says, crossing his arms over his chest as he takes a look around it.
“No,” Loki interrupts him, waving his hand around and sending the private swiftly against the wall, knocking her senseless. Tony gasps, and almost doesn’t notice Steve’s hand closing upon his own to protect the ring.
“I bet. The doc was surprised to hear you were already awake. Though by the time we got back you were out again, so I’m not sure whether that actually counts…”
“Please don’t, Steve. If you do, I’m actually gonna lose it.”
into it, he can feel his fascination growing more and more each time that he closes his eyes to rest. In the period that follows he visits so many planets, some really similar to Earth, others that only have in common with it the fact of being populated; as it turns out, the ‘right’ way of looking at the universe – or at our galaxy, to say the least – isn’t by picturing it as an enormous version of our own planet, but rather as the biggest theme park you’ll ever visit – matter of fact, a couple of them seem to
Fighting against every fiber in his body and groaning in pain, Tony forces himself to open his eyes again, and slaps his face as hard as he can in order to get his sight to come into focus. What he sees confirms what he already knew – although he was refusing to believe it – and sends the chilliest shiver down his spine. It’s not just that Steve is being held at point gun – he’s been serving for the last few of years, since they finished college, and Tony has made his peace with the fact that his lover is somewhat

“Stupid Celestials, I can’t even get FRIDAY installed…” he groans, closing his eyes briefly as leaning in against the other, smiling at how familiar and reassuring this feels. “So, what brings you here? Don’t you have somewhere
“Yeah, I know,” he promptly replies, before letting him on his idea: “So, I thought the next step for you should be going on a double date.”
“Stark…”
. That’s what has his heart bouncing like crazy in his chest now, his throat dry, his breath short.
Steve looks down as a shy smile appears on his lips, and Tony has to resist the impulse of starting to kiss him there and then, because when he smiles like that he can feel his whole body shivering, wanting to be affectionate. But before he loses it, Steve shifts his gaze on him and starts talking.
“On board for

He wasn’t asleep, but nevertheless feels the need to blink to make sure his eyes are seeing properly: just across the road there’s the entrance of a club, a big rainbow flag flying high just above it.
“Morning, Juan,” he greets him as he sees him getting out of his car and walking over to the gate, keys jingling on his chain, a sound that echoes harshly against the still silence of their surroundings.
“You were gone for over a year, and, you know, you didn’t ask me to

“Would you like a list?”
As pretty much every news outlet, exit poll and political commentator had anticipated, the President manages to secure four more years very easily, basically destroying his adversary who, in an unprecedented move, calls him up to concede a mere four hours after the vote counting has started. Celebrations begin almost immediately in the headquarters of the campaign: there are cheers, chants, rounds of applause and everyone is so drunk and loud and Tony hates every minute of it, but still he smiles and shakes hands and pats backs, receiving and dispensing congratulations, telling himself over and over that one day this will be over too. He sticks around as long as he possibly can, appearing on the stage as the President makes his victory speech and thanks the volunteers, then, when he starts to feel that anger and frustration are dangerously close to take over, he promptly makes his way out of the big hall, reaching the elevator and quickly stepping inside, pressing the button for his floor. Once arrived, he heads towards his room, touches the card key on the reader and, as the room unlocks, he gets in, quickly pushing the door locked. And immediately notices someone is already in there.
“Tony, are you okay?” Steve asks from the opposite side of the room, the first time he’s actually said anything since walking in, and Tony is surprised to realize that he had almost forgotten what it sounded like. It also has the effect of making him refocus on what was one of the goals of this meeting, which was definitely not to have a shouting match with Fury.
“See? This is how I know I have the right person for this job,” the other says, and, much to Steve’s surprise, the smile that accompanies these word is even wider than the one before.
“Shut up, just because you don’t need it doesn’t mean you get to judge people who do…” he says in return, leaving the can on his nightstand before crawling on the bed towards him, kissing his lips to shush a giggle.

He hasn’t prepared any words to say, or signs to leave behind, anything that could make the other be aware that Tony has been there, in that very room, when morning comes. When he had been trying to come up with something –
he gets there, when everyone will start wondering where he had been before then. It’s always like this with corporate events, everybody is bored out of their minds until they’re
That’s the pattern today’s morning and early afternoon had subscribed to, and Steve had just sat down to look over some new intel when the red alarm had begun blasting in his office. He had waited the standard ninety seconds to see if it stopped, and when it hadn’t, he had quickly got up and headed downstairs to meet Tony and the rest. Ten minutes later they were flying towards the emergency.In half an hour, they were facing an alien resembling a giant larva who had decided that Atlantic City looked like the perfect spot to transform into his own ‘home away from home’, for lack of a better term. The tourists on the boardwalk were excited, snapping pictures and selfies with their phones. The guests inside the casinos weren’t paying any attention instead, and Steve could swear he had spotted a security guard telling off a driver for stopping her vehicle in front of the entrance. Of course, they had tried to come to a peaceful solution - they always did - but alas, that had led nowhere, probably because they couldn’t make themselves understood. Then the alien had mistaken Wasp for a real, exotic insect - one he had to try - and had dislodged an incredibly long tongue in her direction. Mjölnir had hit the slimy appendix when it was just a couple of inches away from Janet. Needless to say, the alien hadn’t taken that blow very well. He had started deploying what looked suspiciously like micro rockets in their directions, one of which had landed right on Steve’s shield. He thought he had blocked it, or at least deviated its course, but something had gone wrong somehow because just a second later everything went bright and scorching and before he could even articulate a single sound his eyes had rolled back and he had lost consciousness.

Steve nods, sighing quietly on his lips and staying there, silent, not because he doesn’t know what to say but because he doesn’t need to.

in touch now that they have ways to actually communicate safely and exhorts them to be ready at any given time because it could happen without warning (what exactly, Tony has no idea, but it seemed like a good closing note).
Before Steve can ask him again – which undoubtedly it’s what was going to happen – he pulls his shirt again and kisses him gently, closing his eyes and breathing in his smell. He’s not a fan of reviving the recent past – too many painful memories, too many ghosts – but with everything that has been happening to him in the last year or so he’s made a promise to himself to not let a single moment go, no matter how small or insignificant it might appear in the present. When Steve kisses him back this time, he gently slips his tongue inside the other’s mouth, caressing it softly, which makes Tony quivering again with pleasure. He’s about to suggest they move somewhere else when a new voice calls out his name.

to use his suit, but Nick was right, too visible, too immediately recognizable – and they feel like among the longest of his whole life. He keeps throwing nervous glances at the rearview mirror, taking unnecessary turns and backtracking his steps just to make sure nobody is actually following him. This has never happened to him before – usually his name precedes him whenever he goes, always has, pretty soon you stop thinking of it as something out of the ordinary because it’s just your reality – so now that he

It goes as smoothly as imagined – which means, not at all: they get shouted at for the whole of seven minutes it goes on, called ‘irresponsible’ and ‘plain stupid’, and if things were still the same they were before, Tony would have cracked a joke or two about how they both were aware of that, but alas, he doesn’t. Matter of fact he keeps silent from the moment he finishes telling his plan, which doesn’t go unnoticed either.
Nothing so dramatic happens. Or maybe it

“Yeah, no shit, you started running while I was still taking my shoes off. That ain’t fair, Rogers.” he answers, slightly short of breath, throwing his head back to try and regain some.

cheerful, but he doesn’t want them to realize just how much of an old man he’s actually become since they last saw one another. They finally drive to Sam’s apartment after that, much to his relief, as he was starting to fear just exactly what next stop would be. Unfortunately, it doesn’t last very long. Time to put down his bag with the new clothes, that his two friends march into the guest room and demand he gets dressed to the nines because “we’re going out!”. Of course, he moans and groans and protests that really, he’s not in the mood and he’d much rather stay in, but they’re unmovable from their intent and after a tiring ten minutes of back and forth he resigns to the idea and puts his new clothes on. He doesn’t ask where they’re going – it wouldn’t change a thing in the great scheme of things, or that’s what he thinks in that moment. Had he known what the

doesn’t want to get punched senseless for the third time in less than twenty-four hours: he cups his face and presses his lips against Steve’s, closing his eyes as sucking softly on his bottom lip, just the way he knows the other loves. He stays still for a whole minute, and when he finally leans back, short of breath, he immediately searches for Steve’s eyes, to spot the recognition of their connection.
But he can’t. Frustrated, he leans back against the chair and turns to look at Steve, who’s holding the two chopsticks in the palm of his right hand, studying them as they were hiding some deep secret behind their natural appearance.
He keeps moving, faster but not harder, because he doesn’t feel anything anymore: not the urge from his body,
But Tony has no intention of obeying, so he follows the stream of nurses in the room, standing aside as to not obstruct their maneuvers.

“Does it mean we’re stuck here forever?” Steve asks, and by god, his voice is properly trembling now.
“See you tomorrow, Steve. Good night.”
if you weren’t in the middle of a deranging campaign against yourself? Tony knows he needs to stop, to take a step back and smile and say ‘I’m sorry’ even if he doesn’t mean it, not one bit, but he just can’t, and instead his other hand abandon the can to meet the pavement and goes looking for the other man’s, only for his fingers to find shredded pork meat and purple cabbage, soaked in unhealthy oil.
“You surely know how to make a fella feel important,” he comments, because yes, now that it has been said, he remembers a conversation they had a few weeks back about this subject, one that he didn’t win – he rarely does when it comes down to this topic; still it’s kind of nice being reminded of it, right now.
“You know it, Cap,” he replies with a smile, before he adds, giggling: “No running this time, though. I think I’m so full I might collapse if I attempt anything like that after dinner once more.”
“Crap.”
This doesn’t make any sense, and if it wasn’t for the dead-ass serious look on the other’s face and his hardened eyes, Tony would think he was trying to fool him. So although deep down he

“Well, you should go find someone to dance it with then,” Grant suggests, and although it isn’t an offer, there’s something about the way his eyes naturally find Tony’s that sends shivers down his spine and keeps him from speaking, afraid that he might indeed say what he’s thinking out loud.

“Hey, handsome…” he says softly, approaching him from behind. Steve lifts up his head just in time as Tony lets his arms fall gently on the other man’s chest.
“You too?” Tony asks, not expecting such a response from him. It somehow feels odd, out of place. He lifts up his eyes on him, to see if he’s heard it right.
“Do you… have a plan or something? What can I do? What about those kids you told me about?”
“Come on, Steve, I—“
“Uh, tempting, but I mean it. Let’s get out of here.”

“Sounds good. Enjoy the rest of your evening, guys. Tony. Steve.” he says bye, and the moment after he’s disappeared into an orange circle.
“I’ll try my best” he replies, and for a bit they’re able to keep walking in silence. The landscape around them appears to be never changing, except for a square-shaped building that emerges – seemingly out of nowhere – about half an hour after they’ve started their journey. But that’s just about it; the rest is just the grass and the motionless river he saw when he first opened his eyes. There’s no wind at all, nor animals or sounds. Everything is still, as in a painting.

“Yeah, sorry, meant to stop by after we got back from space but, y’know, been busy and shit.”
“That is… absolutely disgusting…” he mutters, their lips still locked together, and his remark sends Steve out in a frantic laughter that finally interrupts their kiss. He looks down at his hand, shaking it rapidly as he tries to resist the urge to clean it off against his shirt, because

, stays quiet and follows him for the time being, speaking only once they’ve inside, about to take the stairs.
On the plane back to Arlington, Tony asks for a constant refill of coffee whenever his mug is empty and then gets working on what he has now subbed as ‘Avengers Protocol’, aka the project on which Bruce and he have been working on. He revisits all of their past annotations and calculations, making sure they’re correct, and then spends the rest of the journey working out the final touches, because now that he knows for sure that’s what is going to get him a reliable connection with his friends, he seems unable to stop until he gets it done. Plus, as he keeps repeating to himself, the sooner he passes on incriminating evidence, the sooner this joke of administration gets thrown out of the government, the sooner Steve and he can move on with their life, together. Every single time that thought hits his brain, he can’t help but smiling cheekily to himself, and his gaze unmistakably lowers down to the tags hidden underneath his shirt, which have now become the main thing he’s preoccupied with even though he’s only had them for twenty-four hours or so. He could swear he can hear them jingling against his reactor when he walks, or see them creating a peculiar reflection on the ceiling when he’s lying in bed in the darkness of his suite, or sometimes he feels them even against his bare skin, whenever a sudden movement makes them turn around his neck and end up on his back. Although at first he promises himself to take them off before going to his office, he fails at that after just a day, so he switches his ordinary colorful wardrobe to exclusively dark shirts to minimize the risk of them being spotted by people, and sprays them with a special military paint that he gets ahold of on the black market so to make them undetectable to the security screening on his way inside the Pentagon. He takes his showers, jogs, practices boxing with them on – nothing is off limits, to the point they become almost an integral part of him; the only time he doesn’t
“Yeah, well, I was getting
to also have Iron Man against the government!”
“JARVIS? Was I in a fight?” he asks, repeating the question once again when no reply comes.
Before he can complete the question, Steve kisses him again, this time deeper, sliding his tongue into the other’s mouth for good measure, figuring he needs to be more assertive if he hopes that the topic will be put aside for a bit longer. And now Tony finally understands what is going on, because he smiles on his lips as getting goosebumps on his skin and he moves closer, his free hand caressing Steve’s chest and abs while they keep kissing, breathing his smell in to help his mind letting go of his thoughts.
. As they make their way out of the club and into the lobby of a nearby hotel,
They tell you that you make your own luck, or that there’s such a thing as destiny, but he doesn’t think it’s true. For the most part, you’re born into an already designed pattern that your family and ancestors prepared for you, and in it there’s just a tiny wriggling room for you to make your decisions. His own was a tad more physical than most people’s – it being an actual cave and all – but that doesn’t alter the fact that ending up in there has been the single defining event in his whole life. If that hadn’t happened, he would have probably stayed an arm manufacturer till his death, never become a superhero, never fought ‘villains’, possibly never even met gods or aliens or talking animals (although he can’t possibly be sure about this last part). But a smartass had decided it was a solid deal to kidnap him, so in a hot, damp, subterranean refuge he had found himself coming up with an idea that would change everything.

It takes a couple of days to actually get the ball rolling – T’Challa can’t get away any earlier and Rhodey is on a mission over Afghanistan when he calls him – but that gives them time to put together a vague resemblance of a ceremony – that is, if you think building an arc with some wood and dragging one of the tables outside to serve as an altar qualify as such. After downloading a ton of data from the internet, Jocasta puts herself in charge of the decorations, throwing flowers all over the path Tony made through the sand, around the table and on the chairs, with Steve joining in pretty soon. He stands there, looking at them, and can’t help shaking his head to himself, because it all seems surreal and weird and now that it’s actually happening he doesn’t know whether they should be really doing it.
judgement – and not General Ross’s – been trusted instead of believing I was, I don’t know, pining after Rogers or something.” Which obviously was what he had spent an awful lot of time doing, but thank got they couldn’t possibly know that. He hadn’t planned to go ballistic like this, but something inside just didn’t like the subtle accusation that had been moved against him and he knew he had to set the record straight there and then, before they thought it was his weakness. Which, again, of course it is, but he would deny it on his deathbed if it helped the case.
He stops now, looks down and hides his face behind his arm, the tears that are crossing his cheeks seem to freeze immediately as they come out, burning against his skin like if they were made of fire, and maybe in a way they really are, at least that would explain why exactly they hurt so fucking much. It’s been a year already, and sometimes he can’t believe it because it feels just like yesterday that Tony was alive and smirking at him, daring to kiss him in front of the team if he was indeed as brave as he was always saying he was, both of them tired of keeping a secret that everybody else around them knew about anyway. And so he had, and people had clapped, and Tony had kept him there on his lips and whispered how much he loved him, and in that moment he had believed it really was worth it. But then other times he would give himself panic attacks when he thought he couldn’t remember Tony’s voice, or the sound of his laughter, or the way he’d caught the brunet staring at him for no particular reason, how he’d smile and look away, pretending to be embarrassed to have been caught whereas both of them knew he couldn’t care less. And maybe it’s this, more than anything else, what has been proving to be  the most difficult part of it all, because it’s like time now is so bent over than doesn’t make any sense anymore, and for someone who was

Next thing I know, something like a spark comes out of nowhere and this passage appears. Same with the cave.

Steve, who has stayed silent throughout his recounting, doesn’t say a word still for a minute or so, possibly mulling over the amount of shit that has just been regurgitated onto him. He takes a sip from his bottle, and Tony has to look away because every time he’s not delivering bad news all he can think about is kissing the man next to him and touching him and getting lost in his smell and his body. But he can’t, not now – who actually knows

. It’s only a couple of days later, during lunch time, that he learns in a conversation their lines have been wired to receive and make only what the military denotes as “approved calls”. Which definitely don’t comprehend homosexual one night stands.
“A couple of months, a couple of years, I can’t say for certain right now.”
“Of course they’re not regular glasses, what was I thinking…” Steve replies, looking up with an expression that makes him look silly on purpose. Once again Tony has to hold a chuckle back.

– he stops halfway through pulling the cables off when the date comes back to his mind and he realizes with a wave of panic that he hasn’t contacted Steve ever since. He gets ahold of his phone again and quickly types in a message: ‘Sorry for being AWOL, things have been crazy. Tomorrow okay?’ He sends it via normal messaging, the one that doesn’t require internet access, and for the first time since meeting him he’s actually glad Steve was born in the twentieth century. The reply arrives not even five minutes later: ‘Tomorrow is great.’
“That was a long time ago. It’s more of a nickname nowadays. They insisted I had to have one but I couldn’t come up with anything so it sorta stuck.”
“A-Afghanistan?”
“Sooo… How long has it been going on?”
Steve doesn’t quite know what to say, so he stays silent instead. They look into each other’s eyes for a brief bunch of seconds, as if they were trapped in some freezing spell, then before too much time goes by and Steve leans in exactly how it’s bound to happen – how it happened many times before – Tony breaks the eye contact, stepping aside to allow the shutter to close again. Then, without further ado, he starts towards the exit, talking as he walks away.
“Damn, you know about Indiana? Supposed to be a secret…”
“You could have just knocked…”
He lets her go, and she invites him to sit down; Tony lets himself go on one of the chairs, the exhaustion of a long day catching up on him – although he has no way of measuring how long he has actually been awake for by now.
right now.”
As he walks down the newly finished hallway he can’t help but feeling a bit antsy, a knot in his throat and his heart beat slightly accelerated; it’s not because he doesn’t think Steve wants to see him – Steve would never dismiss him like that – it’s more because his mind can’t help but wondering if the other man can already feel like this is his new
, he ponders,
The next thing he knows he’s staring straight into Nick Fury’s face.
A sigh of relief escapes his mouth. He hasn’t been made, this is just club chatter. He’s still just a man amongst others. No need to panic.
“I never said it was a good plan, only that it was our best shot.”
“You’re joking.” Carol replies, stumped, as she softly pats her girlfriend’s back to give her some relief.
“Two…”
“Tony.”
And Steve does, because he doesn’t see what would be the point in arguing about that. Plus, Fury is right, Loki still has the other rings and chances are he’s realized by now he needs the missing tenth to get them to work properly.
, he tells himself,
“Whatever for?”
with which it hits him is a total surprise. Still, he can’t bring himself to care, the panic attack is on the verge of breaking out now, his chest feels as tight as if stripped onto a hospital bed and he feels like his skin is boiling up. He shoves Steve with all the energy he’s got left in him, and it’s only now that he notices a terrifyingly familiar blue light coming from one of the other’s pockets; even in the midst of all this, he can’t lie to himself about what that could be. Because surely enough, if his supposition is correct, then…
“It’s okay, Captain, we haven’t quite started yet,” T’Challa explains, his eyes briefly stopping on Tony’s to remind him that the previous conversation is far from over, although he’s going to glass over it for the time being. Which is fine, because right now Tony has Steve to deal with. Or, better,
As surprise and awe run through their veins, they see the automaton taking a tentative hand to its opposite arm to push a button there. A second later, cracking and screeching, the front of the armor opens up to reveal something none of them had ever even considered.
Tony has been to many a wedding in his lifetime – especially before becoming Iron Man and even more so before his parents died – mostly because, as his father never failed to remind him, being a Stark mostly meant doing things you don’t necessarily
“I don’t know what you remember, but those missiles that thing was shooting at us, well, one exploded right between your feet, sent you flying quite a few feet away. I only caught a shadow of something being thrown off, thought it was a bin or a table, not…” he pauses, shaking his head, and sighs softly before continuing: “Anyway, then I heard Janet yelling your name, saw it was you…”
But Tony cuts him off, because although it’s always fun to tease the General like this, he’s grown tired of the game and of his overall attitude as if he could never lose. Plus, there are other stuff he needs to take care of at the compound and he wants to be gone before Steve gets back from wherever he’s gone.
“Deal.”
“I don’t think you’re strong enough to go

, he calls again, and when he gets no answer, the sense of loss overcomes his body, giving it a light twitch of frustration and misery. But then little by little he starts to feel safe for some unknown reason, the room he’s in becomes clearer, and when he calls the other’s name again he could swear he hears his voice saying something to him, although he can’t exactly make out
“Private, please, enough of this. I don’t know

Surely enough, the headache is there, and a quick look at his reflection in the mirror further reveals a few nasty bruises all over his face, one dangerously close to his right eye.

A month goes by, and after the first couple of weeks of absolute madness and chaos the situation seems to gradually settle down to just ordinary administration, if you can call ‘ordinary’ having to deal with world crisis every other day or trying to come up with ideas as to smuggle your tech inside your office – the Pentagon, unsurprisingly, has one of the best security systems he’s ever seen, and that’s saying a lot. By the end of February, Tony starts to show signs of restlessness: even before becoming an Avenger, staying still had never been a skill he had mastered, his brain constantly needing stimulation and problems to solve, but now that he has a desk he can’t disassemble or destroy, no lab to speak of, and all he does day in and day out is having to

about this? You met them, right? What do you think?”
He sighs deeply and throws a quick glance to his companion, trying to guess whether he’s having similar thoughts or not. Surely enough, words quickly come out of his mouth: “You alright, Steve?”
“Do you guys mind to give me a lift?”
“Except it’s not, Steve, not

he can’t help but thinking, and has to hide away the impulse of a laughter.
“Why didn’t you ever tell me all of this?”
“Not at all. Hard to sleep in this cold anyway. What’s up?”
Steve lets his hand go, freeing his mouth, but Tony doesn’t have words to say for once, because it seems like their minds are communicating again, silently exchanging words and thoughts as they used to before shit went down; that’s the best feeling he has ever experienced in his life, and he was missing it so damn much. How many nights had he been staying up, wondering if this would ever happen again, being connected so deeply to another person that all it takes is a look or a gesture to transform ideas into actions, fear into reassurance, pain into joy? As these invisible links are connecting again, Tony catches Steve’s free hand with his and intertwines their fingers together, stepping in closer and starting to kiss him slowly, closing his eyes and focusing on the movements of his own lips, as if they were somehow able to convey secret meanings, inexplicable with words. The other isn’t surprised by this out-of-the-blue gesture and doesn’t hesitate to reciprocate, squeezing his hand so tightly that it starts to ache, but Tony takes little notice of it, because this instant that turns into minutes has lingered in his mind for so long that had become a parasite, always present, always ready to pop up unexpectedly, causing him pain and anger and resentment because why would you ever throw away something

“That’s bullshit, Rogers, and you fucking know it!” he replies, turning to face him again, and much to his surprise he finds the other mere inches away from him. How – and when – did it happen? He hasn’t heard him coming closer, and is not prepared to face him at such short distance. He

his appointment. There will be plenty of time after to offer a consolation hug, or to try and make him laugh (when was the last time he did that? He can’t remember, but he’s almost certain Tony had done that too). He’s not hungry – he rarely is nowadays – so he puts on the espresso machine and after it’s warmed up, he inserts two capsules into it and adds just a splash of cold milk in a small glass, stirs everything together and swallows it down at once. He hates it, it’s so bitter he almost feels like he’s going to be sick, but that’s the way Tony used to take his coffee in the morning, so now he does too, as if carrying on these little routines helped to ease the pain (it doesn’t, and he knows this, but still can’t bring himself to stop it).
