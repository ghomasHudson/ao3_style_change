“You will.” Dean assured. “I heard what you and Sam where talking about. Cas, I’ll respect whatever descision you make, but I want you to live not just for Jack and the pack, but also for yourself. All you’ve ever talked about was that clinic, back when we were in school. I want you to have that. I’ll support and help you in whatever way you need. I’ll take care of Jack while your in class and I’ll make sure you have study sessions with Sam so you can get all your work done. So please, we’ll do whatever we can, so please follow your calling. I never wanted you to be a stay at home omega. You’re not like that. I want you to thrive here. So please, talk to the university here and see what is availible.”
The pack house was nothing like Cas was expecting. He was expecting an actual house, not a lodge. As they drove up he had to keep himself from staring slack jawed.
“Give him a moment.” She told him. “Let him be in his nest with his pup. Go call Micheal then go check on him.”
Cas looked like he wanted to object- like he normally would when it came to poking around his friend’s mind.
Dean pressed his lip into a line before nodding. He didn’t want to scare Cas after meeting for the first time in six years. And he doubted he could rein in his scent at this point.
“Oh,” Cas breathed, an uneasy smile crossing his lips. “No, it’s just a hobby. I like remedies and modern medicine, it fasinates me.”
“The hell did you just say to my mate.” Dean snarled, he had seen Cas shoot up from his bench and smelled the defensive scent he was putting off, so he scooped up Jack and marched up behind the omega. “Pal, I don’t know who the hell you are, but you better apologize and walk the hell away, now.”
“Just that he was our brother, and that he didn’t want to talk about the matter with his mate’s parents just yet. He wanted to meet us first.” Dean said tensely.
“And what does my little angel want for breakfast today?” Dean asked as he carried his seven-year-old into the kitchen.
Dean looked to her, then to the assembled pack members. They all stood ready for his orders. This was a direct attack on their pack. Intruders came and tried to take their packmate. For most packs, this was considered an act of war.
“Hey easy pal.” this world’s Dean tells alternate Dean who was looking around wildly. “Don’t do anything crazy alright.”
“Jo, Ash, and Charlie will clean up.” Ellen told Dean, waving off her pup’s complaints. “You and Sam show Cas and Jack around.”
“Go to school.” Sam clarified. “We are more than happy to watch Jack in the pack while you attened classes, and if it’s something you really want to do, I say go for it.”
“Take the pups inside, get Sam and Dean, go now.” Cas told her, ushering all of them towards the door.
Dean, had to look away from him to keep Cas from seeing the pleased smile he now wore at hearing that. It wasn’t polite, since it was his alpha more than anything else that was pleased to have his pup and prefered mate so close. Dean was just happy to have Cas on pack grounds, this just made it better.
“Dean?” her voice pitched in surprise and exhaustion letting him know just how bad his angel was suffering.
Unable to stop herself, Cas smiled a small watery smile looking down at her belly and rubbing it gently.
She now works as the pack IT and that of the two sheriff departments. But mostly she develops indi games that people can play for free.
"Sorry about the mess." Cas called over his shoulder as he bustled around his studio apartment. "I wasn't expecting company."
The Novaks where an old fashioned, traditional sick pack as Naomi had just demonstrated. Their oldest where a pair of alpha twins, Micheal was already mated to an omega and taking over the pack last Dean heard, while Lucifer was kicked out for challenging their father. After that, there was a whole slew of beta children that served Micheal and worked to keep the pack together. Then there were the two omegas. The youngest, Gabriel, and then Castiel. Both with a set bigger than any alpha could hope to have. Which didn’t sit well with the rest of the pack. So Dean assumed Gabriel was being forced to mate with an alpha or was being sent away. It actually surprised him he was here.
“WE WON’T TELL YOU AGAIN!” Chuck was practically screaming, his face red, his eyes blazing with fury. “GET YOUR ASS IN THE CAR NOW, OR SO HELP ME I WILL KILL YOUR BASTARD!”
“Okay.” she nodded, her eyes clouding over darkly, sadly as she looked up to Dean. “I promise, I won’t take it off yet. I don’t want to hurt Daddy ever again.”
They all froze at the small voice. Staring wide-eyed and terrified at the little girl who was looking up blurrily at Cas. Were they gonna have to explain to her that they weren’t her real family? How would she react to that? What do they do?
“What do you know about him?” Sam asked, wanting to get a good idea before he said anything too damning.
“Just go with Sam tomorrow,” Dean urged. “Just try, if you can’t get in at all, then that’s that. But just try, for yourself and our pup. Set an example for him.”
Dorthy, an alpha, was one of Jody’s deputies and would come with her and Donna to the Road House, and that is how she met and mated Charlie an omega.
But his omega was so close, he could feel it. The omega that had invaded his mind and had his heart throbbing for six years was so close. And he could barely control himself.
“Don’t you dare speak to me like that.” she snarled back. “You call yourself an alpha, yet you bend to the whims of an omega. How pathetic are you.”
“Micheal was very fond of libraries and churches.” Cas offered. “Old fashioned places if you will. He would often sit in either for hours on end just reading whatever theology or religious text he found interesting.”
Turning Dean found that Cas had fallen to her knees and was clutching her stomach as her eyes blink between her sky blue to glowing grace as their daughter clung to her side, tears streaming down her face.
“Daddy!” he cried, gripping the alpha as tightly as his little arms could. “Where were you, why weren’t you here when mommy cried? Where were you?”
“Castiel hasn’t been part of my pack since Amara announced that they were leaving.” Micheal affirmed. “I had no wish to keep them against their will. My parents don’t feel the same it seems.”
They were dressed in white tunics and slacks, and flower crowns on their heads. Peonies for a long happy relationship, forget-me-nots for true love, and violets for loyalty made for them by Rowena.
“You can’t just go through life without reading the books that these fandoms stemmed from.” she snorted.
Nodding, Dean rubbed his chin and catching sight of Jack just as he leapt from the swing only to rush back and pester Sam to push him again. He smiled as the boy giggled and beamed. Cas watched him, seeing the torrent of joy and fear swirl in his eyes.
“I’ll take her somewhere safe,” Cas concluded, glancing to Jack who looked sad but nodded. “I’ll keep her safe.”
“And we’re going to be the best of friends.” Charlie told Cas, bumping his shoulder getting an awkward smile out of him.
“Daddy!” El cried, now jumping out of Sam’s arms and into Dean’s lap wrapping her arms the best she could around his shoulders. “You’re okay, the bad man didn’t hurt you?”
“Yeah, pup, I’m your dad.” he said tensely, waiting for the explosion, possitive or negative, he was prepared for both.
“‘En as high priestess aye th’ Winchester pack, Ah recognize Dean an’ Castiel as mates in th’ eyes aye th’ gods an’ thaur fellow packmates. Yu weel bae bonded now an’ fure’er more.”
“To make you an offer.” Dean assured him. “To tell you that there is a way for you to take the mark but never hurt anyone again. Hell, you might even be reunited with Colette.”
“He came to our world.” alternate Dean gasped. “He told us that he wanted to make us a deal. I kill El, and our world survives.”
Castiel, his Castiel, the woman, the angel he had hoped to be with for the rest of his life, was pregnant with his child. His half Knight of Hell child. What in the hell does he do here. Pull out his gun and shoot it?
It was another four hours before they finally breached the town limits of Lawrence. From there they let Google guide them to the corner where the store was located.
They were in the study, Cas was rocking the toddler in his arms and humming what sounded like Rambling On. Dean eyed him. Looking between him and the girl.
“I’m not going anywhere with you.” Castiel snarled back. “I’m no longer part of your pack. I’m part of the Winchester pack. I’m staying here.”
“I see.” he looked around again, unable to stop himself from envisioning the way he wants the room set up.
“Like I said, Bobby desgined it.” Dean shrugged. “And actually, all the rooms are this big and have their own bathrooms and such. I made sure of that, if I was getting my own floor for my family, then the rest of the rooms better be that same size as mine. And all the walk in closets are lager than standart so omegas or whoever else can make nests when they need it.”
By the time El was ready to come to the world, they had come to this odd understanding and cordial ease with Rowena. It helped that she was a bit less evil as of late. And she was more than ready to bless El with the protection spell making it clear to both heaven and hell that Ellen Jo-Mary Winchester was off-limits.
“What the hell?” Dean asked no one, eyeing the bloodied version of himself as the rift closed in on itself.
“I can’t.” Dean shook his head. “I wish I could. But the life I live now, Cas, that is no life for you. You deserve so much better. You deserve a lodge in the woods, with loved ones and with the biggest garden you could want so you can watch the bees. Not the backseat of a car and crap hotel rooms. I will get that for you, Cas. I’ll get that and I will come back and take you home. I promise.”
He later got the tongue lashing of a lifetime from Ellen for slacking on the job, but he also gained a friend for life.
Dean choked on that, Jack looked uncomfortable and Sam snorted out of humor at his brother's expense and horror from the image that penetrated his mind.
“I hope we get the chance to talk more,” Cas told him. “And thank you, for making my brother a better alpha. An alpha I always knew he could be.”
The brothers shared a look, Sam tilting his head in a “what do we have to lose” gesture and Dean rolls his eyes admitting defeat.
“Wait.” Sam couldn’t help the chuckle that escaped his lips. “Other Dean got to experience pregnancy? He was vicariously pregnant?”
Cas smiled, proud, and amazed with Dean’s speech. Sam nodded, knowing that if there was one thing Bobby slammed into their brains it was this. Their father lost sight of that. Most alphas, gone unchallenged or raised poorly forget this. But Dean, he took the words that Bobby told him to heart and believed them to be the absolute truth. Lived and died by those words.
“Either that’s God or another rip in realities.” Dean snarked hoping to turn a tense situation into something less so.
“Listen,” He told Cas now, just as hushed. “I won’t let them take you. You’re my omega, the mother to my pup and my pack. They will not have you.”
A look of shattering relief and awe spread across Dean's face as the words reached him letting Dean deflate on himself and breath naturally again.
Walking up to the front door Dean took a deep breath and tried to keep his scent as pleasant and calming as possible. From what he remembered the Novaks were not fond of random alphas. Which is why he had Sam stay in the car. He knocked once and waited.
“You mean more to me than anything in this world or any other.” she urged. “But this isn’t you. Not the real you.”
“Dean.” Bobby nodded, going to his mate and pecking her on the forehead. Standing back up to his full height he locked eyes on Cas and Jack. “And these must be our new members.”
“Ssh!” Cas hissed, looking down at the stirring girl, waiting till she settled before continuing. “In this other world, I didn’t possess Jimmy Novack. Instead, I was still in the body of the woman Jessa Danielson, the woman I joined within this universe in 1901. For the most part, their story played out the same as ours in this world, however, they apparently had a strong attraction to each other. When their Dean became a demon through the mark of Cain, he found his Castiel and they had sex.”
“Yeah.” Dean smield, nuzzling the pup. “I’ll take you home, you and your mom, we’ll be happy now. I promise.”
“An obedient omega?” he laughed, more of a bark really. “Do you even hear yourself? Did you even really know your son? He was not a typical omega.”
Watching his brotherly wearily, Sam knew this was also on Dean’s mind. His knuckles went white against the wheel and a snarl fought to get past his lips. Sam wondered how long Dean has been worrying at this.
“I told him he should write a book about it. Maybe become a teacher and teach it.” Micheal sighed. “But he still feels like he has an obligation to the family and his father. It’s slow going, but I think I’ll get him there.”
“Who are you?” Dean demanded finding his gun useless, he clutched at the demon knife behind his back.
“Are you sure?” Sam asked. “No you’re right, it’s worth a shot. Thanks, we will hopefully be home soon.”
Chuck and Naomi are arrested and placed in Jody’s cruiser, kicking and screaming, swearing to Cas and Micheal.
She reached into her shirt pulling out Dean’s god-seeking necklace, holding it up for them all to see.
“You don’t have a choice.” uncapping the vial, he pressed himself against her fully pressing her harshly into the wall and gripping her chin so she had no choice to open her mouth. “There we go.”
He went back upstairs, peeking into his room to make sure he wasn’t imposing on his mate. But he was lying peacefully in his bed. This had an odd primal effect on Dean. His alpha preened at the sight of his omega in his bed, surrounded by his scent and protected. Like Dean had made this den just for his omega. Cas was curled up in the center of the bed, wrapped around Dean’s pillow, his face pressed into it. Another primal reaction, his omega enjoyed being surrounded by his scent too.
Thinking to be just a little polite, at least in the start, Dean knocked on the door to the studio apartment and waited for his angel to answer. He knew it would be a shock for her once she realized. He also knew she would realize the second she saw him. And she most certainly did.
“Charles and Naomi Novak, you have both committed an egregious treason to our pack and alpha by outreaching your rank and going behind Micheal’s back to sell an unwilling omega, which already is against our laws, but also an omega that isn’t even apart of our pack and already mated. You have shown a distinct lack of respect to our alpha and our laws, and for this, you both will be banished from our pack. You will not have our protection any longer.”
“When I died, the mark turned me.” he informed, tilting his head to keep her eyes. “Is it that bad?”
This was his child. Yes, it was a part-demon but he had met one of those. Jesse was a sweet kid despite his parents. But it was also part angel- which wasn’t any better now that he thought about it. But it was part him, the human him, and part Cas.
“They went to Kansas.” Gabe shrugged. “Said that if you were to ever settle down anywhere it would be there. He’s been waiting for you. So you better not keep him waiting any longer.”
Arriving in the town that they had once lived in so long ago, Dean felt a sense of nostalgia wash over him. His time here was longer than any other town. His dad left them while he went hunting a pack of rogues in the next town over. They were there for three months. And in those three months, Dean had met the love of his natural life.
“It’s clear that this little act isn’t going to work unless you have all the facts,” Cas told them. “I’m going to share the memories I’ve received to make this all easier on us.”
Sam snickered at his brother’s antics while Jack just looked between two of his three dads curiously.
“It took the whole pack like half a year to build it, plus the extra cabins.” Sam snorted as he was trying to help Jack out of his seat belt- which wasn’t easy since the boy wouldn’t stop squirming.
“I know.” Adam nodded, with a look of ‘no, really, I would never have guessed’. “When my first heat came, I was just out of high school. I was planning on going to college. My mom and I actually thought I was a beta, or we hopped. But then, one summer day…”
“Yeah!” she cheered, leaping into Cas’s waiting arms. “Scooby-doobie-doobie-doo, we’re gonna follow you~”
“Of course it won’t be like before, we have a pup and we’re not even mated.” Cas said. “I just, I just want to find the right moment.”
“Cas.” Dean gritted again, struggling to keep his cool. “With everything that’s going on, I don’t want us to mate just to fix it all.”
“He didn’t know.” Cas jumped in, worried this woman may actually kill Dean. “I found out a while after he left. He didn’t know.”
“Yes ma’am.” Dean nodded leading Cas and his pup to the stairs. “C’mon. Most of the pack lives on second floor, those who don’t live in the cabins with their families. Garth and Bess, Jody and Donna and the girls. Rowena and Catch have their own cabin but that’s because we forced them to. Their loud.”
There was too much going on for them to beat around this. They needed to talk. They needed to come to an understanding. They had a child coming. They needed to stand together in this.
“You are ego-driven, power-hungry sub-humans.” Micheal snarled. “And you are a threat to our new alliance.”
“Cas!” Dean barked, pausing to make sure that the girl didn’t wake. “We get it, just get on with the story.”
“What’s the matter, Winchester?” Jo, a feisty blonde who liked to get under the skin, smirked. “You afraid of my mom?”
“Who cares, Micheal’s is in charge and the one who sent me to her, and after he mated with Adam he’s less of a douche than he used to be. If mother had her way I’d been mated to some Colonel Sanders looking assclown named Asmodeus.”
It was run down and abandoned long ago. Barley a pile of splinters resting on stilts. But even from the car park in front of the building, Dean would feel the power inside.
They were sitting in a diner, in a booth meant for ten at the most. Cas was sitting closest to the wall, then Dean with Sam being at the open end. They took the closest booth to the door so they could leave quickly should this meeting turn ugly.
“No.” Cas snapped, shaking his head. “You won’t listen to me, but you might listen to your own pack alpha.”
They packed in silence, with Jack’s excited explanations about his toys to Dean being the only sound around them.
“Don’t worry Cas.” Ellen rolled her eyes. “He was in the back away from the drunks. And whenever he had a knife in his hand I made sure Jo or I were with him. Otherwise, he was reading his books.”
“It’s gone.” he breathed, feeling for the first time like he could breathe cleanly again like every breath didn’t feel like it was being choked out of him. “Sammy, it’s really gone.”
“I will go talk to Micheal,” Adam started after they paid the bill.  “And call you. He’ll most likely want to talk about all this.”
“Should I?” Dean asked Charlie, the only omega in the room but also the only one he could ask without feeling like a dick.
“We don’t want the pup.” Naomi rolled her eyes like Dean was taking too long to understand all this. “You can keep it, it’s yours anyway. We’ve only come to take our son back so he can get the money he owes us.”
“Enough already.” the younger Winchester had enough with all this angst and aggression, he put himself between the door and Dean and squared his shoulders. “No matter what it was I won’t judge. Dean, you need to talk about this and get it out because it is eating you up completely. And I can’t help either of you unless I know what’s going on. So please, just tell me.”
“Can’t you let me have this?” Dean sighed. “I can’t even have a proper vow ceremony because we’re still waiting for psycho-rents to come knocking on the door. Just let me bask in the afterglow of finally connecting with my mate.”
"Her full name is Ellen Jo-Marry Winchester," he began. "She is five years old, and she is a Nephilim and a cambion."
“He is a grown man.” Micheal roared. “And not part of our pack. And more than that, it is not your decision who he mates with, it’s mine as pack alpha by our own traditions. What you have done is extremely disrespectful not only to Castiel and Dean, but to me as your pack alpha.”
“You can touch me, Dean.” Cas told him. “If I am going to be part of your pack, scenting and touching is going to be common.”
“... I don’t know, maybe Rowena can help us. I mean she tried to kill you only to find that the curse won’t let you die. This thing probably scares her just as much as it scares the rest of us. It would be in her best interest to help us get rid of it.”
“Let’s at least get him up on a bed.” Cas offered, which Jack nodded to using their strength to carry him to the nearest cot making him groan and wake.
“That is not what this is about!” Cas exclaimed, getting closer to the alpha. “You were so good, you waited for me and now I’m telling you that your wait is over. So why are you even fighting this.”
“I don’t need your permission!” Cas exclaimed. “I’m not part of your pack anymore! Now leave before my alpha rips your throats out!”
“Really.” El’s eyes lit up at the idea of having a new friend, but the light dimmed suddenly as she looked down. “Does he have to wear one of these too?”
“C’mon kid, let’s get your stuff so we can go meet everyone.” Dean smiled as he ushered the boy to his toy chest.
Jumping in her panic she rushed to close the door on him. But it was effortless for him to shove it open and enter. So instead she tried to run, but he caught her. Grabbing her by her upper arms he backed her into the nearest wall.
Supernatural was this mobile game based on a book series about two brothers that hunted monsters. The game lets you choose between either being an angel, demon, reaper, monster, or hunter and go about the game trying to kill other players that were against your race. It was fun, Dean even played it.
“You’re wrong.” Cas laughed, gesturing to the land and cabins around them. “He did all this for me and our future pups. He went off to make a strong pack for me. He loves me and our pup more than anything, and if you threaten me or Jack again he will end you. If I don’t do it first.”
“Yes.” she snarled, using her new power to push him across the room so he was sprawling on the floor.
As his pup, Jack would be drawn to Dean, for comfort and safety. Though this is the first time they met. So these new smells were probably confusing the pup. Best to let him come to Dean before they did anything else. Slowly, Jack came closer, and closer, till he was pressing himself to Dean’s chest. Letting out his own alpha purr, Dean picked up the pup and cradled him as he stood straight.
“My name is Ramiel Prince.” He said, slowly, almost like he was attempting to be seductive. “I’m your future mate.”
Cas cocked his head letting that little bit of information sink in. All this time they were so close. In the same state anyway.
Cas followed, looking back long enough to watch as Sam plopped his pup into an armchair before going to his own books.
The pack was one of the greatest things to happen to him, a family that actually cared. He loved it.
Instead of answering, she simply smiled and let her power flow as her eyes glowed. Instantly Dean was filled with memories of Cas and the baby. Of when she found out and how scared she was. When she felt her move for the first time and how she was filled with overwhelming love. To now, how she could feel her daughter stir every time she heard her daddy’s voice.
"How did you find me?" Cas asked, he and Dean were sitting on the bench while Sam took Jack to the swings.
“You bet.” Gabriel smirked, looking over Dean’s shoulder to the house. “Saw you talking to mommy dearest. I assume you’re here to make good on that promise you made six years ago.”
“Dean?” she asked, looking scared, covering herself back up and backing up a bit. “Please say something.”
“This is the emergency number of the Novak pack, if you’ve reached this number then it must be important, I’m a bit busy but as soon as I get your message I’ll call you back. Please leave your name and number.”
As they struggled to lift the dead weight into the box, she started drawing a set of glyphs on the side of the box with sandalwood ash before stepping back as they shut and locked it and throwing her hand in the air.
“As you can see,” she petered off, glancing up at him. “I’m dying. The grace I took is fading. I have maybe a month left.”
“Stow it.” Dean gritted. “You wanted to know, now you know. Don’t go throwing your sympathy at a monster.”
“We better go home,” Cas told him, taking Jack who was reaching for him. “We have to gather the pack. This ends today.”
The bar owner, Ellen Harvel, she and her daughter Jo were both alphas with strong wills and took shit from no one. Ellen was mated to a turse old bounty hunter turned mechanic named Bobby Singer. The old alpha was actually how he got the job at Ellen’s bar. Bobby and John Winchester went way back. Bobby was the one who helped the salty hunter get into the life. Now Bobby was retired and worked at his shop. When Dean rolled around he directed him to Ellen who took him on and worked him like a dog.
“But…” Cas took a breath, bracing himself emotionally for what he was going to say next. “I think, it would be best for Jack and I to take a room close to you. Which one do you think is big enough for the both of us?”
“That day he really pissed off Bart, the alpha would have killed him and my parents would have let him, and even though Micheal was our alpha he was still new.” he paused as Dean let loose a snarl, then continued when he calmed down. “He didn't have Adam yet, and still did whatever dad told him. Thank the Gods for that kid, my brother finally got a pair after him and started to think for himself. I think mostly because he was afraid about losing the kid, still, this happened before that. My aunt Amara stepped in. She put the alpha in his place and took Cas away, announcing that they were leaving the pack. My mother tried to stop her, but well, you know how auntie is.”
“I may have been keeping in touch with my baby brother since he dicked off.” Gabriel cocked his head. “But if I tell you, you got to do something for me.”
The weeks that followed had Dean running around the town and bunker to make sure his family wanted for nothing. He would get odd foods for Cas and buy random bits of clothing for the baby whenever he saw something that caught his eye as well as toys and blankies. He could feel Sam chuckling at him every time he rushed past the younger brother but he couldn’t be bothered. The rest of his time was spent researching spells to put a Knight of Hell under for years on end. They for sure couldn’t go and ask Rowena now, not with Crowley hunting Castiel and the baby.
Neither brothers said anything at first. Dean could feel Sam looking between them both seeing his brother was slowly unraveling and Cas was so on edge she was humming with power. Which also made him realize that a baby of an angel and Knight of Hell could give the mother a power boost while still pregnant. Right now Cas was most likely the most dangerous thing they have ever faced. But regardless, she was still Cas. She was their family. And she needed help. Dean knew that, but he still couldn’t form proper words. Thankfully Sam had his back.
“Not even if Ah can get rid ay th’ mark an’ protect yer wee one?” she sounded smug, he could just imagine the Cheshire grin spreading across her face.
“That is not happening.” Dean snarled, stepping next to Cas. “I formally offered him and our pup a place in our pack and they accepted. He won’t be going anywhere.”
“Like hell.” Cas snarled. “I don’t know what lies my parents fed you, but the father of my pup is my mate and I am not going anywhere with you.”
With that in mind, he faced Chuck, squared his shoulder as best as he could in his bloodied state, and stared him down.
“Well, she wouldn’t stop shooting at me so I had to rip this out.” with that he tossed a lump of muscle and blood in front of them making El scream.
“Dean…” he started, not sure how to proceed. “I just had a thought. If the Novaks are anything like what I remember, then there is a chance that Cas isn’t there anymore. You know how they felt about omegas. There is a chance he was mated off.”
Intruding on that space was suicide, so instead, he leaned against the wall next to the closet door and slid down to the floor.
“I need to send out a message.” Dean told his brother and friend. “Warn everyone about Jack so we don’t have another blow up.”
Following her gaze he looked down the drive and saw a car coming toward them, and she was right it wasn’t one of theirs.
“Call the others, let them know what’s going on.” He told them. “I don’t want any of you to act yet. We don’t know if they’ll be back. We might have scared them off.”
“How dare you talk to Ramiel so disrespectfully.” Naomi growled going to get directly in Cas’s face.
“Hmm.” she nodded, looking down at the pup who stared at the alpha woman with intrigue. “Hello Jack, you are definaitly the cutest little pup I’ve seen since mine.”
Not long after Sam had started law school he came around the bar with his new girlfriend, Eileen. She was everything his little brother needed. She could put any and all alphas in their place, she herself was also an alpha but didn’t act like one- most thought she was a beta-, and dish out just as much as she could take. Dean thought she was perfect and loved her like a sister immediately. She was studying law just like him, and even though she was deaf she never let the world bother her. She was tough as nails and had great instincts to boot.
“You sure are feisty,” he smirked. “I love omegas like you, you would make the best bitch after a little training.”
“Because I love you.” Dean snapped. “And I don’t want to do this just because it’ll fix everything. Our love means so much more than that.”
Oh, that just made him feel so very ill. Almost as sick as when he regained his humanity and remembered what he did to her.
They both had changed slightly. Both were taller, and both had a bit of stubble. But otherwise, they were the same. Same style of dress, same kind eyes. Same whelming scents. It was like lightning striking the earth as their eyes finally met. A jolt went through both of them, making it difficult to form words or to even move.
He stood there just outside the front door, all ruthless rage and righteous fury with half the pack at his back, snarling and baring their teeth. Dean’s hands balled into fists at his side and were shaking while he breathed deeply to keep himself from going off the deep end and just straight-up murdering them.
“Dean,” Cas growled, suddenly up and backing Dean into the nearest bookcase. “I am not going to let you pull this righteous alpha crap right now.”
“What?” Dean asked turning with the others to see Sam holding out ever so carefully- the bundle which turned out to be a small girl wrapped in a blanket, fast asleep.
“Well, Castiel,” she said coming around the kitchen island cabinets to see the boys. “I’ve heard a lot about you. Dean has talked about little else. But your pup…”
“To make it up to you, why don’t we party up and I’ll help you get that item you're after.” He knew where she was in the game and what she wanted.
“I’ve already talked to Bobby about this. He’ll have it covered till I can come back. It’s not like we’re that big of a pack.”
“I have every fucking right!” Castiel roared. “You would have killed me back in Pontiac! You would have killed my pup. You never respected my decisions and saw me only as a cash-out once I was old enough to be mated off. I left your pack six years ago, and have been accepted into a new one. I am not leaving no matter what you say. And if you don’t leave now, my alpha has every right to take whatever action he deems necessary since you are trespassing.”
At first, it was just a ragtag group of disproportionally aged friends. But then it became so much more.
This time the pack didn’t stare at the Novaks through windows or from their cabins. This time they were in the sitting room. The whole pack glaring at the unwanted visitors who were now stomping their way into their home.
“As happy as I can be.” Adam smiled. “I’m studying biology and medicine, and theology so I can talk with Micheal about it. He seems to want to spread the word of the gods more than lead a pack.”
“I see.” she sighed, hands on her hips. “Well, your here now. And Dean has already made you part of the pack and of course we have room for Jack. But this is gonna probably piss off a lot of the pack.”
Dean looked from her to the barkeep, who sneered at him. He smiled back, a strained stretch of his lips, and looked back to Jo. He nodded.
It was then that Dean realized that Sam was leaning as far from him as possible and the window was cracked. It had been a long time since he lost control of his sent output like that. It was this worried tang mixed with anticipating musk.
No longer able to hold back his menacing scent, Dean glared at her, snapping his jaw shutting her up.
“Now ‘en, let us begin.” Rowena called, getting Dean and Cas to kneel before her. “Yoo ha’e made yur bond now it es time tae vow befur th’ gods.” she told them, taking the sash and tying it around their joined hands. “Swear only tae lo’e one another, tae cherish and support one another, an’ tae always bae by each other's side in the name aye the gods.”
“I already asked Bobby and Benny to go get a queen size bed, it should be here soon, we know a guy. So at least you’ll have a place to sleep, and we’ll get the rest tomorrow. I bet you want a shelf for all your books.”
He ran through a thousand different things to say to the omega. A thousand emotions running across his heart. A thousand different scents. But that warmth stayed. And eventually, he settled with just standing behind the man and letting his scent carry to him. He saw when Cas caught it. He stiffened, not able to move for a short moment. Then slowly, like an animatronic with a wire lose, he turned to face the alpha.
“Is this Dean Winchester?” the voice on the other end sounded shaken and younger than Dean thought Micheal was.
Slowly, he opened the door and peeked in. On the floor of the closet, Cas was curled up with a sleeping Jack while they were surrounded by scrapes of clothes and blankets. Some of the shirts, Dean noticed, were his. He wondered when Cas stole them, but he was so happy to see them in the nest he didn't bother asking.
“Pup, huh.” Bobby said, eyeing Dean then glancing to Cas. “And you’re okay with being in our pack, with bringing your pup into our pack.”
“That is what Cas was implying.” Jack nodded. “I think anyway.” now he looked unsure, glancing to Cas for confirmation. “Is that what you were implying.”
“They don’t have to be.” Sam insisted. “I’m not saying Jack’s are less important, that couldn’t be further from the truth. But you shouldn’t have to put your dreams away just because of that. And now you have a chance to work on them. We won’t mind watching Jack, it gives us all good practice for when the rest of us decide to have pups. Which I hope is soon so Jack can play with kids his own age. Plus he should be starting school himself soon. And Dean already figured that you’d either be in school or want to go to school. I’m sure he wouldn’t mind more time with his pup since he missed out on the first five years of his life.”
Sam was pushing now, and Dean knew he was doing it with the full understanding that his older brother might just lash out with a fist.
“You look flushed.” Dean hummed, leaning down, pressing his nose into Cas’s neck. “You feeling okay?”
“Hells Bells,” Rowena chimed, looking around frantically, a broad smile plastered on her face. “Sae thes es th’ Men ay Letter’s stronghold, eh?”
Dean was actively nosing his scent gland now, humming and growling lowly at the scent his omega was admitting.
"Gabriel told me you were in Kansas." Dean told him, still staring at the pup awed and smiling wistfully. "A policewoman in my pack found you after that."
“Where am I?” she echoed, clueless. “Dean, where are you? Sam has been looking for you. You vanished after the fight with Metatron. Are you alright?”
“Shut up.” Dean snapped again standing to his full height. “It was me. That whole thing was me. I’ve been in love with her for years now, and when I became a demon all the decent gentleman crap went out the window and I just took what I wanted.”
It didn’t take him long to find her. He didn’t even have to look really. She was just a phone call away.
“No.” Sam shook his head. “She already has four girls to look after. Even with Donna’s help that is a lot. We can’t dump a Nephilim-cambion on her too. That is too much.”
“Don’t worry, sweetheart, I’ll take care of you.” he assured, leaning her back against the wall and pulling a vile out of his coat pocket. “Take it.”
“How?” Dean demanded, loudly. “Other me said that she was his and the other Cas’s kid. So how the hell is she part demon?”
It all slammed into him, and he knew that is where her mind would go. He doesn’t have a good track record with these sorts of things. But still, something completely off-topic caught his attention.
“Ellen,” Dean smiled, looking to his pup and friend realizing this was either gonna be really good or really awkward. “Castiel, this is Ellen, our pack mom and ass kicker. Ellen, this is Castiel, and our pup Jack.”
“Hey, Dean, hang in there.” Sam told the other Dean bringing the little girl just a little closer so he could gaze upon her sleeping face.
“Castiel,” Naomi Novak snarled as she stomped out of the blue Auzmobile. “It’s time for you to come home, now.”
“I don't have time.” Dean yawned. “Between school and the bar, I can focus long enough on what the narrator is saying to follow the story.”
“Yes, it is.” Cas nodded, turning his attention back to his family, thinking it was a bit rude of this alpha to purposefully put off his scent like that. But a lot of alphas do that without thinking when meeting someone new, almost like an instinct to show the others they were top dog.
This was going to be tricky, Cas realized. Without Sam and Dean knowing what happened they couldn’t keep up this charade for much longer. That is when the idea struck him. They needed to know what happened. Then Dean will understand why Cas can’t send her away.
“This is pack land, and in between jurisdictions, meaning that law enforcement can do little to nothing when the alpha and packmates spill blood to protect their own or the land.” Jody continued where Donna left off.
Taking a few steadying breaths, Dean stepped out and took one step after the other toward the doors.
“If you're asking me whether I treat my omegas like breeding machines that can be sold off as soon as their first heat, no.” Dean growled, low and warning. “Omegas are more than that. They are needed in a pack. They keep everyone calm when things get tense. They reminded alphas that being a muscle headed asshole is not the way, and they protect our pups. They are the balance that both alphas and betas need. That thing that keeps us peaceful and from ripping each other's heads off. Beta’s are the level headed planners, alphas the pack protectors, and omega the peacekeepers. You need all three to keep a balance and if you miss treat any of them, you’re not only upsetting the balance, you’re the worst kind of ignorant asshole.”
“Okay, beef patty with a fried egg and icecream.” Dean called setting the plate down in front of the ever-growing Castiel. “Gross by the way.”
"Two of them, actually." Dean smirked. "And an accountant and a dentist. There are all kinds in my pack."
“Yeah.” Adam nodded, a serine smile spreading across his face. “It was awkward at first, but I took him out for dinner, we got to know each other better and now we....” the smile became joyous. “We’re good together.”
“In a way.” Cas shrugged. “I do believe I’ve come to care for her through his memories. Some of them were hers. She wanted him to know what it felt like to be pregnant when El moved or kicked, so she would show him through her mind. It… it was intense for him an odd, but also ‘magical’ in his words.”
He had adopted his alpha, pack leader persona as soon as they entered the dinner. Basically, he just looked gruffer and meaner than normal. His eyes narrow, his shoulder squared, his whole upper body leaning and his scent wafting out in bold extra alpha pheromones. It made Cas roll his eyes and Sam snort. They knew what he was going for. No business, what he says goes, this is my turf, but it just looked so alpha it was ridiculous.
“I am,” he told her, stepping just a bit closer, admiring her in just a blue bathrobe. “You know that.”
“Hey, guys.” Chuck smiled. “Now this, this is gonna be awkward, but I need you to kill your daughter.”
“That’s why you left with me that night. Why you don’t talk to dad anymore. So you could make yourself better for Castiel.”
“Okay, let’s give Crowley a call.” he shrugged, reaching for his phone at the same moment the bunker door opened.
The scent was as failure to the pup as ever, with this he knew for sure the alpha was telling the truth.
“If you walk in there like this they’ll throw you out,” Sam told him. “Just let me scope the place out. I’ll bring him back here if he’s in there.”
“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry Jack.” Dean hushed, petting his hair gently. “I wanted to make the perfect home for both you and your mommy. Find the best packmates so we’ll always be happy.”
But before he could do anything, El shot up to her full height, ripping the amulet off and giving a shrill, teeth vibrating scream.
“Mine,” she told him, finally locking eyes with him, clear skies meeting rolling green hills. “And yours.”
Jack studied him for a moment before it clicked and he spun on his heel facing Dean who was holding his breath.
“Now do you understand?” he begged. “We can’t abandon her. She is just a little girl. If we try to send her away Chuck will come and he will kill her. We have to protect her.”
“I raped her!” Dean snapped, realizing a second too late what he said and slumping defeated against the island.
“Exactly.” she snapped back. “That kind of behavior shamed our pack, so when Bartholemuel came to us we knew he would whip the boy into shape.”
Soon enough, a woman came to the door. Dean recognized her. She was the head of the Novak pack, Naomi, the female alpha, and the tyrant of the pack.
“You were gonna let some ego-driven bastard break him.” Dean snarled. “You bitch. That is your son. How could you even think of letting something like that happen? How could you encourage that?”
Jack looked torn, this was another version of Dean after all. Another version of one of his dads. And with his soul back he was hurting for the sight before him. Yet he understood. He had to keep his powers under wraps.
“I can’t tell you the whole story.” alternate Dean coughed. “We refused, and he started killing us. First Sam then Elean, Cas, and I ran and started the spell to get us here. But he got Cas before we could jump through. He destroyed most of my organs, then I used what was left of my strength to take El and jump.”
“I told him about how that’s where I used to live before mom died. He must have assumed that’s where I’d settle my pack once I made one.”
He blocked, pushing her back. She was pulling her punches and he knew it. She wasn’t willing to hurt him, but he was. If this went on too long and he didn’t get his way, he would force her into submission.
The inside was open and roomy. Walking in Cas was greeting with a large sitting room with a fireplace in the wall and a large with a wrap around sofa. And a kitchen and dinning room big enough for twenty. Lastly, there was a grand staircase that led up to the second floor.
“Cas,” he called through the door. “We’re not gonna let them do anything. Okay, you and Jack are part of this pack. I won’t let anything happen to you.”
“You really believe that.” Chuck roared. “That alpha doesn’t need you anymore. He got what he wanted out of you. He has an heir to his pack.”
“Yeah,” Cas nodded. “But I always knew it was coming and would arrange for him to be taken care of by my boss.”
“Really?” he questioned, grinding harder, making her whimper. “Because I think I can get you to change your mind.”
“Wait.” Jack suddenly realized something. “You said that Amara was never released in her world, meaning they never freed Lucifer and I was…”
“The books.” Sam gestured to the one in his hand. “The study of healing herbs. And all the other books you have here on medical properties and such. Were you going to school to be a doctor?”
She nodded back, watching as the demon and hunter clasped each other’s forearms staring each other down.
“I understand.” Cas nodded. “But you are also my alpha now. Just… just ask me before you do something you think is overstepping, okay.”
“I don’t know.” Sam shook his head. “The clerk wouldn’t tell me. Then again, a strange alpha comes in smelling intense and starts asking about a troubled omega. I wouldn’t tell me either.”
If this is something you'd like to check out then please look out for it wherever you find podcasts and YOUTUBE.
“Like I’d miss the day that you announced you're mated to Dean Winchester. I mean you never stopped talking about him in school.” Gabe snorted. “And this must be the mini Dean.”
“What did the bad man do to mommy, why does she look like a boy?” El asked, tilting her head in a way that reminded Sam of Cas.
“Ah heard ‘at yer angel is bae’in hunted by mah son’s goons. As it turns out mah son an’ Ah hae had a bit ay a fallin’ out sae once again Aam oan th’ run. Ah need a safe place.”
“This is where the garden was going to go, once you decided to start it.” he said, opening the gate to the little enclosed area. “I figured you wanted to plant herbs for your medical studies, and some flowers for the bees. We can also put a green house in the corner for all the plants that can’t be left to Kansas’s changing seasons. And over here,” he said, directing Cas to the little shed toward the back, leading the omega there and opening the door revealing a little lab of sorts. A desk, a table, and rolling chair. “Is where you can work on your remedies, so you can open that clinic you wanted.”
“What if we locked him in this thing I read about, the Malec box? It’s nearly impossible to get out so he couldn’t hurt anybody.”
Looking between his pup and the alpha Cas weighed his options. There wasn't much in this town for him and Jack. He was planning on homeschooling him and kept him at the store while he worked thanks to his boss being so cool. It was a merical that child services hasn't come pounding on his door. Leaving wasn't going to bring any bad. They didn't have friends besides his boss. Even she didn't really need him. She gave him the hours he needed but they were overstaffed and it pissed off the other workers. If he left it wouldn't hurt anything. Even his aunt left after he got his job. So his best chance was to leave, for him and for his pup.
They all looked to the closest cabin, where Donna and Jody were standing on its porch, arms crossed and both in full uniform.
“Do you think he would want to? Especially after he gave in and killed all those demons. Give him the mark back and the first blade and you got the most unstoppable monster we’ve ever dealt with. Do you want that?”
“Cas no,” Dean growled. “I don’t want to mate just because we have to avoid a fight. Are you even ready to take that step?”
“What happened, happened. We can’t change it.” she told him. “We have to move on and focus on what is happening now. Right now, I’m pregnant with our child. Right now heaven and hell are hunting me down to either kill my baby or take it from me. Right now I need to know if you will please help me.”
“Fur th’ transfer, Ah need a willin’ host. Fur th’ sleep spell Ah’ll need a lot ay herbs fur such as weel as some yarrow an’ red rose petals. Fur th’ protection spell, Ah’ll need a lot ay herbs meant fur protection, same fur crystals, an’ an angel feather, an’ demon DNA an’ th’ babin herself.”
For a whole month, he had her in every way imaginable and ways that can’t be. On her bed, against the wall, in the shower, on the floor, and even on the ceiling. He took her however he wanted and she could barely fight him. Because she had wanted this too. And without her true grace fighting the human instincts she accumulated was near impossible. He took complete advantage of this. Fully embracing his demon influence.
He trusted Ellen more than most now, she was like the mother he always wanted, so he would let her explain before getting mad.
“So you can’t even do that spell until she is born?” Cas hissed looking at the brothers. “She is not to be trusted, she just wants our baby like the others. She wants to take her and use her for her gain.”
“I wouldn’t come unless I had to.” she told them. “After what happened, Dean made it very clear he didn’t want me here. But the angels and Crowley are hunting me.”
Dean may be the alpha of the pack, and a stuborn ass of a man, but he could never challenge Ellen even on his best day or her worst. So rather than snap back and snarl at her, he backed up and bared his neck in surrender.
“Maybe she has a spell that will knock him out.” Sam shrugged. “Lock him in a dream world or something.”
Instead, she just took a deep breath and opened her coat. What greeted them was her usual outfit underneath only with a bit more pudge in the stomach area than she normally has.
“It’s our best chance Cas.” Dean reassured her. “She knows the magik to keep the angels and demons away from our daughter. And she can get this thing off me.”
“They’re interesting.” Dean shrugged. “Still have nothing on Sam’s obbession on the supernatural or sirial killers.”
This began a new life for Castiel Novak. He did go to Sam’s college and was now taking classes for pre-med. His life consisted of school work, garden work, working a few shifts with Dean at the Buch and Sundance and spending time with his pup and Dean out on nature walks and at parks. Every now and then, he and Dean would have little date nights- whenever they could con Ellen or Sam into watching Jack. Eilleen would often just come up and steal the pup from them though, she and Jo would fawn over him. Cuddle and gush, buying him toys and feeding him sweets. It helped Dean and Cas and it made Dean happy that his pack loved his pup. Chairlie for some reason would verbally kidnap Cas whenever she could. If she wasn’t nerding out with Dean, Sam and Cas, or Cuddling with Dorthy she was talking Cas’s ear off about whatever she wanted while fiddling with her tablet. He didn’t mind, he liked the company while he worked.
“I do.” Cas reminded. “I saw everything from the moment they met for the first time, to their last stand together, to protect their daughter. They were just like we are now with only slight differences.”
“Soon I’ll learn to control my powers. Then I won’t have to wear this stupid thing anymore.” she said confidently.
“Don’t you dare threaten us.” Chuck gritted. “We will not tell you again. Get your ass in the car right now. Your alpha is waiting for you.”
“I’ll be there in a minute, just got to pick up some medicine first.” with that he hung up eyeing the angel sitting in a cafe just across the street.
Then came Crowley and his small pack. Crowley was an acclaimed accountant for many large businesses and his mate Billie was a mortician- actually worked with Amy. Both were alphas as were everyone else in their pack and boy did they all exude the prowess of alphas. They stopped by the bar often and shared their stories with Dean. Crowley’s mother and stepdad, Rowena and Catch stopped by too. Though Rowena often claimed the bar was too low class for her. This landed her in a snarling match with Ellen more often than not. She owned her own little occult shop and acted as a high priestess for plenty of old fashioned packs. Dean was a bit old fashioned himself. He believed in the old gods. Mostly that they were dicks, but he still believed. Catch on the other hand was a contracted bodyguard and sometimes bounty hunter. He was a smarmy bastard, according to Dean, but he was okay enough to eventually become part of his pack.
“Dean.” she hushed. “I forgave you a long time ago. What hurt most is that you couldn’t even look at me. I know why, but it made me feel like somehow you were disgusted by me now. For being touched in such a way by a demon.”
Cas still didn’t look as sure, but the words did touch his heart and lifted his spirits as much as was possible in this gloomy time.
“He isn’t going anywhere.” Dean snapped, seeing red. “I believe he told you that repeatedly. His place is here. He has school to attend and a pup to look after. He will not be going anywhere with you.”
Growling, Dean spun on his heel and marched down the drive to his car hearing the door slam behind him.
Then came the beta Kevin. He was his brother’s friend really but would stop by the bar often enough to study. He liked the atmosphere, dorky little nerd he was. Still, he and Dean built up a good relationship through this. Now he was the record keeper of the pack and soon he would be a history teacher at a college.
“But first we have to pack.” Cas told the boy, standing to his full height and heading for his dresser. “Why don’t you ask your daddy for help.”
With that confirmation, they pulled out their respective weapons and marched for the source of the shaking. They made it to the infirmary where in fact there was another rip shone with its golden brilliants. They prepared themselves for the worst raising their weapons high. They were ready for anything, after the Hunter Corp. Sam and Dean popped into their world there wasn’t much they didn’t expect.
They headed up the last set of stairs up into the thrid floor where Cas could arleady tell Dean, and only Dean had really been. The scents downstairs were muddled and mixed, it was hard to distinquish between them since he was unfamilur. But here, here he could only smell Dean. Something in him calmed at this, had him deflating in a way that he didn’t even know he had to. He didn’t know he had been holding himself tightly together for six years. Being here, surrounded by the scent of the alpha who he had loved so wholely before all this. At that moment, he knew where he and his pup would be staying for now.
“You’re right, I just…” Dean sighed, scratching his neck. “I don’t want to over step. Not when we’re still so…”
“This is none of your business.” Chuck sighed pinching the bridge of his nose. “We appreciate that you have been looking after our son, but now we will be taking him back home. The alpha we tried to set him up with before was not a good fit, but we found another one that will forgive his past sins and is willing to pay a hefty amount for him. After he offended that last alpha this is the least he could do for us to make up for all the trouble he’s caused us.”
“Don’t look like that.” Adam shook his head. “I accepted the past a long time ago. I don’t like him particularly but I don’t hate him, he did come to visit now and then. Gave my mom some money and took me to a baseball game. But I don’t really know much about him.”
“Who cares.” Adam chuckled. “She and Chuck are old nuts. At first, they freaked. You know, they didn’t want to pay for me, I wasn’t from an old and prestigious family. But Micheal… he just wanted this all to be behind us. At first, he didn’t care what I did. But… Mom just wanted me to be safe. Naomi and Chuck worked out something they thought would work. I would be his mate, but not the mate. Micheal could still mate with an omega from another family for an heir.”
“He respects that I’m not ready.” Cas hissed back. “But let me assure you, I have every intention of becoming his mate when the time is right.”
“How dare you send an unknown alpha to a park where I was with my pup and mate.” Cas shot back. “Are you insane?”
“You always tell me that you want me to be happy and that you’ll support me, I want that for you too.” the pup expressed in the best way a five year old could.  “Be happy.”
Dean couldn’t even bring himself to look at Cas when he was human again. He felt sick with himself. How could he have done that to her?
It was weeks later and the packs were more than ready for the celebration of Dean and Cas’s vow ceremony.
Cas already knew and was working mixing the ingredients needed to open a rip into another world when Dean entered.
The house became super lively after that. Most all the people that came through the front door welcomed Cas with a hug and ‘finally’, then gushed over Jack like he was the cutest thing they’ve seen since they were born.
“During his last year of school, we found him the perfect mate.” She hissed. “Would have made an obedient omega out of him. He was to be given to him after he graduated, but he disgraced us. Angered the alpha and brought shame to our pack.”
“I am not a Novack!” Castiel roared, squaring up his shoulders. “I am a Winchester. I have been since Dean placed his seed in my womb. You have no claim to me.”
“They won’t.” Dean snarled, not at her and she knew it. “If they come back, we’ll take care of it. Jody, Donna, would your officers be willing to help?”
“Weeel, Ah can transfer it.” she told him. “An’ aye, Ah know ay a spell ‘at’ll keep th’ wee babe safe.”
“Think about it angel.” he insisted. “You and me, we’ve always had this ‘profound bond’ as you put it. Now, you think that I’m your charge or whatever and that's all there is to it. But you and I know that isn’t all. You were meant for me angel, and I for you.”
But would he have tracked him down after all this time just to claim a pup he never even knew about?
“Right.” Cas nodded, still rubbing the girl's back. “So after ten months, El was born. Before that their Dean was cured after they put the mark back on Cain locked them in a Malec box so they didn’t free Amara or Lucifer. But still, El was born from an angel and a knight of hell. That’s why Chuck is afraid of her, she is extremely powerful.”
“Sorry, Dean.” Chuck sighed, stooping down so he was level with El. “But this is how the story has to go.”
“I’ll tell you later, kiddo,” Dean promised, looking up to Cas and giving a small sad smile as the omega looked about ready to burst into tears. “We should talk.”
“No way.” Dean finally let the growl loose. “We’ll see if we can’t get him transferred. If not, I’ll stay here and work wherever till he’s ready to come home.”
“Why don’t you just get audible?” Charlie asked, they had just beat a boss in another RPG together and were taking a breather.
“Hey there, I’m Dean, what’s your name?” Dean asked kindly, letting the pup get a good whiff of him.
“Jack, do you remember how I told you your daddy would come back one day?” he asked the pup who nodded. “Do you know why he left in the first place?” he shook his head. Cas looked up to Dean, who nodded then continued. “He left so that he could find a better life for us. A home, a pack so we would be safe and loved.”
“You can’t stop me.” Dean shook his head. “No one could. But either way, now I can’t let you out of my sight. Not with Heaven and Hell on your ass again. I won’t let them touch you.”
“You shut the hell up.” Cas growled. “I don’t know who the hell you think you are, or what you thought you were going to accomplish coming here but let me make myself clear. I am mated to the pack alpha of the Winchester pack, Dean Winchester, I have no connection to the Novak pack other than they are blood. My parents have no say in my life and you are just some pathetic alpha who needs to get a head scan. Now, you are going to go back to my parents and tell them that Dean and I want to see them. This needs to end, so tell them to come to the pack lands around five and we’ll be waiting. Do you understand?”
Looking up Cas says a man, alpha- judging by the smell he was putting off- greying hair and beard and casual clothes, sweater, and slacks. But what was odd about him were his eyes, they were an eery, almost glowing yellow.
Dean was bleeding through so many puncture wounds. Cement and rubble were embedded into his skin and organs. But still, he used what little strength he had to drag himself to the dungeon to warn his angel.
Walking in Cas’s eyes got bigger again. The room must have taken up the whole back side to the top two stories in the lodge. The shelves were floor to cieling needing a ladder to reach the top. plush chairs and couches littered the floor, some crowded a fireplace. There were also tables  by the grand window outlooking the mountain side. Just glancing at the spines of the books he noticed they were a mix of fiction and nonfiction, though lore and mythology seemed to take up most of the shelf space.
So they ate, got to know each other better. Turns out, Dean and Adam were very similar. Both loved bacon cheeseburgers and anime. Though Cas and Adam hit it off really well. They talk the rest of the lunch about medicine and classes they were taking and how the teachers taught them differently. Adam even scouted in his seat so he was sitting across from Cas. Dean and Sam were kind of forgotten about after a while, which was fine with them. They were happy that the two omegas were getting along.
“I don’t bend.” Dean snapped. “I cherish my omega and the place they have in our pack. They are the caretakers and the calming balms to the aggressive alphas. They keep us balanced. If you can’t understand that, then it’s no wonder Cas ran away.”
Cas didn’t answer, she just turned on her heels and marched out the room, then out the bunker all together Sam close behind calling out to her.
“We have quite a few bookworms in this pack.” Sam smirked. “So a library seemed like a good idea. Plus a few of us are still students, so it’s a good place to study.”
“Micheal, this is Dean Winchester, you probably don’t remember me but I went to school with Cas and Anna. Listen… things are a bit complicated. You probably know about me and Cas or at least that Cas was pregnant six years ago. The pup is mine. I found Cas and the pup and brought them to my pack. They are here and safe. But your parents… they just showed up today demanded that I hand over Cas so they can mate him off. Cas and I aren’t mated yet, but we plan to be. Cas is officially a part of my pack and I’m not going to let them take him. I don’t know if you know anything about this. But if you do, Just know I’m willing to fight for Cas. If not, please call me so we can talk. My number is (xxx)-xxx-xxxx. Please call me back as soon as possible.”
“We just needed some sleep.” He told him. “Looks like your breakfast is getting cold, you better eat.”
This was something Cas wasn’t used to. Dinners and meals were a somber afair at his pack family home. You didn’t speak unless you were given premision by the alpha and it was always more of a report session than an actual time with family. Here, here it was chaos in the most fun way. Everyone was talking over each other yet somehow still getting the story across. Everyones laughing and smiling. It was nice. His pup loved it anyway. Everyone loved him. They cooed and awed over him, and Gertie. Pups in general, everyone saw them as a blessing. So having two was great for the pack.
