Dean had just about had enough and was reaching for his own gun. There was no doubt in his mind he could shoot he gun out of this kid’s hand without harming him. A voice brought him up short.
“Oh he knows. He just doesn’t care what I do all that much anymore. Besides Dean’s gone. Like way gone.” Castiel stumbled into a table littered with half filled whiskey bottles and poured three fingers into a mirky glass.
“Of course there are.” The hunter groaned.
"What?" Kate's nose crinkled in confusion.
“Things are turning out differently than expected.” Pariah’s voice was the only sound in the room besides Mia’s soft crying, “But one thing is certain. Everything we know, everything there is, and everything there ever was is doomed.”
“I’m ready to go.” Barry was bouncing back and forth on his feet, ready to jump into action.
"Now I finally have it, and tonight" Setting the gun down Dean pierced the three with his unwavering gaze. The three couldn't help but shiver at the deadly gleam in the hunter's eyes, "tonight I'm gonna kill the Devil."
Dean took a moment to consider, “I know.” He said shocking the three. “While you were out I did all the tests,” Counting off on his fingers, “Holy water, salt, silver knife, nothing. You even had this stashed up your sleeve like my Cas used to.” Reaching into his jacket he pulled out Cas’s angel blade. It looked sharp and dangerous in the dark lighting, “Good thing that hybrid sigil worked and didn’t blow you to smithereens or halfway across the country, cause I’ve been meaning to bag an angel for a while. So why are you here?” He pointed the sharp end of the blade at Cas and then waved it over at Barry and J’onn. “I’ve never seen either of these two before.” Then back at Cas, “And you look like you’ve put on a little more milage. So I guess I should ask; When are you from?”
Lena and Alex had joined the fray. Not many ships were left and there were still too many people to get one them. To top it all off time was running out. Sam made sure Lena, Alex and Dreamer had all made it onto ships before he made his way to the last ship that had landed in the central park.
"Yeah." Kate turned to leave the lab, not wanting to bask in her failure any more than necessary, "Well, Bruce's body isn't on the ship…"
“Oliver!” Barry was at his side instantly, and despite lacking superspeed Mia was only seconds behind the speedster. Kara slowly came to stand on the other side of the cot and at its foot the hunters watched.
Reaching out the Monitor opening his palm and a portal swallowed Dean.
“Sam! Dean!” A woman’s voice suddenly shouted from across the large complex.
The second Kara saw her cousin and Lois she almost let her guard down, desperate to crush them in a hug if only to reassure herself that they were really there. But the three strangers between Batwoman and Oliver drew weapons. The tallest and the one in a trench coat each held a strangely shaped silver daggers and the third an old revolver aimed right at Alex's head.
“Dean what?” Kara asked again, exasperated when the eldest Winchester didn’t answer and only continued to point at the fridge.
Kara crossed her arms, “Hey Sam, Dean, Castiel.” They shuffled forwards. Kara had seen how uncomfortable they’d been since arriving on Earth 1. At least for Sam she could tell he was a lot like her, needing a mission to focus on when the going got tough, and right now she didn’t think things could get much tougher. And out of all the heroes on the team they seemed the most comfortable around her up till now.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Dreamer set her hands on her hips while surveying the work they had to do, “What we need to do is keep people calm. Brainy said that these earthquakes are going to get bigger and bigger the closer the wave gets to Earth.”
“He sacrificed himself for me and Barry,” Kara said bitterly, guilt settling painfully in her stomach, “Shouldn't have done that.”
"Enough!" Oliver stepped up to the two hostile parties, his deep voice practically jolting the tension to a standstill, "No one is going be hurting anyone!"
"Dean doesn't want us interfering with his plan," J'onn was the first to his feet, his psychic abilities lending him a small measure of protection.
“Yeah. But only for a little while.” The wink the man gave oozed arrogance. It made Sam want to punch his smug little face.
Kara’s heart went out to Sam and Kate. How much could these people be expected to withstand and not break, “Only if you believe the Monitor.”
"I need a minute." Cas said quietly. He turned on his heel and swept out of Ray's lab, the weight of the universe on his shoulders.
Barry ran a palm over his tired eyes and settles his hands on his hips. He was so tired. "Yeah, I don't want to put all out bets on the Monitor's plan if you ask me."
Castiel sat back, surprised, but didn't question his leader, "Okay. Well, uh. I'll get the grunts moving." With that he stood along with Risa and headed out the door with the rest of the survivors.
Barry suddenly stood up straight, he exchanged glances with J'onn and Cas. The implication of such a weapon didn't escape the three. What if they could use it on the Anti-Monitor?
“The Paragon of Courage is known only as the Bat of the future.”
With that Superman bolted up into the sky, a small sonic boom echoed across the park in his wake.
The Monitor only raised his eyebrow, “I do not disagree.”
Dean still wasn't convinced, "How do you know?" His hand straying to his hip where his gun usually would be.
“No,” J’onn pressed “it hasn’t been for nothing. We need you. We believe you are a Paragon.”
Constantine took in the unconscious man, “You start all the fun without us?”
Barry handed over the device as well as an ear bud to J'onn and Cas, "Use these to stay in contact."
Cas stood over Dean while the human tried to catch his breath and calm his racing heart. "Dean, you don't even know if the colt will do anything against Lucifer."
Cas eyes snapped from his doubleganger to Dean, "You're torturing again?"
Wistfully she watched Mary fold her boys into her arms again. Not for the first time wishing she could have her own mother’s arms around her.
“I can’t just abandon Oliver.” Barry side-stepped the angel and moved right up into Sara’s space in a challenge, “That’s what you’re asking me to do!”
Now Dean was starting to get it. Need. That’s the word that Cas hated, “Cas man,” Dean rubbed the back of his neck, not quite able to say the word he meant when he said ‘need’ but wanting to say something, “When I say I need you, I mean you. Sure the angel mojo is great and helpful as hell in a pinch. But I’d rather have you, powered up or not.”
“No it really doesn’t,” Sara smiled half-heartedly. Not many people understood what she’d been through.
After checking over his wife Clark turned towards the angel and nodded, "Thank you."
“Only friend actually.” Kate blushed.
“Okay.” Sara nodded, acknowledging Cas as the other Team’s leader, “Sam and Constantine are with me as our resident resurrection experts.” Sara pinched her chin as she though this out, “Mia, you’re obviously coming. Head down to the infirmary and I’ll meet you there to prep Oli’s body,” She tilted her head at the door and Mia left with one last glare at Constantine. Sara then addressed the speedster, “Barry.”
“I agree.” Dreamer nodded as they guided a group of disoriented café goers into a group waiting to be picked up, “Do you know if Alex was able to get Lena Luthor on board.”
Sam ceased his pacing a came to a stop beside Constantine, “With all the Earth’s dying could the magic have drained from the pit too?” He asked.
“Please.” Mia begged sounding very much like a young child desperate for a parent’s comfort.
"No they're comic book heroes."
“Huh?” Sara furrowed her brows.
Kate shoved away his hands to get a better look at his wound.
Oblivious to all this Castiel squared his shoulders and addressed the woman as one warrior did to another, "I am an angel of the lord."
“Of course. My brothers may have forgotten our mission but I haven’t.” Cas bowed his head.
Dean knew this place was geek heaven and under normal circumstances his little brother would’ve be all over the particle accelerator, but Sam hadn’t so much as even glanced towards a computer screen since they got here. Which had Dean all kinds of worried.
“I never said I liked the bloke,” Constantine interjected while fiddling with his cigarette box. One murderous look from his Captain as well as an Angel who looked ready to smite him had Constantine wishing he’d stayed back in hell last year.
“How about I thank you when you bring my dad back?” Mia threw back, her fists clenched and her stance in that perpetually ready to throw down state it’d been in ever since Star Lab’s infirmary. Ever since her father died.
“Yeah it is.” Dean confirmed, bouncing on the balls of his feet, “And not just some cosplayer, she’s the real deal.”
"A trap. Exactly." Dean confirmed. "They," He jerked head over at his group of men, "are the decoys. We're going in through the back."
"No Dean not yet." Kate pushed away his hand when he reached for the batarang.
When the light died away Cas stood up straight. Holding his hands in front of his face he could see his grace swirling just under his vessel’s skin, as strong as the day he first descended into Hell to rescue the righteous man. A familiar weight settled on his back, one he hadn’t felt in years. Flexing his now healed and whole wings he stared at the Monitor in disbelief.
Barry stepped away from J'onn, his nearly healed limbs at last able to hold him upright. He pulled his extrapolator out of his pocket and hooked it into his phone, "The antimatter wave just entered this Universe. We have minutes, if that."
“Did it work?” Cas grunted in pain.
Kara swallowed a sick feeling building in her gut. There was a distinct line between the two teams. The heroes and the hunters. Those who knew each other and those who were unknowns.
“And good luck with finding Batman.” Sam couldn’t believe he just said that unironically, “What even is my life now?”
"Ah." Lucifer raised his head to the sky. "It is time then."
“I can see you beating yourself up.” Sam pressed, “You did everything you could.”
Barry groaned and heaved himself into a sitting position, staring numbing down at his misshapen limbs. He winced in pain as his healing factor was already kicking in, the sound of one of his bones snapping back into place echoed across the small space.
Up ahead where all the cars seemed to converge was a multiple car pile up. As they got closer the three saw a skeleton still gripping its wheel, the tattered remains of its hair billowing gently in the wind.
“Touche,” Sam had to give her that one.
“Well my other name for you isn’t so polite.” Dean dodged a flying hostile and when he came up he and Oliver were back to back.
“Barry? You, my friend, are the very best of us.” Oliver reached for Kara, “I gave it all up for you and Kara.”
“Got it.” Sam nodded back.
“Nooooo! Nonono.” Dean trailed off and suddenly found something very interesting about the way the floor went together.
The vehicles were being loaded up and filled to the brim with people and weapons. The three visitors stayed to the side during the preparations as whenever they tried lending a hand they were given glares and huffs of distrust. Wisely, they decided to stay out of the way until the order was given to roll out and then pile into whichever car's occupants looked the least likely to shoot or stab them.
“To the best of my abilities.” Constantine added as an after thought and all but ran out in retreat of his Captains fury.
“That’s not your decision to make!” Dean shouted at the biter old man, suddenly seeing a younger version of himself from another future in Bruce’s place.
“Goodbye Sam.” Cas said and embraced the younger Winchester.
“I saw you back there with Earth-14 Dean and now this version of you… and its clear that something is going on.”
“There have been a few fights over supplies, but I’ve been able to convey with my psychic projections the event that led to the exodus from our Earth to this one. It has seemed to keep the calm so far.”
Kara, who’d saved hundreds. Kara, who Sam saw give hope to refugees when she herself felt lost. Kara, who mere hours after her mother’s death she was trying to comfort his family, stalked forward. Her eyes blazed with a blast that at this close a range could and probably would prove fatal to the man before them.
“Yeah sure,” Dean again wiped at his mouth which felt gross and fuzzy.
Kara brushed her face dry and pulled free of Clark, now wasn't the time to lose herself.
Cas knelt, completely still in the way only an angel could be, and appraised the survivors readying for battle. Something about this just didn't sit right with him. His Dean was one of two ways when it came to his plans, either he meticulously charted out every single moment down to the last detail, or he went in guns blazing. This Dean was doing neither of these things.
“No Sara! He’s my best friend, you can’t expect me to sit this one out!” Barry shouted, letting his anger get the best of him as he towered over her and threw out his arm in the direction of the infirmary where Oliver’s body rested.
The high-pitched wail of the creatures was getting closer and closer.
“Woah weird!” A gravely voice exclaimed right next to their hiding spot, so close and so loud the three whirled around and knocked into each other in the process. Without being noticed this Earth’s Castiel had come right up on them quite silently, which for a dude of his size was not a small feat.
Constantine lit his cigarette and took a long draw before finally acknowledging Sara, “I'll do it.” His words came out curt and he pulled himself free, but only because the assassin allowed it.
“So why didn’t they say yes and allow the battle to happen?” J’onn wondered aloud, speaking up as the speedster had at present lost the ability to form words properly.
Kate came to lean against the table beside Kara and bumped her shoulder in solidarity, “Well I haven’t even met the guy and I want to punch him.”
“Call us when you need us to shoot something.” Dean grumbled, “Cas.” He jerked his head towards the balcony and Cas followed.
The heroes and hunters ran to the edge of the walkway to observe this new development.
"I said the path to Earth 99 and Earth 14 would lead you to the Paragons, and that has come to pass." The Monitor stepped up to Kate, "You are the Bat of the future, Kate Kane. You stood up to your last remaining relative and mentor to do that which you knew to be right. You are the Paragon of Courage."
"You know why God cast me down? Because I loved him. More than anything. And then God created..." Lucifer slid his dark eyes over to where Barry leaned against J'onn helplessly. The speedster gulped, "Them." Lucifer said with disgust, "The little...hairless apes. And then he asked all of us to bow down before them—to love them, more than him. And I said, 'Father, I can't.' I said, 'These human beings are flawed, murderous.' And for that, God had Michael cast me into hell." His voice rose in volume until another series of lighting strikes lit up the sky. Breathing deeply in through his nose to calm himself the Devil continued, "Now, tell me, does the punishment fit the crime? Especially, when I was right? Look at what six billion of them have done to this stunning thing, and how many blame me for it."
“To protect humanity.” Cas replied.
J'onn took the rear, sending out his mind to probe for approaching danger. He pushed a little farther out when he hit it. His sudden hiss made Cas and Barry jump. They whirled around to see the Martian clutching his head in pain, "In the courtyard. Dean," He bit out, "and something very old, and dark."
Now alone Sam turned to Cas, “Well I guess I’ll see you when you get back.”
As if his thought summoned him, making Dean wonder if he’d accidently sent out a prayer, Cas was standing right behind Dean. The angels own wide eyes matched his, as if just as surprised at his appearance as the hunter.
“She did. It's just that we've never faced one like this before.” Oliver took up position beside his daughter.
“Go go,” Louis whispered.
“The Anti-Monitor. He commands forces greater than any army. When the tower stops the wave, they will come to thwart any effort to save this planet and its people.”
The man in the trench coat tilted his head to the side, confused but still wary of the strangers around him, "You speak with rabbits? I did not know they had the capability of speech." He squinted his eyes at Harbinger.
“They're trying to breach the tower.” Mia shouted from where she and Oliver were crouched.
"You're right. he wouldn't. It's one of the main reasons we're in this mess, actually." Dean said, flicking the safety off the colt and preparing to head inside. The discussion was over.
“Gonna yank out that A.I.’s voice box.” Mick said spilling some lettuce to the floor and furiously clipping his heat gun to his belt.
"Oh for the love of…" Dean rolled his eyes, wrapped his fingers around the batarang before Kate or Kara could stop him, and yanked it out of his flesh with a ripping pop. He hunched over with a grunt before righting himself with a self-satisfied smirk on his face, "I'm keeping this." Dean said breathlessly and held up the batarang.
“Kara, Clark, Barry, Help contain the damage.” Oliver ordered and they took off, then to his new allies, “Castiel.”
Barry and J'onn, who had covered their ears, now slowly lowered their hands, staring at Cas in shock.
Cas nodded but stopped at the frown on the martian's face, "J'onn?"
"Croats." Dean repeated. At Barry and J'onn's uncomprehending expressions Dean continued, "Croatoans. One of them infected Yeager." Dean said, irritated that he had to explain any of this and have his decisions questioned.
"Its happening just like on Earth-38" Barry shouted into his comms while zooming all across the town, scooping up any humans he found hiding and ushering them through the portal, "The planet is going to become more unstable the closer the wave gets."
“Yes.” Bruce smiled with relief, “Go on. Let it end. Let it all end. This world's not worth saving in any universe!” He tensed to take another shot at where Kara laid helpless on the ground.
Dean surged forward only to be held back by Sam and Cas, “No Dean don’t.” Sam’s pleas were halfhearted as he clung to his wrist.
J’onn face twitched in amusement, “Yes, and we are not little, in fact most martians are twice the size of a normal human.”
"Dean." When the hunter still refused to acknowledge him, Cas raised his voice, "Dean why are you bringing us."
“It still counts.” Mick growled under his breath.
If only Castiel knew how right he was. This was the end. Cas tightened his grip on the wheel, only letting up when he felt the metal begin to warp and bend under his fingers. The four spent the rest of the drive in uneasy silence.
Oliver just shook his head.
“If the shoe fits.” Kate raised the extrapolator, thumb poised to activate it “Wait,” she paused. They were still down a man, “Where the hell is Dean?”
“I have to talk to Dean about this.” Cas turned on his heel but halted when his doubleganger laughed a full belly laugh that brought him up short. Slowly he turned around to face himself.
And there went Dean's confidence in this plan working. He and Cas took a huge step back and joined Barry, Kate and Kara near the back of the room.
“He didn’t give me a choice in the matter.” Cas mumbled so low Dean barely heard it. Then louder, “Its exactly what the angels did. It they needed something they just went into my head and changed me. Now my choice has been taken away again. This power, it set me apart from humanity,” Up till this point Cas had resolutely refused to move his gaze from the floor but now he raised his blue eyes to Dean’s, “It set me apart from you.
Barry and J'onn followed the hunter and angel inside the cabin but wisely stayed to the far side, glancing up in concern as the lights began to flicker in tandem with the Cas's raised voice.
“Why?” Was Cas’s blunt response.
Taking a step in front of her sister Kara finally let her laser vision loose, super heating the gun in the blonde's hand. The weapon glowed bright orange and melted into a useless mass. The man dropped it with a pained cry.
The woman in blue calmly turned to the men, "I am Harbinger and you are on Earth 38…" A black gloved fist collided with her face, stunning everyone else into motionlessness.
"And we have no idea when the anti-matter wave will reach this universe," J'onn reminded them, "We must be quick."
“Hello J’onn,” Kara squared her shoulders, putting on a strong front, “How are our people settling in?”
"You never gave them a chance. You took one look at Cain and believed all humans were evil."
"We're hunters sweetheart." Dean smirked.
Enter the Batman
More and more time slid by and nothing happened. Even Sara was having a hard time remaining still at this point. Something had to be wrong.
“Ah hell.” Dean holstered his gun and pulled out Sam’s demon killing knife.
"Lex Luthor." Kara said, her tone promising violence if the man didn't stop talking.
Mia grabbed Cas’s arm tight when he approached, “Please help him.” Her lower lip trembled.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Castiel drunkenly swung around in his chair, hitching his elbow against the back of the chair and propping his face up on his hand, "Our fearless leader, I'm afraid, is all too well schooled in the art of getting to the truth."
“Dad?” Mia called out, even in this state her father should know her of all people. Right? Her voice was full of hope which only grew when Oliver started towards her. The hope on her face quickly changed to confusion and then fear when he didn’t slow down his advance, his gait particularly predatory. In this situation Mia was quite literally a deer caught in the head lights.
Harbinger's face snapped to the side and then back. Unfazed she raised an eyebrow at Batwoman.
Kate instinctively raced forward to save her cousin.
Dean’s face lit up like a Christmas tree, “The Batcave?” he exclaimed in a whisper, then hissed when Kara kicked him in the shin to shut him up. Luke was still in the room for crying out loud.
“Why didn’t you do that before?” Kate grumbled.
Without a second to spare Kara came to and twisted them mid fall right before plowing into the concrete street. The ground lurched with the impact and debris flew high into the air.
The closer the wave got the more violent the shaking got.
Batman yanked a batarang from his belt and swiped across Kate’s neck, just barely grazing the skin. Kate clasped her hard around her injured throat. Dean surged to his feet and threw himself at Bruce, his weight shoving the older man away from Kate.
Down in the city the earthquakes had split apart the streets. People dove and raced for cover while huge chucks of concrete and glass rained from the sky.
Kara smiled at being allowed to use the angel’s nickname, “Ok, Cas then.” Kara said adjusting her glasses, “I was going to check up on Dreamer and J’onn to see how the refugee camps were setting in. We still need to do a head count of how many actually managed to make it through. Do you want to come?”
Sam grinned at Kara and his Mother. If was the first time Kara saw his face completely relaxed and she thought to herself that it looked good on him. In fact it was like a switch had been flipped in both the Winchesters and the angel. Sure their eyes still told stores of loss and pain but now Kara could see hope and light there too.
Sam was standing close enough that he’d heard her. “Kara,” Sam intoned, worried at the direction her self-sacrificing comments were taking.
“With the worlds ending and the pillars of magic crumbling I need a, boost of sorts.” Constantine smirked eyeing Cas like a fine piece of steak, “And there’s no better charge than straight from a good old angel battery.”
“I’ve seen enough Saturday morning cartoons to know that one of these has to be…” He came to a book that wouldn’t budge like the others and tilted it backwards. A click resounded across the room and a length of bookshelves pulled back to reveal an dank elevator shaft. “Yes!”
Ray lay stunned on the ground, with Cas pulling him the rest of the way behind their metal hideout.
“The pit can heal any injury, but when a person who is already dead is placed in its waters it only brings the body to life. Who that person was, their soul. That stays gone. I don’t remember much from right after I came back, before Oliver rescued my soul. All I felt was empty.”
“What’s all this?” Dean asked Luke in the same interrogating tone he used while impersonating the FBI.
“Oh I’m going to love it here.” Dean grinned as they followed Mick out.
At hearing his full name Cas felt his back tense up, like he was waiting for a blow that would never come, “Cas.” He replied back.
“J’onn is waiting in the cargo hold. I’ll meet you there.” Cas said to Barry who super sped out, kicking up sheeves of paper in his wake.
The Monitor staggered out of a blue rimmed portal “The battle is lost!” His voice had a double reverb that became more pronounced as he winced in pain, “We must retreat and save our resources for battles yet to come.” He reached out, opening portals that that sucked away Kate and Ray.
An uneasy feeling bloomed in Kara’s stomach and she had to push it down, “When you said you’ve lost count how many times you’ve come back that wasn’t a joke? Was it?”
Now that she was finally able to Kara all but tackled her cousin in a hug and then Lois, of course with much more control over her strength than she'd used with her cousin and pulled them aside, "Thank Rao you're ok!"
Cas felt like his head was dunked under ice water, the Martian's words giving him a clue as to what they were about to find. It didn't matter tho. They had to get to Dean. They had to save the Paragon. The entirety of creation depended on his survival.
Cas at last let go and Dean slumped to his feet, grasping his chest where bruises were already beginning to form.
Dean shifted, clearly uncomfortable being called such and renewed his efforts to get his brother's attention.
“Exactly.” Cas agreed.
Barry sat down beside Cas but didn’t say anything only allowing his open expression to prompt the angel to continue.
Kara felt Alex's gentle grasp around her, not quite a hug but Kara knew it would only take a small glance from herself and her sister would wrap Kara in her strong arms and she would break. And if she broke, Kara didn't know how she would have the strength in herself to keep going. Looking around at all the agents scrambling for solutions, terrified out of their minds, Kara didn't have that luxury. These people were counting on her. Alex needed her. Her found family was still here on this Earth and, if it was the last thing she did, she would stop that wave from erasing it all. Alex tugged a little harder on her arm. Nodding her head Kara let Alex pull her forward, there was still work to do.
"Lucifer is here." Dean unrolled a stained map and jabbed a finger at a section a few dozen miles away from the encampment, "Now. I know the block and I know the building."
Harbinger took a step back and held out her arms in what everyone had quickly come to realize was a precursor to her teleporting away, “We don't need your crew, just Ray's lab, and we have an entire multiverse of Waveriders at our disposal.” And she flashed away.
Dean, Sam and Cas felt like they were intruding on a private moment. They hardly knew Oliver and yet they had fought beside the hero, bled beside him, and followed him. Now he was dead like so many other’s they’d known.
"Did he? You're sacrificing him and all those people and they doesn't even know."
“He’s your lighting rod.” Barry said with a faraway look in his eyes but like he understood everything the seraph had said on a personal level.
“His sacrifice saved a billion more people.” Sara pointed out, “Let's not call that a mistake.”
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Barely sparing the hunter a glance the Monitor continued, “You have suffered a horrible loss, but you have every reason not to lose hope, 8, in fact. Across space and time…”
The only people left in the cabin were Barry, J'onn, Cas and Dean. Dean busied himself with his preparations while the three visitors crowded into a corner.
"Chuck sent me for you." Harbinger spoke.
“The Monitor restored my grace.” Cas said answering his unspoken question. Dean didn’t miss how absolutely miserable the angel seemed about that.
Cas grunted and stood up straight, hefting the piece of debris to the floor with an ease the bellied the angel's strength.
"How are we supposed to know that, huh? I don't know you." The man all but got in her face, towering over her.
“Never thought we'd be pouring one out for Oliver,” Sara filled several glasses with whisky.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
While Dean mused over this thoughts he wandered the corridors of the Waverider. Even with the discovery that their mother was alive, Dean still had precious little family left. He wanted to keep an eye on as many as he could. Earlier he’d passed by Sam and Kara on the bridge. He had intended to join the nerds in whatever it was that held their attention on the huge screen thing. Then he’d seen Sam and Kara holding hands and welp a big brother needed to help out his kid brother when ever possible. Hopefully Sam would get his head out of his ass before too long. A little, pushed down voice told him not be the one to call the kettle black but as usual his ignored it.
Cas was the next to give out. He slumped forward, now dead weight in Kara’s arms. Cas hadn’t felt this human in years.
"How could you do that? Cas was grabbing handfuls of Dean's flannel.
“Parallel Earths spread out by vibrational frequency.” Constantine said sounding more than a little proud of his magical display.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Cas’s face crinkled fondly as he took in Dean, “That’s my point.”
Earth 1
Dean hesitated for a second, then shoved off the door, “Yeah.” Frustration coloring his voice a bit shrill.
“What was the cost?”
At last, one galaxy rose to the top of the others and near the outer rim a light glowed brighter than the rest, “I give you the needle in the celestial haystack, an Earth with a functioning Lazarus pit. Earth-18.” Constantine announced proudly.
“You guys have a bunker?” Kara said as she and Sam came to a stop at the entrance to the mess hall while Dean rushed inside.
If the flight unnerved J'onn he did well not showing it. As soon as they landed J'onn's eyes began to glow, "I can expand my psychic range and get everyone to come outside."
"That's not what I meant," Oliver began only to be cut off by Harbinger.
"Brainy can you." Kara turned to her genius friend.
“You are falling.” The Monitor observed.
“If this guy really is the Paragon we think he is we all need our heads in the game.” Barry gulped as he tried to say this as delicately as he could, “Are you and Dean….”
“What’s stops you.”
“Damn.” Dean sized up the rusty cables tugging hard on one, watching it sway precariously, “I’m getting too old to be climbing things like this.”
Cas eyed his companions warily.
“Well,” Kara fixed each member of the team with her gaze, this might very well be the last time they were all together, “then we better make every minute count.”
“Shame ours didn’t,” Dean wished aloud.
Sara nodded her gratitude.
"There's nothing more we can do," J'onn tugged on his arm. The light wave washed over the hills in the distance, blowing apart buildings, trees and everything else in its path.
“Because duh” Cas’s eyes bugged out his head and if his constricted pupils were any indication the man was on something besides alcohol, “I’m not needed. I know he only kept me around for my angel mojo. He used me and I let him.” Up to this point Castiel’s face had been overly animated but now it was like a switched had flipped inside the fallen angel and he was suddenly serious. “We always let people use us don’t we?” His words thrown like a javelin at his counterpart, “Now that’s all gone and he can’t even look at me. Maybe I don’t wanna look at him either. Now,” Cas straightened his stained shirt, “If you’ll excuse me, if have some ladies waiting for me.”
The portal closed with a zip that plunged the cavern into an uneasy silence save for the crackle of the fire.
Dean smirked and walked back over to Cas, wiping a hand over his mouth and kneeling down in front of the angel, “Oh yeah, had those special made. Melted down angel blades,” he pointed at the cuffs, “keeps you winged dicks from making a mess.” Deep seated anger was plain on his face and his lips turned down in a grimace.
"Is this God?" Sam gripped the side door handle till it hurt.
Dean, Cas and Kate all fell behind a large hunk of rusted metal.
Welcome to the end.
It never came. Cas met Dean’s relieved grin with his own, slightly taken aback by the warm expression on the hunter but enjoying it none the less. Johnathan gurgled happily and gazed up at Cas in awe. Idly Cas wondered if the little child was one of those special people able to see more of his true self than just the human vessel he was inhabiting. Tiny fingers curled around his tie and the baby’s eyes slid closed.
“Those belonged to Superman, his alter ego at least.” Luke had the audacity to look proud.
"What is it?" J'onn asked over the head of several children he just finished checking.
"I'm alright." Lois said shakily.
“Bruce killed this Earth's Superman?” Kara gasped.
Cas suddenly stopped dead in his tracks. “Oh no.” He moaned, the sight before him hit harder than he thought it would.
In a few more minutes Barry's leg's would be completely healed. Hopefully they had a few more minutes. Cas knew he had to stall, or at least keep his brother's attention on himself, "I remember when Father first created humanity and how much you hated them, even then. I remember when you corrupted Cain. I remember it all because I was there."
"Come on," Barry couldn't hold himself back any more. He knew a bad plan when he saw one, hell he'd been a part of more than a few himself, the disastrous plan to rescue the President from the dominators three years back came to mind, "Are you just going to waltz right through hordes of zombies and shoot the actual Devil in the face?!" Barry couldn't believe he'd just asked that question with completes seriousness.
“We've got your back.” Dean assured her.
Dean saw the Monitor reaching for them, “Don’t even think about it.” He warned.
Earth 38
“What do you mean?” Kara stepped up next to Sam, her mind going towards the next possible threat.
Even Cas failed to hold back a smile at the younger Winchester’s face. Then the angel had to run to catch up with Dean when he jogged ahead of the group. The last thing Cas wanted was to lose sight of Dean, distracted as the hunter was.
“No it’s not,” Cas reached out, skimming his fingers over the car’s roof. The old impala was no longer black, it was pitted and dented and didn’t even have three of it’s wheels. Growing up and through the engine were vines and the seats inside the previously immaculate interior were slashed and cut. Cas’s Dean would have never allowed such ruin to come to his most prized and beloved car, “This is bad.”
The Monitor continued, “Of 7.53 billion, 3 billion souls made it to Earth-1 on the armada of ships. I calculate 1 billion souls survived due to his noble sacrifice.”
As Cas and J'onn ushered people through the breach Barry's yellow lighting filled the town square and as sped in as many people from the city's outskirts as he could.
And for goodnesss sakes where was his angel?!
Barry eyes began to shine with unshed tears.
“I’d stop while you’re ahead kid,” Luthor sneered knowingly at Sam, “People around Krytonians tend to end up dead, or worse.”
Cas jolted as this was not at all what he expected to come out of Barry mouth, “I don’t know what you mean?”
“Did that really just happen?!” Sam asked, stunned by what they’d just witnessed and pointed at where the Galaxy had been only a second ago.
"So do you have a gluten sensitivity too?" Ray bounced happily on his feet, and with his hands shoved into his pants pockets his gave off the air of a child, not the huge six-foot four superhero that he was.
Mia’s words died in her mouth. Barry futility comforted her as she clung to her father’s body. Sara bit hard into her lip and turned her face away, then ran straight out of the room. Clark knew how close his family had come to being reduced to that and he held them all that much tighter. Kara walked numbly backwards until her back hit a wall.
"It's lame." Dean threw back, "Why listen to that when you could listen to this?" and he cranked up his car's radio.
Dean saddled up beside Sara and held out his empty glass which she promptly filled, “I get it. I was dead too for four months, or forty years depending on how you look at it. It doesn’t get any easier.”
“Do I know you?” The man was unimpressed.
Castiel nodded along with Cas's explanation, "In my case the big brass upstairs kinda pulled the plug on my connection to heaven and my power just kinda went, psshhew!" Castiel tilted his thumb downwards, "Really sucks when you've been one thing for millions of years only to be shoved down into something small and tiny and fragile." Righteous anger rolled of Castiel.
"Why?" The tall one asked, gulping deeply.
"I'll explain later." Dean leaned and close and whispered in the angel's ear.
After his frankly disturbing encounter with the incendiary author Cas decided he wanted to find Dean… and Sam he added in an afterthought. But mostly Dean. After returning the child to his parents Cas walked around yet another bend in the long empty corridor. How big was this ship? He halted when a deep voice reverberated off the walls ominously.
“How? We destroyed it last year.” Barry asked.
"If you are the Paragon then we need you."
If Barry's question offended Castiel he didn't show it, he just shrugged his scrawny shoulders, "I'm not an angel anymore."
Only then did the man turn and take in the three heroes.
“Kate?” Batman looked like he’d seen a ghost.
“Castle?” Cas frowned at Dean’s choice of words. Surely there wasn’t going to be a Castle on Earth-14? Humans were strange. But Dean was his human. Maybe he wasn’t so alone after all.
The Monitor continued on, “Sara Lance is the Paragon of Destiny.”
“So the Paragon of Courage is apparently afraid of yardwork.” Kara carefully picked her way across the positively run-down front gate of Wayne Manor.
Dean quickly swigged down the water to wash out his mouth. Then Dean followed his brother’s gaze to the Kryptonian woman and smirked.
“Where’s Sam?” Cas called out to Dean.
“Hey Dean!” Kate shouted suddenly making the two men jump apart, “Get a move on before I leave your ass!” She said and ducked back around the corner she appeared from.
“Hahhhhh!!” Water exploded outwards as a body launched itself high into the air with an animalistic scream.
“I have to go.” Cas said holding the baby a little closer, “And be somewhere else.” With that he fled further into the ship.
"I'm…" Superman began.
“So, in this way. We're each a fragment of total perception” Cas recognized his own gravely voice, although this one had a strange off-kilter lit to the way it said it words, “just, uh, one compartment in that dragonfly eye of group mind. Now, the key to this total, shared perception. It's, um, it's surprisingly physical.”
Dean felt Cas's grip on his arm tightened and he looked down at his angel.
Cas looked at the colt and then at Dean, "I don't know. On my Earth the colt failed. It shouldn't have, but it did. Here, in this reality. I am unsure."
"This is ACDC. I thought I taught you better than that." Dean griped but couldn't help but smile fondly on his music and pop culture pupil and Cas smiled back.
"You were ambushed by what?" Barry asked, coming further into the room now that it seemed a safe bet the angel wasn't going to be smiting Dean anytime soon.
“I’m sure you are.” Kara smiled up at him.
Kate awkwardly scratched behind her ear, inwardly searching for anyway to put off reporting what happened on Earth 99. When she had nothing, she at last gave the bad news, "Uh, so Batman tried to kill Kara, stabbed Dean, and now he's dead, so we're doomed." Kate tired to sound nonchalant but her failure weighed heavily on her.
A blue portal sprang to life, depositing Constantine and Mia who held of Oliver’s body between them.
"Ok."
Dean chuckled and lowered his gaze from Cas’s piercing blue one, “Whoever taught you to be a sarcastic SOB should be punched.”
“No it’s ok,” Kara held her hand up, “I get it. I really do. You just lost everything you’ve ever known and now you’re on a strange Earth with strange people who are asking for your help. That would be a lot, for anyone. And it’s ok to not be ok.”
Mia and Oliver let their arrows loose which shot through several demons. Upon contact the dark spirits flew apart in a cloud of dark ash.

“All right, get inside!” Sam ushered a group into the ship’s cargo hold. As he brought up the last family with him the ship’s captain, a man with yellow skin, stopped Sam.
Sam watched the unconscious man for any signs of movement. Nothing of the Oliver who died for Earth-38 was present. It was a monster, just as he’d been without his soul. He had to fix this.
The hairs on the back of Cas's neck prickled. Dean was right. They were too close to Lucifer for it to be this quiet.
“All right,” Sara stepping in between the two to prevent them from coming to blows, if the look on the young warrior’s face was any indication, “Now we need to decide on teams.”
“You can make a rift that large?” Cas squinted at Alex in disbelieve, “Even arc-angels would struggle accomplish such a feat.”
“Wow,” Sam still couldn’t believe that he was working with the real honest to God Superman. At Kara, Dean and Cas’s look, “Our lives are weird.”
Kara was glad to know that Mick on any Earth was still Mick, “Hi Mick.” She raised her hand in a small wave.
Dean was worried now. "Cas!? Talk to me right the hell now." he leaned across the back seat and tried and failed to pry the angel's hands of his head.
Cas opened his mouth to retort.
Claire returned his grin, “Its ok. You’re really not so stuck up anymore are you?” She teased.
“Hold the line!” Oliver ordered and the demons poured in.
“Just give it some time.” Sara waved her hand at Mia, gesturing for her to stay put. Then to Sam and Constantine, “When he comes out we have to restrain him as fast as possible. Understood?” She inclined her head at the hunter.
“I want to help with the evacuation. Count me in.” Sam blurted. Off Dean’s look, “This is something I have to do.” Then to Alex, “But where can you even send them?”
Cas reached for Dean but he was too slow. Dean spun around his duffel bag and cut open his palm. The three had just a second to register that a sigil had been painted across the bag's fabric before Dean slammed his palm down and searing light and sound rendered them unconscious.
Kara punched her fist through the glass and took her cousin’s glasses. The broken plastic she pressed to her heart was more precious than all the riches in the world. In any world. No way was she leaving all that was left of this Earth’s Kal in the house of a madman.
"Pull it out!" He gritted through his teeth.
Holy shit! That was it. Those was the only two words Sam could coherently think.
"No," Cas growled in anger.
“Trying to re-create an entire world would surely drive one to madness.” The Monitor warned.
Dean tried to brush past Cas only to be stopped by the angel's strong grip." You're letting them, letting your Cas die."
“So who do we think this Paragon of Freedom is?” J’onn had a feeling Cas had a good idea.
"What are you going to do?" J'onn asked.
"We don't have to find Lucifer. We know where he is. The demon that we caught last week, he was one of the big guy's entourage. He knew." Dean said.
Kara started and then inwardly berated herself. Come on, she had supersonic hearing and she couldn’t notice one hunter walking up to her? She really was losing it. “Do what?” She frowned.
Far away in the center of the city Sam was content in his decision as he watched the ships race skyward. Death was a certainty for him, but that man would be able to live another day with his family. Saving people was the family business. He always figured he’d go out like this. The sky above lit up bright with the oncoming wave and the suddenly he was no longer on Earth 38. The Monitor transported him away.
With a sigh Lucifer turned his back to the three heroes. He walked a short distance to a small rose bush, cupping a small bloom in his hand, "I'm sad to see this stunning thing disappear. This world was one of God's last perfect creations." Plucking the flower, he crushed it in his palm and dropped it to the dirt, "Perhaps the next creator will be just as imagined. I look forward to seeing his new world."
Dreamer continued his explanation, “We are thinking about moving willing people to Mars for the time being. The Martians have underground dwellings that can be converted to be habitable for humans.”
“That's why Brainy left J'onn his keys.” Dreamer smiled knowingly at Sam.
Sam chewed the inside on his mouth, eyes dropping to the floor, “I’m sorry.”
Author's Note: Thank you all so much for the support. As I was writing this next chapter it became over forty pages long. Woah! So as to not keep you all waiting so long I decided to split it up into two chapters. This chapter is very interpersonal relationship heavy and this was a lot of fun to write but boy am I tired. A lot more action is on the way soon. Please feel free to comment with any questions or comments. I love hearing from you. I will say a mild trigger warning for unhealthy coping mechanisms towards the middle of this chapter. With all that said I hope you enjoy!
The camp had been briefed and the highest-ranking members of Dean's squad were present in the main cabin. That consisted of Dean, Castiel nursing a hangover with a cup of powdered coffee, a few gruff ex-military types.
"Listen," Barry addressed Dean, his hands wringing themselves due to the stress, "We aren't trying to undermine you. And given the right circumstances I could see the same choice you made being made again, but what you did…" Barry's face scrunched up and he threw his arm at the door, "True leaders inspire their people, they don't terrify them."
“So Luthor,” Sam said jerking a thumb over his shoulder, “He’s an even bigger dick than in the comics. I didn’t think that was possible.”
"I can't save everyone, and he knew what he was sighing up for."
Dean could only numbly meet Cas's eyes, "What?" his voice barely louder than a whisper.
“Aliens man.” Dean couldn’t help but remember the little “alien incident” a few years ago that had really turned out to be fairies. Why couldn’t he have dealt with the real deal, it would have been so much cooler than the supernatural crap he faced on the daily.
Sam took in their staring contest and smirked half-heartedly. Kara glanced at him questioning. Sam cleared his throat, knowing his brother and Cas could do this for hours if left alone.
“Stay back.” Dean caught her sleeve just in time, “It’ll kill you.”
“Buddy I don’t know what’s in the Kool-Aid you’re drinking in 2019 but I ain’t no hero.” Dean brushed himself off and stood, shrugging the angel’s grip off quite unkindly when Cas tried to help. Cas’s face crumpled and he simply let his hand drop to his side.
“But Cas, isn’t that a good thing?” Dean was very worried for his angel right now. Having been given a big power boost Dean would think the dude would be thrilled. Right now it looked like someone had just stepped on a bee in front of Cas.
Dean stared blankly, bile rising in his throat. All glee at seeing his childhood heroes bled out. Everyone they'd ever saved, everyone they'd ever loved was gone. The graphic of Earth 79 disintegrated and faded away, the screen reading 'SIGNAL LOST'.
“Two entire universes wiped from existence distilled down to a computer graphic.”
Something akin to hurt and perhaps longing flitted across this Dean’s face but Cas couldn’t be sure. This was a Dean he barely even recognized.
Cas tugged one last time and let his arm hang with a sigh, “I’m familiar with the concept. Dean we have traveled here because we need your help.”
Cas raised a single eyebrow, “On a typewriter?”
Sam gulped.
"Yes I agree." Alex agreed, "You said the multiverse was in trouble." Pointing her finger at Harbinger.
Sam's heart went out to the Kryptonian, knowing all too well what it was like to lose parents. He also still didn't know what had happened to his own Earth yet. If that light they saw before being whisked away was anything to go by, nothing good.
"Troubling him?! You just took a shot at him without explanation in front of all your people, man." Barry threw his arm out at the cabin door, "Don't you think that scared them even a little?"
“Of course.” Sam nodded.
To say that people's jaws dropped would have been an understatement.
“Hi I’m Sam Winchester.” He held his hand out to the young woman.
“That’s an understatement.” Alex said then looked at the ceiling when a buzzing sound rumbled the tent.
Castiel did as he was told. The cars behind them honked their horns as they passed by. Cas got out and made his way to the driver's side while Castiel scooted awkwardly across the middle consul and dropped himself into the passenger's seat.
Lucifer snapped his fingers.
“I will.” Cas said. And when did he get so close to Dean? “And you be safe.” Cas said stepping closer which Dean hadn’t thought possible but he wasn’t complaining.
Cas only groaned in pain. The air around the three simmered in the high-pitched wail of an angel's true voice.
“Just a little disorienting to be so high without my wings.”
"I have to do what best for everyone. I can't trade the life of one man for this entire camp. They're counting on me to make the hard decisions to keep them alive."
“I'm sorry. Go back,” Ray looked like he was short circuiting, “Bruce Wayne is the Dark Knight?”
"Ok then," the tall one slid his dagger into his jacket, "Hello I'm Sam Winchester, this is my brother Dean. And this is…" he gestured to the man in the trench coat who'd come to hover particularly close to Dean's side.
“Go,” Kara hugged him, “I’m going to stay here for now.”
“At home with JJ.” Harbinger, “He still doesn't know about Oliver.”
With Constantine sufficiently cowered Sara turned her attention back to Barry, her gaze much softer, her arm coming up to rest on his bicep, “Right now we need you on this mission. Superman is searching for the Paragon of Truth while Batwoman and Supergirl search for the Paragon of Courage. There’s only so many of us on this boat with powers and we need you all out in the field.”
The three came to a stop just outside a fence barrier the surrounded the outskirts of the city. Beat up and dented signs mounted in several meter increments all along the barrier read, “Quarantine No Entry. August 1
“You’re still a doof,” Claire’s face softened, “Its good to see you Castiel,” It was Cas’s turn to be shocked when the girl threw her arms around him.
Dean threw off the angel's hand, "You don't know that."
Alex’s voice came over their comms accompanied with the skies outside growing dark and returning to the menacing red hue from before, “They're on the roof.”
"NO!" Barry shouted and lurched forwards.
The Monitor looking him up and down, eyes searching and analyzing. It made Cas uncomfortable.
Sam and Dean hung back, feeling far too out of sorts for their comfort level. Suddenly overwhelmed and needing air Sam grabbed his brother’s arm and nodded towards the open-air balcony over-looking the city.
“If there is any chance at surviving the Crisis, we need its technology.” The Monitor walked up to Sara.
Ray was the one who answered, "It's a quantum tower, apparently." As if that cleared it all up, which for half the people in the room Ray may as well have been speaking Greek.
"That was impressively stupid." Louis said with open mouthed awe.
“Sammy,” Dean said quietly, “We’ve done far worse for far less. Maybe this plan had something to it.”
“What?” Mia shouted at Sara who stood over Oliver with the offending needle in her hand, “You tranqed him?” She was outraged.
“Time traveling spaceship? Really?!” Dean threw his arms up cause come on how much could a sane man really take.
Cas felt grief bubbling at the back of this throat, "He killed you, right in front of us." Right in front of me. Cas didn't say the last part out loud but Dean understood, his shaken expression matching Cas's.
Cas confirmed, “Dean traveled to a version of this Earth in 2010.”
The Monitor was as cryptic as ever in his callous response, “His destiny was unfulfilled. Lex Luthor still has an important role to play.”
Turning to the Earth 79 survivors J’onn waved for them to follow him, “Sam, Dean. While I was going through the refugees minds I found something I think you should see.”
“Ahem.” Kara straightened her glasses, raised her foot, and kicked the door right out of the brick wall. The door flew inwards a few feet and crashed to the floor, shattering the tile beneath it.
In the next moment Earth 14 ceased to exist.
Dean shut his eyes tight and shook his head, “Anyone else get a headache from that.”
The bitchface Sam gave was worthy of the record books.
“We still got billions to safety.” Sam hesitantly put a comforting hand on her shoulder, “That’s not nothing.”
Sam placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. Kara smiled sadly up at him and then dropped her eyes to the floor. Seeing the faith that he already had in her in the short amount of time they’d known each other was overwhelming, especially since she felt like all she’d done the last day was fail on an epic scale.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Dean's anger bubbled over, "Why didn't you do anything to save our world? Why did you let them all die?" the words flew out of his mouth like daggers towards Harbinger.
“Superman was sent here to protect the Earth.” Kara clenched her fists.
“Hex.” She greeted the man with a curt tilt of her head but didn’t relax for one second, “We need to use this pit, then we’ll be on our way.” Sam noticed with practiced eyes how she readied her stance for combat.
“I…” He began, gulping as he admitted his biggest and most costly mistake, “I freed the Anti-Monitor from his confinement only to become a Pariah. Sentenced to bear witness to his actions.”
“Woah tell it like it is,” Dean was pissed on Barry’s behalf, nothing said motivation like wishing a member of your team had died.
"Nice to see you to Risa." Dean flexed his sore jaw while he took his place at the front of the table while Risa dropped herself into a chair and propped her boots up on the tabletop.
“Here,” Dean gently pushed her aside, “I got this.” The confidence in his posture rose as he took a step back and shoved his full body weight against the door… Which he bounced right off of, “Huh mmm?” He rubbed his side in pain and threw himself against the door again. Then he tried the door handles, which Kate had just done thank you very much. If Kate’s eyes had lasers Dean would have been a burnt and smoking pile of ash. Finally, pride wounded, he rested his back against the unmoving entrance and raised his head to the two women, “I don’t got this.”
"Ok stop!" Dean suddenly shouted, drawing the attention of a few of his men. He raised his hand, showing them that he was in no need of assistance. Then to the three visitors, "Take a look around you," he said quietly, adjusting the duffle bag around his body, "This place should be white-hot with Croats. Where are they?"
Cas turned around to find the Monitor barely five feet away from himself. How the being had gotten so close to him unnoticed the angel could only blame on his failing grace.
“Where’s this army?” Dean watched the upper levels of the tower’s interior for hostiles and took up flank while Oliver took the point.
“I’m assuming being an angel entails more than just a harp.”
“The Anti-Monitor must have emptied all the circles of Hell.” Cas came up next to Mia with Dean at his side.
“If I plan to do anything stupid, I’ll let you know.”
Kate and Ray stood towards the back of the room while Barry and Mia paced anxiously. There was still one member of their team missing.
“Oh Sam,” Kara said suddenly standing, hand outstretched to lend any comfort she could to him. When the brothers had said they’d been hunters they didn’t give much else to go off of. She still knew precious little about their lives before the Crisis began.
On Earth 666, a planet ravaged by angels and humanity almost extinct, there was no warning. Bobby Singer lowered his binoculars from where he'd been spying on Michael's encampment as the grey skies over head changed color. "Balls." He groaned. In the blink of the eye the Apocalypse ended.
Oh! Oh no. Cas knew that look. Cas had seen that look when he first met Dean, not in the abandoned barn like the human remembered. The angel recognized the look from the very first moment that he came across Dean's soul in the pit, when he'd been elbows deep in another soul, his gleeful face smeared with blood.
More gun fire and inhuman wails followed.
Mia smirked, "Yeah he gets that a lot."
Castiel laughed and put his muddy boot up on the jeeps dash, "It's the perfect antidote to that absinthe."
Lucifer pressed onwards, "I can see your scarred wings. Your true form is a shadow of its former glory. How many times have you fallen? How much have you given to them? What more will you give for these hairless apes?"
“It is time!”
Oliver’s hand outstretched to grab the young woman, his fingers curled into claws.
“It’s going to be okay Barry, we’ll bring him back. I promise you that.” Sara knew that was promise she may not be able to keep, Barry knew it too but if felt good to say it regardless.
Kara nodded, “Hold on tight.” She wrapped an arm around Cas’s waist and shot skyward like a bullet with Clark following close behind.
"Because he was turning." Dean shoved Cas back, the blow doing pitifully little to loosen Cas's grip, "We were in an open quarantine zone. Got ambushed by some Croats on the way out."
Kara placed her palm on Oliver’s forehead, wishing she could make this easier for her friend.
Back on the battlefield Barry raced to a stop. No. No. This was happening all too fast for the fastest man alive.
The jeep was righted on the road and those inside were left gasping with racing heart beats.
The top most galaxy promptly disintegrated into oblivion when a wave of light washed over it. The Anti-Monitor had struck again.
