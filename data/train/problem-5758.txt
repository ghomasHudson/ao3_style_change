T’Challa clasped his hands behind his back, something Steve noticed he did before delivering somewhat hefty news.
“Sergeant Barnes,” she greeted mildly, then her gaze flickered to Steve, something passing over her expression before disappearing entirely. “Captain Rogers, Natasha. Please. Take a seat and we can get started.”
Bucky looked at the back of Toni’s head as he spoke. “Yeah,” he said quietly, cleared his throat, then said again louder, “Yeah, that’s...that’s fine.”
.” She was only vaguely aware she was seething, that there was a simmering rage behind the arc reactor that was fueling her words. “You don’t take matters into your own fucking hand without knowing all your angles. You don’t just fucking declare your stance on shit you don’t fully understand and then expect the rest of the world to follow you just because you think you stand on the right side of righteousness. You don’t just fucking
I am so, so glad to hear so many of you enjoyed the previous chapter. Less plotty and more feels and coziness and now I bring you...this. This is a fairly big one, so gird your loins and get something to drink because it might take a while. As always, thank you to everybody who took the time to read this fic and leave a comment or a kudos or bookmark the story. I honestly never thought so many people would be reading this much less telling me that they enjoyed it so thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
“After you burp him you can put him down for a nap if you like.” Laura stood in the doorway, rubbing her hands with a damp cloth.
she asked again, taking a moment of relief when Peter swung down from the building with the last of his rescuees. “Who the hell’re you?”
Other than the thick blanket of barely suppressed anger and betrayal that permeated the room whenever Antonia Stark was brought up he knew very little about the diminutive woman who had attacked him with such ferocity and rage and almost killed him in that Siberian bunker.
before resuming her explanation once more, her voice cool and her expression even. “Anyway. This baby is gonna be as perfect as we can get it. Unlike HYDRA’s disaster, we’ve based the weight and range of movement to that of your real arm and it’s got enough Vibranium in it that it’ll be as indestructible as you can get. Unless you decide to fight someone from Wakanda, in which case my advice would be
For Stark it was a study in pain as she came to a stop, her gaze fixed on an immovable point somewhere over Colonel Rhodes’ shoulder.
There was very literally chaos in the streets because taking out all the traffic lights within a five-mile radius in during lunch-hour rush would do that. Natasha had already gotten the okay from the Panel while squeezing herself into a suit and Toni received a call from the mayor herself so they were a go all around.
“Hello, Your Highness,” she replied, imbuing a little warmth into her voice because when he looked at her like that, how could she not.
Clint stared down at the phone in his hands and wondered when he’d turned into such a useless fuck-up. His wife, his
Shuri do anything. And I think Captain Rogers has spent enough time indoors. A little sun will put some color back in him.”
“S’been a while,” he rasped and Bucky could hear the countless questions, maybe the countless accusations, in those few words.
Toni breathed in slowly through her nose, then straightened and made her way past the HR lady and into the room, meeting T’Challa’s gaze one last time before crossing the threshold.
is not passive. It is an action that affects people whether they like it or not. Whatever your intentions it does not diminish the fact that people are receiving your kindness.”
Laura huffed. “To give you something to take your mind off of whatever happened. And maybe, when you’re ready, you can tell me about it.”
she declared, then felt herself physically soften at the memory of Shuri’s distress over the con-call. “She was just trying to help. She’s worried about you.” The
“That in itself seems to be a problem. Additionally, you seem to have conveniently forgotten that you and five of your friends are currently labelled international terrorists and are hiding out in a country that has only recently revealed its true self to the world.” She sent him a dry look followed by a punch that got him in the ribs. “You are essentially pampered prisoners. A gilded cage is still a cage.”
“But it can be done,” she continued, trying for a level of certainty that she didn’t feel. “It can all be done.”
… “Okay.” She bit her lip and started again, revising her previous course of action. “Okay. Has Rhodey said anything?”
It was very obviously not directed at her and Toni wasn’t expecting it to be anyway. Still, she felt Rhodey bristle, uttering something under his breath and that...that had to be enough.
And that. A young woman’s crushing disappointment over Toni’s failure as a hero and as a human being. That was infinitely worse than if Shuri had just hated her for being mean to her friend.
Bucky wondered whether Steve’s silence meant that Steve didn’t want to say anything at the risk of Stark’s reaction or whether it was because in spite of the risks he trusted Stark’s capabilities and was determined to put his faith in her.
Laura stared at her, hazel eyes a little wider and her lips parted slightly, as if seeing Toni for the first time, as if something had finally clicked in her brain.
Control over her abilities came easy, something Toni was immensely proud of her for, but Toni still received the occasional panicked calls from toilet cubicles or her school’s locker room after having gotten into an argument or after getting yelled at by a teacher, so it would be up to Toni to calm her down until one or all of her limbs returned to normal.
The arrangements with the UN were finally getting underway and she’d forwarded the first batch of her main amendments to the respective representatives and had already heard back from a couple of them. She sent T’Challa the one she’d worked on with Laura. It took three hours for her to compose that email and another three hours for her to actually send it.
“Yeah. That I have one less thing to worry about.” Feeling a little bit lighter, she hopped off the high stool and grinned at them. “So, Platypus. Wanna try on your new legs?”
Her heart froze inside her chest cavity, a trillion stars condensed together and vibrating at a frequency beyond anything the world had ever seen.
In spite of it all, Bucky couldn’t help but notice that Stark was as thorough as Doctor Cho was in her explanation of the arm and how she intended to install it. She expanded on terms like nerve electrodes and neural interface, broke them down to concepts all of them could grasp and went into the finer details of care and maintenance.
“Yeah,” Steve breathed. “Shoulda been us.” He let out a heavy sigh. “Do you think,” he began, mulling over the question he didn’t know whether he wanted answered or not. “Do you think she’ll call?”
It was still hard to believe that this was her world, that these were her people. Rhodey laughing with a quietly amused T’Challa over a glass of wine, Natasha and Peter - who still wore his mask around Strange at Toni's insistence, which was ever so slowly waning - in a corner with their inside spider jokes, Strange -
her thinking about all the ways she’s gonna improve these babies. And I appreciate the hell out of it. It’s what she does; she fixes things and makes them better. She just…”
Steve’s voice had cut off again and Bucky stepped up to his side, eyeing them one by one, watching as silent realization and
“Toni-?” T’Challa began but she cut him off, gripping his warm hands like they were a lifeline and her only source of courage.
you keep up to date on all the latest developments in the industry. I just thought you might wanna see…” She let the non-mention of his hands hang in the air and felt his hands curl into unsteady fists in her palms.
“I try.” She wandered over and perched herself next to him on the edge of the console, watching as he stuck his hand through a small portal next to him and pulled out a glass of lemonade. She was even more surprised when, rather than hand it to her, he laid it on the console between them, letting her pick it up in her own time. “Thank you,” she said quietly and he gave her a flash of a smile before sipping his own drink.
“I don’t know,” he said slowly, keeping his eyes on T’Challa and wondering whether he was more the hurt-my-sister-and-you-will-pay or, even worse, an

Knowing that sleep wasn’t coming easy tonight, Toni crept her way into the hall, down the stairs and out the front door. The night was cool and the faint breeze made her long shirt waft up around her thighs. Her bare feet sank into the soft grass as she padded her way around the house. The horses made faint thumping noises against the barn walls and the leaves rustled overhead.
Stark jerked and twisted to look over her shoulder, passing over him and settling on a point behind. She narrowed her eyes and when Bucky turned to look, he saw Steve and the others - everyone who had been present during his surgery save for Doctor Strange - filing into the circular observatory room.
met, Toni Stark and Natasha Romanov, two women with more red on their ledgers and even more distrust in their hearts.
“I shall redirect this conversation to the question I had intended to ask earlier. Do you trust Natasha Romanov’s presence in the Compound? If you have any reservations as to her intentions I will be more than willing to monitor her activities.”
Steve didn’t know what he’d expected, but it wasn’t the downward curvature of the corners of her mouth or the lines of tension around her eyes or the slump of her slender shoulders until all she looked was small. Almost as small as Toni.
In the doorway, looking like a deer in headlights, stood Sam. He blinked back at them, eyes darting towards Toni more than once, lingering over her appearance and undoubtedly noticing that she was in the same clothes as the day before, and shifted a little from foot to foot.
Also, thank you to everyone who has left me comments/messages here and on Tumblr, asking after my wellbeing and just checking in with me. That is so sweet of you and I feel incredibly humbled by your well wishes and kind words, so truly, madly, deeply, thank you.
She and Rhodey had eaten dinner in Vision’s room, an enlarged projection of the Accords floating in front of them.

When she did come to the Compound - which started off as twice a week and then rather rapidly increased to four or even five days a week - Kamala followed Toni
like you. A girl genius fighting the bad guys.” Her smile dropped, and became sheepish. “Well, I guess I’m starting on one of those things, anyway. Might be a little too late to become a genius.”
He motioned to the girl’s hand and it was indeed, much to Toni’s extreme panic, the size of a small dog
. The entire concept was stupid and impossible, of course, but self-help books and zen blogs made a killing off promoting the so-called silencing of the mind.
Steve struggled not to let the entire mood of the room get to him. The longing looks from Wanda, the stoic disinterest from Vision, Clint’s prickliness, Nat’s decisive placement in the room, Rhodey’s professional frostiness and Steve’s own mental turbulence told him everything and nothing about the current state of the team.
They made it to the roof and Nat had a brief second of panic when she realized Toni was barefoot in a t-shirt and sweats and had
Relief that settled more firmly once he took in his surroundings. He didn’t realize until his preconceived notions shattered before him that he’d even
The slow-motion crinkling of her red suit, deafening in her ears. The glass-like explosion of a blue heart.
He’d conjured the mirror dimension around the entirety of the training room and Wanda’s magic crashed and exploded against it, casting vivid scarlet fractals across the floor and ceiling.
“Damn right. Sometimes I don’t know whether to just let them run free with all their crazy ideas or cover them in bubble-wrap.”
He tongue curled around the words. An army. But it was more than that, wasn’t it? That was barely scratching the surface of whatever bandaid had reinforced itself over the wounds of her psyche. It was
.” And here he paused and Nat observed him carefully, taking in the subtle incline to his chin and the hard set of his expression. “I believe we all know what the outcome will be. We have worked tirelessly over the past months and I believe this final hearing is more of a...formality. A PR strategy by the Council. Do you agree, Ms. Romanov?”
Toni violated about fifty traffic laws in the span of that one-sided conversation and T’Challa - seriously, thank god for the people around her - answered on her behalf.
Natasha studied her face fiercely for a long moment before something sad, almost distraught, passed over her striking features and her shoulders slumped like all the fight had just left her body.
They ate slowly, as if trying to prolong the inevitable, Toni included. They didn’t talk much; they didn’t need to. Everything important had already been said during her month and a half stay that had gone by in the blink of an eye.
It was easier, she thought, to think of it in those terms. To focus on the practicality of her work and ignore the roiling mess of emotions in the endless cavern of her chest.
Toni stared at her back for a long time, realization of the intensity of Laura’s grief and anger rendering Toni
prickling the top of her spine. She felt it as the others shifted and rose to their feet in anticipation. She felt it
“What ever happened to ‘be thankful there’s only two of them?’ Now I hear you’ve got yourself two more?”
,” Steve hissed, unable to stop himself, then glanced around discreetly to make sure no one had been alerted to his outburst.
Her left hand felt funny and her fingers were cold again for some reason and she absently rubbed them together, plastering a wide smile onto her face and surveying all of them.
Something exploded, sending marble blocks and debris onto the officers below and Toni had three seconds to grab a couple of feds before they were flattened.
“He’s right,” Nat said with her arms crossed over her chest. On her other side Vision shifted in a way Toni knew meant he was listening,
“Do you think,” he said thickly, his mouth as dry as sandpaper, “you could get me a copy of those Accords?”
“You should tell him that when you see him again,” Toni said. “You should tell him you’re angry. Lay it into him. Or punch him in the face, whichever works. Do both even. Get the asshole to fucking
“-and there was this really weird mist, right? And then I see this girl collapse on the street outside and she literally starts melting into the drain-”
Steve had never intended for things to go down the way they did, but at this point, he was just following the plot.
Her gloved fingers stilled. She didn’t know how Laura had done it, kept the secret for this long but a part of her had hoped that just for a little longer, she could’ve pretended.
“This is very good work.” T’Challa scanned through his own draft contract, nodding at the extra precautions they’d taken due to him being royalty as well as masked. “Once these contracts become public knowledge, I foresee that enhanced individuals will be more willing to approach us.”
“Already done. They’ve got the skeleton contract done up and are just waiting for Ms. Van Dyne's input. And yours.”
He’d had his reservations, a logical level of scepticism at her reasons for trying to clear his name and making it so public.
A grim, unhappy frown flitted across Steve’s face before he sat down on the bench, pressing his side into Bucky’s. There were times, still, where it was difficult to reconcile the sheer
She was over the motherfucking moon when T’Challa threw up the first batch of personal contracts on the holoprojector and saw nods and thoughtful note-taking from more than a few representatives because yes,
They weren’t okay. They wouldn’t be okay for a while, yet. But she and Nat had woven something relatively stable for the time being. Not a friendship; there was too much hurt and distrust for that yet, but it was
He wasn’t mad, per se. But then he was still drugged up. And Toni did seem sorry about everything. More than she needed to be. And she’d sworn not to do it again, so.
Toni was elbow-deep in kale when Laura spoke up for the first time that afternoon. There had been a nervous tension surrounding her all morning, and Toni, who was still on unsteady ground with the other woman, had opted to wait for her to make the first move.
“Yeah. When. I meant what I said before. That I was...” She shrugged. “That I was working on a way to get them back. To bring them here.” She’d almost said ‘home’, a concept she wasn’t sure applied to anything anymore. They weren’t a family regardless of how much certain members, certain members that may even have included herself, wanted them to be.
She smiled, and it was bright and cheeky, though the edges hardened when she met Toni’s eyes and, oh.
“Help me get him to the car.” It wasn’t a request and were she not clearly worried about jostling him and causing more damage, T’Challa suspected she likely would have and could have carried him herself.
Bucky must’ve seen it on his face, for his eyes widened and he sharply shook his head, his hand already reaching out to stop him but unfortunately, Steve’s mouth worked quicker than his brain and what came out was just…
Toni’s thumb was being gnawed on within an inch of its life until Stephen’s large hand came down on her shoulder. He didn’t say anything at first and she removed the abused digit from her mouth and crossed her arms, tucking her hands into her sides and practically hugging her body for strength.
“Sorry, sorry,” she said, walking around Bucky’s bed, switching on one of the large monitors that hung from the ceiling and angling it over the bed. “That was Shuri. She said she’s good to video in on the surgery if you’re still good with that, Barnes.”
“We are not so cruel as that, Ms. Stark,” Councilwoman Ueno interrupted in a level, almost kind tone. When Toni met her gaze, the woman even offered a small smile and inclined her head in acknowledgment. “Nor are we so impractical so as to let you assume such responsibility over the Avengers. That’s what the Panel and a Subcommittee are for. We are merely highlighting that there is a very real possibility that no matter how much you fight for your former teammates you cannot and should not promise that they will so easily bend to the restraints, however light, that have been placed on them.”
She replayed the words over and over, just so she could memorize Peter’s face as she said them, in some morbid sort of self-punishment.
“And now you’re king,” she agreed softly. She licked her lips and leaned forward. “If you want, the next time you’re in the country I’ll build a pillow fort with you.”
“It’s very sleek. Almost like a catsuit. Big fan of your work on the Accords, by the way. And of you in general. Went to a couple of your conferences but never got the chance to introduce myself. Can I sign one of those contracts?”
Some things I'd like to point out are that the MCU's political situation is pretty sparsely portrayed so I've taken so many liberties with how international situations are resolved but ultimately I probably messed up legal procedures and stuff, so I'm going to hide behind the explanation that this is fiction, so please go easy on me?
Toni looked at her for a brief moment. “That would be something, huh?” Then she dropped the pin into the metal tray.
She sat on the frigid ground, her back resting against the walls of the greenhouse she and Vision had built with their own two hands, and looked up at the clear night sky and the stars beyond.
Squeezing her eyes shut, she rubbed the center of her forehead and repeated, her voice sounding distant to her own ears,
He brought up all the salient points. Masks. The importance of anonymity of their heroes - that was still a long way in the making. The unjustifiable risk of taking too long to come up with a decision when a crisis was looming overhead. It was only the first session of the first day and already Toni knew he’d made an impact.
Things in the team’s apartment had been...strained to say the least. Lots of emotions floating around, lots of discreet looks through the corners of eyes and lots of confusion and frustration and a whole lot of
The word came to mind like a whisper and she dropped her gaze, poking unseeingly at her breakfast and only vaguely listening to Peter - who had elected to revealing the bottom half of his face around Stephen, though the guy wasn't stupid and had probably already caught on - help Kamala with her math homework  - while Harley took apart one of Toni’s old gauntlets next to them.
to it that Toni was familiar with. It was the kind of silence she let seep out of her when people tried to ask her about Afghanistan or the wormhole. It was the distant look Natasha got sometimes when she saw ballerinas on TV, or how Rhodey would cut a training session short and step out of War Machine, claiming his legs were tired even though the suit took all of his weight.
When it was all over, the last recording ended on Peter’s view of the bay and the ferry that Toni had helped fix, right before she laid into him in a way he didn’t deserve.
And then it was her turn. Because the people wanted her for something different. Always had and always would.
Toni worried a loose thread on her sleeve between her fingers. She knew the political atmosphere in Wakanda wasn’t the greatest at the moment and that T’Challa’s presence in his homeland was paramount to easing said tensions, but if Shuri’s sad eyes and her honest desperation were anything to go by, Toni had completely underestimated just how much stress he must be under.
It was the truth. She’d attacked savagely. With claws and teeth and rage and the need to make someone else

“As long as you want,” was the immediate response. “As long as you need to and,” she trailed off. “As long as you think you should.”
Toni huffed and slumped in her seat. “This is very unfair. Shuri and I are just beginning our epic, science-fueled friendship of a lifetime and you want me to betray her trust.”
Okoye. It was a name he’d heard numerous times but he’d yet to meet the renowned leader of the infamous Dora Milaje. His gaze travelled to a calm-faced T’Challa, but Steve was almost certain the man was laughing at his faintly hysteric concern.
Hope and Lang followed, hand in hand, Lang practically clinging to her. It was that that made her call out once more.
Peter tugged off his mask and Shuri swivelled around in her seat, the both of them wearing similar expressions of youthful, wide-eyed expectation. Rather than stifling, their attention felt patient and Toni was grateful for it as she ran through her conversation with Strange and examined FRIDAY’s analyses of Strange’s powers while he was in the Compound.
It was like walking through a dense fog, like her brain had leaked out of her ears and the cavern of her head was filled with heavy and humid vapor.
Toni stilled, the hand holding her spoon hovering just out of reach of her mouth as she watched Rhodey slump a little in his chair.
Her heart being pulled out of her chest. Sometimes it sounded like glass in her dreams. Other times the Winter Soldier’s hands were dripping with blood. Hers. Howard’s. Her mother’s.
to look at the decisions that have led you to this point. I ask you to look and what you want for this world and for the people in it. I ask you to look at your people.” She looked at hers once by one, even the ones that weren’t here. Vision nodded at her, Rhodey smiled, Nat was a pillar of strength and T’Challa looked so, so
she hissed, baring her teeth up at him. “We are so done. And you know what?” She pointed at his chest and smiled nastily. “
“I count on what I know. Rhodey, Vision, FRIDAY. I count on Pepper to run my company. I count on aliens falling out of the sky to kill us all.” She smirked at the young king, and it was bitter and cruel. “That’s what I count on the most.”
“—said Rogers came clean the night they watched you the first time at the UN talks, after you brought up...brought up Barnes…”
the very thing that Captain America fought for.” Her eyes were bright and her chest heaving and she looked like a supernova. “
“Well, then,” she laughed, dry and mirthless, “We’ve all got our work cut out for us, don’t we?” Then her face changed and she smiled, small but real, at some unseen point on the table. “Then again, with the fate of the world resting on our shoulders, we always have, haven’t we?”
She came forward, taking something small out of her pocket and as if their minds were linked for a second time, Toni knew what it was before Shuri dropped that cold, dead weight into Toni’s hesitant, outstretched palm.
“Boss, we’ve found him,” FRIDAY interrupted and Toni’s focus sharpened to a fine point. “Cameras just picked him up in Tudor Park. He doesn’t look so hot, Boss.”
Much like the last few chapters, I owe a huge part of my soul to the brilliant, baddest ass beta of all, Demigodscum, without whom I would still be waffling over this chapter. Seriously, honey, you are the actual best. <3 <3 <3
She picked up the second power core using a pair of copper tweezers, inserting it into the round slot in his upper arm, clicking it into place. The arm lit up again almost immediately in streaks of blue and white.
Toni stiffened, glancing out of the corner of her eye as she counted Laura’s quiet footfalls. She settled down two feet away from Toni and tossed her a jacket. Her fingers spread across the synthetic material, her eyes darting upwards to meet Laura’s once before she put it around her shoulders. It smelled distantly of Clint’s favorite cologne and she closed her eyes for a moment, just to savor the memory.
“I want you to know, Ms. Romanov, that if any one of the Rogue Avengers steps out of line, if they threaten the balance and stability that Toni has fought so hard for, I will do what I must to protect her.” He stopped and gazed down at her with blazing blue eyes, and had she been anyone else she might have taken a step back in alarm. “My question to

“If you have any problems with the arm you let FRIDAY know.” She didn’t turn around as she spoke but Bucky wasn’t really expecting her to anyway. “Doesn’t matter what it is. If your reaction time is point zero three fifths of a second off I wanna know about it. I don’t

Releasing a shuddering breath, she rubbed a hand down her face. Before she could convince herself not to, she pulled out the phone from her back pocket, swiped her thumb across the holographic screen, then held it out in front of her to wait.
In the short time he’d come to know her, T’Challa had discovered many things about Toni. He’d seen the brash, sharp-tongued, quick-witted woman that he’d only glimpsed in the days leading up to the Avengers fight; he’d seen a woman whose regret and self-flagellation encompassed a space that was too big for her body and was ultimately undeserved; he’d discovered a softness, a gentleness and a beauty that he had little doubt Captain Rogers had encountered. But beyond all that was the irrational sense of responsibility that she alone had to carry the world and make it better. That she was the sole reason people came to harm.
smarter than me.” Shuri looked taken aback and Toni got to her feet. “You’re fucking awesome, Princess Shuri. You were never going to be like me. You’re always going to be better.”
This story has been a mental and physical challenge for me and is easily one of the longest things I've written/am writing and I'm learning a lot not only through writing but from the comments you guys leave me so really, thank you.
“Good.” She nodded, already turning to leave the same way she came in. “I’m glad. Shuri and Helen will be happy to hear that. I’ll let them know right away.”
“No, you’re not,” she agreed, surveying him head on, “but, if you want to, you could be. Regardless of what you choose, though, there will be conditions. For
Toni talked her through the motions sometimes, even let her manipulate one of the microscopic needles to fit the components into place.
Nat stood to the side of them, a little away, her hands clasped behind her back. She was it, the clear delineation between the two groups. Toni with Peter behind her, Vision to her right, Rhodey standing with his body angled towards her, Stephen standing behind a chair with his arms crossed and Hope rigid, looking like she was physically trying to hold herself together.
“Maybe I want to bring him here so I can finish the job,” she murmured not taking her eyes off T’Challa, waiting to see his reaction.
Helen nodded. “The dermal regenerator should do the trick and his healing will cover the rest as best as it can.”
, then sighed, quiet and distant and for a second Nat imagined a long-suffering, exasperated old man and a dark-haired little girl out on the lawn on a night like this.
They were deep underground in the most secure part of the Compound accessible only by a single elevator and an increasing number of security protocols that made the Raft look like, well, an actual
So it was good to know, at least from Rhodey’s point of view on the camera, that that wasn’t the case.
“Yeah,” Toni agreed, stroking his hair with an affection that T’Challa knew was hard-earned in its sentiment and made even more precious by the action. She looked up and he met her rawly vulnerable gaze in the mirror. “He’s the coolest.”
“My first thoughts were that it was a prison,” Stephen said and there was not a trace of judgment in his voice. “But when you sent me the notes and the blueprints I saw that Doctor Banner’s name all over. I’m guessing it’s meant to be less of a prison and more of a...security measure of sorts.”
But the fate of the world had never been in the balance before. Not until recent years, anyway. So she began with honesty. Because, as she’d discovered very early on in life, honesty was sometimes the best defense.

“Since this is a democracy and not a monarchy,” he said smoothly, “I believe we can do away with titles. ‘T’Challa’ is much more palatable than ‘Your Highness’, don’t you think?”
so powerful that it transformed her face into someone Toni didn’t recognize and yet was intimately familiar with, someone who should never have had to experience so much so young. “I wanted to kill him too.”
Hello everyone, and thank you all once again for all your lovely comments and kudos for the last chapter. I literally have a small conniption every time I get a message regarding this fic so I am super stoked that a lot of you seem to be enjoying it so far. :)
“A sounding board,” T’Challa supplied. “A counsellor of your own. I understand. I can do that for you. If you will do the same for me.”
“We are saying, Ms. Stark, that you have made quite the statement not only to us but to the entire world. We could have simply followed your lead with the amendments of the Accords. I’ll be the first to admit that we made…mistakes,” she conceded, “and miscalculations, the first time around. But then you had to appeal to the masses and their sympathies.” She smiled and it was a cold and unfeeling thing, distant in the way that ruthless women who had seen years and years of political turmoil and war seemed destined to bear. “And the world listened.
Toni blinked, momentarily forgetting that there was someone else in here with her until a distinctly female-shaped shadow fell across her. She pulled her hands away from where they’d been installing a series of floor sensors. Vision was training with Rhodey at the pool so it was just her and Shuri.
She stood there breathing hard, distantly aware of the heat in her cheeks and the prickling at the corners of her eyes.
The garment had slipped from the hanger easy as water. It’d felt soft and well-worn in his hands and he could almost imagine the afterimage of her skin remained embedded between the fibers. He brought the material to his nose and
“Yeah. It wasn’t even the fate of the world. And he left to help friends fight against other friends.” She scoffed, disbelieving. “I still can’t wrap my mind around it. What did he think he was doing
to T’Challa as he weighed her words, like he was balancing them against his own thoughts and actions in the wake of Wakanda’s opening to the world. She wondered whether some part of him regretted it, if only for the sake of his own mental wellbeing and that of his people.
“You’re Iron Man. You’re the current leader of the Avengers.” She almost scoffed because she had three people and a baby spider. “You’re the face of the Sokovia Accords that is garnering worldwide response. You are a hero. And you are someone I would like to call my friend.” The last part was laid bare before her, a special kind of vulnerability that she didn’t feel she deserved because this was a king. This was the King of Wakanda, the most secretive and technologically advanced country in the entire world. And he wanted to call her ‘friend’.
Vision on the other hand felt like an entirely new person to the synthezoid she had once trained. He ignored her for the most part and spent most of his time either alone or with Toni. It hadn’t escaped her notice that Toni had been using his room as a base as opposed to her own. At one point she’d walked past Toni’s original quarters twelve times before finally suffocating the urge to look inside and
She laughed, and it was high and somewhat disbelieving, embedded with an emotion that Peter couldn’t quite grasp. “You’d be the first. But I appreciate the sentiment, Petey.”
in some way. Like she was monitoring his reaction to see whether or not he’d prove whatever unspoken expectation she had about him.
She couldn’t promise, so she didn’t. But she had a feeling. And this was her lending credence to her old team, to what they had been and what she knew they could be if they stopped and
“No.” She shook her head of blonde hair. “It really wasn’t.” And now they weren’t just talking about Ross and her frankly untenable so-called reputation. She would’ve preferred if they’d stayed on that topic.
I saw and I studied every single call you made,” Shuri told her like her heart was breaking. And maybe it was. “Because you were the hero I wanted to be. You were the
“FRIDAY, did you get scans of his hand movements?” Shuri asked, practically dragging Toni’s tablet across the table away from her and transmitting the data to her kimoyo beads. “And the ring he was wearing. I think it’s some kind of conduit.”
And that was that. The only modicum of hope they had at this point in time. The weight of the world, the protection and well-being of
Thankfully she was saved from having to come up with anything more when FRIDAY’s voice filtered through the room’s speakers.
, but I was so goddamn tired.” She finally turned around, thankfully not crying, but Toni couldn’t deny that the poor woman looked worn out.
I've kind of been waiting to post this chapter since I first wrote it, almost entirely because of the first and last scenes. Also. Plotty things happen. Kind of. More notes at the end so I don't give anything away, lol.
There was a lengthy beat of quiet, the only sound in the room being the near imperceptible murmur of machinery running through the walls and beneath their feet, and the
A long time ago Jarvis had stood with her on the cold grounds of the Mansion and taught her that the universe beyond Earth was more beautiful than she could ever imagine. New York and a nuke had robbed her of the brilliance of that memory. And now, for the first time in forever, it was like she was back on those familiar grounds on a cool April night with the person she’d loved the most in the entire world standing right behind her.
. He smiled, then, and it was soft and so fond that it made her heart ache. “That is my duty, Toni. Wakanda is
He made to turn, then paused, seemingly debating with himself over something, before looking down at Steve.
When she looked up Ackerman’s mouth was moving but it felt slow, like someone had lowered the speed. This, she thought idly, fog sluggishly seeping through her synapses, was becoming a bit of an issue. She wondered if it was the pills Helen had given her and made a mental note to do a composite breakdown of the formula when she got back.
The memory of that exchange and the face of the woman who was always on his mind dulled his mood even more, despite knowing that he couldn’t half ass it with these women.
It wasn’t perfect. This wasn’t her world, this little pocket of purity that she only belonged in temporarily. But it was pretty damn close. And it was beautiful in its own right.
She laughed tiredly but it was a laugh nonetheless that softened the almost perpetual tension in the corners of her eyes, a rare enough sight these days that Rhodey committed it to memory.
He felt Nat look at him with something that felt like regret, maybe sympathy. He barely felt her gentle pat on his shoulder before she left, leaving him with an epiphany he didn’t know what to do or how to deal with.
“S’up, Toni,” he chirped sunnily, if a little shakily. “So, funny story. I was at a party in Jersey-”
, Vision has just informed me that Thaddeus Ross is looking for you. He’s coming this way right now.”
When she opened her eyes T’Challa’s breath caught in his throat and the pure terror mirrored back at him.
, Ms. Shuri,” FRIDAY replied smoothly with perhaps a hint of something smug. “I think you’ll find that I am a very comprehensive notetaker.”
Her voice sent a shiver up the back of his neck and Steve felt like a steel rod had been inserted into his spine.
“What, Toni?” He spoke softly like one might to a frightened creature ready to bolt. “What do you feel?”
of his soul filled the chamber and rested against the edges of her consciousness, and she opened her eyes, tugged into the present from her half-doze. His hand landed atop hers, alerting her to the sting of her nails digging into her thighs, and she made a conscious effort to relax her fingers until she could lace them through his.
Dummy cooed worriedly, trying to divide his attention between Vision’s heavy silence and FRIDAY’s righteous rage.
“Got into a school here, actually. Tennyson’s Green? It’s a prep school. I was gonna surprise you tomorrow but then I met
Toni watched Shuri work, watched Peter literally crawl across the table to get in on everything to do with Stephen Strange. He and Shuri didn’t often get to spend time with one another, what with school and Shuri’s back and forth from Wakanda. But when their paths did cross at the Compound they gravitated to one another like teenagers tended to do, seeking out similar company in a world of grown ups and responsibilities, no matter how vastly different their backgrounds. There was a short period of time where she worried that they might not get along but when she saw them out on the grounds from her window one afternoon, racing a couple of highly-upgraded drones with two boxes of pizza between them and Happy yelling at them to get off of the goddamn lawn, it set her concerns to rest.
Then Toni snorted incredulously, surveying the lot of them in amusement. “What the hell do you guys think this is, Grey’s Anatomy?” Her expression darkened, her mouth curling in distaste and fury. “Well guess what. No. No you
A hysterical bubble of laughter escaped her mouth in spite of herself and he smiled, apparently satisfied with himself.
Worry did that to a person but it was plainly obvious to Nat that this was something more than that. She’d already figured out Spider-Man had been a kid the first time Toni brought him in and she’d heard the excitement in his voice and seen the adolescent lines of his body, only on the cusp of broadening upwards and out.
Toni nodded encouragingly and stepped back a little, Stephen’s trembling hands hovering over hers as he started to let the power flow, generating a soft, orange warmth that she felt against her skin. As usual, his hands stilled, the tremors shuddering to a stop as his muscles visibly relaxed.
Some of the other doctors came in for a glimpse while others contented themselves with watching the screen on the far wall.
Kamala had made them in art class: one for each of the kids and one for Toni that was currently sitting on top of her favorite desk in the workshop. Each of the misshapen but lovingly-made mugs had their initials on the side in different colored glitter. It was hilariously garish and
Laura hummed and knelt by her, watching her work. Her sleeves were rolled up to her elbows and she smelled of sweet tea and cake. The scent filled her with comfort and made her eyelids heavy.
take the hit,” one of the others, a young woman called Aneka he believed, muttered, before lowering her head deferentially when Okoye shot her a withering look.
He shrugged and sat back completely and Toni let him go. “S’just,” he said, rubbing his eyes, “my mom was really sad. She didn’t say anything but I heard her crying in her room a few times. When you came she cried less. Now she smiles more and you guys talk about the Accords and-” Cooper shrugged, expression heartbreakingly young and open. “I think she was lonely n’ even though she was mad at you too you keep her company.”
Her fingers massaged a sore spot above her sternum. “But what if...what if the pieces just don’t fit? And the things that were holding it together have weakened so much that… Or what if,” she continued, her voice softening, “what if there was one problem all along. A runaway cog that threw everything else out of whack. Something that...something that needs to be replaced?”
Bucky turned; Steve’s eyes were only a little concerned and the edges of his mouth curled upwards reassuringly.
them. Sometimes you do it without even trying.” She gestured idly to the dryer but Toni couldn’t help but wonder whether they were talking about the Accords or...all the rest of it.
“What’s that you’re working on?” Kamala asked from where she was playing tic-tac-toe with Butterfingers.
was a little bit unfortunate, and Toni tried to ignore the sting of rejection at the fact that clearly, Shuri wasn’t her biggest fan.
“FRIDAY, babe. Am I having a heart attack?” she asked breathlessly, pinching a rather painful point of muscle just below her collar bones.
But this wasn’t public. She had no reason to do this. There was nothing to be gained, none that he could think of. She already seemed to have T’Challa’s trust and the two were making great headway with the Accords so he doubted there was anything in that arena that could possibly benefit her. He supposed that if the appeal for him to join the Avengers after his pardon went through then at least she wouldn’t have to worry about him going crazy in the field and trying to kill teammate and enemy alike but even that felt like stretching it.
The inability to sleep the first night, Toni had been informed, wasn’t exclusive to her. There was something about letting yourself be vulnerable in a different bed, much less a different house in a different state in what felt like a completely different country. And sleep was perhaps the most vulnerable that she could ever be. It took her a while to get used to most new beds and the guestroom’s queen was no exception, notwithstanding that she’d slept in it before.
flinch as she threw her tiny soldering iron to the ground, grabbed something that looked like a knife with a laser and dug it into his arm, flicking the still-smoking panel up with ease, then flinging it violently to the side, narrowly missing one of the many other machines in her workshop.
But the most telling, the easiest thing to read on the canvas of her face was the sheer devastation whenever the phone rang and she’d run to pick it up only for it to not be whom she wanted it to be.
close to dismissive if not for the tremor of her lower lip. “Don’t you worry, Cap. You remember your access codes, don’t you? If I so much as
Rhodey called for them not long after and finally it was really time for Toni to leave. Having Rhodey and Vision here, though, made the event a little less terrible than if she’d had to drive all the way back alone.
“Five times out of seven,” he joked, then his expression became serious and, if she was reading it right, almost
“Show me everything, KAREN,” she hastened, shaking her head of the memories, as if she could rattle them right out of her skull. “Everything Peter’s been up to. All his missions and small jobs. I wanna know it all.”
It was just a metal arm. A profound and brilliant piece of technology that they had used to violate him, mutilate him,
“Nah, I got a scholarship and full board. Wrote ‘em a history essay when I saw the brochure in my school’s staff room. Ma was happy for me. Relieved too, I think, now that she doesn’t have to worry about me making pipe bombs in the garage.”
intent to make himself known to her when she knew he so easily could’ve opted to take her by surprise if he wanted to.
He hesitated, then pulled back so he could look at her with serious, swollen, red-rimmed eyes. “M’not taking sides.”
Just before the door closed he glanced back one more time to see Stark’s drawn and weary expression. A hunted animal too used to being beaten down. She was small. So impossibly small.
Nat never really suspected Toni would have a soft spot for the younger generation. Harley Keener, what little Toni had deigned to reveal about him, was supposedly a hilarious smart alec that Toni kept in touch with and even went to see on his birthdays. Nat thought that was as far as her inclination towards children would ever extend.
The others lingered awkwardly. Bucky made an aborted move to touch the metal shoulder cap then dropped his flesh hand, letting it fall to his waist where he clenched the material of his white t-shirt. Clint leaned against the fridge with his arms crossed, looking away and Wanda’s gaze darted nervously between Steve and Clint and Vision, who had proceeded to clean up the empty mugs and plates Steve hadn’t even noticed on the counter. Nat’s lips were turned down in a grimace, her stance tense.
So then there was B.A.R.F.. And Shuri. And Vision. And hours upon hours in Toni’s lab, which she’d had to extend and partition off just to hold the machine the size of fucking Alaska. It wasn’t just one machine, though. It
He was almost grateful when she walked around him, giving his entire body a wide berth as she made her way to the exit, so that she wouldn’t have to see him physically
Clint tried to be discreet as he rolled his eyes but he mustn’t have been cautious enough if Ayo’s unimpressed glower was anything to go by.
Helen’s eyes crinkled in a smile. “We keep working together and one day we might actually be able to regrow his entire arm.”
When Nat finally set the jet down on the Compound’s landing pad at four in the morning on a Saturday, Vision was already waiting for her. Seeing as their relationship consistently maintained a certain level of distance and professionalism in equal amounts, the fact that he was witness to her return was unexpected to say the least.
Toni felt her face heat up. “Has anyone ever told you how nice your voice is? I mean is that a kingly thing, because I’m a girl at heart and being a princess has always been a dream of mine. Are you taken?”
Vision closed his eyes and his world narrowed down to one point, a single pixel of white. It was a mere flicker in a world, a universe of light and sound, of movement and erratic channels. It was three minutes. And it was all he needed.
“It is very good to see you again,” he said kindly. “I am...glad that you are looking better than when we last parted.”
to stay with Laura. Didn’t even really know how that happened but it did. She’d wanted to go...anywhere. Maybe out west? Maybe one of her dad’s cabins up north near the border.
Toni kept her promise and didn’t sneak away to her piece of junk car before her time was up. No one mentioned Toni’s swollen eyes or the fact that she didn’t look like she’d gotten a lick of sleep the night before - she’d managed maybe an hour or two at most, her mind too geared up in its ruminations.
“You really don’t, do you?” she murmured, as if to herself, and Toni had the strangest urge to reach out and pat her shoulder.
“And us?” she asked, that same hesitation bouncing in the tremor of her voice. “How hard’s it gonna be for us to get back to where we’re good?”
Steve read through his contract once, twice, then went through it again more slowly this time, with a fine-tooth comb. He recognized that a lot of the issues he might have had about these contracts, specifically pertaining to him, had been circumvented in one way or another. It wasn’t perfect and he still made his own amendments here and there, but like the revised draft of the Accords, there were things he could stand by.
The fact that they had the Council and the country reps listening to every word - and ol’ Thaddy looked ready to bust a spleen - showed her just how much they had it handled. There were looks, of course. Looks that asked, where did all these extra amendments come from? Who made them? More than half of said looks were aimed at T’Challa, who weathered it all with enviable impassiveness.
Bucky watched Steve too. In the nine months they’d been there, Wakanda had become a refuge and the Compound something hostile and unknown. He saw it in the broadness of Steve’s back and the tense line of his spine. He saw it in the clench of his jaw and the
T’Challa held up a hand, something Toni idly suspected was part of his royal training to get his counsellors chill the fuck out, but his eyes never left Toni, who stared back, too silently overwhelmed to think of a question or add anything conducive.
In response Peter shot a tiny web out of his wrist that Harley caught with his free hand. He examined the sticky substance between his fingers.
has been thrown around. Kamala’s the good one, though. Polite and shy. I think even Agent Hill has a soft spot for her.” Agent Fern hesitated once more looking at him sidelong. “If...you don’t mind me saying, sir. Just a word of advice. I’m looking at this as an objective outsider but they’re great kids. And they’re...protective over Ms. Stark and she of them. I mean just last week Mr. Keener nearly broke his arm when he slipped while one of ours was trying to demonstrate a shoulder lock on him. Ms. Stark laid into that recruit so bad we all thought he was gonna piss himself. She apologized later, but still. It was quite the show.”
, I think I lost at least ten years of my life tonight. And- oh crap, you aunt doesn’t even know where you are, she’s going to be shitting bricks-!”
Clint didn’t have anything to say to that because it was an age-old debate that he’d never given much heed because during his entire career with SHIELD and the Avengers, the lines had been
It was funny how just the night before they were all gathered in the same room smiling and tonight the atmosphere had done about a ninety-degree turn. They were gathered late into the night, dark circles, five o'clock shadows and black coffee their intimate friends. Vision was the only one who looked exactly the same but he’d taken to standing up abruptly and taking a turn around the room. If it was anyone else she might have called it pacing. Peter and Kamala were lounging on one of the couches talking sleepily - she wondered what excuses they’d given their respective guardians this time - and Harley was slumped between them with his hood over his eyes while Shuri sat on the floor against his legs, scribbling things out on her tablet.
In the moment of silence that followed, her sadness was almost palpable and not for the first time Vision wondered whether in addition to manipulating others’ emotions, she could also project her own. Or whether that was simply a byproduct of their connection with the Mind Stone.
There was anxiety, a healthy dose of it. But there was...anticipation, apprehension, excitement and something that he thought might have been premature relief.
She remembered...Rhodey’s legs had gotten tired so he’d finally sat down on one of the sofas. Wilson had been standing by the door one minute and sitting by Rhodey the next. At first neither had spoken. And next she knew, Wilson had shook his head, staring down at Rhodey’s legs.
His heart might have skipped a beat - or several - when she clasped his hand in hers while the other smoothed back his hair. That felt really nice. It felt familiar, like she’d done it before. Something about a Black Panther and a car and a memory behind a veneer of pain and confusion.
and Toni was painfully reminded of his father. Lila had practically declared Toni her best friend in everything from space movies - Toni’s favorite - to makeup videos - Toni’s second favorite. And the girl was fucking
“I remember everything,” he began finally. “Every single thing that has ever happened, everything that I’ve seen, everything that I’ve ever read. Down to the smallest details. But that day in New York…” She didn’t even need to ask: she knew
“So things are going to have to come out in the open at some point because I’m not going to be able to follow someone who doesn’t have my back and who won’t trust me to have hers.”
“I do not know,” T’Challa informed them heavily, “when they intend to release a statement, nor what it will entail. I was not privy to that string of emails. But apparently once we had sent President Ellis and the Council our formal statements, they got through Captain Rogers’ one very rapidly. As well as,” he added slowly, “Sergeant Barnes’.”
As well as a million unsaid things, a grief that went arc reactor-deep, a letter and a flip phone and a
Ellis’ lips twitched minutely and he took in a slow, thoughtful breath. “I know what you’re here to talk about.” That didn’t come as a surprise to either of them. “Do you know how many pardons I’ve issued in my time as president?” He shrugged and leaned back in his seat. “Zero. And now you want me to issue
“Hello, Mrs. Barton,” a female voice said suddenly and Laura choked on a shriek, jumping back and knocking her head on the wall.
Natasha agreed immediately, but Toni saw her finger twitch against the armrest of her chair in a nervous tic. “Sure. Whatever you need.”
The smile she received told her just how stupid her argument was because of course Laura would know about JARVIS and FRIDAY. They were famous. People even tried -
know that it’s taken a hell of a lot out of you, though. That it still is. That maybe it will keep taking for a long time. But I also know that what you’re doing for him is...admirable. Wonderful. Not just for him but for you as well.” She shrugged again. “I think you may be creating something beautiful and precious out of fear and chaos. You just...might not see it for a while.”
“That is not for you to decide,” he said at last as the wheels met the sand and the feds jumped out of the way of his honest-to-god reckless driving. “And maybe you should’ve listened to me or maybe this is exactly what was meant to happen for both of you to come to an understanding of how this life, how Avenging, works.” He stopped the car and took her hand before she could jump out, surveying her with intense, dark eyes. “You made a choice but so did he. And the choices of children, I’ve come to realize, lend a unique insight not only into their thought processes and the morals that drive them, but into our own as well.”
Toni’s arm automatically tightened around Vision’s. She remembered how she’d found him, digging himself out of the hole that Wanda had put him in, and her heart clenched painfully. Because Vision may not have been hers. But he also kind of was.
Instead, it was Barnes whom she couldn’t help but focus on. It was Barnes, who lay there on the operating bed with one arm and the other a gaping mess. It was Barnes, who looked pale against the sleek lines of the operating bed, whose eyes were closed and who had a tube inserted down his throat, Barnes who was linked up to an array of drips and IVs and who was undergoing one of the most revolutionary surgeries of the decade.
- the exact moment she must have spotted him for even from a distance; he saw the way her entire body seemed to freeze before she staggered backwards one, two steps. As if she’d been struck. As if the very sight of him there was physically just
“It’s cold,” she stuttered and Rhodey wordlessly took off his jacket and handed it to Vision who helped her put in on. “It’s not just me, right?”
“Well,” she began, setting her tablet down and leaning forward. “I’m all for new additions to the dream team. But your resume is a little…”
“So with the fate of the world in the balance. With the love that you have for your countries, for your
“Totally. That’s how it works, right?” She gestured vaguely, which was hard to do because T’Challa didn’t seem in a hurry to give her hands back. Maybe he was worried she was about to literally fly off the handle or run away. It wouldn’t be the first time. “Democracy and…everything.”
she thought, with a wave of indignation. A second after that she was being gently hauled in and found herself enveloped in his arms, her face pressed into the warmth of his chest.
Toni never told Rhodey, or anyone for that matter, how many times she’d replayed her suit’s footage of his fall. How many times she’d forced herself to watch her best friend, her platonic life partner, drop thousands of feet from the sky. She never told him how it never got easier, how she could never remove herself from the situation and reconcile it with the fact that Rhodey was alive, that he was still here.
The numbers in the tiny black screen of the oven told her it was five minutes past four in the morning. She blinked at it slowly, feeling awareness come back to her in tiny nudges on the corners of her conscience. How long she’d been sitting there she didn’t know yet; she could barely recall what happened after Cap...Rogers...
For Steve it had been wake up early, run, exercise, train with the Dora, accompany the Dora on border patrol, get back to their apartments, train some more, make dinner, sleep and do it all over again the next day.
“And the arm,” he said, and swallowed thickly, watching the 3D rendition of his one-armed torso rotate mid-air. “I’ll be awake for that?”
Laura did not in a million years ever expect to see Toni Stark standing in her doorway. A thousand emotions sprung forth from the dam in her chest - surprise, anger, indignation, grief - but Laura had developed ADX-level defences ever since she decided to say ‘yes’ to a date with Clint so control came almost second nature. Even though right now she wanted to either scream or slam the door in the other woman’s face.
“Open and close your fingers?” she murmured softly, her eyes cataloguing every movement as he complied, marveling at the feeling of control even if it was without the physical sensation. Then she twisted her head over her shoulder and looked at Vision, who analyzed the readings then nodded, his own smile spreading across his face.
“You’re letting her stay?” Vision asked calmly as he fitted one of the panels of the holo-emitter, one of the newer components for B.A.R.F., into place. He gave no indication of his own thoughts on their first returnee, and Toni didn’t expect him to.
the way they worked around the lab, like she and Vision had a connection that went beyond words. It was even stronger with Colonel Rhodes in a way that spoke of years of friendship and intimacy.
He looked at Toni, her spine ramrod straight as she stood by Bucky’s bed, her hands clasped tightly in front of her.
The twittering of lights translated itself to AI laughter and Toni basked in the nostalgia of it as the first of Peter’s first person recording was brought up. She settled in the chair and just watched.
She said it so seriously that Bucky felt almost obliged to believe her, to trust her hands and her skills when all he knew of doctors was the cold metal of a chair and an excruciating, electric pressure against his skull.
“I’ll have legal draw up the paperwork for a presidential pardon. Toni and Rhodey are meeting with Ellis in a few weeks to discuss this whole...” Toni felt Pepper’s gaze on her. “
There was a subtle roaring on the other side, like the loud hum of a highway. He wondered where she was going. To town, maybe? Food shopping? Maybe to visit some friends or drop some of her harvest off at the farmer’s market.
“I know,” he murmured miserably, wiping a hand down his face and expelling a harsh breath and never feeling more
Rhodey grimaced, humming lowly in the back of his throat. “Ain’t fair. Never will be. But you did it; you, Vision and Hope and Shuri. Team Awesome. Brought her back to life a couple of times from what Vision tells me.”
“I’m sorry,” she said at last, sounding so deeply genuine, like she understood, and Toni thought that maybe she really did. Toni nodded, unable to bring herself to answer, her throat too tight for her to speak. “Why haven’t you told anyone?”
“She let me in. I was half expecting her to kick me out on my ass. I’d have deserved it. She misses you by the way. I have a line I use to call her and the kids sometimes. Totally secure. You can borrow it. Gave one of my magical phones to Barton but last I heard he’s being a little bitch. Nothing new there but you’d think his
“I do not think that my father envisioned something quite so expansive. Nor do I think he realized the impact the Accords would have on the world.” He pinned the three of them with a long look that was somewhere between pity and regret. “We made mistakes the first time and perhaps extenuating circumstances exacerbated the issue beyond what we could have imagined.”
Toni always felt like shit whenever it happened, and crept back upstairs or outside or just anywhere
Jarvis had once said something along those lines. Whereas Ana had told her to keep the important things so that you wouldn’t always be looking for new ways to smile.
She smiled, blunt and professional, and held a hand out for him to shake. “Agent Fern, Captain. Pleasure to finally meet you.”
Toni looked up and nearly staggered in shock, gasping, only vaguely aware of the litany of words escaping her. “Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god-”
“For someone who is doing so much to see her friends regain their freedom, you are strangely silent on their current welfare.” He tilted his head to the side, scrutinizing. “You have not asked after them. Why?”
Bucky nodded jerkily then stood, feeling off-balance and unsteady in a way that was more mental than physical.
“We’ll be breaking for lunch soon,” Natasha muttered. “Thaddeus Ross is gonna be on a warpath to get to you. Get it together by then, Stark.”
“Don’t be dense. Toni Stark has been very vocal about your friends’ detainments without trials. You would get a trial. And if not you would find some way to keep your friends safe while being a vigilante as a huge gesture of defiance to the world.” She looked down her nose at him despite being slightly shorter. “It wouldn’t be the first time.”
Toni couldn’t say she had. But she had seen the personification of it before. She wondered if it was as upsetting. She expected Shuri’s image was even more so.
, she loved the female race, and if her respect for T’Challa and all things Wakandan wasn’t already at its highest, they’d just managed to surpass it even more.
me.” She grimaced and the hole in her chest felt ice cold. “But a lot of it was. So I need to fix what I can because if I don’t- And when that battle comes and we’re not ready… I couldn’t live with myself if I had the chance to fix things and I didn’t. So yeah. I’m not doing this for them. This is bigger than me and them.
T’Challa nodded solemnly but there was an edge of excitement bubbling beneath the surface of his skin, like conviction, like
The young newscaster was in the way and Steve had the absurd urge to stick his hand through the screen and shove the man aside just so he could get a closer glimpse of Toni in the background as she stood facing the new guy.
He knew Sam was right, but it didn’t stop from feeling like a punch to the gut. His mistakes were heavy collars that kept slotting themselves around his neck, one by one and dragging his face closer to the dirt.
And while he didn’t expect Spider-Man to be present and figured Rhodey didn’t have much of a reason to witness the surgery, Nat’s absence was...disappointing, and left an unsteady, bitter feeling in his chest.
It was such a simple, clean-cut answer. And the higher brow media had certainly spun it that way, making sweeping mentions of the lifelong - and afterlife-long apparently - friendship between Rogers and Barnes that ultimately made Rogers’ choice for him. The trashier newsfeeds wrote essays dedicated to the greatest love triangle the modern world had ever seen, and it was frankly disturbing that they seemed to be closer to the truth.
Steve looked over his shoulder and found T’Challa walking towards him, Shuri an ever-present shadow behind him. She was quicker to smile than her brother and when she did there was an innocence that made Steve feel older than he already was. And she was smart,
, and a sharp pain lanced through her chest, making her breath catch. Her hand made an aborted grab at the arc reactor but she managed to alter its course and tucked her hair behind her ear instead. Judging by the near imperceptible narrowing of his eyes he noticed anyway.
That night Toni didn’t dream of snow. There was no sound of breaking glass, no wind blowing in her ears, no roar of fury. She didn’t dream of a desert either, or of a cave. She didn’t dream of Rhodey falling or of her hand just out of reach. She didn’t dream of a wormhole and an army. The names of all the dead Sokovians weren’t a constant mantra being whispered into her ear in a voice that sounded like Ultron’s, their faces screaming and asking her why, why,
Wanda lifted one shoulder in a shrug but there was a coldness in her eyes, a suspiciousness and dislike that she always failed to hide whenever Toni came up.
Toni hummed, feeling a smile curling at the corner of her lips as she took in Strange’s speculative look at Peter. Good old Peter and his delightfully nerdy ways.
“They’ll be real happy to know it works.” Toni lingered there awkwardly, feeling a little flustered, before taking a step back. “Anyways. I should let you get back to teaching and I’ve got something cooking in the lab, so. Catch you later?”
went unsaid. For a long moment an uncomfortable silence pervaded the lab and Bucky could picture Steve’s grim expression without even having to look.
, her expression trying so hard to be open and yet suspicion evident in the drop of her shoulders and the almost defiant jut of her jaw.
“Huh. That’s funny. Knew a dinosaur once who liked to give as good as he got.” Her smirk was knife-sharp and her green eyes glinted in the golden light of the hanging lamps. “Don’t tell me Wakanda has made you soft, Steve.”
“Toni.” It was softer this time and Toni could’ve given in. She really could have because it sounded exactly like the woman she used to know. But a very large and very hurt part of her was also
, and admire her from a lateral distance and try not to step on her toes. Teenagers were fucking scary. Princesses doubly so.
“Why don’t we discuss this further over dinner?” T’Challa interjected before they could all start talking again. “It has been a long trip and Shuri was telling me she was very much in the mood for that burger place you took us to last time.”
Her eyes were drawn to the corner of the room, where an unfinished suit of red and slate blue-gray was draped across a table.
And in the morning Rhodey wouldn’t mention the dark circles under her eyes or the mess of her hair and her unwashed t-shirt. He’d simply push a mug of coffee and a glass of cold-press juice in front of her and dive right into his ideas of a potential prosthetics line for veterans.
“Okay,” he said, and Stark watched him for several more seconds before looking back down at her tablet.
“I can’t wait,” she whispered, then caught sight of the HR lady’s irate glare and cleared her throat. “You’ll be right here?”
Fingers pressing into her pulsing orbital bone, she let herself settle for a few short seconds before sitting up straight.
“Awesome,” Toni said distractedly, fiddling with the monitor for one more moment before stepping back. “FRIDAY, we got an uplink?”
however…” He thought about Toni in the suit, about the cars that had been so ruthlessly thrown on top of her, of the pain that he knew still made itself known in her arm. In her mind. He turned around and met Wanda’s eyes that were wide and glistening with unshed tears. “Humans are so very fragile. Both physically and mentally against the right opponent.”
Today she felt like she was staring into a wormhole in the sky, her world consumed by black and cold,
stop them from trying to help. You need help with anything and you ask either myself or any of the other guys or even better, ask FRIDAY because she’s smarter than everybody.”
She continued to work, her body quickly re-adapting to the admittedly absurd hours it used to be put through. It was cathartic in a way, like an internal clock being reset and her limbs sinking into a familiar sort of ache. The perpetual fatigue even helped her to sleep a little better, a little deeper, and she took the time to appreciate the blessing while it lasted.
But after Bucky had passed him the document he’d been...surprised. Doubtful. Suspicious. A lot of it still filled him with indignation and he recognized the blunt and matter-of-fact style that Shanthi McMahon was known for.
Toni didn’t even answer, just started rattling off everything FRIDAY’s scans had already informed them and refused to leave Peter’s side as they raced to the Avenger’s infirmary, even though she looked almost as dead on her feet as Peter did.
“And who’s that? SHIELD employs quite a large number of intelligent people.” Coulson remarked loftily and the man snorted disbelievingly, sitting back in his seat.
“They’re still bitter over the whole Suez Crisis,” Natasha supplied in an undertone and Toni tilted her head from side to side. “Understandably so. They’ve been taken advantage of more than once by foreign nations.”
“More like there’s a black hole between the time you disappeared off the face of the Earth and turned up during that very bizarre incident in Hong Kong.” She pinned him with an unflinching look. “Care to enlighten us on what happened in between?”
After a moment her expression hardened, her gaze darting quickly from the arm to the 3D chart she had conjured up to her right.
Almost immediately, the orange glow died and the both of them watched and waited, neither one daring to breathe.
“FRIDAY’s showing life signs on levels sixteen through thirty of Roxxon. Huge cluster on the top three floors; I see the hostages. There’s a stairwell on the west corner that gives you a free access until the fourteenth floor. After that use the elevator shaft. Spider-Man, there’s a collapsed stairwell on level eight blocking escape in your building.”
“Yeah, would’ve been nice to have the whole gang here,” Hope mused, then continued in the steadiest tone of voice, “I owe you an apology.”
Stark’s smile widened, cold and cruel but her eyes were tight around the edges, belying some complicated conflict of emotion that Bucky couldn’t hope to unpack.
“Remove your hands from her,” he said, and Toomes let go, the police immediately grabbing his wrists and re-cuffing them behind his back.
Natasha didn’t smile but her eyes softened mildly. “After Toni submitted her first appeal she got in touch with her. She was huge in coordinating with the CSRE in Sokovia a few months ago. The city has a lot to get through before it’s inhabitable but...it’s a start.”
Harley was quiet for a moment before muttering, “I may or may not have appropriated it from one of the passed-out douchebags who’d been a racist dick to Kamala earlier at the party.”
Natasha glared at the door when Ross gave another shout, then turned back to Toni, something fierce,
Rogers and his stupid letter and his stupid phone. She’d done the same thing and left Rhodey and Pepper and Happy and Vision a fucking
Whatever he did, she couldn’t help the heavy sigh of relief when she heard the sound of his boots as they made their way away from her, followed by the decisive
“Sorry,” she murmured after a time. “I’m being self-absorbed and fatalistic. I tend to make things about me. It’s a character flaw.”
Rhodey’s words rang in his ears. There was no such thing as a new team or an old team. A part of him had felt, after seeing this group, headed by War Machine and an unrecognizable Toni, almost lost.
There were reassuring whispers in her ear and soft hands removing the baby weight from her arms, and then she was running and skidding across gravel and grass and falling to her knees just as she threw herself into a pair of open arms.
here, Steve. We’re trying to give people like us a future where we’re not terrifying to the world. Where people aren’t going to try and control us.” When he opened his mouth to argue, she talked right over him. “Toni was right about this happening
Dummy powered to life and rolled out of his charging station, weaving in and out between tables and benches and haphazard machinery to greet Vision. He beeped several times and made a few circuits around his legs before stopping and beeping some more.
“It doesn’t hurt,” he whispered, and she pretended not to notice the way his eyes glistened just a little more than a few moments ago. “It feels…” His voice cracked at the last word and he had to clear his throat, staring at his palms the way Rhodey had stared at his legs the first time he had walked by himself. “It feels like before.”
. Somehow he hadn’t expected her to and yet it hurt like a lance through his chest. “You sign them and you get your sorry ass back to your
“Steve.” He glanced up and Natasha stood next to him, her hands in her back pocket. It felt surreal, seeing her here, having her here with them, a link to the others, a link to a recent past where everything was going right until it wasn’t. Looking at her he could almost reach out and grab it, take it back, take it all back and just
into becoming the infamous Winter Soldier. A man traumatized and mutilated and violated and turned into a weapon. And he’s a man who Captain America himself defied all odds to save. Why?” Toni’s eyes were flinty and Natasha couldn’t decide whether this was because she hated the fact that she had to say these words or for some other reason entirely. “Because he
She tossed the phone in front of her just as Vision sat down next to her and gave her a warm mug of hot chocolate. She’d told Vision about what had happened in Siberia. She couldn’t tell Rhodey yet. Maybe ever. That was a lie, he had to hear it from her at some point. But the words weren’t coming out of her mouth any time soon and Rhodey had honed a level of patience over his many years of dealing with her and knew when and when not to push.
“They are not exactly in the best position to be making grand changes,” he chided, “but they do not, as you seem to believe, sit around and do nothing. The Captain trains with the Dora. As does Mr. Wilson and Mr. Barton. They learn about our culture and they help where they can. They help protect our borders from…unsavory people. Mr Barton even has a small following of children and young people who are eager to learn archery. Ms. Maximoff helps in the orphanage and Mr. Lang has taken up a temporary teaching post at a high school.” Through the entire speech Toni just found her shoulders getting heavier and heavier. “They are doing what they can, Ms. Stark, within the limited capacity that their situation has given them. But they do want to come home. They are still healing from the loss of it.”
When T’Challa raised his head from the dense paperwork in front of him his eyes were suspiciously shiny, and Toni felt her ears burn self-consciously.
Bucky stilled, staring at the woman, his gaze sliding to the door behind her and the hallway that led to the operating theatre that was apparently one of the more recent additions to the Compound.
“I have witnessed you do multiple inadvisable things. In fact your entire life appears to be a series of inadvisable acts and decisions-”
And as Doctor Cho finished her presentation and began explaining how he needed to prep for the surgery, Bucky found his gaze wandering once more to Antonia Stark’s diligently working form, imagining what other goals she might have set and just how many of them he was central to.
When he jerkily turned to look at Stark, she was sat there glaring at the skeleton of his arm, breathing in and out of her nose, and Bucky could see the fingers of one hand digging into her thighs while the other tapped incessantly on the metal slat next to his unmoving fingers.
a good woman, Antonia Stark. Regardless of how you see yourself. Regardless of what others have said or how they perceive you to be. So I will be whatever you need to see this to the end. And I know that it will be glorious.”
“I love it,” she’d cried, holding the plain black outfit out in front of her. “Oh my gosh, I love it! Thank you so much, thank you, I can’t- I can’t believe you made- Does this mean I can be an Avenger one day? Because that would be awesome and I wanna be like you guys and help save people and- Guys, this is just so cool! Now I just need a hero name!” She proceeded to cry and threw her arms around a rigid Hope’s waist first and then around Toni, who awkwardly patted her on the back. Then she ran off declaring that she was going to try it on and that everyone had to stay where they were.
“If it will help, I will confront Shuri about her unnecessary interventions and enlisting your aid when you are already stretched thin with your responsibilities.”
She inhaled deeply, held the breath and looked straight ahead where Ellis was sat, expressionless as ever.
, if I have to. I just...I just need some time. But I promise you I’m going to make everything better. You’ll see.”
Van Dyne nodded and clasped her hands behind her back, composing herself with an ease that Nat was almost proud of.
She nodded vaguely, squinting at the inky black for any more celestial events. The Leonids should be causing quite a show over the next couple of days. The kids might like to see that, she thought idly.
For someone who couldn’t help himself when it came to defying authority and standing in the middle of chaos of his own making, Steve seemed to covet structure and taking orders.
And with that needling little voice that sounded strangely like his own came the deluge of images and pained accusations, the whirring of a repulsor, the screech of metal and the clang of vibranium against something both indestructible and fragile.
as a kid, and it was what her mother had given her whenever she could. And it was always freely given by Ana and Jarvis and Aunt Peggy and sometimes even Uncle Dan, the few times he came to visit. “I think you’re perfect and a good teacher would never let the fact that a student doesn’t
It was beautiful and so, so different from what HYDRA had forced on him. There was a sleekness to it, the grooves between each panel thinner so that it would look like seamless metal from afar.
Several emails were sent out with tentative meeting dates. The Accords were still in the first stages of amendments but it was getting on. She still needed to vet it past Rhodey, Pepper and Vision before it would be anywhere near submission-worthy, but it was going to happen. She was going to
“The stuff’s all contained,” he panted, like he was running. “There’s some dude tied up but no sign of Spider-Man-”

that crept out of the ground and wrapped itself between the rungs of her ribs. Because Clint had left. Then he hadn’t called. And Laura deserved
“I’m putting myself in charge of the Avengers Multi-Organizational Task Force since the last head decided to fuck off after Cap left.”
Shuri, Vision and Natasha had been waiting outside with a biodbed when Maria’s black Land Rover screeched across the lawn, narrowly missing a water feature that Toni had been complaining to Natasha about getting rid of, before it came to a halt in front of them.
Then she went back into the house, past the kitchen and into the spare bathroom, sat down on the toilet seat and buried her face in her hands to cry.
The next morning she emailed him everything she had on B.A.R.F., even though she nearly threw up several times before she gave an unwilling FRIDAY the green light.
“As for your arm.” She paused and he resisted the urge to reach up and grasp his stump of a shoulder. “Vision and I have constructed the parts for a new one.
What wasn’t, though, was how Toni, after she and Shuri spent the better part of two hours fixing the boy - Peter Parker - up and working around the spider venom in his blood, she refused to leave the room and had elected to sit right by his bed just watching him and “monitoring his vitals” even though FRIDAY could’ve done it for her.
Then she pressed a warm, lingering kiss to her forehead and Toni closed her eyes, savoring the moment.
Once the dishes were done, Toni brought her bag downstairs and they all trudged outside. It was all very doom and gloom and a part of her felt like she was going to her death, so she pressed her nose into Nathaniel’s downy hair and inhaled deeply to ground herself.
“And eight more countries ratified the Accords just this week,” Vision supplied with a nod that could only be described as proud. “We are, as they say, making very good headway.”
“What would you have me do, FRIDAY?” he asked and reached out to gently stroke Dummy’s camera unit in an attempt to ease the poor bot.
“What are you saying?” she asked, staring at all their faces; some looked grave, others resigned, some looked regretful while others remained stoic and cold.
He sighed as he watched the sun come up over the forest, illuminating the trees in brilliant gold and deepening the shadows behind in inky black.
chosen Vision instead. And she might’ve had she known of Vision’s stealth mode capabilities because some of the shit that Peter got up to was enough to give her twelve heart attacks and a fucking aneurysm.
“What the hell are you even doing in New York? Where’s your mother?” she asked as they carried Kamala into one of the elevators. “Goddamnit, I need a damn travelator in this fucking place.”
to create, to build or invent. It was artistry in its own way, addictive and more times than not obsessively and darkly so.
Peter gave him the stink-eye and folded his arms, even as he kept darting a cautious gaze at the girl who was currently whimpering.

“My scans are showing multiple cracked ribs and a broken femur. There seems to be some damage to his back, indicative of him falling from a great height or something falling on
Natasha frowned because she’d heard the speech front to back, left to right, up and down a dozen times and she’d never strayed from the script.
When she moved to shake his hand, he took hers gently in both of his and squeezed with a familiarity that threw her. This wasn’t a standard Wakandan greeting, she knew.
I don't know when the next chapter will be posted so I'm not going to make any promises at this stage, but I shall do my absolute best.
had to be that person and it might as well be her - she tilted her head in the direction of Toni’s breast pocket, and she caught Toni’s fingers flex dangerously. It reminded her curiously of Wanda.
the injury. Whatever will is either off-world or hasn’t been invented yet. One day, though.” Unlike before there was a little spark in the good doctor’s eyes. “We’re so close I can feel it.”
when he continued. “It would not suit you. Too much...sitting around and reading up on foreign policy and such.”
“Did she, now?” she said slowly, and it only seemed to deepen the lines around his eyes. FRIDAY was always a sucker for a smooth-talker. “That’s convenient. Well, then. I suppose you’ll be hearing from us. Do you need a ride back to the city?”
Being in Rhodey’s bad books never ended well for anyone and something uncomfortable stirred inside of his chest, some gnarled, twisted thing that whispered in his ear.
They glared at each other for a long moment and with that stubborn set to her jaw Toni was so damn sure that Natasha was going to add something more, just to have the final word.
“Y’don’t need it,” Steve reassured him, meeting Toni’s eyes for the briefest moment before she busied herself with some machine and that claw in his chest only squeezed tighter. “Like Shuri said, you’re in safe hands.”
“Only one of those options sounds likely.” His throat felt tight and the knuckles of his fist were white from gripping the edge of the table. “How?” he asked, and his voice came out so cracked and desperate that he didn’t recognize the sound emanating from his mouth. “How do I fix this, Nat?”
None of the shit that happened over the course of the DMMMACE(s) could be described as remotely close to the caliber of shit that hit the fan as the other shitty incidents but the fact that they just
Between the loud music and packed dance floor and Vision’s human disguise, they’d bought themselves enough anonymity, at least for a couple of hours.
“I love you,” she blurted and there was a very long, very uncomfortable length of silence where she’d somehow managed to render the Black Panther and the king of Wakanda speechless. When he finally opened his mouth to speak she spoke over him again. “Pepper says I need to work on it. Telling my friends and the people around me how I feel. Specifically telling people how I feel about
Toni slung an arm around his shoulders and squeezed and Harley willingly leaned into the half-embrace.
“Yeah,” she said, squeezing Peter’s fingers and smiling up at him, mustering as much reassurance from the bare reserves of her bones as she could. “Yeah, I’m okay.”
away towards what looked like a control panel just as Stark stood up abruptly, her hair looking fluffier and messier than it had been the day before.
He came around to perch on the edge of her work table, trying not to make his disapproval at her evidently sleep-deprived state so obvious.

He’d walked towards Wanda who had been wringing her hands, eyes darting from person to person, exit to exit, panic and misery making her look pale and unhappy.
and not with the United Nations either. Playing the last one to her advantage was going to be the crucial, deciding factor in ensuring everything sorted itself out for the better. She had a vague idea of how to do that, how to prove to the UN and the still virginal Council that changes needed to be made. The Panel meant to oversee the Avengers and any other enhanced group didn’t even exist yet, but maybe she was jumping the gun a little with that. She’d need to speak to Rhodey, Pepper and her entire goddamn legal team before she could even begin to bring this shit before the UN.
Before she left, his eyes already getting heavy as she made her way to the door, she added in a soft voice that made his heart soar,
“We’re,” she began, fingering an errant thread on the frayed sleeve of her top. “We’re working on it. Too soon to tell but she doesn’t seem to mind working
She twisted to look over her shoulder, glaring as she saw them all standing there, eyeing them one by one. Her frown deepened and her shoulders rose defensively, like someone caught in an ambush.
“I like it,” he said, and there was an almost magnetic attraction between their suits from where he was touching her. Strangely enough it calmed her nerves a bit. “It suits you.”
“They would’ve had a lot to say about the Accords and their contracts,” she mused after a time and Nat felt the familiar stirrings of unease at the lack of emotion in her tone and her own inability to gauge the expression on her face.
at least, they were all united, that whose team they’d been on, whatever resentments they still held for one another, were set aside for the sake of one Bucky Barnes, whom none of them could say they knew well in any capacity, but who had been in his own way central to their fight.
Just like that the buzzing ceased and the room came back into focus, like time regurgitated the other side of a wormhole.

Cooper nodded with a thoughtful expression, so similar to Clint’s that she wondered how Laura could stand it sometimes.

“Just as we predicted. The implant is going to be a perfect fit,” Shuri said above them, projecting her own joy as warm as the sun until Toni could feel her fingers again.
Toni blinked quickly, momentarily distracted from imagining Everett Ross being dropped from a great height by Iron Man. “But Shuri and Harley

Also Stephen! I said I would and I did. Because honestly, how could I possibly leave this wonderful man out when I have so many plans for him? And after that swoon-worthy wink in IW? God, yes.

a machine. It still needs a power source which...oh, look at that. Roxxon hasn’t even built yet.” He clasped his hands on the table in front of him. “So what you’ve got, essentially, is...a piece of junk. Unless your boss can make his own, and I gotta tell you, there are very few minds in the world that are bright enough to build something like this. And last we checked, they were all accounted for.”
“If everybody’s ready,” Helen said, very voice soft but clear, nodding once at Steve, then strolling over until she stood next to Bucky’s bed, “then shall we get started?”
A plume of emotions unraveled inside of his chest, pulling his thoughts in different directions and stealing the words from his mouth.
“Yes,” she stated after a time, watching him carefully. “She knew it was for you. T’Challa told her what I was trying to do. She told him to tell me that if there was any way she could help she would be willing to. Very generous of her considering she’s the one who blew off your
Toni forced a smile and Helen’s expression never changed - she was getting surprisingly good at that.
“Oh, I don’t know. Psychoanalyze the significance of pillow forts in adolescents and list out all the ways the lack of such activity in our childhood has affected our psyche?” She shrugged nonchalantly. “Or we could watch porn and make fun of their faces.”
She remembered Stephen’s gentle hand on her arm. Something - she couldn’t remember - softly spoken. The scent of tea leaves. The scratch of his goatee as he lightly kissed her cheek and then—
“For what it’s worth from someone like me? You did real good, Peter.” She smiled. “I’m proud of you.”
“She is,” Toni replied with a cool smile, then with a flick of her wrist she brought up a small screen. It beeped twice before connecting her to Pepper.
what fucking happened. Regardless of what you think I will always have your back, out here and in the field as well but you are way too early to be asking me to place even a
When he didn’t say anything more, Toni sighed again and swiped the screen of her tablet off, then pushed to her feet.
There were murmurs of agreement and nods but Toni wasn’t one of them because she was too busy trying to ease the sharp pain that felt like shrapnel trying to work its way out of the muscle of her heart and there was a tingling sensation in her left wrist. She almost jumped right out of her seat when T’Challa placed a hand atop the one on her thigh under the table - and
She looked at him with something like wonder and swallowed thickly when he leaned in close, his expression so open and genuine and she might have fallen a little bit in love with him right then.
When she finally spoke to him it was louder and clearer, not modulated by the suit or transmitted through a television.
“How’ve you been, Vision?” she found herself asking. Because it was important. He may not have been hers, not in the way JARVIS and FRIDAY were, not in the way the bots were, but she’d had a hand in it. And she’d never be so cruel as to let him know that in the beginning she’d hoped for something else but gotten him instead.
,” Shuri added, reaching across the table and swiping to the readings that the Mark 0 had been able to take in the field. “Those gamma radiation readings are unlike anything I’ve ever seen. He generated some kind of quantum field around the explosion that blocked the energy flux from affecting the space outside of it. There’s currently no science on Earth that can explain what he’s doing. Or
Toni knew what it was like to be right on the brink of groundbreaking innovation and wanting to be the first one there, the one to introduce a new creation to the world. She’d done it before. Multiple times. And regretted it more than once. People like her and Helen and Bruce always had this
He curled his lip in distaste, glared at Natasha a final time before he practically grabbed Toni’s upper arm and stomped out of the bathroom and
“I knew,” Steve had said, so quietly, but it might as well have been a gunshot in a clearing. “I knew for two years. She...she asked me if I knew and I said yes. And then she was…” Steve closed his eyes and Bucky had wanted desperately to reach out and grip his shoulder but knew that nothing could heal this just as nothing would ever wipe away the image of Stark’s expression of utter grief and betrayal when Steve had told her, the way she had pressed her gauntleted hand to her stomach as if she would collapse with the pain of it. “And then we fought.”
Her hair was frizzy, the curls unwound, and they would have fallen in haphazard cowlicks had she not tied it into a short, low ponytail. There was a small stain from a coffee splatter on her left sleeve. Dirt lodged under her nails. Small scars on her hands - burns, cuts, calluses. Some were fading, others were new.
Toni smiled. “Did you name her? If you name her it means you’ve got her for life.” She softened her voice, allowing herself to be vulnerable for a while. “You know what they say about pets.”
, something that made her sit up straighter in her chair and narrow her eyes at the usually collected woman. “
He turned around just in time to meet Rhodey’s gaze, hold it for a few beats, only for Rhodey to look away as he took his seat.
That garnered the appearance of a crack in her already thin exterior and he saw something vulnerable in the worried furrow of her brows and the slump of her shoulders

“Listen,” she said, putting his hand down. He sort of despaired at the loss. “You don’t need to make any decisions now. Just. Get some sleep and we can talk in the morning.”
“Just like how I don’t regret letting you and Bucky leave that day.” He locked gazes with her and could see nothing but deep, wounding honesty. “But I’ll regret what it cost us.”
Strange stood smoothly, straightening out his clothes. “Don’t worry about me, Ms. Stark,” he said, and she watched him perform a small, almost careless circular gesture with his hands, opening up one of those fizzing portals Agent Fern had been grumbling about. “I can see myself out. I look forward to hearing from you.” Then he nodded at Peter and Shuri, both of whom seemed too intrigued by the portal to say goodbye, and with a parting grin at her he stepped through and disappeared.
She turned to look at Sam and found him looking grimly back at her. And by some unspoken truce, Toni slipped off the stool and Sam started rolling up the sleeves of his t-shirt.
Laura’s smile dimmed. “Not all of them,” she said, and the shadow of Clint, or perhaps that absence of him, crept stretched long from the dark corners of the room. “Nate doesn’t remember him.”
This was wide and sprawling and full of machinery and glass walls that partitioned the different sections of the lab. It was bright, the lights on the circumference of the lab taking on a softer glow akin to sunlight through sheer curtains. There were screens upon screens, holo emitters, half-drawn schematics - some of them on actual paper while others were floating 3D-generated creations.

“I need you to be awake when we affix the arm,” she said, right to his face, her expression giving him no indication as to whether she was internally restraining herself from leaping across the table and strangling him -
. Just let the thoughts come, be mindful of them, and let them leave when they wanted to, without actively forcing anything.
“In the common area with the interns and Princess Shuri, who are apparently conducting an experiment to see whether or not they are capable of keeping Toni’s working hours. They were halfway through an episode of Star Trek the last I saw.”
“You don’t need to be a genius to help people, Kama Llama,” she said after a few beats, turning to face her fully. “Did someone say someth-?”
To her surprise he chuckled, a low and drawling sound that made her think of loose leaf tea on a mountaintop and old books that stained her fingers black with powdery ink. The image disappeared as soon as it came and she blinked, coming back to awareness as his laugh tapered off.
“You know you’ve never said anything bad about them in front of me?” Peter interrupted her sharply. “Ever. People say stuff. The news, the internet. But you never have. Not to me or Harley or Kamala. I’d wager not even to Shuri or Mr. Strange. And that’s—” He sucked in a breath through his teeth. “You could’ve told us what went down. What happened after Leipzig. But you haven’t. And I get it; you’ve gotta keep some things to yourself. You want all of us to be as objective as possible when we finally meet your old gang. You want us to be able to trust them. But Toni,” he implored beseechingly, “how can we trust them if you clearly don’t?”
She wrote until her fingers ached, until her neck stiffened, until the sun rose, until Laura peeked through the door that was slightly ajar, gazing in awe at the numerous screen projections floating around Toni like a halo of magic and technology.
“What do you think about us having a greenhouse? Side-project between you n’ me. For therapeutic reasons.”
He spoke a good game but Toni could hear the edge of fear in his voice and see the tense strain on his forehead and seriously, god bless the resilience of kids when it mattered.
Toni drew her strength from her friends, from the team in this room that she had rebuilt, from Hope and Stephen and the kids whom Vision was discreetly live-streaming for. She drew her strength from FRIDAY and the bots. From Pepper and Happy. And Ana and Jarvis. From her parents. From herself. From the memories of a shield over her head. From the burst of fear from a hand in her chest. She drew her strength from a nuke and a wormhole and an endless expanse of black and starlight, beautiful and terrifying.
was the only one who knew what happened after. Because she’d been alone. “I had a broken suit and a lot of bruises. I had a broken arm and a fractured tibia but that was actually from before. It just got worse after a couple of rounds with two very strong Super Soldiers. Let’s not even talk about the fact that half of my ribcage is artificial. I can show you the x-ray if you don’t believe me. I had all of that and myself. But I waited. Because I was
“If he was worth it. I need to know that the man wearing the face of my parent’s killer and the Winter Soldier, I need to know that James Buchanan Barnes was worth it.”
“Toni.” A hand reached across her and took control of the wheel. “Let me drive,” he said gently, maneuvering her with such delicate ease from the driver’s seat to the passenger seat that he’d gracefully vacated. He barely shifted the car. His seat was warm and this part of the car smelled of his cologne.
“I didn’t know your dad,” she finally said, and T’Challa met her eyes. “My dad did but, as I’m sure you’re aware, it was under some pretty shitty circumstances. So I don’t know him. But I’d like to think that I know
“You have beautiful hands,” she said, brushing her thumbs across his heart lines and admiring the length of his fingers, each one still performing good and honest work regardless of the countless times their owner must have cursed and called them useless. Before he could come up with a derisory retort, she continued. “Come with us tomorrow. To Seoul.”
He envied the others as they moved around in the observation room, and his stomach gave a quiet growl as he watched the others munch on snacks and sandwiches.
“You give yourself away far too freely, Toni.” T’Challa shook his head. “It isn’t over yet. We have much more to do. And we cannot do it without you.”
“Hey,” she began cautiously, feeling strangely guilty at having disturbed him so late Wakandan time when he could clearly have done with the sleep.
readings that Toni would have looked into at any other time but was too distracted by Shuri’s clear lack of self-preservation as she reached out to touch the cloak
He’d spent the rest of that night sitting in that dark, empty kitchen replaying their short but gutting exchange, imagining how she would’ve looked at him if he’d just said that he was
she said lowly. “When you let yourself join with the Mind Stone you obtained true humanity for the first time. You had a choice. And you chose to ignore your prime directive, the
“Tell me your plan on bringing them back,” Laura repeated, pulling Toni towards the veranda, where cold lemonade and wicker chairs were waiting for them. “I want to know. And maybe I can help.”
“It’s gonna take a while, Toni.” Then she added, so sincere and so familiar in its affection, “But he’s worth it.”
than the man currently lying unconscious on the operating table, that was her business and hers alone.
Steve didn’t know how long they just stared at one another. Compared to Wakanda the distance should have been insubstantial but Steve felt it like a cavern, like the grandest of canyons between them across which their trust and grief were stretched like raw, exposed nerves.
“After Ultron,” she began stiltedly, then sighed. “I know Vision is good and something wonderful and amazing. But I also know he could easily have been the destruction of our world had you and Bruce and Thor not stepped in. For a long time the fact that I’d made that possible made me question everything I knew about the work I was doing. Whether I was moving faster than our world was ready for. Whether I was...trying to play God.” She shook her head ruefully and Toni had to bite back the protests that were ready on the tip of her tongue. “But then you came to me with that project for Colonel Rhodes and…” She shrugged. “I slowly fell back in love with my work and with myself and I could look at Vision and see that I’d had a hand in creating something precious out of fear and chaos.”
that tasted like bile at the back of his throat and made him grimace as he pressed his thumb into the center of his palm.
Bucky saw Steve smile a little to himself before he continued to scribble on the tablet that Ayo had given him. It hadn’t exactly been the prettiest when he’d first laid the Accords down before the others. Barton was still angry and had tossed a few choice words around about how maybe they should’ve thought about this before they decided to stand up to the man, but surprisingly he’d been the first one after Sam to start reading through them, begrudgingly admitting that some of the amendments the other Avengers had made were pretty solid.
And T’Challa. She’d never seen that expression on his face, like he’d been sucker-punched in the gut but was too dignified to admit that it hurt.
Toni hissed and stood, and goddamn but in these heels she wasn’t intimidating anyone, least of all Natasha.
“When will you learn,” T’Challa began slowly, and it took her several long beats to realize that he had spoken, “that people have the right to make their own choices and are therefore bound to the consequences?”
Shuri had always been good to him, funny and whip-smart in a way that was still kind. The rest of her staff had been distant but just as professional, deferring to Shuri’s authority in a way that was empirically different to how Zola’s workers deferred to him.
that someone was going to come and get me, to help me. But nobody came.” She looked at T’Challa, feeling something like wonder emanate from inside of her. “
She tried to tell herself that leaving wasn’t losing. That it didn’t mean one less person in the world when the world had already taken everyone from her. She tried not to let it hurt, but it did. It hurt so much and it wasn’t even Laura’s fault. This whole thing was about doing good, was about bringing the people she once called family back
Even more surprising was the fact that Scott had been the one to sit with Barton and toss ideas around. Bucky wondered whether they’d bonded over the shared experience of leaving kids behind. He got a smile on his face whenever he read certain comments in the margin and would say things like,
Another day, he thought to himself, even though he still ached from the phantom blows of their encounter.
“We should bring those in,” Cooper said, nodding towards the several baskets she’d picked. “It’s getting dark soon.”
If anyone could unpack and reproduce an energy source to the exact measurements of an arc reactor it would be Wakanda’s resident genius princess.
“Toni!” T’Challa called, catching up to her as she burst out of the main door of the Compound and skidded across the gravel to the Land Rover parked on the grass. She was vaguely sure it belonged to Hill. Her new quinjets were still under construction but she had one of her small jets, the Dagger, still stationed on top of Stark Tower but it would waste too much time to get it here and then- “Toni, what can we do?” he urged, opening the door for her to jump in, but she couldn’t think, she couldn’t
“-the others will be excited to finally meet you as well. We’ll have two spiders on the team. Y’know. If you decide to join. I wouldn’t hold it against you if you didn’t. I’m a shit person but they still designated me team leader while...Well. You know.”
Nat saw it coming a second too late, something that would piss her off for the next ten goddamn years.
“More so than usual,” she said flatly, jumping over his leg. “You watched the news. Saw your old team.”
“Still wish you were here?” she asked, dropping the rod onto the metal tray and it landed with a dull clang.
But if she tried hard enough she could almost convince herself that she was doing it for herself and not for her parents’ killer.
So he clutched it close even as he walked away. He nursed it against the safest part of himself and prayed that it would grow.
We've got more Steve here and a bit of Sam (I adore him so much) and some more Laura and Toni. She won't be at the farm for too much longer, because shit's gotta kick off at some point but as I wrote this I just had so. much. love for Laura Fucking Barton and for real, we do not deserve that woman.
The first time Laura handed Nathaniel to her, it was because Cooper had opened the fridge too forcefully and jarred a couple of jam jars from the shelf. They cracked open on the kitchen floor and Laura, who had been feeding Nathaniel, all but shoved the baby into Toni’s arms while she went to clean up the mess.
They were quiet for a while, a tense silence interrupted only by the occasional rapid typing and the odd comment on the other side of the phone. Even Rhodey had pitched in to say he and Hope were driving to the Compound to help out however they could. Somehow, in the midst of everything they’d come together, everybody lending their support in some way or another over one boy, over a kid who was, regardless of whether they’d met him or not, part of the team.
Toni snorted, stirring her spoon in her empty coffee mug. “With Barton around? Doubt it’s gonna remain unspoken for very long.” When she sensed Nat’s mood dip further, she reached out and patted her awkwardly on the arm. “Hey, if anyone can get through Hawkeye’s dense skull it’s you. You didn’t lock him up in an underwater prison and keep him from his family. Dude’ll listen to you.”
T’Challa was good at this whole oratorial thing. He wasn’t one of those blustery people who engaged a crowd without actually saying anything important. He spoke with authority, something that came natural to him and wasn’t just a product of his royal upbringing. He knew how to sway a crowd with the kind of gentleness that Toni would never be able to possess. It was amazing to watch, nail-bitingly, anxiety-inducingly, spectacularly
If he closed his eyes he could almost imagine being back on the farm on a summer’s day, the doors and windows all open so everyone could hear the TV; Cooper would be out back creating one of his wooden modern art pieces that he was obsessed with; Lila would be at the kitchen table pretending to be an anchorwoman and Laura would be standing behind Nathaniel and helping him walk on chubby legs.
,” Toni drawled. “Plus the wings? Also, Janet Van Dyne was a fucking boss and SHIELD didn’t deserve her.”
.” His words were softly spoken but the force of them were as strong as gravity itself, echoing in the empty hall like a declaration, a
“If you want, you can leave everything to Princess Shuri. She can do this from start to finish. You do not have to put yourself through it. It is not your responsibility, Toni.”
A flash hit the corner of her eye and she flinched instinctively. When she looked, Princess Shuri had just gestured at Vision with her fork, a look of intrigue on her pretty face as she inquired about his abilities.
she thought, with no small amount of indignation. She deserved to know more than what little Clint had relayed to her.
“You haven’t eaten in hours,” she said suddenly, apropos of nothing, then slid off her seat and proceeded to pull things out of the fridge. Fifteen minutes later and he had a generous portion of leftover fried rice and a rather massive, freshly-made omelette with onions and Chinese sausage in front of him, which he dug into with gusto.
The reply came quicker than Laura had expected. It was also flat and emotionless, two things Laura suspected that Toni Stark
. And it was hurtful and shitty like an endless ball of string all tangled up and there was no way to loosen the knots and turn it back into something solid again. Because the kinks would always remain, every counterclockwise twist and every fray a scar, a reminder of what they broke.
She started but didn’t turn, merely listened to Laura’s now so familiar gait, her footsteps as gentle as everything else about her. She settled next to Toni, pressing their sides together so she could throw a large, woollen blanket over both their bodies. Toni shifted closer, instinctively leaning in towards Laura’s warmth and her comforting scent.
Laura laughed derisively. “A great job huh? You know before you came along Cooper and Lila fought with me almost every day. I wasn’t doing this right; I wasn’t helping Lila with her schoolwork, I wasn’t on time to take Coop to lacrosse practice. And at night I’m running to Nate’s room to change his diaper or feed him and it is
This was going to be her first since the disbandment of the Avengers, since the civil war that had torn not just the team, but the world in two.
Wanda watched her from the floor below, her hands hanging loosely by her side but her fingers were curling and uncurling, languidly manipulating only the air. Though there was no sign of red, the sight of them moving like that, like a
Before he could respond, the glass door to the right slid open and a woman in white scrubs stepped into the hall. “We’re ready for you, Sergeant Barnes,” she said, hands clasped in front of her patiently.
Neither one said anything for a long time, the only sound in the room coming from the laptop - a fucking
Steve stood cross-armed and watched through the glass as Bucky was rolled into the operating room by one of the doctors on Helen’s team.
a little bit personal.” Laura sighed again, folding her legs and kneeling in freshly turned soil, with tendrils of her brown hair sticking to the sides of her face. “I’m angry at him too, you know?”
