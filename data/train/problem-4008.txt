Confused, Dean asked. “Why do you have a pregnancy test?”
Dean looked up at his brother who was awkwardly teetering on his feet. “I think I’m gonna head to bed as well,” he said as he tried to escape his brother but Dean halted him.
“Then we should probably prepare for this,” Jody began. “If you’re saying that it’s inevitable that the angels will find Dean, then let’s make sure they don’t walk away without a fight.”
“So that’s why he didn’t come home with you. He’s pissed,” she put together.
Dean looked down at Cas’ soft hand holding his callused one. He looked up at him in his blue eyes, biting back tears. “You
Dean dropped his fork and his eyes got wide. “Wait, you’re in labor?” Dean was about to get up to sound the alarm when he saw Sam smiling, amused. “What’s so funny?”
“You still want a baby, don’t you?” Cas asked with puppy dog eyes.
“It’s not that simple! You profess your love for me when we think the world is about to end! How do you expect me to respond to that?” He argued.
Dean blinked. “What? Why?”
“Long story short, Dean and I wanted to live normal lives. So, we both left the life and got normal jobs.”
When they got back to the bunker Dean was beat up way more than usual. He carefully sat down on the bed with a grimace. “Ugh, boy am I sore.”
“Why do you even care? You gave up looking for a cure.”
“She should be going on her break soon. Let me see if I can reach her.”
Dean looked to his nephew. “He’s a Winchester. He better get used to the drama,” Dean said before closing the door to his room and calling it a night.
It was strange to wake up in a bed that wasn’t his own. He forgot what that felt like. Slightly disorientating and awkward. In the daylight, he got a better look at Jody’s guest bedroom. It had plaid bedding and very little decoration throughout it, yet it felt comforting and warm.
“Me?” he asked accusatorily. How is me dating the mother of my children causing drama?”
“We better get back to Jody’s,” Dean got out.
She didn’t hate therapy, she just hated confronting the realities of what she’s done and who she had become. It’s a big reason why it took her so long to see a therapist after kidnapping Sam. She didn’t want to hear how much of a stalker she was. Since moving to a new town, she left her old therapist and dreaded finding a new one. It was like starting all over again. But she managed to find a pretty decent one. Her name was Dr. Char. She looked to have been in her mid 40’s. Becky knew that she had 2 girls and a husband, because she would see the photos of whole family on her desk. Seemed like this woman had the perfect life.
“Shit.” He cursed at himself. Dean was about to call out to Becky to bring her back to apologize when Castiel opened the door.
“Dean!” Sam ran after his brother who was knocked out cold. He turned him over and was bewildered at the sight he saw before him. “Dean?” Sam was no longer staring at his brother, but at a female who looked like Dean. “Oh my God.”
Dean sighed. He didn’t want to get into it. It was a long story and Sam’s unborn baby didn’t have the time. “It doesn’t matter. Can you please just help him?”
“No, I’m not. Rowena took care of that.”
Dean couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “Pregnant? That’s impossible!”
Dean unexpectedly felt a slight kick under his palm. It made him smile. “Then again, this is Cas’s kid too and without him, I wouldn’t be pregnant.”
On Sam’s way back from breakfast he ran into Becky who was just leaving the bathroom after taking a shower. Her curly hair was still damp and she was drying it off with a towel when she stopped what she was doing to talk to Sam. “Hey!” she said, sounding as if she was surprised to see him.
Dean had a hard time looking at Sam’s face. The blood from his nose left a red stain under his nostrils and red droplets on his shirt. He also had a bruise forming from his nose to under his right eye. “I think I’m gonna stay here for a few days.”
Dean looked to Jody who seemed more confused than ever. “I’m not pregnant. Sam’s just delusional and doesn’t know when to leave things alone.”
“You’ve gotta understand that I was really messed up when I did that. I’m not her anymore. I know that even though I’ve read your lives-- the books version of Sam and Dean are not like the real Sam and Dean. You’re not just fictional characters. You’re real people—heroes who deserve to be treated like human beings.” They sat in complete silence for about 8 seconds. Becky grabbed her belongings. “I just wanted to tell you that. You don’t have to see me again.”
“So?” Becky’s voice brought him back to reality. “What the hell happened at Jody’s?”
“Of course. But I was thinking we should do this again sometime,” she put out there. “I don’t know anybody here and it would be nice to have someone I can talk to.”
She hesitantly walked to him but stood at the foot of his bed.
“And I wish I wasn’t a female but here we are,” Dean said as he walked out the door. He found a local dive bar. When he walked in, he was oogled by the patrons. He thought he would never get used to being looked at like he was a piece of meat. He sat at the and ordered a beer with a shot of whiskey.
Castiel smiled at him. “Don’t mention it. I maybe even enjoyed cooking,” he said, proud of his efforts.
“Until you got sloppy,” Sam said as he came around the other side pointing his gun at the other sister.
“Don’t worry about it.” Sam suddenly felt his phone vibrate. He looked at it and it was his brother texting him, asking him where he was. “Look, I should go.”
She nodded silently.
Jody had texted Sam a case in Sioux Falls that she thought would be perfect for the boys. It seemed like a routine Vamp nest. She didn’t need help with it, but she missed them and was looking forward to seeing them.
Dean grabbed the bowl of popcorn from Sam. “If you haven’t seen the movie by now, then that’s your problem.” He pressed the play button and they settled in as the movie began. They were 10 minutes in the movie before Sam got a SOS text from Becky.
She looked down at her chart to be sure she was being accurate. “Your blood pressure and your cholesterol levels are extremely high, which I think is the reason why you’ve been having the symptoms you’ve been having. You have preeclampsia,” she explained to them. “When was the last time you got your cholesterol checked?” she challenged.
“Really?” Dean said, shocked. ‘
With a wild smirk, Dean asked, “How do you feel about sandboxes?”
Sam narrowed his eyes at him. “Aa-are you checking yourself out?”
“Ho-how are you feeling?” Castiel asked.
Dean could see the fear in Cas’s eyes. “Then we’ll keep you here, away from the Angels. I don’t think I could handle another day without you. Move in with us,” Dean suggested. “That way you can go undetected from the angels and get to spend time with me.” Dean put Cas’s hand on his bump. “We can do actually do this thing together.”
Alex who was already dressed in blue scrubs, ready for work, pointed to his brother who was on the backyard deck on the phone. “Outside,” she said. Alex was also feeding the twins in an old high chair that Jody found.
Dean entered the war room “If he trusts her then so should we,” Dean defended him. Castiel flashed him a small smile. Jody let go of his sleeve and he ran up the stairs to open the steel door. On the other side was Ruth, but she was accompanied with a few other angels behind her. One of which had an angel blade to her back and immediately plunged it through her back. The other angel plunged his blade into Castiel’s shoulder, causing him to fall backwards over the railing, landing on top of the war table.
“My name is Lindsay, I’m a nurse here at Memorial Hospital. We’ve just admitted Becky Rosen for a suicide attempt.” Sam immediately sat up. His heart was racing. “She didn’t have anyone as her emergency contact, but this was the last number she called.”
Sam saw what she saw and the angels were no longer fighting them but now searching for Dean, and making a run for the dungeon. “Shit,” Sam mumbled.
The last time he saw Becky was after she drugged him and tricked him into marriage. He hoped that he would never see her again. “Wha-what are you doing here, Becky?”
Dean glared at him. “Yeah, that’s why I spent most of my time on the ground and why you’re fixing my wounds.” Dean got up from the bed and grabbed his keys.
Dean never thought of it that way, and now that he had he wish he hadn’t. “Thanks for that.” Dean’s stomach growled as he saw the table that was filled with a mouthwatering breakfast spread. He couldn’t wait to tear into it. The mound of bacon was calling his name. He went to grab a piece when Jody smacked his hand away. “Ow! What gives?” he said, shaking the hand she slapped.
“Are you sure?”
“None of this makes sense,” Dean interrupted.
She took back her shot of whiskey. “He-uh-he said that I catfished him. He told me that he could never be a with a girl like me,” she sobbed. She then handed Sam her phone to her Tinder profile picture. The photo was of her in a yellow sundress on the beach. He wasn’t sure what the guy was talking about. She didn’t look any different. Clearly the guy was an asshole. “I’m never going to get married and have kids of my own. That’s all I want, Sam,” she sadly, slurred.
Dean audibly groaned. He turned off the burner and put the last of the pancakes on the kitchen table. “You’ve got to be kidding me,” he complained.
Dean helped Sam to the infirmary in the bunker, but Sam was barely staying awake. A mixture of the amount of blood he was losing and the pain he was in, he could feel himself passing out. By the time Dean got Sam on the bed he was out cold. Dean looked up at the ceiling and closed his eyes. “Cas!” he shouted. “Cas, we need you. I need you. Sammy is hurt.” When he opened his eyes Castiel stood in front of him, looking stoic as ever. “Dean, it’s been a while,” he breathed.
“Abigail,” Dean said. “Her name is Abigail.”
“What?” Jack asked, confused.
She led him down the stairs so that Dean was out of range. “I think I know why you’ve been feeling the way you have,” she began.
“Tell her that you made a mistake and want to live alone. Or don’t move at all. You’ll have plenty of help here with Cas and I around,” Dean told him.
“Hey! You’re going to be fine!” Dean told him, but it sounded like more of a panic. Sam could hear Dean getting into the Impala and turning the engine over. “I’ll be there in 10 minutes. Just stay in your classroom. Do you have another class soon?”
you this morning,” he said fighting back tears. “I can’t do this thing alone, Cas and I felt
“A little surprise.” She then opened the door to reveal a tasteful cars-themed nursery. Dean gasped at the large mural behind the crib that was a hand-painted replica of his 67’ Chevy Impala on it, parked on a dirt road. On both sides of the car were large angel wings and at the top of the mural, it read, “My Little Angel” in cursive. “This is your baby’s nursery.”
“So then why did you answer?” Cas asked. He was next to Dean but there was plenty of space between them. He didn’t want to overstep his boundaries.
Dean laid back in his bed with a hand on his bump, slowly rubbing it as he thought about everything that just happened. He got to keep his baby, Castiel was back, but he was still unhappy. He thought that he would be over the moon by now. This is what he wanted. Right? His thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the door. “Come in,” he yelled.
Sam could see that she was on the brink of tears. “I get that you weren’t in the best place when you did this,” he said gesturing to his stomach, “and that you regret it. But I’ve had some time to think about it, and maybe this could be a good thing. You’re going to be a mom and I’m going to be a dad and our kid deserves to have a good life, which means us having a good relationship. I never had that growing up. I do think that you should go back to therapy though.”
Sam ignored his comment and continued on. “And we got coffee and she apologized about Vegas and we just got to know one another. She told me that she changed. She said that she was going to therapy and she had a stable job, she barely ever brought up hunting or the life. And we just…bonded,” he said. Sam had seen such a difference from the old Becky to how she presented herself now.
“I wanted to apologize about what I said back there. I was really freaked out about the whole thing. I want you to know that I don’t blame you. And I shouldn’t have snapped at you.” Dean blew out a long breath and ran his hand through his hair. “I’m just going through a lot.”
He had just finished his breakfast that Sam made him. “Sammy, would it kill you to make eggs that aren’t white?”
. I thought we already decided that prepping for Thanksgiving this early was stupid.”
Jody rolled her eyes.
“Why don’t you worry about yourself?” Dean snapped and then walked out the door. He was too tired to endure a questionnaire by his brother. His nausea did subside an hour after he ran into Sam in the bathroom. What really kept him up at night was the absence of his boyfriend. He hadn’t seen Cas since he visited him in the middle of the night to tell him that things were
She quickly sobered up. “I-I’m so sorry. That was stupid. I’m drunk,” she chuckled nervously. “I gotta go.” She tried to pick up her purse but the room was beginning to spin.
He looked at the badge and it read, ‘Detective Deana Zeppelin’. “Deana? That’s the best you could come up with?”
couldn’t be! She had to get home to read over the spell again. There is no way she messed up this badly. Without saying goodbye, Becky ran out of the gym and drove straight home. She dug the book from her closet and opened to the pregnancy spell page. She remembered that the ingredients were correct---then where did she go wrong? She then noticed that there was a back page to the spell that she didn’t see that night. It had further incantations to say. “Shit…,” she groaned. No wonder the spell didn’t work for her. She was pretty sure that she accidentally impregnated Sam.
Instead of being involved in the fight, he thought that he would make himself useful and assist with making angel bullets. Sam suggested amping up the warding, but the existing warding was already draining on Cas. Adding more warding could hurt him. So, they made more bullets in hope this would compensate for it.
She shook her head. “Castiel, the angels can feel it’s presence… I’m surprised you can’t.”
After a nice long hot shower, he began to towel himself off when he noticed he had a text message from Becky. He forgot that they had exchanged numbers.
“If you haven’t had your period yet, and you’ve had intercourse then I fear that you may be pregnant.”
“Thanks, man.”
“A baby that could die if this trial doesn’t go your way. But this isn’t the first time that he’s done this. How many times have we had to save Cas’s ass because he became a little too righteous and did something behind our backs? Wake up, Dean! The problem isn’t Heaven or Gabriel or the angles or Jack, it’s Cas.”
He was barely awake, but alive. Sam helped him up. “Where’s Dean?” Cas groaned.
Becky smiled, but it soon faltered. “Why are you doing this? I know that I don’t deserve this.”
The bunker was still as Dean headed down to the dungeon with his ingredients. He could hear his breath quicken with each step. The last thing he needed was his brother catching him in the act. Once he reached the doors leading to the dungeon, he checked his surroundings before entering.
Dean put his head in his hands. “Great, now what do we do?”
Sam wasn’t expecting her to turn him down so quickly, but it was a little relieved that she did. He didn’t bother bringing up that he thought it wouldn’t be good idea either. “You’re right,” he said. “I’ll just have to figure something else out. I eventually want to get out of the bunker,” he told her. He refused to raise his children as hunters.
Jody greeted the boys, enthusiastically, when they arrived. She was so excited to see them Anyone other than Jody, Claire or Alex was a welcome change. Claire was on a hunt herself in Dayton and Alex joined a nursing retreat out in the mountains. She would be home in a few days’ time. Which meant, Jody finally had some time away. “Oh, it’s so good to see you boys. Dean, it’s good to see without the boobs this time,” she joked.
“What about him?”
“About 4 1/2 months,” Sam said guiltily.
“I’m not!” he gritted. Sam took two steps away from his brother and then turned back to square him up. “You know, it’s real fucking rich to have you of all people comment on my relationship when
“Morning sickness has to run its course. It’ll go away by the second trimester.”
Dean didn’t think he could sleep that long. Sam’s face came into view. “You scared us, you know,” Sam said. Dean sighed as he looked at his brother's bruised and battered face. He was the one to give him that massive shiner on his eye and bruised nose and it riddled him with guilt. He was then hyperaware of his lack of mobility due to an IV inserted in his arm, a monitor with a thousand wires strapped to his other arm, and another monitor strapped to his stomach. “What is all of this?” he asked.
“Did you want to talk about it?” Sam asked her, trying to be a good friend.
“Well that’s going to be tough, since they’re dead,” Dean said. “Look, can you fix this or not?” He was running out patience with Rowena.
“Good!” Becky answered enthusiastically. “How were the twins? Hopefully, they didn’t give you too much trouble.”
“Not all angels are good,” he reminded her. “Lucifer being a prime example,” he mumbled.
The memory of Dean having hot sex in the back of the Impala with Cas came flooding back. Dean shifted his weight. “I-uh-I may have.” He said crossing his arms. “Why? What are you implying?”
Most people would have a hard time reading the expressions of the angel. When he first possessed Jimmy Novak, Dean was pretty sure he had two emotions: anger and confusion. Since spending time with the humans, most importantly the Winchesters, he’s gained more emotions but occasionally had a hard time expressing them. It was subtle. But not subtle enough for Dean. He knew Cas better than he knew himself. And the emotion he was expressing was doubt. “I’m afraid not.”
Sam suddenly became aware at how long they had been out in the hallway and was surprised that Castiel hadn’t checked on his boyfriend. Especially since he doesn’t sleep. “Where’s Cas?”
Dean gave an incredulous stare. “What are you talking about?! We just started the movie! Where the hell are you going?”
Dean gripped the back of the chair that was in front of him so tight that he left indents in the wood. “You’re a hypocritical, son of a bitch, you know that? You better hope that those angels vote in favor of Cas because if they come to kill my baby, I’m going to kill you.”
When Cas appeared, he seemed standoffish from Dean. “Hello Dean,” he said in his deep gravelly voice.
“But I do think I ate too much cake,” Sam said as he stifled a burp and then pushed away the black plastic plate that was holding the cake. He had eaten well over half of it. He grimaced at his sheer gluttony.
Dean placed his hands on the counter and took another deep breath, this time it wavered a bit as he held in a sob. “Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit,” he repeated over and over again until it lost its meaning. The weird thing was, he speculated for days that he could be pregnant, but now that he had confirmation of it, he was panicking. He was scared. And Cas wasn’t there to talk him through it.
“Watching Sam and seeing how happy and excited he is to have his baby, I thought we could have the same thing.”
.” He said gesturing towards his brother. “I knew you’d be pissed about it no matter what.”
Sam glared at his brother. “No. I’m serious, Dean. What the hell am I supposed to do? I just started this new life. Having a kid was not in the original plans,” he rambled. “Maybe, I should talk to Becky.”
“I thought you were dating her.”
“Dean, I’m-,”
“Sam? Are you okay?”
At first Becky looked down in disappointment. If Sam moved out of the bunker then she would have to move back to her depressing apartment. She was really starting to love the bunker. For the most part it was quiet and filled with other worldly books. Every day she found herself picking up a new book and researching about a monster she never even heard of. She thought that Chuck would have a field day in a place like this. Most importantly she didn’t feel lonely. With the boys and Castiel filling the bunker, it felt safe. There is no way she would feel that way again if she went back to her apartment. It was definitely something she could bring up in her next therapy session.
She looked at him confused. “Dean called and told me that you were in labor.”
Dean’s heart hurt. His heart was racing so fast, that it was threatening to jump out of his chest. “Are there any angels in Heaven that give a shit about this baby?” he asked, his voice wavering.
“Yeah, what’s wrong with it?” Gabriel asked.
And the weight was back. He hadn’t spoken to Cas, and was dreading the conversation. “No, not yet.”
Sam quivered his eyebrow with suspicion, “I didn’t even see you drink last night.”
“I won’t. I promise,” Cas stepped closer to Dean until their faces were centimeters apart. “I will never hurt you again,” he whispered before gently kissing Dean. He kissed him back.
“Yeah, but I don’t know from what. I didn’t do anything.” He closed his eyes as he placed his head on the pillow, relaxing with every pass Cas did through his hair.
“Wow.”
“I’m pregnant,” Dean told him.
“So, what if I did? Since when do you monitor my alcohol consumption?” Dean quipped. He also tried his very best not to slur. He knew that he was drunk, but could still hold a semi-intelligent conversation. “What are you doing up?”
Luckily as Dean was about to attempt to get up Castiel walked in. “Don’t get up. What do you want for breakfast?”
“I lied. I knew how much this pregnancy meant to you. To us. I didn’t want to give it up because of what Heaven had to say. So, I thought if I kept it hidden from them then it wouldn’t matter. But they found out.”
“I don’t need a babysitter, Jody.”
Sam shot his head up right away and turned to his brother. “Dean?”
She shook her head. “Sam, we’re over 35 which already puts me at a 30% chance at getting pregnant and goes down even further with each additional year I wait. My time is ticking,” she said solemnly. “That’s why this date has to go well,” she said with determination.
Sam closed his book and gave him his full attention. “Of course.
month of pregnancy. And this all started 4 months ago!”
“Well, I would say talk to the witches, but we killed them, so…research?”
“Last time I saw him was like, 3 days ago.”
“That depends…what’s wrong?”
Cas was astonished that Sam of all people didn’t understand the significance of this. “Dean could be in danger if this gets out.”
“Yes, fraternal twins.”
“Yeah, I guess so. I’ll give you 10 minutes to get ready and then we hit the road.”
Sam could hear the commotion, so he got up to rush to his brother.
“Hmm?” she stopped staring at her phone to give her attention to Noah, who had a worried expression on his face. “Sorry, yeah—well, no. I’m just worried about my roommate.”
“Yeah, yeah. Can we stop at the store before we go the Jody’s please?”
“I am! For starters my brother’s pregnant. And now Cas is here. Haven’t seen him for over 2 years. Not since he-,” he stopped himself and looked Becky who was staring right back at him, intrigued in his story.
Castiel looked agitated at the mention of Jack. As if he’d already exhausted that option. “Jack is not going to be of any help to us. He’s siding with the other angels on this. He thinks this should be a fair trial,” he recalled.
He explained the whole ordeal to Becky. How Cas was in angelic jail and on trial. Dean’s baby was at risk and how they spoke with God was no help at all. She stood there with her hand over her mouth in complete shock. “And now he wants to see if he can get an archangel to help us,” Sam explained. Ethan finished his bottle and Sam picked him up to burp him. He gently patted his back and waited for him to spit up.
Dean pulled Cas in for a kiss. “Yes, I’m sure. Cereal now please.”
To their luck, Alex was able to sneak them into the hospital and into a room that resided in an abandoned wing. “I just want to state publicly that I’m not a doctor nor do I know how to deal with a pregnant man,” she announced to the room. She had prepped the room with a sonogram machine, a few syringes, as well as an IV just in case she needed to pump fluids in Dean.
This wasn’t the first time Cas became a human. At least this time around he’d be used to it.
“No…you decided that. I think it’s perfectly sensible,” he said as he found a new website that had the headline “HOW TO FRY YOUR TURKEY THIS THANKSGIVING”. Dean thoughtfully hummed at this.
“If you have an idea on how to expel a crap-ton of angels then I’m all ears.” Sam sighed. “We gotta grab Cas.”
Stunned she had to go deep in her mind and think. “I would love to say no, but I live with two mid twenty-year old’s, so I’m sure there is one around here somewhere. Why?” she asked.
“I don’t wanna talk about it,” Dean said quietly.
Dean didn’t think much of Sam’s disappearance. He was trying to focus on not vomiting all over the kitchen floor. Once all of the prep work was done, Dean went to his bedroom to hide the pregnancy test in his drawer. He then plopped on his bed, exhausted, as if he was the one prepping all of the food. It felt good to be away from the smell of food and relaxing his muscles. Castiel joined him shortly after and cuddled with him in the bed, arm wrapped around him, with his fingertips ever so gently touching his abdomen.
“I mean I’m EMT certified so, I think we’re good,” she said as moved the wand around. She finally came upon a small blob that made out a tiny baby. “I think that’s it,” she said pointing to the monitor. She then turned on the sound so Dean could hear the baby’s heartbeat. He couldn’t take his eyes off the screen. He was speechless. “Let’s see if we can take a photo for you,” Jody said while she tried to figure out how to take a screenshot and print it.
She also came to terms with telling Noah about her kids. She invited to him the bunker, which uncovered one lie about her living in an apartment and then sat him down to go into detail about her past and how Sam recently had their twins. She even discussed how Castiel was an angel and how he was dating Dean. When she started talking about how monsters and such were real, he stopped her so that he could collect his thoughts. It was a lot to be thrown at once. He ultimately told her that he needed some time and never called her back.
Sam closed his eyes and took a breath. “You haven’t changed one bit.” He said softly, but anger resonated in his voice. “Once again you way overstepped. And I’m the idiot that let you do it,” Sam turned his back on her.
Sam nodded. “Yeah, I got it.”
“I know. I know,” he shushed him. “I promise that I will be back when I can.”
Cas waited for Dean’s cramping to subside before he spoke. “Dean…I’m sorry. If I still had my wings--,”
“We’ve been told not to speak to you,” she revealed.
“Yeah, who is this?”
Dean raised his eyebrows. “Too much cake?” he snickered.
He nodded. “I wasn’t thinking straight.”
“Far from it!” he chuckled.
Sam heard Becky sigh over the phone. “Okay, well stay safe. And please refrain from getting in another fight with your brother.”
“And sitting here is smart?” Cas asked him. “I told you that I wouldn’t let anything happen to you!”
Everybody halted and stared at Castiel. Sam sat up on the hospital bed. “Twins?” he croaked. “I’m having twins?”
“I was just gonna make myself some cereal,” Dean said.
Castiel and Dean sat at the bar and talked for a few hours. Dean was more than pleasantly tipsy when the bar closed. Castiel had to help him walk to the Impala. He also offered to drive him to the motel. He was in no shape to be behind a wheel.
“We’re not going to let that happen,” Sam said, to which Jody agreed.
Dean was taken aback by that. “Bonded? Well, if you guys bonded so well then why did you try and hide it from me?”
Jack didn’t quite understand that reference and it showed all over his face. “What is going on here?” he asked suspicious of everyone’s true nature.
The next day Sam checked her out of the hospital. She wore the oversized flannel that he brought her and Dean’s smallest pair of sweatpants. Dean welcomed them when they got back to the bunker with some lunch. Sam was still pretty nauseous so he barely touched his but Becky was ravenous. The hospital food they gave her was barely edible. “Um, if it’s okay, after lunch I was thinking about getting my things from my apartment,” Becky said.
At the motel Sam was sitting at the table with his laptop open with secured files with the victims of the witches. Each one always dies similarly, a blade to the neck. “These girls just don’t stop.”
Sam shrugged. “What’s wrong with it?”
It couldn’t be anything supernatural related. Dean and Sam had been away from the life too long. Then again that didn’t mean that people didn’t have their qualms against them. Sam thought about this on his way to the gym. He may not have felt 100%, but a good workout could make him feel a little better. He started off slow on the treadmill on a low incline. Just something to get his heartrate up. He focused on his classic rock music blaring in his ear. It felt good to get back in the swing of things. He decided to pick up the pace a little on a 3.5 speed and began to jog. Jogging to the beat of the music. Sam closed his eyes and for the first time in a while he felt like himself. He even had a small smile on his face. He probably looked like a complete idiot, but he didn’t care. That was until he felt the nausea slowly creep through his insides. The jostling from the running became too much for his body. He could feel the stomach acid in his throat. He didn’t have much time before he got sick all over the treadmill, so he didn’t stop the machine and ran to the bathroom.
!” she demanded through her teeth. Sam watched his every move as his brother disappeared into the house. Sam waited a moment to follow him in when he felt Jody push him so hard, he almost fell back into the dewy grass. “You’re cooling off out here. I’m not gonna have you two fighting in my house where your kids can watch you.” She grabbed a handkerchief from her pocket and threw it at Sam. “Clean yourself off.” Sam dabbed his nose, trying to stop the bleeding.
“How are you feeling?” she asked him. “I saw you having a contraction earlier.”
“The trial,” Dean began. “Does Castiel have a chance?”
“I’m fine.” He gave her a once over. She too looked pale. Like she hadn’t gotten sleep for weeks. “What happened to you? I’ve been trying to call you. I haven’t seen you since—well since your date.”
Dean inched closer to her. “We’ve been calling your for over a month!”
Dean shook his head. “No, you’re trying to put a band aid on a broken leg and it’s not working.”
Becky wanted to clear the air. “We’re not--,”
“Kill Becky.”
Sam trodded back to the library to find Castiel and Dean making out. Dean’s body was up against the table and Cas was threatening to throw him on top of it. Sam made a very appointed clearing of his throat. Immediately, Castiel awkwardly sidestepped away from Dean. “I left you in here to watch my son and now your—where the hell is, he?” he asked looking around until he found him resting in a basinet off to the side. “You guys have got to be kidding me…” Sam scooped up his son and gave them the evil eye.
“Do you blame me? The broad has drugged you, tricked you into marriage and now this! You better hope you’re not pregnant, because if you are then you’re stuck with her for the rest of your life.”
“Morning,” he said cautiously. “You’re up early.”
Dean felt the same way. When they started their relationship, not much had changed except the addition of sex. Everything felt more open between the two of them. They were closer than they had ever been. However, Dean felt like having a baby would be a huge leap in their relationship. One he wasn’t sure if he was ready for.
Becky finished feeding Charlotte and got the kids in bed. Sam decided to retreat to bed as well. On his way to his room, he stopped at Dean’s door where he locked himself in after Jack left. He contemplated checking on him. He hovered his knuckles over the wooden door and then slowly lowered it. Dean was probably beside himself about the situation. Mourning the temporary loss of his fiancé. Not to mention the unknown outcome of his baby. He was sure that he wanted to be alone. So, Sam padded his way to his room and went to bed.
“No, it would have to go into a human. You, in this case.”
“I’m still in love with you and I feel like the only way I’m going to get over you is if I start seeing people again. I know that my last date wasn’t ideal, but I’m in a better place than I was then so even if it does go bad, I think I’ll be okay.”
She too was focused on the monitor. “Yeah, everything looks normal to me, well, considering.”
Cas agreed. He’s been wanting to for months, but didn’t because of Dean’s request. It’s gone too far. He snuck into Dean’s room and he was fast asleep. He placed his hand on his forehead and healed his back. Dean didn’t wake and continued to sleep peacefully.
“Yes, Sam, I’m good. I’m back to normal,” Dean said giving him a knowing nod. Dean finally felt like himself again.
“What can I say, I feel generous when I’m drunk,” Dean told him. He could barely remember what he did with Castiel, but he knew he wasn’t ready to discuss it with his brother.
Sam’s nausea was still pretty bad. Becky couldn’t bear to hear him getting sick every morning. Every time she saw him run to the bathroom; she would feel this wave of guilt wash over her. And it didn’t make it any better that he was being so nice to her all of the time. Even on his worst of worse days he always found a way to speak to her and make her feel seen.
Jack nodded enthusiastically. “Yes! Loads of them are.”
Dean cooked the Ham for dinner with all of the fixings and it was a perfect Christmas. Sam was glad that this was now his life. When he quit hunting, he was so set on living this normal life. But that was no longer his goal. He just wanted to be surrounded by family. As long as family was near, then he was happy.
“Sure,” Dean responded. “What are you and Becky doing?”
On the other hand, Dean continued to chow down on his pie with ease.
Dean fiercely shook his head. “Hell no! That’s my brother. I’m not going to leave him alone.”
Castiel went to Sam’s body and gave it a once over. He put a hand on his stomach and closed his eyes, as if he was listening to the baby. “The baby’s heart-rate is very low,” he told Dean.
Sam chuckled. “No, I’m serious. I have a family because of you. 2 beautiful children. I never thought I would have that.”
Dean groaned. “Tell me the bad first.”
“The news about your pregnancy,” Sam told him.
Sam didn’t think of it that way. This was the grocery store incident all over again. “No, of course not.”
Dean carefully placed his niece into her crib. “Yeah, about that…,”
Dean had half a mind to continue, but he decided to abide by his brother wishes and left. Sam plunged his head into pillow and closed his eyes. He was exhausted, both mentally and physically. He passed out for a few hours, until he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. It was an unknown number calling him. In a sleepy fog he groggily answered the phone. “Hello?”
Sam scoffed, “Is he ever dead? We haven’t heard from him for a few months, but he’s our only hope at this point.”
Sam then noticed that Becky wasn’t around. “Where is Becky? Did you tell her about me?” Dean scratched the back of his head as he tried to think of an answer. Sam glared at his brother. “Dean? What did you do?”
. I’ve seen it.” Cas was referring to the countless times Dean had saved the world. “I understand the idea of a pregnancy can be scary, but you’re not going to be in this alone. I’ll be here with you every step of the way.”
Meanwhile, in the twin’s nursery, Sam was changing Charlotte’s diaper, but she was very wiggly, which made it difficult. “I need you to stay still for me, sweetie,” Sam said to his daughter. He eventually was able to get the diaper around her and secure it snuggly around her waist. She then smiled and laughed at her dad. Sam smiled as he picked her up and held her close. He closed his eyes and kissed her on her head. She still had that new baby smell that Sam was obsessed with.
“It’s Becky—,”
Castiel smiled at him. “I’ve always noticed, Dean.” They finally found the car keys and Castiel went to open the door for him when Dean sneaked a kiss. “Dean…what are you--,”
He looked at her with tears in his eyes. “I don’t know how I’m going to tell Cas this.”
“What the hell is that supposed to mean?”
The dew from the grass penetrated his sneakers and into his socks as he quickly approached his brother. “Honey?”
“Only if you come back.”
“You could be bi-sexual. You can get the best of both worlds,” she joked.
“I didn’t want any of this to happen!” she fought back.
“Stomach bug?” Becky suggested.
“No, of course, I’m not happy. But I was serious when I said that I didn’t want archangels hanging around the house. I’d like to keep this place as drama-free as I can, for my kids’ sake.”
do this alone! I told you that in the beginning. You promised that you would be with me.” He could feel tears stinging behind his eyes.
She relaxed a bit at his words. It made her a little less anxious about the situation. Labels had always bothered her. “What about Dean?”
“I don’t think she did. She obviously turned you back into a boy, but I don’t think the pregnancy left you,” Sam rattled on his theory. “I think you’re still carrying that baby. I mean it would make sense--,”
Becky was starting to feel more comfortable around Sam. She would eat most of her meals with them in the kitchen. Even began to talk to Sam around the bunker. She finally beginning to relax around them.
“Sure,” Sam said. He walked out of the room and a few seconds later Claire appeared looking very timid. She stood by the door afraid to take a step closer. She teetered on the balls of her feet, pushing her hair out of her face. “Sam, said you wanted to see me?”
“I know and I’m sorry that—”
“We were hoping we could talk to Alex about using a sonogram machine to check in on the baby. He’s been having these pains in his side, not to mention the dizziness and the weakness,” Sam explained to Jody.
“For how long?”
Becky and Sam tearfully smiled at each other. “Thank you so much, Sam. You are amazing.”
, she thought. “I don’t like it Sam. Vengeful angels freak me out. It’s like fighting the good guys.” She always thought it was odd when she began reading the fourth series in the Supernatural books when Chuck introduced angels into the story. She grew up in a religious household where she was taught that demons were bad and angels were good, but books turned those rules on its head.
“Great,” Dean rudely interrupted. “I think it’s time we get you to the infirmary before you drop these kids right here.”
“No, not at this very moment. But the reason for your pain was because your baby was in major distress on top of the preeclampsia…this could’ve been really bad Dean. If Claire didn’t get you here when she did, we could’ve been having a whole different conversation,” he said with a hint of foreboding.
In mid stroke Dean stopped and looked down at Cas’ gleaming body. “What?” he said out of breath.
Sam could sense Dean’s anger about the situation so he decided to try and make light of it. “I guess angels don’t get Thanksgiving off.”
“I’m not sure,” he said, being curt with his responses.
“No,” he groaned. “The contractions are too far apart.”
“Well you should,” Sam double-downed. “Where is he anyway?”
Claire gave Dean a quick kiss on the cheek before leaving the room. Dean took advantage of the silence and closed his eyes. He took a deep breath and let it out slowly. As he did so, he felt his baby move underneath his fingers. He placed his hand where he felt the baby push against his hand. “I know, baby I know,” he whispered to his stomach. “you’re pissed at me too and you know what? I don’t blame you. I’m angry too. Not at you but your father. You see, he’s the reason why we’re in this whole mess. If he were here then I wouldn’t be so stressed out, your life wouldn’t be in danger and we could pretend like things are normal for like 5 minutes.”
. Because when the angels inevitably kill my child, I’d like to say that I made an effort to stop it.”
They had a hunter’s funeral for Ruth. Castiel gathered that he lost her life protecting Castiel and his family. Sam finally finished the nursery so Abigail had a place to sleep. For a few more days, Jody stayed to help out the boys. None of them knew how to handle a newborn, so she was very helpful with the quick tutorial.
Once she got to the bunker, she saw Sam sitting in the library reading some old lore books. He looked up to see Becky coming down the stairs. “Morning, how was therapy?”
“Dean, have you had sex?”
Dean on the other hand was going through Hell. He will never understand why a woman would voluntarily want to put her body through this. Once he reached 28 weeks, any and all morning sickness has stopped, except for when he smelt ham. Ham always sent him over the edge. Now he was dealing with constant urination and his aching back. He had other symptoms but those were the worse. Getting flung around by ghosts and demons ruined his back. Sam had begged him to see a chiropractor when they were actively hunting, but he always refused. Said that it was nothing a stiff mattress couldn’t fix. But a stiff couldn’t fix this. With his body growing bigger and bigger by the day, his back was in constant agony.
Cas was about to tell him that they should keep the pregnancy quiet to not alert the angels but soon all Cas could hear was Dean’s light snoring.
Sam knew that he didn’t have to ask, but it spilled out of him as hurriedly walked to the nursery to get her changed.
“Great, you got one that specializes in male pregnancy?” Dean asked sarcastically.
“And I think it was Cas who convinced Jack to ward off the angels,” Sam added.
Dean looked his brother up and down. “You’re wearing a suit,” he commented. “That’s some nice night.”
, Dean thought.
“Don’t worry about it. I’ll get your things, just make me a list,” Dean said with a helpful smile. Underneath that smile Dean wasn’t 100% sure about this new arrangement. He made a mental note to do some further investigating while in Becky’s apartment.
He was at University wrapping up a lecture on torts when he began to feel incredibly dizzy. It was slight at first but by the end of class he wasn’t able to stand properly and needed to sit down. It was strange because something like this never happened to him before. He waited for his class to leave so he could rush to the bathroom to splash some cold water on his face. On his way to the restroom he found himself holding on to the side of the wall to regain balance and keep from falling. He eventually made it to the bathroom and luckily it was empty from students. He grabbed the sink to keep himself steady and looked at his reflection in the mirror. He was pale with a hint of green and shine to his skin. Suddenly his stomach lurched. He covered his mouth and ran to the nearest stall to throw up. It felt like it was never ending. He clutched his stomach as he continued to empty whatever was left inside of him. It was a miracle nobody walked in on him.
“Have you heard of that new Indian place on Main Street?” Sam asked.
“I’m on my way,” she told him. She ran back to her table with an apologetic smile. “I’m so sorry, but I’ve got to go.”
“No, we’re not. Just friends who have kids.”
Sam chuckled nervously. “Um, surprise?”
“Okay, but let’s just hope it doesn’t come to that,” Sam said. “If you trust this angel then so do, we.”
This was not going the way Dean thought it would. He thought that Cas would be angry for not telling him right away, but he’s mad about something else entirely. “Are you kidding me? I was in knots thinking about telling you. I’ve literally been dealing with my own identity crisis over here and you’re mad that I’m pregnant with a Nephilim?”
Sam entered the kitchen with a look of confusion on his face holding his daughter. He was holding a bottle, while she suckled at it. “What did you do?” Sam, who had major bedhead, racked a hand through his hair.
A few hours later the pain that stemmed from Sam’s nose woke him. He habitually slept with his face into the pillow but was careful not to do that when he initially went to sleep. He must have accidentally moved his face into the pillow, causing his discomfort. He winced at the pain. He rolled over and noticed that the baby monitor that usually sat on his nightstand was removed. Becky must have taken it while he was sleeping to prevent the kids from waking him. It was the small things that warmed his heart.
Becky recalled the black eye and screwed-up nose when he came back from Jody’s. Dean had also ignored her presence when Castiel came back, but she chalked that up the immense stress he had been feeling. Becky was used to the way Dean treated her and the snide comments he made behind her back, but it didn’t hurt any less. She understood that she was the outside within the Winchester family, and she had a non-favorable past, but she thought that she had made some noticeable improvements since then. “Yeah, I know, but no matter what, Dean, we’re family. And I want to be a part of your family, no matter how broken it is. And believe me, it’s pretty damn broken,” Becky and Dean chuckled. “So, there isn’t much you can say that’s going to have me running for the hills.”
After lunch Becky handed Dean a list of the items, she wanted him to retrieve from her apartment. It was mostly some clothes, toothbrush, a few books and her laptop. When he got there the door was slightly opened. Probably from when the ambulance came to take her away. It was a one-bedroom, one bath, apartment with a modest size kitchen. It was the first thing you saw when you walked in. For the most part her apartment was very clean. That was until he past the bathroom. He couldn’t help himself and opened this door first. The floor was covered in dried blood. He could even see the bloodied razor that was on the sink. Dean wasn’t a stranger to seeing horrifying scenes. As a hunter he’s seen more deaths than a coroner. Either way, it didn’t make things any easier. He was just glad that he didn’t see Becky on the floor in her final moments.
Jody arched her brow. “Nope. I just gave them one of my menacing Mom stare downs and they went their separate ways.” She placed the tray that consisted of scrambled egg whites and dry wheat toast in his lap and took a seat at the edge of the bed, smoothing the duvet as she sat down.
“Yeah.”
Dean couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “Who cares about what the angels think?” Dean spat.
The bartender winked at Dean after he downed his shot. “What’s a pretty girl like you doing in a place like this all by yourself. You got yourself a boyfriend or something?”
,” he mumbled as he grabbed the raw turkey and put it under the sink to rinse off the brine. A few gags later he was able to get it back in the tray and begin seasoning it and covering it in butter. Maybe one or two gags escaped through him but he pushed through it. Finally, it was time to get it in the oven. He opened the oven and basically threw the turkey in. When he closed the oven, he found himself out of breath, as if he ran a marathon. He certainly felt like he had. “I did it!” he exclaimed louder than intended.
She sat there and took in what he said while she needed a moment to process it. She rubbed her palm over her mouth. “Um…. well that was unexpected.” She continued to process until she said, “Does this mean you’re gay?”
Dean took the mug and rubbed his tired eyes.
Without gazing up she handed him a clipboard with a pen attached to it. “Sit down and fill this out. Someone will be with you shortly.”
About an hour later they pulled up to the playground that Dean and Sam had known to be Heaven’s gates. There were no children in sight, which made the scene very creepy. The swings were being gently pushed by the light breeze. A pile of leaves had scattered around the mulch that laid below the jungle gym dancing in the wind.
Sam took a long pull of his beer. “Nah, I’m done with all of that.”
A sickening thought overcame Dean. “What happens to the baby if you lose?”
Becky got Cas some ice for his cheek and made him a ham sandwich. With him being human, he was probably hungry and didn’t realize it. Sam and Cas retreated to the kitchen while Becky checked on the twins. Cas ate his sandwich silently as he tried to come to terms with what happened. He couldn’t bear to know that Dean was angry with him. Sam brought him out of his thoughts when he said, “If the trial goes against us, then we may have Gabriel in our pocket.”
Dean shifted his weight. “He said that he’d be able to help if Cas loses the trial,” he recalled. “So, Cas is stuck up there for God knows how long, you happy?”
“I’m afraid not, Dean. What Cas did was a major offense in Heaven. Castiel knows the rules. And I can’t play favorites to him or you or Sam. I have to be fair.”
“Cas?” she finished his sentence.
Dean let out an annoyed groan. “I have no idea. I want to say no because I don’t think of myself as gay, but maybe I do. I know I like women…. but then there’s Cas…,” Dean shook his head and stood up. “I don’t like to think about it.”
They ate dinner and Jody gave them a bag full of clothes. When they got in the car Sam said, “You need to relax. Have faith man. We’ll figure this whole thing out, but don’t take it out on everybody else. Especially, Jody—she’s just trying to help.”
She grabbed a plate that had a single egg white, 2 pieces of turkey bacon, and assorted fruit on it, and handed it to Dean. “This is your breakfast,” she told him as she handed him the healthy plate.
Cas rubbed his knee and kissed forehead. “You’re doing great, Dean.”
Dean grabbed his middle, leaned forward and let out a loud groan. “Fuck!”
He turned around with a feeble attempt at a smile. “I’m okay,” he said as he rubbed the front of his stomach. He then noticed Castiel lurking in the doorway, copying Dean’s expression when he first saw the nursery. “Hey, Cas,” Dean said. Cas stopped looking around the room and instead locked eyes with Dean.
“The baby is born now. Its power is much more once it’s out of the womb, which means it’s more of threat. Especially when it feels threatened,” Cas said.
He rubbed his face as he got his bearings and padded his way to the hallway bathroom. He could hear distant voices in the kitchen. Mostly Jody making breakfast. The whole house smelled like delicious breakfast meats and pastries. After using the restroom and washing his face he found a familiar face drinking a cup of coffee in the kitchen conversing with Jody and Alex. It was Claire Novak.
Cas turned to Dean. “No, not a soul can know about this, Dean. If the angels hear about it then they’ll want you and the baby dead.”
“I can’t explain it all to you, but you cannot tell anyone!”
Sam stepped away from the stove to face his brother. “Then talk to me! What is going on! Why are you upset?” Sam demanded answers. “Is it the pregnancy?”
Startled, Dean clutched the baby causing Ethan to let out a small cry. Thankfully it was short-lived and he went back to relaxing on Dean’s shoulder. “Jesus, Cas. You could use the door, you know.”
“Yeah, preeclampsia. We should be home by this afternoon if we leave within the half-hour,” Dean overheard Sam speaking with Becky. “Alright, honey I love you too. I’ll see you soon.”
“Are you in love with her?” Sam let out an audible frustrated groan. “I mean you hide your little relationship with her from me--”
Claire hooked her arm around his to keep him upright. “Dean! What’s going on?” She asked, panicked.
Sam wanted to give him the laundry list of reasons why Dean was pissed off, but this wasn’t his fight. “Dean’s going to have to tell you,” Sam told him. “But we should let him rest for a while.”
Dean acted fast and threw his lighter on the oil, lighting the entire circle. The archangel did not look pleased to see Dean nor was he surprised. “What could you possibly want?”
Sam had just finished his workout at the gym. He tended to get in a full workout after he got off from work. He now worked as a professor at the local college. Jody was old friends with the Dean of Admissions and got Sam a job teaching pre-law.
“No, thanks.”
“No, that’s okay. I just wanna go back to bed. I gotta get up for work soon.”
But Claire wasn’t having it. “The hell you don’t! Something is wrong, Dean. I’ve already texted Alex and she knows that we’re on our way. She’s going to let us in through the back to keep you hidden.”
It was in the early evening when Sam passed the bathroom and Becky was putting the final touches to her make up. She was wearing a tight navy-blue dress and her dirty blond hair was expertly twisted in a bun. “Hey, you have a date tonight?”
“Nah, might as well work through it. I’ll be okay.”
He shook his head. “Not at all. I couldn’t sleep. What’s on your mind?”
Dean could feel tears prickling behind his eyes. He turned away to make it seem like he was cleaning the kitchen when he tried his best not to let the tears fall. He cleared his throat. “Thanks, man,” he said keeping his voice as steady as possible. “We might start trying soon, but who knows.”
They cautiously left their child’s nursery to be sure Sam and Becky weren’t lurking around and retreated to Dean’s bedroom. If Dean wasn’t pregnant, he would be ready for round 2 but he was exhausted as it was. Carrying around a 20-pound ball strapped to your stomach wasn’t a walk in the park. As good as it felt, he knew that he was going to be paying for it for the next couple of days.
A little disappointed, Castiel nodded. “Yeah, okay. Sure, Dean.”
Dr. Char glanced at the clock sitting behind Becky on the wall and then grabbed her notebook. The end of their session was approaching “I think that you are on a good path. But I want you to really explore whether you think shutting all feelings for Sam is the best idea. I think even in friendships, there is going to be some sort of loving relationship there, and it seems that you’re trying to avoid that.” She began to write down her final notes and soon stood up. Becky followed suit. “We’ll discuss more next week. It was great to see you again, Becky,” she beamed and then led her out of her office.
“Journal,” Dean corrected. “Were you aware that she is in love with you? Like full on head over heels?”
They spent the rest of that evening wrapped up in each other’s arms until Dean fell asleep. It was the best sleep he had gotten in months. He finally felt whole again.
Work was relatively slow which, Dean was grateful for. He could barely focus on any task at hand. As the assistant manager, he had to complete the schedules for the next weeks. It could be a delicate task if employees had put their vacation requests in, random request offs and days where they needed to be off at a certain time to watch their kids. But Dean didn’t care about any of that. He was tempted to copy and paste last week’s schedule to the next week. He couldn’t be bothered. He rubbed at his temples.
“Yeah, and I never responded. I just stopped talking to him. And I just told him that he could stay here to help us out with Sam. And he wants to talk, soon. So, I got no idea on how I’m going to deal with all of that.”
Sam thought it was stupid. The second it entered his mind he was aware at how dumb and needy it sounded. “I’m afraid that when she gets into a serious relationship, then she’ll leave me and the babies behind. That she’ll be so infatuated with her boyfriend that I’ll be alone to take care of the kids,” Sam said. It sounded even dumber coming out of his mouth.
Dean didn’t know his new size and he knew that he should probably buy a bra, and certainly didn’t want to go the store to guess the sizing, so they asked Jody to help out. She was happy to donate some clothes of Claire’s since she was barely home. She doubted that she would miss them. And to Dean’s surprise the clothes fit and looked a lot better than the baggy clothes he had been wearing.
“You have no idea,” he laughed.
Sam took a swig from his beer. “Just a werewolf hunt. Nothing we can’t handle,” he smiled at her.
Cas gave him an understanding nod, but he still looked disappointed. Dean brought him for a kiss. “Hey, we’re going to have a baby, I promise. I don’t how…,” he joked. “But we will have one.”
Becky could feel tears stinging her eyes. Before she could just come clean, she felt a hand on her shoulder touch her. “You ready to go?” Becky turned around to see Sam toting the grocery cart with his shampoo and conditioner piled on top. Sam looked at Jocelyn as if he was trying to register where he had seen her. She doubted that he remembered everything that happened when he was drugged. Becky was about to re-introduce them when Sam said, “Jocelyn, right?” he said without skipping a beat.
Dean shook his head. “So, you want to play house with Becky?”
The hunt was a few miles away. When they got to the motel to check in the clerk flirted with Dean and couldn’t stop staring at his cleavage. He was slightly flattered but mostly annoyed. He even got to use the line, “eyes up here.” Which amused him.
Sam ran in front of him to stop him. “Cas, stop! He’s sleeping. Jody and I took care of it.”
Becky stood by Sam’s side. “Is it time to push?” she nervously, asked.
“I understand Dean, I’ll go pick up the turkey today and get you a pregnancy test as well. Just make me a list of anything else I need to get.”
he had begun to plan out the feast that he was going to cook. Sam, of course, thought it was ridiculous to plan thanksgiving for 4 people this far in advance, but Dean didn’t care. This would be his first year cooking Thanksgiving and he wanted it to be perfect.
. Sam whipped around to a threatening, pregnant, Dean. “How long have you been standing there?”
Jody and Sam both exchanged the same looks. “Cravings?” Sam asked. “You never told me that you had cravings.”
Jody soon stormed in. “Guys, I don’t think the angels are coming back.”
“That’s actually what I wanted talk to you about too.”
“Sam?”
Dean couldn’t return the smile. He was in too much pain, emotionally and physically. He was feeling a searing pain in his abdomen that he could no longer ignore. It started on the drive over, but he was too preoccupied to notice it.
“What about Dean?” Sam repeated the question.
a solid and leave me out of this,” Gabriel said.
Cas must have heard him because he suddenly appeared in his office. Dean jumped up from behind his desk to embrace his boyfriend and plant a kiss on his soft lips. Dean eyed at the door to be sure it was closed. “Cas! You’re back! Please tell me that you’re here to stay.”
“Yeah, but as you said, I can rest in a car as long as you’re driving.”
Cas picked up a rather large bag with raw turkey encased in it. The sight of it alone made Dean audibly gag. He stepped towards the sink just in case he couldn’t keep his breakfast down. “Okay, step one, you do a dry brine, so grab the salt and peppercorns and cover the turkey in it.
Dean hummed as he poured more batter in the sizzling frying pan. “You seem chipper,” Sam told him as he poured himself a cup of coffee.
Dean was in his bed, being careful not to move. “Sammy, it’s no use. I don’t know what he’s doing, but clearly it’s a big deal.” Dean was lying on his side, which was the only way he felt the least amount of pain. “We’ll give it another hour. If he doesn’t show then we’ll call in some reinforcements.” And by reinforcements he meant Jody. There was no way in hell he was going to go a hospital while he was pregnant.
Dean was not going to accept any failures. He needed to hear from Rowena right away. He would knock down the gates of Hell to find her. Sam read about a way to summon any powerful witch in an old book. It was a long shot, but he thought that he should give it a try. Dean helped Sam gather the ingredients. Once everything was in the bowl, and Sam said the magic Latin words, a large cloud of smoke came from the bowl. Rowena appeared, wearing a gorgeous black dress with her signature smoky eye.
Sam was home trying to get his daughter asleep for her nap. Ethan already had fallen asleep and was tucked in his crib. Charlotte was having a little more of a difficult time. Sam had bounced her around the bunker in an attempt to get her asleep. She was finally nodding off when Dean rammed open the bunker door, causing it create a loud screeching sound that only heavy metal doors can do. As if he was opening the door to vault.
Becky walked toward him. Shaking her head, desperately. “No! Well—not really. You have to understand that I was really drunk and upset. It happened the night of my really bad date. So, you see that I was in a bad place and--,”
“I’m just saying. We’ll keep an eye on her. I’m not giving up on her, Dean.”
Jack looked around the room to gauge where he was. “Dean? Sam? Cas? Why am I here?” He then noticed Gabriel come into his view. “Gabriel?”
“I’m not thrilled that this is happening, by any means, but I also know that this baby is going to need a mother. The last thing I want to happen is think that I want you dead. Or that somehow this world would be better if you weren’t in it,” he said with a gentle smile.
“A couple of weeks, maybe a month or two if we’re lucky,” Cas explained. “Sam and Jody are creating angel bullets to prepare for the battle,” he told him.
“He’s good,” Jody said. “But I think he could use your angelic powers to heal his back. It’s just going to get worse.”
“Yeah, I am,” he said stifling a yawn.
“Say goodnight to the kids for me,” she added before hanging up.
Dean threw his hands up to stop Cas. “Wait. Wait. You told me Heaven agreed to the pregnancy. You said it was okay!”
Sam found her there putting her dirty clothes in the washer and folding her clean clothes. She steered her eye contact when she noticed Sam walk in. “Hey! I was thinking about going to the grocery store. Did you want to come with?”
“Castiel is being held for his crimes. Until the trial is over, he won’t have any contact with you.”
Dean shook his head. “It’ll pass,” he hoped. He would hate to think that his explosion of emotion put his child’s life in danger. He was just so angry at his brother. He felt betrayed by him. He thought that he would be on his side, but clearly, he was wrong.
In the house, Dean sat on the couch and examined his hand that was throbbing. It was a sprain. Claire approached him with an ice packet and placed it on his knuckles. “Jesus, we leave you alone for 10 minutes and you get in a fistfight with your brother. And Jody thought Alex and I had issues,” she mumbled.
Gabriel’s dead!”
Sam had grabbed the field army kit when he got out of the Impala. He put some alcohol on cotton swab and tended to his brother wounds. He had a rather large cut near his temple. He winced at the burning of the alcohol. “You did a good job tonight.”
She couldn’t resist his charm. “Ok, fine.” Sam helped her with the remainder of her laundry and then off they went to the grocery store.
“She said that she needed to get over me and said focusing on someone else will help with that. I’m happy for her. I want her to find someone. She deserves love, too. I’m just worried.”
Dean scoffed. “You’re talking to the pregnant guy remember? We’re not going to be normal.”
Dean chuckled nervously. “Not going to lie, Cas. I wasn’t expecting to be the one to have carry the baby.”
Dean turned around to walk away. “Stop it, Sam.”
Castiel grabbed the book and thumbed through it. “Why do you think you need this?”
“I guess we have to. And maybe we talk about a diet.” Sam had way too much fun saying that. And it was met with angry daggers coming from Dean.
The pain that radiated in his stomach was getting stronger. “Yes,” he groaned. He grabbed his stomach in desperation. With his eyes closed, he asked Dean, voice wavering, “What if I’m losing the baby?”
“Heaven? What is he doing there?” It had been a few days since Sam remembered seeing Cas around the bunker.
“Long story short, you got me pregnant when I was a girl and when I changed back the baby stayed,” Dean quickly explained to him. Dean pulled up a chair to face Castiel. “What are you feeling?”
“I’m sure you’re tired,” Cas said as he ran his fingers through his hair.
beer and yelling at the screen. “Kick his ass! Use that machete-,” he suddenly saw his brother walking down the bunker stairs. “Oh, hey. Beer?” he offered. Dean tossed him a cold one and Sam narrowly caught it. Still distracted from his experience in the gym parking lot. “What’s going on with you?” Dean asked as he paused his movie.
Sam cleared his throat uncomfortably. “Um, so are you guys like, together, together?”
“I saw you run off your treadmill. You looked really sick. I wanted to make sure that you were okay.”
She hesitated before answering but ultimately agreed. He entered her room and sat down in an empty chair that faced her bed, where she sat to eat her dinner. “First of all, I just want to apologize for what happened earlier. I shouldn’t have said all of those things. You were right, I wasn’t considering your feelings.”
Alex scoffed. “Good? Please, I’m surprised you’re still standing.”
“How can you be so calm about this? Aren’t you freaking out? Between the two of us, can we afford two kids? I make next to nothing at my job and you’re a professor at a community college,” she rambled. Sam glared at her. “Sorry,” she apologized.
“I’m on trial for going against Heaven.”
Sam went to the library and picked out every book they could find on witches and gender bending spells. They spent hours going through the books, but came up empty handed. Dean pushed the book across the table in frustration. “I can’t read this anymore this crap anymore. I say we call Cas.”
“No, Dean it’s your home. I had no intention of raising my kids here. I thought part of leaving hunting was…leaving hunting.”
“I’m just saying I think you should talk to him. Have a calm conversation with him. When you’re ready, of course.”
Sam glanced over to him with a worried expression as they continued down the highway.
Sam adjust his daughter in his arms. Now that she was awake, she couldn’t stop wriggling around. “Will you slow down for just a second and explain to me what is going on!”
Sam took a breath before saying, “It’s okay.”
Cas stroked Dean’s arm. “I’m glad that I could help. I know how much pain you were in.”
“No—that doesn’t make any sense. You--,” Sam suddenly had a worried expression on his face.
Dean sucked in a harsh breath. “Not sure I’m ready to answer that.”
Dean cleared his throat. “I missed you too, Cas,” he said with as little emotion as he could. “I gotta check on Becky. I’ll be right back.” Dean hurriedly ran to Becky’s bedroom to talk to her but she wasn’t there. He checked the library, kitchen and even the laundry room and she was nowhere to be found. Now he was getting worried. If she harmed herself, Sam would never forgive him. Just when he was about to get in the Impala and search the neighborhood, he passed one of the spare bedrooms and noticed the door was ajar. When he stepped in, he saw Becky sitting on the floor with her knees tucked into herself.
“I’m Dr. Aaron Nelson,” he introduced himself. “Don’t worry, I’m fully aware of your angelic pregnancy. My dad was a hunter, so your secret is safe with me,” he assured Dean. “Alex told me what was going on and sounded like you guys needed some additional help.” Dr. Nelson eyed Alex and she looked away bashfully.
He heaved into the toilet the chicken noodle soup Dean made to help him feel better. Sam wanted to scream. He was so tired of this. It didn’t make any sense. What the hell was wrong with him!
“Then we will handle it. Jody is going to stay and help us prepare for the fight. I need you safe.” Cas gazed into Dean’s eyes, cupping his face. “I love you too much. I can’t have something happen to you or our baby.”
If she were to talk about it, then she would have to reveal that she thinks that she is still in love with him. But she wasn’t sure if it was the obsessive love that she used to suffer from or the real deal. “No, that’s okay. I’ll figure it out. That’s what I pay therapists for, right?” she chuckled, nervously.
“I fear that they are getting close in finding Dean’s location. The more the baby grows the stronger the signal it gives off.  I fear the warding of the bunker is not strong enough for a Nephilim. And the more I try to steer the angels in a different direction, the more I become a suspect.”
Becky scoffed, “Hell if I know. But I’d like to think so,” she said honestly. “I know that we’re going to be in each other’s lives a lot and things will be easier if I didn’t have these feelings.”
She perked up at the mention of it. “Yeah, I was. I can heat some for you.”
Sam laughed, “I bet.” He loved his kids, but they were a dangerous duo. Sam has never slept so hard in his life.
“Have you talked to Cas yet?”
“Okay, you do that and I’ll see you in 10 minutes.” With that Dean hung up the phone.
“They are?” Sam didn’t realize they were that close together. It all felt the same. Just bad searing pain.
Dean laughed. “What do you think?”
When they pulled up to the house Dean was eager to get out to stretch his legs and get some proper rest. Jody was nice enough to offer them a place to stay for the night before their long trek home. She only had one spare room so Sam told Dean that he should take the bed and Sam was happy to take residence on the couch. Jody had found an old crib in her basement, and after cleaning it up the twins spent the night in it.
Dean groaned and grimaced. He placed a hand on the table and the other hand on his back. “Okay, you’ve convinced me. I should call, Cas.” Dean prayed to him and he did not show.
Sam turned to Cas. “That doesn’t make any sense. Why would they just leave?”
“Nah. Let’s just get on the road.” Dean carefully lowered himself into the car and let out a heavy sigh as his body hit the leather of the vintage car.
For the rest of the evening Becky locked herself in her bedroom. Dean told Sam how he needed to talk to her. She was not mentally stable and having her in a locked room was probably not the best idea. Sam politely knocked on the door, which she answered fairly promptly. Sam was carrying a tray of food. Dean had made some delicious beef stew. It was one of the only things that Sam could keep down. “You hungry?” Sam asked, presenting the stew. Even Becky couldn’t say no to Dean’s cooking. She nodded, and took the tray from Sam’s grasp. “And do mind if I come in?” he asked.
He managed to keep his distance from the angel for 2 of those months. They would pass each other in the hallway or see each other in the kitchen, but the bunker was large enough where he could avoid him for days. Although avoidance of Castiel didn’t make their situation any easier.
Dean did the math in his head. That would bring them to December, which was around the time he had announced his pregnancy. “You’ve got to be kidding me,” Dean laughed cynically. “You give this big speech about how you don’t want drama in your kids’ lives when you’re the one causing it!”
He lowered himself on his bed and groaned once his body hit the mattress. He was already feeling it. All of the excitement had also gotten the baby to suddenly become very active. He placed his hand where he could the most movement and rubbed at it. Cas joined his hand. “You haven’t felt the baby move, yet have you?” Dean asked, pretty sure he knew the answer.
They stayed in the room for a few more minutes before Dean helped her off the ground and they visited Sam in the infirmary. When they walked in Sam had his bare stomach exposed and Cas had his hand on it.
“Someone is just cranky this morning,” Becky said, playfully as she pulled the fresh diaper on her. “You must be tired,” she said to Sam. “I heard Ethan crying really early this morning.”
“Uh…,”
“I need to see him,” Cas said hurriedly as he tried to brush past Sam but his tall frame was able to block him.
“Please!” he begged. “The angels wouldn’t understand. You’re not like the other angels; I know you’re not. You have a mind of your own. Please do not tell them.”
“Oh, come off it, Sam! I think that Becky is a great mom and yeah, she’s less annoying than before, but how do I know that she didn’t do what she did before? That you’re not under her little love potion or whatever.”
Dean chuckled. “Neither. But speaking of which, I saw Becky leaving your room late last night. What was that about?”
Dean winced as he waited for the fireworks to erupt from Claire, but was pleasantly surprised when it got quiet. Eerily quiet… as he listened for any sign of life, Jody pushed through his door with a tray of food. Dean chuckled. “What did you do? Kill them?”
“The amount of power the child will yield is what the angels are sensing. That is why they are zeroing in on our location. Our baby is getting more powerful.”
“Good morning,” Dr. Char responded. She crossed her legs, opened her black notebook to the most recent page. “Last time you were here we talked about how Sam wanted you to move in with him. Where did that lead to?” she asked as she placed her book down on the end table.
Dean was on the floor with his back up against the wall, breathing deeply. “Cas!” he exclaimed. “You’re okay!”
Cas placed his hand on top of Dean’s and smiled at him. “It’s okay, Dean.” Dean’s slowly walked around the island that was between them and pulled Cas closer to him and kissed him. It was awkward at first—this was his first time ever kissing a man. But the quickly began to feel right. As if a hole inside him had finally been filled. Cas lips were incredibly soft and welcoming. Just like Dean imagined. Dean wanted nothing more than to prop Cas on the top of the counter and rip off his shirt but, he stopped himself before it got too heated.
Becky shrugged. “Something to do with Cas having to go back to Heaven.”
Immediately, Cas began to apologize and back out of the room. “Cas, wait!” Dean called after him, stopping him in his tracks. “I want you to stay.”
Cas kissed him back. “Good,” he said with higher spirits. “And as for how, I have a few ideas.”
“Yeah, one day. I think it’s part of the reason why Dean and I stopped hunting. Living normal lives means getting married and having kids. Well at least it does for me. Dean wants kids too but he’d never admit it out loud,” Sam told her.
Roussillon was a French restaurant and the nicest restaurant in town. Most people that went were either celebrating something or getting proposed to. Sam highly doubted that Noah would propose this early in the relationship, but he had money and loved to spend it on Becky.
“Yes, of course! I’m still hoping that we could wait a little on this. If I’m the one who’s going to have to do all of the heavy lifting, I want to make sure that I’m in a good headspace to do it.”
“20 weeks,” Dean said as he absentmindedly rubbed his bump.
, Dean thought as he cleaned up the holy oil.
“Not really, as long as you’re the one I’m having sex with, I don’t really care,” Dean whispered in his ear. He then gave him a longing kiss on the lips.
“Since he what?” she asked.
The office resided in a tall office building in downtown Lawrence. In the lobby of the office there were signs that led to multiple different levels that had other doctor offices in it. She always felt pretty fancy as she heard the sound of the high heels clacking against the marble in the lobby. She had been enough times that the security officer wouldn’t check her ID anymore and would simply let her up. Typically, she was the first appointment of the day, which meant the lobby would be scarce and elevator would be vacant. It gave her a minute to be Zen before had to endure an intense therapy session.
It sounded great, but Sam really didn’t want to live in the bunker anymore. He then replayed what Dean said to him. “…Cas? So that’s a permanent thing?”
He then heard Claire yell her response, “Hey! Hunting is a real job! Just because I’m good at it--,”
A few weeks passed and the boys still hadn’t found a way to turn Dean back into a man. Rowena still wasn’t answering their calls no matter how much they begged. So, Sam thought it would be best to keep things moving until they find a cure. Sam got back from the store and was putting away the groceries in the kitchen when Dean came in.
Sam found his brother in the kitchen making a snack when he asked, “Have you seen Becky?”
Dean could crush his phone. This has been nonstop lately with the trips to Heaven. “Heaven,” he responded curtly.
a Nephilim! How are you going to let the angels decide if I should carry one or not!”
was dangerous. And we can’t run that risk with your baby.”
Dean cracked a smile at his comment. “Fine. I’m going to bed, I’m exhausted. I lied; your kids were a handful.”
That next morning, he heard Becky on the baby monitor tending to their daughter who woke up needing a diaper change. Sam thought this would be a good time to get up and get his day started. Before he took a shower, he wanted to say good morning to his kids. Becky had Charlotte on the changing table and Ethan was beginning to stir in his crib.
“Cas! Out of jail, I see,” Gabriel joyously observed. “Don’t see any teardrop tattoos so I guess they didn’t rough you up too much, but something about you seems different.” Gabriel squinted trying to figure it out until he finally noticed it. He gasped. “Well, I’ll be. You’re human. I know that you’re in love with one of them that doesn’t mean you have to join them,” he teased. “And to answer your question I came because a deal’s a deal. I know the votes will be in soon and it’s not looking too great for old Dean-o here,” Gabriel frowned and looked over to Dean who was more than irritated.
“Fine. I’ll call her later and apologize. Can I blame my new female hormones?” he joked.
Castiel chuckled, “Yes of course.”
“Oh my God!” she gasped.
Dean heard his brother loud and clear. “Okay. I’ll back off,” he surrendered. He then took the duffle to her room where she sleeping sound in her bed. He placed it down on the floor next to her bed. He went to leave the room when he heard Becky stir in her sleep.
“Uh-um okay. I’m on my way.”
Sam saw the article as well and hipped checked his brother. “Hey, no fried turkeys,” he said sternly. Dean thought if Sam had a hand available, he would wag his finger at him as well. “The last thing we need is a fire in the garage.”
Cas must of have returned from Heaven just to speak with Dean and then rush right back. But why—Sam’s train of thought was interrupted by Ethan letting out a few warning cries before he had a full meltdown. He tended to his son and shortly after got the twins into the kitchen into their high chairs. Sam prepared some breakfast for himself and Becky to enjoy. She would most likely take hers to go since she was running a little late to work. After the babies were born, he decided to take a year off from teaching. It gave him the opportunity to spend time with his children.
Sam shook his head in disbelieve. “
She huffed a laugh. “No. You and me…why?”
Sam rolled his eyes. “Thanks.” He rubbed at his eyes. “I’m good.”
Dean agreed to it and she drove him to the station. Luckily, the area that she was going to was dead so they could have some privacy. Just to be sure she locked the door and shut the blinds. After searching the room, she found the sonogram machine and turned it on. She instructed Dean to hop up on the hospital bed located in the middle of the room. Dean lifted up his shirt and for the first time looked at his bump in a different light. It wasn’t fat, but a baby. His baby.
Sam had eventually passed out in his bed when he heard the bunker alarm go off. He jumped up and ran to war room to watch the security cameras. Jody and Cas were ready with their guns cocked. Sam studied the monitors and could see a woman that he didn’t recognize yelling for help. She looked battered. “Who is that?”
doing here? Is the gym haunted or something?”
“Going out to dinner. Just to get away from the kids,” he says nonchalantly, not trying to tip off his brother. It seemed to work because Dean shrugged it off.
When Castiel returned from the grocery store, he needed to use all of his strength to carry the bags into the kitchen. He found Dean sitting at the kitchen table with a mug of tea, that had gone cold, next to him and his head resting on the table. The sound of Cas putting the heavy groceries down jolted him awake. “Jesus—you’re back already?” he asked Cas, wiping the sleep from his eyes. He then eyed his watch; it had been 2 hours since Castiel left for the grocery store. Dean then realized that he had been asleep at the table for over an hour. “Wait, never mind…did you get everything on the list?” Dean began to go through some of the grocery bags.
“Yeah, but Sam,” Dean began, “I think you might be in labor…Cas said he saw you having a contraction like a half hour ago. And then you had the one in the kitchen. I really don’t think that this is false labor. Maybe, we should call Becky-,”
“Cas has enough on his plate, then to worry about me. He’s gotta keep up with appearances in Heaven now, thanks to me. He doesn’t need the added stress of my back.” Dean hated to feel and look so vulnerable in front of his brother and Cas. And with everything going on, he didn’t want to add to anyone’s stress.
He heard it again, but this time he recognized the voice to be Becky’s. “Becky?” He called out. He pulled himself from the tile floor inside the stall and walked out to see Becky in the middle of the locker room looking worried. “Becky, what are you doing in here?”
Jody hummed thoughtfully. “If you’re lucky. But I’m sorry about them. You sure you’re okay staying here? I know it’s a little cramped,” she apologized.
Ever since Sam stopped hunting, he would get the odd suspicion that someone was watching him. Every once in a while, he would get the same feeling when he hunted, but at least back then, he was able to defend himself. Nowadays he never kept fire arms on him. The boys even removed the arsenal out of the trunk.
“I’m not,” Dean cut him off. He was not ready to have that conversation. “Look, just forget it. What are you trying to tell me?”
“So, what’s this case you guys are off to?” Jody asked them. She had invited them to dinner. Sam protested but Jody wasn’t asking. She handed Dean and Sam a beer. “Anything you guys need help with?”
Dean could feel another wave of nausea overcome him. He grabbed a hold of the toilet as he braced himself for another round.
As Dean was about to give him a smartass comeback, Castiel sat down next to Dean and said, “Actually, yes she does. But I’ll take a beer.” The bartender gave Cas a once over and wasn’t impressed but he did leave Dean alone. “You okay?” he asked him.
She rubbed his leg affectionately. “It’s okay. I get it, I guess. Just promise me you won’t pull a stunt like that again.”
“Why?” she asked, genuinely confused.
“No! It sorta just happened. I don’t know, man. It’s hard to explain. One moment he was just Cas and then he became…. more than that,” he said as he thought about the first time, he viewed Cas in a different light.
,” Sam said threw his teeth.
Dean chuckled, disguising a sob. “I haven’t asked you yet.”
Due to the sensitivity of Dean’s pregnancy, he promised Cas that he wouldn’t leave the bunker. The bunker was warded against angels, so they wouldn’t be able to find him. To keep up with appearances, Cas would go to heaven so it didn’t seem like he disappeared, until he slowly stopped. He got too preoccupied with spending time with Dean and tending to his needs. He wanted to be there for the pregnancy, and if he went to Heaven, he was afraid that he would miss vital moments.
Dean carefully lowered himself into the chair at the table. Sam shortly joined him with piping hot coffee. When he sat down it looked like Sam could fall asleep right there. He had heavy dark bags under his eyes and his hair was in a constant state of deshevelled. “You look worse than me,” Dean commented.
Guilt suddenly overwhelmed Dean. Becky went out of her way to create an amazing nursery for his unborn child and he hasn’t been the best to her. He sighed, “Becky…,”
Seeing red, Sam advanced towards his brother, ready to strike when Jody came running out and got in-between them. “Have you two lost your ever-loving minds!” The heavy breaths of Sam and Dean were all that was heard. “Dean, couch,
When he returned from the kitchen, he brought her a bowl of soup as well. Sam took a few bites of the delectable soup. The warm, creamy tomato bisque slid down his throat and warmed his stomach. It was exactly what he needed after the past 24 hours. He almost moaned in ecstasy at the taste.
“As I said, we just wanna talk about this Nephilim trial,” Gabriel said. “Now, I know the results will be out soon and I don’t think it’s a secret that Dean and Cas are going to lose, but they shouldn’t have to lose everything.”
Dean continued to laugh, “Yeah, I’m fucked.”
“You have plenty of time to have kids,” Sam told her naively. He had no idea what was the best age for a woman to have children.
“Not at all. They were great,” he told them.
She wiped her tears. “I don’t deserve your friendship,” she said quietly.
“Did Dean do that? Why? And, where is he?” She didn’t recall him walking into the bunker with Sam.
Castiel nodded. “Yes, among some other things. You will need to drink this,” he explained to him. Ethan then began to fuss and Dean bounced him casually as if he’s done this a million times before. Castiel couldn’t help but smile at this. He loved how Dean looked with a baby on his hip. He was such a natural nurturer.
The distance couldn’t keep Dean from hearing Becky. “Of course, she knows why you’re sick.” He then began to advance toward her. “I swear if you did something to my brother--,”
When they returned from dinner it was pretty late. Dean was up still researching delicious Thanksgiving food options. He had a list that took up two pages of a legal notepad. He was now on the deserts and written down at least 4 different types of apple pie. He looked up from his research to see Sam and Becky practically smitten with each other. “How was dinner?” he asked.
“And by stupid you mean get an abortion,” he she said accusatory.
She moaned, “Uh—mhmm- I don’t want--
“…right. I want to makes things right with you.”
Sam figured that he just startled her. “Hey, I’m glad I ran into you before you went to work--,”
“Normal people carry guns, Sam.”
He gave her an affectionate kiss on the top of her head. “It’s good to see you too.”
“Hey, it’s 10am, don’t you think it’s a little early for a beer?” Sam said as he poured himself a cup of coffee.
“Yes, she is a dedicated friend. She’s not going to say anything,” Cas promised. But was also convincing himself. “Don’t worry,” Cas said, putting a hand on his shoulder. “I’m not going to let anything happen to you.”
After dessert, which was homemade apple and pumpkin pies, Becky got the twins to bed and Sam digested his meal on the couch. He asked Dean if he needed any help cleaning up, but Dean told him that he wanted to clean alone. Sam knew he was pissed about Cas not showing up so he didn’t want to push it.
“Who says you have to ask
Castiel looked at Dean with desperation in his eyes. It broke Dean’s heart. The love of his life was in front of him begging for a second chance. He just had to accept it…. but why couldn’t he? “I don’t know,” he said. “I just know that we can’t go back to the way things were before. We need a fresh start.”
Castiel had just put the baby down for her afternoon nap. He found Dean in their bedroom frantically looking around for something. “What are you doing?”
Dean forgot that Sam was even in the room, he stayed so silent. Dean nodded. “Yeah, I do too.”
Dr. Char crossed her leg to the other side, never breaking eye contact with Becky. “Well I got to say, I’m very proud of you, Becky. You were presented with temptation with moving in with Sam and you told him, no. You took some time to think about it and ultimately connected with your feelings to determine what would be best for you. That is major progress,” she commended her.
Dean’s stress was now at an all-time high. He thought that he would feel better once Cas came back. Cas was giving him the complete opposite effect. “Cas, I need you to leave,” Dean told Cas quietly. “Not just for my sake but for the baby. Your presence is just--,” Dean licked his lips as he tried to come up with the right words. “—it’s just too much for me right now,” he settled on.
Dean was still pretty damn skeptical about it all. He could trace of his symptoms back to a virus…except for the weight gain and maybe the cravings, but Sam had a point about all of the crap that Dean eats. So, he couldn’t understand why Sam went to such a ridiculous conclusion. “Sammy, I don’t know how else I need to prove to you that I’m not pregnant!”
“I underestimated the power of our child.”
He was glad that Becky survived, but he still has his doubts about her true intentions with his brother. He couldn’t get out his head how she acted when she forced Sam to be in love with her and marry her. Dean did admit to himself that she didn’t seem as crazed as she was before, but that didn’t mean that the shoe wouldn’t drop at some point. He had to protect his brother and the child he was carrying.
Castiel was looking off in the distance while he concentrating at the task at hand. He finally released his hand and looked at Sam.
“Right…” Dean took a big breath. “So, do you think I should just forgive Cas?” he asked his brother.
Sam momentarily forgot about that. Sam’s morning sickness lasted for a good amount of his pregnancy. It wasn’t until the last 2 months that he felt free to eat whatever he wanted without any repercussions. “Right. Ginger tea can be helpful,” Sam suggested. “Do you want me to make you some?” Sam offered.
“Okay, do you think he can heal you?” Sam asked.
Sam tried his best to keep up with Becky talking a mile a minute but he was having trouble. “Um..okay…that was just a lot of information at once. If you think that you’re ready to get out there then you have my blessing” he said. “Not that you need it,” he added. “But I think I’m probably going to stay single for a little while longer.”
“Apparently, Cas wants to have kids.”
“Looks like Mr. Healthy has finally cracked. When did you even get the cake?
Becky’s heartbeat quickened at that. She then watched him leave the nursery. Her complicated feelings for Sam bursting through her mended heart. She spent so long trying to get rid of them and now he was dangling this low-hanging fruit in front of her. She couldn’t grasp if she was angry or excited. It all felt the same.
“Dean, it’s not your fault that Cas has to deal with this whole Nephilim situation. Last time I checked; it takes two to have baby. So, it’s just as much his responsibility as it is yours.”
Sam finally pulled away with a look of disappointment. “Ugh, fine,” he said with a mock annoyance. “But when you get home, you’re all mine,” he said with his eyes undressing her.
Sam was on the opposite side of the room and through a quick glance, he locked eyes with his brother to tell him to, “Calm down,” through gritted teeth.
“Great, then let’s get out of this bunker and go grocery shopping,” he smiled.
Sam was relieved to hear that she wasn’t so head over heels that she at least recognized the importance of being home. Especially with Sam’s pregnancy coming to a close. But it was a big night for her, so he wanted her to enjoy it. “No, I’ll be okay. If anything happens, we’ll call you, so just keep your phone on you.”
Dean gave it a quick thought and said, “Yeah, we are. And he’s moving in by the way.”
Sam was pretty sure a blow to his face wouldn’t affect his pregnancy too much, but it could raise his blood pressure, which would have had some negative effects on him. Especially with his preeclampsia diagnosis.
“Because you drugged me and tricked me into marriage,” Sam muttered, defensively.
Cas agreed and drove him back to the motel. When they got there, Dean turned to Cas and said, “Maybe we keep this to ourselves, okay?”
Cas took a breath and then slowly rose from the bed. “If that’s what you want, then I’ll leave. But before I go, I thought you should know that the vote on the baby will be made in less than 48 hours. We don’t have much time to come up with a plan. But I’ll give you your space.”
“Fine then I won’t say it.”
Sam hadn’t seen Becky for weeks. She didn’t show up to gym, their usual coffee shop or the bar. He tried texting her a few times but she never responded. He was worried about her. She knew how sensitive she was. He would just hate if something bad happened to her because of him.
“I’m not sure if thanking me is what you should do, Sam. I put you through hell. Time and time again. Don’t get me wrong, I’m so happy that we have them, but I still feel guilty. No amount of therapy will ever get rid of that.”
Cas put the book on his dresser and then turned to Dean. He grabbed his hips to bring him closer to him. “Listen, Nephilim’s are extremely rare and no amount of research is going to prepare you. We have yet to see her power and when we do, then we try and figure things out, but until then…,” he seductively kissed him. “live in this present moment. Try not to worry too much.”
Dean was tempted to Kentucky Fry himself an archangel. “We’ve saved your ass too many to count and you can’t return the favor?”
Dean thanked him and then catered toward his unconscious brother. It wasn’t long before Sam’s eyes fluttered open. He groaned as he tried to move, but his brother stopped him. “Woah, take it easy. You just underwent major angelic surgery.”
She squinted her eyes at him in confusion. “You must be exhausted if you want to thank me.”
“Is everything okay?”
Dean chuckled, “Yes, there’s more. You sure you don’t want me to do it?”
“You know everybody keeps saying that, but I don’t think anybody understands what that means. I am a woman!”
“How’s Dean doing?” she asked, seeming calmer than before.
,’ Dean guessed. “So, now what?” Cas never went into detail about how a human and angel get pregnant. He would just say how it wasn’t done in the traditional way.
“He won’t talk about it. Hell,
“The one that’s sick?”
“Who says it’ll go wrong?” Sam challenged. He then softened his face. “Look, I get what you’re saying. But I want to at least give us a try. We’ll take it slow. We’ll do this on your terms. Like don’t think of tonight as a date, just think of it as us parents getting away from the screaming kids for a night,” Sam suggested with a smirk.
She gave him a once over and stopped at his middle, tempted to touch his stomach. “When Jody and Alex told me that you were pregnant with Cas’ baby I couldn’t believe it. I just had to see it for myself,” she said her eyes growing wider with interest. “You know, technically that’s my baby brother or sister in there since you decided to procreate with the angel inhabiting my father,” Claire pointed out.
Sam continued to bum rush Dean to the dungeon, Dean trying his best to fight him but Sam was too strong. “You can’t leave Cas like that.” Dean was now hitting Sam attempting to get him to slow down but he wouldn’t. He got Dean into the dungeon and closed the door. “What are you doing?! Get Cas.”
“And what about my family? My fiancé is stuck in Heaven’s prison and you want me to just take it lying down!” Dean argued.
Dean’s plan was crashing down on him. “What do you mean? You’re a fricken archangel! The angels have to respect you.”
Sam shook his head. “No, of course not…we just thought that it would be nice to have a night away from the kids.”
Dean had loaded the dishwasher and got to washing the larger pans when he heard the flutter of wings enter the kitchen. “I’m so sorry, Dean,” he breathed. “I tried to make it on time but the angels--,”
“He told me that he loved me.”
“Kinda…for now,” he said not making eye contact with his brother.
Halloween had just passed and the Winchesters were gearing up for the heart of fall. It was the first time in a long time that the boys decided to celebrate Halloween and Dean planned on a killer Thanksgiving. On November 1
The warmth of the coffee alone was doing its job in waking her up. She happily sipped on coffee as she drove to her therapist’s office.
“We need to talk. Where’s Becky?”
Dean looked up at his brother breathing heavily. “Cas didn’t get Heavens approval when he put the baby in me and now, he’s on trial. They won’t let him see me until the trial’s over.”
2 years ago, the boys decided to hang up their guns and live normal lives. Sam tried to convince Dean to move out of the Bunker, but Dean had considered it his home.
Dean continued to look at his body. He grabbed his hair and turned around enough to see his backside, which he was pleasantly impressed with.
Still upset with his brother, Sam didn’t plan to speak to him until Dean had placed a hand on the kitchen table and began to breathe shallowly. Dean placed his other hand on his lower back, arching his body forward as he tried to catch his breath.
“Accidently!”
“Thanks for helping out today. I couldn’t have done it without you,” Dean turned to face Cas and gave him a small peck on the lips.
“I don’t know about that,” Sam huffed a laugh. He could feel a contraction building in his lower back and then it wrapped around to his middle. Sam began to feel an unbearable pressure in his lower half. He bent his body forward, groaning through the process. “Shit, this hurts,” Sam panted.
“Something with sustenance,” Sam clarified.
Dean didn’t want to think about the status of their relationship quite yet. He kept putting it in the back of his mind the past couple of days. He left things so vague, mainly for his benefit. Every time he even looked at Castiel, his heart would beat so fast, he swore others could hear it. But he hasn’t decided if it was because he was still upset with him or because he loved him. Dean cleared his throat. “I’m not sure. I’m glad he’s back and all but, I just--,” Dean’s mind was suddenly flooded with all of the lies he told him over the past few months. “—he acted like everything was fine. He looked me in the eye and told me everything would be fine. That just doesn’t sit right with me,” he told Sam with a heavy heart.
“Nope. But he told me that he loved me.”
“What exactly have you told him?”
She was worried. She felt bad that she hadn’t been around a whole lot during Sam’s last months of pregnancy. He was carrying her babies after all; she should be there for every moment. On the other hand, she was trying to put herself first for once and she was really falling for Noah. Plus, Sam said he was okay. It wasn’t like he was going give birth in a matter of minutes. She had time in case he is in labor to get home and assist with the birth. “It’s fine,” she forced herself to say.
At Roussillon Becky and Noah were seated outside. It was a gorgeous evening with a gentle breeze in the air. The twinkling lights on the patio created the perfect amount of mood lighting in the evening, paired with gorgeous, soft French music that surrounded them. Becky wasn’t sure what she did to deserve this kind of treatment. This was the most perfect night.
Rowena looked bored. “Yes. We can all celebrate that you’ve got your twig and berries back. I’m leaving.”
“Who said I would do in the garage when we have a perfectly suitable kitchen.” Dean did everything he could to not crack a smile. He then let out a dramatic sigh before Sam gave him his BitchFace2000. “Ugh, fine, Sammy. No fried turkeys…this year. But who knows about next year!” he said with a wide smile.
“You gotta eat, man.”
Sam had dozed off in the library, head down on the table. Dean walked in with a tray of soup and rolled his eyes. This was getting absurd. He needed to see somebody that could help him. “Soup’s on,” he announced and placed the tray in front of him.
“You have no idea, Cas. And then you got Sam who thinks everything is fine and we should operate as normal, but I don’t want to. I suck at hunting in this body. I don’t feel like myself—I don’t look like myself. I just want to go back to normal,” he complained.
Sam felt good enough to leave Dean alone so he could attend to his daughter, who was just on the edge of a full meltdown.
“Don’t worry, she’ll probably kill me first,” he winced at the growing pain in his stomach.
Sam tried again. “Dinner? Me and you tomorrow? I’ll have Dean watch the kids,” Sam proposed.
Cas didn’t dare to speak. Even though Dean had a calm demeanor about him, he knew that he was livid. “I made myself sick with worry trying to not only save you but save our child. This was your mess Cas! And I had to clean it up, per usual. Except this mess doesn’t just affect me and you but also our kid!” Dean could feel himself getting worked up so he took a few deep breaths to calm himself. “So, forgive me if I’m a little upset with you right now.”
alone in that bathroom.”
Becky slowly backed out of the nursery. “I’m just gonna let you guys be alone,” she said and then closed the door to the room to give them some privacy.
Another timer went off on his phone that startled him. It was his turkey baster timer. He forgot that he set a timer every 30 minutes to baste the turkey, to keep it moist.  He had to get himself together if he was going to pull off a great Thanksgiving dinner. He rubbed some water on his face and got himself back into the kitchen to pull off a miracle.
The drive back to Jody’s was a silent one. Dean sat in the Impala while Sam drove and watched the car's headlights pass him in the night. After they got off the main road the cars lessened and the road wasn’t paved as well, bumping the car throughout the rest of their ride.
“Because I care. Is she okay?” he asked again, this time a little more desperately.
“Hey, I have an idea,” Jody started. “let me take you the station. They got an infirmary in there. We can check the baby. Make sure everything is okay,” she suggested. Seeing the baby could help change his mind about wanting to get rid of it, she thought.
She smiled in return. “Thank you, me too.”
“Dude, the stuff you push down just doesn’t go away. Talk to me, that’s kind of what I’m here for.”
When he got to the hospital, it was bustling with excitement. Nurses, patients and doctors whizzed by Sam as he tried to find his way to the front desk. Behind the desk was older woman who looked like she was not thrilled to be there. She barely looked up from her computer when Sam approached the desk. “Hi, I’m Sam Winchester. I’m here for Becky Rosen. She was admitted earlier for a suicide attempt,” he said all in one breath.
Sam gave her a kiss on the cheek. “Best mistake you’ve ever made,” he joked.
“Shut up…,” Sam rolled his eyes.
” he silently exclaimed.  He quickly washed out the sink and his mouth and glared at the turkey. “There has to be a way I can cook this thing without gagging,” he said to himself. As he tried to come up with a game plan, he decided to turn the oven on to preheat it and get everything else he needed to get Thanksgiving going. Once he was finished, he glared at the turkey. He felt as if it was mocking him. He didn’t want to call Cas to do this. He knew he could do it, he just had to get through it.
“Well he’s still asleep, but sure. I’ll get out of your hair.”
Becky put a hand to Dean’s back. “Are you okay?” she asked concerned. “Do you need to rest?”
When he got home, Dean was in the library watching old Chuck Norris movies on Sam’s laptop. He was on his 5
She peed on the stick and waited the 3 minutes that the box instructed. She waited impatiently for the test results. She peered over sink where the test sat on the edge. It took everything in her body to look at it. The timer on her phone went off and she looked at the test that read ‘Not Pregnant’ in the small window. She sighed. ‘Maybe it was for the better,’ she thought. What she did last night was the old Becky coming out to play. She would hate to have to explain to Sam that was magically pregnant with their child. It was a blessing in disguise that the spell didn’t work.
“Dude, what if I’ve never seen the movie?”
“Yes, I did. I had to go to 3 different stores, but everything you requested is in one of these bags,” Cas said, gesturing to the plethora of colored plastic and paper bags.
Sam sat across from him. “Talk to us, what’s going on in Heaven?”
Cas grabbed an aluminum foil tray and placed the turkey in it. He then grabbed the salt and peppercorns and doused the turkey in it, following Dean’s instructions to a T. “Okay, done.”
Dean rushed from the kitchen to scold his brother. “Dude! Seriously? There’s no need to tell everyone.”
“No. Chuck would’ve, but I refuse to be Chuck. The angels deserve better. You deserve better.”
Becky and Sam exchanged glances at each other that alerted Castiel. “Where is Dean?” he asked.
Dean heaved a sigh and rolled his eyes. “Can we not, Sam? I just found out that I get to keep my baby. Can I not revel in that?”
“Long enough to hear you say that you
“He’s perfect,” Sam cried, softly. Dean carefully took Sam’s son and placed him into a nearby bassinet. “I’m not sure if I’m ready to do this again, you guys,” Sam groaned.
He got out of bed and found Becky at the table in the library with the twins, each in their play pin having some tummy time. She looked up from her laptop, her glasses reflecting from the blue light protection. “Hey,” she said with a sympathetic smile. “How are you feeling?”
Sam stood there with his hands in his pocket. He awkwardly cleared his throat, but before he could say anything Becky said, “You didn’t have to come.”
Dean turned around thankful his brother missed him struggling to prep the turkey. “I –uh—got the turkey in the oven,” Dean said awkwardly.
“Listen,” Dean began out of breath, “I need for us to take it slow. Like, 2 miles per hour slow,” Dean emphasized.
Cas appeared in the room. “What’s wrong?”
“Did they take your friend to the hospital?” Noah asked concerned.
“I mean we can, but that won’t have anything to do with getting you pregnant,” Castiel said, slowly, slightly confused at the proposition. Cas handed him the jar.
Her head was pounding when she woke up. There were shards of glass all around her from where she hit the mirror. She even had a small cut in the back of her head. A slight concussion and hangover were a fun combination. The sun was peeking through the blinds. “What time is it?” she asked herself aloud. She fished for her phone which slid underneath her dresser on the other side of the room. When she touched the screen, she saw that she had a few texts from Sam, asking if she got home okay. Sam! She was then reminded of the spell she performed. She ran to the bathroom to take a pregnancy test.
For the first time Dean could see where Sam was coming from. She wasn’t as crazy as Dean initially thought. The way she wrestled with her emotions was proof enough. Before she would just be in denial and think what, she did was okay and have no remorse. She was beside herself about what happened. It was an impulse decision which he could empathize with.
Dean looked to his brother to speak up for him but he stayed complicit. “Fine,” he sighed.
Dean glanced over to the bathroom and said, “Morning sickness.”
“Who knows when that will happen. Becky said she was going to start dating,” Sam told him.
“Of course! Take all the time you need,” he reassured her. He took his hand and rubbed her arm. “No pressure.”
After turning her alarm off, she hopped out of bed, put on a pair of clean clothes and rushed out the door. She wanted to get to the coffee shop before her appointment. She was going to need some caffeine to get through the day. She ordered her usual, mocha late but this time she got an extra shot of espresso.
The pain in Dean’s side was beginning to come back. He put a hand to it and let out an audible groan. Claire put a comforting hand on his knee. “Do you need me to call Jody?”
“You tend to shuffle when you walk. And even more so when you’re drunk,” Castiel pointed out.
“And were you talking to Dean last night? I could’ve sworn I heard him too. Don’t tell me Ethan woke him up.” Becky began to get Charlotte dressed in a pretty pink gingham dress.
Sam’s eyes popped out of his head “Wait a minute! Stop!” Sam got in front of his brother in a desperate attempt to halt him using his height and stature to his advantage. “Think about this for a second. A shit ton of angels want you and your baby dead,” Sam frantically explained to him. Amid the chaos, Sam’s daughter began crying loudly, but he couldn’t help her and knock sense into his brother at the same time. He bounced her a little and tried to look as menacing as he could. He knew he probably looked ridiculous but he didn’t care. “Let’s think about this first before we run into Heaven guns blazing.”
Sam and Cas would try and help Dean by getting him ice packs or heating pads when he needed them. In the evenings, Cas would give him massages. He offered to heal him, but Dean had always felt weird about Cas healing him unless it was a dire emergency.
Castiel eyed him with disappointment. “Are you sure you’re not in labor?”
Dean’s eyes bulged out of his head. “Battle? Now there’s a battle? Cas, how did this get so out of control? I thought everything was fine?”
His hand clasped over his mouth, in utter awe. “Oh my God…did you do this?”
Becky shrugged. “I noticed that you weren’t making any strides to getting the nursery in order and I know that you’ve been going through a lot, so I thought I’d help out.”
Becky couldn’t help but smile at that. She quickly gathered herself and said, “Let’s just keep this between us for now. If this gets serious then we’ll consider telling him.”
“Yep.”
“You’ve been up all morning, sick as a dog and then taught me how to cook while you were extremely nauseous. That’s a lot if you ask me.”
A closed fist came hurdling towards Sam’s face knocking him back a couple of feet. As a reflex Sam touched his fingertips to his nose to see if he was bleeding and he most certainly was. The warm blood flowed out of his nostrils onto his lips, falling onto his chin, and then to his shirt.
Dean turned back around with a tight lip smile. “Guess not. Hey, I’m gonna take a quick shower before I tackle the rest of dinner,” Dean silently passed his brother and walked towards the shower. He then stopped at his bedroom and grabbed the pregnancy test on his way to the bathroom. He sat on the toilet as he pondered if he should take it. He wanted to wait for Cas and he knew that he promised him that he would wait until after dinner to take it but he couldn’t wait any longer. He prayed to him a few times to get him to join him but he never answered.
Just like Sam thought, they got to Jody’s right before dusk. Jody lived in a small ranch-style home in a quaint suburban neighborhood. Behind her house was a thick forest where she would enjoy watching the sunrise and set through the trees. It reminded her how much beauty there was in this world that outweighed the nasty.
Dean tried his best not to show emotion as Cas walked out of his room. He loved him, but he couldn’t deny how pissed off he was at him. How angry this whole situation made him. But he decided to use this anger as fuel to find a last-ditch effort to save his baby. He needed to think of a plan. He needed Gabriel.
stressful day, and it just put me behind.” Because Charlotte didn’t go down at the time she was supposed to, it messed up her sleep cycle. It also woke up Ethan, causing him to be cranky for the rest of the day. The laundry and the dishes became a total afterthought.
“Why do you think I couldn’t sleep? It’s the only thing that’s been on my mind since Cas told us. Becky, I wish I had all of the answers right now, but I don’t,” he sighed.
’ he thought. Castiel made it seem like it was going to be a battle to convince the angels to allow them to have a baby. ‘
Sam’s pregnancy was also beginning to progress. His nausea was still fairly present, but now he had to deal with his body changing. His lean frame had a small yet noticeable bump on it. Every time either Becky or Sam looked at it, it was a constant reminder of their child. Their child. But Sam didn’t have much time to dwell on it. He was extremely busy with work. Finals were coming around and he had hundreds of papers to grade. He had one last lecture to teach before finals. It was going to be an all-encompassing review of everything they’ve learned in the year.
“I thought you said that we’re never going to be normal,” Dean heard Sam say. He opened his eyes and saw his brother walking towards him with Dr. Nelson falling behind him.
“No! No, I love it! I really
“Sam and Becky didn’t wait.”
“Jesus Christ… and Jack-?”
“Good. I was worried.” She untucked her legs.
Dean didn’t seem intimidated by the angel. “I’m not leaving until I talk to you.”
“Morning, that for me?” he asked Sam holding two coffees.
Castiel let out a harsh sigh through his nose. “I don’t know how you want me to start this Dean. I want to say that I’m sorry, but I feel like that doesn’t mean anything anymore. So now I don’t what else there is to say. I just want you to talk to me. I want to start planning our future together. We do still have a future, don’t we?”
“Dean happened,” he grumbled. Becky and Sam walked and talked to the nursery to put the twins down for their nap.
Cas didn’t understand why Sam was acting so strange. It wasn’t like he was naked. “Yes, Dean informed me that he is pregnant. Are you aware that he was pregnant with a Nephilim?”
“Then I’ll give him an option that won’t favor him too well,” Gabriel said, a little more sinister. He noticed the doubt one everyone faces. “Don’t worry! I’ve got this,” he said, attempting to reassure the boys.
“Not if you don’t want it to be.”
“Sam…are you going to start hunting again?” she asked with worry in her voice. When Sam got pregnant, he assured her that hunting was in the past. He didn’t want his kids to know of the supernatural and Becky was happy to agree to this.
He thought on his feet and said, “I’m her ex-husband.” This wasn’t a lie. It may of have been an annulled marriage, but he still said ‘I do’.
“I think I’m going to start dating again,” she said, hesitantly.
She looked down to see the duffle bag. “Thanks.”
Already propped on the hospital bed, Dean smirked. “I won’t hold you to it, I promise.”
“So, you’re what’s causing so much havoc,” he cooed at his perfect daughter.
They were coming from the kitchen with ice water. As Sam’s contractions were getting stronger the hotter, he became and couldn’t stand it when either Dean or Cas touched him during a contraction. The less body heat the better. “Sorry, we made that mistake earlier and we didn’t want you to do the same,” Castiel said.
He then turned to Castiel who stood just as proud. Sam hugged him too. “You’re gonna be a dad, Cas!”
Sam put a hand on his bump and rubbed it. “Babies have been moving around like crazy and I have horrible indigestion, so I guess I’m okay.”
“My pants don’t fit,” he began. “None of my pants fit,” he admitted.
“Hey! They are here to kill you and your baby!” Sam tried to knock some sense into him. “I’m trying to keep you safe. Cas is going to be okay. But I need you stay
“You okay?” Sam asked, worriedly.
On the other hand, Dean was hyper-focused on finding a way to get intel on what was happening in Heaven. He had called out work more times that week than he had in a year to dedicate his time to researching. Something that Sam never thought he’d see his brother do.
This alerted Dean. “Woah, are you kidding? This is her fault! Why do you wanna talk to her?”
“We’re just friends! I gotta go.” And with that he ran out of the bunker and raced to the bar. He found Becky sitting at the bar next to a heap of used tissues. He sat on the stool next to her. She wiped her tear stained eyes. Her mascara had run all down her face. She looked a melted oil painting. “What happened, Becky?”
“That’s what I was afraid of.”
Dean was lying in his bed reading what looked like an ancient book. Cas could hardly make out the worn-out cover but he did see the words, “Nephilim” and “Protection” on it. He glared up from his book and splayed it in his lap. “Dean, can we talk?” Cas asked as he closed his bedroom door.
“Yeah. I need you to help Sam. He’s pregnant and I think he could be having a miscarriage.”
“Do you think it would work on Jack?” Dean sifted through the first ancient book looking for answers.
“Yeah, can I see her?”
Dean wiped the sweat off his forehead. “I’m not so sure of that. I’ve been feeling like this for days.” He plopped down on the bathroom floor and rested his head on the wall. “How am I supposed to get Thanksgiving together when I can barely leave the bathroom?”
it. It’s probably the best thing I’ve ever seen. Which, is why I know that I don’t deserve this. I know that you heard how I acted when I found out about you and Sam.”
“Friendship! Friendship! That’s all it is. Look she moved here a few months ago and we ran into each other at the gym.”
“I-I wasn’t entirely sure. I thought maybe you would carry it or something. I’ve watched Sam go through his entire pregnancy, and I’m not sure I could do that,” Dean admitted.
Dean stopped fighting back and let Cas push him out of the room. “Fine.” Castiel then closed the door and Dean paced the hallway. Emotions were at an all-time high with Dean. Not only was he on edge about his brother but he hadn’t seen Castiel since he professed his love for him when they thought the world was ending. He spoke to Sam about it, which he regretted as soon he brought it up. Sam had all of these impending questions for him that he wasn’t ready to face. As quickly as the conversation started, Dean ended it. The only thing he made Sam promise was to not call Castiel. He wasn’t ready to face him. And now it has been years since they’ve seen each other.
Dean didn’t find it funny. “Yeah I guess.” Sexuality was something that Dean thought he had a grasp on. He always favored women throughout his youth and adolescences. Hunters knew him from how great he was with the ladies. It was a running joke that if you were trying to score with a woman in a bar and Dean Winchester was there, you might as well leave. But this was new. His relationship with Cas has always been a caring one. He looked after him as he did his own brother, but lately the closeness has felt like something else. Something he couldn’t shake, and he wasn’t sure that he wanted to.
“That’s great! You excited?”
“Does that mean that he’s--,”
“Well, you haven’t looked at me like this before. You made it very clear that we wouldn’t be more than friends,” she said, recalling all of their intimate talks in the past.
“Jesus…,” Dean breathed.
“Just please take a seat,” Dean pleaded.
“How did you know it was me?”
Cas huffed a laugh. “No. Why haven’t you responded to any of my calls or text messages?” he asked crossing his arms.
“Dean, if I came in here 5 minutes later, something tells me it would’ve been an NC-17.” Sam sighed. “Speaking of which, can you guys watch the twins tomorrow night?”
“Not exactly.” Sam recalled Dean’s hostile behavior that morning, agitated at even the mention of Cas. “That reminds me, have you seen Cas lately?” he asked.
“Okay, that might not be necessary yet. Why don’t we take care of this vamp nest first and then we can brainstorm how to handle this whole thing,” Jody suggested. Dean agreed. “And given your current state I’m not sure it’s a good idea to tag along with your brother.”
She sat back down and they drank coffee and caught up on each other’s lives. And to Sam’s surprise, he was actually enjoying himself. He never thought he would have a nice sit-down conversation with Becky that didn’t end with a migraine. He learned that she was now working at a publishing company as an assistant. Which made a lot of sense since she did love books.
“So, we should get starting on making some angel bullets,” Sam said.
Sam, Cas, and Dean said the spell to summon Gabriel and they waited patiently for him to arrive. Luckily, it didn’t take too long. “Hello boys, I figured you’d be calling me soon,” he said with a cheeky smile. He then looked at his surrounding area and chucked. “And no holy oi,l I see? I guess you are starting to trust me!”
“Sam, I’m fine!” He used the table as leverage to help get himself out of the chair but his legs still felt like Jell-O, resulting in him falling back into the metal chair. Dean groaned at his failure, but then began to groan for another reason. He felt a sharp pain in his abdomen right under his ribs. He placed a hand to it, trying to suppress the pain. He hissed at the touch. “Oh, Sam,” he moaned. “…something’s not right.”
“Perfect you went shopping! I’m starving. You buy burger meat?”
Dean coughed and squinted through the smoke and saw a figure appear within the holy oil circle. It was Gabriel in all of his glory.
“And the trial?” Sam asked again, this time a little less patiently.
“You’re going to be okay, Dean. Just let it out,” he soothed as he rubbed his back. “It’ll pass.”
She had tried to hard to get that memory out of her head. The slight mention of it made all the memories come reeling back. “Yeah, sorry about that. I just haven’t been in the best place ever since.”
“Chuck?” Sam asked incredulously. “I-I guess…why?”
“Aww, you guys are so cute,” Becky said as she entered the nursery.
Out of panic Castiel blurted. “Dean is carrying the Nephilim.” As soon as he said it, he immediately regretted. If he could turn back time he would.
The boys took that and ran with it. They headed west in the small town looking for the car until they finally found it parked outside of an what it looked like to be abandon cabin. Dean parked far enough away from the cabin to remain undetected. He went into the trunk and picked out their witch killing bullets and loaded up their guns.
“I thought Thanksgiving wasn’t until tomorrow,” Sam joked as he watched Cas mix together the mac and cheese and place it into a glass pan. “And since when does Cas cook? I thought you were cooking dinner?”
In the library, Dean had Sam’s laptop and was researching some recipes to get ideas of some of the side dishes he wanted to prepare for Turkey Day. He didn’t just want the normal sides like, mashed potatoes, stuffing, and whatever green bean casserole was. He wanted something memorable and delicious.
Sam raised his eye brows at the news. “Oh, okay. Yeah, I’m cool with that.”
Cas’s face fell. “There’s more?”
Cas wrapped his hand around Dean’s waist to bring him closer. “You’re, Dean Winchester,” Cas said with confidence. “You can do
“I’ve just been so preoccupied with the Winchesters that I must not have been paying attention. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I will visit Heaven soon to assist with our next form of action.”
“No. You’re trying to make me feel better or whatever but did you ever think that maybe I’m okay with being upset?”
Dean recalled when he first met Cas and he had absolutely no people skills. He was only here on earth for a job, but he began to like humans and spending time with them. And soon fell for Dean Winchester. “I know Cas,” Dean said solemnly. “I know,” he repeated.
Becky wanted to feel proud as well, but she couldn’t. “I won’t feel proud until I’m no longer in love with him. Then I’ll know that I’ve moved on.”
She blushed. “Thank you.” She met his gaze and said, “I don’t have to go, tonight. Noah would understand if I cancelled.”
Sam smiled. “Oh yeah, a big one,” he laughed. “She’s a better woman than me. So, are you and Cas still going to have a baby? If so, I can have you take care of my son’s blowout,” he teased. “Might as well get used to it.”
Cas stared at him in a very stoic yet innocent way, with his head cocked to one side. “Dean, we don’t need to have sex to make a baby. All it would take is my grace and--,”
Noah touched her hand on the table. “Good. It looks like I get to have you to myself, tonight,” he said with a sly grin.
Dean laughed to himself. “Uhm, as tempting as that sounds, I think Cas and I are going to wait a little longer.”
Upon entering the bunker Dean questioned his brother on his whereabouts. “Yesterday you tell me that you think weirdo is watching you and then you’re like 2 hours late from the gym! Do you know the kind of horror shows I had playing in my head?!” Dean chastised him.
“Drugged me?” Sam finished for her.
Sam blew on his soup before brought it to his lips. “No, but I almost did. Jody stopped me before I did anything drastic.” Given any other day, he would never punch his brother while he was pregnant, but something came over him at that moment. He didn’t see his pregnant brother. He just saw a man that wrecked his face.
“Shame you couldn’t make an appearance at the reunion.”
Jocelyn stared at him flabbergasted. “Uh, yeah… I didn’t think you two were still together. Sorry-since I didn’t see you, I just thought-,” she began to back pedal.
“Shut up,” Dean mumbled.
Dean laughed. “I just find it funny that the man who side eyes me every time I eat a twinkie is scarfing down a whole cake.”
He was rummaging through his drawers, pushing things aside. “I’m trying to find—aha! Got it.” He said, holding up an old book.
