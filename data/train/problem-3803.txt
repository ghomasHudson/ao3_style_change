He's hauled up, insult to injury that the Seraph's vessel isn't even as tall as him, both arms clasped and shaken once for good measure.
"You were right. And I like him." Sam leans in to whisper conspiratorially. "But just maybe, get out of the habit of goading each other. Seems like he wins."
"Well I think this suits you better. Do you usually use product?" It's not the world's greatest conversation starter but it's something and Dean is almost desperate to chime in about Cas' perpetual bedhead and then move it on from there to how Jess does her own hair. Soon she's talking about maybe trying a change with a cut or some highlights and Dean can exhale softly, relax.
“That’s a name. Nice to meet you.” Dean laughs, lingering in the squeeze of warm fingers before they disengage.
He's only known Cas three weeks max and wants to think he has a pretty good read on him. Enough to trust as he takes a deep breath that maybe he won't get laughed out of the room and back to his mom's house to set her straight before next weekend. Cas has a good heart - anybody who took the bare minimum time to know him would learn that.
Also Castiel is apparently coming again because there's wet splashing on his ass and the back of his thighs.
“What?” His outburst makes Sam look up from his own laptop, expression curious. “Finally found a type of porn you don’t like?” He gives his brother an expression of long suffering that must look so pathetic Sam stands and comes over to the other side of the table, leaning down over his shoulder. “What is this?”
“If someone sleeps over with me then I’m in a relationship. Therefore it’s not a ‘morning after’”. Dean stares after Castiel does his one-handed air quote and then goes into peels of laughter. “What?!” He’s embarrassed and offended and anxious he’s being laughed at until Dean swallows his  mirth, expression effervescent.
Dean squeaks out a moan and then is gaping wide-eyed at Jess across the table from him, as he goes an embarrassing shade of red.
Cas watches him finish off three more pastry preps and leave them to rise before he puts on coffee and works on breakfast. The entire time, Cas is silently attentive and Dean's in an increasing state of arousal that's just short of indecent, but can't really be hidden in the clothing he's wearing.
"I can take a little pain. It's spicy." He says it to mollify Cas because he doesn't think he can take an apology from an angel and it sounded like one was coming. "I really enjoyed your fingers. You should do more of that." When he bends his leg and reaches behind, Castiel steps forward, all attention. "See..." He goes for two just to show him and Dean grunts, bites his lip as he forces them in and then moans once he gets past his opening. He sighs when his fingers are in as far as he can go at this angle and opens his eyes to look up at Castiel. "I can take it."
His mother, his brother, Jess, Benny, even goddamn Charlie had pitched in. The last one from Charlie had even been a guy because she knew Dean was bisexual and was apparently trying to run some sort of streak of finding him the perfect roommate, then the perfect boyfriend and then maybe the man or woman of his dreams - Charlie had aspirations. But anyway, no matter how good the dates seemed on paper, it just fizzled in real life.
"People and atmosphere Cas. Come on..." He almost says 'you can meet someone' before he swallows it back. The only sex he's had in the last two months has been Cas and he's surprisingly fine with that. He hasn't been fine with Cas bringing random dudes in their house though, so while the guy was entitled, Dean didn't have to put the idea in his head.
"Hold your tongue!" Oh. He is dropped unceremoniously in the middle of the corridor and treated to a look to level cities while dark blue eyes lit with righteousness promise him damnation if he so much as squeaks. He feels Castiel like atmosphere, heavy on him with the pressure of his Grace, the one pair of wings on this vessel spread wide and high.
by the way... You know it has nothing to do with you being gay..." Cas snorts loudly and jumps on that.
“That wasn’t the best thing I’ve ever tasted but surprisingly it wasn’t the worst. The lemon and asparagus combo is actually quite nice and the nutty flavour of the pecans is pleasant. I imagine if you actually used the garnish of additional lemon the meal comes with, you get even more of that tangy taste.” And he goes back for another forkful and sucks that off the fork too.
He and Sam chat too, but every time he hears his name, he jolts, Dean can't help it and tunes into the conversation again to make sure Cas is keeping the script rolling smoothly. Sam notices, becoming more and more amused.
"I'm - I'm really fucking sorry Cas." Dean apologizes, feeling scraped raw and this is why he doesn't like this talking out your feelings shit. "I shouldn't have done this..."
"I swear on Sammy - okay Cas? We get through Christmas... we hang out with Sam and Jess for Old Years' and we can "break up" sometime before my birthday so it's not weird. You won't have to do this shit for me anymore... but I just, you know doing this means a lot Cas. I'm so glad I met you."
“Uh - it’s… my textbook for Anthropology.” Castiel is standing awkwardly now, posture relaxed and huge book weighty in a one handed grip. He was now casually chatting to the B&E when he should be calling the police, because this guy still looked too comfortable in his chair holding his cat hostage.
The words "I hope you're happy." come flatly from shotgun of the car and Dean looks at Cas with a harsh sigh.
"You guys need to stop trying to find dates for me." That part had been fine. "I'm already seeing someone." That part was not.
“This dude I watch on YouTube sometimes - he eats weird shit when he’s high… but this time I think he’s going to die.” Dean responds, face still frozen in a grimace.
Dean's nose wrinkled. He wasn't even tied to someone in the top twenty? Mildly insulting considering he was eleventh in line to the throne of Hell. If he cared enough to clear some chaff he could be eighth even - but Sammy was seventh and he would not harm his brother.
Dean pads out in sweats and yawns out a 'morning' before shuffling past him for the coffee pot. Castiel has his head buried in a folder scattered across their kitchen island, cradling a coffee cup in two hands like it's his firstborn kid. When he looks up at Dean, he gets a tick of an eyebrow and a brief once over before Cas grunts at him and returns to working.
“Right. Yeah.” He looks across at Castiel and rubs at the back of his neck awkwardly. “If, by the way, in the light of day you don’t want to actually talk to a drunk mechanic who wandered into your home… I mean, I’d completely understand. But if, y’know…”
"I can't do this... I can't keep doing this." The mutter into his neck is soft, sounds hurt and Dean leans back on his heels, earnest. He meets Cas' shuttered eyes and is worried, pleads with him when Cas looks away first.
He gets a head tilt, eerie. The blue eyes squint before the Seraph answers. "I am sixteenth among my brethren. Twenty-third in the Heavenly host."
"Do not!" Probably a bad thing to smite face him during sex because all it does is make Dean hotter. He bucks his hips up, hurtling from excited to frenzied instantly.
"Look I'm sorry about how I was behaving after you brought to my attention we'd have to...be more physical. And Saturday was a
“Would you?” He looks beseechingly to Castiel and toward his little kitchenette. “A cup of coffee would be fucking awesome… Casteel?.”
Cas has been fidgety next to him all evening and Sam seems to be at the limit of ignoring it when he corners Dean returning from the bathroom and drags him back to the front of the house away from Cas and the others.
Now, he's here half naked in his house with a guy he met two weeks ago - who he happens to know from Charlie is gay. Charlie had felt that was something Dean should know in case it made him uncomfortable, which it didn't. He had appreciated the heads-up though it wasn't needed - Cas himself had said it like it was nothing to him during their first meeting to feel each other out. But back on track, he's here half naked in his house with a guy he met two weeks ago and even from the first time they'd stumbled into each other in the hallway the first morning, Dean in a towel and Cas in boxers, he hadn't felt like meat.
"Dean," Cas' voice is all deep warning that he blows through, stepping in and physically pulling Cas like a stubborn sack into the larger stall with him before closing the door and engaging the lock behind him. "Dean."
It was just that... something felt different. The kitchen incident in particular, as he had taken to calling it in his head, had been some hormonal outlier. Dean assumed it was leftover, pent up need from what had only been a frantic handie that had spilled over. They had returned home and one thing had led to another... It had felt unavoidable even in the moment, overcharged with Cas in his face, blue eyes darkened, asking again if he wanted this - like he would ever say no!
He has pastries to make, he sternly informs his erection, and thinks of less pleasant things to make it go away.
"Nothing. Man, I'm just…nervous too, I guess? I want you to like Cas?" Dean swallows and gives Sam what feels like a half panicked look. "I dunno...shit."
“Huh. You’re really passionate about that stuff.” Castiel meets Dean’s gaze and the almost lazy grin on his lips.
This is just one reason why Dean actually likes the guy. He's not a goddamned morning person like Sam was. There's like a good twenty minutes of blessed silence and coffee consumption before Castiel speaks.
He darts forward, faster than he seems despite being all muscled body, wings, claws and fanged grin. Castiel takes the hit of his weight like a champ and they go down in a tangle of thrashing wings, flailing arms and grunts. Surprise gets him enough of an advantage to swipe raking lines across the vessel's left pectoral, pleased with the red of shredded flesh and tissue even if it hardly bleeds. One arm is already trapped and it's his hesitation to go for the face, he likes the face the Seraph has, that costs him the mobility of his arms.
Dean makes grabby hands and Castiel hands his cup over, feeling as if he adopted a stray child. Dean is a slurper, he soon shows as he blows and quickly slurps and swallows hot coffee.
"Have you ever felt - I want to touch you with my Grace. I'm afraid I'll burn through you but I want, so badly to feel you from within, be inside you, become...part of you. Touch all of you."
It's a twisting reach for his own wing gland and while the spark of pleasure pain from Castiel's grope there had been enlightening, he couldn't make himself squeeze that hard. He massages, rolling his shoulder into it and sighs at the oily release that drips onto his fingers. Going like that gets him a lot more and he's almost relaxed, loose-muscled by the time his fingers are coated enough.
"...I just wanted to walk on my own without feeling like a sack." He looks down and away, brings his own wings down submissively and goes quiet. The ploy seems to work because when the hand comes back to his arm, he isn't pulled again until he gains his feet. He manages to stay quiet only minutes, frustrated with walking in silence. "Where are we going?"
"Dean...you're jumpier than a prostitute in a nunnery. What's up?" He snaps his attention back to Sam as his brother wipes down before returning to talking quietly with him.
"Ouuhh-ha! Uhhh..." Dean shudders, eyes squeezed closed because that was - fuck that was good. Good burn, stretch, right fucking there, just like that. He whines a little when the angel strokes all the way in and his body clenches on his fingers. Well shit.
When he looks back Cas is still sleeping but has tilted slightly like he's seeking the missing warmth behind him. The softened pout of his lips is suddenly the most distracting thing in the room and Dean can't deal with this right now.
Dean blinks, gapes a little and then laughs, a little more naturally as he sees humor in the curl of Cas' lips and the softness of his gaze.
Dean is in a state of acute misery when he arrives home late on Sunday. He had been grilled mercilessly about Castiel, his new
"Hi...Mrs. Winchester." Could he sound anymore like he was being held at gunpoint and wanted to be anywhere else? Dean mentally groans, worried he's not going to sell a bit of this bullshit. At least his family will definitely buy them breaking up though!
They meet in the bedroom and there's a pause after Dean steps inside and shuts the door, where they just look... before Cas crashes into him.
“Don’t judge me! He’s hot - when he isn’t eating things that make me wanna barf.” Dean pulls his laptop back in close to him defensively and plugs his headphones back in. He’s missed everything since the first forkful went into those sinful lips but this is the part he really likes to watch anyway.
"I thought we were." Cas says quietly and it's heavy, meaningful. His eyes are flicking all over Cas' face for a clue, something to guide him because Dean knows what he wants to say but doesn't know if he should...
It should only take a half hour tops to set up Sam’s cellphone to record the container in front of the two chairs they’ve pushed together plus change clothes to clean up a bit to look nice on the internet… but Dean dawdles, changes his shirt three times, decides to put some mousse in his hair.
The first kiss is hot, hungry and Dean moans into it, his hands fumbling now because Cas is drinking his concentration out through his mouth in increasingly forceful kisses.
"Really? Oh, who is she? Why didn't you - When did you -??" Dean heads off anything else with what he hopes is an awkwardly embarrassed smile but it feels duplicitous on his face.
"Okay. I stand corrected. He can handle you." The goddamned eyebrow waggle is too much and Dean bites out a 'shut your freaking cakehole' at a hiss. "Wow Dean..."
to Cas' back and a little too happy in his pants. He cusses under his breath and deals with shutting off the phone first.
Jess gives him a soft look that has his mind ticking over. "That's so sweet. So what are you planning on doing for him? I mean, the fact you live together already is definitely a bit sticky, but you seem so comfortable with each other. Something's working out."
“You sound like… a good guy Dean. When you’re not crashing into people’s apartments.” Castiel says it lightly and when he turns around he does not look at Dean. “How do you take it?”
The topic doesn't even come back up until Saturday afternoon when Cas is sprawled across the long side of the couch with Dean sitting on the other end, scrolling through his phone.
"I was hoping to be a giant shit, but eh. Better luck next time." Cas making himself comfortable, stepping into his childhood bedroom and looking around is pretty weird. It feels revealing and Dean ends up holding his beer awkwardly with one hand in his pocket when Cas finishes his circuit.
The hand that slides across the bed and tangles fingers with his shocks a gasp out of his throat before he can catch it. Cas, ever so sweetly, pulls their joined hands up to his lips and brushes a kiss across Dean's knuckles while he blinks and his mind goes offline.
Dean lasts up until Christmas Eve. Their living room office nook now sports a six foot Canadian pine with silver and green baubles and white lights but it doesn't feel Christmas-y. The mood is off and Dean wants it back to normal, or to at least feel like the celebratory holiday it is.
Dean shrugs again, this one more truthful. "We just hang out. We watch tv together after work, drink coffee together in the morning." Jess looks like she’s waiting for more and Dean just stares blankly until she sighs dramatically.
"Yeah Cas." He says it before he even lays hands on him, says it again when Cas hesitates at the waist of his sweats and murmurs 'is this okay', because of course it is. It's awesome.
He swallows the sound that comes with the discomforting twitch of arousal and buries the last twenty seconds mentally, buries it in the deepest grave he can find.
." Cas looks blown and Dean smiles, a tremulous, untethered expression of pleasure, fingers grasping Cas' skull, fisting his hair. It's good, it's good, it's so fucking good, Jesus Cas just....! He's babbling in breathless cries, gasping Cas' air in their nearness, light-headed and ecstatic and spiralling higher and higher until he snaps beautifully.
It was all that plus some serious unresolved sexual tension between Dean and Cas according to, basically, everyone.
“Fuuuck… I swear to God…” The guy takes one step toward the left, a staggered sway that makes Castiel’s eyes narrow. He prowls down the corridor, freezes as the guy huffs loudly and then almost dramatically throws himself into Castiel’s easy chair.
favor. Cas, who is looking at him with a hint of furrow on his brow behind his black rectangular frames.
He changes into another set of sweats, puts on an oversized t-shirt and tries to tamp down the pink cheeked, glassy-eyed look he's got in the mirror.
The past two weeks have actually been, more than tolerable, Dean admits as he rolls out of bed and pulls on pants. Apart from a clash of music taste and Cas' absolute lack of knowledge of anything pop culture, the company isn't half bad.
“I like it.” He turns away to check on the coffee pot which is finally starting to drip, a nice slow stream of lovely coffee, the scent of cacao filling the air.
Cas groans, fumbles his pajama bottoms enough down his thighs to get his cock free and slots himself between Dean's thighs and rocks, harsh quick thrusts that jostle Dean into the door. He's still flying himself and he helps Cas with groaned encouragement against the shell of his ear. Dean urges Cas on until he whines into the skin at his throat and grates out his name and dampens Dean's sweats again.
“Goodbye Dean.” The dry tone and irritated but reluctantly amused expression has Dean opening the door for the guy and Castiel brushes past with one last look before going on his way as Dean steps out behind him.
"Well? What's his name? How'd you meet?" Dean looks into Sammy's hazel eyes that are full of joy for him and feels like an asshole. He hunches his shoulders and looks down at the table, knowing he's digging himself into a hole and now is the time to escape...
Just the embarrassment of remembering his thigh being squeezed or the hand on his lower back could make Dean flush enough that, for the next two weeks as he made excuses for Cas dodging family get-togethers, they still bought that he and Cas were a thing. But it was the week before Thanksgiving now, and his mother was adamant that Cas make an appearance.
It takes Cas maybe three seconds, before his eyes narrow and he sits up, suddenly much too close to Dean.
It’s only a few minutes later when his skin starts to itch that Dean wonders about what was in the damned salad.
Though was Pada the hostage or the guy stuck under him still seemingly trying to not touch said cat. He was wiggling forward in the chair, trying to urge the cat off by moving but all Pada did was shift his body and look back into the man’s face with a demanding reprimand.
"...are you incapable of being silent?" Dark eyebrows furrow over a darker frown as the Seraph stares at him and Dean bites his lip hard against a retort about the different ways he can be gagged. He lasts ten seconds.
He would have enjoyed his "hard"-won freedom even more he supposed, with Castiel there to torment just a little. But now it's eight days later and Dean's itching like a junkie for a fix and his hubby is still conspicuously absent. It's actually grounds for him to contact the damned angels himself and expose his inattentive minder... but he,
"Maybe you shouldn't judge a book by its cover Sammy." Dean clips out, hopping up onto the kitchen island stool and watching his brother prepping something with too many vegetables in a casserole dish. "Besides, he's...super nervous. Almost had a freak out in the driveway."
The good thing about being Bound - okay, the other good thing apart from the sex - since you had your own personal angel to track you, the Heavenly Host on a whole tended to not mind you so closely.
“Oh!” And Dean looks shocked, shocked and pleased as Castiel drinks another sip of coffee, blushing and self-satisfied. “Right. Well, I feel very awake now.” With a nervous cough, Dean stands, a pink tinge to his cheeks. “Umm…”
Dean narrows his eyes at his brother and is about to say something not nice when Cas comes into the hallway. He pauses in the door frame before walking toward them, what little friendliness that had been on his face from Jess and his mom wearing off, leaving a brittle smile.
"Imagine getting to the bottom of the stairs to mom and Jess standing awkwardly looking at your door. And when I asked one of them to call you about breakfast, getting a blush from my girlfriend that you sounded
"Did you lead that Wendigo away from those hunter traps Dean?" There went the mood. Two human hunters had died a couple days ago to a Wendigo that Dean had, maybe, sort of, kind of...helped. Castiel's superiors apparently had been paying attention to Dean in Castiel's absence.
." He tightens his arms around his angel's neck and smiles into his skin, kissing softly before Cas releases again, gasping out loud, hands scrabbling at Dean's wings.  Being filled to overflowing might be a new kink with his angel, Dean ponders as the slightest shift makes them squish stickily. "...please."
He nods jerkily, bracing himself. He can do this, he can do this! He swivels the stool back around and tries to relax as Sam joins the others at the table, the conversation still moving along. His hands are fucking clammy, so Dean scrubs them up and down his thighs anxiously.
“It’s my Master’s actually. I’m twenty-six and offended. Anthropology isn’t an ‘old-people’ focus, if that’s what you were implying.” He squints, mouth pursed in displeasure as he clicks down the spoons in his hand.
He's so goddamn nice, that's genuine worry in Cas' voice right there, Dean thinks, wondering if they're good enough friends for what he's about to ask.
Cas tilts his head and looks at Dean so bluntly he almost wants to hide. "Are you really this - " He squints disbelievingly while Dean shuffles on his feet.
"Oh my God. You'll do it?" Cas rakes a hand through his bed-head hair, disorganizing it even more, before fisting a clump of it while looking at Dean.
"Dean I'm not in the mood." Dean can hear the air quotes and he grins winningly, pulls Cas' legs straight across the couch to him and then straddles him. He sits on Cas' thighs easily and waits as he peers up at him, gaze quizzical behind his frames with confusion on his brow. "What do you want from me?"
"I'm not the one who can't even look me in the eye. Every time today I tried to even engage you to try to smooth over what could maybe pass as a small tiff, you've looked at me like I've mortally offended you - so don't give me any shit about ruining the holiday for you." Cas spits back,  low and angry, and Dean gapes at him, temper flaring fast and high.
"...sorry?" The only part of him he's able to move is his head and he doesn't know what the expression on his face even is but he hopes it conveys that Castiel is stupid.
"Sammy. Oh, and there's your much better looking half. Hey Jess." He doesn't know why or how this gorgeous woman is settling for Sam, but he’s damned lucky to have her. Dean releases Cas and steps past his mother to give Jess a hug when she comes to meet him in the hallway. He hugs her tight, with a little spin.
"Dean was just helping Castiel fix his hair." His mother decides to contribute and Dean chokes out a sound of embarrassment. But Sam must have taken pity and decided to pass up on the low hanging fruit because of how mortified he looks.
So what if fighting got him a little hot under the holy collar? He didn't expect prude angel to know. But he does. Angel's aren't the only ones with oil production glands and the free hand on stone-face is freaking squeezing his gland until he squeals - he'll deny it!, and the release is a relief, right up until his sopping hand is between Dean's cheeks, two firm fingers at his hole.
"It's not like even if a human found me they can see my wings Cas." He quirks an eyebrow at his husband and instead pats the ground next to him. "Come on."
Dean manifests his wings wordlessly, quivers while staring into Cas' blue, blue damned eyes and forces himself - it's not his denomination, he doesn't identify as it, forces himself to submit, spreading his wings wide, fragile inner lining skyward.
He's not subtle. Neither is the flush on his chest that's quickly rising up his neck. But maybe Cas doesn't notice as he sits down at the kitchen table, chair angled to watch Dean.
"Well, he probably didn't want to not show up again during the holidays since he's missed our last couple of weekends." Sam leans into him, squeezing reassuringly. "It's no secret family is pretty big around here, so don't be mad at him that he came. He came -
it." And that's good enough. He climbs into Cas' lap while his angel waits, works him carefully in where he's still open just a little and moans, biting his lip as he rocks down onto him. Ever helpful, Cas flares his wings, settles his hands on Dean's hips and waits patiently through Dean's minor discomfort.
Sam looks genuinely surprised, almost blown away while his mother looks shocked and then slowly excited.
"I can't... I can't manage you Dean." Castiel spreads his arms, smiles suddenly and opens eyes the color of the sea. "You are responsible for the unplanned deaths of two humans who are apparently very important and my response to my superior was 'so what?'"
"Dean! And you must be Castiel!" Cas' eyes go wider, a panicked flare that has Dean wincing before Cas summons some inner reserves for a truly awkward smile.
“God,” Dean finally slows to breathe, almost panting and Castiel is sure his tongue must be burnt. “Perfect cup of coffee Cas. You’re such a nice morning after - is it morning yet?”
“Oh God.” Dean pulls a face and turns away from the laptop, feeling skeeved out. He shudders, pulling off his headphones.
Despite the charged atmosphere of that night, Monday is a new leaf, and they quickly  fell back into old habits. Almost immediately, Dean forgave Cas for the agony he put him through.
"The building of sensation, the repetition of it to the area your hand is currently around, in conjunction with the pressure and heat..." Cas pauses, seems to struggle with his explanation. "The feeling of knotting is bewildering but after is... nice. Very nice." Dean's shocked at the smallest upturn of the corners of the angel's lips and how his eyes go soft. "It's like home, out of this...thing. Maybe like sunning." He blinks down at Dean, absently brushing his fingers over Dean's collar. "Do you sun?"
"Ahhh...fuck!" Good, good, good! Got his sweet spot by accident and he's rolling his hips into it now. Dean squeezes his eyes shut and fingerfucks himself a little harder, hoping to graze that spot again just right because he thinks he can fucking pop off from just that.  He's not expecting the restraining hand on his shoulder that almost breaks his rhythm, shifts the trajectory of his fingers - just fucking right!- or the lots-less-painful-but-still-quite-intense squeeze of Castiel's fingers at the nub of his right wing gland.
"And why would who I fuck matter Dean?" Cas sits up in the bed, glare eviscerating. "What does that have to do with the facade? Do you have some stake in my personal life that I'm
Then Cas had decided he wanted to drink the bar. He'd had a flurry of cocktails; mojitos, margaritas, sweet shots... and then found Dean on the dance floor.
"None of my business what you do by the way but pretty sure you've spoken more to whoever the hell he was than you have to
"You've been unconscious for approximately forty minutes Dean." Cas looks apologetic, a bit nervous as he looks around. "I was afraid I had driven you out. We have to go."
It takes a while for Dean's higher functions to work again but as soon as he thinks he's able to speak without drooling or moaning, he quips out.
“No, wrong… door? Building? I don’t even know.” Why does he feel wrong-footed?! This guy had just broken into his apartment drunk! “Please, just push Pada off your lap and… you know, leave.”
"You are falling into the trap before you've even begun, Dean. Just because it's comfortable doesn't mean you should take your interest in each other for granted. Yes, you live together. But take him out on dates, go watch a movie in a theatre or have a nice dinner out once in a while."
"Okay angel. Let's make it good for you." Cas frowns like he's about to say something to correct Dean, so he shuts him up. He wraps his arms around his neck and kisses him, soft and teasing like he's done, seen done too, to so many humans, before biting on Cas' lip harshly. Cas just grunts when he makes him bleed but his lips spread and win. Dean's in and kissing him dirty, slow and filthy before he starts to rise.
He feels when Cas sidles up next to him and half turns to include him in the mix. "Ah, yeah. So, Cas…umm…this is my brother Sam and his girlfriend Jessica. Guys, this is Castiel. You already met my mom."
"The sensations, lead to pleasure I suppose? The knotting and marking you was - different. Good, different." He says the last quietly like a guilty confession and Dean smirks.
"I'd say marry me right now but we're already kind of married." Dean says in awe, probably the closest thing he'll ever feel to love beating in his chest. He means it - the collar is gone but Cas' Grace is a part of him forever.
Castiel gapes, goes limp with shock and Pada frees himself, jumping from his arms to the relatively close safety of the loveseat. Castiel stands there, fidgety and unsure before he steps back close and - he was not taking advantage! - pushed at the guy’s bicep, a little poking motion.
"Uhh, yeah." A note creeps into Sam's voice and he stares harder at the table. Castiel is just as silent, almost somber beside him and Jess, bless her heart cuts the tension and starts passing around the serving dishes.
Dean waits a moment before looking back at Cas, who has abandoned his tv show in favor of tilting his head to look up at Dean. He's quiet for a few moments more before he speaks softer, private. "I just want to make sure it won't ruin...
"Hello. You look like shit, by the way." Dean barks out a laugh as he rubs a hand over his face and practically collapses onto the couch next to Cas. "Are you okay?"
He squints up into the bright daylight, shrugging off the guilt that he probably just threw a business card into the wind as the things weren’t freaking cheap but sucks it up and focuses instead on where he can get wrapping paper for Maddy’s birthday.
"Aww Dean." There's an affectionate mockery in his tone that makes him flush uncomfortably, up to his neck. "Baby bath photo - Mary said you kept your flower bather as a binkie." There's laughter in his tone and Dean feels the blush creeping higher.
"It is actually a work thing. But because Charlie believes I need to 'socialize' more, I'm supposed to stay until the end." Cas sounds very put out about that and Dean sticks his head back into the kitchen just to see the almighty frown on his face. Castiel's expressions are - well. Dean lives for them. "As a matter of fact, I am very sure you've had more dates in the two weeks I've been here than I've had in the past two months."
"I tried for you. Of course I'd try for you Dean." Cas gaze meeting his is resolute, a promise and it's amazing to have this devotion already in such a new friend. They're so close Dean can see the dilation of Cas' pupils, hear the hitch in his breath when Dean's eyes flicker down to his mouth. "But we should have known this wouldn't work..."
“Hey,” He only knew the guy was dejected really by the slightest curve in of his shoulders and because he saw what happened before. Looking into his face though at Dean’s greeting, he is composed, gaze measured and steady as he turns his face up slightly. Dean’s next inhale is sharp at the brilliant blue of this guy’s eyes, a shade so different from the woman he had just left and frankly stunning. He’s never seen anyone with that intense of an eye color before.
Dean gets sick of Sam yapping about two minutes later and rolls his eyes. “Oh for God’s sake!” He picks up his fork, stabs the monstrosity that’s been sitting in front of them and sticks the entire glob he’d managed to get off into his mouth.
"It's - I'm..., Dean." The hand that clamps around his arm is no bigger than his own but he feels it down to his bones. "Ow, ow, fuck ow!"
He blinks vacantly at the lap of the angel sitting right in front of him - how do you forget your husband's giant dick? Sacrilegious. Dean shakes out his deadened arm, pulls his fingers from himself with a satisfied sigh and grabs onto Cas' cock with both hands.
“A live response?” Dean ponders for a second. “I mean literally, one tiny ass bite and you eat the rest of it to impress him.” Sam grins at him and the deal is set.
"I'm tired. I think it's time to get some sleep." Dean takes the light punch from Sam in the shoulder as he steps back to give Cas room with Dean by the stairs.
"You don't see why we might need some distance Dean?" Cas' voice is getting softer, lower as all the animosity leeches out of him and it's like they're linked, how it flows out of him too.
in the past thirty-six hours! I don't know but you're not inspiring the atmosphere for a loving couple - just saying."
"Jesus, Cas. The lack of faith, by the way, is insulting." Cas shrugs a shoulder and leans back into the couch, stretching along it in a way that's effortlessly casual.
"There is nothing to tell." He clears his throat once, almost dramatic. "I realized I was remiss in my duty to you so I returned to...see, if you had need of me."
"Bitch." Dean pushes out of his chair and leaves the other half of his beer. "I'm tired of your face."
"I may be back late tonight." Sometimes he's still caught off guard when that voice comes out of that package. Cas looks like he should be a reclusive nerd, slight and messy-haired and with squinted vision when he wasn't wearing his contacts or glasses that made Dean suspect he was short sighted. However apart from being slightly taciturn, Cas was alright. The dude sounds though like he gargles rocks and smokes a pack a day, in a damned good way. He brushes off the jolt at Cas' pronouncement with that voice and waves a hand negligibly, taking his coffee with him to his home office nook. It's just a corner of their open space living room though so Cas can still hear him when he calls out.
"Oh, Dean." Cas lowers his head into both hands and Dean's at a loss as to what the big deal is. "You didn't think your family might,
"I do understand the merits of that saying about watching someone go but I prefer the view if you'd stayed. Positively eye-catching."
By the time they set up Sam’s sick of him and Dean’s a nervous wreck trying to get out of frame, because this was a bad idea. What were the chances Castiel would care about two guys giving a video response to his food review? Why were they doing this?
He makes the decision without conscious thought that he's not going to initiate anything with Cas, he'll just wait. If the ball's in his court, Dean can't misstep, he can only respond to what Cas gives him.
They become locked in some staring battle of wills and Dean is who breaks, eyes downcast as he blushes.
Something was missing. He wasn't being picky deciding on the first date that things wouldn't work... he just knew.
"Okay, Dean. Whatever you say, Dean." He turns to Dean's mom and gives her a tentative hug while balancing the half pie she'd Tupperwared for them. "Thank you for having me."
"We had a fight Sam! He didn't even want to come here today! And like I said I didn't do shit to him!" His voice is rising and Dean bites back more angry retorts as he thinks about Cas bringing a guy into their house last night but somehow ...
He kind of wanted to die, remembering Cas dancing behind him and the very, very obvious package he'd had. But he'd stuck it out, because Cas was trying to prove a point and while he understood it, Dean would prove he could make it through.
He's putty, desperate already, so he barely croaks a weak protest when suddenly the angel huffs into his neck, heating the skin around his Binding collar and a foreboding swelling start just past the rim of his anus. "Oh...my...GUHHH!" There's the tiniest of stutters in Castiel's movements, a soft hitched breath and then a shuffle of their bodies that pushes Dean, unforgiving, into the wall. "Huh!"
"What are you showing him!" All three of them turn to look at him and he ignores Sam's smug face and his mother's slightly guilty smile in favor of Cas' grin.
"Oh." He's staring at the side of Dean's face while he pants and writhes himself breathless, drunk on pleasure. And then he doesn't have to urge him anymore. There's almost a monotony to the rhythm of Castiel's thrusts but the predictability helps drive Dean mad, especially when he gets to the point of whimpering, desperate for just a bit faster, harder, something!
But then it's after one am on Wednesday and people are stumbling into the house, too many feet to be just Cas. Dean reaches under his pillow for the knife he keeps there (long story), and sits up as they come down the hallway, but then he hears Cas' voice, ragged and hoarse and low as sin.
“... wouldn’t mind going out with you again - umm, if you want to call me -” Whoever deep-voiced guy is down the hall with his coat rolled up in his hand and his tie hanging crooked off him, he’s dead out of luck. The guy shoots him down quickly and closes the door and Dean gets back to his own self-extraction.
"Sometimes I really - you're impossible Dean." Dean's wide-eyed, stunned at the flat vitriol of Cas' muttered declaration before he looks up and pierces Dean with all the deepest blue his eyes are. "I'm..." Cas rubs his hands over his face frenetically, glasses pulled off. "You know what? Let's just go. Let's do this."
"Fucking bastard." There's a breathless awe in the slur because while he'd been warned, hyped up about knots, he hadn't been told about this barely manageable girth and he wonders if it's typical or just Castiel. "Come on." It comes out a breathy whine but he's good, thinks he can handle it now and twitches his hips again.
"They, my superiors, Raphael... have decreed you be unbound, from me." Castiel whispers it, grave, flat-toned."Gabriel only has one Bound to him. He can handle another as an Archangel." Dean meanwhile is flabbergasted, disbelieving. So he had one tiny indiscretion and they're 'removing' him from Cas? "I failed my duty."
"It was working so well." He strangles out. "I mean, indefinitely they would never have tried to set me up again. I think my mom wants to adopt you, and Sam just loves to torment me about how I'm supposedly whipped." Dean lets it all out in a flood. "So, why would I break up with you? They'd just feel sorry for me and wonder how I'm surviving still living with you and either try to get us back together or... Christ knows. So... yeah. I figured not breaking up made more sense."
“I wouldn’t know.” Oh, his voice was still gravel low, growly and Dean had thought he’d been choked up when he said ‘hello’ but apparently that was this guy’s voice. “I don’t… make a habit of sleeping out with people on my Saturday night.” Ouch, Dean physically leans back from the assumption, offense quickly rising. The guy tucks his head in and walks past him, his coat clenched in his hand and Dean feels for him suddenly.
So it kind of comes out of his mouth without him meaning to say it. He's at home, his childhood home, with his mom and Sam for their usual Sunday get-together. His mom's lamenting about how his date the week before with Lauren had gone and how Lauren's mother, her friend, was sad they hadn't hit it off since Lauren had spoken nicely about him.
." Their lips meet just as desperately, Cas tugging him by the hair and moaning into his mouth. Dean gasps and is plundered in deep thrusts and slick battle and tiny sips that steal his breath away for what feels like hours or centuries.
Just last week he'd managed to get Cas out to a game night with him, Charlie, Jo and Benny. Sorry and Taboo had been fun, but Cas playing Cards Against Humanity had been legendary. They had planned a night-out at the bar for this week. Cas had told Charlie that he
He knows he fails from how Sam's eyebrows immediately jack up into his hair when Dean sits himself silently at the table and thumps down his beer bottle. He can only imagine how he looks from the smile Jess is trying to contain and Sam's continued staring.
, to afterward try to invite Dean back to his place like he had expectations because he'd paid. The indignation Dean had felt had carried all the way home until when he told Cas about the entire awful thing, Cas had said ever so dryly that Dean should have told Jared about his 'no service tip, no service' rule.
"Sammy and Mom were going to set me up on another date, Cas! And I remembered what you said about telling them to just give me space but - I know my family! They weren't going to settle for me just saying I was good so, I panicked. I'm sorry. I'm really, really..." Dean swallows, his tongue feeling thick in his mouth. "The...the thing is...?"
some random dude last night." It comes out bitter and spiteful and makes Cas look like he got slapped in the face. Dean on the other hand is appalled he has shown he gives a solitary shit and he moves on quickly.
He’s shirtless, the sex hair is even more fucked than usual and Castiel has a tiny smile on, hint of white teeth behind his beautiful lips. He’s against his usual backdrop but he looks casual and unbearably sexy.
He chews furiously, trying to get to swallowing quickly, but it is like jello and he twists his face into misery before just going for it, tilting his head back and taking it down. Dean makes a face at Sam’s phone, where their stream is going out and sticks his tongue out.
Castiel holds out a hand to him, brow furrowed above sky-bright blue eyes. "I'm more powerful than they know too. We can run."
The fact he's maybe going to be able to do this act very easily. He doesn't want to blur the lines - but he has to remind himself it's an act, it's a song and dance he's putting on for his family. And Cas is being a generous friend trying to help him, while at the same time reminding him he's doing some unconscionable shit he should be trying to get out of. And that's it.
"You'll have fun, I swear." Dean says quickly, desperate for Cas to believe him. He feels like he's done something wrong - he isn't blind, he knows Cas isn't happy. He's just been assuming Cas will go along with the lie until Christmas and then just now tacked New Years' on there.
He does look good. The nerdy factor is killing Dean - but he does look good. Must have his contacts in today too because that myopic squint is all wide-eyed blue today. It's so weird to see Cas with his hair behaving though. Dean can't quite decide if he likes it or not.
He’s missed a few seconds of what Castiel said and uses the touchpad to drag the tracker back a bit.
“Hello.” The stranger returns, voice rough and quiet. He looks away, eyes pulled back down to focusing on the ground before his feet and Dean finds himself kind of falling in step as they both go for the stairs.
What better way to control the chaotic Demons of Hell than to Bind them to the emotionless, incorruptible Angels? The most dangerous are bound to Seraphim, the warriors below the Archangels, powerful enough to control their Charges. The tether can go both ways though - so Dean decides to make his Angel feel it.
“...you know what? Sure. Enjoy your niece's birthday party.” Sadness turns to disappointed irritation in an instant and Dean winces as the door is slammed in his face.
That splutters him into full blown laughter before he darts forward and stops Cas' retreat to change. "No! Cas it's..." He pulls on his arm. "No. You...you're fine. You clean up...great." His laughter trails away and he looks his roommate over as Cas glowers suspiciously.
Then between Sam and Jess had come Robin and Elizabeth and he'd admit for a hot minute toward the end of their date he'd been into Elizabeth, 'Liz' and maybe Jess had scored a point... then she started talking about settling down close to her family - which was in another state. He was maybe being hypocritical but his family was all here in Kansas. Why would he want to move to goddamn New Jersey?
“I only bought a half one. Come on… I’ll eat most of it - you just have one bite. One!” Sam is following him around with a food container that Dean would usually expect to hold pie or cake.
A brief flash of panic overtakes him and he looks around his bedroom for something to use as a weapon in case this person is angry - they sound loud and argumentative about this ‘Benny’ they are seeking - obviously not him, but he did not want to be caught in any crossfire if he stuck his head out to let whoever know he had the wrong apartment.
"Fine." He blinks, opening his mouth to ask what is fine, when he's fucking impaled. The first stretch is just on the wrong side of the pleasure/pain fence, sparking discomfort like an itch and then glorious burn as he's thrust into, one long smooth action until the angel is pressed against his back and Dean is gasping, face against stone, wings spread, desperate for some kind of relief.
He's breathing a bit hard as he steps into Cas' space and anticipation and lust are fucking blinding because he's got hands on Cas' buckle, ripping through button and zipper before he even thinks to tilt his head up and get Cas' mouth.
"We're sleeping in my room. I don't know if you are sleep-on-the-floor pissed but I'm not. So it's up to you." Cas follows wordlessly and doesn't even look at him after they enter.
He just gets a long-suffering look before Cas levels a serious, pensive look on him. "We have alcohol here. You bought three different types of eggnog too. Don't you think that's enough?"
"Thank you." Castiel's voice is wicked dry as he says that. "You don't have to. I suppose it pales to...sex."
." He climbs on Cas and kisses him hard cause he says his name like it's a prayer, a curse, the best and worst thing. Just like he had the last time he had come inside him. Cas kisses him back. Like he's drowning, like he had when Dean was riding him. "I...I
“Bon appetit.” The brunette’s head tilts a second before he digs his fork into one of the depressions in the ‘flower’ mound and pulls. A chunk comes off, pulled by the fork and falls onto the serving platter he has under it with a sick splat.
"Then, then you don't have to pretend tonight. I just want to have fun with you tonight." Dean leans forward into Cas' space and allows his brain to shut down for a minute. He wants to wrap his arms around Cas and be close to him so he does. He wraps his arms around Cas’ neck and pushes into his space, against his body. He revels in the compact heat and how they fit together, just about perfect if he tucks his head in. When the tension leeches out of Cas and his hands rest lightly on his hips, Dean smiles into his cheek. "Come on Cas..."
"It is not safe to do this in the middle of the day. In the middle of a farmer's field." Though he's being scolded, Cas' tone is not as inflection-less as he's heard it before and that gets Dean's attention.
“Asparagus...salad? Isn’t that a flower mold - like the one they use for cake?” Sam’s face comes over his shoulder, squinting at the laptop. “Oh it’s like a soup jelly!”
“Thank you?” The 'you' pitches up and Dean fights a blush as the guy looks back up at him searchingly, even more confused the longer he stares.
. Even though he can see a sly tease in those blue fucking eyes all Cas does is nod so he turns away smartly, heading back to finish breakfast.
It's before dawn and he works for maybe an hour before he hears feet coming down the stairs. He's expecting his brother or maybe even his mom as they both are early risers. Instead it's Cas with his dark, mussed head, sleepy half-mast eyes and a long, deep yawn that shows tongue and soft, pink palate - shit! Fuck...
The noise that comes out of him is just tortured and Cas watches him squirm and turn red, sipping his coffee. Dean's about to do something embarrassing and irrevocable, like adjust his hard on and let Cas see and say some other smart-assed comment Dean could return with more innuendo and see where it went... and goddamn Sam walks in.
He looks at Dean’s hand, brows drawing together cutely as he looks confused. When he looks up he tilts his head at Dean who just arches an eyebrow and waits.
“Uh, yeah sorry. I - I’m not fond of cats. Scratchy, bitey little overlords.” Castiel almost hugs Padawan to him, as the guy unwinds, relaxes. “Shit… I’m real sorry but my head’s spinning too now. Trust me I - you’re being great… I just need two minutes.”
"FUCK!" Hips off the bed and he's coming so hard he sees fucking galaxies. His own cry sounds echo-y, distant to the feel of hot, wet strips of cum on his stomach and chest. "Shit!" It's a pitchy, distressed shriek because he's sensitive everywhere, feels like one big nerve ending with his fingers still stuck in the clamp of his ass muscles and Castiel fucking rubbing his oil gland. Dean whines when he lets go and it feels like his orgasm finally ends.
Dean settles on the other loveseat and plunks down after giving a wave, determined to settle in and play off his unhappiness.
come to one of their LARPing sessions, just to hear Dean have to answer to 'Handmaiden'. He likes what they've got going, this easy companionship that doesn't
'Roommate. New roommate.' It was just Novak, getting himself 'breakfast' before heading out probably. Dean flops onto his back again, attaining sleep again probably a lost cause as he thinks about joining Castiel for coffee.
"Well, you have keys man. If it's a hot date just keep the volume down." Dean barely hears the snort from the kitchen that pulls his attention from his work, the architectural design he's working on for Sandover. "Hey, if it was just working late you wouldn't have felt the need to announce it."
"Let's go Dean." The pretense is good, from holding hands walking to the door from the car up until they're inside. His mom had hugged Cas as soon as she got him in the door which softened his expression immediately, Dean's hug like an affectionate afterthought as she took Cas into the kitchen with her. Dean doesn't even mind as it allows him to drift into the living room with Sam and Jess, who are already wrapped up in each other on the couch watching tv.
Cas just keeps fucking watching, looking more and more awake before Dean even brings him his first cup of coffee. When he does bring Cas his cup, he's so goddamn swollen it's practically at Cas' eye-level and he doesn't
Whatever angry retort was about to fly from Cas stalls and he inhales a deep breath after a moment, speaking with forced calm. "I didn't mean..." His voice trails off and that gets Dean's attention. Cas is looking at the comforter fisted in his hands as he continues to speak. "I
Dean gulps, before beginning to work his hips up against his fingers. It should be perfunctionary...but instead it feels like he's getting off. He adds another finger and can feel himself leaking onto his own pelvis and if he twists a bit more he can probably hump the bed, come with Cas watching him...
He twists and stretches a little before beginning to thrust his fingers in and out. "You just...ha, fuck, needed to do...
"I mean, you kind of are?" He can feel the tension between them here, Cas looking from the house to the yard and his Mom's flowers, to the garage, to the neighbors, taking everything in and rapidly over-processing.
"Huh? Yeah, of course." Dean smiles as honestly as he can, content to be here with his family. Nothing else mattered. "Just, long day. You know. Uhh, are we doing the usual room split?" He knows without asking they are but there's something in him that hopes. Maybe he can get away with sleeping on the couch downstairs if he pretends to crash out watching tv.
There's one knock and a not-so-delicate cough from behind the door that makes them both freeze. "Your brother wants to know if the batter in the fridge was for French toast." Jess inquires with almost inhuman politeness, voice full of choked laughter. He can hear her snickers fade as she walks away.
Dean just moans loudly at him and Cas smirks and just dives back in like learning every inch of Dean's mouth is his one job.
He wants him, wants so bad he can taste it in the back of his throat like iron. He flits his eyes back to the mojito Cas had talked him into with accusing incredulousness but still snags it and downs the rest in one.
Not that this apartment building was dangerous or anything that would have made him want protection in the past but now apparently there were angry trespassers about.
"Did you...are you not satisfied?" He has been gifted the most sexually ignorant angel in all of Heaven apparently. Dean knows they don't do feelings - the nuances of emotion beyond duty and justice but surely he must understand biology?
“Hello Sam and Dean. I’m hoping this finds you both safe. There’s a reason why I say I try this stuff so you don’t have to and a lot of that is because I have a constitution for food and alcohol to be envied.” Castiel says matter-of-factly and it’s true as his video history proves. “Obviously you may not have been able to indulge in weed but that helps too.” Cas’ smile is sly and it stokes something hot in his stomach that makes Dean fidget and try to ignore his inflating arousal.
“I’m sorry… I’m not laughing at you. Plus, that you don’t do morning afters with people is good to know… means your neighbors don’t have to deal with you shuttling… guys and girls out of here huh?”
"A private room was delegated to us." Okay so yes, a prude. He barely resists rolling his eyes but makes a sound of non-committal boredom. "It is not much further."
, wants him, is awesome. They kiss and strip in a harried flurry before Cas loses patience and everything just disappears. It's easy because of the puny body to forget how powerful the Seraph is.
"Dude," Dean says it, aggravated and baffled. "How exactly am I supposed to have a good time with my family with you acting like a goddamn asshole?" Cas looks over his shoulder, narrowing his eyes and leveling a cold stare at him, but Dean is officially done.
He's licking his lips when he pulls away from Cas' mouth. The angel looks dazed, fucked out, wild hair and wide blue eyes. Dean smirks at him and rolls his hips again.
“I have no idea who you are - or who you’re looking for for that matter but I think you have the wrong apartment!” Castiel shouts it almost hysterically and jabs 'Patterns Of Culture' forward. “Push the cat off and get out.”
"Oh...oh fucking Christ." Grace floods him again and Cas knots and comes right behind it and then Dean does lose it - his hold, just for a moment, a frozen rictus of pleasure in orgasm and an epicenter of demonic energy blasting out away from him.
"Here." He clears his throat after putting the cup down and appreciates Cas' eyes staying resolutely
That being a gelatinous mound of white, filled with multicolored speckles, of God only knew what. When he had started Castiel’s video he had looked at the monstrosity in front of the vlogger and promptly barfed in his mouth.
But Cas just laughs again, softer until Dean's standing there embarrassed and red, with his whole family looking at him. He knows they're doing that intense eye contact thing again, but he can't stop it.
"Cas!" Dean drops the remains of the pillow he had been shredding and smiles, wide and welcoming at his angel. Who is looking around them where goose down feathers are floating in the air with a raised eyebrow.
"I know I'm asking a lot of you Cas," Dean's voice breaks a little and he musters his will to get through this. "If it's that you're honestly not cool with pretending to be my boyfriend anymore - I don't want to put you any deeper in a shit situation..." Like having to deal with your roommate maybe being a little too into you.
"Dude, let's go out for drinks. Find the closest bar and get a little wasted. We don't have to get to the house until like one, two-ish." He declares it loudly, upbeat before pulling Cas' feet from where they were tucked under him. "It'll be fun."
Dean gives a shake of his head at the door with a tiny huff at himself, shrugs into his jacket and then his eyes just get pulled up to the dejected looking guy coming toward him. They both have to go the same way to get out of the apartment building and Dean wonders if he’s taking the elevator or the stairs.
"You're supposed to be my friend, for one thing! You don't get to treat me like shit and ignore me for days and then expect me to come here and pretend like everything's fucking fine...!" Shit. Fucking hell. He doesn't
“I like it too.” Dean ends up digging for his wallet, digging into a back pocket of his jeans with difficulty. “So - not that you have to necessarily subscribe to my thinking but,” He pulls out one of his business cards and hands it over jauntily between two fingers. “If there’s a Saturday you feel you might want to grab a drink or watch a movie… with a guaranteed happy ending, you can call me.” He can’t help the wink, dies inside a tiny bit in embarrassment but Castiel takes the card almost automatically, eyes glued to it.
The moment is suspended, stretches so long he gets lost in Cas' eyes and how they can do this, just stare into each other's souls.
"I have a question for you Dean. How exactly do you plan to pull off being a month into a relationship with a man you live with?" The question lingers for a moment. "Because if we managed to sell that we weren't physically involved before..."
"I got you Cas. Fuck." It's just a minute, but it feels like the longest minute of his life watching his clumsy ass hands trying to get Cas out of his fucking jeans. He can feel Cas shaking against him and wonders what he's feeling as Dean kisses him, slick and breathless one more time before going to the floor.
He has no idea how it's going to impact their ability to be roommates and best friends but at the very least this development would add some pretty awesome perks to their fake boyfriends arrangement - after all, sex could cover 'boyfriends' or friends with benefits.
Cas' small smile is like the sun breaking out through clouds and Dean feels his heart flip over in the worst way.
that." Sam looks disturbed and amused in halves. His mom finally interjects, waving Sam away while Jess wipes tears. Jess seems to soothe Sam's mental turmoil quite quickly despite his brother's dramatics.
"You're such a baby." There's affection without the mockery this time and Dean decides to leave with what little dignity he has left. He huffs and decides to go up to his old room with his beer that won't mock him. Fucking Castiel.
“Not just ancient ones. We study currently existing cultures as well and the study has many different focuses for that matter. Archaeology, socio-cultural, linguistics - that one is my particular area of focus for my PhD.” Castiel casts his mind for a way to explain it to someone not versed in the faculty. “Think about what we know about ancient cultures and how a lot of it still applies to us today? Not just in language but in things we consider part of civilized society today without realizing - capitalism, trade, governments, class systems…”
"Okay Dean. This one time, once." He barely holds himself back from hugging, squeezing Cas' knee instead. "I guess I'll have to look at my one silver lining. Eye candy boyfriend for a day."
"Oh dear. Look at the time." Cas says in the falsest tone he's ever heard and Dean dies on the inside. "Is it possible we can get these to go Mary?" Sam bursts into laughter and then yelps a 'hey', Dean assumes from Jess just having stepped on his foot or something.
"Do you need it?" Eh, Dean's feeling steady enough for a hard fuck now. Guh, but for an angel with no concept of pleasure he's damned good at giving it to Dean by accident. Dean licks him from base to crown and suckles there for a moment and apart from a rather hard twitch in his mouth, he doesn't get a peep out of Cas. So he gags himself on his dick until his mouth is stretched wide and Cas' cock is wet before popping up for air.
When he lets himself in, he's sure there has to be an air of guilt around him like a stench. But obviously Castiel is oblivious, because he hardly registers his entry to the living room.
“Anthro... huh? Bachelors?” The still unnamed trespasser still seems afraid to touch the cat, arm hovering over it, so Castiel decides to end the awkward stalemate.
The white feathers of the angel's wings ruffle before settling, domed over Dean's. Thankfully he doesn't try to move and Dean can swallow the sob that almost escaped and try to breathe himself into relaxing. He's stretched so fucking full it would be amazing if he were even just a little wetter.
"Goddamn it Dean. Please." He likes how raw Cas sounds, gravelly low pleading. It's hot as fuck and he moans and bites kisses into Cas' jaw, sucking a mark high up on the hinge below his ear and reveling in the groan he gets as Cas clacks his head against the stall wall.
“I like it.” Castiel says dryly, almost sardonic. He’s probably heard it all about his name. Dean shakes his head, grin going crooked, sly.
"Cool guys. We'll be up in a bit. You can, go lie down." Dean glares as his brother backs away, with obvious eye gestures to Cas that there's no way he missed. When Sam is gone Dean huffs and turns for the stairs, marching up them.
Castiel sighs, it sounds like he's just relaxed after a long day into a hot bath or slain a battlefield of demons. And Dean's bursting full and then fuller, a liquid warmth pulsing into him and it burns and aches and... Dean orgasms in a shivery mass, wings limp, body insensate. He's pretty sure he'd be on his knees if Castiel didn't have him pinned to the wall, immovable behind him.
Cas glares and Dean's smile turns unsure. Cas starts pulling his legs back and Dean has to move off or fall off. So he knew Cas had a weakness for him saying please... was it supposed to be used for sex only?
“-yeah, so I’m really sorry but you know, my kid brother’s daughter’s birthday is today too so I gotta go but I have your number. I’ll totally call you.” Dean gives his best winning grin as he finally hops into his other boot and the blonde frowns at him, reading through his bullshit.
Dean's been sneaking looks at Cas all evening and he doesn't think he's been obvious until he gets kicked in the thigh.
"So first time huh?" The one wing he can see on the side his head is turned is suddenly ruffled, fluffed feathers and Dean smirks.
The man in question seemed to have taken offense. Honestly, Dean didn't blame him, because he was the idiot who had tried to rope Cas into his nonsense and then acted like
"Come on. We got this." Cas seems to steel himself like he's going into battle with a nod and his most serious face before turning on his heel and leading Dean to his mother's front door, holding his hand. He rings the doorbell and then destroys his own hairstyle with a quick rake through.
"I'm going to hold your hand tomorrow. Are you okay with that?" Dean had looked up and Cas isn't focused on the flat screen anymore, he's looking at where Dean's legs are stretched out along the coffee table, kind of pensive.
Castiel talks about the type of weed he tried this week before he started his food review, Sky OG, and the effect it’s having on him. Dean imagines he’s usually a very put together and proper dude and honestly, apart from an increasing talkativeness and a more fervent energy than he usually has, Castiel seems mostly unaffected.
Cas had come home on a half day, that Dean had gotten completely off from the office because of Christmas break and since then had been morose, a sad frown on his face that was tearing Dean up.
"Yeah I do." The troubled expression that lands before Castiel seems to steel himself shouldn't make him feel bad. "Look... I can prep myself first if you want to just get to the..."
"O-Of course. Uhh." He loves his mother more than he can say as she stands up. Cas releases him to go help. He's still shell-shocked when Sam fucking smirks at him.
Dean's caught in the middle of rolling his eyes in bemusement, when his mom opens the door almost immediately.
(Cas has a time-stamp mini-story for his issues with Dean that may be needed to spell out that Uber seduction...that will be posted eventually XD)
" The exclamation is high and clear as Cas reaches down his pants and fucking grabs him, the motion of thumb over his weeping crown and the first pump almost simultaneous.
"You...you don't have to. I can...tell them," He scrubs a hand across his face. He’s so fucking exhausted, wrung out and disappointed.
This is proven true when, after chugging half the beer and exhaling loudly, he finds Jess sneaking looks at them from the other side of Sam, who's not even hiding that he's staring at Dean.
"Hey." Cas sticking his head into his old bedroom makes him scramble self-consciously to his feet. Dean's feeling somewhat defensive and he doesn't really know why. Cas sighs and pushes open the door some more revealing the beer in his hand. "Bribe? I couldn't leave my boyfriend I tormented up here sulking."
Like now,  for instance, as he's watching tv while sitting in the nook so he can stretch his legs on the short side, while Cas lays on the other and tucks his feet under Dean. It's somehow gotten really goddamn comfortable.
-sure' Cas wasn't into him. He told her he was, but couldn't explain the craptastic situation he was in.
“You should be. I don’t give out my card to just anybody.” He’s definitely never done it to try to pick someone up or flirt before, seeing as all his work stuff is on it along with his cell number. “But, I think I can trust you to not be a stalker type.” Dean hazards the joke grinning as the guy squints suspiciously before rolling his eyes.
Cas' exhale and wide blue eyes when they part, is worth it. The confusion when Dean sinks back down and kisses him again is a prize. Dean's selfish so he keeps taking... little bits of Castiel's innocence. The grunt and low hiss he gets for sinking teeth and then sucking a hickey into Castiel's neck is coupled with the warning of swelling fullness inside him.
Castiel damn near spills his coffee on himself sputtering as he stares at the guy fishing for his personal information. Expression still peeled Dean waits as Castiel finally has a taste.
"If I can. It's been lovely to meet you all though. We should go. Unfortunately, I have an early day tomorrow. Come on, Dean." He's the one scrambling after Cas like a puppy and he snatches a long hug from his mom, glaring at Sam and Jess as he leaves.
"Come on Cas." And it's easy to drag him from the cab, pulling with two hands clinging to Castiel's before he turns on his heel with a smile as something warm floods his chest at how Cas looks at their hands.
The atmosphere is intense. Dean feels like he's putting on a burlesque show or a strip tease and Cas is eating it up. It should not have Dean feeling like he could pound nails with his dick.
"They would...uhh, love to meet you next Sunday if...you can make it?" Dean flinches as Castiel takes another deep breath, hissing it out slowly like he's meditating.
"Fucking fuck me already." Dean surges up for a kiss and he's burned, burned through, into - both ends. Cas' mouth is Grace and fire and his cock is Heaven and justice and Dean shrieks, wings splayed open as something better than an orgasm washes through him.
“Huh. This isn’t… Benny’s apartment is it?” Castiel widens his eyes in an incredulous expression that the guy gives a crooked smile to when he looks up again. It softens his face and makes him look unfairly attractive, and Castiel lowers the book unconsciously in response.
He's in their shared space, thumping on the pillows of the rather nice over-sized bed, when suddenly Castiel is there, back stone-faced and squinty.
Dean releases some undignified noise as Castiel relinquishes his hands finally and then wraps him in his arms. He's still practically dead-weight and temporarily locked up with Castiel, but he can't help wriggling and when they take the short flap sideways through dimensions, because of the struggle they end up on the bed and Dean's almost rolled onto his own wing.
"Uhh...it's kind of new, obviously and uhh...we, we're, feeling this out still so... I just went on the dates to humour you guys but, yeah. Already have someone." Dean stammers and churns out as he goes, hoping when he's done that he makes some sort of credible sense. His mom blinks, obviously still caught off guard while Sam leans forward interested, eager.
Cas must see the moment it clicks for Dean by his flush because he nods slowly. "Yes Dean. Consequences. So I'm going to suggest either you let your family down real easy this weekend and say, that we've had some irreconcilable differences, ...or…," The pause is indelicate, leaving Dean's imagination to run wild for a moment with just the extent of what they might have to do to keep his family convinced he's happy in his relationship with his boyfriend. "...We go for some Academy Award level dedication for Thanksgiving. And the decision is completely up to you."
Dean pants, tilting his head away from Cas who is expecting him to rise off him again, expecting a kiss again, and rolls his hips instead. He watches from under his lashes, blood thrumming, excited. "You want it?"
Dean is working out when he suddenly finds himself with a dog in his shirt. How that leads to a date only Chuck knows.
"I can feel you squeezing... if that's what you mean." Dean's the one who narrows his eyes now, suspicious. He gives an experimental stroke, tightening his grip.
The bee themed slippers get a crack of a smile from him before he remembers he has to look Cas in the eye and ask him a huge…no, a
“Sam, your views on the asparagus salad were truly thought-provoking and I do suppose that finding new ways of enjoying everyday foods do make inventiveness necessary. Dean, I hope you’ve recovered from your allergy. Swelling of the oesophagus and anaphylactic shock is quite dangerous. It would truly be a shame if someone so handsome with such talent for swallowing was lost to us.” The heavy pause is enough to make Dean swoon.
"...broken you." He's honestly surprised as he wasn't trying to do shit to Cas. Well, that was kind of a lie. He'd wanted to see if he could break his willpower... "You didn't give in."
Between bad tv and food prep for the next day, and the turkey down along with the other meats that needed to thaw, it's getting pretty late and Dean's thinking an early start for what he'll bake tomorrow is a good idea, so he's wanting to sleep soon.
“Rough night huh? Saturdays…” Dean kind of trots down the stairs while the guy walks confidently, purposefully next to him. He finds himself pausing on landings because he wants the guy to keep up.
"God! Cas!" His head thumps into the bedroom door behind him when they part again and his hips have been working, fucking into Cas' slick, unrelenting grip while they kissed. The pleasure's burning away his brain, Dean doesn't register crying out again until his mouth is under Cas' and he's breathless, being kissed filthy and gasping for air.
He gets on his knees pulling jeans and briefs down with him and fucking moans as Cas comes free. He hadn't seen while Cas was rutting him against his bedroom door and now he can and he's thick. Not overly long but mouth-wateringly thick and Dean wants that.
What better way to control the chaotic Demons of Hell than to Bind them to the emotionless, uncorruptible Angels? The most dangerous are bound to Seraphim, the warriors below the Archangels, powerful enough to control their Charges. The tether can go both ways though - so Dean decides to make his Angel feel it.
"Might I just suggest next time a bit more prep? You haven't lived until you've had a dripping wet hole."
He could tell Mom and Sam he lied and have them feel even more worried about him and determined to get him hooked up with someone. He could only imagine that conversation. There was no way to avoid it because it wasn't like he could claim he and his 'boyfriend' broke up a fucking week after they were 'official'. Shit...
When they pull up in front of his mom's house, Dean is about to call it quits, say fuck it and confess. He'll tell his family he and Cas are a lie...and tell Cas, the only thing Dean's sure about is he wants his friendship. He wants them to be okay.
"Yes." Dean jutted his chin forward stubbornly, unaware how he almost shows off his Binding. "I didn't plan for anyone to die. I just did it for the shits and giggles. I'm more mischief than malevolence Cas. I mean, it's just two humans."
"I know you aren't capable of possessiveness, so did I manage to get the one prude angel?" He voices as he's pulled around behind this Castiel like a plaything, down one corridor then another. It gets old real fast so Dean digs in his heels and barely phases the Seraph beyond a sharp look over his shoulder. Then he's literally, legs out from under him, being dragged. "Oh for - fuck! Okay fuck! Goddamn -"
"It's all charm and personality up here. The riff-raff don't have fun like us!" He flexes his claws but keeps his stance loose, un-threatening. "What rank are you in the Seraphs then?"
“It’s-it’s just after midnight. And I don’t do morning-afters.” Castiel splutters, flustered and off-keeled.
“Bet you’re wicked smart. Doing a Masters at twenty-six. I’m turning twenty-four this year…” Dean’s voice goes quiet, trails off. “I’m just a mechanic though. I didn’t even go to college but I was interested in engineering...just stuff didn’t work out…” Castiel looks over his shoulder and Dean looks saddened, his eyes heavy. “My little brother though - as soon as I finished high school I started working ‘cause Sammy’s like… a genius. And I wanted him to be able to go off to school and not have to worry…”
How are they supposed to pretend to be together? Dean can't even look at Cas, and Cas is avoiding him.
"How'd that exam go? Sam said you were nose to the grindstone last weekend." The blonde pediatric resident chimes out a laugh as Dean lets her go.
“I like my coffee black with a little sugar.” Dean enunciates it carefully, pointedly, while Castiel nods and wonders if the alcohol had a resurgence because he does not get the joke. However, he preps two cups - his with a splash of milk - and takes them back into the living area.
"They mean well." Dean hasn't had a serious relationship since two years ago with Cassie and he knows everyone around him is reading Dean's behaviour since as loneliness and denial, when he really just isn't ready for 'forever'. Dean tries to shake off a sudden melancholy. Why does everyone think he's unhappy? He's fine. "I should... I have to do some work at the office today."
He blurts it out because he knows what comes next. Another name and another try but Dean's going to take the slightest pinch of Cas' advice.
“Okay so my brother’s more of a burger kind of guy but I got him to agree to one bite for science.” Dean grimaces and makes a face before he remembers the internet is watching and hitches the fake smile back on. “We were watching the video that Castiel made and honestly it was amazing…”
Dean can get sex anywhere, anytime he wants... but he wants it from his damned angel and he's not going to fucking beg for it. Cas will ask and he will take and that is how this thing is going to happen.
He's not even winded from the wall he crashed into, just slightly annoyed, blood pumping now as he stands, wings neutral. Dean smirks, all fangs and irreverence. "This is going to be fun."
"I don't get how you don't - we've been... Dean," Cas closes his eyes and tilts his head up, the edge of his stubbled jaw drawing Dean's eye. "The last couple of weeks have been great. It felt like... we've really become close."
"I can't do this." Cas tugs his shirt out from his jeans, with a sound of frustration. He's fucking panicking - because Cas can't do this to him now. Not right outside his mom's house.
The next hour is a pleasant, happy blur. A bunch of other twenty and thirty-somethings are crammed into this bar too, enjoying Christmas Eve before the hectic rush of tomorrow. Dean enjoys his fair set of attention and preens under it but doesn't leave Cas. It's easy to get any attention off Cas too when he's facing him, and they're huddled together conspiratorial, with Dean's legs tangled with his on his bar stool.
Dean's had thoughts about how weird Cas is. Weird in a good way! Like how he seems so straight-laced, but has a wickedly dry sense of
Other dude was standing in the doorway, almost blocking it with his body and an arm as earnest-looking tanned dude started to stutter out his plea.
"Please don't hate me, but you have to come for Thanksgiving." He blurts out in the moment, into the braindead void.
Castiel’s chewing with a sort of mixed expression, his brows cutely furrowed. He swallows, seems to taste the inside of his mouth and then licks his lips with a soft hum, and that reminds Dean how these watches usually end.
“You from K.U? I honestly can’t place your age… but an Anthropology Bachelor's dude?” Dean’s head lolls and he stares, piercing right across the distance between them. Castiel fidgets, makes himself move pulling out cups - might as well have one too! - and getting sugar and milk as he speaks.
being physical with your boyfriend." Dean turns a look of betrayal on Jess that she shrugs apologetically at.
"Do we have to do this?" He asks, sitting in a low slouch opposite Cas. Embarrassment is rife on Dean's face but Sam is merciless in the face of Dean's wish to die. His mom looks pained on his behalf while Jess is in quiet fits of laughter.
Shelly had been someone he just met at a bar and went home with. If this guy didn’t do pick ups that meant he had ended up in bed with someone he probably liked and just been dropped like a sack of potatoes after being used.
"Ah, kind of a he. He's...a he." Where's he going with this? Where is he going with this! The shock only buys him a minute, Sam recovering before his mother because while they both also know he's bi, Sam is the only one who's actually seen him with a guy before.
"...I burn water so Dean is the one who cooks. He's quite good at it. But then again, I've been told I'm not picky by my own brother. So maybe my standards are just really low." He pulls out a chair at the kitchen table that's facing where Sam and Dean are talking, so when Dean swivels to check on him he's met with a deadpan stare. "Really low."
He's just stream of consciousness yammering to find something Cas responds to, talking about work and the upcoming LARPing events with Charlie, to Christmas at his mom's - and he teases Cas' gift which, that gets a reaction from him finally, a lightening of his eyes and the tiniest curl of his lips before Dean says firmly that he obviously will find out what he's getting tomorrow because he's not spilling.
"Yeah. 'Good morning' Dean. You forgot that earlier on your way out." Jess giggles out a soft 'Sam' but his brother isn't being silenced. "And telling me to finish breakfast when I don't even know what you were planning on
“Oh God! Oh! Oh shit.” Sam scrambles back from the computer desk and fumbles for his phone. “Sorry. Got to go! Dean’s allergic to something in the salad!”
Another inhale and whimpery moan. Dean blinks languidly, smiles slow for Cas straddled on top of him.
Maybe he had been hanging out at a bar with friends or something, Castiel thinks, taking in the black, fitted T-shirt, the maroon button down shirt open over it and the stonewashed jeans finished off with combat boots. Maybe he had been at a photoshoot and had too much champagne.
"Good morn...ning?" Cas sits up straight quickly from the frankly obscene slouch he'd been in and Dean squeaks as he presses himself against the counter, willing his erection away with all his willpower. "Uhh..."
"Hey there's meat too. Not just the casserole, so there's no need to hide in there." Jess' voice draws him out and he tries to regulate his breathing and act normal as he walks in.
