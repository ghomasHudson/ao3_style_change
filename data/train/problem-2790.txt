Dean tried to contact Jack more times than he could count. The kid was the new God after all, if anyone could do it, he could and Dean was sure he would. Cas meant so much to Jack, Dean found it hard to believe that he wouldn’t even try to save him.
Without the empty waiting to come and snatch him. Because apparently Cas’ true happiness is Dean, has always been Dean. Apparently Cas didn’t want anything more than telling Dean that he’s not a monster, that he is much more than what his dad raised him to be. That he gives much more love than he realizes, and that he is loved in return.
“Dean, are you okay?”
Dean feels lost, but that’s usually the vibe of being around Charlie and Ash. Their friendship is bizarre, but it Dean isn’t one to question it. He’s glad they met, he only wishes it could’ve happened in real life.
“What do you mean?”
Black oozing tentacles slowly wrap around her. She gives Dean one last glance and then she’s gone, the black spot on the wall closing up quickly. As soon as Dean feels like he can move freely again, he does, barely standing up straight and instantly running over to Cas, falling to his knees in front of him. “Cas, hey,” he whispers, his hands immediately finding both sides of Cas’ face, softly holding onto his head to make him look up at him. “Are you okay?”
Dean is already nodding his head before Castiel has even finished speaking. He fully steps into the room and quietly shuts the door behind him before he heads towards the chair by the desk. Halfway there, he notices Dean‘s hand flat on the free space next to him, as if inviting Castiel to join him on the bed. Castiel complies and sits down at the top of the bed, leaning his back against the headboard, his legs stretched out in front of him. Dean shifts into the same position next to him, their shoulders brushing and their knees almost touching.
Dean was having a good day. Even in Heaven, that’s not always a given, but he was feeling good. The sun was out but it was just cloudy enough not to be blinding, there was a comfortable breeze going and there was a smell of rain in the air. Cas had also fucked Dean’s brains out in the morning, which Dean thinks might have also played a minor role in his good mood.
Cas smiles at that comment and it’s the first real smile Dean’s seen him make all night. Or morning, the sun’s rising fast and the bedroom has come a long way from the darkness Dean woke up in. “So you looked through all my memories?”
It was out there before he remotely thought it through and he immediately bit his lip. Cas’ eyes went wide and his jaw went slack. Dean thought he said the wrong thing—no, he
Cas glared at him. “Of course I do.” He turned the keys and started the engine before Dean could tease him about it any more. The gravelly driveway didn’t pose a problem and so they started their little road trip.
Cas realized that he was spiraling.
“Well,” Dean says like an idiot, “did you?”
It takes Charlie about three more hours (at least what feels like two hours because again, time isn’t real) before she tells both Ash and Dean to shut up when they weren’t even talking. Ten seconds later, the computer beeps and Charlie jumps out of her seat, the world’s biggest grin on her face. “I
“I‘m no longer an angel,“ Cas said quickly.
“You feel that?“ Dean‘s voice was honest and soft. “It was never one-sided.“
, really.”
For the third time, Dean thought this night couldn’t be more surreal. One moment he was mourning the loss of his best friend, the next said best friend was alive and human. Hell, Cas didn’t even know if Dean would have him, but he still did it, just for the chance of Dean letting him in. Cas, once again, put Dean over everything he had, billions of years of his celestial existence thrown away, just for Dean.
It’s a torturous few minutes for his husband, but Dean’s absolutely having the time of his—well, you know. He’ll never get enough of the sound of Cas’ laugh, he didn’t get to hear it enough when they were alive, so you bet he’s gonna make sure to make the most of it now.
Cas was still trying to avoid Dean‘s eyes, looking down on the ground. He gently grabbed the angel‘s hand and was surprised at how warm and sweaty it was. Dean guided it towards his own body and put it on his chest, right above his heart. Cas‘ eyes finally looked up from the ground when Dean put his own hand on top of Cas‘ shaking one, tightly holding it in place. His gaze stayed on Dean‘s chest for a moment, feeling his heart not just beat, but race, before he finally looked up to meet Dean‘s watery eyes.
Dean really isn’t prepared to be having this conversation tonight. Frankly, he’s never given it much thought because the truth is, he really doesn’t care, and he tells Cas as much. “No, it doesn’t. I don’t care that you look like him.”
The blinds aren’t shut all the way and there’s a few rays of sun illuminating the room. Dean’s not sure if it’s the linear approximation of time passing or if his subconscious wished for it to be morning soon. Either way, he assumes it can’t be past six in the morning which, nothing’s changed about that, Heaven or not, is an absolutely ungodly hour to be awake.
“You..had to?“ It didn’t make sense to Dean. Why would Cas have to become human? Sure, the new rules about leaving humans to their own business sounded fair, but what did it have to do with Cas? What does he so desperately need to be on earth for? Why would he give up his grace, wings and angelic powers just to-
Dean can’t answer, he just throws his arms around Cas’ shoulders and pulls him into a tight hug. He needs this, he needs Cas close to him after he just nearly lost him again, even if he might be crushing him. He needs proof that Cas is still here with him. Cas’ arms hesitantly find their way around Dean’s waist, holding him with not as much force as Dean is holding him but Dean will take anything. He swears he can feel Cas bury his face in the crook of Dean’s neck.
It took Dean a moment to catch on, but when he did, his stomach turned. “So, you’re-you’re leaving again?“ Cas opened his mouth to reply but Dean was faster. “You come back down here just to tell me goodbye again?“
, despite Dean’s entire body shaking it feels so good to finally get it off his chest. Cas seemed to be right, as always, when he claimed that happiness is in just saying it. “Cas, I fuckin’ love you.”
He can feel Cas lean back into him and lay his hands on top of Dean’s. “Hello, Dean,” he says, exactly like Dean knew he would because that’s just his line. Dean will give him all the embarrassing pet names in the world, he’ll call him baby and sweetheart and honey in front of God (hah!) and everyone, but to Cas he’ll always just be Dean. Something about the name being holy to Cas, something divine and pure, how no nickname could ever do justice to the bliss Cas feels every time the name rolls off his tongue.
There’s a long silence. Cas fidgets with the blanket covering them in one hand while both of Dean’s are shakingly holding onto Cas’ body. After what feels like eternity, Cas nods. “Yes.”
“‘Cause I can still feel your heart race like crazy.”
Castiel is halfway through an old novel he found in a dusty book shelf, when he hears something. A ticking, fast and heavy. It‘s pounding and seemingly speeding up every second. Castiel can feel it in the back of his head and after all those sleepless nights, he can easily place what it is: Dean is having a nightmare. Again.
Meg scoffs and rolls her eyes. “Actually, I didn’t get at
s here, some
“Dean, I… I haven’t been a real angel in a long time. Not since I met you. I rebelled, I disobeyed orders, I... I had doubts, and reasonably so, as it turned out. You helped me see that heaven... It’s not where I belong. You showed me that I belong here on earth, with you. You‘re more family to me than my brothers and sisters have ever been.
After all, it’s always been the most likely way for him to go, right? The fact that he’d finally stopped waiting for it and tried to embrace life for once didn’t change that. And then, someone like him to making it to Heaven was quite a surprise. But then there was Bobby, and then Bobby said Cas was here too, and that definitely changed things.
, just because he wanted to get it off his chest, because he wanted Dean to know. For a brief moment, he wished he hadn’t said anything, he should’ve just kept it to himself, his grace would’ve run out by itself anyway, he-
“I know that without my grace I‘m no longer this-this powerful tool to heal you or save you, but... I hope you can forgive me for that. I hope I-I'm still enough for you like this. I just needed to do this, for you and for myself, too. And I need you to know that I’m not going to leave, that I‘m not going anywhere and that-that I‘ll be yours for as long as I live... or as long as you'll have me.”
Dean rolls his eyes, both of them fully aware that next time a situation like this rolls around, Dean will one hundred percent be doing the same thing again. He’ll absolutely worry to the point he feels sick about it before bringing it up to Cas because that’s just the person he is. He’s not gonna freak out anyone else if it’s not a big deal, right?
He listens to Cas’ steady breathing for a while, and enjoys the hand stroking up and down his back, not to forget the occasional kiss pressed onto his head. He hears a quiet call of his own name when he thinks Cas might’ve just fallen asleep, and hums in response to signal he’s awake. “Do you feel okay now? Was that the only thing on your mind?”
“I love you.”
Dean knows without a doubt that he would die for Cas in a heartbeat, no hesitation, no questions asked, although that’s not exactly news to anyone. But he won’t let Cas give his life for anyone else’s, especially Dean’s, ever again. No more deals, no more sacrifices. Cas deserves to be happy, unconditionally and genuinely happy without —
He blinks and reconsiders and something about it feels off to him. It doesn’t make any sense. Cas was going to summon the empty, this must be
They stayed like that for a while, holding each other tight and safe. Cas was the one to pull away first and the look on his face made Dean frown. “There’s something you need to know,“ was all Dean heard before he started painting out all worst-case scenarios. The deal with the empty had a catch after all, Cas was dying, Jack was dying, maybe even Sam-
The cost of Dean’s life, that is, but neither of them mention it.
He understood that his silence was what kept Cas away. If he‘d just said it back right then, if he‘d had the guts to say anything other than Don’t do this, perhaps Cas would’ve come back to him sooner.
“Okay, fine. You win.” Ash eventually admits defeat, but Dean can see he’s still pretty amused by the whole thing. Dean, however, is still a little perplexed about it all. “I bow to you, Master Charlie.”
Every day, every goddamn day Dean looks at Cas and thinks this is it, this is the most he’s capable of loving another person, he can’t possibly fall any more in love with him now, and every day he is proven wrong.
My grace, you see,... It’s been fading for a while now. At first I didn’t understand why it was happening, but then I realized that it was because of you. I wasn’t supposed to-to feel things, it was you who taught me to do that, but you know that already. Loving you has made me human, Dean, quite literally, and before you say anything, that is not a bad thing.”
When Cas thought that he’d pretty much said everything he had on his mind, he remembered that he never really answered Dean’s question.
“Oh, man,” Ash sighs in defeat, both a smile and an unmistakable blush a smile involuntarily creeping on his face and letting Dean know he’s not truly mad at Charlie.
He sighs and wishes Dean would let him do something about it, but Castiel remembers that he‘s not supposed to watch over Dean when he‘s sleeping, has been told to back off and mind his business more than one time. However, Castiel can’t help it and every now and then, when he‘s certain that Dean won’t hear him, he’ll sneak into his room make sure he‘s okay, make sure he’s sleeping and not suffering through a nightmare.
She’s sitting on a stool at the breakfast bar, glasses sunken down to the tip of her nose, glaring at the laptop screen in front of her while resting her head on one hand. There’s sounds coming from the other part of the kitchen and as Dean fully enters the room, he can see Ash digging through the shelves, easily recognizing him by the haircut and the cut off sleeves of his shirt.
Cas nodded. “The alternative was to wait for your death and meet you in heaven but... I couldn’t wait that long.“
Dean knows the middle of the night, or maybe early morning, same thing, is a terrible time to be having this conversation. To be fair though, there’s never really gonna be a good time for it. It’s been on Dean’s mind constantly since that day at Charlie’s, more than any of the other things he found out. The other things Dean was able to laugh about in a way, but not this one.
Frickin Jack and Amara, Dean thought. He remembered that going back to sleep was all the Empty ever wanted, and Jack and Amara had the power to do so, apparently. Dean frowned, quickly replayed it in his head and figured that the deal didn’t even seem half bad, unless-
He noticed the way Dean looked down to Cas' neck, the very spot where his grace used to be stored. The removal wasn't any less painful than he had anticipated, but he knew it was the right choice and the outcome would be worth it. He felt his stomach drop a little when Dean’s watery eyes found his again and it reminded him so much of that fateful night down in the dungeon. He knew Dean was thinking the same thing. Cas gently grabbed his hand and held it tightly to assure him that he wasn’t leaving, not this time.
He really didn’t plan on kissing Cas, he didn’t want to overwhelm him or scare him off since he didn’t have a whole lot of that kind of experience. But when Dean replayed everything that he’d said in his head, he was the one to be overwhelmed. Remembering what Cas had said to him in the dungeon and and finding out that he became human just to be with Dean was too much at once. A rush of love overcame him and he couldn’t hold back.
Dean didn't really know what kind of reaction he expected from Cas. Maybe to give him a confused look, do his head tilt and tell him to forget it. Dean was just making a joke, like he does all the time, usually without thinking about it beforehand. What he certainly
Cas gave the tiniest smile, but it was enough to make Dean black out for a split second. He felt the glass slip from his fingers, heard it hit the floor and shatter in a million pieces. It was like a snap back to reality, and Dean was suddenly very sure that this wasn’t a dream. He didn’t even look at the broken glass on the floor, his eyes kept staring at Cas‘ while Cas‘ were staring back at his own.
Cas perks up and frowns. “You don’t have anything to be sorry for.”
A slight sense of pressure on his shoulder pulls him back to reality. He risks a glance and sees that it’s Cas’ hand claiming that spot, his spot, with his right hand, as always. It grounds him somehow, stops his head from spinning and eases the knots in his stomach. Cas’ face is suddenly soft and all signs of concern are gone, the tiniest smile hiding in the corners of his mouth. Dean doesn’t know how he expected Cas to react but somehow it wasn’t this, something feels off, and for some reason it makes him think and it makes him realize.
Except for that now he actually had to muster up the nerve to give it to Dean and see his reaction and suddenly Cas found himself wanting to back out. Maybe it was too soon, maybe he should blow it off. He had a feeling that Dean would make it a much bigger deal than it was, he didn’t want any gifts in the first place, and Cas would have to explain himself and-
On the evening of Dean's forty-second birthday, Cas was sitting on the edge of Dean's bed, fidgeting with a small wooden box in his hands, his knees impatiently bobbing up and down. He couldn’t sit still if he wanted to and the bouncing of his legs felt weirdly calming. Cas didn’t know why he‘d been so nervous all day. He felt confident enough about Dean’s birthday gift when he first came up with it.
Dean definitely didn't miss the way Cas was mocking him, and he certainly wasn't going to let it slide. "So what? What other option do you think we had?"
“Dean,” he breathed before Dean had the chance to ask any more questions. He could taste Dean on his lips and that was a feeling he would never get used to. The fact that he could just do that, that it was allowed now, that Dean was all his and he could kiss him all he wanted, it was liberating. It was reassuring. Cas avoided Dean’s gaze and quickly looked away. He had to say something.
It wasn’t even that far fetched. People around him were always at risk, always died because of something he did. He should have known from the beginning not to get involved with Cas.
Dean can simultaneously feel his heart beat in his throat and sink down to his stomach. He doesn’t know what is happening, the only thing he can focus on is Cas right in front of his holding Dean’s face in his hand. The concern in his eyes is back and one look at his parted lips has Dean leaning back in for more, but before their lips even get to meet a hand is laid flat on Dean’s chest and holds him back.
Stressing out over nothing was definitely a human thing. Cas had always known that humans tend to overthink and overanalyze things for no good reason. Now he understood why.
“Only ‘cause Ash said I couldn’t.”
Cas had secretly wondered whether Dean would recognize what he was holding right away, and the way any emotion had quickly left Dean‘s face did neither to confirm or refute it. Dean stayed still as a statue, only stared at the contents of the box and possibly stopped breathing. In that moment, Cas wished he still had his inner compass to help him read Dean’s emotions, but he didn’t because Dean held it in his hands.
“I told her no,” Cas adds quickly and it’s the first time he meets Dean’s eyes in a while. “I said no, I said I wouldn’t hurt you, but—but then I did it anyway.”
Cas’ features slowly started to soften then, like he was finally done fighting. It was kind of a shame because angry Cas was criminally hot, but Dean really didn’t know how much longer he could take it, so he was grateful for his shift in expression. He didn’t dare move a single inch because he was sure he’d feel his dick leaking in his boxers. Cas sighed. “Me too.”
It’s not like Castiel is alway listening in on him, a normal heartbeat from another room is not something he instantly picks up on. A hammering noise like this, though? He physically can’t ignore it. Castiel is sure that if Dean knew this, he‘d tell him to stop being a creep and let him sleep in peace.
After a moment of reminiscing, it reminds him of something else, something that’s been on his mind for a short while. He turns towards Cas when he asks, as casually as one can with a question like this, “Hey, were you ever married before?”
The sound of an opening door caught Cas' attention and snapped him out of his thoughts. Looking up, he was met with Dean's eyes staring back at him from the doorway, a smile across his face. “There you are,” he said and shut the door behind him. He didn’t hesitate to kick off his boots and sit next to Cas, softly nudging his shoulder with his own. “You okay?”
Castiel doesn’t know what nightmares are like, he doesn’t need to sleep and whenever he does doze off, he doesn’t dream. All he can see is the pain they inflict upon Dean all those nights, but of course Dean rarely talks about it. Castiel can’t take away the emotional baggage Dean carries with him all the time, but he can spare him from the nightmares at least, Dean just has to let him.
Squinting her eyes, Meg stares at him. “You really don’t know, do you?” Cas squints back, confused, opens his mouth but Meg continues to speak before he can get out a single word. “Your grace, dumbass. It just went
Cas so much that he is never going to let him die for him again.
Cas only hums in agreement, or maybe he’s lost in thought because he remains quiet for a good minute. “You remember when I temporarily lost my memory ended up married to Daphne Allen?”
And the thing is, they knew. Naomi knew that Cas wasn’t on their side, not really, but she needed him to follow orders and complete their mission. She knew that Dean was his weak spot and that she needed to find a way to eradicate it.
“I love you,” Dean says again and he means it like he’s never meant anything else in his life. “I love you, I love you so much.” And
A fist softly meets Dean’s upper arm. “Why didn’t you say anything before?”
Cas swallowed the lump in his throat. It wasn't what he'd expected Dean to say but frankly, he hadn't expected him to say anything. He didn't know how to react, just watched Dean fumble with the leather string in his hands. He clumsily pinched both ends in between his fingers and tied them into a knot in the back of his neck, the glowing vial hanging on his chest like the pendant of a necklace. Cas had considered that the string could be used that way but he wasn't sure Dean would do it. It was impractical for several reasons and he wasn't sure if Dean would even want to display it that publicly. Just when he was about to say something, a quiet mumble of his name caught his attention.
“Wait,” Dean cuts in quickly because he has the terrible feeling that there might be a cosmic misunderstanding. “We didn’t need you because you were useful, Cas. We needed you ‘cause you were family.” He lifts Cas’ head with one finger hooked under his chin, forcing him to meet his eyes. “And I said that
“Hey,” Cas echoes and rubs his eyes and blinks to clear his vision. “You’re awake.”
Dean looks at Cas, confused, panicking and worrying if he overstepped already. “I need to know that you’re okay,” Cas explains plainly and calmly.
“I…” Cas’ chest rises and falls and he looks past Dean, around the room, as if trying to convince himself that they really are alone. Billie is gone, Meg is gone. No more black goo on the wall just the two of them left in the dungeon. “That was not supposed to happen.”
Finding out that Cas loves him, that he knows that Dean loves him, too. The blows just keep coming. Cas knows, he has known for god knows how long and Dean feels like an idiot. He opens his mouth to say something, he’ll figure out what exactly, but it doesn’t matter because Cas beats him to it. “I understand.”
Charlie glares at him. “You want me to dig up dirt on your boyfriend?”
The way Cas still tilts his head when he’s confused makes Dean’s lip twitch, attempting a smile. “I didn’t want to put this burden on him just because I was in need of a vessel. I wanted to make sure that this was what he wanted. I needed to be sure that
“You gonna dig up dirt on me too?” Dean asks.
“What’s wrong?” Cas says, his eyebrows drawn together and full of concern.
okay?”
“There‘s no catch. It all worked out and-and we won’t ever see the Emtpy again,“ Cas explained like he knew exactly what Dean was thinking. He could read Dean like an open book, for the most part.
“The things you said to me. You said—you said that we’re family and that—and that you needed me.”
“Dean,” Cas says in that soft fucking voice that makes Dean feel like he’s about to turn into a puddle on the floor and he can’t take it, not right now, not after everything he just said. He blinks to clear his vision but it all goes to hell when Cas asks, “Are
“It was to me.” Cas’ hands wrapped around Dean’s in their laps because the way their legs are bent and tangled, there’s no way of telling where Dean ends and where Cas begins. His thumb strokes Dean’s palm, and a short moment passes where neither of them knows what to say. “You know, all of those false versions of you—they fought back. They begged me to stop. None of them just—just let it happen the way you did. Or said the things you did.”
You know, I once explained to Jack that it was part of our celestial existence to watch humans come and go. I told him that they only live for a very brief time and that we’d have to carry on without them at some point. But... It doesn’t have to be this way. I don’t want to do this without you one day. I-I can’t even imagine it. Not if I don’t have to.”
until Cas stops worrying about it. Dean feels like Cas has been worrying about this one for some time, so while he feels bad about lying to Cas about meeting Jimmy, he’s glad they could clear things up.
“And here we have the reason why,” she says in a slow and sarcastically happy voice. “Dean Winchester. The human who caused our little angel to fall from grace.”
He’s never had a particularly good feeling about them combining their tech abilities though. One day, Dean’s sure about that, they’re gonna crack all of Heaven’s code and they’re gonna be unstoppable. Hell, they could probably stop being dead and go back to earth if they tried hard enough. For his own sanity, Dean tries not to think about it to much.
Dean’s breath got caught in his throat and he turned his head sideways, the pressure of Cas’ eyes on him making him feel more anxious that Heaven should allow. Cas, however, wouldn’t have it. One of his hands grabbed Dean’s cheek, effectively keeping him in place. It was quite a moment for Dean’s tented pants, the brutally honest question made his dick flag but Cas’ forceful grip on his face made it go back up. He still averted Cas’ eyes when he repeated, “I’m sorry.”
The second thing was that maybe Dean was a dumbass, too. He’d thought Cas didn’t love him back either. To his defense, he didn’t even think Cas could love him back. He’d never thought a celestial being could catch human feelings, much less for him. He’d thought all those years everyone had been making fun of their relationship because they knew it was a lost cause, like they knew Cas could never love Dean back.
He is cut off by Meg lifting her hand and making a fist and then Cas is on his knees, an invisible hand holding him tight and steady at her mercy. Cas lets out a small cry of pain and it immediately snaps Dean out of his haze. “Stop,” he yells, at least he means to, but his voice fails him and it comes out much quieter and desperate than he intended. Meg turns to look at him as he tries to push himself to his feet but her glare keeps him pinned to the wall, unable to move.
You can imagine his surprise when none of those people were even remotely willing to accept his apology. Charlie hugged him so tight he started wondering if he could still die of suffocation, then she smacked his arm and left a small but deeply purple bruise that Dean knew wasn’t going to fade anytime soon. His mother was a little more gentle, thinking Dean didn’t notice the tear rolling down her cheek, but he did. He had a beer with Bobby and they clinked their bottles when Bobby brought up the absence of John Winchester in this town.
. “You what?”
Dean could only ever think about Cas beating him up in that moment, that night in the crypt, breaking Dean’s arm and his nose probably more, it all started to blur together at some point. He’d thought being brainwashed by Heaven would do the job without any complications.
they’re here, and then there’s his parents—well, his mom lives down the road, and Bobby is only a short drive away.
And suddenly Cas is beaming, the big smile across his face almost distracts Dean from his tear tracked cheeks. He chuckles and lifts his hand from Dean’s shoulder up to his cheek and Dean immediately leans into the touch. “I love you, too, Dean. Always.”
Dean—well, he got hard. Like, immediately. He could feel his brain go offline as all the blood rushed to where he really didn’t need it to go right now. In his defense, this kind of dominance was an insanely good look on Cas. Always has been, to be fair, and this surely wasn’t the first boner he was trying to hide from him, but it was probably one of the less appropriate ones. He had his brows furrowed and his lips parted, and he was staring Dean down with such intensity—
which you
Dean swallowed. He needed to say something but his brain short circuited and all that came out was, “Oh, you wanna kiss me so bad.“
Eight whole months had passed when Dean thought that maybe, just maybe, he might have to move on at some point. He‘d lost people he loved before. While that didn’t mean that it‘d hurt any less this time around, Dean knew he would eventually be able to deal with it. He‘d get over it. He‘d have to stop blaming himself one day because, as always, he felt responsible for someone else dying.
“No, don’t you apologize for that again. It’s okay.”
Dean keeps a straight face for about ten seconds before he bursts out laughing. He had trouble believing it when Charlie told him about that particular memory, said there was no way Dean didn’t know about something like that, but apparently he was wrong because Cas just confirmed what Dean knew before. “How come you never mentioned that?”
Dean was perplexed. “You‘re what?“ he asked, rhetorically but also seriously, as he was definitely not sure if he heard that right.
“I‘m human. Angels aren’t allowed on earth anymore so I-I had to become human.“
“I was aware of what was happening—of what I was doing,” he starts, his gaze lost somewhere on the bed, probably the messy sheets, avoiding Dean’s eyes at all cost. “But I couldn’t stop it. I think—I think I didn’t even want to stop it. I couldn’t tell right from wrong anymore.”
He can see Cas open his mouth to say something else, but Dean won’t let him. He shuts him up with a kiss, but this time there’s nothing soft or gentle about it. Dean cups Cas’ face in one hand to keep him in place, pull him closer even, and kisses him like the world depended on it.
Hesitantly, Cas looks back at him, and his mouth forms a small, sad smile. “I think you know how.”
Cas shakes his head without thinking twice. “I almost forgot about that until you asked about it.”
Yeah, that tracks. “I don’t wanna know
“What? No,” Dean replies a little to fast because if he thinks about it, maybe it bothers him a little. They probably never got divorced so legally (for lack of a better word) speaking, they’re still married. Unless the whole ‘till death do us part’ thing applies, in which case Cas is off the hook. Either way, it doesn’t
“No,” Dean says with not a shadow of doubt. “Not intentionally, at least. I just didn’t know how else to reach you.” Dean bites his lip while hesitating about whether or not he should say anything more before he decides fuck it, Cas is already baring his heart to him so Dean owes it to him to do the same. “I was gonna say something else, actually. But I didn’t know—I was just coming to terms with the fact that—well, that I might love you more than a friend.”
“That’s not what you said.”
Dean gave a small nod in acknowledgement. He was still trying to wrap his head around it. He‘d spent an awful lot of time praying to Jack, begging for help and cursing his name when he wouldn’t answer him. He was listening after all, he was already working on a plan. Should‘ve just been patient, Dean figured, because of course Jack was going to bring Cas back. He should never have doubted the kid.
And he really does. Fully bends over not just his head but his whole upper body as if he just met the Queen of England. Who, by the way, is probably around here somewhere. Jesus, all those famous dead people can’t be that far away. He silently laughs at his own internal monologue because yeah, that includes
“Cas, come on,” Dean says, louder than he meant to, and Cas jumps a little at the tone. “It’s long forgotten, man. You snapped out of it just in time, right?”
The door suddenly makes a creaky noise and Dean looks up, visibly surprised and confused, maybe even a little embarrassed . “Cas? What are you doing here?“
Granted, he’s still gonna make fun of them, and it doesn’t mean he’s gonna enjoy sitting through Love Actually with Cas
He knew alcohol wouldn’t make him feel any better, but it wouldn’t make him feel worse either. He refilled his glass, again, put the bottle on the side table and leaned back in the armchair.
There was no rational reason for Dean to keep clinging onto the keys, so he threw them over to Cas. They were married after all, the Impala belonged to Cas just as much as it did to Dean.
Castiel thinks. The way Dean‘s words contradict Castiel‘s perception of his state of mind and soul. He can read neither thoughts nor feelings, obviously, but Castiel does pick up on both of those things if he‘s involved in any way. It’s similar to praying, just more implicit and usually subconscious. He’s never had a particularly hard time receiving these kinds of blurry prayers from Dean, given the strong connection the two of them share.
, he thought. That one time he lost his grace for a few weeks did nothing to prepare him for any of this. Cas wished he knew if it was going to be like this all the time, but he couldn't talk to anyone about it. Not yet.
There’s a sudden shift in Cas’ mood that Dean doesn’t fail to notice. “Dude, don’t worry about it. It’s fine.”
“You shouldn’t be here yet, Dean.” Cas looked around the room and Dean’s cock twitched at the sound of his name. Cas’ face softened when his eyes met Dean’s again. “You—You’re not supposed to be here.”
There was, however, a tiny problem. One that Dean should’ve seen coming, to be honest.
Dean realizes now what broke the connection.
He was definitely a little embarrassed about it, but only because they’d had sex less than an hour ago and regardless of how time works up here, there was absolutely no way for him to even be hard again already.
The moment the thought entered his head, he immediately felt ashamed. Cas was without a doubt the greatest thing that ever happened to Dean. Despite everything, he was so grateful to have met the angel. How could he just forget him like that? How could he even think about moving on when Cas gave everything for him?
Cas had been dreading this question like none other even though he knew it would come. There were so many reasons and so many things he needed to get off his chest, but he didn't want to overwhelm Dean, again. He took a deep breath.
the answer, Cas steps back and points at the oven. “I think the lasagna is ready, will you set the table?”
Instead, Castiel stays silent and wonders when exactly he started to know Dean better than himself and read him like an open book. He stares at his hands in his lap and hears Dean take a deep breath when he finally finds his voice. “I‘m sorry.“
Cas’ reaction is hard to read. He swallows visibly but keeps his eyes on Dean’s. “I remember,” he replies, clearly wary of what’s about to come, but without instantly demanding an explanation which Dean is grateful for.
Dean falters. It’s true and it’s coming out of Cas’ mouth.
because Dean knows better than to push himself into another Did-you-meet-Jimmy-somewhere situation. What would he even say this time, ‘I ran into the djinn queen at the bakery, she sends her regards’? Not likely. He thinks he did just fine this time.
“Me?” Dean frowns.
“I’m proving a point,” she says tiredly, as if that explains anything. “Ash said if he can’t find Heaven’s backdoor, neither can I.”
Sure, Dean might have spent more than the past half year desperately wishing for and dreaming about this moment, but he never actually thought about what would happen afterwards. He just needed his best friend to be alive, that’s all he could think about.
“I‘ll take the drink.“
Cas nods, silently understanding Dean’s concern. “How did it fit into the funny category anyway?”
“I want you to have it because I trust you to take care of it, Dean. I know that it’s safe with you.“
Maybe Dean just thought he had to be the one to do it. Cas had given everything for him, the least he could do is save him from death like Cas had saved him all those years ago. Dean forced himself to stop overthinking it, he’d take any way to bring the angel back. He tried to swallow down the lump in his throat. “How long have you been back?“
Later that night, when Dean is up and thinking, he smiles at the sight of Cas sleeping soundly.
There’s a tense silence while Dean’s mind is working at full speed, trying to come up with something to diffuse the situation. Cas is eventually the one to speak up first. “You just said what I needed to hear.”
Dying, you see—It’s not very hard. Dean should have a first place medal for it. Hell, for someone like him it seems easier than staying alive most of the time. Actually staying dead, however, that’s something he doesn’t have a lot of experience with.
of everything, Cas loves him.
Dean’s eyes were focused on the dark road ahead. His jaw was clenched, hands gripping the steering wheel tightly and his foot flat on the gas pedal. He was worn out from a hunt and tired from hours and hours of driving, he really couldn’t wait to get to bed. Cas was sitting motionlessly in the passenger seat, staring at the passing landscape outside the window, even though there was nothing to see and Cas probably couldn't make out much more than his own reflection. The atmosphere was tense and neither of them had said a single word during the entire ride. Dean, for his part, thought there wasn't much to say anyway.
Cas rolls his eyes and props himself up on one elbow while the other is s resting near its designated spot on Dean’s shoulder. “You were awake before me.”
Dean’s throat closes up a little. God, if he’d had any idea what he meant to Cas back then already. Dean left him to die in Purgatory and Cas needed his head screwed with to even try to harm Dean. It’s not fair, it’s never been fair because Cas always gave and gave and gave and Dean never gave anything in return. “Cas,” he says, but Cas ignores him.
She does, but the cliffnotes version of infinity is still infinity.
Dean tries his absolute best to remain calm but this is kind of a big revelation and he’s shaking all over, can feel his fingers shiver and his heart beat in his throat. This shouldn’t even be news to him, he was aware of what happened back then, just not the extent, as it seems.
Dean takes a moment to collect himself and eventually agrees that yeah, maybe talking to Cas is usually the right things to do. What is there to be afraid of anyway, Cas saying the memory is fake and Dean stressed out over nothing? Cas saying that it’s real and Dean’s gonna have a mental breakdown over it? He can’t tell, but he knows that whichever it’ll be, he’ll finally have clarity and Cas is going to stay right by his side, no matter what happens.
He wasn’t sure which one he‘d prefer. Having Sam sit with him did feel reassuring sometimes. Even though Cas was gone, his brother was still there. It wasn’t the same thing, of course, but it did make Dean feel a little less alone.
“Do you remember,” Dean starts and immediately cuts himself off when he realizes he said it out loud and not just in his head. Cas’ features are soft and relaxed, and Dean really doesn’t want to ruin it with what he’s about to say. Dean falls silent.
Dean anything since it was already there. The sight of the tiny smile on Dean’s face calmed his nerves a tiny bit.
“Yes, that sounds more like it,” Cas agrees and they look at each other for a short moment before Dean’s eyes momentarily fall shut. “Are you still tired?”
“I... This is-“ Cas stuttered because he realized that he even didn’t know what to say. He sighed and held the box out for Dean to take. “Happy birthday, Dean.“
A few seconds later Dean realizes that shit, he’s right. He feels fine though, now that they’ve talked about it he feels infinitely better than he did when he woke up earlier. “I’m fine, I think I’m just… processing.”
A small scoff comes out of Dean‘s mouth before he shakes his head just the tiniest bit. He looks down at his hands in his lap and Castiel takes the silence as his cue to leave. The door is nearly shut behind him when a quiet call of Castiel‘s name stops him. After a short moment of deliberation, he sticks his head back into the room and sees Dean staring up at him with a soft face. He opens his mouth as if to say something, but then he freezes. “Nevermind,“ he mumbles, breaking eye contact.
“I don’t know,” Dean says although he knows very well, and he quickly changes his mind to admit so. “No, actually I was just worried. About this last thing.”
“Dean,” Cas’ voice suddenly rings in his ears, “Breathe.”
“Did you,” Dean stammers because if he falls silent again he might never get it out. “Did Naomi make you kill fake versions of me before? So you wouldn’t hesitate for the real thing?”
If Ash was the kind of person to blush when being embarrassed, now would be the time, but instead Ash proudly nods. “He threw up on my jeans later that night and I never saw him again.”
It felt strange, unfathomably weird for Dean to get into the passenger seat and find Cas on his left, staring at the wheel like the car was gonna drive itself. He looked stressed, maybe uncomfortable.“You do remember how to drive a car, right?”
. Thinking about Cas being strategically trained to pull through and kill Dean, that’s different.
Except for that happy was still a long way to go for Dean. He was miserable, heartbroken, lonely. He barely slept more than three hours a night. Sometimes he had nightmares, other times he would just spend the entire night tossing and turning and beating himself up for, well, pretty much everything he ever messed up. Sam was worried about him, but Dean kept assuring him that this was just how he was dealing with things. He wasn’t fine, and Sam knew that, but Dean kept reassuring his brother that he would be fine at some point. He just had to get there.
Charlie doesn’t say anything to that. Her eyebrows nearly meet her hairline and she tilts her head at Ash, clearly waiting for something.
Dean suddenly speaks up and rips Castiel from his thoughts. “I just get these dreams.“ He stares straight ahead and doesn’t notice the way Castiel looks at him to show that he‘s listening. “I know they’re not real, but- It fucks me up. Every night.“
Dean snorts. “Buddy, that doesn’t count as married.”
Once he’s out of there, he throws his bags in the backseat and starts the car. The drive to Charlie’s place is just as long as Dean needs it to be. He listens to the mixtape Cas made for him a while ago in full and arrives at Charlie’s doorstep the minute the last song ends.
Charlie’s grin fades into a genuine smile when she looks at Dean. “I was just digging up some dirt on Ash from Heaven’s iCloud.”
Cas breaks eye contact in favor of staring at the bloody hand print he left on Dean’s jacket. “It’s gone.”
“Dean,“ Cas whispered and reached out to Dean’s hand, effectively wrapping Dean’s fingers around the vial.
Dean put his hands on Cas‘ cheeks, holding his face in his hands and pulling him close while Cas‘ hands cautiously found Dean‘s waist. Cas was kissing him back just as fiercely as Dean hoped he would. Their lips moved in perfect sync like they were made for one another. It felt so right that Dean wished he had done this a long time ago.
After a long uncomfortable silence, they eventually made it back to the bunker and entered the library just past midnight. Cas was walking straight towards the hallway and Dean knew that he had to be the one to speak up if he didn't want to go to bed angry and frustrated. He stopped in his tracks and carelessly dropped his bag on the floor, the loud noise forcing Cas to stop and turn around. He looked at Dean with an unbelievably annoyed look on his face.
he said the wrong thing. It wasn’t a lie, just not what Cas wanted to hear.
With one swift flick of her wrist, Cas is thrown across the room, his head hitting the wall with a bump. His body remains still for a moment but when he finally opens his eyes, Dean releases a breath he didn’t know he was holding.
“Stop thinking so hard, I haven’t said anything yet,“ Cas told him and Dean was reminded once again how well the angel could read him. His playful tone calmed Dean‘s nerves. He took a deep breath and motioned for Cas to continue. “Jack and Amara have been trying to restructure and rebuild Heaven. There‘s new rules and laws.“
“Oh, he’s right,” Meg admits in a disgustingly sweet tone before returning her gaze down to Cas and lowering her voice to a menacing sneer. “Unfortunately.”
“You knew, didn’t you?”
Castiel knows he shouldn’t bother him, should just leave him alone and give him time to cool off, but he’ll take the fact that Dean left his door open just a tiny bit as an invitation. He pushes against it and slowly sets one foot over the threshold, peaking his head through the crack. The lamp on the bedside table illuminates the room just enough for Castiel to make out Dean sitting in the middle of the bed, blanket over his legs and his head in his hands. His chest is heaving, his fingers pressing into the top of his head, his eyes squeezed shut. Castiel hates seeing Dean this miserable and hurt.
“You don’t have to say anything,” Cas whispers because of course he can read Dean like a fucking book. He always could. Mostly.
Castiel waits and listens for a couple minutes, Dean‘s heartbeat not showing any signs of slowing down. Some nights it takes longer than others, but Dean always manages to fall back asleep at some point, so Castiel tries not to worry too much. He continues reading his book but realizes that he's hardly paying attention a few pages in, weirdly unable to shake the feeling that something is off tonight. Making a quick deicsion, he puts the book down and gets on his feet before quietly walking down the hall to Dean‘s room. He can hear him breathe heavily, heart beating against his chest.
“What do you mean?”
“But I’m a lot smarter than you, so.”
They get out of the car at the same time, Dean sighing in relief and victory because he managed to make it through a full car ride with Cas in the driver’s seat without sporting a boner. Because apparently, that’s the kind of accomplishment he gets excited about these days.
Dean really should’ve thought this through. He’s just not sure how Cas would react if he knew Dean was secretly going through his memories. It’s a massive breach of privacy, that’s for sure, it’s why he made Charlie look for interesting or funny things only. He knows that there’s nothing Cas is actively trying to hide from him, so there’s no need to go looking for it. And besides, Cas probably just handed him the best excuse he’s gonna get, so Dean jumps at it. “Yeah. Yup, totally did. He, uh, says hi.”
Dean, of course, had claimed from the beginning that he didn’t want any gifts, but Cas learned from Sam that people often say that without meaning it. He thought about what Dean could possibly enjoy, if there was anything he’d mentioned that he wanted or needed. Cas remembered the mixtape he once received as a gift back when he didn’t quite understand the concept of gift-giving yet.
Dean’s mouth fell open and it was evident that he was at a loss for words. Cas could see his eyes drop down to the vial in his hand, shutting them slowly before he found his voice. “I don’t know what to say.”
“Dean–” Cas tries to warn him but again, he doesn’t get to finish.
Really, nobody could blame Dean for thinking with his dick, or for completely forgetting about all the rage that had been boiling inside him just seconds before. Cas’ arm square across Dean’s chest to hold him in place didn’t make it better, it just gave Dean some strange sense of déjà vu.
He takes a minute to process. “That’s what you meant by ‘Heaven’s trapdoor’?”
“Hm,” is Cas’ reply after a moment of consideration. “I didn’t know that was possible.”
“She and Ash hacked into the system, or whatever. Heaven. She said it contains every person’s memories of like, everything ever.” He feels a little bad about not being able to be more technical about it, Charlie
He held his breath when Cas spoke up. “I learned that people tend to keep one-sided feelings for themselves, to not make the other uncomfortable.“
“It was just a matter of time, anyway. A few years, maybe a decade, and it would have been depleted by itself, and that’s alright because I... sometimes I feel like I don’t even want it anymore, because it’s not who I am anymore. I don’t need it. And it’s not much good anyway, since... what you’re holding is all that’s left. I thought there would be more, but... that’s all of it. I guess I should have known.“
you, in case you forgot,” he said through grinded teeth and narrowed eyes, his hand dropping from Dean’s face to his chest, poking him with a single finger. “I wanted you to
“I’ll take that as a yes,” Charlie says, clicks some more, and giggles when a new window pops up. “Alright, Ash got his first real kiss at some new years eve party when he was fifteen—”
Dean frowned and looked from Cas‘ face down to the box back up to his face. “You didn't have to get me anything.“
They both laugh at the memory. Dean doesn’t think he’ll ever be able to forget that day, the feeling in his chest when discovering that Cas was alive. He didn’t know what it meant back then, but in retrospect it was pretty obvious.
“Good to see you, Castiel,” she says, her voice reproachful but also kind of indifferent. “Although I did not quite expect it to go this way.”
Dean rolls his eyes again and puts his head back down where it was resting on Cas’ chest. They’ve had that argument enough times for Dean to know not to bother with it. Jesus, he might finally understand all those cheesy romcom couples he used to make fun of.
‘cause you were at the wedding, and second of all… Yeah, kind of. Is he in the system too?”
Dean raises one eye brow. Ash covers his face with one hand and runs the other through his hair. Looking back and forth between him and Charlie, Dean eventually replies, “Not particularly.”
Cas. The way he uses way too many emojis when texting. The way he listens to Dean’s music when Dean’s not even sure he really likes it. The way he looks at Dean like he’s the moon and the stars. No more divine boundaries, Cas is human and he’s in love with Dean.
Of course, Cas would want him to continue, that much Dean was sure of. He didn’t die for Dean to spend the rest of his life mourning him. He‘d always wanted Dead to be happy.
They stay out there for a while after everyone’s left, said they’d just finish their drinks but that was several drinks ago. Still, they’re only as drunk as they wish to be (Heaven’s rules and all that), which is not a lot. Cas is a little tipsy, Dean feels mostly sober.
Dean leans back in and they kiss until Dean feels dizzy and stupid and his lips are swollen and he can’t tell left from right anymore, he’ll be glad if he can remember his own damn name.
“Stop,” Cas argued, “stop apologizing.” He moved towards Dean again and Dean instinctively stepped back, his body hitting the wall again. Cas stopped only a few inches short of Dean’s face. “Just tell me why. Why did you just—give up?”
Dean doesn’t notice the tears in his eyes for a while. There’s not even that many, he can blink them away without too much effort, but Cas probably noticed already. Cas always notices. “I’m sorry I brought it up.”
himself. He’ll have to ask Cas about it.
. Jesus.
“But how?”
Cas sighed and rolled his eyes. “You were wounded and had blood everywhere, I physically had to drag you to the car,
He loved Cas so much that he was going to let him die for him again.
Dean knew before that it’d sound ridiculous, but now that Cas puts it like that, it sounds much dumber than he anticipated. He quickly racks his brain for an explanation and surprisingly finds something useful. “I almost got married in Vegas once.”
what I wanted.”
“I‘m not in the mood for your smart words, Sammy,“ he said, loud enough for his brother to hear in the war room. “Either you drink with me or you leave me alone.“
He feels like everything changed but somehow nothing is different. Cas is still Dean’s best friend, always has been and always will be. Dean will still look at him like he put the stars in the sky, he figures he just doesn’t have to do it in secret anymore.
“Just wondering.”
he wants to say because it’s true. Dean has never deserved any of the guilt and the pain that has been dumped on him. His soul, with all its scars and all the damage it has taken, is still the most beautiful thing Castiel has ever seen. He wishes he wasn’t so painfully aware of Dean‘s self doubt and the way he can barely look at himself in the mirror. He wants to tell Dean that he deserves more than this life but he’s scared that Dean wouldn’t agree.
Dean nodded at that, but Cas didn’t think he believed him. The room was silent for a few seconds while they were both staring at one another, Cas desperately trying to think of a smart thing to stay. When he heard Dean draw a breath and open his mouth, Cas had to act. Or speak, it would have been the easier choice, but his body decided to betray him and he found himself leaning forward and pushing his lips against Dean’s vigorously. Dean steadied himself with one hand behind his back to keep from falling onto his back. He didn’t get to put the other one on Cas’ neck to pull him in because Cas was already pulling back. Dean furrowed his eyebrows in utter confusion. “What was that for?”
It’s taken Dean years to come to terms with his feelings, and then another few years to make peace with the fact that he would just have to live with it. It was better this way for several reasons. Cas has been his best friend for so long, Dean has flat out told him that he sees him as a brother, he is one of the two most important people in Dean’s life. Of course, Dean knew that Cas is not the kind of person who would ditch his best friend for being in love with him, but Dean wasn’t going to risk anything. And besides, Dean didn’t think he could even handle being rejected, which he was always sure would happen. It’s just that he never thought of the insane possibility of
“I had a feeling,” Cas confirms. “But I knew that you weren’t ready to face it.”
“You-Why wouldn’t I want to see you?“ Dean pretty much ignored what Cas had said before because this last sentence really felt like a punch in the face. He thought about what he could have possibly said or done to make Cas think he wouldn’t be absolutely thrilled to have him back. It pained him to remember their last time together. Dean hadn’t said much at all, taking in everything Cas was saying took all his energy and left him mute. Cas had poured out his whole heart and Dean just stayed silent.
Dean speaks first. “Hey.”
It makes Dean laugh even harder because it sounds straight up nuts if you think about it. However, if there’s any good excuse for failing to mention a literal marriage, being stranded in Scooby world is probably the one. “So,” Dean tries to say, then catches his breath and calms down before trying again, “So you’re the djinn king then?”
s there. It was a lot. All he knows for sure is that it started with Cas wrapping his pretty lips around Dean’s cock and taking him all the way in until the tip was down his throat, and that it ended with Cas pushing him down on the kitchen table and fucking him six ways to Sunday before he coming deep inside his ass.
“Neither are you, pal.” Dean’s comebacks were strong as always.
