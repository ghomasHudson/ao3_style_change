2) I have a lot of anger towards Clint Barton right now, okay. Like I love my son and everything, but he can be a right douche sometimes.
So that’s how his wife found him, two hours and thirty seven minutes later; making loops through the halls that overlooked the woods. Baby Nate was resting his head on his father’s shoulder, making utterly pitiful whimpers and snuffling, mumbling to himself. Clint himself had run through his entire nursery rhyme repertoire, which usually worked at home, and most of his child friendly stories. He was all out begging his son to please calm down when Laura came striding down the hall, her arms extended to take the baby.
Needless to say, being in the presence of the other man had always made Tony feel about an inch tall. So, what had he done? He’d confirmed every ill-conceived word on Natasha’s report. Textbook narcissism? Fine, Tony would plaster on a smile and brag about everything he had ever done; nobody needed to know that he only repeated it like a mantra to reassure himself that he still had the potential to do some good in the world. Selfish? He’d drop half a fortune on meaningless galas and stupid watches. Iron Man, yes? He’d update the suits as much as he could, would butt into SHIELD missions and debriefs to the press just to mock them. Tony Stark, not recommended? He’d pretend like that hadn’t stung and throw a one liner about how much he didn’t want to join their super-secret boy band. Nobody needed to know how much it had hurt, how lower his self-esteem had been, as he thought about how disappointed Aunt Peggy would have been of him if she’d been coherent enough to know.
that Tony would never send Viz as a decoy, or that Viz would even let himself be used that way, he had worried. He had had an irrational fear that if he lost Wanda then part of the reason he was even on the run would go up in flames.
Before Steve can open his mouth to say anything, Tony turns around with a proud smile on his face. He has a bowl of cereal on his hand and he places it in front of Steve, then one in front of Rhodey and another on the space next to the blond. Then, he brings the coffees over. He places a plain white mug with the words “Espresso Patronum” on the empty space next to his cereal, another one with the words “I am an
This is fine, he screams at himself, this is the best solution. He cannot have any of his children so close to danger. One of these alien fuckers had been enough to wipe the floor with four enhanced people. There is no way he will have any of his kids around for that kind of showdown. If these were the appetizers, God only knows what Thanos will do with them once they get close enough to attack.
“That’s my job, Pete,” Tony joked in an attempt at levity, but Peter is stubborn, just as stubborn as Tony or worse. Like Steve.
he can offer Tony. He had barely been able to offer his body to the genius, and nothing had made him more thankful for his growth spur before moving to Boston than getting to have Tony in his arms. Only, a small part of his brain that still appears to be working tells him, Tony would have loved him with or without the hundred pounds of muscle. Steve knows this, Tony has told him this numerous times, and yet his self-hatred convinces him otherwise.
“Tony,” Steve’s voice sounds wrecked and it makes the alarm bells in the mechanic’s mind go off in warning. There are actual tears in Steve’s eyes and he doesn’t know what he did or said wrong this time. “Why didn’t you tell me? why weren’t you at the funeral?”
“Wasting each other’s time, huh?” Tony brings his arm up to his face stiffly, like DUM-E did before Tony updated him, and wipes at his cheeks. “I guess that tells me how much this meant to you.” And then it happens, Steve has seen him do this so many times. Has hated each and every time he has to put on the mask and fake indifference. It burns like acid on his skin to know he put that mask there and there is nothing he can do to fix it. “Okay, Steve. I understand.”
you. I left myself wide open for you, all of you, and at the first sign of trouble you turned on me. You turned on me for someone that had tried to destroy us. I should have known,” Tony bemoaned raising a shaking hand to rub at his forehead. “I should have known that you all would be just like everyone else. Ty, Obie, everyone else who’d taught me better, and I
It’s all downhill from there. Similar to how things went with the team, Tony does nothing but watch the progression of things. T’Challa brings forth the arrest of the former Avengers and the, surprisingly enough, lack of fair trial. He brings forth the footage of the Raft and the conditions under which Wanda, unfortunately a legal adult though young nonetheless, was kept by Ross’s orders. The General turns back, furious, to seek Tony but all he does is stare defiantly back. Tony isn’t just buying the Avengers’ freedom here, after all.
“That’s enough, Colonel,” Tony says sternly. His fingers are shaking now, the emotional rollercoaster he has been on all day finally taking a toll, and he shakes his head when Rhodey glares at him. “Please, wait for me in the car with Happy. I’m assuming he’s the one that brought you.”
Tony swallows the mouthful of ham and rye and tries not to squirm. It’s not that he was purposefully withholding information. It’s just that… okay, who is he kidding, that’s exactly what he was doing. “Everything is so… shitty,” there’s a sigh and a giggle on the other side, and Tony bites his lip. “It’s hard enough as it is. I… I guess I wanted to keep the peace for a bit longer.”
P.S. You all are helping me beat my writer's block, and after months of it i am so infinitely thankful to each one of you out there.
Wanda’s arms are wrapped around herself as if that will keep her together. Her fingertips flash red sparks in what everyone in the room recognizes as her nervous tick. “Bruce,” she acknowledges softly. “You were all dead, and Stark was the only one left. He—I don’t know how—I just—it was just him, and you, Captain.”
“He’s right,” Steve says, but before Rhodey can puff up even more in anger, he directs his eyes to Hawkeye and pins him with an intense stare. “I have no right to act like I’m somehow better than you. Not after what I did.”
“Yeah, bud. It worked! It worked this time!” and Tony, because there is not a single thing he can ever keep from his son, can feel the tears running down his cheeks. He’s smiling wide enough to hurt, and his heart is pounding to a beat that aches, but god. God. It’s the best news, and the only thing he could think about was sharing this moment with his son. His constant.
Tony gets to his feet and hands the baby to Laura. She grabs hold of his wrist once Nate has settled again, and scrutinizes his face. He tries to project calm so she doesn’t feel the need to defend him. He’s driven enough of a drift in their marriage to add more distance. She nods, and squeezes one last time before letting him.
Tony finds him sitting at the breakfast bar in the kitchen, a Starkpad propped up on its casing and a calculus textbook open at his elbow. From somewhere, Fred’s voice (“Dad! It’s Ned! You’ve known him for like 10 years!”) is going on and on about some lego set he just got. Tony smiles as he makes his way to the fridge for a drink, partly stalling and partly just enjoying the familiar sound of his son jabbering on with his friend.
He managed to only destroy three of them, barely, before he decided that he had burned enough excess energy. Once he was done, he made his way into the kitchen realizing until then that he was starving. He was wiping his face with his towel so he didn’t see the man rushing out of the kitchen. Tony collided solidly with his chest; Steve’s immediately shooting forward to keep him from falling.
“Bucky killed Tony’s parents,” Steve says without preamble, and then sags against the table. Tony feels like he can’t breathe. “I knew since—“the Captain’s next breath hitches. “I knew since the incident in the Triskellion and I didn’t tell him. I—I thought—I didn’t want him to know. I thought I was protecting them both, but I—
“And you are. I would not jeopardize your safety if he weren’t here on good will,” T’Challa says. His tone has a soft note of reprimand.
okay, stop, while they stayed in the den and cuddled and kissed and probably made out even though Tony was
my worst fear, Barton. Has she told you what she showed me?” Clint was shaking his head before his brain had really connected. Stark was… manic, is the only way the archer could describe him, now. He ran a shaking hand through his head and took a step away from Clint. “You were all dead, Barton. Every single one of you. Even Thor and the Hulk, who I—it’s unthinkable, for me, imagining
He had failed the man before him much more than he could have ever imagined, he knows. He might as well have been the man to wrap his fingers around Maria’s neck. There are so many ways for someone to die, he realizes, that go for far longer than their physical death. And now, seeing Tony shaking and biting his lip bloody in his attempt to keep his emotions in check, he realizes that he may have more than just blood on his hands.
“Hey, Cap,” Tony said distractedly, the lenses of his glasses lit up with numbers and words. Steve had barely opened his mouth to reply when the man patted him on the arm and rushed out to the elevator.
He’s rocking himself back and forth on his seat, elbows on his thighs and his fingers tearing at his hair, as he tries to gulp in air. His chest feels tight, though, the belts and zippers on his suit constraining and, God, everything is so fucking hot. Why is everything so hot, the air, the suit, the seat, the tears running down his cheeks. Jesus. Christ, what is he going to do. He was supposed to protect them. He was supposed to be there. He was his husband, Peter’s Papa, he was supposed to keep them fucking safe and now—now—
Tony chuckles softly. “He’ll take you home. I can’t guarantee it’s going to be a pleasant ride, but… I just. I have one more stop here.” He gestures to the rest of the cemetery, and Steve just looks back at him. Giving him the chance to open up if he wants to. “I haven’t said hello to Jarvis in a while,” he suddenly feels boyish and he scrubs the toe of his shoe on the grass. As always, J makes him feel younger and safer than he actually is. The grief is slowly crawling back out, and he doesn’t feel ready to share it with Steve yet.
life when did this become my life? Colonel Rhodes, you’re seeing him too, right?!” Tony can discern the voice even before he hits the kitchen. The kid rambles almost as much as he used to when he was that age, and it immediately puts a smile on Tony’s face. Rhodey and his dastardly plans that always seem to work. The man knows Tony won’t stick around long unless there is a reason for him to do so.
The other Steve says, and the real one jerks on the other side of the glass. He brings a fist up to the glass separating him from the scene but can’t bang on it as he wishes to do. He can’t let Tony send him away. Not now when he knows that this,
Plus, Tony would never. Despite how much Steve had fucked up, all the bridges he had burned, Tony was better than that. Tony had always been better than that.
“No wonder the Stark Foundation has been everywhere since then. What was it? Trying to ease the guilt of creating a homicidal robot?” Barton says, and the tone of his voice is cruel.
“What the fuck is he doing here? You said we were safe here,” Clint bites out. Sam has an arm around him, now, and the rest of them have made their way in.
Self-loathing drips out of Tony’s words despite his cavalier tone. How had he not noticed that? How had nobody clued in to the fact that every time the genius listed his shortcomings it wasn’t looking for adulation, but had merely been confirming what he already thought of himself?
. And then he tells about getting the call, and telling Tony, and how he just—he lost it, you know? His Mama was gone, and that just—it shattered him. So I borrowed a car from Jarvis and I went looking for him, and there was—there was left over police tape and debris and—and
the bitter angry part of Tony that sounds too much like Howard bites out. The other part, though, the part that is battered and hurt, says quietly that he’s already halfway there. Instead of voicing his conflict, Tony just nods. Steve’s eyes are still infinitely sad, but he nods back at the mechanic.
“Spare me the hypocrisy,” Tony says incredulously before Wanda or Barton can make a case for themselves. Steve turns red rimmed eyes towards him. Tony’s anger makes him cruel. “You can pretend you give a shit about me or my
“Here and well,” Barton says and there is a note of derisiveness that makes the room at large a bit colder. Next to Tony, Rhodey’s whole frame goes tense. The mechanic turns to look at him, and when their eyes meet, he shakes his head slowly. from the corner of his eye he sees the angry furrow of Rogers’s brow as he stares at them and then cuts his eyes to the archer.
by a few months, Rogers. And I’d rather get this over with now than keep dragging our bullshit along. Can’t have the leader of the team distracted when he’s supposed to lead. God knows how they’ll be able to blame me for that, too.”
“No, no, of course not, Mr. Stark,” the boy says in a rush. Rustling something in the back Tony does not even want to decipher. “We can just catch up tomorrow after school. Plus, I’m coming this weekend to start this new set—“Ned takes a deep breath and he sounds nervous when he comes back on the line. “I mean—I—if that’s still okay. I know Peter hadn’t really, um, asked for your permission or anything but—” Peter face plants, the back of his neck a bright red as he groans into his textbook. Tony’s children are actual human disasters.
is left unsaid, but Steve still flinches at the implication. He tells himself that getting into Tony’s network had been necessary to get his friends out of jail and really, if the man hadn’t wanted them to, Steve knows damn well not even Shuri could have helped without triggering some kind of alarm.
“Tony?” Coulson prompts after they’d composed themselves. Tony’s thumb tracing under Steve’s eyes to wipe away his tears.
“You said you saw what Ross and the whole lot of them wanted to do,” T’Challa says quietly. Tony gives himself a second to close his eyes and try to regroup before he turns back to the other man. When their eyes meet, Tony sees something akin do sympathy in the other man’s eyes, and he knows he doesn’t deserve it. “The progress we have made… it should have taken far longer than this. It should have been months, perhaps even years, before the tide of opinion turned against from Ross and his followers. That, Anthony, was all on you. You began to work on these revisions long before anyone knew of the threat they posed.”
, was together again. And sure, there were some cracks. And things weren’t really okay, not really, but the fact that they were all there was enough. After all the bullshit they’d been put through, they’d
” Tony gives a laugh that sounds downright ugly to his own ears. “Had I known the truth, I would have prepared accordingly.”
“Poetry helps,” Peter blurts out. Tony looks at him curiously and cocks his head. “MJ lets me see hers, sometimes. It’s really good. She—sometimes she helps me put all this,” Peter makes a motion to his chest and his brain and then pretends to make a ball out of it and Tony exhales in relief. Someone
“Enough!” Rhodey’s loud voice in his ear pulls Tony out of the reverie. They’re still trying to push their way towards the Bentley Happy is currently waiting in. God, he should have tried to find a back door or something. His temples pound with the horrible migraine he’s been having since the beginning of that day.
on some new synthetic drug shit. He got hooked, and for a couple years it had been the hardest thing to try to stop. It had taken Peter, barely three years old at the time, petting his hair one morning while Harley read him from one of his books for him to finally stop. They’d been crying, these awful hiccupping sounds, as they had been the first ones to find him when they had come into his room for some cuddles.
It seems like there’s someone watching out for it because it’s only been about two weeks after shit has hit the fan when Tasha shows up. Ross and Zemo are in custody, the Accords are on the process of being amended though both Tony and T’Challa are hopeful that they will be destroyed all together, and pardons are being written. He’s barely slept since the whole ordeal started and he knows his shaking is more than just nervousness, but he trudges on every day.
After his fifth time calling Bucky to ask if maybe he should cancel, give Tony a clean break, his friend shows up to his apartment and hits him on the arm as hard as he can. Steve bitches about it until he sees the look Bucky is giving him, and when his friend asks him, softly, to sit down because they need to talk, Steve goes without another word.
“Wanda is a kid, Cooper. She might be older than you, but compared to guys like your dad and me, she is still so young. And after what she’s gone through, she needed someone to protect her. To mentor her and love her like nobody had really loved her since her parents died. She lost her brother in the fight in Sokovia,” Cooper inhales sharply and Tony realizes that this is something Barton has never shared. He feels like he’s overstepping, but he’s already told him the truth. He reminds himself to mind his mouth from that point on. “Pietro… he was her everything, you know? She would have done anything to protect that idiot,” Tony chuckles lowly at the memory of that silver blur. “And then I came along, and made this…
“Well fuck you!” Tony screamed, shaking him again. “Fuck you, and your fucking team! That letter was a
did you put into his head?!” Steve, because this isn’t Cap and Tony can’t pretend like he’s not invested into this conversation. The blond’s eyes tear away from his and his nose flares as he glares at Wanda. She stares back at him with wide eyes. “What the
“It’s your house,” Harley says and puffs out his chest. Tony suppresses a groan, now he’s got the kid on a roll. “It’s your house, and your tech and your money and your food and your everything. It was your team and your lawyers and your
“what’s going on?” Steve asks Sam, knowing better than to speak to Bucky seeing as their relationship is so messy at the moment.
something. So when he’d gotten bigger, he’d taken to running in the early mornings before the rest of his unit was even up. He’d run drills with the other guys, sure, but he’d liked the lonely mornings best. After the ice, running felt even more important. Central Park or any other patch of green he could find made the tightness in his chest ease, if only a little bit. SHIELD HQ and the old facility had always felt like a godsend. Being able to just take off for a few hours to run through the trail set up for training had allowed him to just breathe.
4) I'm not comic book savvy but i do now that Ty Stone is generally depicted as "one of Tony's shitty exes" so he's gonna serve that purpose here.
“Well,” Steve finally managed after an awkward silence. “We can order in. You all heard, Coulson,” the name tasted bitter on his tongue. It wasn’t merely the surprise on finding that SHIELD had lied to them,
was Tony lucky to be able to do so, who carried Tony out of a party bridal style because Maya and Aldrich had left him to choke on his own puke after giving him some new shit he never should have tried. There was Bucky who took solo cups away from Tony when he happened to catch him at a party or guided him home when things got to be too much.
“Yeah, well, I’ve tried everything,” Clint says as he leans against the glass. He hadn’t noticed until the weight was gone, but his arm had gone numb at some point. He rotated his shoulder to try to get the feeling back into it. “He’s been like this for hours.”
So that’s what leads them here, on a cold late-November night in front of Tony’s apartment right before Christmas break. They had made plans, months ago, to spend the break together at Tony’s Manhattan condo as a trial run for… well, it’s all moot now.
“Mr. Stark?” again the same voice, though a little higher than before. The concern is clear, and Tony makes an effort to unstick his face from his worktable top. He realizes he’s in the same suit from the day before, though thankfully he’d shed the jacket and the tie somewhere along the way. The voice is starting to sound familiar, and though his brain is still sluggish, a part of him knows that he needs to get it together.
“Brooklyn,” Harley says sullenly when it is clear they’ll have to go through Steve to get wherever it is they want to go. The blond raises his eyebrow at the boy, but he refuses to meet his eyes. So, instead, he looks at Peter.
Sitting in the quin after getting Wanda and Vision out of danger feels a lot like dejavu. They’re all quiet and tense, Steve himself is scared out of his mind, and it feels so much like the hopeless atmosphere from their first defeat in the face of Ultron. Wanda sits with Vision sitting by her side, hands clasped together, as she presses a bandage against the wound in his side. Sam is piloting the jet, sitting stiff and tense in the pilot’s chair, and Nat stands still as a statue in front of Wanda and Vision.
—“Viz blurts out. Tony stares back at him with a small smirk. Seeing JARVIS shine through every once in a while puts a smile on his face every time.
The news come, for Steve at least, out of the blue. It’s been a few days since he’d had a talk with Tony at the cemetery and since then he’s felt a little out of sync. He’s made his very best effort to spend time with his time, sharing meals or training or any of the other things they used to do
“We had time,” Steve says, and tries his best to not make it sound like an accusation. He’s not stupid enough to say that they would have helped him work it out, because that is a lie, and he knows it. Every time Tony had started talking about that wormhole, they had all shut him down. He recalls his own uncharitable thoughts about that with shame. God, he had thought Tony was
“Some would call it stubborn,” Tony says and his eyes flick to the man on the other side of the glass partition. Blue eyes meet his, and then flit away.
“Yeah, we can try,” Tony says softly. Steve gives him a small smile, tiny and broken and infinitely filled with pain, but an attempt nonetheless. “Now, could you—could you go tell Rhodes that I’ll be awhile? He can take you back to the compound.”
Tony, who had shoved a handful of popcorn into his mouth, in haled a kernel the wrong way and started choking. Peter squawked and started patting his back with a guilty expression on his face. Tony tussled his hair to show him that he was fine before taking a big gulp of his drink. His hand instinctively went to his hip, where
“The things that she showed me. I—remember what I said? When I asked you if—when I told you why I made him?”
And it wasn’t as though the man had many places to call home, really. Malibu was destroyed, and Rhodes, they had been informed, was living in the compound with Vision. He was merely out for the weekend to visit with his parents before they could start training on Monday. Pepper was very obviously out of the question, and Steve doubted the kid in spandex had any place to offer him. So where could he possibly have gone? Where was the engineer calling home these days? The Compound was the only place he had left.
“I’m gonna go,” Clint murmurs against Laura’s hair as he hugs her. She looks up at him with apprehension in her eyes, and he sighs. He has a long way to go before that stops, he supposes. He gives her an encouraging smile nonetheless. “I have to talk to Coop.”
“No,” Tony says, sincerely for the first time in a long time. Rhodey gives him a surprised look, but doesn’t ask. “We’re a mess. We’ve been a mess for—this entire time, but we talked. We—it was hard, but I think we both needed it.”
He’s about to retract when he sees the giddy excitement on Peter’s face. It’s like someone told the kid all his projects would be funded for the rest of his life. Which, they are, but Tony hasn’t gotten around to telling him that quite yet. The kid nods his head, making him look like a bobble headed doll, and Tony finds himself smiling.
“So he didn’t have time to process,” Sam said and there was a hard note to his voice. “You took that from him, too.”
“Have they what?” Tony gets distracted by DUM-E, which is why he doesn’t notice the seriousness of the kid right away. The bot is barely approaching him, but he can smell the gasoline in the smoothie he’s been made. The darker part of his mind thinks that if he’d actually turned suicidal, it wouldn’t have been too hard to get rid of himself.
So although a part of him, the one that had always and would always love Maria with a fierce protectiveness, he mourned for them both when they passed.
He knew he’d made the right choice when her smile widened, and she immediately started on story after story on her man. Steve hoped Daniel Sousa knew how fucking lucky he was to have a girl like Peggy.
Peter’s wide eyes move from Tony’s face to the empty bottle of rum to his right, and the engineer winces. Christ, he’s just as bad as Howard ever was. Why he thought playing house with Peter was ever a good idea, he doesn’t know. Though, looking at the lost kid in front of him, he knows exactly why he offered the Parker kid help. He should have known he’d fuck it up somehow, though.
“Okay,” the other man says just as quietly. The brunet had expected questions, and he bites his tongue to prevent himself from saying anything. It’s still strange, this trust Steve is placing in him even on the little things, and he doesn’t want to ruin it beforehand. If it has to end, and the pessimistic part of Tony believes that it will, it sure as hell won’t be because of him.
“No, hiss,” Tony says to distract her from her evil punishment machinations. “My sanctuary is being invaded. Go away.” He dramatically hunches over his peach cobbler.
face on it at all times. There’s avoiding a certain part of Central Park, not stepping foot into Manhattan unless he has to, avoiding the Manhattan bridge at all costs… It feels as though he’s walking on eggshells half the time, but the other half… God. The rest of the time it feels as though he’s getting his first breath of air after being under water for too long.
It wasn’t until much later, lying in bed and still unable to sleep after all this time, that he let his mind voice what he had been worrying about for the last few years. He’d almost had the same thought before but had pushed it down viciously. The truth, however, was starting to solidify the more time passed. Sam had told him these things took time, that he just had to give himself space to get over it, to move on, to get to love someone again. Five years later, alone in a flat east of the Thames, Steve can’t help but ask himself: what if time doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do? What if nothing ever compares to what he had?
“Bullshit!” Steve snarls at him and Barton seems to be too stunned to come up with a reply. In fact, nobody thinks to even bring up the “language” joke or call him a hypocrite. Nobody has ever seen the Captain this worked up.
“Now, Captain Rogers,” Phil’s voice pulled him out his reverie. The others had filed out of the room to gather their things and it was only him, Wanda, Vision and Phil in the room. The agent was now standing at the table near Steve though he hadnt taken a seat. “The king felt it necessary that I speak to you about the expectations of you as an approved guest. First and foremost I feel I must remind you that you are
? The spy that betrayed me?! Tell me!” Tony cried, his whole frame shaking and with no more care for the tears rolling down his cheeks. “
Steve swallows thickly as he watches Tony stand there, surrounded by nothing but his machines, and looking close to breaking. He’s swaying a little bit where he stands, and the arm wrap around his middle and the one he brings to wipe his face are shaking. Steve tries to figure out what is going on and is growing more concerned by the minute as Tony just stands there, before the room around the genius flickers. Steve blinks, and the next thing he knows the room has changed.
,” and ah, there is the disgust. “Was back. Do you know what it’s like to have to talk to a spider dude off the ledge? The
because if he thinks long enough about what he did. If he puts himself in Tony’s position, if he starts thinking about what
The angry wind goes out of Hawkeye’s frame and he slumps back in his chair. Wanda immediately moves her hand to squeeze his under the table. If Tony wanted to be an asshole about the whole thing, he could insert a dirty joke there. Before, during the war, he might have done it, but the last few months have served to cure him of a lot of things. One of them being the compulsion to even attempt at a joke with people who hated his guts. Maybe he
“No, Anthony,” T’Challa’s voice is suddenly sharp. It’s enough to get Tony, Tasha and Rhodey to stop pouring over the documents and videos and speeches and to look at him. The king’s face is pure determination, and Tony is suddenly concerned. He thought they had done well enough to pacify everybody.
new doodads, or when he’s having a fun time with one of Tony’s bots… so what if it used to be about him, for a while, and now it’s not. At least Peter is happy, and Tony is not selfish enough to begrudge him that. He has, at least, not lowered to that level of Howard’s neglect yet. “I’ll eat it, I swear.”
“Give me until tomorrow,” Banner says, already walking out of the room. “He’s gonna need medical, and everything here is a mess. The least we can do is prepare.”
. I never meant to hurt you, that’s true, I thought I was protecting you. It’s a bold faced lie that I told myself, every day I saw you and stood by you and brought you lunch and enjoyed your company, every day I was lying to both of us. I told you that I trusted you, I thought I did, but the whole time I kept thinking back to that dossier I had of you at the beginning and I never gave you enough credit. Then Sokovia happened,” Steve shook his head.
Ross had wanted Tony’s head when the whole Vulture fiasco had happened. Had Tony not been going out of his mind trying to find his reckless son, and if that isn’t the Rogers kicking in full force he would eat the Mark L whole, he would have tried to fight Ross harder on that. As it was, he had the weight of the Accords Council, the UN, SI and Pepper and May to contend with trying to clean that up. Admittedly, he had lost his temper at a crucial moment with his son. Even now, over a year after it all happened, he feels guilt flare in his gut and threaten to choke him. He never should have left Peter so defenseless, he never should have lost his temper, he never should have been distracted… but more than that, he thinks in the quite hours of the night when both his children are asleep and he can let himself
“Hi,” he whispers down at her, voice shaky. “Hi, baby, I’m Peter. It’s nice to meet you,” he stretches one of his fingers to touch the baby’s hand and wiggles it up, down, up down in the pantomime of a handshake. Tony is so in love with them both at that moment; his dork of an eldest and his new baby girl. The baby looks up at her with her rich brown eyes, darker than Peter’s and brighter than Tony’s but just enough to make her as
, and if you fucking think that you’re the only who lost something that day, if you think that I’m going to apologize for being afraid, then you can shove your self-righteousness right up your ass!”
“The Chitauri,” Vision’s voice is calm as always. He is staring at Wanda as though seeing her for the first time, and Tony doesn’t want to think about what that means. He knows that a lot of J lives in the android, but he hadn’t thought that he’d remember those last few days between the HYDRA bunker and Ultron taking over.
shoes and flakes of crust clinging to his eyelashes. When the sun begins to set and the hanging lights begin to turn on, the baby begins to droop in his arms and he maneuvers around until he’s more comfortable. The kids had gone out to play soccer in the lawn while the adults chattered, and Tony can’t remember an evening where he’d felt this
“Sorry, was this seat taken?” the boy says with an attempt at a grin that falls flat. It wasn’t that bad of a smoke screen, but his lips tremble at the corners with the effort to keep the façade. He keeps blinking his eyes, and Tony knows that if he were to ask, the kid would blame it on his floppy brown hair.
Tony was already at the entranceway when he turned around, baby asleep on his chest, and his eyes met Wanda’s square on. He was fidgeting, and Steve could tell it immediately put him, and Sam and Tasha, on edge, but his gaze didn’t waver. Wanda’s face was set in the same mask she always had when dealing with the genius, but thankfully her fingers weren’t sparking red magic. Steve didn’t know what he would do if he saw that again, truth be told. And then, proving once again the type of man he was, Tony said, “Good luck,” in such a solemn way that hit them all like a punch. He gave her a nod and strode out of the room after T’Challa gave him a smile and a comforting squeeze to his shoulder.
Seeing those two go out together, seeing Cooper allow his father to wrap an arm around his shoulders and pull him close, had given him more hope than anything. It seemed as though, slowly but surely, they were pulling themselves back together again. Steve would do whatever he could, even if it was something as simple as baby sitting. He was the one that called Clint out of retirement, after all, and yet… yet here they were.
“You best keep quiet,” Sam says, deadly serious. “You’ve had your moral high horse, Clint, but now it’s time for you to listen. You keep throwing accusations around like someone forced you to do the things that you have done. Nobody has, but yet you decided you were going to cast Tony as the villain here. We’ve all heard your side, we are more than aware of what you believe, but now it’s time for you to listen to someone else for a change.”
Steve remembers the words, but now that he’s thinking back. Yes, there it is. The desperation. How had he not noticed that before? He merely nods at Tony, feels his heart breaking as the other man tries to compose himself, and stays silent.
“I’m not about to send you out there on your own. No, Peter,” Steve says with an authoritative tone. “Believe it or not, you two are still just kids. I know you go out on patrol, okay, and you’re doing incredibly well, all things considered. But you wouldn’t be going out as Spider-Man, right? It’d just be Peter Parker out there with a civilian. What would you do if someone tries to pick you off the street and Harley is with you? Not to mention the fact that if some asshole with a camera gets a shot of you and Tony, then what? How do you even begin to explain that? It’d be a PR nightmare, all three of us know that, and definitely the last thing Tony would need right now.” The boys still look like they want to tear him limb from limb, though that’s how they’ve looked for the past few days of the genius’s isolation, so he soldiers on. “Let me go bring him back. Once he’s safe in the tower, he’ll need you.” The boys look at each other, and steve knows they’re about to argue, so he tries his last card. “Please, just let me do this. I have to the right thing, just this once, I have to prove myself to him.”
“”Teve, ‘Teve, ‘Teve,” there was an insistent little hand tapping at his chest, and Steve grinned down at the baby on his chest. They’d practiced his colors in the morning, and then Steve had found the baby’s big legos and had helped him build his towers. Then had helped him tear it down the way
Tony can’t help it, he chuckles wholeheartedly at his son’s excitement. His heart fills with an adoration for this kid, this boy who had trusted Tony to care for him and love him unconditionally, and lowers the bundle a little. He uses a finger to carefully peel back the thin blanket she’s wrapped in, and angles her face towards Peter. The boy gasps, and Tony can see the tears in his eyes even though he’s smiling so wide. “Come on in, Petey. I think it’s time you met your sister.”
“Mom says that wasn’t all your fault,” Cooper says quietly, correctly hearing the hatred in his tone, and squeezes his hand quickly. Tony merely shrugs.
“Yeah,” Tony says quietly. “She was around a lot when I was very little. She’d say naughty words about Howard and rib Jarvis to make me smile.” He chuckles at the memory.
“Papapapapapa,” she babbles as she grabs hold of his cheeks in her clumsy little hands and tries to bring him closer. Steve gives her a little skimo kiss, out of habit, and she giggles and slaps his hands against his cheeks. “Papa ‘tee,” she says and this time it sounds more like a name. Steve can’t let himself hope it is what he hears.
Anyway please enjoy, and hopefully i'll get through the comments some time this century. As always, incredibly indebted to you all and your support.
As he was making his way out of the room he caught sight of Phil. The agent’s bland mask was still in place, but he was looking at the captain straight on. Steve wasn’t quite sure if he was correct, but he thought he saw something like approval in the other man’s eyes. He hoped he was right because right now he felt like he was left adrift. He didn’t know if he had done the right thing, but he knew it
They go to Sam for advice, and the very first thing his friend does is hug them both tightly. He especially gives a tight embrace to Tony who closes his eyes and bites his lip to keep from crying. Once they’ve calmed down, and Steve and Tony explain what has been going on, Sam refers them to a colleague of his by the name of Phil Coulson whom he promises will keep Tony’s name under wraps. He makes sure to tell them that if Coulson isn’t a good fit then he will help them find someone else.
, Tony. I know you designed the original specs from the army; I know you kept tweaking them after I joined Cap. I knew I owed you everything I had, the wings and Redwing and even the improvements at the VA where I used to work, and I didn’t value that.”
The day the strawberry blonde woman walks into the museum with Maria, he is convinced that miracles do exist. He doesn’t pay much attention to them, worried with his own tasks, and only looks up when he hears the voice from other side of the room. He turns and sees a man has joined the women, and something about the arch of his back and his hair has him narrowing his eyes on his figure. The man leans forward, shakes Maria’s hand and says something that makes her smirk, before the blonde pushes him lightly in what is clearly a friendly gesture. Steve looks back down at the tablet in his hand, but he can’t quite shake the feeling that something about the man feels familiar.
to even agree to see him, but they do. Steve spends the better part of that week trying not to give himself anxiety, but more often than not he ends up calling either of his friends for advice. Sam and Bucky are, understandably, speechless when he first tells them. They haven’t even hung up when they’re suddenly knocking on his door and forcing their way in. They’re happy for him, but he knows that they’re also apprehensive of what the outcome of all of this might be.
I don't know, is Tony completely OOC? Was i projecting hella hard? Probably, but fuck it lmao. I take complete authorship liberties right now.
“Thor,” Natasha starts softly, the way she used to talk to the Hulk when she was trying to do a lullaby. If anything, it bristles Thor even further. “We don’t know how old this transmission is. Even if we were absolutely certain that he’s still—”
Peter accepts comfort, this time and Tony sends a small prayer of thanks to the universe for it, easily this one time. He sobs, just once, and then throws his arms around Tony and almost knocks them both down. It’s a testament to the stress the poor kid has been carrying around lately that he’s beent this forthcoming with his pain. Tony holds him tight, one arm around his waist and the other hand on the back of his head; he rocks them, same soft motions he uses to lull Morgan to sleep, as he lets his son work through his pain.
“Clint, now is really not the time,” Laura says calmly. There’s barely control fury in her tone, and Tony marvels at her. The same way he’d marveled at Pepper. That tightly controlled storm that was tame just for a handful of people.
He talks about his struggle with substance abuse. With his recovery after Sunset had leaked a personal video of himself. He talks about his incredible support team, his closest friends whom he jokes he holds jealously. There are no pictures of Tony alone, only with the woman whom he assumes is Sunset and Steve viciously scrolls past them, but then…
“Why what, Tony?” Steve asks just as quietly. He’s ducking his head so he can meet Tony’s eyes, but the mechanic doesn’t have the strength to look at him and deal with his emotions at the same time. He fears they’ll have another repeat of Siberia if he does.
, Steve. He was—I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone look at you the way that boy did, you know? I was
? The voice in his head asked. He felt his hands curled into fists and heard his labored breathing, and for a moment he didn’t recognize who or where he was. He was already going down to the lab to pick a fight with Tony, the man he had barely managed to get back, maybe, over something he knew nothing about. Natasha and T’Challa had no reason to lie to him; they had been the ones to help him, the entire team, the most. Why would they lie about this? He know, intellectually, that there was no threat. Ross was gone, the Accords were revised, they had been pardoned, but… God. Just when they had begun to feel safe, this happened.
“That was totally not our fault,” Harley says and grins at Tony. The mechanic feels his chest expand with a level of comfort and love for the kid that he doesn’t quite feel ready to express. The way the kid looks at him, though, tells him that maybe he doesn’t have to. “How are you, really?”
After that, Tony was way too busy thinking about school and his new projects (after DUM-E came YOU then came Butterfingers, and currently there was something else he wasn’t quite sure how it would turn out,) and by the time he had noticed, middle school was over and he found himself being dragged by Rhodey and their new best friend Pepper off to the first high school party of their life. Though Tony had had trouble opening up to people, eighth grade had found him coming out of his shell a little more. He was still very distrustful of people, it had not only been Justin at the galas but then came Brock and Aldrich and Ivan and Sunset and well… once burned, as the saying goes. Though he still tried, even more so when Natasha and then the twins had been forced to attend the galas along with him. Though at the beginning Natasha had been distant and out right confrontational towards him, he thinks they had finally managed to find some common ground with each other.
“Oh, and Tony?” a new female voice says over the speaker. Steve doesn’t recognize her, but he’s alarmed at the way the genius’s face loses color. Harley’s eyes widen in alarm. “You boys and I will be having a talk about the latest donation to that college fund.”
, he said. You could have killed him, and yet you didn’t. He got to walk away on his own, while he left you behind. You didn’t follow them, Tony, that tells me enough. You
“Ultron was about control,” Rogers says, but he sounds confused. Like it’s a truth he’s held on to for a long time, but is no longer sure it’s actually right. Tony avoids his eyes so he doesn’t see the pain the accusation brings him. It’s a lot different thinking that the man you… cared for thought so little of you, than knowing those thoughts to actually be true.
“I don’t understand,” Tony says now, his brown eyes wide and his eyelashes casting shadows over his cheeks from the street lamp. Just a minute ago he had been smiling, his warm mittened hand holding tightly onto Steve’s, and yet here he is.
Tony allowed himself a second, with his eyes closed, to take it all in. He let himself bask in the fact that despite the heartbreak, his team, his
“You boys coming in or should we start without you?” Natasha materializes behind the king. Tony startles, but T’Challa merely inclines his head to motion Tony forward. The mechanic feels his phone buzzing in his pocket as he walks over to the door. He pulls it out and grins at the messages he’s received.
couple of the last year or so. Except… well, it gets ugly after that. There’s a transcript of the conversation, Tony’s words talking about dealing with abuse and gaslighting from Tiberius Stone
“Stop throwing the bot, Tony,” Rhodey says in an exasperated voice, back under the roadster with Harley sitting at his side. The boy, miraculously, gives Steve a grin from his position. He smiles back cautiously.
, Steve thinks with a jolt. Tony hadn’t felt safe in the facility he had created with the team he had helped found, and they had all let him walk away. Had joked with him on the phone about how he still wasn’t a team player. Had let Wanda—“Dear God, what did we do to you,” Steve says out loud.
“You can mention him, you know,” Tony says and he feels a flare of irritation in his chest. It feels as though as comfortable as he can get with Steve, the other man is always managing to pull that stability from him. the rational part of him feels that Steve is justified in how weary he is of bringing his friend up in conversation with Tony, but the emotional part that he will insist to his death he doesn’t possess, can’t get over the betrayal. Every time he hears the other man’s name all he can see is metal fingers wrapped around his Mama’s neck and the words
“So how did she get there, Tony?” Steve says slowly. He’s beginning to see the horrible truth of it, and he hates Ross more than anything at that moment. He hates the man for every goddamn thing he’s done. For what the truth will most likely do to the genius. “Tony, she had no badge, no clearance, no checks, nothing. How could she have found you backstage? You were alone, yes?” At Tony’s silent nod, Steve mimics him and continues softly. “She wouldn’t have found you without help.”
“It means Thor and Stormbreaker can actually go get him. The nanos strengthened… everything about him. His bones, his neural and cardiovascular system… his body is in perfect shape. Not only that, but if he were to be injured the nanos would take care to repair whatever damage might be done until he could get proper medical attention. Even if, unlikely as though it might be, his body couldn’t take the strain all that would happen is that he would shut down until someone administered proper medical care. Which,” Banner says with a determined expression. “is what I’m here for.”
“What he had to,” Rhodes says with an edge to his voice. When Steve meets his eyes, there is a challenge there.
briefed on what will be needed to be done. Not to mention the fact that—“his eyes flit briefly to Tony and the man in question gives an almost imperceptible shake of his head, and the king sighs. “A bit of Doctor Banner’s research may be helpful make his recovery faster and safer.”
“Very well,” the king said now addressing the occupants of the room. Tasha gave a solid kick to Barton’s stool that had him springing up into a seated position at once. He had drool on his cheek and he wiped at it as he stared blearily around the room. Sam, rolling his eyes, pushed a plate with toast and some eggs his ways and the archer began eating without even questioning what was going on. Everett Ross looked on with a raised eyebrow, and Phil smiled indulgently at his former charge. “I am sure you are all aware of your roles for the proceedings today. Those of you who are witnessing on behalf of Ms. Maximoff have already been briefed on what is expected of you. This is just some last minute reminders that you must all be on your best behavior today. The prosecution will try to get a rise out of you, and they will bring up some painful events in your collective past, however, it is important that you maintain a leveled head.”
about being handed things and she’s worked to not make him uncomfortable since they met four years ago. She used to hand the paperwork to someone else, someone willing to take his weight from him, but that’s gone now so they’ve made do.
“You’re smaller than the last time I saw you. I wouldn’t hold my breath, Benjamin Button,” Tony says and ruffles his hair.
as Tony has been feeling the past few months and he wants to. He wants to believe that there is away Steve means what he’s saying. That there’s a way, in this universe, where Howard, and Obie and Ty were
Tony can feel the embarrassed rush of blood to his ears, and he determinedly avoids eye contact with everyone who isn’t Cassie. Cooper giggles next to him, and Tony turns to give him an unimpressed glare. The little shit only gives him a grin back, and Tony huffs. “Well, Tasha and the others got your dad here a few days ago, but you couldn’t come by yet since you were in school. So once you were on holiday, we called up Laura and asked her to bring you here so you all could see your dads.”
Steve clenches his fists on the seat, and hears the upholstery tear at the force of it. He closes his eyes and focuses on his breathing. Reminds himself to keep in the here and now. Reminds himself that there is nothing he can do to go back in time and beat the people who hurt his friend to a pulp. He doesn’t know why Rhodes is telling him this, but he’s glad nonetheless. It explains so much of how Tony reacted to the team, how weary of them he was at the beginning, and his chest hurts with the realization that he’d been taught to be weary of people from such an early age. And this isn’t even counting everything that Howard may have done, which has been heavily implied by Rhodes and Tony and sometimes even Natasha.
It had been ten days now since he’d last seen Tony, and he’d begun to worry. The next day, Peter and Harley walked into the communal kitchen for breakfast but didn’t stay. They’d taken one look at Clint, and swore under their breath collectively, and even FRIDAY’s chirp of
Tony feels Peter’s head turn into his shoulder, the hot sting of tears on his skin, but he forces himself to keep going. Peter holds tighter onto him.
However much he tries to deny it, though, Tony can’t lie to himself as much as he would like. Harley has definitely worked his magic in those scarce minutes. He’s a bit more settled as he makes his way to the conference room. He balls his shaking hands and shoves them in his pockets. He can’t deny that he’s apprehensive, he refuses to call it
When Steve had finally crawled out of the Bentley after his talk with Rhodes, he’d been in too bad of a headspace to do anything but beat it down to his room with his metaphorical tail tucked between his legs. In hindsight, he’s grateful that Rhodes had given a bit of Tony’s back story to him. That, perhaps, the lieutenant colonel had decided that despite his screw ups, Steve was worthy of knowing his friend. Hell, his brother. At the moment, though, he’d honest to God wished that Rhodes had spent however long that talk lasted threatening bodily harm rather than outlining in specific detail just how much Steve had misjudged the mechanic.
disappointed until her own mind betrayed her. Tony would continue to fall, until Iron Man became him and he got that fateful call from a distant Sharon telling him Aunt Peggy was fading. Tony would visit, constantly at first and then more sparsely as a certain super soldier was reawakened and visited his old lover.
“Like hell,” Steve’s angry voice snapped him back to the present, and then there were hands on his shoulders. The blond’s chest was heaving with each breath he took, and his eyes had that steely look about them Tony had seen in the bunker. This was the look of the Brooklyn kid that taunted, with a cocky smirk on his bleeding lips, that
. This is the most unacceptable thing he can think about. From the corner of his eye he can see Steve spring to his feet in alert, too, ready to figure out what could cause a reaction out of the genius when nobody else can.
The other man speeds up to meet Laura halfway, but before taking the baby, his eyes lock on Clint’s and he stops dead on his feet. The archer sees the dread in the other man’s eyes as he takes a step back, and then the distress when Nate gets even more upset. The archer hates himself a little, for hurting his son and putting that look on Stark’s face.
“I have no business meddling in that,” Tony said, and his voice was tight. He wasn’t meeting Steve’s gaze, and the soldier blew out a breath.
kid, reached out with trembling fingers and grasped his. Because there was his kid telling him he was going to be okay, and Tony would burn every star in the sky to make that true for him.
,” his voice sounds broken. “You’re afraid of me. And it’s not just—you’re not afraid of Cap, you’re afraid of
“We pushed you,” Steve says after a moment. One of his hands has Tony’s fingers pressed against his chest, and he’s taking in lungfuls of air that the genius finds himself mimicking. Already, he can feel the panic subsiding. He just feels tired now. “I—Tony, I thought—In Leipzig, I thought you’d come for war,” he starts making shushing noises again when Tony breaks out on a litany of
“Why are you—he’s—how have—“Before Barton can keep stabbing his already faulty heart, Tony focuses on the baby in his arms.
,” he takes a big breath and tries to stop the trembling in his fingers. His throat feels tight, but he swallows past the lump. “
“She said I’d murdered her child, okay?” Tony finally tears himself away and wraps his arms around his middle. “She told me her kid was dead, and that she blamed me. We’re the Avengers, right? We are supposed to avenge people; that’s what I said to Loki. But what the hell good does it do to Avenge someone when they’re
Tony hasn’t had many choices his whole life. All his early years, Howard had decided. Mama had decided when he got to socialize, and what party to attend, and which people to befriend. Losing them both, and then Obie had taken over. Had given Tony the illusion that he was finally making his own choices, whether they were making some brand new weapon or stumbling out of the Ritz in his underwear and a party hat, but that was all it was. A mirage of choices. Then, the reactor that had saved his life and he hadn’t chosen to keep. If he’s been honest with himself, the only thing that he was ever truly chosen, consciously and wholeheartedly, has been Iron Man.
“Yeah, and I’m totally not failing geography,” Harley says with just as much snark. Tony narrows his eyes.
“Engagement?” he croaks out, turning back to his friends. Sam motions something over Steve’s shoulder, and when he turns around a ball game has replaced the image of Tony. Bucky is hunched over his phone, the frown between his eyesbrows creasing his forehead in worry as he scrolls up and down on something.
Next time he was out on a mission, he’d come back to find his key card reader off his door and an honest to God wooden door on its place. It was dark cherry wood, and there was a brass key hanging from the knob and a knocker and peephole at eye level with Steve. He’d stood there, mouth agape as Natasha continued to her room with a snort, and then he’d laughed. He’d laughed, and
what she wants to tell him. He thinks it looks mostly like a warning, but he doesn’t understand about what.
“I’d think you’re lying if it weren’t for the fact that I know how awful getting your mouth washed out with soap actually is,” Tony says with a small smile. He doesn’t know why he feels the need to share with the other man now, but he decides to take that small leap of faith. His resolve to be stoic and cold towards the blond has already crumbled, didn’t even really last anyway, but now… well, most of their problems stemmed from how utter shit they are at talking to each other so maybe it’s time that they learn to actually
Rhodes spits the name, “ with his arm wrapped around his shoulders and he had—he had this wad of cash on one hand and fucking cup of
Tony just hums, the grief still a little too close in his heart despite how long it has been since he’s lost them. He blinks up at the sky, that distrustful part of him still too weary to show much around Steve, especially too afraid of letting the man see him this vulnerable. “Losing Mama was,” Tony shakes his head and bites his lip bloody. Steve’s hands tear at the dirt under his palms. “I never thought anything would hurt as much as that did. I know you probably think I’m an asshole for saying it, but losing Howard didn’t really change much in my life; I suppose I was sad,” he says a little louder when Steve opens his mouth as if to speak, a distressed look on his face. “But most of all I
But he knows that Tony isn’t okay. They don’t have sex until their fourth month of trying, and though Steve has never lent any credence to the gossips about promniscuity, he remembers how good they were together. He remembers Tony’s body, the ways it reacted to his touch, and he can’t help but miss him. He doesn’t want to push him, and he doesn’t think he has a right to ask, so he lets Tony set the pace. Gives him his time and hopes Tony isn’t regretting them.
After what feels like forever, Tony’s arm snakes around his waist. Steve presses kisses into his hair and wishes he didn’t feel so useless.
So after talking Natasha into dropping the metaphorical gun, he’d very quietly and seriously said, “Tasha, what was the plan if Stark didn’t manage to convince Cap?”
“Phil, please,” Steve said raising a hand to stall the other man’s words. He felt his cheeks flush in embarrassment but he straightened his spine and looked at the agent head on. “While I appreciate the reminder, I have to say that it won’t be necessary,” he saw the way the other man raised a sardonic eyebrow at him and opened his mouth. “I spoke with Tony last night. I won’t be attending.”
“Of course not, but we don’t believe they will. This has been a long time coming. Her actions have already been discussed, at length,” T’Challa said and his dark, piercing gaze didn’t waver from Steve. “It’s just a matter of judging her mental state. Whether or not she’s truly capable of controlling her powers or not. They have asked others to present themselves, as well.”
“That’s more than enough out of you,” Cap brings a fist down on the table and the thing shudders even with the reinforcements Tony specified on every piece of furniture in the compound. They had the Hulk, all right, precautions seemed necessary. He’s not
The memory hit him square between the eyes like a physical blow, and he took a step back. What in the actual hell was wrong with him? Would. He really go back on a
“I survived it,” Bruce tells him as he keeps scrolling through his tablet. His voice sounds hopeful, now, and Steve’s heart clenches. He still hasn’t said a word.
and I didn’t want to feel like that ever again. I love you; I love you so much and not being able to help you hurts,” Steve turns, tears in his eyes, to look at Tony.
. Long before the accords, long before Siberia, long before Ross, Tony. I was supposed to be your friend and I let you down, and if there’s anything that these past months has taught me—“the sob finally breaks free of the captain’s throat. “Tony, if there’s anything I’ve learned in these past few months is that I don’t know who I am if I don’t have you there to be my foil. You—you mean so much to me. I was so stupid for not realizing it sooner, and I failed you. And you were right,” another shake and Tony feels like he’s floating. His brain isn’t connecting the words. It’s—he must have blacked out in the workshop again. There’s no way that this is
“They want to speak to her directly,” Vision said and Wanda whipped her head around to look up at him. She let his hand go, and he stepped back resignedly. She pushed back from her chair and wrapped her arms around herself. “Her pardon has been the hardest to negotiate, and the lawyers believe that it would be best for her to be present when her case is being discussed. As a show of good faith.”
Tony dropped his gaze from the Captain and made his way to the door. There was a weird sense of peace inside him despite the fact that every breath felt like a struggle. This whole time he’d been tossing and turning wondering what he could have possibly done to deserve the contempt the others had shown him. He had turned things over and over in his head, in the BARF, trying to change his actions to get a better reaction. He’d sat entire nights nursing his scotch and shooting theories at an increasingly worried FRIDAY about what he could have possibly done to keep the team, the people he’d considered his
He’d fade into the background of her life; her old godson or her old friend visiting her every once in a while when his company allowed him too. She’d mock scold him for the bags under his eyes and the fidgeting of his fingers. She’d tell him about her missions and her old home and always,
Natasha shared a look with Vision, and Steve caught the slight shake of the head the android gave her. Steve got it, in that moment, with perfect clarity. There was only one person who could really exonerate her, at this point, and it had nothing to do with what was out in the public. They had already used him as a spokesperson, after all, he was the front man on the whole Accords circus. It had been his face on the front of tabloids and newscasts, calling for pardons, even if perhaps he wasn’t the one directly in negotiations with the UN. It made sense, really.
“You wanted to protect us,” a voice says from behind him. They both turn around to see Peter and Harley carrying four plates of dessert between them. Harley sits on the other side of tony while Peter takes a seat across form them. “We figured you’d be here and we didn’t want you two to miss dessert,” he says at Tony’s questioning look.
“What the fuck?” Barton’s incredulous, though not angry not exactly, voice pulls him out of the moment. He notices that all the room’s occupants are staring at him then, and he feels heat crawl up his neck. He’s about to hand the baby back to his mother, clearly the baby’s dad has some disagreement with her choices, but then Laura is giving him a determined stare.
will take you back no matter how many times you stab him in the back?!” Tony’s voice was climbing in time with his mounting indignation.
Steve about all the people he’s lost. The blond knows that nobody on the team has really thought about it, how isolated Tony has really been his whole life or the fact that he lost so much in such a short amount of time. Sometimes Steve thinks that the reason Tony is expressing himself so much lately is because it’s finally catching up to him; it’s as though he’s reached a threshold where he
a part of him to know that he didn’t have that right. Of the bridges he had burned in his stupid self-righteous quest, that’s the one that hurt the most to lose. He didn’t have the right to ask after Tony, didn’t have the right to demand answers or even offer comfort. Not at the moment, at the very least, because while Tony might have accepted him back in a way everyone knew that the genius hadn’t forgiven him. Nobody, not even Steve, had expected him to even give him as much of a reprieve as he already had. Vision might be trying to keep Tony from getting any more hurt by Steve, but the blond was also thankful that he had stopped him at that moment. The mechanic wasn’t someone who opened up easily for anyone; much less the man who had, both physically and metaphorically speaking, shattered his heart.
“I’m sorry,” the words sounded like they were punched out of him. “God, Tony, I don’t have words for what I did. I thought I was protecting Bucky, I thought I was protecting
They spend the rest of the day at the cemetery exchanging stories about their mothers. The mechanic isn’t particularly inclined to talk about his father, but talking about his Mama makes the tight knot in his chest loosen a little bit. Steve has plenty to say about Sarah Rogers and her no-nonsense policies. After a couple of hours, Tony’s holding his sides from how much he is laughing at Steve’s latest story about his mother. Apparently, tiny Stevie Rogers had had quite a mouth on him when he got riled up. Mrs. Rogers had refused to
“What the hell is that supposed to mean?” Clint asks in a low voice. The anger makes a short return in his chest.
When he opens his mouth as if to say something, Tony finishes his thought, “it shouldn’t have been me.”
“Colonel Rhodes called me,” he says quietly. His eyes move around the room, and when they land on DUM-E, his whole face lights up. Tony watches him move towards the bot before seemingly remembering where he is, and most importantly who he’s with. He glances back guiltily at Tony. “He said maybe I should come for a visit.”
to be his friend just because and then one day he shows up in the middle of the fucking night soaking wet with a busted up face and shivering like crazy. And the only thing he could tell me was
Suddenly there’s hands on his face, and for a wildly horrible second, he claws at them. He desperately tears at the hands holding him, and his gaze is a haze of bloody red and spots of black, before the sound of Steve’s gentle
“Let it go,” Sam snapped. The tone of voice made both of them recoil, and the pilot dropped Steve’s arm. They were both silent for a moment before Sam cleared his throat. “Just once, Steve. Let it drop.” There was nothing the blond could say to that and they both knew it. Another beat of silence passed while Sam searched his face for an objection, but there was nothing he could say. “Look, I know you want to go in guns blazing and demand answers. Ask if Tony’s said something to Barton, but—“
“Fine,” Rhodey said and Steve felt his face fall in disappointment. He nodded, resigning himself to the silence, before he heard the colonel sigh next to him. “Braces hurt like a bitch this morning,” Rhodes continued after a pause and Steve turned back to him, hoping his eagerness wasn’t too obvious, but not really giving a damn if it was. This… Rhodes didn’t talk about his paralysis or his braces or his pain to
“I got a degree in mechanical engineering, and half my teaching credential paid for,” Harley says and then thanks his mom when she places a plate of food.
he was made privy to them; he wants to think it’s because Tony trusts him now at least that much, but a part of him thinks it’s got nothing to do with trust. Maybe it’s because the mechanic thinks he should know a bit about the remarkable woman who was taken away from him by Steve’s best friend. The thought hurts because the blond doesn’t need Tony to do that. He doesn’t need Tony to tell him who Maria was for him to feel like utter shit about what he’s done, and especially when it obviously hurts the mechanic the way it does. Steve has never really seen cry before; even in Siberia he’d kept a tight lid on his emotions. Had refused to let Steve and Bucky see the pain the surveillance video caused him.
means. Hears Bucky give a reply, but can’t for the life of him know what he says, because suddenly the only thing he can see are those words.
“I’ll talk to Pepper. She’ll get you there, I’m sure. For now, I think it’d be best if you went home, yes? Break the news?” Her smile spreads fully on her face, and Tony can feels his lips doing the same. It’s finally sinking in, that this is real, it’s true. This is actually happening, and even thoug he knows that the anger, and despair and bitterness will hit him later, for now all he feels is elation.
“The idiot that thought this was a good idea?” Tony says and scowls when Baby Bart gnaws a bit at his cheek and Sam laughs.
, thought it was a good idea to… what? Lump me in with my father? The man that beat me and abused me when he paid attention to me, or ignored me like I was scum on his shoe when he didn’t? Is that when I had a choice to say anything? Or maybe it was in that bunker? When I had the living hell beat out of me? OR what about when you all came back? When the first thing you did when we saw each other was punch me in face? Tell me when, Barton!”
Tony’s bitter mind chanted. A sob built up in his throat. How many ways can one be possibly broken before there’s nothing left? Hearing the confirmation of his worst fears is managing to incinerate him.
whom I had to watch struggle to take a simple step every day? The man I had to be strong for because you took
“And look where it got them!” Tony bursts out. His chest is heaving and there’s sweat running down his back. “They were forced away from their homes, separated from their loved ones; everything they had built was torn to shreds because of what I did. Yes, I saw what Ross was trying to do. I thought I could do some good. I thought I could work things from within; changed the course they were creating so that not only would we continue doing what we could to save this chunk of rock, but I could continue keeping them protected. God, I should have known. Every time I try to do something that will keep them safe, I end up putting their lives at risk. This… T’Challa,
Instead, Tony leads Steve to the gravesite next to Howard’s. It’s a small monument, with beautifully stylized words carved into its headstone. Tony had, personally, spent
“Spaceships,” he whispers, eyes stuck to the screen. “Sam, turn it up!” he barks at his friend, and for once there is no commentary from the other man as he does as he’s told.
“I know you do, Tony,” the Captain says in tone that is much softer than what Tony was expecting. He half thought they were going to start a screaming match right then and there. That’s how it had always gone before, anyway. “And if you’re busy then we could have this discussion later. I don’t want to inconvenience you—“
“After what we went through for not doing the same you can’t expect us to believe it’d be that simple,” Rogers says. He sounds way out of his depth, and Tony is vindictively glad for it. It isn’t fair that it’s just him feeling like he’s swimming against the current.
“You’re damn right, I do.” Tony answers before Nebula can, walking into what he assumes is the cockpit. Nebula turns with an expressionless face, but her eyes scan him from head to toe. He nods at her, and she seems to find him hale enough to give a tiny nod back. He wants to thank her, wants to tell her how fucking grateful he is that she didn’t leave him, wants to tell her so many things, but now is not the time.
He can’t even muster the energy to pretend offense that, like Sam, that seems to be the first image of him when it comes to interacting with Tony.
Also, I've noticed a lot of comments from you guys (I'm trying to respond as best I can but yeah, still depressed and still shitty work so it's slow coming,) apologizing for not having English as your first language, and guys... my dudes, lights of my life, English is not my first language either LOL so don't you worry. I read, re-read, 10000000x read, love, and appreciate every single one of your comments. Thank you for your invaluable support.
let that happen. I was supposed to be doing the right thing, and I put my teammates in a maximum security prison. I may not agree with Barton on most things, but…” he trailed off with a shrug. Steve didn’t say anything, but he leaned down to give the man another chaste kiss.
After all of that, Stark had just stood there with an inscrutable expression on his face, his arms crossed across his chest, and standing at parade rest. Similarly to how Rhodes stood these days around him; that defensive curve to his shoulders. The tinted glasses covering his eyes. Tony had just looked at him until Clint was uncomfortable enough to snap with, “What? You’re not gonna say anything now? You had plenty to say before!”
“Ti amo, bambino, but I need you to stay safe,” and before Peter can continue his protestations, he tells his AI to disengage the kid’s parachute and send him home. When he gets the confirmation, he sags against the nearest wall and forces his mind to recede its panic.
“Sometimes you’re not,” Peter said quietly, head burrowing further into the space between Tony’s neck and his shoulder. Tony let his head fall back onto the back of the couch, blinking back tears. God. Why did this never get easier. “Sometimes, when you think no one is looking, you get this… you look sad. You look sad
“I just want to make sure--” Steve had muttered. He’d given one feeble attempt to yank his arm away, but he didn’t want to hurt his friend. Not one more.
“You may do as you wish in that matter, but that is not what I meant. The Accords, the pardons, all of it… it should be you who tells them,” Tony opens his mouth to immediately argue against that assessment. Nothing, and he means
Tiny fingers grabbing his nose snap him out of the reverie he’s managed to drown himself in, and he’s grateful. He’s quite sure FRIDAY is too since she’d asked him to, please, stop destroying the reinforced bags since she couldn’t replenish them that quickly as she was occupied with overseeing other projects. His cheeks had heated up at the exasperated tone of her voice, but he had apologized nonetheless. His ma hadn’t raised no disrespectful fella, after all.
The press is juvenile and downright cruel when reporting about it. Certain websites make a game out of it; trying to guess why Tony isn’t in public anymore. Steve tends to only half-listen, now, only keeping tabs on when Tony is and isn’t in the public eye. He hates hearing the taunts and the insults; the speculation of what kind of substance Tony is taking now to numb the pain. The cruel and careless way his suicide attempts are reported. The fake sympathy and belated words of support. The stoic way with which Stane goes in front of the press, looking more careless and irritated with each conference, and his subtle jabs about his own godson.
“I know,” Rogers says and there’s a hint of pain in his eyes. Tony doesn’t know who it’s directed at. “The whole point of this meeting is so that we can talk and at least try to patch this whole mess. The whole point of this is for us to try to get back to what we had.”
For a long moment, they merely stared at each other. The other man’s eyes were stormy as they looked into Tony’s eyes. The mechanic realized with a start that the other man was younger than him, though the creases near his eyes spoke of the same stress Tony felt. A pang of sympathy hit Tony as he remembered the file he had compiled of the other man when Ste-
Rhodes is standing at parade rest in front of the Bentley when Steve gets to the main road. Hogan is standing next to him, and he appears to be having a heated discussion with the Colonel. Rhodes is nodding, his eyes hidden behind a pair of aviators, and his expression grim. Hogan is the first who spots him, and even though he’s wearing sunglasses as well, Steve can tell he’s scanning the area for his boss. His mouth tightens and he takes a step in the blond’s direction, but Rhodes stops him though he doesn’t take his eyes off Steve. He swallows the flash of irritation at their reactions, God, it’s not like he’d hurt Tony. Especially in a place that feels so sacred.
“Tony, would you mind taking the kids out to the rec room you built them?” Laura says sweetly to him. She’s holding Nate out, now, and the mechanic has no choice but to take the squirming baby. He notices the woman’s choice of words and the impact they have on her husband.
, Steve realizes with a jolt. He hadn’t bothered to think about Tony’s feelings about losing JARVIS. “I wanted him to be a sort of extension of JARVIS. The problem wasn’t that I wanted to create an AI, I’d done that before, but I—I got desperate, and I fucked around with
. I kept secrets from,” Tony screwed up his face as the pain flared in his chest. “Shh, shh, listen. I kept things from you and I was
Steve wants to curl himself up, and disappear into the seat. He forgets, sometimes, how young Tony had been. He forgets the weight of everything that felt on his fragile shoulders when he lost his parents. He forgets that Tony knows his same kind of grief.
. “Or, well, Pym was wrong. I don’t know what beef he had with your dad, but he clearly didn’t know shit about you. Mr. Stark can definitely be trusted.”
“Look, Tony, I know how you feel about him, but that?” he points to the soldier, who’s just looking at the ground and shaking his head. “That looked an awful lot like—“he’s about to start shouting again and Tony wraps his hands around the colonel’s biceps.
Tony rears back and shakes his head to dislodge the vision. God, he was a failure. Now Harley looked even more stressed out than before. He was such a piece of shit sometimes. “Fine. I’m fine, Har. Just… minor step back, you know how it is.”
“He blamed Howard, you know,” Rhodes says after a while. “He must have been drunk, he was probably yelling at mom, he was distracted, he was going too fast—he had all these theories of what could have been. When he wasn’t blaming some random unknown driver, he blamed his dad. Can you imagine what that must have been like? For him to think that his own father had taken
Turns out, it’s fucking aliens again. Steve hadn’t even finished asking the question when Sam was already back on the pilot’s chair punching in coordinates. Steve sends a silent prayer of thanks to whatever deity gifted him with such a good friend who knows exactly where his thought process is going. Steve doesn’t have to fight and rationalize with Sam because the man understands what he needs. It’s a nice change to the constant struggle it has been for the past two years to just try to get his point across.
After Barton had come back to the green house, alone, everyone had had a minor panic. Not because they thought the archer would harm Tony in any way despite the punch he’d thrown at him the first day they were back, but about the emotional state of the wayward genius. The blond agent hadn’t looked great, either, but after the past months of uncalled for hostility, nobody seemed too eager to forgive and forget. He’d made his way to baby Nate as soon as he’d come in, despite the glare Laura had thrown at him, and all but collapsed into the seat next to Wanda. The young witch had immediately tried to ask what had happened, her tone not settling well with the others, but the archer had refused to speak. Everyone else had dispersed quickly after that; Rhodes, Peter and Harley hadn’t even waited for Barton to reach the table before they were bolting for the main building.
“It can’t wait until tomorrow?” the man asked and there was a quiet note of warning in his voice. Steve ignored it.
Steve reared back at the venom in his voice, venom he hadn’t heard from the other man since the first days of Clint’s deliberate cruelty, and again felt as though he was missing something. That feeling, more than anything, is what kept him from starting a screaming match. That, and the guilt that always came from realizing that Tony was right. He opened his mouth to say something, but Tony looked up and he found his heart twisting at the look on the other man’s face. At the tiredness and the disappointment there.
And when they went home, on the last day of camp as Tony waited for Jawwis to come pick him up because he knew his dad would forget, Peter gave Tony a little pendant and his very first kiss. And yeah, Rhodey and Pepper said it didn’t count, but Bruce was the smartest of them all and he said that cheek kisses still counted so
“Hey,” he says again, this time to the Colonel, as he takes a seat while Tony bustles around the counter with his cereal and coffee. “How ya feeling?”
“No,” Vision says with a sigh. “I—the transponder Mr. Stark gave me must still be at the hotel. I turned it off,” he throws a quick glance at Wanda but she’s doing a damn good job of pretending to dress Vision’s wound. The coil of resentment gets a little loose, and Steve resolutely tightens it back up. “And I promised him I would not try to communicate by any other—unconventional means. I have yet to try it, but I don’t believe I would be able to even if I did. I’m sure it wouldn’t be outside the realm of possibility that he might have—ah,” he looks up with something like regret. “Taken measures against the possibility.”
Tony knows he can never tell Peter. It would hurt the kid too much to know how far and how deep Tony fell into that hole when he came back. How home was nothing, now, a mirage that he was never worthy of having. All Peter knows, now, is that Tony decided that he wanted to move forward. That he wanted to start again now that everything he knew was shattered into pieces at his feet. Peter doesn’t need to know how close he came to recreating those last two lines.
“I asked him to,” Tony says and he distracts himself with blowing raspberries on Baby Bart’s cheek just to hear him giggle. “You saw the others, Sam,” he says before the pilot can object. “They hated me, that first day. If they’d known I had a hand on that they would never had accepted. The only reason they signed is because it was T’Challa who presented the accords and not me. They would have thought I was… manipulating them, somehow. You didn’t choose Cap because you knew him longer, Sam. You chose him because he was
“Tones,” Rhodey’s voice comes from behind the team. He’s standing at parade rest, something he hasn’t done around these people in a long time, but the tension in his frame is visible. As is the angry glare he gives the room at large. “I think it’s time for us to go. Mom is on the phone.”
“The newly revised Sokovia Accords under whose protection you now are. This, right here,” T’Challa says as he quickly goes through the pages on it. “Is the whole reason you are back home. Some provisions stay the same, the punishments and the necessity of communication with every sovereign country you enter, but a lot of it has been changed. Things like Ross’s involvement, as well as people like him. The necessity of the Raft remains, but the process to get there is much more complicated now. We have given other enhanced individuals—“
“You’re a kid, Harley. I know you two think you gotta take care of me or whatever, but you both have lives of your own. You were doing your robotics thing, and trying to bring those grades up don’t think I don’t know about your backed up reading assignments, and doing soccer besides. I was handling it. I
I have agonized over this goddamn chapter for so long, y'all. It's a bit different from like everything else, but it seemed right. I feel like both of us healed a little bit by the end so... hopefully you will like it as well :) Things are looking up now, everyone.
“Yeah, I made the mistake of calling this scrap of metal I was working on a useless piece of shit. I must have been, what, six? And then Jarvis walked in with this severely disappointed frown on his face. I don’t think I’ve run as fast as I did that day. I wasn’t fast enough,” Tony says, throwing the blond a grin. “He was one tall gentleman, and he easily grabbed me and scooped me up and took me to the kitchen. The worst part was that Ana was there, so I was forced to hear as he recounted my little tantrum and then he handed me over. Ana was
“I’m surprised Stark lets anyone down there,” Wanda’s accented voice cuts in. Steve winces. He doesn’t know why her words always sound so hostile when she speaks of the mechanic. He doesn’t know if he’s just making it up in his head now, after everything, or if it had always been like this. He tries to stifle the unease that thought brings up.
In a blink, he has a spectator’s view of that god forsaken bunker in Siberia. And there are two Tony’s in the room. One in jeans and a ratty shirt, skinnier and paler than he remembers, and the other fully suited in the Iron Man armor and with bruises marring his face. One glaring purple-black ringing one of his big, brown eyes.
“Tony, you are—you’ve been the best friend I’ve had since… well, maybe ever,” Steve whispers like it’s some frail truth he doesn’t want to shatter. Doesn’t want to soil with the weight of their mistakes.
“Sam,” Nat reprimands quietly but her mouth is twisted in an unhappy curve and Steve’s hands are tight fists as he tries to reign in his temper. Christ, it has been long enough. He would have thought Wanda would grow out of the resentment, though he supooses it should have been obvious that she was vehemently against it after the comments she’s made since Clint “liberated her” from the compound.
, is what he said, if only to hear his friend laugh. Somehow, he’d started talking about doorknobs of all things.
helping, Rhodey,” Tony’s voice had sounded so earnest. As though it was something he was trying desperately to believe himself. “I just—I know I can get it to work. I made the damned thing. I can fix—“
“They point, Tony,” is said incredulously. “Is that you’re a wonderful, kind man who did everything he could to keep his family safe.
“You don’t know that,” Peter whispers into his shirt. “You don’t know that. Every time I feel like I might be getting better I just remember Aunt May, you know? The Vulture’s men… they just—so easy. She was gone, just like that. And the thought—just thinking it could happen to any of you. I just—”
