"It was him again, wasn't it? You saw him again."
"W-What?"
It was at this point that Sherlock paused. Even though he'd only been reading for a few minutes, the soothing deepness of his voice had lulled Artemis to sleep. Quietly, Sherlock closed the book and set it on the bedside table. Without a word, he and John tucked Artemis into bed. Artemis stirred slightly, but didn't wake up. Pausing momentarily to kiss him on the cheek, Sherlock and John left the room. After turning out the light and closing the door, they walked away toward their bedroom.
In which John seduces Sherlock.
Sherlock laughed. "Go eat your toast, John."
It was only then that she realized John had turned away and was making his way to the door. By the time she'd turned around to call out to him, John had already left the room.
For a few seconds, Sherlock couldn't answer Mycroft. He was still trying to come to terms with what he'd just seen while at the same time trying to stomach the realization that was now rattling about inside of his skull along with the questions that were now forming at alarming speed.
"I think you'd better just leave it with me," Mrs. Hudson said. "They'll be rather occupied this evening."
John stood up and walked over to them.
A few minutes later, the coffee was ready and each of the guests -including the host club members- had each been given their own cup of instant coffee.
"I'm not trying to get their attention anyway," John muttered.
"What a wonderful idea, Mycroft!" Sherlock said, still hugging John tightly. "Our little errand puppy is moving the ranks pretty quickly! Starting today, you're an official member of the host club, John!"
After finding the beginning page number of the chapter reading a few pages, John spoke up again. It was a struggle to keep himself from laughing, but he managed to keep his voice calm.
Jolted out of his thoughts, Sherlock quickly turned back to Irene, who was seated next to him.
"What are you guys bickering about?" John asked.
Something about their smiles made John's heart drop into his stomach.
"Off what?" John asked quietly.
Artemis beamed. "Okay! Take good care of him all right?"
"Good question, Mycroft!" said Sherlock, "There's a famous saying for this sort of thing. One I'm sure you're familiar with, Watson: When in Rome you should do as the Romans do."
The first thing that John was aware of that morning was the terrible headache that made his skull feel like it was splitting. Trying to sit up only made the situation worse as a sudden wave of nausea almost made him empty the contents of his stomach onto the floor. Shutting his eyes, he gingerly laid back down as his head throbbed with pain.
A few days after John had returned from Russia found him sitting on the sofa during a snowy afternoon, feeling slightly drowsy with a blanket drawn around his shoulders. Sherlock was currently in the kitchen, and John could hear sounds that meant Sherlock was hard at work within.
"Which one would you like me to read?" Sherlock was saying. "The Hobbit, or Watership Down?"
For a while, Sherlock was content to watch him, occasionally smoothing the hair on the top of John's head. Now and then John would shift against him, and each time his cheek rubbed Sherlock's belly, as though John were attempting to burrow deeper into his warmth. At such times Sherlock was torn between amusement and affection, though more often he succumbed to the latter. It was here in these quiet moments that he was reminded just how much he loved John; what a relief it was to have him here, safe at last. Sherlock closed his eyes. The warm pressure of John's body, the gentle sound of his breathing, was making him feel drowsy. As much as he didn't want to miss anything, Sherlock couldn't help himself. Just as he began to drift off, he heard his phone vibrating on the coffee table. Reluctantly, he opened an eye and reached for it.
Sherlock couldn't take it any longer.
In spite of himself, Sherlock was beginning to feel uneasy. John had never been this quiet for this long in all the time Sherlock had known him. The result was that as the time slowly ticked by, Sherlock's anxiety grew until finally, he turned his head to look at John and demand what the problem was- only to immediately recoil in shock when he came face to face with the army doctor. Somehow, John had managed to cross the room without the slightest noise, catching Sherlock completely off guard in the process; his front hooves planted firmly on the armrests of the comfortable chair Sherlock was seated in, his breath warm on Sherlock's face.
"Oh good," John said around a mouthful. "I was getting worried."
"All right, listen up," Sherlock snarled. "I don't know what happened back there, and I don't care to find out. But I swear to God Mycroft- if I
"Oh now you've done it, commoner," said Jay. "The bidding for that vase was supposed to start at
John twitched.
?" Out of the corner of his eye, John saw Sherlock's face turn a bright shade of red as the dots quickly connected themselves in Sherlock's mind. It took all the strength John could muster just to keep a casual tone; he felt half mad from the effort of holding his laughter in. "I was wondering if perhaps you could explain to me why that is?"
"No," John answered with a smile. "It's wonderful, Sherlock. Thank you. Although," he added as he shoveled a forkful of cheesy scrambled eggs into his mouth. "I have to ask, since when did you become such a good cook?"
Eventually, he was able to help John untangle himself. They laid back down on the bed together, and Sherlock tugged the bed covers over them, feeling his teeth chatter slightly from being exposed to the cool night air. John was clearly affected too, because he wriggled backward into Sherlock's embrace, desperate to feel Sherlock's reassuring warmth. Sherlock drew his arms around John, one of his hands rubbing soothing circles on John's back.
"Sorry, we were aiming for Irene. But that's what happens when you're caught in the splash zone!" the twins giggled.
"I-It's not anything like that!" John spluttered, now backing away as Sherlock moved towards him. "I was just trying to find a quiet place to study!"
John thought.
"Yes," Sherlock answered, his voice quiet.
. You don't have to drink it just because your little
"Yes, Irene, what is it?"
John was sitting at a table, three women opposite him. Mycroft had been right: the moment John had been dressed like a proper gentleman, it had only taken maybe three minutes before several girls were asking to
Sherlock thought.
The door opened and John stepped out, now dressed in the school's attire.
"About your buddy, John?"
"Quite well, actually," said Mrs. Hudson with a knowing smile. "Never seen them this happy before. You'd think they'd never been separated." Her eyes fell on bag Molly had brought with her. "I take it that's a welcome back gift?" she said.
"We were going to feature that renaissance vase at an upcoming school auction!" grumbled Jim.
"Just what it looks like," John answered. "It's instant coffee."
John just shrugged and grinned at her. "No idea."
angry?"
Twilight entered the library less than a moment later, her smile instantly turning to a puzzled frown when she realized the library was devoid of occupants. After a few moments, Twilight shrugged and exited the room, closing the door behind her.
"And in order to pay off your
He whispered something in Sherlock's ear, and the answer Sherlock screamed made John's ears turn red.
Sherlock went on, not noticing John's annoyed expression. "I realize not everyone is as blessed as I am but you must console yourself: otherwise, how could you go on living?"
"I'm giving up being a detective."
"Yeah, it's great!" John took another sip. "I love it!"
"Erm, okay. Thanks."
Perhaps it was due to their unbridled desire for one another that neither Sherlock or John had registered the sound of Twilight's hooves approaching the library until. They literally only had a second's warning as Twilight called out "Guys, I'm back!"
"Uh, thanks..." John gasped, trying to get his breath back. "But... I'm not... h-hungry at the moment."
It was then that Mycroft opened his eyes and fixed John with a piercing look. John swallowed nervously. Then Mycroft smiled and went on speaking.
"Then I
"Yeah," said Jim. "But he's not going to get far with the ladies if he looks the way he does forever. Maybe if we remove his glasses it'll help?" he added, taking John's glasses.
"That's it, I'm out of here!" John said as he moved towards the doors.
A few minutes later, John was out in the pond, having waded in barefoot to get his belongings out of the water. The only thing that seemed to be missing now was his wallet, which he knew he couldn't afford to lose.
Without waiting for Irene's response, Sherlock stood up and walked over to John, giving him an affectionate pat on the head.
John thought to himself.
"Sherlock?" John said, breaking into his thoughts. "What's wrong?"
What really bothered him though was the clear toll the incident had taken on John's health. Ever since his return he'd been more susceptible to cold, and now it was clear that his immune system had been compromised as well. This made Sherlock worried. If John was this badly affected, who knew what other problems might have been caused by the event?
"You're serious?"
On either side of Sherlock, the twins were shaking their heads and making tutting sounds with visible disgust. "You really shouldn't have been so mean!" they said.
type!"
"So, tell me what kind of guy you're into!" Sherlock said. "Do you like the strong, silent type like Hunter? The mischievous? The boy Lolita type, like Artemis? Or maybe you like the
At this statement, Spike, Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash collapsed to the ground, almost crying with mirth. Rarity looked scandalized. Apple Jack and Fluttershy suddenly seemed preoccupied with examining the ground beneath their hooves. Twilight narrowed her eyes at Discord, and John... he just stared at the scene before him, with eyes as big as dinner plates. After a full minute of ruckus laughter, Twilight cleared her throat loudly.
"W-What?"
On the floor, John lay in a mess of tangled sheet and duvet, struggling to free himself from the fabric. Unfortunately, his violent struggling and kicking was only making the situation worse. But the thing that scared Sherlock most was the terrible scared noises that John was making.
"Well now, funny you should ask," said the tall one with short dark hair. "We are the Ouran Host Club. I'm Mycroft Holmes, this here is Hunter Lockwood-" he gestured to the man on his left. Hunter looked at John, with no change in the stoic expression he wore. "This is Artemis-" Mycroft said, indicating the small blonde youth who stood in front of Hunter. The boy smiled brightly at John and waved. "These two gentlemen here are Jim and Jay, the Moriarty twins-" The twins leered mischievously at John, their dark eyes boring into John. "Which leaves-"
"A hundred grams for just a few pounds?" asked Jim.
As ever, it seemed Sherlock was only half listening to him.
"Oh for heaven's sake." John muttered.
"What are you talking about?" John was starting to feel annoyed now. "It's
.....
John nodded against him.
"Uhh..."
John froze where he stood, struggling to come to terms with what he was seeing.
!" he wailed. "I WOULD
"Column D, Section 1, or as others may refer to it, the Critical Care Knowledge section. Right there," she added, pointing without looking to a shelf directly to John's left.
That had been far too close for comfort.
"Let the tasting begin!" said Sherlock.
.....
"Then would you like to hold my friend Lancelot for a bit?" Artemis asked, holding up the white stuffed rabbit he always carried with him.
It felt as though someone had struck Sherlock in the gut with a metal bat. That expression on John's face.
At the word "gay," John twitched violently. Turning his head towards Sherlock, eyes narrowing in anger. "I'm not gay!" he growled.
Sherlock glared at him and said nothing.
John wondered as he went to prepare the coffee.
enough to buy it!" Looking up at John, she smiled. "Oh, pardon me. I was talking to myself."
"Oh, it's
"You're not trying to fatten me up with sweets, are you?" he said.
You're crying."
"You know John, I've been thinking," Sherlock said. "We've got to do something about your appearance. No girl will look at you twice, otherwise."
"Wait a second, what is this?" Sherlock asked, staring at the box instant coffee he was holding.
"So, is it okay if we request to see you again tomorrow?" the girls were saying.
Vainly he tried to open the doors of the music hall, but the handles refused to budge.
"I've never seen this brand before," remarked Sherlock. "Is it the kind that's already ground?"
"Yes, John."
"Thanks for doing the shopping, little piglet! Did you make sure to get everything we asked for?"
After a moment's consideration, Sherlock leaned forward and plucked one of the cookies off the plate, offering it to John. John smirked as he accepted it.
"Daddy!" Artemis said happily. He quickly scrambled out of bed and ran to John, who had already knelt to embrace his son.
"It's quite simple really," Sherlock answered. "After you disappeared I...let's just say I was in a dark place for a while. Eventually though, Molly slapped some sense into me." Sherlock smiled, and there was pain in his eyes. "I realized that even if you were never able to come back, I had to start behaving as though you would. Anything, if it would only take my mind off..." He paused.
"I've got it!
Relieved to at last be out of the elevator, John quickly stepped past Mycroft and went to hug Sherlock. Sherlock's eyes gave nothing away as they embraced,  but John could feel his concern in the way Sherlock held him close, one hand moving up to rub the back of John's head, soothing him. John couldn't help hiding his face in Sherlock's coat, his own fingers clenching the material of Sherlock's coat. Sherlock felt John's hands where they were tensed on his back. He glared suspiciously at Mycroft over John's shoulder. But his voice was low and calm as he spoke into John's ear.
For a split second, Irene was frozen; her eyes locked onto John's in an expression of bewilderment and horror. Everything after that happened so quickly that no one was sure what happened first: Irene splashing her scalding hot cup of tea in John's face- which thankfully he dodged- Sherlock dashing to John's side; or the twins dumping two pitchers of ice cold water over Irene's head.
The twins seemed to read his mind as they smirked at each other. "With what money? You can't even afford a school uniform!"
"Now then, do you remember what were talking about, Sherlock?" Discord asked.
"Don't ask stupid questions! And don't come back in until I'm ready!" he snarled before slamming the door on their faces.
"W-What does that mean?" John squeaked nervously.
me for not buying you guys expensive coffee!"
"Artemis," Sherlock said.
"You... go eat some cake with Lancelot!"
Above them, Irene stood at window, watching everything. Once again she could feel anger simmering in her blood.
"I don't see what the big deal is," he said.
"My John," Sherlock murmured. "I love you."
"There's something else you wanted me, isn't there?" said John. "What is it?"
"All right, enough standing around!" Sherlock said, walking over to the serving area. "John! Get over here and make some of this commoner's coffee!"
John thought. He honestly wasn't sure if things could get any worse. He found he was hugging the stuffed rabbit a little too tightly now against his chest.
"I'm sorry ladies, but some new information has just been brought to my attention which concerns the Host Club. If you would all kindly exit, I promise the issue will be dealt with promptly."
"I want you to come in my mouth," John said. His blue eyes were hungry, full of intent. "I want to know what you taste like after you've gone over the edge."
"Aww!" the twins sighed in frustration.
..." Sherlock murmured as the girls got up and left. He watched John wave goodbye to them, still smiling.
John stepped backward, freezing as his rump came into contact with Sherlock's front. Before he could even moved, Sherlock had somehow pulled John upright and turned him around so that they were both standing on their hind legs, John's back pressed hard against the cold surface of the crystal shelf. This new turn of events meant that Sherlock had John completely at his mercy; trapped against the wall like a pinned butterfly.
The drone of something pulsating on wood from the bedroom caused John to retrace his steps until he stood by Sherlock’s tangled blanket. As the phone went to voicemail, he saw it. It was under the bed, still plugged into the charger. It had clearly fallen from its usual place on his bedside table, causing the screen to crack and go patchy. It was lit up, showing two texts and a missed call from John Watson.
“The – uh – the other stuff,” he muttered, looking away.
“Well then I won’t ask. But I’m here, alright?”
He moved hurriedly through the maze that led to the fresh, cool air of outside, and raised a hand to beckon a taxi, not caring if Lestrade noticed he was gone or not. The plain back fabric upholstery on the cab seats was a balm on Sherlock’s battered mind. He closed his eyes, and thought of nothing but pain for the rest of eternity. Lights passed overhead, and the colours screamed as they flickered behind his eyelids.
“So he wasn’t killed here?” It was phrased as a question, but the answer was obvious enough. Sherlock nodded anyway.
Predictably, they had beaten Lestrade back, who had no doubt hung around long enough to give further directions to the useless forensics team. In the meanwhile, officers made small talk with John, noting his absence and stealing his attention. Sherlock sat in silence and tried to quash his rising dejectedness. It took far too long for the lift door to slide open, revealing the detective inspector that they had been waiting for. Impatiently, Sherlock stood, entering Lestrade’s office before he himself had reached it. No one commented.
Sherlock flicks his eyes over to the dresser. There, indeed is a bundle which he supposes is the blanket that normally resides on John's chair . In addition, John has brought a glass of water, though Sherlock isn't thirsty, and never drinks in the night. He reaches for the quilt regardless, not caring that he won't use it, it just gives him a warm feeling in his chest that John thought of it. John grabs the blanket and the water without seeing the look on Sherlock's face and brings them both over. Once the the patchwork is settled over the bed, John digs into the pocket of his jeans, pulling out small pack of what Sherlock can only assume are painkillers. He takes them and the water wordlessly, swallowing two at the same time, before returning the water to John.
If this felt a little rushed, then I'm ever so sorry. In all honesty it was. I've had some issues with family and also some big exams coming up. This chapter is a bit of a filler, really: it sort of just get us from point A to B without much happening, which I'm terrible at writing. My apologies, do let me know if anything needs changing.
“Our attacker is female.”
Walking down the corridor to Sherlock’s bedroom door, he opened it a crack. He could see the foot of the bed, bathed in the same golden sunlight as his own. As he stepped into the room, John paused. The bed was left unmade, as Sherlock was wont to do, but there was no sign of the man himself. The pillows were both crooked, one almost falling off the bed, and yesterday’s clothes left on the floor.
Catching John’s sleeve as he turned, Sherlock tugged John along to the next room, adjacent to the one they currently stood in. When they pushed open the door, John burst out laughing, using Sherlock’s frame for support as he doubled over. For his part, Sherlock simply raised an eyebrow and exhaled heavily through his nose.
him. He had seen his last frame, had seen the position from which he would never move. He had seen the bluest eyes without life, seen them open without the knowledge and without the spark that had made Sherlock fall again and again, in so many ways.
Sherlock smirked.
“So, someone’s nicked his organs.”
“Right then. Best get these down to the Yard, dust them for prints. CCTV is waiting for you there too,” Lestrade spoke, breaking the silence.
Answer: The man who broke him.
“You won’t deduce it.”
“Sherlock… She wasn’t planning on telling you. She wanted you to - ”
“I’m fully aware of that Sherlock, but she didn’t want you to worry.”
The door creaked as it was winched open, cerulean blue in the spinning lights of the police cars that parked patiently on the curb. The inside of the building was dimly lit, leaving the shadows to become monsters in the dark. Foreboding hung like streamers from the rafters, tickling the shoulders of those who passed beneath. The building hummed with the quiet buzz of electricity and secrets, muffling the sounds of scuffing footsteps that shuffled uneasily through the door. Rows of shelves filled with iceboxes created yawning alleys within the single room, breaking up the space to something far larger.  The unsettled crowd hovered uncertainly, waiting for authority, as a pack of wolves may in a crisis.
He looked at Sherlock for a long minute, and Sherlock looked back, both assessing the other. Sherlock didn’t like the way Mycroft’s pinstriped grey suit looked against the pattern of the chair; it was much more suited to the wool of John’s jumpers. He’d gained weight as well, the arrogant sod; happy in his new relationship. Despite himself, Sherlock felt a twinge of something that could only be described as want.
It was another day later, three days since John had had his whole perception of the world flipped, before Sherlock showed any signs of wakefulness. His parents and his brother had left briefly, to get themselves a meal, leaving John to his silent vigil. Sherlock’s eyelids fluttered, his long eyelashes flickering like shadows against his pale cheekbones, and his fingers curled slightly as the muscles in his hand tensed. John held his breath as the pale turquoise eyes opened slowly, blinking sluggishly in the relative brightness of the hospital room. He inhaled deeply, if a little laboured, and cast a glance around the room, letting his head loll to the side.
“You’re saying the murderer killed up after herself a little too well?”
Sherlock frowned. “I thought you were divorcing her?”
“Hmm? What was that? Yeah, yeah. Just... you know the wife.”
Humming noncommittally, Sherlock moved closer to the bed, letting all of his focus settle on the man on the bed, knowing that no lurking attacker would get to him if his attention was diverted now. He tugged on his gloves with practised ease and immediately prodded the flap of flesh that had once been the right side of the man’s chest cavity. It flopped back into place with a sickeningly wet sound.
“Do you – I mean, if you wanted – You could sleep in my room.” At Sherlock’s inquisitive look, he hastily added, “I’ll sleep in yours, if you wanted to. It was just an idea, if being somewhere else – ”
Sherlock didn’t bother to return what was clearly a statement. A sigh reached his ears as the door to the fridge was closed gently.
“It’ll do,” the doctor chuckled.
Opening his eyes to let the pale light seep in, Sherlock turned away from the wardrobe, padding towards the frosted glass door that separated the bedroom and bathroom. Once inside, Sherlock locked both doors; a force of habit, left over from when there was someone around to walk in.  Reaching into the cupboard for the steel, Sherlock caught his reflection’s eye. Pupils dilated; a direct result of the adrenaline shuddering its way through his bloodstream with each heartbeat.
Sunlight streamed in through the window, bathing the room in soft light. John groaned, burying his head under his pillow in an attempt to block out the light. He lay there for a moment, before realising that he was far too awake to be able to fall back asleep.
The next alley yielded to Sherlock’s scrutiny. Footsteps reverberated along the row to the right; likely an officer getting bored with the search. Sherlock dismissed it with a frustrated breath, let out between his teeth, before catching it again.
Sherlock awoke to find himself blind. It took a muddled moment of panic for him to feel the scratchy cloth over his eyes, and to realise that he had, in fact, been blindfolded. His heart thumping heavily in his chest, Sherlock did his best to analyse his immediate surroundings. He was sat on a chair, going by the feel of it, and his ankles were tied to the legs of the chair. His arms meanwhile were tied wrist to elbow behind him, leaving him in an awkward, immobile, soon to be painful position.
He shrugged, “That’s what Dimmock said.”
The sleek black door with its golden knocker loomed up to embrace Sherlock sooner than he thought possible, and he thrust a handful of notes in the cabby’s direction, before scrabbling out of the car. He stumbled to the door, using his bodyweight to force it open. He heaved himself up the stairs using the banister to get him there, and collapsed into the place that used to be home.
This is meant to be about ten days after the events of the previous chapter. I'm not medically trained, and I won't pretend to be, so I'm afraid that my ability to write a convincing medical setting and treatment was minimal at best (I tried, and it went miserably wrong).
“I need to find the source of the dirt on this,” he passed the shoe to John, who crinkled his nose in disgust.
The door closes behind him with the muted thud.
“Kinda, started too, but I guess they didn’t use petrol or anything on it, ‘cos it didn’t catch.”
As the kettle screeched to a conclusion, Sherlock reached behind him without looking, avoiding the thistle funnel that balanced precariously in a small beaker, to snag a mug from where he had left it earlier, after his morning tea. With the other hand, he reached for the teabags, tossing one into the cup in an echo of childhood fun.
Mycroft sighed heavily. “You’re better at this than you used to be.”
The laugh that forced its way through Sherlock’s teeth sounded strangled to his own ears. “So she’d rather leave me ignorant to the disease that’s tearing her apart from the inside?” The metaphor was childish, but it matched the feeling of desperation rising within him.
And then laughter interrupted Sherlock’s thoughts as John spluttered and doubled over. He lifted his head to look at Sherlock and almost cried at the expression of indignation on the detective’s face.
It’s articulate and proper and there is no trace of the lisp that sometimes colours his voice when he hasn’t slept enough. John reaches out, only for Sherlock to step away.
A tap to his shoulder caused John to look up. Sherlock had strewn the rest of the girl’s possessions around the room, none of which seemed to pique his interest. His fingertips brushed the windowsill briefly but there was scant evidence there other than a parched fly. Sherlock held his hand out for the box in John’s grasp, and John relinquished it. It quickly vanished into the deep pockets of Sherlock’s coat.
Mycroft's voice was firmer now, breaking into Sherlock's thoughts. He was suddenly aware of the damp quality of his cheeks. Irritably he rubbed them dry with his sleeve; taking a deep breath at the same time to compose himself.
"No." Sherlock stood up, with Mycroft quickly moving aside for him. "I'll do it."
He quickly turned away and left the room. John watched him go, feeling a mix of confusion and concern. He had a feeling that Sherlock was hiding something, and he was determined to find out what.
His heart seemed to melt inside of his chest, and Sherlock could feel tears in his eyes.
Several minutes later, the other host club members had joined them in waiting.
A pillow materialized out of nowhere and soared across the room, hitting Twilight square in the face. Twilight dislodged it with a firm shake of her head, her frown deepening to a scowl as she spat feathers from her mouth.
Sherlock smiled at him. "It means that seeing as you have no money to pay us with, you can pay with your body! Starting today, you're the host club's dog!"
John thought to himself, feeling slightly panicked.
"John, I've got a few more towels if you-"
"John?"
Amidst the hilarious chaos that ensued as the host members tried to separate John from Sherlock's vice-like embrace, no one noticed the way Irene's baleful eyes burned into John; resentment and jealousy turning her blood hot with rage.
Mycroft, for his part, didn't dare risk more than a sideways glance at his brother. The atmosphere that hung around Sherlock was cold and menacing. In fact, Mycroft wasn't wholly convinced that trying to explain what had happened wouldn't end with Sherlock biting his head off. Then Sherlock turned so sharply in his direction that Mycroft jumped. When Sherlock's eyes locked onto his, Mycroft suddenly had the horrible feeling of being placed under a microscope. It was like Sherlock was looking straight through him.
"Your welcome!" said Sherlock, who had left his chair to give John a friendly pat on the back. "You're a hero to other poor people, Watson!" John cringed at the word "poor". "You've shown the world that even a poor person can excel at an elite private academy!" At this point, John attempted to move away, but to his dismay Sherlock only followed him, still talking. "It must be hard for you to constantly be looked down upon by others!"
"What the- HEY, LET GO!" John yelled.
"Yes, they're quite sensitive indeed," answered Twilight, looking up from her book. "It's mainly due to the fact that they're what connects us to the magical forces in our world. It's also the reason many unicorns go for horn filing, because naturally having longer horns means challenging the Princess' authority. Also, the larger a horn is, the more powerful the magic the individual is capable of performing, though as I've said before, magic always has the potential to be dangerous, so practice is key..."
Despite the fact Sherlock's reply sounded casual, John could feel an underlying sense of danger. In this case it couldn't have been clearer what Sherlock was actually telling him: "Go to our room. Now."
"Yes, John?"
The door burst open.
"Or maybe..." Sherlock said, his face now inches from John's. "You're into men like
," he said. "This wasn't an accident. You didn't do this. Someone's made you their target for harassment. I'm going to find out who they are and why. Now what is it that you're still looking for?"
Whatever John was going to say, he never got the chance. At that moment Artemis came bounding over to him, talking excitedly as he nearly tackled John to the floor with a hug.
As John came up beside Sherlock at the stove, he was surprised to see that not only was Sherlock cooking, but he was somehow managing to prepare three different items at once. There were pancakes, scrambled eggs and a pan of bacon.
John thought scathingly. "It's not often God creates a perfect person like me after all. Beautiful both inside and out."
"I am severely disappointed in you, Irene," Sherlock went on. "You of all people should know that nobility is not a birth right. It is determined by one's actions. What you have done here today is nothing short of disgraceful. I'm sure your father is going to be very upset when he finds out about this."
It took a few seconds, but John had soon woken from his nightmare. However, just a moment after making eye contact with Sherlock he began to cry, his body shaking with sobs. Sherlock didn't say anything, but held John against him, rubbing soothing circles on the back of John's head.
"Well, my dear," Sherlock said as he came to her side. "What if I let you drink from my mouth?"
John was sitting across from Sherlock in the castle library again. The two were completely alone this time, Twilight having left for Sweet Apple Acres, and Spike was currently away in Canterlot. Sherlock was trying his best not to look at John, who had been quietly staring at him for the past fifteen minutes, not saying a word as he sat perfectly still.
Meanwhile, Sherlock had staggered numbly back to the chair he'd been sitting in, looking pale as a sheet. This was instantly noticed by the rest of the Host Club, along with several of the guests. All were looking at Sherlock with concern in their eyes. Mycroft was the first to act, bending over his brother to shield his face from view as he spoke in a low and urgent voice.
"You taste so sweet," Sherlock murmured after a minute. "You really enjoyed those cookies, didn't you?"
, hmm?"
Luckily, the elevator chose that moment to do just that. John almost sighed with relief, and then went cold when he saw Sherlock standing in the hall.
"Finally, some place quiet," he muttered as he opened the doors.
of me, aren't you."
"John you look so adorable in that!" Sherlock said, coming forward to hug John.
Had John had any idea of the events that would unfold after he entered that room, odds were good that he would have turned and ran in the other direction like a bat out of Hell. But he didn't know, so he entered.
"Oh my, that must have been dreadful!" she said the next day after hearing about it from the host club members. "I don't know what I might of done if it had been me! How terrible for you!"
. John took a deep breath.
John thought.
"Sherlock, may I have a word with you?"
"Thanks, love."
he wondered.
The day that it began was just as the previous week had been. Twilight was quietly sitting in her library reading a book. Not too far away, Sherlock also had his face hidden behind a thick volume, though his mind wasn't on the words written on the pages. Instead, he was peering surreptitiously over the top at John, who seemed to be looking for a specific kind of book as his eyes scanned the shelf in front of him.
The words had scarcely come out of her mouth when there was a loud yell from overhead. Although Molly couldn't hear what was said, she could easily recognize John's voice, followed by a distinct thud. She didn't have to be told what was going on to understand what John and Sherlock were doing, but it was enough to make her blush and say awkwardly "O-Oh...have they been at it very long?"
"John!" Sherlock called after a minute. "Do you want whipped topping or marshmallows in your cocoa?"
After a while of chatting, Molly said "So how are John and Sherlock doing?"
"Why?"
Sherlock raised his head. His eyes locked onto John's.
find you that close to John again, I swear I'll
Discord ignored him. He tapped Sherlock on the head. Instantly, Sherlock's hair and skin turned grey, and his face changed from horror to an annoyed scowl.
"What? Why?" John demanded. "Why are you guys forcing this on me all of a sudden?"
What Irene didn't know of course was that her plan hadn't gone as flawlessly as she'd supposed. In fact, the Moriarty twins had seen her dump John's things out the window the previous day, as had Mycroft. It was they who informed Sherlock that John needed help outside, and they had spent the previous afternoon planning how to punish Irene for her premeditated crime. Now she and John were seated together at a table, while the other hosts pretended to be busy with their own clients.
"To think we were so worried about him," remarked the twins. "Turns out, no training is required!"
"Uh...wow," he said, an incredulous smile quickly forming on his face.
Sherlock turned around, smiling. "Is that so? Would you like to know more?"
"You're kidding!" Sherlock exclaimed. "That's the most important thing in the world, John! You must learn to be a gentleman and please the ladies, like
"You didn't think I'd let you out of it that easily, did you?"
"Hey, come back here, John!" Artemis said, pulling John's arm. "You must be like a super hero or something, huh?"
John opened his mouth, but instead of words all that came out was a series of terrible dry coughs that left the inside of his throat raw and stinging. Alarmed, Sherlock felt his forehead and quickly stepped back when he realized that it was burning.
John jumped- he hadn't even heard Sherlock approach.
John was stunned. "He's...there's no way he's..."
John thought miserably.
"Well, good night!" Sherlock said happily.
Let go of me, you bloody lunatic!" John yelled.
"Uh, m-my wallet," John answered him. "Uh, hey!" he added quickly as Sherlock took off his socks and shoes and began rolling back his pants. "You don't have to help, you know."
"You're wrong!" shouted Artemis. "Mycroft and the twins saw you dump John's stuff in the pond yesterday, you big meanie! You're not fooling anyone!"
I understand what the problem is," he said in a flat voice devoid of feeling. "You're
John woke some time in the night from a slight ache in his shoulder. Turning onto his side, he heard Sherlock make a faint sound of protest as he sat up and stretched, shivering a little from the cold winter night. After a moment or two the slight pain in John's shoulder went away, and it was with a sleepy yawn that he settled back down beside Sherlock, Sherlock's arms pulling John close to him, burrowing his face into John's shoulder with a sigh of contentment.
"Twilight," he said finally, making sure that Sherlock could hear him clearly from across the room. "Where did you say the
"John," Sherlock mumbled.
"Who are you and what have you done with Sherlock Holmes?"
Not too far away, Sherlock was peering over the back of a couch, his eyes fixed on John with a mix of empathy and admiration. Much like the girls seated with John, he couldn't help admiring the steadfast determination that John had shown, even under what must have been terrible circumstances. More than that though, Sherlock had a feeling that there was more to the story than John was willing to say. For although he was smiling, Sherlock could tell he was actually in a lot of pain.
"I didn't even know there was such a thing!" said one guest.
"Nothing," John said, bending his head over the drink so Sherlock couldn't see the smile he was trying to hide. "It's perfect. Thank you."
"I'm fine guys, really," John mumbled. "You don't need to make such a big fuss over me."
He had been expecting a call from Lestrade, so he was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be a text message from Molly instead.
"Stay here," he said. "Don't try to get up. I'll be right back."
drink it!" the woman said, now on the verge of swooning.
"Just a bit of milk to make it creamy," Sherlock answered. "Do you like it?"
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "
John's only response was a nod. Sherlock tightened his arms around John, his low voice a reassuring sound in the darkness of the room.
"Enough is enough, Mycroft!" they all snarled.
"Okay fine, but you have to get out first!" John shot back.
"Commoners are pretty smart," remarked Mycroft.
"So what are you planning to do instead?"
"Me," the last host club member said. Unlike the others, he was seated in an elegant chair. His hair was dark brown with hints of auburn, and his pale body was lean and and thin. The host club member smiled at John, eyes opening to reveal irises as blue as the oceans only seen in the tropics. "Sherlock Holmes, the Ouran Host Club king."
Glancing at his mug's contents, John felt an odd flipping sensation in his stomach.
a joke.
"You look so handsome, John!" squeaked Artemis.
This was met by a chorus of excited shrieks from the crowd of girls gathered around them.
Meanwhile, Sherlock and Mycroft were standing side by side in the elevator as it returned to the first floor. Neither said anything. Sherlock stared straight ahead. His eyes had changed color again, and were now a cold iron grey.
"It's all right now," Sherlock whispered. "I'm here. He can't hurt you anymore."
When John woke up again, it was in the early hours of the morning. It had snowed again during the night, and in the pale gray light of dawn London was peaceful under a gleaming layer of fresh white snow.
"It's very nice to meet you, Miss Adler!" he said, smiling painfully.
Totally bewildered by this, John stood there while the others offered their compliments as well.
Clearing his throat, Sherlock addressed the room at large.
Sherlock smiled as he sat down beside John, setting the tray on the low table before handing John his cup.
After several agonizing minutes during which John managed to extricate himself from his blankets, Sherlock had returned from the kitchen. Although his nose was stuffy, John could just barely detect the smell of toast. Even though he had no appetite, he knew that it would be pointless to turn down food. With some help from Sherlock, he was able to sit up. Sherlock then handed him his plate, which not only had two pieces of toast but also a skinned orange, a glass of water, a small pill for his headache, and a small measurement of Pepto-Bismol.
"I love you, John," Sherlock said. "I love you, I love you."
The twins ignored him. Grabbing John's arms, they whisked him off to the changing rooms.
"Hey, I need those things!" John objected, not noticing that the twins were now both gawping at him in adoration. "I used to have contacts but I lost them on the first day of school and-"
Sherlock's hand was on John's crotch now, rubbing teasingly at his trapped erection. John whimpered and pressed closer to the feeling, his head going foggy with pleasure. God, he hadn't felt like this in a long time. He could barely even stay focused on what Sherlock was saying.
"I don't think it's all that important, that's all!" John replied. "Why should I care about appearances? All that really matters is what's inside a person's heart, right? What's even then point of having a club like this?"
"So much for being dignified!" Jim snorted. "Did you see the way she marched out? What a joke!"
"Jim! Jay!" he said, snapping his fingers.
he thought.
"Of course I have. I'm training him to be a gentleman, like me."
This earned an audible "MMHMM!" from all the other ladies gathered around.
John smiled in the dark. "I love you too."
! DON'T LISTEN TO HIM!
"I'm a bit scared to drink this stuff," said one girl.
?" John repeated.
"Please don't sneak up on me like that," he said.
John stepped into the elevator, and Mycroft stepped in after him. John was silently surprised at this. He'd half expected Mycroft to send a guard up with him instead, and yet here he was, standing right next to John as the elevator door slid shut. He pushed the button for the tenth floor, and a moment later the elevator began it ascent. For a while, there was complete silence. Mycroft was staring straight ahead, his expression unreadable, though every so often John saw his eyes focus on him. After a while, John began to feel slightly uncomfortable. He had the impression that Mycroft had something to say, but just as he was about to ask what it was, Mycroft broke the silence.
After taking a moment to  find the right page, Sherlock began.
John pulled back slightly, his mouth returning to the soft skin of Sherlock's throat. He started to kiss his way down Sherlock's throat, pausing to suck the occasional love bite until he reached the dip in Sherlock's collar bone.
Sherlock is propped up in the corner of the room. Red stains his white shirt, his blood covering the front of his chest. John reaches for him, and he recoils sluggishly.
“S’fine. It’s normal.”
Sherlock frowned. Aside from the oasis on the sheets, there was no blood in the room. No crimson stain painted the wall to indicate where the bullet had pierced the victim’s skull, no ruby handprint to suggest he fell.
, Sherlock signed.
John frowned. “Not another client?”
But the truth is he was missed, selfishly by the man he had left behind. Missed by the one person who misses nobody. Because that’s what John Watson does. He takes the most broken people, the ones everyone else has thrown away, given up as worthless, and he mends them. Puts their pieces back together again, gives them a purpose. And the thing about John Watson is he does it unknowingly. If he knew, it’s certain he would hold back, because once you fix someone, once you become their salvation; they begin to need you.
Sherlock nodded absently, filtering the information. Rarely was a name of use. A licence however, could reveal habits and influences. Clicking back to the footage, Sherlock rewound the tape, searching for the right combination of numbers and letters, tuning out Lestrade and John’s mutters. There.
He clung to John, panic flashing through him as he was loaded into the ambulance. He calmed again as John clambered in after him, immediately taking his place beside him and taking his hand once more.
Scattered across the floor were clothes, crumpled and shying away from view. Some looked as if they hadn’t been washed in months, were practically merging into the beige carpet. What looked like it had once been Chinese takeaways rested on the dresser and bedside table, giving the impression that had it not been for the stench of human remains in the room, it would doubtless have smelt of mould and soy sauce.
“It’s me, you’re alright,” he murmured.
“I don’t suppose I can convince you to go home, can I?” He speaks with the resignation of someone who knows his answer.
Thank you for your patience, my dears.
So I'm back!! More than two years later... but heck, I've had some free time for the first time in years , so I've been rediscovering some old passions (writing is just as soothing sit always was - I don't know why I stopped!)
I seem to have forgotten how to write in the interim though, so I won't be claiming this as my best piece of work by any means, but I've kept you waiting for so long that I just..
He had caused this. The death of the man who had healed him. He had seen him opened up, seen his bare components in the cold light of a torch, seen the perfect, expected layout of his organs, seen what had
Sherlock is getting dizzy from blood loss and hyperventilation, and black splodges are blurring over his vision. The lips move up, trailing wetly up the column of Sherlock’s neck, and he can feel his heartbeat pounding in his head. When he meets jawbone, the skinhead raises his face and grips Sherlock’s jaw. He bends down and for one pulse of his heart, pauses. Then his lips are sealing themselves over Sherlock’s and his tongue is tracing Sherlock’s mouth. His middle finger and thumb press into the joint of his jaw, and Sherlock’s mouth is forced open. He writhes desperately as a tongue forces its way into his mouth, tasting of cheap alcohol and cigarette smoke, but rough hands and rope hold his face and body still.
“’Bout fifteen minutes from the scene.”
The computer monitor whirred mechanically in the background as Lestrade flicked through the cameras that surrounded Baker Street, but it was as impossible to track one taxi in central London as it were to track a snowflake in an avalanche.
He shakes his head, “Not you.” It’s a whisper of breath.
The kitchen was eerily silent, as it always is first thing in the morning, when Sherlock is still tucked away in his room, sleeping like the dead. John filled the kettle and put it on to boil, the sound of the water bubbling filling the room. He pulled out a mug, dropping a teabag into it. He debated making a second, but the lanky git probably wouldn’t be up for another hour at the least, unless there was a case. Pouring the now boiled water into the cup, John decided that now was as good a time as any to read the morning paper – it had been sat there since Wednesday without being used for anything other than an impromptu coaster.
It feels like forever before the silence is broken, once again by Mycroft. “Tea?”
There a little bit of medical stuff here, which, I'll be honest, I have very little knowledge of. I tried to do a little bit of research, but if there's anyone who spots something off, do let me know.
Sherlock quirked a smile and stepped inside, letting the door swing shut behind him. He was alone in the room, and for good reason. The smell lay over him like a thick layer of snow, creeping into his lungs with each breath, seeming to bind with the air and leave him gasping for breath. It was a scent that hung thick as treacle in the air, strangling the other senses. Breathing through his mouth, Sherlock stepped forward. It wasn’t difficult to find the source of the smell. The sickly sweet metal smell originated from the man lying face up on the bed. His arms lay relaxed at his side, legs stretched out to the end of the bed. His eyes were closed, which might have given him the appearance of merely sleeping, had it not been for the grimace that twisted his features. That and the bloodstained sheets that he lay on.
John turned to face Sherlock who nodded, understanding what had passed from the movement of Lestrade’s lips.
There is a round of affirmative murmurs, and Mycroft sweeps out of the room, letting the door swing shut behind him. John remained, alongside his parents, watching the unconscious form in the bed, counting each rise and fall of his chest, every beep of the heart rate monitor.
“Just gone two months,” John’s happiness fills the cab like airborne ammonia, and Sherlock feels like he’s drowning in it, like he can’t get to the surface; he’s been left, abandoned in the sea. But he smiles, because this is John, and John is happy, and if John is happy then Sherlock will bear the weight of hell on his shoulders to keep it that way.
Making their way downstairs, Sherlock continued to look around, cataloguing everything he saw, fitting it into order. The scratches on the lock, the collection of old shoes, the impressions of heels in the carpet just outside the kitchen. He stopped.
When morning dawned the following day, John woke to long arms draped across him, effectively pinning him to the mattress. Despite being restricted, he smiled. Warmth radiated out from the body beside him, almost uncomfortably so, and soft puffs of breath were damp against his neck. Close together like this, John could smell Sherlock, his hair tickling the tip of his nose.
He might have screamed, he wasn’t sure, but all of the air in his lungs was suddenly gone, and he fought for breath as pain knifed through him, unrelenting and unending. Sherlock went still as the weight on him shifted, fighting to think through the pain, fighting to escape.
Walking back out of the room, John stuck his head into the bathroom, lest he be in there, but he was met with only the harsh glare of the light off the tiles. Wandering back up to his room, he grabbed his phone, sending a text to Sherlock in an attempt to find out where he was.
The kitchen, unlike the rest of the house, was clean. Or rather, the floor and walls were. The surface were still cluttered with leftovers, but it was almost as if they had been placed later, arranged as a strange artwork. Sherlock laughed with derision.
Inside, John winced with sympathy as Lestrade ran a weary hand over a lined face.
Lestrade was the first to speak as Sherlock ducked under the yellow tape.
“I’ll have someone find it on CCTV,” John recognized the determination in Mycroft’s voice from his younger brother, latching onto it like a lifeline.
A passing cabbie slowed down at the sight of Sherlock’s raised arm, thus relieving him of the need to further pursue the conversation. Inside the cab was warm, the heaters turned up high to combat the cool air that clung to the two passengers. The driver’s hesitation was fractional as Sherlock directed his to the Yard, clearly discomforted by the infamous men currently sat lazily in the back of his cab, watching the street with peaceful detachment.
“Mycroft.”
He nodded. “What did you expect?”
The youth forces his chin up to meet his eyes, and the animalistic glee that Sherlock sees in them sends a shiver through him. Cold pain writhes up from the soft skin of his stomach as the thin edge of a blade whispers across it. Sparks glitter around the edge of his vision as Sherlock keens, pinned down by ropes and hands, unable to move away as he is carved open with practiced ease.
Throwing his towel into the laundry basket to be washed later, John stood in the kitchen, phone in his hand. He watched it for a long while, as if he could somehow will Sherlock into replying to him. When, after several long minutes, there was no indication that he was about to answer, John put a slice of toast into the toaster. When it popped up again, he took a bite dry, not bothering to grab a plate.
And how many times has he seen that body? He’s seen it countless times, had to stitch it up nigh on a million times, seen it draped languidly over the sofa in nought but a sheet, and felt its weight leaning against him in a cab after a taxing case. And yet, after what feels like an eternity together, he failed to recognise it when it mattered.
“White male, maybe mid to late forties, no identification yet. No sign of the killer either,” he spoke softly, almost reservedly, causing Sherlock to glance at him for a second.
Sherlock considered death. In that minute he thought more about death than he had done in the past year. He was disturbingly familiar with it. It was a constant in the never ending turbulence of crime. So why did the news of one more impending death affect him so drastically? He never was one to get attached.
Having done so, Sherlock stooped to deposit the empty carton in the bin before hesitating; John always did something else first. A small wrinkle touched the space between his eyebrows as Sherlock thought back. It was something simple, menial. What was it John always said whenever Sherlock used to forget? Ah yes, wash it out, otherwise it’ll start to smell bad. So Sherlock straightened up again and stepped to the sink, putting the opening of the white bottle under the nozzle of the tap, turning the handles to allow a vicious stream of water to escape the pipes, blasting inside the plastic to create its own, private tsunami that ran in circles around the walls. Shaking the container to collect any leftover residue lining the side, Sherlock tipped the murky water down the sink, watching as it circled the drain in a slow dance before finally giving in to gravity and tumbling down into the sewers.
The two men groan in synchrony. Whoever was sending the messages was smart. Smart enough to bounce them off several satellites, effectively making the source unidentifiable. Lestrade pinches the bridge of his nose.
Raindrops broke open on the concrete like mice skulls under the wheels of the beaten silver Honda Accord parked in front of the squatting, grey warehouse. Light leaked out into the shadow-drenched street, chasing the darkness out of the crevices it crouched in. The building itself was low to the ground, shorter than its surroundings and several shades greyer. Malevolence seemed to creep off the brickwork with silent continuity, steadily streaming apprehension into the chests of its observers. Depravity slipped silkily from the slanted roof, pooling on the cold paving slabs in an imperceptible reservoir of shimmering darkness. The walls seemed impregnable, as if the secrets they held existed outside jurisdiction and law.
When he had finished, but had still had no reply from Sherlock, he sighed, sending another text. He got dressed in the bathroom, worry beginning to gnaw at his insides the longer Sherlock took to respond.
He nodded, slowly, as if unwilling to admit to it.
The  tear on the tattooed mans face is suggestive of him having killed someone (it's used among gang members, if I recall), and the five dots mean that he is a white supremacist - generally not a nice guy really.
“Maybe,” was his only response as Sherlock moved effortlessly around the table.
There is no answer. Of course there isn’t. It’s enough that John loses his tenuous grip on his morals and sweeps the unclean apparatus to the floor. It shatters with an unsatisfactory cascade of glass. As he stands among the crystalline shards that litter the floor, he listens to his ragged breathing and curses his housemate.
John groans as he stands, Sherlock can tell by the slight contortion of his motion, and a blink that last just a fraction too long as he turns back to Mycroft. Without being able to see John's face, he has no hope of knowing what he says, but Mycroft nods in agreement before standing.
And she flounced off towards the exit, slamming the doors behind her with a resounding
"Have a good drive?"
Meanwhile, Sherlock had finished cooking and was shoveling a generous amount of food onto John's plate. John had come back from Russia looking quite thin, and Sherlock was determined that John should eat plenty of healthy food for the next couple of weeks to gain back some of his lost weight.
.....
"Handcuffs...the bed...having my way with..."
"Oh, thanks." John carefully took the book from its shelf and went to sit at one of the tables, noting with quiet amusement the suspicious glare that Sherlock wasn't even bothering to hide behind the ridiculously large book he was holding in front of his face. It took a great deal of self restraint, but John managed to make it back to his seat without bursting into a fit of hysteric giggles. This was going much better than he thought it would.
"Have you forgotten about me, Sherlock?"
"I do," Sherlock admitted. "But I love you even more, John. That's why I've decided I can't do it anymore. It's putting you at risk and I can't bear the thought of losing you again. I've already told Greg my intentions to resign," he added as John opened his mouth. "My mind's made up, John. I'm not taking any more chances."
So Sherlock had decided to read bedtime stories to Artemis again, had he? John smirked with amusement. Tapping his knuckles softly on the door frame, he poked his head around the corner.
he thought.
"Yes, sir!"
"Mind if I join you two?" he said, grinning.
"Damn it, Discord! It's like I told you! I don't indulge in fantasies about him! Not now, not ever! I also never sneak looks at that tight little arse of his!"
"Oh," John answered, starting to feel uneasy. The way Mycroft's eyes were trained on his...he didn't like it. And it wasn't just Mycroft's eyes. John hadn't noticed before, but it suddenly occurred to him that the elevator seemed uncomfortably small, with only a couple feet separating himself and Mycroft. Then Mycroft turned to John and stepped nearer, causing John to quickly step back, immediately finding his back to the wall.
Molly nodded. "D'you think it'd be all right if I took this up to them?"
Sherlock smiled.
Sherlock turned off his phone, yawning, and placed it back on the coffee table. As he moved, John stirred again, and Sherlock felt a corresponding rush of affection. Once again he smoothed the hair back from John's face, and shut his eyes again. Within moments, he was asleep.
Sherlock has been giving you. You should know that you'll never mean anything to him though. You'll always be a
to go, Discord," she said sarcastically. "Now you've gone and upset him."
"John, you ready?" Sherlock called.
"Artemis may seem young and childish, but he's a prodigy. And Hunter's M.O. is his strong and silent disposition."
And so Twilight continued to go on and on about unicorn horns, not noticing that both John and Sherlock had long since stopped paying attention and were now locked in a silent staring contest. Sherlock, for his part, was feeling incredibly embarrassed and flustered at what John was implying, and John was practically squealing with glee on the inside about the reaction he was getting. Even so, John was careful not to let his emotions show on his face. It would ruin the fun, and besides, they'd only just started. So instead he flattened his ears against his skull looked at Sherlock with the purest, innocent smile he could muster and said "
Shocked and embarrassed, Irene could only stand there, miserable and sulky in her now totally drenched school clothes.
"What about me, Sherlock?" Artemis asked.
For a split second, both Sherlock and John were frozen in place. The next, they'd separated themselves from one another and had both hidden themselves from sight behind the large book shelves.
"Put this on!" They said, shoving a high school uniform at him.
Dead silence filled the room as everyone stared at the host club members. Everyone was staring at Sherlock, who had his arms placed protectively over John's shoulders.
John felt something in his heart twist. Clearly, Sherlock was still finding it hard to believe that John was back, that John was staying. John may have had a worse time of it, but it was obvious that Sherlock had suffered just as much if not more so when John had been taken away. Hell, Sherlock must have been absolutely terrified.
"Sherlock?" John said, now trying to hold back a giggle. "Are you all right?"
Then he noticed John approaching with a bag of groceries. "Speak of the devil, here he comes now!"
"There's a paragraph here that says unicorn horns are...
"Oh. Oh God. I'm so sorry."
"Sherlock?"
"Yep, you're a hero, all right!" the twins giggled.
"Yes."
As he sat down at the dinner table, John reached for the plate Sherlock had prepared for him and started eating the warm toast, occasionally taking sips of tea.
"Get out," Sherlock hissed. "I never want to see your face here, or anywhere on these school grounds ever again!"
"John! John, wake up! Wake up!"
In the meantime, Sherlock wasn't sure how much longer he could bear seeing John this way. He had to do something. Anything. Slowly, he inched closer along the couch. Once he was close enough, he reached out and tugged John onto his lap. John opened his eyes in surprise, but he made no objection. He sat in Sherlock's lap, Sherlock's arms around his middle. To Sherlock's relief, his shivering had subsided to the point where it was hardly noticeable.
For a while after that, things were quiet in the library again. John steadily searched the book's index until he found the chapter he was looking for:
John stood there for a long minute after she walked away.
"Hey John, want to share a piece of cake with me?" he said, grinning up into John's face.
"All right."
"Whatever you say, Sherlock," answered Mycroft as he walked away.
The question was so unexpected that it took a moment before Sherlock realized what John had said. He could feel the heat in his face and cursed himself mentally for doing something so embarrassing.
"Sherlock?" John mumbled sleepily.
John stared at him in disbelief, feeling a smile forming on his face.
all the attention that

is a word I'd use to describe, John, my dear."
"I recently heard that the host club is keeping a little
At this point John was fed up with this nonsense. "I'll go back and get something else," he grumbled. "
"John, what is it?" he said. "What's wrong?"
After getting lost several times, John found an empty music room. He sighed with relief.
.....
That afternoon, John discovered that his school bags and other possessions were missing. He soon found out why though, as, as he went to look out of one of the many large windows in the hallway, he saw them floating in a shallow pond on the school's grounds. It seemed that even in a school like this, there were people who weren't above stooping to such low forms of bullying. Running through the long halls to the exit, John noticed Irene standing alone by one window. He was already several feet from her when he heard her speak. This time, Irene didn't bother trying to keep the contempt from her voice.
"I-" Sherlock stammered. "E-Excuse me."
John tried to answer, but all that came out was a weak groan.
John smiled. "So am I."
John started at the stuffed animal. After a few seconds he said "Sure. I mean he is rather cute."
"Um," John said awkwardly. He didn't want Sherlock to know his suspicions about Irene, so he said "I guess I must have dropped them out a window by accident."
He heard himself moan and pushed his hips up closer against the weight of John, whimpering, desperate for friction against his trapped erection.
"I never would have imagined that our famous scholar...would be so openly
"So John, what do you like to do?"
"You heard him, Discord!" Twilight said coldly. "Put him down.
he thought.
"All this is for me?" he said, staring at his plate.
By this time quite a crowd was gathering around Sherlock and John. All marveling that such a thing as instant coffee even existed.
"So you like bondage do you?"
"You saved my life in Russia," Mycroft said. "I've never had the chance to express my gratitude."
A little while later, John was in one of the changing rooms, slowly drying his hair with one of the soft white towels the twins had brought.
If Sherlock had been drinking tea, there was a high probability that he would have spat it out in shock. His eyes narrowed, and he glared silently at John. What on earth was he up to?
Oh...
"Yeah! I'd appreciate that, thanks!" John answered with a smile.
"Good riddance," muttered the twins.
Sherlock sat down carefully on the couch, wincing slightly at the pressure put on his bruises. John sat next to him, a blanket wrapped around his shoulders. He sat with his knees drawn up to his chest, shivering. But Sherlock understood. Ever since his return from Russia, John had been acutely sensitive to any drop in temperature. The result was that even with the thick wool blanket he'd wrapped around himself, he was still chilled. It would be months before he readjusted to London's weather.
Cold silence filled the whole room. Twilight took a deep breath, and exhaled softly despite the anger that was going through her. Apple Jack, as ever, wasted no time in scolding the lord of chaos.
Quickly, he climbed off the bed and crouched beside John. Then, placing his hands firmly on John's arms to keep him from struggling anymore, he spoke.
He hadn't wanted to believe it at first, but he now knew beyond a shadow of doubt what was happening.
"Mycroft, call our hair stylist, now!" Sherlock barked. "Hunter, go to the eye doctor and get him some contact lenses!"
"I think that's enough of me being a tease, hmm?" Sherlock said. "How about I help you out with this problem?"
"Yeah, do you have any hobbies?"
Sherlock laughed. "Of course not."
Sherlock closed his eyes, savoring the taste of John's lips on his, the warm weight of John's body pressing hungrily against him.
"I'm curious: what products do you use on your skin? It's flawless!"
His mind made up, John was about to speak when Sherlock stood up. He moved towards John, stopping in front of him. What startled John- what made his chest tighten -was the look on Sherlock's face. He couldn't remember a time when Sherlock had looked so somber; like a terrible weight rested on him as he knelt in front of John. Instinctively John put his arms around Sherlock's shoulders as Sherlock embraced him, offering comfort. After a few seconds of silence, Sherlock spoke.
"Wait a minute, I've heard of this stuff before!" exclaimed Sherlock. "
. A little water never harmed anything, John. Don't make such a fuss!" Bending down, he plucked John's wallet from the pond. "Ah, here we are! Is this what you were looking for?" Then, noticing John's blank stare he said, "What's wrong, you're staring into space. Not falling for me, are you?" he added mischievously.
However, what surprised Sherlock the most was the fact Sherlock was not only cooking, but that he had so far managed to keep everything from burning. It was absolutely astonishing.
John thought, feeling his blood boil.
"H-How did you know my name?" he said.
"So," he said menacingly, his cold rage filling the room. "You think you can get away with bullying John without us looking; you call me an idiot behind my back; and now you tried to blind our new host with hot tea when he calmly stated the obvious sin you've committed?"
Meanwhile, Mycroft had plucked one of the shards of the vase off the floor  and was looking at it carefully.
"You're quite welcome, John," Sherlock said, taking a sip from his own cup.
"I love you," Sherlock repeated again. "I love you I love you I love you."
"Yes," Mycroft was saying. "Welcome to the Ouran Host Club, Mr. Honor Student."
Without another word, Sherlock entered the room. John could hardly summon the energy to open his eyes, but he didn't have to to be aware of Sherlock's sudden acute concern for him.
In the few seconds that Sherlock stood before him, John saw too many emotions cross Sherlock's face - horror, confusion, and then finally, terrible heart-wrenching clarity dawned on Sherlock's face and he pressed a hand to his mouth, absolutely mortified.
The revelation was so shocking that for once, Sherlock Holmes was at a complete loss for words.
"That's better now, isn't it?" he said quietly.
"Well that's obvious," Irene answered. "You've been keeping a close eye on him, haven't you?"
"I think you guys are taking this 'poor' thing way too far," John mumbled.
"My, Sherlock. Already on a first name basis, are we?"
John hated the feeling. It made him feel weak. Yet he couldn't bring himself to push Artemis away. Instead he stood there, awkward, unsure of himself, feeling terribly exposed while Artemis held on to him, the smaller blond boy supporting the older and taller one as John stared at the other host club members, painfully aware of how unsteady his legs were feeling as Artemis spoke to him.
In the weeks following John's return, a change had come over Sherlock. For starters, he had devoted an extraordinary amount of time to looking after John, even going as far as serving him meals in bed. While the change was pleasant and John enjoyed it all, (Sherlock was an amazing cook) he couldn't shake the feeling that Sherlock was keeping something from him. Whatever it was, John knew that it was affecting Sherlock deeply. There had been several times now when he'd caught Sherlock looking at him when he thought John wouldn't notice. Come to think of it, he'd hardly let John out of his sight since the day he'd come home.
Sitting up, John could hear sounds in the kitchen that meant Sherlock was busy preparing breakfast. Stifling a yawn, John pulled on his shirt and trousers and then walked into the kitchen, his pace quickened by the slight chill in the air and the delicious aroma that was currently wafting from the kitchen.
"Sorry for that, Sherlock," John said quickly. "But you did manage to strike a small chord."
While John sat quietly eating, Sherlock remained sitting beside him. He was relieved that John was still able to consume solid food without much trouble, but he felt he should stick close by just in case.
John nodded silently. His eyes were closed again, and he seemed to be relaxing in the warmth of Sherlock's body. Carefully, Sherlock turned until they were lying along the length of the couch. John made a soft noise of appreciation, and mere moments later he was asleep.
He was still finding it hard to believe that John was really back. Even though it had been almost a week since John's return, Sherlock still couldn't shake off the nagging worry in the back of his mind that he'd one day wake up to find John had disappeared again, this time forever. It was a truly terrifying thought, but he was slowly learning that such a thing would never happen, that John was never going to be taken away again.
To a stranger, Sherlock's face would have appeared devoid of any hostility. But neither Mycroft or John had the luxury of such ignorance. They knew what lurked under the mask of polite interest on Sherlock's face: a seething mixture of suspicion and anger, both of which were solely aimed at Mycroft. Only a fool would dare try and provoke him now.
have a chance to spend time with him. Although John was flustered and rather flattered by their reactions, he was having trouble trying to come up with the right things to say as the girls peppered him with questions.
"He recovered pretty fast that time," Jay remarked to his brother. "Anyway, boss you can teach him all you like."
!" he shrieked, completely forgetting for a moment that they were in a room full of people. "
John shut his eyes, wishing that the elevator would stop and open its doors soon.
After a rather awkward pause, Mrs. Hudson returned to the present.
Later, John found himself watching a group of girls fawning of Artemis and how adorable he was.
He never finished his sentence. The entire host club was glaring daggers at him.
Meanwhile, the twins had arrived in the changing room with John.
"Who the Hell
"Never mind," Sherlock said. "It doesn't matter. I'm just glad you're back."
"Um-"
"And you actually made Sherlock retrieve your wallet for you, how astonishing!" Irene mused. "You do realize that he's a first class citizen and not some commoner who serves people, right? The only reason he pays any attention to you at all is because he's trying to make a proper gentleman out of you. Don't think he cares about you just because he's being lavish with his attention."
school, Mr. Watson!"
"Sherlock. What is it?"
Sherlock smiled at both of them. Once Artemis was happily settled in John's lap, he said "All right, shall I start now?"
Behind the bookshelf, John let out a sigh of relief.
"I can't believe she actually tried to throw her tea in your face like that," Sherlock said, absentmindedly stroking John's hair. "You could have really been hurt."
Truth be told though, John was enjoying himself more than he was letting on. There was something comforting about the way Sherlock was acting towards him- it was certainly a welcome change to his over-the-top affection.
"Charmed," Irene said coldly.
After a few more minutes of thinking carefully on the matter, John decided that there was nothing for it. He was going to ask Sherlock what was wrong, regardless of whatever his answer might be.
"Yes, please!" Artemis said, hugging his stuffed bunny to his chest.
Out of the corner of his eye, John saw Sherlock give a subtle nod.
"We'll get some towels!" the twins volunteered.
As he carried both of their plates to the table, Sherlock was satisfied when he saw that John had quickly finished his two pieces of toast. John for his part looked astonished when he saw how much food Sherlock had given him.
"Nothing that you need to worry about!" Sherlock answered. To change the subject he said "I think a fair amount of the water from those pitchers got you too."
Sherlock held up a hand. "No. That won't be necessary, John. I'll drink it." Then, holding the instant coffee aloft he declared, "I will drink this coffee to the last drop!"
"Oh, sorry!" Artemis said. He quickly did as John said and went to stand by Hunter again.
Sherlock grinned. "John, I'd like to introduce you to someone. This is my regular guest, Irene Adler."
"Marry me, John."
While Irene's tone betrayed no hint of hostility, Sherlock could feel the irritation radiating from her.
she mused.
"I see, so you've been living with your aunt and uncle since both your parents are dead. That must have been very hard for you."
"Excuse me, Twilight?"
"Dunno. Surprise me," John called back.
John quickly stepped back from Sherlock, feeling his face turn red with embarrassment. Unfortunately, in his haste to get away he overbalanced and fell backward, upsetting the carved wooden end table with an exquisite renaissance vase placed atop it. Realizing his fatal error a second too late, John made a grab for it, but it slipped through his fingers and shattered upon the floor. Cold horror engulfed John as he leaned over the end table, staring at the mess of shards. Within a few minutes, things had gone from a bit not good to a complete disaster.
"ALL RIGHT FINE, YOU WIN!" he shouted, his face burning. "YES, I DO HAVE EROTIC FANTASIES ABOUT YOU! I HAVE SINCE I MET YOU! NOW PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD JOHN, JUST-"
But he didn't want to be rude, so he muttered, "Gee. Thanks."
Late one evening after John had come home from the hospital, he was making his way up the stairs when he heard voices coming from Artemis's bedroom. Smiling to himself, he moved closer to listen in.
It was late into a rainy night in the middle of November when Sherlock suddenly found himself wide awake in bed. For a split second he lay there confused, before realizing that the reason for his rude awakening was the fact that the duvet that once covered him was gone and that he could hear a series of panicked whimpers coming from the floor on the right side of the bed. In an instant he was wide awake, scrambling to the other side of the bed and looking over the side.
she thought.
By now, the sense of de ja vu and confusion had become too much for poor John.
Sherlock appeared not to have heard him. "Spurned, neglected! But it doesn't matter now. Long live the poor!" he declared. "We welcome you, poor man, to our world of
"What is this world even coming to?" John muttered with bemusement.
"Of course you're not!" said the twins, each slapping John on the back. "You're in denial!"
At the mention of this, John froze. Slowly, he peered over his shoulder at the host club members.
With that Molly hastily left the building, her cheeks still flushed with color as she stepped out onto the street.
?" they repeated.
Raising his voice slightly, Sherlock called out, "John! Would you come over here for a minute, please?"
To a chorus of concerned questions and anxious looks, all the young women who were present quickly left.
"What you said before with Discord," John prompted, his eyes now fixed on Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock could feel one of John's hooves on his left thigh now; the movements of it were slow and teasing, making Sherlock bite his tongue in an attempt to ignore the sensation. "You denied having erotic fantasies about me involving bondage. So what I want to know is..." Sherlock could feel the heat of John's lips against his neck; mouthing at the skin with each word. "Do you really? Or were you actually telling the truth?" When Sherlock didn't immediately respond, he chuckled. "I know, I know. It's not easy to answer questions when someone's in your personal space now is it?"
"What's with that grubby outfit you've got on, anyway?" said Jay.
"All right, if you insist," John said with a slight laugh.
And the look in his eyes- oh God the look in his eyes. Sherlock found himself frozen, unable to move or look away as his heart beat frantically against his chest, never imagining that having John this close would be so erotic.
"Should I ask the guests to leave?"  Mycroft asked.
Sherlock seemed to notice John's astonishment. Without looking up from what he was doing, he smiled and said "There's tea and toast for you at the table. You'd best get to it before it gets cold."
"I'm sorry," he said. "I meant to say our errand boy. Oh, and if you have any thoughts of running away, you should know that my family employs a private police force of one hundred officers. Also," he added casually. "You don't happen to have a passport, do you?"
Following the incident, no one could have predicted what was to take place over the next few days. Things carried on as usual, though there was now definitely a tangible feeling of awkwardness each time that Sherlock and John were in the same room together. They mostly communicated now in monotonous sentences or by simple nods of acknowledgement. Rather than step in and attempt to help fix the problem as she normally would have, Twilight instead wisely took a back seat to the current dilemma and advised her friends not to try and pressure John or Sherlock into addressing the problem for fear of escalating an already dreadfully awkward situation. Little did they know, however, that John had already begun quietly concocting a most devious scheme to get to the bottom of how Sherlock truly felt about him.
"What happened? How did your things end up in the pond?"
This statement was followed up by all the female guests staring curiously at John. "It's
"I hate to break up this lovely interaction," Mycroft said. "But we still need to-"
It's okay, you can do this! he thought.
"So, are you guys sure that it's okay for me to keep this uniform?" he said.
with us," Mycroft went on with a now slightly threatening tone of voice, "You will act as the Ouran Club's dog until you graduate!"
"Uh...yeah. I guess..." Molly muttered.
"Sheesh!" the twins said. "What made
He had to do something, fast.
John was cut off abruptly as John ran over to him, shoving the twins aside with an awe-struck expression.
Grimacing from his headache, John murmured his thanks before quickly downing the medicine first. It tasted horrible, but as a doctor he knew better than anyone that it was a vital part in becoming well again. Besides, he'd soon be rid of the terrible after-taste thanks to the nice breakfast Sherlock had made for him. He was particularly glad for the orange, as a helping of Vitamin C would certainly help his immune system recover sooner.
John kissed Sherlock, his mouth moving against the unicorn's with hunger and determination while he simultaneously pulled himself up onto Sherlock's lap, his legs now straddling Sherlock's; pressing Sherlock back against the chair with the force of his mouth, his hooves cradling Sherlock's neck.
John knew better than to argue with him.
Standing before him were six boys. Even though John had never seen them before, there was an unshakable feeling of de ja vu that had stolen over him.
After a moment's pause, John heard Artemis answer. "I want to know what happens to Bilbo after he goes into the dragon's lair."
He was just standing in front of the mirror, not thinking of anything in particular, when the sound of Sherlock's voice and the curtain being pulled back made him turn around in a panic.
"Thank you."
"No!" Sherlock and John answered at the same time. John was grinning broadly as he said it, but Sherlock looked as though he were ready to collapse.
"OH MY CELESTIA!" Pinkie yelled. "HE'S
"Right. I think I'll just hang on to that present for you then," she said. "I'll make sure they get it after things have calmed down."
Then he was gone, the curtain sliding closed just as quickly as it had been opened.
"Oh, not at all," he said. "I do apologize, Irene. Forgive me, I'm just a bit concerned about our John."
"You don't have any proof that I did anything!" Irene snarled. "Your accusations are based on nothing but emotions and conjecture! Yes, my father will be upset when he hears these baseless accusations!"
.....
"Nothing," Sherlock answered with what he hoped was a reassuring smile. "Don't worry about me." Noticing John's now empty plate and cup, he took them and stood up. "Try to get some rest now. I'll let you know when lunch is ready."
And so Sherlock went on and on, oblivious to the fact John had stopped paying attention altogether. There's a word used for pricks like him, John thought to himself. What was it? It's something really specific. Then, as Sherlock came striding back over to him, John gave a shout.
John frowned. It was unlike Sherlock to leave the flat early in the morning without telling him. Of course there was always the possibility that he had found an interesting case in his inbox and snuck out without him noticing, but this was unlikely; Sherlock was as loud as an elephant around the confined space of the flat, unable to hear or censor the noises he made as he moved around.
Question: What can you take from a broken man?
For a second the two look at Sherlock, curled into himself in the chair. Just for a fraction of a second Sherlock hates them both, the pity he can feel radiating off them in waves. He want to scream, shout at them, tell them to just fuck off with their condolences and sadness. He wants to, but he lacks the energy. As John moves into the kitchen the two brothers are left.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock lay there on the floor, and let everything he knew pour out of his eyes in clear sadness, running over the contours of his face, to embed themselves in the grain of the wooden floor. The flat ached with a long gone presence, one that had become the very backbone of the flat. And now it was as if it had still been here, captured in the walls, ground into the fibres of the rug. But now it had been torn out, and Sherlock screamed with the loss of it, the very essence of his being bleeding out onto the floor.
Sherlock didn’t move for a moment. “What type?”
UPDATED TAGS/WARNINGS
John shakes his head. “He bloody deleted the picture, didn’t he?”
The rock of the taxi as it brakes to a stop opposite an alleyway is enough to cause the two men to look around. Sherlock tugs the door open and swings himself out, leaving the beautifully damned man behind him to pay the fare. He gulps the cold air like a parched man at an oasis, letting the current of the wind drag him out of what could have been, into what is. The feel of harsh concrete beneath the soles of well loved leather and the knowledge of the chase, being one step ahead, grounds him, tethering him to the fixed point of crime. And then there was a presence at his side, and suddenly the plethora of potentially incriminating evidence, DNA and fingerprints, was a secondary necessity.
“You alright?” he asked, ever the doctor.
Mycroft looks back at him with what resembled pity in his eyes. “Go and have a shower,” he offers him the briefcase that he brought in, two days ago now, “get yourself clean and get changed. You can’t do anything for him right now.”
“It’s not that simple,” John replied, as Lestrade sighed.
Sherlock smirked. “Exactly. Meaning whoever it was came prepared. Or had an accomplice who came later.” He paused for a second, pulling out his phone and texting Lestrade to check the CCTV. “Kitchen.” He decided, already moving and trusting John to follow, loyal soldier that he was.
He didn’t respond, simply stared resolutely down at his phone, his face unreadable. The three of them stood and sat in a pregnant silence, waiting. For what, none of them knew exactly. A sign, perhaps? Anything that whispered hope and security, promising a safe return.
He looks up to see that Sherlock is closer than he thought, and he twitches back. “No.”
The elder Holmes brother interrupted the silence that threatened to overwhelm the room. Lestrade paused the screen, as his finger reached out to hover above the screen. He pointed at a non-descript taxi cab, blurred in motion on the screen, only the silhouette visible in the light of the streetlamps.
He looked up to see blue eyes meet his own.
It’s true. John knows it is. With Sherlock unconscious, he won’t even notice if John leaves. It’s only for ten minutes anyway, he reasons. And he probably does smell. Not to mention the blood that stains his sleeves and front. It’s best to go now, before Sherlock is awake to notice his absence.
Less foolish, more downright stupid. “Well then let’s go.”
“Why?”
“He’s hurt.”
“Sherlock?” John’s voice interrupted his inner monologue.
Unperturbed by his lack of response, the man grinned a feral smile, and turned to pick up a length of chain that lay on a table nearby. Sherlock took the moment to look around his confinement.
John smiled softly. “Sure. Let me brush my teeth and I’ll be right up.”
It was a message from Lestrade. A seemingly impossible murder in the victim’s own house. It took less than a second to make the decision to go. It was a distraction if nothing else, and it sounded interesting. Or at least Lestrade had phrased it so that it sounded interesting. Grabbing his jacket and shoes, Sherlock shrugged on the warmth of his Belstaff and shut the door behind him, leaving it unlocked for Mrs Hudson.
Mycroft said nothing, just watched as Sherlock tried to accommodate the knowledge that perhaps, just maybe, the woman who had raised him wasn’t nearly as indestructible as his childhood had allowed him to imagine.
Such was the case with Sherlock Holmes. He needed John Watson, like a believer needs their god. An alternative pathway, a catalyst per say. A way to breathe. A
There was a gathering of policemen moving throughout the room, gathering the utensils that had caused so much pain only hours previously. There was no sign of two of the men, but the third lay behind Mycroft, dumped unfeelingly on the floor, a bullet wound through his head. Too disorientated to make much sense of what he saw, Sherlock closed his eyes, reaching out blindly for his brother with his free hand.
The three men that stood in front of Sherlock were broad, with scars littering their skin, which was displayed, as they wore nothing from the waist up. They were all ropey with muscle, and were not above showing it off in an attempt to scare their captive into subjugation. The one that stood in front of Sherlock currently was looming over him, a section of pipe clutched in his hand. He was speaking, Sherlock presumed, from the way his mouth was moving. His face was turning red from the vigour of it, and every so often, spittle would fly from his lips. With a scar running across the length of his neck, and a nose that looked like it had been broken one too many times, he cut an imposing figure; one that was clearly not used to getting no response from his playthings.
