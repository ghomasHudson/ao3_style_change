"There," John announced, settling back with a satisfied sigh.  "That's better," he continued, reaching up and threading the fingers of one hand through Sherlock's curls and urging Sherlock's head downward.  "Now where were we?" John purred rhetorically as he brushed his lips gently against Sherlock's in a portent of what was to come.
"Jesus, Billy," John swore, shaking his head in exasperation.  "If that's your only problem, I'm more than happy to help!"
“Billy, Billy—oh God, that feels amazing—but, but we can’t, remember?  I don’t have any…
"None of the above," Sherlock informed him, still searching the sea of blue chambray, sequins, feathers, pink t-shirts, and white button-downs for yellow garments that might indicate their unknown watcher.  "I want a fizzy lemonade and then I want to see where the bulls for competition are kept."
Devil's Blaze blew out a final, deep breath, only to jerk his head up as Sherlock took a half-step towards the horse, keeping his posture loose and once again keeping his body at an angle towards the horse, rather than approaching him head on.  It was less threatening that way.  Horses were prey animals: a tense, frightened or angry human approaching quickly instinctively meant 'predator' and 'danger,' to the horse, while a relaxed human approaching from the side meant just the opposite.  In front of him, Devil's Blaze shifted his feet, his hooves kicking up little clouds of dust that were easily blown away by the soft breeze, but he didn't run.
Candii's pace didn't change as she led Sherlock through a set of extra wide double doors and down a short flight of stairs.  Sherlock refused to let the burning ache in his feet manifest on his face as he followed Candii across the yard, around a large barn to a set of distant structures.
"It's a mistake to theorize before one has all the data," Sherlock informed Donovan brusquely.  "Invariably it results in twisting facts to suit theories, instead of developing theories to suit facts.  That being said," Sherlock continued, "in my experience, horses very rarely go 'mad' without a good reason…and that Candi Ross's suspicion of an unprescribed chemical agent being given to her horse is not entirely unreasonable, though I do not believe she is the culprit.  Are you familiar with the name Brenda Tregennis?"
John was standing outside of the bar's front door, his hands resting on his belt, clearly waiting for something (or someone).  The fact that John had apparently arrived slightly early was a positive sign; it signaled both excitement and anticipation.
Consequently, he'd spent several hours the night before last researching individual standings and how they came to be, in his bunk by the light of his mobile.  The rodeo's rise in commercial popularity had coincided with the reduction in the number of working cowboys.  At the same time, the increasingly lucrative nature of competitions had also resulted in an influx of competitors who worked occupations other than that of 'cowhand,' occupations that didn't allow competitors the time to travel several hundred miles a week for competition.  In deference to the changing nature of the sport, in 1975, the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association had introduced the concept of regional 'circuits' in 1975 by dividing their enormous country up into smaller segments.  The objective being that competitors who worked 9-5 'banker's hours' could select a 'home' circuit to compete in, (thus lessening the amount of travel required) yet still be eligible for the bigger competitions.  There were still some die-hard competitors who were willing (and able) to criss-cross the United States, but most preferred to stay within one of the twelve geographic regions.
"That's good."
Sherlock rolled his eyes in disgust at Brenda's lack of recall.  "What about people?" he demanded.  "Other competitors?  Event employees?"
Hunter contradicted himself repeatedly, arguing that he'd only had two or three beers and never drank whiskey, despite the damning DNA evidence on the empty bottle beside him that proved otherwise.  According to Hunter, the last thing he remembered was standing outside, smoking, and hearing raised male voices through the tinhorn walls of the building he was leaning against.  He had no idea how he'd ended up in a horse stall in the Bill Cody building with a large knot on the back of his skull.
"Never mind," Sherlock interrupted, placing a possessive hand on the small of John's back.  "It appears that the queue is starting to form for dinner.  Let's find our seats.  We can catch up with Molly afterwards.
Old Wayne snorted in response.  "Oh hell no.  He was some sort of fancy biology major.  She told me they met in a lab…classroom romance."
"Pygophilia," Sherlock mumbled, rubbing his cheek against John's chest the same way a cat would rub their chin or jaw along something to declare 'MINE!'  John smelled wonderful: a bit like sweat, a bit like Sherlock and a lot like sex.
Sherlock surprised himself by bursting into a snort of laughter.  "So where are you from originally, if you're not a native Texan?"
Sherlock hesitated, the call of the Work battling with the lure of John’s proximity and the other man’s hopeful expression. After a moment he shrugged, giving in to temptation. "Very well. That sounds acceptable.“
Sherlock raised his left eyebrow, communicating silently how idiotic he found John's suggestion.  John did not seem fazed.
"Talk?" Sherlock repeated.  He didn't care if the repetition made him sound inane; he was more than a little irked that his brilliant plan to shove John against the nearest vertical surface and snog him within an inch of his life was being thwarted.
"What's your point?"
John's huff was bitter.  "Chance would be a fine thing.  I talked to Clara—"
Sherlock waited patiently on his knees, enjoying the sight of the blond vet leaning against the barn wall flushed and utterly wrecked because of him. Smirking, he ran his palms up and down John’s legs in a repetitive motion, pleasing himself with the texture of John’s warm skin. Short sparse hairs tickled his palms, adding to his enjoyment.
There was a frantic babble of speech from the handset,
The change in position put John's head slightly above Sherlock's which, in itself, was something of a novelty.  Sherlock looked up and blinked, curious about what John would do next.  His question was answered when John reached over to pluck Sherlock's hat from his head.
"Yeah, I can see that," John replied, studying Sherlock's face critically.  "It looks like you're starting to burn a bit on your nose and cheeks, despite your hat.  Have you applied sunblock recently?"
Sherlock ordered his brother's unhelpful projection.  "She sounds like a good person," Sherlock said aloud instead, hoping to integrate himself back into John's good graces.
"You can start by grabbing the water," John ordered with a grunt, pausing briefly to indicate the camo-patterned Camelbak water carrier sitting on the ground a few feet away before returning his focus to pulling on his chaps and buckling them into place.
"Why do you say that?"
"Mom got me started, but I stuck with it because it's fun," Brenda explained, warming up to the topic and beginning to lecture Donovan on the history of the event and her mother's prowess.  Brenda's face grew more animated the longer she spoke, visibly relaxing in response to Donovan's gentle encouragement and open-ended questions.
Sherlock stared down at the screen with a faint expression of horror...before an evil thought crossed his mind, which had him pulling out his own phone and opening a browser.
There was another pause and Sherlock imagined Donovan was probably cursing him for taking her previously-assumed tidy case and contorting it into a Byzantine plot with his abrupt revelation.
Sherlock shook his head.  "I don't like hard things that have the potential to cut my gums or soft palate."
Dusting himself off, the clown walked back over to the horse and dropped to his knees beside its head, both hands clasped together in a symbol of desperate entreaty.  The horse shook its mane and rolled back up onto its belly.  After miming his thanks, the clown walked back around and slung a leg over the horse’s barrel.  The moment he was situated, though, the gelding pushed itself up on its forelegs but kept its hind legs folded underneath it.  The result was a living slide that the clown slid down landing on his bum.  Both remained frozen in their respective positions, before the horse turned its head back towards the clown and let out another loud whinny.
Sherlock retrieved his bags from where he'd left them beside the front door and spent a few tedious minutes unpacking.  His toiletries, including his hair product, went into the bathroom, while his shirts, jeans, socks, and pants all went into the closet.  After a moment's deliberation, Sherlock opted to leave his chemicals and lab equipment in his locked suitcase.  It wouldn't do for them to be inadvertently discovered by the housekeeper.
At the sound of his name, John turned, his previously-doleful look melting away to a blinding smile.  "Billy!  You came back!  I wasn't sure you would."  John stood up and politely pulled Sherlock's chair back out.  It was a surprisingly old-fashioned and upper-class gesture.  It wouldn't have looked out-of-place among Mycroft's set, but it seemed odd that John would do it so naturally.
"Good!" John yelled.  "Hold him, I'm going in!"
"He has, the shifty-eyed bunco," Candii said with a disgusted grimace.  "Edith reported as much to me.  And just as well for you that you didn't take him up on it."
At Sherlock's expression of interest, Candii shrugged.  "They're ridden differently.  The injuries they might get are different.  Most horses ain't gonna knock themselves out by crashin' headfirst into a metal gate, but it happens with buckers.  Same thing with bulls.  Most bulls, if they get injured, they gonna get et.  A high-caliber bucking bull like Spinal Tap or Bushwacker's gonna get thousands of dollars in medical care."
Sherlock rolled his eyes in disgust.  Investigations would move so much quicker if the authorities took his word as gospel, rather than demanding tedious explanations.  He quickly composed a reply to Donovan and hit 'send'.
"Yep.  Turns out we had the same crazy drill instructor in Basic.  Watch your step—fresh pidgeon shit's slippery stuff.  I'd hate to have a replay of our first meeting."
In a moment of foresight, he thought to grab one of his damp towels off the bathroom floor before striding back into the bedroom, where he let the towel drop carelessly on the floor beside the bed.  Having a towel on hand would make cleanup easier and it meant he wouldn't have to leave the bed afterward.  Unscrewing the cap again, Sherlock poured a generous puddle into palm of his left hand before grimacing in realization at the problematic logistics.  It was difficult enough to open a lid one-handed, never mind closing it.  Eventually he gave up and used his legs to hold the bottle in place so he could rescrew the cap closed.  The sensation of cool glass between his hot thighs made goosebumps erupt across his bare skin, which had the perverse effect of heightening his arousal.
"Afternoon," the man drawled, tipping his hat politely as he strolled out into the light, like there was nothing at all suspicious about being caught lurking.  "Didn't mean to startle you, I was just enjoying my break.  I don't think we've met, but I know I've seen you around.  You a new Triple C employee?"
"You phrased it that way on purpose," Sherlock accused him with a mock glower.
"Thoroughbreds and other riding horses," Sherlock replied immediately, sticking to the truth, if not the truth in its entirety.  “I've also done quite a bit of work with performance animals...dressage stallions, show jumpers and the like."
He was still cataloging different injuries when Mike wandered back over.
Sherlock had raised an eyebrow at that, silently inviting Molly to continue.  Molly had been the second, no, third person who'd remarked about Harry Watson's less-than-stellar character traits.  Donovan had identified Harry Watson as an alcoholic with a criminal record, and John himself had muttered something vague about his sister being 'difficult' at the clinic.  He'd been curious to see how Molly would describe the vet's sister.  Perhaps it would offer additional insights into John Watson's financial concerns.
Solider training or no, he was going to need help on this one.
“Feet hurt,” John explained. “Feels good to be off them, and if you sit down in the dirt here, you run the risk of getting goat heads or cactus spines in your ass, and then you have to drop trou and pull them out.”
"On the contrary," Sherlock replied, returning John's hesitant smile with one of his own.  "I'd love to see your place and the idea of spending time together in private sounds very appealing.  Perhaps we could watch a movie on the sofa?"
"You might get an emergency call and not have a chance to drive me back," Sherlock countered, thinking of his plans for later that night.  Depending on the dosage used, it might take John hours to wake up.  "I prefer to work with Devil's Blaze in the morning when it's cooler, but that means you would have to wake up extra early to drive me back in time.  If I take my own truck, I can drive back and you can sleep in."
The push for more exciting animals was nothing new.  Sometime during the 1920s, a show business-savvy individual had decided to introduce Brahman bulls into bull riding competitions.  The subsequent popularity of Brahman bulls had not only resulted in more exciting bull rides, it had also resulted in far more risk to the cowboys.  Brahman bulls were far more ferocious than the bulls, cows, and steers that had been previously used.  They could and would attack anything in their way, whether it was a cowboy on horseback attempting to corral the bull through the exit gate, or an injured rider lying helpless on the ground.
Sherlock replied, sitting back up and wiping his eyes.
"That's hyperbole, John, and you know it," Sherlock scolded.  "Animals do not possess a capacity for the human ideological concepts of 'good' and 'evil'...my elder sibling's opinion on cats notwithstanding.  Physically?  Devil's Blaze's  injuries are mostly healed from what I can determine.  There will always be some scarring, but there is no indication that he's still experiencing physical pain.  Mentally is a different matter.  I'm still working on getting him to trust me.  Speaking of, I need to get him some water and walk him out."
"Um...well...okay," Molly said slowly as if she weren't quite sure Sherlock's statement was genuine.
"Yes?" Sherlock replied, his voice ending on an upward pitch, voicing his unspoken question.  He was careful to keep his expression puzzled, giving no evidence that he knew the man's identity.  Simpson obviously wanted something, but was leery of being noticed.  'Playing dumb' was a tried and true method for uncovering an individual's ulterior motives.
"You said you speak Latin, right?"
"Please," Sherlock said, holding himself obediently still as John leaned across the table and brushed gentle fingers across his cheekbones, wiping the excess lotion away.  Sherlock swallowed hard.  His already-warm skin felt like it was on fire.  This close, he could smell the intoxicating blend of John's cologne and clean sweat.  It was a heady combination, bringing to mind his fantasy several weeks ago.
"Fair enough," John conceded Sherlock's point.  "So...what...kinds of insects did you use?"
"Only when she surprises me by barging in without warning at the ungodly hour of eleven," Sherlock complained as he experimentally bent over to test how the chaps moved.  He flicked a stray piece of dried grass off of one boot and stood back up.
Like racing purses, rodeo purses were made up of a combination of entry fees from the competitors and added money from sponsors.  A portion of the purse was automatically set side for the rodeo itself, with the rest being paid out.  Like jockeys, rodeo contestants could either earn money by winning an event outright, or by placing high enough.  Unlikely jockeys, however, the percentages could change depending on the number of entrants
, Sherlock mused, considering that they were in a new environment, but still, it troubled him.  "I thought Molly said Ms. Ross's horses led as nicely as anything and were desensitized to rodeos," Sherlock complained to Alice Turner as she obligingly opened the gate for him.
"I know that," John shot back, scrambling back over the broken gate and lunging for his kit.  "I'm gonna hit him with twenty milligrams of Ace—oh, sorry Greg," John apologized as Greg didn't move out of the way quite fast enough and John bumped into him.
John's lips quirked.  "I've never been called that before, but thanks.  Speaking of exquisite though…" John reached out to flick a finger against one of the buttons of Sherlock's shirt.  "Now you."  Without waiting for an answer, John ducked his head to concentrate, his tongue peeking out slightly between his lips.  It made sense—the shirt was tight enough to be straining slightly across Sherlock's chest, and because it was brand-new, the button holes hadn't yet been broken in.
Sherlock shifted, bringing his leg into firmer contact with John's.  "You grew up poor, I take it?"  Immediately Sherlock wanted to bite his tongue at the insensitive remark; positive that John would take offense and leave.  Instead John surprised him by moving even closer.
"Great.  Grab your cue and I'll get the balls."
"Not at all.  I'm always glad to help a colleague out.  What can you tell me about Colonel?  Doctor Watson gave me the basic details, but I'd like to hear it from you."
"Let me see your files," Sherlock indicated the large manilla folder lying closest to Donovan's phone.  "I'll show you."
"No, not that I saw at least."
John's forehead crinkled in confusion.  "How can you tell?"
"I still can't believe you didn't already own a pair of chaps," John commented, ignoring the crowd in favor of tipping his head to one side and then the other to better admire Sherlock's arse.
Sherlock bristled as he watched the first brunette move into John's personal space.  Her ample cleavage clearly on display in the mostly-unbuttoned, short-sleeved plaid shirt she wore.
"What about it?" John asked, not looking up from the syringe he was filing.
"Perhaps," Sherlock answered vaguely.  It would provide him with an opportunity to observe the staff in a slightly different environment.  There was also the possibility that somebody might let something slip.
"What?  Help me make an arse of myself?" Sherlock asked tartly.
A short man, in a black suit and a brown pork-pie hat—most likely a clown of some sort based on the preceding laughter, was standing in the middle arena beside the handsome black hose he’d led in.  He was apparently trying to mount it—something Sherlock failed to understand why the audience was laughing, until he saw the man one again try and put his foot in the stirrup, only for the strap to stretch all the way down to the ground.  When it retracted it appeared to hit the man in the face and he fell backwards in a dramatic deadfall.  The horse stepped forward and snuffled the man’s face, causing the audience to respond with laughter and calls of “gross!!!! It’s kissing him!”<
"Yes," Sherlock admitted.  He wasn't, not really, but perhaps agreeing would pacify his host.  Sherlock watched John put the violin case away in its drawer with a pang of regret.  Perhaps later he could convince John to let him play.  He followed John into the kitchen nook and began unpacking the to-go boxes while John busied himself with clearing off the small table.  The papers vanished into a locked drawer while the pens ended up in a jar on top of the entertainment center.
"Wheat.  I'll be there in five minutes."  Sherlock hung up his phone with a decided click and tucked it into the front pocket of his jeans to finish getting ready.
"I asked if you had an interest in mushrooms," Sherlock replied, tapping against the spotless glass with a fingernail.  "You seem to have quite a few books collected on the topic."
"Well enough," Sherlock replied with a one-shouldered shrug.  "We had a few rough spots, but nothing I couldn't handle.  I'll be repeating the exposure several times over the next few days."  He didn't mention the throbbing ache in his arms and legs from where he'd been forced to jerk Devil's Blaze around when the stallion tried to run away from him.  Or the way that his feet were still sore, despite the extra socks he'd worn.  It wasn't important; it was just transport, after all.
"Riding, but that's not why I'm here."  John indicated Sherlock who was hanging back and viewing the exchange with barely veiled-suspicion.  "My boyfriend Billy's new to the area.  He works with horses back home, but he's practically a rodeo virgin.  Is it okay if I give him a quick peek behind the scenes?"
"I don't know.  You'd have to ask him," Donovan replied, tilting her head in Sherlock's direction.
Sherlock's upper lip curled in a sneer and he rolled back over, refusing to look at the pages scattered across the table on sheer principle, all thoughts of leaving London abruptly banished.
"You are so goddamn gorgeous…" John breathed, his eyes wide, still staring at Sherlock's chest, visibly drinking in all the details. The reverence in John's voice was like a balm to Sherlock's soul and Sherlock found himself relaxing in spite of his nerves.  "You're a fucking work of art…," John continued, licking his lips.  "You look like one of those Greek statues we studied in school…all perfect alabaster skin and godlike proportions."  John leaned forward, cupping Sherlock's jaw tenderly and claiming his lips in another heated kiss.  "Jesus, the things I'm gonna do to you, you gorgeous man," John whispered, drawing back.  "Just you wait."
"Gladly," Candii shot back.  "You, like most people, are thinking of the catch-all term for the feral horses roaming the American West. The ones that are a hodge-podge mess of Spanish, Thoroughbred, pony, draft, Quarter Horse or any other type of horse that got loose and survived long enough to join a herd and breed."  Candii's lip curled in obvious disgust.  "In that respect you're right: those mustangs are as common as muck and worth maybe a few hundred dollars from the wild, maybe a couple thousand if they've been trained up.  My mustangs, however, are purebred Kigers.  They're descended from Spanish type mustangs and are a hell of a lot rarer."
and khorazir's
Sherlock gripped his knees and leaned forward, staring intently as John finished taking his seat on the snorting horse.  Speckled Band was big.  Not as big as one of the 17 hand tall Shire horses back home in England, but still a healthy 15.3 hands by Sherlock’s estimate.
"Sorry..." Sherlock said, shaking his head to reorganized his thoughts.  "I was just...thinking."
“Back to the topic at hand,” Herb interrupted the laughing group to gather everybody’s attention back to himself.  “Who all is working tonight?”
"What?" John huffed, a soft note of affectionate laughter in his voice.  He raised an eyebrow, clearly wondering if Sherlock was pulling his leg.  "Like James Bond?  With all of those exploding wristwatches and laser pens?"
"Because I'd rather make up at least some of the labor and materials cost instead of eating it."
He'd found a helpful website that archived the individual standings of different cowboys for the regions, down to fiftieth place, going back almost twenty years.  John's name had appeared several times in the standings, though there was a gap of several years that likely coincided with his military deployment.  It also raised some interesting questions about John's finances.
Sherlock snorted.  He'd already encountered some individuals who made the most surly London cabbie look positively chummy by comparison, but he was confident in his own abilities to defend himself.  He hadn't spent years studying boxing or Baritsu to allow himself to be beaten by some testosterone-poisoned, drunken cowboys with the collective intelligence of a nine-banded armadillo.  It was a miracle the species wasn't extinct considering they routinely demonstrated their stubborn belief that a six pound animal curling up into an armored ball was an effective defense against an oncoming lorry that outweighed them by a factor of ten to the fifth power.  "Why are you telling me this?" Sherlock demanded impatiently, anxious to get on with Blaze's training.
"Then in that case, how is riding bulls any more dangerous?" Sherlock demanded, trying—and failing—not to imagine what could have happened if John
Brenda's expression was miserable.  "Not really.  It was posted directly on Tumblr.  I know it had 'barrel racer' in the title, though."
Swallowing hard, Sherlock slid out of the bed and hurried over to the laptop case he'd observed hanging from the clothes' rack earlier.  It took endless moments for the old laptop to boot up.  Every beep and chirp made Sherlock tense in anticipation.  Finally, the login screen appeared.  To Sherlock's surprise, it was password-protected.  Typing quickly, he began entering different passwords based on personal information John had dropped: FusilierVets, 3CWatson, RideEmCowboy.  None worked.  Sherlock grimaced.  It appeared he was going to have to resort to the blunt force technique.  Fortunately, there was a handy, unsecured guest account for him to use.
"No...it means to smell like horse urine," Sherlock replied matter-of-factly just as John took a mouthful.
The very real possibility of a rider being killed by an out-of-control bull had redefined another facet of the rodeo industry, the role of the rodeo clown.  In the beginning, they'd been hired to keep the paying audience amused between events.  After the introduction of the Brahma bull, however, they'd evolved from a simple crowd entertainer into a trained athlete that was more accurately described as a bullfighter (except unlike bulls in Spain, rodeo bulls lived; they were simply chased away from the injured rider on the ground).
"He hasn't.  He just apologized a lot and asked if I'd reconsider."
Sherlock blinked slowly and ran his tongue over his teeth, a nagging suspicion building in his mind at his brother's tone and word choice.  "You're being deliberately vague…what,
Sherlock decides to buy his big brother a gift...
"You take all of these yourself?"
Sherlock looked around.  There was nobody nearby, except for Bonnie and she was hardly likely to—what was colloquialism he'd heard Molly use the other day?  Oh yes, "spill the beans."  Sherlock smirked privately to himself.  He was looking forward to using the phrase at Mycroft's next soiree.  Watching Mycroft's not-grimace at his younger brother's deliberately uncultured mannerisms would almost be worth the tedium of having to wear a tuxedo and feign inebriation while he eavesdropped for potentially useful gossip.
He would focus on the Work tomorrow.
John blinked twice.  "Medical proce—what are you—'Spinal Tap' is a satirical movie about a British rock band trying to stage a comeback tour in the US!"
"Don't ask questions you don't want to know the answers to," Sherlock snapped as he typed.  "It makes it much more difficult for you to plead the First, or Fifth, or Seventeenth, or whatever it is you Americans plead when you don't want to incriminate yourselves.  If you're concerned about this impacting your investigation, don't be.  It won't be tied in any way to you."
"Too dangerous?" Sherlock repeated with a skeptical snort.  "John, you habitually drive in excess of the posted speed limit, work in a medical field that requires you to treat patients who out-mass you by a significant amount, who are also fully capable of shattering your skull or a limb with a single blow from their hooves.  You ride out-of-control horses for entertainment and are voluntarily dating me.  And, if that wasn't enough danger to sate your adrenaline addiction, you willingly enlisted with an employer who no-doubt deployed you to locations where you could easily have gotten shot at in addition to being attacked by an angry hippopotamus—"
Bronc riding wasn't nearly as elegant as dressage, as exciting as a steeplechase or as dangerous as eventing, but it was still a sport that took balance, courage, immense core strength, timing and a good bit of personal insanity to make it appear effortless.  In short, all things that Sherlock could appreciate and he'd upgraded his opinions accordingly.
does she do with her mustangs?  You mentioned their agility and endurance…Does she use them for polo or racing?"
Narrowing his eyes, Sherlock looked back over at John, trying to analyze him impartially.
“So you've said before.  Repeatedly.  I don't know why you persist in doing so.  You
"Triple C Ranch, Cabin F, 18940 East State Highway 221, Canyon Texas."
"John!" Sherlock yelped as he flinched back.  The sudden dampness permeating his jeans was uncomfortable, but he was more alarmed by the redness of the other man's face and the violence of John's coughing.  He shot to his feet, staggering slightly as he moved around to stand beside John.  One hand hovered uselessly over John's back as he frantically tried to recall the aid procedures for a choking individual.  Pat them on the back?  Perform the Heimlich manoeuvre?  Offer them a drink of water (which would be redundant practice, since consumption of a beverage was what had caused the problem in the first place)?  What was he supposed to do?  "John?  What should I do?  John?!"  The commotion drew the attention of several nearby patrons.  Sherlock could feel the weight of their curious gazes, but none of them offered aid.  It was a textbook example of the 'bystander effect' or 'bystander apathy.
Sherlock glowered at his brother, his nose wrinkled in displeasure even as he mentally cursed the other man's ability to manipulate him so easily.  Damn Mycroft and Sherlock's own addiction to the lure of puzzles.  Mycroft raised an eyebrow in mute query, his expression faintly mocking.  Sherlock sniffed once in response, silently conceding the match, check and mate to his elder sibling as he succumbed to temptation.
Sherlock frowned.  Both women were conventionally attractive.  One was tall and thin with skin the hue of fresh cinnamon.  Her dark hair was pulled up into a bun on the top of her head.  Her friend was shorter and quite curvaceous, with dark blond hair cut into a pixie bob and numerous freckles dotting her fair skin.  If one (or both of them) made a pass at John, would the vet respond?  He was distracted from his speculation by the sound of the leather impacting polyester resin, the clack of billiard balls ricocheting off of each other and John's exuberant whoop as he sunk his shot.
"...Please."
Donovan chuckled, prompting a weak giggle from Brenda in return.  "So what made you start barrel racing?" Donovan asked, leaning forward slightly, her body language inviting.  "It seems like a dangerous—well, I guess 'hobby' isn't the right word.  Passion, maybe?"  Donovan paused and raised an eyebrow, seeking confirmation.  "Passion, then," Donovan resumed at Brenda's nod.  Was it your mother or…?"
Sherlock reminded himself for what felt like the sextillionth time.  Somebody to be considered guilty until proven innocent.  "Doing what?  Are you competing?" Sherlock asked aloud, raising a single eyebrow.  The idea of watching John on the back of a bucking bronco had potential.  Perhaps he'd observe something significant.
"Hardly, though it is not the most common condiment in Europe.  The Dutch generally use mayonnaise, while the French prefer mustard, or sometimes
Because
"What's the carving on the tailpiece?" Sherlock asked.  "It's a bit too worn for me to make it out clearly."  If he could distract John, get him talking, maybe he could make him relax and forget about Sherlock's trespasses.
"Nothing just...you're clearly brilliant.  Your voice changes when you're thinking.  It's like you lose your accent.  I like it," John added hurriedly.  "It just makes me sad that somebody ever made you feel like you had to dumb yourself down to have a real conversation...are you alright, Billy?  You've gone pale."
"Hardly," Sherlock said dismissively.  It wasn't natural ability, it was experience.  Mummy had insisted that both her sons be schooled in a myriad of upper-class pastimes.  Even under the influence, swiveling his boots from side to side and traveling in a straight line was hardly a challenge for somebody who'd learned to avoid Mycroft's enormous feet during their ballroom dance lessons.  And that was to say nothing of the sibling rivalry that had reared its head during their brief stint studying the Argentine tango.
Sherlock kept his expression neutral, not letting his thought processes show on his face.  Rather than contradicting him, Sterndale was going out of his way to confirm Sherlock's vaguely leading questions and misrepresentations, and then going a step further to undermine Straker's reputation with insinuations and hyperbole.  He would have to do some more investigation into Sterndale's finances later.  It was looking more and more like Sterndale was involved, somehow.  "I see," Sherlock replied vaguely, purposely adopting a crestfallen expression.  "So you don't think he can be rehabilitated?"
"Yeah.  You mentioned you left your violin back home."
"Well hello, hello, hello," John drawled, raising the plastic tumbler filled with some sort of golden-coloured liquor he was cradling in his left hand to salute Sherlock.  "I thought I spotted your fine ass over here, Billy.  Got room for one more?" John asked, with all the subtlety of a gold digger at one of Liverpool's more exclusive clubs.  Without waiting for Sherlock's response, John grabbed an unoccupied chair from a nearby table and spun it around one-handed before straddling it.  It was a neat display of masculine grace that unashamedly drew attention to John's crotch and well-muscled thighs.  Once seated, John folded his forearms on the chair's back, the motion making the corded muscles in his forearms bunch and ripple, all without spilling a drop of his drink.
"I think so...yeah."
Flirting and blowjobs (finally) happen...
"I don't remember!"  Brenda said helplessly.  "They just looked like ordinary cowboys!"
"You are wearing entirely too much clothing," Sherlock grumbled.  John's position denied Sherlock the friction and pressure he wanted on his cock, so he reached down and took a double handful of John's bum, enjoying the way the taut muscle felt in his hands as he squeezed it.
"Him?" Sherlock asked, feigning confusion.  "But...isn't he the same guy who saved that barrel racer after her horse attacked her?  I read about it in the papers," Sherlock added hurriedly, seeing Alice's look of confusion.  "The papers were hailing him as some sort of hero."
He'd been surprised by Molly's insistence on paying for their drinks and pastries.  "The person who invites somebody out picks up the tab," Molly had explained with unexpected firmness as she'll pulled a bright pink fabric wallet covered with miniature skulls and crossbones out of her brown leather handbag to pay for Sherlock's black coffee, her own frappuccino topped with caramel syrup and whipped cream and two scones with butter (a cinnamon one for herself and a honey ginger scone for Sherlock).  Molly had also insisted on carrying both mugs and one of the plates over to a semi-secluded corner in the back corner of the shop, leaving Sherlock to carry the other plate and their forks.
Sherlock thought, his eyes widening as several disparate pieces of information suddenly clicked into place similar to a rearrangement reaction in organic chemistry.

Admittedly, the way Fizzy Simpson had attempted to spy on him from under the bleachers was a  bit more careless than he was used to, but nobody could be clever all the time.  Simpson had offered the rather clumsy explanation that he’d merely been enjoying his break, but the fact that he’d almost immediately attempted to bribe Sherlock for tips about Candii Ross’s bucking strings had given lie to his claim.  Simpson’s allusions to being a friend of the late Joe Straker also struck him as odd.  Alice Turner’s statement that Simpson’s apparent altruism was also for personal gain, combined with Edith Baxter’s subsequent disclosure that Simpson was a known gambler had only increased the vague suspicions Sherlock  harboured about the man.  He’d seen for himself that Simpson was clearly obsessed with money—why else would he charge a family for a photo op?  But greed didn’t necessarily make him complicit in Straker’s death.
"What, here?" Sherlock asked, trying not to stagger as he indicated the sea of cowboy hats, raucous laughter and cheerfully drunk bar goers surrounding them and hemming them in.
Sterndale touched the back of his neck with his left hand and paused, clearly debating on how to answer Sherlock's question.  He licked his lips once, before meeting Sherlock's gaze.  "As I said, I dislike speaking ill of the dead, Mr. Scott.  To me it seems...unprofessional to slander a business associate...even one that I did not get on with.  That being said, just between us, mind, Joe Straker was not nearly as good at his job, or as...reputable as Candii Ross would like you to believe."
Sherlock rolled his eyes, suppressing the automatic suggestion that John get it printed on a tee-shirt.  He wasn't willing to run the risk of antagonizing his ride to the point of finding himself abandoned in a car park.  It was still some distance back to Candii Ross's ranch and cab fare, assuming he could even find one, would be outrageous.  "I have it on good authority from quite a few of Ms. Ross's staff that prior to Straker's death, Devil's Blaze was relatively gentle for a stallion.  He certainly didn't have a history of being dangerously aggressive.  Even Molly Hooper commented on how much of a 'love' Devil's Blaze was."
John nodded, bringing his own truck to a halt a few places away.
"I already know you were fired for public intoxication in the same barn that Joe Straker's corpse was found," Sherlock began bluntly, ignoring the way John bit back a wince.  He had no time for idle pleasantries.  Especially not when he was under a time constraint.  "I'm interested in why you suspect you were set up."
The score was currently 69 to 69 and there were only three object balls left on the table.  Sherlock pursed his lips, deciding on his target.  It was a tricky shot, involving banking the target ball thrice off the cushion and caroming off the other object ball, but not an impossible one.  If he did manage to make this shot instead of scratching, he would be able to take advantage of the intra-game reracking rules and (hopefully) increase his lead.
A collie, sniffing along one of the fence lines, spotted him and barked as Sherlock stepped off the porch.  Abandoning its investigation, it ran towards him, tongue lolling and tail wagging as it eagerly began sniffing him, thrusting its pointed nose into Sherlock's crotch in the manner of large dogs everywhere.
"Well," John began, pursing his lips and releasing Sherlock so he could stand upright.  "In that case, that's a damn shame and we're gonna have to change that!"
"I don't follow," Sherlock lied.  "What do you mean you have to drop everything off?"
John pursed his lips as, visibly considering Sherlock's words in light of his own experiences.  After a moment he looked sideways at Sherlock, his blue eyes still troubled.  "So why'd you lie?  Why not just ask Sterndale about Blaze's behavior straight out?"
"Easy enough," the barista replied, writing John's order down efficiently.  "You want cheese?"
It was dull, stereotypical British weather at its finest...and utterly hateful for the business lull it brought in its wake.
"Thank you, sir.  Do you have a photo ID?"
Far more disturbing, however, was the prevalence of injuries, both old and new, that he could read on their bodies.
Sherlock blinked in surprise. That was the third time John had complimented his rather straightforward observations.  His eyes narrowed as he quickly scanned John's face for signs of sarcasm or indicators of an ulterior motive.  John's face radiated nothing but sincerity and pride.  It reminded Sherlock nothing so much as the encouragement he used to receive as a child from Tom Knisley and, oddly enough Mrs. Hudson.  The old blacksmith had been quick to compliment  Sherlock on his observations about different gaits and the corresponding horseshoe wear patterns.  His landlady-not-your-housekeeper was likewise quite effusive with her praise about him being her clever boy for solving baffling cases...at least when she wasn't scolding him for leaving his boots about for her to trip over, or calling him a clot for borrowing her refrigerator without permission to hold blood and urine samples because they wouldn't fit alongside the horsehead in his own.  "Thank you," Sherlock finally said, feeling absurdly pleased by John's flattery.
At that, Candii Ross growled, her hands flexing and curling on the desk in front of her.  After a moment, she blew out an angry breath.  "I've been in business for over thirty years, Mr. Holmes," she began after a moment.  "I've had my share of ups and downs.  Droughts, fires, the occasional tornado...they all take a toll on my bottom line.  This is the first time, though, that I can recall havin' such a streak of bad luck in so short a time frame."
Sherlock barely managed to suppress a shiver of apprehension as John's deft fingers moved up his torso.  It was just transport.  God alone knew how many idiots ended up naked in bed together after sharing a meal—it was practically standard date behavior.  He'd lost count of the number of quick-and-dirty mutual masturbatory sessions he'd shared with Victor in the nearest loo, or the countless times where Victor had buggered him while they were both high.  John had already sucked him off in a pickup truck in the desert, so it wasn't like John hadn't seen his penis but for some reason, John undressing him felt more intimate, as if John were somehow revealing parts of him that he usually kept hidden away.
most successful British dressage rider in the history of the sport—had been placing in show jumping competitions hosted by her local Pony Club chapter at the tender age of three, but there was still a world of difference between the albeit present, (though somewhat constrained), form of danger presented by show jumping and the raw risk of riding a bucking horse sans helmet.  A chill slithered down his spine at the thought of how easily John Watson could have died before they ever met.
"No," John cut him off, a guilty expression on his face.  "You didn't do anything wrong...It's just…" John's lips tightened in discernable anger as he indicated the crowd of protesters across the street.  "It's the fucking protestors.  The Westborough nuts are bad enough, but seeing Kitty Riley here really puts me on edge."
John’s shrug was nonchalant.  "There are doctors pushing to make helmets mandatory across the board, but it hasn't happened yet.  Some of the junior organizations require kids to wear safety gear now, but it’s still optional for adults past a certain age, thank God.  Pass me the tape, would you?  I need to wrap my wrist and arm."
"Thank you," Sherlock replied, copying John's courtious tip of his Stetson and following him outside.
A pause, then.
No, whatever he did would have to be subtle.  The RPM method of rationalization, projection and minimization had potential, but it also ran the risk of showing his hand too soon.  Given the size of Sterndale's ego, using the 'contradict me' strategy would probably be the better choice.
"Seriously?  You've never been to a rodeo?" John looked at Sherlock, his expression askance.
~ * ~
"I had a reason to be," Sherlock said simply, watching John cross to a handy sink to wash his hands.
John frowned as he rapidly began scanning the environment the way a soldier would: looking for threats and hidden vantage points.  "There—" he announced abruptly, pointing in the direction of an enormous, slowly-turning fan mounted across the way.  "Damn."
.  He might have overdone it a bit in his effort to show off.
"Are you sure this is okay, Billy?" John asked, watching Sherlock closely, apprehension rife in his tone.  John's posture was military straight and his chin was up, a pose Sherlock had learned to decipher as John feeling acutely uncomfortable.  "There are picnic tables in the common area if you'd rather eat outside—"
The wooden boards were cracked and dented from the blows of Scotty's hooves, but there was nothing Sherlock would consider 'interesting' caught on them—no threads, no fibers, no traces of oddly-coloured mud or unidentifiable stains.  Dismissing the door as a dead end, Sherlock turned to examine the remains of the heavy-duty feed and water buckets.  Both of them had been kicked almost to pieces.  The feed bucket had been broken off the wall was lying on its side in one corner.  The water bucket was still hanging off its mount, but had multiple cracks from where Scotty had kicked it which in turn had allowed its contents to drain onto the floor.  When Sherlock looked inside, however, there was still some water that had pooled to one side.  Sherlock checked over his shoulder to see if he was being observed before using a large-gauge hypodermic to collect a sample of the fluid for later analysis.  A sample of the feed scattered across the floor was likewise taken.  After a few moments of thought, Sherlock collected several scrapings from the buckets, focusing on the areas that were most likely to have had contact with Scotty's mouth.  Some form of contact poison was unlikely outside of the elite world of equestrian sports, but as a previous case had demonstrated, people were endlessly inventive when it came to finding new ways to cheat.  Sherlock tucked the filled tubes into his boots and stooped to study the floor.
"Is he a Chuckwagon cook for a ranch outfit or something?" John asked, predictably suggesting one of the few viable occupations for a male cook in a rural area.  "Or does he own a restaurant?  One of those all-you-can-eat, stick-to-your ribs down home cooking places?  Because I love those; they always have the best homemade peach cobblers."
"I did get shot," John interrupted in an exasperated tone.  "I've even got a scar on my thigh to prove it—"
Running his hand absently over the pool cue in a stroking motion, Sherlock circled the table, studying the position of the various balls.  John's last shot, though effective, had been messy, knocking balls askew all over the table's surface and sending Sherlock's prior strategy out the window.  Fine.  He'd play this game a different way.
"Just a moment, Molly.  Nope," Sherlock said, turning to address John.  "I don't, but it's fine.  Molly's in class right now but said she'll be here at five and she can give me a ride if none of the cabs will take me."  Sherlock deliberately uttered last few words with a tone of patient long-suffering.
"No.  Just throbbing."
"What about?" John asked, tilting his head to one side.
"I'm quite aware of the idiocy of speaking to you as if you are capable of comprehending English," Sherlock said calmly, angling his body at a forty-five degree angle so that it wouldn't look like he was planning on pouncing.  He was careful to keep his body language relaxed and his hands held out slightly to the sides so the stallion could see they were currently empty: no whips, ropes or clubs.  "Nonetheless," Sherlock continued, his voice soothing, "I feel compelled to point out that—despite what you are no doubt anticipating based on your prior experiences—I'm not here to hurt you.  You're all right..."
"I'll have that, then."
"I just saw a massive shooting star."
"Billy, I'd like you to meet Mary-Ann, Renée, and Carley," John said, indicating each person as he made the introductions.  "Ladies, this is my friend, Billy.  He's new to the area...and green...so be nice to him, all right Renée?" John added with a pointed look at the woman in question.
Sherlock tucked his mobile back into his pocket, redonned his gloves and resumed his careful examination of the bedding.
"Alrighty, then," the woman chuckled, waving the two of them off.  "It sounds like you've got everything you need and then some.  Good luck!  Don't forget, the main performance starts at six so don't wear each other out too badly!"
The waitress snorted a laugh.  "You betcha.  I'll be back in just a moment with your drinks."
The horse snorted and made a half-hearted attempt at kicking him as Sherlock stepped in close enough to lift the first two circles of rope over Scotty's head.  "None of that," Sherlock scolded, easily avoiding the strike.  He waited a moment for Scotty to settle before carefully pulling the last two lassos off.  "There, you see, that wasn't so bad," Sherlock said, rubbing Scotty's neck soothingly as he clipped a lead rope to the gelding's halter.  Scotty snorted and rolled his eyes in apparent disagreement.  "Hold his head," Sherlock ordered, passing the rope to John and pulling the rope and scotch hobble off of his shoulder.  Still moving slowly, Sherlock looped one end of the rope around Scotty's neck and tied a bowline knot.  The circle of rope made a loose loop around the base of Scotty's neck that wouldn't slip and tighten, no matter how much it was pulled.  Sherlock kept the other end of the coiled rope in his left hand as he picked up Scotty's left rear leg.
beyond what he had intended.  When had John started to develop feelings for him beyond straightforward lust?  Why the sudden sick sense of guilt?  As much as he was loath to admit it, Donovan was right.  His duty was to investigate the case impartially and let the chips fall where they may.  He didn't think that John was responsible, but at the same time, he couldn't dismiss Donovan's valid arguments over why John should still be considered a suspect.  One way or another, the truth would out.

"How so?"
"That may well be…" John agreed, nudging Sherlock to one side so he could pull a cabinet door open.  He reached inside, pulled out two plates and a mismatched pair of wine glasses and began setting the table.  "But all this—" John gestured with one of the plates he still held, indicating Sherlock, the steaming pans, and the careful arrangement of prepared ingredients and spices lined up on the counter in variously-sized coffee mugs and plastic takeaway lids, "—this seems pretty competent for somebody who claims that he can't cook.  This is the kind of setup I'd expect from one of those fancy cooking shows my grandma used to watch, not a horse whisperer."
Sherlock could feel the warmth radiating off of John's frame.  John smelled faintly of some sort of spicy soap or body wash and clean skin.  It was...nice, as Molly would no doubt say.
John blinked.  "You're seriously getting your brother a bull-penis handle umbrella as a gift?"
"Well, from the initial phone call, actually.  Seeing the mare in person simply confirmed my deductions."
"Shut. Up," Sherlock ground out through clenched teeth, tasting bile in the back of his throat.
The car's radio chattered a stream of numerical codes that Sherlock deduced to be related to traffic violations, petty crimes and other inane human problems.  Dull.  Resigning himself to the inevitable tedium of having to answer idiotic questions, Sherlock shifted slightly on the uncomfortable seat, wrinkling his nose at the faint aroma of sweat, spilled coffee and donuts permeating the car's interior, before turning his attention to the driver.  If nothing else he could use the unexpected interruption of his investigation as an opportunity to perhaps wheedle himself into Lestrade's good graces.  If Lestrade was regularly responsible for patrolling the fairgrounds, it would be best to have him as an ally, rather than an adversary.  Bonding over shared experiences was frequently a successful technique, and horse lovers were no different.  "How long have you been a mounted officer?" Sherlock asked.
"Woah there, slow down Billy," John ordered with a chuckle as Sherlock leaned forward to nip eagerly at the skin of John's throat.  "We've got all the time in the world," John continued, placing one palm flat against Sherlock's chest.  He gave Sherlock a gentle shove backwards, putting a scant two inches between their respective torsos.  "I've been wanting to do this for weeks—I could hardly think of anything but you while I was gone.  Now that I'm back, I'm going to damn well take my time and enjoy myself.  Okay?"  Correctly interpreting Sherlock's rapid blinking as agreement, John leaned in to inhale at the sensitive skin just underneath Sherlock's jaw.  "I know I've said this before, but you smell fucking fantastic," John murmured, the sensation of his lips against Sherlock's throat making Sherlock tremble.
"Can do," the vet promised.
"I was thinking, under pretty much any other circumstances, this would be a dream come true," John replied, conversationally as he carefully worked the strip of leather out of the zipper’s metal teeth.
“Oi!  Budge up, you,” John mock-growled, shattering the silent tranquility of 221b with stomping feet as he came in from outside with the daily post.  The order was emphasized by John aiming a cheerful swat at the bottom of Sherlock’s feet with the cluster of envelopes he held in one hand.
"Good.  That is rather the point."
"Thanks," John said, accepting his keys back and the muzzle and hobbles Sherlock had fetched.  He gave Sherlock a quick smile of gratitude, but his eyes didn't leave his patient as he threaded a rope through the metal D-rings attached to each end of of the scotch hobble.  After several more long, tense moments, Scotty's head finally began to droop.
“SHAME ABOUT THAT!  ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR HIM, WOULD YOU ALL?  HE GAVE IT A GOOD TRY!  NEXT UP, IN CHUTE NUMBER TWO, IS JAMES RYDER OOOOONNN GOOSE ‘EM!  THIS IS ONE BAAAAADDD BUCKIN’ HORSE!”
"Is he being fed by the same person?"
Opening his eyes, Sherlock stared up at the ceiling, as if the wooden panels could offer him the insight he sought.
John sighed.  Pity, that.  He’d rather been rather looking forward to a relaxing evening after spending two days listening to his sister continuing to blame him for her problems and the other doctor's rather grim prognosis if Harry didn't change her drinking habits.  He should have known better to expect an evening of quiet domesticity though, considering who he lived with.
"Okay.  I'm going to check his temp," John said, pulling a digital animal thermometer from his kit and moving around to the gelding's hindquarters.  "Temperature's slightly elevated—consistent with hard exercise," John reported after a few seconds.  "Greg?  Do you think you could pass me the blood pressure machine in the red toolbox?" John asked, turning around to address the police captain.  Lestrade looked relieved to have something to do.  "It's that small, gray boxy thing," John instructed.  "Yeah.  Thanks."  John busied himself with strapping the machine's cuff around the base of Scotty's tail and pressed the button.  A moment later, it beeped in response.  "Shit," John swore, looking at the readings.  "His blood pressure is really high…"
"John?" Sherlock said softly, gently shaking John's shoulder.  "Sit up for a sec?  I brought back some water in case you're thirsty."
"Acceptable."
"Hmmmm…," Sherlock replied, pretending to focus his attention on the magazine in order to put John at ease by giving him a sense of privacy.  He turned the page and gave the magazine a decided snap.  "I have an older brother…he aggravates me constantly."
"OHJESUSFUCKINGCHRIST!" John howled as Sherlock firmly pressed his fingertips against the nub of tissue while simultaneously swallowing around John's cock and taking it to the root.  John's hips bucked violently and it was all Sherlock could do not to slam his nose against John's pubic bone.  He pulled back slightly but didn't release his prize.  Instead, he continued to rub his tongue against the bottom of John's shaft, gentling him through the aftershocks until a grunt of complaint and an uncoordinated hand wave indicated that John had had enough.
"Yes."
“Hmmm?” Sherlock replied absently, covertly enjoying the way the tight denim of John’s jeans highlighted the excellent muscles of his arse. He glanced up to see John watching him, a smug grin creasing his face.
"That's an imprecise term, John," Sherlock complained.  "I'm hardly whispering to the horses; I'm using my extensive experience in equine psychology and body language to teach or retrain them...though sometimes that involves teaching the human as well."
"Yeah," John's replied ruefully.  He raised and lowered both shoulders as he blew out a deep breath.  "I know how that goes.  If things had worked out differently, I might have been a fourth-generation rancher.  But, well, sometimes life has ways of throwing you curveballs and you just have to make the best of the situation."  John looked sad for a moment, before purposely assuming a cheerful facade.  "Course, if I'd been a rancher, instead of a vet, I might never have met you—and that would be one hell of a shame," John continued with a cheesy wink.  "Play me another?"
By contrast, allowing a horse to run his or her nose into a hard object, such as a brush or elbow was an extremely effective, self-administered punishment that taught that biting was unacceptable.
"Fucking gorgeous, Billy," John said simply, his voice soft.  He waved an expansive hand, indicating Sherlock's lanky form.
Donovan's mouth opened and closed several times as she took in the scene.  Still frowning, she stepped through and nudged the door closed behind her with a heel.  "Holmes?  What the
"What are you doing?" Donovan asked suddenly, watching Sherlock text.
"A variety," Sherlock replied, shrugging one shoulder.  "As I'm sure you are already aware, equines possess a simple stomach, much like ours—though theirs is also capable of digesting plant fiber.  I wanted to test different lipid and protein levels, but I also wanted to avoid potential allergic reactions, so I limited my samples to insects that were considered safe for human consumption: locusts, crickets, silkworm pupae, ants, and several types of beetle larvae."
"I see," Sherlock murmured, slotting the information into his mental timeline.  He crouched down to tug lightly at one of the bales of alfalfa.  Sherlock frowned.  Several strands of hay came away easily, evidence that somebody had been messing with the hay.
Except the surrounding facts didn't fit.
"Money," John replied as if that explained everything.  "Well, that and greed.  It's changed the whole nature of the sport."
"Everything all right?" Lestrade asked, making a visible effort to refocus as the clicking of high heels heralded Donovan's return.
John had looked surprised and perhaps the slightest bit guilty when Sherlock landed, but it hadn’t stopped him from giggling like a naughty child as he watched Sherlock try to stagger to his feet.  When John had bent down to help him up, Sherlock had batted his hands away.  It was partially out of injured pride and partially because he was already disoriented enough from being thrown out of his mind palace.  Sherlock hadn’t wanted extra sensory input in the form of touch or a sudden change in balance.  But John was nothing if not stubborn.  He had reached down and grabbed Sherlock’s left wrist with one hand, yanking Sherlock to his feet with a strength that belied his short stature.
John hardly recognized him. It seemed impossible that this was the same person as his Sherlock with all the uncontainable energy, climbing furniture and pacing the room. Or his Sherlock when asleep. With his mouth slightly open, his hair a mess and his limbs everywhere but at his side of the bed.
‘Only this one time?’ Siger Holmes asked. John just nodded. Suddenly the door opened and there was Rosie with her school bag on her back.
‘And he…he fell asleep again?’ Rosie said cautiously while slowly going to John.
“You mean…”
‘Yes, yes I… will. Thanks.’ John said, still a bit dazed. ‘But I… can I say goodnight to him?’ he asked almost shyly.
‘John! Where are you? What happened? We caught them, he had two sidekicks, but you were nowhere to be found!’
‘Sherlock. Stop it, please. You’ll hurt yourself.’ And just like he was about to call the nurses again, Sherlock stilled. John looked at him. But he didn’t look at closed eyes. Nor was it a vacant stare that he saw. He looked into eyes that looked back at him.
Doctor and nurses came and went without any news, really. Sherlock still reacted quite strongly with his arms to prolonged pressure, but he didn’t repeat his reaction to words and his eyes remained closed. John found it more bad than good but the doctor said not to lose hope just yet. They should give him time to improve until it was a week after the surgery. So, three more days and then they should start to worry if nothing changed. That was what John gathered from the mysterious speech of doctors anyway.
‘Alright, enough!’ John interrupted. ‘I think Rosie should decide for herself.’
‘No need to thank me for that, John,’ Sherlock said. ‘It’s…’ Sherlock didn’t know how to express himself. Making John happy or satisfied at least was like breathing. Actually, no. Breathing was boring. This was the most important, essential but also natural thing for Sherlock to do.
‘John, you have to under…understand. I… I’m sorry. I realized. And then it… I didn’t want to-‘ Sherlock ranted.
‘We should probably go.’ Mr. Holmes said.
So this is it! The end! (For now, at least)
But there was something Sherlock never did. He never lifted or held Rosie. John noticed it but didn’t speak of it abiding the habit of them not to talk about such things, until one afternoon. Rosie woke up earlier from her nap while John was still asleep in his chair after he had drifted off with newspapers in his lap. Sherlock was in the middle of an experiment when he heard Rosie mumbling something and standing up unsteadily in the cot. He went over to her. When he got there, Rosie stretched her arms towards him and demanded to get out of there.
‘Sorry.’ She said while John was sitting down beside her. He smiled as much as he could in the moment.
‘Yes. You’re right, I guess.’ Sherlock said with his head bowed. Then he looked up and took John’s hand in his. ‘Thank you, John.’
After a brief conversation with the doctor they found themselves in the corridor just a few steps away from Sherlock’s room. John stopped. He motioned Rosie to sit on a chair and seated himself next to her.
Then he kissed her forehead and asked. ‘Why don’t you read something to Sherlock from the new book of yours? I think he would like that.’
and nobody would convince him otherwise.
They couldn’t help it, they laid down on one bed, embracing each other. John lied on his back with his left arm around Sherlock, who rested his head on John’s chest and his arm was stretched across John’s stomach. ‘John?’ Sherlock said when John was half asleep already.
‘Precious only child. His parents over there. Look at their faces. Fear, wonder, pride… this is their first child to go to school. And their last, too. They're not the youngest. It's unlikely for them to have a small child. They're the exhibit A of today's trend to have one child in your late 30s. And If they
‘Yeah.’ John sighed while still holding Sherlock. ‘That was stupid, I’ll give you that.’ He said and they both chuckled.
‘How long?!’ Sherlock shouted suddenly but right after that he sagged. ‘Sorry.’
In the middle of the night, John was awakened by a noise. Before he could see something in the dark room, he heard Sherlock groan and breath heavily. ‘Sherlock?’ John whispered when already half out of bed.
‘Yes, yes of course.’
‘No, no. He won’t.’ John answered, trying to convince himself. But he wanted to be honest with his daughter, too, so he added: ‘Listen, why don’t we all sit down with tea and talk?’
‘Can I have a say in this?’ Rosie asked with a smile on her face. She quite enjoyed these little arguments. It showed how much both John and Sherlock cared about her. ‘I think it’s a moderately important day and I certainly don’t want to make fuss about it.’
‘I know what you mean.’ John said, but Rosie didn’t seem convinced and John really couldn’t blame her.
Rosie nodded and John left. He suddenly realised that he hadn’t eaten anything since that morning and his stomach growled.
John just shook his head and turned back towards Sherlock. And suddenly, he was looking into open eyes. Sherlock’s eyes were open again! ‘Sherlock!’ he said loudly but no other reaction just like before but it didn’t surprise him that much this time and he tried to stay calm. ‘Hey, Sherlock, Rosie will play for you tonight. Well, she hasn’t practiced all week, but it’ll be great all the same. You love it so much when she plays.’ He smiled a bit and kissed Sherlock. His eyes remained open for five minutes.
‘That is nice of you, Rosie. But be careful, okay?’ If he were honest, he didn’t want anything else than to cuddle with Sherlock at night again but obviously, he wouldn’t fit.
‘Yes, I’m sorry about that, I-‘ but he was interrupted, too.
“Okay. Let’s try it like this.” and he started to put Rosie in Sherlock’s arms slowly so Sherlock had time to react. Fear was still visible in his eyes but John saw there determination and love too. Rosie stretched her arms towards Sherlock once again and called him “Da!” too. But luckily, Sherlock didn’t hear it in his concentration. Otherwise he would froze for like five minutes as he would the next day when he’d heard it, which would be unfortunate right now as he might really drop her.
"Tour groups?" Sherlock repeated with a raised eyebrow, his skepticism apparent.
"I want this," Sherlock assured him, relishing the delicious weight of John's body and the feel of John's strong thighs bracketing his own legs.  It was a position that was calling forth all sorts of pleasurable possibilities.  Even better was the fact that their faces were now at the same level.  The moonlight pouring through the window turned John's blond hair silver and made Sherlock's own skin glow alabaster in comparison.  To please himself, Sherlock ran his hands over John's strong shoulders and down his back, enjoying the contrasting sensations of soft, worn cotton and hard muscle underneath his palms.
"Problem?" Sherlock asked, shaping the infliction of his voice upward, while simultaneously ducking his chin and raising both eyebrows.  He punctuated the question with a slow double-blink to indicate insecurity, though the burgeoning hardness he could feel from John's groin made the answer obvious.
"What time is it?" Sherlock asked as he followed John across the car park, pretending he hadn't noticed the clock on the wall.
"John!" Sherlock protested, hating,
“Yep.  Real shame, that,” Harry said, shaking his head in sympathy.
John blinked, obviously surprised by the question.  "Me?"
"You're forgetting, I've worked with him too," John argued, apparently oblivious to Sherlock's thoughts.  "That stallion is a handful—don't downplay yourself."
At that, her mouth snapped shut. "Fine," she snapped, pushing herself to her feet and scooping up her purse and fringed leather jacket with a huff.  "You don't have to be a dick about it; I was just tryin' ta be friendly!"  With one last pointed glare, she grabbed the handle of her luggage and strode off, the wheels of her suitcase rattling loudly.
He gasped as John shifted again, abandoning the sensual torture of his navel to bury his nose in Sherlock's groin instead.  Sherlock's breath hitched as John began to inhale and exhale deeply, his nose nudging at Sherlock's burgeoning erection.  He could feel the warmth of John's breath against sensitive skin, even through the dual layers of his jeans and pants.  Sherlock closed his eyes again to better focus on the sensory input and the tide of pleasure surging through his body.  He was barely awake, but that was fine.  He had no intention of making John stop anytime soon.
"Of course," Sherlock agreed pleasantly, watching Molly carefully lock the door behind them.
"Yes," Lestrade replied bluntly, not taking his eyes from the road.  "Despite what the bean counters think, a good mounted officer is worth at least ten officers on foot, is excellent at crowd control and unbeatable for neighborhood policing."
Sherlock meanwhile used the opportunity to drink his excellent coffee and study John's features for information.  The bags under John's eyes were a bit more pronounced than they'd been the last time Sherlock had seen him.  Late nights?  Stress?  A combination of the two?  John's jeans weren't new, Sherlock noted turning his attention to John's wardrobe.  They were well-worn, a bit faded...a working pair, rather than a "best dress" pair designed to impress, such as the ones John had worn on their prior dates.  John's boots were still the same.  There was no useful information to be gleaned from the plain white vest John wore under his blue chambray shirt, though the chambray shirt itself had a small tear in one sleeve that had been mended with a Cushing suture.  Work clothes, or at least clothes that John didn't mind damaging, which was sensible, considering the propensity of cowboys getting thrown off their animals and onto the dirt floor of the arenas, Sherlock decided with a mental nod.
"Can you please relay the number of that image file, Officer Gregory?" Donovan asked.
After a moment, John cupped his hand against Sherlock’s nape and gently tugged the detective’s head away: the soft sensations of Sherlock’s mouth evidently becoming too much for his sensitive flesh. With his free hand, John reached down and clasped the condom, holding it in place as his breathing continued to even out.
Standing up abruptly, Sherlock stalked across the floor, avoiding the tripping hazards with unconscious ease as he came to a halt in front of the other man.  Leaning forward, Sherlock inhaled deeply to better analyze the scents clinging to Mycroft's suit, unashamedly ignoring the other man's affronted look at the invasion of his personal space.  Overpriced French food, the pipe tobacco-and-leather infused odor of the Diogenes Club and expensive perfume.  Drawing back, Sherlock closed his eyes to better flick through his mental database and deduce the reason for Mycroft's presence.  His lips curled in disgust as the solution realised itself.
"It's possible," Sherlock admitted, mercilessly suppressing the faint pang he felt.  Illogical, really.  John Watson was a suspect, guilty until proven innocent.  His gregarious, easy-going nature made it easy to overlook the sharp intelligence in his gaze.  There was no need to succumb to sentiment, even if John's laughing blue eyes, competence and obvious appreciation for Sherlock's own intelligence made his company a pleasure, rather than a burden.  "I was present when Doctor Watson was consulting with Sterndale about some abnormally aggressive cattle he'd been treating.  Like Sterndale, Doctor Watson's knowledgeable about plants that cause adverse reactions in various forms of livestock and their symptoms—particularly those that produce aggression in horses," Sherlock added as an afterthought.  "He mentioned several specific plants, including wooly locoweed, by name.  There's also the way that he has gone out of his way to manufacture excuses to spend time in my proximity."
"Exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage," Sherlock translated.  "During strenuous exercise, it isn't uncommon for some capillaries in the lungs to burst in what is called pulmonary capillary stress failure.  Surveys done in the past have identified the problem in eighty-two percent of racehorses older than three years old.  The blood flow isn't significant enough to be worrisome.  It should stop completely within the next ten minutes or so—what?" Sherlock demanded, seeing that John had left off examining the horse and was staring at him intently.
"Oh, nothing for me, thanks," John said, shaking his head wryly.
She gave Sherlock a bright smile and Sherlock echoed it automatically, his eyes still busily scanning the surrounding crowd for any hints of somebody acting suspiciously.  He saw the rodeo clown, Fizzy Simpson, hurry by, clad in a shimmery satin candy-striped button-down in shades of hot pink and light blue and a pair of baggy denim trousers sewn over with orange felt stars.  The clown's distinctive red hat was clamped down firmly over his head, the brim partially obscuring his face.  As Sherlock watched, the rodeo clown was approached by a family with two small children, no doubt hoping for a photo opportunity, since both children were wearing highly fanciful western outfits, complete with an abundance of fringe and spangles.  Sherlock winced: it was as bad as some of the garb in the cowboy-themed pubs back home.  The clown said something to the man, who responded by pulling out his wallet and handing the clown several bills.  A moment later, the clown was on his knees, posing with the little girl on one side and the little boy on the other while the mother squealed and clasped her hands together in delight.
John looked troubled.  "So is...that what you meant when you mentioned having met Sterndale's type before?"
Bloody foam surrounded the horse's mouth, dribbling down its nylon halter and streaking the elbow-length bovine exam gloves of the person restraining the stallion's head.  Oddly enough, despite the sedative, the horse's eyes were wide and staring, blown pupils almost completely obscuring the irises.
"Interesting.  In your own words, I want you to describe what happened in Barn A, stall seventeen at the Flagstaff Equifest Saddle Series Rodeo on the morning of Saturday, March 13th of this year."
Which a deep sigh, Sherlock wiped his sweaty hands off on the seat of his jeans and shifted to re-don his Stetson. The blazing, late-afternoon sun made the wide-brimmed hat a necessity, rather than a fashionable accessory, which galled him because of the havoc it wrecked on his naturally curly hair.
Seeing it, Molly's stomach suddenly churned and she raised her torch higher, playing the light carefully over the floor of the stall.  "Oh no," she whispered, almost dropping her torch in horror as the light revealed the bloodied and badly mangled body of the Triple C's missing trainer.
Sherlock could feel the thick length of John's penis through his jeans, and the other man wasn't even fully aroused yet.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  "John—
John blinked, his pupils dilating noticeably as he mirrored Sherlock's lip-licking motion.  "Um, not at all.  Why?"
John blinked several times in rapid succession. "Except that the pen wasn't overcrowded," he finally replied, one fist clenching in obvious annoyance at Sterndale's cavalier attitude.  "It was a simple stock auction, and the dog in question was an experienced ranch animal.  It had been raised around cattle.  It knew how to behave.  For safety's sake, I ran a post-mortem on the two steers I had to euthanize since they and the rest of the lot were intended for human consumption.  I didn't find anything out of the ordinary on the blood tests, but I did notice quite a bit of eye inflammation on them as well.  If you could just take a look..."  John pulled out a sheaf of folded papers from his back pocket and laid them out on Sterndale's desk.
Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes.  "Look," he began, holding up Ned Hunter's witness statement.  "Smoking in barns is a proscribed activity on account of the extreme fire hazard it represents.  Even Ned Hunter mentioned that he was smoking outside when he heard raised voices.  Yet Brenda mentioned somebody walking past Cream Soda's stall with a lit cigarette, even though other people were standing in the front of the building and smoking.  She also mentioned that her horse panicked afterward.  It intrigues me, because while most chemical substances are either ingested or injected, aerosol dispersal is certainly possible."
"Explain it to me then.  Is bronco riding like racing, where the jockey is responsible for supplying their own equipment, with the exception of the silks, which the owner supplies?"
"I know," Sherlock told him gently, his baritone voice a soothing rumble as the stallion finally bowed his head in a sign of submission.  "I know.  It's all right.  I'm not going to hurt you.  In fact, because you finally did what I wanted you to do, I'm going to leave you alone."  Sherlock took a careful sliding step back from the exhausted animal, working his way back to the pen's wall.  "But first, I'm going to get you some water and walk you out.  It isn't safe to let you drink your fill until you've cooled down and I have absolutely no intention of letting you kill yourself via colic due to hyperdistension of the stomach."
"Two waters to start," John ordered for them both, "and then I'll take a pint of the Railyard Amber Ale.  Billy?"
Sherlock wondered, glaring down at the screen as he read John’s response.  He could tell at a glance if there was a problem with a horse’s conformation.  Likewise he could easily determine if one of his equine clients had gained or lost weight and how it might affect their gait or behavior.
wants to do.  He turned to address Sherlock.  "How’s the wrist, Mr. Scott?"
"No.  I mean yes. I mean of course I'll be more careful, " John agreed eagerly, resuming his seat.  "Speaking of...um...would you like me to buy you a drink since I spilled the other one?"
Another quick grapple and John was on his back, Sherlock lying prone above him.  Sherlock slowly laved his tongue across John’s throat and down his chest, teasing his nipples with alternating flicks of his tongue and fingers. He  inhaled the mingled scents of sweat and desire.
"Ow, Billy!  Jesus, not so hard!  I'm fine, Billy.  Really...I'm fine," John wheezed, waving him off, sounding anything but convincing.  "You just caught me by surprise."  He coughed again and took a hasty sip of his bourbon.  "Jesus!  Jumentous?!  Where in God's name did you learn a word like that?"
"I do."
"Dammit Sally!" Lestrade exclaimed, rubbing an aggravated hand through his hair.  "Why can't you fucking trust my judgment on this?"
"Here we are," John announced, walking—
Sherlock looked up from the small tarp he was shaking out to see Candii Ross approaching from the direction of the main barns.  She had one hand tucked into a pocket, while her other hand slowly tapped the clipboard she was carrying against her thigh as she walked.  When she was close enough, Sherlock narrowed his eyes, attempting to read text on the papers, but gave up after a moment.  The words were too small to make out, but based on the spacing and colour of the paper itself, it was almost certainly some sort of calendar or rotation schedule.  Irrelevant.  Bonnie, meanwhile, rose from her spot in the shade and wandered over to greet her mistress, plumed tail wagging.
"Yeah, yeah, I get that," John groused, rolling his eyes.  "But how was it?  Did you like it?"  His casual tone belied the tension Sherlock could feel in his muscles.
The silent parking lot resembled something out of a zombie movie, one of the horrible scary ones that her ex-boyfriend had enjoyed, Molly decided as she hurried across the open space, the rapid tap of her cowboy boots sounding abnormally loud in the pre-dawn hush.  As she walked, Molly nervously scanned the area for potential threats with the ease of long-born habit, paying close attention to the patches of darkness.  The flickering orange and green glow of the parking lot's few fluorescent lamps painted everything with an eerie half-light.  It was a surreal blend of colours that cast odd shadows where none were, confusing the eyes and disorienting the senses.
"Something wrong, Billy?" John panted, breaking the kiss to give Sherlock a concerned look.
"What sort of symptoms?" Sherlock demanded, his curiosity piqued.
"Speaking of tests and samples…" Lestrade interjected, reaching into his pouch and pulling out the evidence bags holding Sherlock's collection tubes and tools.  He held up the bags and shot Sherlock a dark look, before passing them over to Donovan.  "Mr. Holmes was collecting these when I busted him for trespassing on the crime scene."
"Racehorses and eventing, John," Sherlock snapped.  "I like to see you name all the tools and tack that an English rider uses without consulting a computer first."
"Is he used to being blindfolded?" Sherlock asked from where he was carefully affixing the muzzle to Scotty's head.
"That's not what people normally say," Sherlock observed aloud, an involuntary flush rising in his cheeks.
He returned the music to the case and refocused his attention on the violin he held.
"What all did you do?"  John tilted his head, his curiosity evident.
John pursed his lips, then reached over to pull Sherlock's billfold free, his movements perfunctory, rather than lingering.  Clearly embarrassed.  Too soon then.  Sherlock took it with a grateful smile and handed the money over, being careful to obscure his license from John.
"What?" Sherlock snapped, annoyed at the interruption. His fingers gripped John's thighs as if he could rend the fabric obscuring him from his target with willpower alone.
"John!"
"My shift ended a couple of hours ago.  I felt like relaxing with a drink, plus 'Ride 'Em!' is the best place to pick up a quick hookup in Shiprock," John explained cheerfully, confirming Sherlock's deduction.  With a cocky smirk, John leaned forward into Sherlock's personal space, the scent of his aftershave and sweat flooding Sherlock's senses.  "And since tomorrow's Monday, and I took the day off, I can sleep in if I want," he added smugly.  "What about you?  What brings you to this neck of the woods?  I wouldn't have thought you were one much for bars."John commented, cocking an eyebrow and tilting his head to one side in a way that somehow managed to be both endearing and sexy.
Despite what the casual viewer might believe, some strategy was involved.
"You don't look fine."
"Obviously," Sherlock grunted, trying to glare up at John and failing miserably.
John's giggle was infectious and Sherlock found himself joining in.  It was strange, and yet oddly satisfying to laugh
"You want another of the same, hun?" the short, zaftig brunette waitress asked him as she walked by, her hands full of empty plastic tumblers.
"This is the same brother who's a cook?" John asked, moving around the table and out of Sherlock's way.
Their waitress returned, interrupting Sherlock's train of thought.  He accepted the proffered bottle with an absent nod of thanks and looked up to see John studying him with some puzzlement.  “Is that unusual?"
the muscles in John's arms and thighs contracting as he fought to maintain his seat, but fluidity of his motions made the struggle appear effortless.  John managed to keep his right arm defiantly raised to serve as a counterbalance and continue the smooth forward and backwards spurring rhythm he’d established despite the whipsaw changes in direction.
Sherlock sniffed the air.  He could detect traces of water, greenery and a faint whiff of something rotten; it was a combination he associated with the smell of the conservatory from his childhood.  The scent of organic decay struck an incongruous note amongst the mingled odours of wood polish, leather, old fur and the faintly acidic smell chemicals permeating Sterndale's office, because, contrary to his private expectations, there were no plants present, not even a Devil's Ivy or a Peace Lily.  Making a quick mental note of the idiosyncrasy, Sherlock turned to study the rest of the room's furnishings.
John tipped his head to one side, conceding Sherlock's point.  "Good point.  In that case, I'll meet you there."
," Sherlock thought, willing his mind back to coherence.  "
"Oh for God's sake, get down here so I can kiss you again!" Sherlock huffed sulkily, giving in to temptation and tugging on John's shirt.
John didn’t outright say "I told you so," but the wordless twist of his lips as he stepped forward was enough.  "Turn around so you can brace yourself against the table in case I have to start tugging," he ordered, dropping to his knees and coincidently putting his head level with Sherlock’s arse.
Caught up in his fantasy, Sherlock ghosted his right hand over John’s back, following the dips and curves of his musculature, shivering slightly.  The room’s air conditioning unit was cranked up in defiance of the environment outside, making the room feel chilly against Sherlock’s sleep-warm skin.  Fortunately,John radiated heat like sun-baked rock at dusk, and Sherlock shifted even closer, savouring the warmth.  His hand landed on John’s arse and he indulged himself by giving one cheek a sound squeeze...
Sherlock's persistence had finally paid off.  He could now stand directly outside of the pen, without Devil's Blaze screaming in fear.  It had been almost a week since the stallion had last tried to attack him through the rails.  Now it was time to move on to the next step: enter the pen, establish his dominance and gradually work his way up to being able to actually handle the stallion.
"Who?"  Sherlock asked, looking up from the reports he'd been reading.  He flicked an eyebrow in silent demand for clarification.
Sherlock, meanwhile, began to prowl around the room, half-listening to the vets' conversation and occasionally committing potentially relevant pieces of information to his memory as he continued to examine the contents of Sterndale's office.  He spared a glance at the prescription bottle label, noted that it wasn't one of the drugs that had been noted for performance enhancement potential and subsequently ignored it.
Their conversation had garnered several appalled looks when Molly had begun telling him about the equine necropsy she'd witnessed, and at least one couple had relocated to a different area when Molly had launched into a detailed (and enthusiastic) description of the intestinal lymphoma tumor she'd helped dissect.  Molly's obvious fascination with the topic had prompted Sherlock to offer up an anecdote or two of his own about the different types of tumors he'd seen over the years, including a squamous cell carcinoma on the inside of a horse's bottom eyelid (something an idiot novice vet had misdiagnosed as a fly bite), and an enormous sarcoid tumor he'd seen removed from the inside of a horse's hind leg.  That, in turn, had prompted another discussion about different types of cysts, tumors and lesions that could appear on a horse's skin, treatment options, and the different types of pus that might be expressed.
"Here we are," Molly said abruptly, bringing the truck to a halt and startling Sherlock from his mental wanderings.  "Welcome to the Triple C."
"I'm glad you think so because I...like you.  Quite a bit.  I would very much like to continue having sex with you," Sherlock admitted, feigning shyness.
John pursed his lips, lost in thought, before walking around to the back of the Humvee and opening the tailgate.  He spent a several seconds rummaging through one of the well-stocked medical kits he kept in the shell before standing up with a huff of satisfaction.  He closed the tailgate with a bang and then walked around to Sherlock's side of the truck.  "Here," John said, twisting the instant cold-pack he'd fetched to activate it.  "Oh, wait."  John leaned forward and fished a clean bandana out of his glove compartment.  He used to to wrap the cold-pack in a protective layer before proffering the entire bundle to Sherlock.  "Rest your wrist on this for a bit, yeah?  It'll help with the swelling.  I'm sorry, but I really don't want to give you anything for the pain until Mike sees you."
"Much," John agreed with a good-natured laugh, flopping down to lie beside Sherlock.  The small size of the twin mattress meant that they had to press together, chest to chest to both fit, but from Sherlock's standpoint, that was hardly a problem.
Lestrade also hadn’t been exaggerating when he’d mentioned that Johan Straker had a knack for picking winning bulls.  There were quite a few underground websites devoted to tracking particularly successful gamblers in a variety of sports and Straker’s name appeared repeatedly in connection to particularly lucrative bullrides.  Sherlock narrowed his eyes as he began calculating Straker’s reported earnings against the payouts listed.
"I see," Sherlock said slowly, refolding the letters and returning them to their respective envelopes. "I'll keep these for now."
Sherlock turned his head to study at the bull in question.  The bovine was clearly muscled, but he had no background frame of reference for determining what was considered desirable in a bucking bull's confirmation.  "What makes Bushwhacker and Yellow Face so special?" Sherlock finally asked, raising one eyebrow as he looked back at Baz for an explanation.
"No.  You shouldn't," Molly huffed, clearly not mollified in the slightest.
companion for somebody, (even though some might take offense at being considered a high-class escort).  After another moment to weigh the pros and cons, Sherlock decided to continue the joke.  Innuendo would help set the mood for his planned seduction, after all.
Sherlock pressed his lips together in feigned hurt.  John's eyes were twinkling far too much for him to resist.  "Fine.  I shan't," Sherlock sniffed, purposely giving John an opening.  He ignored the appraising look an eavesdropping passerby was giving him.  The wide smile creasing John's face was far more engrossing.
Sherlock's breath hitched.  He felt his balls tighten even further, heralding his impending release.  John growled once again, a sound of pure lust, and that was enough to tip Sherlock over the edge.  White-hot pleasure coursed through his frame, making him keen.  Dimly he was aware of John grunting suddenly, but he didn't pull off in disgust the way Victor would have.  Instead, John's mouth gentled him through the aftershocks, the plastic barrier between the two of them keeping the sensations from becoming too much.  Eventually, John let Sherlock's penis slip free from between his lips, to lay flaccid and soft against his cheek.
There were two small windows, one on the east wall, that would offer a view a distant pond when daylight was present.  The one facing south looked back towards the house, offering the same view as one in the cabin's main room.  Both windows were hung with the same black blinds and curtained in a dark red fabric patterned with small flowers.
John was all fluid grace and timing and compact strength as he rode, maintaining his seat with apparent effortlessness.  Even when he did get thrown, John landed with the technique of somebody with at least basic martial-art schooling.  He'd immediately rolled to his feet, obviously laughing, his boyish features ebullient with adrenaline and enthusiasm.  Sherlock had been especially enamoured with the video of John riding a bucking black gelding with a white blaze for the requisite eight seconds before jumping off, landing on his feet and waving his hat to the cheers of the adoring crowd.
"I didn't say that," Sherlock said, shifting again.  He purposely bit his bottom lip, noting John's reflexive swallow with private satisfaction.  "Just...if I tell one, you have to too."
"Oh?" Sherlock raised an eyebrow at John's carefully neutral response.  "The gossip on the ranch is that you almost punched him in the face, the last time the two of you met."
Sherlock blinked twice, unexpectedly impressed.  He'd deduced competence, but he hadn't anticipated a detailed response on par with his some of his own expositions.  He opened his mouth in preparation of asking his own questions, but Donovan spoke before he could.
John blinked, clearly shocked at the suggestion.  "What?!  Why on earth would you think that?"
During their drive, they had passed a small university—the West Texas A&M according to Sherlock's phone, and at least a half-dozen different churches of different Christian denominations.  The buildings were mostly boxy, one and two-story red brick edifices, some painted, some not, with brightly coloured canvas awnings overhanging the doors and windows.
John laughed.  "Fair enough.  If you cook, I'll handle the cleanup.  And dessert," he added with a wink, his grin growing when Sherlock ducked his chin, feigning bashfulness.
Sherlock listened with a half-ear, occasionally interrupting for clarification as John ran through the litany of tests he ordered and solutions he'd already tried, and nodding his approval.  Whatever else John Watson might be, he was undeniably a very good vet.  There were any number of things that could cause a horse to suddenly act out and John had already investigated the obvious ones: colic, contaminated feed, a poor fitting saddle and painful feet.  So far though, none of the information that John relayed contradicted his initial hunch that the problem was related to recent changes in Colonel's diet.
"Good boy," Sherlock praised him, deliberately pitching his voice low.  He stayed where he was, one hand out to the side in a neutral position, the other hovering over the stun gun he wore in the holster on his hip watching the stallion watch him.
"Billy," John groaned, "stop talking."  He stretched up, his strong fingers threading through Sherlock's curls and tugging gently, encouraging Sherlock to bring his lips back to John's own.
"I don't see why we're doing this," Sherlock grumbled as he finished the knot of his hated bowtie.
With a smirk, Sherlock tucked his mobile into his pocket and strode to the requested rendezvous point.
"How long has he been that way?" Sherlock asked, ignoring Lestrade's order.
"Mr. Scott?  Billy?  Are you still with me?"
“Hey!”  Sherlock heard behind him as he melted into the crowd and made his way to where John was exchanging handshakes and congratulatory back slaps with other riders, too busy socializing to be aware of Sherlock’s presence.
"Once I obtain a good sample?  Depending on my access to a lab and the speed of Blaze's progress, anywhere from several weeks to several months," Sherlock admitted, bending down to collect his water bottle.
"Nope.  Boots first," John ordered, moving to kick off his own footwear.
Sherlock mulled his brother's words, before nodding his head to grudgingly concede the point.  "True.   How soon does Ms. Ross want me to arrive?"  Sherlock asked, reaching for a pencil so that he could start making notations.
The explanation was delivered with an easy smile, but Sherlock was perfectly capable of detecting the scathing insult hidden beneath the jovial veneer.  The question was what lay behind the animosity.
“Stuff it, Ben,” snapped a woman who was easily six feet tall, blond and tanned enough to give John a run for his money.  “And cool your horses, Herb.  I’ve already got another two pots a-comin’.”
There was a mumble of voices and then John returned.  "She said that Colonel has recently started spooking at random, harmless items, like blowing leaves and waving grass.  She thought it might be because of a problem with his eyesight, but I'm not finding any evidence of a lesion or infection and my tests show his vision is fine, as far as I can tell, at least.  So...er...yeah.  I know that's not much to go on, but you have any ideas?"
Sherlock allowed his shy smile to become a full-fledged grin, making sure to flash his dimples in a bid to win over Molly's remaining skepticism.
Bzzzzz...bzzzzz...bzzzz...
"Uh uh," Donovan returned, her tone skeptical.  "According to the people I've interviewed, John Straker knew his way around horses too…and look where that got him?  I've read your report, Captain Lestrade, and I've seen the coroner's photographs.  I also spoke to the paramedics that were there that night.  From what it sounded like, only John Watson could have gotten a syringe into that horse without getting killed…he picks a fight with Doctor Sterndale, gets the other man fired, and then gets hired on as Candii Ross's new vet for the Triple C?  It's a bit amazing, really…almost unbelievable."
"Can you describe them for me?  Specifically the one that helped you?"
John gave him a half-hearted smile.  "The perils of being the younger sibling then, yes?"
"I can't say that I have," Sherlock sighed, pressing into John's hand like a cat.
"That you're a bit of a dick," the detective replied bluntly, "but that you get results that nobody else can.  You're also professionally ethical…it doesn't matter who's hired you, or how much they're paying.  If you find evidence of wrongdoing, you report it, damn the torpedoes and let the chips fall where they may."
Still blinking, Sherlock began to absently catalogue the faint, mingled smells of sweat and semen that surrounded the two of them.  Last night, he’d been too absorbed in the touch, the taste, the scent, the overwhelming sensation of being enveloped in John to appreciate his surroundings, but now, with the room at least partially visible, Sherlock began to study John’s bedroom.
In the background, Brenda's father looked murderous.  Whether it was because his daughter had created online social networking profiles without his knowledge or permission, or whether it was because somebody had bullied his daughter, Sherlock could not discern.  Either could be a possibility for a widowed father, perhaps feeling more protective than usual in light of his daughter's near-death.
Sherlock spared a brief thought of annoyed respect at Molly's curiosity, grateful that he'd taken the time to revise his website to match his current alias.  "I prefer to keep a low profile to maintain my clients' privacy," Sherlock explained, waving a careless hand.  "I've seen the publicity that other horse whisperers are subjected to…John Rarey, Monty Roberts, Buck Brannaman.  They're often the subject of documentaries and targets for reporters or animal welfare groups…Minimizing my online presence helps keep idiots away from my ranch.  It also reduces the number of idiots who contact me.  I don't do boring clients."
Sherlock huffed in exasperation.  Authorities were so tedious.  They never seemed to appreciate the lengths he went to to interview suspects, effectively doing their job for them.
"Tomahto, tomayto," Sherlock retorted dismissively, switching between the British and American pronunciations.  "There," he continued, folding the large square of fabric into a long strip, draping it over Scotty's eyes and knotting it firmly underneath.  "That should help keep him from panicking even more.  Lestrade, you lead him to the trailer.  And talk to him!  The sound of your voice and your scent should help keep him calmer."
wrote "i am going to bed. i would like to wake up to all the smut fics you have featuring praise kink. i want john telling sherlock he’s so good, he’s doing so well, he’s amazing, he’s gorgeous. givvvvve yes?  i am still so sad and lacking this thing.."  And I couldn't ignore an appeal like that!
an equine professional, John."
"Doctor Sterndale.  Hello," John replied, tipping his hat politely before straightening up in what Sherlock easily recognized as a subconscious effort on John's part to maximize his height as he extended his non-dominant, right hand to Sterndale in friendly gesture.
"If you're sure…" John began cautiously.
Harry Potter, ACD cannon, Firefly and more.  Geek points if you catch them.
Sherlock opened his mouth, preparing to start another line of inquiry, but stopped as they turned into a small car park surrounding a medium-sized, freestanding building built out of cinderblocks that had been painted a light tan.  A few scraggly-looking flowerbeds filled with native shrubs and ornamental rocks adorned the front.  Three bilingual English and Spanish signs, each one mounted to an exterior wall above the building's doors and windows, identified the business as a medical clinic.
"Easy," Sherlock murmured, before bringing his palm down in a smooth sweep, hard enough not to tickle, but light enough not to cause pain.  "Easy...easy...no!" Sherlock scolded loudly as Devil's Blaze suddenly pinned his ears back and whipped his head around, his intent to bite clear.
.  Thumbing the textbook open, Sherlock could see where somebody, (likely Molly if the colour was any indicator) had carefully highlighted certain passages in bright pink marker.  'Evisceration of the abdominal, pelvic, and thoracic organs,' began the first chapter, accompanied with colour photographs of the contained viscera.
Closing his eyes, Sherlock exhaled and flexed his feet inside his new boots.  The boots were the one item that he hadn't had time to break in properly, beyond ensuring that they no longer looked, or smelt, brand-new from a box.
"Your deodorant.  It's decidedly masculine.  An interesting choice of scent for a woman, I must say."
"Sorry about that!" The speaker, a generously curved Korean woman joked.  The click of her stilettos echoed throughout the room.  "I wanted to make sure that everybody was awake and paying attention for the next part of our program.  I hope you've all enjoyed your Chianti and fava beans," she continued.  "You'll have to pardon our substitution of baked salmon and Chicken Kiev for the main course.  Liver is surprisingly hard for our caterers to come by in sufficient quantities to feed five hundred people!"
"Got it in one," John confirmed with a nod.  "The main gate—the one you can't see because it's in the other building—is the out gate.  That's the one they want the horses to run through after they're done with their ride so they can get their saddle or bareback rigging taken off.  The cowboys will run the same training exercise with each herd as they bring em' in and sort them out for competition later.  There's a guy inside with a list of which rider's supposed to ride which horse and they'll transfer the individual horses to the bucking chutes closer to competition time."
"Of course, here."  John pulled it out from his pocket and passed it over with a smile.
"Let’s get him to that empty exam table over there before he completely passes out."
John pursed his lips as he looked at Sherlock sideways, visibly trying to decide what cuisine to offer next.  "Okay...tea or coffee...and it sounds like you aren't in the mood for heavy salt or grease.  How do sandwiches sound?"
John pursed his lips.  "Okay...so...how does the green cowboy hat come into it?"
Sherlock took John’s cock deeper into his mouth and hummed, wordlessly conveying that John most certainly could and would if Sherlock had anything to say about it.  Two seconds later, Sherlock was rewarded with the feeling of John’s semen pulsing to fill the condom and John slowly collapsing in an uncoordinated, boneless heap.  Sherlock grabbed John’s arms to steer him down, ignoring the condom that slid off to land with an ignominious splat in favour of pulling a limp John Watson into his lap.  Without bothering to undo his zip or buckle, Sherlock thrust his left hand into his own jeans, imagining it was John’s instead of his own.  A few quick, firm passes with the heel of his palm and Sherlock was overtaken by his own orgasm.  The tingling rush over his entire body had him falling sideways with John clutched tight.
Sherlock looked over his shoulder to observe the stallion.  Devil's Blaze looked calm enough on the surface—no foot stamping or rearing—but he kept raising his head to scent the air, his ears flicking back and forth in agitation.  Sherlock turned back with a grimace.  "To answer your question, Ms. Ross, progress continues to be slow.  I still haven't been able to touch him, though he did let us hose him down.  I spent an almost an hour in the round pen with him and he spent the entire time either running around the perimeter or threatening to charge me."  Sherlock flexed his fingers, fighting the urge to take out a cigarette.  "I'm continuing to observe him.  His body language continues to alternate between terrified and vicious without any action on my part."
“It’s a game we’ve been playing for years,” Arthur said, catching sight of Sherlock’s puzzled expression.  “It’s a lot more satisfying to gamble with kisses than money; this way, there are no losers.”
Sherlock stepped out on the porch of his cabin frowning as he rubbed his gritty eyes with one hand while the other maintained its death grip on the mug full of sugary, caffeinated sludge that was masquerading as coffee.  It tasted terrible, not exactly surprising, considering it was brewed from pre-ground, frozen beans.  Irene (the snob) would be horrified, but it was still a stimulant, and since he'd burned through the last of his stock of patches
The chips—
"Son of a
“Another bill...and huh.  It looks like this package is for you, James, rather than yet more chemistry equipment for His Nibs.”
said ten," Sherlock replied, not looking up from the preliminary toxicology report he was rereading on his phone. "I know for a fact, however, that you don't have any meetings prior to ours and I didn't feel inclined to waste my time waiting. Your coffees—plural—are beside your computer—" Sherlock said, waving one hand to indicate the two large paper to-go cups "—which I have not touched, you will note.  There's a sausage roll too if you're wanting some protein since I've been informed that it is not technically possible to exist on coffee alone."
…” His tone was unmistakably laden with innuendo.
Somebody—possibly a tech or even possibly John had taken the time to wash the blood off the gelding's coat.  The previously-gory wounds were all treated, covered here and there with patches of protective gauze or spray-on bandages.  Small patches of Scotty's fur had been shaved away so that monitoring leads for various vital signs could be attached.  The hobbles had been removed, as had the blindfold, but a lead rope and heavy-duty cross-ties with easy-unhook latches had been attached to the halter.  A small video camera, no doubt attached to monitor somewhere was relaying continuous visual information.  Sherlock nodded in silent approval at the restraints and observation setup.  The ropes were short enough that it would be difficult for Scotty to rear or risk flipping himself, while the sensors in the monitoring leads ensured that any changes in pulse or oxygen saturation would be noted immediately.  The video footage could also be potentially useful; he would have to speak to Candii Ross about the possibility of adding one to Devil's Blaze's paddock.
"I'll say," John breathed.  He stepped forward, licking his lips, and leaned in, his intent to kiss clear.
"That sounds really pretty.  Did you grow up there?"
There was a soft murmur of voices before John returned.  "Ah, that would be a no," he supplied.  "She's been riding him at home."
"An imprecise description," Sherlock replied, waving a dismissive hand, "but essentially yes."
"Obviously, John," Sherlock retorted with an eye roll.  "Even a moron would have noticed the way you unconsciously clenched both fists when you spoke her name."
“I HOPE Y’ALL HAD FUN AT OUR CAMP EVENTS THIS AFTERNOON!  IF YOU MISSED OUT ON THE GOAT DRESSING, BAND OF HORSES, OR THE WILD DRAG RACE, DON’T WORRY!  TOMORROW’S EXCITING AGENDA INCLUDES STEER DECORATING, MUTTON BUSTIN’ AND AN EGG STOMP!!!!  IN THE MEANTIME, ENJOY THIS HIT FROM THE IN-COM-PARABLE DAVID BOWIE WHILE YOU WAIT!!!”
Sherlock smirked involuntarily at Lestrade's observation.  It was an understatement, if anything.  Victor had once made him watch some sort of ridiculous film about two American men in badly-fitted, generic black suits saving Earth from some sort of extraterrestrial life form bent on stealing a galaxy-containing bauble.  Though the science seemed utterly implausible and the film was replete with unnecessary, over-the-top special effects, he'd been amused by the summarization of humanity as a whole consisting of 'dumb, panicky dangerous animals with a few intelligent individuals mixed in'.  "That is certainly an…apt description," Sherlock commented.  "I've observed such crowd behaviors myself, on numerous occasions.  What age and breed is your current partner?"
Sherlock pursed his lips.  That was a new piece of information.  He would have to needle Mycroft about it later.  "The only person?" Sherlock asked aloud.  "Mr. Straker doesn't have any heirs?  Relatives?"
And then there'd been John's internet search history.
"It's fine.  I've got it."  Sherlock stepped forward and checked the pickup truck's bed.  It was empty except for a coil of rope and a large tool box that had been bungee-corded to the side.  "Is the back all right?" Sherlock asked, looking over his shoulder to where Molly was still standing.  At Molly's nod, Sherlock shrugged off his laptop case and handed it to her.  "Hold this for me."  Without giving her a chance to respond, Sherlock bent down and lifted his luggage, heaving it over the truck's side with a grunt and laying it gently in the bed.
Sherlock bit his tongue, suppressing the impulse to bluntly inform Donovan that she wouldn't be capable of detecting a case of high-level equine sabotage if it painted itself purple and danced naked in front of the police station at noon.  The inner voice whispering "bit not good," sounded oddly like John's.  "It might be something small, like nicking a tendon so a rival horse goes lame," Sherlock began, holding his hands up for demonstration.  "Or jabbing a hoof with nail or other sharp object to cause an abscess.  Both are common occurrences and rarely fatal, but they can keep an animal from competing."
Out of habit, he reached over and picked up his mobile to check the time.  It felt oddly heavy in his hand and he had to blink several times to clear the sweat from his eyes before he could finally read the screen. When he did, one of his eyebrows rose in almost scientific interest.
Molly tilted her head to one side, her expression scrutinizing as she watched John walk away.  "So...what were you talking about?" Molly asked with artful casualness.
The overflowing rubbish container full of to-go cups was an obvious start, as was the picture of Donovan shaking hands with Maya Angelou.  He could also see a few biographies for what were no doubt other prominent civil rights activists or law enforcement individuals.  He'd actually read the one about Bass Reeves.  There was a photograph tucked off to one side of Donovan's desk featuring a small tortoiseshell cat sleeping in a purple planter shaped like an oversized coffee mug.  It didn't appear that Donovan spent a great deal of time gardening, so the choice of flowerpot was probably intended as a joke, especially since it appeared large enough to hold one day's worth of Donovan's beverage of choice.
"Fizzy Simpson, professional barrelman," the man introduced himself.  He thrust his right hand out towards Sherlock.
"Because he was a tight-wad that'd wear his boots and jeans out until the Pope decided to canonize them."
"No," Sherlock said, gritting his teeth so they wouldn’t chatter.  "Just cold."
"Of course I didn't; I'm not a moron," Sherlock replied with a sneer.  "I took the liberty of mentioning the encounter to Detective Donovan.  She said she'd look into it.  She also implied that she might have some other potential suspects to investigate," he added. The last bit wasn’t strictly accurate, but it didn’t hurt to pacify aggravated clients.  Mycroft had taught him that much.
John’s breathing was ragged, like a man who’d just across a field or wrestled a horse into submission: wordless testimony to Sherlock’s fellatio skills. Trembling fingers reached up and ghosted through Sherlock’s curls, causing the other man to purr in delight at the pleasure of being petted.
"Uh...right.  Okay.  Just...uh...make yourself at home," John ordered, indicating the red chair, his posture still oddly formal.  "I'm going to grab that shower," John continued, jerking his thumb in the direction of the flat's only other door.  "I'll...um...be back in a tick," he announced unnecessarily before ducking into the curtained-off corner.
"Then get there
I also want to do a quick shout-out of appreciation to you, my lovely readers.  Your expletives, your squeeing, your long, thoughtful comments, your feedback, your subscriptions, your kudos, your encouragement and your support make it a pleasure to share
"Good."  Mike reached into one of the oversized pockets of his lab coat and pulled out a small pad of paper.  He scribbled on it, the sound of carbon-copy paper crinkling loudly in the room before ripping off the top sheet and passing it over to Sherlock, along with the promised printout.  "There.  Bill, stretches and follow-up instructions.  You're all set.  Any questions?"
“Keep pouting, and you’re gonna get a pillow in the face.”  John’s voice was sleep rough, and the husky rasp of his voice was having the opposite effect he was probably intending.
"Sherlock," Mycroft ground out.  "Your personal observations aside, Lady Frantz remains married to one of the racing aristocracy's most socially prominent and politically significant clients—"
"True," Molly replied, relenting, her expression visibly softening.  She paused, obviously trying to decide how to phrase her next question, her fingers drumming on the steering wheel in a nervous tempo.  "I know Ms. Ross hired you and all...but I was curious, so I looked you up online.  I found your website…'The Science of Equine Deduction' I think it was?"  At Sherlock's nod, Molly swallowed once, before continuing.  "It's pretty basic...just your contact information, a few photos of some very pretty horses, and something about how you deduce a horse and correct behavioral issues accordingly.  No client testimonials or anything.  Why's that?"
"What was that?  I didn’t hear you," John said, his voice taking on the resonance of ‘Captain Watson’.
Crossing back, Molly swallowed hard, her nose suddenly registering the coppery tang of blood and the stench of ruptured organs amongst the other smells cigarette smoke, manure and something that smelled a bit like burnt cloves and citronella.  Mindful of the stallion's speed, Molly edged closer, pulling her pocket torch out of her pocket as she did so.   The stallion snorted, backing up into the corner of the stall with flattened ears as she shone the small but powerful light over the horse's body.
and hit 'send' with an emphatic push of his thumb.  Giving Molly a fake smile, Sherlock tucked his phone back into his pocket before pulling his own shoulder harness across his chest and fastening it.
Sherlock wasn't certain why, exactly, the collie had taken to following him around the ranch, but her presence remained constant.  He wasn't one to assign human behaviors to canines, but both Old Wayne and Candii Ross had commented on the way the collie could frequently be found watching Sherlock from the shade of a nearby barn or tree, or else 'helping' him by sniffing at the clumps of manure and soiled hay he raked free from the stallion's pen.  Bonnie had even taken to invading his cottage  some evenings, keeping Sherlock company on the porch while he smoked and then joining him inside, much to Sherlock's bemusement.
"Well, good luck with that," Molly replied with an encouraging smile as she hefted a bucket full of grain.  "I'm going to go give this to Toby.  See you later!"
Sherlock blinked.  Charlotte Dujardin—considered by all to be
Sherlock widened his eyes in silent agreement, even as he struggled to unclench his hand from its death grip around the grab bar.  The screams of a panicked horse were clearly audible through the rolled-up windows of the cab.
Donovan blinked, apparently thrown by the unexpected segue, before shrugging.  "Since I've done some research when I was handed this case, probably a bit more than the next cop—Captain Lestrade doesn't count.  A bunch of guys with testosterone poisoning try and stay on top of an out-of-control horse for eight seconds hoping to strike it rich.  If you ask me, there are less-stupid ways to prove how manly you are."
"Are you vegetarian?" Molly's voice was muffled.  Over the phone, Sherlock could hear the sounds of clanking and thumping, as well as the chatter of voices in the background.
"And for you?" the bored-looking teenager was standing behind the glass asked, directing his inquiry towards John.
"What?  Uh...yes.  Yes I am.  Why?"
John flashed a look that clearly communicated his opinion of Sherlock's intelligence, but didn't say anything beyond, "it's your arm."  Tucking his hands into his pockets, John turned to look past Sherlock's shoulder to the exhausted horse watching them warily.  "And how is the Devil?  As evil as ever?"
"The transcribed ones are, but I tend to jot down my initial impressions in longhand—too much time spent without easy access to a laptop during deployments," John explained.  "They aren't nearly as tidy but, well, I thought they might be useful."
John blinked, his expression shifting from 'charming' to 'professional' in response to her decidedly non-flirtatious manner.  He coughed, clearing his throat.  "Twenty…maybe thirty minutes?" He glanced down, double-checking his estimate against the military watch he was wearing on his left wrist.  "Captain Lestrade asked if I'd swing by and take a look at Scotty for him," he continued.  John tilted his head sidewise to indicate the stall's occupant.  "Greg said he was acting a bit spooky while patrolling the bull-riding crowd yesterday, which is unusual for a police horse."
Candii Ross was a bully.  Rich enough to afford what she wanted and self-centered enough to make life miserable for those that opposed her.  That she was not well-liked by her staff was obvious, but she was shrewd enough to pay them a solid wage and provide amenities and benefits that made leaving or being fired an unattractive alternative.  Her suspicions about her ex-husband, as far-fetched as they seemed, merited at least a cursory investigation.  Revenge by an ex-spouse on a hapless animal was depressingly common, as he'd found out in the racing industry.  There were also her suspicions about the animal rights activists.
"No, not anytime soon," Sherlock confessed, "but I am reasonably confident that he will no longer need to be euthanized as a threat to humans."
"Hey, um…do you ever get any free time?"
"So…where to now?" John asked, rocking back on his heels.  "The pavilion to find a seat?"
John's expression was so earnest, so
One of the pickup men nudged his horse closer and leaned over to undo the flank strap buckled around the bronc’s withers.  As the leather fell to the ground, the bronc reared and took off running, oblivious to the two ropes still wrapped around its neck.  Fortunately for the horse, the pickup men were right behind on their own mounts, keeping the ropes taut enough to prevent leg entanglement, but loose enough for the horse to not accidentally strangle itself.  Hatherley, meanwhile, was slowly limping along the arena wall, holding his injured arm against his chest and pausing every so often to bend over like he was about to be sick.  Sherlock felt his own stomach clench in sympathy.  There was a piece of folklore he’d heard before arguing that failure to vomit could be considered ‘proof’ that a bone wasn’t actually broken.  In his own experience, pain tolerance was more likely a factor, and it was evident that anybody competing in rodeos had a very high pain tolerance indeed.
Each kick and shift of John's body was perfectly timed with the gelding's twists, turns, jumps, and dives.  Even from the distance, Sherlock could
"Yes.  Why?"
“Cilantro?”
"Did you go with him?"
Donovan shrugged.  "I'm no probate lawyer, but if he doesn't have a will and the lawyers can't find anybody else to give the money too, it'll pass to the state of Texas."
"I can feel you staring," John complained sleepily, opening one eye and distracting Sherlock from his silent reverie.
"John?" Sherlock asked warily, suddenly uncertain.
"Your temperature’s a bit high, but not dangerously so," Mike reported when the machine beeped.  "If you’ve been walking a lot, that can explain the temperature increase.  Could you remove your shirt so I can take your blood pressure?"  At Sherlock’s hesitation, he added, "I prefer to get as accurate a reading as possible and clothing under the bp cuff can impact systolic blood pressure anywhere from ten to fifty mmHg."
Sherlock blinked and shook his head, before handing him the requested bag.  He watched as John rubbed some over the saddle swells.  The insides of John’s chaps where they gripped the saddle got the same treatment.  Setting the bag aside, John began rocking forward and back again, occasionally interspersing side-to-side rolls.  With effort, Sherlock wrenched his attention away from the enticing curve and flex of John’s muscles but the other riders were similarly occupied.  Fortunately, John’s rucksack caught his eye and he dragged it closer.
“Don’t be an idiot, John.  Of course I’m accompanying you.”
"Thank you," Sherlock said, dousing his fries liberally.  He blew on the piece of fried potato to cool it off and popped it into his mouth.
"Surely not," Sherlock rumbled, tiling his head and giving John an inviting look from underneath his lashes.  "You've been abroad...you must have had some adventures...your friend, Mike Stamford, mentioned something about you tripping over a dik-dik?"
Sherlock glared down at the red Solo cup he was holding from under the brim of his cowboy hat, trying not to grimace at the bitter taste its contents had left behind in his mouth.  He wasn't much for beer.  He vastly preferred uppers to downers, (Mycroft's opinions on the matter notwithstanding), but he'd given away his last cigarette in an effort to build rapport with a stablehand earlier.  Even if he hadn't, the madness that had prompted London's 2006 Health Act and the subsequent ban on indoor smoking had spread as far as the United States.  There were several prominently-placed signs threatening all sorts of creative punishments for any individual caught lighting up inside the premises.  When he
"Whenever I agree to look at a horse for retraining," Sherlock began, "I do my best to get as complete a picture as I can first.  Unfortunately, I'm having a hard time getting a straight answer out of Candii Ross.  She keeps talking about Devil's Blaze as if he was some beloved pet that can do no wrong, rather than a business investment," Sherlock rolled his eyes, his eyebrows rising briefly with the motion even as his lips flattened with disdain.  "But I'm sure you're aware of what I'm talking about?"
We didn't do much beyond hand jobs and frottage."
"It's fine John," Sherlock said soothingly.  "It's—" Sherlock paused for a moment, trying to think of a polite word that Mrs. Hudson would use to describe the tiny space.  "—cozy.  Very intimate.  Now go take your shower so we can eat.  I'm starving," he added, dropping his voice and incorporating just the faintest hint of a leer into his suggestion.
It was the work of but a few moments to swab Scotty's nose and mouth, collecting samples of saliva and mucus, talking softly all the while.  A few more minutes of work filled several of the vacutainer tubes with blood.  It was fortunate that the tubes came already filled with the necessary coagulants and anticoagulants, Sherlock thought as he slid the filled and capped vials back into his boots; they would preserve the blood until he could get it to a lab for testing.  He spared a moment's wistful thought for a urine sample, but there was no way for him to collect one.  No matter.  He would get copies of the urinalysis that John Watson would undoubtedly run later.
"Saturday evening, then?" Sherlock asked, leaning back and deliberately resting the rim of his coffee mug below his lower lip to draw attention to his mouth.
Molly pursed her lips in thought, her expression unhappy.  "I've seen a lot of cowboys get trampled over the years," she said slowly.  "It...kind of goes with territory.  Accidents happen and sometimes people get hurt when an animal panics...but…"  She paused, obviously trying to decide how to phrase what she had seen.  "Have you ever seen a predator like a coyote that's been trampled by a horse?"
"Ah."
"No, it's fine."  Sherlock replied, jerking his head sideways in an attempting to realign his focus.  He carefully extended his fingers, then forming a fist.  His arm twinged with the movement, but the pain was a dull throb in contrast to the stabbing ache of earlier.
"Yes."
"Oh," Sherlock said inanely, his mind's eye suddenly full of visions of being held against John's muscular body, of holding John's warm hand in his own, feeling John's thighs brush against his...
John frowned.  "I owe you a favor, Billy.  It's the least I can do since I apparently kept you from eating earlier."
“Hey, ye’re not supposta be up there!”
John shook his head, straightening up and dropping his left hand back to his side. "Tempting, but no.  I'll just take a 'Lousy Hunter' on whole wheat; extra hummus—no olives or celery, please."
"So why?" John pressed.
The purple-haired medic approached.  "Sir," they began, their tone polite, yet firm.  "I can see you’re worried about your friend.  I’m here to help.  Can you tell me what happened?"
Devil's Blaze whinnied and reared at the unfamiliar noise.  With a frown, Sherlock pulled his phone out of his pocket and stared down at the screen, paying scant attention to the frightened horse that had begun running circles around the pen below him.  The number flashing on the screen was unknown, but that was hardly unusual for new clients.  Still, he didn't want to risk compromising his cover.
John shook his head.  "Surprise me."
he'd antagonized any of them to that extent.  Yet.  The waitress was a dead end.  The only person he'd spent any extended amount of time with was John Watson.
"One thing puzzles me, though," Jon said slowly.  "You said that you saw one of the pickup men's horse's trying to rear during a competition?"
"Help yourself," Sherlock replied, shoving the plate across the table with a grimace of disgust to conceal the flash of arousal John's words had sparked.  He was supposed to be simulating attraction in
"What the?"  Breaking into a run, Molly dashed down the corridor, skidding to a stop in front of a battered stall door.  She gasped in horror at the sight of the Triple C's prize horse.  The normally laid-back stallion was almost unrecognizable.  His coat was saturated with lather and his mane was a tangled mess of knots.  His eyes, so often half-closed when he was being groomed were wide and staring.  The dark-brown irises were completely ringed by red.
"Fine," Lestrade growled, folding his arms and looking away.  "But for the record, I think you're barking up the wrong tree."
The small space would have been bearable, comfortable even, but every inch was decorated in what Mrs. Hudson would have charitably described as 'kitsch': a large spotted cowhide, serving as a rug covered the floor.  A coat rack made from horseshoes and a weathered piece of wood hung beside the front door.  A few pictures depicting sunsets, horses running and idealized landscapes hung on the wall, their frames made out of the same weathered wood.  A battered sofa sat in front of the fireplace, the ugly brown upholstery somewhat disguised by several throw pillows and the large blue, white, and black woven saddle blanket draped over the back.  For some reason, somebody had elected to hang an old saddle and bridle on the wall.  Several chintzy china figures of horses and cowboys sat on the mantel.  Above it, centered in the pride of place was an enormous, ten-gallon cowboy hat painted with the stars and stripes of the American flag.  The phrase "In God We Trust" was inscribed in careful, repeating letters around the brim.  It was flanked by two other flags: one was the American flag, the other a simpler pattern, but also in red, white and blue.
‘Give your brain and body time to heal, Sherlock.’
In the cab he couldn’t stop marvel at the movement of Sherlock’s hand. Objectively, he knew that coma patients responded somehow even though they could never wake up and yet... When he saw it, it gave him hope. A glimmer of hope after nothing but dread.
‘Come on, Rosie. You’ll be late. You will see each other tomorrow!’ John had to interrupt in the end.
‘Hello, Pa.’ she beamed at him. ‘Is it okay that I slept here?’
John suddenly refocused on the reality again and saw a concerned face of a nurse. ‘I’m sorry can I call you John? You weren’t reacting to ‘Dr. Watson.’’ She said and smiled at him.
‘Yes, essentially. He can wake up tomorrow. Or in a week or in a month...’
Rosie was silent, just nodded again. Usually, she was very talkative and had a response to everything but now it was obvious that she was sorting that out in her head and was preparing. She was afraid. But that was okay, John thought. It meant that she knew it wasn’t going to be easy. The fear meant understanding, too.
‘And Rosie, I… I cannot imagine what it…what it was like. For her.’
At that, John inhaled sharply. The ring.
Sherlock softened a bit. ‘Yes, I do, Bee. I do like it very much. You are… cute (oh god how he hated that word, but… it was kinda true) in them. But don’t you think that it’s too childlike? Shouldn’t you wear something less extravagant?’
When Rosie returned from school in the afternoon, Sherlock was still asleep. John had been thinking about how to break the news to her and settled on simply telling her right away. He hoped she wouldn’t be upset because she’d missed it. But as for John, he was glad that she did, when Sherlock was so confused and…well not himself.
‘No need.’ John said empathetically. ‘You’ve been awake for just a couple of days, love. Give it time.’
suggest, a suit?’ Sherlock sighed loudly. Of course he wouldn’t suggest a suit, but something less cute and childlike wouldn’t do harm.
‘Yes. But Rosie’s future achievements at that school are hardly determined by her first day.’
And now Rosie cried and John, too because
--------------------------------
, thought John. He really didn’t know how to behave either and he felt even more inappropriately with Rosie here, for some reason.
‘Listen, sweetheart. You mustn’t be surprised when you see all the wires that are attached to Sherlock. They just help to monitor him and keep him alright.’ John said while looking at Rosie intently. Rosie nodded seriously.
He also called Mrs. Hudson, who agreed to walk Rosie to school from the hospital. When he was speaking to her, he realised he didn’t know anything about Sherlock’s parents. It wasn’t like them not visiting Sherlock or to visit with Mycroft, unnoticed. Maybe they didn’t even know. But now it was quite late in the evening, so he thought it would be best to think about what to do the next day.
‘Yes, we will go now and come back tomorrow.’ Mrs. Holmes added and tried to reach for Sherlock’s hand, but he avoided her touch.
‘It was a couple of hours ago. I actually think he might wake up again pretty soon.’
When they arrived at the school, Rosie was excited. She couldn’t wait for the other children. She always enjoyed playing with others at playgrounds. But she was also prepared for boring classes because, obviously, she could read and write already.
‘Boring.’ She said.
‘He’s on the ICU now.’
‘And that would be?’ John teased Sherlock to lighten the mood.
‘It certainly confirms that he is not in a deep coma anymore as does his responsiveness.’
‘Okay. It’s fine. Never mind.’ John tried to assure him. ‘Everything will be alright now.’ He gripped Sherlock’s left hand, then kissed the wedding ring. ‘I love you.’
At that, John started laughing like he hadn’t for quite some time. ‘As Your Highness commands.’ He said finally and kissed Sherlock’s forehead. ‘But be prepared for some sort of a welcome dinner or something from Mrs. Hudson. You’ll have to wait for the sex.’
He ran through some narrow allies and then he saw him. Sherlock. His husband, his everything. Lying on the dirty, cold floor. Motionless. John pulled out his phone and called an ambulance while running to him, only barking out the address and telling them to go inside the old factory’s biggest building.
‘Well, yes. That’s true. But it’s definitely more hopeful.’ The doctor said. When John didn’t say anything, he continued. ‘Anyway, I will leave you for a while and then we will start with the CT scan.’ And he went away.
‘John. How are you? How are you coping?’ Mrs. Holmes asked and John thought that he really didn’t know how to answer.
‘Yes, yes. I’m going. Sorry.’ He managed to reply. He said ‘good night’ again to Sherlock, then to the nurse, too and headed home.
Oh. Of course. Mycroft. John hadn’t even thought about texting him, but then, Mycroft knew their every step. And it was so typical. John arrived at the hospital a few minutes after 7 a.m. which meant Mycroft had to be there so very early. He worried about his brother, but god forbid somebody saw him like that.
John sat back in the chair. Sherlock seemed to be in a good mood, which would probably get worse throughout the day, so John thought now was the time.
John moved his hand across Sherlock’s back and caressed it while a smile creeped on his face. Of all the possibilities as to why the ring was missing from Sherlock’s finger, this hadn’t occurred to him. And he found it rather sweet. But Sherlock continued.
“Sherlock?”
‘Yes. But he’s just sleeping. He is definitely back with us.’ John smiled and when Rosie came near him, he sat her on his lap.
‘-doesn’t mean that he will wake up, anyway.’ John interrupted him because he didn’t want to hear any vaguely encouraging talk. He knew how it was.
‘Right.’ John sighed more than said but Sherlock had heard him anyway.
John didn’t even realize that the room felt silent until Rosie appeared at his side. ‘Papa?’ she whispered and reached for Sherlock’s hand, which John released. ‘Did I play it well?’ she asked quietly and Sherlock, miracle of miracles, moved his fingers and pressed them against Rosie’s palm. She smiled while tears spilled from her eyes. John put an arm around her shoulders and hugged her. He was smiling, too and even though he knew this still didn’t mean Sherlock would recover fully, he felt happy.
