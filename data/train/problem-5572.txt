Steve’s fingers trailed up Tony’s thigh and over his hip, forehead pillowed gently on Tony’s shoulder so he could watch his hand stroke over the curve of Tony’s waist.
With some difficulty, Tony detached the front and back plating for his thighs from the main skeleton of his suit, sliding them over and under Rogers’ thighs to help warm him up. The lower legs were easier. Soon he’d half-covered Rogers in the heating elements of his suit, helping to speed up his thawing process.
“Hey… look… you’re refracting light.” Tony realized, watching the warm light cast a soft pink sheen through Steve’s shape, not nearly enough to form a solid outline, but it was there, and he could see the curve of Steve’s back, his broad shoulder, soft hair.
The mansion on Malibu Point had been under reconstruction since before they had started dating.
“But I think it’ll be worth it. Ideally I don’t wanna hurt you more than doing your neck hurt last week.” He explained. “Can you work with me and let me know if it gets worse than that? I think the more we work on this together the better we can get it, and the less pain you’ll be in over time.” He said, wondering what Tony was hearing, wondering if he trusted Steve or if the message that arrived was ‘if you let me keep hurting you and paying me for it, you’ll feel better eventually’.
As Steve worked, he felt like he couldn’t pinpoint any sites of origin for the man’s pain. He was almost convinced now that the real problem lay elsewhere, not in Stark's back.
As it turned out, there was nothing juicy to be seen. These were just people who didn’t want their homes and medical problems leaking to the press and Steve could understand that. The last thing he ever wanted was to make a client feel unsafe.
“Slow.” Tony gasped, feeling the tip of Steve’s cock push against his entrance. The strange edge Steve’s invisibility brought to the equation translated into a strange thrill that Tony couldn’t quite comprehend, but he was more than happy to roll with it. This was his husband and feeling him was more than enough.
The day flew by and Steve managed to get home by 7PM. There was no way he was going to Stark Tower after a day of work, smelling like sweat, massage oil and the New York subways system. He showered and changed into a fresh uniform, treating himself to a cab ride to avoid dragging his equipment across town again.
Stark gave a shudder and a soft relieved moan a few minutes in. Steve could feel he’d been holding it in. He didn’t comment on it, simply continuing his work, over Stark’s upper back and down to his ribs. When Stark leaned away a little, Steve softened his touch and soon they were back on track, Stark reacting and Steve adjusting to him.
“Anything I ought to be aware of before we start?” He asked. Usually he preferred to do a 5- to 10-minute intake conversation with a new client, but with Stark being so secretive and the quick changeover Steve felt a little out of tune with himself and his usual procedure. It was strange, losing the upper hand was something he experienced occasionally when working in a client’s home. Even if they were just people with various pains who needed his help, Steve couldn’t quite forget what influential members of the high-society they both were.
Before he could get up or push Steve away, Steve linked their hands.
“When you’re ready, I’ll come with you.” Steve promised, pulling Tony closer in the water.
“I’m happy to, you don’t need to do that.” Steve said but she waved him away and Steve realized she’d already worked this out in her head.
Her back took some work, but she ended up melting into the table, almost completely relaxed by the time he’d worked her over. The deep moan when he stared working on her feet was entirely expected to Steve. Stark laughed on the sofa, genuinely delighted by it. Steve had almost forgotten about him.
“Easy.” Stark warned when Steve worked over his lower back and Steve softened his touch even more, working on him ever so gently now.
“Can you tell me what’s hurting?” Steve asked, worried about causing pain. He had only meant to straighten him up the slightest bit to get a full picture of his back.
And yet the serum had endless potential in healthcare, Tony could only imagine what this stuff could do. The things it had healed Steve Rogers’ broken body from were mind-blowing. How could Tony withhold this from the world?
The comment earned him something that could be an amused or annoyed huff, Steve wasn’t sure.
it, sure, but he hadn’t given it any thought since he’d left Obadiah to put his parents’ affairs into order after their death.
And it was a hell of a position to be in, wasn’t it? All that traveling, the suits, the heels, the meetings, the long hours and the desk work. Steve would be surprised if she wasn’t wound tight as a coil. He wondered what happened to her last massage therapist, he was sure she had to have had a regular one before.
“Hey, it’s alright, Cap, it’s okay. You’re fine, you’re safe. It’ll stop hurting soon.” Or at least Tony hoped it would. This man was alive. He was really properly alive. This wasn’t some ghost of a response.
“If I have to be naked, you should be too.” Steve told him, his breath warm against Tony’s lips. He pulled the shirt off Tony, backing him against the bedroom wall.
“Your body, your rules.” Steve assured him and followed Stark to the sofa at a respectful distance, watching his back as he went. Stark was bent forward a bit, as if protecting himself. Steve figured he must have had a recent injury to his ribs or collarbone maybe. The man seemed fragile to him, stiff and tense. Steve found that he really wanted to help him.
Tony pointedly doesn't look in Steve's direction. Steve's being too quiet about all of this, and Tony supposes that it's so Tony doesn't feel pressured at all about them being in his family's old house. He might just be curious, too, considering how Tony admitted she was part of the reason he would keep running away from their fate.
Tony nods, more to himself, and he releases a deep sigh. He was right, then, he was getting in the way of something else.
"I'll make pancakes!" Clint hurries out, and Tony just zones him out as he thinks about it.
And even though it's going to be difficult, and Tony knows it's as hard on Steve as it is for himself, he's starting to think that maybe they will be okay after all.
"Fine. You win this argument." Steve decides, but Tony is frozen where he stands and continues to stare at the blond's back when the taller of the pair doesn't seem to have any interest in turning around.
Tony really is missing something important here, isn't he?
"Let me take you to bed." Tony says, and Steve snaps his head back in Tony's direction with surprise lighting his expression. It nearly makes Tony laugh, because is it really surprising to want to sleep next to your husband at night?
The stool topples over from the level of exertion, but Steve doesn't pay that any mind. Steve's lips are demanding as they press against his own, teeth clashing against his own in an act of desperation. Steve's arms are tight as they grip onto his waist, and Tony's only barely aware of Steve lifting him up. Steve's lips don't pull back even a hairline of a distance away as Tony's deposited onto the top of the worktable, and Tony ignores the way the toolkit is digging into his back. He can't really really focus on anything but the feel of Steve's tongue rubbing across his own. Steve bites at his lower lip, sucking on it roughly as he uses his knee to nudge Tony's feet apart. He tucks himself between Tony's parted legs, and Tony shudders as he feels Steve's erection pressed against his own growing one.
"I can take care of myself, Steve." Tony murmurs as he slowly sits back up, but it might be the wrong thing to say when Steve's body tenses. The blond isn't looking in his direction at all, and he's instead focusing on leaning down to pick his clothes off the ground. It's so tense and awkward and Tony can't help but wonder what just happened, "Steve? What's wrong?"
"So you think that now that he has coding and super powers that he can control a program that wanted to kill him?" Sam asks, an eyebrow raised in skepticism. It's the truth too. Ultron wanted Tony dead more than anyone else.
"Oh man." Scott breathes out, and Steve can read his expression well enough to know what his teammate is thinking.
Steve looks at him for another moment, and then leans forward and wraps his muscled arms around Tony, and he's practically squeezing Tony against him, pressing soothing kisses to the top of the brunet's head, "I know, and I'm so proud of you. Thank you for trying, sweetheart."
But his body is heated and yearning for more. He can't pretend he doesn't want to feel Steve's lips on his.
There's a reason everyone advises against marrying strangers, he thinks.
"Fucking coffee snobs." Bucky scoffs, but it sounds more amused than offended as Bucky takes a long sip of his coffee. Cautious, Tony does the same. The silence that falls between them is neither hostile nor amicable; but like they're trying to feel each other out
"No." Steve replies, and his hand slowly releases its grip on Tony's.
"Woah man, are you good?" Sam calls out, and Tony just stays there. He's pressed against the countertop, his hand gripping onto the surface to keep himself steady.
"Home?" For a second, he looks like a lost child, unsure of his place in the world. He turns his head just slightly, his gaze trailing over the Iron Patriot armor longingly, "There's no home without him."
Steve seems to snap out of his anger instantaneously, and he steps away as soon as Tony finishes his sentence. His head is dropped now, out of view, and Tony feels like he's done so much to hurt a man that deserved better than he could give.
After Afghanistan and the torture he'd gone through there, showering had been a problem. For months, he couldn't even go into the bathroom without having a panic attack. It still hits him occasionally when the shower spray turns on, but he's learning to handle it better.
He could fly without his suit anytime after that.
streets, mad science, clones, bitterness and press conferences and civilian casualties. The war
They were wonderful tools, Tony told the Illuminati, extraordinary, strange, messy, so very tempermental, so hard to quantify, or use.
he told himself, against every instinct in his body that rebelled against the thought. Not when he took them away, hid them through the entire war. It wouldn’t be right, to give them to the friends he hadn’t betrayed, but Tony was selfish, and he kept the one. Tony wore black gloves with his uniform, and a ring underneath his gloves. The ring was too large to hide under them, but it hardly mattered if he always kept his hands under his gauntlets, his face under a mask. He had an entirely new title and never felt more like he was made of metal.
Steve nodded, still looking at Tony and not down at what was in his hand. “I did like it. Thank you Tony.” A frown seemed to grow on his face and Tony rushed through possibilities on what he could have possibly done wrong this time. “How did you get ahold of this? I’d have thought the government would have gotten it.” Or Osborn hung in the air.
None of them would know what that meant, would they? They wouldn’t care enough to think about the—the implications. He knew that. He had to be right about that.
Hand, V: It was that ring. That’s where he got that power. We need to find out where he got it. (Dialogue lower--almost inaudible) How to stop it.
Tony’s stuck in the moment where Steve reached out his hand, finger bare, EMP hidden in his hand. Tony reached out his hand and the ring gleamed violet and Tony convulsed broken on the ground. That, he decided, was when it all began to end. Steve has never looked at Tony like he hated him before—that’s why it took him so long to recognize the look on his face, Tony told himself. Anyone else, he would have known right away. Tony grew to recognize what hatred looked like in all his friends, hardened his heart and his mask and watched his family die.
“Oh,” Tony blinked quickly. “I’m hallucinating again.” Steve made a noise Tony couldn’t identify and covered his face with his hand. “No, Tony. You’re not.”
“Tony, you’ve been under for a while,” Pepper said, when he asked about the time.
Green was the most useful, the Avengers decided. Everyone on the team could use green and it all went slightly different for each of them wearing it—Peter found himself flying straight through buildings when swinging, Jessica could suddenly turn invisible, Steve shielded even more in battle, wrapping green light around anyone who might have been hurt, Luke surrounded himself with energy, Sentry could heal himself, and Tony would suddenly have several more hands in the lab that would just create, create, create. Orange was the least. None of them could use orange. Not a single person who touched orange could use it.
could have healed him. Tony hasn’t taken the violet ring off since Steve died. He’d healed so much from it, repaired bullet holes like they were never there, sealed over burns, healed in way doctors and sometimes even magic never could. He’d wondered, darkly, in a whisper, in the back of his mind, if it could bring back the dead. He wondered what would have happened if he’d fallen to his knees beside Steve’s body, bloodstained shield against his chest and tried. Tony stared at the ring. The Steve in the corner of the room looked at him like he wanted him dead.
He stood stock still as the rest tested the violet ring, only loosening when Black Bolt was the only one to even make it twinge. At least he could still be useful. Tony was tired of people taking things from him.
The forgiveness of Captain America counted for more than most. It counted for more to Tony than anything, but it meant something to the rest of the country as well. Tony and Steve publically working together was one thing; that meant shots from cameras and think-pieces posted online, editorials in the newspapers, rants and conspiracy theories on television and in the Daily Planet, what it meant was a public softening to both of them, a lack of planetary disasters luling people into forgiveness. A governmental clearing of Tony’s name improved his public persona, but it wasn’t until the day, nearly a year after his hospitalization that Steve approached him, asked him casually if he wanted to get something to eat that the vice grip on Tony’s heart started to loosen and he could breathe.
Strange glanced down at his finger as if it personality offended him. “Yellow is, apparently,
any noise, but maybe if he made noise the buzzing in his ears would stop and when was
The Illuminati had taken individual rings, divided them the same way they divided the Infinity stones. Well, not exactly the same way. They each took a stone and never talked about them again. This was clearly a more acceptable subject.
Osborn thought maybe he’d have to be insane to use that ring.
personal fear, however, this was not an exact translation.” Strange liked the yellow ring when they’d tried each of them on and Tony felt a sudden wave of horror. What was violet?
“Could you…” He wet his lips. It would be a bit before he could get out of here. It would be longer before he could go back to work. And it would be a very long time before anyone would trust him with his armor. But, even so. “Do you think you could get ahold of that—of some things Osborn took?” He met her gaze and prayed he wouldn’t have to tell her more. She stared back and, slowly, slowly nodded.
Footage unavailable. Dialogue retrieved.
“Sorry, just thought of something funny.” The blonde man stopped by Tony’s room and Carol followed his gaze. Steve still hadn’t visited, since the first day.
Stark stared at the corner of the room at something clearly only he could see. Osborn’s eyes were slits as he waved a man in.
The Avengers decided early on the rings should be communal. Tony locked them up in the Avengers tower, but if anyone wanted one to use, even if they weren’t an Avenger, they only had to ask. This would not be the case for long, but that was then and then it was.
Everyone talked to him differently. Rhodey told him about PTSD, support groups he’d been to and had recommended to others. Natasha talked about captivity, casualty, about the loss of freedom and how it drains one, as Bucky stared silently at the door. Platitudes from his employees, comfort from Henry, news delivered in bits and pieces from Carol, a sharp nod and a reluctant “welcome back” from Maria, were all comforting, in their own individual ways.
I think about Steve. It was not an answer he wanted to say out loud, but there are no secrets from Xavier. “Ah,” he said, and went back to the ring, “I don’t think,” he said, very carefully, “this works that way for me. Not exactly.”
”Translation for the blue ring was rather simple actually. It represents hope. Hope. Steve loved that ring. Tony closed his eyes. Steve and Peter, both of them couldn’t get enough of it.
The one fortunate side effect in Osborn’s current level of power was that he needed to have at least some plausible deniability when it came to committing horrifying acts in defiance of the laws of man. There are murders one can get away with as a giant flying goblin and there are murders one can get way with as the head of a spy organization and there is little overlap in the venn diagram between the two. Fortunately for Peter Parker.
You the ability to instill great fear. Or, Norman Osborn launches his reign of terror.
“The violet ring is called the Star Sapphire. The translation is a bit strange, it’s a bit unclear
Why wouldn’t these people leave the room, so he could scream?
Strange’s explanation was absolutely fascinating, and Tony would have been riveted if it hadn’t entirely involved magic. He hadn’t realized how many questions he’d left in the back of his mind about what exactly made up the rings. How they were made, if he could replicate them, and he realized he hadn’t spared a thought to them in at least a year. Where had his curiosity gone.
In this world, he woke up in a hospital bed with Pepper on one side of his bed and Rhodey Rhodes on the other, hesitation on each of their faces, and asked about Norman Osborn.
Charles Xavier seemed to take an interest in the indigo ring. “If nothing else they do, at the very least, seem rather useful, don’t they? Shielding, healing, flight—all without your suit, Tony?” Tony wanted to shift a little but managed to keep his back straight. His voice came out robotic when he said, “I’d be nicer if any of the other ones worked for me anymore.”
with security codes. He built a ball that would only open for his thumbprint, left it in a safe hidden in his office. Sue Storm screamed at him for corrupting, for manipulating her husband, threw the white ring at him like she couldn’t stand to keep something Tony had given her. It hit his chest, rolled down onto the ground, and now he had that one too. He’s had too many factors to deal with, quasi-military organizations to run, former friends to avoid, nightmares to sink into, to many points and worries to expend so much energy to the rings, but he did need to deal with them. They were too powerful to leave locked up in SHIELD, too much danger into falling into the wrong hands, even though Tony could hardly tell who the right hands were anymore.
“Aww Normie’s doing this? Didn’t know he cared.” Parker didn’t take off his mask, but the disgusted look on his face was easy enough to visualize. “Should I be worried?”
Osborn tried to use the violet ring for what must have been the fiftieth time. Stark leaned up from the wall, watching him, or something else, with rapt fasination. This was not the first time. This would not be the last time.
Steve looked, smiled just a bit when Tony reached over to him, before his eyes wrinkled with confusion as Tony reached out for him. Tony was struck with the idea that it had been such a long time since they’d touched that he nearly faltered before he regrouped, finished what he needed to do.Tony tried not to think about metaphors, about the concept he could in any way give Steve hope. “Here.” The blue ring sat in the palm of Steve’s hand. “Osborn got ahold of it, but he couldn’t use it. Not sure I should have it, but, you liked it, didn’t you?”
You won’t be able to use it, you know, Stark said. It’s not in your nature. It’s not why you do what you do. Stark’s face was bloody, but he smiled, a secret sort of smile. He never said anything past the first time. Today was no different.
Tony’s thankful for his voice modifier. His voice would be so hoarse otherwise. “They all work differently. You have to think about…different things to make them work right.”
“Each of the rings, they all,” Tony coughed, re-evaluated, rephrased, “while you were gone,” not dead, never dead because Steve wasn’t dead, “Strange translated that box. We—I mean—this group met up,” Steve tensed and Tony soldiered on, “took the ones that worked, but, we found out, apparently, they’re based on—well it’s stupidly magical nonsense who even knows how these things actually run it defies all explanation.”
“I had it the whole time. Osborn,” Tony would not give that man the satisfaction of tripping on his name, “he tried, but he couldn’t use it. Not once.” Steve still looked slightly confused. No, not confused, he understood what Tony was saying. Concerned.
The white ring stayed with Sue Richards nee Storm. None of the Avengers could use it and she certainly could so why not give it to someone who’d find it useful.
You have great love in your heart. Or, the Illumani takes ahold of another power they do not understand.
Unfortunately, that didn’t stop strange, near constant attacks from villains on a almost continuous basis. “What is happening?” Parker landed on his feet in the Baxter building, followed a moment later by Sue and Johnny Storm, having just fended off Bullseye, Moonstone, and Daken who had turned a perfectly normal afternoon of fighting the Rhino into a near bloodbath before the Storm siblings showed up--which they had been doing a suspicious amount of lately. Parker has had to deal with at least four attacks from these three particular HAMMER employees along with one from Venom, two from people he’d never even met, and a strange cop who’d tried to shoot him instead of the active gunman he’d been webbing up. A grand total of all of these had been stopped by various members of the Fantastic Four and Parker pressed for answers early.
Wanda doesn't die quickly. The monks and Stephen won't allow it; and while Steve hates the idea of having a teammate that's just claimed a statement that had his entire heart clench in the memories it brought, keeping her alive would give them answers.
Tony is covered in motor oil; much like he always is when he's working in the garage. There's a tired air around him as he slugs into the kitchen, but he looks
"You do know that we are bonded now, don't you?" Steve asks, and Tony wishes that the taller would just
Steve's arms are secure around his waist as Tony's lifted off the floor, and the blond is as gentle as can be as he places the slighter onto the bed. Their eyes are fixed on each other as Tony kicks his shoes off and backs up to the headboard. Steve manages to toe his own shoes off, and the heat radiating off of him is intoxicating as he crawls over the bedsheets. He surrounds Tony in the best way, hands resting beside the brunet's head, legs parted to straddle Tony at the hip and bringing the friction they had felt earlier back with a vengeance.
"It doesn't matter, he chose his bed and now he will lay in it." Wanda spits, the disdain dripping from her tone.
Tony leans forward in contemplation, hands tucked under his chin and his eyes glinting as an entirely fake smile crosses his expression, "You've been betraying me since you showed up in my company as Natalie Rushman. I'm used to it by now."
"Training tomorrow." Steve tells his team with the same short and to-the-point tone he'd used on Tony earlier.
If only he hadn't been such a coward back then, maybe things could've ended up differently.
James Rhodes is still there, sitting at the counter and sipping away at a mug of coffee. He seems amused by the antics of Steve's pack, watching as Clint and Sam argue over the last piece of bacon. Steve should send them out for groceries just so that they can get a few minutes of peace. Wanda and Natasha are speaking quietly to Bruce as they prepare more cups of tea for themselves, and Thor is much too involved in his breakfast to even look up. Bucky is stock still, sitting right where he was with his head bowed and his metal hand curled so tightly around the mug that it'll either bend or break at the grip.
say in a moment like this.
Pepper is silent for a long while. Tony imagines her tucking a strand of hair behind her ear, or running her fingers through the ends of her messy bedhead. She's been like this since they had first met as children, and yet always so good at maintaining a poker face when it mattered.
him. The rest of the world's bullshit can wait for later.
He assesses them calmly, his eyes flitting over them and his lips curled back into a frown like there's something out of place he just can't put his finger on.
have given up their livelihoods to follow him across the country.
"Are you saying you'll make a scene in a public place like this?" Tony asks, his face carefully blank and his eyebrow raised. If she wants to be an ass, so does he.
Tony's not used to having someone like Steve take care of him. The last to have genuinely cared for Tony was the butler, Jarvis, who had been sent away shortly after his mom had passed. It's foreign, and he feels guilty for wanting more of it. He's reluctant to move, though, because he knows getting up now and taking a break is only going to hinder his ability to create.
Bruce shoots Steve a look, and his eyes look incredulous. Understandably, everyone else looks as unimpressed with Tony's indifference as Bruce himself is. What James has told them seems true; while everyone else is impressed to no ends with Tony's skill and dedication to his work, Tony himself continues to feel like he's
"Then I hope you like Virginia because I'm staying for the rest of the week." Tony responds easily, and he turns his attention to the screen so he can pretend to block out their questioning eyes.
it is to be around the blond haired alpha. Maybe fate knew what it was doing after all.
"I'm going to cum." Steve says, breathless against his swollen lips.
Steve's expression softens from the rage it was holding onto, but just slightly. He looks confused and maybe a little hurt as he says, "You said your name was Anthony."
He doesn't mind it entirely, though the swarm of butterflies isn't making the awkward trip any bit comfortable; but Steve's still looking down at him and holding him like he's precious.
"Cell phone blocker." He orders, and he puts the briefcase down onto the ground.
When Tony finally relents and takes the cup of tea, the sound of a camera shutter has his eyes narrow and focus onto Rhodey. The man's shit-eating grin is back, and Tony wants nothing more than to smack it off of him.
Tony's lips brush against Steve's, calm and slow, tasting the salt from their mingled tears but pushing past it to pour all of his affection into Steve's mouth. One soft lick is all it takes for Steve's mouth to go slack, and with a tilt of his head to deepen the kiss, Tony's tongue slides in and caresses Steve's. It's not as fierce as some of their earlier kisses, but with this, a barrier that had been up between them previously is lost. Tony continues pushing forward until he's straddling Steve's lap, and although they're both on the floor, neither of them seem to really mind.
Steve's gaze softens incredibly, and there are tears swimming in his eyes as he raises a hand. Tony hates that he looks so hesitant to reach out now that he reaches his own hand out and presses Steve's open palm against his face.
Obadiah runs Stark Industries with Howard, and while Tony doesn't love the guy, he can appreciate the elder's business savvy.
"What would we even agree on watching together?" Bruce asks with a scoff of amusement, and he's waving a strip of bacon in the air.
Tony's claim isn't entirely fair, of course. If the arc reactor was really keeping him alive at the time, Steve wouldn't have attacked the way he did. But on the other hand, with Tony going for Bucky with everything he had? He could've easily killed either Steve or Bucky and they were the ones that were lucky enough to stop him and get away.
"We've met." Both men answer, and the metal suit around Tony disappears back into his skin as he steps forward and drops himself in a chair at the dining table.
"Is it not too late to stop him now?" Steve finds himself asking, his words coming out in a croak from the dryness of his throat.
That causes Tony to pause mid-step. He turns around, his face set as he stares at Clint. Then, he tears his eyes away from the blond to look at the bot. Two seconds later, he bursts into laughter with a hand on his stomach as he folds over. All he can think of is Dum-E following guests around with a fire extinguisher. He'd be as bad at being bad as he is at being good.
Peter shook his head. "I used to. Smile!" He leaned in close to Steve and pointed the camera at the two of them. The camera clicked and Peter immediately turned it back around to see how the picture had turned out. Steve ruffled Peter's hair. When he met Spider-man at that airport two years ago, he had never expected to become as fond of the kid as he was now. Maybe if things went well with Tony, he could officially become Peter's second dad. Steve smiled at the thought.
The doors flung open. A single SHIELD agent stepped into the room. He stood there a minute, looking around at all the cells. A blacked out gas mask hid his face. The walkie talkie on his shoulder crackled. He held it close to his chin as he spoke. "We're all good here. Everyone's accounted for. No need to send backup." As soon as he got an 'Okay' from the person on the other end, he typed something into the control panel. All the energy fields lifted. "We have five minutes until all the security feeds are back online."
"You have shell shock. You've been acting differently ever since the Chitauri. You had that panic attack, and now you're having nightmares-"
Bucky had decided that morning that he was going to take Tony out to lunch. So he could have an honest to goodness fresh meal for once.
"Think the big one is the mom?" Clint asked, looking back at the smaller dragon still perched on the log.
"Who's we?" Tony swirled his drink with a straw.
"What are you doing here?"
Steve smiled, "he looks like a good man. Do you have any pictures of your parents?"
The trees opened up into a small clearing. A cabin was in the center of it. It looked as if no one had used it for awhile, with the vines snaking up the sides of it, and the weeds that had overtaken the lawn. One of the windows was smashed, the drapes now fluttering outside the house.
"Peter, it's not what you think!" Tony jumped back.
"If I can't have you, then nobody can," Venom lashed out, slicing through Peter's shirt and drawing blood.
Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed!
Tony Stark did not need the Avengers.
"You sewed my mouth shut. Why should I trust
Meanwhile, Tony sat alone in his workshop. He leaned against the wall, a bottle of scotch between his legs. He brought the bottle to his lips and took a long gulp. The glass he had been drinking from shattered about an hour ago after he had thrown in against the wall. Tony muttered to himself while his bots hid in the corner, frightened of their drunken father. He wasn't supposed to be drinking. Not with his skull still mending. Pepper would probably scold him if she could see him now. But he didn't care. He needed this drink like he needed air.
"He called me a toaster!" Tony roared.
"You're Tony
"You're bossy."
"No. You gave yourself the most dangerous task," Rhodey crossed his arms. "Wouldn't that job be better suited for someone with actual armor?"
"This is very different from swimming, Tony!" Peter countered. "Where are the headlights at?"
"Eyes on me, Shellhead," Natasha aimed a kick at Tony's ribs. He jumped out of the way just in time.
"He put on his costume and left exactly 23 minutes, and 50 seconds ago." FRIDAY clarified.
"I am Tony Stark," said man snapped back. "And we really need to get out of here!"
Security footage started playing. It was of Justin Hammer's murder, which happened in his own home, right before he went to bed that night. Iron Man showed up and blasted a hole through his abdomen. Tony's blood ran cold. Hydra had stolen the plans for the Mark Six. But that wasn't the mark six that had killed Hammer. It was the forty-six. Iron Man's current model. The robot on the screen looked up at the security camera, its eyes glowing menacingly in the dimly lit room. It raised its repulsor and shot the camera.
Iron Man crashed back down a bit later. The bot that had grabbed him was in pieces. By the looks of it, a few other bots had attacked him while he was airborne. His right leg was badly damaged, as well as his shoulder and part of his breastplate.
"I've done better than my own father. So yes, I think I've done an okay job so far." Tony shrugged. "And I'm talking about the actual raising of the kid, like making sure he gets enough to eat, and reminding him to wear a jacket when it's cold out. And teaching him how to actually talk to girls instead of just sputtering like a fish out of water. I've done a shitty job of mentoring Spider-man as Iron Man. But we all already knew that."
"I do not!" Tony let go of the mask so he could shove Peter back into the bathroom. "Put on some regular clothes!" He slammed the door shut and leaned against it, not letting Peter leave.
"But it wasn't," Peter said softly. Tony had known his father? Why hadn't he ever mentioned that before?
"Spider-man! Fall back! This is an order! Do not engage!" Captain America yelled, "repeat, do not-"
"He accused me a messing with his spider sense and is convinced I'm a threat."
"Where's he going?!" Bucky yelled. He was leaning against the pilot's chair, looking out the windshield. The rain made it difficult to see their surroundings, but the red and gold robot led the way. He was flying at breakneck speed, desperately trying to put as much distance between him and the Helicarrier as possible. Falcon and Thor were flying ahead of the jet, quickly gaining on the robot. Iron Man glanced back and automatically increased his speed when he saw the Avengers tailing him.
"That's what everyone says! But then they move my organs around and take out the stuff that's unnecessary and they change my body however they want! Every time, they fuck it up more and more!" Peter screamed, wrapping his arms tightly around himself. The symbiote reminded Peter of the time Iron Man had electrocuted him. Peter tried to tell the symbiote that Tony hadn't been in control, that it wasn't his fault.
Bucky pulled his hand away. "He does have a heart."
"He dumped me," Tony cut him off. His eyes narrowed, "we're not together anymore."
"By morning," Thor reported. "Come, sit with us!" He held his arms out, "this television is most entertaining!"
"Calm down, Junior Bird Man." Tony held up his armored hand, "I'm not dying. I'm in danger of dying, yes. But I am not currently dying. There is a difference."
"I have to agree with Rhodes on this one, Tony," Steve put in his two cents. "Besides, it's not really fair to put him under house arrest."
"Please tell me you're here to free us. The food sucks ass," Sam leaned against the force field, arms crossed.
"We just got here..." Peter groaned.
"No!" Bruce said a bit too harshly. He swallowed and lowered his voice, "no. We don't know who we can trust."
Iron Man laid one of the drawings out on the coffee table. His metal fingers clinked against the glass as he smoothed out the creases. It was a drawing of Wall-E. The tiny bot was flying through space, holding a plant in its claws. Tony couldn't help but smile at the doodle. He and Steve had watched just about every robot movie they could find. Although that had kinda stopped after Ex Machina had scared the living shit out of Steve. They would still watch their favorites from time to time, though. Steve's was Iron Giant. He liked the underdog kid and his friendly giant. Tony liked Wall-E. He saw himself in the tiny bot who was trying his best to do that one job he was created for. Wall-E took quite a pounding in the film, but he kept moving forward, desperately trying to get that plant to where it needed to go. Iron Man traced a finger over the lines of the drawing as he thought about just how alike he and the little bot were.
"So? It's about the experience!" Bucky grinned. "Come on, let's do it!"
Three and a half hours passed and the Avengers were still no closer to finding the Venom. They didn't even know where to start looking. Fury had hundred of agents searching like their lives depended on it, but nothing had turned up. Yet. Clint and Natasha were all for just attacking Osborn and getting Peter back by force, but even Fury agreed that that would be a bad idea, considering they didn't know exactly who or what they were dealing with. Bruce Banner was still at large, so for all they knew, the Hulk could be waiting to snap Peter's neck the moment the Avengers breathed in his direction.
"I made Peter cry."
"His biological family rejected him. Did you know that?" Pepper went on. "He was never good enough for them. He worked his ass off trying to be good enough for you people." She gave Steve a sharp look. "You don't deserve him."
Tony’s eyes lit up. Spending time with Bucky had been one of the things he fantasized about when he had been held captive. Bucky was still his best friend, and he had missed him dearly. “Yeah! Give me a sec!” Tony fluttered around the workshop, looking for his shoes and coat.
"Of course. That's your job as leader," Steve gave him a reassuring smile and clapped him on the back. Spider-man gasped in pain, his ribs felt like they were on fire. "Sorry, are you okay?" Steve's eyebrows knit together in worry.
Steve frowned. "Aren't you connected to his armor?"
"You're his best friend. Figure it out." Rhodey eyed the rest of the Avengers clustered around the couch. Once Pepper arrived, she could distract the others with food or other means. Pepper always knew what to do.
"Really? Funny." Fury zoomed in on one of the photos. The person had been shot through the gut by a repulsor. There was no other explanation for that type of wound. "Because I beg to differ." He flipped through the images one at a time, each of them bearing injuries caused by repulsors. "Not many people in the world have access to repulsor technology. If I'm not mistaken, there's actually only one. And I'm looking right at him." Fury laid his hands out flat on the table as he glared directly at Iron Man. "You know what else I find funny?" He motioned to the screen behind him. "I find it funny that all these people used to be against Tony Stark. Looking for a bit of vengeance, are we?"
"He's not here. If your gonna do something, do it. Or leave me alone." Peter shouldered past them and practically threw the pizza into the microwave.
"So what's the deal with you and Iron Man then? Friends with Benefits?" Clint elbowed him in the ribs.
"Not anymore. His cybernetic enhancements mean that he can fully pilot the suit without my help," the AI explained. "I used to be connected to it as a precaution. I was disconnected before he left for his mission."
"Okay, okay. Fine. Just don't let it roam the tower. Someone could step on it," Tony threw his hands in the air.
Steve shifted onto his elbows, looking down at his hand on the covers. “That looks amazing…” He said softly. Tony could just about make out his smile when Steve looked at him.
“Last time anyone got that close they tore it out of my chest. If you touch this thing…”
“I can do your kind of pain.” Tony assured him. “Last week helped already, if you can do that for everywhere, I can stick out some pain in the sessions.” Steve understood. The constant chronic level of pain Tony was in had to be wearing him down, he was happy to accept an hour or two of more intense pain if it made the constant buzz of daily pain go down.
“Can I see?” He asked, holding Tony’s gaze.
Taking his eyes off the ocean waves, he pressed his lips and nose into the sun warmed skin of Tony’s shoulder, breathing in the familiar scent of his skin, his arm wrapping around Tony’s middle ever so gently. He didn’t want to wake Tony, not really. The man had been exhausted even before he’d picked Steve up, and he’d been utterly drained but finally looking happy by the time Steve had washed his body down gently in the shower after hours of plane sex and talking.
“Next weekend.” Sam confirmed, giving him a dazed smile. “Take care of yourself, Steve. Try not to get too rich.”
"Can't. I got that late-night client." Steve said regretfully. He hadn't seen his friends for quality time in weeks.
Tony reached for him, clumsy and uncertain, even though Steve hadn’t moved.
He wondered what all made Stark anxious. He remembered Stark telling him he wouldn’t lay down because he couldn’t take pressure to the ribs, but he had a feeling that wasn’t all.
Tony wondered for a moment, if maybe today was the day he would go insane. Madness had always seemed within reach.
Steve thanked him, undoing the latches of his carrier bag again and setting up his massage table. He set out the oils on the counter of the bar and laid fresh towels from his backpack on the massage table, putting paper around the head support.
He knew in a roundabout way that Stark Industries was still funding them, it came up in the annual budget review. By now it was tied to multiple international research projects. Scholars from universities around the world were catching a ride into the icy hellscape, and in turn SI was credited in the acknowledgement sections of countless peer reviewed articles. It was a win-win.
I can't thank you enough for your kind comments! They really motivate me and give me such a massive boost of happiness whenever I get a notification email. I hope you liked this interlude. More to come soon!
“Yeah, that’s her.” Tony said. “Can we just… let’s wait a minute until she’s here.” He decided and Steve nodded. “Sure thing.”
Steve didn’t hold back, the sheer sight of watching Tony come undone by just his hand was enough to drive him to orgasm. He came between Tony’s legs, holding his partner tightly through it, his face pressed against Tony’s skin panting desperately.
“You’re the professional.” The man agreed and Steve smiled, stepping back from the table to let Stark get on it. The man didn’t remove his shirt. “Alright. I remember you mentioned your ribs last time. If you find that you do want to lay down, I promise I’ll be very careful around them.” He said as he put his warm hands on Stark’s back.
It was 11:30 on a Friday night. He hadn’t looked forward to dragging his table onto the crowded Friday evening trains full of drunk party animals.
He stroked his hands up the man’s back and down again in a soothing manner, feeling the slight reduction in knots and tightness. After a long time in pain, even a little relief could go a long way.
“Thank you for telling me, I’m really glad I get to try and help at all. That’s a lot of trust, I appreciate that.” He stood up, holding out his hand to help Tony up as well. “Let me help. Let me really try to help you.” He asked, heart beating faster when Tony took his hand and let Steve pull him to his feet. Tony’s hand was cold in his.
Stark didn’t look at him. “Tony is fine.” He said, surprising Steve with a tone that almost sounded as if the thought of Steve calling him Mister Stark was ridiculous at this point.
He pressed himself against the length of Tony’s back, one thigh sliding between Tony’s legs when he could feel Tony stir ever so slightly. Steve kissed his shoulder, nuzzling and kissing to his heart’s content.
When he glanced over, he saw that the man had fallen fast asleep on his table. Miss Potts followed his gaze, smiling as well. “Looks like you tired him out.” She smiled.
“Always causing me trouble, aren’t you, Rogers?” He said, using the armor’s glove to scrape some of the melting ice off Roger’s front. The ice had weakened so much by now that massive chunks fell off at once, uncovering parts of the body in one fell swoop. Tony had to rush to catch Rogers’ body before it could go down with the chunks of ice. “Jeez Cap, going to give me a heart attack.” Even with the armor it wasn’t easy to lift the man, his legs still partly encased in ice as none of the heaters were aiming at them directly. Tony lifted Rogers, ice and all, onto the morgue slab that had been removed and brought up in preparation of transporting the Captain to the freezer there.
Steve moved his hands across the man's back, trying to treat more systemically this time around, rather than asking Stark for specific areas to focus on. It was a little awkward with Stark sitting up, and Steve couldn’t do a lot of his best techniques, but he was working around that as best he could, working on massaging out the largest muscles first and loosening the man’s shoulders and neck second.
“No!” It came before Steve could even pose the question.
“Nothing, don’t worry about it.” Stark replied and Steve made a conscious effort not to snort in amusement. He was literally here in order to worry about it.
“Not right now.” Tony added when he saw the look on Steve’s face. “But soon.” He admitted, leaving his sentence trailing off, open ended to invite Steve’s thoughts.
At 10PM sharp, the elevator doors opened, and Steve heard the distinct clicking of heels on stone. “This looks like a treat and a half.” Came a woman’s voice, soft but clear in the wide-open area.
“Okay well… is there any way I can work around this area? I think if we loosen your chest muscles and do some gentle exercises, we could really decrease your pain and increase your mobility.” He said, sitting back, realizing he’d gotten closer and closer to Tony’s chest as he examined the device.
“That sounds amazing.” Steve’s timer started buzzing in his pocket. “Shit, time flies, huh?” He rushed to Sam’s sink to wash his hands before fishing out his phone to turn the alarm off. “Next weekend.” He confirmed when he came back, watching Sam sit up slowly, his body looking much more relaxed.
Steve met some new clients, which was always nerve-wracking, but Steve ended up feeling great about them and he found his diary pleasantly full. New York City was the capital of stressed-out people in needs of his services and Steve was all too happy to provide them.
“You’ll want to set up for Pepper.” Stark said, watching as Steve swiftly unpacked the cushioned table, seemingly thinking about it. Steve didn’t push or coax. He really wanted the man laid out properly for examination but pushing it wouldn’t help either of them.
About 30 minutes in, it became apparent that Steve wouldn’t be abruptly dismissed. A content silence fell over the two of them. Steve didn’t know what was causing the man all this pain. He wished he had free reign to properly work on his back, on the table where it was easier to see patterns, but Steve understood that allowing this much was already a big deal for Stark. He realized that it was sheer dumb luck he’d managed to talk Stark into allowing him this close.
“You know I carry your cards.” Steve assured him, patiently loosening up Sam’s glutes.
Stark seemed to relax more this time. Steve didn’t feel the same spring-like tension that had made Steve feel like the man had been prepared to flee from the situation during their first session. This time he even got some vocal responses.
Tony’s moans became more frantic, as Steve continued to stroke him, and Steve wrapped his other arm under him and around him to keep him still and close, soaking up the near frantic pants as Tony tried to draw his pleasure out and became overwhelmed by the sensation.
Was that normal? Did frozen corpses bleed when thawed? Tony didn’t know what to do. A part of him wanted to call for backup, to find some scientist or doctor on this ship who knew more about anatomy than Tony did. At the same time, he didn’t even want to imagine what people might say about him if he did this. If he implied to anyone that this body might not be dead, and he was wrong people would call him insane. Even worse, if he was right… who knew what would happen to Steve Rogers.
“Good afternoon, Mister Stark.” Steve said, soft so as not to startle him out of whatever string of thoughts had him wearing down his carpet.
Life had been hectic lately, full of business travels for Tony and days spent in Washington to help out with SHIELD business for Steve. They had barely seen each other, and sometimes not even been able to speak on the phone thanks to being in such different time zones that their schedules completely overlapped.
“Fine.” Steve sighed, stripping the shirt off.
“Hi, I’m Steve.” He said, trying to break the ice quickly. There was something hesitant about the man’s whole demeanour and Steve briefly wondered if Stark had known that he was coming.
“I only do massages. No happy endings.” Steve clarified, just in case the man was questioning Steve’s legitimacy. That got him a soft snort. Steve smiled in response.
By the time Steve left the tower ten minutes later, he had a pocket full of cash and another double appointment set up for the next week.
“I think I had best get him into bed and go home.” She said, yawning. “Thank you, Steve, that was wonderful.”
“Okay, we can work on that. Do you want to stay sitting up?” Steve asked, glad that he hadn’t been sent away. He didn’t move, didn’t reach out, not until Stark turned to face away from Steve in a silent agreement.
Irritated in only the way that someone figuring out something long before he did, Tony brought him the box.
He remembered reading, after Afghanistan, that one’s body started to cannibalize itself after a few days and his sleep deprived brain found that was psychically funny. Carol was in the middle of talking to him when he sat up and laughed. She stopped and turned toward him, eyes wide. “Tony?” Her voice couldn’t decide if it wanted to be hesitant or questioning. A blonde orderly passed by the window and all the hysterical joy left him in an instant.
It was time for limited amounts of explanations.
The box arrives on Monday, January eighth of two thousand seven at exactly nine forty-seven in the morning at the very edge of the kitchen counter on the very top floor of the Avengers Tower. No one was around to tell that except the cameras and Tony Stark who, by his own design and creation, was also the cameras.
“Carol?”
“How do you use it?”
driven by fear. As far as I can understand, that’s based on others fear of you, rather than your
Steve loved the blue ring. “It just feels right,” he confided in Sam while they patrolled. “Using it, it’s like you know you’ve done something good. It only works if you feel right. It can make a shield, see? Not everybody can use it, but I bet you could.” And so Sam did and, even without his wings, he began to fly. Peter learned the same trick, flying around the streets with the blue ring under his costume. Peter stuck a note on the safe Tony kept the rings in, “save green or blue for your friendliest Spider-person,” because no matter how hard or long he tried with the others nothing ever happened.
"Sure, why not?" Steve allowed himself a small smile. Iron Man had Steve turn around. He looped his arms under Steve's, pulling the super soldier close to his chest.
"He thinks I'm the one who tortured him," Tony's voice wavered. "I tried convincing him otherwise, but he wouldn't listen. He didn't seem to know who the Avengers were, either. Well, he knew the Avengers were the ones chasing him just now, he didn't know your guys' names."
Heavy metallic footsteps approached the door. More sounds of crunching metal echoed throughout the room as the doors were forced open. But it wasn't Iron Man who had opened the doors.
"I'm not the one you should be apologizing too."
"Have you ever been in love?"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!" Peter flipped over Venom. "Not cool! I've had my fair share of being a host for right now, please come back later!"
"Because I'm the one who put those there," they reached over and picked up a scalpel.
Henry wiggled his little body.
Tony sat in the back of the wagon, ignoring the straw that was poking through his clothing. He grunted when the wagon jerked forward suddenly. The group rode together in silence for a long time. The elf man apparently understood where they needed to go, because they were slowly but surely approaching the mountains. Tony looked down at his gauntlet. Without being attached to the Iron Man suit, it just simply wasn't getting enough power. The blast he had used on the dragon earlier barely left a mark. He took the extra wiring out of his pockets and got to work on connecting the gauntlet to his reactor. The moment the circuit was closed, he knew that he had just cut his life expectancy in half. The reactor glowed ever dimmer, but the repulsor was back at full power.
"GET OFF HIM!!"
He was...beautiful.
"They miss Iron Man. You bringing a "friend" to the party isn't going to change that."
"Peter's panic button," Tony was already suited up.
"Having a helmet implies that there's a head inside. Most likely with a face." Bruce pointed out. "And he changes his helmet once a month, so..."
Clint responded.
"Do you ever feel like you shouldn't be here?" Bucky asked.
"I killed him. I killed Osborn. It was an accident, it...I...he..." Peter's lower lip trembled, and he felt tears pricking his eyes. "He was gonna kill Tony, I wasn't thinking...it was an accident..."
"On it!" War Machine called, firing his shoulder gun at said target.
Peter grumbled something and hit Tony in the face with one of the couch pillows.
"Because you're my friend and you should know. Also, it gets lonely down here sometimes." He added the last bit in a whisper. "Also, I..."
"Easy for you to say! You're not the one getting attacked by angry citizens!" Clint snapped.
Tony kept his eyes shut.
Tony fell face first onto the bed with a grunt. He rolled onto his back and brushed his non-prosthetic hand through his black hair, and down the left side of his face. He refused to touch the right side. The side that was...not him. He had made a facial prosthetic to hide the mess of wires and metal plates that had replaced half of his face. But there was no hiding the glowing blue orb that had been implanted in his eye socket. Of all the things Tony was forced to learn to live with, the artificial eye had taken the longest to get used to. The eye wasn't faulty. He could see just fine with it. He did design it, after all. It was the way he now experienced color that caused problems. Sometimes, he saw everything in shades of blue. Sometimes he saw normal colors. Sometimes his two different eyes couldn't get along and he saw the world in a mess of saturated blues and grays.
"I changed my mind. Put it down. And walk away."
"Where are you going, bug boy?" Otto threw out his arm, blocking the exit.
Peter shook his head. "It doesn't matter. I'm the one who killed him. This is my burden to bear. Not yours."
Peter thought, looking up at the dim light coming from the exit to the vent. If he made all the right turns, then the lab should be right below him. He just needed to get some extra web fluid, and then he could leave the tower for good.
"I know how to fight. Remind me, who was it that broke you all out of the Helicarrier? And who did that without his armor?"
"Not everyone is a super soldier!" Tony doubled over to catch his breath.
Tony practically melted with relief. "Thank god, I don't think my legs could take much more!"
"He doesn't have to be."
Tony's eye twitched, "I would never hurt him. You know that."
“Doesn’t matter anymore. What’s done is done.” Tony hung his head. Steve brought his hand up to hold the side of his face, smiling softly at the way Tony leaned into his touch. It was obvious how touch starved Tony was, with the way he welcomed even the smallest bit of affection. And Steve was more than happy to give it to him. He believed wholeheartedly that Tony deserved to be shown love and affection.
"Too bad. I'm not going to stand by and let you destroy yourself! Shut it down!" Steve ordered.
"I'm not patrolling. I just needed to clear my head. What happened to your face?"
"It was an accident, Harry. I didn't want to kill him."
"This looks...safe," Bruce commented. He, Thor and Steve currently stood outside the entrance to an abandoned mine. The wooden beams holding the hillside at bay looked as though they could give out at any moment. The thought of the mine collapsing while they were inside made Bruce shudder. He wrapped his coat tighter around his shoulders. "I think I'll stay out here."
Iron Man blasted repulsor after repulsor as his son clambered around the rocks. "Keep moving! My sensors-"
"Honestly, I don't remember what I had for breakfast. I feel fine, though," Tony shrugged. Did he talk to Thor this morning? The lack of sleep was causing everything to blur together. He vaguely remembered stumbling around Bruce's lab early in the morning. He must have talked to Thor then.
"Not at all," Peter hummed. He wasn't about to tell Harry that Norman had held him for ransom and tortured him in the process. "Sorry, it didn't work out. I know how hard you worked to get me that job."
Tony made eye contact Bucky. He tilted his head, asking a silent question. Bucky shook his head and left the room.
"Wouldn't still be there. He could be anywhere on the carrier," Steve skidded to a stop next to Tony.
"Is that a problem?" Steve asked.
"Tony. Don't change the subject. Why the hell would we ask if you had a child?" Steve sighed.
After the battle of New York, the Avengers had moved into what had once been Stark Tower. Now dubbed "Avengers Tower". That had been a year ago. The entire team had become very close in that short time. Nothing like an alien invasion to bring people together. Natasha and Clint were still very private individuals, but they were doing their best. Bruce was a quiet, but kind. He liked to cook dinner for everyone. Thor was still getting used to living on Midgard and had blown up three microwaves and two toasters in the past month alone. He was trying his best.
