"He's got this great power and responsibility and...I don't know," He murmured,
The hunter seemed pretty sure of himself but then again the man could convince a Fisher to buy fish. Chamuel thought as he continued with his work.
"Why...do you ask so many questions?"
"Oh this? Just-- little rough last night," He lied, Abel thought back to Arphaxat who'd been a tad...jealous of Mishka. The demon lashed out at Abel who quickly got mad right back only to be apologized to a few times, stopping the hunter in his tracks.
"Just trust me, alright?" He chuckled, letting his hand fall, "Besides you'll have Danny boy here," He nodded his head towards Danjal who rolled his eyes at the nickname, "You'll be fine."
"Hey big guy!" Gretchen called out, waving to the other with Cherry following behind her. The cat let out a soft puff as she padded towards them and laid on her side. Danjal leaned forward and rolled his fingers over the cat's soft belly fur before it latched her jaw around the man's finger playfully.
Sam frowned as the line went dead, racing his fingers through his hair. The phones had gone quiet now which caused him great anxiety, he flipped a few channels. One showed Bailey and Baal blasting through the police lineup, another had the cops surrounding a small bar that held Mishka and Cain. At least Donnie and Israfil hadn't called him yet.
"I'm telling on you for cursing," William snarled back, turning to look at Jasmine and her brother, "Just because you skipped grades doesn't mean you can draw my hero like that!"
"What's freaking them out?" Booker gasped,
"What happened?" He asked again, this time looking to Abel. Worry in his voice as he unzipped his bag and started to pull out a few things he'd need.
"How about a skyscraper,"
“Yeah I played!” Abel laughed, getting into a stance as if he was about to swing.
Glancing at Abel, who watched him with a puzzled expression.
"Daddy please," she teased, causing him to toss her back.
“Make sure to keep close to a friend, be safe,” Chamuel laughed,
Mr. Vess glanced between the two, confusion in his eyes, “Why did you come in together?” He asked,
Abel was getting visibly frustrated with the others answers, "Well you gotta know something,"
Abel came back into the room, closing and bolting the door behind him. He drew the curtains, placing the camera on the table before collapsing on the bed beside Chamuel. Groaning as he rolled to look at the other,
The small room felt empty without the angel's mess on the floor, though Chamuel often bragged about being clean Abel found himself picking up the blondes clothes often.
"I hear that!"
"Why did you run away?" Sam asked, curiosity sparked in his gaze as he rested his hands on her leg.
Halfway to the home his phone rang loudly, Cain pressed the answer button.
With that he hung up the phone, the music started up again as Israfil relaxed into the seat. Humming along to the song. Donnie watched him out of the corner of his eye.
“We got Hulu too,” Chamuel added as the three made for the house. Abel grinned at his friends, the lonely feeling that sat in his heart like a thorn lifted. For the first time in his life, he felt as if he belonged. He felt as though he wasn’t pretending to be someone he wasn't, yet the ever growing anxiety continued to press into his brain. Arphaxat’s words still echoed in his mind, even among the laughter and pizza ordering he couldn’t stop the voice that echoed through his skull.
“Look at this!” Iggy practically shouted, pulling his cell phone out. Letting the camera sit comfortably on an upside down bucket. Marshall got closer to the other, blinking at the phone. Shown was a giant monster attacking two men in a bar, Marshall shook his head.
Vess’ brother stood in the doorway, his large body turning to darkness under the light of the nearly full moon.
"Is not watching Matilda a war crime?"
"I'm sorry, I'm just-- I'm just confused, Abel," Chamuel whispered,
He felt relief swirl from his thoughts, tossing his empty coffee cup into a nearby trash can. He stood close to we're the homeless camp was, the street's still a little busy but it wasn't as bad as normal.
"Yeah, I guess…" he mused, "I thought my whole...gender thing confused you? Didn't you say something similar to Cham?"
Ancitif eyed the brush around them, the ice made it impossible to pinpoint the exact spot their enemy stood. He could hear the soft patter of feet on snow,
The demon leaned into the other, pressing his lips to Abel's. The hunter relaxed slightly as they kissed, the blonde raced his fingers through the back of Abel's hair as he ran his tongue over the others lips. Abel winced, the cut on his lip hurt but the kissing sent a warmth through him that he felt he needed desperately.
"Well...they say mirrors are the window to the soul," She pointed out, leaning down to read the book he had out in front of him. Placing her hand on his leg as she did so, getting herself a good balance.
"It's the darkness," Baal said with with a small sigh, "It's...not like anything you'd ever faced. The more it grows, the stronger the supernatural will become."
She did her best to walk past them with her eyes down, neither gave her a glance as she moved past the exhibits. She made for the stairs, slowly climbing upwards until she got to the floor that held the changing area. Making her way past a few cops and towards the 'employee only' door. The locker room. She'd grab her stuff quickly before hunting down her manager to quit.
"A superpowered shrink huh?"
"Be a king, or a peasant," Amaryllis spat, dark, thick purple liquid fell to the floor burning the carpet below.
"Coffee shop, I can't function without it."
"That's not the point! Are you listening?"
“They can bring back the dead, summon demons and reanimate corpses,” Abel read, “It says here John was attacked by one but couldn’t seem to kill it with anything he had. No guns, no crosses, it was like the sucker was invincible. He fed off the death of pure humans as well, killing them with a demon that was being kept in a jar. Any human with a pure heart was often kept in close range of the necromancer and killed whenever he needed to feed.” Abel paused, giving Marshall a glance, but the teen didn’t seem phased by what the hunter was saying.
"Erm, Mammon?"
Robin rolled his eyes, rushing his fingers through his hair. A butterfly dropped down onto his head just beside his hand, causing the woman to let out a snorting laugh.
Chamuel looked surprised, tilting his head with a quizzical look on his face.
"Drink my loves, soon this will be all over," he licked his lips as he gave her a toothy smile. The innocent looked to one another, a few still sat in the pews having drank the potion in their hands they remained like stone.
"Paul stop, he's an angel. I'm only a human...kind of," Donnie hissed out to his brother, but he couldn't keep the longing out of his gaze as he turned his head to glance at the angel.
"Or tasted human blood!" Fritz added, "first turn, if you taste human blood it's impossible to go back."
Pain dashed over him as he hit the ground below, this was a dream right? Why did he feel that pain? Rolling into a sitting position he looked to and fro, he was sitting in a clearing once more. Dark ominous trees standing around him, they were tall, angry,
"Its...hard to explain," Abel murmured, "He can see the future, and...well, he just told me to bring Robin to 'The Grotto's'"
The look of defeat on the hunters face made the angel grin, "I'm putting it on the list," Chamuel whispered.
"What made you want to reform? I know a few reformed vampires but I feel there's a story here," he murmured.
Baal didn't answer Sam, he held out the bottle for the other who rolled his eyes and accepted the strong smelling liquid. Sam still couldn't wrap his head around Baal who seemed to be the opposite of any demon he met, not only was he not a complete dick but he also seemed to hate germs, not allowing Sam to sit on his motorcycle without putting on the sanitizer.
"You….actually came?" He asked, looking bewildered
The woman had taken her time dressing the pair up that morning, giving Abel one of her suits much to his dismay about wearing a feminine blazer, but Chamuel couldn't help but admire the way it sat on his friend, she insisted on covering the hunters face in makeup to hide the multiple scrapes and bruises.
It howled painfully as the sharp glass from the bulbs slashed up its fur and flesh. Abel scrambled away, it shook its giant head before glaring at the hunter who sucked air in as if he'd run a mile.
"Or me," Abel grinned
"Be out of here in ten minutes, or I'll turn you two into dust," Baal hissed towards them, the brothers nodded, taking off past Bailey the second they were freed, she watched them practically scramble over one another to escape.
"I thought I lost you," he shouted, Donnie laughed only to cough painfully.
Chamuel stopped, blinking down at the other. "Yeah?"
"Come on, baby, come on," She whispered, helping him stand and guiding him out of the hallway and down the short flight of steps. He felt as if his feet weren't touching the group as panic swirled through his body, his mind cluttered with questions, thoughts, doubts. They were far too loud, he smacked his forehead a few times with the back of his palm in an attempt to settle his rattling brain.
“My great aunt had a beard,” Sam replied.
"Good morning, Robin," he man croaked, "I'm Fran,"
"He finally cracked!" Cain called to his friends, Abel shoved the man away with a small laugh.
“I’m not going to teach you just shooting, I’ll...I don’t know, show you a few things,” Sam replied, making towards a closet, he swung open the door, parting the coats aside so he could get a better view of the back of the small room. Sam moved aside a few balls, and a handful of tennis rackets before finding the treasure he had been seeking, a maple colored wooden baseball bat. Sam turned back to the two men, holding it out towards Abel with a curt smile on his lips. Abel slowly reached for it, taking it in his hands with wide eyes. The bat was a little heavy with high quality wood, it reminded him of playing baseball in college. For a few short breaths he could almost smell the grass below his feet, hear the cheering of the crowd, if only he could go back. A rush of sadness flooded his mind but he shook his head as if to dismiss the memories.
"Great, you're back," she snorted, "can we go home now?"
"Your body isn't used to how much power you have," Uriel said, sitting down on a stump. Chamuel sat down on the floor in front of him.
The pair scrambled up a long, thin ledge that raced to the front of the clock.
"You son of a bitch!" Abel laughed, "Wolfing out and trying to eat the couch!"
"We're in a rush but not that much of a rush, you need to sleep,"
As he slipped into eternal sleep he couldn't help but think of the angel, his final moments, he'd think of what could have been. The kiss he had so desperately craved had been one of the best nights and the worst at the same time.
"Wow Arphaxat, thank you so much for getting me the information I need!" Arphaxat said in a mocking, valley girl accent.
Donnie laughed, “Well you’re not gonna be alive long if you keep doing this,” He mused, adjusting the glasses that sat on his nose.
Donnie's family shuttled uncomfortable,
"My friend Bodhi wants me to send you and Danjal down to a bull farm in Texas, we need to rescue him,"
"I don't need to use it," she cooed, dancing her fingers through his short brown locks.
"Stop that,"
“We have an hour before Marshall gets here, let’s see if we can find anything else about these deaths that google tried to cover,” Abel was determined, it shone in his eyes like a cold fire. They passed rows and rows of books, none of which was helpful until they came to a small section with the words town history plastered at the top of the book shelves. Both men nodded to each other before splitting up, Abel made for a computer that was seated in the corner by a small wooden table and chairs. Chamuel raced his fingers against the spines of the old dusty books, none of which seemed to have been touched for years. He pulled one out, flipping through it before tossing it on the table.
"An last night, with Mishka, it was an accident. My phone went off at midnight with a stupid birthday ringer I always forget about, she asked and well...you know Mishka, she told everyone she stopped by," He chuckled nervously, looking at the blonde with a small frown.
The pair moved quickly through the sharp thorny undergrowth below their feet, he hadn't ever seen these plants before. Their thorns stuck up towards the sky, with crimson red small flowers poking out between the sharp spikes.
Chamuel frowned now as the reality of the situation set back in, "yeah," he whispered. Abel nodded numbly, rubbing his eyes a bit as he pushed himself into the angel's chest.
"You have to face your team, Abel."
"What's up with my nail?" He asked, holding up his hand. Hahasiah shrugged at this, shoving her hands into the pockets on her skirt.
Abel leaned back to the bed frame, sighing as if he could see his memories reflected on the wall across from him, eyes tracing the old television as he attempted to put together the words without coming off as if the memory didn’t hurt.
She smiles at him, turning up the radio with a broad smile.
"If it's from a book, who's to say we can't find the book?"
He could see out of the window on the door, and could see Mammon waving at him with a grin. Long shaggy hair tied back, his boyish smile bright.
The cold air puffed from his mouth as he glanced around for the blonde, hazel eyes scanning the now ominous looking beds of spider lilies that dotted the backyard, leading to a large maze-like garden. The doctor has seen his fair share of rich homes, but this one seemed as if it were made by someone with an incredibly dramatic flair. Noting the odd patches in the grass below, he shrugged wondering if it was possibly a new found way to grow grass. If it was one thing Cain didn't know, it was gardening. He never got into it, having lived in an apartment his entire life he preferred them to homes. Houses felt far too open, too many things could go wrong in a large home but an apartment? It was small, cozy, and safe.
Danjal laughed at this, "What a punk! Can't wait to meet him!" Danjal chuckled. Robin didn't say anything as he fiddled with the Adinkra around his neck.
The sudden feeling of wetness slashed over him, it was as if a sprinkler was going off but only a small bit of the water caught onto your clothes.
"Community of Faith?" Cains eyes moved from the photos to the dark haired hunter, "yeah, the COF. It's small now, many people gave up trying to share the word of Faith. After the Adinkra was lost and the Bible was being written they kept everything about Faith out. Fearful the hunt for the Adinkra would cause a war between God's followers. So, every angel's Adinkra was taken. Not just Faith's, but all of them. God made it so the humans would evolve to hold their power easier, that way they wouldn't need the Adinkra's,"
Chamuel felt the pain once more, it exploded in his mind causing war to really kick up. The voice shouted at him, he knew something was wrong as his hands started to glow. Attempting to blink back war who didn't seem to care how Abel was possibly in danger, just wanting to destroy whatever could be harming him.
“We didn’t know,” Chamuel finally said into the empty air around them. He could feel the pain weighing heavy on Abel, even his ability seemed to only dull the anxiety the man felt temporarily.
“I know Abel,”
"Oh no you don't!" Donnie yelled, he went to snag his weapon from his bag only to have the monster's tentacles to snatch the backpack. Both men fought against the creature's strength, Donnie shouted in rage as the backpack was pulled from his grip.
"I'm not cleaning this," he said over his shoulder as Abel helped Chamuel to his feet.
“I’m not going to question it,” Abel replied
"Yeah but it was your idea,"
"Just get home, read this in the car." She said with a note of fear in her voice, Bailey didn't have time to say anything as she was being shoved towards the front door by her friend. She attempted to sign to the other but her hands were also ignored,
"Hey!" Danjal shouted, his voice boomed around them as he pounded the bottom of his large glass of beer on the table. The group fell silent, all eyes moving to the short, scrawny demon with the lizard on his shoulder.
"I never signed that,"
"Baal," she called, he snapped his attention to her.
She charged forward, her mouth distorted to a large smile that stretched the skin in a horrific fashion as she laughed. Her fingers extended like long, thin claw as she tore her way towards Buck. A blast from Israfil's guitar knocked her back, she roared in anger. Donnie's eyes snapped back to Israfil, Mammon was beating him into the floor with laughter in his eyes.
"He's breathing!" Chamuel said through tears.
"What was that,"
Donnie went over more things with the two, typing away into their phones to protect them more. Explaining ways they could easily make more money, have more a following,
https://www.deviantart.com/burnin-dove/art/Nathan-Lancaster-Hand-Sigil-888844867
"Sugar Cain?" She called again, walking down the short hallway and glancing in the bathroom. A cold feeling of dread washed into her system when she spotted a gun sitting on the floor. Fear flooded her body, she moved quicker now. Making her way to Cain's room, opening the door but it was empty. Her heart skipping over and over as she made towards another door, Eve's name was etched into the wood with a few flowers around it.
Abel groaned when the last bell rang, the hunter pushed into the classroom Chamuel had been teaching in. His hair is a mess with dirt, dust and an oil type liquid. His hands caked in cleaner, he felt almost high from smelling the strong stuff all day.
"Man, I know why you came here! This place is great!" Mammon laughed, slamming his steel toed shoe into Robin's stomach making the king yowl in pain, spitting blood as he did so.
"Yeah, that's true," Baal said with a nod, "Okay," With that the man got his hand sanitizer out and cleaned up his hands. She rolled her eyes as he handed her some of the sanitizer but she didn't argue, silently though she worried about Sam. She wondered what could have possibly made such an ear splitting sound.
"Okay honey bear, we can do that," She whispered to him, he nodded slowly as the pair left the room behind. In the lights of the hallway she could see what he'd done to himself in an attempt to find any sort of escape. His neck black and blue from the noose, large rings sat under his eyes as if he hadn't slept in days.
"No! Butch!" Abel shouted, Scrambling forward with wide, terrified eyes.
Abel bit his lip, attempting to look through the blackness before glancing down at the Chamulet. Silently wondering if he could make it glow, he closed his eyes but his mind felt too cluttered to even focus on the Chamulets power. Last time it glowed was last night, right before the kiss. He recalled the soft glowing.
"What does it mean when it says the king will fall?" Donnie asked, glancing at Israfil who shuffled nervously.
“Is this our version of a prank?” Abel asked,
"There's a colonial woman on the wing!" Chamuel mimicked
Dread surged through the blondes veins at the others words, his heart stopping, “Whats happening?” Chamuel demanded,
Both men fell silent once more, Israfil fiddled with the hat more before pulling out a golden necklace. Chamuel eyed it for a few seconds,
"I'm okay," the angel said quickly, getting to his feet. Abel was tossed backward, falling to the ground before getting up and shaking the snow off himself.
"What happened?" Baal asked, tilting his head. Bailey glanced up at the other, "Not sure," She admitted.
Irafil grinned widely at his friend, "The first chain's been broken," He whispered back to Chamuel, "A king of hell will bow his head to a king of heaven,"
"Hey!" Gretchen shouted as the werewolves collected themselves, making their way towards their own horses that had followed the others to their snacking area.
"Come on, man, you're not gonna be drunk off one drink,"
"Yeah," Bailey snorted, "nice church in the middle of this dirt poor town? Sounds about right. Probably have stacks of money to keep that blue color as vibrant as it is,"
"You think everyone in that group are just gonna pair up and fuck themselves to death? We won't have to worry," Callista laughed, leaning against the counter top and messing with the snakes on her head causing them to hiss in annoyance.
"Yeah man, I'm in your facebook support group, I follow your hashtag,"
“Born again?” Donnie asked,
“First place at knowing movies,” Donnie chimed in,
"We're Butch?" Sam asked groggily, glancing to the empty spot in the bed beside him. Since they were rescued the man had been acting differently but Sam chalked it up to whatever the demons had done while they were captured. Rubbing his eyes groggily, the hunter glared at the bright, afternoon sun.
"Thank you," she whispered, Cain nodded before whipping his head around towards the man.
“I guess I...don’t really have a choice?” Sam said,
"Good morning Twitter," He said in a mock Robin Williams voice, Chamuel rolled his eyes at this but his smile grew as he looked towards the other.
The wind howled angrily as the hours ticked by, the light in the sky was starting to die down but it was still decently bright as the group picked their way around the snowy undergrowth. Abel sprayed the trees every so often.
“You’re an angel of love, have mercy,”
"The king falling, it's been something in every prophecy with a king. From Jesus to Abel Winchester," Sam sighed yet again, leaning against the counter.
“What’cha mean?” Abel asked, tilting his head at the other, having stopped fiddling with the wrist band around Chamuel’s wrist. He wore it specifically for Abel to play around with it when the man was anxious, of course, he’d never tell the hunter that.
"It's not as bad as you'd think, after all I came from hell! And I'm great!"
"Saint maybe, man I'm not."
He didn't reply, shaking his head as if he couldn't understand what she said. He pulled out of the parking spot, she noticed he looked...nervous? Why would he be nervous?
"Look, it's too snowy to drive the impala, plus, it's part of the gift! Norma already said I could use it," Abel said with a chuckle, holding out the helmet to the blonde.
"What w--" Abel started to ask, only for the demon to snap his fingers in front of Abel's face.
"Come on, Chammy!" Abel called to the angel who was pulling a bottle of beer from the fridge that sat beside the large couch.
"Me and Israfil already voted, Baal's in too."
"Good, fucking traitor,"
"Make a wish," She whispered,
The man was incredibly distracted, despite the sickness that wrecked his body he stood in front of the punching bag with his hands wrapped and determination in his gaze. He wore a black eye that he insisted happened after the fight but Baal wasn't so sure.
"Okay,"
Cham turned his head to see another monstrous raccoon clawing its way towards him, Cham took a few steps back, fear flooded his face as he froze. Closing his eyes, he felt air rush past him as Abel jumped in front of Cham. The monster bit down onto Abels bat, screaming as its mouth seemed to almost dissolve under the silver and dropping to the ground. The smaller man held his foot back, using all his might he kicked the monstrous raccoon backwards and into the woods.
"Is it a night off from you?" Abel asked,
"You're just being way too emotional right now, you're just pissing me off more,"
"Bailey, nice to see you," he said, nodding towards her.
"Hm?"
From there he introduced them to the weapons, letting the boys hold the gun, explaining how they work, how to shoot and where to reload. Sam also went through the handling of a shotgun,
"Since when have you cared about humans? Or the Earth? Last I checked you were a traitor."
"Yeah, maybe, but they're still human. we should show them some respect,"
The large wooden church was a wreck, with blood covering the floor, pews tossed about and broken with a body settled in the center. Badger held the camera to the floor to show the dust that had once been the angel's body and moved his camera to Mammon's corpse.
Abel's heart stopped, Chamuel didn't break his eye contact as he whispered out the words Abel had been dying to hear.
"Sorry," He said, his voice smooth as fresh coffee, "I didn't mean to listen in."
His eyes fell shut as a comfort he had never experienced before flooded his body.
The man blinked at him through wide fearful eyes as he continued towards the demon.
"Away from you," he hissed, storming down the stairs.
"We can't go see my friend without him," Bailey insisted from where she stood beside Baal. Her worry etched into her features, arms crossed over her chest.
Mishka made her way up the hidden stairs, lazily running her fingers against the wall. She hadn't been into this room for a few years and silently wondered what or who could possibly be inside it. After all, the room was usually locked.
"W-what did you find out?"
Israfil shook his head, "I uh...need to find my friend, remember?"
The look the two shared a look over Cain which sent a rush of angry fire into the doctor, envy bit down on his heart and ripped it to pieces. He clenched his jaw, attempting to keep his mind off the flashing smiles the two shared randomly. Soon, Chamuel would forget Abel and he'd be sharing goofy nicknames with the angel.
Before leaving the room she went down to her knees, bowing to him with her head down. He nodded at her after a few seconds of admiring the bow, she got to her feet. Turning on her heels and leaving the room, the door closing hard behind her as she stormed away from his office.
"Hey, we'll find them," Chamuel whispered, putting a hand on the man's shoulder.
His vision returned after a short time, the moon was high in the air but the demons were gone. He laid on the ground in the dark, the voice in his earbuds still chatting away as he slowly sat up. The movement reminded him of the pain in his jaw, he winced and glanced around him. He let his tongue move over the empty spot in his mouth, then over the rest of his teeth. They only took the one, possibly to scare him? Or was it a threat? Did the mysterious motorcycle rider help him? The pliers sat in a tiny puddle of blood not far away.
"All I'm saying, I read if the king lost his soul it was the next seal broken, next big thing before it all goes to shit," Hahasiah snorted.
There was silence that filled the room, Donnie felt the tears forming again. He hated having to tell the other such a terrible thing but he knew Israfil would do it without question, "okay," Israfil finally said, though Donnie could hear his voice crack. The hunter hesitated, rolling over and looking at the man who was obviously attempting to keep himself from crying. He refused to look at Donnie, still playing with the phone in his hands but he did so with a horrified expression.
"Abel?" He breathed,
"Where is it?" Baal gasped, eyes moving from one apartment complex to the next before back to Bailey who was pointing. He followed her finger to a little girl, she sat on the floor in front of the apartments with chalk in hand under the streetlight.
Bailey watched impatiently, the more light that sparked from Sam's forehead the worse the king felt as she walked in a slow circle around them now. Setting her phone up so she wouldn't have to hold it up but could still record, she pulled Sam's pocket watch from her jacket. Eyes traced over it a few times before she flicked it open, she looked in shock now. She could see them in the mirror, they were all standing behind their body.
She jumped off, he had no choice but to follow her as she made for the entrance.
"Masculine name for a woman," Cain said, causing Mishka to arch her eyebrow at him. He shuffled uncomfortably now, was that not right? Though he often spoke without thinking he liked to believe, as a doctor, he came off as intelligent all the time but since hanging out with the group he's felt as though he couldn't say anything correctly.
Uriel shook his head, putting a hand up to stop the other from speaking, “This is going to be hard to swallow — Chamuel has been sent to live with humans, nearly Twenty years ago,” Sam tried to not show his impatience, it was just like Uriel to be as dramatic as he possibly could. Even with a new vessel, the man would never stop with his dramatic antics.
"Yeah, he's a cock," Bodhi snorted.
Abel groaned, putting his foot in the others cupped hands. Within seconds he was hoisted upwards, gasping in shock at how far he was going upwards. Snagging the end of the window, hoisting himself into the tiny bathroom with ease.
Norma guided them towards the living room, she talked a mile a minute as they followed behind her. Baal's heart slammed against his ribcage as they stepped closer and closer. Passing a few artsy looking statues, some paintings and a large fish tank. Norma knocked on the wood beside the frame,
"Told you," She whispered, "Now that you're here I am going to go clean the ice machine, someone needs to babysit," She teased the demon.
"Donnie! Who's your friend?"
"Yeah fuck you too," Abel shouted, righting the car.
"Where are your talking animals?" Sam continued to tease, causing Baal to shove him lightly.
Bailey looked at him surprised, she had never seen a demon so determined to protect the innocent. He cleared his throat as if he was ready to make an announcement,
"Well…"
"Come down," a voice shouted back, but Abel didn't recognize the voice.
Baal and Bailey burst through the door, causing the angel to nearly leap out of his skin.
Israfil whispered, looking around with wide eyes. He couldn't believe this was happening as the gold on the door flashed awake. The stone was pushed aside to show a woman with a bright smile. Her rich tan skin shone in the golden light, her eyes of amber burned with love. She radiated love in fact, looking at her was like looking into the sun.
“Whos that?” Sam asked,
"What about grace and beauty?" He asked, putting a foot on the steps only for Bailey to push her way in front of him.
"I can't," Chamuel murmured, "they might not be my feelings," he practically wailed as he sucked in air trying to keep his panic down.
Abel sat against Baal, he shivered still despite the blankets that covered him and the demon who radiated heat. The man had his arm wrapped around Abel, attempting to keep him as warm as possible.
"Oh, it was this sign at a gas station," Abel laughed, "No traction,"
"And you're gonna answer them," Baal continued, cracking his knuckles. Sam crossed his arms over his chest.
“It’s not, like, a guide to getting to the future,”
The two drank their beers, chatting about nothing as they did so,
"Daddy," he whispered again, leaning against a tree as he started to clean his wound with a bottle of rubbing alcohol. Wincing at the pain but refusing to let his father see the tears in his eyes. Mostly, in fear, he knew the large man would berate him if he cried.
"They're going to think it was all CGI?" Sam asked
"Me and Cham are going to go through the office buildings, try to see if someone snagged it on their way to work."
"Good, cause I'm...banned," Baal said with an awkward cough.
She smiled bright, doing a small shimmy before making her way back into the kitchen.
His heart fluttered lightly as he stared at the king, looking over his face, the scar on his forehead, the facial hair that didn't seem to want to grow in even. Abel felt the other's eyes on him, turning his head to Chamuel and giving a smile.
“John sounds badass,” Marshall said, tilting his head.
His family was tied up a few feet from him, all tied up and shouting at the demons in the room. Paul and Vanilla looked to have been separated, Obizuth practically danced up to Donnie, his father shuffled and coughed beside him.
The world around them turned to black as the demon took a few steps towards the pair, his eyes glowed against the blackness. His smile was so wide it took up his face, red rimmed glasses stood out against the dark colors.
Silence fell once more as Abel stared at the ground with wide hurt eyes. Chamuel hesitated before placing a hand on the others shoulder, pulling him into a side hug. Abel pushed his face into Chamuels arm, the angel could feel the man's hot tears against the fabric of his shirt. He rubbed the others shoulder as he cried,
"Honestly Issy, I don't get how I'm the king, I'm...not even…"
"Okay, but what about the people who saw it?" Chamuel asked, standing up now to get his own phone.
Chamuel laughed at the sudden outburst, shaking his head, not interrupting the prideful strut Abel had put on with the fact the bullet only hit the bottom of the paper.
"Oh, of course," Sam chuckled, "My bad,"
"What about--"
She shook off the worries the best she could before picking up her food and starting to eat, the burger was easily one of the best she had! Enjoying it as she and Baal made light talk, she rapidly found that the demon was easy to talk to. He was good at listening, mellow. It reminded her to slow down, to relax as well. She was used to men attempting to talk over her or gain control of the situation she normally had to come out fighting, but with Baal he seemed genuinely interested in everything she had to say.
The bike roared to life, Bailey winced as her wrapped up hand made contact with the handles but that didn't stop her from pushing it to drive and kicking forward. Within seconds she could hear the screeching of the monsters, they dove at them with large hungry teeth. The bike shot like a bullet down the street leaving the confused and terrified FBI agents behind them.
“What’s wrong with Singer Salt?” Abel asked,
"No, no no," Robin squirmed more, silently begging the Adinkra to work. To save him! But all he felt was the slamming of his heart against his chest, maybe he wasn't good enough.
"Abel," She whispered,
"Well I hate it," Another man on the screen growled, presumably, the man's partner. "We protected everyone in silence, than suddenly some stupid Winchester comes and ruins it? Leave it to a Winchester!"
Donnie's heart stopped, before Mammon could continue Israfil roared out in rage. With a sharp hum the Adinkra glowed so vivid Mammon dropped it in shock. Israfil's wings flew from his back, smashing into the two demons that surrounded him. He shot into the air, his eyes glowed vivid yellow in the dark church. The dying sun cast crimson light on the floor below turning it to blood, tears of gold ran down the angels cheeks.
"Do you boys need anything?" She called, Mammon glanced at his friends and at Norma with a confused look in his eyes.
A rush of realization fell over the angel, looking back to Obizuth who had vanished with the additional distraction. He now noticed the people that laid in heaps on the floor, the sludge had left their hosts to attack the group but now they were gone. Everything was gone. The light in the angels eyes flashed away, blue gaze returning as he looked around at what had happened. A large, concrete structure now sat in the middle of the club having torn open the floor, it looked like a structure of a wave in the heart of the small club, people laid all around it, dead. He looked to where he shot a beam of energy, the floor had a large, burnt, dent with bones piled all around it. One man had been cut in half by the light, his upper half bone while his lower laid bleeding onto the floor.
"We don't know what he's doing," he murmured, "he might come back." Baal put his hands out as if to attempt and calm down the anxiety that blew through the hunters mind like a hurricane.
"You two idiots figure it out," Sam sighed, "I can't hold your hand for everything,"
Baal grunted, she relaxed as the demon shuffled a bit before sitting up. Looking at her groggily,
"Yeah," Cham murmured, "We need to find the rest of that, maybe it'll have a clue on the Chamulet,"
"What?"
"Issy, go in the car. Me and Donnie need to talk,"
"Archangel Faith was the first and strongest archangel,"
Robin nodded at this, Danjal glanced at his friend then back up to Abel. His mind buzzed with song as Abel spoke, he rolled his hands over his tattooed arm before glancing down at Robin again. The smaller demon stopped paying attention to what Abel was talking about. His eyes down to the floor, Danjal silently wondered what the other was thinking about. Swallowing the urge to bother the archer with questions he turned his attention back to Abel. Listening to what the hunter was saying half heartedly, his mind moved to the Grotto. What even was it? The large demon moved his gaze back to Robin again, forcing himself to look elsewhere as the archer looked towards him.
Abel paused, holding his baseball bat in one hand and a puzzled expression flooding his gaze.
“Cham, man! Can you hear me?” Abel asked, leaning down and shaking the Angel lightly. Chamuel groaned painfully, blinking up at Abel.
"Fran, who are you?" He whispered, opening the front of the watch. Using the mirror to look at the front of his hair, fiddling with it a bit with a chuckle.
"Arphaxat you--"
“And you just happened to find me?”
"Hurry," Bailey whispered to Baal who filled the tank in a rush. An idea started to hatch in her mind, though it was risky, at this point she knew people saw them. Noticed the flying devil's that clouded the deep blue skies. She eyed a man who was snapping pictures of the goblin like creatures.
"Reformed demon, not good. No one is only good after all,"
“Abel! Chamuel?” Sam spoke into the phone.
"Is that going to go to your head?" He asked with a smile.
"Abel we can talk about this later," Chamuel spat back.
A knock on the door alerted the group, Cain shot up from his spot on the floor. He had been sleeping beside Mishka but seemed to have rolled off the bed at some point. His hair stuck out in all directions, dark rings under his eyes,
“And I’m Sam,” the man interrupted, “Sam Winchester,”
"Yes, there are five." Bodhi replied, he watched the evil spirit settle over the head of a man with dark hair. The first king. He could see the outlines of the others with their LionHearts but couldn't figure out the details.
"Well that's up to her," Bailey replied with a shrug, pulling her sunglasses off and cleaning them anxiously on her shirt.
"I can say whatever I want," He said,
“Let’s just pull over, I think you could use some sleep on an actual bed,” Abel looked at Chamuel as if he were about to argue but seemed to think better of it. He nodded slightly,
Abel winked at Chamuel, as if to say "told ya" before beaming at Butch.
“Are you listening?” Sam asked, cutting Abels thought process in half.
"Cherm, attack," he snarled, but the shadow didn't move. The bald man grinned at him, his eyes glowed red as more ribbons exploded from his body. Cain clenched his weapon, using it to smack the ribbons away.
Abel shuffled uncomfortably for a heart beat, "I'm the new janitor. Well, at least for a day or two," he chuckled, holding out his hand to the chubby man, "Names Pete Mitchell, and you?"
"Salt," Chamuel said, grabbing a box that was set on the table near the door as the angel made towards the couch. He tossed the box to the other, falling onto the sofa at the same time. Abel snagged the box out of the air, opening the top with a quick motion of his hand he sprinkled the salt in front of the door. Thankful for the extra boxes of the sodium Sam had left for them earlier in the day.
"Well, I like that better. Rolls off the tongue more,"
“I'm scared,” He admitted, “I was a low level angel, and they decided to bump me to archangel and since then I haven’t felt anything but fear,”
The red head walked to the middle of the roof, gravel scattered around the area aside from a small patch of grass with a table and chairs set up. Possibly for meetings? The angel didn't care as he followed her towards the chairs.
"Did you Matilda me up?" Abel asked with a smirk, Chamuel shrugged.
The earpieces in his ears playing the latest true crime podcast as he glanced through Abel's twitter, but there wasn't anything tagged on where he could possibly be, the demon had sent the man a message as well but they've been ignored completely.
"You okay? Do you want...some candy?" He held out the bag, "Long story on how I got it," he chuckled. She shook her head, waving a hand at the chocolates.
Everyone looked shocked, staring at Chamuel with wide eyes. Waiting in silence for the angel to talk,
"Erm, cause it's one of my inventions, just click down the green button and flick the lighter. That's normal settings, if you ever use it, remember XYZ!" Cain blinked a few times, glancing at Donnie before returning to the lighter. A smile broke over his features, "wow...that's, really cool, xyz?" he chuckled, opening the lighter again.
"More like all angels," Chamuel chimed in.
"Please...no you're my Lionheart! How can I be king without my Lionheart!" Donnie shouted, he could hear his family fighting. He could hear them losing.
Everytime the movie changed, he would change to fit accordingly. Arphaxat kept up with him easily as the two danced from one scene to the next.
"Sorry I uh--" he face turned a shade of red, "Thanks for helping Robin, the guy-- he doesn't really catch a break," Baal laughed, "Plus, he means a lot to Danjal,"
"Are you sick?" The man asked, turning to his partner.
Abel nodded slowly as their lips pressed, he wrapped his arms around the other and pulled him into his lap. Arphaxat smiled brightly at the other,
"You can gank those things?" She turned to him with wide eyes. He shot her a grin, "I can gank those things,"
Abel and Chamuel glanced at one another as they sat in the kitchen, living room mix. The two demons on the couch, the pair sitting against the counter. Chamuel drinking down a redbull, getting ready for whatever was about to happen.
"I don't like 'em much either," He said finally.
"That's probably our best bet," he whispered finally, rubbing his arms, the sweater vest was warm but not warm enough for the cold weather that settled over the parking lot.
"You should take that jacket off," Chamuel whispered,
"Nope! Keep 'em shut no matter what!"
"I think I need help,"
"Hey Cham," Abel turned towards his friend who looked over at him with a frown settled on his face.
"Be on guard, somethings wrong with him and I can't place it," Sam whispered to his Nephew as the group made for the stairs. Abel walked beside Cain, trying to catch the man's eye but he seemed to be fixated on making his way to the apartment. The king's phone buzzed in his pocket, he pulled it out and frowned at the message from Mishka.
"Saint Bernard, what do I owe this pleasure?" He asked the man, turning in his large, red chair placing his hands on the cherry wood in front of him. The man known as Bernard smiled, his voice soothing but the devil knew better than to believe the man had any holy intentions.
“So we gotta do this tomorrow,”
Chamuel felt a chill skyrocket through his veins as he looked at Abel in horror, “How...would he look the same?” He murmured,
"Are you guys alive?" Morris called into the room, pushing open the door lightly. Chamuels hands returned to normal, though he could still feel the power flicking between his fingers.
"I don't know, Chammy," Abel eyed the skyscrapers as they moved into the heart of the big city. Christmas lights danced against the buildings that flew past as the Impala moved smoothly, the air outside was cold, clouds moved in from all directions but the sun continued to shine.
"Man, that dirty dog." Abel snorted.
The demon's frown grew as he hoisted Abel up by the arm. There was an anger in the demons eyes that caused Abel to wince.
"Faith wouldn't have it, she prayed to the Father, begging him. He answered," The wind started to die down, the pain in Israfils voice filled the room with a strong sadness.
"You'll figure it out, J." She chuckled, "Get some sleep! Tomorrow's a big day," Cherry let out a meow before pelting after the woman and happily padding beside her as she walked up the few steps to the home and ducked inside. That was a weird conversation, Danjal mused to himself as he got to his feet and made his way back into the small room. Robin glanced up at him from where he sat on his bed,
"Maybe it's--" He grumbled to himself, rubbing his liver spotted forehead. Mammon and Onoskelis share a look of irritation at the older man's speed. The balding man typed into the key again, it let out another angry beep causing him to huff.
“Take a picture, Goliath, it will last longer,” Abel snapped at Sam, glancing back at Uriel.
"You're what's happening," he yelled out, Chamuel raised his hand as if to stop the others' words only for Abel to flinch away. Something. Was deeply wrong. He never flinched from Chamuel even on their worst days.
"This the haunted...Miller place?" Abel asked, holding up the business card.
"So," she started, getting to her feet and going behind him. She raced her fingers through his hair a few times, it was clean but she could see he had a few scars on the skull where hair didn't grow in making her heart sink.
“What is it?”
Chapter 58: Vampires vs. Werewolves
"An angel?" Robin whispered as he trotted towards Gretchen, his eyes moving to Danjal who was lazily making his way towards them. Seeing the danger had passed he didn't seem to mind walking slower, she looked toward Robin with a puzzled expression.
“Can...I talk to Abel alone?”
Cain gasped a few times, his hands trembled violently as the veins under his skin started to pop out and turn green. After a few more rapid breaths he let his palms fall onto the man's skin, the glow died away. The only part of the bruise that was left was a large bite mark above the hunters ribcage.
"Cain used his own Adinkra," Abel pointed out.
"They're more than good," Chamuel laughed, holding up his phone to show Mishka's new profile picture.
"Oh okay, sorry"
"Abel!"
As if on cue the city opened up before the angel's eyes, his smile grew wide as the giant Christmas tree stood before him. He gasped so loud Abel heard it over the rush of the wind, since he met Chamuel the man always talked about seeing the Rockefeller Christmas tree at night. It was something the angel always called 'silly'. Abel had been plotting this since he first heard the blonde mention it.
"Do you think that this boy's soul...do you think he's using it to control the Adinkra?" Bailey murmured, glancing at Baal who looked mortified, she saw an anger flair up in him. His skin boiled as he turned to look around for an exit.
"I-- met this being," Chamuel reached into his pocket, pulling out the small vial with brilliant blue liquid inside. It shone vividly in the morning sunlight.
"Are we talking all heights? Or do I have to throw the guy from a plane?" Obizuth asked with an arched eyebrow.
"Worried? About Cham?" Abel asked, stumbling with each movement as the drugs continued to pump through his system.
"Run run run leave the whore,"
"Me too, fuck," Chamuel murmured, slamming into the other harder until the pleasure peaked, causing the angel to moan out the mans name as he came to his end. Abel felt the build spill over, he shouted out Chamuels full name as his orgasm shuttered through his body. Hearing his full name being shouted sent the angel to the edge as his orgasm followed not long after, he sucked in air as he finished up inside his lover.
"Come in but quickly," she said, her eyes troubled.
The wolves took a few steps forward only for Bohdi to speak up,
"It's just…I guess I'm having a hard time figuring out why I'd even want to save the world," he admitted, "I mean, since I've been here...on Earth just," sighing as he attempted to find the words.
"Whatever," She snorted.
The violin started, as if on cue a wind kicked up around them. It ruffled the books, flickered the candles but the salt remained where it stood. Unmoving against the harsh breeze that was getting stronger, Bailey watched as Dutch's earpiece glowed vivid purple that caused the veins on her neck to pop out from the stress of using her power. Eyes slowly opening to the word around them, Dutch could hear now. But she couldn't hear the world she sat in, she heard worlds far different from this one. Able to hear the sounds of thousands.
Abel's phone lit up against the darkness, he glanced down at it in surprise as the older hunter plucked the police radio off the dash and started to mess with it.
"Who are you?" Baal wanted to feel fearful, anxious, or angry but he only felt a calm presence beside the other.
"We're only an hour out,"
The two locked eyes, Castiel let out a breath, "I've known of him since his birth,"
"I hate you," Chamuel whispered, Abel snorted.
Bailey blasted through a red light, she didn't care. Something was wrong, her Adinkra whined loudly into the air as if trying to warn her. Israfil's did the same, causing her to panic more.
"They keep you safe from Jinn, and since that...man, was a saint I'm guessing normal Christianity stuff wouldn't work on him. But this! Worked like a charm. I'm happy I grabbed it," she chuckled, he nodded slowly letting the necklace go. Watching it sway lightly against her chest,
The two exchanged numbers, Sam giving him Baal's cell as well before the doctor excused himself.
"You can't do that later?" The other asked, laying back down in the warm sheets. The sun wasn't even awake yet.
"So cool, I feel like an action hero," Abel laughed, Baal nodded at him, watching the screens with wide eyes. He'd only known the genius for a day and he continued to be shocked by all the man did.
"How do y--"
Abel bit his lip attempting to find a way to comfort the other. He was never good at comfort especially running on no sleep and twelve hours into a car ride.
"Danjal you're not this stupid, I refuse to believe it,"
"Oh? Are you?" Sam said in slight surprise,
"You're lying to me," She whispered, "The angels told me. You've been lying, Cain, you're lying now."
"It's fine, trust me," Sam gave the other a reassuring smile, "Cham won't kill you unless you go for Abel, trust me,"
"I tend to take my dates out star gazing," He admitted, "Drives the woman crazy,"
His father grabbed him by the arm once more, pulling him up with such force the child yelped in agony.
"Yes, sorry. Proceed with the plan,"
He was nearing the end of his day now, according to Obizuth, Sam was somewhere close by and the man could feel the itch in his skin to find and meet the other. He knew Abel was a trusting man, too trusting, considering he was being easily manipulated. It wouldn't be difficult to find his way into the others inner circle, especially considering they shared blood.
"Mom, I think I found my angel,"
"Of Abel? Hurting you or something?"
Honey brown gaze filled with concern, 'you are so cute' Donnie thought, his brother's words snapped him back to reality. Brushing the tears from his eyes and looking back at the man,
"Wait, Gretchen and Otto?"
"There's gotta be something I can do, that demon just walked into Abel's head like he has some VIP pass,"
Sam gave the other an irritated look as he got on the back of the demon's motorcycles.
The pair had gone around the town as the afternoon sun dipped behind the trees, asking questions, writing things down and attempting to understand what they could.
"Who are you?" Abel asked,
"Are you really an angel?" One asked, clenching a superhero doll in his arms, his deep brown gaze matched his skin tone, with shaggy, long curls rolling down his shoulders.
"Let's go!" He hissed out, Donnie pulled the wires from his laptop letting them dangle out of the car. He didn't have time to deal with it anymore, backing up and turning to leave.
"Yeah? Me too, you don't kiss a guy and then tell him you can't 'do this with them'" Abel snorted, Chamuel felt his heart shatter in his chest. Anger flared through the angel,
Israfil seemed to ponder this for a while before finally speaking up, despite the soft hangover that was starting behind his eyes.
"Aw, you miss me, Sugar Cain?" She asked with a flirtatious touch on her lips. He heard another voice in the background, it belonged to a man now which made him stop walking.
"I can't wait either!" He laughed, "I'm so excited I have goosebumps!"
“Have you seen all these tapes in here?” Chamuel asked, holding a box of them in his arms.
"Abel if he's a Winchester I'm killing you both," She huffed,
"What can kill Baal?" Cain finally asked, clearing his throat causing Cherm to sink into the floor slowly. She watched the shadow melt into Cain's body before turning attention back to the other.
"Devil makes it something...not suspicious," She sputtered out, "The actual mark in a few layers of skin below. If it's not removed by a certain time it'll settle on the bone,"
"It's trailer--" Abel started to say, brushing his bangs out of his face with a hand. Using his other hand to read the message on his phone.
Abel raced down the stairs, skidding to a halt on the hardwood floor. Chamuel immediately went to the other, he felt anger burn in his veins but not towards the hunter. More towards himself.
"I'll get you a beer after this,"
“He’s with you, that’s how it works. Sorry sweet cheeks,”
Danjal paused, "Go back in the other room," He said to Robin, turning to look at the other. His eyes black as the night,
“Well, I mean, you think there's only one God?” Chamuel turned to Abel, looking at the other confused.
Abel and Chamuel moved quickly, shoes brushing the black floors below. The angels grace flashing over the pictures on the wall to their right. Abel glanced over, for a heartbeat he swore he saw a set of red, round glasses on one of the pictures but pushed this to the back of his head.
Bernard glared, "Fucking Hahasiah, blessing the world with controlling the universes magic,"
Mammon laughed at this causing the woman to shoot him a dark glare, the man continued with his fiddling before it let out a small click. The electric key flashed green as the case whirled before clicking open. The inside glowed a vivid gold, causing the demons to grin wildly at the old man. He huffed and laughed, pushing the case open.
Israfil busied himself by picking at the skin on his finger tips before glancing back at Chamuel, "how are you gonna do that?"
The older hunter rolled his eyes, snapping a pill in half and handing her one. She shoved the half pill into Chamuel's hand. The angel looked down at the white pill with blank eyes.
Why were they here? Mishka watched the handful of people who played pool, drank some beer, and a few tossed darts at a dart board not far away. It was quiet despite the news on the television and the occasional whack of billiard balls. Mishka kept quiet, smiling at the woman behind the bar who chatted with a bald headed man. His nice suit stood out against the rest of the crowd who wore shirts and jeans. His cartoon tie made her tilt her head, it was an odd addition to his very professional feeling vibes.
Mammon shouted after him, clawing his way to his feet. Robin didn't listen as he tore his way through the door, Mammon's friends were slowly picking themselves up. He noticed a few were missing but silently wondered if they had retreated. Before any of them could react he pulled an arrow out, shooting. A silver arrow slammed into the werewolves chest causing him to howl out as blood pooled from his mouth and he collapsed, flinching at the others death he turned on the vampire.
Abel could almost feel Chamuel's anger as she swung the knife again, Abel went down to avoid the blow. Putting both hands on her hips and shoving her backwards.
Chamuel nodded slowly, feeling the anger wash through him but it slowly faded as the other rubbed his arm lightly.
"If Cham goes down and sees all that shit he's gonna think I'm dead,"
"I didn't...I can't…" He sighed, running his bloody hand through his hair.
"You might surprise yourself!" He let the other go, sitting back down on the bed and picking up the remote. Ancitif sat down beside the man, a small smile on his face as he felt relaxed with his friend.
"Let's get inside the room" Abel whispered against the others lips, "I'd rather not end up naked in front of our room,"
"What're you gonna do with him?" Baal asked as Bailey held the golden trinket up in the moonlight. She frowned as she noticed the green light in the vile had completely faded.
"Unlikely friendship," He whispered. "Why are they at a museum?"
"That's the question!" Abel mused, "we can ask Israfil. He'd probably know--"
"This isn’t helping,” Sam placed his drink on the table with force, “This isn’t a game! You can, and will, get hurt! You could die!”
Abel flinched at the others words, since he 'broke up' with Arphaxat he felt as if his heart was empty. Not to mention his desire for the drugs the other had given him was starting to drive him up a wall.
The air turned cold, tense, the moms smile died. Her eye twitched lightly, opening her jaw and hacking out a “Winchester?”
The pair left not too long after, the sound of distant screeching, or was it laughing, didn't bother the doctor. He was in the middle of New York, the odd noises weren't something he would bat an eye at.
"You are king!" Cherm snarled, "they bow before you!"
"We'll look into that, we have some important stuff to take care of."
"What do you think of this?" Abel finally said, breaking the silence, turning to look at the man and waving a hand in the air as he spoke. "This entire...Jesus thing?"
"Told you he was no good, I thought I saw that little fuck going into Danjal's bar."
The phone let out a whine, Sam's name popping up on the screen. Bailey answered with a smile,
"I am happy with you,"
Arphaxat leaned in to hear what Obizuth was about to say, letting his hand rest on the large reptile tank, glancing between them as the red head grinned broadly at the brunette, "How good are you with Hell hounds?"
Chamuel turned the other over, pushing his hair out of his tear stained face. The angel took his friends shoes and socks off, pulling him out of the jacket and helping get him into more comfortable clothes.
"I ordered a few rounds, hope you don't mind," Arphaxat murmured. Abel turned his head back to the other, blinking away his general anxiety as he took the alcohol, downing it and slamming the glass to the wooden table top below.
"You don't have a key?" Morris asked.
Abel wasn't listening as he looked down towards the ground. The stairs went so far down they turned to a blurr near the bottom. It was all open, with only a single sheet of glass to keep him from falling over. He felt nauseous at the height.
“Help?”
"I'm sorry," he growled, "I'm just buzzed, make it stop." He growled.
"Old enough," Abel shot back, mimicking the movie.
"He's a doctor, not a plastic surgeon," Chamuel grunted out, shakenly sitting up. The pain was still there but he felt as if he could move even just a bit. Lacing his fingers with Abel's, causing butterflies to roll through his chest.
This story is currently being revamped to fit an original narrative without Supernatural (The show) being used. It's going to be published as a series of books! Due to this, certain descriptions of characters or personalities might shift (not much don't worry) . Eventually, the entire fic might be paused but unknown. It's all up in the air and I hope you're enjoying your ride so far!
"Can't you see? You are me!" He laughed as the dragon's face turned to Cain's. Cain gasped loudly as the monstrous dragon let out a roaring laugh.
The hare didn't respond, it turned and hopped itself to a large concrete stone. It sat ominously in the middle of the large swamp, he couldn't even see the top it went so high. Abel placed a hand on the stone, it pulsed under his palm as though it were alive.
'Kurty you're not doing it right!' young Abel laughed.
"Even Sam? The guy's the definition of 'early bird gets the worm'!"
"No no," Danjal murmured to himself, shaking his head as if to clear the negativity that flooded his mind, "Robin deserves to have a crush, I don't even think I've seen him on a date," He said to himself, the soft laugh of a man beside him made him jump out of his skin. He looked down at the dark skinned human who wore a western looking suit as if he were a sheriff in an old movie with a cowboy hat covering his graying hair.
“I know it’s not masculine, but, I just...felt like you’d like it,” He turned away from Abel, his face turning a darker shade of red. His ears tinted in red too causing the hunter to laugh, “Naw, jewelry doesn’t have a gender,” Abel replied with a chuckle, pulling the necklace from the others hand.
"I should have asked for someone elses help," Arphaxat scoffed,
"Come on Goose,"
Sam shrugged, "This is my friend, Butch," he nodded to Butch who nodded back, "fellow hunter, computer wiz, tattoo artist!"
The storm clouds grumbled above as Abel and Chamuel drove down the street, the two had collected a handful of things they thought they’d need, Salt, silver, iron, the works! Chamuel even packed a shotgun loaded with shotgun shells filled with Salt though he wasn’t sure if they’d need them against the creatures they'd be facing.
"Look, the internet isn't some search machine anymore like when you were a kid, yaknow, when dinosaurs walked the earth,"
"You need to leave," Bohdi said coldly,
Chamuel had never seen him hate his own gender identity so much, since meeting Abel the man acted like a rock when it came to his gender. The intense sadness that rolled from the other caused Chamuel's heart to shatter. He couldn't even begin to understand what the man was struggling with.
"Transgender," Cain scoffed, "Why pick someone who's not even a man?" He growled to himself,
"Sam?"
The room had a dim light, drawings, maps, pictures and paperwork covered the walls with red string flowing from some of them. A small bed pushed against the wall with a single window that opened onto the roof. String lights hung down from the ceiling, knocking Chamuel lightly on the head as he stood to full height. Abel noticed a few pictures of him and Chamuel as well scattered about from their instagram. Was this how it felt to be famous? The kid was acting like they were his idols.
"I'm not savvy at this, but I think I'm getting it down," Sam said with a hint of pride in his voice, pulling the laptop so it was in front of him again.
"Nope, just keep an eye out. Don't trust him," Sam said, Abel couldn't make heads or tails as to why Sam said not to trust the man. Butch had helped them from the start and suddenly he wasn't to be trusted? Yet Sam trusted a demon King?
"I...should have listened to you about it being a trap," Danjal admitted, rubbing his sore head as he did so. "They caught me off guard," He chuckled.
Though the memories filled him with warmth the empty look in the others eyes made his heart break, his green gaze almost seemed to be grey in the light of the cloudy sun. There was definitely something wrong with his friend, he'd been so blinded by guilt he hadn't noticed.
"Hey, I know this looks bad, but uh," He looked to Chamuel who was staring with horror in his gaze back.
Abel gasped as Chamuel landed in front of him, breaking the concrete under his pink shoes. Abel felt his shoulders drop as the angel went to him, wrapping him in his arms Abel melted into the other. The pair went down to the floor as Abel clung to the man, he hated himself heavily now. Just that morning the flood of hate he received from thousands of followers really got to him. After nearly dying in a burning building he wasn't expecting to come home to such a flood of hatred. Now it collected on him more, he wasn't good enough in any way to be king.
"You fell down the stairs, I thought you broke your neck!" Chamuel laughed, Abel struggled to stand up, the Angel caught him by the arm and hoisted him to his feet.
She shook him again, feeling a new panic in her. Was he dead? Could a demon die? She hadn't considered it.
was written in red marker, he narrowed his eyes at the little piece of brown, earthy looking root that has been stuck to the paper. Popping it into his mouth without hesitation, blinking a few times and shutting his eyes as the bitter taste covered his tongue. It was as if he had taken a bite out of the ground outside.
They fell silent again as they sloshed through the ever growing fog, a soft clicking noise caused the hunter to freeze. Their breath billowed out in a fog, cold chills rolled through the brothers.
"Well, you know how Donnie got bit by a werewolf?" Sam started, Bailey shot Baal a look of horror.
"Let's go back to Norma's," She murmured, holding his face in her hands. He looked at her with a puzzled look at his face. He couldn't understand her, no matter how many times he thought he got a handle on her he didn't. Everyone else was easy, he could switch his personality to accommodate depending on who of the group he was with.
Shit.
"It's a shell!"
Abel nodded to the voice, he pressed himself against the wall. Making his way across the white, dark exterior of the building. Taking in a few breathes as he tried not to think about how high up in the sky they would have to go. As they got closer to the front he could hear the woman talking angrily to Baal, the man spoke in a hushed tone but he could tell the demon was attempting to lie to the others face.
"Banana split? My mom-- our mom, always says it,"
"Yeah, good idea. I need to shower anyways," He said softly, watching as Abel curled up in the blankets once more. Chamuel laid beside him, watching as the man fell rapidly into the darkness of sleep.
The pair were seated in a small bar with a man, he looked as if he'd just walked out of an Indiana Jones novel. With his explorer's attire, old sandy backpack and sun kissed skin,
"Do you want me to raise my hand to go to the bathroom too?" Chamuel asked, arching an eyebrow at the other angel.
“You’re good dude, you got ‘em,” he said to the man,
"Donnie you're so stupid! He practically radiates when he looks at you,"
"Maybe that's why the power went out?" Chamuel mused.
"It's sad," Hani gasped out, "how people use the love of their God as a means to corrupt and manipulate,"
"I think so," He chuckled, rolling his hands against the wood of the desk beside him. He could feel the prickle of the magic in his fingers but couldn't figure out how to get it to work the way he imagined it.
"But Lucifer see's him as a traitor, wants to get back at him,"
"Until then, start doing your job."
"You're being a bitch," she swatted the DNA test paperwork from his hands. He clenched his fists in anger,
Cain wouldn't mind being with a man, in fact, he found them rather appealing but being with women was easier, he never had to question their sexuality, deal with rejection. He was handsome, a doctor, it wasn't hard to find a woman who would satisfy any of his cravings but a man? That was a different story.
"No, I'm looking…" he bit his lip, before his eyes danced back to the front window. He froze when he saw the hashtag 'heavens traitors' had been sloppily written in marker on the glass. He felt a sudden sense of excitement, his smile grew wider now as he looked at the pair.
This caused Chamuel to shuffle uncomfortable, “I mean, yeah, for soul mates. It’s...incredibly rare to the point I’ve never even seen it. Why?” He glanced at Abel now, tilting his head to the side with a quizzical look, following the movement of unbuckling himself.
"Not sure," Baal admitted, pulling out a small bottle of hand sanitizer. "We won't know till we get it."
"Well, wasn't this all put together by Faith?" Ziggy asked, his eyes moved to his friend, "right, Edgar?"
The angel sighed, shaking his head, "Dean the other angels noticed your absence,"
“It’s a car”
"Inside everyone! Come on! It's getting cold!" Vanilla shouted.
"Yeah, well, we all know you're gonna be right," Baal said, nodding to her. She wiggled her shoulders, pushing the dark glass back over her eyes.
'Born again' Donnie thought, his eyes moved back to Robin. He grabbed the man causing the police to hold up their weapons. Danjal turned, rage in his eyes until he saw the wolf place the demon on his back.
"Why...would they be giving Cain this?" She whispered, taking the glass vial from the other who shrugged lightly.
"We need to get you a jacket or something," Abel suddenly didn't feel safe. Bobby's had possibly been compromised. Rubbing Chamuel’s arm lightly as if attempting to keep the other warm with the movement.
Sam punched in the key code, glancing back at Abel and back to the gate.
“I know things,” he replied flatly, grabbing his jacket off the floor and brushing dust off of it. He pulled a pocket knife from his boot, making towards the hunter. Sam felt himself tense up at the look of the blade,
The sound of the guitar faded out, Israfil hopped up onto his feet as the lights flickered back on. The man grinned wide at the smaller man, wrapping an arm around the angel's shoulder with a laugh.
"How can you tell?"
"But I like cold blooded creatures."
Arphaxat nodded slowly, reaching for the man and racing his hand up and down the hunters back.
"Hey! Look at you," Abel laughed, taking the bag.
“Why are they soundproof?” Chamuel asked, tilting his head at the hunter.
"An idea?"
Donnie growled, clenching his teeth as he buried his face into the others chest.
His voice cracked painfully as tears made his vision blur,
"I'm on Team Born again, and me and Israfil are going to save all of you! These demons, creatures, this darkness, me and…" He smiled down at Israfil again, who seemed to glow.
The door opened a few seconds later, Cain turned attention to the opened door with his hands hidden behind his back. Giving the head of the hospital a smile,
"Yeah, it smelled terrible down there too. Worse than in here! I'd have needed at least three showers," Chamuel chuckled,
The two took off, laughing as they moved through the spaceship. Hunting a large black creature, its mouth opening to show another inside. Abel shot a few times causing the monster to explode in a mess of blood,
Just as he spoke, the floor under them shook lightly. Large, dark, ghost-like shapes flew from under the school before throwing themselves at the two. Without a thought Abel ducked down, Chamuel’s eyes glowed and with a sweep of his arm the ghosts vanished against his light.
"Is she your best friend? Or did she trap you into thinking that?"
Ancitif dropped from the window with a grunt, holding the skink to his chest as he fell into a bush. The snowy branches poked at him, he held the upset lizard close to him to prevent the creature from being stabbed by the sharp wood. Pushing his way out of the frozen bush the man took off running down the cold, empty streets, taking in air as he went. Tears racing down his cheeks, for all he knew he just signed Danjal's death warrant.
"I'm going to check on everyone else," Norma said with a smile before ducking out of the room. Abel took a few bites of his burger,
His eyes flew open with shock, he'd never had that happen before. No matter what seemed to go on with his new archangel statues he was always able to transfer and take emotions with no problem. Was something stopping him?
"No way, you're going to swing a bat,"
"People suck, man," Abel whispered
"That's not far," Bailey said with a nod. Baal dropped the demon with a nod, satisfied with the answer the pair turned and headed for the door.
He glanced down at Mammon's body with a snort, "Come on now! Lazy," He scoffed out with a snap of his fingers. Mammon gasped, coming to life once more as his body shuddered under the darkness that seeped from the floor and into him. Lucifer pulled out his phone, playing a game as he awaited for his son to return to life and continue on with his mission.
"Just take it, Sam." Fran laughed, "trust me, Dean would want you to have it."
"You two go on, I need to talk to Chamuel!"
"I think it's up," Chamuel whispered,
"So now we only have a few paintings, murals, texts and information about it all." He continued, taking a few sips from the beer that sat beside him on the table.
Chamuel laughed now, sniffling as he felt the tears beginning to stop. Brushing them away with the back of his free hand, watching Abel's fingers as he let them trace over his skin.
Israfil tuned out the conversation, pulling his phone out. He had been tagged in the picture from the night before, stating "Team Born again is here to save the world." With the hashtags. His own profile now had "#BornAgain official member" with a blue check next to the name that Donnie had swindled the website into giving the group.
"Sam, you got any sigil's in that head of yours that can lock a door?"
A chubby woman leapt up from her spot in one of the chairs, her bright pink lipstick curved upwards with a smile. She wore a satin pink flowing shirt with a blue plaid skin that ran down past her knees. She waved a hand in the air at them, her white high heels clicked softly against the concrete underfoot.
Danjal no longer listened to Robin, he shoved past the smaller man and grabbed the robber who screamed in fear. He tossed the man against the wall before he had time to ready his weapon,
"Double tap?" Chamuel whispered, having expected Abel to say it himself but the hunter remained silent. Not even looking at the blonde.
"We need the prophecy, what's wrong with breaking and entering?" Abel asked, Chamuel spoke up this time. His blue eyes troubled as he glanced towards his boyfriend
Israfil took a step back, his shoe slipping. With a deep breath he felt power coursing through his veins, power he'd never felt before. His wings unfurled from his back, letting out a hiss of agony as the guitar music continued. His strumming turned the tunnels bright, the creature shuffled away from them for a heart beat. Melting into the dark waters, but Israfil knew what would happen.
"Are you sure you're going to be okay?" Danjal whispered to the vampire, who rushed his strawberry blonde locks from his face and ran his fingers down his tight blue jeans as if he was attempting to get rid of the dirt that collected on the back.
"That shouldn't be possible," Chamuel said into the speaker, "unless he's one of the king's I guess?"
"Don't call me that,"
She shook him a few times, "Baal! Get up!" She hissed, keeping her voice low. She didn't know if anyone was in this small room, eyes moving to the top where a small bit of light shimmered through the trap door, a few more wooden trap doors could be seen as well as though the ground of the church was made of them.
"It seems you were successful," the man mused, Jegudiel grinned brightly towards the other.
Bailey got to her feet, "no offense," she started, shoving her hands in her jacket pockets.
"I love you, Abel Winchester," Chamuel whispered against the other's lip.
"The guy just made this account, it's probably a lie to lure us into some abandoned building,"
"Bailey, you're rambling,"
"P-Party, yeah hah, just you know, having a good time," She felt her face turn redder at the stutter in her voice.
Abel snatched the extinguisher from the other, pulling the pin and pointing. He let the foam loose over the demonic animals who roared in confusion, the white covered the room before it exhausted itself.
"So...only a king can use it?" Cain asked, he couldn't keep the fear out of his voice. He had been told his entire life he was the King, angels were wrong and he was meant to be the chosen one, was his friend lying? Was this a trick?
"For...saving us," she murmured.
"Wait, how can you see me?" Dean asked, nodding at Bailey who shrugged.
“Er uh, thanks,” he chuckled, “I got it from Kohls, I think,”
He raced towards Chamuel again, Obizuth used her larger hand to swat at Abel but he slid under it in the grass. Silently wishing he had cleats as he stopped beside the fire, he locked eyes with Chamuel. Giving the angel a wink,
"You have a painful decision to make, Cain," The man said, ignoring Cain's question. He placed a few cards down in front of the other, the doctor had never seen these cards before. They all looked as if the front was made of stained glass, with beautiful pictures in the center and words carefully written on the bottom.
'I got love' Abel thought, his mind moved to Chamuel, to Sam, to his friends. He shut his eyes tight against the roaring corpses, taking in a breath. This was his mind. This wasn't Arphaxat's. This was his.
"It should be your style," Mishka chuckled, she wrapped an arm around his waist and held up her phone.
Cain and Abel walked through the fog below, both men keeping at a quick pace. The soft groan, flutter and movement of animals could be heard but neither of the hunters paid the odd creatures any mind. Snakes with three heads, deers with multiple antlers, even rats with unusual colors raced around their feet.
"You might have to dig," Sam finally said,
"Give it a few minutes," Arph said with a smile, "I know Abel pretty well, this place will turn him upside down. When he's asking for help?" The smile that crept over the demons features sent a chill down Butch's spine. "You take that necklace."
"And...you ain't gonna double cross me? Get it for ya'self?"
“You know what is odd!” Donnie piped up, “I haven’t heard a single thing about...well anything since the darkness showed up,”
"Cham, this isn't your fault," Sam whispered softly.
"Hey Cain," Abel started, hesitating
"Because you're cute, but you can be hot. Look," she walked around to look him in the face. Kneeling down to his level,
“I...don’t know, Chams.” rubbing his head lightly as he tried to put the puzzle together only for his thoughts to be dashed.
"Nothing! But don't just tell people were having foreplay,"
"Yeah? And we're Team Born Again, we'll wipe you off this planet!" Mishka shouted.
"I'm pretty sure he's also in love with you," He nodded, "Last night your mother asked him what his sexuality is when he was helping her wash dishes. You know what he said?"
"With who?" Bailey asked, leaning towards the other. The demon shook his head,
"I think we can handle a ghost,"
"Shit," Donnie whispered,
"Someone's in your office, she said it's urgent, also your second DNA test results are on the desk," the nurse didn't look at him, he'd snap at her often and suddenly he felt a rush of guilt. What was happening to him? Was he going soft? Maybe. But part of him liked it.
"Cham, do you really want to be here with me or...is this just an assignment,"
Leaning against the house, racing his fingers through his hair as he thought of the angel. He suddenly felt dizzy, tying into his phone before placing it to his ear once more. He heard soft chatting before his mothers voice jumped into the receiver,
"The human would come here, an angel would use the grace in these stones to take the human soul and put it in Heaven, it was seen as more humane since the vessels body undergoes a lot of pain and stress when an angel takes it," Bailey eyed the large rock for a few seconds before glancing down at him.
Abel held out his phone, rubbing his eye as he attempted to wake himself up. The angel snatched it from him, silently watching the video. His face turned from a neutral expression to horror.
"Let's smoke! Me, you, and that bear you call Danjal," Abel laughed, Robin's smile brightened his face.
“Or what's left of it,” Abel pointed out, “Alright alright, he thinks we’re talking to him about our paychecks, we offer him some of this tea you made yourself, he drinks it, croaks and dies, then we get the hell outta dodge,”
"Alright, who's smoking what?" Donnie asked, clapping his hands together. "I got weed, I got hookah!" He laughed.
"Cham, stop," Abel grabbed his boyfriend's hand, the man turned to look at Abel and moved attention back to the other.
"We're the only ones with fake ID badges," Chamuel said with a shrug, "besides, we don't have to go far up, just a few floors."
"I'm...home," He whispered,
Chamuel felt fire burn in his veins at the comment, only for Sam to pop into the conversation. Chamuel didn't hear what the older hunter said, glancing back down at his phone. Absentmindedly scrolling through a few websites in an attempt to calm down. Cain frowned as he attempted to find some form of comfort to give to the blonde but he couldn't come up with anything, he wasn't big on comforting but he wanted to. An odd feeling for the doctor, as he only ever cared to comfort his mother.
"We're wasting daylight," Chamuel chuckles, handing them back to Abel, "but have it noted I can steal them whenever I want,"
"Look, Chammy?"
"Make me,"
After an hour or so he seemed to calm down, pulling away from her and blinking around him.
"Shush Max!" She turned to him, crossing her arms over her chest with a huff. Donnie's father came from behind his son and went to his wife. Grabbing her by the hips making her laugh as he wrapped his arms around her.
"How do you even know how'ta play?" Abel asked Sam, taking another shot of alcohol with a groan.
"Cain,"
“Can’t say I know,” Baal said, turning his cellphone off and taking the car out of park.
"No, look," Chamuel pointed to the men again, Abel cranked his neck to try and see what Cham was pointing out. Sitting behind the men, though it was a little blurry, was the picture they'd been looking for.
Chamuel blinked a few times and sat up, "I didn't think of that," he murmured, Israfil shrugged with a smile.
Everyone paused, glancing at Mishka who was crying now. Rubbing her eyes with the back of her oversized hoodie, Abel eyes the college name on the front.
"Doctor Shimon?"
"Okay everyone, another shot before we watch this, y'all need to be hammered," Mishka flipped through the movies on one of the many streaming services.
"Looks like it," Bailey murmured, Abel's lip twitched with stress. Feeling the angel's hand roll down his arm sent a spark through his system.
"Yeah good idea, chammy, plus it'll look like an actual ARG instead of a couple of schmucks running around in a shitty can"
"Maybe, but I'd rather assume she's just nice. Most people aren't out to manipulate and lie to you,"
"Who's Juliet?" Danjal asked, making his way towards Arrow and Robin. Placing a large hand on the animal's flank, the horse nuzzled into the man's palm as he rolled them up and down the creature's fuzzy cheeks.
"Oh, so cause I'm an inexperienced woman I can't go?"
"You've been out for like two years,"
Robin bit his lip, clenching his hands. If he didn't stop the darkness inside the bull soon it might be too late, though looking at the deformed creature before him he knew it might already be too late.
"Alright," Donnie tossed his backpack down on the floor and started to dig through it. He handed the angel a pair of goggles and a bright yellow vest, the angel tugged it on and winced as the goggles fell tight over his eyes, sticking to his skin uncomfortably.
"I'm not being dramatic!" He shouted, throwing his baseball bat to the snowy ground.
"Yeah? And Jesus was a normal guy when he started, you're just a normal guy right now but you're gonna shine brighter than all of us," Paul whispered the last part as if it held heavy meaning, it wasn't anything new. The wolf heard this often from Paul, the man had said this to him since childhood and he wasn't sure if it was because Paul was a good guy or if the man knew more than he let on.
“So it’s just more shit we gotta figure out,”
"Easy!" Mammon snorted, turning to Israfil, "we have a little inside help," he chuckled. "From what we understand, Israfil's Adinkra is the last one needed,"
The wolves started to circle him as if he were prey, yapping and laughing like hyenas as they did so. Their bodies were the same as their leader, bulging muscles being covered by raggedy fur, sharp teeth that stuck out of their lips in an unusual manner. Breaker slowly held his phone up over the chicken coop and thorny bushes they sat behind, allowing the pair to watch through the screen.
The feeling of wet droplets continued to fall over him as he sat on the bed. Curiosity burned into his mind, putting a hand over his eyes as he attempted to keep himself from ruining whatever surprise Abel had.
Abel took in a few breaths, grabbing his bat and holding it up as he got to his feet again. The creature's massive paws made contact with the thin ice, almost immediately it began to crack. Letting out loud, angry moans under the monster's weight.
"We got questions," Baal snarled, he and Sam stepping forward at the same time.
"You...you think I'm making you...feel these things, don't you?"
"How do we gank it?" She asked, trying to keep her voice low as their server mulled about the diner. She could hear he was listening to some sort of podcast as he went, the sound of a man babbling about Jesus.
"Wait," Sam whispered after her, but she didn't listen as she knelled down to the pattern in the ground.
"Man, I don't want too,"
"Angel of love? Like Cupid?" Abel glanced up at the man as he raced the comb through his brown locks.
"Don't follow me!" He shouted back, shoving his way past Bailey and Baal.
His eyes glanced up to the text message that flashed over his screen,
"I...was caught off guard but I played it cool, you know...or I tried. But I don't know, you just grew on me. Maybe because I knew you'd help me change, made me want to not be afraid,"
"N-no," Israfil murmured, "I'm looking for my friend," he started, though he wasn't sure how to describe him.
"I'm...not feeling good," He whispered, "I...maybe Cham will know how too--"
Robin ignored her colorful words, he stood up on the animal causing the woman to howl in confusion as his Adinkra shone bright. He felt its power in his fingers, it rolled through his veins and turned his hands to gold. He pulled back and a string of light extended from his hand, an arrow settled on the end. Pain exploded through Robin's body as he let the arrow fly, nearly falling from the sudden crash of energy and the agony in his hands. Stumbled and caught himself, clinging to his horse who trotted to a walk as the werewolves raced off.
"What...happened? Why are you here?" Abel asked
Israfil nodded slowly at this, still holding his friend.
His heart felt heavy, noticing a few drops of blood on the pillow he made his way to the restroom, glancing in the mirror at his forehead shocked to see the small hole in his skin where the thorn had pricked him, it was still bleeding a little and collecting on his sideburns.
"Don't worry, Abe, I got'cha! From now on, it'll just be me and you, right?"
"So he has an Adinkra?" Abel asked, Baal leaned against the wall just outside of the small door to their shared motel room. Fiddling with the paper in his hands, having sent a picture to the hunter on the other end of the phone.
Arphaxat shook his head, sighing, "That...was a rejection,"
Abel clicked his tongue, giving Chamuel a thumbs up as the three piled into the small car. Sam pulled out of the garage, attempting to ignore the soft chatter between the two. Something good must have happened, because the pair practically glowed as they talked with one another.
"Let's do this!"
“Oh no.”
His eyes tracing the giant cross of the church that stuck out in the ever ominous storm clouds above. It glowed in a heavenly light, his eyes moved to Bailey who stood beside him. Her gaze narrowed as she held her phone out to the other, a video of this Bill pastor performing a miracle was shown. The title 'the new Jesus?' was written over the video.
"I seem to have misread your situation," She laughed, "Your crush an all,"
"Abel, or should I say, Alice."
"Stop! Stop!" Bailey grabbed Sam's wrist.
"It's fine," Abel breathed, "I have a stupid birth control thing in me,"
"What do you normally drink?" She asked, the waitress smiled at them as Cain hesitated.
"Hey Merlin," Danjal said into the receiver as he pressed it to his ear.
"Ritual,"
Abel paused, feeling a prickle of anxiety at the other’s words. That was true, Chamuel had lied about the necklace, was he lying about other things? He did hardly know the angel after all, silently wondering if his desire to have a friend had clouded his judgement. It couldn't, could it?
He knew the noise would definitely be waking everyone up but maybe at this point it was a good thing? His phone died.
Mavis and Morris looked at each other in confusion, pulling out their phones in a hasty manner. Chamuel continued to film regardless,
"Fuck, why do they even have this?" Abel kicked the cardboard backing.
Bailey arched an eyebrow at the other, "do you?"
"How?" Arphaxat grumbled, the alcohol dulling his senses.
“I hate it too, but what else are we gonna do? Sam Winchester isn’t going to just roll over like a dog,”
Cain took a few more cautious steps to the other, sitting down at a small stool in front of the table. Fran's eyes reminded Cain of the milky way as they glowed in the rainbow of the sky.
"What? How? Isn't he in Heaven?"
"What even is the Grotto?" Danjal asked, grinning down at Donnie. The wolf scratched at his cheek rapidly, almost dog like before speaking.
Sam spotted something in the grass in the dead center of the field, the firefly was buzzing around it. A white rabbit hopped lazily past it only to scamper off in fear as the pair approached. Spray Paint had been placed here, the red color stuck up against the bright green grass, dread sank into his heart. He glanced to Bailey who ducked past him to inspect the color further,
"Always," Donnie murmured
"Weapons don't make shit real," she huffed, crossing her arms over her chest.
"What are you doing?"
"Seems like it, he's using it to heal people." Baal grunted out, Abel groaned and ran his fingers through his long hair. 'what the fuck' he mouthed at Chamuel.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Does this town feel...odd, to anyone?” Chamuel asked,
"What? I called you to help,"
"We were so close," Bailey groaned, Baal patted her on the back.
"I got the signal, go,"
"I don't see it," Cain snorted,
"I'm up," he grumbled, sitting up with a soft yawn. Running fingers through his hair before letting them fall to the back of his neck,
Cain looked around confused, they were asking him? Most people avoided him. Was this a trick, maybe?
"Not the first time," Mammon scoffed, rubbing his arm as the blood filled him back up with warmth.
"How?" Donnie whispered. There was a small pause before Abel spoke again,
"Alright," He said, turning to the others. "Only way to gank it is to burn the house down, but we gotta get to the actual house part."
"How do you use the grace in it?" Cain asked, tilting his head as he placed it back around his neck.
Chamuel chuckles, "Oh if that happens I'll be thanking my handful of super models,"
The library stood like a church, with high brick walls and a cross that smiled down on the two hunters as they made for the front door. Abel nodded to the cross, shooting Chamuel a lopsided grin, the angel was ready to roll his eyes before the other even began to speak,
"I think I'll let them take care of it," she nodded to the black eyed children who stood before the cross on the wall. They moved in unison to the man who started to squirm and scream as they collectively grabbed his legs.
"Wake up! Whats going on? You're just staring at it,"
"I...this is hard to admit," he started, "but Cham I…" He stopped, seeming to think deeply about asking the question as if he expected Chamuel to be opposed to it, "do you think I'd be less of a man if I had a kid?"
"Alright, I can do this," Chamuel whispered to himself as he made his way towards the catcher's box.
Marshall watched from his spot on his bed, eyes wide as he listened to the hunter. A picture of him and Iggy settled on the table beside the small twin mattress he laid on.
"Is this your dominant hand?" She asked,
"Abel's soul is in danger,"
He wore a sweater vest with slacks, carrying a backpack that was slung around his body. He looked like a teacher, ready for his first day! Abel wore his normal attire, band shirt with tight jeans.
"Help me!" Abel whispered to the white hare that leapt from the undergrowth. its nose twitched as Abel clawed his way towards it. The hands continued to grab his legs, waist, hips, trying to drown him. Drag him to the pits of hell. Abel reached towards the rabbit with all his might, grabbing the ground just inches from the animal's nose. Solid ground. He dragged himself forward until his body met the floor.
"I didn't call you for your sass," Bailey snorted.
"Come on!" He called to Abel,
Sam looked back to the sky, closing his eyes as he attempted to calm the swirling anxiety that moved through him. But the idea that Abel had somehow alerted every demon in every part of the world that he had this mysterious ‘Chamulet’ made the hunter feel sick.
“It’s such a small dose, it’ll help, all hunters use it. I was able to get my hands on it!” the excitement in the demon's voice sounded genuine.
"Now where are we going, doc?"
"How are you walking on Holy Ground, demon?" Buck snarled as Mammon stepped farther in and looked around, putting a hand on his hip. Onoskelis followed after him, she dragged Paul behind her. He was passed out, chained up and looked pretty beaten up.
His blue eyes, they shone in that pale light from his garage. They burned into his soul in a way he couldn't ever describe, for a heartbeat, it was as if it was just him and this stranger that would change everything about his life.
"I think supermodels need to be tall,"
"Sammy!!"
Abel slowly walked towards the man who shared his same eyes. The Adinkra in the other's grip was shaped like two long swords crossed together.
"Yes mother, I...think so," He whispered, looking down at his feet. Dread crept through him, he could still stop it if he needed. Suddenly he felt Cherm beside him again, the monster rolled through his veins clouding up the happiness he had felt the past week.
"Well, if Baal's with him I trust him," Danjal snorted. Though something about the man's voice told Ancitif that he knew more than he let on.
"I've...never played it," he admitted. The man never had much of a childhood, he either studied or hunted with his father. That is, beside the few sports he was forced to play to fit his mother's odd agenda she had for him.
The child had been killed very recently, blood still falling from his chest and rolling into the stone below him.
Chamuel and Israfil exchanged a look, "How? I'm just now getting used to my powers."
The man's voice was warm as the sun, holding onto a cane with shaken palms the old man got to his feet. Wrinkled face turned into a smile as he wobbled over to Ancitif.
They came to a few doors, Abel could smell the smoke getting stronger as he glanced at the Chamulet. It moved to the right door, the hunter kicked in the door without a second thought. A surprised scream hit his ears as he walked into a small, princess covered room. The bed held pretty pink sheets, a few pictures on the walls of a happy family, a shaggy pink rug with Princess characters under his feet.
Norma waved at them, grinning wide before making her way back to the kitchen.
"Nice hippie sold it to us," Baal replied, waving a hand in the air.
"I'm small and weak,"
"Maybe, I'm beat," Chamuels voice sounded more annoyed than he intended it too, causing the hunter to flinch as if struck.
"Here,"
"I don't trust him," Baal snorted, getting a deep feeling of dread passing through his chest.
Abel stood in front of the camera, holding his baseball bat. He had gone over what harms the sludge, what he knew of it, and how to fight it off. He showed how to hold the bat properly, mentioning the extra weight due to the sharp nails and spikes that jetted out from its wood.
"Alright, wait for me!" He shouted into the hole, leaping into the darkness.
"Stop howling!" Danjal yelled from where he dangled from the animal's jaws.
"I'm just teasing," she laughed, he smiled at her, she returned his smile with a flutter of her eyes.
"Yeah, usually I'd...be all over you by now," He chuckled, "But I can't seem to understand why I'm suddenly….not feeling it,"
"We need to rest," Chamuel yelled back, "find a way back. It's getting dark,"
He continued to slowly float towards the ceiling, the air in the bar whipped and roared as if it was ready to go to war.
"Water, I suppose?"
Sam felt as if he was going to a friend's sleepover with the way Norma talked to him, but she'd always been like that. It wasn't unusual, he couldn't figure out what Mick saw in her personality.
“You’re here early!” He laughed, putting a hand on Abel’s shoulder, “I usually see you at night”
Abel leaned against the other, wrapping his arms around the angel's arm. Chamuel rested his head on Abel's, his eyes dancing over the many faces of the crowd.
"So I was picked because of who my dad is, is what you're saying?" A small note of hurt in his ton, no one else seemed to notice but Chamuel sure did.
"What's it to ya?"
"You felt that, right?" He murmured to her, "I'm not crazy?"
Chamuel chuckled, "is she a singing superhero?"
Arphaxat sighed, rolling his eyes and glaring up at the other.
"Now just put the painting down, and put your hands up," she snarled
"Yeah, okay. Did you hear from Butch?" He pulled out a second shovel, closing the back of the car going into the backseat to snag his weapon of choice. His baseball bat he silently named "Broomstick".
"That's just like him, you know." Her voice was warm, "Well he had to go on a hunting trip, he won't be back for a month or two. He asked me to help you in the meantime,"
"Shit! Donnie!" Abel shouted, "Cain! Snap outta it!"
"Well? Are you going to make the wish?" Sam asked as the silence continued to drag through them. She giggled, and hadn't realized how close he was to her. Their foreheads nearly touched from the closeness.
“I wish I could just want something and levitate it to myself!” Abel laughed,
"Guys!"
"Actually he's not, he's an angel, the guy can't get possessed," Sam replied, arms crossed over his chest.
"How much longer?" Mammon growled, "I have a Robin who's wings need plucking,"
"Yeah, until your girlfriend came around,"
"Well, your dad...was a lot bigger than you," Sam chuckled, having nearly forgotten that Abel was short and not as built.
Abel stepped aside, was this about the painting? It couldn't be right? No one saw them take it. And it couldn't be about the dead man in Mishka's house, they probably would've used their real names.
"What did you do? What even if all this?" She asked, sitting back down and really taking the time to study the marks that covered the room before her eyes fell back to the mirrors that seemed to have been placed in a circle around them.
"Hey, route me back to Norms. I can't remember what road to take,"
Baal held her tighter, he felt the burning guilt drowning the warm emotions he felt for her. He'd tormented so many souls, what if he harmed her children's souls too? What if this was all his fault?
"Maybe I drugged you a little too much," Arphaxat mused as Abel's head fell back and he was out. The demon reached into the man's pocket, pulling the smartphone out. Chamuels name jumped up on the screen, the demon hit the green talk button and held it to his ear.
Pushing into the door, it opened with a small creaking. He slowly made past the angel's open door, glancing in to see the angel's figure curled under his blankets. Abel pulled the door shut, making past a few more doors before grabbing the handle of the staircase.
"Magic tricks? I thought they were superpowers,"
"Any good Pokemon over here?"
As if to answer his question Israfil pushed out of the kitchen, his eyes glowing with excitement. His cheeks streaked with dark oil, his hair a mess under his snapback, golden eyes bright as the sun.
"Maybe it's...from the sun," Cain didn't often see things he couldn't explain but a sudden tattoo just...appearing? The heart was red as the slayers shirt he wore under his white lab coat.
"Don't worry, Chamuel, trust me," hearing Abel say his full name put him more at ease, feeling a familiar trickle of warmth splash over his system. His name sounded like poetry coming from the other's throat.
"Obizuth wanted us to send her regards," He hissed into the other's ear. Robin squirmed harder against the man's grip, attempting to focus on the Adinkra and use its power but he felt far too afraid to do so. Shaking now as the man slammed a fist into his stomach, he groaned painfully as another fist landed on his cheek sending shots of pain skyrocketing through his skull.
Chamuel raced the charm against the wood, placing it against the carving with wide eyes. It fit in perfectly, slipping between the wood without any issue. The necklace started to glow softly against the guitar,
"What's got you so worked up? I know it's hard waking up to my ugly mug every day but you don't gotta cry about it," Abel teased
“What's the movie, Abe?” He breathed,
The two continued to chat with one another, leaving Butch in the motel room. His eyes dancing over the pictures on the screen in front of him, the necklace around Abel's neck had nearly caused his heart to stop. Faith Amulet, or as Abel had been calling it online, the Chamulet. Butch knew the rumors, he read the old text, saw the pictures on the great hidden church walls of the old world. He never assumed it was real, if he could have it, he knew his dreams could come true. He wasn't fully aware of its power, what happened when someone Faith didn't choose ended up having it, and he knew the other hunters of the world saw it as a sign of rejoin! They would protect the amulet holder with their lives, yet, why should they? Abel was chosen, but it didn't mean the amulet wouldn't work for him too.
"Oh like you respect me?" Chamuel retorted.
"I don't have much time," Fran whispered, "I can extract his soul from his vessel, it will be up to you to take his soul to one of Faith's alters."
"These creatures or whatever they are-- they're gonna spread and people will realize that this isn't fake."
“Well-- I think,” Sam said through gritted teeth, looking from Baal to Butch.
"Eventually,"
"Yuck, I can't do that. I'll throw up!" Donnie laughed, glancing at her from behind the glass over his eyes.
"Shut up,"
Dean ignored the angel, storming towards Chamuel's puddle. Without a second thought he shoved his hand into the water.
Chamuel shook his head, clicking on a comment to find the reason for the sudden messages. His heart sank, a large comment thread came up from an account that seemed to have been made recently yet it held thousands of followers. It tagged their twitter, instagram and facebook pages.
He paused, waiting to see if anyone had anything to say before continuing, "I didn't want that, I believe in the people, in us. So...I denounced God, the angels, everything. That means…"
Abel gave the other a small smile before turning his attention to the area around them. Another shiver rolled up his spine, he took a few steps back til he felt Cain.
"Can you two stop having sex in the middle of everyone?" Mishka snorted, Bailey looked up at Sam and back to her before taking a few steps away. Feeling shame flooded her body, She noticed Sam stiffen as well.
"Fat chance, that's not the deal," The pack leader hissed out, her tail swishing angrily from side to side. Her body looked as if it were halfway wolfed out, with tufts of fur sticking out of the brown skin on her face, one eye was a deep red while the other a soft brown as she glared down at the prophet.
Abel ignored the angel, reading through the pages with eyebrows furled.
"Just tell us!" Bailey replied
"Can you imagine? Someone touring down here for fun?"
"Mother please," he whispered, grabbing her arm lightly and pulling her towards the old couch.
He fell silent now, watching the gps but his mind was far away. Deep into the paperwork he had read through as a teenager, he didn't remember what his mother did personally but he did remember living in the hospital for a long time.
Taking a few steps towards them, shivering in the wind as he fiddled with the broken beads in his hand.
"Uh, well he's been avoiding me so--"
They'd slept another twenty four hours, it was early morning the day before Thanksgiving and Abel couldn't believe how long it had been. His phone filled with messages from, everyone! Mishka, Sam, Donnie, a few unknown numbers, Baal. He glanced down at Chamuel who slept beside him, a shiver rolled up his spine as he recalled the conversation he had with Arphaxat.
"My entire life it's...always been Dean, Dean's the best hunter, Dean saves the world," He pushed some of his hair from his face and tucked it behind his ear. She watched his eyes dull from years of trauma, she put a hand on his shoulder causing him to give her a light smile as he leaned into her touch.
Rolling off the bed and to her feet she guided him to the bed,
What were they doing?
Her soft blue eyes looked almost grey as she studied him.
"Alright, hey guys, we're out!" He said to the group.
Cain hesitated, half of him wanted the hunter to fall. It would take care of everything, and yet, a split second decision caused Cain to jump for the other. Grabbing him by the hand just in time, now Cain found himself about to fall over the ledge too. Groaning painfully as he fought to bring his brother up, Abel kicking at Butch in an attempt to get himself free. Watching as the horns slowly burrowed back into the other's head, his large, bear-like jaw slowly returning to its original state. The sound of crunch bone filled the air.
“Well yeah, to grow you gotta eat, right? Maybe those are babies?”
“Almost,” Baal growled, he took a few steps back, stomping down with a foot and dragging it back before taking off at the door again. Sam shut his eyes tight as the door exploded inward from the impact of the man's head. It was as if he rammed it down with a pair of unseen horns.
Danjal texting on his phone, beer in hand, leaning against the wall.
"I gotta punch in the code,"
"Issy?" He murmured, he could hear the angel sobbing. The man was sitting in the dark, clenching a pillow to his chest and crying into it. Curled up into a tight ball, Donnie whimpered softly as he made for the man. Settling himself beside the other on the pull out bed,
Chamuel felt his face turning red as he sat back down, "please tell me you didn't hear my prayer," he glared down at the ground, angry with himself.
The pair vanished into the darkness of the old thrift store. Stripping off the cold, old clothes and tossing them into a bin of other dirty clothes that needed to be washed. Israfil stood freezing in his boxers, taking a towel that his friend had found and attempting to dry himself to the best of his ability.
"Oh, I'm flattered but I don't date trans men. Just normal ones :-) "
"Just a little," He replied, trying to push the feeling of jealousy from creeping into his thoughts.
"Here we go," Donnie whispered,
“Something isn’t right here,” Abel shook his head as he spoke, racing his fingers through his hair as he attempted to piece together what they had just seen.
"The Grotto," She snorted, Danjal laughed at this causing her to laugh as well.
Israfil didn't hesitate, he hopped off the bed and snatched the smart phone off the end table. Turning the small, wireless charger off. He handed it over to the other who shakily took it, he smiled at Israfil before turning it on with his fingerprint.
"God is the only one keeping this place alive at this point," Morris mused, eyes down on the phone in his hand.
"What the--" Donnie scrambled back as he looked at the other with wide eyes.
"You think he's dead?" He choked out, "I'm such a coward, I should have gone back! But I don't have any powers like that, I'm just a low level scum of hell!" He wailed.
"What? What does that even mean? I mean, I know what denounced means but what does it mean to denounce god?"
"What happened? You're scarin' me!" Abel slid off the chair so he could speak more properly to the cops. The two officers seemed to hesitate,
"Of course," She whispered, "My bad,"
"We gotta find him," Chamuel sobbed out, "I'm so stupid!"
"Are...you flirting with me?" She laughed, putting her hand on her chest. Sam chuckled as well, even dead, Dean would always be the same.
“What!?”
Chamuel wrote, "Sorry again,"
"Fight?" Abel murmured, the ground under him swaying. He let out a scream of surprise as hands exploded from the black dirt below.
Abel punched his friends arm lightly, handing him back his phone with a sigh.
Israfil talked himself up for a few extra seconds, making his way forward in the crowds. He felt alone among the large collection of the innocent, his white guitar stood out among the rest of those around him. The angel hunted for the wolf for hours, making his way past neon lights, small neighborhoods, and shops until he came to a dirtier part of the city. Stopping by a pawn shop, tears welding in his eyes.
"On your right," Baal said into the headphones.
"What's the other thing?"
"Cham," He whispered, but the words that raced through his head moved too quickly to come out of his mouth so he just stared slack jawed at the image before them. The soft, yellow light that glowed above it like a halo gave the picture an even more ominous feeling.
Abel listened to the other, tilting his head, Chamuel felt warmth spread through his veins as he looked at the other.
"You just push it! Did you try to pull?" He asked, Chamuel blinked at him for a few seconds.
"Dammit," She hissed, she was so stressed she felt her body fighting back. The floor squeaked under her shoes as she made for the television, rolling a hand over the wall till it shuttered and slowly opened.
"You're acting like I just proposed to the guy," Donnie snorted quietly,
"I see it," Bodhi whispered, wincing as the music rolled over the group.
"I've been hunting since I was a kid, I'm not just knowledgeable on the hunting community, though, I don't have a gun." He said with a shrug.
“Hey Abe,” Chamuel said as they followed behind the other car, Abel looked over to his friend. A smile on his lips, “Yeah?”
Israfil smiled but didn't reply as he attempted to find out how to gank the creature if need be.
"Run!" Abel shouted, they pelted down the hallway only to come to a dead end. The stairs blocked completely, they looked around frantically until Abel spotted it. The mirror.
"I was able to manifest something," He whispered to her, her eyes grew wider.
"Abel, that's Ancitif, no doubt Obizuth is close behind,"
"...love? Aint that shit supposed to feel good?"
Israfil sniffled softly, Donnie watched him with a curious glint in his eyes. He silently celebrated, Faith wasn't in the picture! But he couldn't just scoop the angel up and force him to be his. He was still an angel,
"Maybe, depends on what Dutch wants,"
"It means," Chamuel cleared his throat, attempting to keep his anxiety out of his voice.
"I-its okay," he murmured, wrapping his arms carefully around her. He was shocked at the level of trust she was showing him, after all, she hated him not long ago. He let his fingers run through her hair like he'd seen Chamuel do for Abel, he didn't know much about comforting but he wanted to learn.
"Dean?" Sam whispered, at first he turned his body to where the voice came from but he was alone. An idea sparked in his mind, he held the mirror up so he could see behind him in it's reflection. Moving the mirror slowly only to freeze in his tracks. Behind him, in the mirror, was Dean.
The werewolves raced around one another in excitement as the buzz of the rodeo flowed under their fur. They stood in a clump, all looking up towards a giant red barn with their leader standing on top. Her dark eyes darted from one wolf to the next, she hadn't felt such anger in her life. Something happened to her, the past few days it was as if this deep seeded hate was settled over the large ranch, infecting every wolf within its walls. The animals all seemed to feel the same, though she noticed a few vomiting out black sludge. It didn't bother her for some reason. She couldn't place her finger on it, but the power she felt under her skin was too great to ignore.
"Terrible…" he whispered, "Did I really kill my mother?"
"You know what I mean," Chamuel whispered, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly.
“Trust me, there’s something happening and I don’t want anyone else to have this,” the angel stepped away from Chamuel, “Promise me you’ll keep it safe,”
“And now he’s here, wanting to start up another practice, right? Chamuel?”
"Come on Danjal, you called me here," he huffed
"Abel! Get out of here," Chamuel shouted, the music on Abel's phone kicked into Chamuel's earpiece now. It was his favorite song, on repeat. This turned his chest to a hot lava that burned hotter than the fires surrounding him
"Come on, Romeo! Please! I'm on my knees! Do you want me to pray?" She pointed to the sky dramatically, causing Robin to stumble towards her in embarrassment as she shouted, "Please Mr. Born Again! Save my farm!"
"And a present or two," Israfil added,
"I can't save anyone," he whispered
"Boom!" Robin shouted, pushing his feet to the other behind him. The explosion caused the large man to yelp out in agony, shooting the archer forward towards another large built demon. Her eyes flooded with shock as Robin smashed into her at full force, the pair slammed into the wall. Knocking the wind out of her as she fell to the floor. Robin turned quickly, panting as he didnt so. Now it was just him and Mammon, the man looked horrified for a heart beat before getting into position.
"You were supposed to leave," she shouted back as they got to their feet. His jacket was dirty, blood rolled down his nose. He felt pain flashing through his system as they stood in front of the man. The blood from the ribbons stained his hands.
Iggy leapt into a computer chair, leaning back as it spun in a circle.
Cain was able to scramble away from Butch, grabbing Chamuel's leg as he attempted to breath despite the pain in his throat. Chamuel went down to the doctor, checking the man's wounds.
"You tell us which one of you two is king, we kill you and everyone lives,"
"You're the shit head who keeps taking all these videos?" She demanded, "Take them down!"
"There's a lot humans don't know, or, remember," Israfil said with a shake of his head.
He dug his hands into the dry dirt and pulled upwards, darkness swarmed like ants from the ground below. Being hoisted up in a mass, bubbling up from the floor and rolling over the others hands. Pulling harder and harder until he was at his feet, he yanked once more and clasped his hands together. The sludge rose to Cherm's height, pulsating, waiting. With a sharp suck of air he ripped his hands away from one another, sending the darkness like a wave over the farm. The cries of animals could be heard as the blackness vanished into the shadows. The spot where Cherm had yanked the black sludge from now was a large crater in the floor, the dirt darker than the night sky.
"What the fuck!" Abel shouted out as they started to slide down into the darkness as if they entered into a haunted house.
"What are you--?" Robin started but Bailey refused to take no for an answer.
"Time?"
“He says he’s meeting us here in thirty,”
"It's free," The man pushed, Cain let out a sigh as he felt his phone buzz. Glancing down at the text from Mishka, he could sense she was irritated with him.
"Up," Abel shouted to Booker, they pelted for the staircase. Climbing upwards, the sound of the dogs could be heard barking madly behind them. Ancitif curled on the ground, Abel swore he heard the demon sobbing as they pelted onwards.
“Yeah but I gotta find Sam, I don’t care about this guy's spooky ghost encounter. It's probably bullshit anyways,”
"Games?" Danjal puzzled with a hint of curiosity touching his tone. Fran nodded to a few carnival games not far from them, Danjal followed the man's gaze. His mind worked hard to understand what this odd deity meant. Only a few games scattered beside the food trucks, a water shooting game with multiple targets, throwing rings on bottles, even an archery game that reminded Danjal of his friend. He turned his attention back to Fran but the man had vanished into the air, his cologne still lingered as the demon made his way towards the booths of games.
"You don't get to decide who goes to hell," Baal hissed, placing Hani carefully on the floor beside the pews. The man grabbed at the wooden benches, attempting to keep himself semi on his feet.
"Think anyone will notice?"
"I'm Level twenty now, you'd assume my Pokemon would be stronger,"
"Wanna make this place bright?"
"Let 'em go, Cham, we got some questions," Baal said, placing his hand on the angel's shoulder. Cham growled, dropping Butch to the dirty floor below causing the man to laugh again as Cain pulled Abel away from the toilet.
"Does he look like a cop?" Buster asked, Fritz shivered with excitement.
"I was scum of hell," he whispered, not looking at her, "and when I came to Earth a lot of demons wanted to remind me that even here I'm worthless,"
"No no," Abel whispered, feeling the pain falling away from his skin. Draining out of him slowly, "it...was just a...stomach ache…" he whispered. Okay, I probably deserved that. Abel thought to himself as Cham rubbed his back lightly.
"I don't know," she admitted, "but maybe my uncle will," Shrugging at them as she closed the book, "if you want I can give you his phone number. I'll even let him know you're gonna call,"
"We're doing this the old fashion way, consider this a lesson from one of the best hunters to ever live,"
Obizuth snarled, "I am important, war." He shook his head, "if something happens to Abel ill--"
"Shit!" Abel shouted, taking off after the rabbit. It's feet pounded loudly against the pavement, racing down the sidewalk past groups of people who gasped at the hare.
"Israfil told us about your argument, and you both haven't been sleepin' in the same room. So there's gotta be more than that," Baal inquired.
"He's evil, why would I--" Bailey had started, causing Mishka to practically growl at her.
"Look at me, I'm Sam Winchester I can afford to pay for a limo," Bailey teased
Chamuel opened his mouth to speak but froze in his place, a howl. It was short, distorted. Both men turned to look at one another, Abel slowly stood up, Chamuel followed close behind the duo staring into the woods.
"Morris says that he's surprised Chamuel doesn't like transgender men and Chamuel says here 'No offense but you'll never be a real man' how fucked up is that?" Abel nodded numbly, something in him screamed that this didn't sound right. Even the way Morris typed seemed different, but he was far too angry and hurt at the angel to listen to that part of his brain.
"Unfortunately," He replied, looking around anxiously every few minutes as if he was expecting to see someone he didn't want to see. "I don't know much, I already told everything I could."
"I...haven't really felt like anything is worth living," he felt cynical as he spoke but it was all coming out now, "since I've been here not only do people just...hurt each other for no reason but they hurt everything, nothing in this place is beautiful. When I was in heaven everything was so beautiful, vibrant, but here? Everything feels so dull and grey,"
"Yes ma'am, I'm a demon," Baal finally grunted out, "But I don't got time for this. I gotta get my friend here some help,"
"Oh! One last thing," she pulled her sunglasses off her head and placed them on Robin's whose smile grew wider.
“Yeah, don’t wanna see anyone I know,”
"Cain!"
Baal dumped the strong smelling liquid over the porch of the home, Chamuel watched him through war's gaze. He felt smaller now in his skin as the grace kicked him back whenever it felt the need, he needed to be more assertive.
Arphaxat glared daggers at the two from we're he sat by the bed. His body hidden from view as he sipped his tea, Abel could hear the sound of the sipping. The irritating noise Arphaxat always made whenever he drank anything,
'get away' instinct told him, his eyes turned to the large buildings around him. That was until something slammed into him at full force, he yelped in pain as his body collided into the side of a shop. Glass shattered around his massive frame, scattering to the floor below. Anger pumped through his veins, clawing himself back to his four feet he showed his teeth to his assailant. A large man stood before him, his eyes dark. His hands at the ready, another man stood behind him. A bow and arrow set was wrapped around the small scrawny male.
The police radio fizzled and popped from time to time, Abel dozed on the front seat as Chamuel laid in the back. Typing into his phone every so often, Sam also dozed as he leaned on the steering wheel. The police chatter was nothing of interest as the hour ticked by,
"It's...when you only love someone when you have a strong connection to them. And for some pe-- creatures, its especially intense,"
"We get it, you're gay!" Bailey shouted, leaning against Sam who was handing Baal the ugliest sweater he could possibly find. The demons eyes shone,
"Oh no!" Bailey spat, shooting a glare at the demon, "I am not being paired up with a demon king,"
"I think they'll love you," Donnie breathed out, at least, he hoped! His father wasn't an easy man to get along with but he prayed that the older hunter would find Israfil as intoxicating as him.
'fuck off, we're done. And my name's not Ancitif. My name's Robin.'
Chamuel tried harder, attempting to force his power forward. His stomach roared in hunger, his eyes were brimmed with exhaustion yet he continued to dig for the energy he needed. Holding out his hand, eyes glowing bright.
Israfil was never a leader, though he liked to think he did a good job at keeping himself hidden for a couple hundred years he couldn't keep the aching loneliness from burning into his chest. Since he'd joined the team, though his powers dwindled, he felt very at home with everyone.
Israfil sang out gleefully, "pizza pizza we love pizza,"
“Abel” He started only for a booming voice to yell over the loudspeakers around them,
Coming to a sudden stop he held the camera up to the memorial, his voice squeaking lightly as he spoke, “This is Mrs. Jackie, she’s the latest one! The most recent victim, and when I get proof its paranormal, I’ll avenge her and everyone else,”
Chamuel shrugged, picking up their coffee's the two left the shop behind them.
"Shut up," she snorted, pulling the tank's lid off  and dropping the greens in front of the lizard.
"Salt…...lovers," Abel snorted, getting up and going to the fridge.
“So, what now?” Cham asked,
"Glow sticks," he chuckled, "those tears better be good ones,"
"Fuck fuck fuck," she kept repeating over and over to herself. Chamuel looked horrified out the window, tears continued to run down his face.
"You're freaking out, it's fine. If...I met…" Sam held his hand up looking for an answer, he'd already met God, "Uh...Marilyn Monroe," He grumbled out, "I'd be nervous too."
He groaned, maybe this was a mistake. The Adinkra was probably just hitching a ride on him till it met some giant, buff, football player. The demon fiddled with the necklace absentmindedly. Wondering if Alan was feeling safe in the motel room he got for the next few days, it was snowing lightly and the lizard wouldn't want to be out and about in the cold. Even if Robin was warmer than your average human it wasn't always enough. He also felt strange carrying his weapon around with him, after all, he wasn't going to be fighting anyone right now. Having left the bow and arrows beside the bed in the motel room.
"Abel,"
“How can you tell?”
He heard Abel curse under his breath before a triumph "got it," came from where he was in the dark room.
"Bedtime?" Chamuel asked, taking the others hand in his own. Abel nodded as the Angel slid off the roof and pulled the hunter with him, Abel collided into the other's chest. Laughing as they floated to the floor, Chamuel kissed the others forehead a few times as they hit the ground. The warmth that burned into the hunter distracted him from the long fall to the floor, knowing Chamuel would never let him fall.
“Yeah, nothing! Nada! Zip!” Donnie leaned back in his chair,
"He'd never just leave," Baal instead from where he stood, Donnie was settled beside Israfil with his phone out.
Turning back towards the forest the only light came from a broken street light that flickers every few breaths. It was seated just before the entrance of the forest, the brambles seemed to circle the entrance like an opened door beckoning him in.
"What about the bar?" He whispered,
Abel didn't have enough time to react, the woman leapt at him. He gasped, pain hot as fire shot through him as she swung a large kitchen knife, blood rolled down his arm. She swung again, Abel backed up.
"Where's Abel?" She demanded, feeling fear rush through her blood.
"Dean Winchester's missing,"
Robin glanced at the other now, feeling a spark of surprise flash into him. Danjal often waved off his depression or anxiety with a Hardy laugh and telling him to try pushing past it. But looking at the demon now, he could see Danjal's mind was deeply troubled.
"He's nothing like Dean, he's weak. He's not even half the man--"
Danjal had stopped typing all together, was it dumb to ask the man for help? He wasn't part of this, after all so why should he come? Though Danjal seemed to show a softer side towards Robin he couldn't imagine it would mean he'd come up here in the blink of an eye.
The picture changed to a large church with great stained glass walls and a cross settled in the middle. Though it was mostly shapes Donnie silently was astonished by the level of detail that it showed, he knew Israfil made every shape in his mind and translated it using his grace but the others vivid imagination always surprised the wolf.
"It's locked in a vault," Bailey said, "Something about...needing the key,"
He darted from his spot without a second thought, diving past the snake just as it struck. Using his bat to block the creature only a few inches from the woman's face, clamping it's opened jaw around the head of the bat causing it to rear back, screeching in agony
"Wait!" Mavis and Morris followed after them,
"Well," Sam shook his head, running his fingers through his hair a few times and glancing up at the school that wasn't too far off.
Chamuel smirked, "you're a king to me," he added but Abel had already fallen into the darkness of sleep. Chamuel let out a breath, the LionHeart let his own eyes fall closed against the soft twinkling lights above.
Donnie and Abel shared a concerned look before Danjal cleared his throat loudly.
"Has Amaryllis been good today, mom?" He whispered into her hair, his mother nodded softly.
Israfil looked around them but felt hopeless, who knows where the water had taken them. He looked down at the concrete below before glancing back up, "how did we not drown?"
"Faith's Adinkra, take it. You win this war," Bodhi stood up, turning to Rooster. His eyes returned to their normal hue.
"Do you even know who I am?" Cain whispered, a wind under his body started to kick up. Danjal didn't reply to him, he didn't want to know as he slammed his foot into the Earth sending a shock wave of rock at the doctor. Cain scoffed, leaping to the side. Danjal's muscles tensed as he shot forward, using the ground under him to catapult himself towards the other. Using his weight to slam into the doctor at full force, his shoulder met the other's chest but shock flooded over him. Cain had his hands out and caught the other, digging clawed feet into the dirt to prevent the man from moving him.
"No sir, I'm just making sure they are who they say they are,"
"Hang on, I just thought of something, stay here," he said, pulling out his phone and calling Bailey back. He brushed his fingers against the red cushions of the couch as Cain sat himself down on the sofa. Typing away into his phone beside Sam,
"Alright, I'll try to get back to the truck," she yelled back, zooming back towards the car the sound of more siren's exploded behind them as a few more cop cars took chase after the two.
"Yep! Have fun!" Sam added a little too quickly, Mishka noted the pushing tone in the others voice. What was happening and why was Baal not being told?
"Hey! Well...not really? Sorry, I just woke up. I think Abel and Cham are still asleep,"
"Once you've had some sleep you'll start to be able to control everything more," Robin said to Donnie as he patched up the man's bullet wounds. Though the bullets hardly dug into the skin it left a large mark on his flesh. Israfil sat on the floor in front of his friend, watching the demon nervously. They had collectively come back to the motel room to patch up and sleep. Israfil couldn't remember the last time he felt this tired, Donnie was fiddling with one of the archers arrows. His eyes moved over the arrow, rolling his fingers on every part of it.
"She's just gonna be jealous I got an angel kissing on me!"
Robin took in a breath, his wings fluttered softly as he rose in the air. A few black feathers fell to the floor under him, was he losing feathers? He ignored this worry, sucking in air he felt the energy from the Adinkra, the power of the grace that flowed inside his veins.
