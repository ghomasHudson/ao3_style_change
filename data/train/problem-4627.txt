Wow, that thought really came out all wrong. Dean grimaces as he tries to re-word his own internal monologue to somehow undo his own narrative about the state of affairs.
Mentally, he argues back that he is bisexual, but he is too chickenshit to say that outloud so he just rolls his eyes in exasperation and stands to gather his phone and jacket. “Welp it's been real, Charlie. But I have to get to back to my life and stuff.”
“She has been taken down to dialysis. She asked me to stay up here this time. She doesn’t want to freak out and then I’ll freak out and we both will be a mess. She thought it might be better to let any nerves get settled on her own.” Cas stirs the soil in the pot with his fingertip as he speaks, as if he is introducing himself to the little growing thing.
Rushing into his front door, Dean pauses at the threshold to scent the air. Just the smell of home as usual. The house looks just exactly as he left it. His laundry is finished and neatly put away. That is the only sign that anyone had been there at all. A rush of disappointment floods Dean. It was a terrible idea to clean so much. He can hardly see her touch on his home. Maybe it had really been an accident and his Omega isn’t really his at all. Horniness makes us all weirdos and maybe she had really regretted her mistake. Of course. He was letting his hormones get carried away. His silly fantasy was mostly because of his loneliness. He should stop embarrassing himself. He blinks hard to clear the haziness of tears from his eyes. This wasn't a rejection damnit. It was his own foolishness. It doesn't stop the burning in his chest or the feeling of loss. But bourbon does. So Dean spends his evening drowning the part of himself that had cobbled together a dream.
That thought has him raising the panties up to his nose before he actually considers carefully what he should do. There is an instant spike of pain along his jaw as his mouth fills with saliva. His mouth is watering so hard. That scent of apple pie is dominant but twined around his own scent and he was not at all prepared for the hard slam of feral need to knock him on his ass. He is sliding down onto the floor and whining with frustration as he scrabbles at his jeans to free himself from the painful bite of the inseam into his engorging knot. Dean's powerful jaws snap and clench the soiled underwear between his teeth and the rush of saliva wakes the full flavor of sex in the fabric. He sucks and groans and swallows the tangy cinnamon apple slick down while a trembling bass roar of satisfaction builds deep in his chest. His mate had left him a teasing gift. His mate had claimed some territory and took clothes to soak in scent. His hindbrain doesn’t care if it was intentional or not. The precious invitation had been more than adequate. It was goddamn perfect. Dean was in the very first blush of his prime and this was the scent of mate and home. Intentional or not, this Omega has his full attention.
“Why not? Dean, you have wanted this since we were little kids. Now we know for sure that you have a soul mate running around out there somewhere. That's awesome and you deserve a shot at finding them. And besides, I could just listen to the youtube tape and figure it out. It's really hard to hear but I bet I could isolate it. So you might as well tell me.”
Cas flexes his thighs to lift his weight and Dean almost whines at the loss. The Omega laughs softly and rubs his hand through Dean's hair. “Don't worry Alpha, I'm not going anywhere.” kneeling up, Cas crawls up to the center of Dean's chest, his cock brushing the Alpha's chin before he settles heavy and slow there. His weight drops in degrees and Dean moans. His breath is being mashed away beneath the crushing weight. The trapped hot scent of apples and cinnamon is so strong that Dean's jaw aches and his mouth fills with saliva. His mouth is watering. And Cas is so close. So crowded up into Dean's face that he blocks out the entire world. His cock stands just inches from Dean's nose and mouth and that weight is pushing, pushing, mashing him down into the mattress. Dean grips the sheets so tightly that the corner pops from the mattress. This is everything he didn't know he wanted. He has no idea how Cas knew or guessed because he never would have. So he tips his head forward, his eyes rolling up to ask and opens his mouth.
Dean tosses his keys into the metal bowl on the kitchen counter and toes his boots off. The exhaustion of the entire day weighs heavy on his shoulders and back. It's been a long ass day and the anticipation of a hot shower, some food, and the evening spent on the couch has him already sighing in relief. That and the fresh sparkling clean room.
Castiel is so fucked. His mom is going to be so fired. For one, she brought her son with her to work which was totally against the rules. That son has just scent marked the entire bathroom with Omega horniness. Third. These panties now smell like the both of them. Fuck. There were strict instructions left for cleaning the Alphas home. He didn't like strong cleaning odors and must have a sensitive nose. So the mild cleaning agents allowed in this room wasn't going to cut it. Not even close. What the fuck was he going to do? He did the only thing he could. He scrubbed the room with what he had on hand. He couldn't put the soiled panties back in the drawer and risk scent marking every piece of clothing in there. He had to lay them on the counter to dry and hope that his apology note was enough to somehow salvage the situation. It was all he could do.
They both break into soft breathless snickers and Dean covers his face with his palm. He hasn’t ever felt this vulnerable and exposed to another person in his entire life. It just feels that way. He has been much more vulnerable and open with women. But he feels it so much more here. Omega or not, Castiel is a man and Dean has never really let his guard down with men in this way.
So when Dean looked for sigils and chants and spells and tricks to make the universe help him get Castiel back. There weren't any. Because that isn’t how any of this works. The universe bends around an angel, not the other way around.
“Sorry! Shit. Sorry!” Castiel grimaces and calms his limbs for Gabriel to continue draping the LED lights over and around the extended span of his wings.
Dean’s third and fourth orgasm are inspired by Cas’ teeth against his nipple and his fingers stroking his throat respectively. The messy panties get tossed to the floor and Castiel forbids Dean from washing them until he gets to enjoy them at least once more. For old times sake of course.
Dean stands up abruptly, completely forgetting his drink and bouncing the tiny table until his coffee flies right off the edge and explodes. “Goddamnit!” Dean exclaims and then immediately needs to search for the music again. He looks for a speaker, as if that is going to magically make it louder or somehow manifest some reason for his soulsong to be playing right this moment. The barista that was going to help him clean up the mess is now looking at him like he has sprouted extra limbs. Maybe because his face is wet now. Is he crying? Fuck. He is crying. In public. He takes a few deep breaths and tries to remind himself not to freak out any more. Ok. Is his soulmate here? Most of the time, the music means that person is near. He is trying to slow himself down, searching every face. The barista? “Its my soulsong.” He explains in a shaking voice. “I haven’t heard it before. Just now.” He looks at the delicate redhead and knows. It's not her. Although, now she is beaming at him with complete understanding and bustling around him to sop up the mess with a towel. That music keeps pulling at his chest and driving every single molecule of his body to alert attention and this ache. It hurts. He needs to find them. But after looking into each face in the room, it’s only an echoing blow of loss. Somebody has their phone out filming him. He is bawling in the middle of a coffee shop and that is probably worth some clicks to somebody. Goddamnit. Why couldn’t he just have his soul song when he was 15 at some stupid pep rally or school dance? Why couldn’t he have it at some club when he was 25 and drunk off his ass? But NO. Dean Winchester has to hear his soul song for the very first time when he is 35 years old at 9:30 in the goddamn morning. If there is a God, that bastard is probably laughing his beard off.  It is hugely unfair to host a feelings party when the sun is this bright and there isn’t any whisky around.
Dean's eyebrows are raised and he thinks over what Cas just said. “Wow, never really thought of it like that. You really have laid it all out. You are damn right of course. You remind me of Sammy. My brother. He is like that. Just smart as fuck and knows the answers about stuff other people don't even think about. You two are gonna get along.” Dean's eyes soften fondly for a few moments. “Okay now I gotta stop thinking about my little brother.” Dean makes a horrified face that makes Cas chuckle. “Let's go back to that porn habit. You are gonna have to tell me all about that.” Cas laughs against his mouth and rubs his fingertips up Dean’s back. “Mmm. Kiss me Alpha.”
Castiel hadn't given his vessel permission to reroute all the blood to his face but apparently his vessel was not taking orders right now. His face flames and his chest squirms with discomfort. The feeling is so shocking that he makes some desperate sound and Gabriel stops in his tracks.
Dean is quiet for a long moment. The shy Omega that was sheltered and shared his first kiss and wanted to get away from his family. That was the Omega Dean had met. This Castiel was famous and bold and so damn smart. He would win. Dean could tell. It was the right thing. Anyone listening to Castiel speak like this would have to admit that he deserves to be emancipated. He could go anywhere and be with anyone. Why would he give any of that up to be stuck in his hometown with a grease monkey? Castiel could travel the world, work any job and date anyone. “Cas, you can be with anyone. You are famous and a lot of people really admire you. You shouldn't get stuck with me.”
Cas grinds down on his lap, finding the hard edge of his cock and mashing it almost to the point of pain. Dean groans. “I could prove I'm real, Dean. I could slap you right across the face and show you. You know, just so that we can be sure this isn't a dream. For science.” there is a dangerous bright gleam in Castiel’s eyes.
Apparently he can’t out-confidence an angel of the fucking lord, because Castiel simply squares his jaw and locks eyes with him. “You only had to ask, Dean.”
And of course Castiel is sitting on the bed. Looking like he can quite comfortably sit exactly like that until the mountains erode and the sun explodes. Dean rests his forehead against the doorframe for a long second, trying not to shout in frustration.
“Dean.” Castiel repeats and his tone is so deep that the hunter can feel the hairs rising at the nape of his neck. He can practically feel the angel’s eyes studying his skin.
Dean whimpers and decides then and there to not touch himself. He won’t last two seconds and he doesn’t want to miss even a single twitch that Castiel makes. The Alpha’s desperate noise seems to have goaded Cas into action and so he twists one arm back and arches even further, pulling his asscheeks wider, making that tight center stretch and leak. Dean is panting, sucking in the ripe taste of Omega in the air. So good. So fucking good. Cas slides his fingers down his thigh, dragging through the slick shiny fluid. “Look Alpha, see this. I am a mess. I keep making this mess. I don’t think I can stop it. Is it ok Alpha? Do you like this mess?”
"Just try not to project your mood all the way across the damn solar system, will ya? I thought you were getting murdered or something. I know your mood is gonna make your vessel react and that is gonna make your mood feel stronger. Which will then freak you out and then your vessel will freak out and then. Well. You get the picture. It's like a big amplifier you just wired yourself into. Rather clever vessels these are. They walk around with their bodies just humming all the time. You'll get used to it. Try porn. It will blow your wings off." He smirks lasciviously and nudges the still stunned Castiel.
Dean feels Cas nod against his back. “Yeah. That’s a good idea.” He says softly. The arm doesn’t loosen even an inch.
He had insisted that he wasn't interested in mating or being paired off. Mostly because he knew the ridiculous people his family would try to stick him with. Wealthy powerful Alphas that would swaddle him all the way to the grave probably. He had insisted that his studies were the focus of his interest. And they really were. Mostly. Finding those goddamn sexy panties had wrecked everything. Going into a strange Alphas bedroom and sniffing his underwear while orgasming wildly is hardly the actions of a completely asexual and innocent studious Omega. Nope. His family is going to think this means he is sex starved and needs a mate to settle him down. He isn't sex starved! Mostly. He is twenty. That means of course he is sort of sex starved. Ugh. His web browser might have some AonA porn on it. Ok. Ok. He might be a little bit less than innocent. But seriously. Mr. Winchester was an unfair challenge. A blue collar Alpha with such delicate features and that big Alpha body. And he wore panties. Soft pretty pink ones. Castiel knows enough about the taboos of sex. Alphas are supposed to want one thing. To dominate a submissive mate with a slick hole. There is a lot of porn to suggest that the narrative doesn't exactly fit everyone. And Dean wears pretty femme things in secret. Does it mean he might not mind being pretty for his mate? He might not mind being soft and giving? Maybe he likes being told that he looks beautiful? He is every inch a hardworking man with callouses and beer and flannels. Castiel is every inch the soft Omega. Long delicate manicured hands and such a sheltered pampered life.
The state of affairs is a fucking wreck. As usual. Dean was managing ok. Sorta. Castiel didn’t seem to have the same problem. Fucking unfair, really. In all that time together, Dean hadn’t really ever gotten a look at Cas without HIS shirt. The rumpled drape of that trenchcoat and the tight lines of the suit beneath were practically attached to his skin for all Dean knew.
Castiel traces the lines of his name on Dean’s skin. He steps closer until the hunter can feel a nimbus of warmth radiating against his bare skin. Almost touching. Until his breath pours over one shoulder blade and Dean shivers at the sensation. Castiel flattens his palm against the middle of Dean’s spine and the quiet intimacy of the moment strikes some hidden need inside the hunter. Some long buried ache that he had shrugged off and postponed and kicked down the road for way too long now. He had wanted to be touched like a precious thing.
To those who are in thrall to the song, and those who can see souls, the vibration of the march of notes unfolds his soul from the center of his chest. The bright center of his being swells and blooms wider until he is surrounded by a halo of light. Like a bulb that has been flicked on. If his soulmate is here, they cannot miss it. The soft glowing aura grows strong until Dean himself can even see it flickering out from his skin. He has never seen a soul before because no song has ever triggered the response. Only one song ever could. He has seen pale impressions before in art and movies of course. It looks way cooler in person. Fuck. He has to stop marvelling at his own goddamn soul and look around. Look for anyone else glowing. He tries to calm his racing heart and find them. But everyone in the crowd is shining white. Reflecting. Not glowing. The stage is shining so bright there is no way he could see anyway. Annoyed, Dean turns his eyes to the stage and whimpers helplessly. There is a shining enormous being on the stage. It's so huge that it is taking up more than this building. At the same time, it is small too. Human sized. It makes no sense. His mind tries to make both things true at once and it hurts a little. It helps to focus on the wings. The great shining black sweep of them. They hold galaxies within but he knows it is easier to contemplate that and try to not look at the face of the DJ. He fails spectacularly. The perfect line of his jaw and throat draws him inevitably in. He can't. Not. Look. Angel shines. His flawless skin pulses with blue light and his eyes burn blue lightning behind his lids. His soulmate. Impossibly. Is right here with him. In the same room. All night he has struggled with his emotional response to the beautiful man. He held back. There isn't any reason to hold back any more.
"Remember when I found that liquor store? I drank all of it. Gabriel. You know how hard it has been. It's gotten so much worse. I can't keep siphoning your grace. I can't stop the constant bleed of it. It hurts Gabriel. I am-I was. I was losing myself. Forgetting myself. I tried so hard to hang on. I listened to every single possible scrap of advice from you. I tried to live the chaos. Tried to be assured and without fear and holding joy in the turn of fate. I am not you Gabriel. I was losing myself. So I thought. I thought I would write myself down. In a song. Write down the song of me. Just to remind myself. To keep myself grounded. The humans wouldn't know what it was. It was rough. I only used human means. I didn't want to hurt them. I kept it simple. I tried playing it alone and it barely worked. I could feel the anchor right there. Just couldn't hold on to it. So I performed it live. At a gig. It didn't hurt anyone. They loved it! My producer wanted to release it as a single. It gave me a sticking point for weeks at a time. Some solid point in time. In memory. Of myself. A tangible memory that didn't slide away.
"Your head is tilted and your eyebrows are all scrunched up. It's the most confused look I have ever seen on an angel. It's making me nervous."
It's so beautiful that Cas forgets to be embarrassed for a minute to take up his staring. The timid quiet scent of comfort that had been softly building in him flowers suddenly into fuller life and the rich bloom of vanilla fills the space between them. Happy Omega.
The serious news magazine has Castiel on the front cover in a dark blue suit. His arms are crossed and his face looks like he is going to righteously smite somebody. It's certainly not the face of a sweet innocent shy pretty Omega. That face is dominant and taking no prisoners. Its signature Castiel. The Omega who is single handedly taking on the entire political machine that is arrayed against him. He won't be owned. He will win his autonomy. He has taken it all the way to the supreme court.
"We have to figure this out Gabriel. He is bonding. The link is profound. His reaction is the same as an angel so far. He cannot leave me yet. We are stuck together. He uh. He prayed to me." Castiel can feel his body reacting again with embarrassment. This time he manages to stop his face from flaring bright pink, but it's a close thing.
The Alpha growls within. He needs to get at that. They are both still completely clothed which is a fucking mind blowing fact and Castiel laughs when Dean begins to scramble at his clothes and growls impatiently. Cas rolls off of Dean's chest and the grey teeshirt sports a wide dark soaked wet patch. The scent blooms even hotter and Dean begins to yank his own clothes off as fast as he can. He uses the soaked teeshirt to wipe the mess from his face and manages to get most of it while adding some of the spiced apple slick to his skin. His own leather and sandalwood scent rises faintly as he shucks his pants and watches Cas stripping just as eagerly. When his Omega's underwear sticks...sticks! And clings and pulls away wetly from his thighs, Dean can’t hold back anymore. He slams into Cas with his entire body. His instinctive nature taking over as he ruts his cock against the Omega's hip. His fingers curve around the soft underside of Castiel's ass and his fingertips brush and dip into the well of slick heat. Cas keens and shivers hard. His bright eyes look back at Dean and he crawls onto the bed. The Alpha wont let his mate move out of his reach and he follows so closely that his fingers are still intimately tucked into the hot mess when Cas settles onto his hands and knees. Dean tightens his fingers and the plush wet flesh spreads open to expose the flushed pucker of his hole. The Alpha remembers this sight. So fucking beautiful. He can remember just how Castiel had touched himself. Rubbing two fingers to either side of his twitching hole to make it spill wet. So Dean does it. He rubs two blunt hard calloused thumbs deeper into the slickness until they are soaked up and slick. Then the rubs his thumbs up and down either side of that hungry wet hole. Cas moans loud enough for the neighbors and Dean repeats the motion. There is a long hard shudder down Castiel's spine and there. Perfect. A spurting stream of slick pours from the hole. Dean catches it with his tongue. Straight from the source. Wild cinnamon and tart tangy apples. Cas wails and Dean growls and tightens his grip in Alpha warning and begins to lick. Soft Omega flesh gives way for his fingers and tongue as he opens that hole wider. He holds Castiel’s cheeks squeezed hard enough to bruise and rubs his thumbs over and over the tight ring of his entrance. Stretching that pucker and licking every dripping inch of him from balls to that hot twitching center. He has been hard for so long now that it's beginning to hurt and he isn't sure exactly how he is going to keep from coming but he can't stop tasting. This is what he wanted from the second he smelled this sex. He wanted his face in it. He wanted to drink his lover. Dean coaxes two fingertips inside Castiel and he scoops wet strings of slick out of the hole to lap up. Wedging and licking and wiggling spreads it wider and gives him the space to tonguefuck the Omega. His afternoon scruff scrapes the tenderest flesh and Cas curses and pushes back and arches even more. Every possible encouragement to keep plunging his fingers and tongue into his eager channel. Castiel reaches back to hold himself wide and cants his hips higher to beg for more. His body is shaking and starting to dew with sweat as Dean wedges three and then four fingers inside. The Alpha twist his wrist and his knuckle rubs over Cas’ prostate. The response is immediate. Cas tenses hard and his body clamps down tight. Then a raw spasm pulses his hole and a rich flood of slick spurts from his stretched hole all the way up Deans wrist and across his cheek. Holy fuck. That was hot. Dean leans back to watch the reaction again. Gently folding his fingers to rub that spot again. Cas moans as his body seizes again. A hot deep spasm that shudders through him and another wet spray of slick spurts and drips down his thighs in rivulets. It's too damn hot and the Alpha is completely incapable of keeping up this teasing play. His mind is a raging mess and every instinct is hounding him into a punishing fuck.
The weight and texture of his Alpha saying they are mated is enough to shake Castiel to his core. This absolutely beautiful man is standing bare ass naked before him and using his true voice. Not to compel or demand. He is using it to bind himself to promises of waiting. Swearing to honor Castiel's timing and needs. If ever he had a moment to doubt or question his rash and compulsive behavior when he threw himself at Dean, right now he knows he won't question it again. This entire thing might have started by stumbling upon a naughty shared secret, but the warm sexy Alpha holding him now is everything he could have asked for.
It does feel familiar. The slip of warmth and brush of grace against his skin. Always tucked into the curve of a palm or fingertips. It had always been passed to Dean in quick gentle bursts. This was that. Until it wasn’t. Until it lingered and fanned out over the span of his shoulders like a slow warm wave. The intricate tracery of his tattoo begins to tingle, like a fingertip drawing over each section of the art in slow delicate sweeps.
Cas stares at him for a long moment with his brow furrowed. “Dean Winchester, I believe I am your mate. Why would you think you would never see me again?”
“Why Mr. Novak, it sounds like you are suggesting a whole lotta unmated sex.” Dean gasps as Cas finds his earlobe with his teeth. “What would the public say?” Dean chuckles and rubs his big palms over Cas’ ass.
It’s actually kinda perfect. The line outside the doors is almost all crammed into the club. This crowd though, it’s completely different. Middle aged folks, young professionals and not a bit of neon anywhere. In fact, flannels are pretty much standard wear for most of the men in line. Maybe more on the hipster-ish fashion end of the spectrum but still. It’s actually more comfortable to stand in this crowd than any he has seen in weeks. Maybe he has done the right thing. There are several incredibly beautiful dutch women that he certainly wouldn’t kick out of bed and he doesn’t feel like he should card them. He actually allows an excited frisson of nervousness creep into his hands and shoulders and fidgets with the tickets until they are mangled by the time he presents them at the door.
He hadn’t meant to. Truly. Cleaning Mr. Winchester's bedroom was always his favorite room. He always left it for last. Just thinking of the beautiful Alpha sleeping on the wide soft bed was enough to have the quiet Omega feeling perfectly content. Totally happy and wrapped in the musky scent of old books, leather and gasoline. Perfection.
Dean can't help but feel the rush of affection and warmth wash over him as his mate hovers. “Cas, I wasn't exactly thinking. I had a slick horny Omega hanging from my knot. So I had to bite.” he watches Cas finish the task from beneath his lashes. They are standing naked in the bathroom and every moment of having a warm loving Omega take care of him is heating his skin from the inside out. Cas curves his hand so gently around the bandage with possessive intent. He holds Dean's bicep like he can will the injury to heal. Like he can somehow claim the mark and make it behave for him.
“Dean Winchester.” Castiel’s tone has a breathless softness to it, as if the angel has just taken a punch to the stomach. But there is command there. Steel. Dean knows better than to keep moving as if he didn’t hear him. He stops in his tracks. He isn’t brave enough to turn around and face his friend, though. There really wasn’t any way to prepare for this conversation. Or maybe there was, but it was too late for that now.
His marking scent roars through the room and Dean can’t hang on anymore. He digs his fingers into Castiel’s shoulders and ruts up against Cas’s blazing hot face and cums in the soaked satin. His fat knot pops and it drags a long keening groan from deep in his chest. His entire body is slick with sweat and he clings to the pliant weight of his Omega.
Dean raises his eyebrows and a mischievous shine fills his eyes and the corners of his half smile. “Cas, I'm not sure if you remember, but we manage messes just fine together.”
A sudden realization hits Castiel. He doesn’t have time to be getting arrested here. He has to get to Dean. NOW. If the media knows about the kidnapping. He has to move. He cant beat this man for having Dean's name in his mouth.
Dean recovers first, “Cas. hey.” he manages in a shaky croak. He wipes his hands on his jeans, obviously apprehensive.
Gabriel waits. He watches the tender curve of Castiel’s wings around the sleeping human. Only popped out for a few hours and stuffy stiff Castiel is cuddling some human in the parking lot. His chaotic loving heart thrills with the sheer awesome weirdness of it. What the everliving fuck had happened? He wouldn’t miss this for the world. So he waits until Castiel seems to shake the hypnotic thrall of the sleeping man. The angel lifts his fragile burden and turns. Castiel almost drops the man in surprise when he spots Gabriel. He had forgotten all about his friend. His wings flap out and his big blue eyes bug out. It’s so goddamn funny that Gabriel laughs until his face burns. He had never seen the angel so much as flinch. Ever. The stoic calm of angelic assurance had always kept him completely placid. The impossible happens again as Castiel flushes red again. Blushing! For the second time in an hour. "Oh Castiel," Gabriel murmurs fondly. "What in the world is going on? Tell me why you are shining so bright. You projected all of this to Mars I bet!"
It turns out that a neat little note propped on his dresser is more pressing than the apocalypse. Holy shit. How had he missed it? His undignified bowlegged knot walk to the dresser is totally worth it. He gasps and gathers the sweatpants to his crotch with a third orgasm of the hour as he makes it safely back to the bed. Goddamn. He is a fucking mess.
There is one almighty snort and then dead silence for a long long moment. “Hey Cas, you didn’t just wake yourself up with your snoring did you?” He asks innocently enough. His voice is wavering with badly concealed laughter. Cas doesn’t answer and just yanks the blanket up over his head with an embarrassed sound. Dean can’t just let it go of course. He follows his mate beneath the covers and reaches for his waist while chuckling. “Cas, I am gonna have to tell the teen hearthrob magazine about your terrible noise.” Dean teases, while scooting forward to find his lover’s neck with his teeth. Cas groans pitifully and rumbles a protest in the deepest gravelled morning voice ever. “Dean, I don’t usually snore. I have allergies. I was at the gravesite. They must have mowed it.”
“Cas, its fine.” Dean covers the Omega's hand with his own. This only makes the frown on his mate's face even worse. “Hey. Talk to me.”
Castiel hardly ever points out how inhuman he is. There are some days when Dean can even forget. The knowledge that he is cradled in the arms of a practically immortal being capable of leveling cities strikes him silent again.
“But you are fighting for your emancipation. You want to be free and not tied to any Alpha.” Dean spreads his hands like his logic is completely reasonable.
He knows exactly what he needs to do. He will comfort his Alpha. Give him some place to rest that is warmed by the encircling scent of loving Omega. Castiel undresses slowly, letting his chest expand with the feeling of reaching out to hold Mr. Winchester close. Slipping into the freshly made bed feels so good. The pillow and mattress are soaked in the heavy bass notes of Alpha scent. Castiel breathes deeply and feels his throat closing with emotion.
Dean thinks back on the interview he had with his housekeeper. Just the one, it was mostly a formality. He was scent sensitive and didn’t want somebody totally incompatible to be in his home for hours at a time. The only remembrance he has of the encounter was an impression of “church lady” Mothery and conservative. She had wide blue eyes that were extraordinary but her soft brown hair and trim suit had pretty much screamed that she was settled and fading into the gentle scent of late middle age. Not exactly the hot raw fuck that is drenching his bathroom right now. Looks could be deceiving though, his brother kept reminding him to “stop following your nose into the sack, Dean.” He couldn’t help it though. It hadn’t led him too astray so far. Sexy people just smell sexy. It’s a fact. This scent already had him gently massaging the base of his cock through his jeans. Could that soft lightly faded vanilla scent really have morphed to the sex bomb that went off in here? She did sorta have a “hot librarian” thing going on. So maybe?
Sammy yells a lot more when the YouTube video goes viral about a month later. “WHEN were you going to tell me DEAN?” he thunders.
If that feathered bastard hadn't gone and blown a giant hole into Dean's chest by walking out into the reservoir. If he hadn't sacrificed himself to death and left Dean with the stained shadow of those wings imprinted somewhere deep and hurting. If Castiel hadn't haunted him right into that tattoo shop. Fuck.
Dean has never been slapped in the face by a lover before. His pulse slams as he considers it. What the fuck? He doesn't know if he even wants that but his cock certainly isn’t against the idea. “Ok.” He is curious. “Do it.” he whispers. Dean barely takes another breath before Castiel's hand has cracked hard against his face. It kicks his head to the side and heat immediately blooms in his cheek. It throbs with his heartbeat and his dick pulses and twitches to the same throb. Goosebumps race over his skin and he shivers hard. “Fuck.” he pants before his eyes fly back up to Castiel.
Cas remains silent but moves into the living room looking pale and shaken. Now that he is here, it seems like everything for the past year is just piling right on top of his head. All at once. He is so goddamn tired. Every single detail of his private life and struggle has been exposed to the entire world. Every day has been challenge after challenge. The only thing. The only singular thing he could cling to, is that he had kept Dean out of that constant microscope. And now all of that is ruined too. He has had to ask himself a hundred, a thousand times? Can I do this? Can I KEEP doing this? Will I survive this? It’s just one more weight added to the rest but he can feel himself breaking. Why can’t he have just one private thing? Just one secret left to himself. One quiet night that had soft kisses and the scent of sandalwood and books. He tries to breathe around the pain.
“I don't think that an Alpha can even consent when an unmated male Omega is in the room” a pretty blonde political commentator had said, nodding her head and crossing her petite perfect legs. “They have special pheromones in their slick and it's like leaving a drug laying out in the room. It's irresponsible for us to expose people to the risk!” she tucks a pale strand of hair behind her ear and continues. “we can’t just ignore the possibility that maybe your Alpha. A loving gentle Alpha could come in contact with an unmated male Omega at his job! In his home! It's so sad to see families wrecked and the sanctity of marriage endangered by just leaving a highly potent drug walking around our workplaces and homes.”
“It’s EDM. Electronic Dance Music? No lyrics. Just computer generated and with that beat to it. You know?”
“I bet if we were listening to the TV, we could hear exactly what they would say.” Cas replies sardonically.
“Hey wait! Cas?” Dean strides close again, probably closer than friends should probably stand, and definately much closer than strangers. Cas turns those heavenly eyes toward his face and Dean almost loses his train of thought. “Your mom, is she going to be ok? Is she in the hospital? I would like to visit if I could.”
Dean isn’t any sort of prude and it is a sort of weird intimacy to be cleaning a home for somebody. You are bound to find some secrets and well, fuck. The note mentions him wearing them. Fuck. Ok. So she figured that part out. That he hadn’t just been one of those souvenir collectors. Goddamnit. It was because his cum was all over them but nobody else's. Damn, she is clever. He isn’t sure he would have figured out that sort of nuance in the middle of a sex haze. It's kind of impressive really. The sex detective working in his house. She pictured him wearing them. And lost her stiff little skirt over it. Thats. Well that's kinda flattering. Kinda hot. And she smells so fucking good.
He was too sleep deprived and emotionally wrung out to do anything other than let the tears fall from the corners of his eyes. The longing blooms into the full wild spark of Alpha determination to claim. He would let himself want this. He would shelter this claiming demand in his chest. He would have his mate. John Winchester hadn’t spoiled the bright heart of his son completely. There in his bed, it began to softly shine again. A mess making Omega had coaxed the tired heart of his Alpha into life. And he is Alpha to his very DNA. He will get what he wants.
Dean carefully peeks through the curtains that lace the window facing the yard. “It's them. Holy shit. That’s a lot.”
Gabriel chuckles and swirls the candy behind his teeth. "We like to think we are superior, Castiel. We are stronger and live longer lives and have access to other dimensions and technology. If we admitted that these beautiful bright souls can do things we envy, we might start respecting them. Ha! We might start loving them. And there is the matter of exploitation. I know you were in heaven doing your duty in those days, but angels have been monsters that used souls as candy. As a drug to abuse. As currency. We had to stop it. Or at least limit it. So. The host set boundaries. Created tuning so we couldn't mate with them. It got better. But now that Heaven is at war and God isn't handing down the orders, I don't know. Maybe somebody is starting all of that up again. Maybe they have found a way to overcome the tuning?" Gabriel sighs and scrubs his palms down his thighs before standing. "You know, I was enjoying this vacation, Castiel. Now it looks like I am going back into the fray." His words sound so tired but his expression is still warm with affection. Castiel can see it for the first time. His eyes had been blind to the duality and humanity that Gabriel carried in his actions. Had he been this way all along? The angel was carrying hope and fear all within his vessel simultaneously while also radiating intention and celestial purpose. It was a little bit amazing.
Castiel curls his fingertips into the edges of his trenchcoat. More and more often lately, he has retreated into the folds of his comfort coat because it came from before. Not much had come from before. Before the media and the paparazzi. Before the night time talk show hosts and photoshoots. But his coat had come from before. He has been living mostly in hotels and rented spaces. His clothes are all brand new and still stiff from the racks. Everything sleek and expensive and temporary. All paid for by his legal defense fund. Donations to his case and cause had rolled in from all across the planet and a nonprofit had been set up to manage his needs. Meg, his handler is a fucking demon at organization and so he floats along in this bright haze of fundraisers and shaking hands with the right senators. It's all so fast. So frenzied that he can hardly think.
Dean presses his mouth into a thin line trying his VERY best to hide the explosion of laughter that threatens. He dips his head to study the parts ordering sheet before him and hopes that Garth. Garth? Yeah. Garth doesn’t notice that he is about to die laughing at the absurdity of “U Cant Touch This” being ANYONE’s soul song. It's a cruel joke. It's absolutely ludicrous and he is about to lose his shit just thinking of whatever circumstances had instigated their meeting. Did they meet at a 90’s themed Halloween party?
Dean brushes his lips in the softest slow kiss because suddenly Cas is so very close and suddenly there isn't any kind of hurry. His lips are surprisingly lush and wider than the feminine mouths he has kissed before. Besides, Cas seems to be frozen for a long few seconds. Registering the feeling before finally nudging his chin forward to encourage Dean to press again. They linger with just slow sweet nuzzling touches until Dean nips Castiel's bottom lip with his teeth. That inspires a soft little sound to pour from his mouth into Dean's.
Castiel finally relieves the growing tension with the barest hint of a smile and that deep warm voice “Hello, Dean” and suddenly everything is so much better. Cas had used his actual name. He hadn’t called him “Mr. Winchester”.
“That is hardly fair, Cas.” Dean says, surprising himself by how quickly that dazed look had restored his own confidence. “I haven’t touched your wings.” He dares with way more confidence than he deserves. Anyone that had the warrior angel looking like he saw a vision of nirvana would have a boost of confidence. Hell. Dean is going to be replaying this exact look in his mind over and over. Half the time he had been worried that the angel would smite him for having the audacity to do what he had done. Some “mud-monkey” parading around with that permanent declaration on his skin.
They are definitely a mess. It’s absolutely gross how they flaunt the media inquiries and refuse to mate while still being sex fiends. It's so messy to tie two lives together when one life is famous and exposed. It’s downright filthy to spend so many long distance days on video calls and text messages. It’s messy to handle grief and loss as Castiel mourns the mother he wishes he had. It’s messy to handle the politics of a country that wants to oppress and hurt the one you love. It’s messy to wait, even if they do win in the end. But that really is life, isn’t it? Handling one mess after another. And they aren't alone. Dean and his beautiful messy love will keep shining for a long while yet.
Dean imagines a throng of teenagers with glow sticks. They wore neon. NEON for fucks sake. Was his soul mate some kid that spent their weekends with ecstasy and clubs? The more he thought about it, the more his stomach felt like it was sinking. His soulsong doesn’t even have any REAL instruments. Just some computer bleeping and blooping.
Cas’ face and scent suddenly crumble with worry. “You won't be for long. The press. They know. Somehow. The media knows about the kidnapping. At the funeral some reporter asked me about the “kidnapping scandal”. Cas actually raises his hands to frame the term with quotes. So now your name is associated with mine and I'm sure they won't let it go.”
Together they dive into the pulsing current of the deeps. The watery thump of the kick echoes across the cold dark expanse and the twittering chirp of dolphins changes to the mournful song of whales calling to the ever shrinking pods. The ocean seems to expand bigger and bigger as more and more species fall away to extinction and the great creatures sing in further diminishing numbers until there is only one song left.
“Do you see something you like, Dean?” the vulnerable look that the Alpha shoots Cas instantly melts all the impulse to tease the guy.
Charlie catches the wince and her eyes widen as she vehemently throws her hands forward. “NOT that your song is weird. Really! Fuck. It’s a good song. It’s one of the best ones on the list I think. Meg picked a good one. It’s just not our usual coffee shop stuff. Its EDM.”
Angel does look so happy though. His shoulders are rocking to the beat and his hands keep bouncing out toward the crowd. He looks so young and carefree. Those wings pulse with joyful light and the crowd relaxes into rollicking ease.
Cas exhales a little laugh and leans back before his confession can be kissed back into oblivion. “Dean, I haven’t actually. Ever. Well. Any of this. I haven't kissed anyone before.”
Now that they are talking, Dean begins to feel awkward and twitches forward as if to step away. Castiel doesn’t give an inch and refuses to release the hunter. His arm tightens and the reminder of how intimate the position they are in cascades down Dean’s spine. The long lean press of the angel’s body is plastered even tighter against his back from hips to shoulder.
The language of an angel is so close to the words that created the universe. Enochian is a way to say a single word and mean everything. Dean only has four words in enochian tattooed on his back. Three of them directed their attention back to the fourth and crowning word. In the way of the angels. Each word carries entire ideas and moods. In english it would seem so. Innocuous.
Dean watches the DJ suddenly dip his head. The music settles into a rolling thump and Angel turns to drink some water. The switch is so fast that Dean can picture the man suddenly covering his chest and hiding. That embarrassing intimacy has evaporated so quickly that Dean wonders if he had imagined it. Sure. Music is supposed to inspire emotions. He is just meeting this artist and sometimes a first meeting feels odd. Especially with somebody so beautiful. He is pretty sure that every new fan feels a little bit awed when they first see Angel on the decks.
Monday mornings suck. Especially Monday mornings when you only get three hours of sleep. Just one more hour would have made a world of difference, but it wasn’t meant to be. Dean’s sleep had been interrupted by the weirdest dreams. Maybe Sammy was right. Bacon cheeseburgers are starting to warp his sleep. If this was getting old, it sucked. There had been this flashing blue light and the sound of a heartbeat and the feeling of having to run away. It really was a freaking weird ass dream and then his brain hadn’t let him fall back asleep. So here he was on Monday morning, lining up with every other poor working soul to grab some caffeine. At least most of the morning rush had already trickled away and the 9am drabble of folks weren’t enough to get his grump any more ruffled than it already was. Dean snags his coffee from the red-haired barista with only a half hearted smile. He finds a corner table to slump over and flips his phone into his palm to check for any updates from Sammy. Nothing but an Instagram picture showing his dorky puppy face shining as he snugs Jess right up against his enormous chest. Figures. They look amazing of course. Dean feels his heart bump harder in his chest. Jealousy? Nah. He is truly happy that his brother has found somebody. His chest just keeps up that hard thump though. Reaching to rub at the ache, he frowns a bit at his coffee. A racing heart with only a couple of sips of coffee? Nah.
Falling asleep in the middle of the afternoon means that Dean is completely disoriented when he wakes just after two in the morning. There had been a sound. For a second, he is thrown back into the nightmare of the last time he had seen Castiel. Any second now, there will be the slam of boots and screams and confusion.
“Uhm..when I stood up, all the wetness inside just made a break for it. So I got a flood. It just reached my ankles. I am officially wet to my ankles. That is ridiculous Alpha. What did you do to me?” He is half smiling smugly and shaking his head. “Go on and get in bed before you cum again. Bring a towel. I will be there in a minute. I’m going to clean up a little bit and get rid of the fire hazard.
There is no way in hell that Dean can listen to that tone in Castiel’s voice and not turn around to see what it looks like. What his face is doing when he says something like that. So he does. He turns to face Castiel and isn’t disappointed. The angel looks poleaxed. His lips are parted as if he still hasn’t picked his jaw up from when it dropped. Eyes wide and not quite focused. Hands gripping the sides of his trenchcoat as if to hold them back.
“I missed you too. So much.” Dean answers before falling into the spell of the humming air conditioner and the waning gold of evening sunlight. They doze while somebody outside is mowing a lawn and the house wraps them safe and warm and together. Finally.
“So what are you going to do about it? Was your soulmate there? What song is it?” Dean has heard that tone in Sam's voice. He is on a personal mission. This was trouble. Sam doesn’t let things go. Not once they pique the interest of that giant brain. He holds on to whatever has interested him and picks it to death. He lives for meddling.
“I thought you said it was safe.” Dean points out, not truly concerned, only amused at the contradicting words.
Castiel moves faster than he ever has. Will he make it in time? How far has this information spread? He should call Meg. He can’t speed. Slow. Slow. Dean. His Alpha. He can’t drag Dean into this shitshow. It’s a circus and he has already done too much. What if they are already camped outside of his house?
This was a dumb idea. Dean stares at the plane tickets in his hand and groans miserably. Fucking planes. Apparently nobody in Lawrence aside from fucking Meg even knows his song exists. The enigmatic Angel is apparently one of those mysterious ones like the guy who wears the giant mouse head. Nobody knows who it is. There is only the tiniest shred of information about Angel. Not in English. But Sam was stubborn and kept wrangling this gordian knot like it personally offends him to not immediately find an answer. He found plenty of Dutch websites that go on about Angel. Before Dean even knows what hits him, he is loading his bags onto a plane and heading for Holland. Goddamn Europe. What the fuck? This is stupid. Going to an Angel concert. It's the next gamble they are taking. There isn't a single American venue on the website. Of course not. This Angel is doing a European tour right now and there isn't any sort of indication that the DJ will be returning to play music in the states any time soon.
Hey everyone. Condoms are awesome. Condoms are absolutely necessary. Please use them. Get yourself tested before fucking without condoms! But I am not going to use them in this story. Its an ABO porny thing. We have fantastical sex and so its gonna be magic sex without STDs
“I'm still not quite sure, Cas. You really should do that again.” he suggests and turns his face the smallest degree to telegraph his willingness to accept another hard slap. Cas whimpers and bucks his hips twice before he gathers himself enough to raise his hand and hit Dean's face again. The second slap is as hard as the first and Dean’s cock acted like it was expecting the jolt. That first stinging pulse of pain matched the twitch of his dick and he had no idea he was so close. Cas is trembling and pushing his heated hand down on Deans and driving his cock up against the pressure and they are both coming hard. What the fuck? Had he orgasmed because it felt that good or because Castiel was so amped on it? Both?
“I am sorry, Cas. Let me know if there is absolutely anything I can do.” Focusing completely on the desire to comfort and help, Dean hopes that it shifts his scent enough for his mate to know his offering is sincere. “Where is she, Cas?” Dean finally cannot possibly resist anymore, and his wide warm palm reaches to cup Castiel’s elbow. The Omega stiffens just a hair and he dips his eyes to track the press of Dean’s fingers into the sleeve of his coat. Dean gets distracted by the sweep of Castiel’s lashes against his cheek. Heartbreakingly beautiful.
Cas turns his face until the scrape of his stubble drags along the messy tangle of feathers drawn on Dean’s skin. He hadn’t wanted perfect feathers. He wanted a warriors wing. Some of them ragged and missing chunks of vane. He wanted those wings. The ones he had only seen in cast shadows. The ones that he had imagined. They were so clear sometimes in hallucinations, flashbacks. In the depths of his mourning. They had haunted him. Those wings. The angel they belonged to.
“It’s a henge that you activated with your angst and the help of an angel and you are lucky you didn’t explode. And... Your boyfriend?” Cas repeats in a flat completely unamused tone.
His, no, their bed was a safe place and the wild hunger of his Omega was tempered with concern and full of the floral notes of comforting reassurance. It wasn't a horny accident. This was another mood entirely. His own sleeplessness and private pain had been noticed. Not ignored. The thrumming response of his body is first and foremost, the arcing strike of raw pleasure. But the spreading aftermath is his aching relief and the hesitant acceptance of this precious miracle. His eyes are stinging with tears as his body roars for release. His Omega is back. He is not alone.
Dean does visit Naomi’s bedside the very next day. He approaches straight from work and carrying the weirdest looking plant. He walks directly up to Castiel and thrusts the spindly looking potted oddity right into his surprised hands. “I can’t really buy flowers or shop for them. They kinda fuck with my nose and it's all weird for days. So I was thinkin’ and a plant is kinda the same idea. So I went to the grocery store and this little dude was the only one there. He kinda grows on ya though. I was thinking he looked like a Gary. You know? Sorta weird but totally one of the good guys. With that wild hairdo and all.” Dean finally manages to take a breath and realises he has been babbling for quite a while without a hello and that Cas is looking at him with wide surprised eyes. Dean blushes so pink that his freckles look like they are trying to float off of his face. Looking away to avoid that lazer blue stare, Dean finally notices that the patient isn’t in the room at all actually.
Until he reaches out from behind the curtain to search for a towel. Nothing. Not a single towel in the tiny room. Of fucking course. Dean sighs. Ok. He is going to have to drip his way into the main room and find something to dry off with.
“Are you telling me that I have a magic tattoo that I can summon my boyfriend with?” Dean says, suddenly struck with how friggin cool that is.
“No Sam, I haven't found them yet.” Dean's voice is surprisingly quiet and vulnerable sounding and Sam is silent for a long beat. It is suddenly very clear how delicate this entire thing is for his brother. Dean isn’t the type to talk about things he wants for himself. If Sam isn't careful, Dean will completely close up about this topic and turn stubborn and impossible on it. “I can help you find them.” Sam suggests in what he hopes is a casual enough tone. “Just tell me the name of the song and we can figure out where it plays a lot. I mean, we can go to places and just see. If it’s a top hit it will probably be pretty difficult. But you never know, man.”
The sound startles him again, and he has to cover his mouth to keep from laughing out loud. His mate is snoring. It's too dark to make out the man that is sprawling across the bed and sawing logs pretty vigorously. He certainly didn’t remember him snoring before. For some reason, he isn’t annoyed. He would be annoyed with literally any other human being snoring. For some reason, with Cas he just is happy to have him close enough to enjoy his body heat and knowing that his mate is safe and resting.
The shock of what Castiel has just said completely dumbfounds Gabriel. He simply blinks at his friend. “What? Are you sure? That's impossible.”
“It was very native american. Like. Talking eagle. Very peyote.” Dean says with thought creased brows.
They collapse into a tangle of sweaty limbs and content moans as Dean continues with a third and fourth orgasm. Dean works them into a comfortable spooned cuddle and they both fall into a sated post coital dozing nap.
Dean feels his exhaustion hit again and scrubs his face with his hand. It's too much. Today is too much. He just wants to go home and crawl under the covers.
Of all the ways that Dean pictured he might die, this wasn’t one of them. He wasn’t even on the tough part of the hunt! He had only been curious! Being a bit of a grease monkey, he had just wanted a peek at some of the innards of the industrial combine. The one right next to the crime scene. On second thought, he really knew better. Haunted combine isn’t even the weirdest thing he has encountered. He was doing ok though, jumping back when the thing whined to life, spinning on his heel to scoot out of there, when it happened. A scalding hot scrape of metal up his spine. Instantly he freezes in pure shock. Then, before his next breath, what might have been a scream is stolen as he is yanked harder than he has ever been yanked backward.
They both freeze and Cas immediately asks in a panicked voice “Dean! Are you hurt? What?  IS THAT BLOOD?” His fingertips are wet and it’s too dark to see. Immediately he scrambles off the Alpha and reaches to knock absolutely everything off the side table to get the lamp on. They both wince at the terribly bright light and sure enough, his fingertips glisten with fresh blood. There is a livid ring of teeth marks on Dean’s arm and the pressure had reopened the wound to bleed sluggishly. Before he can even breathe a protest, Cas has whisked them into the master bathroom and dug out the first aid kit so he can fuss with the injury. “Dean, this won't heal like a mating bite would. No extra antibodies from a blood bond. What were you thinking?” he scolds and bandages and scowls over the the injury as if it were a deadly wound.
Castiel can move faster than human eyes can see. He can dance between raindrops if he wanted to. But for some reason he cant move from the spot where he gapes at the crowd and one glowing soul pushes toward the stage. There is a slight scuffle between security and then the praying man is on the floor, seizing. Immediately, the angel panics. Fuck. Fuck.
It really is no big deal. Keeping his shirt on. Seems incredibly easy. Hell, chicks do it. Right? The obvious answer is layers. Just always have three or four shirts on. So if something happens you just peel one off and keep moving. No big deal. Well. Except he has found himself in yet another friggin ridiculous situation with only one shirt and one enormously gross hunt. So. Now what.
“Probably not” Charlie answers. “Most EDM artists go by a pseudonym. You might find the name online though.”
Benny turns his head with relief evident on his face. “Hey brotha, there you are. I was hoping you would be back before we got to the station. Your shoulder is fucked. I talked them out of taking you to the hospital. I knew an ambulance would cost another fortune. It’s already gonna cost you a shit ton. I’ll help you pop it in. I got a sling somewhere in the house.”
Castiel tightens his fingers and pulls gently at Dean’s hair. The Alpha whines and squirms at the gentle tug and so Cas takes the encouragement for permission and pulls harder, until it bends his throat back for Cas to thoroughly explore. Finding his pulse with his tongue Cas licks and sucks the taste of sexed out Alpha from his skin. And then rubs his own scent there. The feral impulse makes Dean's hands clench at Cas’ hips and he moans softly. “mmmfuck I did this the first time Cas. The first time you marked our home. There was your slick wet on a towel. I put it there. Right there. And on my wrists and between my legs.”
“Ah! Found it.” Charlie flips her order pad onto the table and writes as she speaks. “Its called, The Road So Far and its by the artist Angel.” Ripping the square away from the pad, she hands it to Dean. He takes it like it is laced with arsenic.
