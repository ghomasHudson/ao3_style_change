“Just till Gabriel sorts out an apartment for me,” Lucifer promised, so clearly this return to the real world was planned, it was no surprise to Cas that Gabriel already knew. “I know you don’t really mind the company. So what’s going to be for dinner?”
“Dean….”
It was worth it. He needed this. He’d done so much to separate himself from the rest of his family, from the way he was brought up. Not as much as Gabriel or Lucifer, but he’d made the moves that were right for himself.
Dean opened his mouth to reply and then suddenly all the lights in the lodge went out. Dean’s head jerked up and he looked around, peering into the dim light of the emergency lights with a rumble of uncertainty. Only moments later someone appeared with a bright flashlight.
“So…” Castiel paused as he signed the receipt and slid it back to Dean. “Saturday?”
“Would you want me to try to help you find your witch?” he offered, gently.
Doctor Sexy filled his plate with just about everything as well, and soon they’d stolen a table to eat and talk further. The man was delightful, liked to read, but didn’t seem to understand more than half of his pop culture references Dean threw at him in conversation. That was amusing, and endearing in a way, Dean liked him despite his clear need to watch a number of movies and tv shows. H liked the timber of his voice, the way he was clearly quite not his brother Gabriel. The Doctor was handsome, intelligent, and made him feel relaxed.
“Ah, hello, Dean, I’m Castiel. I spoke with you last night?” he introduced himself quietly, his eyes flicking over the man with interest. He was handsome and definitely not someone that Castiel would say no to if he met him in a club, not that he went often these days.
Cas couldn’t help a little laugh and he reached up to stroke the edge of Dean’s beard a little, just slowly petting slowly for a moment. “I enjoyed that very much,” he murmured, and he let himself smile at Dean. “And I would enjoy exploring more of this with you.”
“I...I’m really not,” Castiel started to protest quietly, blushing some and tipped his head. He paused to think about the nests, few he’d seen, in Heaven, the bed he had at the bunker; then he thought about what would make him most comfortable. He quietly grabbed for some of the pillows and started to arrange them, “did the woman give us every pillow in the motel?”
Those green eyes, so beautiful, changed at once, joy replacing the fear and Dean practically launched himself, pushing Cas down and leaning in to kiss him again. For several frantic minutes that’s all they did, Kiss. Dean tasting of whiskey, pizza, pie, him. Castiel was savoring every bit of it, afraid he could never have this again.
A soft blush dusted his cheeks now and then he blinked at him a little and chuckled. “I am, too,” he agreed at a whisper, “and I’d like to do this again.”
“Have a look over there.” He pointed now to a full length standing mirror off to the side.
“Dean, we need real supplies, what is this?” Blue eyes narrowed as he frowned at the list that Dean had texted him. The snow was already too deep to take Baby back out from the motel to get anything and Cas had offered to collect things. It would be an easy flight to the nearest grocery to buy some emergency items, since it seemed they were going to get snowed in by this unexpected first snowfall.
Many years ago, when he’d first attended a scene event there, he’d almost lost himself. Thankfully Balthazar had agreed to come, to watch his back, and pulled him out before he could get himself into too much trouble. Never again, though, had he gone there with the singular idea of just hooking up. The club was good about their patrons and their safety, but there would always be Doms who turned out to be less than savory, and there would always be those who managed to appear normal and safe until you were alone with them.
He shifted to sit up somewhat, waiting for Dean to release him completely so that he could comply. He almost felt cold when Dean let him go. He moved to get up though and then he quietly followed his instructions, exiting the living room and moving down the hallway. He could feel Dean’s eyes on him until he was out of sight in the hallway, and it made his stomach flutter with excitement.
Castiel couldn’t help a smile at how family like they sounded, he moved to have a seat and wait for Dean to reappear, only half watching as Charlie grinned and turned her attention back to the pretty blonde woman. They clearly were familiar with each other and it was sort of cute to watch, though he did it out of the corner of his eye more than anything, not wanting to be rude.
“I can’t.”
//I am// The voice startled him – and then he blinked and considered it. Quiet, but low, and comforting too.
“We’re sorry about this, it seems the heavy snowfall has done something to the power,” came a voice. “If everyone could just go to their rooms? Stay together, we’ll have some things brought around, complimentary.”
“Stretch out on your back, get comfortable, if you need to, put a pillow under your hips.”
Cas knew he was lost. The way that Dean took him down was thrilling, it made him want to grab onto Dean, to thrust up into that mouth eagerly. Instead, his fingers dug into the sheets, knowing he hadn’t been given permission to touch, no matter how much he ached for it.
Well damn, not going to stick around then Dean thought. That was a shame, but maybe they could have a little fun anyway? He hummed low in his throat and didn’t make it far with the thought before Blue eyes spoke again.
“Let yourself in when you get to my door.” Dean’s voice sounded from the speaker, only a little bit tinny for it.
“Castiel, angel of the lord,” Dean said quietly and with a little serious rumble to his voice, despite the flush of his cheeks, “may I preen your wings?”
“Shops open for short hours, but yes. I try to be there every Sunday,” Dean replied, and then he moved to slid his arm around Castiel and turned him back towards the parking lot that they’d left the Impala in, in front of the Roadhouse.
“Fuck, so…” The words interrupted him, and he could hear Dean shift behind him “What do you need me to do?”
“I’m so glad you asked for my number, Cas.”
“If that’s the noise you make when eating,” Dean laughed softly and winked at him lightly, “I can’t wait to hear what noises you make in bed.”
“All right, I think…” Dean’s mouth moved to his stomach, then slowly upwards, almost a reversal of how he’d kissed his way down earlier. “Ready?”
“So, we both have some mess to bring into this,” he said quietly and he wasn’t that surprised when Dean laughed a little at this. He leaned up to kiss Dean softly now, thankful that he was taking it so well.
Green eyes flicked up to him, dark, sincere, and then there was a hand cupping him through the fabric that still covered his crotch. The moan that slid from Castiel’s throat was low and loud and undeniable. Dean’s only response was to adjust his hand and massage some more, until Castiel felt a shudder roll physically through him.
Finally he was able to get the tie off, and he dropped it, moving to unbutton his shirt and shrug out of it. He flexed his shoulders, feeling the press underneath the skin; his wings needed out, and they needed it now. “Stand back.”
“Clearly your heart,” Dean teased back now and then he dug into his meal.
Family dinner night was a set date, Thursday nights. No matter what was going on they shared dinner that night, even if it meant attending via Facetime, which sometimes it did, with Eileen dragging Sam out every few weeks to keep him on his toes.
//That sounds lovely, should I bring anything?// he sent back quickly now, not even a little worried about sounding overeager.
Within a few minutes Dean had refilled their glasses from the wine bottle and they moved themselves to the living room. Castiel was comfortable as they got settled down on the couch, tucking into Dean’s open side as the man flicked the TV on and chose a video for them to watch. It was relaxing and lazy, and it felt natural to melt into Dean’s side, to rest his head on his shoulder and let the other man’s sure fingers stroke his shoulder.
“No, Cas don’t.”
“Good night, Cas,” he said quietly now, the tone of his voice told the young professor that Dean was just as reluctant to leave as he was to let him go. But Cas swallowed and pushed down the urge to beg him to stay, feeling like it too was somehow a test, even if just a tiny one.
“While it heals?” Cas asked with a nod. “Of course. And how much do you think this would cost me?”
“You are my everything Dean.” Cas whispered. Dean just let his eyes close, just letting the angel hold him. It was like coming home, letting down any mask that remained. “Sam….”
The artist had managed a pair of sleep pants, but from here Cas was distracted by the ink scrawled over his shoulders and part way down his back. It was beautiful, really, to study how Dean wore so much on his skin. Cas had a feeling he could understand it a bit better now that he had his tree on his back, even if it wasn’t quite done.
“Oh, Cassie, how brave!” Lucifer grinned now, putting his laptop aside on the coffee table and turning to look at him. “So?”
“I’d love to,” he didn’t even hesitate to agree.
“Sweet, but not so sweet as sugar, and a bit healthier, too,” he mused and then had a sip.
He moved to slowly settle himself by the foot of the bed, taking as much time as he dared, not knowing when Dean would appear. He flexed his toes then adjusted his knees a little, taking his weight just a little bit differently than he had a moment before and he let his hands rest lightly on his thighs. He took slow breaths, adjusting to the feeling of his mental space. Subspace; not deep, but enough to relax himself.
“Metatron, he said, I was in love with Humanity.” Castiel’s eyes were dark, searching, watching his face closely. “He wasn’t completely right. I don’t love all of humanity. I do love you though Dean. And I am tired of hiding behind the mask which keeps it silent.”
Dean paused once the beds were together and grabbed for his drink, downing it quickly and shifted to refill it. “All right angel, you’re the nest expert.”
Dean’s laugh in reply was all he needed to know it was the right choice for him to stay. He looked forward to everything to come after.
“Most of them should be disposed of properly, but,” Cas shifted now to look down at the fallen ones, “a few need to be saved. I’ll pick them out then the rest should be burned.”
“Oh, I think about six hundred,” Dean answered honestly. “Unless you want it very big. Where on your back were you thinking?”
“Good.”
“Yes.” Castiel eased himself up from the chair and moved over to Dean’s little section of the parlour, automatically starting to unbutton his shirt. “I’m a bit excited, too.”
He took a steady breath and he found the bedroom. He couldn’t help taking a moment to look the room over. There were band posters on the walls and some personal pictures. At least one was of Dean’s brother on the wall. Overall, it was very comfortable; not too clean, not too messy. He took a breath and he moved to start undressing, slowly taking his clothing off and folding it, placing it neatly on top of the dresser since there wasn’t another obvious place.
“You could have picked pretty much any time besides this, you know,” he pointed out, and then he was crowded against the counter by an eager looking Angel. “Or..not,” Dean grunted as his mouth was caught by those amazing, holy lips. Lips he knew could do utterly sinful things, lips that were quite insistent on his own. Dean easily raised his hands up to grasp at the t-shirt Cas was wearing, one of Dean’s own. He was pretty sure those sleep pants were his too.
“....Cas?” He sat up properly, his eyes already searching.
“There we go, sweetheart, you’re taking me so well,” Dean purred low against his ear now, his mouth brushing tenderly against the lobe there, catching it, sucking on it briefly, tongue flicking against his skin lightly.
“That wasn’t a very long attempt to stay home.”
Castiel nodded in understanding and he remained still as the other man moved to grab a towel from the few things that he’d clearly gotten out when Castiel had been kneeling with his head down. The soft looking terry cloth was spread out on the bed, adjusted after a moment. “Move it if you need to,” Dean murmured, and then he touched Castiel’s hip in a nudging fashion.
“Not unless you want to lose the detail you put into it, it won’t be. I would definitely recommend this going somewhere like your back; were you already thinking about that?” Dean glanced up at him from the tablet, pausing in his sketching. “It would take at least a few sessions, two long ones at the very least.”
“I, Yes Dean. Thank you.” Cas said quietly and then he was surprised as Dean swayed? leaned? into his space, those green eyes studying him so closely for a moment.
“Yes, sir,” he replied softly, enjoying the bright glint in those green eyes. Cas was starting to feel like he could watch Dean’s face forever.
His eyes drooping closed already. He had missed this, it was nice to know he could have again.
He poured some clean cool water into the bowl, then found the matches and lit the candle. The squirrel startled at that and seemed to back up. He blinked and glanced over at it. “What’s the matter? It’s just a small candle, I promise I’ll put it out when i’m done...”
“Mmm, I’m getting a towel, and then I want you to get on the bed,” Dean breathed as he pulled back out of the kiss. His green eyes were dark and delightful and Castiel was in heaven—absolute heaven, and they’d hardly done much. His heaven was green eyes and a firm touch.
A groan left the other man, fingers tangling now in the hair at the back of Castiel’s head, and he moved his mouth with ease, lips brushing over the soft ridge of flesh so that he could slide them around the head of Dean’s cock. He sucked lightly, not more than a teasing swipe of his tongue, his blue eyes flicking upwards to see the look of bliss on Dean’s face that made a rush of power sweep over him.
He couldn’t blame him at all. Building a business from the ground up was very much like starting writing a new book. You had to start with a framework, do research and take risks. Castiel was fairly sure, though, that his own risks were not as dangerous as trying to open a business.
He couldn’t help a smile of his own now. “Awesome, I’ll let them know.”
“Here we are.” Dean let the car shift into park and then he squeezed Castiel’s hand, Cas glanced up at him and then he leaned over and kissed Dean quickly, trying to keep it light and easy.
“Sure, we’ll just finish the outlines today,” Dean reminded and moved to grab fresh gloves as Cas shifted and turned to settle himself back stomach down and look back at the small tv.
“Family Business Tattoo Parlour, this is Dean.” There was something so comfortable about the tone of that voice over the phone; Castiel liked it immediately.
“I’ve not…” Castiel gasped, and then he couldn’t help a little squirm, mostly his hips. “It’s been quite a while.”
Cas hummed as he popped another fry in his mouth, then reached for the wine to wash it down. He was quiet for a bit and then he smiled. “I would like to see this progress into a sexual relationship,” he stated quietly and surely, and then he let his fingers trail over the glass slowly, thoughtfully.
“Cas?” Dean’s voice broke into his thoughts and Cas blinked somewhat, realizing he’d just let himself get lost in them. He hadn’t meant to. “You alright there? We can finish this later if it’s getting to be too much.” The note of concern in Dean’s voice surprised and warmed him more. It was almost like the man had figured him out without Cas telling him a thing one way or the other.
Setting to work, Castiel forgot he wasn’t alone. He focused on the task and happily collected the honey, filling jars and humming to himself.
Cas pulled his fingers out and grasped almost blindly for the dildo, getting just a bit of lubricant on it before he was pushing it in, thrusting it slow, letting himself really and genuinely feel the slide of it inside of his ass. He imagined that Dean was a bit bigger, knew that he would be hotter. He licked his lips now and then he rocked back against it some more.
“Not...exactly,” Cas grunted as he got himself out of the Impala and he moved around to join Dean and followed him into the motel. Dean turned all his charm on the girl behind the desk, and then looked almost amused when she looked between him and Cas with one eyebrow up before she asked if they needed one bed or two.
“Goddammit Sammy,” he shifted to roll the window down somewhat. “What?”
“Yes, but I needed you away from Sam,” Castiel told him quietly. He shifted a little and then shrugged out of Jimmy’s trenchcoat, laying it aside, with the suit coat following quickly.
“Of course, you want me to feed you, too. I’ll make pork chops for dinner.” Cas laughed, he didn’t really mind this at all, he’d just have to run to the store tomorrow to make sure he had enough groceries to last them both. Having Lucifer here meant his usual grocery run wouldn’t be enough. He let his mind wander to what was in his fridge, but he couldn’t help hoping the next week went quickly.
Deciding it wasn’t worth pointing out to Dean again that it was very hard for him to get drunk. Castiel did oblige his friend, drinking down a good portion of the fifth that had been handed to him. It warmed him even if it didn’t act the same, or as quickly as it did for Dean.
Castiel blinked slowly. “...I…”
“Gimme a sec, Feathers.” Dean was moving to protect the room. It was thoughtful, and Cas found waiting for him to finish well worth it, as Dean didn’t even hesitate to begin grooming him again, taking gentle care of the fallen feathers once more when he was done.
“Dean,” he grinned quietly, “Dean Winchester.” He then tipped his head a little bit, unable to resist the way he opened himself up, he very much wanted to just lean in and kiss Castiel. Dean felt the urge building inside his chest, and he didn’t want to ignore it. “And I’d really like to see you again Castiel, without the masks and the pressure of our brothers being in the room watching our every move.”
“That sounds fuckin perfect.”
“Molt? What the fuck does that mean? And why are you getting naked! Dude!”
“Absolutely not, especially if you keep the fabrics lighter and wear something to keep it separated from the fabric, and air it out when you have the chance, and of course you should treat it properly.” Dean’s smile was light and easy, comforting, “I would recommend sleeping on your stomach though, at least for a few days.”
He didn’t even hear the gasps around them, the sharp crap of someone dropping a glass but he didn’t flinch. He just stared up at Castiel, watching how his jaw worked, his eyes fluttering a few times. Castiel’s lips parted again, he licked them, clearly nervous and uncertain.
Castiel knew this was the part which would push their boundaries. There would be no ignoring how desperate Dean’s gentle touches would make him, and he would be too weak to fight it in a mental sense.
Castiel just didn’t know how to respond, his wings naturally puffed around Dean, he couldn’t help himself. He wanted so often to show him how the soft feathers responded to his presence but Dean didn’t see him like that, he could never have that. He felt strange, the way those green eyes, so bright and eager were boring into his own. He breathed slowly in and out, keeping himself calm.
His phone chirped almost at once with a text from Dean saying he was downstairs. Cas swallowed hard and then tapped out a reply before he moved to grab his jacket, just in case. His heart fluttered in his chest a bit and his stomach twisted. First dates were rare enough, and he really just hoped that this worked out. Especially because Dean was his tattoo artist. He didn’t want that to become awkward.
Castiel had never seen the familiar transform, and it didn’t talk. There was a strange scar running over its left shoulder, and it didn’t want to be touched.
“Uh…” Dean glanced at Cas  “Two…” he added quickly and quietly before he whipped his wallet out to pay.  Castiel just blinked silently at the young woman, in that way of his that Dean, well didn’t find quite so creepy any more. Though it could be unsettling at times, he’d gotten pretty used to it.
Dean was settling back slightly, more on his thighs than before. He coaxed him to sit up. Castiel found himself being stripped of his trench coat though it was awkward and didn’t do anything but fall into the bed under him. Dean’s hands were sliding to stroke his back, almost exactly where his wing joints rested. Castiel was curious, the way that he rested him, as if he knew they were there.
“So let’s see: Gabriel, Castiel, and the others are angelically named too?” Dean asked, his voice was entertained though, and there was nothing at all offending about the question. Castiel was impressed at the easy acceptance of such things, it made him happy too.
Green eyes were lazily trailing over him. “No, I don’t think you will.” He smirked and the finger slid all the way, making a gasp escape from Castiel’s throat. “Like it when I’m just a little rough, do you?”
“Hell yes,” was the soft reply and Dean moved carefully, the wings rustled in his ears as they shifted. It was so strange and wonderful at the same time. When they settled down, one of the shimmering warm wings draped over him. It felt so good, so comforting, Dean let himself curl into Cas’ arms.
“Dean, what if I wanted to see you before then? Not, as my tattoo artist?” Cas found himself saying, a flush rishing on his cheeks. He wasn’t generally this bold and it made him feel a little silly, but he wanted to ask, he needed to ask, right now.
“I’m a doctor,” the man depanned and then his lips curled upwards as Dean couldn’t help as he barked out a laugh of both surprise and delight. So the outfit was a bit just pulled out of the closet was it? He wasn’t going to complain.  “I don’t suppose you’re actually a cowboy?”
“Well then, I’d like to go to dinner with you on Saturday, say 6:30?” Castiel asked quickly now, hopeful as his heart started to thump a bit louder in his chest.
However this meant he was inside the Impala, with Castiel who was being oddly broody. They’d been silently in the car for hours, well, not completely silently. Dean had offered to allow Cas to pick the music, Sam would have been shocked to hear it and they’d been listening to the mixtape that he’d made for Cas pretty much over and over. Silly, but it didn’t seem worth it to change the tape.
“Nope. You mentioned others, though?” Dean’s voice was curious and easy going as he leaned in again. He moved a moment to get a piece of paper towel and lightly wiped at the part of Castiel’s back he’d been working on. It only took a moment and he was back to work.
“Well, good, then have a good time, you guys!” Sarah said eagerly now, moving away.
A week later Sam showed up on their doorstep, it was the soonest he could come from Palo Alto, demanding an explanation in person. Dean just shoved his ring in Sam’s face, the match sitting on Castiel’s own hand. He watched his brother’s eyes bug out in delight and shot a wink at Castiel, who just rolled his eyes and went back back to his translation work.
“We don’t have to do anything like that yet, if you’re not comfortable,” Dean assured him. His green eyes were soft and understanding.
“Between my shoulderblades, but not more than the midway point of my back?” Castiel cocked his head and looked interested. “Size does matter, I know. Would that be a large enough surface to make the details work out?”
“Awesome, I’ll call Sammy.” Dean was pulling away then and Castiel found it easy to just settle back on his own and he reached for his coffee mug again. His heart felt light, hopeful. Maybe it was time for him to find more than work, another safe place. Somewhere that he could put down real roots.
“Let me see the details.” Cas was up and invading his space in no time, stealing his phone, something that happened at least twice a week. One of only two people he allowed to do that without fear, the other being Dean’s little brother, Sam. Dean rolled his eyes at Castiel, but then watched as his friend quickly read over the email. “Of course, Dean, I’d love to go.”
“I’m afraid my studies keep me fairly busy,” Castiel mused quietly, but he gave her a soft smile. “But I am glad to attend this event with Dean tonight.”
“Do you want to just watch or is talking all right?” Dean asked quietly as he double checked the design he’d created with Castiel’s input, Castiel was comforted by that, sure that Dean didn’t want to mess up the beautiful tree Castiel had decided on.
Dean glanced over his shoulder and he smiled, his eyes flicking easily over Cas and making him feel a bit warm. “Hey, gorgeous, sleep well?” Dean’s tone was light, easy, and made Castiel almost instantly relax.
Castiel found it was something that made him feel relaxed. He didn’t know what Dean’s past was, exactly, with his other relationships, but he could tell the man wanted to make this work. And that was something he could work with, that he could enjoy.
“Sounds like he’s a terror, so living up to his name, then?” Dean asked as he worked a bit more. They easily fell into this conversation, sharing a few bits and pieces about themselves, making it quite a bonding experience. Castiel watched two episodes of the X-Files before Dean pulled back.
“This is amazing, Dean, seriously. Best burger I’ve ever had, hands down.” Cas let a smile danced on his lips, then he took up a potato wedge and he took a bite of that too. The seasoning was just right, and it was buttery and salty in a fun way. “You could have been a chef instead of a tattoo artist.”
“Good, Want that for ya Cas.” Dean announced and then he wiggled away in a moment and returned, handing Cas a full bottle of whisky and refilling his own glass, “drink up!”
The door locked behind him, Castiel found himself stepping out onto the sidewalk and faced with the soft rumble of the engine of a truly beautiful classic car. He wasn’t sure which make or model it was, but it clearly was treasured. Dean was leaning against the passenger side, wearing dark tight jeans, and a shirt not too different from Castiel’s own button down. Dean’s arms were settled lightly, half behind him against the car, green eyes dragging over Cas and causing heat to rise on his cheeks from the approving look he was getting.
He sighed and moved to gently dislodge Abbadon. A week wasn’t a lot, and it would give his tattoo some more time to heal. The curl of excitement in his stomach got a little more intense though, making him realize that falling asleep might not be easy. Maybe a hot shower would help, or a good jerk off session.
The man’s fingers gently found the sensitive glands and Dean carefully squeezed to coax extra oil out, the touch making Castiel's eyes flare wide and his wings stretch out, shoving something off the wall.
The plates were put in front of them and they both fell quiet as they took their first bites. And he’d be damned if Dean wasn’t right, it was an amazingly good burger. He sighed happily as he snagged up a little bit of bacon that had escaped his burger bun and landed on the plate. He let himself just chew slowly and lazily now as he watched Dean swallow some beer. “Thank you for this Dean…”
Castiel found himself watching those beautiful fingers again. He couldn’t help a little fascination with them, they were perfect. He could think of a number of other things he’d love those fingers to do besides create artwork out of his back. The thought was shoved away quickly enough though.
“Oh I, actually went to see about getting a tattoo.” Castiel looked at him and smiled now. It was easy to push the dark thoughts away. He knew who he was, and what he wanted, and he knew that Lucifer wouldn’t judge him for it.
“Well thank you, yes, I do think I will burn that one today,” Castiel agreed as he stepped over, and to his surprise when he reached out his hand the squirrel bounced up his arm and settled on his shoulder.
Castiel felt a tremor go through him. It seemed like Dean didn’t need a lot of effort to learn all of his sweet spots. The man seemed to know just how to touch him.  The way they came together thrilled Cas: the intensity, the way that Dean took control and drew him through each thrust. The way Dean made it feel like he was being taken care of completely was overwhelming. He got lost in the motions of the way they came together, only surfacing when Dean’s fingers curled around his cock and started to work him.
“You cook? I burn water,” Cas joked with a laugh. Yes, he had a few meals he could make consistently, but not many, and honestly he didn’t have much time to cook with how fixated he could get on work. “Well, I can make breakfast food and sandwiches well enough.” He ate a lot of take out, which lead to him doing a bit of running to counter it, but he didn’t mind really. Running cleared his mind completely.
“No. Is that where we’re going?” He looked curious. He knew of the place, knew it’s general location, but it wasn’t somewhere he’d ever gone himself.
“Yeah but you might not even be stickin around, You said it depended on work right?” Dean sighed a little. “How would I ever find you again?”
“Perhaps we could take a night off from family dinner?” Cas’s voice was low in his ear and Dean felt a shudder down his back.
Dean jumped off his arm when Castiel began to set up his supplies. He moved over to check on the hive, letting his magic tickle and soothe the bees. They knew the taste of his magic now, and had not stung him in several years. Yes, there would be a nice harvest today.
And then one from Dean. That was the one that had made his phone chime.
“Sounds pretty serious to me,” Dean countered playfully and his hands trailed just a little more. “I’m down.”
“Of course,” Castiel whispered, and warmth flooded through him: happiness that wasn’t just his own. Dean hadn’t just come here to be healed. He’d come to be home.
“Not at all,” Dean promised now. “Just a double cheeseburger with bacon and some good fries, as well as a tall glass of beer and a side whiskey.”
“Doctor Sexy?” Dean found himself saying in awe. “Though the hair….”
Dean had very nice fingers, he couldn’t help thinking again; ones that he could almost wish were actually touching him for other reasons. He tucked that thought away quickly once more. Even knowing the man was bisexual, this was still business. He moved to put the mirror down and sit on the edge of the station chair. “You clearly put a good deal of passion into your work,” he praised quietly, watching Dean’s reaction and- the way the man lit up at the soft praise.
“Mmm I think you could go just like this,” Dean rumbled against his mouth.
“I’d like to stay with you, if you don’t mind,” Dean said, quietly, as he eased himself back. The man was naked. A very nice naked. The scar from his squirrel body was broad over his shoulder, almost in the shape of a hand. “I’ve been looking for you a long time.”
The emoji made Cas chuckle but he hummed quietly now. //White or red?//
“Sounds like nothing has changed,” he said casually now.
//Dean.// The squirrel blinked a few times and was quiet. Dean: a simple name, and yet it seemed quite fitting for the little familiar. //I don’t have a witch.//
“Mmhmm, And I mean it, dress comfortable.” Dean winked at him and then looked at the door opening. “Hey Meg, I’ll be with you in a minute,” he called out. The girl who had just come in, well, woman, really was quite pretty, with a bit of a warm oval face, and dark curls falling around it too. She winked at Dean and then gave Castiel a once over that made the man flush some.
“I love to cook, though I don’t get to cook for other people that often anymore. I learned when Sam was still a growing little sapling,” Dean admitted as they drove along towards the Roadhouse.
“Dean, it’s just a chill little party. We want you to have a good time, you don’t need to sit around at home handing out candy.” Sam appeared in the doorway, he was dressed as Zorro, and Dean know that Eileen was dressed in a beautiful dress to match as Elena De La Vega. He rolled his eyes at his taller brother. “Look you get too drunk to drive we’ll make sure you and Baby make it home safe…”
“Fuck. That was…” He trailed off, then went still, not sure if he should still be calling Dean ‘sir’ or not. He realized they’d neglected to discus a signal for the scene to be finished.
“I got you, Cas.” Dean’s voice was low and the hand pulled away only to grasp at the thin boxer material covering his hips and pull.
Four years later, Dean found himself frowning at the usual invite to the holiday bash his company held. Sarah, his boss’ secretary had sent him a cute message, “make sure you bring that handsome boyfriend of yours!” on it. He drug a hand through his hair and shook his head slightly.
“Fuck, Cas. These are even more impressive than I thought in the barn.”
The sharp protest made Castiel freeze completely in his task, and then he cocked his head and stared at Dean.
With that Dean found himself leading Castiel to the room that he’d been given a card for. One of the various staff was able to override the electronic door locks for people and they were soon settled into their room, on the single king bed within, Cas pressed against his side.
“Yes, I trust you to know what you need to get through this molt,” Jimmy said firmly, and then he waved his hand. “I turned my body over to you, I became your vessel. Do what you need to and know that I understand.”
“Oh! I, I do.” A soft little nervous laugh left Cas and then he smiled at Dean. “I bet you get hit on all the time.”
It was a couple minutes before he got a reply. //Bottle of wine, and yourself. ;) //
He sighed quietly and then finished off the whiskey in the bottle that Dean had pushed on him, drinking it not because it tasted like anything but because Dean wanted him to. He did a good deal just for Dean and he knew it, his heart as it were was lost to this man.
Dean returned it just as softly, but with a promise of something more behind it, and Cas let himself melt, let himself savor the feeling again of Dean’s kisses, the soft rubbing of his beard against his face. A heated thrill went through him, going down his spine. He adjusted his head slightly to allow Dean to deepen the kiss further and he felt the man’s hand slide up his arm to hold the back of his head. It felt good, and he let himself just relax into it feeling the soft mental repose that came with giving his trust to another person.
Cas busied himself quickly with getting the corkscrew out and opening up the bottle of wine so it could breathe. He hummed and only half watched Dean as the man finished making up the last of their food, the burgers piled perfectly with cheese, lettuce, tomato, a sliver of avocado, and Dean had onion on his, he noticed quietly.
He moved to lead Cas over to Baby, who wasn’t far and the other man did pause to admire the car for a moment before they tumbled into the back seat. A little laughter, a soft grunt or two as they tried to get settled and Dean reached up to nudge at the mask covering Castiel’s face.
“Yeah, well, he’s taken,” Dean shot back, and that only served to make Castiel’s cheeks get even hotter, especially with the wickedly pleased look that crossed Meg’s face. She was clearly trouble.
“Yes, Michael, Lucifer, Samandriel.” Cas grinned as he rattled them off with ease, knowing some people always found it strange. Dean couldn’t seem to  help groaning softly at the mention of Lucifer—probably because of the unsurprising connotations. “And yes, Lucifer is a bit of a black sheep like myself. Worse, really. He likes to play things up, get Dad all excited that he’ll come back, and then disappoint him all over again.”
“You are so responsive, Castiel,” Dean murmured against his skin, his beard scratching in places. That was new. He’d had stubble against his skin, but never a beard, never like this. “I love it.”
Cas hummed quietly. Dean’s tone and the way he’d just been kissed told him that it was not a bad talk, and they should talk. They both had plenty that needed to be discussed if this relationship was going to continue the way it seemed to be. Castiel was hopeful. “Coffee?”
“Of course.” The reply was simple, soft. The angel seemed, twitchy? Maybe? Dean let his eyes narrow somewhat contemplatively.
“Not at all. Tell me about yourself, anything you like. Perhaps about your work?” Dean asked, just gently curious.
Green eyes widened slowly and then Dean drug a hand through his hair slowly and scratched a bit. “....Not really being yourself.” He said quietly, and saw how Castiel nodded his head. “Like the world is one giant masquerade of what, you want people to think of you, or what you need them to think of you.”
Cas flushed but then couldn’t stop a faint smile at the verbal reprimand. “Sir,” he quietly corrected himself now.
“I gotcha Cas,” Dean whispered. “I love you too...All of you.”
“In heaven, I played the role of soldier, and I was good at it. I was very good, had my own garrison,” Cas shifted a little “I always wanted to be one of the protectors though. And then I got the chance. I rescued you, and I learned more about people. However,I had to borrow a face to do so.”
“....You are beautiful. More so than I deserve,” he said quietly and then Dean shook his head and reached out to cup the other’s face. Studying it, the soft lines that that showed both joy and worry in turn.
It was possibly the most peaceful date he’d ever been on. Dean wasn’t pushing anything even though they’d briefly discussed sex, and that made Castiel feel more confident when he finally shifted to put his glass down and tipped his head to study Dean’s face, almost unsurprised when he found green eyes considering him. Cas leaned up to kiss him gently.
“Yes Dean?” He shifted and settled back easily against the cushions of their couch. Dean couldn’t help a little half smile at how easily Castiel fixed his focus onto him even when he’d been in the middle of translating some weird ancient text just a moment before. Meg, one of Cas’ friends, complained all the time that Castiel would ignore her for ten or fifteen minutes when she had a question for him and tried to get his attention.
Castiel didn’t see the squirrel watching all of this. He had no idea what the little creature was thinking. He then let his eyes open, breathing out slowly. Already he felt better.
“Break time. You should sit up for a minute. Wanna to take a look at the progress?”
Dean was still in his jeans, but the beautiful sleeves he’d seen before were on display, and much of his chest was inked, too. When the man turned to push his jeans down Cas found that his back was tattooed, too. It was beyond amazing to watch how the ink moved when his muscles shifted under his skin.
“I think I’d like that too Dean.” Castiel replied quietly and then, there it was, the man leaned up and took control of the tension.Their mouths met, electricity darting down Dean’s spine in delight. He found it more than easy to drop into the kiss, to enjoy it, the way that Castiel’s lips became a demanding pressure and took over leading the kiss deeper. Dean was pretty sure his cowboy hat was tipping off the back of his head, he didn’t care. There was a wolf whistle off to the side and the brunet thought nothing of raising his hand to flip off the offender.
“With pleasure.”
“And leave Baby here? Nah, It’s fine Cas.” Dean had already texted Sam that they’d be snowed in, and Sam had texted back he was snug at the bunker and safe, so be careful. “You wanna use your mojo to help me set all this stuff up.”
Three days later Dean teased Castiel into changing their Facebook statuses.
Ah, there he was.
He hadn’t meant to, but damned if Cas hadn’t crept into every corner of his life, taking up comfortable residence there. Dean couldn’t even imagine what life would be like without him.
One of his three elder brothers, Castiel had grown up somewhat terrorized by Lucifer. Gabriel’s pranks had been harmless but Lucifer had been slightly more vicious in his behaviors. Thankfully he seemed to have grown out of torturing his siblings and now a days though they got on well enough, something that Castiel was thankful for. He didn’t want to lose contact with his brother.
The way Dean kissed him now, knowing that sex was in the future was a little different, a little more passionate, and Cas found he loved it so much. He wanted to melt for him, to let Dean do whatever he wanted with him. He took a slow breath though, a careful one, and shifted to tip his head into the kiss as Dean’s tongue teased his mouth, coaxing a little groan out of him. The man’s arm was around his waist, hand splayed warmly against his back and he couldn’t stop rocking his hips forward, into Deans own. Electric delight raced up his spine at feeling their cocks brush, rubbing together.
“Well, then, I would like you Dean to do the piece. I had hoped you could fit me in. I’m not that worried about cost, but the time to get it done might take a little more effort, right? I understand, since it wouldn’t be a small piece…” Castiel found himself trailing off, watching how Dean worked as the man started to take his rough sketch and transform it into a beautiful tree, with the names he already had in place, and showing that it clearly had spots for more to be added. The branches, and the way the names were included looked very natural, like they were intended to be part of the tree all along. Even the empty spots didn’t really look empty.
“I do, but I can plan the date.” Castiel found his lips were spread in a wide smile now. “I was trying to ask you out.”
He was going to need to run into town; they didn’t have any tomato sauce. He hummed under his breath and checked the time. Yeah, sauce, some pie. He didn’t have time to make his own pie, not if he wanted to spend actual time with Cas today, but…
“I’m hoping to expand in the next year. If things keep working out well,” the artist added quietly now.
The week had gone even more quickly than he could have expected, and Thursday found Castiel striding up to the front door of Family Business Tattoo in a pair of comfortable jeans and a loose button down, the sleeves rolled up to show off his forearms. He was mostly relaxed and finding many of his lingering worries from a week ago had lifted. Dean had been very responsive in his emails and they’d settled on a final form of the tattoo just the night before.
“So, sir, what would you like to do?”
//I’ll scare it off!// Dean’s reply was sharp, and the squirrel darted towards the darkness. Castiel startled, but dropped the jar, ignoring the honey in favor of raising his hands into motion. He started to chant in Latin, a simple protection spell. He cast it as fast as he could, as Dean slammed into the darkness.
Maybe he could teach Cas how to use the Bunker’s old laundry machine later. Right now, he wanted to get very intimately reunited with some feathers.
“I wouldn’t mind going at all, Dean. If it’s easier for people to think we’re dating…” Castiel let his shoulder shrug and Dean just laughed softly.
“Yes, Dean.” He lifted his eyes to consider the other man. It wouldn’t be the easiest thing he had ever done, but the artist deserved to know everything if they were going to continue the intimate, and more structured side of their growing relationship.
Castiel breathed out quietly and then he set the candle gently in a holder and put it next to the bowl of water. Then he scooped the little rose quartz stone into his hand and closed his eyes. He focused on himself, breathing slowly and carefully, and drew all of the negative sensations into the stone. He could feel them shift over his skin, curling slowly into the confined form of the quartz. In a few minutes it was all gathered, and he placed the quartz down gently to mix some salt into the bowl. nce that was done he placed the stone into the bowl, then held one hand over it. Castiel’s eyes closed again as he started to murmur softly, a blessing of positivity over the bowl, allowing the gentle warmth of the spell to tickle his palm and spark in the quartz.
It wasn’t until the sixth day that Dean asked about the oil glands, which now had started to overflow, ready to properly coat new feathers and create a protective layer over them. “So, uh, you ready for me to use that stuff?”
“My middle brother, well, the one just older than me, is a lawyer, very successful,” Cas said quietly. A number of people actually knew who Gabe was, and if the brother was a lawyer he suspected Dean could connect the dots
“Precisely.” Cas rolled his shoulder a moment, like he had a weight there he couldn’t shake off. Dean was a little concerned.
Castiel smiled quietly at the kindness of it. This was something that would take time, Dean was clearly caring about his customers comfort.
“...I think I’m done for now.” Dean said quietly a little while later. “What are we going to do with the feathers?”
“Oh, relax. I won’t hit on you.” Gabriel winked at him.
“What, not staying with Gabriel and Kali?” Dean asked, though charmed by the thoughtfulness of not wanting to just drag him off and have awkward drunk sex. His mind was spinning and it felt good, warm. He shifted to adjust his hat with his hand quickly.
Before he knew it they were pulling into the parking lot of the Roadhouse, which looked just as rundown as he had recalled from driving by it. There were plenty of cars in the lot, though, so he assumed that the appearance was part of the aesthetic of the place. He slid out of the car before Dean could come around to his side but he smiled when the man offered his hand and he accepted, fingers gently tangling with Dean’s. He left his jacket over the back of the seat. He clearly didn’t need it, already feeling warm and comfortable with all of this.
“I think that’s wise.”
Castiel could feel the flush crawling onto his cheeks but he couldn’t stop smiling as he nodded. “Thank you so much, Dean.”
“I love you Cas” Dean’s voice was rough as their lips shifted, parted, “I love you so much and I just had to tell you once.”
“All right,” he agreed quietly. “Do you work tomorrow?”
He sighed quietly as his fingers curled lazily around his cock and he gave a couple brief tugs, teasing himself, not ashamed that the thoughts were leading to masturbation. Everything he could need was in the stand next to his bed so he simply tugged the drawer open and got out a half empty lube bottle, then with some deliberation a dildo. Not his big one, no, just one of the smaller ones. He just wanted stimulation tonight, enough to relax himself.
Cas flushed easily at that teasing but he couldn’t stop a grin spreading across his lips. He let his foot easily tap against Dean’s though under the table, relaxed and comfortable with all of it.
“So how were they?” he asked, allowing his curiosity to show. He hadn’t been home in close to a year himself.
“FUCK, CAS,” Dean jerked backwards somewhat as Castiel appeared in the same room as the man. He glanced around the cheap motel room briefly. Clearly Sam Winchester was staying here as well. That wouldn’t do in the slightest; he could not trust the boy with the demon blood.
He would prefer to learn more about what this was between him and Dean, and look to the future.
Cas snorted and then he shifted to tug the duvet up over them some. “Well, then I better help keep you warm,” he teased in return, his mouth found Dean’s again.
In fact, he noticed only because of the way that Dean curled them now that three were inside of him. Cas’s lips parted and he started to pant. He didn’t know if he was allowed to come, and he wasn’t sure that he was about to, but fucking hell he wanted to. However, before he could voice this Dean was pulling off of his cock again, this time with a sinful slurp that made him shiver.
“She might have,” Dean chuckled and shortly they settled to work, Dean putting things out and letting Cas fuss until he was happy. It wasn’t really a nest, a pillow pile and blankets in a bit of a horseshoe shape. He didn’t want Dean to struggle to get out of bed to go to the bathroom or anything, but once it was assembled. High enough that when they decided to lay down they couldn’t see over it, Castiel was satisfied, not perfectly happy. It didn’t smell like his bed nest at home (which had a couple pilfered shirts of Deans and one of Sams under the pillow, the family scent was important) but it was comfortable, and Dean was here next to him, delighted by all of this.
For several minutes the sound of Dean humming happily over his food and the tv were the only sounds in the room. The tv was playing some movie that Dean seemed to be enjoying greatly. The man shifted quietly to pour more whiskey, and Castiel was confused to find himself offered a cup, “Dean?”
This tattoo would be just the next step, it was more than enough of a way to reclaim control of himself, it was something he very much felt he needed. It would be a new part of himself, a step away from Naomi, a step into owning his own mind and body again and being fully in control.
Dean's hands were on his thighs coaxing him to slide them up with his feet flat on the bed, and the delicious warmth of Dean between them. Cas heard the sound of a condom crinkling and he couldn’t stop a smile. So thoughtful; they hadn’t a chance to talk about this and Dean wasn’t even hesitating to make sure they used it. He felt the heat shift and then Dean was leaning over him and he wanted so badly to grab his shoulders.
The hand on his shoulder startled him. Castiel whipped around – only to find familiar green eyes on a very human face. A handsome, human face. A human face that was leaning into his own and soft lips that brushed against his.
He didn’t miss Father, or Michael. Their father lead his church with an iron fist. They’d all been raised in it, their names all reflected it. Castiel was the only one who actively still practiced their father’s religion since leaving the nest. He attended mass about once a week at a church downtown, and he never missed the big holidays.
“I don’t want to rush this, gorgeous,” he murmured and then he stretched and leaned down to coax Castiel up to his feet now, their lips meeting easily now, deeply.
“Yes, good to meet you,” Dean grinned at him easily and moved to stand. “Come on over to my chair. Do you have an idea of what you want? Size, style?” he asked as he led Cas the short distance to the first of the stations. “Have you ever had a tattoo before?”
Within a moment they were on the walk up to the main door to his building and Castiel found himself cuddling into Dean’s side again, enjoying the warmth. Dean stopped them at the door before Castiel could unlock it and he pulled Cas into another kiss, slow, deep, promising. Cas easily leaned up into it, savoring every sweet moment. Dean was breaking it slowly and stepping back far too quickly though.
“Dean…”
“Not even a one night?” Dean asked thoughtfully. His mouth moved down, his beard teasing his skin further and then there was a soft breath against his nipple and he groaned softly at it.
“Is it selfish of me that I want our second date to be sooner rather than later?” Cas found himself asking quietly, just over the sound of the classic rock playing softly on the radio. Dean glanced at him, his green eyes sparking with something, pleasure he was fairly sure.
For a few minutes there was the sound of water and dishes clicking against each other, but when Dean was done they both settled onto the sofa in the living room, mugs on the table. Cas was unashamed as he scooped up a pillow and held it to his stomach, a bit of a comfort object in a way. He could fully sense the way Dean was considering his posture.
“In my boxers and a t-shirt?’ He laughed. “I think your brother would have to defend me for public indecency.”
It only took a few moments and they scheduled his next appointment for the Thursday three weeks from now, which would hopefully give the skin of his back enough time to heal from the linework.
“Sounds reasonable.” Cas finished his glass of wine slowly now. “So, did you make me wait a week so my back was healed enough for sex?” he asked slowly, cheeks a little pink with this.
Dean’s ears rang a little, his eyes widening further. He found himself frantically looking the angel’s face over. But there was no hint, not even a little one that anything was a lie. That Cas was anything but serious. “Cas….”
“Hey there, Dean,” the woman greeted as she came up to their booth, having come around the bar to join them. “Who is this?”
“Uh, Ri..right.” Dean stepped back several steps, all at once, placing himself against the wall. “I should let Sam know I’m okay.”
“Sure. You wanna plan the next one?” Dean offered easily. It almost felt like a test but Castiel found himself shaking his head now, his eyes studying the slightly taller man’s face quietly.
“I can hardly cook,” he found himself admitting now. “I’m usually too tired or busy to consider it and somehow I never really learned it.”
“Yup, best damn burgers in Lawrence.” Dean flashed him a broad grin as he pulled out onto the road.
Somehow that sent a sense of utter relief through Cas and a smile tugged his lips up as he moved to stand. “Sounds perfect.”
“I’ll be right out!” The man’s voice floated from the back room.
“Well, don’t you dress down nice.”
“How long? Since a lover? Since a male lover?” Dean asked softly, lips against his pectoral. Cas’s eyes fluttered closed as he tried to sort it out. “I left Naomi a year ago,” he mumbled quietly now. “I...I haven't had a male lover in at least two and a half years,” he admitted softly.
Dean let the head of his cock press against his hole and Cas whimpered a little, his other hand sliding over Dean’s back, feeling the strength of the muscles under his skin as the man held himself up, and slowly, carefully, pushed into him, spreading him open on his cock. A ragged moan left him at the feeling; it was overwhelmingly good and Cas didn’t want to miss a second.
He spotted Gabriel with Kali, dressed up as Gomez and Morticia and they were certainly playing up their parts, the shorter man who worked with Sam was absolutely spoiling his wife rotten. The gorgeous Kali pulled off the outfit perfectly too, looking like she was painted into the dress, she seemed very pleased with Gabriel’s attention. Dean allowed himself a moment to admire how they looked, not too long though because he was not in the mood to get in the middle of that sandwich, no matter how fun it might promise to be. Ellen was dressed up as Sarah Conner, a reference Dean very much appreciated and got a kick out of. His eyes were drifting on easily to see what else he could notice.
The instant concern on the man’s face was surprising. Castiel found himself thrown off by it. Humans were so strange, so unique, and their capacity to care was admirable. He was starting to understand, at least a little, why their father loved them so.
Warm arms wrapped around his waist and soft lips against his neck made him pause. “Well hello, you.”
“Yes, do you think I followed you across the country because I just liked the way you cook?” Castiel asked now, and then he was the one leaning up and their lips met quickly, warm and tender. Dean sank into it, kissing him back deeply, ignoring the swirling congratulations around them in favor of focusing on his first kiss with Cas– perhaps the most important kiss he’d ever had in his life. It lingered between them, though he pulled back slowly after several long moments,  his fingers still holding Castiel’s face. He studied his fiancé, his best friend turned almost husband in an instant.
“I love you, you idiot,” Castiel’s voice was soft and comforting.
“I’m proud of you, Cassie.” His older brother’s words were comforting, they added a layer to his happiness.
“Yeah, of course, man. Alright. So you need the loose feathers removed? Looks like there's already a bit of a mess there…”
“I don’t mind, Cas.” Dean didn’t blame him for not remembering half the staff at the company. Sometimes Dean himself struggled to keep track of them all. They moved inside, someone taking their coats in exchange for a check ticket, and Dean was given a key card with a room number and wifi code scribbled on the envelope for later. With that taken care of, they shortly had drinks in hand and were stepping into the main ballroom of the party.
“Mrrwow?” Abaddon’s soft curious noise came as he opened the door. Cas chuckled softly at that.
“Oh, X-Files, please,” he said when he spotted it. Dean made a noise of approval and turned it on for him now. Cas found himself already relaxing as the man moved behind him. He could hear him snap on a pair of sterile gloves and then there was a cool wetness as his back was cleaned off with disinfectant solution. It was a few moments and some clicking and snapping around before he heard the small motor of the gun start up.
Cas wasn’t even a little bit surprised or upset by that. He chuckled softly at the statement. “I’m not, but I like certain places. Gabriel is the bar addict.” Cas shrugged a little and then considered Dean, studying his face with sharp blue eyes for a moment. “You’ve heard of the Red Room?” he asked.
“Mm, Netflix might be nice.” Castiel moved to settle himself down and he let his eyes half close and he watched as Dean flicked the TV on and how the man tapped around to get on the app.
Not even fifteen minutes later Dean found himself in the roadhouse, two shots in, with a half drunk beer in his hand and he was watching as Ash was making a rather significant attempt to get Jo to dance with him. She had her stilettos in hand, having already given up on them. When he’d arrived Dean had known she would give up on the lovely heels that were part of her Marylin Monroe outfit. Ash had dressed up as Rambo, which made for a very amusing combination as they drifted closer together. He found his eyes floating around the room, easily taking in all of the various costumes featured in the party being hosted here. He found himself enjoying how everyone was really into dressing for the party. Each of their outfits were thoughtful, reflecting the person in them, and everyone had an eye mask, while most of their masks didn’t actually hide their identity, some did. It all went along with the demand that this be a “masquerade.”
“Sir, he replied softly, breathing out slowly.
Cas was kissing him back, warm hands were cupping his face and tipping his head up and warmth surrounded him almost at once as a knee pressed into the edge of the bed, depressing the mattress. Dean’s lips parted easily and he responded eagerly to the kiss. The warmth that he was feeling seemed to pull him closer. It wasn’t Castiel’s arms. He broke the kiss and his eyes opened, when had he closed them. “Cas….”
“Oh fuck….” His breath caught raggedly. “D..Dean,” he moaned.
“That’s wonderful.” Castiel wondered briefly if that meant they had a fairly good relationship, though it was clearly better than what he had with his own father. “Your father live around here, too?”
He’d convinced Castiel to share the bottle with him, and afterward you rarely saw Dean Winchester without the awkward, trench coat clad Castiel Novak at any parties or social events that the taller green-eyed man attended. Dean never explained to anyone what had changed, but that night he’d seen a side to Castiel that he’d found fun, and worth being real friends with.
“Oh, yes, yes, please D...Sir, please do it.”
Castiel pulled into the parking lot just before 2pm, seeing the modest but clear sign for the tattoo parlour that matched the script on the business card. It was welcoming and clean, but not too new. He’d looked up the place once more online this morning, so he had an idea of which of the artists was Dean, the one he’d spoken to on the phone.
“Don’t you have a lawyer brother who can do the same?” Dean teased back and kissed him again. Cas melted against his chest and just enjoyed the kissing, the warmth of it, the ease. Like they’d always been meant to do this.
It took a few moments, Cas moving to shed his suit coat, and  shirt as well as his coat had been, though shirt, jacket and tie landed in the nest on top of the trenchcoat in the bed. He settled, arms on the back of a chair and breathed in and out a few times before allowing his wings to pop into existence, they shook and fluttered slightly as he got them unfurled, but made sure they were small enough for the space they were in. They still took up a lot of space. Dean was very quiet for a moment or two.
“Uh, how do you spell that? The, uh, Cas..tiel? part?” It was a said a little hesitantly, like he wasn’t sure he was saying it right.
“Cas...”
Cas blushed a little at that but then he nodded politely. “I am not a switch, I do prefer being submissive,” he replied quietly, watching Dean’s expression. He could see a flicker of delight there. “However, my last serious relationship was... not healthy. The domme I was involved with abused my trust.”
//Just fine. Your magic made it super easy!// Dean went up on his back legs and considered Castiel. //It felt like coming home….//
“It is, he and mother though were very fond of naming their children after angels.” He shrugged his shoulder briefly as he said this, Dean was curious what the rest of his siblings were named, but Cas moved the conversation on, “I don’t mind so much, so what’s your name Cowboy?”
“Not at all Cas.” He winked and then he moved to focus on the road, pulling out of the lot to head back towards Castiel’s apartment complex easily.
The second day continued much like the first, and three days later found him well into molt, and the new feathers starting to grow in. His wings trembled at the way Dean worked the sensitive shafts delicately and Castiel did his best to control the more human physical reactions he was having to the touches. If Dean noticed how often Castiel’s vessel was hard after a grooming, he said nothing.
Castiel figured he’d always be alone. Many witches found companions, familiars, along their way, but usually early. He’d been practicing for years though, years and years by himself. He’d tried to attract a familiar, everyone did, especially when their magic first blossomed.
Good. Castiel thought to himself as he moved to put the pizza down. “Here you go,” he said with a small smile for the human who reached for it at once.
“Awful. Father is still ragging on about the usual every Sunday, Mother is still patiently suffering it, though she did ask after you and Gabriel. I did try to steal Saman away this time, but he’s too terrified.” Lucifer shrugged and looked back at his laptop.
“Nope! We are building a nest, we’ve got all the best materials and it’ll be warmer if the power does go out from all this snow outside.” Dean waved a hand as he spoke and unfolded himself, sliding up off of his side of the bed and wandering over to the pile of blankets and pillows on the other bed. “We should put the beds together too, more space that way.”
“Oh, you know. Dad being on my nerves and all that, and Michael was being all holier than thou.” Lucifer looked up from his laptop and grinned at him, his blue eyes bright and playful. They were a lighter color than Castiel’s own eyes.
The name ripped from his lips as he felt the spasm of pleasure he couldn’t hold back. Dazed, overwhelmed, he found himself slumping within moments, panting. Dean seemed happy, almost? It was confusing, the sensations radiating off the man as he felt him swallow again, and then slowly start to pull off. The coolness of the air on his spit slicked cock sliding from Dean’s lips felt strange.
Castiel couldn’t help a smile on his lips and he moved to slide in now, looking around the clearly very well kept car. It was beautiful. He smiled as Dean slid into the driver’s side. “This car is beautiful, and in excellent condition.”
“Forgive me, but you don’t seem like the bar type. Well, at least not the sort I go to,” Dean said.
“Castiel Novak,” he replied quietly.
It only took a moment for Dean to comply, dragging a chair over closer, and Castiel moved to settle, shifting and stretching his wings out carefully. He’d been right about the size of the room—it was only just big enough. He was torn from his thoughts, though, at the slight brush of fingers against the feathers.
Dean looked mildly upset and Cas found himself swallowing some. He shifted and grabbed the other man’s hands. “I’m okay now,” he said firmly, trying to catch those beautiful green eyes. He wasn’t going to let Dean think he was damaged because he wasn’t.
“You meet my brother, and his girl, Jess.” Dean grinned at him looking excited. “I’d like to do that soon, if you feel up to it.”
“Please,” Castiel’s murmured word was like a little prayer and Dean found himself brushing fingers gently against the shimmering light, getting just the softest feeling of feathers against his skin. It was perfect, amazing. It made him feel so good, made him want to sink into them and curl to him. “Dean…..”
Dean seemed obliged and followed him into the swirl of pleasure, grunting against his skin as he came.
“Cas, are you sure you’re ready to tell me?”
“Fuck, Cas….” Dean breathed out and then nodded jerkily. He knew that look. Their reunion hadn’t been easy, but one kiss had been all it took, just like a fairytale, and now he got to give in to the urge to go to his knees for Cas any time he wanted. He was eager to let the Angel bend him over the counter, over the bed, one time (so far) over the hood of Baby. That had been fun. However right now the Angel seemed more interested in his pleasure, as Cas was already moving to sink to his own knees and pull at Dean’s pants. “Cas, bring your wings out,” he pleaded.
Being safe and secure and comfortable enough to nest was a luxury that angels hadn’t had in thousands of years, and Castiel only recently had started to feel he could have, maybe with the Winchesters.
Cas couldn't help wondering, absently, how it would feel without the condom. He also was starting to drift down and could feel the mess on his own stomach, the way Dean was already murmuring softly in his ear, his fingers moving to grab something that was used to mop up the worst of the mess.
Within minutes he had a familiar and satisfactory ache in his jaw. He groaned around him and then he sucked a little harder. He wanted to know what it felt like, he wanted to make Dean come, to taste him. Slowly he sensed the shift under Dean’s skin, the slight roll of his hips that indicated the man was more than willing to participate more actively. It thrilled him, since Cas did like to have his face fucked.
In his head Dean whispered encouraging to him as he opened him up, using one finger, taking his time, coaxing him into more. His breath caught as he started to edge in the second finger now, adjusting the arm he was leaning on to get a bit better angle for his body as he worked the fingers a bit deeper, both of them at once, pressing carefully. A groan escaped Castiel quietly as he worked them deeper.
“Ah, yes, I’d like to schedule a consultation for a tattoo?” Castiel was pretty sure that was the terminology, what he needed to do first. He hoped,faintly, that they would be able to schedule it soon, before he lost his nerve.
Lucifer had been the first of them to take off out of the nest, so to speak, building a life for himself that showed there was more than their religion to make the world go around. And though Lucifer returned home and played nice from time to time, he was not involved in entirely legal things and everyone knew it. It made their mother worry, though she tried not to, she was a kind soul.
Castiel found himself licking his lips a little. A flutter of hopefulness rising in his chest.
“Someone likes his food,” Castiel laughed softly but he also sighed contently and found himself leaning back in the booth. Dean was just as easy to talk to now and he liked this a good deal, just chatting with him, getting to know him.
Cas let himself just smile. It was polite but the note told him it wasn’t simply politeness that had him asking. “I grew up in a very unique and religious environment, and in some ways this is why I went into teaching it. But it’s also my way of escaping parts of my childhood.” He could already tell it was easy to talk to Dean,  which he hoped was a good thing. “My father did not take my sexuality well.”
He tried not to think about what his father would say, about how he would disapprove and likely rail against it if he ever found out. It didn't matter. He wasn’t going back home for anything more than a visit ever. He took a slow breath, and nodded. “This sounds very, very possible.”
“Uh, yeah. He does.” Dean managed a little half smile. Okay, not a perfect relationship. Castiel didn’t want to push; he recalled Dean’s admission that his father wasn’t comfortable with his bisexuallity. He knew pressing could ruin things, and they’d only just started. “So, Cas, you ever been to the Roadhouse?”
Castiel eagerly melted into the kiss, tipping his head into Dean’s space with ease, sinking against his firm body. He was currently pleased the man had already picked up on his submissive tendencies, but Dean wasn’t trying to dominate the kiss, or take more control than this. It was gentle and easy and Castiel wanted more, so much more.
“So, who is my guest?” he called out. The cat not coming could only mean that one of his brothers was here. They were the only ones that Abbadon ignored him for. He was rather banking on it being Lucifer.
“Offer to go to my hotel is still open, we can get an uber…” The Castiel murmured, his kiss reddened lips turned up in a playful smirk, he was already reaching for his mobile as if he expected Dean’s agreement.
Oh, Cas sometimes went back to visit, for Mother’s sake, but it was rare. Any time he did turned into a time for their father to rail about homosexuality and the sins of the flesh. That had been the final straw, why Cas had left. He knew he would never be the straight and perfect son that their father wanted.
“Well, why don’t you tell me, and I’ll give you a sense of if it’s something I would also enjoy,” he found himself saying honestly. He felt a tickle along his spine, the urge to make Dean happy. He knew better, though. He would listen to the other man first. If there was even one thing that made him feel uncomfortable he would end this, he was not going to let himself get hurt again.
“No,” he groaned and then he shifted a little. “I avoided anything after Naomi… till… now, oh fuck!” He hadn’t expected the fingers around his cock at the same time Dean closed his lips around his nipple and suckled. It was like an electric shock through him, his fingers digging automatically into the fabric underneath them. He’d been relatively relaxed before this, but now. “D..Dean…”
There was no other word for what it was. It seemed to be formless and yet solid all at once. Dean rolled with it, and when the protection spell hit him, suddenly Castiel felt a link – it was able to feed his own magic into the familiar.
It wasn’t as dizzying as he knew he could make himself, but damn if it didn’t still feel good. Cas caught his breath slowly and then groaned as he tugged the dildo out. It took him a few moments longer to move to clean up, taking care of his dildo, tugging the soiled bedding off the bed and replacing it with clean linens.
“Hello, Castiel.” Dean’s voice rumbled from a throat that sounded somewhat underused.
Honestly? Dean wasn’t going to complain. This was the best Christmas Party ever.
He knew a number of men were switches, but he was much more comfortable taking direction than giving it, he always had been. The closest thing to being in charge he was used to doing was getting himself out of his family home. He was thankful, though, that Dean didn’t seem phased, worried, or even a bit put off by his questioning, or by how quickly he gave in to the man’s lead.
The inside of the Roadhouse was much more bar like than the outside. Warm light, soft noise, the smell of beer and deep fried food hit his nose. Castiel let it twitch a bit at the smell. A handsome blond woman was behind the bar and gave Dean a familiar wave that he returned, and then the brunet was leading him down to a booth, only letting go of his hand so that they could slide in across from each other.
When he returned an hour later, hands full of bags, he found that Dean had brought in all the emergency items from the car, there were extra motel blankets and pillows piled on one of the beds and Dean was sprawled on the other with the tv on. “About time blue eyes,” Dean drawled as he rolled to get up and take some of the bags.
Castiel shifted automatically, lifting up to allow Dean to pull it down to be bared before this human. Part of him was surprised that Dean found this form at all appealing, though it tickled the back of his head. Of course, he knew the Righteous Man’s type, and he did fit it well. He wondered absently if that had played into his choice to contact Jimmy Novak in the first place.
“I need you to come with me. Now,” Castiel said firmly as he stared intently at the human. He hoped that Dean would understand and just come, but of course that was hoping for too much.
“Remember, no glove, no love.” Gabriel winked at him and Castiel rolled his eyes even as the call ended.
“What sort of queer man are you!” Dean teased playfully.
Dean found himself slipping off to the bathroom, desperately needing a moment to himself. He was beginning to realize what had happened here. “You went and fell in love with him,” he muttered to himself as he quickly washed his face off and then looked at himself in the mirror. He sucked in a deep breath.
Cas smiled quietly before moving over to pour himself a cup and fix it it up a little with some milk from the fridge and a dollop of honey he was pleased to see sitting on the counter. Dean gave him a curious look and he shrugged.
Normally, Dean is much better prepared for these things. He checks the weather, makes sure they have all supplies and are ready to be in before extremely bad weather strikes. However, it seemed this day, that had started out shiny and clear, was now threatening to snow them in unexpectedly.
“So stop.” The hunter shrugged quietly. He wanted Castiel happy. He wanted him to feel at home, to stay. To Stay with him. It was funny how he didn’t flinch at the idea of any more. Things had changed too much for Dean to hide it, not that he’d straight out said it.
“A few years ago, I met Naomi at a private function. She donated money to our department. I had just been granted my professorship and was getting settled out in the world. Before her, I’d only flirted with the idea of anything related to a dom and sub relationship. I can’t honestly recall how she found out that I was submissive; it was perhaps as simple as something I said. You picked up on it that after all.”
“I’ve noticed you’re naturally quite dominant, and so far none of that has been uncomfortable for me,” Castiel explained and then he smiled a little bit. “My Safeword is Pancakes,” he said simply now, a smile touching his lips. “I am willing to negotiate any other signals in case of being gagged.”
He just couldn’t help his own laugh at that, relaxing more now and then he nodded. “I’m sure,” he agreed now. “Anyway, he promised me an amazing burger.”
He paused to hang up his trench coat, smoothing the fabric gently with his hand, and then leaned down to remove his shoes to leave them neatly on the shoe rack next to his trainers and Lucifer’s fancy leather boots. He rolled his eyes at the boots and straightened, padding sock footed into the next room, loosening his tie and chuckling over the sight of the blond sprawled out on his couch.
