The thought felt like an extra stab to his heart, which he really didn’t need anymore of. Being mindful of the shattered glass and spilled alcohol on the floor he lifted himself up out of bed and made his way downstairs to the kitchen.
exactly he was there. He felt a shiver go through his spine as he remembered the events that had transpired. The blowtorch, the knife, and oh god, the blowjob. He could feel bile rising in his throat, which in turn reminded him of Moriarty’s cum sliding down his throat and he had to stop thinking about this before he actually vomited. He needed to distract himself from his own thoughts and memories, his Mind Palace was currently in shambles and for once he found himself running away from his own mind instead of seeking refuge in it. He couldn’t yet open his eyes however, his whole body felt sluggish and slow including his eyelids so he put his focus on his other four senses to try and gauge what was happening around him.
shady.” John insists. He remembered thinking the same thing after he first met Sherlock. Between knowing everything about him and his older brother kidnapping him off the street he was looking mighty suspicious. The drugs bust, murder case, and history with drugs didn’t help put him in a more flattering light either. Yet John hadn’t been deterred by any of it.
did it to you. He might not have gotten his hands dirty but you were backed into a corner, and that’s partly my fault.” Sherlock felt his eyebrows crinkle up in confusion. He didn’t have a clue what Lestrade was talking about. He had been prepared for the DI to blame him. To be angry and disgusted. To say he would never look at him the same. The last thing he expected was for Lestrade to blame
It felt wrong somehow. Like he was tainting Sherlock’s memory in a way, but did it really have to mean that? Maybe this was a coping mechanism. A way of… working through his feelings. Maybe he could just rub a few out thinking of Sherlock and then he’d… what? Be able to move on? To forget about his feelings for his friend? To let go?
He missed the music Sherlock used to make, missed the flat being flooded with Beethoven and Bach and sometimes even Sherlock’s own compositions. He wished he could tell him all of that now. Wished he could tell him how much he would give (everything) just to hear him play one more time. Just to see him pacing around the flat complaining about boredom even though he had just solved a case.
“Hm? Yeah, fine,” he grabbed her phone and typed in his name and number trying to ignore the pain that resounded in his chest every time he looked at the pink. After a few moments of silent typing they both handed each other’s phones back and smiled. Hers was beautiful and bright, naturally lighting up her face and making it seem as if she were radiating happiness, his was tight and forced, filled with guilt and self-loathing and empty promises.
All at once the thoughts come shooting back to him. His own mind is under enemy fire, but there’s nothing he can do because he
On the way home he considers stopping off at his and Sherlock’s favourite Thai place on the way to Baker Street. He decides in favour of takeaway and ends up ordering his favourite of green curry and spring rolls but also finds himself asking for mango curry and hot and sour soup. He hates mango curry and hot and sour soup but it had been Sherlock’s favourite so he had ordered it on impulse. He decides not to correct his order. Sherlock’s smell is practically non-existent in Baker Street now and John thinks that this will at least make Sherlock’s presence cling a bit more to the flat.
In retrospect it was obvious how he felt about Sherlock. He should’ve realized it the first day they met when John hadn’t been able to tear his eyes away from his lips. After they had gone to dinner and John hadn’t been able to resist flirting with him. After they had raced around London only to get back to Baker Street, laughter and breathless words passed between each other until Angelo came with his ruddy cane. Sherlock had cured his depression and his limp in a single evening. Of
After ten minutes of John talking to Mycroft and assuring him that he would be there to take care of Sherlock as long as need be the army doctor hung up and turned to Sherlock with a grin.
“That sounds great. Just text me later on and we can plan it. You can choose the spot next time.” John nods, a dopey, happy smile on his face. “I really ought to go. I have an early class tomorrow and I don’t want to be sleeping through it.” She explains with a happy chuckle. They reluctantly say goodbye. He offers to walk her home, it is dark and it’s London after all, but she insists that she lives close by and it’s unnecessary. Before she finally turns to leave she looks at him again, her eyes twinkling with the moonlight and mischief. Before he knows it she’s leaning towards him and pressing a gentle kiss on his cheek. It’s soft and warm and feels like comfort.
“Sherlock, listen, I cannot even imagine what that must have been like to do. I, God, I don’t think I could’ve done that. What you did. You were incredibly selfless, and yes,
Sherlock’s grip tightened around the handle of the knife as he filed away all this information. His eyes widened and flickered over to Anderson who looked paler than some of the corpses Sherlock had seen and seemed to be on the verge of fainting. In the background he vaguely registered John thrashing around again, yelling through his gag and rocking his chair, the soldier in him trying to get control of the situation and the doctor in him trying to stop what he knew was about to happen. A couple of cuts wouldn’t be too bad, a bit painful sure, but nothing Sherlock hadn’t dealt with before. Although he had a feeling the game was only going to get worse as it went on.
“You’re awake.” He repeated, practically a whisper. “Thank God. We were all worried. Even Anderson and Donovan believe it or not, it was actually a tad creepy. Think it was better when they were pricks. How do you feel? Any pain? Dizziness? Nausea?” Sherlock found himself overwhelmed by the influx of words coming out of John’s mouth and yet none of them hinted at moving out.
He had always known Sherlock had suicidal tendencies, it was something that was hard to miss with the way the man would throw himself into harm's way without a second thought but John had always assumed that was just to prove his cleverness. Make everyone see how genius he really was. He never thought that he might actually have a death wish.
Just as John was getting to the climax, his balls tightening and hiss cock pressing hard against the back of Sherlock’s throat he would hear the
“Let’s start by having you undo my trousers.” Behind him he heard John practically growl along with a scoff from Lestrade though he was momentarily less concerned with their reactions and more concerned with how he was going to get the trouser button undone with his ruined fingers. Hesitantly, he raised them planning to just figure it out as he went but he was suddenly halted by Moriarty’s raised hand, grabbing the detective’s attention. Jim clucked disapprovingly at the young brunette on his knees in front of him. “I didn’t tell you to use your hands, daddy would be positively cross if you got any of that delicious blood of yours on his suit. Use your mouth.” Sherlocks jaw clenched involuntarily. He hated this. Hated that Moriarty had the nerve to do this to him and hated that he had allowed himself to be put in such a vulnerable position, but looking over at his friends who were currently strapped to chairs with at least four sniper rifles ready to end their lives he knew he didn’t have much of a choice in the matter. Without raising any fuss – not that he had the energy to do that anyways, he suddenly felt very tired and sluggish – he brought his mouth to the front of Jims trousers and began maneuvering the button through the small loop with his tongue and teeth, all the while trying to ignore the feel of Moriarty’s quickly expanding groin. It was slow work what with his body heavy and uncooperative and his head feeling dizzier by the second, though after around three and a half minutes he finally managed to unclasp the button and pull the zipper down with his teeth. He gagged as his lips brushed against a wet patch on the front of Jims black pants but tried to reign it in before his utter repulsion became to obvious. The last thing he needed was Moriarty to get offended and decide to shoot John out of spite.
John was sat in his chair, a cold cup of tea next to him that had been ignored ever since he had gotten home. He didn’t even know why he made it. He knew he wouldn’t drink it. The only thing he’d been known to drink lately was whatever booze he happened to have lying around. He supposed it was habit; therapeutic in it’s own way. It was part of his old routine. At least that’s what Ella had said. He was used to coming home and making tea for him and Sherlock. He still always seemed to accidentally make two cups of it. Again, habit. Ella said that would eventually go away too, but John wasn’t so sure.
“Mmm, delicious. You taste just like I thought you would. Metallic and salty with just a sprinkle of fear, it has a very recognizable taste you know? Fear. It’s a bit sour with just a hiiiint of musk. Very enjoyable,” he finally backed off of Sherlock completely taking all of his weight off him and the battered detective practically sighed in relief, a hint of tension leaving his body. “Now, time to get back to business! This is the last round I’m sure you’ll be glad to hear, though the stakes are a tad higher…” Carefully, Moriarty pulled something out of his trouser pocket and plopped in unceremoniously into Sherlocks hand. It felt small and cool in his warm and bloody palm and when he looked down he immediately felt his insides churn. Sitting in his palm was a small razor, no bigger than one you would find in an average pencil sharpener and his mind began racing with the possibilities of what Moriarty expected him to do with it. He wouldn’t want him to cut himself with it, that had already been done and God forbid the worlds only consulting criminal become lazy with his torture ideas. No, this was the final round and Moriarty had definitely been saving the best bit for last, it was just driving Sherlock mad that his brain was too sluggish and dizzy to properly work out what it was!
“Yeah he was. Especially then. I think Gregson saw something in him from the beginning. She was always one hell of a judge of character. I thought he was nothing but some stupid junkie kid who was wasting his life away.”
His mind circled back to the dream that had started this amazing event in the first place. That voice.
“Don’t worry about it!” She assured him with an easy grin. “I’m just glad you made it. It would have been a tad awkward to get stood up considering I’ve been rattling on about our date to the owners all week.”
“When did John leave? Did he tell you where he was going?” John wouldn’t have been able to find a new flat on such short notice and had probably gone to Harriet’s to stay, though Sherlock knew that John and his sister didn’t get on too well. He wouldn’t be able to afford a hotel with his salary though so really what other options were there?
“You have a tendency towards self-sabotage. Did you know that?” Ella’s voice was calm and lined with the total certainty of someone who had full confidence in what they were saying. She spoke as if she had John completely figured out. John felt himself clench his teeth at that thought. There was only one person who had ever really known John, and it certainly wasn’t her.
John gazed into his own pint, the now somber mood invading his mind. A thought had been gnawing at his mind for ages, even before Sherlock had jumped, and he figured now was as good a time as any to get some answers.
“Well, at least it seems he’s good for something.” Sherlock drawls. John hums in agreement and proceeds to put away the basket of food while Sherlock heads back into the sitting room.
“I almost thought you weren’t going to show.” She looked bashful and a bit pink in the cheeks from embarrassment. John felt like such an arse.
The air smelled of detergent and medicine. He couldn’t feel the bed sheets under his fingers as those appendages were currently covered in a soft material that felt like gauze but he could feel the crisp linen brushing against his bare legs. He didn’t feel any pain but going by how sluggish and lazy his body currently was it was safe to assume he was on morphine, or at the very least a strong dose of pain medication. His mouth tasted of iron and an unfamiliar sour musk that made his nose wrinkle in disgust and his stomach slosh uneasily. He wondered distantly how quickly he would be able to get a toothbrush to wash the awful taste out of his mouth. He could hear the slow rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor beside him, the pitter patter of feet as nurses doctors and patients alike moved about the halls and, possibly the most worrying sound, the sound of someone’s slightly hitched breathing. Sherlock knew that he would have to face up to everyone eventually but he certainly wasn’t looking forward to the moment. People tended to find him unlikeably eccentric on his best days and today most definitely was not a ‘best day’. Anderson and Donovan never had high opinions of him in the first place, and quite frankly speaking he didn’t give a damn what they thought of him. John and Lestrade however were an entirely different story.
“Sorry?” John asked, not as an apology but more out of confusion. Lestrade took it out of context, however.
“Unpleasant? Of course it was unpleasant, unpleasant for all of us too watch but unpleasant for you most of all. And something I couldn’t get past?” John sounded utterly incredulous. “Sherlock let’s get this straight. Moriarty assaulted you. It was non-consensual. Bottom line. Shh, I don’t care what you have to say about that. I was there and I know you were not a willing party,” he cut the detective off before he could say otherwise. “Moriarty was the one that kidnapped all of us. He was the one who orchestrated the whole thing and trained snipers on us. We can agree on that, yeah?” Sherlock nodded slowly.
“Sweetheart, why so tense?” he gave a light peck to Sherlock’s ear before making his way to the front of him and sliding the knife under the first button on the detective’s white dress shirt. With a quick flick of his wrist he popped one button off after the other letting Sherlock’s shirt slowly come undone and the buttons fly off into random directions, landing with a light clack on the cement floor. After all the buttons were of Moriarty handed Sherlock the knife.
“Nice to be back, isn’t it?” He turns towards John who is watching him from the kitchen doorway with a happy smirk on his face. Sherlock isn’t the only one who had missed home.
“Right, well. All is good then. I’m just glad to hear everything’s fine.” John looked beside him at the crumpled white dress shirt still smelling of lemon and covered in semen, the near empty whiskey bottle and thought back to how he had just had one of the most intense wanks of his life to the thought of his dead friend. The word ‘fine’ didn’t exactly seem to match up with the scenery but he supposed Greg didn’t actually need to know that.
Moriarty. If the consulting criminal wanted in to 221B then he would get in one way or another. The thought sent a chill through Sherlocks body.
“I don’t think I’ve ever come across another grown man who took his sock index so seriously. He’d know instantly if you messed it up too, like a weird sixth sense. Whenever we’d have row I’d go in there and muss it up just to get to him.”
Mindy moves to the door but before leaving she shocks him yet again by moving closer and engulfing him in a hug. There’s nothing seductive or alluring about it, she’s not trying to spitefully tease him with what could have been, instead it feels comforting. Like how John used to hug Harry when they had been close. John feels his breath get lodged in his throat. Never in his life has he felt so wholly engulfed by both guilt and gratitude at the same time.
“How reassuring,” he drawled in the most sarcastic tone he could muster. As if Anderson and Donovan were competent enough to so much as
“I’ve had a wonderful night John. I’m really glad we did this.” He takes her hand in his and smiles softly.
Today had been a trying day. Every day had been a trying day for the past few months. His whole life had been trying since Sherlock…
“Let’s start with this one!” Anderson gave a frightened wail from behind his gag and more tears and snot ran down his face as all five sniper sights moved to hover above his chest. Sherlock felt a brief amusement when he saw that even Donovan looked put off by the mans behavior. However, the amusement was gone in a second as he felt the cool metal of a knife glide across his still stretched and vulnerable throat. John was now shouting and twisting in his restraints even more desperately than before, earning himself a hard swat to the head from one of Moriarty’s thugs.
“I don’t know what you mean.” He nearly growled through gritted teeth. So much for not showing any signs of defensiveness.
“That’s friendship, mate. It isn’t always logical. But logic or no I need to know that this won’t happen again. You need to. You just need to learn to trust us more. To trust
John yanked his phone off the arm of the chair where he left it and was surprised to see it wasn’t Mindy who was calling him but Greg. He felt himself relax even further when he looked at the time and found it was only quarter to four. He had only slept for around a half hour than. Thank god. Ignoring the call from Greg for now he ran up to his bedroom got dressed in more suitable clothing in record time and grabbed his phone and wallet before shooting out the door and hailing a cab. He had been planning to take a tube to save money but he no longer had the time for that. He impatiently snapped the address Mindy had given him to the cabbie and tried not to feel like a complete arsehole as they sped of.
They stay like that, seated next to each other and grasping each others hands for comfort until one of Mycroft’s minions pops up without a world and takes Moriarty’s gift away. After they leave John goes to move off the bed, back to the other side of the room but Sherlock suddenly feels a spike of panic. That’s too far away. He doesn’t want to be that far from John. Not so far that he can’t see all the different coloured specs of blue in his eyes or the way the sun hits his hair or where he can’t easily reach out and feel the texture of his ugly wool jumper. He reaches out when John is just barely off the bed and latches on to his jumper, making John look back at him in surprise.
He was high functioning, that’s undeniable but it was always noticeable. He was always just that little bit
“Why would you do that?” John spoke up after what felt like forever. His face was raw now. Confusion and sadness present throughout his whole body.
“For round three I want to see you shove this knife under each of your nails. I was considering just getting you to rip them off completely buuuuut this seems like more fun. Though to shake it up a bit this time I’m setting a quota. If you haven’t gotten all your nails when the time runs out I’ll finish the job on the ever so brave cop you seem so very fond of.” Sherlock felt a spike of panic go through him. So much for saving his hands. He looked up at Lestrade with wide eyes. The mans face was full of guilt and was now a chalky white with a sheen of sweat covering it. If he looked that bad Sherlock couldn’t imagine how much of a mess he must look now. He looked back over at Moriarty as he began handing him the already blood stained knife though before the weapon could reach his hand Moriarty’s attention was stolen by Lestrade’s panicked grunts and desperate thrashing. Moriarty stared at him in amusement before snapping his fingers and pointing towards the strung out DI.
“Of course it matters John. You’ve just lost someone close to you in an extremely traumatic way. Of course you’re going to have feelings about it. But you need to know it’s not your fault. You didn’t have any control over the situation or Sherlock’s actions.”
Those pink, plump cupids bow lips had been parted, Sherlock was panting too hard to fully close it. John hadn’t minded a bit. Now that he thought back on it he wondered how it would have felt to push that puffy bottom lip down with his thumb. To feel Sherlock’s saliva slicked lips part for him.
“You alright?” He was startled back to consciousness by Mindy’s soothing voice and her wide eyes full of concern. He felt guilty about that, too. He didn’t deserve her concern, not when he was waiting anxiously for the train to stop so he could get away from her and society and the fresh air to go sit in his dank flat and contemplate putting his gun to use.
John knew the answer to these questions, he just didn’t understand the why of it all. Sherlock was special, yes. Sherlock was unique. Sherlock was maddening and hateful and sometimes downright cruel and yet Sherlock occupied the space in John’s mind that shouted adventure and daring and when he was around the man, John felt no wanderlust or need to flee, he only felt complete. Like the missing piece of his life’s puzzle, the one that spurred him to search and explore for years and years was finally resting beside him, pulsing in a dull glow in his mind’s eye, telling him he’d found home. Which was ridiculous, he barely knew Sherlock. How many words had they spoken to each other, and how many of those words had even been kind ones?
These were the moments when Sherlock regrounded himself in his life’s motivation. Where he was free to meditate on the career he’d chosen and the path forward towards his continued success in the niche world he’d slotted himself into all those years ago. The times when he remembered that he’d married himself to
The slamming of Sherlock’s door a moment later gave John proof that he hadn’t imagined it, and John physically crumbled at the realisation. He grimaced and shut the piano lid with forced gentility. He counted to ten before his anger flared red hot behind his eyelids and he bellowed out into the room, “If I’m an idiot, Sherlock, then you’re a bloody coward! You know what this is! You fucking know it!”
John snapped, throwing his hands in the air. “To fuck your life up, I guess!” and then sagged with exhaustion. “Why are you doing this?”
His room was actually a set of rooms, to John’s immense and utter astonishment. Sherlock had pulled apart yet another set of sliding doors to reveal what looked to be a study, complete with fireplace and a matching set leather chairs, but what took his attention for a spin as soon as he spotted it was the baby grand piano in the corner next to a large floor to ceiling window whose drapes had been pulled aside. Light spilled out over onto the keys, illuminating the dull, yellowing ivory into a glowing white.
“Oh.” John stared at the wall covered in oddly patterned wallpaper, wondered what Sherlock’s room looked like, smelled like . . . he shook himself and nodded. “Right.”
The company was celebrating the final performance of its bi-annual fundraising gala, and everyone was in high spirits, most especially the dancers considering they had earned themselves a long overdue three-day weekend from
The lighter sparked and flared to life before her lips as she leaned back in her chair and rested her legs on a leather pouf in the solarium of the house. She kissed the tip of the joint to the flame, watching it catch and inhaling deeply, allowing the rich smoke to fill her lungs and sooth the frayed edges of her nerves. She sat there for a good while, staring out at her back garden, planning her words. In the end, she simply decided
Irene didn’t move, in fact, she leaned closer. “Despite what you may think, I’m on your side, John.”
John looked up from his music, pencil poised in his hand, unsure of who had been addressed, considering the room had gone deathly quiet. To his astonishment, Mr Baynes was staring at him. He licked his lips and sat up straighter, the man was rather disarming.
He dragged his mouth down, hot breath panting over the black pants covering Sherlock’s virgin skin. John looked up the length of the body spread out before him, finding Sherlock’s light eyes easily in the darkness, the heady nature of the moment coming full circle to land on his shoulders in a crescendo of new and intense emotion. It rippled down his back and pooled inside his chest next to where his heart rested, thudding quickly to a tune John suspected only Sherlock Holmes knew how to play.
They shared a cab, though they didn’t speak. John remained silent and stoic across the back seat from him, his hands two balls of tension in his lap. Sherlock could smell his shampoo, fresh and bright in the stale air of the cab and he wanted to lean into that scent. He wanted to cover himself with it and take it with him onto the stage as a talisman.
Sherlock felt John’s chuckle at the side of his throat where he was currently nuzzling his nose before biting at the sensitive skin. “I have to at some point.”
Their afternoon descended into a tangle of tangled limbs and fevered moans as they rolled and writhed on the bed. There was nothing dignified in the way Sherlock’s mouth sought out John’s, the way their hands groped at sweat-slippery skin and their hips rocked the iron bed frame into the wall in a staccato rhythm. Mrs Hudson could probably hear them on the floor below. Sherlock didn’t care. Let the old woman have a bit of a thrill over the sound of her tenants copulating upstairs. After all, no one had ever confused Sherlock for being a decent person.
growing up, or had to sit through a rewatch of the musical on the telly while being looked after by a grandmother or a great aunt. The choreography of Jerome Robbins was unmistakable and that particular move that John had the glory of witnessing first hand was the ultimate calling-card of Robbins’ style.
It was dangerous, this charade. Sherlock could miss a step, John could miss a chord. Something needed to give. Sherlock could feel the anticipation building but couldn’t deduce the correct course of action. He twisted into another pirouette, his gaze breaking from John’s for an eighth of a second as his head spun around again. When Sherlock focused on John once more, he watched in pure amazement as the man seemed to make a decision mid-measure, his lips pulling into a cheeky half grin. And then, inexplicably, John winked at him.
It was during those times when John would wonder what had ever gotten into him to even attempt to pursue this eccentric creature, who at times, John wasn’t sure was all-together entirely human. What had made him halt his life’s momentum and settle into a bedroom at the top of the stairs in an antique brownstone owned by the most endearing old bat he’d ever met? What had made him forget that his lifestyle was that of a gypsy and that the urge to pick up and move-on was an ever-present tickle at the back of his brain, itching at the nape of his neck?
“Don’t get your knickers in a twist. This is Brooklyn. People say fuck before noon on Sundays and life carries on. I assure you.”
John turned his head to take in Sherlock beside him, and all the wind left his lungs. Sherlock looked furious. His eyes were practically burning holes into Irene’s skin from where he stood. It confused John and worried him all at once. What had he missed?
Needless to say, John did not sleep well, and at the first signs of sunrise cresting over the endless rows of tenements and brownstones John rose and may his way into work, the need to be in the studio overwhelming him.
John glared up at her. So much for enjoying his cup of tea. He couldn’t drink it now in good conscience, and that was a damn shame for England. “You’re a piece of work, you know that?”
she thought as she ascended the quarter sawn oak stairs to the second floor, her hands running over the smooth, curved surface of the balustrade, seeking reassurance.
When Sherlock came, his prick slicked wet and sucked deep into the hollows of John’s mouth, he arched backward off the bed, his eyes falling closed from the intensity of orgasm surging through every vein, every nerve ending. His hands clutched helplessly at the empty air as his arms stretched high above his head before falling heavily against the sheets, the internal strings of his body letting loose once more. It was still a novel experience, seeking and finding such intimate gratification with John. It wrung him out. He felt content, calm, practically catatonic as John lay his cheek against the flat surface of Sherlock’s stomach, his arms draped across his chest, possessive and pleasant.
"Yes, look where it has gotten me." Sherlock set his elbows on the table, his hands steepled before his chin.
The one glaring dissimilarity between the two of them was Sherlock’s competitive need to remain solitary. He had seen his brother over the years grow tall, proud and successful employing the same tactic and found no reason not to follow in his footsteps in hopes of achieving the same end. It was like a game to him, a strange, alienating game where he allowed himself to be outcast from society and relished the strength he found in being content with his own solitude.
Behind them, the metal door banged and Greg Lestrade strolled into the studio, all salt n’ pepper hair and warm brown eyes with a half-eaten eclair in one hand and a stack of papers in the other. He waved the eclair at Irene and John in greeting and walked over to the front mirror to deposit his things. Rehearsal time was imminent.
At the beginning of September in Sherlock’s fifth year with The Royal Ballet and third year of his tenure as their ‘Golden Boy of Ballet’, things finally fell apart. He would later associate the constant simmering anger he felt running through him with the early death of his father, but at the time, he did his best to not dwell on the pain and instead focused all of his emotion into his dancing.
Two discordant notes hit the air in a spasm of sound before John leaned into the piano and smoothed out the startling beats into a sweet repeating phrase. He continued filling the room with his aching soul echoing out through the music and Sherlock felt himself moving into the center of the studio, lead by the coaxing, addicting pull of inspiration. He spun and stalked and stretched to the sounds John weaved him through the piano's keys, and allowed his body to move with the music, feeling its push to and fro and up and down and side to side. He improvised along with John and closed his eyes as he did, feeling more free and open than he’d ever experienced since the first time he’d stepped on a professional stage in white tights dancing the role of Albrecht in Giselle with The Royal Ballet.
Sherlock squeezed her arms, his excitement infectious. Molly’s expression mirrored his own broad smile as he celebrated his newly found joy. He bounced on his toes, feeling buoyant, the tedium of the world around him momentarily forgotten. He must have looked like a child at Christmas to Molly—filled with eager innocence and purity and wonder all rolled into one.
Now that Sherlock was allowing himself this moment, allowing himself to be governed by his instincts as opposed to his mind, he wanted to savour it, to process as much of the overwhelming amounts of information he could as he explored and experienced another man’s body for the first time.
“I only say that because you’ve been searching for his approval you’re entire life. It’s why you can’t garner satisfaction staying in one place for too long. I’m not trying to be cruel when I tell you this, but you’ll never find what you’re looking for leading a vagabond--”
Despite the rush of feeling Sherlock was currently riding, it did not escape his notice that John refused to look up from his pages as he played. He curved in on himself over the piano, his shoulders hunching and shifting with tension as he pounded the keys into submission. The audience must have been torn between watching the dancers dominate the stage, bringing Jerome Robbins’ choreography to life with perfect precision, and the way with which John Watson made those piano keys bend to his will. Sherlock couldn’t keep his eyes off him, which was not ideal considering he needed to concentrate.
To Sherlock, the look of a man’s flat, hair-covered chest over the smooth, subtle curves of a woman’s had always been his preference. He had always known and understood that part of himself even if he’d intentionally maintained a measured distance from the people around him, closing his mind’s eye off to such indulgence. The only time he’d ever experienced the fevered embrace of another body against his own was in partnering during class or a performance. And even then it was always the delicate, bird-like bones of a woman’s arms wrapped around him, and the light, pink kisses of a woman’s lips on his own. It never felt quite like anything to him, just the slight sensation of butterfly wings fluttering over his skin. The idea of it was beautiful and sweet, yet the reality was strange and unsatisfying.
People often say that he was bisexual and ignored the fact that he was a proud gay man in the dance world. The speculation probably comes from rumors that he really wanted to be a father, and back then, adoption wasn't as obvious a choice. He had a long-term relationship with Robert Tracy, an American dancer, until his death. Sadly, he paid little attention to the devastation of the AIDS virus that swept Paris in the 80's and tested positive for HIV in 1984. He ignored his diagnosis and kept working, determined to not let anything slow him down but at the age of 54 he succumbed and passed away in his beloved Paris.
He sulked against the wall, purposefully slouching, despite what the ballet masters had told him about his posture. He was still too tall for his age, his limbs too long and his hands too large. He felt like a freak in class, his extension uncontrolled and his spins too spastic to be beautiful despite their precision. Those were a few of the reasons he’d applied to the school, and reluctantly allowed the move to London. Needs must if he wanted to be the best, his mother had told him and he agreed.
“You’re an idiot.” Sherlock’s voice cut deep into the flesh of John’s belly and buried itself in the marrow of his right hip bone. He blinked back at the man, hurt clear on his features. Sherlock merely stared. Assessing. Always assessing, never answering.
“Uh, thanks?” John’s patience was running thin. Why did Irene have this strange obsession with him and Sherlock? It was somewhat disturbing.
Thank you all of you guys for your patience! This is it!  We're basically there, this is the happy ending you've all been waiting for, with the exception of one more epilogue chapter to follow. (Which will still end happily, don't worry.) I was going to end this guy on a cliffhanger but decided to be a good person and not do that to y'all, so all that extra bit of drama and action will occur in the epilogue and for now, you can enjoy the sickening fluff of the chapter below. :)
Even though the air around them crackled with tension, Irene remained calm and continued to smile. “You think I’m going to tell Mycroft.” She spoke to Sherlock alone.
The man in John’s arms was all muscle and sinew and long, endless limbs of pale, white skin. It was intoxicating to have him this close, and holding on so tight after all those weeks of questioning looks and endlessly frustrating tension. John leaned in and licked a stripe along Sherlock’s collarbone, tasting the salt of his skin and breathing in the scent of him, inhaling deeply, losing himself. Sherlock’s head tipped forward, his damp hair falling over John’s forehead as Sherlock nuzzled against his ear, his lips tentative and shy against his skin.
John pulled back, blinking hard. “Thanks,” he said, his voice knife-sharp, the anger and sarcasm blatantly evident.
“John, dear. You’re home.” She kissed him on each cheek and squeezed his elbow, tugging one of two rucksacks from his shoulder and placing it pointedly at Sherlock’s bare feet. “How was it finding the place? Not hard, I hope.”
Ugh, okay, I couldn't fiddle with this chapter anymore. It just it what it is at this point. There are limits to the number of times one can tweak a single sentence . . . and if not there should be.
GHB or Liquid Fantasy or Liquid E is a common club drug that loosens inhibitions and makes you rather randy. It's also very dangerous to mix with alcohol (what isn't?) and both Irene and Sherlock failed to factor in the amount he'd already drunk at the time she'd slipped him her little 'helping hand' pill. Thank you to Tali-Zora (who works in the medical field) for helping me with research and being on hand for all my drug-related questions. :)
Sherlock scoffed, his hand falling to the back of John’s head to play with the riotous tangles of his impossible blonde hair. John peeked out from his hiding place, his storm-blue eyes finding Sherlock’s own as he raised his head. They took a moment to watch each other, silent yet questioning, daring the other to speak.
This is a two-part chapter. The second part just needs a final edit and is ready to go. In the second part, we actually get to opening night (yay) and resolution is much happier (double yay). I promise.
No matter the catalyst, this wasn’t the first time they’d sat side by side with music on their minds and instruments at hand. Sherlock had found a joy in sharing something so essential to John’s existence over the past year, and playing with him had become a cherished routine that Sherlock now often craved.
The image was doused in the heavily contrasting blues and purples of the club’s lights, the sweat on their skin glowing in the harsh colors. The bodies thrashing around them were blurred, leaving him and Sherlock the sole focus of the camera’s gaze as if they were under a spotlight illuminating every grind, every thrust, every bite of their mouths. It was a striking photo, and a damning one.
He was equal parts brilliant and arrogant. A rising talent so incendiary it was hard to go a week without seeing his name mentioned in the Times or his picture dashed across the blogs of online ballet aficionados or the social media pages of teenage girls. He was a beautiful idea in an untouchable skin - an unstoppable force wrapped in a delicate shell, and he only cared about
“Jesus, Sherlock!” John punched out through his teeth, his need to thrust becoming painfully clear. Sherlock pulled off, licking his lips and smiling at the strange new experience of finding the bitter aftertaste of precome on his tongue.
into the room. John smiled around him, his hands moving from gently scratching along the soft hairs of his thighs to cupping at the heavy sac between Sherlock’s legs.
“Wouldn’t I? I’ve told you before, success at any cost. That was your goal once. Has spending a mere two months in the presence of John Watson changed your motivation in life?”
With an uptick to the corner of his mouth, Mr Baynes’ stoic features slowly morphed into a devilish glint of a smirk that had the entire room leaning forwards, anticipating a Sherlockian response of sharp-tongued ire. What came next surprised them all, judging by the collective gasp that erupted at the man’s firm declaration of, “I agree.”
Mrs H was busy staring up into the quickly darkening sky and did not respond to John’s initiation of conversation. He tried again.
She tutted and waved a hand. “Yes, it is, but don’t feel as if you have to walk on eggshells ‘round here. Sherlock certainly doesn’t. This is a home, John. Not a museum.”
- Inspector Gaynes (no first name, hence the need for one) only shows up once in ACD canon but he's the most observant of the inspectors that ACD has written, to the extent that Sherlock even praises the man after solving a case alongside him. This is the reason I added in the bit about John thinking that Sherlock may have found his equal in the man, intelligence-wise.
“Research.” He said, taking John into his mouth and swallowing him whole. He hummed happily as the semi-soft cock grew firmer under his tongue.
For the first time in Sherlock’s solitary life filled with rigorous self-discipline and unending dedication to his chosen profession, which kept him at arm’s length from all of society, he’d found what it felt like to have a companion.
But the man had already disappeared from the second story hallway, leaving John to chase him down an empty stairwell and sprint through a deserted first-floor lobby onto the city street with no clues to follow. John starred up and down the broad avenue, the oppressive, late-evening humidity soaking into his skin like a coating of too much suntan oil. He shivered in disgust and frustration and scrubbed his hands over his face, cursing into his palms - they smelled like Sherlock’s sweat-soaked skin.
John shouted into the sky, startling the morning doves from their perches on the window ledges of brick and brownstone houses around him. He wanted to smash his mug with his fist, he wanted to throw the Chemex clear across the deck and against the warbled glass of the solarium windows, he wanted to push Sherlock Holmes up against that same glass wall and make him beg for mercy from the unyielding demands of his hands and cock and tongue.
“What the hell is going on?” John shouted through the door of Sherlock’s room, which he’d locked like some petulant child.
music, which was a blending of jazz and classical into a strange amalgamation of a new genre that was coined in the late fifties. Mr Baynes explained that he wished for the company to soak in the style much like how they soaked the choreography into their muscles because the ultimate example of
“Alright. See you then. And if I text, you’d better respond unless you want a pile of coppers barging into your flat!” John chuckled, though he knew it came out hollow. He was still staring at the come stained white button down, unable to look away from it in a strange mix of sick arousal and hot shame, and he was suddenly anxious to get off the phone.
“Mycroft, why the bloody fuck is a bouquet from Jim Moriarty sitting in Sherlock’s hospital room?” He goes quiet, presumably listening to whatever Mycroft has to say in defense. John scoffs. “Yes. It was delivered just now by one of the nurses.” Pause. “Yes, I’m bloody sure it was from him Mycroft! He left a bloody note!” A shorter pause this time, followed by Johns clipped tone. “Apparently your security isn’t as good as you think it is, then.” More silence. “Fine. Just get it out of here quick will you?” John demands before hanging up and tossing his abused phone aside. Sherlock is slightly surprised at the brusqueness John is currently showing towards Mycroft. John has never been scared of his older brother and he makes no moves to act otherwise but he is always polite with the older man. Always courteous. Though just now John was far from courteous. He sounded, quite frankly, pissed off.
“I can’t hold that one against you. ‘John Watson’ isn’t exactly uncommon, is it?” They spend a moment just smiling softly at each other, letting the air clear now that the hard part is over.
“Sherlock, what the hell!? I’m not letting you do this for me! Let me have it!” Sherlock shook his head again though he didn’t look towards the DI, instead he held his hand out towards Moriarty, silently requesting for the knife.
that he is. Instead, he heads to his bedroom and slides open his end table drawer revealing the heavy gun within.
“John, I-I have too,” he cursed himself for allowing his voice to waver; for showing weakness, “Besides even blind I’ll still solve crimes better than all of Scotland Yard,” he tried to lighten the situation with a bit of humour but it didn’t seem to have the desired effect of making John laugh, instead the ex-soldier just grimaced.
His days in the hospital were monotonous and boring. Nurses came in and changed his bandages and checked on his wounds to make sure no infection was occurring and he was forced to eat three square meals a day and snacks. It was torturous and though he was far from religious he found himself praying to return to Baker Street.
The day that Sherlock finally get’s his morphine turned down and his brain comes fully back in order is the day the delivery arrives.
“Yeah, well, we got one hell of a case going on.” He waved to the bar tender and motioned that he wanted what John was having. After the bartender came over with his drink and walked away he ran his hand through his more salt than pepper hair and took a great big gulp of his pint. “He would have loved it.” John doesn’t need to ask Greg who ‘He’ is.
“Sherlock, please, just. Look up at me.” Sherlock hated John Watson. Hated that he could never refuse him anything. He hated that he was being forced to lift his face and look John in his eyes, which were currently red and glossy. The closest he had seen John come to actual tears since their friendship had begun.
his chest and stomach. His hand comes to a stop right in front of his groin and he kneads down, rubbing himself slow and firm. Each press of his palm feels like small sparks erupting under the thin skin of his genitals and John is completely
“Probably good, that. Most of them would have gone quite bad by now.” Sherlock hums along, already planning out his next line of experimentation. His thought process however is brought to a halt by John clearing his throat. Sherlock looks at him and is suddenly painfully aware of how close they are standing. So close that he can see John’s pores and feel the air from his breath. If he took just a half step forward their chests would be touching on each exhale. He gulps.
. He raced for the phone and berated himself for falling asleep. He must be so late. Or had he completely blown Mindy off?
. Just the memory of the rugged and dark lilt it had to it had him moaning. He always suspected that Sherlock would be able to get him off with only his voice and nothing else.
“Sometimes I feel like he’s haunting me.” The admission catches both Greg and himself by surprise. John hadn’t been able to put his feelings lately into words until just this moment. It feels good to get out. To admit that he can’t go anywhere or do anything without feeling like Sherlock’s ghost is stalking him; reminding him how empty the world really is now.
“Ah-! Jeesu—Sherlock!” Hot, hot release flooded into his hand and John had to bite down hard on his right hand to keep from crying out and giving his landlady a real fright. The orgasm seemed to last forever and yet not long enough. Even after he had stopped ejaculating he still felt the low thrum of arousal beating through his body with every heart beat.
“Because it was made for me. It was my fault we were there in the first place, so it was only right I took the punishment made for me. You lot were just for decoration to Moriarty. Just pawns to use against me. None of that was intended for you.” Sherlock watched his answer absorb into Lestrade’s brain. The older man seemed a bit startled by the answer and shook his head again, though one of disagreement instead of guilt. Sherlock liked that much more. Anything was better than seeing Lestrade feeling guilty over something Sherlock himself had done wrong.
“John, why don’t you just sit down. There are still ten minutes left in the session and I think it’s important to go over this new breakthrough together—“
“No, there wasn’t really. Well, every now and then he would get these atrocious black moods.” He felt himself frown at the thought. “He would just curl up on the sofa and no matter what you did he wouldn’t speak or move or eat. He would just lay there till he snapped out of it. Or till he got bored and went searching for my gun.”
It had felt incredibly odd to hear Sherlock act nice and at the time it had filled John up with a grateful fondness but apparently the flattery had rubbed Harry up the opposite way.
“What?!” He growled again, throwing his hands up in the air. He was pretty damn sure therapist’s weren’t supposed to smile as their clients had mental fucking breakdowns.
“Phew! I really didn’t think you were going to make it there, but then again you always do tend to surprise me. So how are we feeling Sherlock?” he pauses as if waiting for a response before realizing it’s not coming. “Here, this will probably make it a bit easier.” Moriarty works the gag off slowly and carefully, making sure not to tug on any curls in the process. The careful treatment scares Sherlock more than when he had been handed a knife and told to use it on himself. “SO, ready for the final round?” Sherlock just nods, not quite trusting himself to speak yet. “Glad to hear it. You’ve done such a wonderful job so far,” he slowly began trailing his hand down Sherlocks bare and sweaty chest, his nail caught on a nipple making Sherlock wiggle back on his chair trying to get away from the sensation. Thankfully he didn’t spend any more time on his nipples and just passed right by them, not so thankfully he instead put all of his focus on sliding his finger over one of the deeper cuts on his chest, even slipping his finger in the gash and feeling the vulnerable flesh. Sherlock hissed and winced at the rough treatment of his still fresh and stinging cut. After what felt like an eternity of Moriarty slowly wiggling his finger inside of him the man finally pulled his stubby digit out only to take it greedily in his mouth and hum around the taste.
“Oh, boys!” She cooed, hovering over them as John took their bags out of the car. “Your brother phoned to tell me the two of you would be home early. How wonderful! Baker Street just hasn’t been the same without the two of you. Far too quiet!” She leaned in to give Sherlock a hug but he hissed in pain when she pressed to hard on his still quite painful shoulders. “Oh, Sherlock dear, I’m so sorry! You poor thing. You two head right in and I’ll bring some tea and biscuits up in a mo’.”
He looked back and saw Sherlock standing there, except he was wearing glasses and had a lip ring. John was on his feet before he knew it.
John thought back to the last day he’d bothered to venture out of the flat. “I went to go visit the grave.
“That’s. That’s um, wow. Okay.” John is visibly flustered and seems to be at a loss for words. “That’s… that’s really, pretty bloody incredible actually. No, well, not incredible, but…” “Okay. Look. So this friendship thing is clearly a bit of an unknown area for you, yeah?” Sherlock nods slowly, not sure where John is going with this. “Well then I’m going to have to teach you some things, so that this,” he motions towards Sherlocks broken form laying in the hospital bed, “never happens again. Okay. So, friendship, especially best friends, which yes we are, is a two way street. It’s about give and take.”
Greg seemed to take a moment. John looked up and saw the DI staring into his glass with a furrowed brow and tight frown.
“I know you do. So do I. We just have to wait a bit longer, till your better enough to leave.” It’s true, he can tell. John is a man of action. A doctor and a soldier. He, like Sherlock, craves danger and spurts of adrenaline. John has never been and will never be the sitting down type.
When Sherlock awakens once again the doctors and medical staff get to work. They talk to him about skin grafts which will have to be done on his shoulders and arms, they discuss release dates and earliest time he will be allowed to go home (the time they give him is much to long and he makes a note to request Mycroft’s assistance in shortening it) and they send a psyche consult to him which proves to be rather entertaining. Sherlock had insisted that a psyche consult was hardly necessary but after John and Dr. Richards had pointed out that his wounds were not only born from torture but also self-inflicted and the fact that there was sexual trauma involved (which Sherlock vehemently disagreed with but stopped his arguing after one look from John) he relented and allowed the woman to talk to him. He spent most of the time insulting her degree in medicine and mental health practice and the rest of the time being sarcastic and overly snippy. By the end of it he was sure she would sign anything just to get him out of the hospital and away from her, which worked just fine for him.
“The burns are bad, third or fourth degree, the cuts will definitely need stitches though and he’s lost a frankly ridiculous amount of blood. When’s the ambulance getting here?”
“Yeah, you should be! I’ve been trying to reach you for a week, John. No one has heard from you in a week. A buggering week.”
“Yeah, actually. I’m meeting with someone.” Ella smiled at that, clearly not expecting him to answer.
“I can walk on my own,” he didn’t need to be coddled or walked around like an invalid. Sherlock was perfectly capable of moving himself around. Yet, despite all this John and Lestrade looked at him with a slight frown.
“Sherlock? Hey, Sherlock? How are you feeling?” Sherlock snapped back to attention and took his eyes off his blood soaked hands to look straight at John. John was looking at him intensely no doubt checking his pupil dilation and pulse for any abnormalities.
until his face is red and him and Greg are giggling like mad in a taxi on the way back to Baker Street.
“We should do this again soon.” John finds himself saying unexpectedly. And even more unexpectedly, he  means it wholeheartedly.
, John.” He pauses. “I… I have never been the type to make friends easily. Though people are generally open books to me in moments, the social proceedings that must take place in order to properly befriend them have always been something of an enigma. You… you are the only person I’ve ever been able to call a ‘best friend’. That is important to me. I’ve lived with my eye sight my whole life and I’ve lived with you for a mere part of my life but given the choice I know which one would make the greater impact on me if I were to lose it.” It’s a simple answer. It’s true as well. Sherlock would give up anything for John Watson and that includes any or all of his five senses. John, though, apparently disagrees with the sentiment as he lets a long sorrowful sigh trail out of his mouth.
John was incredibly thankful for that fact now as the tube slowed to a stop pushing his lax body slightly forward in his seat. His mind was clear, the shameful guilty feeling from this morning was beginning to fade to a more manageable level and he was now eagerly anticipating knocking a few pints back in a pub with company instead of drinking cheap liquor alone in his flat. It would be a nice change of pace. He waited until the first herd of commuters had filed out of the doors before making his own departure, enjoying the slight chill in the air as he walked out onto the street and found his way to the usual pub.
All in all it was boring and by the time two weeks of his earlier agreed upon three week stay in hospital were up he was ready to tear his hair out.
“Just don’t make me regret this, okay John?” And with that she leaves the office and John takes his first breath of the day.
a bit when you and Sherlock were just starting out but surely not now. Don’t you think it’s too soon?”
Greg had made a surprise visit one day and brought over a box of Sherlock’s things he hadn’t even known existed. It was full of junk mostly. Nothing of value or anything that even came close to explaining who or what Sherlock was. John had almost resented that box, full of meaningless possessions that did nothing except remind him of what he had lost.
“What?” he asked not even knowing what to say. He was still a bit too fuzzy in the head from the sedative to follow the odd change in conversation. He knew Lestrade was hardly a genius but surely even he couldn’t be stupid enough to think anything that happened was because of him. Moriarty did that to get at Sherlock, because he has an obsession with
All he knew for sure was that he had to get a hold on himself. He couldn’t be doing things like this. He couldn’t start approaching every skinny bloke with curly black hair thinking it’s Sherlock.
“That was an… unpleasant choice,” he’s not screaming anymore, his voice has taken on a quieter more vulnerable tone. He hates it, and hates himself for allowing it to happen. “But it was still a choice, John.” They are silent now, John still looking irritated and confused and Sherlock feeling just plain sad. This is it. This is the moment he has been fearfully anticipating. This is the moment where John tells him enough is enough. That he can’t take this anymore. That Sherlock is disgusting, a freak just like everyone said and that he can’t take this anymore. This is the moment where John finally tells him he’s moving out. He might as well start them off.
First things first, every celebration needs a little liquid reward. He walks back over to the counter, where Jack has been patiently waiting for him and pours another. He takes a sip and smiles. It tastes better, somehow, than the first two had. This one tastes of success. Achievement.
“So? What results did you find from this… experiment?” John pauses for a moment as if seriously considering this.
and I am entitled to feel a bit of fucking depression over that, alright? Is that okay with everyone?” He was so bloody sick of it. Of everyone telling him to just get over it, to move on, to let go. You didn’t move on from Sherlock Holmes. There was no such thing. John knew that he would always sort his life with Pre-Sherlock memories and Post-Sherlock memories, and how in the bloody sodding
Emotions are bubbling all through John. He can feel them under his skin and clogging his brain. He knows he should be feeling something. Anger, hurt, betrayal. Some formula of all three? But right now he was just knackered. Completely and utterly exhausted with
The pain was horrific and even the gag that was shoved in his mouth couldn’t stop the pained wail that tore through his throat. In front of him through the veil of agony coating his brain he could here his audience’s muffled shrieks and gasps through their gags along with the sound of struggling. The struggling was most probably from John, Lestrade or both though he couldn’t quite pin point it right now or even look up as the horrible stinging throbbing in his thumb was stealing all his attention. He wanted to stop right there; to throw the knife down and quit whatever ridiculous game this was but he only had around six minutes left and eight fingers and one thumb left to stab. Trying not to think too hard about what he was doing he quickly jammed the knife in his pointer finger immediately followed by another rough jab into his middle finger. Both were done in less than ten seconds and he allowed himself a few more seconds to breath. His breath was coming out shaky and he couldn’t seem to suck enough air into his nose to calm himself or to even catch his breath properly. He looked down at his hand; it was bloody and curling into itself as if it were trying to shield itself from the attacks but it was useless he still had two fingers to go on that hand. He goes for his ring finger next but only stabs it in halfway before hesitating. He knows Moriarty won’t be satisfied with that and doesn’t want to risk the possible consequences so he pushes it on the rest of the way. A bitter sob fills his ears and he distantly recognizes it as his own. One more finger to go – on this hand that is – his mind so unhelpfully reminds him. The pinky finger is the worst. The nail is the smallest on that one, so when the wide shard of metal shoves under, it pushes the nail up tearing it almost completely off until its only held there by the cuticle. He drops the knife onto his lap for a moment and clenches his eyes shut tightly trying to fight through the pain that’s completely enveloping him. The cuts on his arm and chest were stinging even harsher now that his sweat had gotten all over them and his burns felt as if someone had placed a blanket of scorching hot metal over his shoulders and biceps though nothing hurt more than his right hand, which felt like it was – and quite literally was – torn apart. Even the air seemed to be hurting it. But on the bright side at least he only had one hand left!
“Hello,” she spoke carefully yet happily. He gave her a tight nod of the head before turning back to stare out the window. He realized he was acting rather rude and inside he was slightly ashamed by his uncharacteristic behavior but he really wasn’t in the mood to socialize right now – didn’t know if he ever would be really – and the fluorescent lights on the ceiling were beginning to give him a headache. He could see her shoulders slump slightly from the clear rejection but apparently she was more confident than he gave her credit for because she pressed on.
“When Moriarty captured us, the last round. The one where he, you know, told you to use that razor on your eyes. Were you actually going to do that?” Sherlock felt half relieved that John wasn’t making some sort of confession that he had decided to move out after all and half horrified that John was bringing this subject up again. Sherlock thought back to that moment. At the time he had hesitated slightly at first but it took no more than a few seconds to realize how obvious the choice really was. Even now Sherlock had no problem making the decision.
Sherlock was ashamed of himself. Barfing into a rubbish bin after having his mouth and body violated by the man he hated most on this earth while his two closest friends watched. How would any of them ever get over this? They wouldn’t. As he threw up violently into the rubbish bin he knew this for certain. None of them would ever forget this and Greg and John, John especially, would never forgive him for it. Greg may seem forgiving now but that was just because he felt guilty for some imagined reason. Once he came to his senses and realized that Sherlock was the one to blame for all this he would leave. And so would John.
Sure, he had Mrs. Hudson and Greg would still come round or invite him for a night at the pub but even that was becoming increasingly rare. He hadn’t talked to Molly since it had happened either. From what Greg told him the last time he’d come round to ‘check in’ (make sure John hadn’t offed himself) the young pathologist hadn’t spoken to much of anyone lately. She seemed to have completely withdrawn from everyone and began acting even more skittish and shy than usual. Not that John didn’t know why; he did. It was for the same reasons he had for staying locked up in his flat for months. They had both lost the man they loved three months ago. They may not have loved him in the same way but he did love Sherlock. Sherlock was the best friend he’d ever had. Some days he felt like he couldn’t even
“Can I get another one of these?” He shakes his empty pint at the bartender and thanks him as he’s passed a fresh one, the thin layer of foam on top sloshing off the side. He takes a long drink and licks the tangy foam off his top lip.
stops hurting), but other than that the blog was just a harsh reminder of the life he had lost along with his best friend.
“I’ve been better,” his own voice surprised him slightly. It was croaky from disuse and sore from the fellatio. Oh God. He could not think about that while looking at John, he just couldn’t. He mentally cringed at himself and lowered his gaze not wanting to be faced with Johns own intense eye contact but the Doctor was having none of it and tilted his chin up so they were facing each other again. Sherlock prayed his embarrassment wasn’t showing.
The detective rolled his eyes at the endearment and with a quick tug he dragged the blade across his forearm, carving a two-inch gash that immediately began spilling hot blood. It stung at first, than it changed to a dull burn. Nothing he couldn’t handle. He ignored the increasingly desperate sounds coming from John and the gasps he assumed belonged to Sally and Anderson and continued cutting.
“No, it’s not that, Monday works fine I just have something to do between two and three.” The ‘thing he had to do’ was actually his therapy appointment, but somehow that didn’t seem like a good thing to mention when planning out a first date.
In truth, he had always been curious about what Sherlock’s life in Uni must have been like though once he caught a glimpse of it through Sebastian he realized he may not really want to know.
“Straight shooter I see. You’re brother did warn me about that,” he chuckled jovially for a moment while looking down at his clipboard. “Unfortunately, as an answer to your question, it will still be quite a while until you can be released. We’d like to keep you in our care for about two weeks, give or take a bit.” Sherlock let out a small sigh if relief. He had feared it would be much longer.
When he first spotted John at the airport, his wild hair easily visible across the terminal as he waited eagerly for Sherlock at baggage claim, Sherlock fully prepared himself then and there to be arrested for indecency the second he could get his hands on the man. Airport security be damned.
John swallowed thickly at the idea of being allowed to touch any part of Sherlock’s skin, bruised or whole, and didn’t hesitate at the invitation. John knelt before the man, feeling a profound shift in their dynamic as he positioned himself on the floor at Sherlock’s feet, the humidity from Sherlock’s overheated body radiating out towards him in a wave. It was a heady moment, and John hoped that Sherlock could feel the definite change in the atmosphere around them - it was impossible to miss and Sherlock was a very observant man.
The two men breathed in tandem, their chests pressing against each other with each breath they took as they came down from their frenetic, arousal-drenched high. Sherlock’s forehead remained against John’s as he curled his body down and over him, his arms spanned out on the barre behind them. They separated their hips, Sherlock stepping back on his left leg, creating distance where he didn’t want it but understanding the need to not have a blatant erection when the rest of the company made their way into the studio in less than ten minutes. He wouldn’t dare move from their little cocoon until John willed it, though, and refused to stop nuzzling his nose along the length of John’s, breathing in the scent of his skin and feeling the warmth of his body meld with his own.
“Christ.” John dropped his head back against the chair. The sight of Sherlock studying him with pin-laser focus was startling and unnerving and so completely arousing to John he needed to look away just to catch his breath. This man, who had never cared to even look at another man’s penis before, was choosing to give his attention to John, to lavish his affection on John. He couldn't imagine how he had ever gotten so lucky.
John grinned at the sight of the lith, wild thing before him melting because of his touch. Sherlock was beautiful and unguarded and trusting John with his body, and the longer he allowed this moment to last the more John wanted to remember this secret, stolen time they spent together. Looking up the long line of Sherlock’s leg towards the exposed skin of his taut, muscled torso, John swallowed thickly, his throat dry as he took in all he could visually consume of the man without actually devouring him whole. No, remembering wouldn’t be a problem.
Sherlock actually looked startled at the question, a rare expression for him. He blinked and then nodded, his eyes darting to the case that had been left open on a back bookshelf, his brows furrowing at the sight. Mrs H was rearranging his things again, it seemed.
“I do hate repeating myself, but I will just to relish the look on your face. Irene is the one who drugged me. I let her. She thought she was fooling me. Giving me a bit of a ‘helping hand’ or whatever it is she said I needed as she handed me the shot of tequila since she insisted that I was head-over-tea-kettle for John in the first place. I watched her slip the pill into my glass and pretended to be too drunk to notice. I. Let. It. Happen, Mycroft. I wanted to feel free from all the goddamn pressure you put me under. I wanted to feel loose. I wanted to live for one bloody evening. I wanted to finally know what it felt like to get fucked and I wanted John Watson to do it.”
“What are you doing?” John rasped, his whisper harsh and frantic as Sherlock nipped his ear with sharp, determined teeth. Somewhere in the audience, a person whistled at the display.
Sherlock pushed on, emboldened by the secure feel of John’s weight on the mattress once more. “You’ve made a series of decisions with a countless number of possible variables and divergences over the years. Any one of them could have steered you away from applying for a temporary position with the company that day back in June. Even if some of those decisions have caused you pain in the past, the selfish part of me can only feel satisfaction, because the end result is you with me in this bed, and for that, I’m grateful.”
John’s statement fell on deaf ears as Sherlock took the man in, enjoying the unique view from the vantage point of the carpet. John's shirt was hanging open, exposing his tan torso. Sherlock licked his lips.
“Good. Then would you please?” She held up her teacup, expectant. Mycroft dutifully picked up the silver pot from the middle of the table, covered in rich, white linen, and poured her a fresh cup.  He then took two biscuits and a marmalade and bacon sandwich from the tiered tray, ignoring Sherlock’s continual snickering.
Sherlock sprawled on the floor, his long limbs extending in every direction, each one reaching farther on the cool wood, seeking any relief possible from the unrelenting heat. A pool of sweat rested languid and still in the dip of his collarbones, the moisture of his exertion clinging to his skin like raindrops on the soft velvet of strawberry leaves. He ran a hand over his forehead, feeling the damp drag across his forearm, pulling at the downy hairs, and wishing so desperately for a flannel or a shirt or some form of cloth to sop up the puddle he’d turned himself into during the course of rehearsal. He internally dammed Mrs H for always refusing to utilize the air conditioning in the summer months, insisting that it was bad for her dancer's muscles. The fact that they would all eventually pass out from heat stroke didn't seem to enter into her reasoning.
Sherlock could feel the piece coming to an end, and listened as John played two chords over and over again, teasing them out into softer and softer beats, dancing between two fingers. Sherlock drifted towards the gentle sound, chasing the last vestiges of his self-control along with the dwindling music. He leaned in down over John’s back to watch his left hand play out the final notes, his arm resting over top of the piano with his free hand balled into a fist at his side to keep from touching John along the point of hair at the back of his neck like he’d done all those weeks ago. Now, he wanted to nuzzle his nose into that same spot and drag his tongue up along the back of John’s ear to taste the hidden skin, Mycroft be damned.
John sighed and looked down at the floor before lifting his eyes and staring directly into Sherlocks gaze. He looked nervous and his hands were perfectly steady. A dead give-away for when John was feeling anxious.
“It really is good to be back. It’s not really the same outside of Baker Street, is it?” Sherlock shook his head. He had been thinking the same thing. Although they may be fine and perfectly functioning outside of the doorstep to 221B they were both the most themselves when they were here. Just the two of them up and away from the rest of the world.
This one had been a strange mix of Afghanistan and Sherlock mixed together and it had done a wondrous job of knocking the breath right out of John.
He remembers Sherlock. How he had tracked Moriarty’s every step with the Browning, only dropping his stance when the door had closed tight.
“I see a man who is scared to move on. Someone who isn’t ready to disconnect from his old way of living. It’s natural, John. It’s natural and it’s normal, but it’s not healthy. Sherlock is gone and you need to accept that. There is no sense in sabotaging the rest of your life in penance for something that wasn’t your fault in the first place. You can’t go on punishing yourself for another man’s actions. I’m sure that’s not what Sherlock wanted for you when he made his decision.” A heavy silence follows her mini-monologue and John is just left staring at her, his mouth opening and closing as if to send something back her way but no words leaving his mouth.
times. Open, close, open, close, open, close. He did this over and over and he didn’t know why he even bothered because it never bloody helped and his hand was
“Eithers fine,” he probably wouldn’t answer her either way. Answering text messages or phone calls felt like a catastrophic amount of effort lately.
. The most awkward he had ever seen the man was when they had started a case for his old University mate Sebastian, and he used the term ‘mate’ lightly.
He took another drink and shook his head, partly because of the strong flavor and partly to shake the thoughts of his best friend out of his head. He needed to stop thinking about it; he needed a distraction. Out of habit John grabbed his laptop from where it rested on the coffee table and opened up his blog which had the exact opposite effect he had wanted it to have on him. He opened up the most recent blurb he had written which was from the 5
“Well, enough of this.” Mrs. Hudson proclaims in her sternest (though still gentle) tone. “Have another cuppa and tell me about this new
“He was the most accident prone bloke, as well. Not clumsy, don’t get me wrong, he was bloody graceful enough he just didn’t care to avoid things you know? If he was doing some kind of mad experiment with an open flame you can guarantee I would be applying burn cream on him later. If we were chasing a bloke through London and he climbed over a fence there’s no way he wouldn’t walk away with a pile of cuts. I must’ve went through hundreds of quid worth of plasters while I lived with him.”
“No!” Sherlock reacted without thinking, already missing the warmth of John’s hand. “You don't have to… I well. You can put your hand back. It’s… nice.”
The pub was a small walk away from the tube station and John found himself enjoying the short stroll. The weather was crisp and fresh in stark contrast to the stuffiness of Baker Street. He’s also thankful for the excuse to work off some of his excess energy. It’s been a long time since he’s gone out to the pub with a mate and even though it’s just Lestrade he feels anxious nonetheless.
They get through almost the whole date without and muss-ups but then dessert comes she brings up the one thing he desperately wanted to avoid.
“Hello.” John smiled back, still feeling a tad out of breath from his rush but starting to relax now that he was here.
“Well you did take your sweet time getting here.” Greg fell into the empty chair next to him and grimaced.
He’s less giving with personal information, mostly because he doesn’t really have anything good to share. He tells her about his stint in the army. He tells her he has a sister though they don’t see each other often. He works at a clinic in downtown London, though he’s currently on leave. His favourite sport is football. He prefers whisky, though he likes scotch from time to time. He isn’t big on sweets and would prefer a good meal to a good dessert. Unless it’s apple pie.
By the time he is fully ready and out the door he was already well on his way to inebriated and looking forward to his date. He stumbled a bit going down the stairs but caught himself on the landing. He went to giggle but he shook it off. He couldn’t act like this in front of Mindy. He had to get his act together.
“Yes. I was.” They both fell into silence, John taking in Sherlocks answer and Sherlock cataloguing John’s reaction to it. John had done an impressive job of keeping a pokerface. He looked deep in thought and outwardly stoic but Sherlock had dedicated more time than he would ever admit to cataloguing all of John’s many facial expressions and emotional tells. Under the stoic façade John looked vulnerable.
When he calmed down his mental rage to actually focus back to the present situation he saw that Ella was smiling. Bloody fucking
“How exactly is that?! Because from where I’m sitting Sherlock, it looks pretty darn alike.” His earlier stoicism was gone now, replaced by snapping anger.
By the end of it both Harry and Sherlock were shouting insults at each other and John was ready to wring her neck. Which, of course had led to another one of their huge rows. He later found out she’d only been so crabby that night because she had recently relapsed and was having a downright awful time not showing it to John. That little bit of insight had come from Sherlock later on once they had gotten home. John hadn’t the energy left to even lash out at him for it.
a right prick. Though he supposed one of the reasons he had always insisted him and Sherlock weren’t a thing was because he found the very notion completely unbelievable. Not on his end, obviously, but rather on Sherlock’s end. Sherlock was brilliant. Gorgeous, passionate, funny, even charming when he wanted to be. Sherlock was like a hurricane, a true force to be reckoned with and what was John? A washed up old vet with nothing but a crummy bedsit, a psychosomatic limp, a raging case of PTSD and an estranged sister he never spoke to. John hadn’t stood a chance and he wasn’t delusional enough to think otherwise. John had always been amazed that Sherlock had even bothered to look at him. He found that even while they were living together, working together he was always waiting for Sherlock to grow bored of him. To finally get tired of the old, broken army doctor and move on. Maybe find a new flatmate. Someone younger, prettier, more interesting. Less damaged. This had never happened of course and now he supposed he would never find out if it would have. John still didn’t know if this was a blessing or a curse.
The fact that Sherlock sought out John’s presence in the room didn’t factor into Sherlock’s assessment, since personal error rarely came into play with his musings. No, John had purposefully sat in such a way that he was always easily spotted in the room no matter where Sherlock stood, and if Sherlock happened to place himself in positions that allowed a clear sight line to John’s spot on the piano bench, well then, Sherlock certainly hadn’t done that on purpose.
He sat down not an hour later at the cream-linen table in the ancient chair and let the waiter drape a napkin over his lap with an overindulgent gesture he didn't much care for but allowed, and finally fixed his brother with an icy stare. The scene felt much like it had all those years previous upon Sherlock moving into the dormitories of the Upper School on Floral Street. Part of him longed to return to those innocent beginnings, but a larger, more rebellious and dominating part of him wanted to scream and fly as far as he could away from London and all of its mist and fog and conspiracy.
Sherlock looked slightly terrified at that confession, a racehorse about to spook. John backed him into the middle of the crowd slow and steady, his arms tightening around him, their bodies pressed flush together, sweat mingling, hips moving in an easy rhythm.  It felt so good to John, so smooth and natural to guide Sherlock in this silly excuse for a dance considering they were barely able to move with the press of the crowd.
If y'all would like to watch 'the fourth movement' of NY Export: Opus Jazz that was mentioned in this chapter (and why perhaps a somersault in the middle of it wouldn't throw an audience) here's
“I want to learn,” was all Sherlock said, and John dropped his head with a groan. This man was going to give him a heart attack sounding so eager and looking like he did with all his strong-willed defiance and vulnerability mixing together to create the impossible combination of emotions that only Sherlock could wear while still holding his head high.
John cautiously picked up one, black-socked foot and rotated it at the ankle, stretching and massaging it in his strong, sure hands, which he was surprised to notice, weren’t shaking like he thought they would. Sherlock slumped down further in the chair at John’s touch, his head lolling from side to side slowly on his shoulders, his throat vulnerable and exposed - permission given, it seemed.
The ache of waking with a hangover clung to John's bones the next day, and the day after that, and the day after that. The hazy heat of the summer, combined with the dull throb of his head all blended together in a lovely mix of misery. John adored Mrs H for bringing him into her wonderful, whiskey-filled world of history and whimsy, and simultaneously hated her for allowing the torture of being so close to Sherlock and yet not having any resolution on that end to continue beyond their time in the rehearsal studio.
“No, I don’t. I just know when to muck something up as a bad job.” His hand is back to flexing. Open, close, open, close, open close.
It’s that thought that pushes him to lift up the fork and take a bite.  It tastes great, just as can be expected of Mrs. Hudson. The potatoes are smooth and creamy and the meat is tender and savoury and the vegetables taste sweet.
John let out a sharp hiss at first contact and threw his head back, nearly bashing it off the wall. Jesus fuck did that ever feel good. It had been so long since he had touched himself, and even longer since he’d enjoyed it that just his hand resting on his engorged shaft felt like a bloody dream. Experimentally he ran his hand down and up in one smooth movement, feeling the way the hot silky skin slid as he jerked himself off. He usually didn’t like it dry, preferring lube or even spit but right now he felt as if he were seconds away from orgasm regardless of the method. Plus, he suspected that if he moved his hand off himself long enough to wet it he may
He could hear the mans shoes clacking closer to him when all of a sudden he felt a harsh yank to his hair and the burlap sack that was covering his head was jerked off pulling more than a few hairs with it and bringing stinging tears to his eyes. The lighting in the room was low and his eyes adjusted quickly to see four chairs and their inhabitants circled around him. Well, he supposes, on the bright side he won’t have to wait twelve hours for people to notice he’s gone missing. John, Lestrade, Sally and Anderson were all tied to metal chairs and none of them looked particularly happy to be there. John was furiously tugging at his restraints and rubbing his wrists against the abrasive rope until they were raw, staring at Moriarty and him with an intense rage that Sherlock had never seen on the good doctors face before. Lestrade was pale and looked as if he was going to be sick, looking at Sherlock with that paternal doting and concern Sherlock had long since come to associate with the DI. Sally also looked pale but more in control than the rest of them, resigned even. Then there was Anderson, who was really just a complete mess, shaking and sniveling into his gag. Sherlock was ripped out of his thought process by the now far-too familiar sets of arms and hauled into his own chair, although unlike the rest of Moriarty’s hostages he wasn’t tied down. Instead he felt Moriarty come up behind him and wrap a smooth hand around his throat. The detectives hand twitched and he was prepared to whirl around in his seat and send a hard punch right into the consulting criminals face but was stopped dead in his tracks by a soft tutting right against his ear.
“I… I don’t know if I can promise something like that.” He answers honestly. “But… knowing the profound… psychological effect it has on you, and taking in the fact that friends are supposed to help the other I will try to behave differently should it ever occur again.” The visible relief that washes over John after this sentence is gratifying but all too quickly wiped away by what Sherlock adds to it. “But I would still never allow you to lose your eye sight or life for my sake.” John let’s out an all-suffering sigh and opens his mouth to speak but Sherlock, feeling a surge of righteousness, cuts him off. “If you had been in my position today can you honestly say you would have acted any differently? If you had been sitting in my chair instead, facing the decisions I was faced with, would you have told Moriarty to go ahead and blind me instead?” Sherlock can see his words hit John. The army doctor looks gutted. Before he even lowers his head and reluctantly replies Sherlock knows what his answer will be.
John shakes his head and frowns. “No, Sherlock liked to be admired for his cleverness, sure, but he hated attention like that. Events, Holidays, get togethers. They were never his thing.”
“For God’s sake isn’t this enough now?” he nearly groaned as he heard Lestrade’s voice. Didn’t he realize he was just unnecessarily dragging this out?
Either way Sherlock knew he could only lay there and brood for so long. Whether he wanted to or not he would eventually need to open his eyes and face the situation head-on. Best to rip it off like a plaster. Get it over and done with.
In moments like these it was far too easy to imagine that Sherlock was just behind this door. It was too simple to trick his mind into thinking that day at Barts’ never happened and his best friend was just locked up in his room in one of his infamous strops over a lack of good cases. Sometimes he even liked to imagine the detective had finally given into his dreaded transport and allowed himself to get some much needed sleep. John closed his eyes reverently and allowed the all too comforting image from in his mind of Sherlock pacing the room filled with restless energy only too inevitably collapse onto his soft mattress and fall into a deep sleep tangled in his posh, cushy blankets. It felt so real in that moment that John swore he could hear the sound of his friend rolling around in a sleepy attempt to get more comfortable or the deep breathing or soft sounds he would make in his REM cycle. With his eyes still shut John stepped forward and gently turned the door handle, only opening his eyes after he had fully stepped into his friends room. When he opened his eyes they immediately darted to the bed, searching for the familiar sleep-ruffled form he had so expertly tricked himself into believing he would see, Of course, he didn’t. All he saw was a neatly made bed which was painfully empty and had been for a very long time.
.” The words sounded ridiculous coming out of John’s mouth. Of course he could have done what Sherlock did. John was the most selfless, kind man John had ever had the good fortune of knowing. If he could do it John most certainly could have, he would’ve no doubt done it
Sherlock clenched his jaw tight and decided to just power through it. He was going to have to do it no matter what, so he might as well just get it over with. Deciding on what seemed like an innocent enough place he brought the torch down onto his bicep. While he had been cutting himself he hadn’t made a sound, he kept his eyes wide open and trained on his task almost calmly, that’s not what was happening right now. He could feel his skin burning and bubbling under the intense heat. His eyes weren’t shut but they were squinted in pain and every half a minute or so he would let out a groan or a gasp. After his right bicep had had enough he moved onto his left and repeated the process. By the time Moriarty told him his five minutes were up he had burn marks and blisters all along the tops of his arms and shoulders. Even though the torch wasn’t there anymore the burning feeling along his arms only seemed to intensify as more time passed. He was suddenly strangely grateful for the gag, he didn’t want to cause the others any more distress than they were already going through and the wadded up fabric did an excellent job of muffling his groaning.
Sherlock was used to being kidnapped. Hardly a week went by that John or himself weren’t blindfolded and taken somewhere against their will, whether it was by criminals who were out to kill or injure them or Mycroft to be his nosy self and offer up some horrendously boring case. In other words neither man was new to being kidnapped. So, when two men jumped Sherlock in an alley and proceeded to try and wrangle him into the back of a van it felt almost tedious to the detective. Although he didn’t let that stop him from putting up one hell of a fight. He kicked and thrashed and punched, at one point he actually bit one of them. They still ended up getting him stuffed ungracefully into the van but he felt a smug pride fill him that he had at least gotten some good hits in.
“Christ Sherlock, I could’ve told you that!” Lestrade piped up beside them. Sherlock gave him a half-hearted glare, though he knew it didn’t hold the ice it normally did.
“I thought so, yeah. But I suppose I was wrong, wasn’t I? Because if I did he wouldn’t have ended up with his head smashed in, would he?” His voice was bitter and hostile. Full of all the self-loathing he had been marinating in since Sherlock had left him.
A lump formed in John’s throat and he clenched his teeth before turning around and heading back to his room.
It had been so long since he’d seen himself like this, strained and desperate and hard as flag pole that he couldn’t help but just… poke it. He actually poked it, almost as if to make sure it were real. It definitely felt real. God. He felt like some fair maiden on the morning of her wedding night seeing a morning wood for the first time, but he couldn’t help but be mystified by it. He had drank over half a bottle of whisky the night before as well, which was, well, unprecedented. He didn’t think he had ever woken up this hard the morning after drinking that much.
He gulped down the remainder of his victory drink and started to his room to get ready. He walked straight up the stairs, not even bothering to look at any doors that led to what he knew were empty rooms. What was the point? He knew nothing was going to be behind that door, so why give it the energy?
“Was that really necessary?” Dr. Richards spared him another look of pity and it made Sherlock’s insides curl.
“No. No, I won’t let you. They are your eyes Sherlock do you know how valuable those are? Not just to you but to all the people who you help with them. How will you solve all those cases without them, huh? How will you see some tiny seemingly insignificant clue on a victims shoe and tell Anderson what an idiot he is for not noticing it?” Tears were now welling up in the doctor’s eyes, dangerously close to spilling over and rolling down his flushed cheek.
“I’d better go. I think we should end this session early.” Ella seemed to contemplate this for a moment, her calm stoic expression she had perfected for her career placed perfectly on her face and John hated it. He hated her and her passive fucking expression and her annoying invasive comments. He was so tired of people digging around in his head, acting like they knew everything about him. He felt violated and vulnerable and like he just wanted to run away and get out of here.
He hadn’t even unzipped his trousers and yet he was hard as hell. His prick was full of fresh, hot, flowing blood and need. He was dying to rub against something, rut hard and fast against the nearest object until he found that flood of endorphin fuelled release he was gagging for. He felt primal and strong and horny as he’d ever fucking been. Alcohol, and blood and lust were all flowing through his body making him desperately
He continued calling out but the invisible force wouldn’t relent. A sharp buzzing filled his ears, he looked around frantically to try and find the source but there was nothing around him anymore. The noise kept getting louder and louder until it seemed as if it were splitting him open.
“Oh, no trouble,” she assures giving John a delicate pat on the shoulder. “The least I can do really. Besides, I’m sure you two will need to do some grocery shopping. I doubt anything in your flat will be good after all this time,” she rants and raves, excitement and life flowing through her words as she heads inside to retrieve refreshments. Though as it turns out, they needn’t have worried about the food situation. As soon as they climb up the seventeen familiar steps to 221B they find a basket of fresh fruit, bakery bread, and vibrant vegetables sitting on the kitchen table along with a card.
When John wakes up he’s sweating. His whole body is coated in it, but it’s not the cold sweat of nightmares it’s hot and insistent and seems to be coming almost entirely from between his legs where a throbbing erection is standing proudly. John sits up, knocking over the half empty bottle of whiskey, his hand still holding on tight to Sherlock’s shirt and looks at it in horrified awe.
“What are you doing, John?” He had been expecting angry accusations, passive aggressive comments, an immediate pink slip. He hadn’t been expecting the desperate, tired question. He had no idea what to say to that.
say. He wanted to take back every time he had called him heartless or inhuman. The thing he wanted to take back the most though was his very last insult, which just so happened to be the last thing he said to him before he went up on that bloody roof. He had called him a machine, except that couldn’t be true. Machines didn’t throw themselves off roofs. An image of glassy blue eyes and brown curls stained with red flashed in front of his vision and made his hand clench the glass and his left hands tremble worsen. Those eyes would haunt him forever; the ones that used to be so full of life and seemed to look right through you down to your soul had turned glassy and vacant. Those eyes had seemed all wrong on Sherlock’s face.
that vest off John had been everything he had never known he’d wanted. Sherlock had looked at him then as something precious, something worth protecting and John had never had anyone look at him like that. That was the moment when all his doubts about Sherlock’s emotional capabilities had faded. They had to, because no sociopath, no matter how deceptive and talented, could ever fake what he’d seen on Sherlock’s face that day.
“Your brother said a car will be here in a half hour so you can officially stop terrorizing the nurses.”
“Why though? Why didn’t you just let me take that round? I could have handled it Sherlock. I could have taken some of the weight off.” He looked so upset and Sherlock hated it. Lestrade should never look like that and especially not because of something
Once he get’s into the pub he makes a beeline for the bar and immediately orders a lager. The alcohol is sure to help his nerves, he thinks. He sits and takes a generous gulp of the beer before scanning the room. It’s a small cozy sort of place. Not the type of haunt that he normally finds himself visiting, which he’s thankful for. He was never the type to go clubbing or partying, save for the few crazy raves in Uni but whenever he did go out he tended to gravitate towards the more popular, well known bars. The ones he’d have no problem finding some bird to pick up. Now, looking around at the quiet atmosphere and small smattering of people clustered together absorbed in their own little worlds he knows Lestrade chose this place purposefully. And wisely. John wouldn’t have been able to handle the frantic buzz of a large crowd right now. He used to be able to find enjoyment in large crowds of alcohol flooded bodies. He would bask in the happy buzz that washed over everyone in the room and felt himself get almost as intoxicated just by the energy in the room as the alcohol flowing freely through his system. But nowadays he just found large groups of people overwhelming.
“Don’t.” In most contexts this word would sound harsh, like it rightly should in the current scenario, but there is no malice in Mindy’s voice. “You don’t have to say anything, John. I-I understand now I think, and it’s okay. Really. But, I think it would be best for us both if I left now.” John can do nothing but stare and eventually nod in agreement. How can he argue with something so logical right now? It’s more than he deserves in any case. John is sure that if this same situation had played out with any of his past girlfriends he would have been getting a hell of a lot worse of a reaction.
John instantly caught sight of the chill but thankfully misread it. “You cold? I could ring a nurse for another blanket.” Sherlock shook his head.
She gave him an understanding smile and small wave; he noticed her hand was no longer shaky. “Yes, of course! Um, thanks for the number. I’ll call you later? Or text?”
The choice he had to make was obvious and so without a word or even a glance in his restrained friends direction he lifted himself out of the chair. As soon as he stood up he nearly tipped back over, but thankfully managed to get his footing back before he crashed onto the hard pavement flooring. He took a deep breath both to steady and prepare himself before very slowly lowering himself onto all fours. He tried to be as careful as he could of his injuries but his whole body still cried out in agony as he stretched it into the far from natural positioning. His hands and burns hurt the worst of all, his shoulders being stretched and twisted so the charred skin got even further deformed and his fingers pressing hard into the cold floor to keep his balance and help guide him over to where his tormentor awaited him. Slowly and steadily he crawled over to wear Moriarty stood, haughty and proud in his bespoke suit, such a sharp contrast to Sherlock who was bloodied, beaten and only half dressed. He tried to ignore the flaming humiliation he felt. Each small baby step forward felt like it took several hours and Sherlock felt as unsteady and unsure of his movements as a small toddler just learning to crawl. After what felt like a small eternity a pair of black loafers entered his field of view. He stopped crawling and stayed kneeled in front of Moriarty waiting for instruction. If Sherlocks blood wasn’t so busy rushing out of his body he’s positive he’d have a heavy blush coating his face just about now. The pure humiliation of having to be in such a compromising position was almost worse than the physical torture he had just been through.
“You’re disgusting.” Sally piped up. Ugh! Why couldn’t they all just let him get this over with quickly?! All this anticipation and waiting was making if far harder than it had to be.
“You and me both, mate.” They share a smile and out of nowhere Sherlock feels an uncontrollable wave of affection burst through him at the sight of this lovely, fierce, caring man so determined to show Sherlock kindess. He loves John Watson so much in this moment it is like a tangible
“No way, not with all that blood loss. You must be feeling lightheaded enough as it is.” John did have a point. He was rather dizzy and even just standing still he could see a few stray black dots swimming around his vision and hear his blood pumping in his ears. Sherlock was nothing if not stubborn though and began to walk anyways. The first two steps were relatively fine, just a bit of swaying and nausea but on the third the black dots came back with a vengeance and completely engulfed his sight. He felt himself fall forward and tried to prepare himself for the hard fall that awaited him but two strong pairs of hands managed to grab him just in time.
Before the army he had been in excellent physical shape. He had played rugby all throughout his school years and somehow managed to keep up a decent workout schedule while hectically finding his way through med school. He had always had good muscle on him and during his stint in the army his body was at it’s prime. Everyday they ran drills or did training his body would be pushed to the limit and it most definitely showed. After he was discharged he had started getting a little weaker, recovering from a bullet wound will do that to you, and after he’d moved in with Sherlock he’d gained back some of the lost muscle from running around London and taking down the baddies. Sure, he may have had a few extra pounds of softness around his belly from a more relaxed work out schedule and a bit too much takeaway but he had looked good. Healthy. Now he just looked drained. His whole body was slouching and the softness of his belly was gone completely. He looked skinnier than he could ever remember being. The skinny that came from too many forgotten meals and too much remembered pain. He couldn’t remember a time he found his physical looks to be more disappointing. Maybe he should consider going back to the gym.
