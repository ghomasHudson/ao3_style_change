He shook his head.  “One by one, the royal line dwindled.  Until Phillips was all that was left.  When he died-”  His mouth went tight.  “There was no heir, Captain.  There was just half a dozen nobles, all of whom wanted the throne and none of whom had a real claim to it.
Rhodey glanced at Tony’s face, his brows drawn up tight.  “She’s in the kitchen with Mrs. Parker, are-”
His Captain.  He smiled, and there was no humor in it.  At least Steve had made the right choice, when it came down to it.  When he came down to it, Steve always made the right choice.  “Yeah, that mortal thing, annoying,” Tony agreed.  He kicked a cabinet shut.  “So why didn’t you put him back where he belongs?”  He swept a tablet off of the workbench, savoring the way it smashed against the ground.  “Or is it too-”
Sam nodded.  “Sometimes we want things, very badly.  Things that are unlikely, or downright impossible.”  His head bobbed to the side.  “That kind of fantasy is natural, and even healthy, provided we can separate it from reality, and acknowledge that it is just that.  A fantasy.”
“I have that same song set as a ringtone for a certain very annoying archer.”  She slipped the phone out of Harris’ fingers, and he let her take it.  “I’d say, what’re the odds of that?”  Her eyes tipped up to meet his.  “Except he put it there.  And he’s a great one for repeating his jokes.”
“Sure, but right now, we’ve got men in your position who aren’t paying ransoms on their own children or grandchildren,” Steve said.  “So the idea that someone would go to all that trouble, all that effort, for a child who isn’t even yours by blood, with the assumption that you’d pay?   Or even that they could use him to lure you out?”
“But mostly yes,” Franklin mumbled into the beanbag.  He stared up at the movie, his face tense.  “So I didn't want to stay home.  Things are complicated.   At home.”
“Thanks for the heads up, but most people just say ‘good-bye’ and that means the same thing, you know that, right?”
“Yeah, but it's nice to hear it, you know.”
The customs officer stared at him, clearly unamused.  Tony was pretty sure the guy wasn't amused by much.  He wondered if it was an occupational hazard of customs officers, or if the sort of people who became customs officers just lacked a sense of humor in general.  Maybe it was on the employment form.  He wondered if he could sneak that into the StarkIndustries employment applications.
Tony slowed to a stop, his head tipping to the side as Steve darted through the front doors, his sneakers squeaking on the marble floor.  “One sec!” he called, and before Tony could say anything, he ducked into the coffee shop.
“Thanks for calling, have a good day, talk to you again soon,” Steve said, and stabbed the disconnect button over Bucky’s nearly coherent swearing.  Chuckling, Steve headed for the door.  Before he managed to make it there, it started vibrating under a fresh assault.  “Hey!  Stop trying to break down my door!”
“Which is why I’ll be telling him,” Steve said cheerfully.  He stopped in front of the boys.  “You little punks have anything to say to Mr. Stark?”
“It's less about the soup and more about wanting to mess with him while he's too feverish to fight back.”
There was a long moment of silence.  “Wow,” Carol said at last.
“That he has gone to settle the laws,” Fury said.  He took a bite, and chewed carefully before continuing.  “What laws, or where that settlement’s happening, we have no idea.”  He reached for a juice box.  “We’re hoping to get some static off one of our surveillance networks, but magic isn’t usually our wheelhouse.  No idea how long it’ll take even if we-”
Clint grinned.  “Don’t worry.  Darcy got you one, too.”
“She's a runaway.  Her parents are the ones who involved us,” Gyrich said.  He gave Steve a pleasant smile.  “They called and reported her missing, and the local authorities referred the case to us.  We assured them that we had the tools and the resources to find her, and they agreed.”
"Grounded," Tony told him.  "You.  Grounded forever."
"I'm not sure how much reassurance I can provide."
Before collapsing back into the familiar form of Doctor Stephen Strange.
“And that's just as good.  Just put on the glasses tonight,” Jan said with a smile.  “And see what happens.”
“You planning on asking, or waiting to be asked?” Luke repeated.
“How many of them are full of naked pictures?” Sam asked.
Jesse took it from her, her brow furrowing as she thought.  “Ah, I think that's one of Clark's,” she said.  “It never got published, because it's not particularly good framing, an' Duck said we weren't a damn tabloid.”
“I have a French Toast Casserole in the oven,” Phil said from the doorway.  He was carrying an insulated coffee pot.  Behind him, Clint balanced stacks of tea cups on a tray. “Clint has monkey bread.”
“You just, what?  Called and asked them if Tony Stark was there?”
DJ snuggled down in his nest of blankets, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.  "Don't care."
Steve made an inarticulate sound, his mouth pressed hard against the skin of Tony's throat.  Tony slid his fingers through Steve's hair, pleasure sizzling over his nerve endings.  Steve was heavy and hard against him, the weight of his body pressing Tony back against the wall, his hands everywhere at once.  Tony grinned at nothing in particular, or everything at once.  He wasn't sure.  Or maybe he didn't care.
She glanced back over her shoulder at him, the fabric of her scarves fluttering in her wake.  “I won’t fall,” she said as Steve pulled up next to her, Nomad dancing in place as he slowed down.  His tail flicked through the air, and Shuri leaned over to stroke a hand over his neck.  “Oh, you poor boy, you just want to run, don’t you?”
Tony watched, stymied, as he started to pick up the empty containers and crumpled napkins.  “What are you-”  Steve took the box out of his hand, and he started to laugh.  “I was eating that!”
"My car is at the curb," she said, tucking her bag under her arm.  "Shall we?"  Without waiting for a response, she turned on her heel, stepping briskly across the lobby towards the door.  Steve, caught off guard, had to scramble to catch up, falling into step behind her.
“And that's a no,” she said. She made an inarticulate sound of frustration. “Sam!”
“Identify target.”  The words shook the air, and the feed flickered.  “Identify.”
Steve looked back at his feet, not sure a conversation about jealousy was one he wanted to be part of, not when Tony was dancing with someone else.  Someone much, much better at it then Steve was.
“I never tried that with my own version of Cap.”
“I’m not a spy. I never have been. Seriously, ask Clint, he knows the Doctor Potts story. I’m a disaster.”
“That…that was something our Tony was working on shortly before he died. There’s obviously no pressure for you to share the same interests or investments, but I always felt that the idea showed a lot of promise. So if you’re interested we could spend today talking about what you’re imagining for you professional future here, and how S.W.O.R.D. might fit into that future.”
“Could you, uh—could you do me a favour? Could you just…keep talking? Not, I don’t mean, I’m not asking for intel or anything sensitive. Just, I just want—”
Over time, Sam has learned to distrust silence. At first, like most new recruits, he’d feared the unrelenting noise of warfare. The screams. The various sounds you came to associate with particular weapons—the deep boom of heavy artillery, the pop-pop of machine guns. The hum of vehicles moving. It was certainly an overwhelming soundscape to get used to.
“…I don’t know,” Steve confessed, shrugging before he remembered this wasn’t a video chat and Tony wouldn’t be able to see him.
“So you said fuck you very much.” He couldn’t remember if Pepper had answered this already, but Tony also didn’t need to hear her say it to know it would be true. No version of Pepper would ever have cowered before the worst members of the SI Board; she was smart, stubborn, and one of the bravest people Tony had ever known. Across from him, her smile was warm and pleased as she nodded, then paused to kick off her heels and curl her feet underneath her before she offered more of a reply.
“I know.”
(See the end of the chapter for
I hope you all stay safe and well, and that you're being as gentle with yourself and others as you can.
“Tony’s fine,” he grinned. “And I don’t want you working for SHIELD either, Kamala—can I all you Kamala?—not officially. You way too young, for starters.”
Which was all well and good, except that it would get right in the way of Tony’s plan to avoid Phil until he felt a little less awkward around the man. Something about their encounter nearly a week prior left Tony flushed and squirmy every time he let himself think of it for too long, and until he could figure out what exactly his problem was, he didn’t want to risk being around the man.
Steve watched Tony take it all in. He tried to imagine it through the eyes of someone for whom orientation hadn’t been a fundamental shaping force, but that kind of…what had Domen called it, denaturalization? It was harder than it sounded, just as challenging as envisioning a world without water or touch or the bright warmth of the sun.
Steve didn’t even have to make a special effort to seek her out. He and Pepper had coffee together every Tuesday morning now, a tradition he had come to heartily enjoy. She always brought the most delicious pastries with her, convinced that someone with Steve’s metabolism should take better advantage of the myriad of sweets available in the city. That day it was something called Brooklyn Blackout cupcakes (which were filled with chocolate pudding and covered in some kind of ganache.) Even despite his impatience to arrive at the topic of Tony, Steve still managed to eat three of the things before he was even done his first coffee. As he did, Pepper filled him on the latest changes to the Avengers Celebration.
“Yeah, I was there for that, and believe me if Tony is offended it will definitely not be about his religious sensibilities, it will be about how horribly not funny that joke was, Clint,” Natasha declared flatly. “Besides, I’m pretty sure he’s not religious. His Mother was, but he isn’t.”
Yay, an author question! *rubs hands*
SHIELD was exciting in a different way. Tony still had a lot to learn there, and he had definitely been right to insist on a lengthy transition into a leadership role. The organization had fallen so early in his own world that it had been more of an abstract idea, and a shady one at that, than a reality. Just that morning he’d sat in on an active mission Steve and Phil were running, and he’d been genuinely stunned to realize the scope and intricacy of the work, the number of factors that went into even the most minute details like the operative’s exact positioning and to which of the players they used formal versus informal pronouns.
“I can’t do that, Stevie. I made a promise.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh good, I thought you’d be gone longer, Agent. Listen, I think we need to remove the right shoulder-plate entirely, it’ll be a lot less aggravation to just bin it and since Rhodey’s not here to bitch I can add in some—oh.” Without being asked, JARVIS softened the music to a dull roar as Tony and Steve stared at each other. “Look, Cap, if you’re here to yell again do you think you could—”
“Sorry, we can—”
Tony’s kneeling pillow was already set up in front of Steve’s preferred spot on the couch. It didn’t even feel like pretending, really, the notion that his entire world could centre around Steve and the rest of the team. Already he could feel all of his concerns that weren’t about the inhabitants of the Tower becoming distant and muted, mere abstractions compared to the crisp clarity of serving Steve, being what and who he needed. He sighed happily and pressed his cheek against Steve’s leg.
‘Deal.  See you at nine.’
He knew he would.  But he could try not to.  He could try.
Tony froze.  “It hasn’t been a week already,” he said.
Steve took a deep breath, and reached up to ring the bells.
Steve refused to look at it.  “I don’t sing.”
“Yes, I will,” Obie said.  He checked his wristwatch.  “Because just a few minutes ago, one of the guards Stark Industries sent over accused one of the others of setting the fire.  And since the man he’s accusing is guilty, I have no doubt that the resulting fight will pull in any and all staff still left on the grounds.”
“My mother may have taken to her bed in hysterics,” Jan allowed, her eyes rolling up toward the ceiling.  “Which my father blamed on me.”
“And not smashing,” Bruce agreed.  His pajamas had seen better days, the blue fabric ragged on the cuffs and the shirt missing a button.  But he smiled at DJ when a blue and silver box was pressed into his hands.  “This for me?  Thank you.”
"This is some Romeo and Juliet style shit right here," Sam said from behind him, and Tony flipped him off without even straightening up.  Sam laughed.  "Right back at you."
The door opened before he could even climb the steps, Jarvis caught in silhouette by the lights of the foyer.  Rhodey jogged up the stairs.  “Happy said you had a delivery for me to make?”
“Glad to meet you, Callie.”  He leaned forward, staring into her eyes.  “Really.  Serious talk here.  You okay?”
“How much did you sleep last night?” Pepper said, cutting him off with ruthless efficiency.  Tony fell silent, and she waited, the empty air stretching out between them.  “We'll be there in ten minutes.”
“I’m not pizza,” DJ said.
Steve's head snapped in the direction of the coffee shop.  "I've never seen-"
“What happened, Jarvis?” Steve asked, pushing himself upright.
Tony gritted out a curse.  “Who the hell tattooed me when I was that drunk?”
Hammer leaned in; the possibility of doing something exclusive had him hooked. “Really,” he repeated. “And why not?”
“Any number of reasons,” Miss Potts said, lifting the napkin off of the basket.  “This household doesn't keep to conventional hours.  There's always someone up, and likely as not, they're hungry.  Clint doesn't like waste, so whatever odds and ends he has leftover from the day's meals, they'll end up in the soup pot.”  She stirred her tea, giving the sugar bowl a considering glance.  “And the deliveries start before dawn.  Any number of drivers and couriers end up knocking on the back door, and few of them will turn down a meal.”
“Tony!” Sue snapped, and Tony stopped.  “Why...  There's-”  She squeezed her eyes shut.  “Child.  I can't-  There's-”
“That tree was not my fault,” Peter said.  “Bruce-”
“Tonight,” Tony said.  “Or today.”  He hadn't gotten an exact plan from Steve yesterday.  Mostly for his own sanity.  “I'm letting him handle it.”
She tossed it back on the pile.  “I have so many problems,” she said, waving a hand through the air.  “I have two weeks to pull this together, and Tony's going to fight me the entire way, which was to be expected, but still I could do without his fussing so-”
“Coulson?” Steve said, and he didn't like it, Tony could hear the frustration in that simple word.
“I DID,” DJ said, and it was mostly the truth.  Well, it was close to the truth.
He blinked.  “Of course I do,” he said.  “I...  Sent them each a gift when they were born, right?”
Steve's eyes narrowed.  “It does,” he agreed.  “And I appreciate that you were there to help him.”  His eyebrows arched.  “But something's going on right now, and I'd like to know what.”
He knew that voice.  DJ scrambled to his feet, almost knocking the table aside in his haste, and Harris was right there, a few feet away, and Darcy was right next to him, holding onto his arm, and they looked just like he remembered them, just like he’d known them.
“Roll with it, kid, it’s not the weirdest thing you’ll hear if you keep hanging around us,” Clint said, handing Wanda a nametag that read ‘The Red Menace.’  She gave him a look, and he blew her a kiss.  His nametag was neatly printed with ‘Ask me about arrows!’
“So to speak,” Jesse said, sipping her tea.
Tony’s lips curled.  “Yes.”  He moved his queen.  “Why were you so fixated on it?”
“I love you,” Steve said, the fork still in his mouth, and Tony started to laugh.
Stane was clawing at his face, curses hissing from between his fingers as he writhed on the floor.  Jarvis lowered Tony to the chair, and Tony clutched the back of it, refusing to sit down.  “Stay there, Mr. Stane.   I wouldn’t mind shooting you, but I’d hate to ruin this carpet with a bloodstain.”
“Are they still mobbed up?” she asked.  “Is that why you can’t hack the fountains?”
“No, Jan,” Stark said, picking up DJ's ball off of the floor and tossing it back to him.
“Obie's handling a lot of things that-”
Steve nodded, doing his best to look disappointed. “I would, but it'd mean my job if I'm caught in a bar when I should be watching you.”
Bruce glanced at him.  “You okay?”
Tony scopped DJ out of his seat, heaving him up into his arms.  DJ twisted in his grip, his body a live wire of panic, and Tony just concentrated on holding onto him as he slipped down the row to the aisle.  Steve was on his feet, his face tight, and Tony shook his head.  “Stay here,” he said.
“So.  Lies.”  He heaved a sigh.  “Is there a name on this imaginary tray?  Like, am I going to get punched for helping myself?”
“Tony.”
Laughing, T’Challa did the same.  “Your Majesty.”  He thrust out a hand, and King Nicholas took it, dragging him in for an easy hug.  T’Challa thumped him on the back for a moment, then leaned back to consider him.  “It has been too long.  You look well!”
“We can leave.  We can come back later.  Another time, or to a smaller theater, or I can build a theater, the screen wouldn’t be a problem and the camera would really be the only problem, if we were-”  DJ was staring up at him, his brow furrowed, and Tony pulled himself up short.  “We can go.  I won’t be mad.  No one will be mad, DJ.”
Tony stared at it, his eyebrows drawn up tight.  “You’re sure.”
Tony rocked back in his chair, his head bent over the sandwich.  “Bet she’s just as brilliant here, as she is there,” he said, his voice deliberately nonchalant.  “And I’m always looking for new talent.”  The paper crinkled under his fingers, and he tipped his head to the side, checking the contents.  But he made no move to take a bite.
“Yes,” Rogers said.
“No one’s coming,” Bobbi repeated, and her voice was lower than he was expecting.  Huskier.  Like the rest of her, there was a masculine slant to that voice now.  “That’s my job.”  She stopped in front of Steve, holding out a gloved hand.  “Mockingbird.  I’m the fixer.”
Tony paused, the paper cup of cheap coffee that he'd been given when he'd gotten in this god forsaken line hovering inches from his mouth.  "We got shot down over your airspace," he said, his voice flat.  "By Doctor Doom."  He raised one tuxedo clad arm.  It had gotten through the whole mess relatively unscathed.  He wasn't sure how.  "He invited us to a party.  There were actual invitations and RSVP cards, it was-”  He shook his head. “We came to a party.  And then he decided to shoot at us."
“You didn’t say ‘please,’” Riri said, and Tony pointed at her.
Stark waved him off.  “Jarvis, as soon as Miss Potts gets home, do let her know that I'd like to speak to her, will you?”
Jan smiled.  “We’ll mount this.  If someone wants a kiss beneath the mistletoe, they can ring the bells.  If someone wants to give a kiss, they can respond.”
“I believe they are preparing for the reception,” Jarvis said.  “An event that you have made clear that you want no part of.”
His grip was firm and strong, and Steve nodded.  “I hope so.”  He tried to smile.  “You set me up.”
He paused, and then, in dire tones, he said, “No.  One.”
“We’re not repeating what happened last time.”
“Caller's choice, one supposes,” Tony said, grinning.  “What's up?”
Steve braced his arm on his upthrust knee.  “I’ve lived with worse,” he said, and pushed himself upright.
“My house, my grinder, let me just take it apart and see-”
DJ's fingers lingered on the cover of the book.  “Keep looking?” he asked, his voice cautious.
Two rooms, on the third floor, listed on the map, but grayed out, no title, no designation.  No indication what they were for, but still included.  Still part of the whole, even if they were kept apart.
He shook his head.  “Anyway, he looked at Nat, who, again, still hanging off the side of the library shelves like a cobweb, and goes, ‘how nice of you to offer, but really, I’m all full up.  The only open job offer I have is for a chef.’”  Clint stopped.  “Offhand thing.  She’s gorgeous, and he flirts, just, you know, as a matter of course, smooth talk comes natural.”
is remotely concerned about the fate of the universe. Now, I can’t say much on this topic directly, but I can show you something brief.
It was rare even now for the warm approval of his Dominants to drown out the ghost of Howard Stark in Tony’s mind. That night, though, that night it was pretty close.
Then he proceeded to stare at the screen, awaiting a response like a lovesick teenager with their first crush. Thankfully, at least, Clint didn’t keep him waiting long.
I hope you all enjoyed it. Thank you for taking this journey with me. I can't really express my love and gratitude for the kindness, support, and community you all helped create in and around this verse. Sharing it with you has been a joy and a privilege.
It was the first time Steve had ever said those words to him, and Tony knew his reply was not ideal. It certainly was not what someone like Steve probably imagined hearing in response to declarations of love. But from a man like Tony Stark it was as optimistic as it got.
“We should have them work in pairs like that more often,” Tony had suggested that morning. “Thor is impatient. Working with guys like Bucky forces him to either slow down and think it through or just keep losing. Whereas Thor’s strength forces Barnes to think like an underdog, which doesn’t strike me as necessarily his strong suit.”
50 chapters! Holy cow. This fic has been a wonderful ride.
SWORD is, of course, drawn from the comics.
The TV-watching exercise, Tony had to admit, was pretty informative. It conveyed so much about the casual, everyday ways that orientation influenced life in this universe, things he would never have even thought to ask. Like how bed frames tended to be made differently to accommodate a partner that was frequently kneeling or held in some degree of bondage. Or the way that collars held far more importance as symbolic jewelry than engagement or marriage bands, though both did exist. (But it was still rare and considered pretty gauche for the everyday versions of collars to be elaborate or visibly expensive.) And there was definitely a lot to what Bruce had said yesterday about Trues being put up on an almost creepy pedestal. They were the subjects of endless fascination on any kind of dramatic programming like soap operas, and the idea of a True bond was used to sell everything from kitchenware to luxury vacations. (“No matter what some chart says, she’ll always be your True love.” Blegh.)
And that was…rather a kind understatement. The Bucky Steve had known in the 40s had been a submission-inclined Switch who craved soft forms of Dominance. This had been perfect for Steve, whose original physiology couldn’t withstand harder forms of play even when he’d been tempted to try them. They’d spent endless nights tangled together, indulging in light bondage and gentle impacts and stuttered, blushing dirty talk.

has had several interactions with the Avengers to date (we learned in the main branch of the narrative that she helped build the photon shield for Captain Rogers, for instance); her orientational needs are unique following her accident, however she remains contracted to longterm partner Maria Rambeau.

“I don’t think it’s a terrible idea at all.” That…that at least got his attention away from planning dinner for the evening, and wondering whether or not Tony liked big band music and if he could dance. “I do think we need to discuss how to ensure all the work you’ve done to create a life for yourself not wholly determined by Tony Stark doesn’t go out the window, however. Have you been out of the Tower at all since you all got on the same page?” The best and most dignified answer to that Steve could manage was no answer at all. “Hmm. When Ms. Romanov pulled me aside to deliver her note this morning, she mentioned that you had all received some upsetting news about the previous version of Mr. Stark. How have you been coping with that?”
“I’ve got the team. And Tony, as much as he’ll let me. You stay focused on your mission, and preparing to start doing the really hard work when you get back. Because I am never doing this again, Steve. I don’t care what we have to do, I
“Dude, you stole his doctoral project?”
Without another word, without pausing one more second to let himself think about the commitment he was making, Steve spun on his heel, seized the ice bucket, and marched down to the ice machine at the end of the hall. It was grimy enough that he wouldn’t have dared exposed the open wound of anyone who wasn’t enhanced to the contents, but for today it would do. He stomped back to the room, lifted Peter’s hand up onto the bed so it sat above his heart, and shoved it not entirely gently into the bucket of ice. Peter made to swear at Steve, maybe even hit him again, but Steve shook his head.
“Stimulates sexual desire,” Tony interrupted impatiently, yelping when Bruce picked up an eraser from one of the desks and chucked it at him.
“The team. They were…someone was always watching in one way or another. Nat had to sign off on any SHIELD missions I took that were classified over a certain degree of risk. Someone usually stayed close by during Avengers call-outs. Bucky…he went down and got DUM-E, made me responsible for him.”
I feel your first question shall be better answered through a brief view into the minds of one of the individuals you mentioned. Here it is:
“Fuck you,” he grunted, trying and failing to sweep Bucky’s legs out from under him. Bucky pressed him harder into the unforgiving concrete, his breath hot and fast against Steve’s neck. (Tony would be cold by now.)
Having actually entered the building, Pepper thought she was through the worst of the stress. Once she decided on a path, she usually didn’t struggle to remain committed to it. Then a red-faced and furious Clint Barton met her at the penthouse elevator.
I am running out of new ways to communicate how great you all are, and how lucky I am to have you all as readers, but I'm going to keep trying! Because you're just that fabulous. Thank you for your comments, questions, and kudos, and for sharing your wish-lists for the rest of the story. Based on those a lot of you are (hopefully) going to be pretty happy with what's coming!
“Your intent was extremely kind, but none of us would have chosen for you to have to digest that kind of news alone,” Coulson had said, hesitating before placing a hand on Tony’s knee. “Do you have any questions that we can answer? Even the media is hardly going to be crass enough to quiz you on the more immediate details of what happened," Pepper made a noise of disagreement there that Coulson ignored temporarily, "but if you need context or…or if you want to talk through any of it, we’re all at your disposal.”
When Steve stepped out of the elevator, Coulson was waiting for him in a crisp black suit, identical to what he would have worn to SHIELD. There was not a submissive line in his body, from the high, tight set of his shoulders down to his perfectly-shined dress shoes, which sounded an even, steady rhythm against the floor as he stepped forward to greet Steve. Well, greet was the wrong word—what happened next was decidedly more of an assessment. Coulson’s eyes moved in a familiar pattern along Steve’s frame, the same one he always used to inspect the team after missions. It was a slightly different order depending on which member of the Avengers he was examining; Steve’s most frequently injured or strained sites were his head, hands, and back, so unless there were immediately visible issues elsewhere, Coulson started there. He always saved actually looking any of them in the face for last, and even though Steve knew better now than he used to the types of tells Coulson would be seeking out (pupillary response to light and stimulus, tension in the muscles around the eyes and mouth, dryness of lips indicating dehydration if the mission had been extended or in a difficult climate), this last step always left Steve feeling unbearably, inescapably exposed.
"Captain Rogers.” JARVIS spoke in a voice that was as close to a whisper as he could approximate. Even so, Steve was surprised when Tony didn’t even twitch next to him; he’d never known the sound of JARVIS’s voice to not have his creator up and halfway to his feet, often before he even knew the full reason for JARVIS’s interruption. “Captain Rogers, either you will wake Sir or I must. You are in the early stages of top-drop, and you need his assistance.”
And that was the million dollar question, wasn’t it? Some of the team had been in favour of giving Tony a collar before they’d left the Malibu house. Steve himself had been all in favour, in fact. But then Tony had needed time to recover physically and emotionally from his first major punishment, and there had been Rhodey’s joining them to handle, and then Peter’s injury, and Tony’s ongoing efforts to learn about his own submission. It just hadn’t felt like the right time to ask for another major commitment, no matter how crazy it was starting to drive Steve to see Tony’s throat bare. (He at least still always had on one of the watches they’d given him, which did soothe the deeply possessive parts of Steve’s Dominant hindbrain.)
He threw himself into preparations for the pilot program, which would be pretty much ready to go as soon as matters with SI were resolved. There was a particularly complex inter-agency mission in Brazil that Steve ended up needing to personally oversee; Clint’s young protégé, Kate Bishop, had gotten herself involved, and Steve’s vouching for her (at Clint’s increasingly vocal insistence) was the only thing preventing her from being detained by at least two governments and three separate agencies. He made time to seek out Sharon Carter, too. She was tight-lipped about her relationship with Pepper, but she had seemed too relax once Steve wasn’t there to gossip, just to reassure Sharon that her presence at the Tower was wholly welcome.
On the other hand, it might make him more capable of giving the team what they needed. There had been a few times already lately when he’d been deep down in subspace that he’d wondered with a thrilled, terrified surge to his gut if maybe he was feeling the team’s Dominance differently, more intensely. The excitement felt like being right on the precipice of discovery, like the closest thing he’d ever found to the ecstatic glee he’d felt flying the Iron Man armour for the first time. He wanted access to the shared language that the bodies of those in this universe spoke without even trying; he wanted to stop wondering all the time what he might screwing up.
And speaking of last chapter, your comments were so incredibly kind and supportive. Thank you, team, and please keep them coming! I love knowing what you're enjoying, what lines you liked, which characters pissed you off or made you laugh, I eat it all up! (And you can also #AskStrange any questions you have, too!)
“How many is that, JARVIS?”
“You’re going to spend today with me. You’re going to stay in those cuffs for the morning; I’ll feed you breakfast, maybe we’ll watch a movie or something. And when Tony comes up, I suggest the two of you make plans for another date. My impression from what he’s let slip about the other universe is that on top of the choking, the other Thor spent a lot of his time off-world. So even though the other Steve hurt him too, for instance, he presumably has at least some pleasant memories too. He doesn’t have that with you, or at least not as much. So you two might need to put a bit more work in at the beginning just getting to know each other.”

Like if I was going to generate some kind of after-life version of you, which would be weird enough to begin with, honestly, I think I might have kept the beard. Oh fucking fuck. Am I honestly trying to decide whether we screwed up the fate of the world for a second time based on Cap’s facial hair? I am way more like my father than—”
What caught his eye, then, was not the ample evidence that the room had been untouched, but rather the few signs that seemed to suggest something to the contrary. The bed was made, but not with the crisp, clean lines that Peter had come to associate with professional cleaners. There was nothing personal on any of the shelves or tables, but the bottom drawer of the nightstand was slightly ajar. There was a faint mark on the top of the oak dresser that looked kind of like the ones that had once dotted the furniture in his and May’s apartment from when his aunt fell asleep with a candle burning. But that could easily be just a defect of the wood, couldn’t it? And the drawer, well maybe the wind had just kicked up or something. If Peter had learned one damn thing from the past few months, and especially from being right about Tony’s status, it was that asking questions when he wasn’t sure if he wanted the answer was a mistake. He closed Wanda’s door with an audible click and continued on his way.
Harley laughed, chastened by the reminder of his plans to rob Strange. He was still crying, too, but Peter could hear the relief in it, could easily tell how much comfort his friend had drawn from learning that Tony was alive and well, even if it was elsewhere. Peter recognized some of his own feelings in the sound. It was good, truly, to see Tony happy, to know that he wasn’t trapped in some kind of hell dimension or pocket universe filled with bees or something.
“Yessir.”
Phil did not like being made to wait, and Clint still thought his plan was awesome, but Natasha was able to distract both of them by beginning an epic rant about how her other self had never redacted her ‘Iron Man: Yes, Tony Stark: No’ report which, somehow, ended with yet
Content Notes (these are majorly spoilery, but there are also some heavy potential triggers in this one): Tony reveals the full backstory about the other Tony, Howard, and Fletcher (the SI Board member whose name he knew he recognized from somewhere.) It includes Howard using the soul stone to try to manipulate or 'cure' D/s Tony of any orientation, which caused irrevocable damage to his soul. It's certainly not meant to be a one for one allusion to things like conversion therapy, but there are obvious resonances and connections to those histories. If you need to give that section a pass, the most explicit discussion takes place in the paragraph beginning "The Howard in this universe manipulated the time stone too."
“—instead your own, far swankier, digs?”
The last thing Tony wanted was for it to be clear just how badly he wanted this, for both himself and the kid. He nodded, hit the button on the self-administered pain-killer, and was almost to the door when he stopped, wrestled with himself for a minute, and then added,
Still, they were all sincere in their efforts to repair their relationships with her, and she them, which made her unannounced visit to the Tower on a Thursday night (an evening she knew Tony usually spent alone) all the stranger. The real shock, though, was when the elevator doors opened and a metal suit, fashioned in the style of Iron Man but coloured in hues of blue and gold, proceeded her out of the elevator like a large metal bodyguard.
“I uh…I think we should probably try to keep orientation out of this as much as possible given the circumstances, sweethe—uh, Tony.” It made sense, Tony knew it did, but it still hurt like hell to seat himself between Steve and Rhodey when all he wanted was to curl up at his Dom’s feet like he’d done dozens of times before. Was subtonin really that powerful, he wondered, or was he just that far gone on Steve, on all of them? “I know I’ve had more time than the rest of you to digest this, and I promise that everyone is going to have a chance to say anything they need to say. But would it be okay if I started?” When no one voiced any objections, Steve nodded, squared his jaw, and turned to face Tony. “I owe you an apology.”
, for god’s sake. Coulson still didn’t speak, though in response to Steve’s quiet confession he stood and retrieved a familiar box from a drawer in the plum-coloured coffee table. It contained the metal spheres Phil usually used to start scenes as a submissive.
“Well, this is a first. I’ve heard you come up with a lot of ideas I disagreed with, Tony, but never one so goddamn stupid.” Tony flinched as if he’d been struck, because it felt worse than a physical blow to have this version of Steve, the man he loved and respected beyond anything, speak to him like this, even if (especially) Tony deserved it.
“I doubt that very much,” Steve said drily. Across from him, Bucky snickered and flashed a thumbs up in Clint’s direction. (On the rare occasions where those two were remotely submissive at the same time they amped up each other’s brattiness to the nth degree. It was as charming as it was terrifying.) “But to answer your question…well, I guess the only thing that was out of the ordinary happened a couple of days ago.”
“I know we’re still experimenting with what works with food. That’s fine, but I think we need to try a more active approach for a while, enough to set you up with some good habits and get your body accustomed to certain levels of nutrition. Could we agree that you’re going to make it to two out of three meals in the penthouse, and that I or someone else will hand feed you at least one of those? You always take more in that way.”
Rhodey was, at heart, an optimist. Despite his own rather more cynical view of the world, Tony was not generally inclined to try to persuade his best friend out of this mindset, given that it was the reason that Tony himself had ever made it out of the desert. But even he had to know that Tony’s being summoned by his entire team several hours after Pepper, Dr. Chimva, and Rhodey himself had briefed them on all the things Tony had been keeping from them couldn’t possibly be a good thing.
But instead of gratitude, Peter mostly just felt really, really angry. It kept him up some nights, the injustice of all of this a burning, acidic pit in his stomach. It wasn’t supposed to happen this way. Tony Stark wasn’t Ben, or Peter’s parents. It wasn’t just one stupid kid who needed him, it was a whole universe, and so he wasn’t supposed to die or even appear to have died, damn it. He’d done the brave, heroic thing and now he was supposed to—
“And how did you…master this feeling?”
On another day, Steve would have drawn this out. Would have talked to Phil and told him how good he looked, how excited Steve was to hurt him and fuck him and see him come. Today, he just let the belt rest on Coulson’s back long enough for Steve to get undressed, then picked it up again, doubled it and wrapped it around his fist, and then began to swing.
The 27th floor was in fact R&D. When Tony stepped off the elevator and was immediately confronted by a wall of windows overlooking a (mostly) familiar series of labs, he panicked and considered how likely it was that he could beat a path back toward the elevators before anyone realized the pseudo-ghost of Tony Stark was overlooking them. Then he caught sight of Rhodey and Pepper. They were sprawled across an orange loveseat that sat auspiciously in the hallway directly outside the largest of the labs, sharing a pint of bright green ice cream. When Pepper caught sight of him, she held up her spoon with that same mischievous grin from before.
Fittingly, it took another of those contributions, Howard’s only son and heir Tony, to decisively shift the public’s understanding. In a press conference Tuesday, Tony Stark revealed that his father had been the ringleader of a cover-up designed to avoid the startling revelation that the eight hour work day (which has, if anything, been officially and unofficially extended since the study was conducted) is too long for employees to spend outside of orientation headspace.
“Well which one is the best one?” Tony demanded, impatient. Magic had screwed him over enough, was it really so much to ask that it simplify his life just one time? Strange smiled, and Tony noted with irritation that there seemed to be a fair amount of sympathy in it.
“We can skip this if you’re busy,” he tried anyway. (God, they hadn’t even started yet and already he was squirming where he stood, that same confusing rush of humiliation and pleasure and embarrassment coursing through him as strong as a hit of the really good coke from the 80s.) Bruce spun on his feet, smiling even as a couple drops of tea escaped over one side of his cup.
“You’re right.” Which, the Steve in this universe had said several remarkable things in all the time Tony had known him, but that one honestly might win for most shocking. Steve, backing down from a fight? Steve, admitting he was wrong without first beating something (or someone) up?
“Why didn’t you safeword?” He’d demanded to know over and over again, pointing out with painstaking precision the numerous moments where it would have been smarter for Tony to let his Dominant know what was going on in his head. (Steve had also had to be forcibly held back by three members of the team from going after Sunset, but Tony was more worried about Natasha on that front, honestly. She’d been ominously quiet during the whole conversation.)
Tony was doing so well with so many of the attempts the were making to work toward a 24/7 dynamic that it was almost easy to forget how new all of this was to him, and how difficult he found accepting the degree of care and attention he was now faced with on a daily basis.
“Well, that suit of yours is—how do I put this delicately—it’s just a notch above a onesie. I’m assuming you might want something a little more advanced.”
“If you’re not here on his behalf, what could you possibly want with me?”
Moving through a space and a life previously inhabited by another version of himself often felt to Tony like a curious mixture of violation and recognition. Nothing so far, though, had felt so intensely like both those things as opening up the other Tony’s schematics for his team’s suits and weaponry.
It was only once they were in the car several hours later and Steve had the chance to glance down at his phone that he realized anything had come out of what he thought had been an idle comment. Tony had shared a folder with him that, when opened, revealed hundreds, maybe even thousands of pictures (new images were still being added.) They varied in both quality and focus; some were definitely the pictures people had taken on their phones during Steve and Tony’s dance, for instance. Others were much higher quality, and had to be taken by one of the official event photographers. (Steve had a vague memory now of seeing Tony talking to someone with a camera. There were so
He didn’t come back to himself until Phil touched his cheek some time later, smiling fondly. Clint was gone; it was just the two of them. It hit Tony again, that same sense of terrible gentleness he’d sensed in Phil a few nights prior in his office. Phil’s power as a Dom didn’t come from the threat of physical pain or punishment. What was terrifying and wonderful and so very fucking hot about him was how he could deconstruct your entire being with no hint of anything but overwhelming tenderness. After what might have been minutes or hours of sucking Phil’s cock with all his previous impatience abandoned, it returned now with a vengeance. Tony abruptly wanted to come, and wanted Phil to come, more than he’d ever wanted anything. His eyes watered, then widened with betrayal as Phil (when had he even gotten up?) tied his wrists behind him with a soft beige rope.
It was at least a few weeks old by the looks of things, but it had clearly been deep. And while most of it was on its way to scarring, there were a couple of places that carried the angry, red signs of recent infection that Steve had learned to recognize well during the War. He growled and stepped closer, dropping gracelessly to his knees to get a better angle. The skin didn’t feel any warmer than the rest of Tony’s body, which was as good sign, but up close Steve didn’t like how raw the skin still looked, like it was preparing to open up again at any moment.
“Did it upset you that much? The Domination?”
It seemed too dramatic for Natasha to say what she actually thought, which was
3 cups cold water
Everhart is a category 7 switch (inclined toward Domination.)
The very best part of all of it was that with Jane here, Tony could experience everything as both a magical and a scientific event at the same time. He darted happily between observing Thor himself (who was now sopping wet from the rain and apparently unconcerned about this fact—Tony was not complaining about the view) and reviewing the data that poured in through Jane’s screens tracking wind velocity and direction, precipitation, and a myriad of other factors. Every once in a while she or one of the others would shout a direction at Thor, but for the most part Jane just talked Tony through what they were seeing.
Peter tries Asgardian booze. Steve is forced out of denial by a surprising source.
Content Notes: (These are particularly spoilery, so feel free to skip if you have no major triggers.) Steve makes a somewhat sudden decision due to circumstances to step in and Dom for Tony in this chapter. Tony is exhausted and distressed, so his ability to consent is murky. Steve makes every effort to mitigate these issues (keeping someone with them, having others perform any particularly intimate acts, and absolutely no sex occurs), but if under-negotiated kink is an issue for you, it might be worth giving this one a miss. We'll see a lot more conversation between them in future chapters, so this will only be a temporary issue anyway.
Tony looked overwhelmed by the positive assessment; Steve’s smile threatened to split his face in two.
“But can’t we just try?”
The nickname was so warm and fond that Tony just barely bit back a sob. Clint smiled sadly and crossed the room to pull Tony in close for a hug. His grip was harder and more forceful than it usually was, something just on the edge of turning into a restraining hold rather than an embrace; after a few beats, Clint seemed to recognize that too; he released Tony abruptly and took several steps backward. Natasha slid up next to him, signing something so fast that Tony’s fledgling efforts at mastering ASL couldn’t follow.
me, just to make sure I’d be able to hold you steady and do exactly as I please with you.”
“I am not joining SHIELD. So if that’s why you’re here, and why you paid my bills, you can just leave.”
A laugh bubbled up in Steve’s throat. Of course. He wasn’t with SHIELD any longer; he didn’t need an agency-approved mental health professional. Tony would insist on some iron-clad confidentiality agreements, of course, he’d probably sic a whole team of his most vicious lawyers on this poor unsuspecting guy. And Steve would let him, because caring for Tony in every way was the best thing he would ever do with his life, and he was not about to deny his partner the opportunity to do the same.
“It's a cookbook with fluff pieces,” Tony said, from behind his coffee cup.  “Then there's the porn.”
Everything was gone.
He was a tall, reedy man with a shock of white hair and a startling resemblance to Mark Twain, and an easy smile. “All right,” he said, clapping his hands. “We're going live in twenty minutes, let's find our places, people.”
“Fuck all y’all,” she said with a grin.
Darcy was bouncing in place on one of the plush seats.  “I’m going to play a slot machine and ride the roller coaster and go to a buffet and eat nothing but dessert and take my picture in front of the stupid fountains and-”
“That's what Jarvis says.” Tony considered washing, but it seemed like far too much effort.  Instead, he just propped himself up against the wall and let the water pound down on him.  “He's usually trustworthy.”
“We can start there,” Jarvis agreed.
There was an unexpected tartness to the words that Tony didn’t know how to handle.  He looked down, at where his fingers pressed against his skin. “I think I had another..”  His fingers flexed, and he let his hands fall into his lap.  “Another attack.”
Rhodey's mouth fell open.  “You haven't told-”
Tony kept eye contact with her as he reached for a petri dish.  “I'm guessing the answer to that would be a solid no.”
“I'm afraid she had a meeting this morning,” Jarvis said.  There was a faint smile hovering around the corners of his mouth.  He held out a hand.  “But I'm sure that Mr. Stark will be pleased to hear what you've discovered.”
“I was an awkward, bony child with bad hair and a serious overbite,” Pepper said.
"Got it, I'm not going to hold you to this, just-"
“Also, she lives in space.”  The other eyebrow went up.  "Did you know that?  She lives in space."
“You specifically said, ‘give me a call,’” Alison said.
Tony stopped.  “You.  Are a chef.  And, like, I get it, you trained hard, you’ve got the fancy degrees and the title and the profiles in some in-flight magazine somewhere, but here’s the truth.  You’re a short order cook in a fancy fucking hat.  You feed people.  If you can’t do that, to the best of your ability, to the best of your creativity and knowledge and with all your skill, for every single person who sits down at your tables, then, really?”  He shook his head.  “You need to find another job.”
He tried to grab it back.  “Wait, give me-”
“Ain’t staff,” Happy said, as Steve nodded at Bill.  “Police.  City Hall sent him over.”
“We all right?”
Happy grinned at them. “I'll take the long way back, you kids have fun,” he said.
“You leading or following?” Luke asked Steve.  Steve stared at him.  “You...  Gotta figure that out.  You know that right?”
Steve smiled.  “I love you,” he repeated, because saying it was nice, it was…  Nice to say it, in front of their friends, and to feel it, down in his bones.  “Wish me luck.”
“Yes.  It is,” she said, her face expressionless.  “He didn’t, though.  Because it’s an Olympic sized pool, and after some quick and rough calculations and then calling Bruce and making him do the calculations over again, they-”
“Welcome,” DJ said, his lips forming the single word with care.  He looked up at Tony, and Tony reached out and ruffle DJ's dark hair.  Giggling, DJ leaned into the contact.  “Help?”
“I mean, that’s possible, but improbable, because I’m very competitive,” Tony said, his voice flat, and Steve choked on a laugh.  “There we go, that’s much better.”  He twisted his head to the side, just far enough to meet Steve’s eyes.  “So.  We had a tough couple of days, did we?”
“Then find a bathing costume,” she said.  “It’s as easy as that, Mr. Stark.”
“No, it doesn't.”  Steve held the door for her.  “How're you holding up?”
It was all so ridiculous that he had to laugh, or he’d start crying. “You can have the swiss,” he said, and Tony smiled back at him.
“Maybe,” Steve said with a grin.
“How is less important than why.  The old one came with news, of Strange and Clea, and various…”  Agatha’s eyebrows arched.  “Disturbances.”  She stood, folding her napkin into neat quarters and setting it next to her tea cup.  “As much as I have enjoyed the company, I think it best that I speak directly with Clea, especially.”
“Tony,” he wheezed. “If this whole thing is going to work, then there are going to be two absolutely unbreakable rules. The first is that you need to call me Tony.”
“The espionage lessons? You’re damn right I’m doing it. If Nat ever found what the two of you pulled—”
Abruptly, Bruce’s left hand moved from Tony’s thigh to cup his balls. The shock of the touch, while it remained entirely clinical, derailed pretty much every other thought process Tony had going.
We flash back and forth between the press conference and the team's preparations for it.
“They’re all under control.”
Steve wanted very badly to use the spray bottle on Bucky as if he were a poorly behaved cat. If the thing had been filled with water instead of vinegar he definitely would have done it. He settled instead for thrusting a package of toilet cleaning brushes at Bucky, paired with his most menacing scowl. Bucky outright laughed even as he saluted Steve and crossed the bathroom to kneel down in front of the toilet.
“Right in one, Buckybear,” Tony acknowledges.
“I’m still waiting for an answer, Tony, and I think you’re well aware that I don’t particularly care for repeating myself.” Steve let Dominance sharpen the edges of his tone that time, and crossed his arms over his chest. Several of the Switches in the room flinched, and Tony himself lost the whining, bratty quality his voice and mannerisms had taken on in favour of an almost matter-of-fact report.
“Take it from the handler of this team: none of you are low maintenance,” Phil advised with a wry smile. His hand tightened just slightly at Tony’s neck (the way a collar might if they ever—) “We don’t love that you’ve been through all the things you have, and I’m not going to lie and tell you that Dominating you isn’t work. But you let us
He stopped, a hand braced on the doorframe.  “Aunt May-”
“They did it to see how we'd react,” Fury said, his dark eye flicking in Steve's direction.  “I think it went according to plan.”
“I’ll be up to check on you in a moment,” May said, “and I expect I’ll find you in bed, with the covers tucked up under you chin.” Her eyebrows arched.  “Do I make myself clear?”
“Are you going to watch the damn video, Steve?”
Laughing, Rhodey extended a hand to Steve, who shook it.  “All seriousness, Steve.  Go to bed.  Things're quiet, and you don't need to lose sleep over it.”
"I'm sure he won't get distracted," Natasha said.  “Clint, is the pan ready?”
Clint thought about that.  Next to him, Natasha was laughing so hard that she might’ve been crying.  “Things are a little foggy, but yeah.  Yeah, I think that’s the general timeline,” he said at last.
“None taken,” Jarvis said.  “Sir, you do have an appointment this morning.”
“I was raised exceptionally well, I’ll have you know,” Tony said.
She took it, tucking her hand into the crook of his elbow, her chin coming up.  “Who needs sleep?”
Tony burst out laughing.  “Piece of advice from a man who's made a lot of mistakes, Steve?”  His dark eyes danced as he moved close, his body relaxed beneath Steve's hands.  “Never apologize until you have to.”
If they kept talking, and Steve knew they were still talking, they never stopped talking, but he could no longer hear them.  His world had shrunk, to those gleaming bells.
"I do apologize, sir, but you've already waived your right to a say in the situation," Jarvis said.  "Do finish your breakfast.  And don't talk with your mouth full, it's uncouth.”
It was amazing how much that hurt, it was a verbal gut punch that he hadn't been expecting.  Just like that, the haze of arousal was washed away, his skin going from flushed to icy cold in an instant.  “Tony-”
“I did think I was cute,” Rhodey said.  He looked at DJ.  “I'm not cute?”
“But will she?” Steve asked.
“Not really, no.”  But Rhodey closed his book, tucking it under his arm and turning his attention to the wing design.  He blinked down at it, then at Tony. “Tony.”
Harris took a deep breath.  “Uh-”
“Go,” Harris said.  He turned towards the registration desk, then immediately pivoted back towards Tony.  “And give me that.” He snatched the credit card from Tony’s fingers, giving him a look.  “Were you raised by wolves?”
Steve nodded.  “There's a boy there.”  At least he hoped there was.  But this, he could work with this.  His head was already spinning, possibilities unfolding so fast that he knew it was going to lead him nowhere but into trouble, but he was used to that.  He looked at Miss Potts.  It might be worth it.  “DJ.”
“He’s simple, Tony,” Obie snapped, and Tony stopped, blinking.  Obie’s mouth worked, his face suddenly florid.  “He’s of inferior genetic stock, and he’s-  He’s simple.”
T’Challa’s eyes were hooded.  “It was a concern,” he said.  He smiled at Steve.  “We have not known you long, but…”
“I find it works for me,” Steve said.  He moved the file to the bedside table, and slid down into the bed.  He wrapped an arm around Tony's waist, tucking his body up against Tony's back.  “You don't have to be charming all the time, you know.”
“And you popped the basketball,” Sam said, and Steve’s eyes squeezed shut.
The word was small and soft, barely audible in the echoes of noise from the other apartments.  Steve glanced over at the chair, where DJ still hadn't moved.  He took a deep breath.  "You know you can't," he said, setting his shoes aside.  "No one's going to let a single Irish cop take a kid."
“Excuse me, sir,” Natasha said, one eyebrow arching, “but we have both of them under control.”
“I expect you will,” Jan said.  “See you at dinner tonight?”
“Which am I?” he asked.
“The Council of Lesbians,” Jan said, her voice flat.  Natasha nodded.  “So.  Carol.”
Their fingers were barely touching, but somehow, it was enough.
“Oh, wait, I think I've got video on my phone,” Jane said, pulling away from her dance partners.  “I can show you!”
“Hey-” Tony started, but DJ just leaned forward.
“Just put it on my-” Tony started.
Sue braced her hands against the edge of the workbench.  "No, Tony," she said, very carefully.  "I haven't."
The blueprint rolled itself up, bouncing across the patio table and falling off the edge.  Pepper caught it before it could hit the ground, setting it firmly back on the table next to him.  "Excellent, that's exactly what I was trying for," she said, reaching for a chair.  Jarvis got there before she did, pulling it out for her.  She gave him a warm smile, sinking down into the seat.  "Thank you, Jarvis, that's very kind of you."
Darcy was wearing a pair of grey coveralls, folded down at the hips, with the arms tied around her waist.  A faded Black Sabbath t-shirt clung to the curves of her breasts, and a pair of welding goggles were pushed back on her forehead, holding her bangs away from her face.  The rest of her hair was twisted up in a loose knot at the crown of her head, held in place with two pencils.  Smears of ‘grease’ had been artistically applied to her jawline and neck, and across her left shoulder.  The outfit was finished with a pair of steel toed work boots.
He looked back to find Tony sitting on the edge of his bed, one hand braced beside him on the mattress.  Steve’s heartbeat accelerated, and he shifted in his seat, trying to ignore the way his body tightened at the sight. “Yes.”
“The first group of traders goes out a few days later.  And before sunset of the next day, they have returned to the city, right back to the council chambers.  And they say to my brother, ‘he will not go.’”  She twisted in her seat, one leg swinging under her.  “Which.  Fine.  We had not waited long enough, we miscalculated, he was probably too weak to think of a trip like that.  Simple miscalculation.  So several days later, another group of soldiers goes off to try again.
Tony’s eyebrows arched.  “And…  You approved?” he asked.  Harris’ mouth went tight, and Tony held up a plate.  “Bacon?”
“Okay,” he said, holding up his hands.  “Okay.  Let’s just-” He huffed out a breath.  “Let’s just get some rest, it’s been-  It’s been a hell of a day.”
“Baseball season’s over,” Rhodey said.  “Otherwise, that would’ve been fun.”
“You wanted me to,” Tony said.  He hooked a chair with one foot, dragging it away from the table and dropping into it, all loose limbs and easy grace.  He propped an elbow on the arm of the chair and rested his chin on fisted hand.  “Didn’t you?”
“I can’t do this,” Steve said to Pepper.  “I think we can agree that I can’t do this and move on with our lives?”  He glanced at the record player, set up just by the doors.  “I only agreed to come out here because I thought you needed help setting up the winter shutters.”
“Everyone except Peter,” Natasaha said.
“Mmmm,” Tony said, neither agreement or disagreement.  “You're a menace.” He yawned.  “I could take a half dozen pictures and send my kid to college with the proceeds.”  He grinned.  “You're that dangerous.”
Tony took a sip of his coffee.  It tasted coppery and sharp on his tongue.  His throat hurt.  “You any good at it?”
“No.” DJ's voice was soft, but there was a hint of a giggle to the single word, and Tony smiled at him.
“Many things were here once,” his mother said.  “Many wild and wonderful things, I should think, and then we came and took what had once been theirs.”  Her smile was soft and light, but her eyes were sad.  “That’s the way of people, Steve.  There’s always some who’ll take, no matter what damage they do to the rest of the world.”
“Yes,” Steve agreed.  “It's very early.  Usually, he would still be at the restaurant, right?”  DJ nodded again.  “But he's sick.  So today, he had to go to bed early.”  Another nod, but DJ was avoiding his eyes now, staring down at the tabletop.  Steve cast about, trying to find something comforting to say.  “Want to see?”
“Yes,” she said, her voice flat.  “I absolutely am.”  She reached back and patted Sam on the cheek.  “And no one'd blame me.”
"I...  Don't know how to make them more 'up' than they currently are," Steve said.  "I'm-"  He looked up at his hands.  "This is as far as they go, Jan."
“No,” everyone said in unison.
Jan popped up in front of him, a finger pointing at his face.  “Can you keep a secret?” she asked, her eyes narrowed.
Seamus considered that. "Nah," he said, and Steve reached for his collar. Seamus tried to fend him off, but Steve was faster than him, bigger than him, and distinctly more determined than him. A moment later, the boy scrambled out of reach. "Geez, get off!"
“You’re being rude,” Al said.  “To Captain America.”  Ellen could hear the capitol letters implied in the words.
“Engineers love redundancies,” Tony said.  There was a pounding in his ears, and he refused to acknowledge it.  “I’m no exception.”
For a long, silent moment, Jarvis studied him.  Then he put his glass down.  “Sir.  Do you want to be better?”
“Please act with some decorum, sir,” Jarvis said, making no effort to hide his smile.
Steve smiled down at DJ.  “I think he does.  Secretly.”
“Why are you here?” Tony asked her.
Phil didn’t move.  “I don’t suppose you’ve spoken to my mother,” he said.
“No.”  DJ leaned into the kitchen.  He was covered in dirt from the top of his head to his bare feet.  “Gonna.”  He paused.  “Charge.”
Stark blinked down at his plate.  "I don't-"
Steve grinned at him, his eyes bright.  "Feel better?"
Steve exhaled, his hands braced on his hips.  “What makes you think-”
"And with all due respect, I can't do anything about how people see me. That's on them. I just exist, and you put your judgments on me," Steve said, the words cutting. "And you don't matter."
“I thought Mr. Stark was in here,” Steve said.
Tony settled into the chair, his back braced against the cabinets.  He let his head fall backwards.  “She didn’t help.”
Peter blinked at him, almost vibrating with leashed energy.  “I think we should,” he said.  Tony made to step past him, and Peter matched him, step by step.  “I think it’s a good idea.”
“How about me?” Tony asked, sipping his cocoa.
Her fingers tightened on her apron.  “How to stop being a child.  Stop being a person.”
“This was my mother’s favorite place in the whole house,” Tony said, pushing away from the stairs.  “She used to sit right there, on that same lounger, and watch that fountain.  Sometimes, she’d read, or embroider, or go over the ledgers, or the week’s menus.  But mostly, she’d just watch the water.”  He lowered himself down, until he was sitting on the floor in front of the sofa.  “And I’d sit right here.”
Bruce made a face.  “Sorry?”
Tony's hand slipped out from under the blankets, catching the hem of Steve's shirt.  “Stay.”
“That is troubling,” Tony told her.  “And Jan, no, we are not having a reception.”  Jan stared at him, her eyes huge, her lower lip stuck out in a distinct pout.  Tony struggled not to laugh.  “I've known you since you were nine, Van Dyne, that does not work on me.”
Steve smiled. ‘You can choose.’
“Live dangerously,” DJ said, his voice stern.  He peeked out from under the hood.
He shook his head.  “I trust you,” he said.  And to be honest, this was overwhelming, in a way he couldn't really articulate.  “Thank you, Jan.”
Tony dropped his hands, looking over to meet Steve's eyes.  His face was pinched, his mouth a set, hard line.  Tony managed a slight smile.  “Asshole who tried to have me killed, then tried to kill me?” he asked, his voice wry.  “Yeah.”
“Except I wasn’t dead,” Steve said, filling his cup, and then Bucky’s.
Shiro popped a noodle in his mouth.  “Doesn’t.”
“Better than anyone else,” she said.  She tipped her face up, her eyes fluttering shut as she savored the sunlight through the leaves.  “And if my mother could not control me, he would not expect you to.”
“Well, Phil isn’t IN Vegas, so if he is, that’s-  That’s not going to go well,” Tony said.  “But since you’re her best friend on the team-”
Tony pretended to think about it.  “Not bad,” he admitted.
“And a lot of cooking,” Steve said, putting the pieces together.
“He wants mine,” he said.
“We've been over this,” Tony said.
The haze of hormones cleared in an instant.  “No.”
Halfway to the stairs, he spotted a girl carrying a tray of candy and cigarettes.  “Miss?”  He gestured at the girl, who darted over, her gloved hands clasped tight on her tray.  Tony smiled at her.  “I need you to go find someone for me.”
“We’ll wait until he’s not looking,” Tony said to the cat in a stage whisper, rattling the newspaper in front of him. Furbro opened one golden eye, peering at Tony over the fluff of his tail, and Tony shrugged.   “What?  It has to happen eventually.”
Steve’s eyes narrowed.  “Why-”
“Right,” Steve said.  He rolled his shoulders, making DJ giggle.  “Sorry, monkey, I’ve got to put you down now.”
“All of them,” Tony said.  He held the broom out to Wanda.  “Can you…  Remove the weapon, please?”
And with that, she walked out of the meeting room.  Everyone watched her go.  Carol started to clap, slow and deliberate.  “So, that just happened,” Bruce said, his eyes blinking rapidly behind the lenses of his glasses.
“Know what?”  Steve nodded.  “That sounds good.”  His head dipped forward, and then came up, his smile shy.  “Thanks.”
“Watching the footage, I got that impression.”  Tony folded up his menu sign, moving it to the back of the truck.  “Luckily, I have spies everywhere.”
“And if you had not presented a clear threat to it, it would never have done so,” he said.  “It responds to threats, Agent.  You presented a threat.  It responded.”
"You're making him fox trot to a song that is not-"
Bobbi’s foot was tapping a steady, sharp rhythm against the floor.  “Take us off leash, boss,” she said, her voice silken, and Tony paused, one hand hovering just over the wood of the banister.  Bobbi rocked forward, a sharp, aborted gesture.  “Let’s end this.”
Tony sorted them out, making neat stacks on the table and on the floor next to his chair.  'The Greatest Ballpark Ever: Ebbets Field and the Story of the Brooklyn Dodgers.'  'Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art.'  'City of Dreams: The 400-Year History of Immigrant New York.'  Under that, he found half a dozen battered fantasy novels, JRR Tolkien and Terry Brooks and Robin Hobb, and a couple of faded spy novels, a Bond book missing half its cover and a Tom Clancy volume big enough to serve as a doorstop.
Stark's head tipped to the side, one eyebrow arching.  "I do believe that's my line," he said, his lips twitching up on one side.  He pushed his hair back from his forehead, his fingers tangling in the strands.  "In that I don't know why you're here?"
DJ raised a hand.  “I can-”
Rhodey poked his head into the kitchen, grinning like the fiend that he was.  “I tried, but your front of house keeps hanging up on me,” he said.  Pepper, coming up behind him, swatted at him with her purse.  Laughing, Rhodey fended her off.  “Hey, Potts, didn’t see you there.”
Rhodey took a deep breath, and Tony heard the answer in that simple hiss of air.  “They’re still looking  The grounds are...”  His jaw worked.  “There’s a lot of places to go.”
“So two weeks pass, we’re running short of soldiers that haven’t already made a try at this,” Shuri said.  “There are arguments amongst those who have gone and the council.  None of the guards we put on him have returned.”  She paused.  “It was a particularly slow time for gossip, so you can imagine, this was all anyone was talking about.
"I mean, we could've, but actually checking invitations at the door is so gauche," Tony said.  As everyone laughed again, he gave them a polished grin.  "Easier to elope than deal with that."
Rogers nodded.  “The bedding's disordered.  Is there a blanket missing?  A pillow?”
“Not…  Not what I was asking about,” Bruce said, looking pained.
Steve stopped, still so aroused it hurt.  But there was something sad about that one word, something melancholy about the way Tony mumbled it into his pillow, his head tipped away from Steve, as if avoiding his eyes.  He took a breath and let it out.
His head came up, confusion sweeping over him, just in time to see Steve emerge from the crowd, a metal trash can lid clutched in one hand.  Before Tony could even draw a breath, Steve was cutting between him and the gunman, his arm coming up in an easy, beautiful arc.
“I take it you wouldn’t be crying if he was,” Happy said, his hands tucked in his pocket.
There was a pause, then, “You did well, sir.”
Sam opened his mouth.  Closed it with a sigh.  "You want me to-" He waved a hand at the door, his eyebrows arched.  "Deal with this?"
The distance from the door to the table seemed insurmountable.  He started forward anyway.  “Thank you, sir.”
DJ glanced at Steve, who was still smiling that smile that wasn’t really a smile.  “You don’t have to go back if you don’t want to, DJ.”  He braced his arms on the top of the steering wheel.  “I think that Stephen would understand if we gave him a call and told him that you’d be skipping this week.”
Steve straightened up.  "That out of all the people he could've chosen, male and female..."  He paused, a smile slipping across his face.  "He chose me."  He shrugged.  "Which seems like the egocentric way to think about it, now that I say it aloud."  He glanced back at Tony, and his smile enough to take a man's breath away.  "All choices he had.  All the people he could've loved."  Steve's eyes crinkled, just a little at the corners, and he was bright and beautiful and right.  "He chose me."
“I think that's my line,” Steve said.  He raised his hand, opening his fingers to let the wind catch the petals.  They swirled around the table, disappearing over the edge of the into the sunlit sky beyond the wrought iron fence.
“We could get into who tells who what,” Val agreed, folding her arms on the workbench, her eyelashes fluttering.  “Or we could just agree that everyone that keeps their mouth shut get extra dessert.”
Strange pushed himself to his feet, with slow deliberation.  Drawing himself to his full height, he met Steve’s eyes straight on.  “Believe me, Captain,” he said, and there was a chill underlying the words, undercut by a sudden, violent sweep of wind, “While it takes a great deal of energy to move a dead weight such as yourself across dimensional barriers, I have reserves that you cannot imagine.”
Sue gave up.  “Did you build yourself a child?”
Satisfied, Hank went back to his work.  “The City Guard is fine.”  He reached for a knife.  “Mostly.  It’s the King’s Elite you should be watching out for.”
Rhodes' eyes flicked up to meet Steve's in the rear view mirror.  "The man needs to keep his job," he said, his voice laconic.  "Times are tough, Miss Potts."
“Y'all need therapy,” Sam said.  “Seriously.  Therapy.”
“Always the political one, aren't you?” Tony said, grinning.  He reached for a towel.  “Is Steve awake?”
“I'm thinking that a gentle reminder can't hurt,” Rhodey said.  “Look, since I'm now awake, I'm going to go hit the gym.  Call me?”
“I’m not even going to ask how you knew what was in here,” Carol said, handing the bag over.  “Because I’m pretty sure I want to know the answer.”
It never came.
Jarvis made a slight, soft humming noise under his breath.  “I’d like to think I do, sir.”  He gave Tony a smile.  “But I suppose we’ll see who’s right in the end.”  He turned to the door.  “Won’t we?”
"What do you need?" Steve asked her as she slid into place.
“Me and Rhodey.”
Hank made a frustrated sound, shoving a hand through his hair.  It flopped right back into his eyes.  He didn’t seem to notice.  “You really think that flirting is better?”
“Hey, Doc,” Clint said, already pouring a cup of coffee.  “You want to tell the copper where Nat found me?”
Wanda sank down to sit the edge of the table, her legs folded at the ankle.   She leaned forward, catching DJ’s arm in hers.  “Or, it’s just possible you’ve been tricked.”  She pushed DJ’s sleeve back, ignoring how his tea cup tipped.  “Or maybe just misled.”
“I’m going, I’m going,” Tony said, his voice full of laughter.  He raised a hand in a wave as he turned and headed off down the hallway.
After a long, still moment, Tony’s chin dipped in a slight nod.  “Right.  Of course.”  He let out a breath that sounded almost like a laugh.  “Of course you are.”
“Yes, that is the worst thing I can come up with,” Tony said, at the same time Peter said, “I don’t want to account.”
Steve turned around before anyone could see his face flush.
“Neither did mine,” she agreed, popping a fry in her mouth.  “Mmmmm.  Unhealthy.”
Tony glanced at the screen, where the leading lady, who had traded in her flannel and jeans for a filmy white dress cup up to her hip, was wandering aimlessly on a beach.  On the other side of the beach, her soon-to-be beau was wandering, just as aimless, just as pointless.  "About twelve more songs, three chase sequences, and a pie fight," Tony said, before taking a sip of his beer.
"Perception," Ellen said, and Steve nodded.
“Ready?” Stark said, straightening his own jacket with a flick of his fingers.  He held out a hand.  “Want to come stand with me?”
“Manners,” she chided with a smile.  “And still.  Don’t speak of them.”
Tony nodded.  “I'm fine.”  He wasn't sure he meant it, but he was getting really good at faking it.
“No,” DJ said.  His face was still pink, his hair was tangled, but he seemed steadier on his feet now.  Steadier than Tony was, at any rate.
Tony leaned back against the workbench, reaching for his coffee cup.  "Jarvis, this is not a fox trot.  You know that this is not a fox trot, don't you?"
The photographer never lowered her camera. “I'll trade 'em for a solo photo shoot with you.”
Shiro laughed as he wiped down the counter.  “Clint, fine.  He’s ruined six ‘spicy ramen challenge days’ in a row.”
But he was so tired he hurt.
There was static, a burst, and then another, and when the feed stabilized again, the boy's lips were moving, the words barely audible over the whir of servos, the creak of metal.
“Do you want curses?” Jess asked him, her foot braced on the edge of the table.  “Because that’s how you get curses.”
She took a deep breath.  “So.  I have a crush.”  She held up a hand, finger and thumb an inch away from each other.  “Just…  A little one.  But I was thinking of-” Another shrug, her hand falling back to her lap. “Doing something about it?”
“I never have,” Steve said, but Tony was already moving away, and Steve watched him go, hating how he could never seem to figure out how to make Tony stay.
“If you could’ve pushed me back instead of pulling me through, you would’ve,” Steve said, cutting him off.  “You’re pushing your limits, and I know it, because I’ve done it.” Strange’s eyes flared, and Steve held up his hands.  “I can't stop you from tossing me back, not now, not tomorrow.”
“Okay.”  Clint rubbed a hand over his mouth.  “Okay.  If I think you're sick, or in danger, I have to tell Bruce and your dad.  But if you're just scared, that happens, right?  We all get scared, we all get freaked out and lose it a little, right?”
“Things I already knew how to do when I went in, and when I came out,” Tony said.  He picked up a wrench from the workbench, just to keep himself from punching something.   “And as I improved the armor, it's likely someone realized they already had a lot of the building blocks.  Not the arc reactor.  Not the power source.  But a lot of what makes the armor functional?” His head bobbed in a slight nod.  “They already had it.  And there was nothing stopping them from using it.”
“Fuck,” Tony said.  Steve choked on a laugh.
“No offense,” he said, his jaw aching.  “But stay there.”  He met the man’s blue eyes without flinching, and how odd, how very odd to see that face and those eyes and those lips and feel nothing.  Or worse than nothing.  “You’re not the first doppelganger I’ve met, and I haven’t had much luck with dealing with Steve Rogers that aren’t my Steve.”  He stopped, his shoulders twitching up in a shrug. “Our Steve.”
“Oui,” Clint said, checking under the tea towel.  “Lemon?”
She shifted her weight.  “It’s one of your best traits,” Bobbi agreed.
“Mr. Stark?”
"No."
Steve ducked under the trailing boughs, reaching up with one hand to brush the bells with the tips of his fingers.  Even that tiny touch was enough to send them swinging in place, the bells ringing with a high, clear chime.
“He might,” Steve said, taking a seat in the other chair.  “He’s just learning, I have an old set at home.  So he’s hard to predict.”
Jan paused, her eyes big and bright under the fringe of her bangs. “I don’t want to,” she said, her voice solemn, “but I will if I have to.”
“This is him wanting to purchase presents for his family,” Jarvis said.
“Yeah, I said it, no, I don’t remember saying it,” Tony said, “I probably meant it and I definitely shouldn’t have said it.”  He pushed himself upright, biting back a groan as every inch of his body protested.  He hunched forward, sucking in breath between his teeth.  “Talk to Pepper.  She’ll…  She usually has a better statement.”
“No, because Steve refuses to get married without a pre-nup and Dad refuses to get married with a pre-nup and they’ve been in a standoff over it for like, three years now,” he said.  He stopped.  “Clint got ordained.  As a justice of the peace.  He says they’re going to end up needing to do it somewhere for some stupid reason and now he’s ready.”  He stopped.  “Like that scene in Pirates of the Carribean.”
“Did you not get the press release?” Tony glanced back at Marcy, now standing just a few steps behind him.  “Did you not send the press release?”
Stark’s face relaxed, just a bit.  “Not my fault you apparently can’t figure out battery life.”  He braced an arm against the window, his fingers tapping against the doorframe.  “Or servos.”
“Well, in Tony’s defense, it’s worked out remarkably well for him.  I can’t blame him for going with a winning formula,” Rhodey said.  Across the room, DJ had managed to hook his foot into the strap of Steve’s bag, pulling it across the polished floor, as if he could hold Steve here by hiding his things.  Judging by the slight smile on Steve’s face, it wasn’t going to work, but Rhodey admired the kid’s moxie.

“If they are, they’re being careful about it,” Clint said.  He opened the back door of the vehicle, waving her in.  “Load it up, kids.  Stark, where are we going?”
Carol gave her a smug grin, unconcerned.  “I punched a dinosaur last week.”
DJ nodded, his head bouncing up and down.  “Please.”
“Yeah, well, you were going to get me, anyway,” Fury said, waving his sandwich in Tony’s direction.  “At least now I get some satisfaction out of it.” He looked back at DJ.  “You need a spoon?”
“Depends on the pants situation,” Isaiah said.  “Get to work, Rogers.”
Tony was already shaking his head.  “No.  He said he was-” Breathing was hard now, it was a physical struggle.  “I saw him walk away with you.  I know what I-”
“Bruce removed all the knives from his station and says anyone who gives him anything sharper than a spoon is going to be fired immediately,” Peter said.
While the fact that May has rarely thought about the Tony Stark of this universe is largely an accident, her not having lingered upon thoughts of the other world’s Peter Parker is entirely purposeful. The thought of a Peter somewhere out there, one who had just learned to rely on another parental figure only to turn around and almost immediately lose him floods her with a terrible, wrenching sadness. And with not a little guilt, because while she hurts for that Peter, her own child has benefited immensely from Tony’s presence in this universe. She doesn’t know if she would give him back if offered the choice, and is pathetically grateful to never have been offered it as she knows Tony was.
Cursing, Steve shot off after the boys, and Tony wandered after them, grinning to himself.  It took him a few minutes to work his way through the lobby, nodding and smiling at people as they passed, accepting stumbling, shy thanks from children clinging to their mother’s skirts and their father’s hands.
“We built his playroom out back,” Tony explained.  He boosted himself onto the a stool, bracing his elbows on the workbench.  He looked exhausted, but he was smiling anyway.  “He's fine.”
“I’m not talking to Steve,” Jess said.  “He left town and he didn’t call us.  We could’ve run his truck.”
“We could watch something else,” Tony pointed out.
Steve chuckled.  “Maybe,” he allowed.  He glanced at Tony.  “I certainly wouldn't have been happy, Tony.  I wouldn't have been...”  He shrugged.  “Me.”
Bobbi picked it up, tucking it back into the folder and closing it, her hand resting on top of it.  “It was odd,” she said.  “In the past, he’d broken up a few anarchist groups.  Which, since that’s to the benefit of the rich and powerful of this city, that’s not so surprising.  What is surprising is that the only ones he seemed to bother were the ones who were actually a threat.  Men with bombs.  Men who planned on killing people.”  She met Steve’s eyes.  “As many people as possible.
“If I was born any further South, we’d be breaking up right now,” Drew said.  He looked at Harris.  “You want anything?”
“Freak me out, is a little closer.  It’s not you,” Tony said, looking at the schematic.  It wasn’t his best work, but it had potential.  He started pulling it apart, yanking out systems with sharp, confident movements.
“I love you, so I'll try,” Tony whispered back.  “Good enough?”
Steve stared at him.  “Why didn't you tell me?” he asked, and he sounded so honestly and truly hurt that Tony wanted to hug him.
Steve gave him a cold, hard smile.  “Right,” he said, his fingers flexing on the strap of the shield.  “Guess that’s a no on the ‘leave while you have the chance,’ option.”
“I can’t believe I’m involved in this conversation,” Tony said.
Tony knew the moment that Steve had spotted him.  In an instant, the tension went out of his frame, his shoulders relaxing, his brow smoothing out.  He ducked his head, speaking a few tense words to Billy, before cutting his way across the lobby.  Tony took a moment to watch him move, admiring the smooth grace with which he slipped through the crowd.  All that leashed strength and surprising grace was a thing of beauty, and for all he knew that the concern on Steve’s face was for DJ, he allowed himself a moment of fantasy, allowed himself to wonder what it would be like, to have Steve be looking for him.
“DJ’s got his entrance ticket, now we just need to figure out where to use it,” Tony said.  “We go back there, we split up so we’re not quite so obvious, and we go looking for the right door.”
“Nothing to talk about,” Steve said  He took a deliberate step forward.  Sam didn’t move. “Sam…”
“It's not, and I'm sorry, I should've-”  Steve shook his head.  “I should've realized.  But I never-”  He rubbed a hand over his head.  “Your place was closer and better and-”
Steve braced his hands on the ground, trying to ignore how hard it was to draw a deep breath.  “I oughta lock you in that room of yours,” he said, pushing himself to his feet.
“We weren't, actually,” Ellen said. “You're the one who brought sex into this.”
The boy paused.  "He'll be in trouble," he said, and opened the office door.  Outside in the hallway, a gaggle of boys were gathered around the door, doing their best to peer into the office.  He took a swing at them with one hand, making the crockery rattle on his tray.  "Shove off, the lot of you, if Hammer catches you, we'll all catch hell."
“We'll pencil that in,” Tony said, and his head was spinning, heat and something like euphoria rolling over him in a wave. It was a possibility. It was something that could happen. A first anniversary. If he played his cards right, he could actually-
“We don’t talk about that,” Jess said, the words coming very, very fast.
“Yes, sir,” she said.  Her eyes flicked over Tony's shoulder, and then back to his.  “Should I check in with Jarvis?:”
“No, because now it’s my fault that he can’t have a dog,” she said, her voice stern.
He looked up, something like benign confusion floating over his pasty, bruised face.  “He’s just a little boy,” he said, his voice breaking.  “He’s just a kid.  I wasn’t going to-”  He stopped.  Took a drink.  “I couldn’t KILL him.  But Stane was screaming, louder and louder, and I just…”
Tony shook his head.  “What over conclusion can we draw here?” he asked, and his voice wasn’t quite steady.  Exhaustion made his tongue heavy, and he hated it.
“Don't be gauche,” he said.  “They've got a guy dressed up in a very bad costume, so-”
“I could hope you'd suddenly gotten lazy,” he admitted.
“That would be the long and short of it, yes,” Tony said.  He swung DJ off of his back and lowered him down to a stool next to Peter, who immediately ripped off a piece of his toast and offered it to DJ.  Tony gave him a look.  “Parker.   We have more bread.  I can see a loaf over there.  He can have his own.”
Pepper propped her hands on her hips.  “What have we said about not giving Miss Van Dyne carte blanche?”
He heaved a sigh.  “My parents, and hers, have finally given up on that.”  To Rogers, he added.  “She is the most amazing woman, but we've known each other so long that we might as well be siblings.  She punches harder than my actual brother, and has less cause to hold back.”
“I’m sorry, sir?” the doorman asked, pushing it open for him.
“I think we're going to consider them as part of the terms of surrender,” Steve said, steering Tony towards the stairs.  “You can keep the couch, he keeps the socks.”
“Tell me a secret,” he said, because he was an idiot, because he wanted something he couldn’t put in words, and this wasn’t it, it wasn’t right, but it was was close enough.  Tony stroked Steve’s hair away from his forehead, his fingers lingering in the strands there.  “Something you’ve never told anyone else.  Something…”  He took a breath, and it didn’t hurt the way he’d expected it to.  “Something no one else knows.”
The whole thing took less than a minute, and Pepper found herself on her feet, her handbag clutched to her chest.  The hinges on the office door creaked, and she collapsed back into her seat with more speed than grace.  Hammer plodded past, a stack of folders balanced in his arms.  "Now, now," he crowed, his broad face flushed with exertion.  He dropped the folders onto the desk with a thump, and grinned at her, his spectacles crooked on his nose.  "Let's find you a proper little urchin!”
“Starting to not care, honestly,” Jesse said.  “We running it?  Or-”
“I’m wearing my seat belt,” DJ said, which was something that could’ve gone unsaid, because there is no way Steve would’ve started the car if his seat belt wasn’t fastened.
“I’ll put it away later,” Bruce said, which was so patently a lie that Tony didn’t even bother pointing it out.
Steve reached over Tony’s shoulder, catching a small equation that had tried to slip away, and pushing it back into place.  “Let’s make a deal,” he said.  “I’ll eat if you do.”
“Right, you and half of the rest of the world,” Rhodey said, breaking the spell.
Clint looked at his watch.  “Should be done,” he agreed.  “Breakfast, then?”
He really wished he had the damn suit.
Tony patted her gently on the head.  "You are encouraging the child," he said.
“Great, we’ll be able to send you back, except we won’t, because you’ll be in jail,” Harris said.  “Wonderful.”  He looked at Darcy.  “No heists.”
Somehow, he reached Tony before Tony reached the stairs, his arms wrapping around Tony's chest.  “Hey!  Stop, wait, you're going to break your neck,” he managed, dragging Tony to a stop.  “What's wrong?  Do you need something?”
“Far better than I was,” Tony said, pouring coffee into his cup.  “However, I know myself.  If I ended up dating a therapist, that-”  He paused, the coffee pot hanging in mid-air.  “Let’s just say it wouldn’t be fair to that person, as I really can’t be trusted not to take advantage of certain…  Skillsets.”
“Tell me a secret,” Tony said, and he didn’t know where the words came from, or even what they meant, not really. But they were out before he could stop them, and Steve was pulling back, his expression confused.
“And what would that statement be?” Steve asked, as Jarvis
Tony choked on a laugh.  “You're a bad man, Captain Rogers, you know that?”
DJ nodded.  “Dad?”  He gave Tony a hopeful look.  “Swim?”
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist.  This, he understood.  “We’ve got a few hours til breakfast,” he whispered against Tony’s shoulder.  “And I haven’t got a wife.”  He resisted the urge to ask if he had a boyfriend, because that way lay madness.  Instead, he slipped his hands under Tony’s shirt.
“I think we lost her back at the corset booth, and I’m as terrified by that sentence as anyone else on Earth,” Harris said.  He picked up a t-shirt.  He was pretty sure it was bootleg, and he was all right with that.  “Does this count as a ‘souvenir’ situation?  Are we bringing stuff back?”
“No,” Tony said, trying to sound stern.  “The armor will rust.”
Sam grinned.  “Guess we’ll just have to rely on your looks,” he said.  He dropped his arm and tapped the box against Steve’s chest.  “This should help.”
DJ thought about that.  “Yes.”
“You’re both fine,” Darcy echoed.  She dusted her hands off on her hips, and adjusted her coveralls.  “Look at me.  If I don’t get a dress, then neither do either of you.”
"Not as cool," Sam said.  He took a seat next to Steve, bracing his elbows on his knees.  "So.  Speaking of significant others-”
Tony nodded.  “The Gatekeeper.”
“Don’t get me wrong,” Billy said, his knee still bouncing in place.  “I’ve lived in worse places.  Hammer might be a drunk, and he might be willing to do whatever it takes to get him higher on the social ladder, but he’s decent enough.  He makes sure we’re fed and keeps clothes on our backs.”   He shrugged.  “I don’t wish him dead, but I won’t be crying at his funeral, either.”
There was music playing, a jazz piece with a driving bass line and a bright, brassy horn section, and it echoed through the penthouse.  Tony found himself moving in that direction, chasing the warmth and light, cajoled by the smell of tomatoes and garlic, and the swirl of someone else's music.
“The rest of us aren't,” he said, and there was a grunt and a high pitched scream in the background.  “So go take care of that, Iron Man.”
"It doesn't matter." The rage sat in the pit of her stomach, hot and caustic, and she focused on that. It was easier to handle than the shame, the self-hatred. She sucked in a breath. "There's no excuse. There's nothing that makes that right. That was not-" She squeezed her eyes shut, ignoring how they burned. "It wasn't my story to tell, and I did it anyway, and that's-" She shook her head. "I outed you. And there's no excuse for that. Ever." She chewed her lip, telling herself that she didn't taste copper, didn't taste iron. "Not ever."
“He donated to PBS, which was very nice, I wondered where he got that tote bag,” Steve said.  “He bought a book on…”  He looked at the invoice.  “‘African Civilizations Prior to Western Influence,’ and one on the rise of the Modernist movement, he’s been exploring that lately.”
“Right.”  Tony didn't even look, he just scribbled something like a signature on the page.  “Boring.”
“Comforting,” Steve said, and Rhodes was still laughing as he headed off down the road.  Tall and rangy, he moved easily through the crowd, his shoulders squared, pausing here and there to respond to greetings or trade a few words with a merchant.
“Big guy.  Tall.  Heavy shoulders.  Rich, but didn’t want anyone to know that.”
Bucky ignored him.  "Half a burrito for half the couch?"
“Yes, sir.”
Tony smiled.  “Really.”
"You have a medical check today, right?" Jan asked, her hands on her hips.  Steve nodded.  "Good.  Tonight.  Put those on.  Find a book.  Relax.  Wait."
"I don't-" Steve realized he was clutching the snowy white napkin in one fist, and he tossed it down.  "There's no reason to suspect that you're here for me."
Happy just considered the arrow, an easy smile on his face.  “Wasn’t that just a beautiful shot?  It would be, of course.”  He reached behind him, his hand closing on the shaft of the arrow.   He wrenched it free, tearing a shower of splinters along with it.
Jan leaned back into the library.  “I didn't steal it, I told you, I'm just borrowing it!”
“Miss Potts gave the staff a tip,” Tony said.  He caught her hand, and pressed the bill into it.  “Because Miss Potts is better at these things than Mr. Stark is.”  He gave her a quick smile.  “I don’t want to take him back in there, so I’m trusting you’ll deliver the message.”
Steve caught himself smiling, even as he opened the pantry doors.  It, like the rest of the kitchen, was safely deserted, but he did spot the napkin covered basket on a shelf next to the door.   He picked it up.  "This?" he asked, returning to the kitchen.
“Sounds like a plan,” Steve said.  “Rhodey, you still going to be around when I get home?”
Steve nodded.  “You can’t, can you?”
Steve grinned.  “Right.  Let me rephrase.  We just had tacos last night, and even though you could probably eat tacos every night this week-”
“So you said,” Tony said.  He caught Rogers' hand, dragging him in until they were almost chest to chest.  Tony canted his head up, giving Rogers a flirtatious look.  “So.  Ask.”
“I think a good American boy like yourself’ll be just fine.”  She saluted him with her cup before she set it back on the table.  “No matter what.”
Steve sighed.  “Clint!”
“Yes, sir,” Jarvis said.
“Tony-” Steve started, and Tony ignored him.
There was a moment of silence, broken only by a choked off burst of laughter from Bucky.  T’Challa stared at her, a bemused expression on his face.  “Shuri…”
“You got me into this,” Duck said, his voice dire. “And you're going to get me out of it.” He hooked a thumb over his shoulder at his office. “Get in here.”
Greer gave her a look out of the corner of her eyes.  “Because I want to get laid,” she said, her teeth flashing.
Neither of them looked at him.  “This isn’t an argument,” Steve said.  “This isn’t-”  He shoved a hand through his hair.  “You can’t call it in.”
“Less a job and more a hobby,” Clint said.
"And now you sound like Peter, and let me tell you, sounding like Peter?" Tony gave him a slight smile.  "A bad idea."
Tony pried an eye open, staring without any real interest at the gray, dank Manhattan skyline.  It looked cold and heavy and dark, and Tony wanted nothing more than to roll over and pull the blankets over his head.  It felt like he hadn't slept well in days.  Probably because he hadn't.
“Excuse me?” Steve said, and Jess plopped down on the bench next to him, throwing an arm around his shoulders.
“And now I know what you look like, wet and in a towel, and Jesus CHRIST,” Tony said. Steve's hands kept slipping down, and then jerking back up. Tony grinned at him. “Steve? We're married, and you just told the entire country you're in love with me. You can touch my ass if you want.”
“No, we can't,” Tony said, and he felt the pen bounce off of the top of his head.  “I know that was you, Potts.”
Steve watched him, relaxing by stages.  “You’re good at that,” he said, as Jarvis slipped Tony’s second shoe off, settling his foot back on the bed.
Anything Steve could've said to that would've come out wrong, and he beat a hasty retreat, the fabric of his jacket balled tight between his fingers.  He stalked through the bedroom, trying not to look at the tumbled blankets of he bed and the discarded clothes on the floor.  He didn't need any more fodder for his fevered dreams.
“Phil called in some favors,” Steve said.
That won him a slight smile.  “That wasn’t what I meant,” Steve said.
“Yes,” Steve said, and Tony nodded.
Happy exhaled, his whole body seeming to deflate in an instant.  “Where the he-”  He stopped, his jaw working.  “Where have you been?” he managed at last, scowling at Steve.  “I been up and down half this city looking for you!”
“I have purchased three orphanages, two soup kitchens and a vocational school,” Tony said, loving him so much it hurt.  “I refuse to go into the medical profession, Rogers.”
"There."  He rapped Rogers' wrist with his knuckles, the skin to skin contact fleeting.  "All set.  You may go."
In the silence that followed, Clint realized he’d been holding his breath.  “That was a yes, right?” he asked.
She huffed out a breath.  "So difficult."
He straightened up, one arm around Tony's back and the other tucked under his knees.  Tony's weight settled against his chest, his head falling against Steve's shoulder.  He exhaled, his lips curling up in a smile as he rubbed his cheek against the soft cotton of Steve's shirt.  For a second, Steve just stood there, Tony cradled in his arms, his chest aching.
"You took my blanket," Tony said, and Bucky made an inarticulate sound.  Tony's head tipped in Steve's direction. "He took my blanket."
Steve smiled back.  “Next time a spaceship is crashing down on a crowd of civilians,” he said, “I'll remember your advice.”
“This is a ‘punching situation,’” Steve gritted out, “and you’re the only thing in reach.”
Clint was peering over Nat’s shoulder.  “I want the sheep,” he said.
Mrs. Parker smiled down at the apple in her hand.  “Oh, yes.  I’ve heard it.  Several times.”  She paused.  “Before I believed it.” She set another peeled apple onto the pile.  “Well?”
“I know enough about your housekeeping to suspect the child is being accurate in this,” Agatha said, as the other Strange was labeled as ‘Locally Grown.’  “To surmise, something went wrong, and the spell intended to protect him went too far?”
“I heard coffee on the list, so I'm fine.”
Steve took it.  “And he’s been buying things?”
“Can't get you sick.”
Tony leaned in, and cleared his throat.  “I’ve never been prouder to say that I know exactly where his mouth has been,” he said.  He grinned, wide and wicked and perfect.  “And where it’s going to be-”
But the frost was fast approaching, and with it, the winter winds and storms, and the solarium needed to be shuttered until spring.  Steve had been drafted to help Rhodey, Clint and Happy manipulate the massive, heavy doors into place.  He didn’t mind; at this point, physical labor was a welcome distraction.
Tony took a breath.  “Then it's a very good thing you're married to a guy who can afford the best insurance coverage,” he said.  He rubbed a thumb across the angle of Steve's cheekbone, gentle on the bruised skin.  “I might not be so good at fixing myself, Steve, but I'm stubborn about fixing the things I-”  He stopped short of saying 'love.'  It seemed wrong.  It seemed dangerous.  “The things I care about.”
“So.  It is a magic problem.”
Steve looked up in time to see Mrs. Parker come through the open door from the house, the tray in her hands filled with steaming coffee cups and a basket of golden-brown pastries.  She smiled.  “Since you’re already taking a break, might as well have a cup of coffee.”
“Of course.” Tony scraped a hand down his face.  “I cannot keep a child, Jarvis.”
This was always the way the story was going to end.
DJ opened his mouth, prepared to say yes.  The word died on his tongue.  “Tired,” he said, and that was a little more honest.  Still not the right word.  Still not the truth.  But a little more honest.  His spoon scraped the bottom of his bowl and he looked down to find that it was empty.  Relieved, he let the spoon slip from his fingers.  He’d eaten it, that should count for something.
Tony's head rolled in his direction.  "Darling," he drawled, "I came out at fifteen and you accidentally married a man.  This movie is the third gayest thing in this room, at that, maybe fourth or fifth, I've got a coffee cup with a penis on it somewhere, I don't even know.”
“Yeah, because Steve's got so much to keep tabs on,” Carol said.  She paused in the act of stacking boxes to tighten the bandanna that was tied around her head.  “Cap, you finish with the art stuff yet?”
“He’s many things,” Nat said.  “Efficient isn’t on the list.”
Harris’ hand came up, fumbling at the pocket of his coat for an embarrassingly long time before he managed to get a grip on it.  “I-”
“Wish I could, I really wish I could,” Happy said, as Steve shoved the door open.
DJ reached out, tapping Tony’s nose with one little finger.  “One,” he said carefully.  “Two.”
"I did not allow the door to open," Jarvis said.
Tony smiled.  “You should take it as a compliment,” he said.  “It’s rare for something to require my full attention.” He yawned.  “Let alone someone.”
“I’m a problem,” Steve said to Clint, who shrugged.
“Nice to see that the promise of pastry is the only thing keeping you here,” Tony said with a grin.
Harris, his pace slowed to a walk, headed up the hallway, and the staffer looked up.  “Hi,” he said, shifting in his seat.  It rocked under him, the legs creaking, and he steadied himself with a hand on the wall.  “Sorry.  No public access up here.  If you’re looking for-”
Tony winced.  “Right.  “In my defense-” he said, as the door at the top of the stairs flew open, cutting him off mid-word.
His chest hurt.  "I can't keep anyone safe," he said, and there was a wry note to his voice, an ache that he didn't want to examine too closely.  "Not even myself."
Harris moved forward, one hand extended, and Steve took it.  “And your his dad,” Harris said.
Tony leaned back, meeting his eyes head on.  “Yes.  You did,” he said, his voice firm.  “You told the truth.  You spoke truth to power, and that’s never easy, and they make sure that’s never easy, but you did it, you spoke for people who have no voice, and you managed to not get arrested while doing it, so…”  He smiled, and everything Steve had been looking for was there in his face.  “Home run, Rogers.”
Steve nodded.  “I suppose not.  Then, no.  It doesn't. “ He paused. “When I was a kid, a girl in my building, her parents disowned her.  They just stopped acknowledging her as their daughter, 'cause she married a boy whose parents were the wrong sort of Irish-”
Steve took a deep breath, and another.  “Wanna fuck?” he asked, and Tony’s hand was over his mouth before he even got the words out.
Steve took a deep breath.  “Wondered if you have a moment to be…”  He stopped, his mouth going tight.  “I don’t know how to ask this, I’m sorry, I should-”
Steve waved a hand at the coffee table.  “Got 'em.  And napkins.”  He held out a hand, and Tony handed over the beer.  “Thanks.”  He studied the label, his lips twitching.  “'Imperial Stout Trooper?”
“What?”  Steve looked down at the envelope in his hands.  “Oh.  I don't know.”  His fingers twitched against the need to rip it open.  “I suppose I should wait to open it, or ask...”  He looked at Sam.  “Right?”
"Or, perhaps, that I had a job to do," Jarvis said, his voice wry.  He stepped back into the bedroom just in time to get out of the way of their new guest.
Jan did a spin, her crimson red coat flaring out around her legs, the white puff on her hat bouncing with the movement.  She came to a stop facing the table, and slammed a phone book-sized stack of papers down in front of her.  She leaned forward, smiling in a manner that Steve honestly found to be kind of worrying.
He took a deep breath.  “It's easy to assume everyone else is just as hazy as I am,” he said.  He glanced at DJ, who was staring at him, dark eyes unblinking from behind the rise of his knees.  “But I suppose you weren't drinking as much as I was, back then.”
“No, as a matter of fact, you bit me,” Bucky said, pushing himself to his feet.  He collected his bowl, and tossed Steve’s on top of it.  “Still got the scar.”
Steve handed them over, and Tony headed for the lounge, Sam right behind him.  Even as the kitchen door shut behind them, Steve could still hear them bickering with each other, and he smiled to himself.  A minute later, a roll of paper towels tucked under one arm, he followed them to the lounge.
"I'm going to recite everything," Clint threatened.
She paused.  “Also Nadia was away on a mission and he was pouting, so…”
Tony waved her in.  “Do I get a vote in this?” he asked.
His voice trailed away, and he didn’t know what he’d been trying to say.  Tony glanced up at him, his dark brows arched.  “Well, it’s my house,” he said, his tone wry.  “But I do usually respect a closed door.”  His head tipped to the side.  “But I followed the other intruder in.”
“There’s a real argument in psychological circles about nature vs. nurture, so-”  Grinning, Steve grabbed a towel.  “It’s anyone’s guess.”
Steve turned fully towards him.  “Come on, Stark.  A little rain never hurt anyone.”
“Gentlemen, please,” Victor said, holding up a hand. “This is a place of business. We need to be professional.” He gave Tony a slight, wicked smile. “You can use my office.”
“No, thanks, I’m-”  Another shake of his head, hard enough to send his hair bouncing.  “I’m better off not knowing.”  He pivoted on his heel, his arms folded tightly over his chest.  He was hunched into himself, his body swaying to some internal rhythm.  “Just-”  He managed a flat smile for Jan.  “Just give me the gist.”
“I’m not-” Tony’s head fell back.  “Just…  Just drive.”
“Shame,” Tony said.  Jan stared at him.  He gave her a bright smile.  “So, going to cancel your plans?”
“Later,” Tony said.  He kissed DJ's cheek, giving him a tight hug, and then lowered him back to the floor.  “You can help me put together the new chestplate, okay?”
And Agatha’s familiar was sitting on the arm of the couch, front paws crossed in front of it, tail swinging in slow, easy arc, as regular as a pendulum.
My laptop died.
In the silence that followed, he peeked out from between his fingers to find both Carol and Jess staring at him.  Neither of them looked convinced.  He huffed out a breath, his hands dropping to his sides.  “Greer…”
Steve loved him.
“Okay,” Steve said, pushing himself to his feet.  He waited until everyone settled down, and then he inclined his head in Jan’s direction, his hands braced on the tabletop.  “The floor is yours, Wasp. I’m sure that everyone’s going to give you their undivided attention.”  He looked around the table, meeting everyone’s eyes in turn.  “Right?”
Steve exhaled.  “No.”
“If you're dancing with a lady, generally you'd lead,” Jan said, tangoing past.  Clint spun her in a circle and dipped her.  She looked up at Steve from her upside down position.  “If you're dancing with another gentleman, then generally the one who asked for the dance leads.”  She grinned, her hair brushing the ground.  “Like rolling for initiative.”
“This isn’t working,” Jan said.
“The marriage might beat it, honestly,” Rhodey said.
“I’d object to that, but it might be true,” Tony said.  He reached for the lamp on the bedside table.  “Want to come in and close the door so everyone else can sleep?” he asked.
“Well, when you say it like that, it sounds kinda dumb,” Clint said.
Sam tapped the tablet in his hand with his knuckles.  “Management,” he said.
His phone was beeping.
Curious now, Tony pushed the doors open, took one step into the gym, and came to a dead stop.
The older man pointed a finger in his direction.  “You wanna stand there and be useless, you do that, but I'm not letting anything burn out of politeness.”  He disappeared from sight, his voice echoing up to them.  “Besides, Steve never puts his breads in for long enough.”
Steve blinked at him, his blue eyes dark.  “I like it,” he said, his cheeks pink.  He cleared his throat, and it didn’t seem to help, he still sounded a bit raw when he tried again.  “I mean, I designed it, so of course I like it, it’s not-”  He stopped, and Tony grinned at him.  Steve sighed.  “I love you and you got my truck logo tattooed on your back.”
A beat of silence.  Then, “I’m taking it you’re in a mood, too.”
Tony started to laugh, the sound muffled against Steve’s shoulder.  “Did I mention I was barefoot and not wearing any underwear?” Steve added.
DJ flopped onto his back, holding the kite up over his head.  He squinted at the sky through the bright paper of the kite, his fingers sliding along the seams.  "Why not?" he asked at last, his head tipping in Stark's direction.
Now he just felt stupid, carrying a plant almost the size of his torso around the city in the middle of the day.
“I think we have more important things to talk about,” Steve said, his voice stern.  Natasha arched an eyebrow at him, but she didn't say anything further.  Steve took a deep breath.  “So that's the situation,” he said.  “I'm not asking anyone in this room to lie for us.”
His eyes canted upwards, dark slits under lowered brows.  There was something unreadable in his expression now, almost, but not quite hidden by the slight smile on his lips.  “Yeah?” he asked, leaning back in his chair.  “And what would that be?”
"Then be an adult and show up to help me paint," Steve told him.
Steve tossed the page back.  “Is there a point to this?” he asked.  He was proud of himself.  He sounded calm.  Normal.  Almost bored.
Steve gave him a look, but he no longer looked like he wanted to murder someone.  Tony took that as a positive.  “Right.  I guess that's better than someone asking me if I want to suck their dick.”
“If you say pineapple juice-” Luke said.
Instead, Sam tossed his head back and let out a whoop loud enough to send the pigeons scattering from the ground around them.  Steve let out a chuckle, relief sweeping over him.  “That was dignified,” he said, his lips twitching up.
“I should say not, sir.” Jarvis took a step back, considering Tony for a moment before he reached for the hanger. “It is included, most amicably, with my general service to you and this household.  Arms up, please.”
Tony was wearing his shirt again, a little too large for him, hanging around his muscular thighs.  It was half buttoned, the light of the arc reactor peeking out over his folded arms.  The gray fabric of his borrowed shorts were just visible beneath the white fabric.
“You going to get me one?” Steve asked, amused.
“You’re enjoying this,” Tony accused her.
“It's pretty well known,” she agreed.  “Are you coming back?”
“Get it changed,” Steve said, opening a window with care.  It stuck, the wood warped from moisture and disuse, but he was able to budget it without breaking it.  “Understood.”
Tony sucked in a breath, and another, and it hurt, it hurt every time his chest flexed.  He looked down, at the broad swath of linen wrapped around his ribs.  He touched his side, wincing at the pressure.  Jarvis caught his wrist and pulled his hand away, his grip firm.  “Were you not?” he repeated, and it was gentler now, comforting.
“That's a waste of time,” he said.
Furbro gave him a disinterested look and wandered past, his tail swishing through the air.
Jarvis slipped into the room, stopping just inside the door.  “Your aunt thought you might be getting into trouble,” he said to Peter.
Grinning to himself, Steve turned his attention to his meal.
“You got it, Mr. Stark.” He tucked the money into an interior pocket, straightening his jacket as he did.
"No," Pepper said, and collapsed against him, laughing against his shoulder.
“Please,” Bruce mouthed, before wrenching the beater free from the massive, industrial mixer next to his station.
“The living part or the distraction part?” Clint asked her.
Steve considered that.  "Yep," he said, and took a bite of pizza.  His eyebrows arched.  "And?"
There was a beat of silence.  Then, “I apologize, Clint.  The situation is...  Stressful to me.”
“What the hell is going on?” Ellen asked, ducking around him. “Are you-” Her head came around and she stumbled to a stop, her heart in a throat.
Steve pushed himself away from the banister.  They were ghosts of another age, but places like this must be full of them.  Ghosts were different where he came from.  They were thinner.  Uglier.  Angrier.
“Right.” He took a breath.  His head ached with the dull, vaguely remembered pain of a hangover.  He might not get them anymore, but sometimes, he could swear he felt it, the pain like a phantom limb that he refused to give up.
“Let the staff find them,” Obie said.  “Unless you’ve forgotten why you have staff.”
“Why-” Jan pinched the bridge of her nose.  “People.  We’re at a twelve.  I need you all at like, a six.  Max a six.  I’d prefer a four.”
He collapsed to the floor, his mind a wasteland, blank and empty and silent.
“You knew that when you followed me?”  Steve nodded again, and Strange’s breath huffed out in an aborted, sharp bark of laughter.  “Then you’re a fool.”
Phil’s hands were quick and competent at Tony’s wrists, and he stayed close by after he finished the tie, close enough that Tony could feel the other man’s breath at his back.
“So, what then? There’ll be homework, I’m assuming? Someone will compile everything I need to know about how things work here, what’ll be expected of me?” Pepper nodded, already pulling out a StarkPhone and tapping rapidly.
“But you haven’t even said g’morning yet, Sir.” Steve, Tony had learned over the past few days, always woke up at least half-hard, and it took little more than a breeze to get his cock even more interested in the proceedings. They still hadn’t gone further than semi-platonic bedsharing, but if there was ever a chance, morning was definitely the time to try.
“May I place my burdens in your hands for safe-keeping, ma’am? So that I may be committed and focused on nothing but my submission to you?” Coulson’s voice, his endlessly steady, bordering-on-robotic voice, was trembling with meaning as he asked the questions he’d so obviously asked numerous times before. It had felt like the right thing, then, to turn away, but Tony just couldn’t force himself to tear his eyes from the scene. For as gentle and soft and vulnerable as Phil appeared in this moment, Natasha was doubly so, her usually inscrutable expression an easily-readable palette of affection and warmth and comfort.
This is an excellent question. Had the conversation about Stark returning to his original universe proceeded much further, this is undoubtedly an avenue that would have been investigated thoroughly.
“It ends up being a really delicate process. Some degree of burning is often healthy for the Earth, plus we don’t want to mess around with global weather patterns too much. But when the fire gets too big, or suddenly shifts direction and risks the lives of the responders or major populated areas, Thor can often turn the tide in our favour just a little bit,” explained a familiar voice from a few feet away. Tony spun to find Jane Foster seated at a makeshift desk, scrolling rapidly through several meteorological maps and projections on her laptop. Tony had really only known Jane by reputation in his own universe, but he doubted she was any less brilliant in this one. He very nearly introduced himself before she stood and threw her arms around him a tight hug. “I’m surprised you never made it out here to watch before….well, anyway. It’s great to have you here. Come sit with me and watch the show!”
Rhodes smiles. The man actually grins, and Peter wants to lose it. He wants things he would never usually consider. He wants to throw things and scream and he even wants to drink some more, because while the end stages of his encounter with Asgardian liquor were quite awful, the early hours had been fantastic. A release he hadn’t felt since before any of this.
“Actually, Flash, I remembered that Michelle was out today and inexplicably left you in charge, so I had to regain my will to live. As you can imagine, it took quite a while.”
Rhodey watched, concern painted in every line of his face.
“N-no, Sir.”
“They were, bare-handed spankings, over his knee. They—uh—hurt?” Steve tried very, very hard not to chuckle. Phil smothered his smile against Clint’s shoulder.
“Let’s maybe take a break with this and practice the interview stuff?” Tony suggested. Exchanging one kind of torture for another wasn’t exactly a relief, but at least he’d be the only one in the metaphorical hot-seat. Pepper blew a stray piece of hair out of her face and nodded, folding her legs underneath her to sit in one of the large armchairs. Next to Tony, Steve let out a grunt of relief and high-tailed it to the kitchen, muttering something about making tea for everyone.
On his day off from submission, Tony decides to take the fight to Fletcher. Steve struggles to accept Tony being in danger again, particularly when he has a realization about Iron Man.
“The entire team, including James, is also going to be in attendance as long as that’s alright with you.” Tony gasped in mock outrage and spun around to point an accusatory finger at Clint.
“No no, definitely not. I swear. Look, I get that this is all a pretty big shock, and if you want to come here right now and see for yourself that Peter is okay then that’s fine. I can have a car sent to wherever you’re at.” He paused to see if May would immediately take him up on the offer. He heard the muffled sound of what might have been a sob, and he winced. “All he’s doing right now is sleeping, and there’s a lot of things I’m not going to talk with you about without his explicit permission and involvement. Why don’t you go home, let both of you get a decent night’s rest? Then I can have you brought here first thing tomorrow morning, and we’ll get all of this sorted out.”
“I’m not gonna make you break a promise to him. But don’t kid yourself, Buck; I will
Major Content Warnings for this Ask Strange response: This chapter depicts D/s Steve in the immediate aftermath of D/s Tony's death. There is nothing overly graphic about the conditions of Tony's demise itself beyond a mention of the Avalon protocol. (This is a theory originating (I believe? correct me if I'm wrong on this) from fandom that Tony likely has protocols in the suit allowing it to keep fighting in the event of his death, and not inform the team until after the immediate danger has passed.) While it isn't explicitly stated here, BTW, my headcanon is that Tony had actually meant to take this protocol out of the suits and just didn't get around to it in time; he was not being deliberately cruel to Steve or anyone else.
Clint got there first, but he had to scramble, and Tony considered that a win.  He continued around to the passenger side and slipped into the seat.  “We all loaded up back there?” he asked, reaching for the seatbelt.
“Huh,” Sam said, making sure he had a grip on the cup before he sat back down.  “Because all the times I've hung out by your bedside after you've been injured, you've never once asked to put your head in my lap.”
After a few seconds of squinting helplessly at it, he gave up and took a step back.  There was a small, white haired man behind the front counter, bent over an old fashioned ledger that he had spread out in front of him on the glass topped display case.  Tony tapped one finger on the window.  "Hi, you open?" he asked, when the man at the counter looked up.
Tony gave him a look.  “Let me rephrase.  Do you ever feel like I don’t get the proper amount of respect?”
He looked back up, and she was standing above him, the pale moonlight casting a halo around her head.  She flicked a salute, her fingers cutting through the air.  “Give it a minute, and-”
"Right."
His knee bumped Tony’s, Tony’s elbow bounced off of his shoulder, and Steve let himself fall backwards, Tony going right along with him.  Lying flat on his back, Tony on top of him, he struggled to breathe.  “Three steps,” he managed.  “Three steps to go around the end, and you had to jump it?”
Steve made a show of looking at his watch.  “I think it’s Valentine’s Day until we go to bed.  Those are the rules.”
“Yeah, I know.” He set the screwdriver back down and braced his elbows on the workbench, his head tipping towards DJ.  “Repairs, huh?”
“Also a very poor choice,” Natasha said.
Tony stared at him, his stomach sinking.   “Okay.”  He pushed himself upright.  “If you could give us a few minutes to discuss this?”
She was moving already, her sneakers flying over the polished tile of the kitchen floor.  "Yes, Chef."
“Ten minutes,” he agreed.  Which was fine.  Time for him to grab a cup of coffee.
Ignoring the way his face burned, Steve settled into the plush seat next to her.  "Yes, ma'am."
“I was trying to determine if you were under her influence.  But there was no trace of magic on you, or any of the others, with the exception of this one.” Agatha nodded her head in Clint’s direction.  “And as I’ve said, any who think to disturb the work of a goddess soon live to regret it.”  She smiled.  “They just seldom live long.”
Steve shook his head.  "Whatever you're making, I'll eat.”  It wasn't much of an exaggeration.  “What do you have?”
Steve stared at him.  “Yes?” he said, because Sam seemed to be waiting for a response.
Steve gave him a sage nod. “Well, so they say. I've never been, myself.”
She nodded.  “Okay, well, look, same-sex marriage hasn’t been legal for all that long, and the Little Love Chapel has a long history of doing commitment ceremonies back in the dark days, so-”  Her fingers tapped against the desktop, quick and sharp. “No reason we can’t do the ceremony.  It’s just not going to be, you know…”
“Jesus, I don’t have daddy issues,” Tony said, gesturing so hard that he managed to spill coffee down his leg.  Cursing, he dropped the cup into the cupholder.  “I don’t have-”
Steve’s eyes slid shut.  “Right,” he managed.  “Right.”  Another deep breath, and another, and for the first time in days, he didn’t feel like he was choking.  He opened his eyes.  “So.”
She smiled.  “Do not confuse power with strength, little one.  You can be strong, and powerless, and you can be powerful, but lack any strength.”  She set down her cup, her fingers sliding across the surface.  DJ thought he saw the china buckle between her hands. “ It is not the force of your power that matters, it is not the size of it.  It is how use it.”  Her head tipped to the side.  “Do you understand?”
“I’m going, I’m going,” Tony said, laughing.  He headed for the door, pausing just long enough to look back at Steve.  “We’ll figure it out.”
“Jarvis said that you haven’t been sleeping well,” Steve said, and when Tony looked up at him, he smiled.  “To be honest, neither have I.”
She took it. “This just says, 'Google me,'” she said.
Greer nodded.  “Why am I in the kitchen?”
He never knew the right word.
He flinched. “I meant to,” he said, not needing her to be more specific. He knew what he was supposed to have told Tony. “I was going to. I guess it's good that I didn't, huh?”
There was a moment of silence, and then Justin lunged to his feet, knocking his chair over backwards.  It hit the floor with a crash, and Justin stood there, his hands in fists at his sides.  “I- I- I-”  His throat worked, and he gave the table a vicious push.  A wineglass wobbled on its base and tipped over, the red wine splashing across the snowy white tablecloth.  “I’m doing better than you.  Aren’t I?”  His face flushed, his eyes too bright behind his glasses, he drew himself to his full height.  “I’m doing much better than you.  And I always will.”
“Really?  Because this is exactly what I was expecting.”  Harris sidestepped around a gaggle of Gandalfs, doing his best not to take a staff to the head.  The aisles were narrow and cramped, with the booths pressing in on the limited walking space on both sides.  He glanced over his shoulder at a booth selling an array of miniature plush dragons.  On his other side, metal racks of autographed pictures loomed over him, grinning headshots fighting for space with film stills and cast photos.  They’d passed vendors selling hand carved wands and felt hats, custom fit corsets and 3D printed props, first edition books and magic tricks, licensed costumes and hand stitched cloaks.
“Yes, thank you,” Tony said, climbing in. “If we accidentally ended up on Long Island, I would not be upset, Happy.”
“It has.”  Bruce shook his hand with a smile.  “And absolutely not.”
Steve caught him, arms around Tony’s waist, the shield coming up to protect Tony’s back, his head, sheltering him the only way the Steve could manage, even as he lifted Tony physically off the ground.  For an instant, Tony’s skipped across the surface of the road, his body tight against Steve’s, his arms around Steve’s neck.
“Well, so am I, but I drank quite a bit to accomplish that,” Obie said, with a wry smile.  He leaned over, moving his fingers along the spines of the ledgers.  “Which also might explain why I have no memory of the books for that year. You should have them?”
But Stark just grinned, his face alight with amusement.  “Want me to come over there?” he offered.  He leaned against the banister of the main staircase, his posture easy and relaxed.
“You want me to call, or you’ll call when you’re done?” Steve asked, and DJ was always grateful for the way he tried to make things understandable for them both.
“No, it can’t,” Steve said.  He nudged Tony towards the couch.  “Merry Christmas, DJ.”
Tony took a breath, steadying the erratic beat of his heart.  “Is that how you seal your deals, Rogers?” he asked, and he was proud of himself, the words were steady and calm.  Almost amused.  “With a kiss?”
The arc reactor burned, it felt hot, it ached.  He tried to breathe, and he could feel it pressing in on his ribcage, could feel it pressing in on his spine, as if it was part of him, as if it was going through him, and he knew his hands were on it, covering it, clawing at it, and he.  Could.  Not.  Breathe.
“Which is, you know, you,” Tony said.  His arm tightened on Steve's waist.  “Is he-”
"You do remember-" Luke managed to surface long enough to aim a glare in her direction.  "That this is dance class, right?  You got that?"
“This is the least of my bad life choices,” Jessica said.
“I'll...  Bookmark that.”  He shook his head.  “But we both know that there's always been rumors about those two, Ning.  I mean, there's always rumors about all of them, you get that many people together under one roof and the public's sure someone's doing the deed.”
“He’s not letting this go, is he?” Drew stepped into line behind them.  Harris looked down at his tray.  Drew’s container of ‘salad’ appeared to be roughly two lettuce leaves and a cherry tomato, buried under a pile of croutons, chopped walnuts, crumbled bacon and a significant amount of blue cheese dressing.  Harris looked at Drew, who grinned, unrepentant.  “You are a truly curious specimen, Harris, and your life is one bizzare circumstance after another.  The sooner you come to terms with this, the better off you’ll be.”  He stole one of Harris’ fries. “And why are we suddenly focused on this?”
He grinned.  "Yeah, it's pretty lousy, ain't it?"  He headed for the door, the tray balanced on his hip.  "Hope you find what you're looking for, Miss."
“I will break fingers, I don't want to, but I will,” Jessica said, skittering sideways to keep the punching bag between her and the designers.  They were whispering among themselves, doing quick calculations and sizing her up from a safe distance.  Jessica gave them a suspicious look.  “You need your fingers, right?”
An instant later, he was home, and he wrenched his hand free from another set of stones, another symbol another burning glow.  He stumbled backwards, his head spinning, his eyes focused on his arm.  The blue light flickered and died, leaving black lines in its wake.
Steve nodded. “Thank you, ma’am.”
She dusted her hands off on her hips, shifting her belt, as Bucky’s head appeared, hanging upside down from the ceiling.  He glared at the back of her head, his eyes narrowed into slits, which was hard to take seriously with his hair hanging on end.  Steve tried his best to turn a burst of laughter into a cough.  Danvers grinned at him.  “You’ll both be on the shift roster by the end of the week,” she said.  “See you tomorrow for training.”
