And hit a solid, invisible wall that thrummed with a power that would not let him pass. His heart plummeted. The angel warding was still up. He could not get inside.
"He's n' ang'l n'w. C'n be with 'is own kind."
He survived nearly dying of a heart attack when the aforementioned angel showed up in the bathroom with no warning whatsoever.
The room was silent and then a familiar voice spoke up.
The voices were getting dimmer, silenced by the rush of emotion and he opened himself up to it. Tears were spilling from his eyes but he didn't care.
Lots of love and happy Groundhog Day!
"It's all right, Cas." he assured. "I understand, I don't like it, but if you think you gotta do it, I gotta believe you know what you're doing, right? Please tell me you know what you're doing."
Maybe he really was worthless. Maybe everything Alistaire had told him had been the truth. Maybe Cas was starting to realize that.
The kiss ended and Dean rested his forehead against Castiel's, eyes closed, drinking in the moment.
"Did Dad ever…do anything else? To you?"
"Please Dean."
Bobby's gaze seemed to pierce through Dean, to shine a spotlight on every twisted insecurity he had surrounding the painful memory. He wanted to run away from those words, to go back to the way he had been because at least self-loathing was familiar territory and a hell of a lot easier than seeing John Winchester as anything other than a God in his eyes. Sure his dad had been a bastard, but Dean had been his good little soldier for almost as long as he could remember. It was who he was and if he tore that down then what would be left? Dean feared that if he tried, the answer would turn out to be nothing.
"It's very nice to finally meet you. Dean talks about you all the time."
"Hmmm, I like the view from here." Dean leered as Cas climbed up him like a cat.
"So, Boyle's at it again." Dean said, "Selling folks on being meat suits for angels. Except now they're being slaughtered which means there's another player on the board. A board we can't see, with players who we have no idea about and basically have superpowers, and could kill us soon as look at us. Perfect."
They had said all they needed to say.
"...who gave heaven a second chance." He stared at Hannah. "Run, sister."
Cas shifted, bringing his hand away from Dean's side and up to cup his face, moving so he could look down into the hunter's verdant eyes. His expression was twisted in sadness.
"Hey." she said, brown hair falling in soft curls down her back, her minimal make-up enhancing her naturally delicate features, "My friends and I are wondering if maybe you guys wanted to join us?" she asked coyly.
Finally, they came to a copse of spruces and Dean sat down, letting Cas wander in and out of sight amongst the trees. He let his mind focus on the connection with the angel and felt an immense amount of concentration aimed at the surrounding wilderness. Every so often Cas would stop and stare at a tree and Dean could feel a hum start from someplace deep inside himself. As Cas drifted, the humming intensified until it felt like the whole forest was vibrating around him, coming into alignment. It built and built as the angel ran his hands over and through branches and bark, rising to a crescendo until something clicked and Dean could feel his whole being settle into perfect harmony with the surrounding area. Castiel's mind was placid, focused, at peace. It flowed into Dean, and he found himself losing all sense of time. All he was aware of was the forest. He imagined he could feel the roots that ran deep into the ground, feeding on the life-giving energy of the earth. Everything around him was singing in perfect harmony and he had to fight not to get swept away by it. There was something wrong though, a discord that sat like an oily sheen over the rest of the beauty, tainting it.
"Hey, Cas." Sam answered back. "Nice to see you again."
"Why?"
She glanced at the small crowd that had formed at her arrival, interest piqued by Sam and Dean's description of their computer genius friend.
There was a click and a dial tone and Dean hung up the phone. It didn't fix anything, having Benny exact some righteous revenge on the men who had ruined Cas' life, but it did lift the burden a little, making it easier to bear.
"What? Where?"
As always kudos to Rainbow Fruit Loop for Betaing!
Dean sat up and back against the pillows.
He pulled Castiel forwards, intent on attacking his lips again and
"So you got my text?"
“Because it crumbled. The pieces got crushed to dust by whatever’s happening inside his head right now.”
“Come on,” Dean said with an easy smile, “It’s a slow song, you just have to sway besides—”
"Son of a bitch!" Dean cursed as he stumbled back into Cas from the force of his brother's blow.
– bringing his head to rest on what had been Cas' pillow. He buried his face in it and inhaled, his mind inundated with memories of sweet moments in the early hours of the morning, waking up from a nightmare to find strong arms wrapped around him, holding him close. At those times it would take a moment for him to remember that the arms belonged to Castiel and that it was totally normal that they were there and his chest would fill with an emotion that he wanted to call love if it weren't for the fact that the idea of being in love with the man scared the shit out of him.
"What happened? Where did he take you?" Dean asked, pulling away but keeping his hands grasping Cas' shoulders.
"After all this time, after everything we have been though, are you truly still shocked by the idea that I, that anyone, might love you?"
Crowley shrugged.
"Sheriff Mills." He greeted. Crowley glanced up from his meal, an intense look in his eyes. "Hold on, Sam's here too."
"My name is Castiel. My grace was stolen by Metatron and used to cast all of the angels out of heaven."
"Yeah, I'm not seeing how this is my problem."
"The key to Oz." Dorothy said, explaining what it did and showing them a drawing of it from her journal.
Tears were trickling down his face now and Jody slung an arm around his broad shoulders, pulling him in.
"I didn't want him to do to you what he did to me."
Dean's fearful gaze verified his suspicions.
"You need to puke?" Dean asked.
"And you never felt the need to do a little exploring yourself?"
"What the hell just happened?" Dean asked as Cas pulled away and made short work of freeing him from his bonds.
Dean considered.
He gasped as the silvery blade slid in, cutting through skin and sinew. It didn't hurt, not at first, but then Metatron grinned sadistically as he twisted the blade and elicited another breathless gasp from the Winchester and Dean glanced down as the blade was pulled from his chest.
"Yes you are Dean." He spoke with such conviction that for a moment, Dean's heart skipped a beat. Castiel glanced away, looking like he was contemplating something, before turning back, "I have three older brothers." He whispered.
"Dea—ohhhhh."
"When you were nine?"
Dean smiled at Castiel's formal way of speaking, and covered the hand that sat on his knee with his own before leaning in and pressing his lips to Cas'.
He glanced at the wing that rested across his body.
"Hey!" Dean bristled at the insult
Theo grinned. "I knew it!"
Cas sighed and stood, moving to the ancient set and turning the dials. Nothing happened.
"No, I'm fine." Sam answered.
"How can you stand it though?" he asked, true confusion evident in his voice.
"Sam, you were my life. Since I war four years old, looking after you was what I did. And then you just…left. And then Dad left and it was like the only thing I was good for was looking after you and once you were gone…"
"Shut up," Dean shot back, turning back to the pancake mix, "Now get over here and cook the bacon."
Dean's eyes went wide.
"Hey Sammy."
"That is what I have heard."
He glanced over again and Cas was trying to look serious again.
Dean sighed and rubbed at his eyes.
Dean raised an eyebrow and suppressed a grin at his brother's obvious discomfort.
"So?" he asked, moving to the table and inspecting the food, "Is this your kind of thing?"
"When? How often?"
"What the hell are you talking about? Concede to what?"
Crowley ran.
A moan from the bed interrupted their quiet discussion and all three glanced over just as Dean began whimpering and thrashing around in his sleep, clearly in the throes of some nightmare.
Sam rolled his eyes and headed to the office, praying there was some sort of vacancy. He didn't particularly feel like spending the night sleeping in the car.
"No way."
"And it was you who wanted it to end."
"Let's have a look at how you're healing." He said, grabbing the hem of Cas' t-shirt and helping the ex-angel pull it up and off. Dean checked the other man's ribs, making sure nothing had been punctured and that there was no internal bleeding. Satisfied that everything was healing as it should, Dean looked up to find blue eyes watching him intently.
Sam looked pensive.
"Don't make promises you can't keep. Please."
Dean continued to pray every hour on the hour apologizing over and over, hoping the words would ease the guilt that had been building inside him since he had screamed at the angel to leave all those months ago.
Sam blinked and looked up.
"I apologize."
"Do you think it's my fault? For being away for so long?"
"No problem." Sam smiled. "Dean used to make it for me all the time when I was little so it's nice to be able to make it for someone else for a change."
"Heading out?" Sam asked.
"Aren't you gonna eat something?"
Castiel frowned.
With reflexes that spoke of his previous life as a warrior of heaven, he seized the angel blade from the metal tray, cutting a quick slice across Theo's throat and pushing him back hard against the wall, the pure light of the angel's grace beginning to seep out from the wound. Castiel opened his mouth, drinking it in and letting it fill him up with power and strength as he swallowed it down.
"I suspect it's because of me." Cas said.
"I know right?"
Dean pulled back and Cas opened his eyes, watching the hunter as he smiled back at him, pecked him softly on the forehead, and gathered him into his arms.
Dean nodded again.
"Yes."
Cas closed his eyes and sighed.
Shuffling footsteps sounded in the doorway and Sam and Cas looked around to see a still half-asleep Dean leaning against the doorframe, rubbing his eyes.
"I don't have plans to dispatch myself from this world anytime soon."
Castiel slipped the tape into the deck and soft, finger-picked guitar sounded through the car as George Harrison’s soft voice began to sing:
"Shit.” He proclaimed and sat up straighter in his chair, “How?"
"What?"
"Come on." he said encouragingly, guiding the nearly unconscious man to the bed. Cas moaned something unintelligible and Dean settled him under the covers, slipping in beside him.
Sam frowned.
"Just make life on the inside a little more eventful than they were hoping for."
Not liking the feeling of being helpless in the face of his lover's pain and grief, Dean picked up to phone to make a call that he hoped would make a small dent in the mountain of injustice that surrounded the whole situation.
Dean laughed.
"Yeah. Listen, I got a match, and it's not from the lore... it's from police records. Looks like that symbol you found was spotted at a handful of crime scenes the last couple days, all multiple homicides."
The scarred angel moved over as Malachi stepped out of the way.
"You gave us order, Castiel, and we gave you our trust." Hannah continued. "Don't lose it over one man." She held the blade out to him, hilt first. "This is justice."
"No it's…good. Calming. It's nice to feel useful and needed. To have a purpose." His gaze drifted, "And the routine of it. It keeps my mind focused and not preoccupied with…other thoughts." He refocused his gaze on Dean, "Besides, yesterday I had nothing except the clothes on my back. Now I have a job, a place to live, a friend." His lips twitched as though they wanted to smile though his eyes remained sad, "I am truly and forever indebted to you Dean Winchester."
The hunter glanced at his brother and Sam gestured leaving to which Dean nodded. Once they were alone, Dean pulled his chair around so he was sitting facing the angel, and rested a comforting hand on his shoulder.
Castiel rolled his eyes and went back to his cereal, muttering about 'stubborn Winchesters'.
Regardless of the reasons, clearly Cas' decision had been the wrong one, and who knew how much damage he had inflicted. He sat and listened to Dean struggling to control his breathing and the pitiful sounds of distress that sounded involuntarily from him, and hoped that they had not just taken two steps back.
"Mhmm." Dean murmured in agreement.
Jody sat in shocked silence for a few moments, trying to digest what she'd just heard.
He bowed his head, laying it down to rest against Cas' chest as Cas leaned back against the pillows, wrapping his arms and wings around Dean as he shrunk into a foetal position, crowding in close, as though, if he made himself small enough, he could crawl inside Cas. Cas held onto him tight.
Dean and Cas had been gone for a few hours when Kevin had come bounding into his room to tell him the 'Big News'.
"I sat in this hole for thousands of years, thinking of nothing but redemption, of reclaiming my good name." The angel's voice was trembling, with anger or fear Castiel could not tell. "I thought of nobody, no cause, other than my own."
Cas frowned in thought.
"They–they aren't very…they used to be much more impressive." His voice came out soft, hesitant.
Crowley leaned against the door once he had closed it, tilting his head back to rest against the wood. He closed his eyes. He felt a tear escape from the corner and wiped it away, staring at it with bewilderment. He couldn't remember the last time he had cried, except, of course, the other day when he got a bit weepy watching Breakfast at Tiffany's. He looked around the room that had become his haven since his newly restored humanity had rendered him a target for every demon that hadn't made it back to hell before the gates shut for good. And he thought about his insurmountable uphill battle to redeem himself to those he had hurt, tortured, killed.
"Yeah, umm, Abraham and his wife Sarah couldn't have children but when they were old, God gave them a son, Issac, and then God commanded Abraham to sacrifice Issac in order to show his faith."
"Sam."
Crowley looked over at the movement and glanced at the offering before turning his gaze back upwards in refusal.
"No!"
"In heaven." He finally looked up at Dean as he turned to face him.
"Is it really that big of a mystery?" he asked.
“What, my
"Thank you." She whispered as he caught her weight.
"Dean? Dean!" Cas said, pulling his hands up to cup Dean's face, which was buried in the pillows, eyes squeezed shut, jaw clenched as he fought against the panic welling inside him. "Dean?"
"Cas." Castiel closed his mouth and bit his bottom lip. "It was awesome."
"Let's just say, me and Cas aren't a 'phase'." He hedged.
"I was right, he is dreamy."
Enjoy!
"Not knowingly." Muriel answered, her voice catching as she fought against the pain.
"But for now I need to be an angel. I need to focus on the mission. I love you and I'm sorry."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Where was your father?"
Sam blinked. The words had been spoken in the usual gruff tones but there was something missing; an underlying anger that was just…gone.
Dean frowned but shrugged.
Castiel, who was regarding the lintel over the door, nodded.
"For what?" he asked, genuine confusion in his words.
"So…how the hell do I have grace?"
"No, I'm okay, it's Crowley." He said between breaths as Sam skidded to a halt behind them, followed a second later by the Trans who had been roused by Castiel's shouts.
"What?!"
"It's not—"
"I'm so sorry, Dean." he said, his voice soft with sorrow.
Dean flinched away from the contact, his eyes snapping open and his breathing laboured as he scuffled to the edge of the bed.
"So why are angels after you?"
Sam glared and Dean sighed.
The call ended and Dean waved to get the attention of one of the staff.
Malachi glanced between the two.
There it is! I can't believe it's over.
A knock sounded at the motel door. Thinking it might be Dean or perhaps the management, Castiel moved over and opened it, revealing a face he recognized from battles past: The Rit Zien, Ephram.
Dean's face screwed up in confusion.
"But I still did it."
Sarah gasped, bringing a hand up to her mouth and squeezing Sam’s with the other. Sam brought up a hand to stroke her back and looked like he might be sick. Bobby rubbed a hand over his face and shifted back in his chair while Jo looked like she might burst into tears and Ellen’s face hardened. She’d grown quite the protective streak for the man over the past few months.
"Oh Cas, you have no idea."
"What attributes?"
"Sure why not?"
Sam drove to their location, giving up the driver's seat at a glare from Dean and shotgun at another glare from his brother, slipping into the back while Dean and Cas got into the front.
Hellish light flickered and spat in sparks as Dean rammed Ruby’s knife deep into the Demon’s gut, before fading. He shoved the body back and it fell, its dead-weight tumbling down the front steps. Dean watched in satisfaction as the body landed and ceased to move. It always gave him a great sense of relief to dispatch the scum of the supernatural world back to whatever hell they’d clawed their way out of. It had been the center of his world for almost as long as he could remember and no matter how dark or screwed up things got, at least he had this to remind him that he could still do some good for this world.
"No, of course not, honey. Brian is an excellent name for your pet."
"Am not!"
"Here." he said, shaking out two and handing them to the injured man.
"You guys are pretty obvious." Sam said as Dean rounded the car to the diver's side.
"What's this?" he asked, pulling out the trench coat he had been eyeing.
The guy couldn't be homeless, his clothes were too nice despite the overall rumpled state and he smelled clean.
Kevin nodded.
But despite the internal pep talk, he still felt the painful lump form in his throat. Cas slid off his lap, coming down to lie beside him, taking Dean's head in his strong hands and looking at him in concern.
"Wait, Metatron?" Crowley asked.
"You're awake." The fallen angel observed unnecessarily.
He sighed.
"Hello?" he greeted, his voice flat and lifeless.
"Tell us, Dean." Sam pleaded. "Cas is right, nothing you say can change how much we love you."
"Umm," he said, "So how did you and Sam meet?"
"Yeah!" Dean shot back, turning again and glaring at the angel. "That's what I want! I want you to fuck off outta here! No one wants you here, Cas!"
Cas turned and burrowed in close, intertwining himself with Dean as though trying to merge their bodies together.
"What do you mean by that?"
Cas took in a deep breath.
"They've put their faith in me." Castiel tried to explain.
"Yes for the billionth time, I'm sure it's all right."
"Why did you do it? What were you thinking Dean?"
It didn't take Dean long to get inside.
"I'd do this." He said softly, stepping off stage, mic dropping to the ground as he pushed his way through a suddenly rowdy crowd but all Castiel could do was watch as Dean moved closer and closer until he was there and then he was in Castiel's arms again and it felt
"Yes."
"No, I don't." he said emphatically.
Takes place during 9x18 Meta Fiction
Cas glared at him before deflating.
Dean shot him a withering glance.
"What?"
Dean continued to stare at him.
Sam's voice was derisive and Dean bristled.
Baby Dean continued to cry and adult Dean look on helplessly when the door opened and a sleepy looking Mary entered with a soft smile.
Dean shook his head.
"Nah, I'll get it." Cas insisted, hopping off his stool and chugging the last of his beer, nearly overbalancing as he turned and set the empty bottle on the table, "You know, I've never done this." he said with excitement in his eyes.
Dean nodded, having grown up with a brother of his own he could attest to that.
"Nothing good."
Castiel laughed and Dean felt inexplicably angry. Castiel didn't
Cas shook his head.
"Hey, you okay?" Dean asked.
"Well?" the hunter asked, "Where do you want to start?"
"Umm, so, when I was a teenager, my Dad caught me making out with this…guy. And he wasn't too happy about it."
“Thanks.”
Because he had loved his mother and she had died. And he had loved his brother and he had left. And he had loved and trusted his father and he had betrayed him in every way imaginable. And each time it had torn away another little piece of his heart until he began to fear that nothing at all would be left if he let it happen again.
He looked down at the reverence with which Castiel was performing the deed. This was submission, this was vulnerability, this was love.
“Listen, I invited the sheriff, Jody Mills over for later.”
The voice buzzed in the back of his subconscious, but he ignored it, focused as he was on the fact that Castiel was actually here, in his arms, kissing him.
He looked down, sliding back, away from Dean and towards the other end of the sofa, wrapping his arms around his knees and curling himself up into a ball.
"Dean." he said, hiccoughing as Dean steadied him, "Everythin's spinning."
"You're dead." the formal angel commented.
He stumbled back, the stolen Grace merging with him, healing his injuries as it filled every inch of him, fusing with him, before pouring out in a blinding explosion of light. It dimmed and his eyes flashed blue and then Castiel, once more filled with the familiar thrum of divine power, looked up at the coward who had killed Dean and Muriel to protect his own hide, the coward who was gasping and bleeding against the wall. Castiel felt a righteous anger well up inside him, and without a moment's hesitation, he reached forward, clamped a hand to his forehead, and burned the life from him.
Dean sighed and set the burger back on the plate, leaning back in the booth and wiping his mouth on a napkin. He glanced out of the window and shrugged.
"What."
Sam sighed again and leaned forwards.
Sam looked thoughtful while Dean struggled to process the knowledge.
Weeks turned into months with no word from Castiel and as the time went on Dean sunk deeper and deeper into a black pit of depression that had him snapping at everyone and casting a pall over the entire bunker.
Cas appeared a few seconds later, sliding to a halt in his stocking feet, a look of devastation on his face.
"And you're a hunter-in-training. Remember?"
“Yeah it would get Sam back on his feet.”
"What? What's wrong? What did I do?"
"What?" Cas asked as he settled on the barstool.
"I watched something called 'Keeping up with the Kardashians'." He frowned, "Why are we expected to keep up with them? They do not seem to serve any purpose to society."
"This song it's…beautiful" He trailed off, not knowing how to put into words how the song was affecting him.
Dean's fists tightened on the steering wheel of the blue Dodge Challenger.
"Dean? Dean. What's wrong? Did I do something wrong? I knewI should have stopped this, I shouldn't have—"
"Dean, no."
"Open up." he said and Cas obeyed, allowing Dean to scrub his teeth. "Spit." He ordered, producing an empty glass, Cas obeyed. "Rinse." he said, handing him another glass, this one filled with water. Cas took a sip and then spat it out into the empty one. "All right, now drink the rest." he said, handing back the glass of water and standing to rinse out the glass before brushing his own teeth.
“That’s great Dean, it really is and I’m happy for you, I am. But I’m also concerned. I just don’t trust the guy.”
Dean couldn't hold the tears back and they tricked down his cheeks and dripped from his nose as Castiel's other arm came around his back and the hand that was in his hair pushed gently until his face rested on Cas' shoulder. He brought up his hands to fist Castiel's shirt.
Enjoy!
Dean shot him a look that said he understood what Sam was saying, but he was reaching his chick flick quota for the century. Sam sighed and then frowned.
Dean, who had been watching Cas' movements hypnotically, snapped back to attention and he looked up and smiled.
"What?! You died?"
He waited with bated breath, wondering who he would see shining out of those brilliant blue eyes: Emmanuel or Castiel.
"Definitely took more than one or two killers to pull this off." he agreed, taking in the scorched wing marks; much smaller than those of other angels he'd seen, a sign of their low ranking as Cas had explained.
Dean glanced up into Castiel's blue-eyed gaze.
"He's not here." He told Sam who was slumped in the passenger side of the bench seat, head resting against the window.
do not
"I did what I had to." Theo countered
Sam let out a cough that sounded suspiciously like "pining" and Dean fixed him with a withering glance that Sam was sure he had learned from Cas.
anything. The part of himself that had been Jimmy Novak, that had married and loved Amelia Novak, still mourned her death, still cried for her and felt the ache of loneliness and separation and loss. But the part of him that was Castiel, that had woken, hung-over in Dean’s apartment and worked at the Roadhouse and had taken the leap and kissed Dean that night two months ago on the couch, didn’t care. Because he loved Dean, thanked God for Dean, found safety and comfort in his embrace and strength to go on in his sparkling green eyes.
Dean sighed.
Cas sat up and back, frowning.
The door opened and Hannah entered.
"The angels were after me. I…I didn't want to bring them down on you."
"Happy Birthday, Dean."
A primal, grief-ridden sob tore from his chest as he wept for his lost daughter and wife. Dean could feel the tears staining his checkered flannel shirt and he couldn't possibly care less because the big secret that Castiel had been carrying around with him since they had met was out in the open and it was more heartbreaking than he could ever have imagined. There were no words to sooth this pain, nothing he could say or do to alleviate the suffering of the man he was beginning to, had already, fallen in love with. So he just sat there on an overturned crate out behind the Roadhouse and held onto Castiel as tightly as he could while the man cried broken and heart wrenching sobs into his chest, mourning his pain and loss.
"But I was afraid." Sam admitted in a small voice.
Dean shrugged, "And what?"
He raised his hand and brushed it through the fallen angel's dark hair, running the pad of his thumb gently over his cheek. Cas brought his own hand up to cover it, long, gentle fingers curling around Dean's.
"Come on Dean, it's a good movie. A
Why did he get to ignore everything and bury his head in the sand?
Cas sighed.
"I'm sorry." Castiel offered by way of comfort.
Sam shook his head.
For a moment, just a moment, Castiel forgot about everything else. Everything that had happened, the loss, the grief, all of it just faded away and he felt…not exactly happy, but secure. Like maybe he would be okay. And that was a hell of a lot better than he had felt in a very long time.
"When she was recruiting those students to be vessels." Sam sighed, as he looked at the photos on the web, "Wow. It's a bunch of kids."
"They said you killed Tessa?" Cas asked warily. He didn't want to believe it, didn't want to believe that another of his brethren was dead.
Castiel nodded.
"When I rescued Dean from hell, his soul was…damaged, in tatters. Nothing compared to what you went through in the cage, but it had begun to twist, to taint. It was in the very earliest stages of becoming a demon."
"Because it hurts too damn much when it goes away."
"Cas is dying." Dean coughed. "His grace is fading and there's no telling whether or not he'll find a way to stop it." He looked up into his brother's concerned eyes. "We were never meant to last. You know that. We had what we had. And that was enough. Hell, it was more than I ever deserved."
He looked up at the figure still chained to the chair above him.
Definitely no moping.
(See the end of the chapter for
Gabriel was just as snarky and terrifying as Dean had remembered and when they all stared at him silently after Castiel had excused himself to go to the bathroom, Dean seriously doubted that he would come out well in a fight if even one of them made good on their promise to hurt him if he hurt Cas, let alone if all three of them reigned down their wrath on him.
"Happy birthday, Dean." the angel greeted, apparently not bothered by the blade at his throat.
Let me know what you thought!
"I'll give you one last chance for this to end."
"The truth is…" he started and hesitated as his heart began to pound and his palms began to sweat and was he actually going to do this? He glanced over at Cas who was starting at him with open adoration and love expressed in his serene expression and Dean knew that no matter what he did, whether he talked or not, Cas and Sam would be there for him. He shifted in the cheap plastic chair and cleared his throat. "The truth is, when I was a teenager, I was…raped."
Dean stood and pulled his flask of holy water from an inside pocket. Unscrewing the cap, he doused the chained man.
"That's not true, Cas."
“Hey.” He said softly.
"No, it's not. I should never have said those things. I didn't mean them, Cas, none of them. I was just angry and scared and when you walked out…" His voice cut out and he squeezed his eyes shut, trying desperately to control his breathing before he continued. "When you walked out, I guess a part of me figured you'd be better off without me and my mess."
Still, a part of Dean didn't want the man to go walk out of his life. There was just something about him. Something that intrigued Dean, infused his ordinary mundane life with some much-needed colour and light.
Dean shrugged.
Dean sighed.
Cas looked up, gratitude slowly overcoming the shame.
"It's not like there's gonna be any monsters there." Dean assured.
"By 'this' do you mean you?"
The Things we Hide is still alive and well if you want more to read.
"You are not fine Dean, you are feeling lonely and abandoned. Why?"
Dean shrugged.
The blue eyes were examining him again.
Beta'd by Rainbow Fruit Loop
Cas sighed.
. Because at least if Dean was around he could keep an eye on his father and look out for his little brother.
"Shut up."
"Okay. Well," Dean said, changing the subject, "we can't do much else from here. Let's go get a bite or something and come up with a game plan.
"You want my help?" he asked suspiciously.
"I only came because you wouldn't stop bugging me until I agreed."
Cas smiled.
"You first." Dean demanded.
Dean rose to match Cas' seated position, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes as he did.
"Get away with what?" Metatron asked smugly. "You told a silly story to a group of less-than-believers. I'll clean up your mess in an hour."
Dean shifted and shook his head as though trying to wipe the thought away like an etch-a-sketch before his overly observant, pain in the ass, nosy little brother could catch on. She couldn't have meant that right? Not
The fear inside Dean was rising steadily.
"Sheriff." Dean greeted as Sam and Cas got out, Sam moving in to give her a hug.
"She's taking people who break their vow, right?"
Cas frowned in consideration as he listed back and forth before glancing up at the hunter.
Sam nodded and shared a glance with Castiel.
She smiled, but her eyes remained sad.
Castiel blanched.
"Yeah me too." Sam agreed.
"Oh, thank heaven, Dean." he murmured as he pressed a fierce, impassioned kiss to his lover's lips, pressing their foreheads together as Cas fought to control his breathing and Dean struggled to process what was going on.
He watched the clouds pass, the kite a splash of vivid red against the blue of the sky. He heard birds chirping and wind rustling through the grass.
"Don't." His voice was quiet, tired, "Please don't think this had anything to do with you." He looked up, attempting a smile through the devastation still sitting plain on his face, "It was nice, up until…"
"So I went to a bar, picked up a guy, and we went back to my motel room."
"What did you do yesterday that used up that much grace?" Dean asked once Cas had pulled away.
Cas did not think he would ever tire of this particular activity.
Cas leaned against him, heads touching as he wrapped an arm around the other man. Dean smiled at the contact and brought his own arm up to rest over Cas' upper back, pulling him in closer as they continued to listen to the song.
"He was a little subdued, but I believe he will be okay. Did you find anything out?"
Dean's silence was all the confirmation Sam needed. Shit. No wonder Dean had seemed so upset at seeing the memory when they were in heaven. Knowing that one of Sam's happiest moment resulted in one of Dean's worst.
Crowley frowned up at him, more surprise at the gruff hunter speaking to him at all than confusion at what he was saying.
"Hey, ummm." Cas stopped and turned, "Take care of Dean okay?"
"Hello, Dean."
"Yeah."
"It could be at times." Castiel answered, the sarcasm flying right over his head, "Although there were times where it felt like hell."
"For a few weeks I suffered from aphasia. It's the inability to properly comprehend or express language. I had trouble understanding people when they spoke to me, as though they were speaking a foreign language except that I knew it was English. I also had problems finding the correct words for things. I still have trouble sometimes interpreting subtleties in tone like sarcasm and the brain trauma coupled with damage to my neck and chest caused one of my vocal chords to become paralyzed which is why my voice sounds the way it does."
Once the paper had fallen clean of the box, he stared at the gift, eyes wide and mouth open as honour and disbelief wafted through the connection.
"I love you." He breathed.
"I revived you."
Bonny did turn out to be Vesta, and after tailing her to the site where she had imprisoned her victims, Sam sprung the trap on her, which overall could have gone better as Jody would comment later at the ER as she had the hole in her shoulder patched and a sling fitted.
Cas smiled and dipped lower; fanning his breath over the thin layer of cotton that separated him from Dean's ever growing interest and Dean keened and panted above him.
Castiel himself had been understandably quiet for the past few days. Dean had asked if he wanted a few days off from work but Cas refused. He said work helped and indeed, he threw himself into his job, operating at nearly robotic levels, his words few and far between and his eyes closed off.
"Yes." Cas nodded. "It is customary to name one's pets, is it not? Hmm."
He shifted and opened his eyes.
Dean shook his head.
"We…need your help." came the terse response.
Cas looked around at the unlikely collection of people seated around the table.
"I've got to man. I owe it to Cas, and if I don't do it now…I don't know if I'll be able to work up the courage to do it again."
He cleared his throat.
"He yelled at Dean, called him weak. Said he wasn't a man. That mom would have been ashamed of him. And then…"
He glanced over at the desk where Metatron's microphone, tuned into the wavelength of sound all angels used to communicate with each other, was on and broadcasting. The door flew open and angels upon angels crowded in, grabbing Metatron as Castiel stood, cuffs banished, and raised his blade.
Cas insisted on getting the tree himself. He also said he wanted to do it alone but Dean was having none of that; after the long weeks spent apart, there was no way he was letting the angel out of his sight.
"At first, I tried to visit him every night in his dreams. At least then, even though I was far away, we could still be together. But my operation…we are all angels. We do not require sleep. And neither do Metatron and his supporters, so we have been forced to work around the clock, which leaves me precious little time during which I can visit Dean. Do you think…do you think maybe he has misinterpreted my absence as disinterest?"
"Dean said that you died."
"Before, when I became human, I always had the hope that I might one day restore my grace. It wasn't a great hope, and for the most part I was content to live out my life as a human, especially since Dean and I..." He sighed and rubbed tiredly at his eyes. "But there was a chance, there was still hope that my grace was still out there."
"Why are you doing this?"
Cas' mouth turned up in a small smile.
"Hey!" he announced, bounding into the library and pulling on his jacket as he went, "I caught a possible case. Rexford, Idaho. Bunch of people have gone missing from their homes and a strange substance has been reported at the scene."
"Sometimes I forget…that I'm not an angel anymore, and all I want to do is protect you, like I used to." he looked over at Dean, pain shining through his blue eyes. "But I'm not, Dean…I'm human." he said softly.
"Perfect." he muttered. "Okay, we know that there are at least two factions warring with each other, lead by…"
"Fuck off, Cas!" Dean yelled, throwing it off angrily and stalking away, back turned to the angel. "Just go!"
"We can hear and feel each other's thoughts and emotions."
"Oh," Castiel reddened as he picked up the toothbrush, sounding mortified, "I…I didn't know."
Cas sat in silence for a few moments, staring up at Dean from where his head rested against the seat before speaking up.
Cas nodded and nearly overbalanced.
"Okay, got it." Sam said when it popped up on the screen.
Castiel shivered from the touch.
"What?" He asked, his voice still raspy from the coughing fit and his tone dangerous; warning Sam to tread carefully.
"What? Why?"
"Look, will you just drop it? I apologized for ganking Amy and I explained why. Isn't that enough?"
"Yeah, Dean. You could have."
"What? Why?" Sam asked, wondering what had been so bad that Dean would willingly go to the hospital.
Sam nodded.
She smiled falsely.
"Thank you, Ingrid." Gadreel greeted with a smile and the two entered Metatron's office, the door closing behind them.
Dean shrugged.
"Never mind that you promised you wouldn't leave, but hey! If that's what you want, fine! I don't even want you here! I don't even
Without any sort of conscious thought process, Dean found himself leaning forward and pressing his lips against Castiel's.
"You guys maybe wanna tell me what just happened?"
"Crowley? It's Castiel."
Castiel nodded.
"Castiel." the wannabe God greeted as they came into the room. "Bet you're not happy to see me."
He sat.
"To Stanford. I know I wasn't very happy to see you. But I'm glad you did."
"Sam—"
Dean and Cas lay in bed, sleepy and sated, the thick veil of post orgasmic bliss settling over them as they sought comfort in each other's embrace.
"'Cause I'm not worth it." He said softly.
"But I don' wanna go." he protested, swaying slightly. "I wanna try more drinks with strange names like…" he picked up the menu and squinted at it, "Fuzzy Navel." He looked back up at Dean who had grabbed the suit jacket Cas had shucked earlier, and was holding it out. And which Cas was ignoring, "Whas ina Fuzzy Navel, Dean?"
Sam watched his brother leave, rolling his eyes and shaking his head.
"And?"
A bell dinged and the swirling mass of light coalesced into an elevator. The doors opened and Cas was manhandled by Gadreel into an orderly office of angels, where they were met by Hannah and another angel Castiel did not recognize.
"I know." He answered simply. "I know."
Anyway, hope you like!
"Well? Did you?"
"They gave me power and swayed my mind, just as your father's words and that other man's actions swayed yours, but that does not mean that either of us wanted it to happen. I know that at the time I enjoyed the power flowing through my veins. But looking back on it now, it makes me sick to think that I was ever capable of such deeds and that is what matters most."
Sam shook his head.
Sam frowned.
He turned to Cas and held up his hand, palm forward and paused. Cas frowned in confusion as he looked from Dean's hand to his face, sensing that he was meant to be doing something but unsure what that something was.
"Hey, hey, what's wrong?" Dean was now flush with him, his hands on Castiel's shoulders, "Do you have more injuries that you didn't tell me about because so help me Cas…"
"She gave me a letter to deliver."
"The remnant of my grace in you felt the grace in me and…"
A movement to his side caught his eyes and he looked to see Charlie holding out the microphone to him with an eager look in her eyes. Up on stage, Dean was looking around at the darkened crowd for the next question.
Dean could feel his body shaking. His lips trembled and he pursed them tightly to try to get them to stop. Tears burned in his eyes. He took in a breath.
Dean shrugged his shoulders in a façade of disinterest.
"You too."
"Dean, how could you think that?"
Castiel nodded.
"Yeah Cas, that part I got. I meant why?"
Cas shook his head in mounting horror.
“Congratulations Mrs. Winchester, you look lovely in your dress.”
"Wait!" Charlie screeched, practically vibrating with excitement and earning a dirty look and a curt 'shhh!' from another hotel employee attending to a rich looking couple a few feet away. Charlie stuck her tongue out at him before turning, a triumphant smile on her face, "I know where he is."
“I miss you guys so much and I will always love you.”
Something in the bowels of the car pinged and rattled and the speed gradually decreased until the vehicle sputtered and lurched and finally came to a stop.
"It is your birthday. I wished to surprise you."
And then Dean threw himself at the angel and wrapped his arms tightly around him, burying his face in his collar and his fingers in the small feathers that lined the base of his wings and
Castiel was frantic the whole way back to Missouri. Between Dean's silent cry of shock and the angels calling for his blood, Sam couldn't drive fast enough for his liking. It was times like this he really missed his wings.
"And now he's working for Metatron?"
Thanks to everyone who's read and reviewed and favourited and followed! My life is in a bit of an upheaval at the moment and every single alert I get makes dealing with this a lot easier.
Castiel had torn apart the office searching for the tablet, but it was nowhere to be found. He stood in the wreckage of the room, panting as his strength left him. He could feel what little grace he had left burning away inside him and he suddenly knew his time was well and truly running out. He scanned the room, trying to imagine where Metatron might have hidden his most prized possession, when his eyes lit on the typewriter that sat on his desk upon which Castiel recalled Metatron typing when he had been taken prisoner. He moved towards it, rounding the desk and lifting it to reveal the glowing tablet inside.
Sam shifted in his seat.
"Yes. But we must go. Malachi is bound to come back sooner or later, and there are other angels here who deserve to be freed."
"No, Dean. You're too wound up about this. Go find Cas. I'll be fine."
"Forgiveness can be very healing." Cas said in a formal tone, sounding more like his old self than he had since the fall.
Castiel smiled and took Dean's hand, interlacing their fingers and squeezing.
"But also hot angel boys with endless blue eyes the colour of the Indian Ocean." She trailed off, a wistful look on her face before frowning and shaking her head.
Sam shut his laptop with a frustrated sigh.
The woman, Nora as her nametag read, smiled and handed him his change.
"What is it? What's wrong?"
"No wait!" he implored, not wanting the hours he had spent praying to have been in vain. "Please, just hear me out."
"He is mine?" he asked with breathless wonder.
"Bring him back." He said, "Bring him back."
"I'm not." Crowley said truthfully.
He left the guinea pig in his cage on the library table with a note to Sam to take good care of him. Not that he would expect anything else from his oversized brother.
no clue what to get his angelic boyfriend for Christmas. Not that he'd actually discussed the idea with Cas yet. For some reason the thought of calling his boyfriend to ask if he wanted to celebrate Christmas with him was even more terrifying than the idea of buying a gift for him. He told himself it was because his boyfriend was an ancient, celestial being who had rebelled against, and gotten kicked out of, heaven more than once and that was the
Dean's eyes widened.
Dean grinned and nodded, shaking the hand in his before letting it go.
"But what if there are? We still don't know what we're dealing with."
"And you." she said, pointing at Cas. "Take care of my boys here."
They nodded mutely.
They pulled apart and Dean moved his hand to Castiel's shoulder, giving it a comforting squeeze.
"I love you too, Dean."
He trailed off, his throat closing painfully until Cas took pity on him and pulled him in for a hard kiss. It was a kiss full of want and need and desperation and Dean grabbed at Cas' clothes, wrinkling the tan coat where he held it in tight fists. Cas, for his part, held equally firmly to Dean as he delved his tongue into the hunter's mouth, trying to convey the desire he could feel pooling low in his belly. They broke off gasping, fingers tangling in hair and foreheads resting against each other as they caught their breath. Castiel let his hand run down the hunter's black t-shirt, resting it flat against his chest and feeling the strong, steady pounding of the heart that he was determined would keep beating for a very long time to come.
Cas stopped her.
Dean lifted Cas, grabbing him around his torso as Cas' arms came up to wrap around Dean's neck. He managed to get the two of them to the car, Cas stumbling along side him.
Cas dropped his head.
Castiel was introduced to Ellen's daughter Jo, and Ash, who worked at the Roadhouse in exchange for use of their backroom which doubled as his workshop. Despite first appearances, he seemed to be some kind of computer genius or at least that's what Jo said. He had apparently been at MIT before being kicked out.
"Gadreel was his second in command." Castiel reasoned. "For what other reason than the truth would he turn against Metatron?"
"Cas, I've never, and I mean never, seen Dean this relaxed or happy or content. I didn't even think it was possible for my brother to be like this. And that's all because of you."
"No, no, no. I already ruled them out. The bodies were vaporized. They weren't burned."
He didn't say anything. He didn't have to, Cas could feel the gratitude overflowing through the connection and he beamed as it filled him up. Eventually Dean let go and sat back, his eyes suspiciously moist and a wide smile on his face. Sam looked bewilderingly at the two of them.
The voice paused for a beat.
"Maybe it's the calm before the storm?" he offered.
"In me?"
"The ones to close heaven?"
"As in the Angel of the Lord Castiel? Trench coat wearing, sarcasm impaired, 'I am the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition' Castiel?"
"Cas?"
But it was too late because Castiel had already placed his hand on Sam’s forehead and Sam’s eyes flashed with a hellish red light that flowed in tendrils out of Sam and into Cas.
He looked back at Dean.
"Well," Dean said contemplatively, "We do have one sure-fire way of getting her here."
"Jody." Sam said once Dean had hit the speaker button and set the phone down on the table in between them.
Back at the bunker Dean stood in front of Crowley's door. He had so far avoided the former demon as much as possible, especially after his recent activities, but a promise was a promise so Dean squared his shoulders and knocked firmly on the door, opening it and stepping inside when he was invited.
"But I still don't understand, where are the sheep?"
"You know I'm right."
Sam fell to the floor, panting and coughing, the ground in front of his mouth growing red with flecks of blood. With shaking hands he lifted the paper with final chant written on it, whispering the words between deep, hacking coughs. His arms lit up with pure celestial light, spreading through his body until he was glowing out of every pore. And then he turned onto his back and screamed, light shooting out of him until it filled the entire abandoned church with blinding luminescence.
"He is the key to fixing everything that is wrong. I'm going to find him."
Sensing an imminent private conversation, both Kevin and Sam vacated the library, leaving the hunter and his angel alone.
"It was nothing." he said softly, but the grin stayed and Dean basked in the secondary glow of joy that Cas was feeling from being able to help Sam. "Just happy to help."
"Just in case you end up coming with us on hunts." Dean said by way of explanation, then added with a smirk, "Maybe this time we'll actually get a suit that fits you."
Dean brought his hand up to caress the other man's cheek, rubbing across the growth of beard and tangling in his hair, his gaze growing sad.
He stood, wincing as the movement irritated his injuries, and brought the plate over to the sink. "I wish that we had met under better circumstances."
"I don't know, Sam. She was saying all kinds of crap."
"Someone should probably go say sorry to Crowley for not believing him." Linda said, looking pointedly at Kevin who crossed his arms defiantly and steeled his jaw, giving off a clear signal that that 'someone' would not be him.
"Thanks." Dean said softly. "For kicking my ass earlier. I needed it."
"Sam?"
"No." He shook his head. "It's too dangerous."
"This is a bonus, Castiel. We were tracking Muriel, cowardly holdout that she is," he glanced over at the beaten and bloody angel who was tied to a metal post along with Dean, "and wonder of wonders, she led us to you and your little pet."
Cas blushed.
She shook her head.
"What do you think about doing Christmas this year?"
"I know you can't ever forgive me. And that's all right. I don't deserve to be forgiven, I know that. But our…communication has saved me in ways you can't even understand, and for that I am truly thankful."
"How?"
He locked eyes with Sam and smiled.
"Yeah? Why would she do that, Dean?" Sam asked sceptically as he un-cuffed his brother.
As Emmanuel, Cas was unburdened. Content. The way he’d been before Dean had entered his life and bulldozed it as he did with everything he touched.
"I think they're awesome." he said, and it was the truth. Despite their rather haggard look, the wings were still massive and cool. He couldn't help reaching a hand out and stroking over them. Cas closed his eyes and shuddered as Dean's fingers brushed across the down that was just as soft as it looked. The wing twitched and moved quickly out of the range of Dean's hand.
Okay, so life got seriously crazy for me in the past few months, like quitting my job, going back to school, and moving all at the same time kind of crazy, but now that I have time to breath...It's done! just got to do some re-reading and put some finishing touches on the epilogue but only two chapters to go after this.
Dean stood and went to retrieve a large, rectangular object that sat in the corner by the tree with a blanket draped over it.
So who was in the bunker?
He felt Michael’s strong arms wrap tightly around him and for the first time in his entire life, he felt totally and completely alone.
They were sitting in baggage claim at Kansas City Airport waiting for the American Airlines flight 257 from San Francisco.
I love every single one of you who took the time to immerse themselves in my little world and especially those who commented.
"No, it's really none of my business." Sarah said, "I sorry for bringing it up."
"Fine."
"I'm sorry, Dean." Sam said, continuing to squeeze his big brother tightly. "I'm so sorry."
"Shut up." Dean said, making his way to the staircase and beginning the slow descent down.
Dean fought to keep his expression calm as his heart pounded against his chest.
"Oh!" he said, stopping short when he caught sight of the younger Winchester. "I'm sorry, I didn't realize anyone else was up."
"Will tha' be yer pet n'me f'r me?" he asked, his slurred words getting sloppy as he began to drift off. Dean prayed he wouldn't pass out before they got a room. Of course Cas would turn out to be a drowsy drunk.
"Are you any of those things?" Dean asked
"No, you shouldn't." she said softly. "You shouldn't have had to do any of that. Just like Dean shouldn't have had to hide it or gone through it at all. All of this is on your father. None of it is on either of you."
Sam nodded in agreement.
"Sorry, I just umm…"
He looked away. And did not look back to see whether or not Gabe had complied to his wishes.
Sam glanced around and his eye caught on a small metal garbage can, which he managed to grab and shove in front of him before Dean retched. Sam took a seat beside his brother, rubbing his back as the booze Dean had been putting back all night made its reappearance. Dean had likely been drinking on an empty stomach since Sam had noticed a significant drop in his brother's eating habits lately. This was getting ridiculous, this forced separation, and Sam rubbed tiredly at his eyes as Dean continued to vomit. That was it, tomorrow he was going to sit his brother's stubborn ass down and force him to call Castiel. None of this 'I'm not worthy' bullshit.
He told himself this, hoping he would believe it. Metatron lied. Metatron lied all the time. There was no reason to believe him. Dean was fine. Dean had to be.
"…so then we ended up burning the forest down so that we wouldn't be killed by the apple grenades the trees were launching at us." Dorothy finished her story to silence while Dean nodded appreciatively at the top-notch hunting, Castiel frowned in interest and confusion, not having any context for the story, and Charlie just looked devastated as yet another piece of her childhood was overwritten.
“It sucks.” She said, “And it doesn’t get better. It doesn’t heal and it doesn’t go away.” They pulled apart and Castiel stared down into her sad brown eyes, “You just learn to live with the pain, you learn to manage it. You find ways to make it bearable. It’s like losing a limb. You find new ways to do all the things you used to do but the reminder is always there. Of what you lost, of what’s missing.”
"Dude, you're so whipped!"
Dean's stomach churned.
"But then you came along, and you saved me Dean Winchester. Raised me from my perdition. You gave me…hope, distraction, a purpose. You gave me a chance to move on."
“Neither.” Sam said enigmatically, “It’s in Kansas City. And, since the commute isn’t too bad, Sarah and I put an offer in on a house in Lawrence. I’m coming home Dean.”
Dean's whole body tensed at the words and Castiel pulled back to look up at him.
Gabriel had called to invite Cas back to Illinois for Christmas but he had refused, not yet ready to face his family and go back to his old life. So instead he accepted Dean’s invitation to join him and his patchwork family for the holiday, with Dean assuring him that if things got bad and he needed to leave, they would leave. No questions asked. Castiel had felt his heart soar when Dean had said that. To think that he was lucky enough to find a man so caring, so giving, so selfless that he would be willing to cut short his holiday celebrations with his family for Castiel’s sake. Cas determined that he would stick this out, no matter how painful it may become, because Dean had damn well earned that.
"Yeah." He admitted.
"It will reduce my power, but I have been human for the past few months. I believe I will be able to survive."
Crowley stepped into the library as Kevin laid the phone down, letting out an exhausted sigh as he ran his fingers over his tried eyes.
Sam nodded.
"You can really feel all that?"
Dean looked to Sam, who shrugged. He rolled his eyes.
He reached up a hand to stroke Castiel's cheek.
"Shut up, Dean."
Sam nodded.
"Mmm no." Dean answered. "Woke up and you weren't there. Didn't like it." Dean lifted his head to plant a sideways kiss on the angel's head.
They were shown around the church by a buttoned up red-head in a purple cardigan and peter-pan collar named, quite aptly, Bonny. Eventually they ended up in the office where Sam managed to broach the subject of the missing people and they discovered that all four of them had been part of the same chastity group.
"Commander, I'm sorry, but you have a call. From Metatron."
Sam swallowed hard.
The angel moved to Sam’s bedside, sitting down and rolling up his sleeves. He glanced back at Dean and said cryptically, “It’s better this way.” He turned back to Sam, “I’ll be fine.”
Sam shrugged.
"Kevin's translated part of the tablet into a dead language. We were hoping you could help us read it."
Kevin shut the door behind him and turned to the man on the bed.
Cas seemed to have realized that he still held Dean's face in his hands because he blushed and lowered them, leaning back from Dean.
"This wouldn't have anything to do with losing Cas would it?"
The words sent a spike of cold fear through the belly of the gruff hunter. John Winchester had been a good man, a good hunter, but he had had his blind spots and a raging temper, especially when he'd been drinking, had been a particularly bad one.
"No."
"So Sam, any plans on moving in any time soon…?"
He stood, shoving away the hands that reached for him, and fled.
He looked back.
"No I'm not!"
"Can you brush your teeth?"
Dean sat confused for a moment, his brain still in the process of waking up.
Bobby watched the older Winchester. His normally animated face was blank. Like some part of his personality was…absent.
Dean’s ingrained need to save Sam warred against his desire to protect Cas as he watched the angel march into battle with only the vague hope that instinct would take over and that some small part of Cas would remember who and what he was.
"Dean, I have to go." Cas said softly, once they were alone, anger burning beneath the surface of his calm words. "I have to do something."
"You have any idea about this stuff?" he asked the former advanced placement student.
"I dunno. I guess." Dean felt a blush creep up his neck to heat his face. He'd never thought of his sexuality in those terms, preferring instead to ignore any urges towards his own gender in favour of those towards the opposite. He and Sam had never had to define their sexualities; at least not to each other. But now, with the cat out of the bag, it felt oddly…satisfying to label it, it made the whole subject seem less intimidating somehow.
Dean had heard those words spoken so many times in exactly the same tone and voice that sound of it soothed Dean with its familiarity and Dean began to let himself hope that maybe it would all be okay. That Meg had just been messing with them when she'd hinted at there being a problem. That whatever mysterious power had brought Cas out of the lake, be it God or who knew what, had fixed him. Properly fixed him.
"A what?"
And then Castiel’s hand was on the demon’s head and blinding light was pouring out of every orifice before it dropped to the floor, eyes burned out.
Sam closed his eyes and let out a frustrated sigh. Of course Dean hadn't talked to Cas and of course Cas would blame himself for not knowing what to do. It was a wonder the two of them had made it this long.
"No worries. Say Dean?"
And Dean needed to tell him; Dean needed to get this secret out before it ate away at him until there was nothing left.
Dean nodded.
He did
Dean nodded, "Well, we'll just have to keep an eye on those dicks. What'd you guys come up with?"
Once it was all over with, Dean, Cas, Dorothy, and Charlie, found themselves in the straightened up kitchen enjoying Dean's homemade burgers and listening to Dorothy regale them with tales of her adventures in Oz, the real stories. Kevin and his mother had retired to their rooms having had enough excitement for one day, and Sam had crashed after the adrenalin rush that had sustained him though the entire ordeal died down and was passed out in his room.
"So, since Castiel is going to be sticking around indefinitely are you going to tell him how you really feel about him so that you two can finally stop dancing around each other and save everyone having to watch you two eye-fucking every time you're together?"
"I won't ever willingly leave you either."
"Are you attempting to imply something?"
"My father owns an auction house in New York where I'm from so I volunteered. We got to talking and found out we had something in common: loss."
and if so
The concierge looked up from his computer and Castiel said in a breathless voice, "Dean Winchester's room please."
"It's all right." he murmured, rubbing soft circles into the distressed angel's back. "I'm here, babe. I'm not going anywhere."
Dean once again threw his arm off and stalked away a few feet, his back turned to his brother.
"As for what I told you today…" he paused and shook his head, "I don't really know how I feel about that yet. It's not something I like to think about all that much, or at all. And I still can't really understand how you and Cas can be fine with it." He sighed again, shoulder's slumping and eyes tired. "Let's just celebrate my birthday and enjoy this fucking beautiful, fucking freezing nature walk."
Cas stared out at the road that lay before him. The road that held so much promise and potential but which had ended up leading him to nothing but loneliness and defeat as he continued warring against his brothers and sisters in a fight that he felt obligated to participate in, but which was slowly tearing him apart on the inside.
"Are you…?"
"Thank you, Sam. It's good to be back."
"You're lying." he said, staring at the ex-demon with eyes full of hatred.
Sam started to calm down as he listened to his brother’s explanation.
"THEY ARE NOT WORTH YOUR LIFE!" Crowley shouted.
"I've never thought about it that way."
Dean looked at Sam long and hard before nodding and averting his eyes, chalking the lump growing in his throat to the fact that he was hungover and not because he was genuinely touched by what Sam had said.
Blue eyes framed by long, dark lashes blinked open. Focusing in the dim light of the room, they settled on Dean's face and Cas' mouth relaxed into a content smile.
Cas turned and laid a hand on Claire's shoulder, pulling her gently towards them.
Sam tried to take it all in.
Crowley showed no signs of attempted suicide as the days passed and eventually he was left to his own devices once more, albeit with a markedly improved number of visitors and invitations to join in the various gatherings about the bunker, if only so they could keep a better eye on him.
"Does Dean seem different to you?" His voice was soft, quiet. Sam contemplated lying, or at least glossing over the truth to save the angel's feelings, but ultimately he decided that there had been enough lying already. He didn't need to be adding to that.
"Trying?" Hannah spat back. "By killing Metatron?"
"I look forward to seeing you Dean."
He turned back to the open road, closing his eyes against the pain that had taken over once the anger had died down. He couldn't go back, couldn't face the possibility of Dean yelling at him like that again, the hatred in his eyes and words had practically radiated from the other man.
Castiel beamed back up at him as his fingers continued carding through the hair.
Sam couldn't help smiling at the angel's thought process.
Dean.
He was still sitting there, real and solid in front of him, but the constant presence in his mind on which he had come to rely more than he had thought possible, was gone. And the resulting emptiness, like the silence after an explosion, seeped into him, consuming and eating away at everything it reached until he felt hollowed out, bare and exposed.
Dean raised an eyebrow.
Sam sighed.
About thirty minutes later, the door to the kitchen opened again and Gabriel emerged alone. He looked up at Dean where he was wiping down the same spot at bar that he had been at for the past half an hour.
Dean felt his heart break for the man and pulled him in tight.
"It's a reference to a very popular film that- never mind." Castiel suddenly had a new appreciation for the frustration Dean always seemed to exhibit whenever one of his references went over Castiel's head.
He stared at it, trying to wrap his still partially asleep mind around the sight. He raised his head, following the line of sight from the plume down to the wing that was draped over him and splayed out across the bed, a comforting weight that made him feel inexplicably peaceful and safe; the way he had as a child when his mom would tuck him in, laying a soft kiss on his forehead and smiling down at him, calm and serene. He had never felt like that after she died, although he had done everything in his power to try to give Sam the same experience. Lord knows how well he'd succeeded, but he'd given it his best shot.
"Charlie. Come on, I'll call her." He said, taking out his phone as he and Sam left the room.
Another rush of ladies stole away Dean's attention but he still kept an eye on the guy and as the night wore on and the crowd thinned, Dean finally found an opportunity to approach him when it looked like his glass could use a refill.
Castiel glanced back at the dead vessel before turning back to Dean.
Sam, who was helping her out of her coat, paused and glanced at Dean who answered, "Uh, yeah, but don't worry, he won't be joining us."
“He didn’t want to hear it.”
"What?"
"It's overwhelming." he answered. "It's disgusting."
There was a pause and when he spoke again, there was an audible smile in Castiel's gruff voice.
Dean's head shot up and a smile grew where his frown had been.
"Wanted to what?"
He squeezed the steering wheel in frustration.
“It’s a wonderful idea, but…”
"Dean!" Bobby yelled as he heard the front door slam, "Balls!"
"Your wings." Dean explained, gesturing to the limb that was splayed out across the two of them.
"But you're an angel again. You don't need to sleep, so why—"
"Of course you're invited you idiot!" Dean exclaimed, earning him a reproachful look from the man behind the counter.
Sam opened his mouth and closed it again without speaking and shook his head.
"I suppose I have just been waiting for the right person." he said with a small smile.
"And would you like to share your secret of staying pure?"
Cas wrapped his arms around Dean in a comforting hug.
"He was already a bit screwy, but then he found religion. She was a hard-line atheist, no peach herself. When he got himself obsessed with this buddy Boyle wackjob, an already bad marriage got worse. Kept telling her to 'let God in'."
They definitely needed Bobby for this.
There was silence over the phone.
"It's okay, Dean." he said, his voice calm and soothing. "You were just having a nightmare, that's all."
"Moose." He answered. "To what do I owe the pleasure?"
"Which one was using the Reverend Buddy Boyle?" Dean asked.
Dean sighed again, deflating under the combined weight of his thoughts and Sam's powers of persuasion and moved to lean against this week's car, pulling the silver flask from his pocket and taking a long pull. If he was going to have this conversation, he was going to need some help from an old friend.
Dean frowned.
"Dean?" Sam rushed forwards to grasp his brother's arm as he swayed on the spot.
"You sick?" Dean asked, worried that Sam's miraculous recovery had somehow taken a turn for the worst.
"The world didn't end did it?"
"I missed you." he whispered, breathing in the scent that he had been trying to capture earlier.
He moved to the closet, opening the doors and staring in at the row of clothes that Cas had accrued and left in his hasty exit from the bunker. He pulled out a shirt and brought it to his face, inhaling the musky scent that still lingered. He closed his eyes against the onslaught of memory and emotion that threatened to overwhelm him – memories of time spent lounging around and invading each other's personal space. He closed his eyes and basked in the memories that assaulted him.
A cold shock of fear coursed through him. Was he sick? Was he injured? Possibilities surged through his mind, each one more irrational and improbable than the last but it didn't stop Dean from worrying. He'd just gotten his angel back and he was damned if he was going to lose him again.
"He completed them, he died, he came back."
"You took my grace." Castiel spoke up from his prone position.
"Have you ever…?"
"Awesome." Dean said.
"You shut up." Dean ordered curtly, before rounding on the angel in his arms who was fading fast, "And you, don't you dare die on me."
"Don't!" She shouted, fumbling for the key.
Dean's eyes opened, the normally vivid green dulled as he blinked sluggishly in the dim light, and Cas let himself relax. This wasn't the first time Dean had been subject to a panic attack in the last week, and Cas cursed himself for losing control.
The two brothers both knew that by 'no one' Dean meant 'Dad'.
For two months he had been free of the responsibility of looking after his little brother, a job he had been given as a child – hadn't asked for, hadn't wanted even – and he had loved it. The freedom to just be himself without constantly worrying about where Sam was and if he was safe. Just focusing on himself and what he wanted. And then he had felt instantly guilty about loving it because he
"Wa' th' f'k j'ss 'appn'd."
"Dean, wake up."
"Just so you know, I'm not in the habit of bringing drunk strangers into my home it's just… well…I couldn't leave you on the street."
"Don't worry, Cas. Everything will seem better in the morning."
"So, one of your brothers is named Gabriel and is, despite his height, surprisingly terrifying."
Dorothy sighed and her face told Cas she could likely get in real trouble for this but before he could protest, her expression hardened into a look of determination and she nodded, a small, mischievous smile curling the corners of her mouth.
"It's good. I quite like Ellen and Jo and Ash. And Dean of course. I started out washing dishes but lately I've been helping more in the kitchen, prepping and whatnot. I've always been fond of cooking. I've also started balancing the books since I have some knowledge of accounting."
"Yeah, yeah he did."
Unfortunately, there was still Constantine to find and she wasn't talking so they hauled ass back to the bunker where the locals weren't too pleased with Dean's idea of using torture to find the wayward Constantine and any other possible walking bombs. He'd been forced to surrender his angel blade at the door on the basis that his own initiative might have a negative effect on the locals. Apparently angels weren't trusted with free will. In fact, Hannah had insisted on sitting in on the interrogation, until she went off on the reaper for implying Cas didn't feel he could trust her and thought her weak and really, this whole Castiel worshiping business was really starting to bug the crap out of Dean.
Once again, the cruel hand of fate had forced them apart but Castiel held firm to the faith he had in them. There would come a day soon when Castiel would come back with no intention of ever leaving. Of that he was certain.
Cas looked up and nodded sombrely.
"It's all right. It's stupid anyhow."
He closed his eyes that were still worn out and stinging from the all the bawling he had been doing earlier, unease settling in his stomach, and he dropped off quickly, wrung out from the stress of the day and the worries of the future.
"He does seem angry. I mean, he's always a little angry, but now it seems like...more. I think a part of him actually believed that I ordered those angels to, you know...Sam, you don't, do you?"
On the other hand, here was an opportunity to gain some knowledge and insight into Metatron's operation while simultaneously ridding Metatron of his right hand.
Sam had been the one to bring up the holiday a few weeks ago at dinner when Dean had
"Okay." Jody said, "Where are we gonna get a virgin?"
Sam's stomach churned. He never liked being reminded about his brother's time in hell, knowing that Dean had gone there for him and still remembered every second of it.
"Important yes, awesome, not so much." Kevin replied.
"All righty." She said, sitting back down and handing out three clipboards, "Just sign there and your purification can begin."
"Hey Cas, Dean's not here."
Afterwards Dean and Castiel sat out in the warm late September evening on the hood of the Impala, sharing an order of fries and winding down from the hectic atmosphere of the busy bar.
Castiel smiled, looking up at Dean with open admiration in his eyes while Dean's face warmed and reddened from the scrutiny. He cleared his throat.
"No. Don' d'serve 'im. Pois'n."
At last the bunker door came in sight and he slowed, coming to a halt in front of it. He thought back to those first days spent as a human as he stood now in front of the subterranean opening. How lost he had felt, how alone. And how wonderful Dean had been, how supportive in the early days of his humanity. Again that gnaw of guilt took hold, and he cursed himself for leaving. He reached out his hand and extended his grace into the mechanism of the lock, turning it and allowing the door to swing open. He moved to step inside…
"Yeah, Sam, I understand. Okay. Look, I'm doing this as fast as I can but…I know…yeah, I understand…All right, call me if you find anything."
Cas observed that Dean did not sound like his usual confident self. Instead he sounded nervous as he stood there chewing on his bottom lip while waiting for Castiel's answer.
"Kevin." Mrs. Tran said softly.
His tone and expression were cold and uncaring, but still Sam could see the pain that dwelt just beneath the surface, ready to surge up and drown the man at any moment.
Dean cracked an eye open.
"Of course I can Sammy," Dean retorted, "I've been doing it my whole damn life!"
"It's okay." Bobby said emphatically. Slowly the breathing evened out and the fear in his eyes faded, replaced by embarrassment and shame.
"Sam, I need to find him, I need—"
“Come on, the faster we get to the turkey the faster we get to the pumpkin pie Ellen made.”
Dean gaped at him.
An uncomfortable silence fell over the two brothers as they settled against the hood.
Dean looked in awe at the sight, a smile of his own blossoming.
"How did I get so lucky? What did I do to deserve you?"
"Step aside." he said, his demeanour calm.
"What, I'm curious."
Cas frowned again.
"Who leads the factions?"
Sam and Dean swooped in for hugs.
"Why didn't you try sooner?"
No one moved. Sam was on the other side of the room, hand ready to grab the blade he had hidden in his jacket at a moment's notice. Dean was glaring at the angel who had had a not so small part in making his and every one whose lives he cared about hell for the better part of the past nine months. Castiel stood still behind Dean and weighed up his options. On the one hand he had just lost his army to Metatron and he could feel his body weakening by the day as his grace faded gradually away.
He turned to Dean.
"Yes?" Cas asked.
He cleared his throat, breaking the eye contact and glancing away.
Hannah stared back impassively.
Dean struggled under the weight of the genuine love he could see and feel radiating from the angel. He frowned and shook his head.
"I do what I must, I—"
Dean sighed.
Dean grinned and went in for another kiss.
Dean glanced down at the food once more.
"C-Cas…" he coughed, crimson blood staining his lips and he sucked in ragged, laboured breaths.
"No. Don't do that. Really, I behaved very badly and I don't deserve your sympathy." He looked thoughtful, crossing his arms and holding the mic sideways, "I know that I screwed up and there's really no excuse. It's not that surprising, I screw things up all the time, but this...this was something special and I'll always treasure that. But I hurt him and he didn't deserve that. He deserved nothing but the best because he's honestly, the nicest, kindest, awesomest person and I don't think I really realized how much I loved him until he was gone and I have only myself to blame for that. I just hope that he's happy. But to answer your question, I don't think we'll be seeing each other again."
"Yes."
Dean hesitated.
He knew he was dreaming because in the dream he was an angel, and he was in heaven. He closed his eyes, breathing in the scent that was so unlike anything he had come across on earth.
Dean turned to Sam and held out the second set.
Dean smiled and chuckled.
"Look man, I get that you're all graced up again and what not, but in my book, if you gotta sleep, you gotta eat too."
The girl eyed their clasped hands and her eyes widened.
"Sammy..." Dean began but trailed off. He didn't really have anything to say.
Dean shrugged.
Dean sighed and nodded.
“I don’t know. And you know something else? It doesn’t matter okay? What matters is that I’m happy. What matters is that I haven’t felt the need to go get drunk or sleep around or break something since he came into my life.”
"I don't know, Dean." Cas said from his position on the bed.
"At myself."
"Dean, what is it?" he asked, his voice softer than even he thought he was capable of.
Dean nearly choked on the burger he'd just bitten into when Sam came out with his non sequitur. He coughed and hacked for a few moments before he managed to take a breath and swallow properly.
"Cas, what did you do?"
Dean bit his lip and shook his head.
"'Fraid so." Sam said. "I'm sorry Cas."
In the far back of his mind, in the empty place where Cas used to be, Dean felt...something. A prodding. His first instinct was to fight back against it, he had been resolutely ignoring it ever since Cas had closed it off, but as the angel struggled for breath in his arms, his wings lying limp beneath him, Dean let go of the anger and resentment and opened himself up to it. Instantly, he was flooded with the overwhelmingly familiar presence of the angel in his mind, accompanied by all the love Cas could muster. Which was quite a lot.
"Hey, hey were closing. You gotta go man."
I know, I'm a terrible person who is addicted to cliffhanger deaths. Please leave a comment.
"Oh…that's not something you hear about all that often."
"What is that you're humming?" Castiel asked from where he was polishing the freshly washed glasses and returning them to their designated spots at the bar.
“Wait Cas what are you doing?” It felt too finite. Too much like a goodbye. Dean’s stomach twisted. He couldn’t lose the angel. Not when he’d just gotten him back.
"Agent." he greeted.
"Sorry. But I don't want you ever thinking you're a burden to us. Ever. You hear me? 'Cause you've saved me in so many ways. And not as an angel."
"I think we need the real McCoy here, Sam." Jody commented.
"Dean, without my powers, I'm no use to you." he said softly, his eyes fixed on the table as he traced the patterns in the linoleum.
It occurred to Sam that it didn't normally take Dean this long to wake up. He had always been a light sleeper and had a remarkable ability to snap from sleep to waking in a matter of seconds. Sam had always assumed it was Dean's natural state but he was beginning to suspect it was yet another fallout from their father's puritanical child-raising methods.
All thoughts rushed out of Castiel's head as he moaned Dean's name.
"Sh't, S'mmy." Dean murmured and Sam opened his eyes to see Dean looking dejected and despondent and wrecked as he slumped in his chair. "'M sorry. 'M so sorry."
Once they had eaten breakfast and Cas was looking marginally better despite the dark circles and bags that still sat under his tired, dull eyes, Sam left to grab his laptop and Dean and Cas sat down to discuss how best to proceed.
"Don't be." He replied.
"Then I'm not going to stop you."
He looked up at Dean, red-rimmed eyes offsetting the blue.
Cas smiled and said softly, "That's good enough for me."
"Wha' d'you jus' call me?" Cas asked, his brow furrowed.
Dean cut off his panicked ramble, standing and grabbing him by the shoulders.
Dean's anger surged.
Robin smiled.
"Shut up."
"Dean!" Cas yelled, his physical pain diminished by the sight of his partner lying, unmoving, in the corner.
"I– I don't think I can."
"Don't want to talk about it." Dean answered curtly, continuing on though Sam had stopped.
"'Cause it's totally cool if you are."
Dean chuckled, and stroked him lovingly on the cheek.
"Why are you saying this?" he asked, baffled by the uncharacteristic behaviour.
Sam shook his head and ground his teeth. He'd never seen John Winchester as the great hero that Dean always had. He'd seen him as an obsessive bastard who would rather spend his time seeking revenge for his wife's death than provide a good and stable home for his sons. Still, the man had sacrificed himself to save Dean's life and Sam had spent the last six years trying to honour his father's memory.
"I was a fool. I should have—"
"Tried t'…tried t' comm–comm…" he frowned, as he struggled with the word, "k'll m'self." He shook his head. "Nah good."
"No, Cas." He was begging now, pleading. And the angel's eyes were sad as the last vestiges of his presence in Dean's mind were severed and the hunter was left with a cold emptiness. "Cas!"
"What the hell is going on?!" Kevin yelled.
"Nothing. Just, sometimes I forget how old you are."
"Dean, I told you I would never leave." Cas assured him.
Cas, definitely Cas. So why didn’t he know what a demon was when he saw one? Dean opened his mouth but no words came out. What was he supposed to say?
Dean sent him a glare that clearly said 'No' but then he let out a sigh and shifted awkwardly in his chair.
Sam and Jody averted their eyes from the intimate moment and Jody sent a concerned and questioning look Sam's way. He sighed and shook his head. It was for Dean to tell if he wanted to.
"Gabriel." He finally greeted.
"I'm sorry." Dean said, his voice already alerting Cas that he didn't think this was a particularly good plan. "You want to bring an angel to us? Are you fucking crazy?"
They continued kissing, hands roaming, touching, feeling. Castiel allowed his hand to slip beneath the waistband of the sweats Dean wore, fingers brushing over coarse hair and warm flesh. Dean's breathing sped up and Cas began stroking, fascinated by the feel and by his own body's response.
Dean cut him off with a kiss, and poured all the gratitude that that one gesture had evoked through the bond, eliciting a small sound of surprise from the startled angel. Dean broke away and ran a fond hand over Castiel's cheek.
Sam moved to sit on Dean's bed.
Dean smiled.
"It is something Sam explained to me. He said that there are widely accepted rules of society and then there are 'Rules-'"
Sam sighed.
Cas frowned and shook his head.
Dean laughed and then took pity on the guy.
Dean turned his eyes back to the road.
"I take it he didn't react well."
Dean frowned.
"But…but Alastair said…Dad was Michael's vessel."
“What do you think happened to him?”
Dean took his eyes off the road momentarily to glance over at his boyfriend.
Dean pulled back to make sure that Cas was alright, he’d hate to have cause a breakdown in such a public and joyous forum. Sure enough there were tears falling from his sparkling eyes but there was also a brilliant smile on his face.
"No." he answered eventually.
"Did I what?"
"Cas! Cas you've gotta help him!"
Dean held his gaze until Cas smiled and nodded, the uncertainty and self-loathing that had been staining the connection, clearing to love and contentment once more.
Cas sighed and shifted in his seat.
"Fine. I'll watch your stupid movie."
“I know.”
"Yeah. Through you I think."
"What kind of brain damage?"
"Yes." He breathed, leaning forward and pressing a kiss to Dean's lips before pulling back and looking down at the ball of fur sitting contentedly in the palm of Castiel's hand.
As usual thanks to the awesome Rainbow Fruit Loop for betaing
"Ohhhhh." he said softly, turning away when the moment started to get awkward. Cas turned to Dean.
"Suiting up. We are going in as Federal Officers are we not? I still have the badge you gave me." he said, fishing it out of his inner breast pocket.
Enjoy!
"Charlie, could you maybe refrain from too much colourful language." He reprimanded.
Metatron stalked forward.
“Do you want to go in?”
Eventually, after a few minutes, Sam, fishing for a new conversation topic asked, "So, how's the angel situation, Cas?"
"You never know, might be worth a look-see." He clapped Castiel on the back, "You comin'?"
"You want me to stay here?"
"Hit squad?" Dean suggested. "You mentioned warring factions." he said to Cas.
Dean didn't need to answer; the look in his eyes was all the confirmation Sam needed.
"Yeah." She answered, stealing a glance at Castiel.
about him?" he asked with emphasis.
"It is very nice to finally be able to sleep in a bed. At the shelter all we had were cots, which, I was reliably informed, are not proper beds. After that I slept in an abandoned bus, well until an angel tried to kill me. Then I slept in cars and in alleyways and on benches…I never realized how difficult it was being human. I find sleep particularly troubling…" he trailed off. Dean smiled, half-asleep as he listened to the angel ramble on, "Dean, may I ask you a question?"
It was dark and packed to the brim, the air was hot and stuffy and a makeshift stage was set up at the far end of the room and on it, lit by a bank of overhead lights, stood Dean, talking into a microphone and garnering a roar of laughter from the crowd every few seconds.
He really, really, wanted to see Dean again.
Crowley shrugged.
It was Christmas Eve and Dean and Cas were on their way to Bobby’s to join Sam, Sarah, Jo, and Ellen.
“I seem to be able to help to a certain degree. What’s your issue?”
"Do you like it?" he asked.
"Are you trying to ask how our sex life is going?"
"So, how's it going between you two?" he asked.
He sighed wistfully.
"Yes."
While Dean was in the kitchen, Castiel sat and thought about what he had said. It was true that Castiel did feel something for his roommate. He had never had feelings for another man before but then again, he had only ever been with one other person and she…
Dean returned to the living room with the refilled bowl of popcorn, setting it down on the coffee table before slumping back into his seat at the other end of the sofa.
"You uhh, you passed out." Dean explained, "and I couldn't find any ID or keys so…" he gestured with his hands figuring the rest could go without saying.
"Well done." she commended. "We've sent word to Metatron. He'll be back shortly. You can wait inside."
Castiel leaned back, closing his eyes.
Cas took a moment to consider, to 'sell it', as Dean would say. Finally he nodded.
"So Metatron's got the angel tablet." Dean said.
Things had been going well between them. His physical injuries were healing well and the dark purple bruises that had marred his ribcage had now faded to a sickly yellow. Dean had begun to give the fallen angel weapons training and self-defence lessons so that the now-human Cas could defend himself and Dean could sleep easy.
"Where're you going?" Sam called after him.
Cas reached out a hand, cupping Dean's chin and raising it.
Eventually, Dean got himself under control enough to raise his head and wipe away the tears that reddened his eyes and dulled the colour. He sniffed and ducked his head and the panic that had flooded the connection gave way to hot shame.
"I'll say 'Poughkeepsie', okay?"
"Yeah, he uh, he wasn't too pleased about my 'choice'."
Sam's statement wasn't quite true but Dean wasn't about to bring up the Christmas he'd spent with Lisa and Ben, aka the Christmas where he'd let them do their own thing, gone out, gotten wasted, and kicked down every angel in every nativity scene he'd come across on his long, unsteady way home. But now Sam was staring him with those eyes and he could feel his will crumbling.
"Then there was this girl…Robin. She was nice, pretty, interesting. She kissed me and at first I was so scared and confused. But it was nice and I enjoyed it and I figured hey, if I like guys and girls then maybe I could just focus on the girls and everything would be fine you know? Girls are…safe. And I could prove to dad that I wasn't…that it was just a phase and everything would be fine."
"It's all right, Kevin." She said, placing a comforting hand on his shoulder, "But I think Sam is right."
"Yeah Cas, I think you just might."
It was a direct hit, exploding into powder upon impact with the back of Dean's head, and some even managed to slip down the back of Dean's jacket as he turned and stared at his little brother, before ducking and gathering a snowball of his own.
An aggravated sigh sounded down the line.
"Neither am I." Cas answered back, kneeling and resting his forearms on the motel comforter. He clasped his hands and closed his eyes, and silence reigned for a moment before he spoke again. "I'm…not familiar with this end of the process."
"Of course they were." Dean said, stepping into the kitchen, "My instincts are sharp. Like a cheetah."
Sam rolled his eyes in annoyance.
The bunker was a blur of dim lighting and concrete as he made his way through the labyrinthine hallways until, almost without his knowledge, he was in the garage and then he was in his baby, the one constant in his tumultuous and nomadic existence and he was cramming a well-worn tape into the deck and screaming out into the unknown, music blaring loud enough to drown out the silence in his thoughts. Vaguely, at the back of his mind, he thought he felt Cas trying to force his way back in but Dean shut it down. It was probably only wishful thinking anyway and as terrifying as this new silence was, a part of him was glad to have his thoughts to himself, especially when the tears came, trickling at first and then streaming until the road blurred and he was forced to pull over.
"My name is James Castiel Novak, Jimmy for short, and I'm from Pontiac, Illinois.
"Please Gabriel."
Sam shrugged; clearly uncomfortable by the line of questioning he'd just started.
"But you did."
Sam shook his head, "Not really. I mean, not to the point where I tried. But…I guess, last year, doing the trials, it felt like I was trying to make up for everything. And at the end, when you begged me to stop…all I could think was that if I had to die so that I could fix what I'd done; not being able to stop the gates of hell from opening, setting Lucifer free, watching helpless as he beat you senseless using my body…I figured if the price to pay for all that was my life…I would gladly give it. And maybe something good could come out of it."
"I'm sorry, Cas." Sam said in the silence.
Dean fidgeted.
Sam came bounding into the room.
"How?"
"Will you let me in?" Cas pleaded, the impatience returning.
"You want a diseased tree for Christmas?" he asked.
"Of course I'll be safe." He leaned down and laid a soft kiss on his lips before turning to the others.
Heat shot through Dean at the sound, and he grinned.
"He was always one for anarchy."
Sam and Jody exchanged looks as Cas' expression darkened.
"I missed you too." came the soft, gravely reply.
"There has been no word from Metatron. Malachi likewise has gone quiet."
It’s been about fifteen minutes when Dean strides into the room, leaning in the doorway proudly.
Dean leans against him on the couch, overtaken by laugher.
Cas is squinting at the television, head tilted, an amusing cross between confused and studious.
He glances back at Cas. Cas, who doesn’t eat. Cas, who’s eating anyway because Dean wanted to share what he’d made. Almost as if to say, “yes, I can enjoy things you don’t expect.”
Cas is sitting on the couch, hooked on the screen, watching two men having very,
Pranks.
That is… not what Dean expected.
With that in mind, Sam makes his way downstairs, looking for Dean and Cas. It’s nice out, so maybe they’ll want to take a walk. When he locates them, they’re sitting on the couch, shoulder to shoulder, watching some show about two guys that quickly reveals itself to be hardcore porn.
Sam has spent most of his time at the beach reading under a sun umbrella.
Dean looks at the bowl. It’s still full.
Cas studies them before finally acquiescing, tilting his head down to carefully retrieve them. Dean lets out a sharp breath. It feels as if Cas is peppering his hand in kisses. He immediately questions why he brought this upon himself. And moreover, why he doesn’t hate it.
“I don’t,” Cas agrees. “But it’s good.”
kind of mixed feelings here.
One of the men on the screen lets his
“They said it like that was a
It’s a few moments before Cas opens his eyes. “What is?”
The worry on Sam’s face intensifies.
At that, Cas turns to Dean, shifting in his seat, regarding him attentively for the first time since he sat down. He seems to be studying Dean’s face, making sure this is legitimate permission to talk about it. As if he’s concerned. As if breaking both of Dean’s porn rules at once—not watching it in a room full of dudes and not talking about it—might cause lightning to shoot down at them from the ceiling.
The kiss is sweet and strong, and with Dean’s hand twisting into Cas’s hair, Cas lets out a “hmm” that might just be surprise—as if by some crossing of wires, he didn’t expect this.
“We should probably turn that off,” Cas says, “it’ll play the whole show.” As if Dean isn’t the one who informed him of this in the first place.
“Possibly,” Cas agrees, breaking his eyes from the screen long enough to offer Dean the remote. “Maybe you can decipher this abomination.”
“I think it was a kinky thing.”
jaw drop, kneeling onto the floor for… for… for reasons.
Dean’s jaw drops, his mind drawing a useless ‘error 404.’
It’ll go through the whole show.”
Dean asks. “On the owner’s TV? Man, Sam is gonna kill you.”
He stares at Cas. At his sincere expression, at his ruffled hair, at his endless blue eyes. And before his brain can catch up, Dean is moving, setting a hand on Cas’s arm, sliding the other across his cheek, closing the gap between them, grasping the mixed feelings he swore he’d ignore and shoving them into the light.
Sam turns on his heel, not wanting to catch another moment of whatever Dean and Cas have going on. Book. It’s time for another book.
Dean’s phone lights up on the table. It’s a message from Sam.
Castiel watches the brothers bicker for a while, a faint smile crossing his lips. He’s rarely seen the Winchesters this carefree. Well, if the horror on Sam’s face can be called ‘carefree.’ At any rate, it’s amusing. For a while. Eventually, though, Cas tires of it, slips quietly off his stool and wanders into the living room.
“What’s up?” Dean asks, stepping farther into the room only to stop short at the sight before him.
Cas has walked on the beach, but has staunchly refused to take off his shoes, arguing that enough sand tracks its way into their cottage without him getting covered in it purposefully. Still, Dean is set on wearing him down.
“Uh…”
Clearing his throat, Dean does his best to answer without imploding.
It does absolutely nothing.
The next episode starts to autoplay, and a poorly-designed credit introduces the show as “Boys in the Shower.” Needing some kind of escape, Dean finds himself saying, “Do you want popcorn? I’m gonna make us some popcorn.” And without waiting for a reply, he’s out of his seat and marching into the kitchen.
and that’s just about when Dean’s heart stops.
“How uh… how long were we watching that?” He asks.
“Where is the regularly scheduled programming?” He mutters, a bewildered accusation to the remote in his hands.
And with that, there’s not much else to talk about. A loud moan brings Dean’s attention back to the screen, and suddenly this is awkward again. For a moment he thinks to leave, but just as soon he forgets to. This show is kinda riveting.
“Oh.”
When Dean doesn’t move, Cas just rolls his eyes, grabbing some popcorn from the bowl and depositing it in Dean’s hand. He takes another mouthful.
With his mouth.
And eye’s closed, pressed against his lips, Cas’s world is nothing but Dean.
Kevin stared at the man on the bed, considering his words before standing and moving to the door.
Dean closed his eyes and leaned forward, resting his forehead against Castiel's and revelled in the quiet moment, just happy that they were both still alive.
"I do. And I'll come back. I promise." The angel reached for Dean but he ducked out of his reach.
And thanks as always to Rainbow Fruit Loop for betaing :)
He patted Cas' good shoulder as he passed him out of the kitchen and if he let his hand linger on the fallen angel then so what?
"Yeah, I know," Sam interrupted, seeing that he had to be more specific, "But how do you
Dean stared. Was this a joke? If it wasn’t for the fact that Cas’ sense of humor was not nearly developed enough to pull a joke like that off, he might have been inclined to believe it. He stared at the man standing at the foot of the stairs staring back up at him. This
Castiel shook his head.
"First of all, Dean, you did not force me to do anything I was not already fully prepared to do on my own." He glanced away. "In fact, if you had not been there to 'pull my head out of my ass' as I'm sure you would so eloquently say, I fear I may have ended up making choices I would not be able to live with."
"Is this-"
And as the time passed Dean spoke less and less, his shoulders slumping a little more each day, dark circles, a testament to how little he had been sleeping, growing more and more prominent along with his cheekbones as his appetite took a nose dive and he started substituting every other meal with a bottle of Jack.
"Metatron has." He answered by way of explanation.
As he scrawled his signature on the line beneath the pledge, he couldn't help but feel a little piece of the knot that was the secret of his father's violation, breaking off and leaving him feeling marginally lighter and perhaps one step closer to letting it all go.
“Your smile.” He said, brushing a thumb over the corner of his upturned mouth, “It’s beautiful.”
"He used to be an angel."
"I guess not." he answered, the atmosphere tense and awkward. Little contact had been made between the former demon and the rest of the occupants of the bunker for the past few months.
"I know who that was and I know what I did to her. I need to make amends."
A tear slipped from Dean's eyes.
"Where else are you gonna go?"
"And this," Dean spoke up, "is Castiel."
want to keep his little brother safe. He just didn't want to have to do it. He wanted it to be a choice, not an obligation.
"What about you two, Sam never mentioned how you guys met."
Ephram let go and Castiel instinctively pulled the injured limb in towards his chest before he pulled it out again slowly to inspect the damage.
"I can't exactly sew up my own back, Sammy." Dean countered and Sam was hit suddenly by a jolt of realization that during his time at Stanford, Dean could easily have been killed and Sam would have been none the wiser. "Anyway," Dean continued, "they gave me a prescription for painkillers, good ones too, and when I got back to the motel I saw the bottle of whiskey I had and I thought…I could do it. Just swallow it all down and…fade away." He let out a humourless laugh. "I mean, who would miss me right?"
"Dean, there is nothing to be embarrassed about." Cas said, moving forward but still keeping a safe distance so as not to overwhelm him.
Despite his attempts at a casual, uncaring tone, Dean's voice cracked and a painful lump threatened to close up his throat.
"Yes! Yes they are!" Dean yelled, interrupting the other man.
"Oh."
Dean made his own greetings and ushered everyone into the living room. Sam and Sarah shared a glance before looking over to the stairs up which Cas had disappeared.
Kevin looked at her blankly.
"Hey!" Dean greeted, standing and moving over to give the red headed nerd a hug.
Sam sighed and ran his fingers through his hair. Logically he knew that Crowley was their best bet on finding out how to beat Vesta and, given the events of the past two weeks, he knew the former demon was unlikely to lie to them, but still.
"I love you too." He whispered, "Now let's go home."
"I was very different then." Cas agreed, wrapping his arms around the warm body that lay half on top of him, "I don't think you fully comprehend the profound affect you have had on my existence."
Dean sighed and rubbed his eyes.
"What? What happened? Are you hurt?"
"You're right. I'm sorry." he shrugged. "I suppose I've done much riskier and stupider things for you and Sam, so I guess I can't really talk."
“It’s not a deal.” Dean reassured, trying to sound more confident than he felt, “It’s-”
"A spell?"
Dean's face screwed up in anger.
Sam looked over at him, his face the perfect picture of innocence.
They ate in silence, Sam digging into the food and Dean picking at it as he drained three cups of the black liquid until he was sitting up straighter and looking marginally better. Sam cleared his throat and wiped his mouth, setting the napkin down and fixing Dean with a meaningful look.
Dean turned his gaze back to the angel sitting across from him.
"Here," Dean said, retrieving the first aid kit, "tuck into that while I patch up your shoulder."
"Y'all can all go to hell." Dean smiled as he made to leave.
“What was that?”
He'd brought a guy who had passed out drunk in his bar back to his apartment and given him his spare bed. Dean had friends he wouldn't do that much for and yet here he was staring down at the snoring stranger with the too-blue eyes and dark messy hair and the unexpectedly gruff voice that was probably a result of the whiskey he'd been throwing back all night.
doing this?" He sighed at the defiant look in her eyes. "Look. I know what it's like, all right? I know because I've been there. In that deep dark place where it feels like there's only one option. But taking innocent people with you? How do you get to that?"
"Okay, so we got an angelic turf war on our hands and no idea who's behind it." He turned to Cas. "You still tuned into angel radio?" Dean asked.
Dean shrugged.
"And if I hadn't done it I would never have met this guy and I wouldn't be the happiest I've been in a long time so I choose to see it as a good decision."
He had moved into John’s house. The doctors had suggested it because he still had balance issues and lapses in awareness.
“I don’t know!”
The crowd roared with laughter and Dean laughed with them although even from the back of the room Cas could tell by the set of his jaw and the tension that prevented the smile gracing his lips from reaching his eyes that he wasn't entirely comfortable being the centre of attention.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean smirked.
A thought occurred to Castiel as he ruminated on what he knew of Dean's life. No parents, a brother away at school, he really only had Ellen and Jo and Ash to talk to and interact with on a daily basis. Dean had said himself that he didn't do well on his own and that being with Cas made him feel less isolated. Perhaps Dean needed Castiel as much as Castiel needed Dean. Perhaps this was the answer: two broken halves coming together to make some semblance of a whole. A new life, a new start. A chance to wipe the slate clean and start over; to move on from the past without forgetting what he was leaving behind.
Dean rolled his eyes.
Without explaining farther, he turned and ran back the way he had come, heading for Crowley's rooms with the four of them close on his heels.
"How did you know?" Castiel spoke up staring inquisitively at the former demon. The rest of the group turned at the question and Crowley noted Dean's grip tightening around his gun as he brought it into a low ready position.
"I don't want to have sex with you, Cas."
"How I feel. How much I love you."
"Look Dean-o," Gabriel started before Dean could continue, "I can't always fly in at the last second and Deus Ex Machina the world out of every blunder it gets itself into. That would be cheating. Besides, you're here aren't you?"
Sam's frown did not dissipate but he nodded nonetheless.
Dean looked up and then back at the ex-angel, a smile playing at the corner of his lips.
"And then the angels fell."
“I saw his face, his real face.”
"When's your birthday?"
"This man, who shared his supper with me, told me to try counting sheep. But there were no sheep."
Cas went quiet. Grief clouded the connection, and Dean's frown deepened.
Sam smiled and nodded.
Crowley raised an eyebrow.
Cas smiled and relaxed. They were almost there.
Sam looked back at Cas, who shrugged.
"Sleep, Dean." the angel whispered. "I'll watch over you."
"For crying out loud Cas, it's not like I'm going to think you're any less of an angel because I'm helping you carry this thing. I know how strong you are."
She turned back hesitantly, catching sight of Dean who stood behind Cas in the doorway. Slowly she stepped inside and Cas took a seat on the bed while Muriel stood over him. Dean leaned up against the table, still grasping the blade and not at all pleased with having an angel in their midst, even one as seemingly innocent as Muriel.
He slung the guy's arm around his shoulder and hoisted him off the barstool, grabbing him around the torso as he failed to find footing.
Dean leered.
Jody sent him a glare that clearly said for him to cut it out before she smacked him.
They found Mrs. Tran in a storage facility in Wichita along with a young girl named Candy and some kid named Jerome. After seeing to other two off safely, they headed back to the bunker where Sam, in his weakened state, had stayed to hold the fort.
Cas shook his head.
"I'm not moping!"
"Your body has expended a great deal of energy healing you." Cas interjected. "How have you been sleeping?"
"I stabbed him." Cas deadpanned.
"Whatever it is that brought you and Sam here near a week ago. Whatever it is that's got you looking like the last puppy left in the store."
Castiel came around the corner, holding a blue and silver striped tie in one hand.
"Cas, you gotta get to the dungeon. You're hurt, you'll just slow us down."
"Christmas." Sam repeated. "What do you think about celebrating it this year?"
"How did he get into that?"
"I mean for all we know, Cas is fine. Maybe it's just that the connection has gone all screwy."
Crowley gave him a hard look before nodding.
"Stop! I've told you everything! Just stop!"
"Also looks like most of the crime scenes were in industrial areas." Sam added.
The things Dean had said to him hurt deeply; cut him to the quick and Castiel was not at all sure if he could go through that again. But he also knew Dean and he knew how deeply Dean's insecurities ran, and he knew too that he should have turned back that day on the road. He should have turned back and talked to Dean instead of giving in to the spite that had filled him; the petty desire to punish Dean for what he had said and make him feel the way he had made Castiel feel.
He was fascinated by hunger, exhaustion, arousal. How he had felt last night when he had thrown caution to the wind and captured Dean's lips, finally doing what he had spent years imagining. Lying here in the semi-darkness he reveled in the sensation of Dean's hands on his bare skin. How could such minimal physical contact have such a profound effect on his body? He watched Dean hovering over him, eyebrows furrowed slightly as he concentrated fully on Castiel's injuries. A surge of gratitude and contentment, far stronger than anything he would have been capable of feeling as an angel, flowed through him at the sight and he suddenly felt very lucky to have found someone who was so dedicated to taking care of him. Dean may have not been an emotionally demonstrative man, preferring to keep his feelings hidden, but they shone through clearly in his actions; in his determination to keep those he loved safe and his dedication to his family and friends.
As Sam continued to glare at him with his patented bitch face, Dean felt the weight of the past few, well, decades settle on his shoulders and weigh him down. He felt exhausted. Not only physically, but mentally. This is why he didn't confront his demons, they were so many and not the type that were easily taken care of with a simple exorcism or an introduction to Ruby's knife. These were the types of demons Dean was really, truly afraid of. The ones he couldn't fight.
"Hell." Cas finished for her.
Sam laughed and wrapped his arms around his brother.
The archangel sighed, his shoulders slumping. If Castiel had still been able to see his wings, he was sure they too would be sagging under the weight of the task ahead. His gaze averted, studying the floor.
"Hey Castiel." Sam greeted.
"Shit."
"Tired," his voice was rough from the tears, "but good…lighter."
They broke apart and Dean brought his hand up to stroke over the week's worth of beard that had grown on the angel's face.
"It is a name, is it not?"
Dean and Castiel were lounging; waiting for Sam to return with Charlie. Cas was seated at the head of the table on Dean's left, engrossed in a book on fifteenth century alchemy. Dean looked up from the computer, watching him, taking in his eyes as they followed the line of text, the furrow between his eyebrows as he poured all his concentration into the task, his nimble fingers as they moved up to his full, plump lips, a pink tongue darting out to wet them before lowering, sliding the milky page over and then shifting as he resettled in his seat.
"Well, I have spoken with him and he has made it clear the he doesn't want to have anything to do with me and I honestly can't fault him for that."
Castiel stood in the centre of the department store taking in the massive selection of menswear and feeling hugely overwhelmed as he did so. There was so much choice, too much choice. His experience of humanity up until now had largely consisted of scrounging for the bare minimum and now here he was, rested and fed and preparing to pick out whatever clothes he wanted, and he suddenly had no idea what to do. He looked over at Dean who was watching him.
"You still had some minor burns on some of your organs but you were for the most part healed. You are fine now."
When he came back Cas was nodding off against the sink, toothbrush hanging out of his mouth.
Castiel opened his eyes in confusion.
Dean rubbed the sleep out of his eyes as he sat up; hair standing on end from the brushing it had received at Castiel's hand. Cas smiled endearingly at it and reached out, smoothing it down as Dean yawned widely.
"When Dean was fifteen, Dad caught him kissing another boy."
Dean glanced around to find Sam looking expectantly at him.
"A few possibilities spring to mind," he said, "but speculation would be useless. We need information."
Castiel pulled out a set of handcuffs.
Cas rolled into his side, Dean moving with him attached as they were at the mouth. Dean broke away and began trailing kisses across Castiel's clean-shaven cheek, finding the sweet spot beneath his ear and smiling against the skin when Cas made his pleasure known in an obscenely vocal way.
Sam himself looked particularly worried as he ushered his unusually quiet brother into the building.
Dean had explained briefly to Sam about Emmanuel and the amnesia but Dean also knew Sam would have more questions. Sam always had more questions.
"No, Cas." He said in a choked voice. "It was perfect. Amazing. It was exactly how it should have been."
"I will go." He announced, knowing that of all the bunker's current inhabitants, he was the one who understood what Crowley was going through the best.
"You okay?" he asked, his relief at having the angel back in his mind and his grasp forcing a tremble into his voice.
trust him.
"Well, well, well. The prodigal son. To what do I owe the pleasure?"
"Dad, he…when he got back he grabbed me by the scruff of my neck and dragged me into my bedroom. I thought he was gonna beat me. When he threw me down on the bed and started taking his belt off I thought he was going to hit me with it. I was prepared for that, wasn't like it was the first time, but then he took his pants off and he said….he said, 'If you want to whore around with the local fags then that's exactly what you'll get'." Dean paused, staring off at nothing, lost in the memory, "And then he raped me."
Once Dean was clean and he and Cas were seated around the table, he bit into his burger asking, "How was your day?"
The bunker was quiet and eerie when the three men walked in.
"He's kind of right Dean."
Crowley looked at him warily.
"Yeah, I got that part." he replied in kind, gesturing to the wings, "But I didn't think you
"Do you hear me boy?" Bobby asked.
Cas raised his hand, intertwining their fingers and squeezing, and Dean smiled at the unspoken show of support.
"I am unsure. I was 'out of the loop' as you say for quite a while. However, there can only be one prophet at a time which would suggest that Chuck is no longer with us."
