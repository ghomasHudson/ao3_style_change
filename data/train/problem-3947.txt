he meets castiel for the first time, and as he watches dean fall into the angel, he know he’s lost him.
“Ugh, get out of my kitchen”, Dean replies and points to the door. She smirks and signs it to him, and he repeats it back, checking for her approval. “Man, I can’t believe I haven’t got that one down yet”, he says, shaking his head. “Really, get out of my kitchen and go mingle, Eileen. I’ve got this.” She laughs.
Uriel spends another thirty seconds scrutinizing him, but Castiel resolutely keeps his mind blank. He returns to looking at the trees in the backyard, watching the wind have its way with the branches again, making them dance.
Dean’s smile grows wider, as he takes another step closer.
Castiel can only nod. He’s trying to replay every word of their conversation, and oh shit. He feels stupid. What’s worse, Castiel was probably flirting back. He‘s torn between wanting to just die on the spot, and wanting to keep living to find out what Dean’s going to do next. His right hand has come up to cradle his neck, gently, and he’s still standing very close. Castiel breathes in and there’s Dean mixed into the cool air: aftershave and motor oil. Maybe he’s imagining it. It doesn’t matter. He looks up at Dean’s face, tries to memorise all of it.
“Hi, Cas.”
benny doesn’t even know the fella, but he’s already fed up with him. fed up and
Dean bursts out laughing, and Castiel can feel his face going even redder. Why the hell did he say that?
, he thinks frantically, pulling out on the highway with no plan.
Castiel looks like a deer caught in headlights, and Dean laughs. Claire grabs his hands and he spins her around; she rolls her eyes but she Jody passes him another beer and they sway together as the song changes into the next one: definitely from this decade, and definitely awful.
“Thank you?”
“Yes. I don’t know why I said that.”
He promised her he’d try. With a sigh, he realises he probably should play nice with Dean; who knows, maybe they could be friends. Charlie would have told him he could use a friend.
Huh. Not to stereotype, but he wouldn’t have guessed Dean was the type to read.
“I guess”, Castiel replies, regarding the new guy cautiously.
“Car mechanic. ‘S alright.” Okay, so he’s straight. That’s fine.
“But you have ‘em- seriously, good job, man.”
“Dude. I heard you talking about being a ‘father of two’ all of a sudden, or whatever.”
This is just another crisis - no, not crisis. Just another… issue. Cas can do whatever the hell he wants, and if he wants to raise some goddamn kids, he’s can. Sam made a good point: the dude is good at it. Dean never wanted to examine his own parenting skills too closely out of fear of what he would find, but Cas… always put Jack first, always wanted what’s best for him, never put him in any goddamn box. Never pulled a frigging
Out in the library-turned-dining room, Jack is showing off his and Rowena’s napkin creations to Castiel while Sam rummages through the cabinets for bottles of liquor.
“Who else, genius.” He grabs Cas outreached hand, and determinedly runs over Cas slack fingers with his own. Screw this. Without looking up from their hands, he says: “Just… stay here. And be a family with me. With three kids.”
“Eileen, this is Crowley. Crowley, this is Eileen, my… yeah. My girlfriend. She’s a hunter, and she’s also a legacy of the Men of letters.” She gives the demon a bright smile and a little wave.
“Hey, Rowena.”
Rowena jumps on that immediately.
“Can I go watch Netflix now?” Jack asks, already halfway standing up.
Also, the biggest thank you to everyone who's read and left kudos and comments! <3 It seriously makes my day. I am having so much fun creating these and it makes me so happy to see other people are enjoying this little strange series as well!! Much love!!
They share a smile, and Castiel tries to push down the weird sadness that’s suddenly welling up.
“Okay, so now we’ve established that”, Dean says, and leans back again, taking another swig of beer. Castiel blinks. “Dude, I gotta ask. What kind of a name is Castiel?”

“Yes.”
Dean Winchester on Earth is different.
it’s been 9 days since he first met castiel. true to form, once again he thirsts and hungers. ain’t like he’s ready to get tangled up in whatever crazy story the human and the angel’s got going on, anyway. dean’s humanity is a beacon for every monster in purgatory, but watching the guy lean forward, crosslegged with a grin, trying to get the angel to meet his eyes and laugh at his jokes, benny gets the feeling the same thing was true topside.
it’s been 23 days since he first met castiel. in the nest, the way they worked, they were a crew, all working toward the same goal. here, on board dean’s ark, well... while the ship is heading for the shore, one of the passengers sits on the railing, ready for the ocean below to swallow him up.
“Hey, what are you doing?” he complains, trying to reach for her phone.
Castiel gives Dean what he hopes is an unimpressed look, and crosses his arms over his chest defensively. Castiel knows he’s a cliché; he knows this. But it’s annoying how easily Dean seemed to notice it, too.
it’s day 1 in purgatory. castiel makes a split-second decision but he knows it’s the right one. he has to draw the leviathans away from dean at all costs.
“Now you have my number too”, he says, feeling a bit sheepish. He’s suddenly worried about coming off as flirting with the guy. But Dean probably doesn’t even know he’s gay. From experience, he knows straight men tend to assume he’s one of them. It’s not like he’s hiding it, but he’s never been comfortable flaunting his sexuality either. He just never knew why it was anyone’s business but his own.
“Yes”, Eileen agrees, “
“Oh. Okay.”
“I’m not. That. Drunk”, Castiel enunciates, but it’s hard not to smile back when Dean leans in toward him, eyes glinting with humour. “Your eyes are very green”. Oh, shit.
Dean already very carefully carried out his vinyl player and managed to hook it up to the Bunker speaker system, but Claire is confidently plugging cables in and out until she’s got her phone hooked up instead and starts playing something way more modern and way more angry than what Dean had in mind.
Enochian translation: Cas is teaching me enochian!!
Thank you so so much for being so lovely about this fic!! 💓💕💞 oh god, Dean. Oh god, Cas. oh GOd Jack
When he first reached out, he forgot that he was not meant to touch: he fitted his hand over Dean Winchester’s shoulder, feeling him tremble. Feeling like a moth who had finally gotten what he wanted: to be one with the Light. The light washed over him and angels don’t breathe, they have never needed to— and there is no oxygen in Hell, Castiel’s true angelic form does not possess lungs — still, he drew a breath.

“Yeah? You in the same field?”
“Sure.”
Dean shrugs. He figured this part was never really the demon’s scene, anyway.
Crowley’s smile turns thoughtful.
And, oh Jesus. He doesn’t want to have this conversation. He wants, more than anything, to have this conversation. His heart feels like it’s beating out of his chest. He thinks of the little girl in the backseat of the car- no, wait. The only blond girl there is Claire. But he can imagine a third: a toddler, gender doesn’t matter.
Dean’s eyes freeze on the page he’s been reading (and definitely not staring blindly at while eavesdropping at Cas and Sam’s quiet exchange on the other side of the room).
“Hello, boys. Missed me?”
“I’m proud of you”, Castiel says quietly. Dean swallows, still uncertain of how he should be navigating this whole thing, and instead leans in for another kiss.
“Did you think I was planning on… acquiring another child?” Castiel asks, finally.
It’s just a dinner party, Dean thinks. It’s no big deal. It’s just witches, demons, angels, nephilims, hunters, exes and step-parents, all under one roof. It’ll be fun, he tells himself. It’s gonna be just fine. Still it comes as a shock, hearing the voice of someone he until very recently thought was dead, and it stops him in his tracks.
But I still want him.
“Thanks, but I better be going”, she says. “Please give your family my love.”
He gets up to start gathering everyone’s plates, and Castiel follows his lead without a word. It takes a couple of trips between the library and the kitchen until the table is cleared, but they work effectively and synchronized and once they’ve piled the last of the now empty pots on the dangerously overcrowded kitchen counter, Castiel catches him by the sleeve.

Thank you once again to everyone who's read and commented and bookmarked and left kudos!!! It means so much and makes me so happy 💓💗💖💕
“Do girls get it?”
(Cas page 1) I really wanted to kiss him then.
“Yeah, duh, but it’s weird. Cas-tee-el.”
it’s day 112 in purgatory. so, monsters talk. especially if you apply a bit of pressure. funny how they can know about the so-called abomination that moves through the depths of purgatory, but when really confronted about it, they refuse to speak. dean groans. heads roll.
, Dean thinks, and he knows this isn’t how shit works, but he’s suddenly positive he wants to try. His eyes fall to the Audi in front of him, engine screaming like it’s about to fall apart: he flips the turn signal and passes.
it’s been 19 days since he first met castiel. it’s him dean clings to through the night, but the damn holy fucker doesn’t sleep, either. it’s during the nineteenth night the seraph breaks the silence. “i assume you already know i’ll be staying here.” benny doesn’t care, but his eyes go to dean’s fingers, now curled into another coat. “yeah,
They sit in silence, Dean picking at the oil stains that never quite leave the skin around his nails.
“Where should I put these?” she asks, a little embarrassed at being caught.
Sam shakes his head.
“None taken, sweetie.”
it’s been 90 days since he first met dean, and his thirst is getting sated now. it’s been a long and lonely eternity in this hell-hole and dean seems to be the antidote to all of it. forgive him for going a little crazy with it, will you? besides, the curve of his lips tasted as good as it looked. beneath all those layers, the skin was soft and warm.
Dean has to give him a tired look for that.
“Both.”
Castiel lets himself be pulled up and as the chorus is about to hit, Dean puts his arms loosely around Castiel’s neck, his heart beating nervously in his chest. God, he never went to prom, but this must be what it would feel like. Dancing with your crush in front of everyone. But Castiel is steady against him, hands on his hips, and there isn't even room in his mind to worry about what the others will say when he’s got Cas this close, so close he can make out every little crinkle. He wants to kiss them all. The song fades into a new one, but that’s not a good enough reason to let go, so instead he holds on.
“Wait, come again?” So Cas’s new kid is his already existing kid. Adult kid, more like. Why this has him feeling disappointed, he couldn’t tell you. “I mean, uh, congratulations. Buddy. That’s gotta mean a lot.” That is a big responsibility. “That’s gotta be an honor.”
Castiel thinks to himself, unable to help it.
“You’re still pretty drunk”, Dean says fondly. “I don’t want to take advantage of you. But I wasn’t joking when I said I want to be your friend.”
“Oh, it’s been years and years since I had the energy for that.”
“Okay”, he allows. Dean was spot on in his assumptions, of course. Castiel is, in fact, a massive book geek.
Dean closes his eyes briefly.
Dean! What did you DO?
(See the end of the chapter for
it’s been 8 days since he first met the human who goes by dean, who proves again and again how he’s managed to survive this long in a land shaped by horror. dean’s as ruthless a tactician as he is in close combat. benny subtly trails his gaze over the hunter’s pretty eyelashes and the shape of his mouth, fascinated by the disconnect.
“Twenty minutes ago. I don’t know what the cactus or sword mean”.
“Right”, Dean says thoughtfully. “How about… we both like to read?”
Dean drops his hands to the table, deliberately not looking at Cas.
That would explain it. The guy is dressed in a blue-green flannel, black t-shirt, and jeans. He’s clean shaven and short haired and Castiel searches his brain for any Deans Charlie might have mentioned in the past, but comes up short. Strange, because this man is… Castiel can’t quite put his finger on it, but it is something, alright.
“Sometimes. But sometimes guys get it, too.”
“I already did. And I gave you my number, didn’t I?” he teases gently. His eyes sparkle like stars reside there. “Text me. Call me. Or I’ll call you.”
over there! Still haven't figured out how or if I should post this here as well.
“We’ll make sure to save some for them”, Dean says, forcing himself to sound gentle. He sighs. “What are you waiting for, guys? I didn’t slave away all day in the kitchen for you to just
“I’m Castiel”, he says. “I’m sure Charlie appreciates it either way. How do you know each other?”
“Thank you, Dean”, Jack says dutifully before scurrying off. And the whole scene is so domestic it physically hurts. Dean puts his head in his hands and groans.
“Oh, I know this song”, Castiel says, and Dean groans, as some girl takes out all her frustrations on what sounds like a really shitty ex-boyfriend from every corner of the Bunker.
Rowena gives Eileen a meaningful look.
it’s day 60 in purgatory. dean’s trying not to look too closely at what he’s becoming. the dagger has been upgraded to a brutal machete that never leaves his hand; he feels naked and wrong whenever he has to put it down. when the glowing eyes find him, when the not-quite-sun sets, he calmly faces them head on.
Uriel upholds the act and Castiel may be bad at it, but he is not stupid. He knows perfectly well what this is, this little investigation in an abandoned two story house in the middle of nowhere. There are leaves and broken glass from the blown out windows all over the wooden floor. They glimmer in the pale morning light.
Dean’s eyebrows shoot up.
Kevin and Claire. Maybe he’s learned enough by now to get it right: as close to right as you’re ever gonna get. Hell, he has the experience, doesn’t he? And the thought… the thought of Castiel, co-parenting with some stranger, or worse: parenting all alone, makes him… very uneasy. Dean looks at his life and thinks
“Honestly, I’m offended”, Crowley sniffs.
From the birches the birds start singing, their chirping finding its way into complex symphonies.
“Cas, I’m not straight.” He sounds like he’s trying very hard not to laugh.
“Dean?”
“Y’know. More kids?”
it’s day 329 in purgatory. dean radiates determination, navigating the not quite dead, not quite living woods with a hand on his blade and a constant half-smile on his face. castiel trails after the two of them, keeping mostly quiet, because if he speaks up he might do something stupid like tell dean the truth. and castiel’s withheld things from dean before, but the vampire is annoyingly perceptive, and the two of them exchange entire conversations passed off as staring contests when dean isn’t paying attention.
another kid,
Dean smiles, more than a little self-satisfied.
know that.” the angel’s quiet until benny looks at him again. “i don’t want him to get hurt.” benny snorts. well, that’s pretty inevitable.
They drink some more, dance to the upbeat songs, sway from side to side to the slower ones. Sam and Eileen are slow dancing a bit away, the side of her head resting against Sam’s chest. Dean aches to hold Castiel like that, and maybe it’s the alcohol; maybe it’s the overwhelming feeling of being safe, with his family who loves him enough to put their differences aside to come and hang out all under one roof for the night. He walks over to his angel, who’s out of his trenchcoat. Only he can make a suit look like relaxed wear, and he does look relaxed: smiling and leaning back against a table.
“This was

Jack lights up and raises his hand in a little wave.
“So I can put my number in it, dumbass.” The way he says it makes it sound like a nickname. A pet name.
it’s day 360 in purgatory. it’s night three hundred and sixty. dean’s hand is clutching at the fabric of cas’s dirty, ratty coat. cas thinks:
“Wait, wait, wait. I don’t like the sound of that”, Dean says, waving a steak knife at Crowley. “Why will that be interesting?”
“I guess.” Castiel tilts his head to the side. “I don’t think we have anything in common, though.”
“The name my parents gave me.”
Dean smiles, and Castiel finds that he likes that. It’s a really nice smile, and he can feel his face wanting to smile in return. He takes another sip of wine instead.
it’s day 1 on earth. the sun is almost blindingly bright and the colors are so vivid he instinctively wants to shield his eyes from them. he lets crisp, clean air fill his lungs for the first time in over a year. his last memories are fuzzy: he remembers the unbearable loneliness, killing the leviathans that eventually showed up when the silence got so deafening he started screaming, and… but if this is earth, that means…
“Hello, Dean.”
“More”, Castiel tries to negotiate. He knows he sounds stupid, but he can’t actually bring himself to care. His world consists of Dean now; Dean’s mouth moving with every word he speaks, green eyes searching his; warm, firm hands on his neck and shoulders. A thumb stroking his jaw.
Castiel looks up, frowning a little at the stranger. He casts a glance at the girl (Rowena?) who previously occupied the seat next to him on the couch, only to see her already deep in conversation with a tall man over by the drink table.
Dean sneaks a glance at the two of them, both hunched over Sam’s laptop, and his brain immediately flips the unhelpful-as-Hell switch.
he repeats to himself, his personal mantra. with a last push and a last look at the man he loves, and a flash of bright blue light, castiel is alone again.
“I mean”.
“Shut up.”
found it, and that it just happens to be next to where cas will be sitting, knees drawn up to his chest and eyes vigilant. cas knows better than to ask what the performance is for.
“Ah”, Sam says. “Awesome. If you don’t mind me asking, where-”
s. now he’s screaming out for help. resisting is worse than hell.
“Eloquent. Can’t wait to hear your toast next”, Crowley drawls.
Dean gives him another grin, and Castiel blushes. It’s stupid, he thinks. Nothing about the guy says anything but straight. Maybe that’s for the best; he is way out of Cas’ league.
“No, and you’re already doing a great job, Cas. You know, this could be really good. It’s a huge responsibility, but you already know that. You have my support, man.”
“And yet, with Jack, it was… instinctive.” At this, Sam smiles. He can relate.
it’s been 12 days since he first met castiel. the angel broods. the human touches. the vampire envies.
“I do”, he admits. “Fixin’ up old classics and getting paid for it? It’s kind of what I always dreamed about.”
“In the flesh.”
Crowley gives her an unimpressed look. “Not your flesh”, he says, stretching out his free arm as evidence. “Not your blood.”
“I’m making a bad first impression”, he sighs. “Tell me more about your job? What kind of cars do you fix?”
“Your eyes are very blue”, Dean says quietly. Like he’s only intending for Cas to hear him. “Like, the bluest blue I’ve seen.”
“And you know, fatherhood… I had never even entertained the idea.” A small smile tugs on Castiel’s lips. “I didn’t think it was for angels”. Sam shrugs.
“To love!”

at the food. Come on, I promise you it’s edible.” And that breaks the silence, conversations start up between Sam and Rowena, Crowley and Eileen, Mary and Jack.
“Yeah, no kidding”, Sam says. “Hey, Jack? Come over here for a sec, meet Crowley.”
He puts an arm around her shoulder, pulling her in for a half-hug. “I’ve got it. Hey, if you see Cas, tell him to come help me.” The whole idea of gathering them all under one roof feels like it’s doomed to end in disaster, but damn it if Dean isn’t determined to try. He deserves this. They all deserve this. He grabs another beer from the fridge, and aims for optimism.
“You don’t know me. You don’t know anything about me.”
“Why would I do that?”
“As a matter of fact. I do.” He tugs his arm free from the other man’s light grip to go get a refill. He finds himself looking over to where the birthday girl is sitting. She’s throwing her head back in laughter, one hand flying up to catch the tiara on her head from slipping.
“I am not sure I believe you.”
“That was just, um. Claire asked me if it would be okay to call me dad sometimes. Not in a, a, ‘I’m replacing her father’ kind of way, but… she finds it easier to tell other people that, well, the man who looks like he’s related to her and cares for her like a parent actually is… her parent. She doesn’t want me to be her dad, so… it’s complicated. But she asked my permission.”
A peek at the notes section in their journals! I don't think it matters really but I imagine Dean left his journal out on the table during week 5, before they left for Denver. Sam would never make that mistake... however, older siblings can and will always find your personal journals, heh. That's how Dean got (some) revenge.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sam, darling, I’d appreciate it if you stopped threatening to murder my own flesh and blood”, Rowena sighs and sneaks an arm around one of Crowley’s, holding onto it gently.
“And why shouldn’t dear Castiel know about this, hm?”
“You’re disgusting”, Sam says (food still in his mouth, the hypocrite).
Are they? Castiel couldn’t care less about his own eye color when Dean’s is right there. “Hmmm. Yeah”, he mumbles back.
“Why?” Dean asks, eyes on him, and Castiel wishes they could stay like this for the rest of the night. Dean’s eyes on him is rapidly getting addictive.

“Will you call me?” Dean asks. “If you need a friend?”
it’s day 291 in purgatory, but dean doesn’t know this. he’s lost count. him and benny make a great team, they’re lethal, but dean’s missing cas like he’s missing a limb. the vampire’s presence just makes that so much clearer. it’s nice but it’s all wrong. they’ve got leads on cas again, and something close to hope is sprouting in his chest.
They get up, and Dean leads the way through the garden that surrounds Charlie’s charming house, until they reach the front yard. And no, he might not care much about cars, but he can tell Dean’s car apart from the others without any difficulty whatsoever.
He stares at the shapes of the spindly birch branches, the green leaves fluttering gently in the wind. Moving as if of their own accord.
Eileen can’t relate, but she offers a sympathetic smile nonetheless.
“Teaching is very rewarding.”
Rowena has never been above an Irish exit, but she feels like the least she should do is bring the wine bottles (several of which she’s consumed, it’s a shame being queen of Hell comes with an astronomically high tolerance for alcohol) to the kitchen for disposal. She had hoped she would go unnoticed, but Sam is standing by the coffee maker, waiting for it to finish brewing.
Jody leans over to clink her bottle to his.
“Yeah”, he whispers. “But I would… I would like us to be friends. I do.”
“I suppose so. Until next time.” Uriel’s wings are out the next second, black against the tattered wallpaper, and the second after that, he is alone.
it’s been 77 days since he first met dean, and, by word of mouth of course, “cas”
Castiel nods. He will. Probably embarrassingly quickly. Maybe that’s okay. Dean pulls him into a hug, and Castiel wraps his arms around him. It’s perfect.
“Hey, Cas…” Jeez, he really doesn’t know how to do this, but he feels like he should at least try. “Sorry about the whole… Crowley thing.” Castiel just looks at him from a couple of inches away, maybe waiting for him to continue. “Look, we can talk more about it as soon as… once everyone leaves. But man, it was... “ He swallows. “It was always you.” Castiel, the asshole, smirks a little. “Course it was always you.” They kiss again, slow and sweet, and the impatient parts of Dean wishes everyone would clear out immediately so he and Cas can take this somewhere else, but eventually he leans back and with a final squeeze to Castiel’s hip, he lets go. “We’ll pick this back up later, too”, he promises. Castiel brushes his knuckles against Dean’s. “Good.”
This is falling apart quicker than he could have imagined.
.” dean’s eyes snap up to meet his. “what d’you mean
“That’s good”, Castiel says, trying (and failing) again not to stare at Dean’s face. It’s symmetrical to the point where it almost looks unreal, like a painting come to life. “I can’t drive.”
Dean gives him a lopsided smile, and Castiel doesn’t think he can do this anymore, actually. He pushes himself up to standing, but Dean puts a hand on his arm to halt him.
Something cold clenches in his chest.
“Don’t say that in front of Dean. He doesn’t know yet.”
"I prayed to you, Cas! In every aisle!"
“Mother”, he greets, sounding bored, before turning back to Sam and Dean. “Really, is this how you welcome your old friend? Your saviour?”
Castiel stares into his wine glass and lets his thoughts wander. There are things he likes more than birthday parties; but he’s here, and he made an effort, which is what he promised he’d do. But the cheery energy has long since fizzled out and the guests are scattered around the decorated yard in smaller groups, and the girl sitting next to him just left to get a refill, so Castiel takes a moment to take in the scene in front of him. It’s a beautiful summer night and Charlie looks happy, perched on the armrest of the couch across the pateo, cheeks flushed from drinking and laughing. Castiel takes another sip, knowing he should probably switch to water any minute now. He doesn’t really drink at all these days. Charlie always jokes about her birthday parties being his only exception, and it’s not like she doesn’t have a point.

Castiel watches him for a few seconds before speaking, and it’s routine, it’s automatic, for Dean to just return his gaze, wordlessly, until Castiel starts speaking with words instead.
“What do you do?” he asks, curious despite himself. Dean shrugs a little, looking bashful.
“One kiss”, he agrees, moving in closer, crowding Castiel against the side of the car.
“Hello!”
When Castiel gets his phone back, there’s a number saved under the name “Dean Winchester”. He looks at it for a few moments, before tapping the text symbol and typing Hello into the chat. He adds a bee emoji for good measure, before locking the phone again.

Jack looks a little put on the spot.
“No, no more toasts”, Dean cuts in. “Let’s just drink. Lemme just clear the table, then we can get the party started.”
“So nothing’s changed there, then.”
“You know. Life things happened. But I miss it.”
“No”, Sam clarifies. “He doesn’t know that

it’s day 112 in purgatory. words travel fast. everybody knows there’s an angel running through the woods. the leviathans are on his heels around the clock and he’s got blood on his hands.
“Not Jack as in the son of Lucifer?”
“Tell me about it. Hopefully, one day they’ll figure it out.”
Castiel frowns and fishes up his phone from the inner pocket of the suit jacket he wears beneath the trench coat.

it’s day 194 in purgatory. castiel is hiding out in a shallow cave, there’s something wrong with his ankle. his grace is fickle, there one moment and gone the next, flickering inside him like a faulty light bulb. the ankle hurts like everything else, but is really nothing compared to the ever growing ache in his chest. lately, dean’s prayers have been subdued, despondent. castiel wonders for the thousandth time if they’re ever going to see each other again. if they’ll live that long.
“No you didn’t! You still had the Mark, you were really obnoxious about it! I did not want to hear about it!”
“Nothing”, he grumbles. “It’s just. All of this.”

“And… we both like to teach?”
“But it was really good”, he says softly.
(Cas page 2) I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
“To love!”
Jack loves him, unconditionally. Inexplicably. Jack admires him so much it terrifies him and makes him want to do better and be a better role model and show him more love. He thinks about Ben.
“See! It’s just you who are old, Dean. Come on, Jack. Have you ever danced before?”
Dean takes another step towards him and puts both hands on his shoulders. His grip is light, but he shakes him nonetheless.
“I told you that in confidence!” he grits out, blushing profusely.
“Yeah.”
“Uh-huh. Heard that one before, buddy.”
“To my brother, Dean, for pulling this off- don’t know where you got your cooking skills from, cause it wasn’t our parents- no offense, mom.”
he exhales the last of purgatory, wipes his bloody hands on the emerald green grass beneath him. his sense of purpose snaps into place like it never left.
Castiel smiles a little.
“What’s wrong about it?”
it’s been 68 days since he first met dean. “and it’s like. despite everything he did, everything that happened, you know? i need to… i just gotta find him.” benny doesn’t need an explanation. didn’t ask for one. taking stock of the emotions that flicker over dean’s features, something dawns on him. “
“Okay”, he says, trying not to sound too upset. “But you have to promise me.”
Dean honest to God rolls his eyes at him.

Like a dam breaking, the thoughts roll out in waves, and then they go round and round like laundry in a tumble dryer. Castiel stays in the room that was once a kitchen and follow them around, helplessly.
“Don’t say that. Is that emo drunk you talking, or Cas?”
it’s day 39 in purgatory. he’s surrounded, the leviathans got him cornered, and he slashes his way through them fueled by nothing but fear and adrenaline. he’s so sure this is it, this is how he dies. this would be a great moment for cas to finally show his fucking face.
“Dean”, Castiel cuts in, “what are you talking about?”
“A lot of friends”, he finishes lamely. “It’s fine. I prefer it that way. I’m not a lot of fun, to be honest.”
“We went to high school together, so we go way back, I guess. How do you know her?”
have bullet journals. You should see Chuck's.
“Oh, my. And who have we here?”
“Wow, never thought I’d say this, but. Uh. It’s good to see you”, Dean settles on. Crowley smirks, looking way more self-satisfied than Dean is comfortable with.
He returns to the couch, grateful that no one’s taken his seat next to Dean. He sinks down, angling his head up to meet those irresistible eyes.
He had been so… so…
“I’m ready to give my toast now!” Jack says, and he’s somehow acquired a little bit of black eyeliner too, along with a party hat made of pink craft paper that Dean had no idea they even owned.
If looking at cars is what it takes to be friends with straight guys, then so be it. Castiel can do that, easily.
“I thought the angel said Jack was their child?”
“No”, he admits, curiously watching for Dean’s reaction.
That was then.
Sam rolls his eyes and chuckles, but Eileen just snorts.
“Well done, buddy.”
“Strangely addictive. Though I suppose, being a father of two wouldn’t be too different from being a father of one.”
“Yeah. And kids are great.”
over “week” : “teach jack enochian”
“That really you?” Dean hears himself asking. It’s like no time has passed since they last saw each other. He had sort of been thinking about what to say, but never arrived at anything. What do you say to your enemy-turned-ally who then sacrifices his life for you and your brother in an apocalyptic dimension but is then brought back since what’s dead never really stays dead? Really, what’s the protocol here?
No, hang on. That doesn’t make sense. “I don’t know what gave you that impression”, Dean continues. “The only thing I’ve been doing since I arrived here is flirt with you. And I just assumed you were gay, because you were a friend of Charlie’s. You are gay, right?”
“I didn’t ask to hear about it either!” she protests loudly. “Sam told me against my will.”
“Awesome. I’m Dean.” He moves the beer bottle to his left hand and stretches out the right one, and Castiel shakes it politely. Castiel is drunk, but not drunk enough to be worried about embarrassing himself. He thinks. For some reason he really, really doesn’t want to embarrass himself in front of this man. “Party’s almost over, huh? Had to be at a dinner thing with my brother tonight, but I texted Charlie and she said you guys were still going. So.”
“It’s… you know. Nothing about it is wrong. It’s perfect.” He glances over at the angel, all blue eyes and earnest focus. “And… with another kid, you know? Even better. Unless you… don’t want me to have any part in that, which I’d understand, and it’s totally your call- I mean, it’s not like we decided to become Jack’s parents in the first place, sometimes I don’t even know how we ended up like this, but-”
“No, no I get that. It’s not like you were raised like the rest of us, so I get it.”
Thank you so much for reading and engaging with this fic 💛💛💛 it makes my day! Next week we're back to weekly spreads :)
Dean smiles at him and from up close, it’s unlike anything else. “Can’t I be your friend?”
Dean laughs, and it’s a beautiful sound; and the world is a perfect place right now. Castiel feels light and giddy in the warm summer night and he wants this moment, right here, to last an eternity.
“I know what you mean.”
Castiel blushes at that.
Castiel rolls his eyes.
Sam huffs out a laugh, but it’s fond.
“It is.”
Dean sucks in a sharp breath.
Again, from the bottom of my heart tysm for reading and engaging with this story 💛
Castiel moves in closer, a hand on his cheek, catching his eyes. The corners of Dean’s lips automatically tug upwards as Castiel closes the space between them. It’s a very chaste, gentle kiss, but even so it makes him blush. Dean’s hand comes up to rest on Castiel’s hip, but he still can’t help but glance towards the kitchen door, hoping they’ll be undisturbed.
“Oh, the pleasure is all mine”. Crowley turns to look at Sam again. “How long was I gone for? Both Winchesters settled down? Does mother know Hell’s frozen over?”
“I’m not that drunk.”
“Better ask Dean that”, Rowena quips from across the room.
Uriel clears his throat. Castiel blinks, and returns his gaze. Uriel looks annoyed, a very human emotion. Castiel cannot help but glance down at his vessel’s hands: he still doesn’t know quite how to do that. How to blend in. He looked into a mirror, once, and saw his vessel’s eyes stare back at him. He did not particularly like that.
“Whatever you’re thinking of doing, don’t”, Sam warns, pointing a finger. “Look, whatever’s going on between them, that’s none of our business. But they’re getting along, for once. And if you ruin this night for Dean I’ll kill you. Hell, if you so much as set off an argument between those two, I’ll kill you.”
“Jack, it’s a figure of speech”, Sam says, ever the defuser of precarious situations.
“Just over there on the counter. Thanks.” He smiles. “Coffee?”
“That’s actually pretty cool.”
My apologies for the delayed chapters! My week (see what I did there) has been a struggle, lol. Also sorry I haven't really been able to respond to your comments!! I'll get to that asap. I love and cherish every one of them, hearing your thoughts and theories and feedback always makes me so so happy. Thank you for sticking with this story! <3
Crowley sat back in his chair with an amused look, fingers entwining over his abdomen. “Looks like someone tipped off the clergy. The other clergy, of course.”
“Nope, no.” Dean was doubly mad he colored up like a schoolgirl. Couldn’t he even glance at a guy without getting accused of scamming on him? He most certainly did not look like a guy who needed to be setup, he could get his own dates damnit.
Dean smirked. “Toodle-loo,” he murmured as he walked light-heartedly down the steps to the spotless cement path. See? He was just as pretty as the priest. Well, almost as.
Dean peered over with a small saw in hand, levelling off the tables and one pew that he hadn’t noticed was sadly askew. “Boxes.”
“Sure. What’s that place with the four pound burgers?” He called after him.
“Do you even know your way around?”
“Hey brother.” Benny then grinned at Sam. “Hey brother’s brother.”
He munched on the crackers and grapes beside him, which apparently was to ‘cleanse the palate’ between tasting. They took their competitions seriously.
Both looked thoroughly confused as they looked around. The oldest finally cottoned on and saw his mom, still standing there looking as if she had on a poofy skirt made out of plastic lumps.
He stared. “Well, when a man loves a man very much…”
During a lull in the conversation Dean checked his phone. No answer after tease? He girded up his liquid courage and typed.
A few were heading the opposite direction, guzzling their drinks and beers like their throats were on fire before they even had chili.
Dean nods at Sam and four of his frat buddies as they take a seat, winks at a table with five college age girls. There a couple of familiar faces he’s seen at shows before, that was cool.
“I think so.” Cas was giving him all his attention again, that sort of intensity that gave him goosebumps down his arms. “If I’m not to write a clue on my chest, how should I go about this?”
He deflated somewhat. “What?”
Of course a chorus of laughter sounded all around, good natured, but Dean still felt his cheeks getting hot.
It was a huge relief to let go of the thought Sam had been dating on the downlow out of fear of his father and brother. No, Sam was doing his good old-fashioned shy thing.
“It’s a movie. Ever see one?” He didn’t mean the question to come off rude, he just thought of them as kneeling and praying all the time. This was one of the strangest conversations he had ever had, and he met a lot of people in his lifetime. Usually in surreal situations. Like this.
Castiel let out a breath of relief.
He stiffened as he heard footsteps entering the tiny tiled space. Should he say again that Cas did a good job? That would sound great. ‘Oh trust me, you got this down. Let’s practice some more.’ Fuck.
Sam did manage to pull off looking surprised. “Hey, I didn’t know you came around here.”
It was like an addiction, staring at the serious set of Cas’s mouth. But it was a very, very bad one, because if he looked so long he’d start imagining them doing a variety of other things.
Blood dripped down the skin, just tan enough to look more golden than pale.
“I...I want..I mean, I’m asking...” Oh god his back was drenched in sweat and it was a breezy night. “Cas,” he started again firmly, the back of his neck heating up at all the faces turning toward them.
Sam was desperately searching for his headphones, which were on the other side of the computer. “C’mon. I don’t do that to you.”
“If you would ever like to come by Mass, we began at eight in the morning on weekdays.” Castiel had a formal way of speaking, as if he never heard of slang. It had to be an affectation to keep up his holy presence.
“Have you texted her?”
Where we follow; is where angels fear to tread.
“Yes.” A trickle of unease ran down his spine. The old-fashioned booth was updated to block sound from both sides, logically he knew they weren’t alone. But the silence was thick and the isolation uncomfortable at the moment. “You start with the worst sins.”
The place didn’t have a television, so he pulled his ancient laptop on his lap and aimlessly perused the internet for a while. Cat video, cat video, religious ads. At some point he did get up and make a bowl of canned stew and treated himself to several of Edith’s cookies.
It was hard to tell in the lack of light, but Blue Eyes was watching him. Him, specifically, unwaveringly so. It sent a funny set of chills down his already tense arms.
“Right,” Dean said, “but you like him, right?”
The priest didn’t react at all to the pointed diatribe except to fold the flyer twice and tuck it into his black robe. “I will give the thought consideration. Good day, Minister.”
“Oh?” Dean snorted, idly digging his fingers into the shredded meat over the angel’s heart. “Going to ‘grip me tight and pull me out of perdition’, are you? Bullshit, tell me another one.”
He did continue to canvass the neighborhood, but each young guy didn’t quite fit the picture each time. Needless to say, it was a productive morning, but not for
Both stopped and stared at each other.
“Oh, I hear that so much.” Charlie smiled brightly. “I remember he told me he came in a few times with Lisa, my sister with dark hair?”
“If she is a head nun, yes. Otherwise they are Sisters.”
He looked dubiously at the steeple high above all the buildings. “Maybe we should just drive, I don’t need to stretch my legs that much.”
“Okay. How long will you be?”
The houses were as different as could be, some looked like tiny cottages from a magazine and others had maybe two patches of grass and broken vehicles sitting in the cracked driveways.
“Oh. Well, hmm.” She made the non-committal sounds while still staring at the ceiling.
“Yeah.”
Dean made sure to say goodbye to Edith and resumed his line of thought. “Benny has a truck. So, are they any ladies groups in this town? Sewing, book clubs, tea time, or something?”
“Okay, now I want you to grab it with both hands.”
Dean cleared his throat, realizing he was standing there daydreaming. “I just wanted to let him get sleep.”
Dean wasn’t completely oblivious. He looked between Cas and Sam who were on the same side of the table but didn’t hold hands or even brush knees. Hell, Dean’s calf touched Cas’s on accident more than those two were touching.
“Yep,” Dean plucked two beers out of Gabe’s hands and took a seat on the couch and dared, dared Sam to say anything. He’d ride this shit-train to the ground.
, which expands on that line of thinking. It strips away the short-lived petty judgments and intertwines the divine and the universe.” Cas spoke so seriously and intently, gaze trained on Sam and nobody else.
Sweat made it hard to crack open a bottle but he managed, lifting the heavenly brew and drinking it like it held the secret of life at the bottom. He knew people were staring. Maybe shielding their children’s eyes. Dean didn’t care, he was possibly about to die in some tiny bump in the road with its entire population goggling at him.
“You don’t need this for protection. That’s why you have me.” He reached around and draped one arm around Dean’s chest, palm pressing firmly against his shoulder.
Cas’s gaze travelled over the crowd and to the tables. More than one person hid their bottle behind their back and stared hard at the ground. His attention crawled back to Dean and he remained serious-faced. “I might have to do that.”
Dean smirked, he knew she couldn’t stay away. He was disappointed she missed his pounding performance out there, he knew he looked good out there. He was a good looking guy all the time, but girls professed all the time he became downright sexy up on stage.
Cas appeared taken back, glancing around as if not sure what to make of that.
“Yeah. Gonna give Sam some privacy tonight.”
Color rose up from neck to face so red it nearly matched her hair. She puffed up again and left to clip back some of the roses so newcomers didn't trip and get lost forever.
Castiel couldn’t remember the last time he had to explain the process. The priest of the church he grew up was very strict about how many times. He always said, count your sins
Gus nodded, fiddling with a container of powdered creamer. “How did that, like, work?”
He looked at Cas and there was a curve to that mouth touched with pink and fullness, especially the bottom lip.
Pfffft, what a liar.
Despite the other man’s amusement, Castiel closed his eyes very tightly, and focused. “I would suggest avoiding the circumstances that led to the deaths. Also, if the...deaths are a matter of unresolved legality, that should be taken care of. If not, then perhaps their family has lingering issues and could use assistance.”
Couldn’t blame him, Dean would be pretty put out if he were in the guy’s position. “Two more Thighslappers!” He held up two fingers to the non-owner bartender and wiggled the bottle in case she couldn’t hear him. He threw down a five once they were placed in front of him and held out one to Castiel.
“Yeah well your research sucks. He’s not going to the church I’m now in charge of.”
He leaned forward, elbows balanced on his knees. “If I may ask, do you feel sorry for doing that?” Castiel tried to word it delicately, using his most neutral tone.
“Okay,
Well, Dean had been his wingman then and he’d be his wingman now.
“Should I start from my very first sin? I think I stole bubblegum from the corner store and got my ass beat raw.” He chuckled darkly. Then a soft tapping sound on the lattice startled Castiel. “Can you see me through here, Cas?”
He screamed at the light, it burned him through the imaginary clothes he wore and seared at his brain. Gradually the pain stopped and he lowered his arm.
His eyes though. Solemn, watchful, and this amazing shade of blue the sky would be jealous of.
She smiled and nodded, so trusting. “I get that, I do. Hey, let me take you out for dinner. It’ll help you with your feeling, ha ha.”
Before Sam could text his crush in secret, Dean casually said, “You could invite Cas, if you want.”
“Sounds like the best offer I’ve had all night.” Dean grinned at him.
He shook his head. “There will be no tearing apart of anything here. Besides, I’m pretty sure tempting a priest is a first class ticket to hell and a painful one at that.”
Bella smiled again, all gentle understanding. “Yes. You know, I was just asking Jo if she had met your brother. I think they would make such a cute couple.”
“Just take a seat. It’s just the two of us, unless you got a problem with germs?” Dean twisted the cap off and waited for Cas to shake his head before drinking straight out of the bottle. He’d never had Jack Daniels Honey. The sweet smoothed out a lot of the bite he normally associated with the stuff.
Shit, he forgot Sam and all his friends were nerds.
Charles’ eyes got big, but not angry. “Oh. Uhh.”
“I was in a fraternity once,” he said gravely.
Blue eyes filled his vision, the priest in question was kneeling beside him and reaching a hand out.
It was a seven hour drive to Kansas so he filled up at a Gas n’ Sip and treated his Baby to a quick wipe down to remove grease stains and various litter. Baby was an oft rebuilt Impala ‘67, opened by his father and passed down to him. Some of his best times with his father were staring under its black hood, getting grease in the creases of his hands and small cuts cauterized with oil.
Dean dumped an entire water bottle over his head once they were in the back room with a comfy sofa and an adjoining bathroom. He shook his head briskly, splattering everyone with mingled sweat and water.
Dean was beginning to think it wasn’t because the memories were unhappy, but rather that Cas’s parents just weren’t even around to make memories with.
Dean’s back hit the wall with force as a forearm pressed against his chest and thighs against his. Cas was literally pinning him to the wall, blue eyes poring over his face again with one eyebrow raised.
There were two things that Dean knew.
“Even if it doesn’t involve copious amounts of booze, rock, and orgies?”
Benny smacked Scott upside the head. “
Due to some flattering praise, there will be several timestamps added to this in the nearby future. Hearts all around!!
“Naw. I didn’t mean to keep it a secret, I just forgot. I’m Dean.”
All this nervous energy could be poured into the show, he’d done it before, he would do it now. Loading the gear into the back was familiar and didn’t require any thought, it didn’t help. Pulling on his favorite pale green shirt that brought out his eyes didn’t make him feel better either. Cassie would probably think he was wearing it for her and laugh with all her stupid nerd friends.
Castiel had come to categorize sinners by two types; sinkers and swimmers. The sinkers were the whisperers, the mumblers with the same harm each time. The swimmers seemed to move on to new mundane things, coveting a pretty person outside their marriage, lying about being sick to their boss.
Dean didn’t say anything to that for a long time.
“I’m...afraid I don’t know much about tools.” He watched the trail of Dean’s fingers along the metal handle.
Cas nodded at her solemnly and picked up the fork and knife to carefully cut into the quadruple layered burger oozing with cheese.
But when he woke up the next morning, dragging with a hangover, he was pleased to see that he had a text.
Instead of moving, the kid looked back at Dean. “Her?”
“He’s a priest.”
Charlie nodded slowly. “It was so unexpected, I’m glad I made time to see her often.”
Alone at last.
Charlie continued with a big smile. “The top winner, of course, will get their choice of three tubs of Miss Edith’s cookie dough and yes, it does include her famous Snickerdoodles. The other winners will get one as well.”
After another unwitting glance at the mouth belonging to Cas, no, belonging to God, Dean carefully leaned back and pushed off with one leg to get further under the sink.
“Oh yeah, why are you getting your Arts and Crafts degree anyway? I thought you wanted to be a lawyer.”
Too much self-analyzing!
Instead of raising in defense, the angel let itself be dragged back and bound to the rack. Its lack of movement was so suspicious that the other demons backed away once the chains were clicked shut, as if expecting it to spring out of the shackles and smote all.
On the downside, Sam was staring at him like he was a freak. “How drunk are you? You’re all flushed.”
Cas nodded. “Very much so. I’ll still have more schooling, but that is fine. My family is coming up for graduation, at least my parents will.”
She was also paying, so he meticulously copied the bank account number with the upfront money and placed a small amount for travel in his.
They got a damn big cheer and calls for an ovation after the last song, Letting Go of You. Dean traded a look with Benny and he announced one of their more popular hits, God is Bisexual. It was dirty and loud and Donny got to bring the house down with an extended solo.
Dean nodded, then snatched the glass right of his brother’s hand and took a sip before Sam could nab it back. He choked. “Soda?
Cas shook his head. “Just studying.”
“Of course, Father.” Edith looked between them as if unable to decide which to settle on. “Thank you Pastor, but only if it’s not too much trouble.”
The Roadhouse was ran by a no-nonsense woman named Ellen. He had only spoken on the phone with her before, and she showed them everything they needed to set up immediately.
Cas knew Dean didn’t exactly have a home growing up, and Dean knew that Cas had good parents who worked hard on their charities and philanthropies.
again because it was such a good lead-in to the harder stuff.
“What a shocker.” Dean kept his hands at his side and just watched Cas out of the corner of his eye. It might be pushing it a little far, but that was just who he was. He manfully kept his mouth firmly shut as Cas finally tipped the bottle back and drank several times, gasping after each gulp, to carefully check where the liquid fell.
“What, like a program?” Donnie asked, arms full of drums.
“I appreciate the offer,” Cas said seriously. “Father Raphael mentioned that you had passed along a message for me.”
“Don’t worry, I’d never tell my friend’s ex about them.”
Cas turned around, finally revealing the black design all over his back.
“I wanted you to forgive me.”
“You’re coming out over the phone?” Sam asked not seriously at all. “I mean...this means so much to me. But I’ve known for years, honestly.”
Dean returned to the Judge’s table to meet John and say hello to the curious people stopping for a chat and introduction. Some he recognized from their house, but most were new faces. He closely checked out each young man around his age to see if they matched Lisa’s description until Crowley coughed.
Charlie learns about her 'brother'.
When Dean lifted his head, he saw Cas’s solemn face and said nothing. He slid out of Cas when straightening up, refastening his jeans and placing one hand over the shackle. It opened and clinked as it swung and hit the wall behind them.
“Well, I guess there is the Bowling League. We’ve got two teams of young women, the Sassafras’s and Three-Finger Salute’s.”
Clearing his throat, Dean tried his best to divert his thoughts back to the topic at hand. He was going to need more alcohol. He grabbed the abandoned bottle in the corner and took a damn long drink. He tried to sound matter of fact once he shoved the bottle at Cas. “Shoulders, chest, whatever. I don’t think it matters at this point.”
“Hey, are you okay?” Sam leaned over as the other two stood up and scooted out of the booth.
Bullshit. Dean snuck up behind Sam and leaned over his shoulder. “Dude!”
Dean and Cas are stuck at dinner together. Stuck is really a strong word for what's going on though. Bonus points to anyone who knows what the chapter name is from! :D
Maybe never.
The messy hair caught his eye, even though it was lined with grey. And when the older guy turned, he didn’t the bold blue eyes of Cas, but they were blue enough.
Sammy was a sophomore in college and acing it, something Dean was especially proud of. That was great. Heck, their grandfather Samuel had even paid for his tuition. Sam took after the man, after all, always had his nose stuck in a book.
Charlie looked dubiously at the boxes that had not been there the night before. “What are these?”
Since they walked to the exhibit, Cas made his goodbyes on the stairs of the event center and left on foot. Sam and Dean turned the other way, and one of them had a mission.
Dean stared after him, head tilting. He wasn’t sure if the Mayor was angling for bribes or hitting on him. Could be both, he supposed. Finishing setting up the bottles and cards, he noticed that while they were talking quite a few contestants had arrived with pots, bowls, and spoons.
“Do you like those things?”
They walked around for a bit longer, grabbing a burger for him while Sam had his soy tofu sprouts sandwich or something. Okay, it was a little disappointing that he wasn’t going to experience a Friday college night of heavy alcohol use and skimpily dressed sorority chicks, but Sam was so damn glad to have him around. He introduced him to more of the fraternity brothers, almost all as nerdy as Sam, Dean could sense it.
“Kay. You sound crazy. Maybe you should get out while I remember I’m a man of peace,” Dean said gruffly. He knew he was made, but if his dad taught him anything it was
The only problem was he wasn’t going to get any privacy while rooming with his brother. He could sneak off to the bathroom like when they all stayed in one room.
Cas’ dorm wasn’t as large as the ones at the House, but it had a sitting area with the bed scooted off almost out of sight and a tiny kitchenette. Everything was in its place, and that white hoodie was stretched along the foot of the bed, the design on the back folded inside so he still didn’t get a good look.
“I had a pleasant evening, Sam, thank you. Good night Dean.” He looked in the backseat with his amazingly blue eyes, catching Dean’s attention for a long moment.
Dean groaned as he palmed through his jeans. He was not imagining the words spoken in a deep voice. Maybe with a dark eyebrow raised and pink lips parted. Just like earlier.
Dean hadn’t realized how close they were, his gaze moving over the other man’s face slowly. “It’s like nothing you can imagine."
“I look forward to talking to you every night. I love hearing a text sound because I hope it’s from you. I know that we haven’t had much time together, but we will. I’m moving down here when you go start school again, and I hope you’ll move in with me.”
“It’s a community event. You did say we wouldn’t be putting people on the spot or feeling like they had to be in attendance of our church to show up, remember?”
Dean was getting changed into some sleep pants when he heard Sam typing away again. “What’re you doing?” he asked narrowly, paranoid now.
“I also gave him, uh, a flyer for Saturday. If you could, spread the word.” He almost winced at his use of the phrase. Focus back on track, Dean, focus. “I should get back to measuring these. I think I’m going to replace all of the with PVC pipes, at least whatever we can afford.”
“Okay, but what happens when you’re in the situation? Close your eyes.” Dean stopped walking and turned to Cas, grabbing his shoulders lightly, trying to avoid wrinkling that robe thing.
“I’m gonna go check out that breakfast.” Dean took his phone and his dignity down the stairs two steps at a time, getting lost twice in the side halls before reaching his nirvana. Their kitchen was amazing. Breakfast was on no less than five platters. What kind of master chef did they have? Right off the bat he saw the bacon, sausage, ham. And other stuff like eggs, toast, and fruit.
So denial was the order of the day. He just had to get to the last gig under his belt - phrasing! - and he’d head back to Lebanon and leave Sam to it. No more help, that was for sure. Dean was just going to get as plastered as possible like he had originally planned and keep reminding himself Sam was better off without his screwed up, boundary crossing brother.
It was a job that skirted the line of legality often, a line their father taught them how to avoid getting caught crossing. He was gone now, but Dean didn't know any other life and his brother didn't trust him on his own.
It took longer for Cas to make his solemn goodbyes, but eventually they were leaving the park’s boundaries. Dean didn’t say much at first, because normally he neither walked nor made small talk with genuine members of the clergy.
“Yes.”
“That’s what you do when a guy falls behind! You’re playing with the big boys tonight.” He grinned, moving his head to the beat. The music was still hard, just the way he liked it.
“How much do I owe you for the drink?”
“Right, Mother Superior! I’ve watched Sister Act.”
“Including me and you?”
Broken out of his reverie of hazy images and hot prickles under his skin, he looked away from Cas. “I’m workin’ on it.” Dean muttered, taking a big mouthful and showing it to Sam on his tongue.
“No, around here.” He made a circle around his feet. “Who’s the normal pastor minister person?”
Dean belatedly realized there was no way whatsoever to get ahold of the guy, if he had any other questions, said quickly, “I’ll be here most of the week, fixing things.”
Cas looked at them, unsurprised of course because Sam thought he was sneaky, inclined his head and sat down. “Hello, Dean. Hello, Sam.”
“Was it flavorful and moist?”
“A wha?”
Then the lights above exploded, literally exploded, sending a shower of sparks down as the door opened.
“What?” Dean looked up from his phone, blinking. Okay, that sounded interested. Anything with the word massacre had to be.
The tip of his tongue swiped along his tongue, eyes still closed.
“Cause he’d be dehydrated and sore.”
“Hey, aren’t you hot in that?” Dean said loudly, to be heard over the music. He forgot to check what the pattern was on the back, but before he could ask Castiel was pulling the whole thing over his head, shirt riding up with it.
“Really? Those did have the best burgers, I’ll admit. Fine, I won’t shove him under the table at any point screaming about the machine revolution. I guess.”
“Eight.”
“Thanks.” She looked at the card and rubbed her fingers across it. “You know, I just wanted to say thank you again. It’s been really rough without guidance here. I know people need this, but widespread acceptance isn’t coming easy.” She looked up at him with the strain showing around her eyes and mouth. “I’m so glad you accepted. We had some good offers, but none who spoke to me the way you do. You understand the struggle of being different.”
“No.” Sam started shaking his head.
Cas was staring at him. Through all the noise and people and movement, his blue eyes never flickered or lowered.
“We do, actually.”
“Charlie, you still at the church?” he asked once she answered.
Still he said nothing.
Okay, so maybe Cas thinks Dean is hitting on him and not giving him advice about Sam. Cas is completely oblivious to Sam liking him. That made sense, Cas didn’t not grasp things right away, that was easy enough to tell.
“Fuck, Cas,” he mumbled as he wrapped his fingers his bare skin. Yeah it was a good thing, a very good thing. Pre-cum was already leaking over his fingers, making everything hot and slick as he loosely pumped with one hand.
This time he did, looking around with a puzzled air before his eyes fell on Dean. “Err, my name is Charles. Are you speaking to me?” Oh man, he was well-spoken. Even though the tone was friendly, Cas’s dad was clearly educated. And wearing a suit that must’ve cost more than Dean made in a month.
Nowhere near the full curves Dean’s lips had, he’d certainly been complimented enough on his mouth to feel a bit of pride when he gave an outrageous smile and flirty wink. His favorite bit of praise was ‘biteable’. Didn’t understand it till he looked at Cas’s mouth.
The man was smart, charming, and he’d built their surroundings with his two hands. Dean was no stranger to hard work, with his rough hands and casual mention of raising two boys when he was a child himself.
“I’ll be out here. See ya Wings, Goliath.” The door shut behind him and that was better for him, cause Dean totally could have taken him.
“Drink up then, this’ll knock your collar in the dirt.” He just wanted tos ee if Cas would do it. Ceremonial wine schwine, he wanted to see a Servant of the Lord drink whiskey because if God was real, he was already going to hell.
The thumb brushing the back of his hand pressed into the wide parts of his palm, massaging slowly while it was drawn in deeper and lifted. It wasn’t an uncomfortable angle, he was already sitting close enough it simply took moving his arm forward.
“Oh, the Turners. You didn’t knock, did you?”
They went through eleven different chilis, which made it even more insulting when Charlie stood up with the counted scorecards to announce the winner. “We actually have a consensus on which chili is the Judges’ Favorite and the Town Favorite! It’s number three, Miss Dovie Grayson’s Rainbow Rocket chili!” Charlie happily read off and everybody cheered and had a great ol’ time.
He held up two fingers to the bartender again, looking back at Castiel. His upper body under the thin cotton shirt matched his legs, deceptively strong and clearly toned.
Dean gets a surprise visit, and makes one himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
He knew he'd never look at communion the same.
Cas tilted his head again, eyes narrowing slightly in thought.
(See the end of the chapter for
Bradford never looked away from him, eyes narrowed. “Paper or plastic?”
Sam quirked an eyebrow. “No… Now, what’s this I hear about you--”
“No time!” Dean turned and went the way he saw the coordinator taking the teams. He headed toward huge octagon with sturdy metal walls on the bottom and a chain link fence on the top.
After the other winners were announced and Dean had to stop staring at the curve of Cas’s jaws every few minutes to chat with another person passing by, Dovie approached him nervously.
Uneasy, he looked behind him in case someone else was walking by.
Gabe looked really excited, the disgusting pervert. If he were a cartoon wolf, his eyes would have popped out his skull and tongue lolled on the ground.
“Oh no, no we can't. Edith rules the town with her baked goods. The other ladies have long since given up on trying, if I’m going to be honest. The school tried it last year, innocent as you can be... There I had the worst cherry tarts I ever, even though I know May is a perfectly fine cook. So petty.”
“Hey, I’m going to bed. You gonna stay up?” Sam was stretching and yawning, even though it was early as shit.
“She has had a rough life.”
“He’s gone, brother.” Benny snickered and slapped a hand on his shoulder. “I’m out too. Good luck with that.” And his own bandmate, the man he slept in smelly-sock van with, and helped write songs left him standed there.
Basements were not his friend. He'd had more ambushes there than anywhere else. As he reached for the handle the light flickered above.
“Was I bold enough?” Cas stood by the door so Dean could, and did, get a clear look at his concerned expression.
Dean glared at him.
Dean nodded, heartbeat speeding up again. He looked over his shoulder at Cas’s parents, noting their confusion. It spurred on his determination.
“I think you misspoke.”
“Oh no, of course not. I usually make meatloaf on Sunday. Not spicy meatloaf. Is that, is that okay?”
Even though he had to leave Cas, and couldn’t quite work up the nerve to get some before he left, the idea boiled in the back of his head.
The same thing happened at the church later. Resigning himself to being there the whole week, the Great Pipe project began. The place sorely needed it, whoever had worked on it before just replaced busted pipes and didn’t do it properly to boot. He’d need to take out all of them in the tiny, cramped space of the utility room standing right next to the hot water heater.
“No.” Despite his words, Cas was getting slick and loose. “I can see you, to the soul. I’m not saying no, because it’s you.”
Sam didn’t even look intrigued. Dean wasn’t into guys, but if he was, between that voice and that hair that looked like he just got rode hard and put up wet…
“Father, why don’t you be an unofficial Judge?” One woman lingered near him, a huge old cross resting on her collarbone. “Of the chili, of course. I can bring you a bowl of each.” Her smile was a bit extra friendly, but subtle enough.
was going to work.
“What are we toasting to?” Cas asked, a crinkle appearing between his eyes as if it was a foreign concept.
Dean jogged up the stairs and knocked twice confidently. A young boy answers the door and Dean’s hopes soar.
The older man turned in his seat, nose wrinkling slightly. “You drink a lot for a Minister.”
“Sorry,” Dean muttered to Benny as he tried to concentrate on practicing their first song of the night. It was
“I apologize for my rudeness. I am Father Castiel Novak.” He took a step closer as if to offer his hand, but it never rose.
“Then perhaps you should call her yourself,” Dean said shortly as he grabbed several cans of soup and chili, heading to the back and checking out the frozen food section. Bradford was behind the counter when Dean dumped an armful of microwaveable foods on it.
Ellen smirked and walked back to go back to stocking the bar for the big night.
“Slow? Jesus wasn’t dead when this place was built.” Oops. He waited for the shock and horror, but she just giggled.
Dean was already four beers in.
Which wasn’t cool, he never felt guilty about posing in any occupation. He’d run the gambit from cop to Federal Agent, high school boyfriend to out-of-state cousin. Hell, he once put on face makeup and an orange wig to get access to a house during a kid’s birthday party.
Dean chuckled. “Don’t worry, I only know enough theology to get me into trouble.”
Indeed there was a tiny salt and pepper shaker set on the otherwise empty counter. After that was finished he recited the directions to the grocery store that he looked up and locked his door on the way out.
The Judge’s table bore neat nameplates. Pr. Dean Paxton, MR F. Crowley, and John Conner.
Dean pulled his focus from the other man to roll his eyes upward. “I’m fine. I’ve hit my head plenty of times.” Or had it hit for him. The vibration was lessening somewhat though. “Umm.. about a moment ago.”
He took his goods back up the stairs because Sam didn’t like anyone eating in his room.
Sam stuck his head in the room as Dean came out while rubbing his head with a towel. “Hey, let’s go out to lunch.”
“There's incest in the Bible!” Dean yelled at the phone, but the call already clicked off. He chuckled as he finished packing the last few important items, his gun and his wallet of aliases.
Some exhibits showcased off-road wheelchairs, Professor X looking, and another had a vest that let one feel music. He got to try on an adult sized one, but what really made it was the glow on the face of a kid happily signing away to his parents.
Dean hated pursing his mouth, he felt like some prude schoolmarm, but if there was ever a time to do it… “All right, we can ask the ‘congregation’ to lend us what they got. How many people we have?” Taking a look at the pews, he tried to do the quick math in his head. 3 rows, 7 pews each...say three people seated in each. “Out of what, sixty, seventy people someone has to have a working set.” We are out in the middle of nowhere after all, he didn’t say.
. Then he added
The kid they were looking for was eleven and this kid looked to be about that age. “Hello. Are you here about the new church?” he asked politely. “My name is Jesse.”
Though it was kind of a nice feeling to not have to look around and wonder what the fuck he did the night before and if it was going to cost money or future gigs. Maybe he should take a page out of this ‘have principles’ thing Sam had going on.
.” Dean squeezed the erection trapped between them, making a crude pantomime against Cas’s hip. He liked ‘Cas’ better, stopped him from getting too excited about this being an angel.
“I'd prefer to stay.” Dean crossed his arms.
Charlie did not disagree. “Yeah. I’ll see you soon.” They hung up and she pursed her lips. Where could that stupid will be?
After the door shut and they were alone, Dean pushed around the tiny triangle of heaven on his plate. He was nervous.
“Oh yeah? Then why are you so eager to get out?” he said it even though he knew that wasn’t entirely fair. Sam was accepted at Wichita State University and actually attended, despite being everything that any college could hope for. The only reason he stayed in state, Dean was sure, was to stay close to home. That’s not what Dean wanted for his genius freak of a brother.
Dean groaned at the soft contact, the first bit of kindness he’d been shown in decades. “Shut up.” But he didn’t punish with his body, continuing the steady thrusting until Cas threw his head back. The filthily wet sounds between them were loud as Cas sucked him in deeper.
“I canvassed the neighborhood around my house, not sure if I mentioned that. Oh no, we talked earlier. Hey, I’m going to try and convince Edith to make pies for this Saturday. If she makes any early, those are forfeit to me. I saw Father Cas at her house too. He’s
Castiel didn’t move for a long time, staring at the dampness shining in the wan light on his fingers and palm.
The next looked promising, though he knew by now that was a lie. Colorful, he gave it a nine. Smelled good, he gave it an 8. It wasn’t greasy or runny so he jotted down 6. By the time he scooped up a tiny portion he was feeling better about this and life in general.
It wasn’t until the weight lifted that Dean realized he was offering whiskey to a friar. He stared owlishly at Cas, who was reading the label carefully. Offering a teasing grin, Dean gestured. “Not against the church, remember?”
“Say, Charlie mentioned there was another new guy in town, moved here a few months ago. She couldn’t remember his name, any ideas?”
“Stealing a kid isn’t exactly biblical, Sammy. Wait, is it? That book is all kindsa fucked up.”
“Dude, your timing is all off.”
Cas was the first to break the silence, his eyes as deep and blue as an endless sky. “Is that bold enough?”
While they wait he heaved a big sigh as he pulls out his phone. “Damn Mark, can’t manage shit,” he muttered.
Denial. Denial denial
Dean’s earlier words came back to him, ‘last time someone looked at me like that, I got laid.’ He didn’t mean to, but he checked out his mouth again.
He took a seat on the only sofa in the place, stretching out his legs and taking the bottle when Cas offered it to him.
“I ain’t shaving for nothing. Tell me what you got.”
“Called Angel Slayer.” She couldn’t contain herself any longer and laughed with delight, slapping her thigh and having a great ol’ time.
And this marks the end of the prompt originated mistaken-identity stalking, though it turned rather interactive, didn't it? ;) Hope it was enjoyed by all, don't forget to tip your waitress! (Me, which is me, leave a review because I love them!)
He crouched down, pointing at the ground in front of him. “Poor stance, you two. And poor manners. A real soldier always helps someone in distress.” Keeping the distinct snap in his voice they’d have heard many a time on tv from a drill sergeant, he pointed behind them.
Cas saw him before he did, vibrant eyes lighting up.
Castiel sat on the padded seat in the confessional, studying at the engravings on the wood door. His fingers ran over the rosary over his other hand, hours of staring at the same point numbing him.
Dean wanted everything to go
“Really?”
“Oh, was I mistakin’?” Benny somehow looked even more pleased with himself. If his grin got any bigger the top of his head was going to fall through that shit-eating maw. “I never did make it as a wise man.”
invited him out for burgers and kept asking for alone time. But Cas said he was attractive and agreed with being a tease so long it was a good thing.
Until his phone rang and he answered, “Hey, Dean here.”
“Thanks.” Dean kinda wished Cas’d stop saying his name with that sex-on-tape voice, it was crossing Dean’s signals all up. Or mixing them. He didn’t know. He blamed this long-ass dry spell.
“Uhhh, everything okay?” Jeremiah tilted his head and blocked Dean’s view.
“We all forget ourselves in pain. Are you all right?” He was really close, eyes trained on the likely bruising skin. He ran a thumb along Dean’s eyelid. “Can you look upward for me?”
“Liquor.”
“Sam!”
. After plying them with wet strokes until spit was leaking down his palm, Dean drew Castiel’s hand down his shirt. “We were talking about forgiving me?”
“Look, the Wagon Bar serves wagon sized pizza and cold beer. We could be home early enough for you to get all your beauty sleep.”
Next chapter up soon! Hope you're all enjoying! And to the review that pointed out my comment count doesn't matter, touche. I'll be responding to reviews posthaste! :D
“I wouldn't do that to Baby!”
“It means there’s nothing I can hack into. You up for a B&E?”
On the way out he grabbed a cookie from the delicate china. He munched on it as he climbed into the Impala. It was really good. He was definitely going to suggest she bring pie on Saturday.
She pretended to be shocked, followed by outrage. “Excuse me?”
It took a few moments to differentiate between the crowd and the groups, which all had matching jackets. A gathering of white caught his eye.
He nodded, trying to hide his swallow. “Right, I do. Um, which...difference spoke to you the most?”
Dean couldn’t bring himself to be sarcastic or say he knew Cas’s was going well. Instead he just grinned dopey and wrote back.
Still, he didn’t think anyone else noticed.
Castiel slowly took a seat, looking from side to side as if contemplating this. He did take a swig though and that was a clear sign all was well.
He was sweating hard after the guitar solo, but the crowd ate it up. They were young and drunk, rocking out after a hard week of exams and homework and the like. He was pretty proud of this one, he helped write it. It was about a guy who had to decide between watching his youngest die or make a deal. It ended tragically, the ones he planned always did.
“Naw, just, uh, I’m going to get changed. Hey man.” He lifted a hand to acknowledge Sam’s friend and stalked to the back. Pfft, he didn’t put himself on display when he was on the scam. His skill out there spoke for itself, drew all the honeys. Some of them, anyway.
Dean couldn’t say why or how or anything about what happened next. He couldn’t even be sure who moved, though he’d never really believe it was him. Or that it was Cas for sure.
Jo was quiet for a moment. “Did you have to stop by the gingerbread house?” That was her clever way of calling Charlie’s mom a witch.
Cas is having a crisis. Dean...doesn't really help, if we're all going to be honest here.
He took pity on her because he was just that kind of upstanding guy. “She asked how you were and said that you looked tired at the cook-off.”
Sam smiled instead of frowned and that was too much for Dean. He turned up the music and jammed in his head the rest of the car ride home.
Percy grinned at him, eager to share. “Every year we have the Monster Apocalypse, where different teams can build a machine and battle. We didn’t do it last year because most of us were on Men of Principle duty. Do you know how many Chapters have closed in just a few years? The Gamma Chapter is killing it and they wanted us to give speeches.” He high-fived the other guy, Roland or something.
Cas nodded with more of a smile. “I want all of that as well. Yes.”
.” Bobbing his head to the beat, he missed the tinny ring of his mobile.
Cas slowly lowered the fork, still warily watching him.
While locking up the church a man walked up the rose-clogged path. He was in his mid-thirties, dark hair, tan and fit. Dean really hoped Gus hadn’t passed along the message that he was looking for a nice young man. Besides, he wouldn’t date someone balding this young, the man would have no hair by forty.
Dean wants to talk to Charlie. Gus wants to talk with Dean. Dean does NOT want to talk with Crowley. And at the end of the day, he finds someone who is going to talk with him.
Dean pointed to him firmly, “Hey, I’ve got knife wounds older than you, you little shit.”
It was quiet for a moment before a deep “Thank you.” broke the air.
Dean flipped off his phone and shoved it back in his pocket as he walked back to the frat house. The air was too warm to calm him down and he surreptitiously adjusted himself.
wasn’t ever around.
“You’re in a kitchen, cooking bacon. You guys eat bacon, right? Okay, anyway, the heat is up, the pan is filling as the bacon curls and crisps. Smells great. You pop outside for a chat or a phone call, maybe have to run to the bathroom. You come back and flames are licking the inside of the pan. The bacon smell is replaced with black smoke pouring into the air, you’re choking on it. What do you do?”
“I’m doing it.” Dean eyed all the empty seats in the very front. He wanted Cas to see him there, reliable and prompt. He wanted to show him that
Dean leaned over to murmur, “Drink up, Sammy, I think someone’s getting lucky tonight.” He grinned at Cas’ retreating back. The guy clearly was dressed for it too with soft blue jeans that tightened along his thighs and ass when he moved.
He walked through the sunken backyard, a tall wooden fence giving him some relative privacy in his coming and goings. It was quite preferred, to be honest, since his hours were often in the dead of night depending on the nature of the hunt.
She got rather flustered. “Right. Thank you. I just, um, came over to, really I came over to invite you for dinner. To say sorry. And thank you, for talking to the boys. They really do need a man in their...not that I’m saying, I mean..” She floundered off, utterly thrown off.
“Nope, no, no.” Sam scowled and clicked around. “Looks like she made this about a month and a half ago.”
She looked way too delighted as she turned to call over her shoulder, “We got a
“Okay, lift it but get a bite in quick, hold the weight with your chin. I want you to dive in there like,” uhh, think of a non-female related simile, “like the goal is to get as much of your face wet. C’mon, open your mouth, yeah, that’s it..”
“No, I was just asking because...I’m not really looking for anyone right now. I’ve got my hands kinda full.” He thought of a mouth that was maybe softer than it looked and lingering stares. “Are you coming to the cook-off?”
Dean chewed on his lower lip as he looked at the last bite of pie. Should he, like, ask Cas out? Did he even have to?
Benny rolled his eyes with a grin. “Okay, yeah.” He ribbed as he hit the button for selection.
“Sure, I’ll pick you up!” She began to clean up his mess as he head out the door. “Any type of food you want?”
“Benny’s driving the van up tomorrow.” Dean had two reasons for coming up early. One, he got to spend some time with his brother before the kid disappeared into some big city and only visited this podunk place every few years. Second, the van smelled like unwashed socks and sweaty balls. The air conditioning had went out during the last half of summer and nobody had enough scratch to fix it, even with Dean working in a garage.
Always.
Waitress winked saucily at him as she jotted down the order.
“Uhh, Mark, he’s the new guy in the garage. Part time, needs a lot of help. Place can’t even run without me.” He fake laughed and quickly stepped around him to catch up with the others.
And glass littering the ground around his feet.
“Mmph,” Dean grumbled around a mouthful.
“Just so you know, there is a good chance their security cameras are two handycams duct-taped in the corner, leading to a VCR.”
Castiel slanted a glance at the lattice, even knowing he could be seen and could not see past it. “The sign of the cross. Have you ever attended Mass before?”
He did go back to fit the pipes in the sink and determined, with a certain sinking feeling, that if the harder-to-reach pipes would need to be replaced as well. That was not a small project, none of this was.
Of course Sam complained the whole time to JJ Burgers about how they didn’t have healthy options on the menu.
Plus, if he played his cards right, maybe Cassie would see how Dean ignored all those drunk and very available girls. Chicks loved being the only one.
Dean decides that the best way to handle everything is to stop thinking about it. This does not work.
“That’s what I want to do,” Cas said quietly as they watched a man demonstrate a prosthetic hand that he controlled with his thoughts. It was still in development, the speaker hastened to say, but the technology was well on its way to being a reality.
His breaths came short and quick, blue eyes never leaving Dean’s. “Is it that destructive?"
“Right.” Cas said slowly, gaze trained on Dean again. It kind of made Dean feel warm again, uncomfortable in an indefinable way. Was he going about this all wrong?
“So what, I’ll stop at a few churches and sweet talk the little old biddies for information.”
Dean usually made a crude joke when he did that to his bandmates, but he found himself just watching. Swallowing and taking a swig out of his beer, he peered around for the glimpse of a familiar face.
. And if he was going to spend the night at Cas's, they weren’t gonna sleep that night.
Castiel looked all around at the wooden walls and the door, then slowly at the lattice again. He placed his palm on the small divider just under the panel.
That was Dean’s mantra as he pulled his guitar out of its case. The location of their second gig was a more mellow place than the Roadhouse. The place was trying to drum up business for their new Music Madness Monday night and Benny shrugged and said it paid okay and had an open tab.
“Is the feeling not mutual?” He sneered, letting his parted lips brush the angel’s jaw. Unsnapping the front of the pants, he slid his hand down to cup the soft, loose skin. “Hmm, thought it’d be smooth. Not a Ken doll, what d’ya know.”
Cas nodded solemnly, head tilting back just slightly, like he did while watching Dean on stage.
“Well...doesn’t the Mayor sign off on it? What strings do you have to pull?” He was genuinely puzzled by this conversation.
“I didn’t mean of me.” He shot back.
“Dean…”
Scan.
“College?”
“Did I hand you the right wrench? I could not measure out the inches, but it was smaller than this one.” Cas turned his head away slightly, touching the eight inch wrench. His mouth moved like he was embarrassed, but did priests get embarrassed?
“Of course I do,” Dean said easily, stuffing his dirty clothes in his bag and checking to see if he’d have to do laundry before he left. He was a dab hand at packing to travel, given their upbringing. He’d been responsible for Sammy and his stuff once he was tall enough to pack on a motel bed.
“Now, the Judges will have final word on who wins the grand prize, but there will be also be winner for Spiciest, Most Colorful, Flavor, and more, so make sure you vote for your favorite! Each scorecard has five categories, please give each a score between 1 and 10.”
“Dean, do you want to order anything else?” Sam asked loudly, cocking a displeased eyebrow at him.
Dean finally got off his knee and hugged Cas tightly, uncaring of the clapping or whistles or a few happy cheers around him. He hooked his chin over Cas’s shoulder and was just happy for a moment.
. They’ve changed their name, we don’t have any recent pictures, just look for the new guy in town. He has a gambling problem too.”
“Cassie?” Roland also looked confused.
Confirming through text Benny would be at the church tomorrow, he didn’t have much going on that night except sleep. And thinking. Sleep it was.
Charlie pretended to listen to her talk about the trauma of losing both her parents at the same time. It went on until the food was all gone and the ice cubes were melting.
He went to meet Benny, Donnie and Scott as they pulled into town. Dean was the lead guitarist of course, Benny on rhythm guitar and vocals, Scott did the electric bass, and Donnie was a beast on the drums.
Benny returned with a huge grin. “Used up all my quarters.”
“Yes,” Dean groaned out, unable to believe that he was balls deep inside of an angel, “I am.” Defiling something pure while looking into the bluest eyes he’d ever seen, he nearly finished right then and there. But he took his time, pulling back and rolling his hips to get a nice even rhythm. It was the first time he’d ever fucked someone when they weren’t crying, that he could
“Yeah, Thursdays and Mondays. Do you want to join? The more the merrier.” Sam said, the big oblivious giant.
“Dean Paxton, Minister.” Dean held man’s hand for a brief pump and dropped his hand. The man had a grip like calloused brick.
Bradford took his seat and greeted Crowley and John like old friends. Charlie brought three bowls for him, explaining which number each belonged to. The festivities continued on while Dean hung by the table just to avoid talk, not to be near Cas, and finished off his bottles.
“I located two people of their description in Lebanon, Kansas. Seems fitting, she said he’s very religious now.”
He watched as Cas opened his mouth and pushed it into the V he already made in the burger with his silverware. His jaw moved as he bit down, lashes fluttering closed. With the clear and colored juices smudged against his chin, Dean had to admit that was lewd and suggestive all at once.
. Should probably do more of that in other areas of his life.
“Thanks, brother. Talk to you soon.” Benny grinned brightly as he left down the street, a lighter step to his walk.
"Sometimes I gotta be obvious. Some people won’t get it otherwise.”
“Excellent. Mr. Hoyt will be dropping off his whiskey samples this afternoon and I promised to run down to Edith’s to price out how much replacing her wiring is going to cost. Just stick around till he gets here.” It seemed prudent to prevent any more cases of exploding bulbs and glass that he had shamefully ran off without helping with. He could claim being distracted, but he would have to further examine what distracted him.
In fact, Charlie hadn’t wanted to become a nurse at all. She wanted to go into computers. Being a nurse was a fulfilling job though, and one of the only choices that Stella accepted.
He washed his hands and splashed water on his face, letting the cool drops run down his neck as he came back into the small room. Cas was still there, surprisingly enough, standing closer by the sofa.
Dean couldn’t handle this.
Both Cas and Sam quickly picked up their beers out of the way, smart boys. Finally they were drinking. If they were both shy, that was going to make this a little trickier. The next round was going to give them liquid courage posthaste.
Dean grabbed out, catching Benny’s arm and clinging for dear life.
“Then why didn’t you say anything?” Dean knew he shouldn’t be exasperated at Cas, but there were a lot of things that shouldn’t be directed at him, so there you go.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean tilted his head at the picture of Cas. With two people hanging off him. At least Cas wasn’t smiling at the camera, looking irritated instead, but the guy had his fingers curled around his waist.
But he never stopped staring at Dean, even when one brave soul darted forward to slash at its cheek.
Normally Dean would go into descriptions of exactly what he pictured her doing on her knees, but he pulled back the reins a little. She was being playful and doe-eyed, figuratively, he had to do tit for tat.
Dean shoved the phone awkwardly in his tightened pants, making wide eyes and an innocent shake of his head. “Uh, yeah. Need any cash?”
Then he eyed the last part of the recent email and pulled out his phone as he packed up and threw away the messy wax paper lining the bottom of the plastic tray.
“Yeah.”
Cassie was a bitch, at least that required no thought.
“Do you have any plans later?” Dean asked as they stepped outside.
Now that Dean knows the extent of Sam's duplicity, he can plot his death accordingly. But first he has events to plan, parish to greet, and one foredained meeting.
Sometimes he didn’t call till eleven and Dean kept him up till at least one, sharing thoughts and...feelings too.
Dean fidgeted, knee bouncing as he thought. So candy was out. “I was thinking of having another community event to introduce myself to a larger number of people. Have you tried a...bake sale?”
That stopped the conversation immediately. Sam looked somewhat horrified but not surprised and Gabe appraised him with a small smile playing on his lips. A smirky douchey smile.
Those blue eyes dropped to the knife as Dean back up, the angel’s fingers curling over the handle and pulling it out. The knife fell with a clatter.
A serial killer confesses several murders to a priest.
“No, there is a wood slot beneath that just for this purpose.” Castiel reached for the small stack of papers next to his other thigh, realizing how badly his fingers were shaking when he almost dropped the whole pile.
Right. Right. Shit, he was telling him how to hit on Sam. “Yeah. I should probably get some water.” His own voice was husky, aching just as much as he was. Cas hesitated then moved off his lap, luckily none the wiser that Dean was hard enough to cut glass. He stood up, turning quickly to make his escape to the kitchenette.
She gave him a look to rival his brother’s best bitchface. Her chest expanded like a fluffed up bird, but then she deflated with a desolation.
Dean licked his lips. “I know what I want. I want you, and...I’ll support you, and when we graduate--I mean, when you graduate, I want to get married. If you want.”
It was silent for so long that Dean was just deciding Cas up and walked away when he got a response.
“Eating…?” Cas cut another baby-sized piece and popped it past his lips using the fork.
The dorms were further than the frat, but it was a good walk. Dean grilled Cas on his choice of music and was satisfied that, with a few exceptions, his taste didn’t completely suck. That was pretty important. For Sam.
“Sir, you can’t be over here.” A kid with acne the size of sunbursts tried to shoo him.
He grinned at her, giving her a squeeze before moving away. “Relax, we’ll encourage moderation and safety. Why don’t you find a reliable sober driver to assist anyone needing it?”
Not Dean. He was more like his father, only wiping enough grease off his hands to grab an ice cold beer on an average day. Yeah. He worked at Bobby’s with his dad, though Dean was the more reliable worker.
Operation
Cas explained his parents might get there late, but they’d get there for sure.
And that bothered Dean. He got up and took a seat right behind them, still smiling. “I’m actually his boyfriend.”
Dean was less generous with this one because he now knew what pain tasted like.
“Why?”
“Mmm,” Cas made a sound that was positively indecent to be making in a public place, his jaw moved slowly with eyes still closed.
Dean cracked his knuckles, thinking of her round butt in those tight pants she wore. Nicest ass he'd ever seen.
OMG almost halfway through guys. I'm excited!
Dean jumped up and grabbed some clothes to get showered. Normally a night after the show was a scene of, if nothing else, empty bottles and some sign of chaos. Everything was pin neat in Sam’s room.
Cas was still sitting in the chair, his expression barely changed. He didn’t look disgusted or anything.
was about to get launched.
When the two boys scampered to the car the door opened again, and the mother in question looked surprised as they grabbed bags and jostled each other as they went through the door she held open.
Roland extended his hand first. “It was great meeting you, Dean. Samuel talks about you all the time.”
“Oh, definitely. My five-alarm chili is a misnomer, it has at least seven.” Gus winked and read him the total.
“Celeste is here for the long haul. She’ll keep fighting no matter how hopeless the cause. But you’re not that type. When the going gets tough, you get going.”
Pleased, Castiel picked up the delicious food and ate the rest of it. When his plate was empty, he swiped his thumb along the surface of the plate. He sucked the ketchup off.
Then he turned off his phone and held his head in his hands. He was really messed up, wasn’t he?
“Shut up.”
“Does it matter why?”
It took a while, the crowd was big and lots of families got to their student first.
“He already spends so much time with a variety of organizations, he’s a good man. He wants to help children and makes lots of lives better.” Dean kinda liked them, but he also wanted them to know what kind of man they were missing out on.
Cas turned his head to look narrowly at him, the light above glinting off his eyes. “I know not to throw water on it."
Sam shrugged. “I wasn’t sure. You kinda act a little weird around him.”
“No dude. If I’m hitting anything this weekend, it’s going to be someone who is nothing like Cassie. And I’ve never seen her crack open a book, let alone hang out in the library.”
It took a minute but the potato was placed in his fingers. Dean shoved it around the broken glass and twisted until the socket came out. “Take this.” He lowered it and waited till his hand was empty before taking off the fixture.
Seriously though, he understood the parallels. Their own mother died when Sammy was just a baby, leaving their retired cop turned private dick father with two boys and one way to support them. It wasn’t an easy life, but Dean couldn’t complain. They helped people.
Wings.
He did end up leaving with caffeine running through his veins and a few extra tools along with the flyers. It was still pretty early, which was perfect. He drove up to the side of town of the furniture store. Sam had sent an address already, cause that man was a genius. Or had easy access to store listings, whatever.
Dean squeezed his hands tightly. “I’m a sure thing for you. If you change your mind, fine. But I…” Damn, the words stuck in his mouth. He tried, he really did. “I need you. I need you.”
It made Dean wonder how long Sam had been seeing him and why did he hide it? Did he think Dean would be mad at him? While he was straight as an arrow himself, nothing wrong with preferring strudel to pie. As long as the baker was good to his little brother, he had no problem with it.
Sliding into the driver’s seat, he checked his phone again. Should he? Well, he was actually into girls. And pretty much only girls. Alcohol and being sexually frustrated was his problem. Hell yeah, he was doing this.
She gasped, turning bright cherry red. She looked at her boyfriend in a panic. “No, no, he’s just an ex, crazy ex..”
Bradford sized him up and down and up again. “Pass it on to Charlie to come see me.”
The man nodded, looking at his wife. “He’s our son’s friend.”
And when it was all over he grinned at Cas’s parents, in such a good mood he was just happy they were here. And Cas would be happy too.
“No. I’m here for you.” The angel spoke for the first time, voice gritty and low. Between that hair and the gravelly voice, maybe he just woke up. Do angels sleep?
Benny didn’t get there until after Dean was working on Sam to have a few beers. “It’s still early! You could stop around eight and be just fine. Plus, pizza.”
Dean licked his lips and stared at the stage as people set it up for the Commencement to come.
Grace lived as close as possible by choice, and Lisa had to live reasonably close since their mother paid for her place.
“Hey man,” Benny slapped hands with Dean as he set down his gear in front of a huge motel called Value Place. “Got the rooms for a steal. You gonna hang here tonight or is your brother’s frat overflowing in young blood?”
“I dunno what any of that means.”
“Umm.” Charlie rubbed the back of her neck and gave him a toothy grin in apology. “We’re not exactly bursting to the rafters. I mean, we’ll get there, but change is slow around these parts.”
"You were texting the wrong person,” Cas said quietly, blue eyes intent on his.
“I’m your family’s friend.” A flash of white as Gabe grinned, completely ignoring the directive.
Cas worked a hand between them, fingers pressed at the top of Dean’s jeans and suddenly half the constriction was gone. Oh, that took some skill. Any thought of protest froze as fingers wrapped around his aching cock. It took everything for Dean to keep his knees from buckling.
“As opposed your five days’ experience of living in town?”
But now that she’s about to graduate, she takes his money and time all summer then drops him like a rock. ‘
It was impossible to imagine him biting into food larger than his mouth, sauce spilling over his chin and hands. Heck, he couldn't imagine Cas lying on a bed panting in abandon. But then he'd have to picture Sam in there and nope nope nope.
Dean flinched, but fingers merely touched the area just around the spot he hit.
Dean pulled his hand off that pretty cock and slapped his face as hard as he could. It reopened the wound on the inside of Cas’s lip and broke the surface, bright red sluiced out the side of his mouth.
Dean left one copy on the counter and sauntered to the board, grabbing an extra tack in the corner. He pinned it next to horseback riding lessons and a teenager by the name of Nicholas offering babysitting services.
“Oh my goodness,” the one with long darker hair sucked in a breath, “you must be Celeste’s new Pastor. I hadn’t though…”
, and that was a little scary.
“Thanks for coming out.” Sam was saying quietly. “I, um, hope you had a nice time.”
He kissed Dean like he was trying to taste every bit of him, mouths slotted together perfectly. At first it was sure strokes and then his tongue was sliding in and out of Dean’s mouth filthy and slow.
“Right, so, usually the usually students of the same Major get together for a team. No Loopholes have all the pre-law students not in a frat. They crushed the year before last with Crowley as their head. Rumor has it he hired outside help to design the machine, Demon Knight. Last year the mechanical engineers outdid themselves. Team Angel created Seraphim and it literally smote King of Demons.”
Crowley looked him up and down with a sneer, straightened out his collar, and walked solidly past Dean to let himself out. Out the tiny window Dean saw him turn sharply once past the fence and disappear out of sight.
One, that enough people watched his televised kiss with Cas that he was recognized on Sam’s campus. Second, that Cas made the world’s best Burnt Sugar Caramel pie in the goddamn world.
“Anyone you got your eye on?” Hey, this was no time for pussy-footing around. Dean only had a few days till he left and he wanted to see Sam happy before then.
He turned, keeping one arm around Cas’s waist firmly, his waist now, and saw Sam grinning happily at him.
“For fuck’s sake,” Scott grumbled as he wiped his face. “You always do that, you know.”
He chuckled against the wet skin. “You’re so damn responsive. Do you like being tied up? I bet you do, you kinky bastard. Need me to slap you around like a bored housewife?”
“Well, I guess, but maybe I should do it. The Father can come off a little scary at first.” She was clearly not on board with the idea at all. He didn’t think Charlie was so easily intimidated if she thought Cas was intimidating. Maybe it was just the position of being a priest.
But nobody never touched his sweet virgin ass? Alastair obviously didn’t teach them. By now Dean’s wires were so crossed that he was hard enough to slice glass, still pressing against Cas’s bare hip every so often to relieve the pressure.
His waist.
Sammy would have been a better fit for this, but he was still tied up in a dogfighting ring bust. It would take an act of God, no pun intended, to pull that bleeding heart from abused animals.
As Benny held the mic to announce the second song, Trapped For a Year, a spot of white caught the corner of his eye. Dean moved to get a better look, surprised to see that guy Sam had been talking to by the library. He was still wearing the hoodie, the front black and pure so no chance of seeing the back. His hair was just as messy as before and the dim lighting barely hid the flash of blue eyes raised toward the stage.
For just a second, the light was beautiful and the sound made him want to weep.
Bela, or Abbie, knocked her elbow into Ruby’s arm to make her let go of Dean. “And what is that?” She pointed at the papers, the ones he nearly forgot about.
“Tomorrow night. That means I have…” Dean checked his watch. “Thirty six hours to drink and sleep and shit.”
A buzz immediately went up like someone punted a bee’s nest. Shit, they thought both were dropping the honorifics because of some religious pissing contest. So Dean pasted on his best smile and held out his hand.
A decent amount of college kids showed up just before seven, saving them from playing to two drunks and a bartender. He’d rocked out nights on like that, but it wasn’t as good as having a little participation.
He jumped up the steps and knocked once. And waited. He knocked again and tried to peer through the white curtains hanging over the tiny rectangle window. “Hello?”
Dean really hadn’t thought of a reason, it usually worked to get people to start drinking every other time. “Um. How about to courage?” He looked pointedly at Sam, who looked confused. Dean took a swig and shook his head. What, did Sam need it spelled out in letters across the sky?
He rolled his eyes and huffed. “Cassie.”
. Look, what do you think I do when you’re not around? I get drunk after gigs, Sam. Grow up.” He looked away from the hurt look, feeling like he kicked a goddamn puppy. Sam came all the way down to watch him play, like a good brother, and Dean was just...just the worst.
Dean felt rather satisfied with the idea, if not the having to wait. Saturday was four days away, but he’d been on longer cases. Maybe he could be out before it was time for him to miserably fail on Sunday.
“All right, all right, I’m sorry. But it was our way in and you were already freaking out. Just find the guy, call it in, and you can be out of there before the Sunday morning service.”
“You’re too goddamn old to be making jokes like that.”
He had a reason for thinking that, a very good reason. Didn’t Cas say he was? He was so damn lost. He shook his head again and pushed past Cas.
And he lied and said he wasn’t arriving until the day of the graduation.
“All right, get to scoring and enjoy!”
“Why? Is it bad luck? For good luck? It is courtesy, customary, or cordiality?”

“Fine! I’ll go introduce myself to your demon friend.”
“I’m, uhhh”, he announces loudly, suddenly pretty desperate to get out of this whole damn building. “I’m going for a walk- a drive. I’m gonna walk to my car. To drive. Okay. Alright.” He drops the book unceremoniously on the floor, grabs his phone, and strides (in a what he deems casual way) out of the library. He relies on autopilot to get him to his wheels, to get the engine going and to pull out of the garage, because his head is still spinning, somewhat. The driver’s seat welcomes him like Cindrella’s damn shoe and once he has his hands on the wheel and can feel the rumbles of the engine under his palms, he forces himself into problem solving mode.
“But?” He prompts, washing the food down with the last of his beer.
“But you didn’t have to tell Eileen!” Dean splutters.
“Come here.” His hand is stretched out, and the intent is clear. Castiel looks a little surprised.
Jack frowns, looking from Crowley to Dean.
Dean shrugs. What? To be good with kids, you have to be a little bit of a kid yourself. Guaranteed to work. He’s a frigging pro at this.
Castiel looks away from the other angel to stare out of the window. He has noticed that humans find it… rude, not to look at the person who is talking to them. Uriel is not a human; still, he has already done a better job than Castiel of… blending in, so to speak. It often feels like every other angel got a memo that Castiel did not.
“Thanks, Jody.”
“You stay out of this”, Dean snaps.
“I thought you weren’t drunk”, Dean says in that quiet voice that alludes to intimacy and tugs at Castiel’s heartstrings.

it’s day 60 in purgatory. making noise could betray him, but he hasn’t heard his own voice in weeks. he’s started to whisper questions to the trees. are you real? do you grow? what did you do to deserve to be put here? the bark feels real enough under his palms.
And Castiel is drunk, delirious, but this isn’t real.
“Who is having more kids?”
green.
“Hey, you’re a good dad.”
Castiel frowns.
“Don’t know if you remember, but Jody and I share a past.”
Jack, who’s been standing silently by Mary’s side, perks up at that. “Dancing?”
“Crowley left.”

Enochian translation: "Some sleepless nights are longer than other".

That is what it had felt like, for Castiel. Like Dean Winchester’s soul had called out to him, and only him. Drawn him in. And he remembers fighting his way towards it in a trance-like state. He is usually so good on the battlefield: in control, in his element. He is a warrior. This was different. And when he… when he…

“I should have brought my own. Oh, wait”, Crowley murmurs, pulling out an extravagant bottle from inside his coat. “I did.”
“Why did you stop?”
“Good one. Wait, are you serious?”
“I think it’s wonderful”, Rowena says, from the opposite end of the table. “But I do think we’re ready for another toast. Jack, dear, did you have anything you wanted to say?”
“Me!” Sam, Rowena and Eileen yelp simultaneously.
settled down.”
it’s day 14 in purgatory. castiel has found a piece of paper in his inner coat pocket. he does his best to keep it clean, but the grime gets everywhere. he rakes his fingers through his hair; pine needles and mud trickle out. his fingertips are covered in dirt.
He glances over at Dean. No, he probably owes her a lot.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah!” She grabs his hand and they start to spin around on the floor. Jody elbows Eileen gently in the side, who nods, and soon they’re joining in - Rowena surprises them by really getting groovy on the makeshift dance floor and Sam is eventually pulled in by his mother, to spin her around too. And hell, Dean isn’t about to be upstaged by his family, so before long he’s joined in too, moves fuelled by endorphins rather than rhythm. He turns around and looks over to Castiel.
“Um, Sam?” Sam turns around, his facial features softening. He puts an arm around her shoulders almost instinctively and pulls her to his side.

he swears.
“Sammy? Nah, he couldn’t care less. It’s just a car, he says. He never got it.” Dean gives him another brilliant smile. “Do you get it, Cas?” And there’s nowhere to go, which is good, it’s fantastic, because there’s nowhere else he’d rather be than trapped between this captivating stranger and his car. Castiel is leaning back against it, carefully, almost holding his breath. The metal is cool against his back.
Castiel gives him another look. Dean is good at all this. There’s a confidence and ease to him that Castiel never really learned how to possess; he often feels like he accidentally missed the how-to-make-friends-at-social-events-class in elementary school, where everyone else learned this skill, and in all the years after that never managed to catch up. Dean probably finds this easy; Castiel loathes him a little.
“Jody Mills?” Crowley interjects. “Now that’ll be interesting indeed.”
Castiel looks utterly confused.
“No, like…” It feels like the final puzzle piece finally finding its place, completing the picture, when Dean leans over to quickly press his mouth to Cas’s, who is already reaching for the nape of his neck with his free hand as he leans over the table. “You”, he says shakily after pulling back a little, but Cas leans back in immediately and when the final picture looks like this, all the years and lost and found puzzle pieces along the way were worth it. “And
“Mom, don’t.”
“When you look at him”, Uriel asks evenly, “what do you see?”
”, Castiel chastises.
“Do you… want more kids?” And Castiel’s hand is reaching out towards him, on top of the table, like he’s about to grab his frigging hand, like they’re married, like they’re parents actually having this conversation and he’s choking up. But he summons all his bravery and nods, because if there’s any chance Cas is in, then he’s in, too. “With me?”

“Feathers! Still kicking, I see.”
“Tradition. I don’t actually have-“ He cuts himself off before he manages to disclose just how much of a loser he really is.

“Yeah.”
“Hm. Interesting.”
“From college.”
“Okay. Sure you’ve got everything covered in here?”

“This seat free?”
“So do half the people here”, Eileen shrugs, looking from Rowena to Sam, and from Crowley to Dean. Dean swivels around to point the knife at Sam.
it’s day 291 in purgatory. if he sticks to the river, at least he can’t get any more lost than he already is. unless the river changes direction, which he’s begun to suspect it does. dean’s prayers have returned in full force and they wash over him like the stream he dips his hands in. purging him. blood and mud dissolving in the water.
“The soldier son of an absent father”, Uriel fills in. “Castiel. You are not his friend.”
“Can you unlock it for me?”

Crowley rolls his eyes.
it’s day 4 in purgatory. the sun never rises, does this realm even have a sun? he’s stuck in perpetual twilight. he spends most of his time running.
“Yeah, yeah, we’ve all been dead”, Dean says dismissively and nods towards the table. “Get seated, you freaks.” Jack, who’s carrying a pitcher full of sauce, tilts his head in a perfect imitation of Castiel, distress written all over his face.
“Fair enough.” He nods towards Castiel’s empty wine glass. “I know you like wine, though.”
Dean nudges him gently with his elbow.
it’s day 565 in purgatory. dean has one foot in the portal and this moment is worse than cas could have ever imagined. it’s torture.
“I will”, Sam says, reaching down for a hug goodbye.
“Fergus!” Rowena chirps. “So glad you could make it, darling!”
“Only my friends call me Cas.”
“A toast”, he starts, and Dean groans. Mary’s hiding a smile behind her hand, Castiel watches Dean amusedly. The gears in Jack’s head are turning, and he’s looking around like he’s missed something. “Toast?” he whispers to Rowena, who holds up her wine glass with a smile and motions for Jack to do the same with his Coke.
“Alright, will you stop?”
“Jesus Christ”, Sam mutters. “But yeah. Thanks, Dean. Sorry to leave you two with the dishes, but I’m heading over to Eileen and I wanted to get there before it gets dark. Sure you don’t mind if I take your car?”
“So let me guess. Grew up religious, a nerd in school probably, massive book geek, doesn’t get out much because you’re always working.”
His body says no. His mind and heart also say no, but maybe they can be persuaded by the still-rational parts of his brain that tell him Dean is probably right.
Castiel buries his face in Dean’s shoulder and Dean pulls him a little closer.

“I could show you, if you want. Got my ‘97 Chevy Impala parked out front. She’s a beauty.”
it’s been 50 days since he first met dean. fifty nights of staring into the woods for hours, waiting for the guy to regain consciousness. benny can appreciate the downtime; it gives him time to contemplate things. such as the emotion that creeps in right before dawn, when he watches the rise and fall of dean’s chest where he lies, unassuming under benny’s coat. the answer is sweet-tasting on the tip of his tongue.
The first rays of sunshine hit his face through the broken windows. Even this early, they’re warm against his cheeks, his eyelids.
“I mean it”, Sam says, voice lowered. “Dean’s really been looking forward to this. You ruin this for him, you’re dead.”
“Right, and she deals with middle schoolers. Yeah, that’s quite a difference.”
“I’m not having any more- oh. Did you overhear me talking about Claire’s text in the library?”
“Good. So do I.”
A few moments later they’re in the car, and Dean’s driving them down the empty street. Castiel texts Charlie and apologises for leaving without saying goodbye. When he adds how Dean’s giving him a ride, Charlie responds with a bunch of crude emojis and winky faces. Castiel puts the phone upside down in his lap and blushes. But it’s not like he can be upset with her.
“No”, a voice from the opposite side of the room says. “As in our son”.
Castiel’s entire body is on fire, but Dean kisses him so, so softly, so sweetly; he can feel his knees weaken and it’s a new sensation. He sags back against the car the moment Dean breaks the kiss to put some space between them. There’s a faint taste of beer on his lips.
“I want to kiss you”, Castiel says. He’s probably never meant anything more. He rests his hands on Dean’s hips, experimentally. It feels right. Dean is very warm under his hands, through two layers of clothing.
“My God. You mean to tell me there’s two of them?” Crowley mutters.
Honestly, the thought of Jack thanking him for anything always feels ludicrous, but Cas has always been insistent; keeps talking about not wanting Jack to act like he was raised in a barn. Barn, bunker, what’s the difference.
it’s day 240 in purgatory. so, dean has something of a reputation. that’s usually how it goes. benny’s a welcome change of pace, though. so is the soaked piece of paper benny finds, halfway buried in the riverbed. the writing is indecipherable, but a puzzled dean sticks it in his jacket pocket for safekeeping anyway.
“Do you have your phone on you?” Dean asks softly. Castiel starts fumbling for it in his pocket, pulls it out, and holds it up. His lockscreen is his work schedule; he cringes a little at it.
“Ah. Yeah. Typically straight people.”
The angel looks up at him, something very gentle in his eyes in the moments before he speaks. “Thank you, Dean. You know, some of it I even learned from you.”
“Sorry!” Eileen says. “I was watching the pots. I promise.”
They’d have movie nights together.
on him. Nah, any kid would be lucky to have Cas as a dad.
With that, Erron left the barn, leaving Dean to work – and he does. Not used to manual labor however, it takes the boy into the afternoon to finish, sometimes with Erron coming to check on it and pointing out where he had missed
"Nah Dean. Get your grimy ass in the shower. And gimme them clothes. I'll get em washed," Erron laughs and took the jacket from the boy.
Erron watched him, curiously. Not saying anything to him. As the boy fell asleep, he thought to himself. Hes not that bad. Hes got some issues, but he really has got potential more than anything. I aint a saint but I think I can help him while he's here. Even if just a little.
The evening turned to night and before Dean knew it he was drifting off in a guest bedroom that Erron had given him. The next morning, as the sun came up – apparently Erron had decided to be up. Of course, Dean could tell by the slamming of cupboards and quiet(ish) cursing coming from the kitchen.
Reluctantly, Dean scraped himself off the kitchen table and took his shirt off. Erron winced, looking at the boy. Putting a hand on his shoulder, Erron paused him. "Did your old man...did he do this?" Dean looked himself over. His back, sides, chest...everywhere littered with bruises, cuts, and welts. Some looked weeks, even years old while others were fresh.
Little did Dean know this was going to be possibly the beginning of a new chapter of the rest of his life.
"About a week," he hiccups. Oh, he's drunk too. Joy. The man bit his lip, thinking about his next step. He could just come back to the store later and drop the kid off at the nearest police station. But that would likely make the boy run again. And with the weather, he wouldn't last another couple days.
This is totally based off - well a lot of things and although I have a whole story planned out for y'all PLEASE LEAVE IDEAS and predictions!!! things are just starting!!!
"Ive never done it." he responded with the least amount of interest in his voice
"I had a spare room and didn't want to see some story about a kid dying from exposure. Even if you tried theivin off me." he responded with a twinge of indifference. As if really, he didn't care if the boy died in the cold. A moment of silence awkwardly passed before he spoke up again
The snow blanketed the ground, falling softly, causing a soft layer to cover the terrain, making a serene view for a passerby. One would say it was peaceful and pretty – from the safety of inside, away from the cold and damp. Rarely did Amarillo, Texas get this much snow in years previous, but this November was different. For some reason mother nature decided to be angry enough to send an unexpected wave of cold winter weather in the early weeks of November.
AUTHORS NOTES: Thank you guys for reading (if you are please leave me some comments. I will warn you there's going to be a time jump soon here with some flashbacks back to the younger years. so you're not dealing with child Dean forever I promise XD.
"alright then. I'll call you thief boy till you gimme a name to give you" Erron smirked. He truly gave no shits.
"Ughhhh" the boy covered his face "My name is Dean." he grumbled,
Dean stared at him, "My name is D-"
Authors Note: Hope you all liked the first taste of this story. I have been working on this for a minute while not being active online and have a story map so I can keep up with biweekly posting (Maybe weekly depending on if I can swing that and work)
Without a word, Dean laid on the couch and stared at the western playing on the screen. Nothing was said. Just like Dean had hoped. Shame ate him up as he watched the movie play in front of him. What Erron said affected him. Although, he didn't believe it – he wanted to. His whole life he was told by the only adult he knew that he was a waste of air – so he believed him. Every damn word of it.
The day ends as they do. Dean eventually came slinking in, covered in horse manure and hay, he slumped down in the seat next to the entry and slouched onto the table, a billow of dust spoofing around him.
Well, the snow is still falling and there is no place for me to go right now. Maybe I could stay a week or so and get out before long. Dean thought to himself, looking at the older man and the house they were sitting in. Honestly it wasn't the brightest thing Deans done but absolutely wasn't the worst. God his head hurt. He shouldn't have drunk himself to sleep all week. Then again, he always did that. Finally, he nodded in agreement, slowly.
A man appeared over the bed, average height and a trench coat, looking curiously – almost confused at the boy, and then disappeared into the night as quickly as he came
"My names Erron, I'm a farmer up here a ways. You got a name, boy?" Erron said, looking over at him.
Please leave comments and ideas for me for this or future works :)
Finally, the boy got close enough to him to carefully slip his small, thin fingers into his pocket and withdrew the wallet inside. Just as he retrieved the wallet and turned to make his run for it, he felt a large hand on his shoulder, forcefully pushing him into the snow underneath him. The man over him held onto him tightly.
"No." he hiccupped as he looked out the window, he didn't know the man, why would he trust someone who has basically kidnapped him? Regardless if it were for his safety.
"I'll only ask you once boy to give that damn wallet back before I get real mean" he said in a low, terrifying voice. He yelped for help almost immediately, causing one passerby to stop and look at the two
"Don't have one." Is all he offers.
Dean learns some hard farm work and Erron learns more about the boy hes taken in.
"Sure, old man." he responded and finished the last of the coffee in his mug.
As the man walked towards the general store, the boy clung to the shadows and followed quietly. His eyes still locked on the wallet in the man's wallet. He knew deep down how wrong what he was doing was, but hunger and the need for shelter outweighed any moral compass he had. The man kept walking down the sidewalk, seemingly oblivious to his surroundings, making him an easier target.
Dean just nodded.
"Well Dean, I aint gonna hurt you or nothin. I'll get you a meal and figure what I'll do with you whenever this storm passes. Until then you can get a warm meal in you and sober up. Maybe you'll be more inclined to get your shit straight" He laughed, putting on some music and navigating the snow covered roads.
"Thanks," he mumbled, still insanely exhausted from the last week. The older man shrugged the thank you off and took a long drink.
"I aint gonna hurt you. If you run, you'll only last another day or two. This cold aint lettin up quite yet" he lifted the kid into his trucked and turned it over to let the warm air hit the freezing child. Once the air is warm and the truck has run for a moment, he starts down the road, towards the exit of town. The drive began silent, the kid just pressed against the heater and muttering a few drunken sentences. Finally, the man broke the almost deafening silence.
"Okay. And why aint you at home with your mom and daddy? Just mad at your folks for not letting you skip class or somethin else?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"C'mon thievin boy. Get in my truck. I'll give you a warm meal and figure out what to do with you from there" he stood and guided him towards the vehicle.
"Because your legs are a bit bowed? That why you walk funny?" Erron asked innocently.
Groggily, Dean made his way to the kitchen, rubbing his eyes. The older man was pouring a mug...no two of coffee and set one in front of the youth
"Yeah" he choked out, looking away from Erron. "He said I wasn't right. I was born wrong and couldn't even grow right. Up here or actually" he motioned to his head, then body. He shifted his weight onto his left leg. His legs hurt. Bad from the day of work he just had. "He..said it was my fault mom died. And that I deserved being born broken" tears stung his eyes. He was broken; therefore he wasn't desirable to anyone's standards as far as Dean understood.
"Dean, yeah I know. And you're a boy aint ya? I mean I aint gonna tell you what you is or isnt but you look like a damn boy" he wheezed, thinking he was the funniest shit around. Dean just rolls his eyes and puts the coat on.
"Where's your folks, boy? Didn't they teach you some decency?" he pocketed his wallet once again and shook his head,
"Something else." Dean replied, still not sure about this Erron man. Erron just nodded and thought for a moment.
"Mornin boy, thought you could use some coffee, so I poured you some" Dean looked into his cup, the liquid looked like mud, and probably was deadly, but, like a champ, Dean lifted the mug to his lips and took a sip. The beverage was bitter but somehow good.
Just behind one of the streets in one of the alleys a man parked his old truck. Judging by the looks of it, he was well enough off. He may have a wallet that might have a card or some cash in it. The door opened and an older man stepped out, fixing his cowboy hat, and pulling his coat tighter. He grabbed a wallet and shoved it in his back pocket. Easy enough.
Dean hardened his gaze, fighting the tears that threatened to make him look weak. He wasn't weak. He was never weak. He couldn't be for him or Sammys sake. Dean nodded and went to shower. Coming out, he found a clean pair of clothes, obviously too big for him, as they were meant to fill out a in shape older man, and put them on before returning to the living room where Erron sat with a whiskey and coke.
The boy tried to pull out of his firm hold and run for it, but the man only holds slightly tighter.
“Sounds great. How’s six?”
And that pissed Dean off. “No, you’re not. He has
Dean shifted while sitting on the lip of the tub, elbows resting on his knees as he typed away. Had to admit, he was getting turned on. He was already turned on earlier at various points of the night, the effects of alcohol and his abstinence of course.
This, this was worth rolling out of bed for. If he went to college here, he’d be here every day with tongue hanging out.
“Then what?” The words were dragged out lowly, a hint of tongue between Cas’ tongue as he spoke.
“You’re not going to throw up in Baby, are you?”
“I’d go for the handle.” There was something uncertain in Cas’s voice.
“Hey! That’s your seat and your beer.”
A louder cheer went up and Edith, who had her own table with cookies, tarts, pies and other items, clapped both hands to her cheeks in pleasure.
“Yeah, I like him fine.” He gave Dean another odd look and held up his phone again. “If you want me to, I will.”
A-ha! Dean looked at his phone, about to call her on her shit when Roland snapped his fingers.
He was going to have to do math too? It
He couldn’t even enjoy his burger as much as normal next to Cas’s quiet intakes of breath and mmm’s that vibrated deep in his throat. Not that he was annoyed, it was just...just…
This one had a lot of red in its sauce so he was hopeful it was tomato sauce. The Big Cross lady brought Cas a small bowl and Dean was so busy paying attention to him he stuck another spoonful in his mouth without thinking.
His band was one of the only bright spots in his life. It gave him hope that he might leave Lebanon too, not with a degree but on tour. He daydreamed about all the different tour names they could use for a band called Purgatory.
“Bless me, Father, for I’m about to sin.”
Dean picked up his phone and stared at the blurry picture of his brother malevolently.
She was being downright playful. That got him buzzing more than the two beers he had before the show, he was grinning at the thought. It was hard to really look in the nooks and crannies of a bar anyway, especially since his attention kept wandering to...wandering away.
Cas did that funny look-everywhere-else eye movement again before nodding. “Thank you.”
He hoped these walls were soundproof, because he’d been shooting in tissues for like two months. Breakups were hard, and so was he.
He left the crumpled paper in case the kid could get out and take another look. Not cause he thought he’d see Jesse there, but it had his and Charlie’s phone number at the bottom.
“Shut up.”
“Become half man, half robot?”
Dean carefully stepped aside to peer closely at the socket. “Old wiring plus wrong wattage can equal...sparks.” He looked over the black clad figure still in the doorway. “Turn off the switch and slice a potato in half and hand it to me.” He dragged a stool toward the middle of the kitchen and held out his hand as he checked out the fixture of one of the broken light bulbs.
“Dude, that’s gross,” Sam complained, staring at Dean’s mouth.
He was leaking freely all over his thigh and smearing hotly against Dean’s shirt, and Dean wanted to pop the throbbing cock in his mouth. But that would be too kind. He’d already been too easy on this angel, no wonder it kept mistaking him for a person.
Dean judged the distance from the door from where he was. Not that he was worried about violence, it was partially habit. He wondered if he was about to be subjected to prejudice or, alternatively, the man saying he didn’t act stereotypical enough.
Should he stay and give Sam a helping hand with the guy lest they end up friends for three years and Sam doesn’t make a move until graduation day again? He kinda deserved that slap.
Gus threw him an amused glance over his shoulder. “I can’t say I do, but if you’re looking for a date we have some nice homegrown boys.”
Now the lady turned to blink at him. If he remembered correctly, her name was Rebecca. “He didn’t tell us he was dating anyone.”
“Not gonna lie, that look is gold. The last time someone looked at me like that, I got laid.” But seriously. How could anyone interested in the guy misinterpret a look like that? Clearly this needed to be the equivalent of spelling it out for Cas to get his message across to his brother. “But okay, let’s go bold. The most obvious move in the world is, if you’re absolutely sure, is just sitting in their lap.”
She shook her head. “That’s a shame. You don’t see good-looking men like that every day.”
Dean ignored them and got two beers from the fridge, both for himself.
Dean nearly jumped when that deep voice spoke so close to his ear. “I find myself concerned people are not pleased to see me.” Of course someone had brought Cas a seat and placed it right on his other side.
Benny laughed and Sam didn’t look amused. What, couldn’t an older brother tease his baby bro about a crush? Especially since Sam wasn’t sealing the deal yet.
He could fuck an angel. That was hot.
The Friendster site was familiar, but the name Trickster wasn’t.
“That’s my job.” He grinned, finally having his hands wrapped around a nice hot mug of precious caffeine. The aroma was everything that he needed in life right now. So caught up in his enamoration, he missed what was being said. “Wait, what?”
He magnanimously offered to be one of the Judges for exposure so long as there were two other well-known people alongside him. She promised to drop off a stack for him if he wouldn’t mind helping to pass them out. Of course he didn’t and he knew the first place he was going to take the flyers.
He had it
Sam looked at the soda in his hand. “This is your last day here, right?”
“Dean!” Sam hissed, looking somewhere between scandalized and embarrassed.
“Don’t be a jerk.”
Rubbing against Cas’s hip again, he whispered. “Be glad I don’t dig a new hole in you to fuck.” He pushed a third finger in, but it didn’t get a reaction this time. Dean waited too long, he had to practically thrust all the way to the knuckles to get a shudder.
Cracking the door open, his heart stuttered to a complete halt at the sight of a drenched priest outside of his door.
“Yes!” Dean all but shouted, sending the other man scurrying off once he put his stuff down. Dean paced and paced and ignored everything until he had the tri-folded paper in his hand proclaiming MONSTER APOCALYPSE 2002. Practically ripping it in his haste, he scanned over the words and words until he found Team Angel.
He squinted at her as he chewed, noting the wicked gleam in her eyes.
“Glasses are in the cupboard next to the sink.”
, Dean. And most law schools like seeing an undergraduate in Liberal Arts, it shows their students are well-rounded. When is the rest of the band coming in?”
“Son of a bitch!”
“Why?” Dean took a deep drink, the burn treating him much better than anything he ate today that wasn’t a cracker.
“Wanna walk with me?” Words he couldn’t stop came tumbling out. “We can talk about more outings for you.”
“What is this? Your boyfriend?” Dean could take ‘em. Dude was tall, but didn’t have the hard-won muscles Dean had from being ass-deep in engines and moving heavy crap around.
? This is a bar, not some high school homecoming bullshit. I drank harder stuff in junior high.”
Which was unusually poetic of him. “These aren't halogen, are they?”
“If they’re not grabbing at you yet, you got to close the distance.” This time he was marginally prepared for how Cas took everything so damn literally and was leaning forward to stop just a centimeter from his mouth, head tilted. It was so close Dean couldn’t lick his own lips without inadvertently touching Cas’ mouth, so he kept his tongue in his mouth despite the urge to wet his dry lips.
As he went to shove his hands in his pockets, it hit something heavy and smooth. Oh, the pilfered bottle. Pulling it out, Dean twisted off the top and offered it to his left side without thinking.
A whole lotta matchmaking going on, but some are more underhanded than others.
Dean nodded. A bit geeky, but he could dig it. “Sounds bitchin’. You guys coming to the Roadhouse tonight?”
He liked it that way; blood had never excited him in life, he
Her mouth moved like she was going to comment, but in the end she merely shrugged.
Gabe was still in Sam’s personal space, boundaries!, and saying something about getting sweaty or whatever and Dean had enough.
Cas plucked them from his palm and carefully smoothed it out of his knee. He was in all black again, with just a band of white along his collar. A reminder why he wasn’t affected by earthy things.
“Thanks, looking forward to my turn on Thursday,” Sam called and looked so dang pleased that Dean made a sucking sound with his tongue against his teeth. It wiped the smile right off Sam’s face, he hated that sound. “Look Dean, this isn’t that type of fraternity. They enacted the Men of Principles program a few years ago and I wouldn’t have joined a fraternity like that anyway.”
Cas eyed him as he nodded, suspiciously.
He came with a choked gasp less than a minute after he began, spurting hotly against his fist and the underside of the steering wheel because he didn’t think he’d need a tissue yet. Hand still moving to wring every last drop out, he groaned and tilted his head back to bounce against the head of the seat.
While Dean was enjoying the attention and the fun everyone was having, Sam was not budging an inch. He even followed Dean in the bathroom like they were going to share lipstick or gossip or something. If he wasn’t so damn sure that once Sam graduated he’d basically never come back home he would have read him the riot act.
“Have an ID?”
Looking at the food and back up, he blinked twice. “It is very good.”
“Dean.” He shook her hand, then Charles. “I met him in the middle of the semester and we really hit it off. I…” He had to girdle his loins here, or whatever the saying was. “I’m moving out here so I can be near him while he gets his PhD.”
“No, you know what, I’ll head to the big church.”
She really had some nerve!
“Yeah,
Dean hadn’t quite finagled himself a personal whole pie, but he did joke with her that there might be only two pie plates offered to the general public.
“You must be our new holy man,” she announced in a quavery voice. Suddenly she was a sweet little old lady who hadn’t just bellowed with the strength of four college boys. “Would you like some cookies?”
,” Dean crooned as he went down the hundredth hill with nothing but flat fields around him. The next high point of the road he saw it in the distance like a mirage brought on by suicidal boredom; buildings, real goddamn buildings. “
Cas tilted his head back, eyes opening. “Like that?”
His phone finally buzzed and while the picture was small on his tiny screen, it looked marvelous and homemade.
“Uhh, great. What night do they play?”
Dean made sure a beer was waiting for Cas when he arrived. it must have surprised him, because he stared at the seat next to Sam with some hesitance.
And look at him.
“I know. I invited my friend though, when I saw him at the library. He really liked the show, so I wanted to show you off. For once.” Sam was holding a glass of clear fizzy liquid and looking much too perky.
Maybe he was just a pessimistic type of guy, but life was pretty fucked up sometimes. Their mother passed away before he could remember more than just a few precious scraps, and Sam none at all. He looked at his brother, to see if he was hearing the words the way Dean meant them.
Dean gave him a crooked smile back. “Nope. I was texting the right one.”
“Did you end up checking out that book on philosophy?” Sam asked.
Dean shrugged. Actually, they were doing great. He never stopped thinking about the guy. Sometimes it was dirty. Okay, it was dirty a lot. Dean listened to that throaty damn voice every day for months.
And that's he ended up in a large event center, walking with Sam and Cas through groups of college students, parents with their kids in wheelchairs or crutches or folded up sleeves.
“You need that extra hotel room?” Benny asked with a knowing air. He was still sharp-eyed for a guy that had two beers and four shots, but then he always could hold his liquor well.
Cas makes another house visit.
Now Sam pulled out his bitchface, crossing his arms and settling back against the sofa with an air of determination.
He rounded the corner of the street and halted so fast he nearly pitched himself ass over feet. Two boys were yelling as they ran around a driveway, one younger and lagging behind. No end to his enthusiasm, though, as he tried to catch up with his ‘army buddy’.
Even though Dean’s beer was half-empty, he raised the bottle. “A toast!"
They nearly barreled into their mother who was trying to carry about thirty grocery bags into the house. She couldn’t reach the handle and tried calling for her boys, but they’re loud and busy. It’s a scene Dean swore he saw in every parking lot of any store in any town.
Dean touched the blade to the bright red line travelling down to his jaw. “That was your first mistake, wasn’t it?” He pressed the tip into the stupid white shirt it was wearing, like it was about to pop into the office or some shit. He sliced all the way down to where he stabbed moments ago.
Nonetheless, he went down to the next house on the street and knocked. So it began, the endless rotation of knock, wait, possible open door and quick chat.
“Also, practice makes perfect,” Dean added cheekily, taking a big bite of his own burger.
Maybe it would end Dean’s pathetic existence. He could only hope.
“I’ll need some tools.” Dean shook his head. At least he knew how to work with his hands. He did frown when she showed him an old paint bucket with a hammer, measuring tape, pliers, and a two wrenches inside.
“They have a Real Lives + Real Engineering Exhibit going on right now.”
Dean wrapped one hand around the back of his neck, glad there were no cameras this time. The kiss was just as thrilling as the first, and he poured gratitude and desire and everything else he failed at putting into words for the past few months.
Cold sweat trickled down Dean’s back, though he didn’t know why he was nervous. He’d faced off with big guys, guys with knives or guns in the course of his lifetime. It didn’t make sense that another man, who resonated calm, should make him stop cold.
“No, that’s not good. It’s okay to be bold when it’s not with
“And,” Gus said decidedly, “if you decide you like it here, it’s not a bad home to have. And, oh, if you’re looking for a little companionship, I know a few people.”
“A diocesan priest receives a salary. I am an Franciscan, so as parochial vicar in a ministry my intended salary is paid but not received by me.”
“I take pictures like that all the time.” He scoffed, turning his head away and taking a seat on the lumpy couch.
“That’s good!” Dean slapped the mess of blood, the mush making a squelching sound beneath his palm. It kinda bothered him that this holy upstart had no reaction. Maybe his ministrations lacked finesse, but it never failed to get a reaction out of a normal soul.
Charlie smiled and rolled her eyes. “He’s heard jokes like that a million times. He owns the diner we went to, Conner’s Diner?”
And when they weren’t talking? Dean was looking forward to hearing his little flip phone ring again.
Castiel pressed his mouth against the neck as the white foam spilled over his fist, then his whole mouth engulfed the top.
But it was either let Sleazy McGrabbyhands go to the gym with his brother or not be alone with Cas at all before he left. Selfishness won out. “I’ll see you after your workout.”
Castiel pinched the bridge of his nose, figuring that he should have known and this extended conversation was his fault. “I’m afraid I can’t give you Absolution.”
Dean slapped his hand and they fist-bumped.
The Reception begins! And ends.
He followed her, relieved that he wasn’t posing as a priest. He’d stepped in one a few times and they were long and complicated and he never knew what was going on. And what was with the incense?
Dean stood up and gestured to his seat, brushing some crumbs off his lap and taking his one and a half beers left. Two may be acceptable to Cas, but it was gonna take at least two to avoid hospitalization.
Dean looked everywhere else, but that seemed to be exacerbating the problem. Without staring at his very masculine features, his body surged at the proximity. It was a damn good thing his jeans hid most of the evidence that some parts of him really liked this. So Dean made himself look right at Cas, willing the difference in gender to become clear to his traitorous body.
A man stood there, clad entirely in black from the round hem around his ankles to the long sleeves that folded at his wrists. Messy black hair and intense blue eyes filled Dean’s vision.
Once he set down the empty bottle everyone was really staring at him. Not just him but Cas, back and forth in suspended anticipation. Feeling as if he just started blaring porn, Dean risked a look at Cas.
Even from half a mile out the town looked like a mix between modern and crumbling. He could see a chapel from all the way out, a pointy white proclamation to Jesus or whatever, and also a gas station that looked as if it had been laid to waste by the Vikings.
“No.” And the response was simple. He could have said it the same if Castiel queried about the weather.
“I'm afraid that I did not agree with their definition of leadership.” With that vague statement his eyes dropped low.
Dean stared at his chili. It was meaty and just a tad bit greasy, not that he was complaining. As a kid grown on restaurant food, he was sure he’d had enough different types of food to not embarrass himself. He just never judged it before.
What the hell, he’d drink with the guy for a bit. Dean hadn’t gotten a text and he didn’t want to do all the chasing. He couldn’t be too available, especially when he gave her all these opportunities to jump him.
“Yes, her. Go open the door for her and report back here immediately.”
Thoughts were hard. Everything was hard. Literally, because he was sure that wasn’t a gun digging into his hip.
“I think he’d like hers. Since I’m busy, can you drop by there and ask her? It’d be a ton of help.”
Dropping his arm casually, Dean turned to face a tall man in his sixties He wasn’t stooped at all, bearing mostly grey hair and keen brown eyes. At least he didn’t look hostile.
The first time Dean saw the Angel of the Lord, he was as bright as the sun and his voice vibrated down to his very bones.
Ah, the ex-con. “Call me Dean. How’re you doing tonight?”
Dean swirled his empty bottle as a young woman came into view, the same mother with two boys he had spoken to earlier. At least she gave him an apologetic look as she waved to the other townsfolk and made her way to the prize table with its tubs of cookie dough. Her boys whooped and made suggestions and helped her carry the dough back to her area.
Charlie brought three of the tiny bowls and set them out. “Remember, set your used spoons aside and take advantage of the snacks in between.”
Dean took a swig when he had the bottle and held it back out. “Right. You can’t just sit back and hope they’ll notice. Some people wouldn’t get a clue if you wrote it on your chest and rubbed their face in it.” He leaned closer, propping his weight against the back of the couch with one arm. “You know what I mean?”
Lisa reached out for help after the police did their usual bang-up job and the case got passed around until Sammy got ahold of it. Sam never refused a mom. Dean never refused a hot mom.
Castiel makes a house call.
He was afraid to wipe his eyes in case a drop of food got on the back of his hands while he coughed. “To drink! I can’t feel my mouth move. Am I even talking? Can anyone hear me?”
Dean lost all good will toward him, grumbling and stuffing several crackers in his mouth.
As an added precaution, Dean made sure to get all his blasphemy out long before he ever reached the Kansas border.
Dean quickly put away his phone before Mr. Fantastic Arms could get ahold of it. Older brother or not, Sam had always held his own pretty well. “Nobody. Is that why you’re here, you cockblocker?”
at me.” Dean roughly shoved Cas’s face away, keeping his hand there to make a sort of shield as he sliced away the pants. They had to be peeled off his thighs, having partially dried in tacky splotches.
(See the end of the chapter for
“C’mon. I just want to feel someone else who’s real. I promise, no clothes will be taken off and I have no weapons. Your hand is as safe as whore in a convent.”
Dean generously waved it off. “I’m just sorry I couldn’t appreciate it the way everyone else did, seems like it’s the best chili in town.” He flashed her one of his waitress-special smiles.
Dean couldn’t say exactly what it was, but heat shot down from his face, straight into his stomach to much lower. Then Cas backed up and opened the backseat door. Dean remained exactly where he was, staring at the lower half of Cas and the white hoodie curled in one arm.
“Yeah.” Dean stared at the pie harder. What was to stop Cas from taking up with someone else? There was still half a semester before graduation, if it followed the same timeline as high school.
In staring at the new couple, he noticed the guys in white had writing along their back, TEAM ANGEL. He searched and searched for Cassie, trying not to look back at his brother still talking in close to Cas, practically in his damn ear.
The older man picked up the paper and scanned it over much the same way he had Dean his first visit. “We have a bulletin board for this kind of thing. Over there.” He pointed at the wall to the left of the entrance that had a number of flyers and scraps of paper.
“You are welcome either way. Edith, have a wonderful day.” Castiel turned, showing that what Dean thought was a skirt actually split at his waist and revealed black trousers.
Dean took a deep breath and sniffed. “Why didn’t they announce yours like that?”
Dean colored up a bit, casting a look at Sam then Cas. The other man was a bit pink around the cheeks; Dean bet those two were playing footsie.
All the anger and frustration and confusion rushed through him, finding a prime target. This was entirely her fault.
Yes, his last assignment was in Las Vegas, and yes, he was looking forward to settling down in Lebanon. Nobody asked about his orientation or dating life, but he could also tell which people found it objectionable. He talked up the contest to everyone regardless.
Clearly?
Even the sound of the name made Dean’s stomach pitch and roil. Not enough to stop eating or anything, but it wasn’t fun. “Naw man, she always texts me if she wants some.”
Dean grinned and followed him up the stairs. “Maybe in that order.”
“Let’s see if you cry or come then, pretty angel.” He bit the long muscle of Cas’s neck until his teeth left indents, swiping his tongue along the salty skin with pinpricks of blood dotting it. He ran his hand over the flagging erection, pumping until it was red-flushed and straining against his palm before he scissored two fingers inside.
Castiel sure was cocky for someone with his arms and legs bound.
“Ahh,” came the breathy laugh. “So I end with the best sins?”
Whatever else he was in life, there were many ways to torture the damned and the righteous, and Dean took his time rubbing his thumb up and down and rubbing the head. He grinned viciously as the angel began to swell, slow at first, then rapidly.
“Sam?” Cas dropped his hands, which had found their way to his waist at some point, and took a step back. He looked so damn puzzled.
“Yes.”
Perhaps that’s why he missed the oddity of the words. He looked at the clover-cross lattice between the confessor and himself, but all he could see were slats.
“Sure.” Or not time on the stakeout. Nobody went to church at 7 am on a Tuesday anyway. He scribbled down the address, glad he kept a small stack of plain cards with his phone number on it. ‘Lady with tools’ he added underneath it and slid it in his back pocket. “Call you after.”
But of course he was winning her over, Dean could charm any lady. And he was working extra hard to win her over. The dad didn’t look upset either, rather mildly amused at his wife’s laughter at Dean.
“Yeah, but don’t be gentle.” He leaned forward to really flash the classic Winchester charm her way. Not out of interest, but you just did that with pretty girls.
The other girl, with short brown curls, subtly nudged her sister as she stood beside her. “Excuse my sister. My name is Bela.”
Dean froze. If he didn’t work fast, he was going to have to climb that podium and stare at seven, maybe eight if Edith showed up, happy shiny faces and talk about the Bible or something. Faking knowledge was not easy.
“It’s okay. Bella, this is my friend, Charlie. Charlie, Bella.” She pointed in proper sequence and smiled apologetically at her friend.
“If you’re looking for a date, my wife knows someone--”
He shifted, angling one leg toward Dean and moving as if to get up, but he didn’t stand.“So,” he said in his low voice, “like this?” His other knee swung around over Dean’s thigh and pressed into the couch on the other side.
Dean stood against the driver’s side, the sunlight and overhanging branches making wavy shadows on his car. It was a peaceful neighborhood, he could walk nearly anywhere simply if he just took out the time. It was like a hundred he’d passed through before.
“But I
When the goodbyes were done and said, Dean mouthed ‘Samuel’? to Sam and got a light punch to the arm.
He steeled himself to reiterate all the arguments he had prepared in his head that nobody else had brought up yet.
It was amazing to think their mother had managed to unstarch her bloomers long enough to get pregnant four times. Thinking about her mother having sex made Charlie want to drink bleach, so she tried to think of literally anything else.
’ hung over the pale green door. They liked their signs here.
She looked over Charlie’s scrubs and tilted her head. “Do you work here too?”
The intruder wasn’t subtle. In fact, he was sitting on the couch.
“I've been incorporating your advice when we go talk to other chapters. Why didn't you ever pledge for Beta Theta Pi?” Sam's hand moved, but didn't even come close to touching Cas.
Castiel looked from the one he already had to the full one.
Jo gave her a blank look. “What? That’s my co-worker’s, she just ran to the bathroom."
He grabbed his phone. “Hey Charlie.”
He took a moment. “Yes, I believe so.”
Heat threatened to suffuse his face again, but Dean battled it off as he picked up a scorecard. “Can’t wait to have some chili,” he said loudly. A soft chuckle was his only response.
“Where do I put my hands?”
It had a tiny arcade system and seats for eating and a huge stage. The sign above the door said...Danny’s? Manny’s?
Sam looked confused.
Before either of them could speak, the ever-present background noise of screams and wet, darker sounds intensified. Black-eyed creatures poured into Dean’s space, moving past him to claw at the angel.
Just as he suspected, the wiring was wrapped in cracking aluminum instead of copper.
“I'll have to check it out, unless you have the last one checked out again.”
Girls were pretty. Girls were soft and curvy and fun to touch. This was entirely different. The weight was solid, the skin scratched a bit, everything about it felt raw and shocking. His doubly traitorous cock throbbed, apparently uncaring that this was just...just...what?
“Ahh. Speaking of which, have you given any thought to what your opening sermon will be Sunday?”
Shame crawled through his veins.
She hit dial on her phone and propped it between ear and shoulder. “Hey, I’m on my way.”
“Did I?” The voice on the other side was most definitely male, a bit jagged and mostly amused. “This is my first time.”
“Oh! I know who you’re talking about! Oh man..” he looks off in a way Dean didn’t like at all. “So brilliant...I know all the engineers are good, but that Seraphim was awe inspiring. That was
Dean grinned for the rest of the day. He didn’t have a computer and while he appreciated Friendster because it led to him meeting Cas, it seemed pretty lame.
Dean smirked at the bitchface thrown his way, but otherwise his brother ignored that too and went back to clicking around on his computer. The plate was halfway empty before It began.
“Like, on a car. I mean. If anyone, uh, blows out...other stuff…” He could feel his cheeks heating up, not sure if he accidentally insulted the whole gay thing.
He nodded as if he lived in houses his whole life, or even just more than one for a handful of years before he could really remember it. “Sounds great.”
Had he came along with a car and rented a new place, hardly anyone would know enough to spread. But...one group in particular would be interested though.
Castiel cast him a dubious glance, but he finished that beer by raising up the butt and not lowering it until he set an empty drink on the bar.
“I’ve ordered it before,” Cas said simply, taking the paper napkin in his fingers, unfolding it, and placing on his lap neatly.
His voice was deeper than Dean would have guessed, great for a bass singer. It practically travelled to his bones, the same way a really good beat did. Dean blinked at him.
Son was one of the more condescending words that always got his hackles up.
“Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. Is that better?”
Cas took him to an Engineer Exhibit for god’s sake.
The man chuckled dryly, his voice a bit slow and old country like molasses. “I don’t have no problem with my daughter, Minister. I’ll defend queers as the day is long, but don’t disrespect me in my shop.”
The oldest had dark brown hair with light blue eyes, well-fed but wiry looking. The youngest sported tender brown eyes and wild curls. Nostalgia tried to creep up, but it was squashed immediately.
“Have you talked to Sam yet?” Benny asked as they were setting up behind a curtain. The other guy was peeking out into the rest of the venue.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean shook his head like out of a fog. A lusty sex-filled fog. “You’re into Sam.”
Dean tried not to smile at the rather pointed tone Cas was throwing his way. He was a little sensitive, wasn’t he? It was good to see him act human. “Ah. Grease fire?”
“Hello, Dean.” Cas said as he took a seat on the firm, red-cushioned chair by the small table. “This is Gabe. Gabe, this is Dean.”
It was easy to find Taylor’s Market, especially since it was right next to a plain square building claiming to be the Town Hall and a shop actually called ‘
The cafe they met at was next to the first hospital Charlie ever worked at.
It was silent. If Castiel couldn’t hear the soft, measured breaths from the holes in the panel between them, he would have thought he was alone.
Bradford raised his eyebrows as Dean entered the store with a stack of yellow flyers. She had done a good job on short notice, it had a central park location, she assured him, and pertinent details such as face painting and other kid activities.
The one with short hair was dressed rough, jeans and a plaid shirt. When he wasn’t speaking to his brothers he sat with crossed arms and the clear look of someone who did not want to be there.
In fact, Dean was thinking about being less irritated with Sam up until the point she announced, “Here it is, home sweet home.”
Then he prompts Sam to invite Cas out again and Sam admits he likes the guy. Pause! There, that. So it’s confirmed on Sam’s side. Then Dean goes with Cas to his dorms and there things got fuzzy. Lots of alcohol and he starts giving advice on how to snag a guy. By being bold.
It wasn’t the first time one of them hit a rough patch and started drinking like they were 21 again. It just required careful maneuvering of the drunk person and possibly some standing outside bathroom stalls while vomit filled the toilet.
A familiar laugh broke into his thoughts. A laugh he had heard many times in the dark and in smoky tiny bars.
He grabbed a few twenties out of his bag, palmed the key and double checked the perimeters. Because he was a paranoid bastard he always sprinkled salt on the sills and entrances so he’d know if someone entered his domain besides him.
Dean tore down the side steps, making his way down the tiny hall through two doors looking everywhere in the crowd for Sam. Sam, Sam could explain this. All Dean could think was what the fuck had he even texted ‘Cassie’ over the last week? He told him he wanted to see him shirtless, that his mouth was...oh shit, he said he wanted to bend him over.
“The library.”
Both waited until a shiny white Lexus passed by to the huge parking lot across the street before sighing in relief.
The crazy cowlicks were a mess, he had more stubble than two days ago, and his eyes were amazing.
“Ah. I’m afraid our Daily Mass has already ended.” They both had that staring thing down pat, but Castiel wasn’t quite so...judgmental seeming. Also, he must be the only person in town who didn’t know who Dean was. But then there had to some townspeople who didn’t attend church.
“It’s dull back here. Let’s get out there, let the fans buy me some drinks!”
He considered this for several moments before nodding.
“It’s a really nice place, Heddy offered to board you because she has a granny annexe.”
That was his favorite mantra.
“Hmm,” he came off the finger with a wet pop. “Self defense.”
Yeah they talked on the phone every day, about stupid stuff and important stuff alike. Dean knew about cars and Cas knew friggin’ everything under the sun, so time flew when they were talking.
’ and ‘
Alastair had made sure that Dean’s education was
“Because you’re a friggin’ saint and you took three years to ask out that poor girl.”
Their little brother hadn’t cared either way. He never had to worry about family drama, he was the baby of the family. Stella’s second chance at a son.
Roseview was an understatement, there was every shade of red, pink, white and yellow blossoms surrounding the place like there was a sleeping princess inside. He followed her with some dread as they walked up the worn cement steps and she pulled out a key to unlock the sturdy wood door.
The other was not nearly as earnest as the boy, but at least he listened, smiling in some places and wondering attention at others. The attitude of this penitent fit the longer haired man more.
But the voice, the hoarse and masculine voice, that made him think of the unimpressed male with the strong jaw and air of restless energy.
He moved his hands on Dean’s shoulders, the heel of each palm resting on his chest. It was light, almost tentative, not the attitude he should have while on a guy’s lap.
“Hey Pastor,” the man took the few steps two at a time and stopped with a calloused hand held out. “My name’s Benny Lafitte.”
“Her birthday is October 9th, right?”
Cas nodded thoughtfully as he took a much longer drink of his bottle. “I think I’ll order us another round.”
He was eating a quarter piece happily in Cas’s small dorm.
But it is sweet. Frustrating as all fuck, but sweet.
Can turned to look over his shoulder, blue eyes clear as ever even though he was clearly a lightweight. “I’m fine, Dean.”
, so stop flirting.”
“I’ve done you one better; I got you a job at the main church there. So brush up on that fucked up book, you’ll need it.”
Not that Dean expected him to. Cas was an actual holy man, one of the ones that weren’t even allowed to touch themselves, he was sure. But Cas showed no signs of embarrassment and won fair and square because Dean sat back first.
Bradford didn’t say another word as Dean walked out, but he could feel the stare on the back of his neck as he went left instead of right.
“Do you want to get in the front?” Cas finally asked.
“Get out or you’ll be sweet-talking my boots, Mayor McCheese.” Dean jiggled his work boot by the heel and jerked his thumb toward the door.
“You know what, maybe I should walk you home.” Dean considered as they turned down another barely lit street.
She smiled tentatively at Cas. “What about you, Father?”
Dean couldn’t believe she was two-timing him! Playing a little grab ass while he waited on the other side of the phone like a dumbass. “You sent me a picture of your
“Damn right,” Dean bristled. He wasn’t gonna let anyone even look cross-eyed at his brother. To be fair, Benny had never been that guy to make fun of another person for who they liked based on gender or threw around slurs. Maybe he should calm it down a touch. “Sorry man, this is just new to me. I’m trying to, you know, wave the rainbow flag or something.”
That still meant Dean was liplocking with someone Sam had already established a claim over. That still made Dean a pretty shitty big brother. Sex-tousled hair and a shiver-inducing voice should not have had any impact on the immutable, irrefutable rule that one didn’t steal another guy’s...guy.
, but fuck if it didn’t know. “I know what I look like. Don’t you dare think,” he grabbed Cas’s jaw and made him look at him while the hot agony filled his sockets, “that I won’t hurt you. It gets me off.”
Castiel looked between them with a beer held loosely between his fingers, uncertainty written all over his face.
“Hey Gabe, why don’t we go workout?” Sam abruptly broke in, giving his brother a sympathetic look.
“Grab me some beer!” He called to Scott after he got changed in the back, specifically pulling on a dark green shirt that wouldn’t show his chest no matter how much water got poured on it.
He typed with one hand as he snapped the button open on his jeans, breathing a sigh in relief as soon as the constriction was gone. He shut his eyes tightly, trying to picture all the times he’d had one hand on Cassie’s back while moving inside her. But a less waspish waist kept popping up in his head, toned shoulders with skin just shy of pale all stretched out in front of him.
