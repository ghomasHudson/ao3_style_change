"Oh, thank you dear."  Kate's fingers moved in a last flurry of rapid typing before she moved the mouse and clicked to save the document.  "I'll let that sit for a bit.  You ready to check out?"
"Yep!" Molly replied brightly.  "Billy, here, has apparently never been to a rodeo before.  Since the boss is having us report in shifts, I offered to show him around until we have to get back."  She gave Sherlock a flirtatious look, which he ignored.
"That's still not doing much to prove John Watson's innocence," Donovan pointed out, with the tone of one familiar with playing the devil's advocate.  "Especially in light of what I found out the other day."
"Yes," Sherlock agreed reluctantly, sitting up and rotating his neck until it popped.  He helped John fold the blanket back up before following John back to the truck, feeling somewhere between relieved and disappointed with how the evening had abruptly ended.
"Oh um...well," Molly bit her lip.  "I know he got around a lot...he was, well, a bit of a stargazer," she said meaningfully.  At Sherlock's blank look Molly's blinked and tilted her head, her expression implying that surely Sherlock knew what she was describing.  "He had quite a lot of sex," she clarified after a moment.  "He would occasionally joke about buying his own village in Africa and having four wives and a ranch of his own...but that's probably not what you're asking."
"So...I guess you do like what you see," John observed aloud, looking up with a pleased expression on his face.
“Watson’s father was in the service, same as LeDoux’s, though Army I think, not Air Force,” Authur began, his forehead wrinkling in concentration as he thought.  “Not that the specifics really matter.  The important thing is that both families both moved around a lot, an’ both boys spent time learning how to ride horses during visits to their grandparents between deployments.  Watson’s mother was a Hardwicke before she got married, you see.  Well, you probably don’t, seeing as you admitted t’ bein’ a rodeo greenhorn.  Anyhoo, when he was still knee-high to a grasshopper, Watson would be out there every summer with his grandpa, Ed, learning how to handle horses and cattle on the family homestead.  Back when it was still around, at least.”
"Well, for starters gay rodeos...really aren't his scene.  Plus, I seem to remember Ned being more of a cattleman than a horseman, that's all."
Sherlock allowed his eyes to drift over the rider’s mount, taking in the horse’s conformation and then extending out to the other equines in the arena. American Quarter Horses dominated—not surprising since they were the horse breed with the best sprinting capabilities.  Thoroughbreds and Arabians were vaunted for their high speeds over distances, but in competitions that lasted in seconds, the ability of a rider’s mount to take off running, like a cheetah in pursuit of prey, was far more valuable.
Oblivious to the emotional turmoil he was spreading, the announcer continued chattering about the upcoming competitors.  “MEANWHILE, AT FIVE YEARS OLD, SPECKLED BAND IS PRETTY YOUNG FOR A BUCKIN’ HORSE, BUT HE IS RATTLESNAKE FAST AND HAS THE TEMPERMENT TO MATCH.  THIS SHOULD BE A GOOD MATCH!!!!”
Keeping his movements steady, Sherlock climbed the rails and dropped down into the pen, landing lightly on the balls of his feet and taking several several swift strides towards the center until he was roughly twenty feet away, then halted.
With a huff of annoyance, Donovan acquiesced.  Her brown eyes narrowed as she skimmed through the letters, her features set in an expression of suspicion.  Setting the letters aside, Donovan focused her attention on the list of names.  After a moment, she put the list down to give Sherlock a skeptical look.  "So you're...what?  Theorizing that instead of Candii Ross trying to murder her horse and collect the insurance money, somebody else hired Sterndale to sabotage Candii Ross's horse to steal her spot as an elite stock contractor?"
They drove in silence for several more minutes with Molly shooting him sideline glances before she spoke again.  When she did, her tone was hesitant.  "About that...I know you're the expert, but what, exactly, do you do to rehabilitate the horses you're hired to help?  And what are you planning on doing to Blaze?"
"Mmmmm hmmmm," John nodded, giving Sherlock's ear a final nip.  He shifted and began pressing kisses down Sherlock's jawline while his left hand crept higher up Sherlock's thigh until his index finger was just grazing the denim covering Sherlock's throbbing cock.  "I could…mmm…help you with that, if you'd like?"
"Hooper, Scott, good of ya to join us," Candii Ross greeted them brusquely when Sherlock and Molly hurried up and joined the rest of the crowd standing in the car park a few moments later.
"True," Molly replied, relenting, her expression visibly softening.  She paused, obviously trying to decide how to phrase her next question, her fingers drumming on the steering wheel in a nervous tempo.  "I know Ms. Ross hired you and all...but I was curious, so I looked you up online.  I found your website…'The Science of Equine Deduction' I think it was?"  At Sherlock's nod, Molly swallowed once, before continuing.  "It's pretty basic...just your contact information, a few photos of some very pretty horses, and something about how you deduce a horse and correct behavioral issues accordingly.  No client testimonials or anything.  Why's that?"
John took a sip of his bourbon and shook his head.  "For a normal horse, sure.  But, well, those horses are trained not to—they have to be, else the pickup men couldn't do their jobs.  It's dangerous enough without having to worry about a panicking horse.  Move out of the way, sure, but not rearing.  That's an easy way to get yourself disemboweled.  I had a case involving just that situation a couple of months ago."
The purple-haired medic approached.  "Sir," they began, their tone polite, yet firm.  "I can see you’re worried about your friend.  I’m here to help.  Can you tell me what happened?"
Still blinking, Sherlock began to absently catalogue the faint, mingled smells of sweat and semen that surrounded the two of them.  Last night, he’d been too absorbed in the touch, the taste, the scent, the overwhelming sensation of being enveloped in John to appreciate his surroundings, but now, with the room at least partially visible, Sherlock began to study John’s bedroom.
The sun had continued to climb in the sky as they walked, its rays bringing the ambient temperature to something more appropriate to the Sahara.  It was annoying, yes, but Sherlock was well-used to ignoring his transport’s discomfort in favor of the Work.  Far more bothersome were the periodic interruptions by John to inquire after his health.  How was he supposed to coalesce disparate pieces of information together into a logical conclusion when John kept nattering on about whether or not ‘Billy’ was feeling thirsty or overheated, or sunburned?  He’d eventually sunk even deeper into his mind palace, relying on automatic responses and noncommittal noises to answer John’s inquiries and utilizing the spatial navigation skills he’d developed by traversing crowded livery yards since childhood to dodge the increasingly dense crowd.
Molly bit her lower lip as she met his gaze.  Her own smile was hesitant.  "I was hoping I'd recognize you from Ms. Ross's description...she said she’d seen you before and that I should keep my eyes out for someone tall, dark and handsome…"  Sherlock raised an eyebrow and Molly flushed, swallowing hard.  "Ummm…sorry...nevermind," she stammered.  "I am so, so sorry I was late.  Let me help you get your bags loaded?"
Smiling, Sherlock reached out and took ahold of the dog's blue nylon collar, turning it so he could read the tag. 'Bonnie' it read.  Unoriginal to the extreme, but at least not as plebian as the name  'Lassie.'  Sherlock suppressed a grimace at the memory.  Mrs. Hudson had made him watch the movie with her once as a punishment for leaving a pair of his riding boots in the foyer for her to trip over and almost fall.  Sherlock had learned to take more care with his clutter, (at least as far as entrances and egresses were concerned), but the annoying bit of trivia refused to be deleted, taking up valuable space on his mental hard drive.
Sherlock laughed softly, making sure to sweep his eyelashes down in an unmistakably flirtatious gesture.  "Oh yeah.  Lots."
"Was it now?" John asked, the tense line of his shoulders relaxing.  He smirked in response to Sherlock's enthusiastic nod and began slowly running his hands up and down Sherlock's thighs in a firm caress, his thumbs inching teasingly closer to Sherlock's groin.  "In that case, is there anything...special you want to try?"
"Oh yes, you do like that, don't you," John whispered, satisfaction replete in his tone. "I bet I know what else you like?  I've seen you watching my mouth."  He backed down the bed and lowered his head again not close enough enough to touch, but close enough that Sherlock could feel the warm puffs of John's breath against the sensitized skin of his shaft.  "I bet you're just dying to find out how my lips would feel wrapped around your cock, aren't you?"
"Has he now?" Donovan murmured, shooting a look at Lestrade as she wrote down Doctor Früh's comment.
Sherlock shivered, both in relief that John wasn't repulsed and at the contrasting sensations caused by the rough rasp of John's callused hands over his own, overheated, sweat-slicked skin.  "John?" Sherlock asked, his voice embarrassingly shaky.
"Indeed," Mycroft interrupted, his face contorting into a microscopic wince at the apparent imagery invoked.  He shifted in the chair, the fabric of his trousers rustling as he crossed his legs defensively.  "Your case notes on the matter were…extensive…Was it really necessary to run the experiments with the sausages?"
He took a seat and leaned back against the tree trunk with a huff.  Bonnie welcomed his presence with a lazy wag of her tail and the canine equivalent of a grin.  Sherlock felt his lips quirk in an involuntary smile as he automatically reached over to rub the collie's ears.  It wasn't quite as soothing as playing his violin, but his violin wasn't here and Bonnie was.  The dog responded with a happy growl.  Bonnie’s non-judgemental company and unabashed joy in his touch was something of a mental and physical balm Sherlock mused as he gently worked a sand burr free of the silky hair.  Especially after the hours he’d spent struggling with Devil’s Blaze.  As if sensing Sherlock’s scrutiny, Devil’s Blaze raised his head and flehemed, no doubt honing in on the traces of Sherlock’s scent and his corresponding location based on the direction of the wind.
"I am," Sherlock snapped quickly, adhering to his cover story.  "But I had little enough interest in socializing in bars at home and even fewer opportunities to do so."
"Do you like it when I tease you?  Do you like it soft, or just a little bit rough?" John asked, him, his voice rough with arousal.  "Do you imagine my teeth here?" John continued, lowering his head so his teeth were just above Sherlock's right nipple.  "I bet you do.  Shhhh...Let me try an experiment…I'll be gentle…"
might not know anything about fashion labels or designers, but Sherlock hadn't missed the flash of recognition in the shopkeeper's eyes when they'd lit on the logo of the five-hundred quid Tom Ford, Western-style shirt in dark blue cotton plaid that Sherlock had elected to wear for the sole reason that its colours matched the many hues contained within John's eyes.
John blew out a breath, visibly getting a grip on his temper.  "Sorry," he apologized.  "That was uncalled for."
"Oh, please John…" Sherlock moaned, his head thrashing against the pillow as he imagined John's cheeks hollowing as he sucked hard.  He could feel the tingles from his groin radiating out and filling his body with jittery, prickly warmth.
"Of course she is," Sherlock replied with a sneer.  "Mycroft, I don't do boring clients.  I prefer cases with a something of a challenge.  Nothing you have told me thus far justifies a trip to a place that doesn't even have ubiquitous internet access.  If Ms. Ross is that concerned about her business, she'd be better off hiring a solicitor or a barrister to address the issue."
Molly shook her head.  "I grew up in Oklahoma.  On a cattle ranch.  With cows.  Um…not really with the cows.  I mean I grew up in a house...well, trailer actually.  Original country girl from the middle of nowhere, that's me."  She gave a self-conscious laugh, a flush darkening her fair skin.
Sherlock's mood had still not improved two days later.  His mental Mycroft had (unfortunately) been right.  The beer he'd consumed so liberally had
“With the blow job?  Nope.  But if we stay here on the floor, we’re going to hate ourselves in about an hour.”
Her jewelry was minimal, but expensive.  A thin gold chain hung around her neck, ornamented with a small gold cross.  A large diamond was inset in the cross's center, which echoed the large diamond studs Candii wore in her ears. The nails on the hand holding the pen were unvarnished and clipped short; a practical decision for a woman whose overall physique indicated that she still performed arduous physical labor on a daily basis.  A hat stand stood on the floor behind her, holding cowboy hats of different colors: black, cream and tan.
"Oh!  Um…well, I could, er, wipe off the worst of it with a towel," John began, "and then I could spray your back off and hopefully avoid getting your jeans too wet?"
"Here," Donovan said, helpfully turned the computer's screen so that Sherlock could see the web page.  "I don't know if she was actually there last night," Donovan continued, "or if somebody simply forwarded her the photos, but she's promising another exposé piece about how rodeos abuse horses.  Nevermind that this was a case of somebody attacking a police horse, it makes for excellent clickbait press."
Leaving the familiar territory of his mind place behind, Sherlock opened his eyes and tilted his head back to stare at the ceiling in exhausted irritation.  His problem, Sherlock realized with a snort of frustration, was that he had too much data and not enough information.  Mycroft had supplied him with the necessary facts, but his actual investigation would have to wait until he could interview the suspects and examine things for himself.  Photographs and record transcripts were useful, but insufficient for discerning underlying motivations.
"Fascinating.  So, do you play?" Sherlock asked, despite already knowing the answer.  While John's hands bore many calluses, the ones on his fingertips weren't the ones that a violinist earned from an instrument's strings.
He caught Sherlock’s eye and they stared intently at each other for a long moment before dissolving into laughter, John’s helpless, high-pitched giggles offsetting the deeper tone of Sherlock’s chuckles.
Mummy, however, loved his curly hair and had insisted on her youngest child wearing his hair long, "Because, my darling, sweet little boy, you look just like a William Adolphe Bouguereau cherub with your adorable curls!  Or maybe Little Lord Fauntleroy!"  Mummy's obsession with sausage curls—despite Sherlock's own, well-documented propensity for exploring and getting dirty—had resulted in countless screaming fits and tears as Sherlock's scalp was subjected to the painful ministrations of impatient, heavy-handed nannies armed with stiff brushes, hard combs and greasy oils.
“I thought you dragged me in here because of the case, not to give me one of the best damn orgasms I’ve had in a long time.”
"A gift for my obnoxious, overbearing brother," Sherlock replied, grabbing John's wallet and helping himself to the contents, despite the shorter man's splutters of protest.  "I'll pay you back," Sherlock promised, returning John's wallet to the back pocket of his jeans, "but if I use my card, my brother will know, which will utterly ruin the surprise."
"On occasion yes, but I don't enjoy it.  It's a tool of last resort," Sherlock said brusquely, signaling an end to the conversation as he shoved open the barn door and strode towards the tack room located at the end of the barn.  He shoved that door open as well, earning a squeak from Molly who was inside, hanging up her saddle.
Sherlock turned away from watching the photographic tableau only to raise an eyebrow in horrified disbelief.  The food trailers that Molly was eyeing with unmistakable interest were covered with lurid photographs advertising a variety of improbable fried foodstuffs.  There were pictures of deep-fried cheese toasties and giant battered sausages on sticks.  There were fried hard boiled eggs, (which bore more than a passing resemblance to Scotch eggs), fried cheese curds, prairie oysters (which made absolutely no sense, since prairies, by definition were landlocked plains without a large body of water in sight) and something called a 'Cheezy Gringo'.  Based on the picture, it consisted of an enormous fried baked potato topped with macaroni cheese, bacon bits and an impressive amount of soured cream.
The sun streaming through the windows of the concourse was unpleasantly hot, despite the tinted glass, adding to Sherlock's overall misery.  The landscape outside the windows was a bleak sprawl of utilitarian hangars and grey concrete overlooking fields of dead, brown grass.  Here and there were patches of bright green where an irrigation system had obviously been put to good use.  One and two-story World War II-era brick buildings, several with weathered plywood boards covering the windows, could be seen in the distance.  Their run-down appearance presented a jarring contrast to the sleek modernity of the airport's new multi-story parking garage.  Even the sky looked unappealing compared to the comfort of London's cool, damp weather.  It was a brassy-looking cloudless blue that threatened sunburns to any fair-skinned individual braving the outdoors.
Sherlock nodded, though it was more out of encouragement for Harry to continue than any real agreement on Sherlock’s part.  “What happened next?”
"It's like that—only instead of two cue balls, we only use one, and we're shooting to one hundred and one points, not thirty-eight.  Pocketed balls are immediately respotted back to their starting position...like so."  John removed the 1 ball, the 3 ball and the 5 ball from the tray and placed them at the head spot, foot spot, and center spot, respectively.  The rest of the tray was relegated to their table.  "It starts ball-in-hand, with the ball in the kitchen" John continued, setting the cue ball down behind the table's head string.  "Players have to contact the three ball first.  You get points for caroming and pocketing balls."
"Nick, gaol...prison...jail...lockup...penitentiary...whatever the word is," Sherlock explained, gesturing with the tumbler he held in his right hand.  The liquid inside sloshed dangerously, but didn't spill over the rim.  Frowning, Sherlock finished it and signaled the waitress for another round.
"The symptoms sound remarkably similar to what happened to Ms. Ross's horse," Sherlock interrupted.  "I need information, John—preferably first-hand knowledge.  It might be the key to figuring out what's wrong with Devil's Blaze."
Sherlock brushed the straw aside and used one of the scalpels to carefully peel the item up from the puddle of mostly-evaporated urine that had helped adhere it to the floor so he could it up with a pair of tweezers.  He held the item up to the light to better see and his eyes narrowed in contemplation.
"Doctor Watson!" A whipcord-thin young man ran up to take of the bright yellow toolbox that John pulled out.  "Captain Lestrade sent me to watch for you.  Stall nineteen. We've got the lassos ready.  Hurry.  It's bad.  The horse has already broken one of the gate hinges!"
When John returned, he pressed a glass of white wine into Sherlock's hand.  "Here.  Did you spot Molly?"
After he'd finished doctoring his feet, Sherlock spent a moment investigating the closet, confirming that contained the promised spare towels, as well as extra rolls of paper for the loo, before opening the remaining door which led to the cabin's single bedroom.  Leaning against the doorframe, Sherlock surveyed the space contained within dispassionately.
Sherlock blinked, letting his apprehensions evaporate in the face of John's apparent enthusiasm for the idea.  "Fine," he agreed reluctantly.
Sherlock decided, letting his mind drift.  A little rest to catch his breath and let Devil’s Blaze calm down a bit would help him return his brain to peak operating efficiency.
"Put your hands in my hair and watch," John eventually ordered, pulling off of Sherlock with an audible pop, his voice rough with passion and need.
“Better,” Sherlock acknowledged as he leaned forward again, lips engulfing John in smooth heat as his tongue worked along the vein on the underside of John’s shaft. He adjusted his left hand so that he could ghost his thumb lightly over John’s testicles while still keeping the condom situated. Sherlock leaned forward, inhaling deeply. This close, John smelled even more enticing than usual. The vet's usual leather-and-spice scent was overlaid with the musk of arousal. Sherlock growled in pleasure as he took John's cock deeper and buried his nose in the cinnamon-coloured curls framing John’s crotch.
"I don't," Candi replied with another grimace.  "I've always been above-board...but even then, I know I've made some enemies over the years...other stock contractors that didn't get a gig...my ex-husbands because I was smart enough to demand a prenup.  I suspect that damn Kitty Riley is behind this, though, or at least workin' at the behest of somebody else.  She's been a thorn in my side for years, and those damn photos she posted sure as hell were given to her by
But what could Brenda be trying to hide?  And why was she so insistent on finding out if somebody else was to blame for Cream Soda's death?
.  Who knew that such an ordinary muscle could be capable of invoking such sensations?  Sherlock wondered as John's tongue tangled with his own in a slow, slick slide that reminded him of dancing—the give and take, the leader and the follower...the hunter and the hunted...
"No!  Not at all!" John said hurriedly.  "Sorry, you just surprised me, Billy.  Your feet are like ice."
The very real possibility of a rider being killed by an out-of-control bull had redefined another facet of the rodeo industry, the role of the rodeo clown.  In the beginning, they'd been hired to keep the paying audience amused between events.  After the introduction of the Brahma bull, however, they'd evolved from a simple crowd entertainer into a trained athlete that was more accurately described as a bullfighter (except unlike bulls in Spain, rodeo bulls lived; they were simply chased away from the injured rider on the ground).
The worst part was the gelding's ominously blood-shot eyes.  They had the blind, panicked look that Sherlock had only seen in the most abused or feral of animals.  To the untrained, an aggressive horse and a frightened horse might look the same, but to Sherlock, it was clear that New Scotland Yard's behavior stemmed from pure, unadulterated terror, not anger.  Scotty was so frightened, he wasn't even registering the humans trying to help and since he couldn't flee, he was utterly focused on self defense.  His hooves were striking out at shadows and humans alike as though they were attacking him.
Sherlock made it through another half-dozen songs before the heat and dehydration began to catch up and he stumbled involuntarily, almost knocking John over.
Sherlock ran his tongue over his teeth, privately appreciating the way the worn fabric of John's jeans stretched over the man's undeniably excellent arse as John pulled the rack back to its final position and lifted it away.  Almost meditatively, Sherlock began tracing his fingers over the pool cue he held in his right hand.  The size and heft and smooth slickness of the stick in his palm invoked the association of something else...especially when combined with the visual of John bending over the pool table.  It was hard to accurately estimate the size of John's penis without a visual, but the press of John's erection through two layers of denim had certainly been promising...John was certainly the right height to...
"Are you almost done?" John's irritated voice called out yet again from the other side of the plastic shower curtain serving as a door for the changing room.  Sherlock could easily imagine the way John's lips would be downturned and the way he would be folding his arms, his entire posture radiating ire as he awaited Sherlock's response.
nice," Molly scolded, yanking Sherlock's pillow away and glaring down at him with all the menace of a kitten.  Cute and harmless-looking until antagonized, at which point painful, razor-sharp, pointy bits came into play.  "It's hardly my fault you got shmammered last night."
"Mmmm…" John rumbled in agreement, scraping his teeth along the ridge of Sherlock's collarbone and setting off trails of sparks behind Sherlock's eyes.  The phone fell silent as the call was routed to voicemail, but it almost immediately began ringing again, cutting through the mood like a metaphorical WWII Carter Gents air-raid siren.
"So what can I get you tonight, John?  'The Satisfier'? The 'Spicy Enticer' with black beans?  Maybe the 'Stimulator'?" The exaggerated emphasis the barista placed on the second consonant adding a sensual lisp to her words.  "Or how 'bout an 'Edward Caesarhands' with falafel?"
"Mmmppppfh!" Sherlock agreed, concentrating on heat and texture of John's lips.  John kissed with a single-minded focus and enthusiasm that made resistance pointless.  Close-mouthed kissing, by all rights, should be boring, (though far less unsanitary), but like John himself, it was anything but.  John kept tilting his head to different sides, varying the pressure he applied to Sherlock's mouth in a seductive tease that made Sherlock want to chase him for more heat, more pressure, more tongue.
“You know, there’s this belief that couples should kiss at the stroke of midnight and if you don’t, you’ll have a year of loneliness,” John tipped back his head and laughed, “Remember how many people thought we were a couple?”  His smile was gone now, “Remember how alone we were?”
Quickly, he looked up Ethiopian cuisine, clicking the first link, a Wikipedia article. Finally he found what he was searching for near the bottom.  “A gursha is an act of friendship or love.”  He nearly groaned as he read over the words, giving a quick glance up at Sherlock, whose gaze had landed on him now.  His sharp eyes unblinking as he studied John.  He hadn’t figured out just what John was looking at yet and it was now or never.
“Yes, you say it quite often.  It’s hard for me to forget,” he gave a small smile.  He took the bill when it arrived with the desserts and slipped in his credit card, handing it back.  After getting it back and signing the receipt, the two finally got up, leaving the restaurant behind.
Sherlock looked ready to continue arguing but John kept his gaze steady and he gave, rotating the fork toward him and viciously stabbing away at the eggs.  But at least he was eating and John felt a smugness settle over him as Sherlock chewed away at the eggs like a grumpy five year old, the newspaper still clutched in his other hand.  Together they sat, munching on their own food just like old times and for a while it was enough.
Instead of responding, the younger man turned around and walked back to the kitchen, where he quietly settled back into his experiment.  When dinner time came around, Sherlock hadn’t returned to be by John, so engrossed in his experiments that he didn’t even hear John ask if he wanted any food.  So, without another word, John left the flat, completely quiet from Sherlock’s perspective.
“It was either this way or not at all.  If you didn’t figure it out from the restaurant, I was just going to let it drop.  It’s not important, anyway.”  Sherlock snapped, looking to get ready to leave.
"I asked you what you wanted to discuss with Doctor Sterndale," Sherlock repeated impatiently, rolling his eyes in clear disgust at John's fascination with Molly Hooper's anatomy.
"The gates," Sherlock replied, pointing to indicate the team of men who were opening and slamming gates closed, depending on the color of the horse going through.  "I can see them directing specific horses through, but then they keep opening the main gate and letting them all back out again.  Why?  Isn't the point to round them up...unless they're engaging in some sort of training exercise?" he added, feigning hesitance, even though it was readily apparent.
Sherlock made an affirmative noise, feigning understanding at the meaningless names John was relaying.
"Well, from the initial phone call, actually.  Seeing the mare in person simply confirmed my deductions."
Sherlock's eyes narrowed in annoyance.  He seldom bothered to masturbate; it was messy, distracting and the resultant rush of serotonin, oxytocin, vasopressin and prolactin reminded him unpleasantly of his ultimately disastrous relationship with Victor.  When he did masturbate to ensure his prostate's continued health, he preferred to keep his movements perfunctory, getting the entire tedious process over with as quickly as possible.  Unfortunately, this was clearly not going to be a situation where he could ignore his penis into quiescence.
It was on the tip of Sherlock's tongue to protest that Molly wasn't his date, but before he could, John tipped his hat and strode away, the slump of his shoulders almost imperceptible.
"Oh God," Molly gasped, veterinary training kicking in belatedly after the initial rush of adrenaline.  "You're covered in blood.  Why are you covered in blood?  Did you hurt yourself sweetie?  Did something attack you?  Is that why you're being so vicious?"  She played the light of her torch over the stallion's massive frame, desperately searching for the source of blood without getting too close.  The stallion's constant movement made it difficult though.
"Stop it, just stop right there," John interrupted, jabbing an angry finger in Sherlock's direction.  "I don't
"Nope," Lestrade replied, shaking his head.  "He was fine.  Tried to nick a bite of my cereal bar earlier, but that's hardly unusual.  If I'd noticed something off, I would've called the vet instead of taking him on patrol."
The clown mimed a brief tantrum before standing up and walking back around to the horse’s head.  He pantomimed a question, to which the horse responded with a violent head shake.  The clown stepped back and walked in a circle as he scratched his chin, before throwing one hand in the air in the universal sign of ‘I just had a brilliant idea!’  Reaching into his trousers again, he pulled out a carrot that looked to be close to a half meter in length and waved it before the horse.  This time the horse responded with a nod, garnering yet more laughter from the crowd.  The man turned to collect the saddle and chest strap, while the horse picked up the clown’s hat.  When the clown reached for it, the horse jerked its head up, keeping the hat out of reach while the clown jumped ineffectually for it.  The act concluded with the clown trading the enormous carrot for his hat and the two took bows before exiting the ring to enthusiastic applause.
It wasn't just the music; it was the entire sub-culture's mindset.  He'd been appalled by the number of people pretending to be rugged ranchers and emulating the glory-days of a fictional American Old West.  As if any of the people packing the bar had ever awoken at 4:00 a.m. to help a laboring mare give birth, or received a tetanus jab after tangling with barb wire.  As if any of them understood the difference between English and Western riding techniques, or how crack a whip, or sling a lasso with incredible accuracy.  As if any of them had ever spent days, if not weeks working with a frightened animal that was determined to trample one to death.
"Oh my god…just look at you," John whispered, his tone unmistakably reverent as he reached out and slowly smoothed his left hand over Sherlock's belly.  John's fingertips skimmed lightly over the delineations of Sherlock's abdominal muscles before sliding up to ghost over one of Sherlock's larger scars, tracing the edges with remarkable gentleness.
Sherlock's persistence had finally paid off.  He could now stand directly outside of the pen, without Devil's Blaze screaming in fear.  It had been almost a week since the stallion had last tried to attack him through the rails.  Now it was time to move on to the next step: enter the pen, establish his dominance and gradually work his way up to being able to actually handle the stallion.
"Because it's fun?" John retorted.  "It's a chance for some people to mingle, flirt...maybe get laid?"
The cabin was small, measuring 24'x18' at the most, not counting the front porch.  The front door opened onto a large room with a gabled, wood-panelled ceiling, giving him the feeling of being inside a wooden crate.  A medium-sized stone fireplace built of the same pale yellow stone he'd seen elsewhere on the ranch was set into the exterior wall on his left.  A small kitchenette, complete with cabinets and a small cooktop was laid out at the back of the cabin.  The wall to his immediate right contained three doors, all closed.
Sherlock put them on without bothering to replace his socks and carefully slid down off the table.  Stamford held out his hands, prepared to catch him if he lost his balance, but Sherlock waved him away, preferring to rest one hand against the wall for support as he walked.  When he exited the loo, Mke was waiting for him, head cocked to one side as he watched Sherlock walk slowly towards him.
The first bite of crisp was accompanied by the burn of capsaicin comparable to a punch to his sinuses.  Blinking back tears from his watering eyes, Sherlock stared down at the bag he’d grabbed at random from the vendor’s tray.  Xiuhtecuhtli’s Fire.  Ah.  It was an appropriate name for a crisp that advertised puya chili peppers as one of the ingredients, Sherlock mused as he wiped his running nose with one of the bandana’s he’d ‘borrowed’ from John’s rucksack.
"Oh?" Sherlock replied, tilting his head and giving John a coy look through his lashes.  "Whatever did you have in mind?" Sherlock asked, deliberately biting his lower lip.
“Come on,” John said, turning around, clenching his fists before deliberately relaxing them.  “I need to enter this in my laptop.”
Seeing it, Sterndale's lips curved in the shared smirk of annoyance from somebody butting in where they weren't wanted.  "Not especially," he replied, answering Sherlock's question as if John hadn't spoken.  "Generally when a bovine dies of a heart condition, it can be traced back to septic pericarditis—often caused by some sort of infection.  Such deaths are more commonly associated with feedlot animals and dairy cattle, rather than a pampered athlete.  But as it is with any performance animal, tragedies do happen.  I am sure you have lost an animal or two to accidents on the race track or during training, have you not, Mr. Scott?"
.  Volunteers and vocational training.  It was a shop that was run for a cause, rather than profit.  That explained it.
"Or maybe summer.  I'm not sure which," Sherlock continued, taking another sip and narrowing his eyes in thought.  He looked up from the rim to see John watching him with a puzzled expression.  "The consumption of certain foodstuffs or scents had the ability to trigger vivid memories," Sherlock explained.  "It's called the 'Proust Effect,' or the 'Proustian Experience' after the author, Marcel Proust, who was the first person to describe it in one of his novels.  When I was a young child, we had a gardener who kept bees and the blacksmith who shod my family's horses brewed mead for the holidays.  Occasionally, if I was very, very good—or very, very sneaky—I could steal a taste of either the raw honey or the finished product.  Sometimes both."
John smiled and shook his head, “That’s amazing.  May I ask why you didn’t just order from the beginning, then?  Why make me look it all over?”
John wondered if it was because Sherlock liked being back with John, not that the man would ever admit it.  Being close to Sherlock brought John comfort, to it was only normal that Sherlock felt the same way.  But this was Sherlock John was thinking about.  The man wasn’t exactly confined to emotional and social normalities set out by society.  But there was such a thing as too much, and Sherlock often pushed at the limit line until it broke.
“Oh course I’m going to-“ He frowned and reached for his napkin, wiping off his hand, sending Sherlock a glare the entire time.  The detective just smiled cheekily back at him, chewing on his food.  They continued eating for a while when John finally decided to ask the question he had wanted to know the answer to since they had arrived at the restaurant.
“Okay, I’m in, but I don’t even know what food it is.”  He made a grab for Sherlock phone, who merely held it in the air, out of reach from the shorter man.
Sherlock scooted to the far side, placing the desserts on the seat between them, “Yes, I quite enjoyed it.  I wouldn’t mind returning to this place someday for lunch or another dinner.  Maybe when we’re in the neighborhood again?”
“Sherlock, wait.  I didn’t mean it like that, sorry.”  Sherlock still wouldn’t turn, but he had at least stopped running.  He reached out, tugging on Sherlock’s wrist and slowly the man turned around, whose mask was back in place.  “Look.  I’m just confused, that’s all.  You said you were married to your work.  I thought you were asexual, personally.”
John held out his hand, “All right, okay.  You’re socially awkward, I get it.  But this is something you could have just told me.  Though I’m a little confused as to why you’ve developed these feelings for me.  I thought you were married to you work?”
The crowd on the TV was cheering and they could hear others outside their flat as well, cheering in the New Year.  Suddenly, John pulled away, slapping his drink down on the table.  It had been forgotten on the sofa and had nearly fallen over in their embrace.
“I’ll go make you breakfast,” when John didn’t talk, he continued, “I think eggs, a banana, and some orange juice are in order.”
“’A sign of affection.’  Sherlock-“ John stopped and let out a sigh, “Is there something that you need to talk to me about?”
“Adi K’eyih set.”  Sherlock finished for him.  John blinked in surprise and handed over his menu as Sherlock held up his.  He waited for her to be far enough away before he hissed.
John didn’t let out his sigh of relief, though.  Not yet.  He might need it for later.  Then started his favorite time with eating with Sherlock in public.  The deductions.  Soon the two were a pair of giggling idiots, trying to keep their voices down as Sherlock told John about everyone else in the restaurant.  They only stopped when the waitress brought them over their starter, sliding on the table between them.  John grabbed one of the rolled up injeras with what he supposed was the timtimo in it, and began eating.  It was different, but it was delicious.  The injera had a strange taste and texture to it, but it complimented the food perfectly and he let out a little hum as he chewed on the food, noticing that Sherlock smiled at the noise as he, too, picked his own food up.
“It’s considered the correct way to eat, yes.  Make sure you use your right hand, though.  That’s the proper hand to use while eating here.”
“I was looking over other types of foods we could try out, we can only eat Chinese takeaway so much, and came across this place.  It’s merely coincidence that the case happened to end nearby.”  Of course it did.  John just barely managed to stop himself from rolling his eyes.  “And then I came across something I wanted to try.”
“No, John.  It’s the name for what I want to try.  We’re already eating off the same plate, so I might as well try this.”  John watched as he ripped off a piece of injera and scooped up some of the food, but instead of eating it, he held it out for John.  He looked down at the food held out for him, then up at Sherlock as though a third eye had suddenly decided to start emerge on the man’s forehead.
So New Years Eve arrived and they sat around the flat with no plans.  Mrs. Hudson had left earlier to spend the night with Mrs. Turner next door, so the two had the building to themselves.  As she had left, she had told John to keep an eye on Sherlock and make sure he didn’t do anything dangerous.  She might as well have told John to teach Sherlock how to not be an annoying git most of the time.  They were well stocked up on everything they would need for the celebration, or what small one they would have.  John had already broke out the champagne and wine, slowly downing his third glass.  Sherlock had barely started his first.
“No, I refuse!”  Sherlock tried to squirm out of his hold, but even he was no match for a drunk John.  There was a reason he had been a Captain.  He found himself on the ground, John over him, pinning him down.  He smelt of alcohol, with just a hint of tea and spices, probably spilt on his jumper during one of his fits when he saw Sherlock in his vision.  He smelt like John, except with alcohol thrown into the mix.  John was leaning down dangerously close, face inches from Sherlock’s.
As an answer, John turned his laptop around, showing off the restaurant’s site.  Sherlock glanced down at it, then back up at John, “Yes?”
“No, but-“ he watched as Sherlock’s arm faltered, an unreadable motion flashing through the man’s eyes.  He let out a little sigh instead of the rest of his sentence and reached forward, grabbed Sherlock’s wrist with his clean hand and brought the food forward.  He never took his eyes off Sherlock’s as he took the food into his mouth.  He swore he saw a slight blush heat up the detective’s usual pale cheeks as his lips brushed against Sherlock’s long fingers.
“We’ll have to wait until after a case, when I’ll actually be hungry,” Sherlock was shifting his fingers, brushing them over John’s inner wrist, twisting out of John’s grip and finding his finger.  They entwined them, fingers slotting together and Sherlock moved closer, his mask crumbling.
It was their first case together after Sherlock’s return and it had gone perfectly.  If you looked past the cuts and bruises they both sported, and instead to the laughs and smiled the shared with each other as they walked from the circus of police cars.  They were making off into the night like criminals themselves, Lestrade yelling after them that he would need a statement someday, at least.  That someday would be next week, by Sherlock’s calculations, when John was off work and finally dragged Sherlock down to the Yard.
Sherlock slid into the seat in front of him, newspaper spread out in front of him.  John couldn’t see his face, but he knew his eyes were reading over the words at a mile a minute.  He set down his fork and scooted his plate of eggs across the table, nudging at the bottom of the newspaper.  Sherlock brought the paper up and to the side, his eyes staring down at the plate as John continued to push it forward until it stopped in front of him.  He looked up, his brow drawn together and John bit back a laugh.
“I was thinking we could get one of these,” John looked up as Sherlock took his menu and opened it to the page he was referring to, showing the group choices, “They’re for two.”  He offered as way of explanation.
When they were done with the starters, finally the waitress brought over the main dish and John had to stop and stare at it in awe for a moment.  He had seen others eating it in the restaurant, had seen their order, but it still did not prepare him for seeing the whole thing.  It looked delicious, for one thing, and how on earth were you supposed to eat with just your hand, because this looked a lot messier than the starter had been, already rolled up for them.  John was just glad he had clipped his nails last night, because this was sure to be a messy meal.  Which meant that it would be messy for Sherlock as well.  A smirk curled his lips.
“For auld lang syne, my dear, for auld lang syne, we'll take a cup of kindness yet, for auld lang syne.”  Sherlock joined in, singing the chorus and John looked up at him, a hint of a smile starting to pull at his lips.
Something was definitely going weird.  Sherlock Holmes was getting flustered.  He licked his lips and reached for more food.  They fell back into a comfortable silence eating away at the food.  As they were nearing the end – Sherlock sure could eat when he wanted to, John decided – John wavered.
The week went by faster than John expected and the next thing he knew, it was the day before New Year’s Eve.  He had wondered whether he should try to throw a party the next day or drag Sherlock off to someone else’s.  In the end, he decided neither would be the best.  Lestrade was still getting over the fact that Sherlock was alive, Molly was avoiding the both of them after admitting she knew the truth, Mrs. Hudson watched Sherlock as though he were a ghost, and Mycroft was being, well, himself.  John didn’t mind and he knew that Sherlock would be overjoyed.  He may have liked to show off around others, but he also loved the simplicity of being without them.
“I know you don’t want to talk about what you did those years and I can understand that.  I’ve kept secrets from you about the war, at least I hope I have,” he smirked, “and it’s okay for you to keep things to yourself if that makes it easier for you-“
“Did you look it up just to impress me?”  John smiled, sitting down.  Sherlock didn’t answer at first, his gaze traveling over the other customers before sliding back to John.
“I merely learned this information earlier today when researching this restaurant.  I’ll delete it later, don’t worry.”  He turned to ask for a table for two and they were led to the main room, menus set on both sides of the table.
He hadn’t needed to wait long.  John must have been gone longer than he had thought.  He frowned.  He didn’t like feeling wrong so much all the time.  It was as if he was learning how it felt to live like Anderson.  It was awful.  John came through the door into the kitchen, pausing when he didn’t see Sherlock leaning over the table as he had when he left.  He peeked around the corner to find a disgruntled Sherlock curling in on himself and glaring at him.  John barely suppressed his need to roll his eyes and moved into the kitchen, pushing equipment out of the way to set down the Chinese food.
John clearly found the idea appealing too, because his dark-blue eyes went molten and the sound he made when Sherlock leaned forward and re-captured his mouth was somewhere between a growl and a moan.
Molly shook her head.  "Just buckle bunnies...um...women who really like rodeo cowboys," Molly added, slanting a quick, shamefaced look across to Sherlock.  "Um…as I said, Joe kind of kept to himself outside of work."
Sherlock pursed his lips in annoyance at the tedious prattle, but before he could say anything, the thin point of one of Donovan's heels came down to rest against the top of his foot, a clear, nonverbal warning to remain silent.
"The latter.  I placed third in the bull riding division at the National High School Finals in 1990."  John’s smile was wry.  "I was one of the shortest guys there, which actually worked out to my advantage.  When I got back home, I was able to rub winnings in the faces of some bullies giving me grief at school for being shorter than a lot of the girls.  It also got me more than a few dates."
“Keep pouting, and you’re gonna get a pillow in the face.”  John’s voice was sleep rough, and the husky rasp of his voice was having the opposite effect he was probably intending.
"Oh.  Well, that sounds scary," Molly said soothingly, giving Sherlock a reassuring smile, "but it's probably nothing.  It's not exactly uncommon when you have a bunch of cattle penned up together.  At least, that's what Socorro and Cole have told me."  She unlocked her truck so Sherlock could climb in and set her bag down in the middle of the bench.  "How's your wrist?"
John clearly had no such qualms, almost scarfing his dinner with little happy huffs and hums of pleasure as he chewed.  Clearly he was used to eating on the run.  Some guacamole oozed out of the edge of the sandwich as John took another bite and Sherlock tilted his head, absurdly captivated by the small smear of pale green at the edge of John's mouth.
It was a fairly lengthy walk to the conference room, past the common area, down one floor and around a corner.  Apparently the architect had wanted to minimize the accidental overflow of noise from the common work areas, or else they wanted to reduce the number of prying eyes observing inhabitants.
, Sherlock automatically translated, "—Doc Watson recommended against it.  It's too difficult to judge the dose of a sedative like Ace when given orally.  Each horse will react differently, depending on how much they eat, or if they eat it on an empty stomach.  I'm not willing to risk a penile prolapse in one of my prize studs, or a low hematocrit."
Everywhere he looked, Sherlock could see photographs of Candii's horses.  Apparently her statement that her horses were her babies was not hyperbole.  The pictures were grouped in clusters on a fireplace mantle and sitting on end tables flanking seating arrangements.  They were even placed in empty spots in bookcases that existed purely for decoration, rather than for use by a serious bibliophile.  Sherlock could see no other reason why somebody would voluntarily own a set of 'The American Peoples Encyclopedia,' published in 1953, though he could grudgingly admit that there was some aesthetic value to the highly recognizable (and ornate) red and gold spines.
Sherlock hissed at the stinging in his fingers, but resisted the urge to suck on them to lessen the pain.  Donovan's response seemed oddly out of proportion for his transgression.  Intrigued, he tilted his head and pursed his lips, deducing the detective for a moment before launching into his observations.  "Based on your response earlier, you've experienced quite a bit of casual sexism and racism from your colleagues in the form of gendered expectations and gender-based demands," Sherlock announced.  "During the course of your career, you've encountered multiple instances of male coworkers, specifically older males, expecting you to fetch coffee, take notes and perform other menial office chores because you are female, despite your senior rank and case closure rate.  In spite of your mother's influence, you adhered to such expectations in the early days of your career, hoping to avoid conflict, which had a negative impact on your advancement prospects.  Nowadays, you are hyper-aware of any individual making sexist demands upon you in a workplace and respond forcefully because allowing such sexism to pass unchallenged undermines not only your perceived competence and thus your future career prospects, but the potential of any other female officers."
"Whyever not?" Sherlock interrupted, folding his arms and biting his bottom lip in consternation.  He was puzzled and more than a little hurt by John's scolding.  Was John uncomfortable being seen flirting with him in public?  "We're in a safe environment.  I...thought you would enjoy it.  What did I do wrong?"
Bending forward, Mycroft retrieved several additional manila folders from the attaché case still by his feet and tossed the first two onto the coffee table, neatly missing the half-full cup of tea.  Several pages of a neatly typed police report slid out of the bottom folder.  The edges of several colour photographs slid out of the other, their glossy surfaces hinting at the folder's contents.
"Ah.  Then yes, I most certainly will want to speak with him.  There's the possibility he might have remembered something, or overheard a sound that might be integral to discovering what happened to Devil's Blaze that night...and Straker too," Sherlock added belatedly in response to John's disapproving expression.
"Most stock contractors are at one point or another," Edith said wryly.  "Riley's PRESS blog isn't the only one out there, but she's definitely one of the more persistently obnoxious ones."
The room erupted into thunderous applause.  Eyes alight with excitement and pleasure, Sherlock leaned over to breathe against John's ear, his breath a warm tickle against the sensitive skin.  "I do hope we don't have cases for a few days," he rumbled.  "Once I get done with you tonight, you're not going to be able to walk straight for a week!"
"Blaze?" Molly whispered, hurrying forward towards the enraged stallion: her common sense over-ridden by compassion and the need to help.  "What's wron—Ahh!" she shrieked, jerking back in surprise as the horse suddenly changed direction and lunged for her, bared teeth snapping inches from her face.
Adopting an expression of interest, Sherlock reached down and pulled one of Molly's textbooks free from her bag.  It was a battered, but still serviceable copy of Beurgelt and Del Piero's
The sound of heels clicking down the hallway in short, sharp, staccato steps heralded the detective's arrival several seconds before she appeared.  Sherlock made a face, but didn't move away from the computer.
"You okay?" John asked after a few moments of labored breathing.  He reached out and brushed a gentle hand across Sherlock's chest and then frowned.  "You're shaking," John observed, rising up and propping himself up on one elbow.
It was strange to be in a city and have such an uninterrupted view of the sky.  Even the tallest structure he could spot nearby was no more than three stories tall, and surprisingly bland and featureless, compared to the beauty and history that was older London.  The streets around them were all laid out in a regular grid, which was in complete contrast to the far more organic sprawling and twisting of London's older roads.  The streets were also much wider than they were in much of London, serving as yet another example of the American tendency towards unnecessary pavement, urban sprawl and enormous vehicles.
"What can you tell me about Devil's Blaze?  Both generally and personally?  I've worked with a lot of horses, but this is my first time working with a mustang bronco."
John huffed a laugh.  "That’s an understatement if I ever heard one.  Just don’t...I dunno...set anything on fire as an experiment on the flammability of Absorbine veterinary liniment gel, okay?"
"I should think not," Mr. Tregennis said hotly, looking up from where he was pressing a handkerchief into Brenda's hands.  "I don't care how much of a so-called 'expert' your colleague is, or how important your case is.  We're not crooks, no matter what that man's implying," Mr. Tregennis continued, shooting a dark look at Sherlock.  "I'm of half a mind to leave right now, if this is how you're going to treat us."
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, begrudgingly impressed.  Apparently Donovan was one of those rare office employees who made at least a token effort with regard to computer security.  Folding his hands in front of his mouth, Sherlock ran his eyes over the contents of Donovan's desk and bookcase, looking for clues as to what she might have been thinking when she last created her password.  Even the most security-conscious individual tended to personalize their passwords, imbibing them with personal meaning that made them both memorable and easy for the user to recall.  Anniversaries, inside jokes, pet names and personal character traits were prime fodder.
Sherlock twitched an eyebrow.  He'd observed enough locker-room social interactions over the years to know that among friends the man's question could have been seen as a good-natured jibe, but the tense line of John's shoulders made it clear that the other man was anything but.
"What happened to the horse's body after the necropsy?" Sherlock asked, focusing in the possible clue.  The necropsy report had mentioned faint traces of smoke inhalation and irritated lung and nasal tissues.  It might prove to be useless, but it wouldn't hurt to exhume the body and collect samples for further analysis.
knife," John informed him with a bemused twist of his lips.  "Second drawer to your left.  The cutting mat's in there too."
"Sometimes, yes," Sherlock admitted, "but it isn't common, and almost certainly shouldn't be attempted with a young mare and a older horse that was gelded late in life."
With a huff of annoyance, Molly took in the tidily-made bed and the lack of dirty clothes on the floor.  An unopened string of condoms lay on the bedside shelf but there was no accompanying wallet, keys or pack of cigarettes.  "Umm…okay," Molly breathed out softly as she finished surveying the space.  "So you obviously didn't sleep here last night.  That's fine…you're a handsome man…"  She rubbed an index finger across her lower lip.  "Maybe you're already in the barns, getting the animals ready?" she murmured aloud to herself.  "Oh I hope so…" she muttered with another annoyed glance at her watch.
"So...why didn't anybody investigate with the possibility of sabotage?  That seems like that's a pretty damn obvious idea," Donovan returned, furrowing her brow.
“Hold on, easy there!” The rider reached out, callused hands cradling Sherlock’s and palpitating the rapidly swelling area with gentle efficiency. Sherlock hissed again as the man’s fingers pressed on a particularly painful point.
The detective's U-shaped desk was covered with stacks of manilla folders, each one meticulously closed and rubber-banded on both axises to keep any loose documents inside from randomly falling out.  There were two bookcases set in the far left corner, set at right angles to each other.  One faced the desk, the other faced the hallway.  Both were full of police procedure manuals and department policy guides, (he could see the coloured spines overhanging the too-shallow depth).  An American flag, folded into a triangle and enclosed in a protective glass display box sat on the top of the hallway-facing book case.  A beige file cabinet tucked in between the back bookcase and one edge of the desk contained a half-full, heavily stained coffee pot and a collection of mugs with different slogans.
Sherlock huffed out a sigh of irritation.  That was hardly a helpful answer.  It was yet another avenue he’d need to spend time exploring in his bid to eliminate all possible suspects.  In the arena below, a pair of identical twins shot out of the chute and successfully roped their calf.
"Naw.  She belongs to Miz Ross, but she don't mind minglin' with us po' folks.  I'm Wayne Jones," the man introduced himself, offering a hand which Sherlock took.  Wayne Jones's slight frame was belayed by the strength of his grip as he easily pulled the taller man to his feet.  "You must be the new guy Miz Molly's sighing over."
"It damn well better be," the woman snapped, before hanging up the phone with a sharp click.  She jolted down a name and a phone number on the pad of paper in front of her, before standing up and extending a hand to Sherlock.  "Sherlock," she greeted him sweetly, raking his form up and down with a ruthless pair of brown eyes that belied the sugary tones of her voice.  "I appreciate you bein' so patient.  I'm Candii Ross.  Welcome to the Triple C.  I'm glad you're here."
"Thus far, tests have failed to reveal the presence of morphine or other opiates that might cause him to act out," Sherlock reported grudgingly.  "I also visually examined the straw in his stall and the hay in his manger.  There was no obvious sign of yew, locoweed or morphine in his feed...but that doesn't mean that there isn't something there to find.  I
As a concession, Donovan had agreed to follow-up on Fizzy Simpson and a few of the stock contractor names Sherlock had supplied, but Sherlock understood her hesitance (even if he didn't agree with it).  There was no good reason to spend precious time looking for theoretical culprits working behind multiple screens when, in real life, most premeditated crimes were committed by ordinary people for the sake of greed, revenge, love, or a combination of the three.  As far as Donovan was probably concerned, complex plots by dastardly villains and secret societies were the stuff of novels and the types of telly programs Mrs. Hudson watched with such avidness.  Admittedly there was the occasional case of somebody being clever enough to hide their tracks or work through several intermediaries, but most members of the criminal class were idiots.
"Hey now," Mr. Tregennis interjected, his annoyance clear.  "My finances are none of your business, mister.  I know how much Linda paid for her horse, and it weren't cheap.  Cream Soda was a perfectly sound animal with championship bloodlines."
There were many, and it was difficult at a first glance to tell which ones were self-inflicted and which ones may have been human-caused.
But, finally, the last few minutes came around and John moved around, turning off all the lights so their focus was just on the screen.  The world outside was quiet, as though everyone was taking a collective breath as they waited for the New Year to roll in.  John was nicely drunk at this point, and he suspected Sherlock had drunk half his drink and dumped the other half out in a poor, unsuspecting plant just so he could have a second glass and let John not feel as bad for being on his sixth.  John appreciated it, but it really didn’t change much.
“I hope that kiss will do,” he said, his voice wavering for once as he tried to think of what he had done.  Had John wanted this when he mentioned the tradition?  Or had he just been mentioning it?  Perhaps he wanted more than just a kiss on the head?  But Sherlock couldn’t do that, couldn’t take that step.  He had just gotten John back.  He didn’t want to ruin it already.  But John was clutching at him, nodding into his chest, hands tangled in the front of Sherlock’s shirt.
Half an hour later he found himself sitting at the cleared off table in the sitting room, slowly eating the eggs on his plate.  He was already on his second glass of orange juice, his mouth parched.  He briefly wondered where all the objects that had been on the table went until he spotted a stack of papers next to the sofa, his laptop resting on the arm of the piece of furniture.  He chewed on the eggs, his eyes fixed on the mess Sherlock had created after being back home for just a few hours.  He couldn't imagine what it would be like after a few days.  Wait, no, he did.  It would look just like it had back when Sherlock was still screaming at the crap telly playing in the corner.  He smiled and took another sip of his orange juice, reaching for his banana.
Sherlock hovered over the back of John’s armchair, staring down at the shorter man as he slowly typed his newest blog entry with two fingers.  John heard Sherlock sniff in disdain as he typed out that Sherlock was in idiot.  The detective had been doing this frequently.  Hovering, that is.  He already did the judging before the fall, but never had he stayed behind John for so long.
Their relation only grew closer and stronger after that night, both of them growing closer and learning each other all over again.  They told each other stories, filling in the three year gap in both of their lives with the other’s information, putting it all in place.  John moved into Sherlock room after only a few weeks, but it seemed as if they had been together longer than that.  John wondered why he had never realized his feelings before the fall, even with all the clues and words given to him by his ex-girlfriends.  Sherlock simply wondered why he felt like this toward John when he had never felt like this for any person before.  In the end he erased those thoughts because this was John and John wasn’t like any person he had met before.
He was still flipping back and forth when the waitress came by asking for their drinks.  Sherlock just asked for a glass of water but John peered at the beverages for a bit before ordering a Sexy Mosob.  The waitress walked away and he could practically feel Sherlock staring at him.  He turned with a smile.
“If you ever see me drinking like this again, you have permission to hit me,” John slurred before jumping up, moving into the kitchen.  He pulled on drawers and opened cabinets until almost every one was open until he finally found what he had been looking for.  He held it up in triumph and Sherlock stared at the black rock held proudly in John’s hands.  Coal, from one of his upcoming experiments.  His mind arrived at the conclusion before John had even brought the coal back down.
John wasn’t far in front of Lestrade with accepting Sherlock back business.  There were days where he saw the man out of the corner of his eye and nearly broke his neck trying to look over fast enough.  He had broken two cup already in shock, standing tired in the kitchen, waiting for the water to boil when Sherlock would come in, stretching and yawning.  During those times he often forgot to make two cups instead of just one.  He had remembered a few times after he had sat down with his own cup to take a sip before almost spitting the liquid out in realization and running back to pour another tea to set out in front of Sherlock.  Often it sat there all day, growing cold, and sometimes John would stare at it when Sherlock was out of the room, wondering if he was mad or if Sherlock was just being himself and not drinking or eating for days.  Maybe he was just setting out another cup for no one.
“It’s a small African country by the Red Sea and under control of Ethiopia until 1993.  As a result, their food is quiet similar, though they were influenced by the Italians as well,” Sherlock said, moving forward to push open the door.
“It was simple, really.  You ordered a cocktail, so tea was out of the question, so the middle two on both menus are out.  You’d rather have meat, so now the entire vegetarian menu is forgotten.  So, what remains is the plain one, and the one with dessert.  You’re not overly fond of lamb, which the first one has, and, you figure that, since I’m paying for it, you might as well go all the way.  So, the Adi K’eyih selection.  The only question now is what you’re going for with the dessert.”
The man beside her was every inch the stereotypical rancher.  His skin was deep bronze, the already-rich colour darkened by the harsh Southwest sun.  His features bore the battered, weatherworn stamp of a man who had spent the majority of his life outdoors battling the elements.  His salt-and-pepper hair and mustache were neatly trimmed, the former just barely visible underneath the battered hat.  It was pinched in a different crease, one that Sherlock recognized from his studies of different cowboy hat styles as a 'Telescope crease', or 'Gambler's' Hat.' It was a style better suited to the hot clime of Southwest then Sherlock's own 'Montana' crease hat style.  The gold wedding ring on the man's left hand was highly polished, and the visibly swollen knuckles likely made removal difficult.  A matching ring hung on a chain around the man's neck.  So, a widower and his daughter.  The daughter was likely following in her mother's footsteps as a barrel racer.
Competitors and rodeo employees alike were balanced on the bars making up the chutes, making it difficult to see the horses.  The first rider was already astride their mount, leaning back to test the length of their bronc rein.  The next two riders were in the process of saddling up their own broncs.
"From what?" John demanded, shuffling forward to take Sherlock’s right foot in gentle hands that were at complete odds with his tone.  His brow furrowed with concentration as he carefully manipulated Sherlock’s foot turning it from side to side to examine a particularly inflamed spot on Sherlock’s right heel.  Stamford had covered the wound with a protective bandage, but the surrounding inflammation was shockingly bright against Sherlock’s pale skin.  "Properly broken in boots shouldn’t do this."
As they walked, Sherlock kept shooting Molly sideline glances, mentally deducing the circumstances responsible for her change in demeanor.  At the airport and during the drive, she'd reminded him of nothing so much as a mouse—timid, quiet, with the occasional dash of spunk.  Now, back at the ranch, she extruded quiet confidence, backed with competence as she led Sherlock down asphalt paths designed to making moving wheelbarrows and wagons easier to haul, and through different buildings.
"Tinhorn's not that thick," was the answer, an explanation that was confirmed with a nod from John.  "The next thing I knew was wakin' up in the ER with a lump on my head and a headache from hell.  One of the docs told me I was lucky I hadn't choked to death on my own vomit.  Later, some hospital therapist came to lecture me 'bout the dangers of binge drinking on high-proof distilled stuff like whiskey and offered to get me help.  I told him that the only thing I'd had to drink that night had been a Bud Lite, 'cept he told me I was lying and he knew it because the cops had found an empty bottle of Jim Beam in the hay beside me with my fingerprints all over it.  Like I'd ever touch that shit intentionally," Ned added with a disgusted grimace.
Sherlock nodded in understanding, deciding to wait on other questions until he'd done some more research so as to avoid arousing unnecessary suspicion.  "Where to next?"  Sherlock tucked his hands into his pockets and rocked back on his heels, taking a moment to relieve the pressure on his toes.
"Ah...so, in theory, if one wanted to sabotage an opponent's ride, one would need to obtain both a copy of the roster and be able to identify the corresponding mount?" Sherlock asked, tilting his head to one side.
Sherlock purposely bit his lower lip.  "What about…" he began, making his voice tenative as suited his current character.  "What if—instead of going out—we grabbed something to go and took it back to your place to eat?  That way you could still get your shower and we could have dinner together in privacy?" Sherlock asked, ending the suggestion with an upward lilt that made it into a question, rather than a firm suggestion.
Sherlock's lip curled.  Donovan admittedly had a point, but it was still irritating to be constrained.  He would simply have to ask Jim to forward him copies of the relevant information when he got back to his cabin later.  "What about Sterndale?  Have you learned anything new there?"
"I do."  Pulling out his license was awkward, but Sherlock managed and passed the plastic card over.
Hartwin headcannon for Venvephe: Eggsy’s always grown up with the cheapest, most horrible polyester socks, because that’s the only type his mum could afford. Harry takes the deprived young man sock-shopping and introduces him to the joy of quality socks…silk, sea island cotton, extra fine Merino wool, cashmere, Marcoliani and Bresciani and all the best brands. Eggsy promptly introduces Harry to the joys of foot jobs.
"Ms. Ross was...understandably against the idea of euthanizing her prize stallion without consulting a second opinion, especially after hearing Doctor Watson's suspicions.  On her orders, the horse was re-sedated, loaded into a trailer and transported to a nearby clinic.  Once there, he was placed in isolation and subjected to a battery of tests, including blood panels and a full drug screen."
"Mmm...perhaps," Doctor Sterndale replied, his voice still rife with suspicion as he glanced from John, to where Sherlock was still pretending to be reading the magazine.  Sherlock didn't miss Sterndale's eye-twitch of disapproval as he took in Sherlock's purple and gray striped shirt, slim jeans, plain boots and lack of impressive belt buckle.  It was clear where his daughter inherited her mannerisms.
"Good boy.  That's a good boy, come on," Sherlock crooned as the stallion took another hesitant step forward and then stopped.  Sherlock extended his left fist, being careful to keep his fingers facing downward so they would be protected from being bitten off.
The advertiser was either an idiot, or deliberately mislabeling their product, because so-called "spring" water that tasted as though it came from an artificial lake subject to bi-annual turnovers was not his idea of a refreshing beverage.  Who would have thought that water could still taste muddy after having been through a water treatment plant?  Despite the strange taste, Sherlock downed more than half the bottle in a few quick gulps before he’d quite realized what he’d done.  The sudden pressure on his stomach made him grunt in discomfort.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  "As I already explained to Molly, my work is demanding.  Horses are creatures of habit and require a consistent routine.  Taking several days off from training can undo several weeks of progress.  I wouldn't even be here this weekend if Ms. Ross hadn't insisted."
Sherlock nodded, his eyes rapidly scanning the space.  The building was a simple rectangle with high ceilings that had been divided into multiple sections.  A large, poured concrete aisle, complete with drains ran down the middle.  Three oversized-box stalls occupied one end of the barn.  A breeding pen containing the requisite dummy mare for semen collection and a breeding stand occupied one corner.  The other corner was walled off to create a small room.
Sherlock sneered.  "And why me?" he demanded, raising an eyebrow.  "I know that you mentioned Ms. Ross has friends in high places and is willing to pay for the best, but why are you here,
"Are you sure you don't need any other specimens?" Doctor Früh asked coolly, "or are you content to leave my patient with at least a few liters of his remaining blood volume?"
"We interviewed Ms. Hooper as a formality," Lestrade clarified, "since she's the individual who found the body.  She's not considered a suspect at this time."
Mrs. Porter blinked, clearly stunned by Sherlock's statement.  John, Sherlock noted, also had a puzzled expression on his face.
Sherlock stood up with a sneer for John and a subtle head shake for the medic warning them off.  "Fine.  I’ll remove my outer layers if that will make you feel better, but I can do it myself."
"No," Sherlock said slowly as he carefully studied John's features.  Somehow, unbelievably, the vet's praise was genuine.  "It's...fine."
When Sherlock finally stopped to take a rest after a good ninety minutes worth of work, both he and Devil’s Blaze were both doubly exhausted from their struggle for dominance and from the unrelenting glare from the harsh sun high overhead.  Sherlock walked the stallion out to cool him down and watered him, before picking up his own two bottles of lukewarm water and retreating to the shade of his (and Bonnie's) preferred tree so he could relax without unnecessarily exposing himself to even more UVA and UVB radiation.  The air under the shade was only marginally cooler, perhaps thirty-six degrees Celsius instead of thirty-seven, but there was a faint breeze, which helped.
"They're all over the place.  Eye inflammation, increased aggression…it's almost like a bunch of different cattle got accidently poisoned by Jimson weed or Woolly locoweed, but I checked the pastures myself and didn't find anything."
“Bullshit,” John retorted with a grin. “Hypoglycemia and passing out from low blood sugar or dehydration, those’ll slow down your mind.”
Sherlock pressed his lips together behind the screen of his glass in thought, stubbornly ignoring the small voice inside his brain that was screaming that this was a Bad Idea.  It hadn't stopped him from trying to ride his mother's prize stallion.  It hadn't stopped him from trying the intriguing smelling contents of the bottle the family's gardener kept locked up in a cabinet, and it certainly hadn't stopped him from trying the pills Victor had offered him at a party.  Instead, he concentrated on the feeling of heat suffusing his body and the burgeoning heaviness in his groin.  Sherlock glanced up again to study John's gently-encouraging expression.  He needed to answer in a way that was both honest, yet true to Billy's characterization as a nervous but eager mostly-virgin.  It wouldn't be especially hard: the most believable lies were the ones grounded in truth, after all.  The trick would be to include enough sordid details to keep John from questioning him for specifics.  Blowing out his breath, Sherlock lowered his wine glass and laced the fingers of both hands around the bowl.
Sherlock scrunched his closed eyes and jerked his head sideways in a spastic twitch to refocus his thought process.  He needed to concentrate on stock contractors, not the peripheral individuals affected by their actions.
"Also elevated.  Woah," John said, tugging Scotty's head down and back as the gelding began to snort in agitation.  "It's all right.  You're fine.  Just be still now—Billy?"
"I...see," John said slowly.  He frowned, blinked again and tilted his head to study Sherlock's face, his lips twitching in reaction to his thoughts.  "No, wait, I don't.  What do I see?  What do you mean Sterndale was lying?"
"I have," Sherlock agreed, purposely omitting the fact that many of those so-called 'accidents' tended to have a human originator.
Sherlock nodded sagely even as he silently processed the new information.  Reigate Rodeo Co. was one of the companies that Candii Ross had specifically mentioned as gunning for her contracts.  He could see why.  To Sherlock's experienced eye, the animals were in excellent overall condition, though their musculature was a bit different from what he was used to.  The horses possessed less overall lean muscle mass and far more highly-developed hindquarters, but that was only to be expected considering their training and use.
Sherlock bit his bottom lip in consideration as he weighed the likelihood of 'Billy' having heard the name and the risks of revealing said recognition.  After a quick, calculated gamble, he decided the risk was worth it.  "Ned Hunter…that name sounds vaguely familiar for some reason.  I think Ms. Ross might have mentioned it?"  Sherlock commented in an offhand tone.
when he became aware of his audience.  Startled, Sherlock looked up to see John standing in front of him, one hip cocked and an easy smile on his face.
"It's nice, spending time with people you like," John continued, his words quickening in apparent response to Sherlock's silence.  "Especially if they make you happy.  Family...friends...girlfriends...boyfriends.  All of it...it's all fine."
Sherlock jerked his head around to stare at Lestrade, Molly's offhand comments about John examining Scotty for spooky behavior suddenly surging to the forefront of his mind.  "What do you mean?" Sherlock asked, careful to keep his tone curious rather than accusatory.  "What do you mean 'spooky'?  Has he acted like this before?"
weren't terrible, but further experiments were regrettably curtailed after an...incident wherein Mrs. Hudson—unbeknownst to me, I might add—ran out of flour for the cake she was baking and borrowed some from my kitchen."
"And if one of your horses isn't suited to be a bronco?" Sherlock inquired, making a mental note to research how rodeo bronco scoring worked.
"I...see," Sherlock said slowly.  Alice's tone had a bit more venom than one would anticipate from casual conversation.  "I take it you've had your own first-hand encounters with some of these activists?" Sherlock asked, raising one eyebrow.
John didn’t even dignify the statement with a look.  “And I’m exhausted and fuckin’ sore,” he rasped instead, heedless of the way the timbre of his voice caused Sherlock’s erection to throb.  “Between you and the bronc, I’m still damn well wore out from last night.  Go jerk off in the shower if you’re that desperate.  I’m going back to sleep.”  So saying, John drew the covers over his head and burrowed into the mattress, effectively shielding himself inside a blanket burrito.
"Aside from the fact that bulls are prey animals like moose are prey animals, that's...not a bad summarization," John replied, clearly trying not to grimace at Sherlock's answer.  "But not...strictly accurate."
John blinked, looking bemused at Sherlock's questions.  "Most pens are designed for right-handed people.  In the case of this ballpoint—" John tapped at the biro, "—ink flows out as it's dragged across the page.  But when I write, I push the pen, rather than pull, which means it dries up after a few sentences.  The space pens, though, they have a pressurized ink cartridge, so it doesn't matter if I'm writing left-to-right, or even upside down, the ink will still flow."
"Yes," Lestrade said.  "It's something police horses are exposed to during training, just in case the need ever arises."
“Mmmmm…nope,” Sherlock replied, his deep voice emphasizing the pop on the ‘P’.  “So-called ‘championship’ buckles are available for purchase on eBay to anybody that has the money to spend, rendering their meaning useless for communication purposes, much like the commercialization of ancestral heraldry.  No, their value lies primarily as a means of advertising sexual prowess.  I’m attempting to calculate the ratio between buckle-size and penial size using your measurements as a mean.”
"Please," Sherlock agreed.  It might turn out to be a dead end, but it couldn't hurt to investigate the lead, however faint it was.  It also spoke well for John's possible innocence that he was willing to ask on Sherlock's behalf.
"Yes, it was," Molly agreed, still frowning.  When Sherlock remained silent, Molly gave him a pointed look.  "You should say you're sorry."
At that, Sherlock slitted one eye open.  “Touch my sock index again, and I will use your favorite mug for my upcoming moss experiment,” he threatened, earning a snicker from James.
"I've gotta go," Simpson said abruptly, "but you think about my offer, pal.  It'll be an easy way to put something in your pocket and nobody will ever know but us."  Simpson winked and hurried off, his gait surprisingly steady for a man who should—by Sherlock's private calculations—be showing at least some indicators of alcohol impairment.
Sherlock glanced over at Devil's Blaze, silently reading the stallion's mood.  "I can't do it this afternoon…" Sherlock said slowly, deliberately putting hesitance in his voice, "but perhaps later this evening?  I could meet you in town?"
"So?  What did she do to you, personally, I mean?" Sherlock pressed, eager to hear the facts from John's own lips.
Donovan would almost certainly object, but the ends justified the means.  More importantly, he didn't have time to waste coddling the feelings of others.
Instead of laughing, however, John gave him a puzzled look.  "Candyfloss?" John repeated, his brow furrowing in apparent confusion.  "What are you talking about?"
Sherlock had barely managed to avoid aspirating his tea across his laptop screen.  Setting aside the fact that consuming horsemeat was a somewhat taboo practice in the United States since horses were considered pets, rather than a food source, it had taken all of one Google search to discover that the headline was plagiarized verbatim from a child's storybook written by somebody named Jill Pinkwater.
John spent several minutes staring at Sherlock, not saying anything, just blinking, and Sherlock wondered if perhaps he'd gone too far, but then John burst into delighted giggles.
Sherlock immediately followed, vaulting nimbly over the gate and landing in the stall with an almost-soundless thud.  The sudden movement made Scotty snort and toss his head, but he couldn't do much else, restrained as he was by the ropes and drugs.
"Keeping in mind that the average human memory on visual matters is only sixty-two percent accurate, what can you tell me about the night that Johan Straker was killed?" Sherlock asked abruptly.
Underneath the images of the horse were photographs of the empty stall that had been taken after the horse had been removed.  Liberal smears of crimson daubed the walls and crusted the jagged edges of multiple broken planks.  In one photograph, a bloody handprint could be seen wrapped a shattered board, the grasp of a desperate man scrabbling futility for salvation or a weapon.  The straw bedding lining the stall's floor was churned and scattered, exposing swaths of bare concrete and more patches of blood dried a rusty brown.
"I know...it's a bit much, isn't it?" Molly said aloud, catching Sherlock's eyes and giving him a wry smile at his expression.
Sherlock looked up from his mobile screen to see the detective eyeballing him the way Mrs. Hudson did when Sherlock tracked mud and worse over her freshly-hoovered carpets.  "Sorry," Sherlock replied smoothly, saving the message to the drafts folder for later.  "I was requesting a copy for my own analysis."
The easy grin that accompanied statement was almost normal, but Sherlock wasn't fooled.  He hadn't missed the way that John's shoulders had tensed or the way he had swallowed hard.  John was worried, but before he could press for more information, John's features resumed their amused cast.  "So, back to cotton candy.  What do you propose we do about my 'plebeian palate' then?" John asked, tilting his head to one side, a teasing expression on his face.
Sherlock chuckled, even as he concentrated on massaging John's frenulum with the flat of his tongue.  It was arguably a bit of a stretch for 'Billy' to have mastered the art of fellatio, but if John pressed, he could easily come up with a believable explanation: perhaps he practiced on bananas or ice lollies or that horrible breaded and fried sausage-on-a-stick that the Americans were obsessed with…
“‘1988,” Harry corrected.  “He would have been too young in 1987.  Bobby-Jo Dobbs was the anticipated winner for the Juniors that year--lovely young man.  So polite.  When John Watson entered the arena on Meiringen’s Revenge and managed to qualify, it caught everybody by surprise.  Most probably assumed he was too young because he was so small.”
"Letters Candii Ross has received from the various professional organizations the Triple C leases bucking strings to.  All of them contain warnings that her status as an elite contractor is in peril.  The last page is a list of known business rivals, though one or two disgruntled former employees are also named."
"Fizzy Simpson, professional barrelman," the man introduced himself.  He thrust his right hand out towards Sherlock.
“I take it you speak from experience?” Sherlock asked dryly, shifting his feet into a more comfortable position and taking a covert sniff of John’s scent. Sweat, cattle, sun-warmed cotton and saddle oil all mingling to create a smell that was uniquely
Stamford’s tone was so deadpan that it took Sherlock and John both a moment to recognize what he was implying.  When they did, their reactions were simultaneous.
"Any time," John replied, reaching across the table and helping himself to Sherlock's limeade with brazenness that was somehow appealing, rather than aggravating.  "Ah, that's good," he added, setting the cup back down.
Sherlock held his breath, waiting until John’s breathing resumed its previous steady pattern before he looked at his phone, taking care to block the screen’s backlight with his body.
"Impressive, was what I was going to say," Sherlock corrected, being careful to suppress the first part of the word, rather than articulate it fully.  He returned her wry smile and ran a hand through his curls, fluffing them slightly.  "Is the fence like this all the way around?" Sherlock asked, his sharp eyes noting the hidden cameras mounted on the archway.  He wouldn't be surprised if there were hidden cameras mounted along the fence pillars as well.
Sherlock, meanwhile, began to prowl the perimeter of the lobby, seeing what details he could add to the mental file he'd already acquired on Sterndale.  The character bio that Anthea had assembled had included information about Doctor Sterndale's degree from Auburn University in some American state.  Alaska?  Alabama?  Something that started with the letter 'A'.  Sherlock had deleted the specific state as irrelevant; he could always do a search on his mobile if necessary.  Anthea's file had also mentioned Sterndale's experience as a traveling rodeo veterinarian before he'd set up his exclusive practice devoted to caring for high-caliber bulls and horses, but not much more than that.
"First, I informed her that regardless of whatever religiously-motivated text she and her husband subscribed to, equines could not read, and thus it was wasted on them.  Then I gave her a brief and scathing verbal lesson in proper turnout methodology.  I explained that mares and geldings are seldom put together in a pasture because of the very real risk that the gelding could injure the mare by trying to mate with her.  I also explained that the mare baring her teeth, kicking the gelding in the chest when he approached and watching him with her ears pinned back were horse-speak for 'I'm the boss' and 'back off!' rather than a domestic spat.  I told them that for the continued safety of her horses, she and her husband should look at separating them."
John didn't roll his eyes, but he did shake his head sharply from side to side.  "No.  There's no way in hell this is rabies.  Aside from the fact that Scotty was revaccinated for rabies only a few months ago, the symptoms are all wrong.  Rabies sets in slowly—initial symptoms may take anywhere from two weeks to six months to show up and once they do, it takes one to three days for the disease to progress from the prodromal period to the acute excitative stage.  It isn't like in the movies—where the animal is fine one moment and crazy the next.  If nothing else, I would expect to see excessive salivation, maybe tissue damage from him chewing at the bite site.  Greg?" John asked, turning his attention the police captain, "Was anything off about Scotty's behavior earlier today?  Or maybe yesterday?"
“I said, I always thought those scenes in CSI detective, police procedural dramas showing the main characters getting laid was something made up for ratings…or the Bond films…”
Sherlock winced; he'd already had one unpleasant encounter with the cactus himself and had firsthand experience knowledge of how much the macroscopic spines burned and how hard it was to remove them.  Still, it was no more than the idiot deserved.  "Serves him right," Sherlock said aloud.
The locks were combination-based.  Each had four digits, so each lock in theory had ten thousand possible combinations, but some of the numbers were more worn than others.  Figuring out the solutions would be a fairly simple matter, given sufficient time.  The sound of the water cut off and was replaced a moment later by the rattle of the shower curtain.  With a disgruntled sigh, Sherlock slid back out and pushed himself to his feet, double-checking to make sure that there were no tell-tale tracks in the cheap carpet.  It wouldn't do for John to catch him snooping.  He turned, fully intending to move to the kitchen and begin dishing up their food, but his attention was caught by the sight of the closed drawer in the entertainment center.  The drawer was deep, certainly large enough to contain files or a laptop.  He glanced at the bathroom door.  It was still tightly shut and judging by the rustling sounds, John was probably either toweling off or getting dressed.  Deciding to risk it, Sherlock pulled the drawer open.
“You couldn’t think of any other way, any way at all, that could have been a better route than this one?  Like, I don’t know, telling me?”
“Sebastian Moran,” and before John could interrupt, he continued, “He was the assassin trained on you.  I made sure he didn’t die peacefully, but sometimes I think he’s still out there, somehow, waiting to make his move.”
“About that,” Sherlock pulled out his phone, flipping through his search history, “I was thinking of trying something different.  There’s a place of few blocks from here we could walk to and sit down at.  It’s still open.”
Sherlock had noticed that after a few days and began to drink all the tea given to him immediately, John always coming to find an empty cup and taking it to the sink with a smile on his face.  Those were the times John liked the most, when Sherlock would see something that needed to be done and actually do it.  Now if only John could find some way to make the man clean up his own messes around the house.  Even he knew that was a long shot.  It was one thing for the man to drink the tea offered to him and a whole other thing for him to actually stop cluttering up the space.
They were sitting closer to each other on the sofa than was probably normal, their shoulders pressed against each others as John leaned into the taller man, their hands on the sofa between them, so close they could feet the warmth of the other.  Sometime during the last two minutes, John wasn’t really sure anymore at this point, their fingers found each other, weaving together as though they had done it millions of times before.
“It’s just simple science.  Your body-“ John cut him off with a wave of his arm, finally bringing it off his face.  He looked up at the taller man with a shake of his head.
“If you want to,” He was studying the table now as though it was the most interesting piece of furniture he had ever laid eyes on.  John quirked an eyebrow and mimicked Sherlock’s earlier move, holding it out for Sherlock.  The man looked up and leaned forward, taking the food into his mouth.  John felt Sherlock’s lips brush against his fingers and this time it was his turn to blush, almost dropping the handful, but he bit down on his bottom lip until Sherlock had the food under control in his own mouth.  John moved his hand away and cleaned it off on his napkin.  As he moved the fabric over the digits, he remembered quite clearly that Sherlock hadn’t cleaned his hand off after he had done his.  He glanced up at the detective, but his attention was already elsewhere, absently chewing away.
Sherlock glanced at the table, tapping his fingers against it, then back up at John, “I’m afraid I have… developed deeper feelings for you than that of friendship.”
John looked up as they stopped outside of the building, “The soul of Eritrean cuisine?  I’ve never even heard of Eritrea.”
Sherlock twirled with a snarl, snatching up his plate before John could move it again, along with a pair of chopsticks, “I never asked you to.”
The thought didn’t stay away, however, and popped up again a week later, when John was writing up their latest case for his blog.  His mind started to wander to their previous one and he decided to look up the restaurant and browse through their pages.  He was browsing the Guide page when he saw it, under the picture, “sharing food on a common plate signifies the bond of friendship.”  So that part had been true.  He wondered if Sherlock had read this entire page and memorized it.  No doubt he had already deleted it all, however.  His eye drifted to the side of the page, caught by the word ‘Kulaso’ and nearly stopped breathing when he saw it wasn’t so much for friendship, but a sign of affection.
It was uncertain who moved first, but they found each other in the middle, lips meeting in a chaste kiss.  They moved away, both equally shocked until John’s lips curved up in to his familiar smirk and he moved forward again, bringing his hands off of Sherlock’s to curve one around the back of Sherlock’s neck, while the other lay flat against his chest.  He pulled Sherlock down for another kiss, this one longer than the first, with John’s tongue flicking out to lightly trace over Sherlock’s lips.  He pulled away from the kiss shivering, his hands clenched into fists in front of him, not sure what to do with them.  John brought the fists up to kiss them, his lips leaving his hands feeling as though they were on fire, which quickly built up and flared through his entire body.  Sherlock was certain he was blushing like the virgin he was, if John’s smirk was anything to go by.
Sherlock smiled, reaching in and dipping his piece of injera into another dish, “I believe the saying is ‘a magician never reveals his secrets?”
“Should old acquaintance be forgot,” John started singing and Sherlock recognized the tune, “and never brought to mind?”  He hiccupped and wiped at his face.  Sherlock was startled to see tears forming in the doctor’s eyes.  He turned his body toward John, trying to figure out what to dot.
He was about five seconds from a panic attack, followed closely by heart failure when bits and pieces of the night before came rushing back, slamming into him like a train.  He felt woozy, but extremely hungry.  A brief memory of puking his guts up came to the surface and he groaned, rolling onto his back and throwing an arm over his eyes.  There was another groan from the other occupant of the bed and Sherlock shifted, twisting around in the covers to sit up.  John didn’t move from his position, arm still over his face in a dramatic position.  He knew Sherlock was looking at him, but he didn’t want to look back.  Weight left the bed and he heard Sherlock’s bare feet pad to his side of the bed.
“On the contrary, I’m glad I can still predict some things about you.  I was afraid you were making yourself immune to my deductions.”
“Sharing the food on a plate is also a sign of friendship.”  He was definitely blushing now, and John decided to make it his personal mission later to figure out just why the detective was getting so red faced over this.  But, for now, he was just concerned about all this sudden need to reinforce their friendship, through food no less.
He waited patiently as John served the food and reached for his helping when John was done.  John pulled it away from him, so he reached for it again.  It moved out of his reach again and he looked up with a frown, only to see John staring at him, head slightly tilted to the side, brows drawn in concern, and lips slightly pursed.  Sherlock’s frown deepened at the obvious concern written all over John’s body.  He didn’t need the man’s concern, so he turned to go back to the sofa without his food.
“It’s obviously not if I’m even bothering to ask you, Sherlock,” John smiled softly, giving Sherlock wrist a small squeeze.  “So, how about we go to that restaurant again sometimes soon and try out that Kulaso again.  Maybe next time I will get the meal with tea.”
“You okay?”  John’s eyes never left his and Sherlock swallowed heavily.  Was he okay with this.  He swooped down, leaving a quick kiss on John’s lips as a reply before settling back on the couch again, his food completely forgotten and growing colder by the minute now.  John picked his own back up again and turned so he could lean his back again Sherlock’s side.  Sherlock lifted his arm to let John under it, and let his fingers run down John ‘s right arm, rubbing circles in to his elbow.  Now there was no chance for either of them to concentrate on what was playing on the television, so lost in the heat of one another that it was like everything else had simply disappeared.
“Come here.”  John said, tapping the table opposite him.  Sherlock got up obediently and sat down in the chair, looking across the table at John, fingers tapping at the wood.
“It’s nothing like that.  I’m not going to do anything awful.  But, if it’s uncomfortable to you when I do attempt it, just let me know and I’ll stop.”  A pause, “It’s nothing like any of the scenarios you’re thinking of John.  It’s actually rather tame for once.”
That got John’s interest, “You said that earlier, that whatever I order would work for what you wanted.  What did you mean by that?”
“Oh, no,” Sherlock sat up straighter, “No.  Nothing like that, I didn’t mean for it to come out that way.”
“I got you the usual, even though you never told me to.  I figured if you didn’t eat it tonight, you could just keep it in the fridge and eat it at a later date.  Or use it for an experiment, I really don’t care.”  John’s voice drifted around the corner and Sherlock slowly unfolded, walking into the kitchen to retrieve his food.  He wasn’t really that hungry, even if it was a break between cases, but he liked the quiet times together with John.  It felt like old times, back before the fall and before John headbutted him in the face after he returned.  He gave his nose a sympathetic touch as he padded into the kitchen.
John threw himself at Sherlock, pulling at him to keep him in the room, “Hurry up and just do it or Mrs. Hudson will be the first one back.”
He was talking about two different times now, but the way he talked made it seem like they were one and the same and Sherlock had to look away from the man, focusing back on the TV.  But his fingers squeezed around John’s in what he hoped was comfort and was pleased when John squeezed back.  One minute now.  Suddenly, John began to hum a tune and Sherlock looked back at him in amazement.  John was looking at the TV, but the touch of his hand was letting Sherlock know all his attention was on him.
Even though the rodeo wasn't due to open for several more hours, the fairground was swarming with people.  In the distance, vendors were setting up booths, tables and portable amusement rides.  Up closer, cowboys and cowgirls were unloading trailers full of horses, cattle and sheep.  Others individuals were busy coiling up ropes, filling water tanks and raking the floor of an outdoor arena.  A group of men in luridly coloured outfits and cowboy hats was clustered around a group of equally-vibrant painted barrels stood off to one side.  An exceptionally stocky man was wearing a green cowboy hat and a shirt that young Boy George would have considered fashionable.  He was busy talking to a clean shaven man wearing a white polo shirt and holding a microphone.  An extremely tall black woman in a navy polo was videotaping the exchange.
"You are entirely overdressed," Sherlock complained as he squirmed underneath John so he could take advantage of the sudden space to work while another part of his mind gleefully reveled in the casual display of John's strength.
Donovan spent a few more minutes exchanging pleasantries with the other adults and making promises to update them with any new information before concluding the call.  The moment the screen went black, Donovan grabbed her cup and took a long, noisy draught, one worthy of an Yank tourist visiting an Irish pub for the first time, or an Aussie in general.
"Are you sure this is okay, Billy?" John asked, watching Sherlock closely, apprehension rife in his tone.  John's posture was military straight and his chin was up, a pose Sherlock had learned to decipher as John feeling acutely uncomfortable.  "There are picnic tables in the common area if you'd rather eat outside—"
"That depends on how closely you follow my instructions," Mike replied affably, utterly unperturbed by the glower Sherlock shot him.  "With a Grade 1 sprain, you're looking at something between two and six weeks of healing time—assuming you follow my instructions to take it easy and don't reinjure it by doing something foolish.  Do you know the RICE protocol? Rest, ice, compression, elevation?"
But this time, John’s chatter—instead of being amusing—had increasingly grated on his nerves the longer they’d walked.  Whether it was because John felt the need to impress Sherlock with his knowledge, leftover insecurity from encountering his rival, Baz Moran, or simply because John felt apprehensive about upcoming competition, Sherlock didn’t know, nor did he especially care.   He already knew how bronco rides were judged, but John insisted on going into the process in obsessive detail.  After enduring almost ten minutes of John explaining the merits and drawbacks of different bucking styles, ranging from ‘arm jerkers,’ and ‘bailouts,’ to ‘chute fighters’ and ‘honkers,’ Sherlock had descended into his mind palace and tuned out John’s prattle in favor of The Work’s siren call.
"My ex-sister-in-law.  She's also a criminal defense lawyer.  She's the one who pointed out that first, suing Riley would take a lot more money than I have to spend, and two, what good would it do?  If it wasn't Riley and her PRESS gang, it'd just be somebody else," John concluded as he straightened up and turned his attention back to the Humvee.
Sherlock contemplated tracing the sunbeam’s path with his mouth.  John would taste deliciously salty at the nape of his neck, at the hollow of his back, at the crease where John’s arse met his thigh.  Probably a bit like cinnamon, too.  His bare skin would either feel like silk or like fine velvet, depending on which part Sherlock brushed with his lips.  Sherlock swallowed, saliva pooling in his mouth.  He could awaken John like this.  John would no doubt wrinkle his nose adorably the way a kitten would when irked, then stretch languorously like a large cat before pouncing on Sherlock to return the favor of lips and teeth and tongue against soft skin or pebbling nipples...
"Wipe that look off your face," John mock-scolded.  "Don't think I didn't notice you tapping along in time with the beat," John added, directing his gaze to Sherlock's errant left hand.  "So...do you?"
"Billy then.  Come on back; we'll get you taken care of."  Mike paused long enough to pick up the manilla folder John had filled out from the receptionist's desk, before ushering John and Sherlock through the door and down a short hallway.
"Yeah," Donovan said, her lip curling in contempt.  "I got the alert early this morning," she explained as she accepted the proffered folder.  She set it back in a stack with several others before typing in an internet address on her keyboard one-handed with a speed that Anthea would have admired.  The other hand resumed its death grip on the coffee mug.
Still grimacing, Sherlock leaned back against the hard plastic chair back.  He brought his fingers to his lips, his hands clasped in his habitual thinking position.  More comprehensive research would have to wait until he could unpack his laptop, but he could at least review his mental notes on the case while he waited for his ride.  It would give him a chance to analyze his current store of data and serve as a welcome cushion from the irritating, nigh overwhelming stimulus of the crowded airport terminal.
Sherlock nodded sagely, committing the relevant details of Candii Ross's tirade to memory for further investigation later.  "And you think somebody is deliberately targeting your business because of your successful bucking strings?"
"Who?" Sherlock pressed, thinking of John's comment about strangers standing out just a few moments prior.  He leaned further over the railing, trying to discern the person John had observed from the direction John's eyes had been facing.  There were only two possible candidates: a stocky figure holding a pole topped with a green flag and a man mounted on horseback.
“The steers, how they’re acting I mean.” John explained, uncrossing his arms to point at a steer in the corner that was shaking its head from side to side threateningly.  “They just seem...off.”
Sherlock blinked slowly and ran his tongue over his teeth, a nagging suspicion building in his mind at his brother's tone and word choice.  "You're being deliberately vague…what,
"John," Sherlock whispered, purposely leaning close so that his warm breath would brush against John's ear.  "What does 'faecal encephalopathy' mean?"
"I'm sorry," the vet apologized, his expression abashed.  "I didn't recognize you at first.  For you?  Of course I have a moment." He gave the horse's neck one final pat before turning to face her.  "And call me John, please," he added with a wink and a friendly grin.  He removed his hat and ruffled a hand through his short, blond hair before redonning it and tucking his thumbs into the loops of his jeans.  The movement drew subtle attention to the championship belt buckle he wore as he leaned back against the stall door.  Tilting his head, John raised an eyebrow, his dark blue eyes intent on hers.  "What can I do for you?"
"More like we are trying to make sure the chain of custody for any potential evidence is preserved," Donovan replied smoothly.
Sherlock stood up harshly, his chair clattering as he stalked away, “And this is precisely why I didn’t want to tell you.  Since the feeling is not mutual, you will just ridicule me for having these feelings in the first place.  I do not appreciate-“
“It depends on the food you want, vegetarian or meat.  Plus, some have dessert or tea with the meal.”  John stared back at the options while Sherlock got out his phone, fiddling with the buttons.
They had moved the sofa over, scooting the arm chairs out of the way so they could sit on the sofa together, the TV moved out in front of them.  Right now, an hour away from midnight, it was boring.  Nothing but reporters talking away about how beautiful the lights were this year.  Basically the same things they said every year.  John sighed and tipped back the glass, finishing the wine in his glass before pouring himself another.  He could feel Sherlock’s gaze on him, but he chose to ignore it, already taking a sip from his glass.  They talked a little, trying to catch up even more on what they had done during the past few years without each other.  John had to admit that Sherlock’s stories were a lot more riveting than his own, full of failed dating attempts and yelling at the grocery store machines again, but at least they made Sherlock smile.  He had almost forgotten how much he loved Sherlock’s smile.
