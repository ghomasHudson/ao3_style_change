It was late afternoon, Mr. Holmes and Mr. Watson had dragged a reluctant Mrs. Holmes to the canteen for something to eat, when Sherlock heard rustling coming from the bed next to him.
Lestrade was still talking, but Sherlock had stopped listening. McCall had just greeted the other driver when it appeared he got a phone call. Something wasn’t right. The fence ran back to his car, and McCall, who had only been on the phone for not even thirty seconds, was looking around wildly. They’d been tipped off.
*******
“I know you would, and that’s why I’m so thankful for you.” Mrs. Holmes said softly, pulling John into a tight hug before releasing him and wiping her eyes. “Now I want you to promise to keep taking good care of my boy.” She smiled. “What you two have is special, it doesn’t just happen every day.”
– quite the opposite.” Sherlock panted, sliding one hand into John’s hair, and the other into the waistband of John’s pants, rocking his hips up to meet John’s thrusts. “Now please –
Needless to say, they did manage to break their record by a very generous margin that night. And it was only the beginning, they had a lifetime of nights ahead of them too fill with passion, love, and being ridiculously, blissfully happy. It was going to be a good life, John was sure of that.
“And is she right?” Sherlock asked. “Am I the one for you?” He already knew John was it for him, his ‘one’, but he’d never…
“We could
“There’s absolutely nothing to be worried about,” Dr Cook said, trying to reassure John, “Sherlock’s new room is only a few doors away, just up the hallway. I’m still his doctor, and he’ll be getting the same exact level of care and attention. His brother felt a less exposed room would be better. It’s larger too, has its own bathroom, so that should be more comfortable for you, since I’m assuming you’re going to be staying as well.”
Oh. That… that wasn’t what John was expecting.
“So what if they catch us in here, or as we’re leaving?”
“Obviously.” Sherlock said impatiently, cutting off the rest of the question. “Husband, partner, love above all others. I do.”
“Mmmm, yes.” Sherlock hummed, his hands coming to cover John’s, “I, however, am anything but, so come morning, please forgive me should I give into some of my better demons.”
“Sherlock, the owner gives us free chips every time we go in.”
Grinning, John tilted his chin up just enough to once again brush his lips against Sherlock’s. “Wouldn’t dream of it,” he hummed, cutting off the mini-rant.
Hollowing his cheeks, and a few hard sucks later, Sherlock was writhing underneath him.
that is was; so for the first time since the call, John began to feel hopeful. Sherlock was going to wake up, at any moment his eyes were going to open, he was going to see John, he was going to speak, and John was going to get him back. It was only a matter of time, and all John had to do was wait.
Sherlock nodded.
Not bothering to say anything, Sherlock got up, cold cases were better than nothing. He was just about to reach for the door handle, when Lestrade’s voice stopped him.
“Nothing, it was nothing. I was just thinking out loud. Word vomit, that’s all.” John replied, turning to look back down the bank, towards Lestrade who was on his phone and some other officers were standing with a handcuffed Simon McCall. He couldn’t risk Sherlock seeing, couldn’t risk Sherlock reading the end of that sentence. “Come on, we should probably see what’s going on with them. See if there’s any sort of hold up.”
“Is Mrs. Rachlin alright?” John asked, cutting off whatever Sherlock was about to say.
“So how’s the coagulation experiment going?” He called over his shoulder, taking care to avoid the sample trays as he grabbed a bottle of water from the refrigerator. They probably should invest in a mini-fridge or something; blood next to food was a bit not good.
“They do. What are you trying to say, Bumble?” He knew exactly what Sherlock was getting at, but he wanted Sherlock to say it.
“Only for you, John. Only for you.” Sherlock sighed.
John opened his eyes, his smile broadening. “I always enjoy myself when I’m with you, too.” He said softly, and Sherlock’s heart stuttered in his chest. Oh yes, whatever this was, it was definitively more significant than ‘just friends.’
“Knew… knew I’d find it eventually.” John chuckled, out of breath.
“But what about your friend?” Sherlock asked, dipping down to nip and suck at John’s neck, he tasted of clean sweat, and something else, something unique. Sherlock wanted more. “I thought you were only here to keep an eye on him.”
“I guess you’re right. And even if I do mess up, hopefully my dance partner is the forgiving sort.” John smiled, giving Sherlock a playful nudge with his shoulder.
“And I told you I’m not a dancer.” John’s words didn’t have quite the amount of bite he had hoped for.
Not knowing what else to do, Sherlock sighed. “Fine. Last Friday, after I wrapped up that nanny stalking case for you, I… ah… I met someone.”
“Fun?” Sherlock frowned. “Like you want to go to dinner and the cinema or something?”
“Good.”
“No one’s going to want to be my friend anyway. No one wanted to last year when we were the same age, and no one a year older will either.” Sherlock muttered. “Not that I want any anyway.” And he didn’t, he didn’t need any friends.
“But, Harry is short for Harriet. Harry’s my older sister, not brother.”
“Wait, wait!” Sherlock stops them, his hands lightly pushing on John’s shoulders
“Me too, and congratulations.”
“You are?” John asked, he sounded nervous, he sounded unsure. How could he be unsure? How could he not know how much Sherlock wanted him, how much he…
*******
That wasn’t strictly true, people were probably going to take second or even third looks at Sherlock, but the blue and orange bird shorts would have nothing to do with it. For someone so thin, Sherlock was surprisingly well muscled. It wasn’t the bulky muscles gained from hours of rigorous strength training John was used to seeing on the men in the army, but a lean muscle with which some were just naturally blessed. And the faint scaring left over from Sherlock’s burns that lined half of his otherwise pale and pristine torso just added to the picture. Yes, people were definitely going to take notice, though perhaps John shouldn’t be focusing so much on his flatmate and friend’s physique.
“I’m supposed to just find him, am I?” Sherlock huffed. “I wouldn’t even know where to start looking.”
“Ok, now I know no one would ever say that about Sherlock voluntarily.” Theo’s condescending snicker ripping its way through. “Come on, how much is he paying you to be his ‘boyfriend’ and sing his praises?”
“You’re not,” Sherlock shrugged, “but you are the only one who works at Gallen Family Medical, and has a sister named Harriet.”
Sherlock bit back a moan. Jesus Christ that felt amazing. “Age before beauty?” He tried to frown, but John’s lips were making it very difficult think of anything other than getting John’s lips on other parts of him, and getting his lips on John. “What does that have to do with anything?”
The cases started almost immediately. That first wonderful morning, after they…
“I can take you back to see him now if you like, but before I do,” Dr. Drier paused, “there’s the matter of how Sherlock got these injuries. Now he told the nurse he sustained them when he fell whilst trying to climb through a second-story window, however…”
“If by ‘disturbing preoccupation’ you mean I think you should eat every day, then yeah. And if I’m a hobbit, then that makes you an elf.”
“I can’t believe I’m actually doing this, barging into a crime scene. And how was she only discovered now? It’s seven o’clock at night.” John mutters, trying to keep his voice low so as to not disturb the officers and forensics technicians in the room.
“You’re moving him already? He’s not even awake yet, he’s still on the vent.” John said incredulously. Sherlock was nowhere near ready to be moved.
God it was true, there was no one John wanted to spend time with more than Sherlock. And yes, maybe what he was feeling for Sherlock went well beyond that of a best friend. And maybe he was saying too much, but god, Sherlock had to know what his friendship meant to John. He had to realize that John spent almost all his free time with him, willingly, more than willingly. He had to know that seeing him there at the game was better than winning twenty championships.
“Former friend, and yes he was. It took me a while, but got treatment. I’ve been sober for three years. I’m clean, completely clean.” Sherlock stressed, feeling he had to reassure John.
“What? Yeah him. I mean, yes, I’m John Watson.”
“And you say I’m insatiable.” John said, and rolled his hips - he wasn’t quite ready for another round yet but just give him time – earning himself a gasp from Sherlock. “Not to mention,” he continued, “we’re going to be stuck traveling all day tomorrow, and I plan to have you has many times as I can before it’s all airports and airplanes.” And secretly he’d been hoping to tire Sherlock out, so that he’d be a more agreeable traveling companion. Not that he’d ever admit that to the detective.
“I would have passed.” John mumbled. It had been a nightmare of a class, but it wasn’t that bad.
, Molly insisted on accompanying Sherlock home. What was it with the women in his life? First his mum, now Molly thinking him so fragile he needed a minder, even if he did lay sobbing on a mortuary floor not too long ago.
“I’m sorry, not that it’s not nice to see you again,” John said after the silence between them began to stretch, “but what exactly are you doing here?”

Sherlock retort died on his tongue. John had never used his full name before, he didn’t even know John knew his full name.  It took several moments for him to come back to himself. “I – I said no!” he stuttered.
“Hey, look at me. You didn’t mess anything up.” John said, easing Sherlock’s fingers out of inky curls. “Grabbing each other at a crime scene and rushing home to pin each other against walls is great and all, but we’re not hormonal teenagers anymore who get carried away with things like that, and don’t think things through. We’re adults, we live together, we work together. We need to make sure we’re on the same page about this, and not just getting caught up because of the adrenaline and a mutual attraction. I want this, I want you, but we need to really know what we’re getting into before we end up where we were heading. And believe me, I want to end up there.”
“Yes, fine.” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I don’t know what I’d do without you.” If only John knew how true that was.
“Well, if medicine doesn’t pan out, you have the makings of a professional footballer, so you can always have that on which to fall back.”
100% Grade A schmoopy smut.
so get started.” Sherlock begged, starting to writhe beneath him. Christ he was gorgeous like that, sweat starting to bead on his forehead, his dark curls growing damp; his mouth open, gasping for air; his eyes, oh god his eyes…
“Obviously.” Bit Sherlock. “You didn’t think I’d actually leave it all to the police, did you?”
When John returns with two cups of even he doesn't know, Sherlock begins scanning the room, finding targets, and spewing their life stories for John.
Sherlock shook his head. “I’m sorry, what?”
“Absolutely. Sherlock, hey, Sherlock, look at me,” John said softly, and Sherlock felt John’s free hand cupping his cheek, tilting his head up to meet John’s deep, dark, honest blue eyes. “From the bottom of my heart, I meant every single word. You are the most brilliant, funny, wonderful, gorgeous, amazing man I have ever met. And every day I have to pinch myself just to remind myself that I’m not dreaming, and I really am lucky enough to call you mine. I’m the luckiest man alive.”
John thought.
– Oh Guuaaa!
“No, no. Ms. Yao and her staff were neither victims nor perpetrators,” Sherlock assured him. Honestly, he thought John was cleverer than to think Sherlock would allow such an operation to continue. “No, there was a sunbed place across the street. This restaurant just proved to be an excellent vantage point, and Ms. Yao was quite accommodating, allowing me to sit and observe the goings on across the street for hours.”
“Wait!” Sherlock blurted, abruptly pulling out of the kiss. “I’ve just solved a case!”
“You approve then?” John asked, inching closer and looking up at Sherlock through his eyelashes. Sherlock’s heart skipped yet another beat. “I had noticed the way you react when I slip in to Captain Watson mode on cases.”
? He was fine alone… he was fine.
“I see.” The man said. A smile flashed across his face, and for a second, it almost looked like one of pride. “Then in that case, we’re done here. Jacobs will drive you home.”
“…And so I believe I owe my parents both an apology for throwing that temper tantrum, and a sincere thank you,” Sherlock said, looking out into the small group of friends and family, and finding his parents smiling back at him. “Had you not refused to give into my childish demands twenty years ago, had you allowed me to skip ahead the several grades like I wanted, had you not put your feet down and insisted I only go ahead the one, I don’t believe we would be where we are today. If I had gotten my way, who knows when or more likely even if, I’d ever have met the man standing next to me today, my classroom buddy, my best friend, my partner in crime, and now most importantly, my new husband, John Watson. Mum, Dad, thank you. Thank you for knowing what was best for me, and in doing so, leading me to John. I can never thank you enough.”
“Yep! Oh, and make sure to order a bottle of Champagne and something sweet for dessert. We’re celebrating, after all.”
“Come on, Greg,” John sighs “How many times do I have to say it, Sherlock and I….”
“John, when Mum and Dad passed, I was always sorry that all you had by way of family was me. But today that all changed; today Sherlock became your family. When I look at the two of you, and I see the way you look at each other, I know that you’ve finally found the happiness you deserve, that you finally have the family you deserve.
“Agree to disagree?”
Sherlock flushed, and even in the odd lighting of the club, John could see his high cheekbones start to turn pink. His whole demeanor changed. “I… um… I’m sorry.” He said awkwardly, as if unused to the words. “I… uh… I do that some times, go a bit too far.”
“Oh, am I your friend?” Did John want them to be friends? Sherlock couldn’t say he was particularly averse to the idea, it was just… well, he didn’t really expect it.
“Humble too, I see” John snorts. “Well, I’ve known I was going to be a doctor since I was a kid. Figured out I could heal people when I was thirteen, neighbor’s dog attacked her and I helped fix her leg, and I never looked back.”
Things soon grew quiet, John was jotting down notes of some sort – obviously for when he wrote up the case for the blog – and Lestrade kept staring out the window, not even looking away as he reached into a bag of crisps over and over. Sherlock was just feeling himself start to go stir crazy from the wait, when DI’s phone pinged with a text.
That being said, I hope you enjoy this chapter. The boys are away from campus, overdue introductions are made, and even more overdue revelations are had (though maybe not
John stood in the doorway, watching as their handful of guests milled around the Holmes’ backyard. He and Sherlock had decided to keep it small, just close friends and family, and since neither of them were church and reception hall kind of people, they gladly accepted when Sherlock’s parents offered to host. Well, it was more they didn’t argue when Mrs. Holmes insisted on ‘throwing her baby boy the wedding he and his John deserve.’  Mrs. Hudson and Mrs. Holmes were already in their seats with handkerchiefs at the ready.
"I wouldn’t say that his playing is keeping them at bay. It’s more the music calms me down and allows me to fall back asleep, when before when it would happen, I’d be awake for the rest of the night.”
behind Sherlock’s eyes, but before he could think what, it was gone.
“That’s how long I’ve been clean for, five and a half years.”
“You won’t have called me if it was just a cut and dry assault and burglary, there’s something interesting about it. So… what is it?”
“When I ‘charged into that burning building with a total disregard towards my own safety’,” John said, paraphrasing the article, “I had no idea that I’d end up finding you, that I’d end up with a husband and a whole new life.”
Now, on to the fic: We pick up right were we left off.
“Well you need the answer to four in order to do five.”
“You know what, never mind. I’ve got some more reading to do, so I’ll see you… I’ll see you tomorrow.” John mumbled, getting up and heading for his room. “Just please think about what I’ve said.”
“So I can be at least half-way comfortable and warm.” John chuckled. “The snow seems to have slowed, but I don’t think they’ll get transport up and running until the morning. I was hoping you’d let me kip on your couch tonight, but I could probably make it back to my place without becoming the next Ötzi.” He really didn’t want to leave yet. He wanted more time with Sherlock, even if it was only until tomorrow morning when there weren’t any more excuses for him to stay.
“I’d – I’d like to see you try.” Sherlock stumbled trying to recapture some of his earlier teasing bravado.
To put in simply, the rest of evening turned out fantastic. Surrounded by some of his closest friends – both old and new – watching the man who had turned his life upside and captured his heart, argue about the legalities of
aspect of our relationship,” John smirked. “Though I’d never expect you to understand that.”
It was true, he did. But it was an Irish Setter, and it looked so happy when it caught a whiff of the roast beef that Sherlock couldn’t very well deny it the sandwich. He wasn’t even all that hungry at the time.
Sherlock stared at her for a few seconds, trying hard to reconcile the girl who carried a kitten folder with the one before him, innocently offering to perjure herself as if she was offering to loan him a pen. “I can’t let you do that.” He said finally. “You’ve already given a sworn statement, it would look suspicious you changing your story now. They’ll also wonder why you didn’t call for help.”
“It’s just, that’s not what people normally say. And certainly nobody appreciates my deductions.”
“More –
Before long the need to breath gets to great, and John forces himself to pull away from Sherlock’s now kiss swollen lips. “I don’t remember saying anything about a relationship. I’m no stranger to a one night stand. Now, tell me about this ‘get off and get out’ lifestyle you lead.”
“Thanks,” John hummed, looking away, “that’s nice of you to say.”
fucked me unconscious. How did you do that?... Hey, hey stop laughing! This is not funny!” Sherlock scowled, though the flushed cheeks and sex hair lessened the effect slightly.
“Lydia… Lydia, calm down, he’s over here.”
“Yeah. That – that might be… good.” Sherlock hummed, looking away. “This is the method someone intent on killing me would use, right?”
After training, John is sent to Afghanistan and quickly gains a reputation. Due to his ability, he is thought to be nothing short of a miracle worker, saving the lives of those many others wrote off as lost causes. If a solider comes in with even the faintest pulse, sometimes not even that, they’re brought to John. It gets the point that the definition of death is ‘if John Watson can’t bring them back.’ He even starts being sent into the field to give more immediate help to those injured. The army dreads when his leave rolls around, losing their best doctor for the duration. Though they don’t have to be without for long, John taking minimal leave, and often cutting it short. After John’s mother passes away three years after he joined, John finds there’s not much London has to offer.
“That’s fine.” Sherlock said, peppering John’s lips with water droplet kisses. “I’m more than happy with this, just this, right here.” Then, wrapping his arms around John’s waist again, he slide down to rest his head on John’s chest.
"Yes. 221B Baker Street.”
It happened on a Saturday afternoon, just a regular, unassuming Saturday afternoon. John was sitting in the living room of Harry’s flat going through some old e-mails, when his phone rang. He didn’t recognize the number.
“My lips are sealed… Have you guys heard anything new about John? I’m assuming they’re bringing him back here.”
What happens when everything you've ever wanted is within your reach? What happens when everything you've ever wanted wants you just as much?
(See the end of the chapter for
Without saying a word, Sherlock stripped down to his vest and pants, and crawled onto the bed and settled himself in John’s lap, his back against John’s knees. It was now or never, he told himself, and took John’s face in his hands. His heart felt like it was going to pound out of his chest.
Nine days after
“It’s just what? I am rather busy.”
“You don’t…”
.” Bill huffed, gesturing out towards all the club patrons, to society in general. “You’ve been home for six months, and it’s been over a year since –”
“No… no I didn’t. There may have been something else.”
Sherlock didn’t bother looking up from the file he was reading, and just made a non committal humming sound.
“Excellent. Let’s go!” Sherlock beamed, tugging John towards the door.
“Mr. Watson, please.” Lestrade said quietly. “We probably wouldn’t even be investigating if it weren’t for Sherlock. He found all the inconsistencies, he brought them to us.”
It wasn’t like anything could actually happen between them. Right from the beginning Sherlock had made it pretty clear that he was committed to his work. And even if he were interested in dating, he’d surely have his pick of men, John would hardly be his first choice. Prematurely aged, with one too many scars – both figurative and literal – John was hardly anyone’s first choice, let alone someone like Sherlock. He probably wouldn’t even make it in the top twenty.
It wasn’t right, it wasn’t right at all. There was so much blood, there was blood everywhere. John wasn’t that big, how could there be so much blood? And he was pale; oh god, he was so pale. John shouldn’t be pale, Sherlock was the pale one; John was always outside, his skin was always meant to be sun kissed.
“Congratulations on what?”
“The invitation grants you a guest, so you should have one.” It hurt to even say the words, but who was he to deny John something – someone – he wanted? “This doesn’t seem like the type of event you’d wish to attend alone. It’s fine. It’s perfectly fine.”
“Yes, I thought along the hetero-normative lines of our society, and assumed Harry was your brother, and not your sister.”
“So,” Sherlock prompted when John still didn’t speak, “How did I do?”
Not only had the man seen him, but now he had stopped dancing and was making his way towards the bar, towards John.
“Me, he’s waiting for me.” Mr. Holmes came to a stop next to Sherlock, straight backed and collected, though Sherlock could read the exhaustion on his face. “I’m so sorry about this Constable… Butler. I am to understand Sherlock was found to have broken into his school?”
It was Sherlock’s turn to frown. “What’s so surprising, I can take an interest in other people’s lives.”
Well that was patently false, Sherlock was nothing if not in complete – nearly complete – control of his transport.
John and Whitney get to know each other, and a friendship blossoms.
Tuesday transitioned into Wednesday, which became Thursday, and John still hadn’t gotten Sherlock’s number. After lecture that day, another student had stopped him with a question, so he didn’t even get to catch Sherlock then. He could have always looked it up in Sherlock’s student file – a benefit to being a teaching assistant – but that just felt like an invasion of his privacy. So at eight twenty-seven Thursday evening, John stood outside Carrows gym, not knowing if Sherlock was even going to show.
“Fine,” Sherlock grinned, “John can move in with me.”
Sherlock is off the couch and towering over John within a matter of seconds. “You’re going to do what?!” he exclaims.
“But how did you figure out it was him?”
Sherlock, growling more so than speaking, surged up to close that last bit of distance. “Oh God, yes!”
“Hmmm, agree to disagree.” John hummed, and pulled Sherlock back down with him to the bed, his lips putting a stop to any further argument.
Could these two idiots be anymore obvious and oblivious. I hope the boys jacking it wasn't too off putting, but this is rated 'E' (more E stuff to come obviously) so it couldn't be too much of a shock.
“I really didn’t get that good of a look at the first man, only for a few seconds as he was running past me and when he ran out of the house.” John said to the young police constable.
wouldn't
“That, John, is because you are the consummate gentleman. It’s a quality rarely seen today.”
Met because of an explosion, moved in together to avoid an interfering older brother, and got together on the banks of the Thames after catching a jewel thief. With a courtship like that, can the relationship work?
Finally reaching the end of the hall, Sherlock pushed through the door to the pathology office to find… nothing. It was empty, Molly’s uncle wasn’t there.
*******
Fantastic, Lestrade was going to broadcast all of Sherlock’s personal failings to the world. He knew he shouldn’t have told him anything.
“Yes, yes. I should probably let Richard know how everything went anyway. Silly man’s probably going spare not knowing, and he’ll insist on knowing every little detail.” She chuckled and shook her head. “Holmes men!”
*******
John frowned further. Sherlock wouldn’t have…  No, there was no way… Even for him, that would have been reckless
Sherlock shivered as John ran a warm hand down his back. “No, just the one.”
“Everything and more. It was fantastic, John.” Sherlock sighed. “Making love to my fiancé was fantastic.”
“With their promises made, and rings exchanged, I must now ask if anyone present has any just cause for why these two should not be joined?” John failed to stifle a laugh as Sherlock turned to glower at their guests, as if daring someone to speak.
fell asleep on
*******
Sherlock was only half paying attention, his concentration primarily focused on the pig’s feet dissolving on the kitchen table. “A double what?” he hummed.
“Right… Sherlock Holmes.” John attempted to sit up slightly to properly address Sherlock, but Sherlock was having none of that, so John just resettled himself on Sherlock’s chest. “Will you do me the honor of being my plus one to an anniversary party I have to go to tomorrow night?”
“And I’m going to assume that’s Sherlock’s?”
“Aren’t they all easily identifiable to you?” John teased. “Come on, since we’re both done for the day, you can help order the takeaway.”
“Suit yourself.”
with John – someone who wanted him one hundred percent – for the first time, it meant something now. Sherlock was free to let go, open himself completely to another person, to even be vulnerable, because he knew there was someone there to catch him, hold him. John would never hurt him. John would never take advantage. John would never hurt him.
As they kissed – tongues sweeping every inch of each other’s mouths – John could feel Sherlock hot and ridged between them. Well, he couldn’t have that. John was the most generous of lovers, and he couldn’t go tanking his reputation now.
“Very” John hummed. “They don’t deserve it, they don’t deserve you.”
“Not sure pretending it didn’t happen is going to help. But sure, go for it.”
“Yeah, only, ah, only if you want it to be.” John blushed.
“There’s probably not much room down here. He might not have had any other option.” John suggested.
wouldn't
“I’m his…” God, what was he exactly?  “We’re friends.”
John didn’t know what he was expecting when he slid into the backseat of the town car, but it wasn’t a man probably only in his mid-twenties. He was dressed well, his suit probably cost more than John’s rent – several months of rent – which gave the man an air of authority, but he was still very young.
Sherlock frowned and grumbled something about the inefficiency of chlorine before his head disappeared back behind the curtain. “Even if the pool water is sanitary, which a strongly suspect it isn’t, I’m going to look like a drowned rat. And this swimsuit you bought me, it’s all wrong.”
And just like that, the moment was lost, Sherlock wouldn’t even look at him. Whatever had been about to happen between them was gone for good. Sherlock being attacked right after the evening in the gym, the countless half moments started and stopped throughout the past six weeks, Mycroft’s text interrupting them that afternoon, and now Mike forgetting his computer. Maybe the universe didn’t want John to be with Sherlock. Maybe all they would ever get was that one amazing night, and this one breathless snog. Maybe all they were meant to have was friendship. Fuck.
“So does that mean you’d be willing to host more dinner parties?” John asked, one eyebrow cocked, a teasing smile spread across his face.
“Eeh,” Sherlock shrugged, “he managed to get the job done well enough.”
“John? Don’t tell me you already lost your key. We’ve only been here two weeks.”
“The phrase is better angels, not demons.”
They kissed for a long time, but it never progressing past kissing – there was all the time in the world for that later.
Sherlock barely spared a glance at the speaker before turning back to his drink without a word. Redhead, early twenties, trying to make her potential boyfriend jealous, clearly had a thing for 'older' men, and was looking for a protector and provider. Barking up the wrong tree didn’t even begin to cover it, she couldn’t have found someone less interested if she tried. Sherlock would have almost felt sorry for her if she wasn’t laying it on so think and leaning so far forward that he could practically see down to her belly button piercing. Fortunately for him, she quickly got the hint, and the next three people to approach him were men. Unfortunately, all three were wholly unappealing; all swagger and self-importance without any of the requisite substance. Even if it was just for one night, just to get it out of his system, Sherlock couldn’t bring himself spend any more time in their company beyond what was needed to tell them to keep moving, not after the caliber of men – of one man in particular – to whom he’d grown accustomed.
“Well I don’t know about human,” Sherlock smirked, “but that’s how mine does.”
“Ah,” Sherlock chuckled embarrassedly, knowing full well the bedside lamp did nothing to hide his blush. “Well, you know what they say, no good deed goes unpunished.”
“And you bought a brand new, expensive, suit?”
“Well, is he hot?” Alec Masterson – striker – piped up “I mean, taking up
“Long overdue as it is, and not that I’m not happy for you two, because I am, it’s been painful to watch you both dance around each other, you may want to hold off until you’re somewhere you can have a little bit more privacy. I’d hate to have to take you in for public indecency.”
“I could think of something, but it’s your call.” Molly shrugged. “I don’t actually mind lying if it means those three get what’s coming to them. What they did to you is bad enough, but did you know Eddie actually had the nerve to ask me out right in front of Amanda, not even two days after she’d broken up with him?”
Sherlock glared. “Well this is an anomaly; normally I would have been correct.” He mumbled under his breath.
Sherlock’s scans came back clear, no sign of any brain damage or diminished brain function, and day two transitioned into day three. His half waking spells continued, and though they were coming with greater frequency, none of them lasted long enough for John to get a hold of him and finally pull him back into the world. Still, Dr. Cook took it as a good sign, and John
“But no one
“Alright, home it is. Go on, you go get us a cab while I settle up. I’ll meet you outside.” John said with a smile, and Sherlock felt himself once again, smiling back.
“Wh…wh…what happened to you and I just being a onetime thing?” John gasps as he comes to his senses, and pulls his mouth from Sherlock’s.
At first the kiss was soft, almost shy. And oh god, kissing John was just as fantastic as Sherlock as remembered. No. No, it was infinitely better than he remembered. John was so gentle, his lips so soft as they brushed and pressed against Sherlock’s; the amount pressure just right that Sherlock found his mind slowing, and his focus concentrating on their connection. So lost was he in the feel of John’s lips, that Sherlock actually forgot to kiss back, and just allowed John to part his lips, sucking and kissing each one in turn. And suddenly there was John’s tongue gliding along his bottom lip, and dipping into his mouth to deepen the kiss. Just like that, Sherlock’s brain came rushing back online, and he let out a sound that was somewhere between a gasp, a moan, and a whimper – not that he would admit to ever making such a sound later.
“Close… need you closer… touch you.” Murmured John against Sherlock’s lips, his hand moving down to grasp Sherlock’s thigh, hooking Sherlock’s leg over his hip. “I just… feel you closer.”
“That your hair has gone ridiculously frizzy, and you look incredibly adorable.” Teased John, his fingers carding through Sherlock’s hair.
“Forgive me if I’m overstepping,” John said, his voice sounding hesitant. That was new, Sherlock thought to himself, someone worrying that they were invading his privacy, “but does this have anything to do with your past, and… and you having had to go to – to rehab?”
– kissing John.
With Christmas break upon them, John and Sherlock aren't going to let something as trivial as being in separate cities keep them apart.
The next hour passed quickly as they discussed what evidence they had, and what they would need to obtain in order to properly incriminate and stop Sebastian and his cronies. It wasn’t until John had asked a question and received no answer, that he noticed Sherlock had actually fallen asleep. Sherlock looked so peaceful in sleep – not that John made it a habit of watching him sleep – even with the angry bruises – and giving into temptation, he ran a hand through Sherlock’s curls before pulling the blanket up around him. He couldn’t very well wake the man and make him move back out to the couch, not when he was already settled and soundly asleep. No, Sherlock could take his bed again, and John would just go out to the living room.
It was the sound of wheels coming down the corridor that jolted Sherlock from his thoughts. There was a hospital bed headed towards the room. It was John, after what felt like an eternity, Sherlock was finally getting to see John.
“So you’re sure you’re still alright with us having different names?” Sherlock asked as John pulled him close and they started to dance, some pop rock love song with lots of piano playing in the background.
“Don’t bother, I’m not interested.”
“Well, tell me about him. What did he do to make you think he was a prat?”
“I appreciate you warning me, but I am a doctor.” He knew what to expect when it came to post operative patients, the IVs, the wires, and tubes. Sherlock was lying just on the other side of the door, John just wanted to get to Sherlock.
“You are a sarcastic one, aren’t you? I can see now why he’s taken a liking to you.” The man sneered.
Before he knew it, Sherlock was at the local precinct. They lived in a relatively “low crime” area, and the station was never really busy, but there were still a fair few people waiting to speak with the desk sergeant. Sherlock stormed past them all; the two noise complaints, the stolen jewelry that wasn’t really stolen, and picking up a brother from the drunk tank, could all wait.
John was just about calm enough to start thinking about going back down – it was his flat too, he had every right to use the sitting room – when there came in quick succession, the sound of glass smashing, a loud thump, and an even louder “Fuck!” in Sherlock’s distinctive voice coming from the bottom of the stairs.
“And how will that look, hmm? Poor little Sherlock, so pathetic he needs someone to teach him how to take care of himself.” Christ, that would only make things worse, it would give those pricks something else to use against him.
He was right. It was dangerous, and stupid, and John loved all of it.
“Well having things dictated to you works for some people, but I need a little flexibility.” Any edge to Sherlock’s voice, dulled by the alcohol.
Oh God, Sherlock was perfect, so perfect. God, Sherlock was gorgeous, so, so gorgeous. Sherlock was gorgeous and perfect, and all his. John loved him, God how John loved him.
Sherlock paused for a moment to take a deep breath; it was now or never. “I’ve been thinking about my work.” He said, putting his computer on the floor to face John again. “More specifically, in the course of my work, I have found that a working knowledge of modern medicine and medical practices would invaluable.”
*******
“I think I’d rather stand thanks. Actually, if I could leave right now, that’d be better.”John replies, attempting to make himself as tall as possible.
“Because it will only separate you further, and probably keep you from making friends. Don’t you want to make friends with the other boys and girls?”
It was a gentle, warm pressure moving along his eyebrow and down to trace his cheekbone, that stirred Sherlock from the gossamer haze of sleep. Kisses, someone was kissing him awake; he was being kissed awake by…
The nurse snorted. “Well good luck with that.”
John has to admit, even thought it is incredibly stupid, it is one of the most exciting things he’s ever done. Exciting and exhausting. Cars are not the most comfortable places in which to sleep. After they take the car back, they return to John’s flat. Sherlock is still talking a mile a minute about the case, and though John is dead on his feet, he could never bring himself to stop Sherlock when he’s so alive. After microwaving some leftovers, John collapses next to Sherlock. Finally, after about a half hour of dissecting the case, and the adrenaline has warn off, Sherlock decides there’s something else he’d like to be doing with his mouth, and starts to kiss John. Evidently the case has tired Sherlock out more than he let on and the kisses turn slow and sleepy, and soon they stop all together as both boys would rather sleep. John wakes a few hours later, still tangled together with Sherlock. It’s still the middle of the night, so he gently rouses Sherlock, and they shuffle to John’s much more comfortable bed to sleep till morning.
Not knowing what else to do, John turned to follow Sherlock back to his flat. He hadn’t even made it to the first landing when Mrs. Hudson’s voice floated up from below.
Sherlock smirked. “In a club? Yes.”
“Not a word” A small smile forming on Greg’s face.
“Well, with that out of the way, it is my great pleasure to pronounce you joined for life as husbands. You may now –”
– how did you get bigger? I just –
“You didn’t give me a fake name last night,” Sherlock continued, “so the phone must have been given to you by Harry Watson. The phone is a young man’s gadget, so Harry is a sibling or cousin, and sibling is the far more likely case.”
Sherlock sat on the couch, leaning against his mother. “The police still think John ran away. They’re only sending the note for analysis because Dad asked them too.”
“You will still come with me, won’t you?” Oh, Sherlock was still talking.
~***~
A week before he’s set to leave for training, Greg organizes a little farewell get-together. And after an evening of listening to everyone’s well wishes, being told to ‘make Lizzie proud’, and staving off the advances of friends of friends who had obvious uniform fetishes and wanted to ‘get in on the ground floor’, John finds himself sitting in the corner talking with Molly.
Sherlock let out a sigh of relief and gave himself over to the kiss. He hadn’t even realized how much it had been weighing on his mind.
“But actually, you probably should have something to eat,” John continued, seemingly unaware of the back and forth going on in Sherlock’s head. “I’m just assuming you haven’t had anything since yesterday, and it’s good to keep your energy up. Plus those pills should actually be taken with food.”
“That’s hardly news, John. But you’re the one who’s friends with me.”
“It allows for quite a bit of customization, which I’m sure is desirable when it comes to food. You’re not at the mercy of the cook.”
Now the only questions that remained were, what was the poison, how did it get in Julia’s system, and who – if anyone – put it there? Sherlock had a theory, four theories actually, he just needed a little bit more data. He needed to get into Julia’s flat, but that could wait until John completed his examination.
Good god, she wanted him to live out some cheesy nineties rom-com moment. “Now I remember why I go to Ella.” He said, more to himself than to Sarah. “I’m not going to go stakeout his flat, I’m not a stalker!”
“Yeah, alright. I figured you’d want to have a look.” Obviously, Sherlock thought. It took everything in him to keep from saying it aloud. “I’ve got someone there holding down the scene. I’ll just call and let them know we’re on our way.”
Panting, he broke the kiss, and grabbed at Sherlock’s wrist. “Mmmmm, wait, wait.”
“Girlfriend?” Sherlock frowned, what the hell was John on about? “Do you mean Molly? No. No, no. She's not my... no. She asked me to help her with this week’s lab. Molly’s just my… friend. Not my girlfriend. I don’t have a girlfriend. Girlfriends aren’t really my… area.” Oh god, he was rambling.
~***~
After nearly three months, it was finally happening, Sherlock was out on a case, and with John no less. Oh, it was better Christmas!
John actually laughed at that point. “Well, thank God you’re above all that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Come on, sit down. You look dead on your feet.” John said, sliding over to make room for Sherlock. “So tell me why you don’t want to report them. Why don’t you think reporting them will do anything? And the real reason this time.”
*******
“It’s been known to happen every once in a while,” John smirked, nipping at Sherlock’s ear. “Now you gorgeous creature, are you going to get up and get in that bedroom, or am I going to have to carry you in there myself?”
“Well what exactly would you call getting him off a triple murder charge,” John asked, “just a fun Thursday afternoon?”
“Alright lovebirds, enough with the muttering and flirting, there will be plenty of time for that later.” Came Lestrade’s voice, breaking John out of his little Sherlock Holmes bubble. “Aren’t we here to be celebrating John’s move?!”
“Oh Sherlock! Oh my baby! Oh my baby boy!” The privacy curtain around Sherlock’s cubicle flew open, revealing an anxious, tearful Mrs. Holmes; an equally anxious Mr. Holmes and Mr. Watson stood behind her. Thankfully she waited until the nurse finished tending to the cut above his eye, before enveloping Sherlock in her arms.
“Yeah, it acts as a sort of added support matrix; decreases the odds of further damaging your leg or slowing your healing.”
“You put some thought in to this.” Sherlock snorted, then immediately regretted it. The pain in his ribs was not as bad as it was when he first woke up, but it was still rather unpleasant.
John was silent for a few moments, just looking at Sherlock, until finally his mouth opened and a breath came rushing out. “That was amazing, all from some grass stains! And my shoes are new, my mummy took Harry and me shopping the day before school started.”
“You’re under duress, you’re scared.” Sherlock closed his eyes, unable to look at John as he spoke. “Once you say it, you can’t take it back.”
Christmas break is next, so the next chapter is going to be a little different, but I hope it works.
“We need to look at the footage again. Whoever dropped the phone has to be on there.” Sherlock could feel his own panic attack starting. He had to remain calm; he had to remain level headed. If he lost it now, his mother and Lestrade would make him stop, and he couldn’t stop.
“High praise coming from you. I’m honored!”
“I – ah – I guess I should probably be going, I’m actually supposed to be meeting…”
Before he knows it, the 20
Sherlock flagged down a cab, and the half hour ride to St. Bart’s passed in complete silence. Molly wrung her hands the entire way, shooting anxious looks over at Sherlock every so often. She had tried calling her uncle, but there was no answer. Service was notoriously poor down in the… down there. They didn’t have the number for the landline, and just the thought of explaining why he needed to be connected to the… there, made Sherlock feel ill. And so they rode in silence, and with every passing second, Sherlock dread grew. What was he going to see when they finally reached Bart’s? What was he about to walk into? What if his nightmare was about to come true? What was he going to do if…
God, John I need more!”
Bliss. That was all Sherlock could think as John’s mouth claimed his, and they slowly and carefully came down from their shared high. Unchecked, and uncontrolled bliss.
men…”
*******
“Oh John, why in the world would you listen to anything I say?” Sherlock said with a scoff, shaking his head, that teasing smirk John had grown rather fond of spread across his face. “Don’t you know I’m utterly rubbish when it comes to understanding emotions and matters of the heart? For the past thirty-three years, I’d been reliably informed I didn’t even have a heart.”
When his senses finally return, John pushes himself up and off Sherlock, opening his mouth to speak. What he’s going to say, John isn't sure. But before he can get a word out, Sherlock pulls John back down, preemptively shutting him up with a kiss. And so John doesn't say anything, instead pouring everything he feels into the kiss.
shouldn't
And so on the night before the hearing was to take place, almost six weeks to the day since the attack, John once again found himself sat on his bed trying to calm an anxious, pacing Sherlock.
It was only when his stomach began to growl, that John realized that dinner was past due, and they headed into the kitchen for some of Mrs. Hudson’s macaroni and cheese. He hadn’t even noticed when she dropped it off, but it must have been her, because the pot was not there earlier and her dishes from lunch were gone.
John shrugged, he didn’t think it was going to work. “It never hurts to offer, but if you change your mind…”
It was officially their anniversary.
“We have no doubt you could” his mummy said, rubbing soothing circles into his back. She was just trying to placate him. It wasn’t going to work, no matter how good it felt.
Drinks all but forgotten, hardly any words were exchanged in the secluded corner booth in the back of the club. Christ, he’d forgotten how good a first kiss could be. And Jack? Well Jack was a phenomenal kisser. Forceful, but not controlling. Enthusiastic, but not overbearing. Sherlock felt as Jack swept his bottom lip before sucking it in between his own. He was unable to stop himself and let out a deep, and embarrassingly throaty moan at the first hint of Jack’s teeth. It was only when Jack released his lip that Sherlock took control for himself, wrapping himself around Jack, and parting Jack’s lips to deepen the already overwhelming kiss. If it hadn’t been for the warning glare of the waitress, Sherlock would have had Jack then and there in the booth. Instead, Sherlock was left panting when Jack broke the kiss, and wordlessly lead him out of the club and into the back of one of the cabs lined up outside.
YES! Mor –
(MSUD stands for Maple Syrup Urine Disease, a genetic condition where the body can't breakdown certain amino acids, resulting in sweet smelling urine. Left untreated, babies suffer brain damage and die. But with proper treatment and diet management, those affected can lead fairly healthy lives without neurological damage.)
“What? What is it?”
“No, not a great way to start off, but all hope isn’t lost.” Mrs. Hudson took his hand, giving it a reassuring squeeze as she got up from the table. “If you go and apologize, explain that you completely overreacted, that you’ll never do it again, and you want to make it up to him, John’s bound to give you a second chance.”
“It’s alright, we don’t have to –”
“I didn’t even know this was possible.” Sherlock said sometime later, as they lay on their sides facing each other under the covers, John’s thumb slowly and gently rubbing back and forth along his cheek. It’s what he imagined heaven would feel like, if he believed in such a place as heaven.
For only the second time that evening, Sherlock paused and his mind raced. Was he a top or a bottom? Normally when given a choice, he tended to bottom, and probably nine times out of ten ended up bottoming, but was he really a bottom? Did he want to bottom now, for Jack? The last time… John had been the last man inside him. Did he really want…
Sherlock’s true wishes probably showed on his face, because a grin broke out on John’s, and with a little huff of laughter, John said he didn’t see why not.
“How am I being ridiculous? You’re the crime expert, I shouldn’t have to tell you assault and battery is a crime.”
“And you haven’t asked him about it, if it’s coincidence or if he’s actually playing for you?”
Getting the last word always put a little extra spring in Sherlock’s step, and not even Mycroft’s snide comments and innuendos could dampen his good mood, he wouldn’t let them. It was astonishing what being around John could do to him – to his mood, his confidence – John was astonishing, and Sherlock was…
each other as they went. And only when they were both completely naked, kneeling together on the unmade bed, held in each other’s arms, did Sherlock back John up, pushing him to sit against the headboard.
It's almost my sister's birthday, so I dedicate this chapter to her. I pray to god she never finds this or any of my other fics.
Oh, Sherlock had been acting
They were out on a case. A jewel thief was being taken into custody, there were about a half dozen police officers milling about, and Lestrade was standing not five feet away, arms folded and fighting like hell to keep a straight face. Somewhere in between the terror of watching Sherlock fall, the relief of seeing him alright, and the intoxicating joy of wrapping him in his arms and finally being allowed to lay claim to those lips over and over again, John had completely forgotten where they were. The self-satisfied smirk on Sherlock’s face, however, told John that he at least was fully aware of where they were standing and just who was watching. Definitely an arse.
“Thanks for the ride.” John said flatly. “And if you would be so kind, never come near me or Sherlock ever again.” He got a sick thrill of slamming the door before the man could reply.
“Because you don’t deserve to be treated this way.” John said resolutely.
“Yeah, and it cost me an arm and a leg; I don’t have to tell you.” John groaned. “But I needed a new one, seeing as my old suit go ruined during that case for Lord Bellinger. I just figured, you always look so good in your bespoke suits, and it might be nice to have something a bit better than the usual for next month, and you know… beyond.”
Sherlock bit back a grin as he stared at the text from John, and quickly sent off a reply. So preoccupied was he with thoughts of John, of what they did, and of what the morning could bring, that Sherlock failed to notice the three figures emerge from the shadows. It was the hand curling around his shoulder that jolted him back to reality, but by that time, it was too late.
“Nah, the guys usually prefer Saturdays over Fridays. Don’t worry about it.”
When he woke that morning, it was to the steady beating of John’s heart, and John’s arms lazily draped around his back. Sherlock blushed just thinking about, thinking about how much he wished he could wake in John’s arms every morning. John didn’t make any mention of what Sherlock had wanted to tell him before they fell asleep, and Sherlock wasn’t going to bring it up again. It was stupid, he was tired and his defenses were down, it would have been a mistake to admit that he… Well, it was moot anyway. They simply got up and went about starting their day.
What was he saying? Of course it mattered. It mattered, Sherlock wanted John to say yes, to come back and help with the exercises. He wanted John there to roll his eyes with when Heather said something asinine, or to offer praise when he managed a milestone in his recovery – or give words of encouragement if things went the other way. He wanted John there, he wanted John to say yes.
“Not really, though.” Sarah grimaced slightly. “I mean, sure, he shouldn’t have read it, and he defiantly shouldn’t have jumped to conclusions and started making accusations like he did, but the phone screen does light up. He probably wasn’t aware he was looking until he already was doing it.”
“You know,” John murmured, dropping his head to Sherlock’s, biting at his lips, dipping his tongue into his mouth, and kissing at his jaw, “no one’s going to believe – we’re only getting together – now. – Everyone already thinks – we’ve been shagging – all year – Mike’s convinced – we have china patterns – already all picked out.”
weren't
Sherlock, not really knowing how to respond, and honestly starting to feel just a little uncomfortable, just hummed.
“Apparently the office was closed for renovations until tomorrow. Our victim seems to have come in today to get a head start before everyone returned. But I was talking about the body, John. What do you think of the body?” clarifies Sherlock, nodding towards the victim slummed over her desk, a small pool of blood at her forehead.
! John hard –
“Hi, I’m John!” The boy said when Sherlock sat down, and Sherlock, remembering his mummy’s urgings of
“Did you know that the honey bee’s wings beat at more than two hundred beats per second?” Sherlock said, blurting out the first thing to pop into his head. “That’s what causes the stereotypical ‘buzzing’ sound. They can also fly up to six miles at a time and fly as fast as fifteen miles per hour.” What was he doing? Oh god, he was panicking. Sherlock never panicked, then again he also never…
“I promise… be better.”
“And where am I supposed to live if not here? I’ve been beaten to a pulp, and now you expect me to be homeless?”
“Oh, and are we going to be needing a lot of privacy?”
“More – more than.” Sherlock panted. “Just don’t – just don’t move. I want to feel you – just you.”
“Alright, so that’s two more times I have to go up and down the steps.” Because he was going to complete Stage Two in two weeks. “I’ll take them slow and it can count as an exercise.”
“The good thing is,” the doctor continued, “he won’t have to deal with a cast or anything, just a brace to offer extra support and protection. He’ll be able to keep the incisions clean, and shower normally after a few days.”
John was just helping Sherlock out of the car, when the front door of 221 Baker Street swung open, revealing an anxious but excited looking Mrs. Hudson.
“Waiting for you.”
“Plenty of other stuff we can do that doesn’t require condoms.” Sherlock breathes, still hovering over John.
“Yes John, I know. I’m not going to actually strangle you.” Sherlock rolled his eyes. Honesty baffled him sometimes, a lot of the time.
“Yeah… Yeah, it’s good to be home. I did miss London quite a bit.” John chuckled awkwardly, eyes glued to the remnants of his soup and sandwich.
“It’s always nice to be noticed,” John grinned. “But he is a bit too young, and not exactly my type. I’ve tended to go for the taller ones in the past. Ironic, I know”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What’s that?” John growled, sucking one of Sherlock’s earlobes into his mouth. “What do you want?”
“You’re so lucky you got to skip a grade,” John continued, keeping his voice low while the teacher told them to get out their maths workbooks, and started explaining their lesson for the day – double digit addition and subtraction, Sherlock could do that in his sleep, “now you don’t have to have a year of Mr. Sedgeway. He was a nightmare.”
John’s heart rate sped up; he had to force himself to swallow down the hope he felt rise in his chest. “And?” he prompted.
“John’s not on the streets! He hasn’t been arrested! He’s been kidnapped, and you damn well know it!” Sherlock shouted, he’d have lunged at Mr. Watson if Evans hadn’t grabbed his shirt.
John hadn’t realized how long they had been sitting together on the couch, Sherlock’s leg still across his lap, has hands now just resting on Sherlock’s thigh, until he noticed his flatmate’s head bobbing and his eyes drooping. The pain meds had been a bit stronger than Sherlock was used to taking, and though he’d probably denying if asked, they’d had a rather exhausting day. An active case after months of cold ones, and a not insignificant dose of an analgesic, was a powerful combination that could best the strongest of people, it was no wonder Sherlock was falling asleep.
John’s grip tightened on Sherlock’s hips, and he slowly pushed back in. “Oh I’m not going to
“Yeah, right, chokeholds” John  nodded, a ghost of the smirk still on his face. “There are a lot of different types, but the two most common are the arm around the neck, attack from behind, and the hands around the neck, attack from the front.”
As it turned out, he was not able to change his parents’ minds, and so one week after everyone else, Sherlock officially started his new school year.
*******
“Oh yeah right! Like I could have –” Sherlock started, then stopped. “Wait… me go? I’m… you’re taking me?” He couldn’t have heard that right, there was no way John would…
“Alright class, last week’s test has been graded.” Dr. Kirnan said just as class was wrapping up. “In general, you all did well, though a few of you could have started studying a bit earlier. Remember that for next time. If you have any questions about your test, please feel free to come talk to me or John.” she added, nodding to John who was busy dividing up the tests into three piles. “Thanks, and I’ll see you all on Thursday!” She added with a smile.
Sherlock’s kisses began working his way back up John’s back. “Quite the opposite, in fact.”
Normally Sherlock would have said something – told her that he
“Observations based on preliminary data, then.”
“Can we play pirates?” It had been so long since anyone had played pirates with him, Mummy and Daddy were usually too busy, and Mycroft always got bored halfway through
Oh, that made more sense. “Which one?”
They sit for a while longer, and when the light begins to grow dusky, they parted ways with one last kiss, until Saturday.
people fail to do so, is none of my concern.”
“No, no, please go on.” John managed to get out.
– you. I need more you.”
“Oh, well that’s a relief. Not the human trafficking thing, but…” John paused, shaking his head. “So you helped bring them down?”
“Almost… almost two years officially,” John said, “but… but we were friends for years before that.”
“You don’t have the first clue.” John laughed, then once again grew serious. “But that was the reason for your mood earlier today, right? Your past stay in rehab?”
“Good.” John smiled, his eyes closed.
“Yes, Doctor.” Sherlock rolled his eyes, but John could see the small smile creep across his face. “Now do we have any of that risotto left? I find I’m getting hungry again.”
“So do you know what a little birdie told me through the grape vine?” John asked as he took a swig of water and collected his bag from the corner of Carrows on Thursday evening of the blessed ‘free week’. They had decided to keep up the self-defense sessions, more because it had become routine than anything else. John didn’t really have much more he could teach Sherlock, so it was more practice than actual training. Plus just because John had resolved not to push for anything more with Sherlock, didn’t mean he was going to pass up an opportunity to be close to Sherlock. Especially Sherlock during a workout. He wasn’t proud of it, but there was just something about Sherlock with his cheeks flushed pink, endorphins high, a light shine to his face, that
“That is not what I said, and not what I was doing.” Sherlock protested, looking to his father. “I told him that John had been
"Yup.” And with that, Harry hung up. Sherlock sighed, he knew she wasn’t going to be of any help, Harry wasn’t going to remember the conversation, let alone to call Sherlock if John showed up, but he had to try.
They lay together for a while, legs tangled together, hands running along backs and sides, fingers sliding across cheeks and into hair, trading the occasional word, but mostly enjoying slow, drawn out kisses. It was perfect, absolutely, utterly, unbelievably perfect. John was sure, this was what true happiness had to feel like.
“Mycroft… please.” Sherlock wanted to vomit. “If you allow me to borrow the car, I will owe you a favor, no questions asked. I’ll do your
John was making due. He had his world completely flipped on its head, and did he dwell and wallow in self-pity? No, he dealt with it, and figured out what to do next. God, how he didn’t think Sherlock was the most pathetic man to walk the earth, Sherlock didn’t know.
*******
“Alright, up you get,” John said, lifting Sherlock’s leg up just enough to slide off the couch and stand up.
At this, Heather blushed, obviously embarrassed by the past few minutes of conversation. “Yes, of course. Let’s head over to the steps and get started with a set of stair climbs.”
“I need to know where Sherlock Holmes is.” John said, forgoing pleasantries.
A few short days after the dry cleaners and his confrontation with Mycroft, John finds himself in the non-fiction section of a nearby bookstore. Cursing his less than average height, John stands on his toes in an attempt to reach a book on the top shelf.
“How much longer?” Sherlock asked.
“It’s both our faults then.” Molly said with a nervous giggle. “I’ll just be off, and I’ll watch where I’m going this time.”
Now about this chapter, just as a heads-up, there are some derogatory/homophobic terms said. I hope no one is offended.
“John –”
“John… John… JOHN!”
“You don’t have to do that, Mum. I can go alone.”
John had slipped into a light doze after he and Sherlock ticked a number of items off Sherlock rather impressive list, when he felt a warm pressure against the back of his neck. The pressure slowly started to move down his back, pausing at each of his vertebra. Sherlock was kissing down his spine, and though he was exhausted, John thought this was not a bad way to be awakened.
“I really hate it when people leave their trash about, you know?” She sounded so sincere, so concerned as she looked at Lestrade, Sherlock felt ill. “Honestly, I didn’t know there was anything in it. There was no one around it, so I just picked it up and threw it away. It was just some trash.”
“Well in that case, I know a Chinese restaurant that stays open late; hungry?”
“You had no idea of what? When?” Sherlock asked.
“Wait, you don’t mean… they weren’t… sex?!?”
It was the frantic banging on his door that woke Sherlock, or perhaps it was the throbbing pain over the majority of his body; possibly both.
need this nice looking little old lady thinking he was Sherlock ‘young man.’
As time wears on, John and Sherlock’s relationship fundamentally changes from that of when they first met at Molly and Greg’s party. It happens so subtly that neither seems to notice. What was once going to a crime scene and getting each other off a couple times a week, has shifted to spending most days together doing anything or nothing, talking for hours, or being comfortably silent. There are still the crime scenes, and there is still a fair amount of getting off, but it has turned into so much more. It becomes Sherlock wrapping his arms around John waist as John makes them tea in the morning, and John rubbing Sherlock’s scalp to relieve the tension brought on by “all the tedious people.” Yet they say nothing.
convincing argument.
As John and Seb struggled, the butt of the gun flew backwards, and Sherlock’s ribs exploded in pain; but even as the air was knocked out of his lungs, he still hung on. His arms tightened around Seb’s neck; squeezing as hard as he could, not hard enough to kill him, just enough to cut off the oxygen to his brain long enough to render him unconscious – Sherlock knew his strength. He could feel Seb’s muscles tensing, his windpipe constricting. Any moment, Seb would be out; any second and John would be free. Seb started to slow, his movements turned sluggish. Just… a little… more.
“Well I thought so, but clearly I thought wro –” John didn’t get to finish his sentence, because Sherlock was out of the kitchen and across the sitting room in two seconds.
By the time Saturday arrives, John is in a full panic. Is he moving things too fast? Sure they've known each other for months, and some of their coffee get-togethers did sometimes feel more like dates, but what if he’s reading the signs wrong? What if Whitney is just humoring him? What if he’s taking advantage of Whitney, using her as a substitute for Sherlock? But he meant what he said, they share some similarities, but there were differences too, differences he very much liked. So why shouldn't he like the traits in Whitney that he had once loved in Sherlock, in addition to her differences? It’s times like these that John desperately misses his mother. He could just lay everything on the table, all his worries and confusion, and she would know exactly what to do.
“I don’t know.” John said slowly, biting his lip to keep from laughing himself. “If anyone could pull it off, it’d be you.”
“It’s a suit,” Sherlock said, knowing he looked and sounded utterly gobsmacked. But John was wearing a perfectly tailored, exquisite suit. He had only seen John dressed like that on one other occasion, and he couldn’t bear to think about that. “From my tailor.” He’d know Colin’s work anywhere.
, that I’m acclimatized to danger?”
“Please, John, don’t pretend you don’t know. It’s perfectly obvious his motivations.”
John went limp in Sherlock’s arms, his eyes no longer fought to open, his breathing became shallower.
“What? Don’t be ridiculous, Lestrade.” Sherlock said, rolling his eyes. “We as in John and me.”
Silence fell over the cramped office after that, but it wasn’t the usually companionable silence Sherlock so often enjoyed with John. This silence felt tense, awkward, he hated it.
wasn’t interested – but the glare on John’s face gave him pause. Things had been going so well up to that point. Still buzzing from the case – and the company – he and John discussed what they thought would happen next, Sherlock predicting how long it would take for Emily to confess. But every time the waitress appeared – to show them to a table, to bring them water, to take their orders – John would get quiet and frown. He couldn’t really be so upset that the waitress had picked Sherlock to flirt with instead of him, could he? John had countless women falling over each other to flirt with him, and he had to know that Sherlock had no interest in the waitress. John just had to turn on the charm, and she’d forget about Sherlock as a lost cause in seconds. But John wasn’t turning on the charm, he just glared down at the table until the waitress left, then it was like before, chatting – and praising – away. Sherlock didn’t understand it.
"He…ah….he went missing.” Sherlock stumbled, even saying the words hurt. “No one’s seen him since last night. Your father said there was a note, and I was, I mean, we were hoping maybe John had talked to you.”
” John screamed, losing control and bucking into Sherlock’s mouth. He was pouring himself down Sherlock’s throat; he had come so many times in the past few hours, yet more seemed to come. He was dead, he must be dead, Sherlock literally sucked him to death, and this was his heaven.
Several hours later, John finally began to stir. “Mmmmm… Morning.” He yawned.
“Says the man who just thanked me.” Mycroft retorted with a snort. “Go on and return to your little love nest. Forgive me, your temporary accommodations. You are still only staying on his sofa, correct?” He added, smirk firmly back in place.
“Now –
suggest something?”
John hadn’t even notice Sherlock writing the note, or slipping the bills into his jacket. Granted John wasn’t thinking too hard about reverse pick pocketing when Sherlock had cozied up to him in the back of the cab.
“Yeah, I guess. It’d be better if I had the hundred and fifty quid to go along with hit.” Mike grumbled. “And John’s probably going to want to live with Sherlock next year, so it looks like I’m out one flat mate.” His friends’ happiness was sure costing him a lot.
“I don’t have time for this, Harry.” He said warningly, and headed for the door.
he thought,
John was so lost in his thoughts that he failed to notice the black town car pull him in front of him. The hulking man holding the backdoor open, however, was harder to miss.
The rest of their anniversary – now engagement – getaway was spent waking late in the mornings, and getting out of bed even later. They wandered hand in hand through the town, and even explored a bit of the countryside – Sherlock’s shoes weren’t the best for long hikes, so they didn’t venture too far from paved paths. But best of all, Sherlock took every opportunity to refer to John as his fiancé, to just about everyone they met. At the risk of being called ridiculously romantic again, John would have said it was like a dream.
John was wrong of course, because in no sane world would Sherlock Holmes be considered any good deed’s reward. A necessary evil? Maybe. A pain in the arse? Definitely. But a reward? Never. No, Sherlock was the lucky one, he was the one gifted a life with John Watson, who was brave and kind and saved his life in more ways than one. But the way John looked at him, the way he held him… John saw him as a reward, as a gift, as someone worthy of love. Sherlock wanted to be worthy. Dammit, he was going to be worthy. As they drifted off to sleep that night, Sherlock made a vow, not unlike those he’d made three weeks earlier in front of friends and family, he would be worthy of John Watson’s love, he would be worthy of John Watson. He had a lifetime ahead of him with John Watson at his side and on his side, and he would be worthy. After a lifetime of sacrifice and good deeds, he would be the reward his husband deserved.
“Now Sherlock Holmes,” Mrs. Hudson’s tone was now admonishing, “I sincerely hope you were not considering sending… John was it?” John nodded. “John, out in this weather!”
Once the food is finished, and their battle ends in a stalemate, they leave the restaurant. Neither wanting to leave each other just yet, they start aimlessly walking.
“Hmm?”
“How much longer are we expected to stay?” Sherlock asked once the song had ended and transitioned into another equally absurd ballad. “Not to be indelicate, but I have something in mind I really want to do, and I’m going to need to get you somewhere private.”
“Oh you’re a bad man, Sherlock Holmes. Where did that shy guy I met a year ago, go? The one who couldn’t believe someone could like him.”

“You and John were talking about Thursday. You two have plans or something?”
I loved writing this, and I hope you enjoyed reading it. I'm almost done with the short one-shot sequel/epilogue to this (and it is a one-shot this time), so I hope to post that in a couple days.
For perhaps twenty seconds, John was rendered speechless, unable to do anything but stare at Sherlock, trying to process one of the most absurd things he’d ever heard.
John let out a little moan when Sherlock began kissing his clavicle and worked his mouth up his neck. “And that –
“And a ruined suit is worth destroying two lives.” Came John’s voice again, brimming with disgust.
John frowned, confused. He was Scottish, not Maori. “My what?”
“We are not.”
“I – yes,” Sherlock blushed. “Would you like to accompany me when I go visit my parents for the long weekend?”
“There’s actually something I want to talk to you about.” John laughs
“You ran a search for me?”
“Ok, so what’s got you all… springy?” John asked, waving his hand at Sherlock.
Five minutes, ten minutes, a half hour, the time ticked by, and they watched for any sign, any clue. Tea was delivered, ignored, drank, thrown away, and refilled. A bag of crisps was left open next to Sherlock’s hand, and absentmindedly he ate, eyes never leaving the screen.
Sherlock looked past Moriarty, into John’s imploring eyes, and the truth was written plain as day.
“Yes, he did sustain a minor concussion, but there appears to be no damage to his brain. His head will no doubt be fine, but we are monitoring it nevertheless.”
*******
“I get it, it’s too strange. I used to be involved with your brother, I understand.” John sighs.
“Yes. See, absolutely nothing is wrong. Would you mind handing me the ammonium persulfate?”
It was just another day, just the start of another term, granted it was the start of the last term before university, but still just another school day. Walking through the front gates shouldn’t have made Sherlock so nervous. No, nervous wasn’t the right word. Anxious; for the first time in his nearly thirteen years of schooling, Sherlock Holmes was anxious to get to class. He was anxious to sit in his normal seat towards the back of his home room, and he was anxious to turn to his left and see John Watson, his best friend of nearly seven years. Only, when Sherlock got to his homeroom and took his seat, there was nobody sitting to his left, John’s seat was empty.
“Shit, yeah.” Mike sighed. “Well now you can breathe easier.”
Sebastian – the smarmy prick who by the looks of him could have doubled for the trust fund villain in an eighties movie – eyed him skeptically. “Maybe. Why are you asking?”
“You’re not using your cane, and your limp is almost entirely gone.” Ella said almost the instant John sat down. “Only last week, you could barely take a step without it. What happened to bring about such a drastic change?” She asked.
Sherlock didn’t have to deal with the sandwich for long, because exactly five minutes and thirty-eight seconds after being lead into the office, Mr. Holmes strode in, greeting his wife with a kiss, and a tight hug for Sherlock. Mrs. Holmes had apparently already sent word ahead, a fact for which Sherlock was eternally grateful, because he was soon equipped with secured laptops and access to both CCTV live feeds and recordings. Sherlock didn’t even want to think about what strings his father had to pull, all the favors he had to call in, to get Sherlock access. He’d have to figure out some way to thank both his parents for everything they were doing for him, but could think about that later, for the moment, a nod and brief tight lipped smile would have to do.
The man just stared at him, his mouth opening and closing a few times before he spoke. “That… was amazing.”
“You, John Watson, are a terrible tease.”
“Ok, hold on; let me get this straight, you solved a murder at thirteen?”
“Shh, you said your bit.” John laughed. “It’s my turn now, and I’m almost done.”
Once they've ordered, Sherlock keeps his word, and starts to tell John about the last decade of his life. Feeling the need to get it off his chest and allow John to enter into this renewed friendship with open eyes, Sherlock explains about developing a drugs habit during the end of university, and through his graduate degree.
“Well we will soon enough, so might as well start getting used to it.”
“Well, John, it hasn’t even been three weeks since you moved in with him, but in that time, your sleep has improved, as has your general outlook, not to mention you’re looking much healthier. I know what you’re thinking, ‘how does this related to my state of mind’,” maybe Ella was a mind reader too, “but I want you to really think. Why do you think making the acquaintance of one, as you described him, ‘might be mad, but strangely likable’ man, bring about such a change in you?”
John was an adrenaline junkie, he acted on instinct and jumped in feet first. John had a reckless streak just like Sherlock – maybe he wasn’t as reckless as Sherlock, hardly anyone was – of course he’d find the life of an ordinary GP dreadfully dull.
“Did you really mean it?”
, so he should be grateful and forget about him. Forgetting about Sherlock proved easier said than done.
“It’s my brain,” Sherlock explained. “Last week I had a PET scan done and during it I looked at pictures of you and of our life together, and listened to recordings your voice. Mike helped me out, he snuck me in using some fake patient name.”
The music really was beautiful, but as the players transitioned into their next song, John found his focus sifting away from the notes filling the square, and onto the man in his arms, sitting across his lap. He watched Sherlock listen to the quartet, in what John could only describe as wrapped in the most perfect happiness. A gentle smile spread across his face and his long thin fingers waved in time with the music. And his eyes… Sherlock’s eyes took on a languid, almost dreamy quality; so unlike those of Sherlock on a case, Sherlock quick-witted and relentless, ready to take down the criminal, solve the mystery, or just show that he was smarter than everyone else around him. Sherlock was enraptured by the music, and John was enraptured by Sherlock.
. The rumors were ridiculous, the endless questions were tiresome, but John and Sherlock faced them all head on, together. Mostly they just ignored everyone, save for a select few, and did their work. The school even allowed them to walk in graduation, with the understanding they still had to complete their independent study.
“It’s been months and he still wants me; now, more than ever.” Sherlock said defiantly.
“I’m still here.” Sherlock said, looking back at Moriarty.
It had been nearly five months to the day since a burning house fell on top of him, but the time had come, it was finally the end of his last physical therapy session. If he were the type to sing, Sherlock would have broken out in song. However, instead of singing – or telling Heather he was more than happy in the knowledge that he’d never have to step foot in her place of business ever again – he merely nodded. After a not so subtle elbow from John, he also added a mumbled “Thank you, I appreciate all you’ve done for me.”
Sherlock, it was wrong, it was inappropriate. For one thing, he was Sherlock’s TA, and for another he was Sherlock’s friend and Sherlock wasn’t interested in that kind of stuff. He was meant to be helping him, teaching him how to protect himself. Sherlock was trusting him – and Sherlock’s trust was hard won – John couldn’t be objectifying him, lusting after him, John couldn’t allow himself to take advantage of that trust. But still John desperately wanted him. Whether he was with him or not, there was hardly an hour in the day that went by that John didn’t think about Sherlock. And it only got worse at night, at night there were no distractions. John would lay in bed replaying conversations, reliving even the most minuscule things they’d done together, imagining what they could do – what he wanted to do. Countless nights John spent thinking about how Sherlock’s body felt pressed up against him during their training, or those times in his office when Sherlock would lean over his shoulder or sat on his desk. Countless nights he had to keep his fist in his mouth to keep himself from screaming Sherlock’s name as he imagined backing Sherlock up against the wall, Sherlock’s long legs wrapped around his waist. He imagined pulling Sherlock off the desk and into his lap, or pushing him back flat onto the desk. Night after night he imagined himself ravishing Sherlock as Sherlock moaned for more and called out John’s name. It was wrong, it was inappropriate, and he vowed to never act on his growing feelings, but dear god did John want Sherlock Holmes.
“Alright, now I could be wrong here, but I think that’s none of your business.”
, I should probably let you know that I’m not looking for any type of relationship. I’m not interested in anything past tonight, tomorrow morning at the latest. If that’s going to be a problem for you, then you should probably move along now and not waste either of our time.”
John – oh god, John! I need you to move –
John carefully pushed the door open and found himself in a very posh looking office. Everything from the wood paneling on the walls, to the bookshelves, to the desk looked hand carved, and it all smelled of fine leather and even finer liquor. And there, stood right in the middle of it all was a man who looked even posher than the office. He was tall, wearing a pristine three-piece suit, and not a single dark auburn hair was out of place.
“You know, I just realized something.” John said a couple hours later, after Sherlock had packed a bag, and they lay wrapped around one another on the sofa. “I never formally asked you to come with me, I just sort of assumed you knew there was nobody else but you. This whole mess could have been avoided if I had just done things right!”
Lestrade chuckled and shook his head, clearly used to such behavior. “These are some cold cases, and a few open cases we’ve gotten since you went and got yourself blown up, and this spleen is compliments of Molly,” he said, setting both the file box and the cooler on the coffee table in front of Sherlock. “Just so we’re clear, I officially did not bring this here, and I have no knowledge of any human tissue leaving the morgue,” he added, eyeing them both.
“What about your side? I noticed your carrying your bag on the left, is it still bothering you?” John asked. Sherlock could be as stubborn as he wanted, that wasn’t going to stop John from his duty. Whatever that duty was, John wasn’t quite sure, but he didn’t bother thinking too hard about it.
, do you imagine he has?”
“By all – means – So I take it – you like it?”
John thought, swallowing one last time.
“I had no idea when I did it.” John said quietly, turning onto his side and wrapping his arms around Sherlock, once they’d both come down. He’d deny it to his dying day, but Sherlock loved post-coital cuddling. Laying in John’s arms, the covers pulled up to their shoulders, slowly breathing together, their legs entangled, sharing quiet thoughts or just looking into each other’s eyes, it made Sherlock feel safe, it made him feel cherished, it made him feel loved.
“Love you – too.”
or whatever it was Mycroft liked to say. It was everything he ever believed; it was how he lived his life. Everyday Sherlock saw what caring for others did to people, it got them killed, it got them taken advantage of, it lead to their downfall. And now he seemed to be falling victim himself. He found himself caring about John Watson; caring what John thought, what John thought about him. He wanted more of John, more with John. And it wasn’t just the sex – though the sex was amazing – it was John himself. But Sherlock didn’t understand
“What?”
"Sherlock… I need you to know…” John said once they’d finally come down.
Well, he had time to figure it out; John was going to be out for at least a few more hours.
“You’re being obtuse on purpose, aren’t you?” Sherlock sighed. John just grinned. “Fine. You asked me to marry you with the pocket watch, and I can’t imagine a better and more perfect engagement gift, but I think we should still have engagement rings. They are the most commonly recognized sign of an engagement.”
John’s stomach dropped. “What happened?” he asked, his voice cracking.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
“Well, the knife perforated Mr. Holmes’ spleen, and we had to perform a partial splenectomy to take care of all the damaged tissue.”
“What did they do? How many were there? I need to know what they did to you. Please, Sherlock, I need to know.” John pled, his face so soft, so caring. Why did he always care so much?
“Excellent! Any preferences.”
“Well precision is important.” Sherlock pouted.
“Your entire forearm has to rotate.” John sighed. “You want your elbow to pop outwards. That should give you enough force that when you snap your arm down, it’ll break your attacker’s grip.”
“Massive seizures and respiratory failure can start as quickly as five minutes after…” Sherlock started to say, but as he turned around, he felt his heart stutter and his breath catch in his chest. There before him, a nervous smile on his face as he gazed up him, was John down on one knee. “John? What… What are you doing?” He breathed.
If John was… If the waiter was…
“Excuses, excuses.” John sighed. “But be honest, weak alter-ego or not, Jack did manage to show you a good time, didn’t he?
Alright, John cocked an eyebrow and licked his lips; that had to mean something, right? Was John… no, no he couldn’t be. No, he was just teasing Sherlock back, that was all.
“John.” Sherlock’s eyes flew open as that morning came rushing back to him. At least he thought it was that morning – it was dark outside and he couldn’t have slept more than a few hours. John had come to his room – seen him beaten and broken – he had taken him to hospital, insisted he be checked out by real doctors. The last thing Sherlock remembered was the nurse injecting him with something, and now he was… now he was in John’s flat, in John’s bed. This was decidedly not how he thought he would be ending up in John’s bed.
Curse that woman. Curse her hip, curse her cooking, and curse her godforsaken timing. Sherlock wanted to scream.
“No thanks necessary, and no apologies needed, I’m used to it. Not the running into burning buildings thing.” John said when Lestrade raised an eyebrow. “I was an army doctor, so I’m kind of used to the high stress situations, and people needed to get things off their chests.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“John?” He said finally, his voice a little hesitant.
spend almost all my time with you, who else would it be? You’re my best friend.” A warm smile spreads across John’s face.  “So please be careful. I can’t lose you, Sherlock.”
It was light streaming in from an unfamiliar angle that woke John, blinding him even through his closed eyelids. As he buried his face in an unfamiliar pillow, John felt a weight shift behind him, and an arm drape itself across his bare waist, and the events of previous night came flooding back. He remembered Bill dragging him out to the club. He remembered Sherlock, flirting with Sherlock, dancing with Sherlock, kissing Sherlock, going home with Sherlock, holding and touching Sherlock. He remembered resting his eyes for a moment –
“Do these not work?” Sherlock asked, looking down at himself. He was wearing a pair of expensive looking jeans and a slightly too large button-down shirt.
We’re getting married.”
Sherlock felt John’s hand on his chin lifting his head to look up. John was… John was smiling. It wasn’t his amused smile, or his placating smile, or his accommodating, humoring smile. John was smiling his soft, overjoyed, loving, ‘for Sherlock only’ smile.
“Well, in terms of frequency, married sex far outstrips both dating sex and engaged sex. At the rate we’re going, I think they’re going to need to rename this place ‘The Holmes-Watson Honeymoon Suit.’” Sherlock grinned.
“I didn’t find anyone interesting enough to be willing to actually try it. Oral and manual stimulation always sufficed before. But I had wanted to know what penetrative sex with a partner would feel like.” Sherlock answers matter-of-factly.
“Yes, excellent! Just what I was thinking. What else do you notice?”
Sherlock looked up from the round table where he was currently sat, to find John looking stunning in his new suit, standing before him.
My childishness won out again, and I couldn't resist the thought of Sherlock having to deal with a period. I'm sorry.
John felt about fifty pounds lighter. “Of course. You’re way, always your way.” It was a struggle to keep his voice level, he wanted to cheer.
“What?”
“If we hadn’t had sex, things would be less awkward. Do you agree?”
“It’s not like I intended –” but the rest of Sherlock’s protest was interrupted by his phone pinging.
“What’s… What’s your middle name?” he asked.
“Oh yes,” Sherlock’s voice rumbled deep in his chest, “though less scales and talons, and more warn skin and firm muscle, would be preferable.”
After his shower, Sherlock went straight into his room, not bothering to go back out to the living room. He couldn’t face John again, at least not again that evening, he just needed a little time to get his head back on right. It had been foolish of him to think – to hope – that he and John could finally be together, that they could finally move beyond friends and flatmates, and become something more. To think John would ever seriously want him, would want a serious relationship with. He was kidding himself, he was just a place holder, someone familiar, a comfort, until John could find someone else, someone worthy of social, and formal, and twentieth anniversaries. John wanted someone with whom he could have something real, and no one wanted something real with someone who was just a comfort.
The food arrived – from the Indian place with the garlic and onion naan Sherlock liked – and by the time they had eaten, it looked like the tablets had started to take effect. Sherlock was more relaxed, his jaw had come unclenched at least, however, John didn’t fail to notice him wincing and clutching his thigh every time he moved his leg.
“I would call a workman, but there’s no way they’d be able to get here in this weather.” Mrs. Hudson explained. “I was hoping you’d have a look for me. I’d do it myself, but long gone are the days I can be crawling around on the floor.” She laughed.
“Well in that case, give me twenty minutes, and I’m all yours.”
“It’s not. Not really, I mean.” Mike said, trying to come to terms with the fact he had just cock-blocked John and Sherlock. Should he go back and apologize? Send a text? No, no, that would just make it worse. “It’s obvious they’re both  mad for each other, but John’s been so adamant that nothing would ever happen since ‘Sherlock wasn’t interested in things like that.’ I wasn’t sure they’d ever get their heads out of their own arses.”
Dear god, tt was bad enough that she overheard his and John’s…
It was Sherlock’s turn to stare. No one had said that before. “Do you think so?” he asked after a few moments.
It took him seventeen.
The weeks following the initiation of ‘Phase Two’ were a whirlwind. John did everything he could think of to keep Sherlock distracted. He even managed to talk Mike into letting Sherlock set up his chemistry equipment on one half of the kitchen table, though he did draw the line at letting Sherlock store ‘samples’ in the refrigerator – Mike could only be so forgiving. Cases, experiments, the morgue, everything, you name it and John did it. Well, he almost did everything, there may have been one or two other things he thought of that he’d like to have done.
“Yes Molly, I am. Now don’t you have to be at work or something? While those in your charge may be late, you shouldn’t be.”
“Hello John.”
John grinned and gave a wave as he left, and Sherlock felt himself smiling back. It wasn’t until his nurse stopped by for her end of shift check and commented on his ‘new mood’ that Sherlock realized the small smile had yet to leave his face. He dropped it immediately.
“Ok, I don’t really hate it, it’s just kinda boring.” John replied. “It was my great-great-great-granddad or something’s name, and now all the first boys in our family have it as a middle name.”
“You’ve met him. How many friends do you imagine he has?” The man laughed.
“Well maybe they did, but then they heard you in here and thought I was busy.” John was teasing him; Sherlock liked it when John teased him.
John wasn’t put off by Sherlock’s personality, if anything he seemed to actually appreciate it. And search as he did, Sherlock could not find any ulterior motives for John’s behavior. John really was as open, up front, and honest as he appeared. As unbelievable as it seemed, every observation and every scrap of data Sherlock was able to collect all pointed to one conclusion: John Watson actually liked him. Though he wouldn’t go so far as to say John was becoming his friend – Sherlock didn’t have friends – perhaps there was a possibility for… camaraderie? A mutually pleasant association between the two? Sherlock could have that, he could definitely make that work. He just had to show that he was receptive so such an association.
Any retort John may or may not have had was lost when Sherlock leaned down to silence him with a rough kiss. John had a lot to answer for.
“Don’t tell me someone as cute as you is all alone.”
“Maybe I wanted to leave you alone to
In one smooth motion, Sherlock had ripped open the condom, and rolled it – if a bit slowly – down John’s aching length. John thought he was going to die when he felt Sherlock’s hand close around him, coating him with warm, slick lube.
John’s deep blue eyes shown with a softness that spoke a thousand things at once, and the smile that spread across his face, was enough to fill Sherlock’s chest a dozen times over. “Tell me about it. I go to bed every night – or whenever it is we end up going to bed – thinking that there’s no way I could possibly love you any more than I already do, then when I wake up and see you, I love you all the more. It’s like my love for you is always at the max, but the max is ever increasing.”
“Well in that case,” John grinned, sliding his hand down Sherlock’s back to pull him in closer. Oh yes, that was better, he needed Sherlock’s warm body closer, Sherlock could never been too close, “count me in for one thousand percent!”
“I’m not… I’m not overstepping, am I? Sitting here, I mean. I’m not in the way or anything?” He asked worriedly.
“I can see that.” John laughed. “But I meant your workout clothes.”
“And?”
“Wait…” John sat up, something suddenly dawning on him, “how did you know about Harry?”
He had a tan line too, on the fourth finger of his left hand. He wasn’t cheating, he’d be hiding his hand if he were. Not widowed either, the tan line would have faded more before he tried anything remotely close to dating again. His relationship had fallen apart, and very recently. He was looking for a distraction too. Most likely he was… no. No, Sherlock had to stop, he wasn’t going to deduce this man, that’s what got him in trouble last time. He wasn’t interested in this man’s past, in who this man was, all that mattered was that he was attractive and free of commitment, just what Sherlock was looking for.
Cliffhanger!
“Hold on, Sherlock. What’s going with you?”
This is the half way point!
“Quite the contrary Mr. Watson, the goings on of Sherlock Holmes is very much my business. And now you appear. You meet him at a party, start solving crimes with him, and though I wish it were not so, your
“No, David Attenborough is.” John rolled his eyes. “Of course you are! Why would you possibly think otherwise?”
“I was sitting right behind you, dear. And where do you think my boys learned it all, to not just see but to ‘observe’?”
Helen Stoner found her sister Julia, thirty-two, dead on her bathroom floor after not hearing from her sister for three days. According to the not-Molly, the cause of death was sudden cardiac arrest. The only problem, however, was that Julia was an avid runner, in peak physical health, and her medical history showed no heart problems; there was no family history either. A toxicology screen was run to look for any drugs in her system – the most common cause of cardiac arrest in those without heart problems – and it showed she was completely clean. While there were no drugs present, the screen did show traces of an unidentified poison, and it was that poison that lead to the heart failure and Julia’s untimely death.
“Breaking and entering? What makes you think we’re breaking in?”
“Nice to meet you. I’m … ah… I’m sorry about earlier. I didn’t mean to get in your way.” John apologized.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m in one hundred percent, too.” He whispered when they came up for air. It should frighten him, wanting to give himself over completely to another human being, to care for and be cared for by someone else, but it didn’t. It was John, and John was… everything.
John was still, he was too still, he was limp. Oh god! Oh god, he was gone! Sherlock lost him. Sherlock failed him. There was still so much left for John to do, for him to experience, for them to experience. The only person Sherlock ever truly loved, the only person he would ever love, could ever love, and he failed him.
“Yeah, nothing too fancy mind you. Just some block, how to escape holds, maybe some basic counter-attacks.”
It actually hurt John to think that something in Sherlock’s past made the fear of being targeted and tricked a legitimate concern. Nothing Sherlock could have possibly done could warrant that level of cruelty. He didn’t really know Sherlock yet, but he knew he didn’t deserve it. Nobody deserved that, but something in John just told him Sherlock deserved it least of all. John was just being ridiculous.
Sherlock grinned. “An army doctor? Child’s play. And I didn’t know, I saw.”
“That’s wonderful John, really wonderful.” There was a but coming. “But I want you to be careful. The excitement and adrenaline will wear off, and life will go back to normal. This is excellent progress, and even though it happened suddenly, I want you to take the opportunity to channel it into something productive.”
“I was hoping you’d say that.” Mr. Holmes smiled. “Sherlock was informed by Mr. Watson senior, and by the responding officer, a PC Andrews, that a note was found.”
“Oh, right, yeah. I’m supposed to be holding on to the rings until the big moment, and Sherlock told me you have them.”
“What arrangements?”
“You’ll never know if you don’t try.” Sarah said in a sing-song voice as she got up and headed for the door again. “I’m just going to go call Drew and get an ETA. Think about what I said!”
Partially taking Leah’s advise, John did run down to the café to buy himself a sandwich, but brought it back to Sherlock’s room to wait, and while he waited, he used the time to update everyone as much as he could. Running on over forty-eight hours of practically no sleep, he knew he really should have tried to get some rest, but every time John tried closing his eyes, he just saw Sherlock bleeding out, he imagined waking up to a world without Sherlock. No, he would rest when it was Sherlock telling him to go to sleep, and not a second sooner.

“I’m fine, really I’m fine. My leg’s fine, I managed to fall on my right side.” Sherlock muttered. “Just hand me my crutch.”
“You’re not broken.” Sherlock said quietly, blue-grey-green eyes staring straight into John’s.
’ Sherlock thought, ‘
Taking a deep breath, John walked into the kitchen just like he did every other day. He just had to act normal, as if nothing had changed, he could do this.

“Your commitment to patient well-being is a thing of wonder, Dr. Watson.” Sherlock said flatly, but smiled all the same as he made his way past John and down the hall towards his room.
John watched as Sherlock disappeared towards the residences before turning to head for his bus stop. For the first time in nearly two and a half years, John was excited for the weekend, and it had nothing to do with playing football or doing something with his football mates. It was going to be great seeing Sherlock outside of lessons, academic or self-defense related. Hearing Sherlock’s police stories were going to be… well John couldn’t wait.
“I figured out that much for myself, thanks. I mean what were you doing coming upstairs? And what was with the biscuits and beer?”
“I love you too, Bumble. Now come go, let’s go examine some deadly plants!”
with the dance instructor. At least then he was able to back away and no one was any wiser. At this precise moment, there was no escape. John was stuck in a borrowed suit, the cuffs of his shirt rolled up two or three times just so he could used his hands, forced to wind his way through London’s top percent, providing them with hors d’oeuvres while remaining invisible.
“I’m sure that can be arranged.” The surgeon smiled, and led Mr. Watson off towards the recovery room.
Sherlock had just finished filling his father in, when PC Butler returned with the note, secured safely in a sealed evidence bag. Leaping up, Sherlock snatched the note out of Butler’s hands and placed it on the table, his father looking over his shoulder. The note was short, just ten words:
Next up: Physical therapy takes an interesting twist, and Lestrade stops by with something interesting
“It’s getting kind of late.” John said after almost another hour of talking, and a fair bit of snogging. “We should probably get going.”
That’s not to say there isn’t a bit of variation thrown in. Sometimes they meet at the library so Sherlock can show John some cold cases DI Lestrade has given him, those days they solve four or five cases in one sitting. A lot of times they stop for something to eat, John insisting they need to keep up their energy. There are nights where one or both don’t really feel like sex, so they part at the crime scene. There are even a few nights where one of them, usually John, gets a text just requesting a hook-up, but those nights don’t happen too often. Not that either will admit it, but they both like spending time together before….spending time together. But one thing is for certain, when they see each other, they usually fall into bed, and in the morning they both woke up alone.
“Tell me about it… but she lucked out, timing wise I mean.” Sherlock just stared at him, confused. “I got shot six months later. She’d have been stuck; she’d look like a monster if she left me then. She did reach out to me after I got back. Told me that she felt horrible about how things ended between us and that no matter what, she’ll always think fondly of me. It was so transparent; she just wanted to assuage her guilt. She was relieved we ended the way we did, no one wants to be stuck with someone broken.” John said with a forced laugh. He didn’t know why he was saying all this to Sherlock. He’d never said it too his mates, nor to Ella, but somehow he felt comfortable enough to say it all to Sherlock, like Sherlock wouldn’t judge him. Ridiculous really, he’d only known the man less than twenty-four hours.
“The guys – uh – they sometimes refer to you as ‘Mr. Thursday Night.’”John mumbled, feeling his own cheeks heat up. “Because of the fact that – um – that I’m always busy with you on Thursday nights.” He explained. All true; but still, John knew how it sounded, and he didn’t want that kind of implication – an implication of a more than friends relationship – to drive Sherlock away. It wasn’t helping that the about three quarters of the table had gone quiet and was now watching them.
Sherlock lay in bed, listening to his parents move around, until finally the house grew quiet, and he knew it was safe.  Dressing quickly, Sherlock slipped out his bedroom window, and dropped down into his backyard with practiced ease. His parents and the police may have been fine starting the investigation in the morning, but Sherlock wasn’t. When he walked into the police station the next morning, Sherlock planned to have some solid leads, or at the very least, eliminate all doubt that John hadn’t left of his own volition.
ordinary, that they couldn’t see what they had with someone as extraordinary as Sherlock.” John said coolly, never once breaking eye contact. “I mean, anyone with even half a handful of usable brain cells would have held on to him and refused to let him go. The fact that Sherlock Holmes was once willing to give you the time of day… Every day you should have been thanking fate, God, gods, your lucky stars, whatever. Every day waking up next to Sherlock Holmes, every night going to bed holding Sherlock Holmes, is a gift. But like I said, you’re too stupid to see that, and your loss was my gain. I should actually be thanking you, really.” He added with a humorless chuckle.
“Definitely. Oh, and before I forget.” John said, opening up his desk drawer and pulling out an oddly shaped package, wrapped in paper covered in laughing Father Christmases. “It’s nothing much, I just saw it one day and thought of you. Just don’t open it until Christmas Day, and don’t even think about trying to deduce what it is. I purposely put it in a different box.”
“Shit.” John grumbled, shifting the box in his arms as he struggled to unlock the door to his building. Honestly, what did they have to pick the building with the most annoying locking system – in order for the door to unlock you had to simultaneously turn both the key and a small lever to the left or else it wouldn’t budge. Did the designer not realize that perhaps people may not have both hands free when unlocking their door? Obviously not.
“No, not him.” Mr. Watson said, putting up his arm to block Sherlock. “If John really has been taken, I don’t want him involved. He fashions himself some super sleuth, and he probably got my kid taken.”

John frowned. That didn’t make any sense. “Apologize? Apologize for what?”
– I need you to take me, fill me –
“I know that, Dear, I just meant…” she paused, looking a bit embarrassed. “Well, I assume you’ll eventually be moving down to the other room once Sherlock’s more healed. Don’t worry though, this room is still yours, it’s still included in you boys’ rent.”
“That’s what I just said.” Sherlock frowned.
“His name is Mycroft,” Sherlock sighed. Leave it to Mycroft to find a way to butt into everything. “He occupies a minor position in the British Government, which is code for running the British Government from the shadows. Unfortunately for me, he’s also my older brother.”
