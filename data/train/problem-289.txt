“John…we both know you…enjoy sex,” he said, wanting to make certain it didn’t sound like he was shaming the man or anything. That was another thing he’d read about. The belief that asexuals shamed others for sex, especially bisexuals and pansexuals due to their affiliation with more than just one gender. He’d never shame anything about John. “You won’t be happy without it.”
Jim was already nodding, however. “I can’t imagine it was safe for men like us,” he murmured quietly. “I’m sure a gorgeous bloke like you left more than one heartbroken lass with a glad eye.” John predictably started at the compliment, before looking pleased as a cat with cream. Or a sniper with a gun. “I have to say though, their loss is my gain.”
“Oh please, I have no interest in looking at your latest porn collection, John. Nor do I wish to read any insipid poetry this latest paramour of yours might have inspired in you. I have to deal with enough of it in your blog already.”
John simply smiled. “I know. I wouldn’t expect you to.”
John huffed, annoyed at his colleague’s reaction, and set the man’s coffee cup nearby, tossing two sugar packets next to it in mild rebellion. He wasn’t Sherlock’s bloody servant. “‘Ah’ what, Sherlock?” he asked with a small amount of bite. Of course the man would deduce it all.
Sherlock never really cared much about labels. He wrapped his high functioning sociopathy around himself like a cloak, armour, but it hadn’t been because he needed the label for himself. No, the label had always been for others. So, he really didn’t care about the actual label of his sexuality, not really, didn’t care if he was asexual, grey-sexual, demi-sexual, or any other sexual. He only cared that he wasn’t alone.
And then Sherlock’s voice began to go.
“Oh, it’s no problem, really!” the man said hurriedly. “I was just on my way to get myself a cup, so I can easily get two more.” He flashed John a bright smile. “Please, it’s my fault.”
But the truth of the matter is that I AM in love with you, lord help me, and I should probably get my head examined for brain damage, but there it is. I know I’ve spent years saying I wasn’t gay, and well I’m not. But I’m not straight either. I’m bisexual. Which, actually, is the first time I’ve ever said that out loud. Typed out loud? Whatever.
“I guess you could say this isn’t the first time I was someone’s gateway gay,” Jim murmured, pitching his tone just shy of melancholy, dropping his gaze down to his pint, letting his own rueful smile tug at his lips.
“Wine too?” John asked with a pleasant wryness. “If it weren’t for the fact that I know how you feel about marriage, I might suspect you were going to propose, Sherlock,” he teased. Sherlock, predictably, gave a rather rude sounding snort causing John to laugh, not looking the least bit peeved.
The joy that lit up John’s face was worth it. So was the kiss that followed it. And when the kiss ended, and they simply held each other as they fell asleep, Sherlock knew that it would always be worth it. It would always be good enough.
The End
“I appreciate the gesture,” Jim said with another shy smile, placing his hand on John’s arm. “But I’m a big boy. I can handle myself now. I was just still a little jumpy last night, sorry.”
John’s head had snapped to the strange man the second he’d heard his voice, the blood rushing in his ears, and he had to steady himself on his cane.
“Fine, we’ll take this one,” he said with menace, before turning on his heel and stalking out of the office. “Come along, John!” he all but shouted. John rolled his eyes towards the ceiling, sharing a long-suffering sigh with Lestrade, before another shout of, “John!” had him slumping out after the madman after throwing his still full cup of coffee away.
John watched, a little bemused, as Jim threw him another small smile before hurrying away as though embarrassed. He didn’t quite know what to do with what just happened. He blinked, looking down at his palm, finding a phone number and a little smiley face written there in blue ink. Right. So…so he’d just got a bloke’s number.
John doesn’t really know how to react to that, and tries to sound convincing as he reclaims his hand, “No.” His reply falls a bit flat, but he turns his eyes down to glance at the pavement, and Mike acts like nothing unusual is taking place.
If Mike notices, he’s still not communicating as such, and John speaks up after seeing the touch between the two younger people. “Is that it?”
He could do this. For John. Always for John.
“Trust me, John. It’s really not my area, nor do I even want one. I shudder to think of the obligations being soulmates entail.”
“Incredible. That was amazing, really.”
Jim’s expression brightened as he smiled at John. “Really?” He hummed at the thought. “Had I gotten that text, I would have agreed in a heartbeat,” he murmured.
penis in his hand? And what the hell did it even look like?
“Yeah?” John asked with a small predatory smile.
physically self-conscious about, it was his genitalia and his proficiency in using it.
It’d be so simply, so easy to find out…he just wasn’t sure he was ready for that just yet.
“What’s wrong then?” John asked, refusing to be deflected. “No, don’t lie,” he said firmly but not unkindly when Sherlock opened his mouth, causing the other man to snap his jaw closed and let out a huffing sigh.
“Don’t worry,” John whispered. “I’ll stay.”
Uneven footfalls. Slight hesitation of the right leg. Limp. Even though Sherlock had only been there a day, he seemed to have already made a reputation of himself, and very few nurses or other staff willingly entered into his room. He preferred it that way, honestly, but this one didn’t seem wary at all. Yet.
John smiled at him, setting the cup of water aside. “He told me a little bit more about what you do.”
The parents were a well-to-do couple with only one child, age 15, who I’ll call “L”, who had a penchant for trouble ever since meeting her current boyfriend (18) last summer. According to her father, the boyfriend, let’s call him “R”, was not the sort of boy he approved of for his daughter who was not yet even of age, and though he had originally forbidden her from seeing him again, he had a feeling she was still seeing him. The weekend hols had been partly in an attempt to keep L and R apart as well as general family time. While the family was gone, R “broke in” and ransacked the place while stealing the valuables and leaving before any of the neighbours were any the wiser. And why the quotation marks? Because he had a key. Given to him by none other than L herself.
Really, it was Sherlock’s own fault that John let out a deep moan, causing Sherlock to freeze in shock again. John was about to pull away and apologise when Sherlock let out a small growl and pulled John in closer, one hand moving to slide down John’s back to cup his arse through his jeans and pull him in closer. John’s body certainly took an interest in that, and he could feel himself twitch in question, but he was also aware that Sherlock was still sick, or at least recovering from illness. With a force of will he really hadn’t known he had, he forced himself to pull away.
He froze.
Sherlock shifted, clumsily, trying to mimic what he’d seen in the pornography he watched, though it lacked the grace and John ended up pushing Sherlock a little bit away as he tumbled too near, pulling his mouth away as he softly panted.
They’d parted ways with one last look, Jim getting in a taxi which almost seemed to be waiting for him, despite knowing the man hadn’t had time to call for one, but John had decided that a bit of walking would clear his head some. He didn’t want to be completely pissed when he went home to Sherlock.
John wondered if Sherlock knew that he had saved John’s life that day.
It was a spacious room, a studio flat equipped with large windows with modern wood flooring and sleek appliances, which left little space for an intruder to hide with its mostly open concept design. John tried not to stare too much as he checked each room, feeling like it was almost an invasion of privacy checking Jim’s bedroom, before he felt confident in expressing the room ex-boyfriend free. He returned to Jim with a smile, shaking his head.
Shaking his head, John moved to set the kit on the counter that doubled as a breakfast bar as well as the only real divider between the main room and the kitchen, standing next to the barstool chair on his side of it all. “You really need to let the lip heal, otherwise you might need to get those stitches after all.”
“Maybe I should,” Sherlock smirked. Judging by John’s grunt, he seemed to agree. Sherlock let his hands continue sliding over John, kissing the man deeply, letting himself grow comfortable before trying anything else. He really didn’t mind this part. In fact, he could go on kissing John like this for a while. So he did.
Getting more and more irritated, now John is carrying on like he hasn’t noticed at all, not yet taking the business card. “We’ve only just met and we’re going to go and look at a flat?”
Spotting John, the second American already had his hand upraised, and fired two shots. Victor went over with a groan, hand up toward his chest as far as John could tell from his post. Another shot ringing to also bring Sherlock down into a crumple on the floor, but it was clear enough that the American had taken a head shot, firing even as he began running for the front of the shop.
Harry had come then, dragging John off to meet Cousin So-And-So, someone John hadn’t even known existed–and certainly didn’t care now. He didn’t see his mystery vision again after that. At least, not at the wedding.
As he walked back into the living room, Sherlock was hanging his coat, and turned to look toward John cautiously. Rubbing his hands nervously over the sides of his suit, the first set of real clothing he had worn since being shot days before. It was his usual mode of dress, but right now it seemed not to fit him, at least emotionally.
“Is that all, then? To make someone yield…?” Someone or Sherlock. John let it linger there between them, but his eyes were suggesting it was the latter, and Sherlock darted his own away so he could pretend to sort out the items he’d drawn from his bedroom, gathering them up.
“Secondly,” John went on, “something with more bite to it. I brought some scotch, which is over there in the cabinet, and the spicier version of the popcorn sounds promising. Help yourself to some of the scotch if you want it, make us up a batch of the popcorn, and I’m going to go take a shower. Then we can start.” John was taking due care to give rather specific instructions, waiting long enough for Sherlock to release the air, and take in more, before nodding to him. He wasn’t hovering, but he was detailing Sherlock’s attitude toward the change in his own, pleased with the results as the younger man’s skin took on a deeper flush, eyes like blue and green stained glass darting from place to place to make sure he knew where to get the items, and in what order he should perform the actions.
“Trevor and I…” Sherlock started, flare of distress getting a hold on him again, renewing the need to have his fingers twist about one another as he stood up. “It’s just that…we met, and…Well, you see we had prior plans for the theatre, and I was about to say when…”
“Sherlock, stay with me. Can you hear me, Sherlock? Sherlock?” It was an anxious whisper, and John was biting back more than a few tears, but he refused to give into terror. Realistically, he knew it wasn’t a terrible wound, but even for a seasoned soldier, it appeared to be a great deal of blood.
John is on the verge of saying something in response, but nothing is forthcoming, and he’s not even sure to whom the description was being given. He’s interrupted before anything spills out, and it’s from that same clipped baritone as when they entered the shop.
Once John was out of the shower, Sherlock drizzled the heated butter over the popcorn, gave it a few tosses, then did the same with the application of the spices. Two glasses of scotch were poured, because even though it wasn’t normally his drink of choice, he still needed more than just the wine from dinner to calm his nerves. Carrying everything into the sitting room on a tray, he sorted it out with napkins and water as well, standing by the coffee table until John appeared in the doorway and smiled about the array.
“So, I have to ask…smiley face and there…are those bullet holes in the wall, Sherlock?” John had a piece of buttered bread halfway to his mouth, hand suspended in time, as he changed perspective from the wall to Sherlock.
“Hello, there. Dozed off, did I?” He still sounded drowsy, but he was smiling well enough, and then studying Sherlock’s expression like one might read a beloved book. He could tell the younger man didn’t quite know what to say yet, as he only received a tentative nod in response, so he filled in the blanks for Sherlock. “Guess my bones do need a better surface, if I’m to get up tomorrow, and find that job.”
“Yea, yea, I will.” John hung up, went for his coat, and jammed the mobile in his pocket. He was about to head downstairs when that nagging sensation tickled at his neck again, and he went up instead. The gun wasn’t standard issue, wasn’t even legal, but he had it anyway. Locked up within a foam-lined case, hidden in the back of the closet, and then in the right pocket opposite his mobile and keys. The more he thought about what could be happening, the faster he got, and he rushed out without thinking of anything else beyond his need to locate Sherlock and determine that he was safe.
“Well, this is a prime spot. Must be expensive.” John’s eyes were surveying the room, the various layers of clutter and boxes, and he looked into the kitchen briefly. A microscope on the table, more clutter, more boxes, but it had all the amenities his kitchenette did not have. Focus shifting to the chair when Sherlock pulled the pillow out of it, he quickly assessed it, then lifted his eyes to Sherlock’s. “This could be very nice. Very nice indeed.” Clearly, Sherlock was ill at ease, and not sure how to go further with the conversation. Making sure his eyes were portraying the same warmth that was spreading itself through his chest, John smiled reassuringly to the younger man, then seated himself in the older piece of furniture. “Soon as we get all this rubbish cleaned out … Oh.”
“There must be something about the number three,” stated Sherlock, sounding slightly more confident. “Everyone always gives up after three.”
Sherlock and John attempt to get to know one another better, a curve thrown in the mix that leads to John not being sure he was reading the situation correctly, and Sherlock being a pining gay baby. (Bit of angst, but a happier outcome is coming.)
“You will recall Lord Blackwood?” Mycroft arched one eyebrow, but did not get to go further with his explanation, because Sherlock let out a real shriek then.
Sherlock thought he could detect some resignation when he dared looking back at the doctor, and he just barely bit off a sound of disquiet. He didn’t really know how to respond, and chose instead to duck his head forward, then go more sedately into the kitchen to finish putting their meals on plates, collecting silverware, and preparing their tea. He could tell the mood was shifting back to the bad end of things, and maybe that is why he chose to use the heavy teacups with matching saucers, solid ceramic more than china, the embossing of frills around the edges being a bit more crudely designed than most of his pieces. There was a strength in them though, a solidness that he sorely needed, though in deference to John he brought out the older man’s food and drink first.
At first, there was nothing. Another man would have stopped the manner of stealth John was utilizing, but he would rather look back and consider his actions too careful than have something go critically wrong, and regret it later. John had had enough of regrets, especially where Sherlock was concerned. A silence that seemed impenetrable, one that dragged on for several minutes, was all that met him. John was just about to proceed into the main part of the shop, taking one cautious step after another, when he heard it.
"Well, you’re the second person to say that to me today.” Mike is slowing his pace, but he isn’t turning to face John or make any sign that they are about to part ways.
Two questions at once, both aimed at the shop owner this time, the second one from John. “Who said anything about flatmates?” It’s not an accusation, though at first it appears the young man might be taking it that way, because he retreats a step or two in a direction that won’t take him to the stock in the back.
“Afghanistan or Iraq, Doctor?” There is a straightforwardness to his approach, that after the examination John has given of him, leaves the physician slightly nonplussed.
While this is going on, and not sure what else to do, John shifts a glance offside to the area behind where the tables were set. A grouping of settee and two clubs chairs around a coffee table, the items upholstered in black leather, piping the same shade of pink as on the tea canisters. There is a partially unfinished look about it, but John can’t quite figure out what is going on there, so he decides to try Mike again.
“How about this weekend?” Jim blinked at John’s words, apparently stunned at the sudden acquiescence, causing John to smile. “Hold on, let me ask this properly. Jim, Mr Worth, would you be agreeable to accompanying me to dinner this weekend on a date?”
John wondered if putting his letter on his blog would be a bit crass. He wondered if doing it would steal some of the spotlight from the others in the papers. His would be explained at least. He would leave a letter. Maybe tonight.
,” he emphasized. “Put on some clothes that don’t smell like your clinic,” he teased.
If Sherlock did this, maybe, just maybe, John might stick around for a little while longer. That was worth all the pain, all the discomfort, and all the anxiety in the world.
He was killing Sherlock.
As I’m well aware, you guys quite enjoyed that bit. Probably a bit more than should be acceptable, you lecherous readers.
Sherlock glanced at the tablecloth which was a lurid colour of pink, but it was the nearest to the actual colour he could get. Atop it, holding the twin candles, were candlesticks in the shape of lotus flowers, though sadly he couldn’t find any that were black. Five pips were scattered on the table, as well as a toy bus, a rubber snake, a pile of sugar, and a picture of Margaret Thatcher. He’d considered getting a comic book as well, but it seemed rather overkill, and he certainly didn’t want anything that might remind John of The Woman.
Perhaps he had misjudged everything? Did Jim block him? Maybe Jim wasn’t as into him as he’d originally believed. It was a distressing notion, and Sherlock being a massive prat wasn’t helping matters.
John stared at the sleek black chair. He hated it now. Or, he thought he might have, if he could have. He couldn’t though. He didn’t have the strength.
“John,” Jim moaned again against John’s lips, nipping at them as both hands now slid and caressed under John’s shirt. Through the thin material of his borrowed pyjama bottoms, John could feel the tantalizing heat of Jim’s body so close. His own hands sliding to Jim’s hips, he pulled the man closer, causing a whimper to leave Jim as he pushed down against John. “John…fuck…” he breathed, pressing down as John pushed up.
“Does that mean I can’t kiss my doctor in gratitude?” Jim asked with a small smile, before dropping his gaze again at John’s look, hunching his shoulders further.
But it wasn’t possible. He had to do this for John. He loved John, even if the man didn’t quite return the strength of his affections, but he had to do this. Prude, he’d heard people like him called. Selfish, for not giving their partner what they needed. Frigid, unfeeling, robotic.
Two things happened then: the first was that John was instantly reminded of the state of Jim’s lip when a sound that was both pain and pleasure erupted from Jim’s throat, and the second was that he was instantly reminded of just what was beneath him. The suddenly feeling of a hard length that was not his own pressing into his belly woke John from his lust and alcohol induced haze, and he pulled rapidly away with a gasp of shock and dismay.
John didn’t seem to know what to make of the last bit, unused to such praised focused on his part of the tale. “Oh, yeah, he can be a bit much. I still can’t believe people are reading my blog, but who knows.”
“You’ve rejected all the ones I’ve given you!” Lestrade was saying, aggrieved by Sherlock’s continued bullheadedness. “If you want a case so badly, why don’t you take any of the nearly half dozen I’ve mentioned!”
“Because, you idiot, I have you. I don’t need sex as long as I have you,” John said, pulling back enough to smile up at Sherlock. “I’m never going to leave you again, all right? Not until you get tired of how stupid I am and send me on my way.”
All in all, it was a very strange day. More strange than any of you could ever possibly know.
It was really all too easy, even if parts of it left Jim
Sherlock grimaced as the cold water worked over his abused throat, knowing he was probably going to be hoarse for a while with how much he was coughing lately. Thankfully his injuries were on the mend. Perhaps he might even be able to escape the hospital soon, though…
Thickly swallowing, John shook his head quickly. “Not until you tell me why,” he said resolutely, back stiffening, shoulders squaring, legs planted in military pose. Normally the sight would have intrigued Sherlock, but now it just made his shoulders slump slightly. Things had been going so well…
Thankfully, it seemed the tide of patients were at its end, and John glanced at the clock with a small grimace of impatience. Only a few left, from the sounds of it, and then freedom.
“You’re not a nurse,” Sherlock repeated, despite not caring to repeat himself normally. “I’ve seen you three times reach as though for a coat pocket, and whenever someone says the word ‘doctor’ outside the room you automatically turn to look. You’re not normally a nurse.”
John rolled his eyes up towards the ceiling before looking back down at Sherlock in fond exasperation. “What is it now?”
“Why do you believe you don’t have a soulmate? You could be a speaker.”
Hesitating for only a moment, Sherlock took hold of John’s hands and slid them further back, placing him on his own arse as he slid further in again, pressing against John the right way this time judging by the sharp inhale of breath and the way he tensed beneath him. “John,” he breathed, low, deep, rumbling with his feelings for the man beneath him.
Well. That settled things.
“Mike, can I borrow your phone? There’s no signal on mine.”
Sherlock saw all this, took in everything he could, but it took too long for the observations to properly form into thoughts. By the time Sherlock’s lips mumbled out, “Afghanistan or Iraq?” the nurse was already gone.
John considered that question, and the way that it came out. There was nothing accusatory in the tone, and Jim looked merely curious about the answer. “I don’t know,” he said, still having a hard time connecting that word with himself, despite his and Jim’s proximity. “I honestly didn’t realize I was…bisexual…until recently.” He gave a crooked, wry smile. “You certainly helped that greatly. Without that, I don’t know when I would have come to terms with these
scent, and John Watson cried for everything he’d lost, everything he now no longer had a chance to have.
. He knew the stereotype was that gays knew fashion and dressed well, though he doubted Jim actually knew much about fashion. He seemed…like a cool bloke. Down to earth, but smart, and very each to talk to. And, admittedly, to chat up.
Jim knew that he had a jealous streak. He really didn’t like others playing with his toys, unless it led him to a better toy. And
“Oi, what’s all this then?”
Was that what Sherlock was asking John to do? Not necessarily the turning heterosexual part, quite obviously, but rather the Corrective Rape Therapy. For asexuals it was to force them to enjoy sex, to prove them wrong. Or to punish them for not enjoying it, in some cases. Sherlock wasn’t trying to learn to enjoy it or trying to punish himself; he merely wanted to let John know he could have it and Sherlock wouldn’t mind. Or at least as far as John was aware he wouldn’t mind.
Jim turned to John, grinning, and picked up his dropped bottle before standing. “Well,” he said, grin turning a little sly. “Maybe not
* * * * * * * * * *
“Was that when this happened?” John asked, keeping his tone mild, soft, like one would for a spooked animal, and indicated the bruising at Jim’s neck.
“What happened?” he asked with a frown after signing in.
Jim settled his hand over John’s arm again, giving it a small squeeze, and quietly drank his beer as they kept eye contact. John glanced down only briefly at Jim’s hand for a moment, his smile never failing, and Jim left it there for some time.
Sherlock nodded, drew in a shuddering breath, before moving to crawl into bed to wait for his partner. He didn’t remember when they started sleeping in the same bed, it just sort of happened one night and then John never left. And John, perfect John, had never tried to push for more. He simply held Sherlock, as he had promised to always do.
Mycroft did not visit—
Well. If I must.
John thickly swallowed, staring with wide eyes at the figure of Sherlock standing by the window, fading sunlight haloed around him, while he stared at John with a clenched jaw and narrowed eyes. There were twin spots of red anger on his cheeks, he could see that, but the man still looked deathly pale. “Sherlock?” he asked quietly, hesitantly. Why couldn’t he hear him?
Rape, John had called it. It brought to mind what else Sherlock had read about. Corrective Rape, though many rejected that term as it brought to mind that something needed to be fixed, was still a problem around the world. Homosexuals as well as asexuals, anyone who didn’t fit in a heterosexual point of view really, were frequently raped in some ignorant attempt to turn the victim heterosexual, as though it were a learned ability.
When he arrived at his sister’s place, she was already three sheets to the wind. Clara had locked herself in their bedroom, refusing to come out, even though the guests were trickling in. Harry went to pout in the backyard, leaving John to pull door duty. He went back and forth between the door, the kitchen to refresh the drinks and crisps, and the bedroom door to try to convince Clara to come out. She eventually did, and most of the guests stayed on until just after eleven.
It was concern that Mycroft might step from the room and discover them after all, that had him stumble forward, booted feet making light work of hurrying to the main staircase and furiously pounding his way upward to the third level of the country estate. The book was held against his chest, musician’s fingers stroking the green cover, much as if it was the book that needed the comfort in this scenario. It was his copy of Shelley, and there was no way he would leave it behind when he was dragged from the house to live with the hateful Lord Blackwood.
At first, Sherlock’s eyes only had that apprehensive look in them, and he opened his mouth to say something that didn’t make it out. Brightening, however, he did manage to find his voice. “So, you’ll take it on then? The…room…being in the flat, I mean.” He wasn’t in a frenzy, but he didn’t keep eye contact with John long either, and again the doctor thought there might be some subtext under the more obvious conversation going on.
John had finally made enough progress to take on a locum position. He only worked two days a week, but at least it got him out of the drab bedsit where he’d been lodging. Cane still in use though, he was carefully making his way down a rain-slick section of pavement one evening, a short stop at the Tesco taken after work to get his dinner.
“I can’t afford London on an Army pension.“ Mike looks genuinely interested, and it was the direction in which John was going anyway, so when Mike begins to walk in the direction indicated, John falls into step beside him. He hasn’t anything else to do today, and the last thing he really wants is to return the dull surround of his bedsit. John isn’t sure what Mike’s normal speed is, so he’s not certain if the other man has slowed down to accommodate for John’s limp, but he knows they aren’t going in the direction of Barts. “Where are you going?”
“And will continue to support yours bills and vote with you in the House. Yes, I know.” So this is what it had come to, and Sherlock couldn’t believe his lot. He wanted to bite at Mycroft, to cut him to the quick, but he had no ammunition at his disposal. Mycroft had the upper hand, as usual, and Sherlock was torn between his self righteous anger and despair.
October
The clock had him arrested. Time. He didn’t have much of it. Tomorrow, Mycroft had said. His esteemed bridegroom was expected, and Sherlock would be sold off. For a foolish moment only, he did contemplate running away. He could pack a few things in his plainest valise, and spirit himself away on horseback. Sherlock was an adept rider, testimony to years of trying to escape other things Mycroft had attempted to make him do.
“Oh, good. You found it. I mean…Well, I gathered that you read it, and I thought it might have listings that would assist in your search.” He spun about then, long legs making just three strides to reach the larger table by the couch, and then back as he offered a piece of paper with a list of clinics and their numbers. “And well, this…too. I took the liberty of screening for ones that were within two changes of the tube, ones that mention needing someone on a locum basis, and any that stipulated needing a doctor as opposed to a physician’s assistant. If these don’t work out, well…I can expand the search, of course.” It was more than clear that Sherlock had put time into the process, but also that he wasn’t sure how well received the information would be, and his gaze went from a fairly confident meeting of John’s to that anxious wavering.
A soldier’s instincts though, they told him something else was happening. Something was off. Wrong. Pulling up his contacts, he put in a call to Mike, who’d seen Sherlock after John had left for work.
If John is expecting a reassuring reply, he isn’t getting one for his trouble, because the shop owner points to the set he’s placed in front of Mike and resumes their business transaction. “I think that in a year or so, you’ll be seeing a lot more work from them. A good opportunity for the collector, if you’re interested, but I have others for you to see as well.”
“Oh.” Sherlock seemed startled, shaking fingers putting his cup and saucer on the round table to his left, then resting them at the top of each thigh. “I wouldn’t want you to…pay me back, Dr. Watson. The room would have needed…a few things, no matter the tenant.” He didn’t seem to know how to go on, and a head tilt was paired with his shifting back on the chair slightly, an attempt at comfort that didn’t naturally pair with the part of lips that were not summoning anything else to add.
John reacted as though slapped. Then the anger came.
He should go to bed.
If it weren’t for the fact that Jim was in it for the long game, he might have manoeuvred the night to take John back to one of his London flats and unleash that something hidden. Alas, he could not rush things, and he wanted John at ease. Preferably without too much drama of his burgeoning sexuality crisis.
chair, black leather and sleek, just like him. The violin rested nearby. An old cup of tea surprisingly not disturbed in the whirlwind of the Met’s clumsy paws as they rifled through their things.
Sherlock snorted, rolling his eyes. “Your simple little mind is so droll, John,” he said with flippant sarcasm, setting his polishing rag aside to test out the cords of his instrument.
“No?” John teased. “Certainly sounds like a date to me. You even kissed me.”
It was Sherlock’s turn now to let out a contemptuous snort. “I could never tire of you, John. Even when you bore me, I could never grow tired of you.”
“I suppose surgery would be out of the question too, what with your hand tremor. Surprised they hired you at all with your limp, even if it is psychosomatic, due to the rapid pace of hospitals. But then, I suppose it’s not truly an issue if it’s only psychosomatic. You should really fire your therapist, by the way. Which reminds me. Afghanistan or Iraq?”
—but he did send flowers with a pointedly mocking card, which Sherlock immediately had binned. It turned out, however, that they did not stay that way for long.
It was unlike kissing any woman he’d ever snogged, hard lines instead of soft curves, made all the more obvious as more and more of Jim pressed again him as their kiss deepened, and soon John knew just what it was like kissing a man. A moan from Jim sent the heat from John’s chest to his lower belly, and it was quite without thought when John pulled Jim tighter against him. Jim, apparently, had no qualms about such a thing, and he eagerly swung a leg over John to sit astride him, knees on either side of John as he pushed him against the backrest of the sofa.
“Why are these flowers tossed out?” a voice that sounded almost familiar asked, and Sherlock looked up from his phone to scowl at the person who had interrupted him. It was the nurse from earlier. The limping one. Except…

“It’s nothing,” Jim said. “I’m just glad you liked it. I haven’t had anyone else to really cook for in a while, I kind of miss it,” he laughed.
Congratulations
“Good.”
However, when John raised his hand to rub at his face, he saw the smudged ink there and recalled the earlier events of the day. Jim. He chewed on his lip, deliberating with himself, before drawing a deep breath. Well. He couldn’t deny that he was curious. And besides, one coffee date didn’t mean anything. One coffee date with a man. A fit man.
It was inevitable, of course. There was no way to avoid it. It might not happen any time soon, of course, but it would eventually. Eventually John would decide he’d had too much, would decide he needed more than what Sherlock could provide him, and he would leave. The inevitable conclusion to this farce of a relationship they were in.
Sherlock scowled, crossing his arms and looking away. “You like sex, John. I don’t. We’re really not compatible.”
Sherlock did his best to supress another cough, groaning from where he hid under the pile of extra pillows he had demanded, wondering if maybe he could just suffocate himself and be done with it. Especially as he heard the familiar approach of a nurse. Lovely.
As inexperienced in these matters as Sherlock was, however, he knew that John wouldn’t take it quite the right way if Sherlock just bent over the moment John arrived home. No, there had to be subtlety, build-up, and most importantly there had to be romance. Something Sherlock was still learning about.
“You know what?” Jim asked, in the same breathy tone. “I don’t bloody care.”
“I still very much want to go on a second date with you, and I certainly would very much like to snog you again, just…everything else will have to take time. But I want to try them. Eventually.”
It was Sherlock’s turn to take a startled step back, eyebrows once more in his hair as he stared back at John. It was exceedingly obvious that he hadn’t been expecting John to admit to his sexuality. Asshole. The shock didn’t remain evident on his face for much longer, however, and he frowned deeply at John.
John pulled back and rolled his eyes.
John was about to retort in anger again, before he processed Sherlock’s words, or rather the tone of his words. There was an edge to them, yes, but there was something else hidden there as well. Something…unsure. He swallowed down his anger, tried to organise his thoughts, staring at Sherlock as he worked his mind around an impossible thought.
Sherlock has showered, quite thoroughly, with all the necessary accoutrements he’d read about online, despite his alarm about such things. It needed to be done. So, he’d showered, waxed, trimmed, and overall groomed himself as the information online told him too, and picked out an outfit he knew that John found pleasing, pacing back and forth as he waited for John to arrive.
More silence.
Sherlock had, of course, masturbated before. He had a male body, after all, but biological arousal did not indicate sexual arousal. He took care of things as necessary, but it usually took far too long to climax, and he found it much easier to just ignore such things and continue on as normal, when available. He never enjoyed it the way he knew John did, so he doubted he’d really enjoy actual sex.
John sighed, rubbing his hands over his face before tossing aside the blanket they’d draped over themselves last night and standing up, cracking out his back with a wince. He really needed to stop sleeping anywhere other than a bed. Maybe next time he’d take Jim up on the offer of his bed after all—if there was a next time. He supposed that he would soon find out. Now that he was more awake, he could spell the glorious scent of coffee, though Jim was nowhere to be found. Or at least…he hadn’t been.
Jim, cheeks stained red, eyes wide but staring at nothing, lips swollen and bruised from John’s abuse and that which happened earlier, chest heaving for breath, and the tell-tale bulge in his trousers, laid sprawled on the sofa before John. John, whose eyes were equally as wide and whose chest was equally as heaving, was staring at the body before him like he’d never seen it before. He stumbled back, covering his face with a shaking hand.
He hadn’t known what the words would draw out of Sherlock, but the younger man straightened up, and looked nothing, if not morally offended. “There is nothing wrong with your bones, and if they don’t realize that, then they don’t deserve you working for them anyway. You were obviously a skilled surgeon, and you have an exceptional manner in helping people that need reassurance. Besides, the limp goes away, when you don’t think about it, and the shaking in your hand doesn’t happen when your mind is occupied properly. Your therapist may not realize all of this, but…” The more he spoke, the more irritated he appeared, and his teeth were clenching as much as his hands by the time he was done. Color had risen high in his cheeks, and John progressively became more and more astounded as Sherlock went on, but the visual of it hadn’t been enough to shut Sherlock down. It was only after realizing what had poured out of him, all that stain of pink drained out of Sherlock’s face, doing so even more quickly than it had shown up. “I mean…” Tongue-tied, he made an exasperated sound, wore a very desperate expression, then hurried out of the room to his own down the hallway. The door wasn’t slammed, but it was definitely closed more briskly than was required.
January
Clearly, this had been unexpected, and Sherlock eyes shifted into the greener range while the pupils dilated. Moving though too, once he’d knew he had permission, and the young man pushed his two pillows and extra throw toward the doctor’s leg. He sorted one pillow along John’s hip, put a throw over just his own feet, kept the one over his shoulders while allowing his head to finally escape, and rested his cheek on the solid firmness of John’s leg. The second pillow he kept as his shield to the rest of the room, his legs drawing up, and his feet doing more of that brushing together they seem to do when he was anxious or otherwise unwell. “Thank you.” It was a whisper at most, but John rested his hand on Sherlock’s head, touching the menu button the remote with the other.
“Yes, my dog bit him, but he hasn’t held it against me.” He jostled Sherlock with a press of his knuckles to the slighter man’s upper arm, then carried on with equal energy. “Turns out we’re both in chemistry, so we’ve been running around ever since.” He twisted about then, arm circling the other young man’s shoulder, tugging Sherlock toward him. “Anyway, we’re late…Come on, ‘Lock. If we don’t leave in the next five minutes, we’ll miss the opening.” Popping up to his feet then, he nodded to John. “A pleasure to meet you, Dr. Watson.” He waved lightly, then pointed down the stairs. “I’ll catch a cab, ‘Lock.” Off he ran, not waiting to catch whatever John or Sherlock said, the door downstairs heard slamming in a way that left a strained silence in its wake.
“You must be Dr. Watson. Please…come in. I’ve been doing some baking, and I’ll be right up with some muffins and tea, but Sherlock is already upstairs.” She’d said this all in a flurry, with hardly a breath taken, and drawn to one side so John could come through into the entryway. True to her words, there was flour on her hands, and she didn’t offer either of them to shake with John.
As for John, he didn’t move so much as a centimeter until he did hear the dinnerware being put into the racks. Glancing at his own leftovers, and muttering “Damn fool” again to himself, he carried the remainder of his meal into the kitchen. Skimming the few food bits into the bin, he was going to rinse and sort as Sherlock had done, but the younger man took it off his hands before he could. It didn’t leave him off kilter though, because he had a reasonably good idea now, right where he stood–on several matters.
Sweltering heat for London, but John had done some recovery, so he was trying to take a walk around the park near his bedsit. Staying with Harry hadn’t worked out, not after the wedding, but John didn’t begrudge the newly-married their privacy. If any timing could have been better, it would be that John go out later in the evening, instead of the lunch hour.
Mike emits a short laugh, his ruddy cheeks more florid than when they began, a combination of his present humor, the exercise, and the light wind coming down the strip of street they’ve been on the last minute or two.
For a short time after Sherlock’s sudden retreat, John continued to sit in his chair, considering what exactly it was that the younger man said, that had set off his own sudden reaction. It didn’t take long for John to decide it was to do with the therapist comment, and he hadn’t yet gotten around to asking Sherlock how he knew there was even a therapist to discuss, but there was now a more pressing concern.
Over the course of the next two weeks, Sherlock and John began settling into a pattern of domesticity. On the nights he didn't have class, he and John would eat the dinner he'd prepared, and then sit in the living room and explore more films together. John had gotten his second pick of jobs from the list Sherlock had provided, and had exchanged it with the younger man for a list of his favorite foods, drinks, etc. He only worked one night shift during those two weeks, and Sherlock had two nights of class, but mostly theirs was an evening life together. Sherlock still had the teashop to work in during the day of course, and on his lunch breaks John would stop in so they could either go out or eat a packed lunch in the back room. A bell had been installed the first week, so if a customer came in, Sherlock would hasten forward to wait on them.
He didn’t slam the door in his wake once entering his own domain, but sagged backward against it, all but drained of all the energy that had just moments ago been keeping him wound tight as any ormolu clock. Perhaps that was why his ever-changing-colored eyes tracked to the one on the mantelpiece above the fireplace of his room, a delicate chime to apprising him of the half hour in just a minute. The rest of the room might have helped his mood under more ordinary circumstances, his table of experiments in pride of place behind a screen on the opposite side of the space, the calming blue that dominated the four poster bed's arrangement of pillows and bedspread, the matching chair that he sat in light into the nights, reading from books of gothic romance.
Don’t think I can make it. Thank you for the offer, and I hope you find a good flatmate. The university must be full of other young people that need housing or will after the Winter Break. - John W.
He and Sherlock had just solved a case, because it turned out the florist gig had been a front for the consulting detective’s real work. After a short movie attempt, Lestrade had texted with a level eight, and they’d thrown off the blankets and pillows to race to the scene.
August
The decision to search the internet for information about Sherlock had already led John to the shop’s website, where John quickly read through the About page, which really did turn out to be more about the shop than the owner. In fact, the owner’s first name wasn’t even listed, leaving John to wonder if Sherlock just really wanted his privacy or it belonged to someone else. To John at least, there seemed to be an incongruity with Sherlock’s appearance, his obvious intelligence, and working in a shop. His instincts told him there was a story to it all, and until he’d been shot at least, his instincts had generally served him well.
After the disarray of the main room downstairs, John wasn’t too certain what he’d find in the bedroom on the upper level. The door was open, as was the window across from it, letting in a breeze and airing out the space. The drapes at the window were a light mocha in color, but a moment was all that passed before John realized they weren’t mimicking the dreadful beige of his bedsit. Walking across the dark mahogany hardwood of the floor, his fingers lightly touched on the Greek key design that formed the embroidered border in a darker shade, with a hint of red to work with the furniture that made up the space. It was a subtle touch, and as John looked around the rest of the room, he noticed that it was one of many.
Sherlock gasped in a breath, but he was smiling a watery turn of lips, the tears ceasing with only the streaks of former one painting his cheeks. “I am yours. Even if you don’t want me. I can’t...I can’t belong to anyone else. You could stay. You wouldn’t have to leave, and...it wouldn’t be an imposition, and I would be good. I wouldn’t make it awful, I promise.” Still hesitant, there in the eyes, which were shifted to a stormier shade of gray.
“Not a word.” Mike murmurs at first, delivers a quick appraisal to the two others, then taps the Eden pattern to give the owner his decision on the available sets that he’s seen thus far. “Anything more?”
In this, John let him, “I have some Bonds films, a few horror movies, some Hitchcock, things like that. Do you like horror movies?” Wasn’t sure Sherlock would go in for that sort of thing, but the younger man nodded a little.
Tipping himself ever so slightly forward, he drew in a breath to get more of John’s unique scent into his olfactories, further immersed in the army doctor’s world by virtue of his shampoo, aftershave, and his own skin. Imagining what it would look like, Sherlock visualized the woods, not the dessert heat that might have been expected. The scent of the scotch added to this, but the aftershave brought in notes of musk, and leather.
The flag pillow was back in the chair, and John positioned it better to support his lumbar area, only then taking the set held out by Sherlock. The younger man’s fingers curled in against his palms, clenching before he turned away to sit in the chair of leather and chrome. John didn’t think the action had anything to do with being made to wait while he sorted himself out, but he sat in study a bit longer. Sherlock had his own set of tea items, but unlike John, he was on the edge of his seat and didn’t appear to be making himself comfortable. ‘Eager’ another passing thought for the doctor, followed by a more derisive one for his own condition, and why Sherlock should care what he wanted.
For those that had some trouble with S4 of Sherlock, I've put a bit of an Easter egg into this chapter. John and Sherlock share a movie night, and watch the film, Stay. Clues about the similarities between the film and the oddities of S4 should be apparent, but if you're interested in seeing more for yourself, I suggest this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3BU3yECMqM

Not light, but adoring, the nearly frantic kiss that Sherlock set to John’s lips. It grew more fevered, and John wound his arms around the detective, the ring box still in his hand behind Sherlock’s back. The detective pressed himself more securely against John, trying to leave no space between them, his head turning slightly so could John could shower kisses along the long slope of his neck, and then find his lips again. Sherlock made a sound like a whimper into John’s mouth, then ripped himself away, and forced his hand forward. “Put it on John, put it on.”
“Don’t you care that he will leave me a widower in a few years? Possibly saddled with a string of children to raise alone? Or is that what you’re hoping for? Hoping he will grow so tired of me that it kills him, and then I will have all his money, and someone new will buy me off you? A never-ending cycle, and I’m the brood mare with no say in it?” Sherlock’s omega status was something that was normally not brought into the relationship between them, for his mind was as sharp as Mycroft’s, and he’d been given great leniency in his studies and life overall. At least, in all other situations.
The front section of the shop is composed of tables covered in linen and understated damask cloths, matching napkins with silver, gold, and wooden rings set at each of the four stations. There isn’t a doily or slip of lace to be found. John realizes the tables are set at even intervals, giving the clientele enough room to move about, but still maintain a look of subdued sophistication. Each table has its own special set of china and tea ware, but the sets are unlike anything he’s seen before.
“He’s not…my young man. He never was. Never will be.” All the fight had gone out of him, his eyes lackluster now as he looked past the cup in his hand, at nothing that was real.
Mycroft was just about to start up once more, when Sherlock reached to save his precious book with a look of apologetic horror, and then rose to race past him to the door that led to the hallway. It slammed behind the younger man, and his older brother lifted the letter he had received only that morning. “If you had only let me explain…” Shaking his head, Mycroft circled back behind his desk, and sat down on the slightly cracked leather, lifting his quill to sketch out his reply.
“Well, I imagine you and Victor must do a lot of it, then.” Comment, not question, no bitterness or guile in the words, although his smile might have lessened some at the edges. Releasing Sherlock finally, John made one more turn, but it was to sit down in his chair.
Pushing at what should be the drawer pull on his nightstand, and then sliding out a section of wood that from the exterior looked like just an inlay of ivory, a smaller drawer popped out on the side of the furniture. His nimble fingers extracted the tiny box of treasures that he kept hidden inside, the lid lifted, and the contents gently explored until he had drawing in hand.
Sherlock could only smile, reassured that his efforts had not gone to waste, and work at eating at least some of the food he’d put on his own plate. About halfway through John’s meal, however, he pointed at Sherlock’s plate with his fork, “Eat. Mrs. Hudson is right about the birds, scientific or no.” The brunette frowned just a little, but instead of putting down his fork and possibly leaving the table, he forced himself to stomach another five or six bites to please John.
“Yes, Sherlock. Showing off is really the last thing you want to be doing right now. If you’re a good boy though, maybe we’ll end this nice, and you can be doing Victor instead.” John had to guess that meant Victor was the first thing Sherlock would want to be doing, but he absolutely would not let that cause his temper to rise any heigher than it already was, not if endangered Sherlock.
No time to think about it, John was brushing the matted curls off Sherlock’s forehead, unable to lift the whole onto his lap where he knelt down. A good amount of red was running in a stream from just over Sherlock’s left ear, and John was assessing the damage.
“I don’t care what you were saying, don’t you understand that?” Sherlock was almost grabbing at his riot of dark curls, ones he kept unfashionably long despite the preferred current styles sported by young men his age that were attempting to be The Beau or Admiral. “No! I won’t. I won’t, damn you!” To this point, Sherlock had been holding a book of poetry, the volume he had been enjoying when Mycroft invaded the territory and the demands. Now, the same volume tumbled to the floor, spine so soft from the book being opened over the year, that the whole thing was splayed –very much like Sherlock- to Mycroft’s eagle eyes.
30th January - My New Flatmate
They were all so invested in this discussion, they missed Sherlock's eyes flickering open, and John was actually surprised when he felt the long fingers of the violinist slide into his own. That hand could have easily encased his own, but Sherlock had chosen to be the one covered by John's smaller, heavier hand. "I do. Want you, in that way. He knows it."
"I said I would look after him, and I will. Even if he doesn't want me...in that way." John refused to look despondent over the idea, and wouldn't let the echoes of "because I am broken, I am old, I have nothing to offer him" go through his mind. Obstinate, he was. Especially about this.
It was a pleasure watching Sherlock at work. The movements, his long arms and torso extended as he spread out the duvet, then thought better of it, draping it along the back of the sofa instead. For just a moment he was spread, arms to each side, his cheek turned to press into the midway point so the air trapped beneath would be pushed out to the ends and possibly just to feel the comforting softness against his face. Smoothing, his musician’s fingers getting rid of creases and folds, the dressing gown was caressing his sides and drifting over his lean hips as he spread the duvet, curls without any product bouncing at the back of his head, the flex of his toes that John was learning came with concentration. The four throws he’d drawn out of storage were shaken loose, two each for he and John, but he let John’s stay folded while his own were coiled and fluffed. Loosening his frame, it could only be said that he snuggled down into the throws then, pulling a pillow onto his lap, his chin resting just over the edge as he drew up his knees.
"Just a bit of Epson salts, a dose of Alexandrian senna, some bruised ginger..." Musing to himself, he was still careful to make sure the measurements he added were more precise than the words as he whispered them with a somewhat jaded glee. Yes, Lord Blackwood was in for a rare surprise when he visited tomorrow, and Sherlock could not wait to see the results of his preferred type of labor.
The end of the remark brought his words up short, because Sherlock had suddenly interjected an explanation as he waited for John to seat himself. “Yes. Yes, I think so. My thoughts precisely. So I went straight ahead and moved in. Obviously I can, um, straighten things up a bit…more.” He was saying this, but Sherlock’s right hand was lifting from the clutch of the pillow, and he was sinking his long fingers into his curls to give them a harried tug. His lips opened and closed a few times, but he dashed forward to close his laptop, and straighten a few files by putting the pillow on the desk. He apparently then forgot the pillow entirely, as he began tapping his hands lightly together, eyes changing from the blue-green to a more stormy blue-grey once they were back on John. Glancing sideways though, he wasn’t in one place long, because he lifted a stack of mail and darted to the fireplace, stabbing the assortment of envelopes into the mantelpiece using a multi tool knife.
He took the tube as far as possible, then made slow progress down the sidewalk to 221. He’d planned on the job hunt after stashing his boxes in the bedroom upstairs, but was exhausted from the walk to the new address. Mrs. Hudson was on the phone when he knocked on the door, but she let him inside with a pleased smile and a wink, then darted back to her flat on the main level. Just enough energy to carry both boxes upstairs, John entered B flat, and found that Sherlock was not there. In point of fact, he didn’t see anything that told him whether Sherlock had made it back after going to the theatre with Victor, and John pushed the DVDs and books onto the shelves behind his chair with a bit more force than necessary. Separating the kitchen items from those of the loo, he quietly went about distributing it all, setting the box with his clothing into the emptier one. Once in his own room, he sorted out the pants, socks, jumpers, jeans, and everything else with military precision. A couple of sport coats, and several pairs of trousers to hang in the closet, he put the empty boxes on the floor beneath them. He was just pulling on the chain to shut off the light when he heard the unmistakable sound of Sherlock coming into the flat, hanging up his coat, and hastening to his room beyond the kitchen.
Forty minutes later, John was standing in front of a black door with the plate numbers displaying 221B. Bit odd that, but he lifted the knocker, and waited to see who would be inviting him. The door revealed an older woman in a plum-colored dress, her face showing lines that spoke of years of laughs and deep thought, the lines now transforming as she smiled at John.
Clara thanked him, pressed a warm kiss to his cheek, and reminded him to take care of himself while they were gone. He’d nodded along, trying not to smart at being treated as someone as young as the child that had upset the case. John knew he was a bit embarrassed, despite the fact anyone else might just as easily have dropped the case in the commotion.
“Work?” The way Sherlock said it, and the sudden skittish air about him was enough to draw John’s eyebrows upward. “I thought…I mean…” The young man had shifted his hands together, and now they were clasping and twisting about in his lap, thumbs pressing into his palms as his breathing caught in a hitch. "Yes. Yes…alright, Si…” Lips pressing flat, the cupid’s bow disappeared, a frown dragging his eyebrows low as he looked offside toward the floor to his left.
Circling to the alleyway, John sent a spare look around his surroundings, all that he needed to get his bearings. There were pools of water from rain earlier in the day, and a couple of dumpsters with their lids pulled back, but not overflowing their debris. No signs of a human presence or any indication there had been one in the last few hours. He slipped past the brick exterior, not quite walking sideways, keeping the shop’s walled edifice protecting his back and shoulder.
“Of course.” There is a sharp break in between, but then as Sherlock turns to go back into the room he’d been occupying before, he glances to John long enough to thrust another question his direction. “How do you feel about the violin?” After which he disappears for another few seconds, returning only when he has two more possible choices in his hands.
Just as fast as this is said, the young man is back to speaking to Mike, just as briskly as before. “Now, these are from Bernardaud and Deshoulières, Eden and Dhara bleu patterns, respectively. More traditional, but they will add color to her existing collection.” The former was turquoise blue, with an overlay leaf and flower pattern in gilt, the motif inspired by 19th century designs. The latter, turquoise on top, but a deep plum on the bottom, the overlap in silver, light pink, and traces of copper creating a design that spoke of Indo-Persian ornamentation.
“Do you...That is, we’re home...and I...” Sherlock took the cup and the bell, but didn’t seem to know what to do with either of them. Leaning forward, past John, he looked questioningly toward the doctor. John nodded, not sure what was going on precisely, and Sherlock set both of them down. “Sir, can we be...us? I mean, can...” He huffed, not knowing what to say or how to get the words out.
Mike pats his stomach, a cheery smile on his face, “Yeah, I know. I got fat!” There’s no bitterness in comment, just stating the facts as he sees them, and obviously pleased to see John after so long. He’s pumping John’s hand with considerable enthusiasm.
His head was starting to hurt, but the tears were still collecting on his cheeks, and he hauled himself up onto the window seat to look down at the fountain that was coursing over in the courtyard below. The Eros statue that composed the central piece was as erect as ever, gathering moss at an atrocious rate, now that the estate was down to just two men to tend the grounds.
John and Mike were outside the shop, drinking tea while Sherlock helped a customer, and Mike was weighing his next words. "Fond of him or in love with him?" For all his easy manners and ability at banter, for not making feel pressured or off, Mike wasn't a stupid man either. He knew what he saw in his old friend's eyes when he looked at Sherlock, and he knew what he saw in Sherlock's as well. He knew that had to be eating away at them both, so this news was unwelcome, and maybe he could help. He was a doctor too, after all.
“You fix this. You fix this now.” Scraping those teeth now, sliding them against one another, he finally ended up biting his bottom lip so hard it nearly bled.
John would have smiled at this, but he was too live-wired right now, and an expected third voice cut through the conversation.
From the stone edifice outside with the lions rampant, to the paneled alcoves and grand staircase they had all passed to access an unlikely elevator, John could tell the residence was no simple home. Paintings hung on the wall, some of the portraits in gilt frames dating back to possibly the seventeenth-century, an occasional shape of face or unusual eye color leaving no doubt the home belonged to the Holmes family. Ornamental carvings and everything highly polished, he didn’t contemplate the amount of staff it would take to keep the place in working order, because he was too intent on watching the medical staff that went into full action once they entered the suite for Sherlock.
Date is off. Ordering takeaway. What would you like from Angelo’s? No reason for Sherlock to know, just yet anyway, that it had been John that canceled the date.
“Well, in that he is right at least.” Sherlock winced. It was a low thing to say, not his brother’s fault entirely that his heart wasn’t going to allow him the exertion necessary to find a bride, join with her, and then play at fatherhood on top of his other responsibilities with the House of Lords.
“But, not this time. Damn, the weather, and damn Mycroft, and damn you Lord Blackwood.” The clock, as if to mock him, did chime in a lively way then. Hearing it, Sherlock drew his long limbs toward his chest, trying to formulate a different plan to keep him from the wedded state. The book was set aside, for it would not be giving him any real answers on how to improve his lot.
“It’s fine. I don’t mind. Another?” John’s voice had taken on a different timbre at the late stage of the hour, and the credits were rolling as Sherlock uncoiled from a newly protective posture with his pillow shield back in place. Like an unwound clock, the younger man loosened, agile limbs splaying as he looked to the television, then back at the doctor.
Mike didn't want to judge, so he nodded quietly in the process of absorbing this last part of what John told him. A few more drinks of his tea, the cup was empty, and he turned toward the door of the shop so he could return the dish to Sherlock. "I hope you know what you're doing, and that it all goes well. Just don't miss out on someone like Sherlock, because...You know." You're unwilling to fight for him, you're concerned about being too old, you're not sure of how he feels. Mike knew he didn't have to say all that.
Mrs. Hudson tutted a bit as they arrived, explained she had stocked the fridge, and also ordered take away to delivered later in the evening. Beyond that, perhaps with the intuition of mother figure, she departed and did not say anything further. John did a quick check to take inventory of the fridge contents, and set about pouring out the tea she’d already had prepared in the kettle. It didn’t escape his notice that she had set out matching cups, not the expensive ones from the elaborate set, but a simple nice pair in black and blue. Sherlock might be appalled by the situation, but he had feeling that it wouldn’t be an issue.
“Why are they so dull? They have no facial expressions.”
“Most people don’t know that a good cup isn’t just about the leaves or how long you let the tea brew, but also the temperature of the water. Different teas require their own temperature. The best leaves in the world won’t be palatable if you don’t use the right water temperature.” Sherlock rattled all this off, and then sucked in a breath past his teeth, waiting to gather his courage apparently for the more difficult topic for which he didn’t have a previous background knowledge. “I…that is, Mrs. Hudson suggested quantities, but I purchased the items. You will have looked in the trunk of course, and found the extra pillows. I wasn’t sure if…well, if you would want them on the bed all the time, but…they might serve a useful purpose at some point.” Apprehension clear, Sherlock’s eyelashes fluttered, cup shielding his lips as he turned it up to sip his tea.
The smallest of nods from the young man in return, and Sherlock whispering, “I understand,” was enough for John to then do an about-face, and head for the stairs to reach his room. All in all, he was pleased with the result of the evening so far, and looking forward to the remainder of it. If there was that voice in the back of his head reminding him of Victor, well, it would have to be dealt with in his own way, but not right now.
The next hour and a half went by with Sherlock puzzled, then completely rapt. Having seen the film himself innumerable times, John was more interested in the young man’s reactions, because he’d seen interesting ones as a result of the events unfolding on screen and he knew Sherlock was far more intelligent than his shy demeanor would allow him to normally exhibit in John’s company. He didn’t answer the questions directed his way, but it was clear that he enjoyed everything Sherlock was asking, rapid as the questions were:
He’d been watching from afar for some time now, biding his time until the perfect moment presented itself. It really should have been quite easy, because he was an experienced man after all. While he’d not have more than one or two serious relationships in the past, he was skilled at introducing himself, and initiating the first date. But this time, it wasn’t like that. Somehow, instinctively, he knew it was different. If this happened, if he took that step, it might be a forever situation.
“Yes, it is dear, but you must hurry.” She lowered her voice then, peeking up toward the landing a moment, before saying anything further. The coast was clear, and she leaned in toward John before sharing the next comments. “He’s on his way to a strop. Has spent two days trying to clean up, and he never cleans.” Her eyebrows lifted, and her kind eyes were aimed at John rather directly, obviously trying to get him to understand how significant this was. She waved a hand toward the stairs then, and closed the door, hastening back to her own flat on the floor level.
Mike recovers first from the awkward lapse, and gestures down the street, offering information. “I’m teaching now, at Barts. Bright young things, like we used to be. What about you? Just staying in town ‘til you get yourself sorted?”
He did see Sherlock veer out from his bedroom, rather than the bathroom, on his return. No explanation, but he had a wariness in his eyes that said he was well aware John had seen, and that there might be something requested. Nestling back onto his pile with his bum, scooting and getting where and how he wanted to be, Sherlock’s knees pulled up toward his chest, one after the other. The whole time, he kept his eyes on John, even when he dragged his second throw up over his shoulders high enough that he was just hair and eyes.
“We can change that.” John was almost comically fast at pulling out his phone, which the vision was equally quick in swiping out of his hands, punching his information into the contacts section. John read off the name. “Sherlock Holmes.” It was like honey on his tongue.
The two older men shared a nod of mutual respect, because though John would no doubt be angry again at Mycroft soon enough, right now he was just too grateful and excited to waste time on the other emotion. Mycroft departed with Trevor, and John let his eyes settle on the form of Sherlock, with his flickering eyelids. He knew Sherlock wasn't asleep yet, but he said nothing further, simply covering the dark-haired young man's hand with his other, so that most of Sherlock's hand was contained in John's capable ones.
The stretcher was rolled into the house, for that is what it was, and the second ambulance drew up alongside the one from which they’d extracted Sherlock. Victor on his stretcher was pushed in behind the darker-haired man, but once they were past the point of an overly extravagant first floor, John saw that Victor was wheeled off into a separate private room on the second level across from Sherlock’s own.
“Hey, Mike. Yea, I’m…well…I’m just wondering if you knew where Sherlock was? He’s not replying to my texts.” John knew his own voice sounded tight, and he was curling his hand into a repeated fist as he waited just the few seconds for Mike to respond.
The vision touched his hand to his brow line, blocking out the sun, then rapidly turned the direction opposite to hasten down the alley nearest him. One minute stretched into two, then five, then ten. He did not reappear.
“You won’t get away with it. My brother is already on the way, and the cameras will have taken all the footage we need to have you put away.” Sherlock’s voice, but it didn’t sound certain. He normally did, when here, in his domain. Maybe not with John, but that was a different story, and John didn’t have time to dwell on it right now.
Point coming across, Sherlock’s pupils dilated, a deer in the headlights expression transforming him yet again. “I understand.” He nipped at his lower lip with his teeth, and touched at the collar of his pale lilac shirt, his neck exposed where the upper buttons had been left undone. It was a fashion he seemed to prefer, if this occasion and the one in the shop, were anything to go by. Gaining some courage from just a glance at the now cold cup of tea, he darted eyes back to John. “I can cook. I mean…Mrs. Hudson says I eat like a bird…which really doesn’t make any sense, because everyone knows birds eat a great deal, but well…I don’t eat very much, and sometimes I…Well, but I will make sure there is dinner waiting every night. For when…for when you come home from work.” He looked a bit deflated in how that had all tumbled from his lips, and they were parted when he stopped, but he was risking meeting John’s eyes again in what was obviously an attempt at approval.
“What?” John is on edge now, flashing Mike an almost defensive look, and his back definitely does straighten more before he hears a reply.
They continued, and Sherlock watched as a woman lived with a dog that was supposedly put down when the suicidal young man had been a child. She lived in a house with an empty refrigerator, and toward the end, the scenes had been played over and over with subtle differences in each replay.
That further sent Sherlock into his exploration, and he started slotting details into his Mind Palace, adding another leather club chair to the area already outfitted for John, and the formative stages of another room that carried the leather perfume through tools such as a crop, a small flogger, and straps for the bed that still had not been set in the bedroom. Shutting down anything further, his body beginning to very much betray his state, he forced an evenness to his breath before resting his hand on John’s bicep to give it a firm squeeze.
Determining his next course of action, John forced his shoulders back, and limped down the stairs with his cane in hand to sit down in the chair now designated as his. Newspaper on the side table where it hadn’t been before, he did a check of the date, and knew Sherlock must have placed it there for him to read. Better than an uncomfortable silence, so he took up the first section, and read over various headlines until Sherlock came into the space and stalled out just a step or two short of John’s chair.
“Ah, yes…Dr. Watson. I put…That is…” Sherlock must have caught himself using the more proper title, but he didn’t change it as he went on with his original explanation. “I put clean sheets on the bed, and there are towels, flannels, and an assortment of…products…in the loo. Help yourself…to…anything in the flat.” Not waiting to see what John had to say about this or how his face would alter either, Sherlock was back in a blur of motion, working out the necessary steps to ensure the cuppa was suitable.
“I suppose you could say that,” John said after a moment. His eyes flashed over Jim again, before nodding. “I was in the army,” he explained what Jim already knew. “And I suppose I, er, let myself enjoy the local life a bit too much sometimes,” he said with another small flush. “Er. Only women.”
Sherlock choked down an embarrassing sob, leaning forward to press his forehead to John’s chest, tightening his arms around the man. “John,” he whimpered.
“Oh, for heaven’s sake, John!” Sherlock suddenly snapped, startling both John and the cabbie so that the taxi swerved slightly, a soft swear on his lips. John glared at Sherlock after checking to make certain they weren’t about to crash into anything, scowling at the other man. “Do you have somewhere else you’d rather be?” Sherlock asked snidely, an ugly twist to his lips in a sneer, but strangely enough he was avoiding John’s eyes and was instead directing all his ire out the window still, arms crossed over his thin chest.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed, his lips puckering with petulance, but he seemed too weigh John’s words, or at least his tone and body language, and thought better of it because all he did was huff out a sigh and more pointedly turn towards the window to better ignore John, no longer gazing at his reflection. John let out a soft snort when the cabbie likewise let out a sigh, no doubt grateful his fare had stopped arguing in the back of his cab. Taking a calming breath, John tucked his phone safely back into his jacket pocket and refocused on the case file to lose himself in it for the rest of the trip.
Also, Jim gave me a bit of difficulty with this chapter, but I hope he's not too out of character. Please forgive any glaring issues.
Jim was, without a doubt, definitely flirting with him.
, he smiled, sliding his hand back to curl into Sherlock’s sweaty hair at the back of his neck and pulling him down as he leaned up on the balls of his feet.
Jim’s smile, though still shy, grew a little wider. “You could always pay me back another time. I know a better place to get coffee. Or…” Jim bit his lip again before giving a small shrug. “It doesn’t have to be coffee,” he added quietly.
John bit his lip.
“What do you want?” he asked a touch stiffly. “I’m off-duty now, Mr Worth.”
He glanced at his watch. He still had a few hours left before his date. Maybe he should shower again. Just to be safe. Maybe Sherlock was right, maybe he
“I will. I promise.”
“Our cases,” John breathed, stepping forward. The lights of the candles fluttered over his expression, turning it both soft and severe at the same time, but Sherlock knew he had done right. Good. “Sherlock, seriously, what is all this?”
John paused, and Sherlock worried he’d said the wrong thing, before John let out a whoosh of air and another wry chuckle. “Maybe,” John agreed, and he pulled Sherlock up into a gentle kiss. “Maybe, if you really want to, but it’s not necessary.”
It had started with what they thought was just a cold. Intellectually, John knew what happened to those with an unfulfilled bond, but it was rare and for a while John hadn’t even made the connection. Then the cold got worse, and something niggled in the back of John’s brain, but he still remained at a loss.
Much better than John had been anticipating, of course. The beginning had been strained, awkward, but then the next couple hours had seemed to fly by, and John found that he had rather enjoyed himself, enjoyed Jim’s presence. And, well, if Jim and he had somehow found themselves sitting a little closer together by the end of the night, neither of them seemed to mind. Truthfully, it seemed they had both managed to have more drinks than they had been expecting, and John had stayed out far later than he’d initially intended.
. Still, there was something waiting to be unlocked in John, and Jim only had to play his strings right to get John exactly where he wanted him. And then: Sherlock.
,” he murmured with a small tease, earning a smile from Jim which had been his plan all along. He hadn’t meant to turn Jim morose, and he wanted to fix that. “But probably,” he said eventually. “Dad wasn’t the most accepting of things, and mum didn’t help much in standing up for us. I have to thank them, though.”
he did. Whatever was between them, it certainly didn’t feel casual.
John didn’t really recall how he got there, standing in the doorway to 221B, staring but not really seeing. The police were gone now, though the mess they left behind still remained. Looking for evidence. Looking for the truth they wanted to find. They never would. That truth didn’t exist. Only the real one did.
John looked momentarily abashed, a slight pink to his cheeks. “Sorry I’ve been…busy lately.”
John didn’t know what time it was. He didn’t know much of anything. He didn’t remember much after
Sherlock hadn’t thought much of it, Lestrade had visited him before after all, and the man was keen on keeping him in bed to prevent further injury, so it hardly seemed to far out of the ordinary. No doubt his brother had desired the DI to visit as well, since he knew he wouldn’t be welcomed himself as well as hardly wishing to make the travel for something so benign, which Sherlock barely tolerated. Better than Mycroft himself or any of his other goons.
