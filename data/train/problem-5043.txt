Dean shrugged and answered, “It doesn’t matter what
“No,” Castiel snorted and slapped Dean’s shoulder. “No ghost booty for you.” Dean pooched out his bottom lip, which Castiel promptly ignored and continued talking. “And since the tour is early you gotta promise when we get home will dress up and hand out candy to the kids.”
Dean nodded his agreement to that, knowing he would do the same exact thing for Sam if he had to. Then Cas told him about how Gabe was looking forward to meeting the true mate of his baby bro, too.
She lifted her head as the sounds of the top stairs creaking drifted into the small kitchen space. A warm, heavy hand ran over her shoulder seconds before her mate’s lips met the top of her head.
Castiel hummed before cuddling back into Dean. The last four days had been amazing. A blur of songs of seduction and heat, of sex and love. The Omega’s body ached, but he cherished the feel. Castiel felt sated, loved, and completely owned by his true mate.
Dean never thought he’d get to show Castiel his home. And it gave him a special feeling to know that they could share this home and share Castiel’s nest. “This,” Dean swung open the door, “is our land nest.”
you’re baked.” Dean snorted as Castiel seemed to be pondering this. “Why don’t you just have Meg grab it or something, pass it off to Sammy and he can bring it home. You can wear some of my sweats or something until you get your bag…”
He laved his tongue over the bite as he withdrew, making sure it wasn't bleeding before he leaned forward, stretching his neck out to bare his throat for his Omega. “Now you,” Dean whispered.
Dean hooked his arm beneath the Omega’s leg, hiking it up and making the angle that much better. The Alpha rocked forward, deeper, striking Cas’ prostate again and again causing the Omega to moan and quiver as he drove his hips upwards, rutting his rock hard cock against the Alpha’s stomach.
Castiel smiled up at his Alpha then whisper-sung the last words into his Alpha’s chest. As he looked back up, Dean’s pupils were lust blown. He was dazed, entranced from the song of his Siren. Dean rose, his eyes trained on his Omega’s lips. Castiel darted down and they clashed in the middle. The kiss was rough and passionate. All teeth and tongue, heat and fervor.
“Of course you, you dork.” Dean snorted and pressed a kiss to Castiel’s palm. The alpha shook his head as sorrow filled his eyes. “When you fell I hoped we could have become more, but the way I acted, then you left.” Castiel opened up his mouth to speak but Dean pressed his finger to his lips and continued, “Then I ran across you three weeks later and you were with Ketch. The two of you seemed close, familiar in ways I was afraid to let myself think about. Then I asked you about your feelings towards him at the morgue and you never answered. I just thought…”
While the Alpha looked over the electric chair for their clue, Gabe found the jack-o-lantern nestled in a pile of ash under the chair and retrieved their coin. When the Archangel stood back up, he knocked his head on the chair, jostling the clue loose from the helmet. Gabe cursed and rubbed the back of his head while Dean grabbed the clue that dangled from a small string. After snapping a quick picture, he read aloud;.
“Hey,” Dean greeted, smiling back and standing up before wiping his hands on his jeans. Castiel held up a water bottle of iced tea and Dean’s eyes widened in excitement as he moved around the engine to take it from him. “You’re fucking perfect, have I ever told you that?”
“Umm...” Castiel trailed off as he glanced around at what was probably once a meeting room or a doctor’s office.  He shuddered slightly at the cracked paint and mold creeping over the walls.
“It’s really coming down now.” He held out his hand to Cas. “We need to get these skates off and get out of the snow.”
Ketch snorted. “He’s got you there.” Castiel shot his partner a glare and the alpha just shrugged again. “It’s true.”
,” Castiel quoted.
“Dean,” Castiel whispered his cheeks turning a bright shade of pink, “I’m nothing special. I assure you.”
“Alright, Alright,” Sam cut in with a roll of his eyes. “Let’s save the bickering for later and go find our next clue. But,” he smirked over at his brother, “you did start all this by aggravating the hell out of Cas over his car.”
“Seriously, Dean?” Sam paused in eating his piece of eggnog pie as he stared unbelievingly at his brother.
“Show off,” Dean snorted.
He started forward as Bobby pulled up and to a stop, the other three knocking into each other as they tried to use each other to stand up. Dean turned around, laughing at the sight they all made, and by the time the four of them were in the van, they were all out of breath from laughing so hard.
“Simple,” Rowena grinned at him. “Close your eyes, clear your mind, and follow your heart.”
“Fill me so full it drips past your fat knot,” Castiel moaned breathily as his nails scratched down Dean’s chest.
“The best is Breyers Vanilla Caramel Swirl Gelato. Creamy vanilla gelato with the most delicious caramel sauce ever. Mmmmm,” Castiel purred, “its so good.”
“Good.” Doctor Shurley nodded, crossing his legs once more and sitting back against the chair. He looked over Castiel for a moment before asking, “How else are you feeling? How is your relationship with Dean going?”
“Okay,” Dean said, nodding his head, “then I’m going to kiss you now.”
“You know,” Castiel paused as he returned the smile, “it’s starting to grow on me.”
tomorrow.”
After Dean whooped their asses at
“Soon,” Castiel sighed as he looked out the windows and down at the clusters of Merfolk swimming towards the castle. “People are starting to gather.”
The Omega glanced down at his watch. A hard jolt rattled Cas and his eyes shot up to see what the he had hit. A large black muscle car. He’d slammed into another vehicle. Just what he needed this morning. How the hell had he not noticed the car?
Castiel chuckled as he laid his head on Dean’s chest. “It’s not like the pie won’t still be there in a few hours.”
“Was that a question?” Dean laughed as he passed the mug of liquid life and pills to the Omega, sitting down beside him.
“What, Gabriel,” Castiel whispered and he twisted his hands together. “Is something wrong with me? Am I sick?”
“I’ll be there!” Castiel called back with a huge smile as he watched Dean disappear around the street corner.
“From a book?” Dean asked, shaking his head. “Cas doesn’t like books, he was complaining just last week about the books he had in American Government and Chemistry going against what that Meta-dick would’ve wanted them to read. He’s still struggling with that shit, you know? Why did you suggest he found it from a book?”
Castiel huffed a small laugh at Dean’s logic, despite being anxious. He laid his head on the Alpha’s chest and focused on Dean’s heartbeat and breathing, trying to get his in time with the Alphas. After a few minutes of silence Castiel spoke. “You promise I’ll
they were going to be leaving soon.
“Wait a minute,” Dean cut in. “If she bound you to her in death doesn’t that mean you will die when she does?”
“Yeah, yeah,” Cas protested, wiping the kiss off and giving a faux grimace.
The cat chirruped a meow and batted Dean’s hand once before trotting over to the table and jumping up onto Charlie’s stomach. She made an ‘oof’ at the sudden weight on her belly, but took comfort in petting the cat as she waited for Dean to finish cooking.
The smell of distressed mate filled Dean’s nostrils and the smile from his face fell. He wrapped both arms around his Omega and nuzzled at his jaw. Castiel let out a shuddering breath and leaned into his mate. He clearly wasn’t ready to talk about whatever caused that reaction and Dean wasn’t about to push. So he placed a kiss to Castiel’s throat and held him tightly, hoping to convey that whenever his Omega was ready to talk he would be there to listen.
“I’m glad you like it, Dean.” Cas beamed as he doctored up his coffee with sugar and hazelnut creamer.
“Castiel!” Gabriel swam into his room out of breath, and following closely behind him was a sea lion pup. “Your damn pet has been in my room again chewing up my stuff!” He shot a glare at the pup. “You need to keep a better eye on that lil’ shit.”

chill.”
years ago, I guess.”
“Okay then.” Dean took a deep breath and folded his hands on the table in front of himself. “It means
“Well,” John began, “it was the first day of my senior year of high school. We’d just moved here to Lawrence and I was dreading it. No one wants to be the new kid, but even more so their senior year. But,” he reached over and took his wife’s hand, “it turned out to be one of the best days of my life.”
The Omega clutched at the sand nervously, this was the part he was dreading, telling Dean he was the reason he was here, like this, that he was the reason the Alpha almost drowned in the first place. But Castiel wouldn’t lie to him. Dean deserved to know the truth, even if it meant he would never forgive or accept Castiel as his true mate.
“Bobby, come on. Just think about it. We still have the back bedroom, we have plenty of foster experience, and you know we have more than enough around here to feed another mouth. And-”
Dean closed his eyes then, a beat of silence passing, before he answered. “Since you walked into the house for the first time.”
“Shhh, shh,” Dean soothed with a soft grin, “Of course, I heard her. Nothing is coming for you though.” He reached up and ran his fingers back through Castiel’s hair. “It’s just part of the tour, Cas. It’s Halloween, babe. They are trying to up their scare factor. It’s just that girl, Becky, from the front desk.  You are perfectly safe.” Dean pressed a kiss to Castiel’s forehead. “I will
By the time everyone was finished with dinner, Dean had managed to eat two full plates. He hadn’t noticed how much Castiel had eaten, not wanting to look at him too much and risk temptation. The Alpha hoped it had been a substantial amount because when he
going on with Dean and Cas, Luc. Dean was helping Cas and that’s it. As for this next heat, well…” Jo shrugged and picked at the grass beside her knee. “That’s Cas’ choice. He may not want Dean’s help, but if he does, I am positive Dean will be there for him. I have no idea why Cas is pissed at him though… I asked, but Cas wouldn’t answer me.”
“No way,” Dean shook his head, “it’s Aunt Jody’s favorite! It will only take me ten minutes. Its not like I live across town, I’m only two streets over, remember?”
“Cas, Cas baby, you feel so good,” Dean mouthed against his throat, rolling his hips and twisting his fist around the head of Castiel’s cock. “Come for me baby, I want to feel you come on my knot.”
“Just so you know,” Castiel started as he went through the motions of stretching again, “I ran track all four years of high school and I always placed first. And even now, no matter rain, snow, sleet, or shine, I run five miles
The Alpha reluctantly let go of his mate’s waist and slung an arm over his shoulder, still wanting some physical contact as he led Cas into the kitchen. “How do you feel about cheeseburgers?”
“I”m on it.” He smirked. “And I’ll be back to help here as soon as I’m done.” His eyes met his brother’s. “Cassie, keep them safe until I get back.”
“Welcome home!” The cheers of the three kids inside made Ellen smile and roll her eyes. Jo had both brothers in a headlock, nearly swinging off of their shoulders with a wide smile on her face. Sam and Dean were both laughing, trying to pry free of her. Ellen chuckled and turned, freezing as she saw the looks on the Omega brother’s faces.
“Fine,” Dean huffed out at the no nonsense look on Castiel’s face.
“Open wide, alpha.” Dean grinned widely at his mate. Castiel opened his mouth and Dean pressed the trigger a few times, amber liquid squirted in the alpha’s mouth.
“You’re so needy,” Dean replied with a wink, reaching back down to fish out a green water bottle. He handed it over, smiling as Castiel winked back at him.
, it’s another way of saying someone is jealous. You’re jealous,” Sam swallowed another laugh, “about Ketch!”
After one final kiss to his Omega’s hole, Dean sat back on his haunches and plunged two fingers into Cas’ soaked, pliant entrance. He watched his fingers slide in and out, watched as Cas pushed back needily, taking them as deep as he could. His entire body quivered as Dean’s fingers struck his prostate and the Alpha’s hand was quickly becoming soaked from his mate’s arousal as he added a third finger and continued to open him. Cas mewled and gripped the bed sheet, lost in the sensations of lust and pleasure.
A loud rumble reverberated from Dean’s chest as he dove back down and kissed his mate thoroughly before making his way down Cas’ body. He flicked his tongue across his mate’s right nipple before closing his lips around it and sucking hard, biting down roughly. The Omega was panting and writhing, lying in a puddle of his slick as Dean started working over the left one.
“And you were right.” Dean grunted as he pressed down on his crotch, trying to will his erection away. “As much as I would love to ravage you, now is not the time for that.” The Alpha smiled shyly at his mate. “So my cock needs to go back into its sheath.”
“I will,” Castiel chuckled as he turned to walk back to his porch, looking over his shoulder as he called out. “Have a good day at work,
“You read my mind,” Dean said as he spun Castiel. “I was just thinking the same thing.”
Then he spent eight months on Sammy’s couch, questioning his life, his very existence, until Sam came home one day and found Dean in the bathroom, Cas’ name on his lips as he bled out in the bathtub. At that point, Sam
“Of course not,” Castiel’s grin grew, “you’d never forget.”
He wasn’t sure what kind of show he was supposed to be waiting for, but he wasn’t one to disobey a direct order. It felt nice, anyway, to be sitting in the grass, close enough to be able to see what was going on, but distanced enough that people were leaving him to himself.
“He does,” Dean acknowledged as he nodded. “That’s why I’m gonna be the best damn Alpha I can for him.” He looked from Gabriel to Rowena, “And I’ll spend every single day showing him just how special he is, and how much he means to me.”
Cas laughed as he relaxed in Dean’s arms. “Happy Halloween to you, too, Alpha.”
Dean moaned as their bodies and lips crashed together. The alpha wanted this so badly, he had for a long time. Dean wanted all that Castiel was willing to give him, everything he had to offer, and he wanted to give all of himself in return.
Dean chuckled and wrapped his arm around Cas’ waist, pulling him closer. “They can’t have the recipe?”
The Omega licked his lips and looked up at him through hooded lashes. “I would much rather you eat my ass.”
“Nope,” Jo replied, popping the ‘p’. They nodded together and then started to count. “One… two… three!” Jo leaned forward at the same time Lucifer did, their entire faces smashing together. Jo reeled back, rubbing her nose and blinking back the tears that sprang to her eyes. “I don’t think that’s how it's supposed to work.” Lucifer was also rubbing his nose and shaking his head. “Okay, how about you stay still, and I’ll come to you on the count of three?”
“Alright,” Castiel nodded, “sounds like a good plan.”
Castiel and Dean chuckled as they called back in unison. “It’s safe!”
“Fuck!” Dean called out as his shoulder throbbed and his knot swelled to completion, locking them together. The Alpha let out a loud growl as he bit down on Castiel mating gland. At the first taste of copper on his tongue, Dean’s cock pulsed and twitched, pumping his first load of come into Castiel, painting the Omega’s insides with his spend.
“Please, sit.” The Alpha turned to face his mate, gazing at him attentively. “You're my guest. I got this.”
“It’s called,” the alpha leaned on the counter, closing the gap between him and Castiel, “a Kiss on the Lips.” His eyes flickered to the omega’s lips before straightening back up. “If you want another, or you just wanna chat, you know where I’ll be.” He turned and walked a few steps before stopping and looking over his shoulder back at Castiel. “Name’s Grayson. Hope to see you soon.” And with that, he was gone.
“Exit’s this way, Cas.” Dean panted as he squeezed his Omega’s hand reassuringly as they continued to run. “We are getting the fuck out of here!”
much more.” Cas quirked a playful yet challenging brow. “I believe you said something about fucking me so full it leaked out of me and then doing it over and over until the sun comes up.”
Castiel let the shirt drop from his hands back to the floor as he twisted back onto his back and stared up at the ceiling. He missed sitting under the old willow tree with him, missed those green eyes and wide smile, his laugh. He missed the way it felt when he passed Castiel bowls or plates at the dinner table, the way he’d let his fingers linger over Castiel’s, the way it made his heart beat faster just from that little point of contact. The Omega gasped when he felt a pulse of slick gush from him. His eyes fell to between his legs where his flesh was hard and wanton.
He flicked a tongue over Castiel’s left nipple, the Omega gasping, fingernails digging into Dean’s shoulder blades. Then, suddenly, they were flipped, Castiel’s eyes beautiful and lust blown as they looked down at Dean.
him! His eyes got all wide and he was yelling about how he shot it, he ‘shot the ghost’.”
The afternoon passed with laughter, good conversation in good company, and away from all the creepy crawlies for a change. But, as the sun started to set, it was time to call it a day.
“I sang for Dean and he followed my voice, followed it out into the deep of the sea. Before he went under the wind changed its course and I caught his scent. In that moment I knew,” Castiel whispered as he twisted the chocolate chip muffin in his hands. “I dove in after him and when I found him I knew I couldn’t get him to the surface in time. So I did the only thing I knew to save him.” He dauntlessly met his aunt’s eyes. “And I don’t regret it, I’d gladly do it again.”
“We are doing our best, El.” He wrapped his arms around her and gave his mate a comforting squeeze. “We just need to be there for him… for them both. We need to help Luc understand Cas and Dean are doing nothin’ wrong. We need to help him accept them.”
, Cas. I’ll be on your floor, unable to move, exhausted and falling apart, my stomach eating itself from the inside out and-”
The spirit gave them a sad smile. “She fell in love with me.”
“Jesus Christ!” Castiel gasped as he jumped and the stool wobbled dangerously. Dean jumped forward, dropping the bucket and making the tools scatter across the floor again in favor of reaching up and catching the Omega. He pressed a hand to the small of Castiel’s back and his thigh, helping him to balance. Castiel’s breathing was ragged as he pressed a hand to his chest. “Hello, Dean,” he let out a shaky laugh as he looked down and met the Alpha’s eyes, “you scared the hell out of me.”
“Alright, it was a dark and stormy night. Just kidding,” Gabriel cleared his throat and started over. “It was a bright and sunny day at KU and I was so stoked because I was showing my baby bro around the campus. I still couldn’t believe he decided to join me at KU. I just knew we were going to have all kinds of fun! The Novak bro’s, together again. But as we were walking through the quad, Cassie just stopped.”
Sam had slipped off of the bed and was perusing through his bookcase, pulling a thin paperback book out and tossing it onto his desk. “I think we’re going to have to do a little more research on this… and I think you’re going to have to check with Bobby, we might need a permit to house bees…”
Gabe snapped his fingers, his hands instantly holding a thick packet of papers. “Ask and ye shall receive Sama-lama-ding-dong.”
“Doesn’t hurt?” Dean whispered as he massaged the antibacterial cream into the Omega’s skin. His fingers trailed over the last scrape, with a final swipe of the medicine.
“Nice to meet you, Dean.” Lucifer released his hold and wiped his hand on his pants. “If you’ll excuse me I need to speak with Becky before starting the tour.” He gave Castiel one last lusty look before turning and walking over to the Beta who was helping the last two of the group sign in.
The Omega nodded in agreement and leaned back taking in the scenery as Dean drove to their next destination.
“Good,” the alpha growled, “because I don’t want rubber between us when I claim you. I want to feel you, I want you to feel me.” Dean leaned in and whispered into the omega’s ear, “Want you to feel me as I fill you full of cum.”
Monday took the goddamn cake. He kicked his boots off on the porch, then let himself inside to shower and change into basketball shorts and a tee shirt. There was no way in hell he was cooking, so he ordered a pizza and took a bottle of beer with him back out onto the porch.
“Oh yeah.” Dean smirked up at him. “I walked funny for a week after that lil trip.”
“Yes, yes, you are.” Dean reached up and wound his arms around his Omega’s shoulders pulling him down and claiming his lips. The slow and languid kiss quickly turned hot and heated. “Fuck,” Dean groaned as he scented their mixed arousal.
“Definitely,” Castiel agreed as he downed the rest of his beer. “He and I are a package deal.”
The Omega rolled over and pushed up onto his hands and knees, arching his back and presenting to the Alpha, giving him a perfect view of his ass. Dean groaned again and gripped the swell of the Omega’s ass cheeks, spreading them open again. He licked his lower lip as he watched the Omega’s hole quiver and drip slick. He dove forward and started eating Cas out with fervor. Dean was driving the Omega wild as he keened and rutted back against the Alpha’s face. He gripped Cas’ hips, stilling him. “Don’t move, sweet lil’ Omega.”
Ellen smiled and nodded her head, reaching across the table for Cas’ hand. “You don’t have to make a decision yet, okay? We will go in and see what they have to say, and then you can decide from there.”
“The shifter gene is a recessive gene. So it depends on the lineage of your family and chance, essentially. There’s a possibility, of course.” He looked at Dean and knew his scent gave off a hint of nervousness as he asked, “Are you okay with that?”
Dean smiled and nodded. “Thanks, Ellen. I’m just going to make Cas some sandwiches so he can eat when he’s out of the shower.”
He was stretching.
I (Dani) am moving across the country and going be neighbors with Cas!!! It's a huge move, she's finishing up school with the kiddos, so we're just both insanely busy over the next month.
Ellen sighed, rolling her shoulders as she sat back against the headboard, wiggling into the pillow before looking over at Bobby. “John taught that boy a killer right hook…” Bobby chuckled and Ellen hit his arm. “It’s not funny! He could’ve seriously hurt Luc. Hell, if Luc had tried to fight back…”
“Dean?”
“Let’s get you some punch then. And no, you can’t spike it,” he added, grabbing Dean’s arm and giving him a tug. “Andrea’s over at the end.”
, and when you're down here with me,
“Like? No, no, no,” the Alpha shook his head. “I fuckin’ love it!” Dean went to fork another bite and frowned when he realized it was all gone.
I give you,
As soon as Castiel’s final article of clothing joined the others, Dean tackled him onto the bed with a deep, rumbling growl. A low whine spilled from the omega as mahogany and leather assaulted his senses, surrounding him. Castiel wiggled free from his mate's hold and pinned him with a sharp stare. Dean pushed up onto his knees as he kept eye contact with his omega.
“Jealous assholes more like it,” Mary teased as she walked back into the dining room carrying the large throw blanket that usually rested over the back of the couch. She walked over to Dean and Castiel, unfolding it and wrapping it around them to cover them adequately until they could separate.
“Tease,” Dean growled as he reached behind his mate and gripped the base of his cock, pushing the head against Castiel’s dripping rim, catching on the tight ring of muscle. The Omega pushed back, the head popping in. He let out a soft gasp as he slowly sank down until Dean’s turgid length was fully sheathed inside him. Castiel indulged in the girth of his mate, the fullness he felt, and the warmth of his Alpha’s body, rivaled only by the heat of the fire licking their skin.
“I’ll see you at lunch?” Dean asked as they stopped by his locker, Cas bending down to swap his own books out -- Dean’s locker was closer, and it was easier to share notes anyways, sharing a locker.
A small smile spread across Dean’s lips and Cas continued, “I also have a few Cokes, a bag of doritos, and chocolate chip cookies. So…” he trailed off and bumped his hip against Dean’s.
Mary had been more of a mother to him this past year than his own had ever been. He smiled as he remembered the weekend she spent teaching him how to make pie; it was Dean’s favorite dessert and he was determined to learn it. Mary had been delighted to teach him and even happier he’d asked her. She’d been so patient with him, teaching him the homemade crust and sweet fruit filling. Mary had wiped away the flour that stained his cheeks while laughing and telling him stories from Dean’s childhood. She’d been proud of him when he pulled a perfect cherry pie out of the oven. It was a true sense of pride, something he only
“Wasn’t sleeping,” Castiel murmured drearily, nuzzling against Dean’s chest. “I was just resting my eyes.”
A loud pounding on the wall, followed by Sam’s voice, “Hell, no, you are not just getting started! We need sleep, Dean!”
“Yes!” The Omega mewled as he pushed back meeting his Alpha’s brutal thrusts, loving the tug of his mate’s knot on his rim.
to sing to Dean before last night?”
Dean smirked at Cas as he slipped off his Omega’s shoes and shimmed his pants and boxer briefs off, baring his mate to his hungry gaze. The Alpha then quickly rid himself of the rest of his clothing. “Hands and knees, my Omega,
,” Sam informed as he packed up his laptop.
Jo rolled her eyes fondly before turning back to look at Lucifer. “In a little bit, Bobby will start setting off the big fireworks. If the sparkler made you jump, well, these ones will, too. They’re loud but they’re awesome! He doesn’t think we know it, but he basically spends all winter planning out the perfect show and making them in the basement.” Jo grinned and took the burnt out sparkler from Lucifer’s hands, shoving the hot end into the dirt between them. “For real, you’re gonna be hooked.”
The way Castiel looked up at him combined with the gravelly voice of the Omega, had a chill working its way up Dean’s spine. “Hey, Cas.” Dean smiled and slid in the booth across from his date. “Gotta say, Gabe actually came through with the romantic decor.” The Alpha leaned in and sniffed the flowers, smiling at Castiel. “I’ve always loved the sweet scent of roses, but they don’t hold a candle to your delicious rich aroma of lilies and jasmine.”
“But I like my car,” Cas whined as they made it to the caution tape.
Dean nodded, knowing it wasn’t really a question, and took the out for what it was. He watched Ellen turn towards the fridge, already starting to sing as she pulled out sandwich ingredients. Dean smiled at her back, grateful, not for the first time, that their dad had brought him and Sam here. He turned and went in search of his brother.
“As in Satan.” Castiel blurted out before his brain to mouth filter had time to stop him.
your true mate.”
It was so hard for an Omega to a decent job with good pay and benefits, but after months of searching he’d found
, especially on their tails, way better than beds or covers ever could.
He had no idea what just happened. Part of him realized he probably shouldn’t have laughed at the Omega, and he probably shouldn’t have brought up the ‘cult’ thing or told him he wasn’t normal… Dean winced as he reached down and picked up the crown from the dirt. Ellen was going to kill him… he basically did everything she had warned them
“Gabe!” Cas hissed, “Show a little decorum. Please!”
“After you broke my heart, after you called me an Omega bitch and told me to bend over.” Cas’ voice rose with every word he spoke. “I still wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt. You were my true mate, Dean. I loved you and you couldn’t stand up to a few dumb jocks for me. But yet,” Cas huffed a self deprecating laugh. “I still waited there by your car for you for hours.”
Once dressed he debated on making the bed but deciding against it, knowing them they would be messing up the sheets and crumpling the comforter all over again in a few hours. With those lusty thoughts swirling around in his brain he wandered out of the bedroom and downstairs in search of his wayward mate.
“Yes,” Castiel hummed as he arched into his mate’s touch. “That is
That being said, watching Ketch touch his omega was starting to make his fucking blood boil.
“Fuck it.” The alpha blew out another deep breath. “You want to discuss it now? We damn well will discuss it now.” Dean shrugged. “Why wait until the case is finished, now is just as good a time as any. I was worried not even ten minutes ago that I might never get to tell you how I feel. What do I have to lose, nothing, but I have so much I could gain.”
“Okay then,” Dean crossed his arms over his chest. “How’s it work?”
Dean would smile and lean up against the tree to watch. He’d watch the rhythmic movement of his mate gliding across the ice, captivated as the skater did impressive jumps and spins. The way his Omega would dance and drift across the frozen pond was downright seductive and Dean had came to the conclusion his mate was pure sex on ice.
”That’s because, well,” Castiel gasped when he felt sharp teeth slide across his throat, “my uh…” he trailed off as he bared his throat fully and his Alpha began to lap at it. “Heat, it’s my heat. I’m in the early stage of it.”
important. I forgive you for disrupting my beauty sleep.” A wicked smirk spread across her ruby red lips as she glided from the doorway, “Come on in and tell Auntie Rowena all about it.”
Claire pointed her fork at him with a wink, “I’ll tell you when you're older.”
Dean held Castiel tightly as they laid back and looked up. They felt Finn flop down by their flukes, the sea lion tired from swimming and playing. The full moon shimmered down, dancing across the water. Thousands of stars as far as the eye could see surrounded the orb of night, and twinkled like diamonds in the inky black sky.
“Normal!” Castiel’s voice rose, he flinched, eyes widening when he realized he had just yelled at an Alpha. “Normal,” he sighed in a lower tone, “it makes
“Pizza is very good but what about a thick, greasy cheeseburger with bacon and all the fixins’? Except mayo, because,” Castiel scrunched up his nose, “ewww.” He let out a dreamy sigh. “They make me very happy.”
“All right.” Castiel shrugged. “Not like I’m gonna be going to sleep anytime soon.” The Omega uncrossed his arms and snuggled against his mate’s chest, breathing in his comforting scent. “It felt so real,” he whispered.
Dean’s eyes trailed up, meeting Castiel’s for a moment. “I bear the mark of my true mate, Castiel. There’s no one else for me, whether he’s with me or not. I don’t… there is no moving on for me. So removing it was never an option.”
“Man, I lo- uh, lost track of time.” The sudden warmth in his chest made his stomach flip and Dean cleared his throat, leaning down to kiss Cas’ forehead and hide the pink blush on his cheeks. “We should probably head back inside. I need to shower before dinner and we should probably ask if Ellen needs help.”
“Hello Dean,” Castiel whispered as he shifted his legs to wrap around his Alpha’s hips, sitting him comfortably in the Alpha’s lap. The Omega grinned as he reached up and fixed the Santa hat that was sitting askew on Dean’s head. “Merry Christmas.”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” Sam sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Wanna head on over to Main Street? Drag race down the strip?” He nodded over to Castiel. “I’m sure he’d wave the flag.” Sam looked at his brother, “Or maybe,” he lifted a brow, “you just wanna whip out a ruler and measure em’ right here?”
“So,” Dean spoke, breaking the tranquil quiet. “What would you like to do today?”
about school either.”
Dean groaned as he stretched in bed, relishing the pleasant ache in
“So,” Claire mumbled around a chunk of crescent roll, “mated and now getting married, when should we be expecting pups? I’d love to be a big sister.”
“I felt like we were back in June, with the way he was talking… he was going on about how Castiel was sinning and shouldn’t be alone with an Alpha, how being an Omega made him unclean… he mentioned ‘Father Metatron’ a few times, even quoting different sermons.”
“That’s great news,” Castiel blew out a deep breath. “Now we know where to find the ring. Speaking of the ring,” Castiel shifted in his seat and looked over at Dean, “do we know what it looks like?”
“You said I could pick the movie, Dean.” Castiel grinned as he shook the DVD case.
“No, Castiel, I don’t. In fact… one of my foster parents is an Omega.” Gabriel leaned back and picked up a sugar cookie, taking half of it into his mouth and chewing quickly. “He’s an Omega and his mate is an Alpha. It was… it was a shock, when I first walked into their house, to be completely honest. But they’re awesome, really awesome.” Gabriel smiled again. “How’s your family?”
Dean stared at him, knowing his eyes were wide as he listened to Castiel say everything he never thought he would. “I…” Dean whispered, voice breaking, and he cleared his throat before starting again. “I didn’t hit my head on that gravestone, right?”
“Fuck,” Sam whined, “I’m never going to unsee or hear that, Dean!”
“Hah.” Dean rolled his eyes and bumped his hip into Castiel’s, “No, I’m not jealous of Meg. I’m not jealous at all… I was just… wondering…” Dean trailed off, eyes trained on the ground ahead of them as they moved around the gates and entered the cemetery. He could feel Castiel’s eyes on the side of his face and he forced himself not to meet his eyes.
“Mmmm,” Cas purred as he grabbed the items he needed and walked back over to the kitchen island. “Maybe we could enjoy a glass as we make these cookies?”
“She did?” Castiel asked in a hushed tone as he stared up at his father.
After a few minutes of following closely behind his mate, admiring how his Alpha’s strong tail rippled as he moved, the Omega sped up until he was at Dean’s side. “We’ll be at Aunt Rowena’s soon.” Castiel said as he grabbed Dean’s arm and pulled him deeper, so they wouldn’t disturb a school of yellowtail fusiliers swimming above them. “She lives in the outer limits of Atlantis, so it should be easy getting there without being seen.”
Castiel huffed softly, fingers carding through his mate’s hair as he lifted slightly, letting Dean pull his boxers and sweatpants down his hips. Dean breathed in deep, groaning as the scent of slick was released. He shifted back, freeing the Omega’s legs and dropping his clothes to the floor.
“No,” Dean growled, “That would involve more driving, and right now I just want to get you naked.” The Alpha leaned over and ran his nose along Cas’ throat, breathing in deep. “It’s taking every ounce of willpower I have not to drag you to the backseat and have my way with you right here.”
“I promise, Sir!” Dean declared with a curt nod.
Castiel blinked away the sleep from his eyes and hummed when he noticed the Alpha smiling down at him from the side of his bed. Castiel’s breathing hitched, becoming erratic. His heart was pounding in his chest, his fingers itched to reach out and touch Dean. Castiel smiled up at him, eyes trailing down the Alpha’s throat and the low-cut hem of his t-shirt. His skin would feel silky to the touch and the Omega wanted so badly to run his hands up Dean’s strong arms... He wanted to bury his nose in the crook of the Alpha’s throat and breath in his heady scent, maybe press his lips to Dean’s pulse point.
“What do you want to do now?” Dean whispered as he nipped at Castiel’s mating bite.
“You did it, partner.” Ketch grinned as he slapped Castiel on the shoulder.
“Bring protection!” Gabriel called out to Dean and Castiel’s retreating forms. “And I don’t mean condoms.”
An hour later Dean and Castiel rushed to the throne room. When they flung the door open three sets of eyes landed on them. Gabriel shook his head and mock gagged as they swam into the room. Rowena smirked at them as they darted past her to the steps leading up to the throne. Triton quirked a brow at them as he took in their disheveled appearance. There wasn’t a doubt in his mind what they had been up to.
His eyes fell on the garden of sea anemones and the bust of the Mermaid once more and he pushed off the bench and flitted towards it. He passed a group of younglings who were playing what looked to be tag and he couldn’t help but smile. Atlantis held a lot of love that was for sure. It would be a great place to raise a family.
“Yes,” Cas nodded, “you’re my
“Oh believe it, baby!” Dean laughed. “You look like albino Rudolph.”
“Santa only comes one a year,” Dean replied smoothly with a lewd wiggle of his brows.
“Yeah, well, um…”
“Sleep, baby,” Dean whispered against the top of Castiel’s head, closing his eyes. “I’ll make sure the nightmares stay away.”
Enjoy the fluffy goodness! :)
important thing; he didn’t even realize what was happening between them, what was happening to him. Yet, he couldn’t think of a better place to have this conversation.
“Hello,” Castiel greeted in a low timbre.
. I knew I should have taken Sam on that hunt instead of you.”
“Leave it on,” Castiel purred as he scratched his nails down Dean’s arm.
“Did I mention bossy,” Dean teased with a growl as he dipped his finger between Castiel’s soaked ass cheeks and rubbed his quivering hole.
“Hell yeah!” Dean winked at him as he repositioned himself between Castiel’s legs and relaxed against his mate’s chest. He let out a happy sigh and took a drink from his bottle of beer as Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean’s stomach, holding him close.
of fun with those costumes, Sheriff Woody.”
“Hello.” The gravelly voice drew Dean out of his thoughts of all things blue.
Dean blew out a sigh. “Cas, it’s just an animal. Probably a cute lil bunny foraging. Now,” Dean shifted his hips in a figure eight motion, “can we please get back to the savage fucking.”
“Feel that,” the Alpha rumbled as he scissored his mate’s hole, slick dribbling down his hand. “My knot’s swelling all for you,
Dean nodded, swinging his legs over the bed and moving to his brother’s side. “So… you’re going to help me?” he asked, feeling both relieved and a stab of disappointment.
“Yeah, well,” Sam snorted, picturing how different their life would be without Ellen or Jo in it, with having Bobby as their dad instead of John… “the
Cas side eyed him with a small smirk. “What are you grinning at.”
“Oh, you're more than considering it, you’re so gonna do it.” Dean hummed as he took a deep breath. “I can smell how much you want me.”
Castiel tried very hard not to shift in his seat, tried hard to smile and nod at the crowd as the clapping and shouts of congratulations grew louder. But he didn’t deserve this, he had failed his Rite, he had let his father, and the fellow Sirens of Atlantis down by choosing the one land Alpha there was no way he could kill. The Omega didn’t have long to wallow in self-pity before his father was raising his hand and quieting the crowd once again.
Castiel hummed and nodded. As freaked out as he was, he was very interested in what the surgical suites looked like. He would just feel much safer if they were checking them out with the entire group. The Omega took a deep breath, trying to push back all his fears of this place, and smiled back. “Maybe we could take a quick peek.” Castiel shrugged nonchalantly, “you know, since we will be passing by them anyway.”
“They did when we were younger, not as much now. On occasion, when they come for a visit, they’ll go out on the ice with me.” Cas reached over and took Dean’s hand again, wanting that point of contact with his mate. “But when we were teens we’d spend hours out on the ice at the skate rink in town, racing each other.”
“Ha, ha,” Dean commented dryly, feeling the blush creeping across his cheeks. “Come on, you’re going to be late for chem.”
Castiel shook his head sadly, “What would she think of you now? Of how you are acting? Do you think she would be proud? No.” Castiel held up his chin defiantly and met his father's stern gaze with one of his own. “She would be disappointed in how you are judging Dean before you have even gotten the chance to know him.”
Like a flick of a switch, the Omega’s smile turned to a downright dirty leer as he grabbed a throw pillow from the couch and tossed it on the rug. “Lay down, Dean.”
Dean thought about it for a moment, then shrugged. “Sure, why not?” It wasn’t like he had to drive and he honestly wasn’t ready to head home yet. “Do you need help serving the dessert?”
“Ass,” Cas muttered as he smiled at the deep crimson liquid with a thin round orange slice floating in his glass and a star anise beside it. He brought it up to his nose and took a deep breath, the scent of citrus, cloves, allspice, and cinnamon surrounded him. He sighed as he relaxed against his Alpha. “
“That's kind of you, and no, we haven’t come up with a prayer yet,” Castiel whispered as he reached for his napkin, his brow furrowed as he thought about the commune. Children were never allowed to sleep in at God’s Playground; they needed to be up at dawn, greeting God in prayer before they started their day. There were chores to be done in the early morning hours and over sleeping was a sin.
“You won’t believe us, you’ll think we’re crazy,” Gracie whispered against her Alpha’s shoulder. “I don’t even know if
“Oh, boy.” Charlie got to her feet and grabbed one of the baby bags. “You start that movie. I’ll get the bottle. Dean, does Jack need one?”
“Mm...” Sam’s eyelids slid halfway closed. “Just like that.”
"There's one coming." Gabriel pointed to a box.
"Well, get used to it. I plan on doing it for fifty years or so." Gabriel grinned at him.
"Oh, that sounds lovely. Would you like some wine?" Michael asked, amused.
"Hush, brat. He's already getting Jezebel's." Amused at his lover's enthusiasm, Gabriel hugged him.
to look at Sam. "Do you want to top first? I was thinking of you this morning, fucking into me. I tried
“Because I make you hard. Only me!”
"I read about it in a magazine that Meg brought in for Castiel." And damn if it hadn't rung true for him. People showed and needed to be shown their love in different ways. "I wanted to find a book on it."
Remy eagerly rolled over twice, then sat up and held his paw out.
“Very well.” He couldn’t help but be self-conscious of his own uninterested cock. He tried to distract himself by giving Dean a gentle squeeze.
“Get the scissors and it will be the last thing you do.” Sam rolled his eyes at the old threat.
"Mm... that's my fastidious professor." Dean winked at him, going to grab the wipes. It didn't take Dean long to clean the pair of them, then snuggling against him.
“Fuck, Samshin-” Swearing as a sharp swat landed on his ass, Gabriel moaned. “Sir, I mean Sir.” He corrected himself.
"I've never attempted homemade pizza but I would love to learn." Cas spotted a place where his rose would not be harmed and he set it there.
Victor signaled his men, and they all converged on the scene. "Freeze, FBI!"
“We can do that.” Cas grabbed Dean’s hand and they walked into the kitchen.
“And you have the dad jokes. You’re the one for me.”
Sam reached out and brushed Gabe’s hair back. “You make me happy.”
"Cas... this might shock you, but the chance to make a memory of making pie with you... that's worth art waiting." Winking at him, Dean moved to get out everything that they'd need for the pie.
"I am sorry that I bothered you with it. I really don't think that he will come around again." Gabriel tried to reassure him.
Remy eyed them, then wiggled between the humans, pushing them apart.
"You are ridiculously fucking sexy, you know that?" He kissed him, rolling his hips as they stopped in front of the desk.
“He really does. More than anyone I know...but you.”
Cas playfully swatted at Gabe’s hand. “Fuck off.”
Cas also looked interested in Dean’s answer.
“You’re fantastic.” Sam set his laptop aside. “Come on. I wanna get back in the pool.”
His lip gave a bit of a throb, but Gabriel ignored it, concentrating on kissing Sam instead. Him laughing was nearly a balm to his soul.
Castiel could only stare as Dean got to his feet and disappeared from the yard.
"Well, if you open it, it has words..." The professor told him with a teasing smile. It was for those who sought to be law students specifically, or rather, people just like Sam.
As Meg promised, Cas was eased off of his sedation shortly later. Gabe could see a difference in just minutes. His brother began twitching and shifting restlessly.
"Jack and Theo?" Dean tilted his head at him.
Emma buckled in, watching as Dean got into the Impala. "Okay. I need to get outfits for Benny and
"Nuggets, hm?" Dean smirked, bouncing him on his hip. "I suppose I can do nuggets. They're already cooking."
Sam looked down into his glass of wine. “I’m sorry.”
Anticipation made Gabriel's abs tighten before he made himself relax. Sam did, after all, have large fingers. "Gonna suck you so good, can't wait to swallow you."
Sam groaned. "I don't want to know about Dean making out!"
"Cas?" Dean rumbled, hugging him close. "'s wrong?"
"And she'll be cute after dinner too, brat." Gabriel spanked him lightly only for Athena to raise her head and give him a warning growl.
Gabriel was quiet for several minutes, kissing his hair. "Just to be clear... I haven't ever had sex that amazing. Or come without a hand on my cock... or had a third orgasm."
"Seriously, Sam." Tears sprang to his eyes, but he pressed his face into his shoulder.
“We’re going to do something a bit different. One of my mares, Jezebel, is pregnant. I think you met her on your second day.”
“I want to hear a doctor say that,” Cas insisted, squeezing Gabe’s hand.
Dean gave him a look, going to obey.
"You need a cell phone charger, at least, so I'll grab the one from the car and bring it up." Standing, Gabriel moved to kiss Castiel's hair, then Dean's. "You two behave, hm?"
"I know. I just..." Trailing off, he exhaled slowly as he relaxed in Castiel's arms. "Sorry."
Spotting Castiel entering with a wiggling ball of fur, Gabriel nearly bounced in excitement. Fuck, that was one adorable pup! He couldn't wait for Samshine to see!
They moved together, finding a delicious rhythm as they touched and kissed. Sam came first, thrusting up into his lover.
“So far it is.”
He was working for nearly two hours when a call came in on his phone. Cas's name flashed on the screen.
"You want to be spanked, Sammich? I will turn your ass nice and red for you." Kissing down Sam's throat, he found a sensitive spot and set to work leaving a hickey.
"Yeah? That's awesome, Cas." Gabriel offered him a smile, trying to be as calm as he could to soothe his brother. He knew that it wasn't easy for Castiel.
Winkling at Sam, Gabriel took a steadying breath. It was no big deal. Just the first day of the rest of their lives.
Sam grinned and met Gabe’s eyes. “I love it when you call me your Good boy.”
"You're utterly perfect, aren't you? Marry me?" The blond teased, moving to steal another kiss from Sam- and the car keys.
"Take your time- explore all you want... and I'll try and warn you before I come." Gabriel stroked his hand through Sam's hair, his amber eyes hot as he watched him.
“I rather enjoyed it.” Mostly he liked spending time with Dean.
"Uh, coffee, black, please, and a burger and fries," Dean told her after a moment.
Dean nodded, smiling a bit. "He seems to love Sammy already." Not that he blamed the vet- his kid brother was a man that he was proud of.
"Perfect- I'll make Cassie and Dean-o get one too. We can all wear one." Gabriel pressed a kiss to Sam's chin, grinning. He still couldn't believe that he'd said yes.
"It's just the truth, Samshine." And if Sam thought that was something, just wait until he got treated how he should have been all along. He was going to take care of him, and he was going to love him how Sam deserved to be loved.
He tossed Castiel some sweats and pulled on his own.
“Mm… Nah. I’d rather taste you.” A smirk slipped over his lips, as he rumbled the words.
Sam yawned deeply and grumbled in his sleep.
"That's the exact point, Brett." Dean pistol-whipped the bastard, sending him flying to the floor.
“Your… you have tattoos? Let me see!” Sam’s eyes widened, and he looked the shorter man over. He couldn’t see any at the moment, and it only made his curiosity worse.
A sharp cry escaped Cas as Dean’s big cock stretched him. “Fuck, that’s perfect...”
"Going to my room and getting blackout fucking drunk, if you don't mind." Clearly, the elder Novak didn't really care if he did mind, shoving his keys into his pocket as he headed for the door.
Sam grinned and waited patiently, and soon Gabe was back with their dinner and drinks. “Mm...smells delicious.”
Cas slipped his arm around Dean. “Would you rather go shopping with our brothers?”
Cas nodded against Dean’s shoulder. “Y-yeah...”
“Because almost all houses have bathrooms.” Cas coaxed Jack inside and showed him the closest bathroom.
Jack grinned, looking at Theo, who was now dressed in clothing that fit him properly. "Thanks, Dad."
Dean took a deep breath, the grabbed the chart, only to feel his breath catch at it. He could have died.
"I know, love. That's what I wanted to give to you today because I know at college, you're not going to be able to get that as often as you need it." Gabriel cupped Sam's face, tracing his finger along his lower lip. "I am absolutely loving everything we've done together." Even the aftercare of their nightmares.
"I'm just saying, I'm a size two carats for Christmas." She winked, looking the ring over. "Seriously, they match your big hands."
Sam was right behind them, ready for anything. He hated that they had to do this but it was better safe than sorry.
Gabriel winked at him, squeezing his hand. "I can't wait to see their reactions." He bounced a little on the way to the door. His day couldn't get better- Sam loved him!
Dean frowned, grabbing his phone and shooting a text to Crowley about Rowena. How had she known where Garth was shot?
"Sammy, pull up the weather," Dean ordered without a thought, moving through the house. "I'm getting Charlie and Dorothy."
“We also met a tiny blind kitten named Celia. She and Duke are bonded, and Rosie loves Duke. So now we have a dog and two cats.”
Sam peered over and his deep blue eyes widened. “De?” He whispered.
As Gabriel worked, Sam barely made a sound but tears silently spilled down his cheeks.
"Castiel? Who is coming to Christmas?" Bobby raised a brow at Dean, whose ears he could see turning red.
"You want some, love?" Taking the spoon, he carefully fed him a little bit of ice after Castiel blinked at him again.
"I would very much enjoy that." Cas scooted closer to Dean and ran his fingers teasingly over Dean's cock.
Pleased, Jack returned his attention to his cake.
His cheeks flushed. “He mentioned once or twice that the idea of marrying Cas didn’t freak him out. Not like he thought it would.”
Dean glanced at him, "How are you feeling, gorgeous?" It took him a few seconds to find another pair of pants.
“That’s fantastic!” Cas quickly wrote Dean a check for $800, knowing that was far more than what the belt cost.
"Good boy." He reached out, patting Dean before he set down the water. "I think I need a bigger couch. Where do I fit into the snuggle pile?"
The call ended and Cas clung to Dean. “Wha...what...”
Sam kissed Gabe sweetly. “It was a brilliant idea, baby.”
Gabriel smiled, taking Sam's hand and bringing it to the buttons on his shirt. "If you want to touch me, do it, all right? Sexually or not, I'm all right with it. I'll tell you if it's a problem."
Relief filled him and Cas gave a certain blink.
“Thanks!”
"Socks... probably boots, but they don't sell those here."Dean shrugged, then looked at Castiel.
Nodding, Dean sat down next to them. "She's only three pounds something."
"I'm not letting you or your friend pay, Dean," Garth told him firmly, shaking his head. "You're-"
In the agony of death, there was this one thing, then.
The brothers do not look. Do not falter. They know I am here, in the stalks of the grass that brushes their knees, in the golden light that bathes this world, in the breeze that will carry their breaths and words, and joy and sorrow.
In this place in between places, in between times, he waits, his face upturned, drinking in a yellow sun, savouring the light that gilds his raven hair and fair skin like a halo. He waits with his wings outstretched, fanned about him, and it is almost impossible to deny the stories my mother told me. Stories of Castiel, the Angel of Thursday, the Angel made of Light.
And they would not be the Winchesters if they didn't fix that which needed it.
There is a moment there, in between their first spotting me here, and the recognition dawning on their faces, that an eternity could be folded into.
Endings are hard, yes, but they're also….inevitable. They're hard because they have to be lived, not because they have to be written. Orchestrated. Dictated.
Dean...is different. He is fiercely loyal to the world, but that was never the thing that made it all worth it for him. He is a simpler man, in a way, because all he has ever needed was love. From his brother, his mother. From Castiel.
I am gone, and I am here.
This time I am startled when I see them. It has been a long time, I realize, since I was here last.
As pieces of him crumbled, he thought of the world he was leaving behind. A world he had so sought to protect that he had killed his own brethren in its name. A world he had now plunged into unspeakable darkness, something he couldn't even help fight, all because….
Dean is reluctant, just as he had been before (not everything changes, even after everything changes), but he has a ring around his neck, a walkman in his pocket, and a brother by his side, -hope shining in his eyes -, and he is not so cynical to think this worthless.
So, it is not by choice that I am here, reliving my father's death for eternity. (He wasn't truly my father, perhaps, but he is the only father I have known). It is not by choice that I must be reminded of the sacrifice he made for me- that I witness one heartbreak after another in this dingy, underground concrete room.
M. W.
It was a flower blooming in a wasteland, this hope that rose within him, promises of an impossible future colouring his vision, lending him strength to keep going.
But this is an ending, and so I persevere. I squeeze their palms with mine, and then will myself away, taking them with me.
I don't disagree with him, not really. But I don't think I agree with him either.
He was beginning to feel unmoored. Lost. He had no one he could turn to. No one to right his wrongs, to set him back on a path he'd strayed so far from that he could hardly recognise the world around him.
An angel, driven — to war, to sin, to madness, and now, to
It is Dean who reaches me first, his arms pulling me into an embrace that feels like home. Like coming back here after all this time. Like hearing my mother's voice the first time.
And yet....that breaking weighed on him. It tore a hole into a world already unraveling at its seams. He felt himself cracking under the weight of the thing that had lodged itself behind his ribs.
Sam finds solace in the world that never stopped needing them, even after their story was over. He works, reading spells and brewing potions, drawing book after book from shelves to find the thing that would keep this demon - that god, this monster - at bay.
"Soon, baby." Deciding that was enough, Gabriel let the soap rinse from his hands before he reached up to kiss Sam. He nipped at his mouth, trying to press closer. Fucking height difference…
"...Son of a bitch, that's a big dog." Dean stared at the black giant, his eyes widening.
“Yes, he is.” Cas bounced the boy lightly.
“Mm-hmm.”
"Shh... you deserve the world. I'll give it to you if you let me." He kissed Sam's lashes, rubbing his back.
Sam touched the glass, his smile fading. "Monday. So in three days."
Carrying his daughter up to her crib, Gabriel sang softly to her. "Sweet dreams are made of these- sugar and sweets and loving things..." He quickly changed her diaper, then put on her footie jammies. "We'll travel the world when Dean sings, Winchesters, looking for adventure..."
The firefighter cried out, lifting his hips to try and help. His eyes were wide, and fuck, he was panting as he watched Castiel. He seemed determined to just take him apart.
The older man had to stifle a laugh. “Unfortunately he has done that to me before as well.”
"Of course he is." Not that he could blame him. Amused, Gabriel nuzzled Sam's shoulder.  "Dinner will be done soon."
"I know this will be hard, but I want Cas to be resting. If Dean's awake, he can come see her. Once Cas has slept a little, we can bring him down."
"You really are." Sam slipped his hand into Gabe's hair. "You always will be."
Tired but filled with deep relief and contentment, Cas followed him down into the bed.
“I can show you.” Sam stood up and lazily sauntered over to Gabe. Then he dropped to his knees and gripped Gabe’s thighs.
"Jesus." Dean moved, pulling his younger brother into his arms. "I'm here, Sammy. It's okay. I'm right here." No wonder his payments had stopped. Dean hadn't had any paperwork to prove who he was, so he'd had to give up.
Sam managed to free his aching dick. “You choose, sir. Wanna make you happy.”
"Well, we will have to talk later." Gabriel shot him a grin.
"Not possible, Sammich." Not at all. Gabriel was entirely positive about it. He smirked, letting his lashes drift shut.
"Clearly, we need to spoil them more." He laughed as Remy ran around, excitedly. "Apparently Remy thinks so too."
"You all right, gorgeous?" Gabriel looked over at him, reaching out to touch his shoulder.
"Shh... you want to come now? I can make my good boy come now, but we'll have to go to our room first." Gabriel kissed him, nipping at his mouth.
"Love, you're going to get glued to me." Gabriel laughed softly, kissing his hair.
"Just fine, Samshine, I promise. I might be a little bruised. Charlie sent Gilda out for the calf." Leaning up, Gabriel kissed Sam softly.
Hugging him, Gabriel rubbed Sam's back. "Just tell me if you want me to quit and I will. Deal?"
For most of his life, he had been in and out of hospitals. Some of his earliest memories involved the sterile white walls and the overwhelming scent of antiseptic soaps. He couldn’t remember a point of his life when he had actually been healthy. Now he was twenty-three, and instead of graduation and planning a family, he was wishing for his stupid faulty heart to just stop beating.
"Like this?" Adjusting just a little, Dean gently stroked his fingers through Castiel's hair. "Love you, Cas."
“I’d like that...” With little urging, Gabe helped Sam move the rest of his things into their bedroom. Then they headed into the bathroom.
"Oh fuck, Sam... that's so damn good. That's..." Gabriel made a soft noise, groaning at the feel of his throat around him.
Sam gave Gabe a squeeze. “Can I work out with you?”
"Definitely good. I don't have a shovel for a bear-sized shit." Dean laughed a little, shaking his head with amusement.
“No, I already fed her. I think she’s just lonely.” He gave her swing another little nudge.
"Tired, Cas?"  Pulling him close, Dean nuzzled against him. He loved that he was covered in the scent of his mate, and his mate had his own scent in many places.
"I've wanted to go there forever. I always had more of a thing for Norse mythology." Gabriel reached up, lightly running his nails over Sam's scalp.
"You look so good, Cas. You're just..." He moved, grabbing a small hand mirror from the end table before holding it up for Castiel to look at.
Cas didn’t respond and Sam squeezed Bobby’s arm. “He didn’t recognize me or Gabe at first. But Dean...Dean is the only one who has kept him calm.”
Cas laughed softly, rubbing his long fingers through Dean’s hair. “I love you?”
“I want him. I just.., what happens when I fall, and he decides he no longer wants me?”
The new angle had Gabriel's erection pressing into Sam's, and he groaned, concentrating on his fingers on Sam's cock. He nipped at Sam's mouth, kissing him deeply.
"Come on. Inside and up to our bed." Moving to blow out the candles, he moved to clean up after their dinner.
“Good, because I need them all. I’m a greedy asshole like that.”
Sam gave Gabe a little kiss. “We’re being discharged in a few hours,” he told their brothers. “Izzy is perfectly healthy and ready to go home with us.”
Cas nodded tiredly. “Sounds perfect.”
"Oh, shit, that's right." Dean looked at Castiel. "Are you okay with that?"
Checking through the window, Dean let Castiel in, trying not to stare. Nope. Not that kinda relationship, Idjit. Great, now he was hearing Bobby. "Hey, Cas."
Sam buried his face in Gabe's chest. "Just tell me I never have to leave..."
"Oh, so that's not a deal breaker?" Gabriel smirked at him, carefully standing next to the hammock.
"Cas... Gabriel failed," Dean said after a long moment, waiting for him to stiffen a little before he grinned, "This is a hell of a lot more comfortable than theater seats."
"Hi, Dada." She sucked on her fingers, looking up at Sam.
The older man nodded frantically, thrusting his hips a little. “Yes!”
Gabriel traced his fingers over the nape of Sam's neck. "We'll bring dinner in later for everyone."
“Yeah. ‘m still tired.”
"Hannah..." he moved, gently touching her shoulder. "It's okay, whatever it is. You can talk to me."
Sam stretched his lithe body and took off his hat. “I wanna get cleaned up, have dinner, and snuggle with my hot veterinarian fiance.”
Sam looked at Gabe fondly. “He has a surprise for me before I leave tomorrow.”
"If you are sure." Gabriel paused, laying his hand on Sam's thigh. "I should apologize for... we hadn't agreed on spanking as a punishment."
“Just let me show you the supply room and hose. And gloves. You don’t have any allergies, do you?”
sing along with the song.
Cas gently pushed Emma forward. “This is my daughter, Emma. And she needs everything.”
Dean skidded to a stop inside the bathroom, laughing. He couldn't remember the last time that he'd smiled this much.
Sam easily caught the key chain and laughed. “A dick?”
“I understand you wanna protect them, baby. But I should meet both of them. I would also like to see Gabriel’s bedroom.”
Jude slept through the car ride home, much to Castiel's amusement. She only began to stir as Dean pulled into the driveway.
Cas’s hand tightened on Dean’s. It had not escaped anyone’s notice that Dean was the only person Cas reacted well to. He still showed no signs of recognizing his brother, or Sam. And any time Dean had to leave the room, even if it was just to use the bathroom, Cas nearly melted down.
Emma bit her lip as she stood from the bed, looking at Castiel. After a moment, she hugged him close. "Thank you for trying to help me get to bed."
“I asked if you were okay.” He kissed Gabe’s temple.
"Well... I can't complain about that. Sam's the smartest person that I know." Biting his lower lip, Dean smiled after a moment, slowly pulling the full lip free. Hell, he'd given him shit about it on homework when he'd known Sam was just getting it done versus putting in his A game.
Gabriel bit his lower lip, determined not to moan. "Gonna have to keep you if you around, Samshine," He told him quietly.
Smirking a little, Cas watched him go before he went to the kitchen for a glass of water. He had to hydrate, after all, for what was about to come.
"I can do that. It's been a while since I saw Cas." Since she was sure that they weren't going to let her say no.
“Of course. We’ll take care of Zep until then.”
"Audentes Fortuna iuvat, Castiel." Sipping his coffee, Dean shot him a sure smirk, the Latin proverb rolling easily off of his tongue. Fortune favors the bold- one of the few things he’d liked when helping Sammy study the language.
Dean kissed his hair with a smile, "Look! And this is where you can tell that Dr. Sexy is entirely in love with... well, that's spoilers."
"Dean, I'm far from straight."
“Please, Sir…” Dean bit his lower lip as he felt Castiel’s cock at his entrance. “I need it, I’m yours… need your cock, only yours.” He cried out as Castiel pushed inside, slow, steady, deep- and then out.
"I know, kiddo, but it's gonna be all right." Dean patted his back, hoping to reassure him. "Honestly, he's hard-headed."
Smiling as he pictured their little family, Gabriel resolved to call his brother tomorrow. "I'm glad.
Moaning into his mouth, Gabriel straddled Sam's hips their tongues slid together, and the blond rolled his hips to tease them both, his hands clinging to Sam's shoulders.
“You said… I could open you up...” The taller man’s voice dropped, and he pulled him closer.
"I know, Sammy. So he walked in on Cas and me earlier," Dean told his brother, intending to lighten the mood. "We have it on video."
Take care of him? Clearly, she knew about Remy's self-appointed job. Shaking his head, Dean smiled at the redhead in spite of himself. "Sweet dreams, Charlie."
Sam’s eyes darkened as he closed a large hand around Gabe. “That’s better.”
Sighing, Cas turned to Emma. “Are you okay, sweetheart...?”
Laughing softly, Dean stroked his thumb along Castiel's lower lip. "Mm... that's because you felt so good. And you'd been teasing me with your fingers for ages ahead because you wanted it to be perfect."
“You’re meeting me at the clinic. I’ll show you how we take the dogs out, feed everyone, change litter boxes, and hose down messes.”
Nodding, Dean reached out to pull the shorter blond into a hug. "I'm sorry, Gabe. I know he's your brother. It's just..."
"I am thankful that you had them. Gabriel did an amazing job with you." After all, their brother had stepped up where they had not. "Dean, what do you do for a living?"
"I love you too. Let's go get you cleaned up, baby." He kissed his hip, tugging him up to cuddle him. "Come on, let's go get snuggled into bed. I'll take care of your ass and clean us up."
exactly he'd done it, but he kicked the knife across the room into a dark corner. "You can go to hell!"
That made Sam snort. "Why would I? Even if I didn't have the most gorgeous, sweetest, kindest man ever, Alex is a kid."
"We're the same blood type. I can help him." Gabriel reached over, squeezing Sam's shoulder.
“No.” Sam was clinging to his hand. “I thought you were dead.”
“Perfect for you.” Cas leaned into Dean. “I’m proud of you.”
He nodded hurriedly and knelt down on the floor with Gabe. “Can I touch you?”
Sam’s cheeks heated and he gently touched Gabe’s face. “Please touch me, Gabe,” He rumbled.
He pulled out his checkbook, fully intending to write it the half million over the fees for the dogs.
“You’re a good man,” he insisted, gently touching Dean’s arm. “And those burgers are going to be incredible.”
Once they reached Gabe’s home and were inside, Sam went into the kitchen, looking to whip up something simple for Gabe to eat.
“I’m definitely hungry,” Sam murmured, but there was sadness in his voice.
“I’ll keep you updated and text you when I have a flight for us both,” Sam said a quick goodbye, and soon he was on a red-eye flight to Nashville.
The older man just laughed as Chopin and lucky came barreling downstairs. He scratched Remy’s
“Yes, Sir.” Sam kissed Gabe’s neck before he began exploring the sheets available to them.
"I told Ben that we'd be bidding on you at the auction," Lisa told Dean, reaching out to touch Dean's arm.
"We can do that, love. Now... I want you to go get in the shower. I will leave clothing out for you on our bed. Put that on and meet me downstairs. I will be showering in the guest bathroom." Curious to
Sam sat down beside him, gently running his fingertips over Gabe’s arm. “You’re doing great.”
“Babe, I don’t need any of that. I’m not working, I’m just taking classes. I can clean.”
"Mm..." Looking at Castiel, Dean gently smoothed his hair back. God, he hoped that he still- what, loved him? It'd been forever. So many years...
Sighing, Sam pressed his head to the door. “Poughkeepsie.”
Sam pulled out his phone and took a picture of her. “We have to meet the other dogs, but we’ll be back,” he told her with a grin.
"I love you too." He cupped his face, kissing him softly. "Let's sleep, love."
“Gabriel. You look amazing.” The other man smiled coolly at Gabriel.
"This, Cas?" Dean tugged on his dark hair, forcing Castiel's head back so that he could nip and suck at his throat. He wanted to mark him but told himself to behave.
He moved, sitting down so that Elias could get a better vantage point. "See? She was born when Alex and Benny were born."
“I don’t deserve you,” he repeated, but he stood up and waited for Dean.
Gabriel grinned, "That's it! I see hair, Sammy. Let's go!"
The movement woke Sam, who blearily searched for Gabe. “Baby?” he slurred. “What’s going on?”
“I’d like to wrap my lips around you.” He looked torn and he nearly pouted. “I want both.”
“If you do, I might embarrass myself,” he managed.
Meg was there almost immediately. “Hey, boys. Everything okay?”
“I suppose so.” Sam instinctively brushed Gabe’s hair back.
Dean was nearly bouncing as he headed out to the koi pond area with Castiel. "So, Sammy'll be home soon. A few days. I can't fucking wait."
Cas fixed his own sandwich, adding plenty of peppers and mushrooms. "Did you sleep well last night?"
Swearing softly, Gabriel growled the word as he moved with his mate, his knot starting to thicken at the base of his cock.
Panting in the younger man's arms, Gabriel pressed a kiss to his jaw. "Gonna keep you, Samshine."
It took a moment for Cas to process it, but when he did his eyes filled with tears. “Gabe...”
"Her name's Issy?" She set down her fork, watching the baby with big eyes. A glance said that Theo was happily eating with Jack, and Ben was happily eating with Gabriel, who was playing with him.
"Be with me how, Cas?" Dean had to make sure that they were on the same page.
"Mm..." Mixing the beef with the spices, Dean looked over at Castiel. "Babe? What do you think about penetration? Do you want that? Or…" Hell, he knew he was the first guy he'd been with- what if the rancher didn't want that?
