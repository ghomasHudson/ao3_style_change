“Well, Rogers. You wanna suit up and take this outside? Like old times, huh? Don’t have Bucky this time though, so, might have to postpone it.”
“Aww, don´t tell me your womanizer best friend wasn´t banging some girl in an alleyway while you were watching out for other people.”
He could feel Tony´s dick inside of him pulsing. He pulled the billionaire into a hug and kissed him deeply.
“When did you start your transition?” the billionaire asked. Somehow Steve managed to look at him again without tears in his eyes.
And against the flood of questions that filled the room he said, “I, Steven Grant Rogers, am a trans-man. And I wish for every single trans-person in the world that they find a way to be themselves, just like I did.”
“Don´t be. I guess it wasn´t easy back then in 1940 and it´s not easy to be out now.” He kissed Steve´s cheek and smiled. “Do you still want to loose your virginity tonight?”
Anxiously biting his lower lip the soldier tried to calm himself. He would tell Tony when the billionaire picked him up. If Tony had a problem with it he could politely get out of the situation. If he didn´t mind they could still go on a date. Tony wouldn´t use this information against him, right? They were friends. Of course Tony wouldn´t tell anybody.
Tony had told no one, not even SHIELD, about the microchips he had implanted his fellow Avengers. He managed to do that unnoticed except for Natasha. Tony didn´t know why exactly the thought of being able to check on them whenever he wanted calmed his mind so much. He didn´t dare to question it either, partially because he feared he would expose himself as a crazy stalker.
“Tony.” Steve now looked directly at him, no way to escape his eyes. “You show up wearing a collar, being high on whatever drugs are popular these days, smelling like you just stumbled out of a really cheap brothel. I think I deserve an explanation.”
He picked up speed a little bit, jerking Tony off while sucking him, the room growing damp with the sex that was currently happening.
"But none of that stopped you from falling in love with him, Tony."‌ Pepper whispered, taking in his hunched over, quivering form.
And he was silenced as Steve melded their forms together, grinding his hips up to throw Tony off, trying to gain some distance.
Pulling out his fingers gently, Steve laid over the other man, kissing along his jaw, through his goatee and across his cheeks.
Steve felt his face close up, lower lip trembling as he bum rushed the man, folding him so tightly into his arms, he thought he’d choke him.
“I lied to him, for years about his parents, simply because I didn’t want-” Steve stopped talking, licking his lips, feeling his throat well up with emotion.
“You think that you’re alone in how you feel?” Tony snapped out, lower lip trembling with the effort to hold himself together.
“I’m not doing this, Steve. You should get some water and go to bed.” Tony said to him, turning his back, meaning to bury this, and walk away.
Flicking his eyes up to see the reaction he was getting from the brunette, Steve smiled at the redness that adorned Tony’s cheeks.
your feelings for him to the side. Remember that? Remember the binges, Tony. I‌ have never seen you that broken up before."
Blue eyes crashed with brown again, and honestly, there must have been two magnets implanted in their lips, because Steve was pulling him into another kiss, this one full of heat and saliva.
"I‌ remember the aftermath following the fallout between the both of you. It was like watching a car wreck." She said, trying not to unleash the full extent of her resentment towards him and his feelings.
The feared expression she was waiting on, definitely came. It wasn’t that of unhappiness, it was one of…discomfort.
Infamous last words, and Tony was descending on the purple asshole right after Steve wrapped his arms around the aliens waste, uppercutting him, watching as Tony made a grab at the gauntlet, but was swatted away roughly.
“You’re right, Steve, we really shouldn’t. This was…just, adrenaline. I’m sorry, I’m going to go.” Tony muttered, trying to push back the irrational disappointment he felt.
The blonde sucked a little bit at the head, then brought his mouth down to take the rest to the back of his throat.
Steve raised an eyebrow, leaning off the bed, fiddling around in his belt for what he was looking for.
That wasn't normal for him. He could take a lot of crap from the people he was closest too. But, when it came to Steve, his biting words and disappointed looks made Tony want to curl into himself.
Steve couldn’t. He closed his eyes and clenched his teeth, burying his hand in his hair, gripping the strands between his fingers.
There was the screaming again. Dust flew around him, taking Thanos and his band of merry assholes with him to whatever hell there was.
He couldn’t. How could he tell this woman, who had stood beside him for near fifteen years that he might have feelings for a man, who had beat him, then left him out of commission in a bunker?
In the middle of his telling of plans, Steve was slowly pulling his uniform back on, shakily clasping the buttons, doing back up the zipper.
A feeling of possessiveness ran over Steve and he leaned up to take the head of Tony’s manhood into his mouth.
It wasn’t fair, it was never smooth sailing with Tony, he always had his eye on something else in the distance.
“Listen, I’ve been unsure of a lot of things in my life, unsure of this era, unsure of the Avengers, unsure of myself. But, there is one thing I’ve always been sure of…and that’s you, Tony.”
“I have stumbled upon the definition of a sub drop, a form of panic attack,” the soldier continued calmly. “Of course, I don´t know what you have been up to but... if you need anything...” He shrugged. “Just let me know and I promise I won´t tell a soul about it.”
“What brings you here?” Steve asked casually. “Thought you were in Malibu. You look like you haven´t slept in days, has anything come up?”
Their eyes met for a long moment. Tony felt the heat spread on his face. He hadn´t showered, hadn´t slept, he was probably looking as terrible as he smelt.
“Money can take care of that, too,” Tony assured him, his eyes still closed, his whole body relaxed. He looked so peaceful like that. Steve had never seen him this way before but he was happy for his friend – no, his lover.
“You know.... people who wear collars.” Okay, Steve was totally blushing right now but at least he managed to keep a straight face. “It doesn´t seem to be a... a queer thing nowadays. Straight people do it, too.”
When Tony woke up again his first thought was what could have possibly happened to his bedroom that it became this tiny. Then he realized it wasn´t his own bedroom. Memories washed over him like a flood.
It was just a whispered confession but Tony stopped the car at a red traffic light, bend over and kissed Steve without hesitation. The soldier closed his eyes and relaxed. Their kiss only lasted a few seconds before Tony had to focus on the traffic again but it left Steve breathless and hungry for more.
Tony entered the living room while Steve was sitting on the sofa and watching news. He tried to stay up to date but the 21st century was just too fast for his 1940s mind. Something worthy of being on the news seemed to happen 24 hours a day.
Tony pressed the button to call the elevator. His eyes were so big and dark. The way he licked his lips would make Steve go insane for sure.
The tablet on the living room table in front of Tony lit up, showing an overview of Captain America`s heart rate throughout the night.
He found Tony´s clothes in a pile on the ground but getting the billionaire dressed was tedious. It took minutes to get Tony to put on a jeans and a shirt with no underwear. Happy decided that this was good enough, he just wanted to leave and escape the eyes of the horny men gathered around.
Steve was still frowning, but it seemed that Natasha’s words had helped immensely compared to Tony’s own efforts—which was rather disheartening, on Tony’s end. “Only because you think it would be better, Natasha.” He turned to Tony, who had begun to play around with one of the smaller Iron Man suit joints that he’d been attempting to fix. He pocketed it discreetly when he felt Steve’s gaze. “How much will it be?”
He shut his sketchbook and returned his materials to the pencil case. He then placed both on the bedside table and stood to brush his teeth and change. However, when he turned off the lights and pulled the blankets over himself, Steve found his mind restless and his body unwilling to slip away into unconsciousness.
The last sentence seemed to have been relayed with a pointed look at Tony, which he would have ignored whether or not JARVIS had eyes.
As men in dark suits exited the cars and began to keep the crowd away, a bald man with an eyepatch approached him. His expression betrayed nothing, but his voice held genuine concern as he said, “Look, I’m sorry about that little show back there but . . . we thought it best to break it to you slowly.”
“Shut up,” Steve had responded, though in reality he’d been a bit winded from their long walk across the park. “Quit mothering me and just walk.”
—but I’m not going to budge on this one. I don’t believe it for a second that you don’t realize how much better a StarkPhone is in every sense.”
“I don’t need your charity, Mr. Stark,” Steve bit out, appearing to have lost his patience. Tony didn’t know whether this newfound anger was due to his persistence or his attitude, but outwardly, he didn’t react. “It’s kind of you to offer, but I’m afraid I’ll have to decline.”
Roughly an hour before closing, Steve was startled out of his persistent staring match with the clock by the chime of the bell as the door opened. “Welcome to Happs,” he started, the customary greeting falling from his lips instinctively before he abruptly cut himself off and took in the stranger’s appearance.
Steve grimaced—she was right, he knew that, but he also knew it would hurt even more if he tried to put Bucky out of his mind. Nonetheless, he appreciated her concern. “Thank you, Natasha.” He would keep her words in mind.
“Trying to be prepared in case we need to save it,” Fury corrected. “If, and when, Earth is threatened, we need to be prepared. Considering the circumstances in which the serum in your veins was created, I’m sure you understand my reasons for this, Captain.”
“The sheer lack of trust you both have in me,” he exclaimed with feigned disappointment. “Just this once—only because Pepper always sees everything.”
The director invited Steve to return to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters (not that Steve had any other options) and explained first and foremost that the Allies had won. Which Steve had already partially inferred, based on the lack of
Natasha gave him a pat on the shoulder. “I’ll leave you in Barton’s hands for now. Call me when you guys are finished, there’s one more stop to make before we go back.” She met Clint’s gaze and gave him a brief nod before exiting the café.
Their proximity had always made Steve feel warmer than any number of clothes or blankets. It had become second nature for him to be beside Bucky, to have his hands helping him stand after a confrontation and to hear his laughter in his ear. His mother had told him once that home was a person, not a place, and it had been in these moments that Steve had known with more certainty than ever that Bucky was his home.
yielded some other useful information, however; judging from Steve’s tense stance and the tight press of his mouth, Tony was willing to bet that Steve was—or perhaps had been—a soldier. He couldn’t deduce where or in which field, but early recruitment into the army would possibly also explain Steve’s complete incompetency with technology (and
Once she was gone, Clint waved Steve into the back room. “The other employees will be preparing the food in here throughout the day and they’ll pass it to you using this counter here.” He pointed to the window in the wall between them that had a wide metal surface as its base. At Steve’s look of awe towards the machinery inside, he added, “You’ll never need to be back here, don’t worry.”
And once again, Tony was astounded, but for a reason far worse than the previous. He’d never expected to hear that name here—and certainly not from someone he’d never met, someone he wouldn’t have expected to be involved in anything to do with his family, someone whose relationship with him should have just been employee-to-customer. But the fact remained that this coffee shop worker had spoken the one name Tony least wanted to hear.
But that would be a question for his refreshed brain to ponder in the morning. If he had any time to do so between all his projects.
As a child, Steve had never had many chances to indulge in the finer aspects of life—having a billion and one health complications while growing up in the Great Depression will do that to you. So it would’ve been an understatement to describe his reaction as anything less than absolutely entranced.
With a grim turn of his lips, the man shakes his head. “My sympathies, Captain. Now, if you could please return with us—there’s still a lot to sort out for your return to the world.”
Natasha was unmoved by his threat, rolling her eyes as she moved around the counter to take a seat at an empty table. “You wouldn’t, we make the best coffee when you’re not dying of sleep deprivation, and this is the only shop you can stand within walking distance of your tower.”
That made Clint laugh and playfully knock his shoulder into Steve’s. “Who knew Captain America had a sense of humour?”
When Tony awoke, it wasn’t by JARVIS’s alert, but rather the intense emotion of an unpleasant visit down the memory lane. No one had mentioned his father to him in so long that he’d almost forgotten how it felt to remember—cold brush-offs that were worse than fiery anger, the look in Howard’s eyes that was not just one of disappointment, but worse—uncaring like a stranger.
“Wait, are you talking about Stark Tower?” Steve interjected. “That big ugly building one block down? That’s
Perhaps it was the shock of waking up in the twenty-first century, perhaps it was being surrounded by objects and buildings that seemed so, so familiar but were so different. Perhaps his body knew how long he’d slept and was releasing its pent-up energy in the form of not giving Steve the peace of slumber. Perhaps it was the images of his comrades flashing over his eyelids, the image of Bucky falling from that train, Peggy’s voice in his ear.
“Sixty-eight, sir,” JARVIS corrected. “Protocols state that Ms. Potts is alerted after forty-eight hours without nutritional intake, and after sixty-five, Ms. Potts has the authority to override any lockdown system, including blackouts.”
By the time he called Natasha to pick him up, Steve was beginning to feel the consequences of his superhuman metabolism, combined with not having eaten enough at breakfast that morning (he was trying to save food, okay?). Clint’s solution was to feed him an assortment of baked goods that he’d made for the café as potential candidates for future weekly specials.
With a nod, she shoved the items into his arms and invited herself into his room. Steve followed and placed them on his desk, awaiting her explanation.
From her spot by the counter, on which she’d been leaning as she waited for Steve to replenish his nutrients (questionable, since all Clint fed him were desserts), Natasha chuckled. “See, Steve, now you don’t need to worry about Barton having obtained our positions using nefarious reasons. I know you were thinking it,” she added when she saw the look on Steve’s face.
Steve inwardly agreed, still clutching the flip phone in wonder. “Is that the end of today’s lesson then?” he half-joked, grinning when it made her crack a smile.
“JARVIS, find everything you can on Steve Rogers.” Tony would have done the hacking himself—a perfect opportunity to see what the latest S.H.I.E.L.D. files had to say about him—but sleep seemed like a much better idea. “Wake me up in four hours,” he instructed with a yawn.
Steve skimmed over the list and asked for a pen and some paper to copy it down, but Clint waved him off with the promise that he would procure a laminated version before he left today.
“Oh, don’t worry about that,” Clint reassured him after hearing his concerns. “If you aren’t comfortable with it, then just stick to getting the orders and cleaning up the floor once in a while. The policy here is that customers throw away whatever garbage they can and leave the dishes on the tables, so you’ll need to collect those.”
Although Steve’s sense of justice and loyalty had never wavered, he wasn’t sure he was ready to be Captain America again. And who was to say the world was ready for him?
A helpful voice in his head reminded him that it wasn’t so late yet and most coffee shops were likely still open, though their products rarely satisfied his tastes. Well, with the exception of that one place down East 45th and a select couple others on opposite sides of the city. But Tony did not have the energy or patience to head anywhere further than his own (figurative) front lawn, so that left only one of those options available.
He jerked back to the present, turning his head back to Natasha so quickly that he was sure if he were anyone else, he would’ve heard a crack from his neck. “Sorry,” he said. “Just. Remembering some things.” Natasha stayed silent and Steve felt obligated to add, “I used to come here a lot. With—with my boyfriend.”
was quite the cozy little place. Upon walking through the door, they were greeted by a completely empty room bordered by
When one soulmate died, the end of the string still connected to the other would turn completely white and cut itself off, curling around the finger like a ring. But Steve’s wasn’t like that, instead remaining a cross between the regular state and that of a soulmate’s death, and Tony, ever curious, wanted to know why.
“Sure you don’t.” A casual smirk on his face, Bucky had lifted his arm and Steve had known he was going to ruffle his hair but stood there and allowed him to do just that. “Gotta keep yourself warm, or you’ll get sick again and then who would I tease?” Then, he’d spotted a bench and dragged them both over to rest.
His head snapped up and his right hand flew up towards his ear, fumbling with something—inside it? Behind it? Steve couldn’t really tell. Then, he grinned. “Oh, hey, Nat. Didn’t think you’d be here so early. And this must be the famous Captain America.”
. Are you telling me that in addition to using an Apple product, you’ve been using that hunk of metal which absolutely
He could’ve demanded a regular price, but to say he didn’t pity Steve would have been a lie. Honestly, an iPhone in this age? And a
posters or other Nazi-related propaganda lining the streets of New York. To his credit, Nick Fury proceeded to provide Steve with a stack of history books outlining the events from 1945 to the beginning of the new century, as well as a text outlining the technological developments of the last few decades. At least he’d finally understand how moving, coloured billboards were invented.
They returned to the front counter, where Clint introduced him to what he called the point of sale, or POS, system. It included a touch-screen monitor overtop a cash register, a machine that read a form of payment called debit or credit cards (“Ask Nat about it later, if I try to explain it all to you now, I’ll get off track and it’ll take hours.”), and another machine that printed out receipts.
Steve almost laughed. The first time he’d woken in seventy years and the first thing they did was to lie, to give him a false sense of security—what a way to make an impression. Even if the future welcomed him, he wasn’t sure he could welcome the future. But there was no other choice for him to make in that regard.
Unfortunately, in his eagerness to relieve his frustration, Steve had forgotten to take into account his own strength. With a particularly strong hit, the punching bag flew off its chain and landed just in front of the wall, split open, leaving Steve’s arm frozen mid-swing without a target. He let both his arms drop to his sides, breathing heavily—not at the physical exertion, but the emotions that he’d allowed to surface from their repressed place in his mind.
When he returned to the tower, his mind having wandered a few galaxies away and back, Tony realized that he’d been so sidetracked from his discovery of Steve with an iPhone, he’d completely forgotten to have a good look at Steve’s string. Which had been one of his main purposes of going, next to caffeine.
quickly not to pry about her. The existence of Steve Rogers itself was a mystery waiting to be solved, what with such a unique string and a job at a shop infested with S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.
Clint was already waiting for him behind the counter when he stepped back out, a grin on his face as Steve approached. “Okay, ready for your first twenty-first-century job?”
‘Steve’ complied as Tony began to protest, “Come on, Nat, don’t be like that. I need to get back to work.”
Steve took the phone from her when she offered it and tentatively experimented in pressing a few of the buttons as Natasha had demonstrated earlier.
“You need to eat, then sleep,” she commanded after a glance at his disheveled appearance. “And shower, too. No, you do not get to protest” —Tony obediently closed his mouth— “and yes, I mean
The message, it turned out, was not a summons. Well, not an immediate one, at least (and thank God for that). It turned out that S.H.I.E.L.D. had adjustments to their demands regarding the helicarrier vehicles that Tony had begun to design, which meant that Tony would have to make accommodations for whatever they want to add to—or hopefully take away from—their lengthy and tedious list.
“Captain Rogers, this is Agent Romanoff. She will accompany you anytime you need to go outside.” He held up a hand before Steve’s protests could push past his lips. “This is for your own safety, Captain. The world has changed since the forties and until you can hold your own in a conversation of modern pop culture references and slang, I’m afraid I can’t let you go out alone.”
Tony was a man of high standards, despite what the tabloids may think, but this man—blond with blue eyes, delectable muscles, an air that practically pushed innocence and comfort in your face—Tony was astounded by him.
,” she stressed, then turned away momentarily to direct a much warmer smile and a small wave to Dum-E, who had wandered towards her with his singular arm lifted in greeting.
Tony raised his eyebrows. “Well, that’s a first. Yes, though I’m assuming you’ve made the connection in the name—Tony Stark, StarkPhone, Stark Industries, Stark Tower. Makes perfect sense.”
The following fifteen minutes was filled with Tony going through all the possible advantages of possessing a StarkPhone, paying extra attention to areas where his product drastically outranked Apple’s (which, if you asked him, was pretty much everything). He glanced up at Steve a few times in between, only to find him watching the demonstrations with nothing short of pure awe, even though his eyebrows were often scrunched up in confusion.
“My name is Nick Fury. I’m the director of the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division. Welcome to the twenty-first century, Captain.”
“I have a job?” Steve asked, already flipping through the pages. His name and birthdate were his own—Steven Grant Rogers, age twenty-six, born July 4 (of 1985, not 1918)—and the additional information revealed that he’d been raised in a small, rural town Steve had never heard of by technophobic parents who were now deceased and had joined the army at eighteen. It wasn’t a perfect cover, and any professional would be able to see right through it, but he supposed it was enough for his purposes.
If Tony had to describe his day—or rather, his last sixty-eight hours, because that was how long he’d been awake, according to JARVIS—in a single phrase, it would be
instinctively glance towards the pinky finger adorned by a single string, wiped the breadcrumbs on his fingers, and then accepted the handshake. “Tony Stark.”
Tony wanted to bang his head into the table, but caught Pepper’s unimpressed look and held up his hands. “I’m going, I’m going.”
He shook his head. “I’ve only gone through major events and changes to legislation so far.” And the document that contained public knowledge of and response to his identity as Captain America, but he didn’t feel that was necessary to mention.
(Bucky had come down with a cold a day later. Steve served him porridge in bed and drew his portrait as he ate.)
“Of course, Captain Rogers,” she returned. “When you wish, you will also find me an excellent sparring partner. Director.” With a tip of her head towards Fury, she swept out of the room in long, confident strides, leaving Steve staring after her in admiration and curiosity.
It was Manhattan, that much he knew—he could recognize the New York City streets anywhere, no matter how much they differed from what he was used to. Almost as soon as he’d exited the building, a car that looked nothing like the ones he’d ever seen—not even Stark’s ‘flying’ ones—nearly collided with him. Pedestrians hurried along the side of the road, shielding themselves from the drizzle with dark umbrellas. Steve barely spared a glance at all of it as he picked up the pace and ran as far as he could from wherever he’d been held before, though he only had a vague sense of where he was going.
Steve exhaled in relief, knowing he would soon regain some form of the past. “Thank you, Director. Good afternoon.”
Fury took Steve to the communal dining area next, explained mealtimes and, quite considerately, the lack of necessity for rationing, then maneuvered them back to his own office. There, a redheaded woman, whose strong stance reminded Steve so much of one Peggy Carter, awaited them.
“We’re here.” Natasha’s voice and sudden stop made Steve snap his eyes towards where they’d stopped.
When he’d finished drawing the night view of New York as seen through his window, Steve glanced at the clock and blinked in surprise. 11:34 PM. When had it become so late?
Disclaimer: the mentions of science at the beginning of this chapter are not accurate to reality. (Thank you to my beta-reader who wrote all that science-y stuff that I can't understand XD)
Steve glanced around him and, almost instinctively, replied, “Yeah. Yeah, I just . . . I had a date.”
(It was long after closing the shop that Steve realized Tony had swiped away his iPhone in his departure. Not one of Tony’s most honest moves, but hey, this was an attractive man who had been obviously miseducated about technological devices, so he needed to take alternative-to-normal measures.
Looking decidedly self-satisfied, Clint finally sat down across from Steve at the table on which he’d laid out his creations. “Hey, once you start working here, you can have the extras whenever you want. Your metabolism will just burn it all off anyway.”
“Don’t believe everything you see in the comics,” Steve replied drily. He hadn’t even known there were comics based on his life until the previous day, and had requested a few from Fury out of curiosity. Twenty pages in, he’d decided that had probably been a mistake.
A radio played atop a dresser. “Curveball, high and outside for ball one. So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4. And the crowd well knows . . .”
Steve whirled around at the sound of Fury’s voice, his posture straightening instinctively. “As much as expected. Sir,” he added at Fury’s expectant quietness.
It made Steve feel a little funny to hear his adaptation referred to as his “new life,” even though he’d been the first to use it this way. It also irked him a bit that this Agent Clint Barton had “arranged” their job positions there, though he may have been being overly sensitive about it.
Around rush hour, the flow increased as people coming off work came to pick up desserts or grab a sandwich and pastry to-go. Though the food selection was limited—they were a drinks-focused café, after all—its options were well-priced and, judging from the images and their popularity, quite delicious indeed.
As his senses began to realign themselves with his consciousness, Steve pushed himself up to a sitting position slowly and took in his surroundings. He felt tension from inactivity pulsing in his muscles as he swung his legs over the side of the bed. There was a fan turning slowly on the ceiling and the only source of light came from two open windows (other than a lamp so dim it contributed almost nothing).
“Not quite. I’m going to take you to your new workplace today so you can start next week.” Natasha eyed his white T-shirt and shorts. “Change into something a little warmer—it’s rainy today.”
. Your fridge probably doesn’t have anything in it, so at least go to that café you like a couple blocks down—I’m sure they’re still open.
Steve had been staring at him in a daze since halfway through his little speech and was only just beginning to react. “Um. Can I, uh, get you something?”
Steve still seemed reluctant to accept, but apparently Natasha’s vouch had convinced him. “I don’t have enough cash, and there aren’t any card machines I could use, so—”
Steve blinked down at the box. “A computer.” He was tempted to glance at the walls to see if they’d hidden the processing units behind the paint, but something told him that would make him seem . . . well, technologically uneducated.
“Hi, Steve.” Hearing her humour-filled voice through the device while she stood a foot away was odd, but Steve wasn’t really in the mood to care. “Okay, press the red little phone symbol to end the call.”
, and learned from Natasha how to use the Internet—and, by extension, Google—to his benefit. He’d never admit it, but the first time Natasha had opened something called Google Chrome on the laptop she’d given him, he’d shrieked at the list of suggestions that had appeared the instant he’d typed a single word into the “search bar.” Once he’d overcome his initial shock, however, Steve had discovered the ease of obtaining information from the Internet. He’d ventured into a few sites he’d rather not have seen, but his overall experience had been better than he’d expected.
Because when Tony arrived at the coffeeshop twenty minutes before closing, prepared to dramatically announce his entrance, he found Steve engaging in what seemed to be a serious conversation . . . with Siri.
Dark brown hair and eyes, an expression of confidence matched by his posture. A moustache and beard framing the slightest quirk of his lips. This was no stranger’s appearance. This was someone Steve had never thought he’d see again—someone proclaimed dead by all the files and Wikipedia pages he’d read—but no. This was someone slightly different, too.
Tony could tell what he’d been about to suggest—likely something along the lines of waiting until their next meeting to complete the transaction—and interrupted, “Just start using it for now and I’ll collect the payment another time. I promise I won’t run away from you.” He topped it off with a wink, left a bill on the counter for his drink, and walked out of the shop, hot chocolate in hand, before Steve could say another word.
“Sleep is for the weak,” Tony proclaimed. He took the offered items of food from a pair of hands without a second glance at their owner. “By the way, who’s this?” he said after taking a bite from the bagel.
Natasha rounded the counter, staring down at Tony with disapproval. “I know the only reason you’re here at this hour is because Pepper forced you to eat and you don’t have food at home, which means you’ve stayed up for far too long already. Steve” —she turned to the blond man— “go grab him a cream cheese bagel and a sandwich, we still have a few left. And don’t make the coffee.”
Steve inclined his head in acknowledgement, but hesitated when he took his first step to leave. “Director, if it’s not too much trouble . . . could I have a notebook and some pencils? The, ah, blank kind. Not the lined ones.”
Natasha had refused to reveal where they were going, so Steve merely followed silently, taking in the changes to a city he used to know like the back of his hand. He pointed out a few notable locations and signs, sometimes interesting and sometimes confusing, for Natasha to explain—people actually enjoyed shooting others in a
for a solid thirty seconds before he remembered why he was there in the first place, and that had not been to ogle stare incredulously at the man conversing with the Apple device.
Seeming to sense his confusion, Natasha opened the box and removed a thinner rectangle that she then split open, revealing one side that contained a screen and another perpendicular to it that held a keyboard. “Technology has come a long way,” she explained. “Oh, have you finished reading the timeline of technological developments yet?”
. The brown-haired man who stood behind the counter was completely focused on a small device in his hand and did not look up at their arrival. It seemed rude not to acknowledge one’s customers, in Steve’s opinion, so he rapped his knuckles on the wall by the door. Still, the man continued on as if he hadn’t heard.
“Try to memorize most of the stuff we sell and their prices, especially the special items of each week,” he advised. “It’ll make working the machine and answering questions a lot easier for you.”
When Steve glanced at Natasha, she was shaking her head with a smile that seemed to soften around the edges when she turned to face the man. It made him even more confused, but he merely watched as she marched up to him and waved her hand right in front of his face.
The good thing was that Fury had not attempted to force him to take up Captain America’s mantle again, at least not yet. Steve could only hope that it stayed that way until he’d found a place for himself here.
After his experimentation with the Internet had granted him enough knowledge about current culture that Steve hadn’t been able to truly understand from the history books, Natasha deemed him to have progressed far enough to be released into the world (under supervision, of course). She handed him a schedule of his shifts at the coffee shop and told him to begin the following Monday.
That was simple enough, at least. Steve went over all the procedures involved with ringing up orders again before Clint turned his attention to the menu, which was displayed across several screens overhead.
“Where am I?” Steve asked, his tone calm despite the stiffening of his shoulders in preparation for her answers.
“Uh, I didn’t mean to offend you, I just—you look like someone I used to know so I, ah, didn’t really think before saying that and, uh— So, what can I get you?” He ended with a somewhat sheepish smile and an awkward wave towards the menu.
Tony stared at him for another ten seconds, then walked up to the counter without bothering to plaster a smile onto his face. “Large Americano with five extra shots of espresso,” he grumbled and pulled out a random bill from his wallet that probably could have covered twenty coffee orders.
meant when, three days and a particularly gruelling sparring session with one Natasha Romanoff (during which they somehow improved their status to first-name-basis) later, he was interrupted during his post-breakfast studying of modern life by a series of short knocks. Standing at the door was Natasha, carrying a file as thick as a textbook, a rectangular box the size of two textbooks placed side by side, and a second box smaller than a notebook but much deeper, all stacked on top of each other in her arms.
Tony quickly quoted a price that wasn’t even close to what the company would be demanding when this model entered the market in a few months, and judging by the amused expression on Natasha’s face, she knew it too. But Tony was betting on his instinct and observations that Steve wasn’t nearly as knowledgeable about the current smartphone market and certainly wouldn’t notice how unrealistic it may be.
That last bit still needed more observation though, Tony decided as he climbed into bed. It could have simply been a coincidence on Steve’s part.
He must’ve been less subtle than he’d thought, because Clint noticed his staring and said, “Whatever you’re thinking, it’s probably right.”
Upon walking through the door, the first thing Tony noticed was the emptiness of the café, which wasn’t unusual given the time. The second was the man behind the counter who had looked up at the chime of his arrival.
“Of course, sir,” JARVIS agreed, and Tony could hear the amusement dripping off his AI’s voice, but he also knew that he’d been awake for too long and the hot chocolate hadn’t helped his fatigue in anyway. Now that the excitement from introducing Steve to the wonders of the StarkPhone had faded, his lack of sleep was even more apparent, both in his appearance and his mind.
When Civil War happened, Tony was cracking to pieces every time he got into an argument with the man. Every piercing word, every dirty look made him want to fall apart.
“What do you want me to do, Tony? Huh? Be your side man? While you go back home and have dinner with your family, and still fuck Pepper on a daily basis. Not to mention be fucking me too!”
“I cheated on my wife, Steve!” He yelled in the blonde’s face, stopping his struggling to crumble beneath the other man.
It may have been minutes, hours or days before Tony got his heart rate under control. His eyes gained back their focus as a heavy weight laid on his right shoulder.
“I thought it was enough. She’s an amazing woman. I just-fuck!” He yelled, getting up off the bed, pacing around.
“No. But she wants too. I can tell. I mean, why not? She’s attractive, you’re the epitome of human perfection. Bumping uglies wouldn’t be so terrible now would it?”
Steve couldn’t laugh, could only sob into Tony’s hair as he clutched the back of his head and rained kisses on his temple, mashing his eyes into his silky strands.
Steve moved back, letting Tony's legs slip free and his thighs wound around his hips, the same finger slipping deep, now accompanied by a second.
“Move on me, Tony. Take me deeper. Yeah, there you go. Fuck.” Steve gasped, watching as the other male fucked himself on his dick. Throwing his head back, Steve pulled against Tony’s thighs, drawing the man closer, moaning loudly at the warmth that kept enveloping his cock.
Putting his head in his hands, he squeezed his eyes shut, trying to block out the image of Tony’s half burnt face.
“You don’t understand what us fighting did to me. Not like this, but…the other, Tony. This was nothing compared to what happened. This was sparring compared to that. I couldn’t ever fight you like that again. I know you want me to explain why I did everything, to explain why I hid the truth from you. And I don’t have a solid reason, I don’t. All I can say is I didn’t want to have to choose between you and Bucky.”
Standing in front of Strange, Steve watched as the man grabbed the time stone out of his necklace, the yellow object floating between them, the brunettes arms working different tandems around them.
Steve didn’t message her again for awhile, his own thoughts jumbled as he lay in bed, staring at his own ceiling.
“Me too.” Steve gasped, shoving his nose into Tony’s right ear, panting roughly against the sweaty skin.
“Steve? You’ve been locked in your room for going on three days now. I’ve given you space, now, I want to know what the issue is? It’s not like you to shut yourself up in your room.”
"Thanks." He finally managed to say, stroking her back, relishing in the last hug she'd probably ever bestow on him.
“Hey, Cap. I was kind of in the middle of something. Old age must be doing funny things to your vision.” He said to the taller male, who looked rather annoyed.
Steve nodded, groaning, sealing his lips to Tony’s, the bed creaking even harder now at the super soldiers rough thrusts.
“Tony made that sacrifice play because he couldn’t watch you do it. And you are right, it was between him and you. But, I knew, he would never let that happen.”
Closing his eyes, he breathed out a heavy sigh. Was he really so pathetic that merely touching this man made him horny?
“I figured, considering you made me a suit that complimented my butt very well.” He growled, moving back on top of Tony, pushing his legs apart.
“We should move this inside.” He muttered against Steve’s lips, flicking his tongue out to run across the seam of his mouth.
Without a doubt, he loved her. She would be the only woman he would ever love. But...the pull he felt towards Steve was like...an addiction. One that he had tried for
“Of course that’s not what I want! I want-fuck! I want…” But he didn’t finish, putting his head in his hand, scrubbing viciously at his forehead.
Laughing lightly, Tony looked the picture over again, his chest squeezing at the stoic expression on Steve’s face getting out of that sheek, black car.
“Well, can’t say I’m honestly that surprised. Took longer than I expected, but hey, what are you gonna do?”
Tugging at his hair, he felt the room start to tilt around him, making his vision hazy and the air thicker, cutting off his breathing.
“I explained it, Steve. She’s my wife, let me worry about her, okay?” He grit out beneath grinding teeth.
“Fuck me, Steve. Please.” Tony gasped, clawing at Steve’s biceps, eyes rolling back at the pleasure of their cocks sliding against one another.
around here lately? Did things go sideways?” Tony asked, trying to make conversation, not knowing he was winding Steve up again.
“You look even better than you did before.” Steve whispered to him, moving his head down to lick down Tony’s chest.
“Jarvis, we both know he’d try his level best to break down my door if I said I was feeling even remotely ill.”
Many times, when he was passed out at his bench in the workshop, after the war between him and Steve, she would find him clutching that flip phone to his chest, his eyebrows furrowed.
Tony gasped at the quickness of the position change, watching as Steve's blue eyes blazed down at him, big hands gripping his thighs, spreading his legs as wide as they could go, planting his ankles on Steve's shoulders.
“I have some R&D stuff to finish. Big proposal really, I’ve already wasted a lot of time today, can’t lose my focus on that.”
Tony watched them interact, watching as Steve gave her little smiles, and she told him things that he found humorous.
That night, in his bed, Tony laid there, staring up at the ceiling, recounting the events of the day.
The super soldier, thankfully, did stop, and slipped to the ground, amidst all the calamity he had caused.
“I’m glad she could make you happy.” Steve murmured, watching as the brunette adorned his glasses and waved the waitress over.
Steve was trembling, heat bursting up his spine as Tony's fingers and tight hole wrenched him into orgasm.
“I had to make a world where Tony Stark was still in it. And he will be. He’ll get his life with Pepper, he’ll get to bond with Peter more, and watch Morgan grow.”
“Oh fuck. You don’t wear underwear with your uniform, Cap?” Tony breathed, cock getting unbearably harder at what he was seeing.
“S-Steve. You don’t have to leave. Come on, there’s no need for that.” Tony said, trying to joke, but unable to keep the shaking out of his voice.
“I’m coming, fuck, coming.” Tony managed to get out, his back arching as Steve tensed up, his hips thrashing against Tony’s bubbly ass.
Darkness washed over Tony’s features as he plucked at the nipples this time, twisting them a little bit.
Leaning forward more, Steve bent Tony almost in half, planting his hands beside Tony's head, now thrusting with feet and hips, rolling his pelvis in circles.
. He saw all the planets, knew every equation, understood all of the World's questions. He saw the dead, felt the living, every breath that was taken, every emotion felt.
"I never wanted this to happen. I‌ enjoy our life the way it is, Pepper." He said, trying to find the words that might make her change her mind.
Who was he to even think romantic things about Tony Stark? The man he had beaten brutally, the man he lied to.
Tony himself was arched up, his mouth fallen open, broken sobs and gasps filling the air, his own hips trying to follow Steve's.
Steve groaned, feeling said finger run between his cheeks and push against his own hole, penetrating him and hooking up to graze his sensitive spot.
“I have loved you since after New York. You were…everything my father said you would be. And, I watched you travel the country, making little speeches, visiting orphanages, veterans homes, hospitals. And…God, you just
He wasn't very loud, but Pepper did not want the fight to escalate, so she walked forward and grabbed his bicep, dragging him to the front porch, quietly shutting the door behind her.
Tony was about to give him a funny quip, but lost all thought when Steve’s fingers trailed up his thighs, stopping when he pushed against the back of his sac.
He had built his first circuit board at four. Pepper wouldn’t be surprised if she didn’t produce one soon herself.
“God, Tony.” He moaned, arching his back, feeling his release crash over him, stealing away his breath and thoughts all in one go.
“Why the fuck are you standing there?! HELP ME!” He thundered, voice breaking with full on hysteria now.
And she knew it when all Tony could ever whine about was Steve and his superiority complex. His stoicism that drove Tony insane, and his physique that the Greek Gods would weep over.
“Ugh, overstimulation, Cap.” Tony managed to grit through his teeth, the pleasure and pain crashing together to hurry him into a dry orgasm.
When his image had faded out, Steve choked on a sob working its way up his throat, emotions that he was trying to shove back coming to the forefront.
Tony punched him, watching in glee when his head snapped sideways, lips starting to pour a little bit of blood.
"He looks at you like you discovered the sun, Tony." And Pepper closed her eyes, remembering the last time she saw the two in his lab, the
"F-fuck you." Tony managed to hiss, his hands falling on Steve's ass to clench the pale flesh, smacking both globes loudly.
Steve was beaming with happiness when he grabbed a coffee and watched the people outside of the coffeeshop waiting for Tony. He just came back from the doctor´s appointment in preparation for his phalloplasty. He took a sip from his coffee, trying to calm himself.
He let go off Tony´s hand and made his way to the conference room where Tony had gathered two dozens of journalists from the whole country. Faced with the cameras and microphones the soldier had to remind himself several times that he was Captain America and he never ran away.
By the time they arrived at the tower Tony was a little more clearheaded. He walked on his own to the elevator, absentmindedly running the thumb over the collar he was still wearing.
“Of course I´m talking about you, Cap,” the billionaire laughed. “I wanted to do this for so long, I...”
“No, no, I´m ready,” Steve answered and was about to change the topic to the fact that he had an uterus and a vagina instead of a penis and if this was a problem, but Tony cut him off by pointing at Steve´s feet.
He took a few minutes to compose himself. His clothes felt used and dirty when he put them on again but he didn´t have anything else with him. Feeling a tiny bit better he left the bathroom. His mind was working itself in a state of frenzy but luckily, Steve behaved normal.
“When you showed up with that collar,” Steve said, avoiding Tony´s eyes, “I looked into that a little.”
The soldier entered the elevator and ordered JARVIS to bring him upstairs to his bedroom but Tony managed to get in just before the doors closed. He was breathing heavily.
The first thing Steve felt when he woke up after being asleep for eight hours was how hot his body felt. Maybe it was due to the heavy blanket covering him, maybe it was from the pain in his crotch that pulsed through his body.
Steve took his time to examine the dicks on the screen further. He wouldn´t have guessed that those were not penises of men who were born with the right pair of genitals. Suddenly, he felt a strong urge to reach down his own legs where he found nothing.
The door was being opened just a little, still held by a small chain. Droplets of water were running down Steve´s forehead, his hair still wet from the shower.
Tony picked up a bottle of wine from the kitchen and when he turned around to the very startling looking soldier he smirked.
He managed to get Tony into the backseat, even closing the seat belt for him. Then they quietly made their way through the night back to the tower.
“Why didn´t you ask earlier?” It bothered Steve that they had taken so long to confess their mutual feelings.
When he swung his legs out of the bed he noticed a pile of clothing next to the bed. A T-Shirt, work out pants, a hoodie and a towel. It wouldn´t fit him but Tony decided it was better than wearing his old, sweat and cum stained clothes.
The billionaire knew exactly what he was doing, driving Steve insane with his dick. It was different than last night, when Steve was on top. And he decided that he preferred fucking his partner over being fucked but for now feeling Tony on top and deep inside of him was fine.
"Pep, there's something, something I have to tell you. And-I think you need to sit down for it. I, uh." He stopped, rubbing his eyes.
His heart was thudding so hard now, he was sure she could probably see it. Even in the shitty lamp light.
with not being Iron Man. What has being him brought me anyway? Besides multiple trips to the hospital and a group of people that
"I'm not going anywhere. We'll still live together, until everything is put back in order. After-after you beat Thanos. Then, afterwards, we'll discuss separating."
“I’m really sorry, you shouldn’t have to put up with this. Please, go back t-to bed, and if I woke up Morgan or Pepper, I’m really sorry. Friday called you without notifying me that she would.”
"Pep." He finally mumbled, his nostrils flaring with emotions that were starting to filter through his eyes.
It was happening, the wind was picking up again, and Steve knew he had to distract the brunette from grabbing Thanos’s hand.
“Hang on. Hang on. I know what to do.” Removing his finger very slowly, Steve grabbed Tony’s legs and hoisted them up, almost bending him in half.
“Captain. I know you think you can fix this, but you can’t. Tony knew the odds, it happened the way it was supposed to. Loathe as it is to say, but this was Tony’s destiny.”
And the thought, when it hit Tony, scared the ever-living fuck out of him. Because, he had never felt that way towards anybody before. And from then on, it grew and grew until Steve was always on the forefront of his mind.
She had figured it out when Tony had gotten back from space, when Steve darted past everybody to be by Tony’s side. When he clutched the rail thin man to his side as if he’d disappear, like everyone else had.
Nodding dumbly, Steve’s left hand played with Tony’s balls lightly, but his right hand wedged in his middle finger, curling them slightly, avoiding Tony’s prostate for the time being.
Steve was in his outfit of the battle, shield battered and torn in half. Looking around, he noticed it was towards the end, minutes before Tony would be distracting Thanos and grabbing that damn gauntlet.
Turning swiftly, he saw half of her, then reached his arms out and grabbed her shoulders, pulling her against his chest.
“Shit. Feels really good, Steve. Add another.” Tony moaned, holding his legs open for the man between them.
“D-Did I wake you up? I didn’t wake Pepper up did I?” He asked the brunette, blue eyes almost puppy dog like.
Tony’s hands were trying to assist the clothing removal process, pulling to get the pants off. Grumbling at the time it was taking, they finally managed to pull them down Steve’s thick thighs.
It was much better this time around, Tony seemed more relaxed, and his body wasn’t fighting against Steve’s finger anymore.
“Sir! You’re fighting the Captain again!” Friday interjected, right before a fist was flying at Tony’s temple.
The thought of outer space, and the picture of stars used to bring him peace, now it just frightened him. His trip into space was…exciting? It was what
To drive his statement home, Steve thrusted hard, punching gasps out of the brunette, watching as brown eyes rolled back in pleasure.
"You're not sure? Is that your final answer? I‌ didn't see a picture of Steve when I stepped into your workshop the other night?" She snapped, feeling tears start to form.
like two friends. But, even before then, he watched the super soldier, and it really annoyed him that he was
“There’s a bed in there. Kind of like a guest house for those who don’t want to be housed around our craziness. Full utilities, shower, bed.” He breathed, claiming Steve’s lips again, adding a little tongue.
Tony watched as Steve’s eyes roamed his face, still full of fury and annoyance. But, there was something else there, something he couldn’t define, something that nearly made Tony’s legs turn into mush.
It was easy to diagnose, really. Tony suffered the same guilty conscious on a regular basis. He always had, especially back when he was destroying the SI weapons.
Before ascending the stairs, she looked back at the glass walls, and saw Tony standing there, hands clenched at his sides.
Reaching out, he grabbed Tony’s wrist, pulling him into the bed, pinning him down with the weight of his body.
Steve slowly smiled at the alien fucker, who had finally gotten that he no longer wore the gauntlet when he tried to snap.
Yes, he found her attractive. But, he found Nat attractive as well, doesn’t mean he’d go to bed with her.
The first few times, Pepper wanted to confront him. She wanted to understand his reasoning behind keeping that stupid phone by his side 24/7, but she had known. She just wanted the anger to lean on.
“No, please, don’t take it that way. I didn’t want to choose because I knew, chances were, I wouldn’t choose my friend. Not Bucky. But, it got to the point where you made the choice for me. I couldn’t allow you to kill him for something he had no control over. Just like you would have stopped me from killing Rhodey if the roles had been reversed.”
Steve hated hearing it, hated picturing Tony making love to Pepper. But, he had lost his chance, destroyed his chance with two hands.
“What? Can’t fight me if Barnes isn’t beside you, Rogers? Is what I’m saying sitting a sore spot for you? It must hurt to know that you and your boyfriend broke me do-.”
The super soldier reached down and grasped Tony’s hips, pushing his butt up to get a better angle to hit his prostate.
The brunette growled, twisting the fabric of the suit between his fingers, tugging at the blonde, snarling in his face, watching as the blue eyes widened, defeat nestled in the depths of them.
“I have to fix this. Tony, he, it wasn’t meant for him to make that decision, he has a family here!”
Then Pepper was there, grabbing a hold of her fiancée, shoving him against her chest, crying into his hair.
Steve groaned, his hand trailing down to clutch Tony’s right knee, thrusting it upward to push against the mans shoulder.
Which was nothing but timid smiles, and shy glances most of the time, because even being in Tony’s vicinity was enough to make his heart beat two times faster.
“I don’t want you to have to worry about anything if I tell you, Pep. It’s just…honestly nothing. Just a fleeting thought, really.”
“Mmph.” Tony mumbled against his mouth, laying his full weight on the blonde man, shuddering at the hardness that was pressed into his thigh even harder now.
And here came Steve, with his perfect smile, and blue eyes, with his superior attitude, and stubborn streak a mile wide. He came into Tony's life with all the gusto of a light breeze, considering the two of them never talked to each other. Not really until after Ultron did they really start
They had been working rather well together, up until today that is. No arguments, no snarling at each other, no getting in each others faces. It was safe to say today had killed that streak though.
“I’m heading to bed, Tony. Don’t stay down here too long. Big day tomorrow, and you are having breakfast with Morgan before you go, correct?”
“It’s not all on you, Tony. It’s on me as well. It’s just…Christ. I don’t know.” He finished lamely, hanging his head, moving himself off of the other man.
It was not supposed to be Tony, it was supposed to be Steve. He would have gladly done it. He would have worn that gauntlet, and died looking at…
Tony was only half listening though as his palms slid up the mounds of muscle to glide over pink nipples.
Steve lay beside Tony, after cleaning them both up, his hand trailing along the brunettes skin lazily.
“I thought my destiny was to die in that airplane when I flew into the arctic. I could feel the ice encase me, and I knew then… that this was what I was made for. T-To do the things others couldn’t, to make the sacrifice play for those who shouldn’t
“You are happy here,Tony, right?” She questioned, swallowing around the fear that gripped her esophagus.
The super soldier stumbled a little bit, pulling back from the bag, whipping his head around to look at the person who had disturbed him.
He was staring at Steve, tears trekking down his own face, then, after a second, a small smile was wedging itself in place. Kneeling, he reached out and clasped Steve’s shoulder.
up everything you touched. Like, I was powerless at being pulled into your light, Steve.” Tony gasped out, a tear rolling down his cheek.
The blonde nodded, rising up on his hands beside Tony’s head, thrusting his hips fully in, sheathing himself completely.
“I know, Tony. I understand. This was just…a one off. I, when things get cleared up with Thanos, when everyone comes back, I’m planning on passing on my shield anyway. And uh, I’ll go from there I guess.”
“Tony. Come on. We both know you are your biggest critic. I’m sure you look as beautiful as you always do.”
over that man for years. The last five were better, I‌ suppose. But only because you were angry at him. But you gave him your arc reactor." She said to him, betrayal on her face, her heart pinching, remembering when he had given it to
Steve raised an eyebrow in attitude, shifting Tony’s position to a more comfortable one, spreading his cheeks again, lowering his head down and licking a stripe up his taint.
“No. Bucky was my closest friend when I was younger, my only family after my mother died. Is that efficient enough for you, Tony? Or are you going to not let this go until I say what you evidently want to hear?” He snapped at the shorter man, standing up haughtily.
That was it, all he had left in him. The darkness had completely encompassed him, and at this point, he greeted it. Threw his arms around it, like a friend he was welcoming back.
“S-Steve, stop! Christ, if you continue, I’ll come, and I’m no super soldier here.” Tony gasped when Steve started to suck hard and stroke his hand at the same time.
She was huffing at the end of that sentence, feeling the sting of tears at the back of her eyes again.
“Grab your shield, big hero. And we’ll take this outside.” Tony sneered, moving the rest of the bleeding edge armor over his limbs.
“What’s weird Cap, is you had plenty of time to tell me about my parents. And, what was even more laughable is on that letter you sent.” Tony gritted out, dodging a kick, “You said you were doing it to spare me the pain. Fucking liar.” He hissed, and threw a punch that sent Steve reeling.
Tony landed again, reaching out and grabbing the front of Steve’s uniform, throwing him across the track.
The world around him started to spin, air sticking in his throat, and before he knew it, Tony was falling face first into the dirt, welcoming the darkness.
Tony smirked, God, couldn’t he handle this maturely? Apologize for being rude to the woman he didn’t know, and just move on with his day?
Man alive, he could not help it though. He had tried. Had tried to block it out, to push it back. But…seeing Tony after years of not seeing him was like finally finding water after being out in the desert for months at a time.
Steve grit his teeth even harder, the same ferocious jealousy clutched at his guts, making him feel shame so deep it almost choked him.
Ducking at the aliens that were flinging themselves at him, Steve was bounding towards the middle, eyeing the purple fucker.
They were working on Steve’s suit, orchestrating a safer, and more diligent management of the shield, and getting it in Steve’s hand faster.
"Yes, okay, I know! I'm sorry, Pepper. I'm sorry I fucked up, I'm sorry that you-that you have to put up with my bullshit, okay? I'm sorry!"
Keeping his back to the man, he heard Tony move across the floor, planting himself in front of the blonde male.
“Are you going to say something, Steve? Or at least shield your eyes in disgust so I can gauge your reaction?” Tony asked, sounding a little anxious/aggravated at the silence.
“Um, well, it could stem from the fact that I watched multiple people turn to ashes in front of me.” Steve mumbled in a gravelly voice.
“No! I’m not going to let him die. He isn’t dying because he had to lay on the wire! Because he had to be a self sacrificing idiot!”
“Of course, I got a little irritated, because I knew, just by hearing him say your name, that there was no way he was involving you with this issue, there was no way he was calling you to involve you in the chaos that was about to ensue.”
Steve kept his hips rolling, eyes never leaving Starks face, taking his pleasure, and giving it back tenfold.
Tony stood across the way, watching as fury climbed up the blonde mans features, but nothing was said.
They were outside at the track, but Steve hadn’t grabbed his shield. He had adorned his suit though, but no shield.
It took ten minutes to get Steve to a state where he could manage to give Tony complete, functional sentences.
She wanted to weep, because she knew if Tony knew that Steve felt the same way for him as he did for that man, he would have a hard time carrying on with their marriage.
It wasn’t unpleasant, not at all. Tony took good care of himself, he had absolutely no hair around his anus, and very little around his cock.
Tony didn’t know how to respond to that. How was he supposed to tell Steve that he saw how broken up he was on the pier, and didn’t want to leave him behind to deal with this grieving process all by himself?
“So, it’s unlike you to have panic attacks, Cap. When did these pop up?” Tony questioned softly, knowing that the blonde would be hesitant in opening up about something so personal, especially with Tony himself.
Morgan had really helped with his happiness, everything their daughter did brought a smile to his face. It also helped that she was so damn intelligent, and would be right up there with her father in a few years time.
“I’m going to stay with her, Steve.” The brunette muttered, feeling his heart ache at the look on the super soldiers face.
Steve himself was halfway hearing the brunette riding him, only capable of watching the bunching muscles of Tony's thighs as he rose up and down.
Sitting up, Steve moved backwards, gripping Tony’s thighs, shuffling him back as well, slotting his ass on Steve’s thighs, reconnecting them.
"I could have lived with that, Tony. But, how am I‌ supposed to do that, when you're sleeping with him as well?"
“Tony. We can’t, not in the compound.” Steve muttered, feeling a streak of guilt run through his stomach.
He’d never forget the surge of complete relief when he saw Tony descend those stairs. After that, his brain kind of went offline. Storming past Pepper, his
“I know. I was-I was being stupid. I was running. I just…God, Steve. You have no idea how hard I could fall for you. It’s,
"Morgan is sleeping. I‌ don't want to wake her with loud whispering, or yelling, alright? We always said we'd never let her hear us argue."
“I chafe.” He whispers against Tony’s cheek as he noses at his collarbone, dragging his tongue over the skin there.
However, Sam, Natasha, and even Clint seemed like they were having a great time, and that made him feel happy and less uneasy.
Tony felt his heart thundering against his ribcage, picturing Pepper and his daughter at their lake house. Clenching his eyes shut, he tried to pull himself away from Steve, telling himself that this was wrong, wanting this man was wrong, loving him when he was married to a wonderful woman, was fucked up.
“When I touch you like this, it’s not to…goad you into something that will screw you over, it’s because I care for you. And I want to see you safe and happy. I’ve been trying for months to show you how much I care for you.”
Steve tried to get back up before the brunette was upon him, pinning him to the gravel, his metal fingers holding him down.
"You know, I was good, just fine looking the other way. I was. It's not a crime to love two people. Sometimes, you just can't help that."
“Maybe Sharena, Ciara, ah, Sharon..”Tony snapped his fingers together pretending to be confused about the name, “maybe she will make you happy.”
“I will carry him, Anthony.” Came Thor’s voice, the taller man moving forward to kneel before Iron Man.
“It’s been wonderful for me too, Pep.” He said, and God she wanted to believe him, truly. But, there was the same pass over his eyes that told her that he needed more.
Landing on a photo of Tony just in a bathing suit, Steve stroked harder, biting his lip, feeling his balls tighten beneath his shaft.
“Why did you do that, you stupid fuck!” Tony was yelling at him, trails of tears streaking his face.
Steve continued, his tongue gliding down the firm muscles and quivering stomach, stopping at the seam of Tony’s pants.
Taking that as the answer he’d be getting for now, Tony sighed and sat back on the ground, sharing the silence with the super soldier.
She laughed humorlessly, wiping her nose, huffing and looking at the wall beside the fireplace mantle.
“And, Pepper will chop off my pecker if I don’t deliver on this. Uh, thanks for the…well, you know, amazing orgasm, Cap.”
Trying to move his finger again, Steve winced at the discomfort that was not leaving the other mans face.
Reaching back, he backhanded Steve across the jaw, startling the super soldier, making him sprawl across the bed.
Letting go suddenly, he turned his back on the brunette, “You need to apologize, Tony.” He grated out, before leaving in a hurry.
God, it made Steve respect Tony’s resourcefulness, and damn stubbornness even more. That man had refused to die out there.
Steve smirked, “Well Tony, there is a thing called public nudity that I really don’t feel like participating in.”
“Tony shouldn’t have had to make that call, to lay himself on the line and sacrifice himself for all of us. For the 50% that I let down. And I did. It was
It was erotic, yet so painful. Because he knew, he knew that Tony was fully out of reach now, and that was…
"I‌ do too, Tony. But, I‌ can't continue to look at you, and see the uncertainty in your eyes, day after day, all the time. It’s
Steve moved his head up and down a few times, twirling his tongue around the tip every time he moved up, drawing gasps and moans from the man above him. Pulling back, he spit in his hand and started to stroke the base of Tony’s dick while he sucked halfway down.
Tony was sitting in the compound dining room, flicking automations on opposite walls, rolling his eyes at some of the research he was looking at.
"It was too late for that a long time ago, Tony. I‌ should've known better. I knew, I knew you were hung up on him."
“I have to, Tony. There’s too much, just…too much here, okay? We’ll get this mission completed, save the world, and…that’ll be it.”
Tony just stared, trying to block out the many nights he laid on his bedroom floor, drinking himself into a stupor, Captain America's shield tucked away in the corner, staring at him as he fell into the abyss.
has been so good for me, right? It's been nothing but calm seas when it comes to Steve Rogers. Always there for me, not questioning me over everything. Not ever discounting my loyalty to the team. Always trusting me, telling me about my parents. Man, he did a great job with all of that."
The blonde pulled away, fumbling for the oil on the bed again, watching as Tony’s entrance clenched and unclenched.
But, she also knew that he needed to be needed in this world, in order to find some kind of peace. He still found himself to blame over Stark Industries weapon making, and the deaths that followed because of the dirty deals.
“Where are the coffee beans in this place?” Tony snapped, trying to remember where they used to be located.
The brunette called on more of the suit, only having his forearms covered, and he grabbed Steve’s hands as they came at him once again.
“Fuck!” Tony yelled, his fingers digging into Steve’s shoulders, hips bucking helplessly as another, intense orgasm washed through him, steeling all his sense with it.
And it wasn’t because Tony didn’t love Pepper, she knew he did. He had told her time and time again, but there was always something she couldn’t put her finger on, something that she was missing that he wasn’t giving.
Tony lifted his head back, gasping at the fullness, listening to the gasps and sighs that left the man beneath him.
"I pushed back my feelings for him once, I can do it again." He responded, firmly, raising his eyes to hers in almost determination.
“Well worth it lovey, you have an amazing backside. You know, when we first met each other, my eyes were very drawn to it.”
“W-Well, never would have figured that with Captain America. I-I half expected to find tighty wighties to be perfectly honest.”
“Woah, hold up there, Cap. Unlike you, you know human perfection, I’m a mere mortal, and I don’t look as good as you with said shirt off my body. So, could I leave it on perhaps?”
Jarvis, the AI, had helped him, guiding him through boxes and boxes of old family stuff on the bottom floor.
“He didn’t want to involve you, yet he carried that absurd flip phone around with him everywhere. I daresay he even had it when he was running with his fiancee, Ms. Potts.”
Steve tensed up, but didn’t try to shove Tony off, if anything, he pulled him closer by the upper arms.
"I think it would be wise if we told Morgan a little bit further down the road. When we have everything figured out." Pepper muttered.
Shaking his head, Tony felt his shoulders hunch in, watching as Pepper wiped more tears off her face.
“Shit. Tony. I have to tell you. When I saw your new bleeding edge armor, Oh Christ, that night I laid in my bed and jerked off twice.”
Smiling, Steve jammed his hand inside the gauntlet, feeling fire and electricity race themselves through his limbs, chest and mind.
Shaking his head, he shoved those thoughts away, continuing his pleasure, the pictures breaking his heart, yet completing him.
“Pepper has always been there for me. Even before I was Iron Man. And I go and do this. I really am the most selfish motherfucker to ever walk this earth. Nothing is ever enough.”
"Oh please, I could find many men with a dick like yours." Tony gasped down at Steve, leaning forward to sneer in his face.
Suddenly, the lights were turning down and Steve was shoving his hand in his stretch pants, grasping his cock.
“Sleep? There is no sleeping for me right now. Not after…” Closing his eyes, he willed back his tears again.
Steve huffed but clenched his fingers into the bed sheets, watching as Tony settled his weight on Steve's hips.
Reaching up, he grabbed a hold of Steve’s shirt and threw him away from his person, watching as the blonde fell over the fallen equipment.
Pulling back, in one go, he smashed his fist against the bag, watching in near glee, as it flew off the chain and smashed into the opposite wall.
"Not just like that, Tony! But, I'm not enough for you! Don't you think it's better to end this with a whisper, instead of with a scream? And it will, in due time. Because like it or not Tony, you know I'm right and that we just,
“Eh, no problem. I brought a super model here once, she loved it too. Well, I suppose she did, if her performance afterward was anything to go by.”
Tony raised a hand to stop him from continuing. “We are fixing this problem, right now.” He pressed the StarkPhone into Steve’s hand and was about to reach for the iPhone when a new concern popped into his mind. “You don’t have anything of value on that right? You probably don’t, since you haven’t even had this thing for a month yet, so I’m assuming you won’t mind replacing it with this much better device.
“That’s all you’ll need to know for now, at least until you get used to this,” she said. “I think you should read up on the advancement of technology before we start on the laptop, though.”
I admit that most of this was written during times I should have been studying... Whoops. I might've also angsted over the characterization of basically everyone but I think the result was worth it. Thanks again to my lovely beta for enduring all my questions XD
Steve stood stiff and still, his gaze never wavering as he held Fury’s eyes. “With all due respect, sir,” he started, knowing that Fury must have known anything beginning with such a phrase would traditionally be disrespectful or rejective, “I may be a soldier, but we are not at war. I’d like some time to . . . to make New York my home again.”
Later into the evening, when the crowd had gone, Steve stepped out from behind the counter to clean up the nearest tables. Natasha had switched with Clint mid-afternoon and was currently organizing their cups and other materials. Steve had asked earlier whether it was okay for them to be staying with him at the coffee shop instead of doing their S.H.I.E.L.D. work, but she’d assured him that a) they had the time and were not dealing with anything of stronger urgency, and b) Steve was of high enough priority to occupy their time.
Bucky had scowled, shrugged off his coat, then proceeded to drape it over Steve’s shoulders. The weather had been mild and rather sunny that day, but Steve had begun to shiver from the wind and had been grateful for the offering, even if—
“Nope, no, none of that,” Tony interrupted. “Mr. Stark was my father. It’s just Tony. And speaking of which—”
? That sounded like weird slang to describe making eyes at someone, and Steve hoped to God that she wasn’t about to teach him to do that. However, when Natasha opened the other box and showed him a device smaller than his palm, he knew there was a lot more he needed to learn.
, which was honestly one of the most awful coffee puns Steve had ever heard. According to Natasha, it was a small café in midtown Manhattan that received regular customers and brewed a variety of authentic, good coffee for a comparatively cheap price. Considering that where Steve came from, coffee had costed a nickel per cup, he wasn’t seeing anything cheap about it.
Steve began without holding back. He channeled all his strength into his fists and each punch sent the bag swinging a metre away before returning. It was only in this that he found an outlet to his rage, his despair at fate’s betrayal. Why him? Why had the world, or whatever deity governed it, allowed Steve to be thawed from the ice into a time that was not his own? Why couldn’t they have left him dead?
Steve found his gaze constantly straying away from the road in front of him and latching onto advertisements, fast food restaurant signs, and towering skyscrapers. He’d seen his fair share of tall buildings—the Empire State
How had he survived the freezing ocean, trapped without oxygen? Even if the ice had preserved his body somehow, it should have been impossible for his brain to wake after seventy whole years.
“Nat, if you keep doing this, I’m gonna have to reconsider coming to this shop,” Tony complained after begrudgingly drinking a third of the cup. “You could have at least given me something iced.” He knew Natasha wouldn’t agree to make him an actually cup of coffee—she and Pepper were teaming up against him, he was sure.
Steve remembered intimately the last time he’d been in Central Park. Although the view was different, there was no doubt where they were. The memories crashed through his mind in an unstoppable wave, and he took a step into the park, then another, his body moving as if in a trance.
Steve raised his eyebrows at his choice of words and all the implications hidden within them. Other enhanced humans, other malevolent forces that could threaten humanity—and being back in action. “Trying to get me back into the world, sir? It’s barely been a day.”
The silence between them had always been comfortable, not a burden. Steve had turned his head to watch rays of sunlight shine through Bucky’s hair and light up half his face. Passersby had continued to stroll along the path in front of them, but Steve hadn’t noticed anything apart from the body heat radiating from his best friend and the peacefulness in his expression—eyes closed, head tilted up ever-so-slightly, an easy smile on his lips.
The sudden influx of car horns drew Steve’s attention and he tensed as several black vehicles surrounded him.
Natasha pursed her lips. “All right, that’ll make this a little harder. Basically, they condensed the computers that took up half a room in your time to fit inside a more portable device.” She lifted the bottom of the laptop and tapped it twice in demonstration. “Using this, you can access and save files of all kinds, and search for new information on the Internet. I’ll teach you how to log in and use Google later. For now, let’s talk about this.”
It was only once Tony stepped under the warm spray that he realized how exhausted he felt. He hadn’t noticed earlier, while his mind was running a thousand miles a minute to process his ideas and calculations, but his muscles were aching with tension and his eyes burned from overuse. He would’ve done anything for a bed and maybe a burger—but he wasn’t finished, he couldn’t stop yet. He needed coffee.
? Okay, you don’t believe me, that’s fine. Let me show you.” He reached into his back pocket and took out the newest StarkPhone that he’d been fiddling with during his walk from the tower, then leaned across the counter so that the screen was between the two of them. “Here, look . . .”
“Already done, sir. Might I add that Ms. Potts will arriving at nine tomorrow morning, so it would be poor judgment to continue a project tonight. Or to begin one, sir.”
It wasn’t an unreasonable request, in Steve’s opinion. If Fury had come to him with news of an imminent threat, there would have been no question that his answer would be ‘yes.’ But there was no threat, no war, nor anything else that required uncovering the presence of Captain America. So why would he?
Steve’s heart pounded wildly in his chest, his breathing quickening as panic welled inside him. “Break what?”
Steve had rolled his eyes but hadn’t resisted as Bucky pushed him down onto the bench by his shoulders. “Is that your only reason? Jerk.”
“I have a proposal for you, Captain,” Fury said after a beat, during which Steve had not moved a muscle under the director’s observing eye. “How do you feel about joining a team of exceptional individuals as Earth’s defense to external forces?”
And that was the truth, Steve realized, but not all of it. He gave her a once-over, glanced out the window and then at the radio before turning back to her. “Where am I really?”
In Tony’s opinion, he’d walked in at an incredibly opportune time, and by opportune he meant a good moment for him to exercise his expertise.
“Well, Captain, if there is anything you need, you only have to ask.” When Steve glanced back, Fury had rounded the corner of his desk and was taking a seat in his leather chair. “Otherwise, you are free to go. I trust you have a lot to catch up on.”
,” he emphasized when Steve’s frown deepened, “because I have now made it my duty to help you, poor soul, by educating you properly on the wonders of modern technology, which is presently represented by Stark Industries products.”
Steve still seemed a bit in shock, eyes staring down unblinkingly at the screen. It was several moments before he raised his head and, with a sheepish smile, said, “Um, thank you. For explaining all that. Really, I appreciate it, Mr. Stark—”
Contrary to his earlier reluctance, Tony collapsed onto the bed and was asleep within minutes. (Reality proved once again that human beings really should not go without sleep for extended periods of time, for both their own sake and that of people around them.)
He turned in a circle, then another, his eyes scanning over everything again and again although his brain could not keep up with how
True to Fury’s word, two notebooks and a sturdy cloth bag—a pencil case, Steve was informed—that contained HB and 2B pencils, an eraser, and three black pens arrived in Steve’s room shortly before dinner. He ate quickly, deciding he was finished long before he felt full, and spent the rest of his evening curled up against the headboard of his bed, notebook balanced on his knee. Art had always been his one remedy whenever he needed to untangle his mess of emotions. In his sketches, Steve could clear his mind and focus solely upon that which brought him happiness, and there was nothing he needed more after the day’s events.
“The game,” he told her. “It’s from May, nineteen-forty-one. I know ’cause I was there.” He rose from the bed, his eyes never leaving her increasingly anxious expression (hidden behind what he now knew was false confusion, of course) as he stepped towards her. “Now I’m gonna ask you again. Where am I?”
On Sunday night, Steve’s restlessness was worse than usual, and he spent hours staring up at the ceiling as his mind worked relentlessly. It was frightening, to a degree, knowing that once he took this step forward, he would truly be leaving his past life behind. There was no way he could’ve had it back in the first place, but putting himself in a position of this new world and interacting with
Thankfully, Natasha was patient with him. “You see the small letters beside numbers two to zero? If you press each button once after opening the option to text, it’ll input the first letter. Press it twice or three times fast to reach the second and third ones. Then, when you’ve constructed your message, press send.” She sent ‘hi’ to her own number and dug out her phone (also a flip phone, Steve noticed, though it may have been for his benefit) to show that she’d received it.
Also, do you guys think I should write some chapters in Tony's POV? There's so much opportunity if I occasionally use his perspective, but consistency... I'm not sure what I'll do yet :/
This Times Square had what seemed to be coloured television on a far larger scale, covering entire faces of buildings. Advertisements and signs lined every visible surface, many of which he couldn’t recognize or comprehend without the proper context. New Yorkers hustled about without regard for anyone else and Steve noticed distantly how out-of-place he was with his thin T-shirt among all those wearing their jackets.
Tbh this chapter was supposed to be the first meeting between Steve and Tony but the characters had a mind of their own and I somehow got to 3000 words before realizing Tony hadn't been introduced yet lol. My updates unfortunately won't be as quick from now on because school is about to get reallyyyy busy, but I'll try to write whenever I can (I have a habit of stress-writing so I guess we'll see).
Fury waited another moment before speaking. “If that’s your decision, Captain, I will respect it. Your identity has remained secret to the public and S.H.I.E.L.D. has made sure your records remain under tight security. I will make the necessary arrangements.”
Steve shook his head. “Don’t worry about it. Besides, when you put it like that, I’m not sure I’d like to experience it.”
“This is not a decision you need to make today, Cap.” Fury gestured towards the broken punching bag. “I’m sure you still have a lot to process.”
“I´ll pick you up at your room at seven.” The billionaire looked away, almost shyly. “Please don´t embarrass me and wear something better than your usual cargo pants and t-shirt, Rogers!”
“Please do not move until tomorrow.” She still smiled at him. “The phallus is alright. You may see it in a few days but right now you need to rest and recover, Sir.”
“It´s okay,” Tony said calmly. He took the soldier´s hand and gently kissed the fingertips. It made Steve´s skin crawl with arousal.
“I decide if I´m disappointed in you or not,” Steve tried to calm his friend, relaxing the arms he had crossed in front of his upper body. He didn´t want to fight with Tony.
“If they see that I am a trans-man maybe they will find the confidence to be themselves, too. I remember hiding my desire to become a man too well. When Bucky told me it was fine and that he would support me I was incredibly happy. I want that for other people as well.”
“I´m....I´m not... I don´t have...” He stumbled upon the words. He had not had an outing in seventy years. Talking about as if it was something normal was hard.
The intrusion was harsh but once the cockhead was inside taking the rest of the shaft was easy. Steve moaned loudly. He needed a second to check in with himself but the lust was overwhelming, washing away the dysphoria he usually felt about his crotch area.
He woke up only a few hours later when another nurse entered the room to bring him his breakfast. Steve wasn´t feeling hungry but ate it anyway. His body needed the nutrients.
This was pointless. He didn´t even know Steve, if he was being honest. They only ever met once and yes, they had fought a bunch of aliens side by side, but aside from that they weren´t really friends. Hell, Tony was only here because he stalked Steve and assumed he had been woken up by a nightmare. It was completely possible that Steve hated him. He should have never come here in the first place.
Pouting, Tony took another sip from his coffee that probably consisted of more cream than actual coffee.
He opened his mouth trying to make the words come out but for the first seconds he just rambled until his thoughts kept up with his body.
“Nothing unusual, Sir,” his loyal AI responded in this calm voice that was such a harsh contrast to Tony´s own erratic thoughts. “Captain Rogers seemed to have suffered from a nightmare again.”
“I mean it,” Tony tried again. “Take the day off. I promise not to get into any situation that would require your help for a day.”
This morning, they made love and Steve loved every second of it. He loved their deep, filthy kisses, he loved the feeling of Tony thrusting into him, he loved blowing him later in the shower.
“Did you even sleep at all?” The soldier asked pulling Tony closer to place a kiss on his shoulder blade.
Happy entered the club at exactly 2:30 AM. Most people had already gone home, either drunk and alone or with some poor soul to keep them company for the night. Only the lost, desperate or hardcore ones were still left. Men dressed in leather or tight latex shot Happy some looks as he tried to locate the playrooms of the club.
it all felt. It was overwhelming, the lights and images that almost seemed to multiply each time he looked.
Clint’s tone was apologetic and sheepish as he said, “I know it’s only been a few days since you woke up, but you’re gonna have to learn how to use this, fast.” Fortunately, Steve was able to memorize the steps to inputting orders of various kinds and acknowledging coupons, discounts, or specials, thanks to his serum-improved memory.
Natasha seemed to assess his expression for several moments before continuing, “You can save numbers into your phone under people’s names, like this.” She pressed a series of buttons, showing him how to navigate the menu and input a new contact. “I’ve already saved S.H.I.E.L.D.’s, Fury’s, and my own number into your phone in case of emergencies. You can also send us text messages—sort of like telegrams, but you type them in using your keypad—”
If Natasha was surprised, she didn’t show it on her face. Instead, she nodded and gestured towards the park in front of them. “Central Park has experienced its ups and downs, and you’ll notice some changes because of that, but I thought you’d appreciate the greenery.” She hesitated, then added, “I’m sure you don’t need me to remind you that it’ll only hurt to dwell on the past, Steve.”
His comment drew a surprised laugh from Clint, loud enough to attract the attention of the nearest customers. With a firm pat on his shoulder, Clint told him, “Yeah, you’ll fit in just fine, buddy.”
“Got it in one,” Clint answered, which Steve took to mean ‘yes.’ “Can’t really hear well without them—which, I mean, is what they’re there for after all. I had the volume turned down when you guys walked in, so sorry you didn’t get to experience my dramatic welcome.”
been built in his time, after all—but nothing of such modern design. (He used ‘design’ quite loosely because frankly, some of them were downright hideous.)
The director looked most perplexed at the request. “Of course, Captain. They’ll be delivered to your room later today.”
Then, he introduced Steve to the gym. Though the layout and equipment were somewhat unfamiliar, he was endlessly grateful for the punching bags lining the back wall—he would probably end up using them later when he needed to unleash his suppressed emotions. (If you asked Steve, he’d tell you he’d done quite well to hide his frustration from Fury so far.)
and saw Steve again, and by then his memory of him had almost been completely buried by other, more pressing matters. Like, you know, developing the new Iron Man suit and researching nanotechnology (and possibly running his company . . . kind of).
Natasha motioned for Steve to come forward. “Steve, this is Agent Clint Barton, the manchild who happens to know the manager of this shop. He arranged for the three of us to work here part-time while you become accustomed to your new life.”
“This is a flip phone,” she told him, opening the cover to reveal a screen and keypad. “It’s actually quite outdated now, but we’re going to take baby steps here because you obviously need them.” Steve nearly winced but understood her point. “You enter the number you want to call and press the button marked with a green phone symbol. Phone numbers now are ten digits, the first three being an area code based on your state or city.” She paused. “Are you following, Steve?”
Tony sighed and instructed JARVIS to save his plans in a new folder for later. He knew there would be no arguing with Pepper, not when he’d locked himself in for— “JARVIS, what was it again? Sixty hours? That’s not even three days.”
And Steve did, in a sense. However, it was one thing being a skinny kid from Brooklyn trying to serve his country in a war involving three continents of the world. It was something entirely different to join a superhero team to fight aliens—at least, that was what he presumed Fury was trying to say. The question, therefore, came down to how much he was willing to do. For America—and for the world.
Steve’s insides lurched as the announcer continued. That couldn’t be right. He remembered this game from May of 1941, remembered watching it from the stands, hands clenched into fists as he urged,
He thought back to Steve from the coffeeshop and the string that was tied around his right pinky. Tony had been able to see soulmate strings for as long as he could recall, though he’d long since realized it was more of a curse than a blessing. Most people knew of the existence of those strings—crimson red connections between fated companions, romantic or platonic—but whether they believed in them was a different story. Tony, well, he didn’t have a choice.
