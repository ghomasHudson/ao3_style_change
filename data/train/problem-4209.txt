“You could never see my true form,” he said softly, “my former true form. It is inconceivable and unexplainable to the human mind, but believe me when I say… it does not even remotely resemble a human being. Until I lost my Grace, I mostly saw you and all the other humans as souls, some shining, some tainted. I have spent enough time on Earth to be familiar with the human body as well, but I sometimes still have trouble with the concept that you have only two eyes and no wings and exist as a finite, solid shape. Genitals are entirely irrelevant to me.”
Son of a bitch.
“Yes, I think I will accept his offer. Unless, of course, you have further need of me.”
“I do not believe it would,” he stated, “but I don’t understand the purpose.”
“Pleasure to meet you, Danny; I am Castiel,” he replied, because it was the polite thing to do. “Yes, I believe another round of tequila would be just the thing. We are celebrating, you see.”
“I guess I can understand that.” Dean snorted. “I mean, not really because I don’t see myself giving up sex. But I hear you about people thinking you gotta be a certain way when you’re not.” He grinned at Cas, clinked their beer bottles together and that was that.
“Dean did not.” Castiel surmised. “And your father, he placed a lot of importance on having sex with women? Did he impress upon you the idea being a man means not having sex with other men--was he a homophobic?” Sam snorted.
“You are insulting both your intelligence and mine if that is what you are getting out of this conversation,” Castiel hissed, well and truly enraged. “I don’t know why it’s so difficult for you to grasp that your human labels are not going to encompass what I am, or that any physical attraction I feel for anyone is NOTHING compared to everything I feel for you!”
“So you’re panzexual,” offered Sam earnestly, trying to understand. Castiel considered the word.
Don’t make me say it. “I wouldn’t… I’m sorry, I… but you said you don’t mind and I know it’s not like that between us, it’s not going to be a big deal, I swear, I’m not like that and you’re not like that but I just--”
“Well, then.” And he dived back in.
As he garnered from watching television shows, sexual intercourse and dating were another big part of human life. Dean had took it upon himself to give him ‘The Talk’, as he put it, which was about the dangers of transmissible sexual diseases, how to prevent pregnancy and the importance to make sure the woman you wanted to sleep with was unattached before making advances. Dean also took him to buy condoms, one of which had to be put in the wallet next to the money and the documents and the pictures. It was very kind of him, Castiel thought, especially since he seemed to find the entire ordeal even more embarrassing than the deodorant debacle. Castiel did not quite understand, since he had no problems providing him with the exact length and girth of his penis so that Dean could help him fight the right size of condoms, but he found that Dean had trouble looking him in the eye for a while after that.
“That means attractive,” Castiel replied. “Thank you. It’s… thank you.” He did not know what else to say. He found that he liked to be considered attractive. It was a nice feeling. He allowed Danny to suck his penis--with the condom on--and did his best to reciprocate, since it was the right thing to do. Afterwards, Danny laid back on the bed, completely naked.
He felt Cas’s heat under the thin fabric of his shirt and kinda just… held him, which was embarrassing but Dean needed the contact in a visceral, heart wrenching way and couldn’t let go of Cas’s biceps if he tried. He honest to god whimpered when Cas started kissing the side of his neck, his ear, Jesus, yes please, and managed a breathless “Who knew you had moves, Cas,” followed by a rough moan when Cas nibbled his ear.
“You are a very childish man,” Castiel retorted. And thus, the matter was mostly resolved.
“I sure as hell hope not since you were way more than adequate, honestly.” Dean grinned up at Cas, not even feeling too embarrassed at saying this because he figured the dude had just fucked his brains out and deserved a little praise. “Really fucking spectacular, actually.” He wriggled a bit, because in all this Cas’s dick was still hard and heavy inside Dean and, while he didn’t feel as frantic and aching as he did during his Alpha-less Heats, he felt his body readying itself for the next round.
“...I was just trying to fit in, and find release. And I thought you were helping me.”
Until The Heat.
“I don’t want anything from you, Dean!” He too was getting angry now. “I just wanted to be very clear on the fact that I love you, which you should already know since I’ve died for you--twice--and Fell from Heaven for you, and I have joined your quest and your life and follow you everywhere. I did not tell you before because I thought it didn’t even need to be said, but apparently I misjudged your intellectual prowess!”
Shit. Dean had forgotten his ‘avoid eye contact’ policy during their brief argument and now both him and Cas were leaning over the table, elbows planted on the worn wood to push their faces closer, as though proximity would make it easier for them to make their point. And Cas’s eyes were bright and blue and his lips were slightly parted--he was breathing heavily--and for one wild moment Dean thought Cas would punch him and he would fucking welcome it, yeah, a good brawl that’d get their blood up and let them work this weird tension off, that sounded almost as good as sex right now, and Dean had half a mind to goad Cas further. But then his friend exhaled and it was like the fight was punched out of him all of a sudden, and he slumped back into his chair. Dean was unaccountably disappointed.
“Hell, I am too, Sammy. But I just wanna get us out of here so we’ll be safe.”
He sits back down, takes out his textbook and begins reading along in Chapter 11.
“We don’t have any money.”
“Definitely.”
“Dean, do you mean…. what I think you mean?”
“I’ve wanted you since I first saw you. Take me, Alpha.” Dean answers, pushing his ass back against Castiel.
“No problem, man. Gimme a sec and I’ll come out and see if I can’t help you out.”
The heat from Dean’s breath touches Cas’ lips. His cock twitches and starts to swell. A familiar hunger starts to build. He recognizes it as he has felt it before around Dean.
Desperation is clear in Dean’s eyes. He knows full well the slim to none odds are of that plan actually working.
“The price was my life. When I experienced a moment of true happiness, the Empty would be summoned and it would take me forever.” Cas purses his lips together and swallows against the lump in his throat. He can only hope Dean will be able to forgive him for what he’s about to do.
“What do you mean? Where could we go? And why do you have to dress like that to make money?”
“So, uh I guess I should’ve asked if you mind if I call you Cas.” Dean says, a little embarrassed.
Dean figures if he can’t get Castiel off his mind, it’s nobody’s business but his own. He just can’t seem to shake the way their hands felt so right together. The simple act of soft, warm skin to skin contact making his heart beat faster when their hands were joined together. Or the way the setting sun reflected on the water and cast a beautiful glow against Castiel’s pale face. Not to mention all the times Castiel blushed and smiled throughout their night together- every time, making Dean melt.
“Are you in any clubs or anything, Cas?”
“I don’t mind helping either.” Cas offers.
That night when Castiel gets up, Dean is tossing and turning on the couch. It’s hard for him to believe how quickly Charlie seemed to fall asleep on it last night.
Dean sinks into the kiss, Cas shifts them until he is crouching over him.
“He seems like he is getting more excited as it gets closer, but I bet when the time comes he will be nervous too. Our first pup, you know.”
“Yes, just around 3 and a half weeks from now. And honestly, I’m tired.”
It raises its eyebrow. “Regretting your decision?”
Only a few seconds later, the man’s bitter taste is filling Dean’s mouth and he holds it all on his tongue until the man’s dick stops twitching. He lets the softening cock slip from between his lips, then leans his head back opening his mouth wide showing the man his cum. Dean makes the “money” motion with his hand and the man pulls out the full $300, holding it out to Dean. Eyeing the 3 $100 bills in the stranger's hand, he quickly sees it’s the right amount and swallows the load down. Opening his mouth again, he shows the man his now empty mouth. The man moans and Dean takes the money from the man’s hand as he gets up off his knees. “Pleasure doing business with you, darlin’.” Dean says before the man tucks himself back inside his pants and walks away.
Jo punches him square in the jaw as Charlie and Jess continue to hold him still.
Sam couldn’t answer, just stayed in Dean’s arms, face buried against his brother’s chest as he continued to weep helplessly.
“Sorry, I’m late guys. My boss decided to be an ass and make me stay an extra hour.” Benny says as he takes the remaining empty seat between Dean and Anna.
“You really think we can trust him?” Jack asks.
Dean clenches his jaw and stares at Sam silently.
Sam smells her vanilla body spray and lilac shampoo as he holds her close. “I love you, too.” he answers, removing his own shirt.
Walking inside, the place looks empty. However, candles are lit, vacant pews with Bibles and other ancient Holy texts are left open and littering every flat surface.
Cas sighs. “You really don’t wanna talk about it?”
The sky starts to lighten. Dean looks over, moving his hand until it’s covering Cas’. Cas leans in a little, hesitating to allow Dean the option to close the distance between them or not.
“Who was that?” Ruby asks, tossing her blonde hair over her shoulder.
“Sam’s leaving.” Dean says finally, licking his lips. “Like for good.” he gulps, looking back at the floor.
If he’s honest with himself, he hopes for more.
Looking at Cas with major sad puppy dog eyes, Dean hides his face against Cas’ neck.
Castiel puts his head down and feels tears well up in his eyes. His mind reels with everything that had led up to him deciding to ‘Marry Jesus’ as Gabriel had put it.
“I don’t think you’re odd. I think you’re wonderful. Besides, if anyone’s strange, or out of place, it’s me.”
“Hello?”
“Oh, it’s no big deal. I’ve only been here a few minutes.” he lies. It’s actually been about 15.
Unintentionally, Dean responds to each kiss with a small gasp as Cas works his way up to and surrounding his hips and pubic bone. Looking up at him, he takes his lover into his mouth.
Dean and Sam look at each other, communicating wordlessly. Then look back at Chuck.
“Really.” he says, reassuring him.
Dean laughs. “Hell yeah it was enjoyable.” Feeling a little less drained but drowsy now, he climbs up and lays beside Cas again.
Friday came and Dean had already let Bobby know he was leaving work early. When he gets home he showers, realizing as he gets dressed that he is excited about going to Castiel’s house to pick up the pictures for Sam and Eileen. He tries to tell himself he’s only excited about the surprise he has for them, but he can’t deny he’s looking forward to seeing Castiel again.
Cas looks up at him grinning. “Might as well. They’ll figure it out anyway. Beside, Gabe's got a big mouth. I'd be surprised if they all don't ALREADY know.” he says, kissing along Dean’s jaw.
“Everything okay, Cas?” Dean asks.
“Come on, smartass. I gotta leave for work in a few hours. Come get cleaned up with me, then we can go get something to eat.”
Castiel, baffled, realizes he must have missed the joke.
His nerves making his hands shake, follows behind Dean to the other side of town to a modest sized pale yellow house. He parks beside Dean and they both get out. He waits beside his car as Dean comes over to him.
shot. That’s why we can’t afford to screw it up! What good will the plan do us if Chuck finds out what we’re up to?!” Dean insists angrily.
Though Sam went to bed with a warm feeling in his chest, it wasn’t enough to keep the nightmares from returning. To add insult to injury, when he woke up the next morning he found his sheets and comforter were soaking wet. What he sincerely hoped was sweat, in fact wasn’t. Sam was completely humiliated that at 14 years old he had wet his bed.
“Oh, okay. Then, it’s nice to meet you, Bobby.”
Jack looks up to Sam, his face full of regret. His eyes soft. “Sam, I..I’m sorry. I should have told you.”
The first thing he notices is a new text message notification. Assuming it’s from one or the other of his friends, he clicks on it and it’s an unsaved but local number. He unintentionally holds his breath when he reads what it says.
“I never knew humans could know such immense -pleasure.”
“Yeah, it only took him eleven years.” Sam scoffs.
“Yeah. Actually I do.” she says, taking another step to be right in front of the man. She nods to Charlie, and Charlie removes her hand from his crotch and steps back. Anna spits in his face then knees him in the balls.
“I’ve never really been around kids. I mean, yeah I’ve done plenty of photo shoots but those are with older kids. I don’t really know how to interact with babies or like really small children. I feel extremely awkward and...feel embarrassed because it’s blatantly obvious.”
“I’m sorry, babe. I’m not trying to make you feel bad. I just...I want you to meet her.” Dean presses a couple kisses to Cas’ neck.
“Where do you want it baby?” he asks, already grinding against him.
Castiel looks up at the sky and then realizes that Dean is looking at him instead. He blushes and bites his lip.
An hour drags on with nobody stopping to talk to Dean before he finally sees someone eyeing him again.
Dean nods. “Illegal.” he finishes for him.
I went back and edited a little. Some of the wording toward the end of the chapter didn't feel clear. Hope you like it.
“Okay.” Jack answers simply. He looks back at Dean and Cas one last time with his wide child-like smile before turning to follow Sam back to the bunker.
“Not at all.” Castiel answers, scooting over to give him more room.
“What is?”
Dean bites Castiel’s neck sharply, drawing a half groan half moan from him.
“Hopefully later today. If not, then first thing in the morning.” Eileen answers.
“The food okay?” Dean asks.
“I know, Cas. Can we please just…” Dean sighs, “hash this out later?”
“I really do.”
Things that….I want and need and ….feel, that angels were never meant to experience. It should not be possible. My sole purpose- the reason I was made... was to serve heaven. But now...being a part of this family has become my new purpose.”
Charlie gives him a look as she inhales from her cigarette again. “How long you been doin’ this?”
DEAN:
Castiel starts digging through a cardboard box beside the entertainment center and the sight of him bent over makes Dean feel like his eyes are about to pop out of his head. The thin, black, booty shorts don’t leave much to the imagination as Castiel’s firm ass and muscular thighs are on display just a few feet from Dean’s face. A fleeting thought crosses his mind that maybe Castiel is purposely teasing him. Deciding that’s ridiculous, he pushes the thought away.
“Allow me a moment with my brother.” Gabriel says, smiling politely.
She smiles, nods, then quickly hands Jack the incantation, before taking Michael’s hand.
“What’s it about?” Dean asks, not caring much about the answer.
Castiel scoffs quietly. “Apparently not.” he says under his breath and Dean chokes on the sip he was taking of his champagne.
Considering his words, Dean realizes that ‘yeah that seems about the right time frame’. “Yeah, actually.”
The street lights flicker as they pass by.
“Oh yeah? Prove it.” Dean challenges.
Wordlessly, Jack closes his eyes and drops his head forward in frustration, before leaving the room. Sam decides to go with him, leaving Michael alone as he tries to think of another way.
“What?” Sam looks at him confused, then takes a seat at the table.
The remainder of the week, Father Novak is able to turn away stray ‘sinful’ thoughts and feels proud that he seems to be abstaining like he always has before. He serves food at the local homeless shelter, collects the donations for the church and counts it, recording and putting it away in it’s designated place. He schedules a meeting with a contractor to take a look at fixing the church roof where it has begun to leak. All in all, Castiel was pleased with himself. He had successfully gone back to his usual activities.
“Good, I’m glad.” the Alpha says smiling. “That’s good enough for me.” he adds.
“If I tell you, you can’t breathe a word about it to anyone. You got me?” Dean whispers back.
“You can have my share.” Dean tells him, grinning.
Cas smiles, taking Dean’s hands in his, interlacing their fingers together. “What would you like to eat?” he kisses the back of both of Dean’s hands sweetly.
Not knowing anything else to do, Sam starts gathering ingredients and a large bowl, carrying them all to the library.
Bobby frowns and furrows his brow.
A smile spreads across Dean’s face and he lets out the breath he’s been holding. Suddenly realization hits him and he checks the time when Cas sent the text. It had been at 10:37 am. He remembers the disappointed look on Cas’ face when they had talked as Dean was about to leave. ‘Oh fuck! He thinks I was brushing him off. Shit!’ He knows Cas is still at work, but he hurries to text him back so whenever he does go to check his phone he’ll see it.
This time she avoids his mouth, turning her head so that all his lips can reach is her hair.
He stops at the doorway, facing away. “Look, I’m really sor-” he tries again.
With an affirmative nod and a tired rub of his eyes, Castiel agrees quietly,“Yeah, that’s probably a good idea.”
Dean took a deep breath and looked down at the floor before he locked eyes with Cas again.
Dean leans on the bed, meeting Cas’ lips in a tantalizing kiss. “Yeah, maybe.” He kisses him again. “Come with me? Please.” he says, climbing into Cas’ lap.
“Dean, I-”
“But Alpha spray is…” Castiel starts, tilting his head.
Dean presses a soft kiss to Cas’ lips, momentarily forgetting his surroundings. Looking back up, Eileen and Sam both have impossibly wide grins.
Billy walks over to Castiel, hard eyes narrowed like he is coming to execute a punishment. The older man doesn’t even try to hide his scowl as he takes the shot glass from in front of Castiel and disappears into the kitchen.
“Geez. See if I ever make YOU breakfast again.” Dean threatens weakly.
The rest of the day drags by but at last the final bell rings and he meets Sam by the bike rack. They begin walking together heading home and Sam is unusually quiet. “What’s wrong?” Dean asks.
“Tuck her into the crook of your arm. Support her head, and secure your other arm on the other side.” Sam advises, now standing beside him.
“Hey!” Castiel tries to protest. “What the hell?”
“I have to agree,” Cas admits, reluctantly. He gives Jack a look of apology.
“I guess I never really thought about what all you missed out on because you were busy taking care of me. I can’t even remember a time before it was just me and you. Not really. I guess mainly I wanted to say thank you. And to tell you that I wouldn’t be the man I am without you.”
little universe. So, you’ve chosen the Winchesters yet again over me.”
He opens the shirt and pushes it off Cas’ shoulders, neither one caring where it lands. Dean’s eyes explore Cas’ exposed skin, breathing heavily. His eyes are full of passion as he pulls him closer. Dean pulls Cas until his knees are resting on either side of him, sitting right at his erection. Dean runs his hands along Cas’ back and takes in the sight of the Angel on top of him.
The bartender comes over and sets Dean’s drink down in front of him, waiting to get his attention.
Dean takes a deep breath and gulps, silently.
“Yeah, thanks.” Dean adds.
“Oh dear.”
“Got any family, Charlie?”
Patting his back, Gabriel hugs him briefly. “Of course, Cassie. You better get going if you wanna get there before dark.” he adds.
“What can I do for you, Dean?” Castiel signs.
“Well, Anna can I interest you in something a little stronger?” he asks, pointing to the beer in her hand.
Dean walks in, then closes the door behind him. “I’ll be back out in just a minute.” Castiel says disappearing around the corner into the hallway. Dean waits by the front door, walking nervously between the living room and back to the edge of the hallway. There are several various sized framed pictures hanging on the wall of gorgeous nature scenes.
He simply nods. Their lips meet and then Dean eagerly takes Cas’ tongue into his mouth. Cas is tremendously aroused by the burning hot wetness. Dean starts sucking and pulling on it, and whimpering moans escape from Cas that vibrate Dean’s mouth.
“Where are we going?” Jack asks, as he lets Cas lead him away.
Chapter Warnings: running away, fake IDs, underage sex work mention, past trauma implied.
As the ooze begins to spread across Dean’s body, Cas tightly wraps his arms around him, pulling them together. The substance begins to fully cover them both and it’s like acid burning through Cas’ body. He’s unable to keep from crying out in anguish, his wails of torment mix with Dean’s.
who I am. That’s not who
Sam gulps, and looks down at the floor.
A bleach blonde haired boy in the desk to Dean’s left, Jared, looks over at him. *fake cough* Nerd! *fake cough* looking straight at Dean.
Dean:
Jack closes his eyes, seems to be concentrating when a whoosh passes through the air. Suddenly, Jack opens his eyes and looks around and sees people start to appear, just as they were. Completely unaware of any interruption to their lives. People reappear sitting outside at the diner to their left, cars start passing them to their right, people are walking along the sidewalks, and the sound of children’s laughter echoes from the park a few blocks away. The nature sounds are back as well, adding to the feeling of the return to normal. Dean never thought he’d be so glad to hear birds cawing and calling, bees buzzing around flowers and the sound of dogs barking in the distance.
“Not really.”
Dean wakes up, eyes blurry and his head hurts. “Ugh, god my head.”
“Yeah and thanks, I will.” Sam answers, sipping his orange juice.
“What? Of course that’s not what I mean. I know you can certainly handle yourself. You’re a badass hunter, Eileen. I just….got scared when I almost lost you. I don’t know what I’d do if..”
, you have done for
“So, what’s the plan?” Rowena asks, prompting the boys into action.
Castiel puts a hand on his shoulder. “Dean.”
“Oh god, Dean…. I love it when you touch me.”
“Cas?” Sam asks desperately.
Dean jolts up, away from Cas’ touch and calming the butterflies for now. “Yeah, I um...I just need to get out of the house and want to talk to you- alone.”
“That’s why I’m here.” he answers, running the back of his hand along the side of Dean’s face.
“And after we summon him?” Jack asks.
“Yeah, I know what you mean. I know I’m older than dirt, but believe it or not I do still remember what high school was like.” he laughs.
I know how to do!”
Castiel looks up at him seeming surprised. “No.”
“Don’t mind them. You’ll get used to it. They’re almost always like this.” Bobby tells Cas.
Dean sees the pleading in Cas’ eyes and though he doesn’t say the words, Dean hears them regardless…
Dean chuckles nervously, seriously not used to compliments and therefore it’s always hard to accept or process them.
“Uh..yeah. Yeah, I think so.” Castiel finally answers, looking back up at Dean.
Cas chuckles. “It’s hard to kiss when you keep making me smile.”
Dean had started Bobby on the topic of old cars at some point in the last thirty minutes, but Ellen eventually got tired of the two of them droning on and on about engines and what not. "I swear, you could name every car you've ever changed a tire on, but you can't remember my birthday," Ellen teased, snatching the hat from Bobby's head to plant a kiss on top of his thinning hair. When he glared at her, she chuckled and readjusted the hat back where it was before.
“That’s not the job I gave you,” John barked, still smiling despite the malice behind his words.
"Right," Sam answered with a knowing smirk. Dean ignored it, instead playing innocent. "I'm sure if it were anything serious, Cas would take care of you," he added with a stifled laugh.
Cas jumped in for Dean, thankfully, and came up with something to get Dean off the hook. “He was telling me about his date,” Cas supplied, as Charlie narrowed her eyes suspiciously. Dean was starting to regain his senses, enough to sit up a little. “I don’t think it’s more important than Dean’s health, but he wanted to tell me how it didn’t go as planned. I am his closest friend, after all, so he always confides in me.”
"I'm heading over to the medical building so I can try to get this thing off my arm. Cas and Charlie will be there and I'm sure they'll be great help coming up with a plan," he offered, soothing a hand through her hair as she seemed to be calming down. "You wanna come with?" he asked, dropping his hand to her shoulder as she put a little space between the two of them.
Dean’s chest tightened at the thought of Charlie being taken by John, treated the same way he tortured Kaia. All he could see was red. He didn’t even wait for Sam to start walking, or for Crowley to disappear again. He took off at a run, following the same trail John took to get home. He had to get there before John took her away. Charlie was with Cas and Jo, so they were in danger too.
Dean groaned, rolling his eyes. "Docile? Really?" he grumbled, watching Charlie smirk. He glared at her. "What?" he snapped.
"Shut up, yes it is," Jo countered, narrowing her eyes at him. "If I'm going to piss off John Winchester by cancelling dinner, it better be because you're getting dicked down by your hot boyfriend!" Dean was incredibly scared that people were going to hear her, but he didn't see anyone walking around. It was still too early in the morning, thankfully.
"Sorry," Dean exhaled slowly, running his hand down the middle of Cas' sternum, reveling in the strong muscles of the man's torso. Before he could get too swept away in just touching Castiel's chest- how pathetic, by the way- he worked up the nerve to get his hand in Cas' pants, working them down enough to free his leaking cock. For a second, Dean wrapped his fingers around it, just admiring the sight of Cas so hard for him, a proud sensation knowing he turned Cas on just as much as Cas turned him on.
Cas swallowed visibly, slowly nodding his head. "Okay," he whispered. "I won't go anywhere."
Dean swallowed down his nerves. “Dad, come on,” Dean pushed, refusing to break eye contact even though he felt like throwing up. “You know something. Kaia wouldn’t leave her friends behind without so much as a goodbye. If you know what happened to her-”
“I’m not!” he defended himself, but that was about all he could think of to respond with.
Before long, they were piled into the Impala with all of their belongings, following behind the truck leading them to god knows where. Dean almost wished Cas was sitting shotgun because that hand holding stuff for emotional wounds really sounded good at that moment. His head was somewhere else completely as he drove down the highway. Sam mentioned their dad and it brought back a lot of repressed feelings and memories, things Dean thought would be locked away forever after they lost John.
“Deal,” Dean answered, with no hesitation. He didn’t want to keep Bobby out of the loop anyways, but they couldn’t exactly tell him what they were up to at that very moment. “I think I heard the front door. Let’s go,” Dean said suddenly at the sound of the front door slamming shut.
"Talk?" Dean offered, regretting the word the second it left his mouth. Of course he loved talking to Cas and learning things about him, but talking also meant Dean had to open up and everyone knew how that usually went.
"Fuck, Cas, how are you so good at this- you've never even done this before, have you?" Dean groaned, his words breathy as he cried out a curse word between every few words.
“But Charlie asked-”
Cas cocked his head to the side, clearly confused. Dean had to smile. "Of course I love you, Dean, but what are you talking about? What's going on?"
“Cas,” he mumbled, turning around so quickly that it caused Cas to stumble backwards a little, barely catching himself as Dean latched onto him with his one arm, burying his face in Castiel’s neck to hide the tears.
"Okay," Cas mumbled, his fingers digging into Dean's thighs anxiously.
Cas stirred in his sleep, but his eyes stayed firmly shut. Dean sighed, the sound of snarling hellhounds outside the door forcing him to his feet. He found the paper in his pocket with the spell to summon Crowley and quickly grabbed the bag with all of the ingredients. After dumping them all out of the bag and onto the floor in front of him, Dean started mixing them in the large bowl Charlie threw in the bag. He didn't get more than halfway into the mixing when the door began to shake. The familiar sound of growling and snapping meant Dean was about to have to fight a hellhound.
"Come on, Cas, you know I hate the compliments," Dean mumbled, blushing as he hid his face against Cas' chest. "Can we go back to kissing?"
"It'll be awesome, Dean," Charlie promised. "You get to spend time with your three favorite people!"
A few seconds later, Castiel appeared in the doorway from the other side of the house, raising an eyebrow. "What did you say?" he asked, and that was the moment his eyes landed on Dean, and Dean was already looking at him, so it was very apparent that the angel was freaking out. "D-Dean?! What the hell happened?"
“And I, you,” Cas whispered, leaning into Dean’s touch for a moment before pulling away reluctantly. “I love you.”
"Jody's great," he said, playing along. "We went on a supply run with her daughter, Claire, and some guy named Garth. He's a little. . . strange. Still, it wasn't bad at all. Jody told me more about the neighborhood and the kind of creatures they'd been up against lately. You know how much I love lore, and Jody had a lot to share. Even Claire opened up a little bit." Dean watched him, the enthusiasm in his voice, and saw for the first time in a long time that his brother was happy. Sam Winchester, the boy who Dean tried to protect his entire life, who still got just as fucked up as Dean did, was happy for once in his life.
“I’m in charge around here, Dean. You don’t get to tell me when to leave. Once we’ve finished this conversation, I’ll think about letting you stay.” His voice had calmed back down to a slight growl, still seething from Cas’ interruption. Cas had moved farther into the room a few steps, watching them carefully. Dean really wished he had just left the room when Dean asked. “Tell me you aren’t just using Jo to cover your own ass, Dean,” he said, directing his scowl at Cas until Dean cleared his throat to get his father’s attention.
Dean felt his face flush at Jack's observation. "Yeah, I guess," Dean agreed, because there was no denying it.
"Dean?" Cas' voice startled him, the knife in his hand clattering to the floor. Dean sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose before turning around to face the angel. "Sorry, I thought you heard me come inside," Cas apologized, taking a couple steps closer, kneeling to pick up the discarded knife at Dean's feet. He handed it back, waiting for Dean's fingers to wrap around the hilt before dropping his hands back to his sides. "Jack was asking about you. He's worried because you've been quiet since yesterday after you saw that vampire."
As if on cue, Claire came into the room, her face red and splotchy, along with red eyes from crying. "I heard you guys say it's time to go," she explained, casting a longing glance back at the room Kaia was in. "I'll come back after work, but you'll stay by her side all day, right?" she asked, looking between Cas and Charlie worriedly.
"We heard a gunshot," John said, eyes traveling to Dean's bloody arm. "What the hell happened?" he demanded, replacing Jo as Dean's crutch, forcing the girl to Bobby's side.
"I don't have any food," Cas blurted out, suddenly embarrassed. He really didn't think Dean wanted to eat expired chicken nuggets, so he didn't have anything else to offer since he hadn't been to the store.
"I felt guilty," Sam admitted, laying his cards face down on the table. Neither of them were really into the game anymore anyways, but Dean still held his, using them to occupy his shaking hand. "The past ten years, I thought he was dead. The last thing I said to him was 'fuck you, dad. I'm never coming back' so that ate away at me. Then we found him and I thought I could make things right. But he hasn't changed."
"Anything?" Sam asked, defeated.
Dean groaned, staring up at the ceiling as he frustratedly pulled his hair. "Cas, that still doesn't explain why-" he cut himself off, knowing that tone would get him nowhere. He took a deep breath, looking at Cas again, giving him a pointed look. "Dude, you can't sleep on the floor when you have a bed, okay? First, it's not good for you. That has to kill your back. Second, there's a reason I let you have the room. It's so you could finally get a good night's sleep in a real bed. Don't take that for granted, man." He could tell none of this was getting through to Cas, but he said it anyways.
"What are you doing here?" she asked finally, shoving her book to the side to hide the contents out of sight. She folded her hands in her lap, still eyeing him suspiciously. "Did you dad send you?" The tone in her voice was harsh and accusing and it only furthered Dean's assumption that John had something to do with this.
Before Dean could process the situation, Cas stepped in front of him, his hands curled into fists at his sides. “What do you want from Dean?” he asked, an edge to his voice that Dean had only heard a handful of times when Cas argued with John. It seemed like there was something between these two, like they knew each other, but Dean didn’t think that could actually be possible. This man was a stranger, just some asshole who could possibly be a monster or something.
“Nope,” Dean answered with a sigh. “I wish I could’ve gotten closer. I need to know what they offered Crowley.”
“I can tell them,” she finally spoke, her voice small. Cas shoved his papers to the side, giving Claire his full attention. Charlie leaned forward, her elbows resting on Dean’s bed as she, too, gave Claire all of her attention. Claire looked at Dean, unsure, but he smiled and urged her to continue. “Dean and I need your help coming up with a plan to get my girlfriend back. She disappeared two days ago and I know she wouldn’t just leave me without saying goodbye, so she’s out there somewhere. She’s probably terrified, so we have to find her.” Claire’s voice wavered, but Dean was just proud of her for talking about it in the first place. He knew if he were in her place, having to tell people that Cas was missing and no one knew where he was, he’d either be crying his eyes out like a big baby, or out there killing things. Claire was much more put together than he would be.
“I’m not worried,” Dean cut him off, looking Cas in the eyes. Cas didn’t move, staring back at Dean with a knowing expression. “I’m fucking pissed.” It wasn’t towards Cas, and he knew that, so Dean didn’t have to explain it to him. Cas understood and he seemed to want to help, but nothing would make Dean feel better until he either got to punch John in his stupid face, or they got Kaia back safe and unharmed.
“Fine,” Sam said through his teeth, moving closer to the side of the house before crouching down so Dean could get on his shoulders. They used to do this a lot as kids, but Dean was the one who held Sammy on his shoulders. They’d sneak into abandoned houses to get away from John, or sneak back into the motels they were staying at after John was asleep. Back then, Sam wasn’t taller than Dean.
Dean realized Cas was latched onto him tightly, his knuckles turning white as their hands practically melded together. Dean wanted to wrap him in a tight hug, but he physically couldn't, and he wasn't sure that would have been a good idea anyways. "So he just took your power away? How could he even manage that?" Dean asked, curiosity overtaking him. He was eager to learn anything and everything about Cas, about how he inevitably ended up in Dean's life.
Since he hadn’t been sleeping much, Dean laid awake in bed for a couple hours as Cas snored with his head on Dean’s chest. Dean kept thinking about John, about how to get rid of him. The light of morning poured through the window, but Dean had been awake since the sun had just started rising. He didn’t want to wake Cas, so he just laid there, sometimes watching Cas, sometimes staring at the ceiling. He couldn’t fall back asleep as much as he tried, too many thoughts racing through his head.
"I'm sure it is," Cas hummed, eyes darting to Dean's, holding his gaze. "Dean, we should let Jack settle into his new room. Come on," he insisted, throwing Jack one last smile as he left the doorway, Dean following behind him without a complaint. He wasn't sure why he was following Cas when all of his things were still in the living room where he planned on sleeping, but he still let Cas lead him down the hall, past the room where Sam was currently laying in his own bed, most likely napping. The last room at the end of the hall was the only unclaimed room and Cas pushed the door open, letting Dean walk past him into the middle of the room before the door was closed behind them.
"Hey, dad," Dean greeted, standing up to greet him. "Sam and Jack are still asleep, but I can wake them," he added, remembering that John was giving them a tour today.
Sam and Jack still had to work that day, so Dean was alone for the majority of the day. He looked around the rooms to see if maybe Cas had crashed in Jack's bed or something, but the angel was gone. With nothing to do, Dean grabbed a book and settled in on the couch to start reading. He tried not to think about Cas, or his upcoming date in just a few hours. He tried to focus all of his energy on finishing this stupid book that he'd already read about a hundred times.
As Dean moved to sit on the couch, resting his arm on Cas' pillow, Sam followed and sat in the recliner across from him. "Hey, have you been sleeping alright?" Sam asked out of nowhere, the question catching Dean off guard. He studied Sam's face, trying to gauge how much he knew, if anything at all. Sam looked completely innocent, unknowing even, so Dean figured he was just being dramatic. Sam was only being a concerned brother.
“Jack is fine,” Dean snapped, getting the attention off of Cas. “Forget about Cas and Jack. You and I need to have a talk about the girl you tortured and left in the middle of the woods.”
"Funny," Charlie laughed, shoving Dean to the side as she slid into the seat. "When you guys said I'd be playing the winner, I assumed it would be you, Dean. Considering how often you brag about being the best," she jabbed at him, making Dean scowl and roll his eyes. Cas had teased him about losing too, but at least he'd been cute about it. Charlie was just being mean, like how Sam used to be when he'd beat Dean at anything growing up.
Dean glanced at the angel for only a moment, just to gauge how he was feeling. The expression on his face was hard to read, but Dean thought it was mostly sympathetic. He was listening to Dean eagerly, drinking in the information Dean would never tell anyone else. "Yeah," Dean croaked, giving a small nod. "He became a different person. We spent our whole lives looking for the thing that killed mom, hunting everything else along the way. I raised Sammy in dirty motel rooms while dad was off killing monsters. I had to answer all of the hard questions from Sam. I had to explain to him why we moved schools so much, why dad was hardly ever around, why we had to sleep with guns under our pillows. I took care of him, Cas. Me, not John."
"I’m your dad- it’s kinda my job to worry. But it’s also my job to try to keep you safe, and to try to help guide you, while you’re growing up. I’m worried about you, Sam. And not just about the drinkin’ and the fact that you never showed up at the library yesterday and were out all night. Have you been taking your meds? And still doing your journaling, like you’re supposed to?”
***********************************
“NOT that he NEEDS a reason.” Bobby quickly amends.
“I have an idea.” Dean tells Cas, with a mischievous grin. Dean calls Sam and tells him that he and Cas will be back sometime tomorrow.
did I wake up? The Empty said before, that nothing ever wakes up and well... last time it was Jack. Do you think he did it again?”
“I’m sorry to say that it wouldn’t change anything,” Walter explains.
“He seems nice.”
“The Empty came to get Cas and...Dean tried to save him. So, it took them both. That’s why the location spell didn’t work.” Jack answers.
Dean is shaking now, struggling to breathe, hand covering his own mouth. He never thought he’d ever hate someone as much as he hates his father, but Cas’ parents have now effectively been added to the list.
“Fuck you.” Castiel says shaking his head.
A few seconds later, Dean’s face crashes into the brick wall. “Who the hell do you think you are, FAGGOT?!” Jared shouts, holding Dean’s face against the hard surface.
“Well here. Let me grab you a drink, on me. Kentucky Whiskey, right?”
“I told you, he’s a really decent guy.” Sam signs to Eileen.
“You have GOT to find a better word for that.” Dean says chuckling. “But yeah. Do you have those type of urges still?” he asks.
Dean feels Cas spread his legs beneath him and he sinks between his thighs. The touch of skin against skin is electric, pumping fire through his veins. He kisses him again. “Do you want me?” he asks, mouth against his lips.
For a few minutes, they both stare out at the horizon not speaking.
“I’m ALWAYS nice.” Dean protests.
School lets out for summer and Dean can’t help but continue to be on high alert. So far there hasn’t been any more signs of John. Dean had convinced himself he’d never see the bastard again, only to find out that for some reason after 8 years of no contact the man up and decided his kids would be willing to just ‘forgive and forget’. Ever since John showed up at Bobby’s house a few months ago, Sam’s nightmares and panic attacks have started up again. He’s even had to go back on medication. Poor kid is embarrassed because sometimes the nightmares get so bad, he ends up wetting the bed. Of course, Dean and Bobby never speak about it, they just help Sam get cleaned up and change his bedding.
Gabriel looks at his phone before shaking his head and laying it on the coffee table.
“Hey, c’mon man, you know that’s not true.”
Castiel shrugs. “Not really. We all just kind of go there whenever. Some days, like yesterday we all made a plan to be there and then have dinner later. Why do you ask?”
“I’m sure it was really tough for him to overcome whatever issues that have been holding him back all this time. You gotta remember, Dean didn’t exactly have the same childhood you did.”
“When your grace touched me, I felt it too-The full on pleasure.”
Jack stares at his phone, wordlessly for several seconds before shaking his head. “It went straight to voicemail,” he finally answers.
“Yeah, please Cas let me fuck you.” Dean begs.
______________________________________________________________
Dean can’t help but smile wide as his heart flutters at the feeling of Castiel’s hand in his again. “I’d like that.”
“So, hey do you mind if Cas has supper with us tonight?”
“Of course I will.” Cas answers, wrapping one arm around Dean’s waist, caressing Dean’s bottom lip with the thumb of his other hand.
“Please, Cas” he says, tenderly caressing his cheek. “Don’t ever leave me again.” Dean pleads. “I don’t wanna live in a world that doesn’t have you in it.”
“No, I just ...wanted to let you know it’s...been a while for me.” Cas says, turning over to face Dean.
“Of course.” Dean answers, grinning a little.
“I need you, Cas.” Dean says, bringing his hand to caress the priest’s cheek. “I can’t stop thinking about you.” he adds, pressing his body fully against Castiel’s and pressing gentle kisses against his neck and jaw.
“I’m not really a ‘library’ type of girl.”
Sam grins and promptly turns his attention to the tv.
“Do you enjoy my company?” He adds.
“So, the next reaper to die takes her spot right?”
Sam sighs, flexing his jaw. “Of course he did.” he walks toward her. “Look, Eileen, I’m not sure what all Dean said, but I didn’t know anything about him contacting you. I swear. You said you need space and I’m completely fine with that.”
Please let me know if I've missed anything that needs to be mentioned here.
“Ah. Well, as long as he’s good to ya and he makes you happy...that’s all that matters.”
“Alright, well are you gonna tell me somethin’ or do you expect me to guess?” Dean asks, adding butter to the skillet then a slice of bread.
“South Dakota.” Dean answers nervously.
It hits Castiel that he just trusted him with that more than he’s trusted assumingly other people he has known for longer than 2 weeks. He sits down in one of the chairs, not saying a word.
“Yep.”
worthless. That you deserve to
“I’m sure Meg told you, but help yourself to any food or anything we have and make yourself at home. All I ask is you stay out of my bedroom. Everything else we’re willing to share with you all.”
“Yeah.”
“Doesn’t change what?”
“I see. I’m very sorry to hear that, sir. Let me go check on your order and I’ll be back shortly.” he says, walking away.
, right?”
Eileen’s moans get louder and her breath quickens. Sam switches again from his fingers to his tongue again. This time, he’s lapping and licking into her more roughly and as deep as he possibly can. Fucking her with his tongue and determined to make her cum.
Cas has one arm around Dean’s back, while the other hand roams down until it lands firmly against his ass.
Castiel is standing beside the driver’s side door to the impala. His hands are full, holding two drink cups and a brown paper fast food bag. He smiles, as he sees Dean notice him. “Hey stranger.”
Dean sees someone standing at the register, so he quickly makes his way over. He’s surprised and more than a little let down when he realizes it’s Castiel. He makes his best attempt to fake a smile anyway.
The problem, as it often is in his life, is Cas. Cas and his stupid coat. In theory, the coat isn’t bad; it gives Cas an air of importance and mystery and all that. In practice though, the thing is so big and shapeless that it does the guy a big disservice, in Dean’s completely impartial and objective opinion. In all the years he’s known Cas, he’s seen his friend’s chest maybe a handful of times, and usually in situations when they were too busy fighting for their lives for him to get a really good look, but he’s seen enough to suspect that Cas might be hiding some serious goods under there. He might even be ripped. But all of that is largely conjecture because Cas never takes the damn coat off.
He blinks his eyes open lazily, world thoroughly rocked. Beside him, Cas is sheepishly wiping his hand with leftover paper napkins from their earlier snackfest. Dean watches him ball up the napkins and stand up and his brain struggles online.
“No,” said Castiel, firm but gentle. “Dean, listen to me. You are going to drink some more water and we are going to sleep, and tomorrow we can resume this… very interesting conversation.” He punctuated these last words with a roll of his hips against Dean’s and was gratified when Dean stifled another moan in response.
“You, ah, still need a new coat,” his friend said, glancing towards the battered, frayed trench coat Castiel still wore. “I think I saw something you’d like over there.”
“Only you, Cas,” Dean said, which wasn’t a proper answer but he had a smile hidden in his eyes and didn’t stop him from putting his new socks in the cart, which Castiel counted as a success. The whole process seemed to become easier; he selected a pair of blue jeans--because Dean insisted he needed to own jeans--and a pair of grey joggers, since he’d anticipated the need to run. They went back to the t-shirts and this time Castiel did take the white one he had been eyeing earlier, as well as a purple t-shirt that had the sentence ‘Good Girls go to Heaven, Bad Girls Go Backstage’ on it, which he found humorous relating to his peculiar situation, in spite of Dean’s protestation. He also got a soft green sweater and a purple button-down cotton shirt, for chillier weather. He still needed something to complete his FBI Agent outfit, so he took a pair of formal shoes and a tie--not hesitating even a little as he picked a blue tie, like the one Jimmy Novak had worn.
Dean roped Castiel into doing tequila, salt and lemon shots, and as Castiel licked the salt off his hand he saw that the bartender was staring at the movement of his tongue. He was a young man, in his mid-twenties perhaps, blond and lightly freckled. He had two dragons tattooed on his exposed biceps. The bartender leaned over the counter after Castiel had downed his liquor without coughing.
“Dude. Get comfortable, we’re going to be stuck together for like half an hour,” Dean said, not looking him in the eye. He made short work of the shirt and threw it on the floor. Cas was surprisingly ripped and Dean suppressed a groan. Don’t make this weird, don’t make this weird, don’t make…
“So, Dean is uncomfortable at the thought of men sleeping with other men because it threatens his concept of masculinity. I think I understand that.” Castiel said. “But I do not understand why it should affect him at all that I do it. If a man expressed interested in him I would understand, but why is he so concerned about me?” He asked. Sam’s whole face furrowed, like he wanted to say something but did not want to say at the same time. Castiel stared at him, frustrated.
“I assure you I am going to do all that is in my power to stay alive,” Castiel said, because he didn’t know what else to do.
“He is attracted to me, yes.” Castiel answered. “He has invited me to meet him later for a sexual encounter.” Dean’s fingers clenched around his glass.
“Just… hold your horses, cowboy.” Dean whispered. “I know I’m irresistible, but we’ve got the time.” He tried for a smirk, but it came out more like a fond smile as an overwhelming wave of affection washed over him and almost knocked his breath out. Cas crowded him again, kissing him with abandon, making a small noise of triumph when Dean’s belt finally fell open and he could close his hand around Dean’s hard-on. “Fuck!” Dean arched into the touch, knocking his head into the car window. Cas slid his free hand over the bump, between Dean’s skull and the glass, and started to jerk him roughly, fast and dirty, and Dean would have commented on his impatience again except it felt so unbearably good, he’d lost all capacity for words. It was all he could do to reach for Cas’s crotch in return, he couldn’t even get Cas’s own pants open but he squeezed his bulge and Cas thrust into his touch enthusiastically and moaned into his mouth so he must have been doing something right. They rocked erratically into each other, with no finesse, no grace--all that mattered was the touch, and the warmth, and the steady squeak-squeak-squeak of the car rocking with them, and Dean couldn’t even spare a thought for the tires or worry that they were going to stain the seats. He fumbled with Cas’s fly, desperate to get his dick out, and he didn’t even care that he was acting like an animal and losing his goddamn mind over a sloppy handjob because it was Cas between his legs, and Cas’s big hand that was cradling his head, keeping him safe and cared for even when they were both out of their fucking minds with lust, and it was Cas jerking his dick like his only purpose in life was to drive Dean mad with pleasure, and so Dean keened and bucked under him and came breathing Cas’s name into his mouth. He was distantly aware of Cas coming, too, of his jizz spattering over Dean’s pant leg and slowly dripping down on the vinyl seat because at some point he had managed to get his fly open, so now they were holding each other, dicks out, curled uncomfortably with their legs bent at odd angles because the backseat really wasn’t big enough for both of them, and it was all Dean didn’t know he wanted. He pressed closer to Cas, breathing him in, kissing his neck again with purpose.
“Best damn sex I’ve ever had.” Dean chastised himself internally. Way to fit the needy Omega stereotype to a T, Winchester. But it was hard to feel bad about it when he saw Cas’s surprised little half-smile.
No more words were needed after that.
It gets worse as Cas gets better, because Dean’s not that much of a perv to be thinking like that when a friend is looking like death warmed over, but when said friend just looks a little sleepy and ruffled, and has maybe shed a couple of layers, going around in shirtsleeves and socks, well. And he just keeps touching things. Dean has had more than one bout of temporary insanity where he picked up the TV remote right after Cas had handled it just to surreptitiously check how it compares to his own hands. Watching Cas carefully clean out a gun is basically pornography at this point. And Dean nearly had a heart attack when he made pancakes and had to witness Cas lick the fucking syrup off his fingers.
After that, it was all pills, suppressants and birth-control, and scent-masking body spray, and dodging lewd comments from knothead Alphas in bars, and Beta and Omega women turning their nose up at him because he apparently wasn’t man enough anymore.
“Yeah, which means you’re gonna grow old and die, or, since you’re my friend, you’re not even gonna get that. You’ll just die horribly and it’ll be my fault.” He pitched forward so that his forehead was resting on Castiel’s knee. Castiel brought a hesitant hand down on the back of Dean’s head, kneading it gently. Dean sighed.
“It, ah. Cas. I--look, it’s not a big deal or anything, okay? We can just, you know, pretend it’s never happened and never mention it again, yeah? Cool. That’s a plan. I’m gonna--”
“I don’t think… I mean, I don’t think it was a conscious thing at all. Like, it’s not like Dad had anything against gay guys or anything. It’s just… I don’t think it ever crossed his mind that they had anything to do with any of us. It was the little things he said, like he was so proud when Dean had all the girls in school after him, or he teased me for having a guy best friend.” Sam shook himself a little, like he was trying to rid himself of an annoying insect.
“I… I don’t know.” Castiel thought about it, absent mindedly rubbing a slice of lemon on his skin. He sprinkled it with salt, drank his tequila, licked. “My Father is… certainly an unique individual.” His voice was slightly rougher on account of the alcohol, and he felt a weight in the pit of his stomach like every time his thoughts turned to his Father.
“Well you thought wrong! What the hell do you want from me?” The violence of his outburst surprised Castiel, and it was quite hurtful, too.
Life went on, as life--especially human life--is wont to do, and Castiel did not seek out Sex much again. He had enjoyed his brief time with Kelly, but most of the times they went out for the night it was tiresome talking to strangers in the hope he would find someone he was interested in, and he usually preferred talking to Dean or Sam, when the latter joined them. Dean did not pressure him to do otherwise, seemingly satisfied that Castiel could now take care of his own sexual needs. They had to have a conversation about masturbation, back in the early days when Castiel had first become human, when Dean had impressed upon him the importance of staying out of sight when the need arose, of doing his best not to make himself heard and to never, ever share his fantasies with the other two. Personally Castiel thought it was a bit hypocritical since Dean often remarked about people he found attractive, but if his friend was uncomfortable it was no hardship for him to keep his own thoughts to himself. Dean also frequently leafed through pornography magazines in plain view, and he took to showing them to Castiel whenever there was a woman on them that he found particularly attractive. Dean, Castiel noticed, seemed to have a penchant for dark haired women who looked sweet and innocent, although he did not like to have that preference pointed out. Humans were still confusing, even now that he was one of them.
“Cas… stay.” He whispered, voice rough. Castiel stayed. He flushed the toilet while Dean grabbed his toothbrush and started cleaning his mouth with the sort of vicious strokes usually reserved for carving up demons. After a while, Castiel wouldn’t have been surprised if his gums were bleeding. They were silent in the fluorescent light of the motel bathroom.
“I suppose you could call me that, yes.”
Quickly pulling a few items out, he dresses and looks down at himself. “Do I look alright?” Cas asks.
“Is that what Jo meant when she said ‘one of us’?” Dean asks.
Castiel chuckles, shaking his head. “It’s definitely been an interesting experience.” he says, downing the rest of his champagne.
‘Does he look disappointed?’ Dean thinks briefly, then shrugs the thought away. ‘Wishful thinking.’ “Well, maybe I’ll see you around sometime.” he offers.
Dean about the deal, did they?” Chuck asks, walking towards them. He glances at Jack with a perverse smile before looking back to Sam again. “The deal Castiel made with the Empty...to save Jack.”
Dean and Cas sit in the waiting room, ignoring the soap operas playing on the tv on the wall. Dean fidgets, going back and forth between looking at his phone and leafing through the same 3 magazines from the table beside his seat. He can’t sit still. Adjusting and re-adjusting in his seat, then he gets up and paces, then comes to sit back down.
He looks around but doesn’t see Cas anywhere. Just as he’s about to panic, a hand softly touched his shoulder. Relief floods his body when he sees Cas standing beside him.
“Would you like to come with me?”
Sneaking a glance back over, Cas sees that she’s still staring. “Geez.” he adds, eyes wide.
Once they get back home, Sam heads upstairs while Dean decides to look around the new house. He's surprised to find there's apparently a guest bedroom, an actual dining room separate from the kitchen, a three car garage and a fenced in full back patio.
“Dean, dd-don’t.” he weakly protests, as he feels the air hit his naked ass and thighs.
“Wow. You have
“I’m just hoping to pass.”
“Not too long.”
Dean grins. “I agree.”
“Yes. Do you want me?”
“I always wondered, ever since I took that burden- that curse,
Sam smiles, pulls a chair over behind him and Dean takes the signal and sits down beside Eileen. Sam carefully takes the baby from Eileen and then transfers her over to her Uncle Dean. He helps to move his arms into the correct, secure hold before letting go. “See, there you go.” He signs and says, stepping back to sit at the foot of Eileen’s bed.
"Hey," Dean cooed, his voice soft, his fingers carding through the hair at the base of Cas' neck. "We're not doing this again. Calm down," Dean whispered. The words sounded condescending, but they weren't. They were sweet and it was Dean's way of trying to help. Cas couldn't catch his breath this time, his chest was too tight. Even looking into Dean's eyes, he couldn't. He just shook his head, the tears pooling in his eyes, falling as he blinked slowly.
He struggled up the steps to Charlie’s door and banged loudly with his heavy boots, unable to free a hand unless he wanted to drop the girl. He tightened his grip on Kaia anxiously, kicking the door again until it flew open to reveal an annoyed Charlie, rubbing the sleep from her eyes.
Dean shoved John to the ground all the way, standing up to stomp his foot on the man’s chest to hold him down, gun still pointed at his face. “Don’t think I won’t fucking shoot you right now. You took Cas and now you’re gonna tell me where he is.”
"Okay," Dean sighed, giving in easily. "Let me change and grab the book. But as soon as you fall asleep, I'm going back to the couch, alright?"
“It’s a long story,” Dean sighed, running his hands over his face as his head pounded. So much had happened today, so many things had gone wrong, he just couldn’t think about what to do, or how to handle this mess. “Did he. . . was he the one who hurt you?” Dean asked, though subconsciously, he already knew the answer. He just hoped Crowley was lying and that John wouldn’t physically beat a teenager, or any innocent person for that matter.
Cas smiled sweetly, his hand finding the small of Dean's back to rub it gently. "No rush, Dean. Whenever you're ready," he assured him. Dean appreciated Cas not trying to rush him, but Dean was serious about telling Sam. He needed to make sure Cas was sleeping and since it was his fault Cas wasn't getting any sleep, he had to fix it. "Now eat your breakfast," Cas added, standing up suddenly. "I'm walking Jack to the kitchen for work if you'd like to join. We're leaving soon."
"I don't know," Dean replied, swallowing down his embarrassment as Cas watched him carefully.
After ten minutes, Dean grew used to Cas' hand in his. The silence between them became comforting, almost like Cas knew Dean didn't want to talk about it. Except, holding Cas' hand was almost better than talking it out, because it said everything they needed to say without actual words. Cas was helping Dean understand that maybe it wasn't his fault when something went wrong. Maybe sometimes, things just got fucked up because that was something that just happened. It wasn't like Dean forgave himself or anything, but he actually was starting to feel better.
"I'm fine, Cas," Dean assured him, using his good arm to push the grabby hands away from his face. "I feel fine." He was still in a lot of pain, but he was able to cover it up well enough and he could lie about it if it made Cas feel better.
"Oh," Charlie answered slowly, sitting back down. "Well you can have him. He's helping Cas cheat anyways," she teased, easing the awkwardness in the room. Charlie was good at that. She was an awkward person herself, but somehow, she made things less awkward. Dean wasn't sure how that even worked, but it did.
"You're supposed to be sleeping," Dean chastised, striding across the length of the room until he was next to the bed. He dropped down onto the mattress, still sitting as he stared at Cas, waiting for him to explain.
Sam glanced at Dean, who didn't really have much to say. He knew they were going to stay anyways. Dad would be heartbroken if they didn't, and besides, they'd be stupid to pass up on this offer. Food and shelter without having to worry about vamps ripping their throats out in their sleep? They hit the jackpot.
Dean watched Ketch talk again, but he couldn’t quite figure out what he was saying this time. “I think he’s talking about the next sacrifice, but I can’t make out the name,” Dean told him, just as Ketch looked up towards the window. Dean sort of panicked and lost his grip on the window, sending him and Sam both toppling to the ground.
"I missed you, Bobby," Dean said, his chest tightening. "I missed having someone to confide in after dad took us away. He fucked me up so bad, it took me two months to tell Cas I liked him. Even now that we're- together, kind of, I still can't tell him how I really feel. I can't stand up to my dad. I can't hold Cas' hand in front of people." He felt the tears well up in his eyes anyways, despite not wanting to cry. He knew talking to Bobby was going to end with him sobbing. He had every intention of opening up to him, telling him about Cas, but he didn't think it would get this far. He sucked in a sharp breath as Bobby watched him, eyes glossy with tears. "Every time I think I can finally be happy, I just hear John's voice in my head from that night. Telling me I'm going to hell, how disgusting I am, how nobody could even love me. . . not even mom, if she were still around." That last bit hurt the worst and it made Dean's heart ache so terribly, he felt it clench and his stomach churned violently.
"Are you okay?" Cas asked, and it was then Dean realized Cas had moved closer, inches between them as Dean reluctantly met his eyes. He felt his heart pounding against his chest like crazy. After two months, he thought these feelings would fade. He thought he'd be able to control his own body. "Your father. . . he seems to have missed you," Cas went on, when Dean didn't answer. They continued holding eye contact, the moment becoming slightly awkward. "But you didn't seem to share that same sentiment," Cas added, hitting it right on the nose.
"You want a distraction?" Dean asked, lips against the nape of Cas' neck, his breath hot and sending shiver's done Castiel's spine.
Dean cleared his throat, tightening his hand around Cas' fingers despite the pain shooting up his arm. "Kaia, this is- um, my boyfriend, Castiel," he introduced him, the word feeling funny coming out of his mouth. He hadn't been in a relationship in over ten years, and he sure as hell never called anyone his boyfriend. Cas felt like more than that anyways, but he didn't want things to get confusing for Kaia, or for himself for that matter.
“I told you I’d be safe out there,” Dean replied, leaning in to kiss him gently. It didn’t last long, but it still made Cas blush when Dean pulled away. “Are you almost done in here? I want to take you somewhere.”
When it was time to head back, Dean couldn’t get away from him fast enough. Now that he had pretty much confirmed John was in on what happened to Kaia, he was even more pissed off and disgusted with the man he used to look up to as his father. Dean just wanted a night free of having to deal with John. He wanted to go find Cas, spend some time alone with the man he loved, and just forget about everything else. As long as Jo pulled through and got dinner cancelled, Dean’s night was looking up.
“That’s what they always say,” she sighed, shoving her hands in her pockets with a sad look on her face. “I bet it’s Charlie, isn’t it? I always see you two giving each other secret looks. I hate to break it to you, but you’re not really her type.”
"Sorry, sorry," Cas breathed, pulling Dean's hand away from his mouth. "I'll be good," he promised, the words leaving his mouth before he could stop them. Dean groaned at those words, his hand pumping faster. Cas wanted to cry out again, but he stopped himself by biting down on his own hand, muffling his moans. Dean grabbed his wrist with the hand that had been holding his waist, pulling it away from Cas' mouth. Instead, he slipped his own two fingers into Cas' mouth, quieting him down effectively.
"Thanks, Charlie," Dean mumbled, giving her a grateful look as she beamed up at him. "I've never been good at apologizing or communicating. Never had much of a reason to, but I guess now's as good a time as any to learn, right?"
Dean sat up with a groan, glancing at the front door where Charlie stood, wearing a casual t-shirt with a Star Wars logo on it and a pair of faded jeans. Dean gave her a smile, which she returned with an excited little wave. "I'll go wake them up," Dean promised, stretching his arms across his chest. "Just wait here with Charlie. I'll only be a minute."
"You make a fair point," Dean agreed, shamelessly. He wasn't necessarily trying to make friends here, but she seemed decent enough. Not as bright and positive as Charlie, but not as scary and unwelcoming as the teenager, Claire. Dean had only run into her one other time since they first met and it wasn't a pleasant interaction.
Dean stared at his feet as he shook his head, trying to reel in his anger and keep it from hurting anyone but the intended target. “Trust me, the son of a bitch who took him. . . he ain’t gonna be alive much longer.” Dean gave Ellen a stiff smile and pushed his chair in, giving Sam a small wave towards the door. “Give Bobby that message. Stay inside the wall. Everything’s gonna be fine!”
"I'll be in the living room doing crosswords if you need me," she said with a small wave, leaving them alone in the kitchen.
Dean wanted to say it back. He opened his mouth to say the words, right on the tip of his tongue, but he never got the chance. A frantic banging on the front door ended the moment quick, bringing both Dean and Cas to their feet. Dean gave Cas a guilty look and Cas smiled back, wiping his tears away as Dean moved across the room to open the door. Jo stood on the other side, looking extremely distraught and upset.

"How's the arm?" Charlie asked, eyeing Dean suspiciously when she noticed he wasn't wearing the sling anymore.
“Dean.” He speaks quietly, “Dean. You said my name.”
Dean rolled his eyes “You just have to show off with the big words, don’t you, Sammy? Nerd.” He appeared calmer now, yet Castiel could sense his inner turmoil was still boiling. He did not further the conversation, however, because he had learned that the inner workings or Dean Winchester were mysterious and not to be tampered with. Dean would come out with it when he was good and ready, or he wouldn’t, but there was nothing to be gained from pushing the issue.
“Aw, shit,” Danny said ruefully. “There I go again, not thinking. He’s your boyfriend? I swear I wasn’t trying to start shit up, I just go a little dizzy when I see a pair of beautiful blue eyes.”
“Yeah, because it’s weird, okay? Nevermind. You see anyone else here you like?” To be honest, Dean’s pretty much resigned himself to endure Sam’s smug ‘told you so’ for the next few days, especially since his brother left the bar already with a cute blonde. While Dean didn’t even get to do any flirting of his own because he was too busy wingmanning Cas.
He was on the bed, sobbing as he worked himself up and down on the vibrator, precariously wedged between two pillows so it’d stay upright. It felt too small, the shape was wrong, it hurt his insides as it scraped against his channel despite the excessive amount of slick gushing out of him. He was three days into the Heat and he felt like scraping his skin off with his fingernails; he’d swear it had never been so bad. Dean whined as he came, a small pitiful excuse for an orgasm. He fumbled under himself to press the button on the toy and felt the synthetic knot inflate, locking the vibe in place, stretching just under his rim. “Fuck,” he gasped, defeated. He knew he had fifteen, maybe twenty minutes of clear-headedness ahead before the need would start ramping up again, he was sore, exhausted and in pain and he simply could not take it anymore.
Castiel was completely lost. But suddenly Dean decided words weren’t quite doing the trick and surged up, his mouth meeting Castiel’s with single-minded intensity. A powerful instinct took over Castiel then, and he kissed Dean back with all he had, reveling in the feeling of his body against him, in the scent of him, the heat of him, the erratic pulse of his heart he could feel under his thumb as he stroked Dean’s neck and listened to him moan. He hauled Dean up by the collar and they were both standing, and Castiel pressed him without ceremony against the wall of the bathroom. Castiel left Dean’s mouth to trail a line of kisses along his jawline, but stopped short when Dean made a sound that was an awful lot like a sob. Castiel pulled back just a little, so that he could look Dean in the eyes. Dean Winchester, the bravest warrior Earth, Heaven and Hell had ever known, was shaking.
Jo's smile faltered as she looked at Dean, their pace slowing slightly. "If you don't want to, it's fine," she said, though her tone conveyed the exact opposite.
“Dean,” Cas warned, dragging his thumb over Dean’s bottom lip, teasingly dipping the digit into Dean’s mouth to wet it against his tongue. Dean nodded enthusiastically, a half-hearted promise to be quiet, though he wasn’t entirely in control of his body right now. He sucked in a sharp breath around Cas’ thumb, his hips thrusting into Cas’ hand impatiently, everything spinning right now. The pain in his arm had been forgotten the moment Cas had touched him in the first place, but Cas was still careful not to be too rough.
Cas didn't say anything, but his eyes said enough. He was upset with Dean, and Dean couldn't blame him. What kind of person just ran off like that in the middle of a serious conversation? A person with a lot of fucking issues, that's who. He already hated himself enough, and now he was making other people upset because of his issues. Why couldn't he just be normal? Cas might actually like him if he was.
"Okay," Dean found himself answering, trying to speak through his dry mouth, his tongue like sandpaper against the roof of his mouth. "Tomorrow night," Dean agreed. He already regretted his answer when he looked up again to meet blue eyes, a sad look on the angel's face. Cas couldn't hear their conversation, but it couldn't be hard to guess. Especially when Jo's face lit up with a smile and her arms easily wrapped around Dean's waist, pulling him into a hug.
"What the hell are you talking about?" Cas nearly growled, his heartrate speeding up again as he felt the panic start to return. Dean must have noticed too, because he pushed himself in closer to Cas' space, his expression softening. "I don't think I'm better, Dean! I-I don't have any friends! I'm a-a loser and I- I hate myself more than you could possibly hate me. I - Dean, you don't understand how much I want to just-" he cut himself off before he could say something stupid, and because he felt like he might puke if he kept talking.
“I don’t give a damn if you believe it, she didn’t fucking steal anything!” Dean yelled, raising his voice enough to surprise even John, who reeled back a little and looked at Dean, slightly shocked. Dean looked at the two idiots holding Charlie, pointing a finger into Ketch’s chest. “Take your hands off the girl. Both of you. Now.” Both of them looked at John, silently asking what to do. Dean grabbed Martin by the front of his shirt, forcing his attention back to Dean. “Don’t look at him, look at me!”
They were the firsts ones in the dining area this morning, most likely arranged by John himself. They wrapped up their breakfast, which was a helping of eggs and a side of fresh fruit, and then set off down the block for more walking. John explained a few things as they walked down the street, including that they grew their own food and raised livestock to have a steady food supply. It was limited, but they managed to build up their resources over the last ten years. John explained how the education worked, but there weren't many children old enough to be educated yet. Once kids turned sixteen, they were put to work with the rest of the neighborhood.
“If you don’t keep your voice down,” Cas warned, popping the button on Dean’s jeans painfully slow. “I’ll have to find some other way to shut you up,” he finished, his voice low and so sexy, Dean nearly moaned at just the sound of it. He hooked his fingers into Dean’s pants, tugging them down just past Dean’s thighs. He stood up straight again, running his hand along Dean’s length through his boxers as Dean held back a groan. “The walls are thin,” Cas reminded him with a smirk, leaning in to swallow the moan on Dean’s lips. When he pulled away, Dean let out a shaky breath, eyes following Cas’ every move.
"Dean, it's okay," Sam said softly, reaching across the table. Dean jerked away from his brother's touch, not wanting to be comforted. He didn't need to be babied. He was fine. He was working through his shit on his own. "Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to start something," he continued, putting his hands in his lap as Dean glanced up at him. "We can just forget about it."
"At least one of us is getting some action," she sighed dramatically. As Dean continued rolling his eyes, which seemed to never stop in Jo's presence, Jo's face lit up. "Oh, I have a present for you!"
"Sounds like a fair trade," Crowley agreed, stepping closer with a suspicious look on his face. "Is that all?"
Despite the blood and the gun pointed at his face, John grinned like a fucking maniac as he stared back at Dean. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, son.”
big thanks to my roommate @yoonmin_is_real for fixing all my mistakes even though she's not a spn fan in the slightest. ILY <3
Sam was quiet as he sat up, his eyebrows scrunched together in confusion. “But Dean, the rules are-”
Cas was quiet for a moment, long enough for Dean to look up from his coffee to figure out what he was feeling. "Dean, you know I would stay if-"
“Shut up,” Dean mumbled, pulling their spare cover up to cover their legs. He wasn’t going to admit that Cas was right, but he was. And Cas knew it anyway. “Can we stay home tomorrow? We can lay in bed all day and I can kiss you all over,” he suggested, brushing a finger over Cas’ bare torso.
Before anyone could stop him, Dean was out the door, gun in his hand. Forget not being able to kill his own father, John Winchester was a dead man. Dean hadn’t felt this kind of rage since he was a teenager, the day John sent him away and lied to Sam about it. Even then, it didn’t compare to how angry he was now. He ignored the protests from Jo as he stormed outside, no idea where he was going. John could be anywhere by now, but Dean couldn’t sit around and wait for something to happen.
“I see,” Cas mumbled, his face relaxing. “What if you squeeze too hard and hurt the other person? Then both of you are hurt,” Cas reasoned, making Dean chuckle. Of course, he’d be concerned about something like that. Dean shook his head, deciding not to answer that. Instead, he figured he would show Cas what he meant, just a little differently considering he couldn’t hold his hand.
Dean ran as fast as he could, even as a pair of claws sank into his calf. He pushed through it because Cas was more important than anything. He could feel the blood pouring from his leg, the searing pain getting worse with each time his foot hit the hard ground. He was struggling to breathe, struggling to keep Cas on his shoulder. The street was within view, a row of houses just a few hundred feet in the distance. Dean just had to make it inside. That's what he kept telling himself. He didn't think about how the hellhounds could easily break down the door. He had to have some kind of hope.
Dean shrugged his shoulders, not sure what to say. If he said what he really wanted, well, they would be sharing a bed. But he couldn't agree to that for many reasons. "Just try it, Cas," Dean replied, his fingers tightening around the clothes in his hand.
“How did you even know this stuff?” Sam asked, looking over Dean’s shoulder as Dean scribbled out the ingredients.
“Charlie, stop talking and I’ll tell you,” Dean laughed, cutting her off. She frowned, sitting back in the seat as Jo wrapped an arm around her shoulders to console her fake hurt. “It was great. We just went for a drive and talked.” He didn’t want to go into the details for obvious reasons, even though Jo already knew.
Cas was silent for a moment, curiously eyeing him. "I don't want to waste time adjusting to a new sleeping environment when I know this one works," he argued, shaking his head stubbornly. "If you want me to sleep in the bed, you'll have to sleep in the bed with me. Otherwise, I'll be on the floor here from now on."
Dean glanced at Sam, raising an eyebrow. Before he could ask, Sam shook his head, holding up his own book. "Sorry, gotta finish this book before we run out of daylight."
Cas wasn't sure what Dean meant, especially since his head was already spinning. With the feeling of Dean pressed against his back, Dean's lips on his neck, and the fact that he was still catching his breath from his panic attack, he was having a hard time figuring out Dean's words. "I mean, you're already helping," Cas answered. He felt guilty for waking Dean up in the first place, so to keep him awake just so he could distract Cas would make him feel worse. I mean, what would they even do to distract him? "You don't have to-" he started, but cut himself off as Dean's strong hand gripped his thigh, dangerously close to Castiel's growing erection. "O-Oh," Cas breathed, handing flying up to grasp at Dean's arms.
It had been a week since anything had happened. Dean’s return to work had been pretty smooth aside from the first day with John. He’d been out the past few days with Sam, finding every excuse to check out the abandoned houses and the area he last saw the strange man in the woods. Before that, he was on supply runs with Jo and Claire, who constantly badgered him about details of his and Cas’ relationship he refused to give up. Aside from Dean not being able to find anything on the dude he saw out in the woods, it had been a successful week. No more disappearances, no more fights with John. . . just peaceful silence.
Dean dropped his bag on the floor near the bed, stepping out of his shoes to leave next to it. Cas watched him move around the room, looking at everything, studying Cas' life as it was plastered all over the walls and on the shelves. Pictures of him and his family, his siblings he hardly saw anymore, and his pretty much absent parents. There were drawings and paintings lying around on his desk. It was a hobby he didn't think he was all that great at, but he loved it. Dean seemed to like them too, because he picked them up and examined them closely with a smile on his lips the whole time. Cas felt like he should have been more nervous about Dean seeing all of his things, but he felt weirdly calm.
Dean watched him walk off before turning around and helping Jo onto his back, putting on a show of faking her illness. As she wrapped her arms around his neck, she squeezed a little too tight, her lips next to his ear. “If you ever call me sweetheart again, I’ll cut your balls off,” she threatened, then loosened her hold on his neck and kissed his cheek sweetly. “Love you, though.”
Ellen stood at the same time, her face softening despite Dean’s rude behavior. “I’m sorry, Dean. Whatever is going on, I know you’ll find him. And Dean?”
When they made it back to the house, Dean waved the other three inside, hanging back to talk to Charlie. She hugged them all, promising to talk to them more tomorrow. Once they were all inside, Dean turned to face Charlie, shoving his hands in the pockets of his jacket awkwardly. Charlie grinned, as if she knew exactly what he was up to.
, it made his heart pound. Both girls gave him similarly questionable looks, like they were proud of him, but also very confused. He gave them a small shrug.
Cas glanced away from Dean’s hand for a moment, only to show Dean he was very concerned about that statement. “Why would you hurt yourself like that?” he wondered, not judgmental or angry, but genuinely curious. Dean didn’t have a great answer, but he’d tell Cas the truth.
"That's a nice offer, but we're sticking together," Dean informed him. Cas visibly relaxed next to Dean, unclenching his fists under the table where only Dean could see him. "At least, I am. I'm not sure what Sam wants to do, but I promised Cas and Jack that I'd keep them safe. I know this place is safe, but I can't leave them alone." He hoped John would understand, but he prepared himself for what would happened if he didn't.
Jack glanced at Dean, his look of fear fading slowly as he nodded. “Thank you, sir,” he said softly.
Dean bit his bottom lip, hesitating with the needle between his fingers. Uncertain, he reached out and wrapped his fingers around Cas’ wrist, pulling his hand over to his knee. “You won’t hurt me,” Dean promised, sliding his hand away from Cas’, instead moving it to rest on Cas’ head to stabilize it from moving. He felt Cas’ fingers digging into his knee as the needle pierced his skin, but he kept his hand steady. It was hard to work with little light, but eventually the wound was closed. “There, all better,” Dean announced, sticking a new bandage over the stitches. He felt Cas’ fingers relax, not moving away from his leg.
“Unfortunately, I know for a fact that it’s true,” Dean said, rocking on the heels of his feet while waiting for Bobby to say something. He just looked completely shocked.
"Got the book," Dean said, holding it up as Cas smiled warmly, scooting over to make room for Dean. Dean sank into bed next to him, making sure they were both comfortable. With the flashlight on, Dean turned to the chapter they left off on and started reading, keeping his voice down enough for only Cas to hear, slowly lulling him to sleep. Dean read for almost an hour, occasionally glancing down at Cas to see those blue eyes watching him, blinking slowly. The last time he glanced at Cas, the angel was finally sleeping. Dean sighed quietly, turning off the flashlight and closing the book. He set them both on the table beside the bed, easing himself off the mattress so he didn't wake Cas.
"I appreciate it," Dean answered genuinely. Finally, after getting his shoes on his feet, he gave a vague "see you guys later," and hurried out the door, eager to get to the bottom of whatever the hell was going on. He had a sinking suspicion that if Kaia really was missing, John had something to do with it. If that were true, Dean would seriously consider beating the shit out of his own father. It wouldn't be the first time he thought about it, but it would be the first time he actually did anything about those thoughts.
Dean groaned, annoyed that everyone had something to do except for him. All he could do now was turn to Cas, who had his arms crossed while he narrowed his eyes. Dean gave him an innocent smile, hoping he'd play along. Cas rolled his eyes. "Why am I the last resort?" he demanded, but there was a fond look on his face that made Dean's heart flutter. Dean gave him a pleading look, waiting for Cas to cave. Finally, the angel sighed, snatching the chess piece from Dean's hand. "Fine, but you know I'm horrible at this game."
“Just checking on you,” Dean answered, lingering in the doorway. The silence settled only for a moment as Dean thought about telling him where he was going. It would make Sam happy, most likely, but he would also want to come with him. Sam was still recovering from his intense cold and could hardly walk across the bunker without coughing up a lung. There was no way Dean was letting him outside the bunker.
As if he knew Dean was thinking about him, Cas quietly opened the door after a small knock, not bothering to wait for Dean's answer before coming into the room. He left the door wide open, which was fine because Sam was probably up and roaming around. "I brought coffee and breakfast," Cas said, putting a sleepy smile on Dean's face. He walked over to the bed, sitting the cup of coffee on the side table and the plate of food on the bed next to Dean. "You look horrible," Cas sighed, hesitantly reaching a hand to brush through Dean's hair.
“Yeah, I agree.”
Cas looks back toward the door. Billie’s rhythmic pounding like a warped and menacing heart-beat thundering in their ears. She’s wearing down the warding- the only thing holding her back.
“I’m gonna go talk to Dean and Cas. Be back later.”
“Mmmmmm, okay then.” Cas says. He flips him around, then easily picks him up and sets him on the table.
Dean’s eyes dart up to meet Bobby’s.
“I appreciate that.” Cas answers. “Dean tells me Reily’s crawling and trying to stand up already.”
“She wasn’t even on Death’s list.” Sam muses. He’s still in shock from what they just witnessed. He and Jack rush outside, met only by an eerie quiet.
Looking puzzled, Cas looks at him. “Wherever we are getting food from doesn’t mind if I’m naked?” he asks sarcastically.
Castiel opens the door and smiles at Sam as he leaves.
