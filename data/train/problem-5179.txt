Cas doesn’t say anything for a moment; instead, he turns his laptop towards Dean, biting his lip and looking away. On the screen is a foreclosed house right outside the town center. From the looks of the listing, it’s three bedrooms with one bathroom and more than enough room to grow anything and everything they could ever want. Dean remembers Claire telling him to look at a house because
“Is that so?” Cas asks, stepping into his space, and pinning Dean against the counter. His mouth quirks up slightly. Dean opens his mouth to say something, but he’s entirely distracted by where Cas’s fingers pull the strings of his pajama pants loose.  His voice is a low drawl when he says, “I am very proud of you.”
“Of course,” Cas says. There’s a twinkle in his eye. “I told you that he looks up to you and sometimes, he picks up your frustrating desire to run head first into every fight and not let us help.”
“We’ve been talking about marriage a lot lately. Maybe I should get married too,” Jack muses, not looking up from where he’s finishing up a math problem.
Dean blinks twice, his brain finally catching up with his mouth. He splutters, “No, wait — no, that’s not what I meant to say.”
Dean immediately feels the wave of acid rising in his stomach. Dean has never been particularly good at handling weeping children. It’s not like he had much experience or positive role models in that sense. Cas eyes Dean over Jack’s shoulder, silently begging Dean to do something. Dean exchanges a look with Sam, silently hoping his brother has an idea, but Sam just shrugs. Dean sighs, taking a step forward, placing an arm around Jack.
Dean laughs and bumps his shoulder against Cas’s until he shifts, so that Dean can stand in front of the soup pot. He hands Jack over, and Cas takes him carefully. Jack stirs and lets out a quiet whine before he drops his head to Cas’s shoulder, drooling slightly. Cas looks between Jack and Dean. “Should we be worried that he’s sleeping this much?”
Dean exhales sharply. The resentment festering in him threatens to burst out. He starts pacing the room, clenching his fists by his side. They were so close; they almost had it. He closes his eyes and concentrates on controlling his anger.
Cas is staring out the window at the dark sky above them when they cross state lines into Montana. Dean catches his face as they pass under a street light. His dark hair curls at the back; he stares at the curve of his cheekbones, the quiet downward turn of his eyes, the perpetual frown on his lips. Dean drags his eyes away. He clears his throat and asks, "What are we going to do when we find him?"
“That’s right,” Sam says. “He’s living in a Kansas City penthouse with Adam — don’t ask, but he might help us if we can convince him that this is the right thing to do.”
Dean shoots Sam a quick text to tell him that he's heading out with Cas and that he'll let him know if something important comes up. Sam's first reply is a thumbs up emoji, followed by a standard text insisting that they both stay safe and out of sight. He doesn't know how long they'll be away for, so he packs a bag and loads everything they could possibly need into the Impala. Cas stays quiet throughout it all, casually looking at something on his phone or otherwise occupying himself away from Dean.
There is a lot of grief and anger between them that’s been building for so long. They’ve spent so many years saying empty apologies, and forgiving each other for things that shouldn’t be forgiven as easily as they are, and maybe it’s time that they take their time with it. Sam is right; their lives are in constant upheaval and if this, whatever it is, between him and Cas is worth the pain, Dean figures it’s also worth the effort and time. It was never going to be an easy fix, but at least Cas is willing to try.
If Dean’s words won’t work, maybe his prayers will. The Shadow twists it’s fingers bringing both Dean and Cas to their knees and Dean winces as he feels his bones crack. He shuts his eyes and tries concentrating past the pain.
“I think you’re a good father, Dean,” Cas promises. He smiles at Dean, small and sweet in the way he does when he can’t seem to understand why Dean is so self-deprecating. He repeats, “You’ve been a good father to Jack.”
Cas squints at him. “Obviously not, Dean. I was very confused - I thought I’d been gone a lot longer than a few weeks.”
“If we play our cards right, we got decades ahead of us,” Dean muses, more than a little giddy at the idea. The rain settles into a light drizzle and an idea flashes in his mind. He reaches out to take Cas’s hand, pulling him up. “I know I say no chick flick moments, but I’ve always wanted to try this.”
“Are you and Castiel fighting?” Jack asks, suddenly, bringing Dean out of his thoughts.
, Dean. It’s not like she’s easily accessible anymore,” Sam says, pinching the bridge of his nose. Dean is about to point out that Crowley always was, but he doesn’t get a chance to because Sam closes his laptop gently, and studies Dean for a minute before his face softens. “Look, I know that you’re worried, but whatever this is, it’s probably just growing pains. He’s practically human now and with that comes normal things like arthritis and migraines. There’s nothing to suggest that he’s actually sick. Besides, it’s
Dean's shoulders tremble, and he lets out a shaky sigh. "Okay. That’s — that’s okay.” He’s fine, really.
Dean wonders what kind of sick joke the universe is playing on him that he had to go fall in love with a man that runs to his death every chance he gets.
Dean hesitates, cracking his eyes open to scan the room, hoping against hope, before closing them again. He’s doing better than most nights at not breaking down. “I still don’t know why you couldn’t tell me sooner. We could have figured it out together. There’s a lot of things that I wish you’d have told me sooner, man. Although, I guess, I didn’t tell you a lot of things either. I wish I could have told you that —”
Dean grins, way more confidently than he feels, and says, “Sounds easy enough.”
kid. He can't expect Cas to forgive him for it, but he can help. When Cas doesn't say anything, Dean begs, "Please let me help, Cas. He's my responsibility too."
Cas stares at him like he’s grown two heads. “Because he’s two, Sam.”
It’s not until after dinner that Sam pulls Dean aside. They’re on the back patio; Sam doesn’t say anything for a long time, and Dean feels twitchy. If he was still drinking, this is the part where he would focus on his drink and ignore Sam’s sideways glances that he thinks are sneaky, but are painfully obvious.
“Dangerous,” Dean finishes. He can’t think about that right now. Right now, all that’s important is making sure that Jack doesn’t lose it. While Sam’s situation was different, Dean still remembers how bad it got for Sam after his soul was returned. The last thing anyone needs is a nephilim spiraling. Dean sighs. “One thing at a time, Cas. We got his soul back. That’s a start.”
Dean wakes up in cold sweat, tries to catch his breath, knowing full well he's not getting any more sleep that night. Dean runs a hand over his face and tries to will his tiredness away. He takes out his phone and dials a familiar number. After four rings, he hears Cas's unmistakable voice.
“Who doesn’t exist anymore,” Cas interjects, closing his eyes again.
“Not really. I was just thinking,” Dean hums. Thinking about Cas, but still. He looks up to see the sun high in the sky, and pulls his hook out of the water, dropping his pole to the side. Dean pats Jack on the shoulder, smiling. “How about we head back to the cabin and I fix us lunch?”
It takes approximately half a second between Sam’s voice ringing out in the bunker and Dean, Cas, and Jack scrambling around to grab their weapons of choice. When Sam makes it down the stairs into the war room, he knits his brows together and frowns for a moment before realization dawns on him. “Not that kind of emergency.”
Dean blinks at Cas and Sam. “Uh - to be honest, the last thing I picked up was something about an Estonian demigod.”
Dean sighs, leaning into the touch. He admits, “No, I’m not.” He hesitates. “Can you stay?”
Dean just nods absentmindedly. He’s too busy watching Cas settle in on a chair. Jack helps Cas pull out his grace slowly, the vial not even filling up halfway. Within seconds, Cas collapses, his head dropping to his shoulder. Dean gets up and starts pacing the room.
“Hey,” Dean calls after Cas. He manages to catch up to Cas, pulling him back by the elbow. When Cas turns around to face him, Dean spots the grace extractor in his hands. He eyes it cautiously. “Are you ready?”
Dean snorts. "Understatement of the fucking year."
“I agree,” Sam pipes in from his chair.
“You didn’t really think I’d let you prance out of here, did you?” It asks, voice cold and — well, empty. “All I wanted was to go back to sleep, but you two gnats and that boy of yours made it impossible.”
“I don’t know — it’s hidden,” Billie deadpans. It takes all of Dean’s strength not to let out a frustrated groan. “It’s been missing for centuries. It’s sacred, potent, and dangerous.”
There are hellhounds because, of course, there are. Jack also eats the goddamn Occultum and disappears into thin air because, again, of course, he does. It’s actually pretty remarkable that their lives are so insane that his twenty-something presenting, three year old, pseudo-son eating a magical sphere while they’re all being attacked by hellhounds isn’t even top ten on the list of most insane things that they’ve had to deal with.
Billie doesn’t say anything for a long time, and Dean thinks she might teleport out, but she doesn’t. Instead, she looks at them and nods. “Okay.”
When he drives to the hospital, he sees Cas and Jack walk out. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out what happened as soon as he catches sight of their faces.
Dean never really considers exhaustion when it comes to cosmic beings. Cas doesn’t need to sleep, but he still gets tired. His grace is rapidly fading, and Dean found Cas hunched over in pain more than once recently. Jack does sleep, but it’s a lot less than most humans. Although coming back from the dead, especially from The Empty, probably takes a lot out of someone.
Just as predicted, Cas is sitting on the porch, his legs crossed at the ankle. He looks behind him when Dean opens the screen door to step outside. The air is chilly around them. Dean pulls his jacket tightly around himself and sits down next to Cas. The covering above them is enough to keep the rain away, but Dean still looks up at it.
Jack fidgets with the lid of the vial for a minute, and Dean feels like his heart is going to drop out of his body. It takes several long moments before Jack has it opened near Cas’s mouth, the white-blue fog swirling in the air for a second before entering Cas.
“Jack, are you alright?” Cas asks, cautiously, taking a step forward to place a hand on Jack’s shoulder. Immediately Jack throws an arm around Cas, dropping his head to the crook of Cas’s neck, and sobs loudly.
Dean gets out of bed early, pulling his dead man bathrobe tightly around himself as he walks down the empty hallways. As he turns the corner leading to the kitchen, the smell of coffee wafts down the hallway. When he makes it to the entryway, he spots Cas, dressed in soft track pants and a t-shirt, pouring himself coffee. His hair is sticking up in fifty different directions and his eyes are bleary. He glares at his coffee mug as if he could get the caffeine to kick in ahead of schedule; he pouts when that doesn’t seem to work, and it’s
There’s a lengthy pause on the other end and Sam’s voice is cautious. “Are you sure you guys can manage tonight?”
Billie eyes them all considerately. “The same will go for the gates of Heaven. I don’t see myself as
It’s a relatively straightforward spell in terms of ingredients. All it really needs is Jack’s blood, Cas’s blood, and a few things that they already have in the bunker. Dean feels giddy with excitement as he draws a salt circle around himself.
. The thought fills Dean with white, hot rage. He knows that it’s probably his fault, but in Dean’s experience, people who care don’t just up and leave when things get tough.
. “Just...stop.”
“The Empty,” Jack says flatly from around his burrito. Dean nearly chokes on his own. Jack looks up at him, frowning slightly. “I wanted to come back earlier, but I didn’t know if I could.”
Dean blinks at her. She looks at her food, poking at a pierogi with her fork. “I’ve warded this restaurant against my brother, so this is the best time for me to tell you that God knows about your plan, Dean. He knows that Jack is alive. He knows about the dark piece of Celtic magic you’re trying to pull off, and —” Amara hesitates and shoots Dean a pointed look. “He’s scared. From what I know, he’s been hiding, but he’s running out of hiding places because he’s destroyed every other world, and there’s only so many places you can hide in this one.”
He sticks his finger out to poke Dean’s nose; Dean gently pushes it away and says, “Cas, get him.”
Dean spent most of the afternoon shopping for groceries and kitchen utensils, and it offered up a nice distraction. He picks up everything that anyone could want; there are eggs for Jack, bacon for Dean, and hazelnut coffee for Cas. With everything in the kitchen, Dean can bake with ease, a habit he formed at the bunker whenever he couldn’t sleep which is an annoyingly common occurrence these days. It’s almost midnight when Jack strolls into the kitchen, looking worse for wear.
Dean pulls Cas closer so that his face is tucked against Dean’s chest. “What do you think will make you happy enough for it to be summoned?”
“What makes you say that?” Dean asks, but Sam just rolls his eyes. Right, brothers. Can’t really lie to them even if Dean spent a lifetime doing just that. Dean tries to keep his voice level when he says, “He called me his husband, and I know it was just the easiest thing to say to our real estate agent, but I can’t stop thinking about it, and well — it would be nice.”
Jack bites his lip, still looking at his hands. Slowly, he says, “It’s not a bad thing, but —” He hesitates, looking over at Billie who is leaning against the door frame. Jack squints at her. “Billie, do you think this power can be passed on?’
, he tells himself over and over again because it’s not him; he’s not a fifteen year old girl, moping around his room waiting for the guy he likes to call him back — except, Dean thinks, he’s spent so many nights like this over the years, waiting for Cas to respond to his messages or his prayers. It’s not that Cas didn’t care because Cas does, and Dean knows that; Cas gave up his entire way of existence to follow Dean into every apocalypse thrown their way, but just because Cas cares about him doesn’t mean that it’s the same.
“You will have less than a minute to snap your fingers and then God will be bound and his powers will flow into you,” Rowena explains. “Now, I don’t know what will happen after that point, and the power surge will be immense, but we’re all hoping you can hold it off.”
Cas's eyes widen in surprise before settling into something more knowing, the corners of his mouth lifting into a small, sad, smile. Dean feels a glimmer of hope as he opens the door leading into the building, ready to flash his badge.
“Dean,” Jack says once, opening his hand to reveal a very familiar black goo. Dean’s blood runs cold. Jack croaks, “Dean, I tried.”
Dean feels like the ground is going to cave in under him at any moment; he can’t believe that this is real, and not something Chuck dropped on their plate to break their will some more. All the words he wants to say are stuck in his throat, and he feels himself choking on them. When he meets Cas’s eyes, there’s silent despair there, an unspoken plea for Dean to say something, to talk Jack out of this. Dean lets out a breath. “Jack —”
“Great,” Dean mutters. “Is it a weapon?”
Dean eyes Cas and Jack behind him. Cas shrugs, yawning again. He sighs. “Yeah, that’ll be fine.” He takes the keys that the woman offers him.
“No,” Cas says, shaking his head furiously. Dean lets out a silent tremble and his throat constricts. He tightens his hold on Cas’s elbow and Cas shakes his head again, his eyes filling with tears this time. To Jack, he says, “I watched you die once and I’m not going to do it again.”
“There’s something you need to know,” Jack says quietly. He looks like a terrified, wounded animal with the way he scans the room, eyes flickering at everything except the actual people in the room.
"I need to run it by Cas, but Jack and I could come back to the bunker to help," Dean offers. He feels restless and he just needs to punch something.
Cas is still staring at him, his eyes dancing with amusement. He bites his lower lip and smiles. “So, say it.”
“We’ll see,” Cas says, and there’s a vague challenge in there somewhere, and Dean knows that they’re going to be arguing in the bedroom aisle of a Target very, very soon.
“Dean, are you listening?”
Jack just sticks his tongue out and starts running again. Dean lets out another heavy sigh and chases after him; being a nephilim probably lends itself to automatic speed because Dean thinks he’s fit and fast, but he’s nothing compared to Jack, who is all of two years old. If that wasn’t enough, every so often, Jack remembers he can fly, which makes the situation entirely more complicated.
“Quit showing off,” Dean grumbles.
“No, Cas,” Dean says, fingers tapping furiously on the table. Sam shoots him a look, probably to tell him to calm down, but Dean ignores him. He meets Cas’s eyes. “We can’t keep playing with chance when it comes to our lives anymore.
. He’ll be fine. He always is.”
, and Dean is already stupidly attached to him.
Dean snorts. “You’re the only one.”
Rowena laughs and it’s this lilt of a thing and Dean feels a rush of warmth. He missed her; he misses everyone, all the time, so much. She says, “I thought as much, which is why I got in touch with an old friend and we’re here to help.”
Cas turns the stove off before side stepping Dean to reach into one of the cupboards to pull out a bowl. He transfers the oatmeal to the bowl, carefully dodging Jack’s outreached hands. He stirs the honey in and continues, “Fermented honey is the most ancient form of fermented drinks. The Norse consumed so much of it during the first month of marriage that the term honeymoon originated from the practice.”
A town outside Philadelphia experienced a power outage that had no discernible cause, and while it’s beyond weak, it’s the only lead they have on Amara. It takes Dean a day and a half to drive there, and the moment he drives into town, his stomach twists with unease — his sensations all numb and he feels a single-minded draw towards a Polish restaurant that sits on a street corner. He runs a hand over his face and looks around warily. He’s almost positive he’s in Amara’s general vicinity, but nothing seems to be happening. He cuts the engine of his car and walks towards the restaurant.
Cas stares at him with wide eyes. Dean blinks, surprising himself at how much he means that, but he does. Chuck’s death is everything; hell, it’s more than everything, but despite everything, he can’t bring himself to turn Jack into a bomb. It might be selfish, but Dean feels like he earned the right to be a bit selfish.
for the third time in a week, and ignore every one of his emotions. No, it’s almost like it knows Dean is going through a crisis, and decides that this is the best time for all the monsters to come out and wreak havoc. There’s a vampire nest in Burkittsville; there are seven missing children in Shreveport, and a Norse demigod in Billerica, and they’re all fucking annoying.
“He’s handling it fine, but —”
“Well, I’m pretty sure we’re gonna be married in heaven too, so I’m not exactly sure how death can do us apart,” Dean muses, mostly because Sam’s face is turning a bright shade of red and he’s about to throw the book at someone — probably him, if he’s being honest. When he sees Sam’s eyes twitching, he says, “I do.”
Curiosity gets the better of Dean and he immediately raises a brow. “What are the other two?”
"I don't know," Dean bites out, far more viciously than he intends. Sam's eyes widen in shock before he narrows them, assessing Dean. He opens his mouth to ask another question, but Dean gets up from the table, grabbing the whiskey bottle in the process. He’s halfway out of the kitchen when Sam speaks up again.
Dean doesn't see Cas until the third day.
“It has to be astrologically compatible with yours,” Jack points out. Dean vaguely considers taking Jack’s laptop away from him. He knows he looks confused because Jack just sighs. “Dean, it’s a
"No," Cas says, sharply. "The plan was that you would help me find Jack — which I thank you for, but I never said I was coming back, and I've spoken to Jack about staying here."
Jack nods, wrinkling his nose slightly. “Pwease?”
"There's something else I want to tell you, Dean," Cas says, suddenly, breaking the stillness in the room. His voice is calm and level, but Dean can see the effort it's taking Cas to keep it there. He doesn’t look at Dean, and instead flips from one side of the newspaper to the other. "I know you want to stay here and help, but I would really prefer not to be around you right now."
“Jack, please,” Dean begs - yes, begs a toddler, after he feels the tightness in his knees. Jack finally seems to take pity on him because he walks over and stays still long enough for Dean to pull a shirt
“Thank you, Castiel,” Jack tells him and Cas pulls Jack into a side hug, and Jack leans into it. Looking at Rowena, he says, “This will work, right?”
Claire’s face immediately falls; she bites her lip and says, “It’s not for me, Dean. I know Jody really hoped for it, but I’m not like Patience or Alex. At least with hunting, I feel like I’m doing something to help people.”
Dean bows his head and feels his chest constrict tightly. So, it’s not all better then. He looks at Cas, who averts his gaze to the floor, frowning.
Cas leans back to rest his head on the pillow. He looks over at Dean once and his face falls slightly. Before Dean could ask though, Cas winces in pain. Dean reaches over to help Cas back down. He says, “Look, get some rest. We’ll talk about everything after.”
It's Saturday afternoon, and Dean is in the process of downing half a bottle of old whiskey when he hears the bunker door open, followed by some movement and an unmistakable trench coat. Cas hesitates at the top of the stairs and Dean swallows hard when their eyes meet, suddenly feeling very overwhelmed. Dean can just about make out the quiet exhale of breath as Cas walks down the stairs, taking slow, deliberate steps. He pauses at the edge of the war room table and fidgets with the sleeve of his jacket, looking down at the floor. When he looks up and meets Dean's eyes, his expression is carefully blank.
“Yeah, you don’t have a choice with that, buddy,” Dean says, trying to keep his voice stern, but it inevitably comes off as fond. To Sam, he says, “We’ll be fine.”
"Eileen?" Cas asks, squinting. "The hunter that Ketch set his hellhound on?"
. Dean’s hands hover above the door handle briefly before he walks away. He tosses Jack’s sheets into the laundry machine before returning to his room.
Dean nods, matching Jack in his sincerity. “Sure, why not?”
“Yes,” Cas says, easily enough. Dean knows Cas way too well to not see the sadness pass over his face, even if Cas tries to cover it up. Cas seems to know that too, so he adds, “It does feel like an important part of me is gone, but it’s my choice and I’m happy to live with that choice.”
Dean leans back. “Sam’s gonna love this.”
“Hello, boys.”
At least, not until Sam clears his throat.
“Could my grace work?” Cas says, cutting off Rowena. Dean immediately turns to face Cas.
“Good to hear. We need to be ready and vigilant,” She turns, raising a brow at Dean. “And not be stupid.”
"I'm probably better off showing you," Cas says as he pulls out his phone.
“No!” Jack practically shouts his reply, eyes widening in horror. He shakes his head. “Nobody else is hurt.”
“Sucks to be you, old man,” Dean says, shooting Cas a grin. Cas pouts, glaring at him. Dean bites the inside of his mouth to keep from smiling. He asks, “How’d the case go?”
“Kid isn’t listening,” Dean tells him, not really bitter about it. “I mean, who can blame him? The last time he was around, I was ready to sacrifice him.”
, or at least he thinks he is. The Winchester customary four hours of sleep gradually increased to a solid six, and lately, Dean thinks he’s even pulling eight hours. He still gets nightmares sometimes, it’s impossible not to. He still wakes up in the middle of the night thinking that this is all a djinn dream, and his life will crash around him, leaving nothing in his wake. He tries to shake the feeling, but he never seems to. The anxiety still prickles under his skin.
Cas just gets into the car. Dean glances at Jack, who shrugs and says, “I think you upset him.”
“What do you mean, why?” Dean asks, raising a brow.
He’s about to pick up a pair of khakis when Cas says, “Dean, I think I found the perfect hunting gear for him.”
Cas tilts his head and narrows his eyes at Jack. “Are you hurt?”
Dean blinks. "Ate his
Fifteen.
Whatever The Shadow wants to say gets lost in a burst of light, and the next thing Dean knows, he’s being pulled through the nonexistent floor. He tries to keep his eyes on Cas, but he loses him as the light glows brighter.
“Adam,” Cas says, squinting in confusion. “Is he still alive?”
at Sam and Sam just shakes his head. “I’m just happy for you, man.” Sam pauses, grinning again. “You’ve gone soft.”
Dean doesn’t know what to say.
Cas raises a brow. "I'm an angel, and Jack is one of the most powerful beings in the universe. I think we'll be fine."
“How are you feeling?” Dean asks, crossing the room so that he’s leaning next to Cas, with his back to the counter. It might just be the soft glow of the kitchen light and the haze of an early morning, but Cas looks much better. The bags under his eyes are clearing, and he doesn’t look as bone-tired as he did.
It turns out that neither of them are all that comfortable walking away from Jack’s room, so they pace the hallway outside the room, occasionally taking turns to go in and check on him. Dean can feel the tiredness seeping through his bones, so he drops down to the floor and pulls his knees up; he drops his head down and closes his eyes. He could sleep right there and it wouldn’t even regret the eventual aches he’ll feel in his lower back, but he doesn’t get a chance to because there’s a loud wail from Jack’s room.
children, Dean.”
They pull apart, and Dean flinches at the sight in front of him. The vast, scornful emptiness in front of him starts to take shape; it alternates between the shape of John, cold and ruthless, before switching to that of Mary — inviting and wholesome, but so utterly unlike the real Mary. It shifts to Jack, but the version of Jack with the burnt eyes, making the perpetual guilt that Dean feels twist into something utterly unbearable. The Shadow laughs once, clearly pleased with its own cruelty, before it changes again into Chuck.
“Is that — oh, come on,” Dean whines, but he’s quickly distracted when Cas kisses the dip under his ear. He glances over at Cas, who tips his head to the side and gives him a mischievous look. Dean quickly looks at Sam, Eileen, and Jack and realizes that they’re all distracted. He whispers, “Let’s get out of here.”
Dean shrugs when Cas looks at him, not even bothering to deny that. Billie continues, “I’m also not sure that The Empty would be keen on giving up the only being who has ever escaped for a second time.”
An unreadable expression flickers across Jack’s face, but Dean is too tired to figure that out. If Cas’s powers are failing, it’s probably something to do with Chuck or Heaven and right now, that’s the last thing he wants to poke at. He sighs. “Listen, Jack, you take the other bed. I’m going to take the couch.”
Jack steps back from them, wiping his tears. His mouth is drawn into a thin line. He opens his mouth, but closes it again when he can’t control the rush of emotions getting the better of him. Without saying anything else, he walks towards the entrance of the church. Sam follows him out, and Dean can make out Sam trying to talk to Jack.
"Hell," Sam says over the phone. Leave it to Sam to use Dean’s absence to come up with another mind-blowingly terrible idea. Dean opens his mouth to argue, but Sam continues, "Listen, the archangels were there when Chuck locked Amara up, right?"
“Dean?”
The house has a leaky roof, a bathroom that doesn’t function in any capacity, and apparently a ghost. Of the three, the leaky roof is what bothers Cas the most. He questions Patricia, the real estate agent listing the house, over and and over about mold that could grow in the woodwork and how much the water damage would cost, and
“I’m getting you out of this deal if it’s the last thing I do,” Dean says suddenly, his voice far stronger than it had any right to be.
“I’m sorry,” Dean eventually manages. “If it makes you feel any better, I don’t really remember my earliest memories either.” Dean hesitates, thinking about his mother and father. Cas shifts closer so that their knees are touching. Dean continues, “I don’t remember who mom was before she died the first time around. Not really, anyways. Maybe the person I had in my head never actually existed. My dad too; I don’t remember who he was before mom died.”
“No, it’s really not the same with Eileen,” Sam says, putting his trademark tone that he only pulls out when Dean has his head up his ass. Dean is about to protest when Sam continues, “Look, I love Eileen and I know she loves me, but you and Cas have gone through so much that’s so far beyond anything we’ve been through that it’s not exactly comparable. I mean, what’s a fancy engagement when he literally branded you when he pulled you out of hell?”
Dean debates lying; he could tell her that he got into a fight with Cas over something stupid, but it’s no big deal and they’ll fix it. It’s a believable lie too because if there’s one thing that’s constant in their lives, it’s that he gets into stupid fights with Cas over nothing in particular all the time. He could lie, but the feelings crowding his chest feel like a bomb ready to explode at any moment.
“What?”
“Hey,” Dean says, faltering, and he can physically see Sam exhaling. Dean rolls his eyes. “Dude, I’m fine. I’ve been through a lot worse than —”
Dean tries to follow them out, but Cas pulls him back. Dean hesitates, quirking a brow. Cas says, “His soul is back.”
“Yeah, it is,” Dean breathes out. “I’m getting you out of here, man.”
“No, I do — of course, I do,” Dean says, his voice cracking slightly. He eyes the aisle to make sure nobody is around to catch the conversation. “I just — fuck, Cas. I had a speech planned for when I finally asked you.”
Rowena scoffs. “Of course not. We had to track it down and it was very dangerous.” Dean shoots her an apologetic look but she waves it off. “Luckily, the Queen of Hell and Death together is — well, it’s a deadly combination.”
There’s something really eerie about the calmness Jack displays now. He’s still the same in a lot of ways, but all the power he’s holding now makes him display a level of wisdom he didn’t have before. Jack tilts his head to the side, and instantly Dean is reminded of Cas.
“She wants to see you too,” Sam says, quietly. Dean just makes a noncommittal sound, scrolling down the recipe on his phone. Sam continues, “Dean, come on, you haven’t seen anyone since — you know. Jody and Donna are both worried, and you haven’t even called Claire.”
“I don’t fucking know, Sam,” Dean exasperates, keeping his voice low as to not wake Cas. “He’s probably just tired, but man, you should see him. It’s not a new thing, either. He slept the entire car ride here, and at first, I thought it was because he wanted to avoid talking to me, but now I’m not so sure.”
“Stop,” Dean cuts him off. He can’t do this right now. Every ounce of his strength is spent on telling his body to
“Jack still has his grace,” Cas explains. “It’s similar to how Metatron dumped pop culture references into my brain, though those are fading now. Although, I can’t say that I mind too much considering Metatron’s taste.”
“Jack, stop,” Dean says, tilting his head so that he’s meeting Jack’s gaze again. “Cas made his choice to save you because he loves you. He didn’t regret it for a moment, and I’m sure that if he was here, he’d tell you that he would make that choice all over again. We’ve all made deals that bit us in the ass because we couldn’t see the people we love die. There’s nothing to forgive, okay?”
“Alright, enough,” Sam says, rolling his eyes, but he can’t keep the smile off his face. Dean holds out his arms, ready for the hug, but Sam completely sidesteps him to pull Jack into a tight hug, smiling broadly.
"A tragedy of our own making," Cas says. "I live with that guilt every single day."
“And you want to take this case on,” Cas confirms hesitantly. Dean can’t see Jack’s face anymore, but he already knows that he’s shooting a pleading look in Cas’s direction, and Cas has never been the best at saying no to Jack. Cas sighs. “Dean?”
There’s a lengthy pause and Dean can feel Cas steady his breathing against him. Eventually, he says, “The Empty.”
Jack looks away to focus on the tray. His face grows pensive as he rearranges the cookies into a perfectly straight line. A brief flare of worry ignites in Dean’s gut. He’s never been good at this part; he’s not a father, not really. He tried to be one with Ben, but that went about as well as one would expect when it came to Dean’s life. Claire isn’t really his kid — sure, he sees her as a daughter, but Jody is the one that takes care of all the tough conversations. Jack is different, and Dean knows that, and that’s the scary part.
Cas shoots him a flat, unimpressed look. “You could help, you know.”
It’s a quarter after midnight when Cas finally wakes up. Dean is drifting off when he hears movement, and he immediately jerks awake. Cas is pushing the blankets away so he can sit up.
Dean doesn’t know how that’s possible until he knows Cas is okay.
Except, Cas lets out another low whine and curls into himself, mumbling something in Enochian. He lets out a soft breath and slowly blinks awake. His voice is low and hoarse from sleep when he says, “Dean.”
“Right,” Dean says slowly, studying Jack. “Let’s get you something to eat and we talk about this.”
“Thank you,” Dean tells her.
Dean turns around. Jack gives him a pointed look. “You need to promise me that if you can’t find a way, you’ll let me do this, no matter what Cas says.”
Dean immediately raises a hand. “Wait, hold on. What happens when Jack absorbs Chuck’s powers?”
“Jack, of course it is,” Sam says, voice gentle. “We’re your family, and this is where you belong.”
“Don’t be stupid, Cas,” Dean snaps, far sharper than he intends, and Cas’s eyes widen. Dean can feel his hands trembling as he continues, “You can’t let yourself burn out just to be useful, okay? I don’t give a shit if you never do anything else
“You knew?” Dean asks, widening his eyes.
. They’re alive, standing in front of each other with their little makeshift family formed over the years, though many of them aren’t with them anymore.
Understanding immediately crosses over Sam’s face. He leans forward and gives Dean a knowing look. “He’s not going anywhere, Dean. Let’s give it a few days, and if he’s not getting better, then we’ll go to Hell and ask Rowena for help. I promise.”
But, of course, Eileen is Sam’s girlfriend, and she’s bound to pick some things up from him. She waits a lot longer than Dean thought she would, but halfway through their fourth episode together, Eileen lets out a sigh.
Dean considers it. He doesn’t think about it, for the most part, which is probably for the best because there’s a lot of memories he doesn’t like touching. He shrugs. “I guess I focus on the here and now whenever I can. You know, stuff that I did with you, Sam, Jack, Eileen, and the rest of our family. I mean, it might not be Mount Everest, but it’s something.”
After a long moment, Rowena says, “We would need the blood of an archangel.”
“I don’t know why we couldn’t have slept in a little longer,” Dean grumbles as he pushes the cart through the local grocery store. It’s eight in the morning, which is entirely too early to be functional, let alone doing anything productive.
Rowena goes back to her book. She’s silent for a very, very long time and Dean can feel the anxiety rise in him. Eventually, she lets out a heavy sigh and closes the book. She pinches her forehead and closes her eyes. When she opens them again, she gives them a small, sad smile. Her voice is strained when she says, “I’m sorry, boys. I really thought I had something here, but unfortunately, this won’t work.”
Dean exchanges a worried look with Cas, who says, “Is that — is that a bad thing?”
“There’s nothing we could have done,” Dean says, more to comfort himself than anything else. Cas just sighs and gets into the car.
“When Jack was dying, I made a deal to save him,” Cas finally says.
Whatever he’s feeling must be evident on his face because Mila immediately ducks her head and says, “Oh, I’m so sorry, Dean. I didn’t mean to bring up those horrible memories.”
“In exchange for Jack’s soul, I traded my life,” Cas explains quietly, his eyes never leaving Dean’s. “I’m sorry, Dean, but I couldn’t handle losing him and it was the only way. I don’t regret it for a minute.”
“Yes,” Eileen confirms. “He’s taking care of Castiel.”
“Jack,” Billie echoes solemnly before she teleports out of the bunker.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says, softly.
“Do you regret it?” Dean asks because he needs to know, because he wouldn’t be able to live with the guilt if Cas gave up being an angel just because Dean couldn’t live without him.
, he thinks.
"Gone?" Sam asks, slowly. Dean can see the muscles in Sam’s face twist in concentration, as if he’s debating whether the topic is worth the hassle. Dean wishes he wouldn’t, but Sam has never been particularly good at letting go. "Are you two okay?" Sam eventually asks, ignoring Dean’s silent glare.
It’s not surprising that the Men of Letters couldn’t compile information about The Empty considering that the only beings to enter it are dead. Cas knows more about it than literally anyone else, and yet, even Cas doesn’t know much. Dean flips through countless manuscripts, but everything turns up a dead end. Every religion on Earth has some form of void before creation — but there are no notes, no spells, no solutions, nothing that can help Dean. He doesn’t know how many hours, maybe even days, he spends on it, and yet, he makes no progress.
“His name is Andrew,” Mila says warmly. “Do you have any kids?”
Dean looks up from Jack’s emergency contact form to where Jack is filling out another form. He mentally calculates a year that’s acceptable for a high school sophmore and says, “May 18, 2005.”
“No, I’m good,” Dean tells Sam, patting him on the shoulder. It’s a ruguru in Nebraska; it’ll be a milk run for Sam and Eileen. “One of us has to be here in case Billie drops in again.”
“Well, I do have good news,” Sam starts just as Jack manages to narrowly escape Cas which causes Cas to step over his own feet and land on the floor in a loud thud. Dean snickers, but feels a pang of worry when Cas winces. He makes a move to stand, but Cas gets up and dusts himself. Jack, the actual devil’s son,
The drive to Montana is quiet. Cas sleeps quite a bit, despite not needing it, and Dean can't help but realize that it's probably just to avoid conversation. If he's not sleeping, he's staring out the window at the passing scenery. Dean fidgets with the tape player and slips in the mixtape he made for Cas years ago. He eyes Cas deliberately and a flicker of recognition passes over Cas's face before he turns back to the window, staring out at the expansive farmland. Dean sighs and turns back to the road, resigned to the fact that they probably won't talk.
It’s the first time he’s cooking in the new kitchen. The cabinets are freshly painted; they’re a bit blotchy and unprofessional, but they did it themselves, and it looks pretty damn fantastic if Dean says so himself. He’s stirring the soup, sprinkling the salt and pepper in, when he sees Cas walk in, hair still wet from his shower. With bare feet quiet on the kitchen floor, he steps up behind Dean, hands dropping easily around Dean’s hips, and hooks his chin over Dean’s shoulders.
“Sorry,” Jack says, standing up. He looks at his hands, biting his lip in concentration. When he looks back at them, a flash of guilt passes over his face and his eyes fill with tears.
“It hasn’t been easy for her,” Sam admits. He crosses the room to sit at the edge of Dean’s bed, causing Miracle to hop off the bed and wander out the room. Sam frowns. “You know, everything with Chuck messed her up a little. It’s not that she’s religious, but the idea that God has been fucking with our lives and whatever we had might not be real took a lot out of her, and then there’s the whole disappearing and reappearing thing.”
With how casual Cas is acting, Dean thinks that he doesn’t realize just how shocked Dean actually is. He throws all his brain power into finding Clive McAllister’s grave just to keep the loop of
Rowena hums. “Well, then there are the ingredients which won’t be easy to get.”
“Right, yeah, let’s go,” Dean agrees immediately.
“Don’t think Cas would be too happy with that,” Sam says, with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. Dean looks over Sam’s shoulders to where Cas and Jack are talking to Eileen. Sam’s face is a lot more serious when Dean looks at him again. He says, “You should think about it, you know.”
proposal.
“Son of a bitch!”
“I’m sure you can,” Dean agrees; it’s true as well because he has no intention of beating Jack, just like Cas and Sam don’t either. He shoves Cas’s shoulder lightly so that Cas gets up, allowing Dean to swap places with him. He takes the red chips and starts playing.
, Dean realizes in a moment of absolute clarity. He makes a mental note to find a ring and plan the perfect, perfect,
“Dean, if you don’t hurry the fuck up —” Cas says, with the most
Dean paces around the living room, as quietly as he can manage with socked feet. He checks on Jack twice, and both times he finds Jack fast asleep, snoring slightly. He paces, and he paces, and he paces — and Cas doesn’t stir once. He calls Sam four times, and Sam runs through all the information he has.
“The first quest was meant to strengthen Jack’s body. Step two is more spiritual in nature,” Billie says, slowly. She pauses, eyeing Jack.
“We’ll find a way, Dean,” Sam tells him when they finally break apart and Dean controls his emotions to an extent. “We always do.
Billie raises a brow at them. “This wasn’t the welcome I was expecting.”
than hell. At least, hell exists as something, and whatever torture a soul goes through can be substantiated. This — this is torture in a new form.
"It would be a lot easier if he was open to fixing it," Dean bites out. He's trying here, he's trying really fucking hard, but Cas doesn't want to hear it.
Cas just nods before walking up the stairs. He doesn't say goodbye before he leaves for Sioux Falls.
“It’s nearly noon,” Cas tells him as he kneels down. The corners of his mouth quirk up in a small smile. He takes the whiskey glass off the floor and places it on the table before he reaches a hand down to help Dean up. Once Dean gets straightened up, Cas says, “I want to head down to the farmers’ market and sell some of our pumpkins.”
Cas ignores him and barrels on, “I was just so desperate to save him. I had such faith that he would be good for the world — that he would be good for us, but when everything went wrong and God took him from us, I didn’t know what to do.”
“Likewise,” she says slowly, still frowning. “I hope you find peace, Dean.”
“A very long time,” Dean admits, letting out a gasp as Cas trails his tongue over a particularly sensitive spot on his neck. Despite everything telling him otherwise, Dean asks, “You?”
pointed look. Dean swallows hard. Billie says, “That includes all of you. The next time you die will be the last time you die.”
“Amara, what the hell are you doing?” Chuck shouts, but then Amara places a finger on her temple, and Chuck starts choking on air.
Sam clears his throat. “I think we might need to give them some alone time, Jack.”
Cas stays silent for a moment, his eyes scanning over Dean’s face, as if he can see right through him, which he probably can. Quietly, he says, “What happened to me wasn’t Jack’s fault, Dean.”
“And that’s why I’m picking our sheets out.”
“Of course I did,” Cas says. He screws the cap off the beer bottle. “It upsets him when he loses.”
"It's not good enough," Cas says with a shake of the head. “Not this time.”
“Is he sick or is he tired?” Sam asks during the fourth phone call.
Dean just stares at him. When Cas catches him, he shrugs and raises a brow. “What? The books all suggest that you speak to them in a tone they find pleasant.”
because Sam runs a circle between Dean’s shoulders and tells him that he knows it’s not fair. This goes against everything Dean knows; he knows he shouldn’t cry in front of Sam, he’s not allowed to cry in front of Sam, not really anyways, and definitely not like this. He’s stronger than this, or he should be, but — but, he’s not. He’s just a man and he just wants some goddamn peace and a
Jack bites his bottom lip, looking away from Dean. “What if you can’t find another way?”
“Alright,” Cas says with a shrug. “Considering I have information on The Occultum, I suggest you wait before killing me.”
Dean swaps his flannel out for his Fed suit as soon they get to the lake town Cas is staying in. The cynical side of Dean wonders if Cas intentionally found the furthest, most remote place he could find just to get away from him.
“Some monsters like vengeful spirits are hopeless, and all we can do is salt and burn, but others like werewolves, we could probably work something out to keep them from killing,” Sam explains. “I mean, Garth managed to go years without feeding on humans, and we know plenty of vampires that drink cow blood.”
“I could be better though,” Dean admits.
Jack says something that sounds an awful lot like his name, and Dean definitely preens at that.
. It's at the tip of Dean's tongue, and he could say it, but he doesn't because if there’s one thing that he’s better than most people at, it’s not saying things like that. Instead, Dean narrows his eyes at Cas. "The last thing we need is to blow Billie's plan because you want to be reckless."
There have been a lot of times where Dean appreciates Cas's bluntness and honesty, but he would be lying if it doesn't sting. His first instinct is to shout — to tell Cas that he can leave if Cas doesn’t want him here, which he clearly doesn’t — but, Dean knows deep down that if he walks away without fixing this, he’ll never have another chance to. It’s not like it matters though because when he tries speaking, his throat constricts and the words don’t come out.
An idea strikes Dean suddenly. “If an angel is graceless, does that mean that they’re human?”
“God,” Dean says, barking out a bitter laugh. Cas is still holding his hand, tracing over his knuckles. “We’re like some new age Romeo and Juliet.”
“So, what now?” Sam asks, taping up the last of his boxes. “What are you going to do?”
“I’ve made up my mind,” Jack cuts Dean off.
Rowena flashes Billie a toothy smile and Billie rolls her eyes, but there’s a level of respect there. Billie looks at them before she says, “Rowena thinks that she can read it, but when she does, she would need one of you to cast the spell.”
Dean swallows dryly. He picks up his own, now cold, coffee and pointedly drains it. When Eileen snickers, Dean groans, “It wasn’t like that.”
“The secret is not getting tossed around,” Dean tells him, tossing a crooked grin in his direction. Cas rolls his eyes and rubs his arm, wincing at the pain. Dean eyes the bone, the blood, and the grace.  “So, we have everything, right?”
“Castiel should have never made that deal to save me,” Jack insists, biting his bottom lip and looking away from Dean. He takes another bite of his burrito. “He never should have died for me, and you deserved to have him around. I thought that if I could get him out of The Empty, you would forgive me.”
“I think Dean’s taste in movies is great,” Jack offers. Dean stretches forward to high five Jack.
Cas’s face softens just a fraction, and he nods. "We should probably leave before we lose him again."
“I was an ass,” Dean finishes for him. Jack shrugs, but doesn’t correct him, which to be fair is probably because that’s the truth. Dean sighs. “Yeah, well, when your best friend starts dying every other year on you, you tend to have trust issues.”
When Cas catches him looking, his tips his head to the side and squints in confusion. Dean shakes his head. “It’s nothing. We should pay and get out of here.”
He jumps off the kitchen chair and rushes down the hallway towards his room. As he digs through his closet, he hears a flap of wings signaling Jack’s presence. Behind his flannel and old band shirts is a single hanger; Cas’s trench coat, the one from when they burned his body, is hanging on the hanger, and inside the trench coat lies Dean’s jacket. Dean takes it out carefully, making sure not to touch the hand print gracing the left shoulder. Dean inhales sharply and tries not to think about how, in some twisted sense of bookends, it’s at the exact same spot that Cas’s hand pulled him out of hell.
“I can’t,” Dean says, his voice trembling. “Just let me have this one thing to myself.”
Billie doesn’t respond; she frowns, looking away from them, her face softening just a fraction.
Jack lets out a low whine and buries his face into Cas’s chest. Dean chuckles, low and soft, and settles down on the bed. He asks, “Would it help if we stay here with you?”
. The thing that Dean learns very quickly is that Cas is insufferably competitive sometimes; it’s never about anything important, but for every great thing Dean does around the house, Cas has to one up him. Naturally, Dean can’t let that slide, so he’ll do something else. It actually works out well because the house needs a lot of work, and between the two of them egging each other on, most of the repairs are done. Dean quickly catalogues what’s left and decides that he’ll build a bookshelf for their bedroom for all of Cas’s terrible murder mystery novels.
“Everything — just, everything,” Dean kisses him again, smoothing a hand under his shirt.
Dean thinks because he does and he has for a very long time, longer than he probably realized. If this was a movie, this is the part where Dean would tell Cas that, and maybe kiss him, but this isn’t a movie, and Dean can’t get the words out. So, he shifts, putting some space between them, and it’s like a trance breaks because Cas does the same thing.
“Hmm, I don’t know about that,” Dean says, punctuating his words with another poke to Cas’s side. This time, Cas lifts his head to give him an actual look of despair, before he drops his head back down. “Jack wants us to wake up.”
“What have you been up to?” Cas asks, all casual, bringing Dean out of his thoughts.
"You don't think I was lost too?" Cas asks, with a crack in his voice, betraying his anguish. He fingers his blade carefully and twists it in his hands; his anger is only betrayed by the way his hand trembles around the blade. "Jack was
“We’re getting it,” Dean immediately tells Cas because there’s no way they’re walking out of the store without it.
“Oh for fucks sake,” Dean groans, as soon as Sam’s words register, and well, that’s not exactly what he means to say because Sam stares at him in confusion. Hell, everyone stares at him in confusion. Dean quickly amends, “No — I’m really happy for you, dude. Like, so happy. Eileen is awesome — the best, but for fucks sake, how did you manage to upstage our announcement?”
When he meets Cas’s eyes, Dean can tell that Cas is worried.
“But this,” Dean says, gesturing between them. “This can’t happen.”
“I would have done the same thing,” Dean finally manages, even if his insides feel like they’re betraying him at every second. Every time, Dean thinks, every fucking time. He’s lost Cas so many times that it almost feels like it’s his destiny to grieve him forever. He rasps, “How long do you have?”
and says, “If you promise to eat your dinner, you can have it after.”
Dean exchanges a look with Cas who just shrugs. Cas ruffles Jack’s hair and says, “Do you want to hear a story?”
"Just drop it, okay?" Dean snaps, and Sam instinctively recoils in shock. Dean clenches his jaw and bites the inside of his cheek to keep from raising his voice."I don't know why he left and I don’t know when he’s coming back. He’s just — he’s just gone, okay?”
Cas and Dean exchange a look. The corners of Cas’s mouth quirk up into a small smile as he says, “As you wish.” He raises a hand and waves behind him as he treads out of the kitchen.
Sam lets out a heavy sigh, and Dean can feel him standing up. He doesn’t open his eyes when he hears Sam’s heavy steps walk away from the bed. “You really should get out of the bunker more.”
“I don’t have control over The Empty and neither does my brother,” Amara says with an air of finality. Dean sighs, dejectedly. After a moment, Amara continues, “However, I suppose the one weakness, if you can call it that, is that human souls can’t exist in The Empty.”
“Well, then you quit and we find something else that you like more,” Cas reassures him.
Dean still prays every night.
Dean clears his throat and says, “Hey, Jack. I don’t know if you can hear me, or hell, if you wanna hear from me. I hope you’re okay, wherever you are. I hope you know that if you need anything, you can always come to Sam and me, okay? We miss you.” Dean bows his head and takes a deep breath. “Jack, I’m sorry. I know I can never make amends for everything you’ve had to deal with on Earth, but I really wish I had a chance to try.”
Dean shifts when he feels Cas turning in his arms. When they’re face to face, Cas blinks up at him. “What about you, then?”
“I am,” Jack says immediately.
“You’re a real piece of work, you know that?” Dean says out loud again, like he’s done so many times in prayers that went nowhere. “You always do this, man. You have no clue how it makes me feel, knowing that I just can never protect you, no matter how hard I try. If you just told me sooner, we could have figured it out together, and none of this would have happened.”
“You are,” Sam agrees.
The room feels like it’s spinning underneath him, but when Cas runs a hand through his hair, Dean starts to steady himself. He lifts his head away from Cas’s chest to look up at him. Cas’s face immediately softens, and he reaches a hand out to cup Dean’s face; Dean leans into the touch and feels the warmth radiate off Cas. He traces his thumb along the band of Cas’s pajama bottoms, before dipping under the fabric. Cas’s breath hitches above him.
Patricia’s eyes widen comically. “I don’t — who are you people?”
He knows it’s all over his face because Sam looks at him with thinly veiled concern, like any word could be the wrong word to say in that moment, but Dean can’t bring himself to care anymore. Cas is gone, and this time, it might actually be for good. He’s ridden the waves of grief so many times in the past, but this feels different. It’s like he’s stuck in time, unable to move, unable to focus on anything, but the fact that Cas is gone, and unlike last time, Dean doesn’t even have a body to burn.
Dean hums in affirmation. “Right.”
Right then, Jack runs right in front of Cas who, in one quick swoop, picks him up. He kicks his feet and reaches down towards the floor, but Cas stays firm and settles Jack in his arms. He gives Dean a wary look over Jack’s head and says, “It’s a long story.”
True to Jack’s words, he doesn’t want to sleep, but they do manage to get him settled on the bed in the spare room. Dean grabs extra pillows and sets them on either side of Jack, so that he won’t roll off the bed. He drops down to the mattress and Cas settles next to him, with Jack in the middle.
would be devastated.”
Cas stays silent for a long time, twisting the vial in his hands. From where Dean is sitting, he can see the wetness in Cas’s eyes. When he does speak eventually, his voice cracks slightly. “I choose — I choose to be human.”
It’s Jack’s turn to fix him with a confused look.
“Are you happy?” Dean asks, not because he doesn’t trust that this is actually his life now, but he still needs to know.
Dean’s chest tightens. Jack stares at him, waiting for a confirmation or rejection, but Dean can’t say anything. Instead, he takes a deep breath and turns to walk out of the room. At that moment, Dean realizes how hard it must have been for Cas and Sam over the years.
“Well, he isn’t exactly human,” Cas says, pinching the bridge of his nose. “The sugar from the ice cream probably didn’t help.”
“Cas,” Dean breathes out, taking a step forward.
"Fix it," Sam says firmly when Dean doesn’t reply. "Fix it before you regret it because our lives are dangerous, and we've lost too many people, and you never know when it's going to fall apart."
Dean pales. He clenches and unclenches his hands at his side. Jack stares at him, his blue eyes widening, and Dean inhales sharply, focusing on steadying his breath. He can do this; he
“We have needs, Sam,” Dean says, flipping him off.
Cas breathes in and closes his eyes. When he opens them again, there’s tears pooling in the blue expanses of his eyes. “It’s not so much when as much as it’s how — the deal was that The Empty would be summoned to take me when I experienced a moment of true happiness.”
“We’re in a grocery store, Cas,” Dean says, swallowing hard, and looking away. “It’s not exactly the best place for that.”
“Well, let’s get to it then,” Dean says, clapping his hands. He’s about to pick Jack up when he realizes that Jack is an actual, full blown, toddler. “Wait, we can’t take him with us.”
"Well, whatever worked on Amara should work on Chuck, and Michael is the only archangel left, and he might still be in the cage. It's worth following up on, just in case Billie’s plan doesn’t work," Sam explains.
Once they’re in the hallway, Dean exhales sharply. Cas gives him a gentle, encouraging look and Dean nods before he says, “I needed someone to blame, and he was right there.”
"Fine," Dean says. If that's how Cas wants to do this, he'll play along. He needs to talk to Cas, and he needs to fix this, and if that means groveling, well, Dean probably deserves that. "If you want to be stubborn and stay here, that's fine, but I'm not leaving here without you, so you better have a couch I can sleep on."
He hesitates. Jack meets his eyes with the kind of resolution that Dean has seen so many times over the years, most often in the mirror. It’s a look of a boy who thinks that the greater good is worth anything, even his life.
Dean eyes Cas. “And, you?”
“Probably the doubts they had, but were too scared to question Heaven. Some probably thought about falling but didn’t out of fear and others probably regret not giving humans a chance,” Cas says. “I don’t think many of us were happy blindly following orders, but we didn’t know better.”
“I’m not letting Jack out of my sight,” Cas says. Jack opens his mouth to argue and Cas gives him a look. “Jack, I need you to understand that as much as you want to help, you’re still my responsibility.”
The story, it turns out, is a demigod who can apparently mess with time. Dean doesn’t know how someone as powerful as Jack could be affected by magic like that, but Cas explains that it probably has something to do with Jack being half human and therefore can still be affected by the linearity of time, or whatever. If Dean is being really honest, he’s not paying attention; he’s too busy wiggling his finger in front of Jack, and dodging it as soon as Jack reaches for it, which in turn, just makes Jack pout at him.
“Contradictory emotions are, like, humanity 101,” Dean says with a wave. “Some days are better than others, but getting through each day feels like a victory in and of itself, and if you live long enough, the good days would eventually outweigh the bad ones.”
Dean nearly falls off his bed at a very familiar voice. As soon as he opens his eyes, he sees Jack, who stands upright for a moment before keeling over. Dean immediately rushes to the floor to help him up. “What the fuck, Jack?”
“No, Dean,” Cas says with a shake of the head, his voice gentle. “We made our own choices. Every choice I made, from when I pulled you out of Hell, has been mine and mine alone, and that includes every mistake I’ve made.” Dean remembers Cas’s words, clear as day, when he was so filled with rage that he couldn’t even let Cas explain.
Dean can barely make out Cas’s face in the dark, the light from the kitchen barely trickling into the room. He keeps his voice low when he says, “We should go home tomorrow.” Cas’s face immediately transforms into defiance, but Dean cuts him off, meeting his gaze with a newfound determination. “I know you’re angry, and I know you want your space — and, listen, you can have all that at the bunker, but just in case this is something dangerous, I would much rather have the resources at the bunker to fix you.”
. Dean pulls Jack in close, hugging him tightly. Jack tenses for a moment, his hands dangling around his sides, before he reaches around to wrap them around Dean.
"I'm not coming back," Cas says, crossing his arms across his chest. Dean opens his mouth to argue, but Cas raises a hand. "I made up my mind, Dean."
“Dean, all you had to do was ask me to stay,” Cas says, the happiness etched all over his face. “I’m not going anywhere.”
Cas doesn't say anything for a long time, but eventually, he says, "I will, and please watch over Jack. He's still soulless." Cas pauses before turning around to walk down the stairs. When he gets to the last step, he looks at Dean, face softening a fraction, the corners of his mouth turning up just slightly. "And try talking to him. Despite what you think, he still cares very deeply about your approval and love."
about it, and right now, Dean would rather jump off a cliff than talk about how he practically told Cas that he loved him, and Cas rejected him without a second thought. Some things are just off-limits, even to Sam.
Dean is cutting up potatoes, the only acceptable vegetable, when Sam walks into the kitchen. He shoots Dean a quick look before quietly moving towards the table. He drops down, pulls out his tablet, and wordlessly scrolls through something. When he doesn’t say anything, Dean goes back to cutting the potatoes into neat squares, checking on the broth boiling on the stove.
across it. Cas’s face splits into a proud grin, and he drops it into the cart without waiting for Dean to respond. Obviously, they’re getting that.
“Huh,” Dean says, considering it. He looks at Billie. “It might not be a bad idea.”
“Not quite,” Amara tells him and Dean feels like he’s just been punched in the gut. Amara explains, “Angels without their grace are human in the sense that they can no longer do the things that angels can do, but they’re not human in the sense that they have a human soul. An angel without its grace can return to its angelic state by consuming grace, but a human soul can never become an angel — well, not unless God does something about it.”
Billie just gives him a flat look. “Where’s Jack?”
. For someone who doesn't need to sleep, Cas looks like he needs a week's worth of it. Dean knows that he probably doesn't look any better. It's been one sleepless night after another, and it always comes back to the same things; Mary's death, Jack's death, Cas, himself. It's probably taking as much out of Cas as it's taking out of him.
“Good,” Dean grits out. “I’m glad he’s scared.”
Cas walks out of the library without saying anything else. Dean waits until the footsteps recede down the hallway before turning to Sam. He says, “So, we’re going to ignore that, and look for a way to fix him, right?”
Dean lets out a sigh of relief. “Thank you, Amara.”
, Dean. You didn't even give me a moment to grieve that properly."
“Is that the best idea?” Dean asks, as he looks between Jack and Cas.
Dean isn't even all that sure that they should be finding Dark Kaia right now, considering the spear they promised her is long destroyed, but he also knows that Claire needs to put the Kaia situation to bed, and she'll do whatever she can for that.
It takes two days, Cas begging an untrustworthy Shaman, and Sam reading through every book that the Men of Letters have ever collected for them to even grasp what The Occultum could be, and even then, finding it becomes an entirely separate thing.
Sam grins, his entire face lighting up with pride. Together with Rowena and Eileen, Sam kneels back down, lighting a fire, and slowly unscrews the vial of Michael’s blood, dropping it into the cauldron. A thick, black smoke arises. Dean wrinkles his nose, watching as Sam drops in Adam’s bone. The smoke turns white. Sam picks up the vial of Cas’s grace, a flicker of hesitation crosses over his face, and he looks up at Cas, the lines in his forehead drawn together.
“I like this,” Cas says, picking up a onesie with bees on it. Dean wrinkles his nose - it’s a pale yellow; it looks ridiculous, but Cas stares at him with big, hopeful eyes that Dean sighs, and throws it into the cart as well. He’s never been particularly good at saying no to Cas, and Cas really loves bees. This earns him a small, grateful, smile. “Thank you.”
Dean scratches the back of his neck and looks away from his brother. “Uh, about two months ago?”
Dean looks around the room and the tension is so heavy that Dean feels the nausea rising through him. He says, “Okay, lay it on us. What do we need?”
okay with this?”
“This might be hard to believe, but I’ve grown fond of the boy as well,” Billie says, somewhat sharply, glancing between the two of them. “Believe me when I say that if there was another way, I would have pursued it, but God’s death book is very clear on what his eventual demise is.”
Dean crosses over to the bed, dropping down on the edge, and reaching out to grab Cas’s hand. He’s never been good at vocalizing his feelings, and it might be too late to actually be good at it now, but fuck it. They can’t keep running around like this, not when their lives are finally set right.
When he leaves, Eileen looks at Dean over her coffee mug. She raises a brow. “I thought you said we can’t do that in public spaces.”
to her; she nods before teleporting out.
Dean catches Cas’s eyes. He’s about to open his mouth to protest and tell Cas that they can look for another option when Cas tilts his head to the side and gives Dean a look; there’s a silent plea in his eyes that tells Dean that he can’t protest. Dean nods slowly and Cas matches him, exhaling softly. He turns to Jack, placing one comforting hand on his shoulder.
“Famous last words,” Cas warns, eyeing Jack warily. Jack just smiles a big, toothy smile at Cas, and Cas immediately softens, the corners of his mouth curving up into a smile. He admits, “This is kind of nice.”
Mila shakes her head. “No.”
There’s no response for a long time and Dean figures Cas is asleep, but then Cas turns on his side so that he curls up against Dean, half on top of him. When Cas blinks at him, the blue irises of his eyes glimmer in the dark. Dean twists so that he has one arm around Cas’s shoulders. In any other universe, in any other situation, this would be
“A while,” Cas replies, considerately. He pulls his trench coat tightly around himself, and shivers, which immediately sends another shot of panic through Dean. He knows Sam catches it as well because he raises a brow at Cas, who just shrugs. “It started a few months ago. The battle with the souls from Hell took a lot out of me, but I was hoping that it was only temporary.”
Somehow the bunker doesn’t feel empty anymore, even if it’s just him, Cas, and Jack now. The halls still echo, but it’s not eerily quiet anymore. Dean cooks a lot; Cas gardens sometimes, and Jack — well, Jack is a
Dean raises a brow at him, and Jack shrugs. “I’m fine.”
Dean smiles instinctively because Cas says things sometimes that are so effortless, kind, and thoughtful, and even if Dean doesn’t want to believe it, he has to because Cas says it with such conviction. He is selfish, Dean thinks, because he wants to save Cas from The Empty for Cas’s sake, but he also wants to save him because he can’t imagine a world where he’s okay, let alone happy, without Cas.
“Hello, boys,” Rowena says, tilting her head. “I’ve caught up with dear Samuel and sweet Eileen, but how have you boys been?”
Dean tries pulling on a sweater vest on Jack, and Jack immediately stares at him like he’s lost his mind, which is absolutely fair.
“Nah, I think you got this covered,” Dean says with a wave, but then Cas gives him another look, and this one says
“Jack,” Sam says slowly. Jack doesn’t look up. “You can tell us anything.”
Well, there it is, the irrevocable rejection.
Jack stands back up, dusting himself off. He smiles slightly, dropping a little plastic bag with a bone inside on the table. With a wince, he says, “Billie’s teleportation is so different from my flying.”
“The usual,” Dean says. It was the Mark tonight, but other nights it’s Hell, and sometimes it’s the numerous bodies that piled up over the years.
This gets Cas’s attention. He looks up from the form he’s filling to give Dean a look. Dean shrugs. “The kid discovered astrology.”
Sam shrugs in response. Dean stares at him with wide eyes and hopes that his silent message of
“Yeah, about that.”
“Dean, wait,” Cas says sharply, fixing him a look. Dean closes his mouth. Slowly, Cas says, “I am Jack’s father in every sense of the word except through direct blood, so theoretically, my grace should work. Is that correct?”
them. Though, I suppose, there’s a blessing in there because a lot of those early memories were pretty awful. Still, I wish I could remember how it was when Mount Everest formed or the first storm on Earth.”
Dean stops breathing. “You did
“I could go with you,” Cas offers immediately.
“That’s not true,” Jack immediately shoots back.
“You will not,” Cas mumbles into his pillow. “Sleeping is one of three human activities that I’ve made my mission to experience more of.”
“Rowena,” Dean says immediately. Isn’t that the obvious choice?
Dean doesn’t have time to worry about a plan because a sphere of light descents onto the church. He exchanges a look with Cas as the sphere drops down. Within seconds, the hellhounds are gone, and the sphere explodes into a burst of light, leaving Jack in its wake.
“No,” Sam says, raising his voice an octave. He gets up from the table and crosses his hands across his chest. He glares. “No, I won’t stop, okay? Cas is my best friend too, and you’ve basically Voldemortified him just because you don’t want to process your grief. I’ve been walking on eggshells around you for weeks, carefully avoiding talking about him, hoping you’d finally come around. Instead, all you’ve done is isolate yourself from everyone and everything.”
“If you’re sure,” Sam says, even if his voice makes it very clear that he doesn’t believe Dean.
They make a silent decision to not tell Sam about the house until it’s ready. Dean doesn’t know why or how they came to that decision, but he likes to surprise people, most of all his kid brother. As October gives way to November, the house starts coming together bit by bit. They do the roof first, stripping the curling shingles and pulling out the rotting wood underneath. Cas does most of the work because, of course, he does, but Dean does his part too — half of that involves admiring the sweat running down Cas’s back and the other half involves staying out of the way as Cas figures it out.
Dean makes a list of everything they need for a two year old. Between the internet and Cas’s old parenting books, he thinks he has everything down. They’ll need a first aid kit, of course, because even though Jack might still have his healing abilities, they can never be too careful. A stroller seems unnecessary because they aren’t going anywhere, but a car seat is absolutely paramount - just in case they have to leave the bunker in a hurry. They already tried Cas holding Jack in his arms while Dean drove, and that wasn’t ideal. Jack definitely needs blankets in case he gets cold; toys, too, and maybe a playpen for when he wants to play, and clothes, lots of clothes.
“I think he wants this one,” Cas says from where he’s holding Jack in front of him. Jack is stretching out of Cas’s hands towards a stuffed bear. He manages to reach it and pushes a button, which causes the bear to start talking. Cas blinks at it before staring at Dean. “The toy bear talks, Dean.”
“It’s not a weapon, per se,” Billie says. “But, it is powerful.”
Dean sighs and concedes that’s fair. Rowena gives him a sympathetic smile before continuing, “Now, we’re hoping Amara will be strong enough to keep Chuck neutralized long enough for us to do this, but in the event she can’t, Billie and I will help.” She turns to Eileen. “Eileen, my dear, you need to constantly add the crushed rosemary and cassia into the cauldron, reciting the incantation each time you drop something in.”
An expression that Dean can’t quite read crosses over Jack’s face, and he crosses his hands behind his back. He says, “I’m not really sure this is the place for me.”
“I believe you mean that,” Cas says, his lips quirking up into a small smile that doesn’t reach his eyes. There’s a
Rowena studies him for a long time before she smiles softly. “You really are a selfless being, aren’t you?”
“Of course, Dean,” Cas says, with a low chuckle.
Cas frowns. “I wish I could have — well, you know.”
“Are you
He knows what this is. He’s known for a very long time, but never did he think that the
It becomes evident that they need to lock up all their weapons because if it exists somewhere that a toddler can reach, Jack will most certainly get his hands on it.  They also set up a playpen for him, which ends up being completely useless, because apparently Jack’s wings haven’t gone anywhere, and he can still fly.
Amara studies him carefully as she takes a bite of her food, her eyes never leaving his eyes. Swallowing hard, Dean says, “Yeah, we need your help to trap Chuck long enough for us to cast the spell and drain him of his powers.”
“I don’t think I’m good at this,” Cas admits, still staring at the soup with a mix of frustration and anger. He tilts his head to look at Dean. “I did quite enjoy eating when I was human, but cooking - well, I would prefer not to do it.”
Dean looks up to see Rowena standing in the war room, her hands on her hips and a bright smile on her face. Dean gapes; this is the first time he’s seen Rowena since she died, and she looks more alive than ever. He glances at Sam, who can’t keep the smile off his face.
“We don’t care,” Dean says, his temper flaring. “Either find another way or we’re out.”
“Romance of the goddamn ages,” Dean says, biting back a laugh.
“I can’t pick anything up, but I can’t use my powers,” Jack says, studying Cas for a minute, and a pang of worry flares in Dean when Jack shakes his head. “It’s probably nothing, but — well, I can usually detect an angel’s presence, even when their grace is as diminished as Castiel’s is. Right now, he almost seems human.”
Dean raises a brow. He takes out two beers, passing one over to Cas. “And you didn’t?”
Dean exhales sharply. He feels like he just survived cardiac arrest. “I’m going to kill you.”
At that moment, Dean really regrets not buying parenting books because Jack stuffs his hands into his pocket, pointedly looks down at the ground, and says nothing for a long time. Dean feels a pang of worry rush through him, his stomach sinking. He looks at Sam and hopes that his brother would have an answer because he’s always been better at this than Dean.
“Fuck, I love you,” Dean sighs against Cas’s mouth.
“Come in,” Cas says, voice hoarse.
Jack’s brows draw together and he squints at Dean. “What do you mean?”
“Coffee,” Eileen grumbles, passing them wordlessly to the coffee machine. She glares at it, just like Cas had done, before she fills her cup. She takes a sip, inhaling softly. “Nobody speak until I’m done.”
Dean drops the all purpose flour into the cart next to the butter. He eyes the shelf for the garlic croutons, but a very specific one. There’s one on the far shelf, and Cas spots the woman reaching for it and immediately moves. Normally, Dean doesn’t give a shit about what they get, and more often than not, they’ll save money buying store brand, but he’ll fight tooth and nail for Mrs. Cubbinson’s. He holds his breath, watching as Cas moves quickly. It’s almost like he has his grace still with the speed he moves, grabbing it off the shelf before the woman can reach it. Cas bows his head apologetically when the woman glares at him, but as soon as she walks away, he turns to Dean and grins.
“We were,” Eileen tells him, a twinkle in her eye. “Before you decided to come home and ruin it.”
Jack is silent for what feels like an eternity before he exhales. He looks at Dean when he says, “Okay.”
He camps out in the infirmary all night. There’s only one bed, so Dean sleeps in a chair. Jack paces around the room, occasionally running a hand over Cas’s body. Dean sometimes makes out wings flapping, signaling Jack popping in and out of the room. He doesn’t know how long he’s been asleep for, but when he wakes up, he finds Cas sitting up in the bed. There’s tired lines around his eyes, but he’s smiling.
Billie tilts her head to the side, studying him closely. “Sorry, I can’t tell you all the pieces of the puzzle yet.” Dean opens his mouth to argue, but she raises a hand, and Dean promptly shuts his mouth. She explains, “The more information you know, the easier it will be for Chuck to figure out what’s going on. Right now, we need to take advantage of the fact that he’s off-world, and make our move.”
"Actually, I don't," Cas says, his voice low and dangerous. When Dean meets his eyes, the anger flashes like electricity behind them, and Dean is instantly transported back to their first meeting in that barn. Cas, terrifying and strange, could have disintegrated Dean with a snap of his fingers, and Dean still decided to test him. He finds that he’s decidedly more nervous now than he was then. Now, Cas’s anger is personal.
“I’m not doing family trust exercises,” Claire tells him immediately. Dean snickers; he has no intention of ever making anyone do trust exercises, of all things, but he knows that Jody probably put the girls up to it at least once. When Claire smirks up at him, all confidence and bravado, Dean just rolls his eyes and pulls her into a hug. Against his chest, Claire says, “What’s this about anyways?”
True to her words, Rowena has Hell on lockdown; she called all the demons still on Earth back to Hell, and the world is safer for it. The remaining angels chose humanity in the end, falling to a world that they might be able to recover in; Billie runs Heaven using the power of human souls, so the more people live their lives positively and enter Heaven, the more Heaven shines bright. It’s a different kind of Heaven too, apparently, but also true to her word, Billie locked it all up, restoring a natural order to things. Amara is still around, getting massages in Vegas or playing keno in Atlantic City. Chuck — well, Chuck Shurley is alive somewhere in the world, but Dean doesn’t really care. The world has enough sad, pathetic men, so what’s one more?
Dean watches Cas’s eyes snap up; he looks at Billie and then at Dean, and Dean smiles at him, more than a little hopeful.
Dean raises a brow at Billie. “What the hell?”
Cas takes a step to the side, which allows Dean to finally face Jack. He glances at Cas, expecting anger and betrayal, but instead getting a knowing look, a silent plea that Dean should do the right thing. Dean nods slowly and takes a step forward until he’s right in front of Jack. He reaches a hand out to cup Jack's face, and Jack’s eyes widen in surprise. There’s so much unsaid swimming in the blues of Jack’s eyes; the hurt, the betrayal, the
Dean wanders restlessly; he taps his foot in a quick rhythm against the floor and checks the timer. It’s been twenty two minutes; Cas has thirty eight minutes left. He watches Jack drum his fingers on the desk as he looks at his own timer. Dean can feel his hands getting clammy, the sweat dripping down his face.
Jack has the EMF meter out as soon as they’re out of Patricia’s sight. He strolls around the kitchen, wrinkling his nose as it beeps, and Dean knows that he should probably pay more attention to the ghost inhabiting the house, but he’s more interested in the kitchen cabinets. They’re a boring brown and definitely in need of a paint job, but they’ll do the job. The refrigerator is functioning, even if it’s not the industrial one that the bunker has; there’s a dishwasher, ample counter space, and a functioning oven. The tiles on the floor are cracked, but it’s nothing that they can’t fix.
“Fair enough,” Dean concedes.
That almost brings a smile to his face. Mila hums. “Marcus was never good with mornings.”
Amara collapses to her knees, looking ahead at where Chuck’s form lies. Dean exchanges a look with Sam, who has an arm around Eileen. Rowena hunches over the table, and Dean can see her struggling. Billie, who looks better than the rest of them, still looks drained. Nobody says anything, everyone watching carefully for any sign of life from Chuck. It takes several long minutes before Chuck coughs, and jolts into alertness. He tries standing but he can’t and drops back down.
“No,” Dean says, carefully keeping his bitterness at bay. He takes a swig of his drink, somehow wishing the whiskey would burn his insides enough for him to feel something that isn’t the impossible to grasp grief he currently feels. He turns to face Sam. “Not since he left.”
“No,” Dean says, automatically, because he can’t give up. He’s already lost Cas enough times, and he’s not losing Cas again. Especially not now. “There has to be a spell somewhere that can help an angel regenerate his grace quicker.”
Cas shrugs. "Hunted is probably an exaggerated term, but I took care of it without much harm to myself. I was just in the area, and a woman's son was missing and well —" Cas hesitates, something passing over his face that Dean couldn't place until now, but suddenly the pieces fall into place. Dean should have known.
Cas carefully eyes two brands of oatmeal, even though they always get the same one, and Cas is the only one who ever eats it, unless Sam visits. “Because, Dean, I have work and I would like to get this done.”
Quietly, Cas says, “Dean.”
translates over to Sam.
"Maybe," Dean agrees. He just has no idea where to start.
It doesn’t take a genius to see that Cas has been struggling a lot lately. It’s not just that his wings are clipped and his powers are limited, it’s the simple things that are getting to him now. He’s visibly aging in ways that a lot of angels don’t. Dean doesn’t know all the details, but he knows that whatever it is, it’s probably not a good thing.
“I’m coming in.”
He wakes up again during the ending credits, and more specifically, during a pillow thrown at him during the end credits. When he blinks awake, he sees Cas with his head thrown back and mouth slightly open. Dean slowly sits up and rubs the sleep out of his eyes with the back of his hands. He lightly taps Cas on the stomach.
Dean exhales sharply. He narrows his eyes at Billie. “What’s the catch?”
Cas doesn’t say anything. He takes a step back, the fear palpable on his face, and Dean feels the anger threatening to burst through him. This cosmic scumbag took on his shape to make Cas feel scared and betrayed.
The one downside to living in an underground bunker is that Dean has to trade early morning sunlight trickling into the bedroom for infinite safety in the form of ancient magical warding. Logically, Dean knows that the reason why the bunker doesn’t have windows is that it’s dangerous for outsiders to catch what goes on inside, but he still hates it.
“Dean,” Cas says, recognition spreading over his face. He blinks twice, and Dean can tell that he’s adjusting to his surroundings. He squints. “Is it really —”
Something unreadable flickers over Cas’s face. His voice is slow and deliberate when he says, “There might be a way — it’s dangerous, but I could go to The Empty.”
“I’m going to kill him when he gets back,” Dean mutters, grabbing the decanter filled with whiskey in the corner. He takes a swig straight from the bottle. “I’m going to yell at him first, and
“Probably,” Sam agrees, but he doesn’t look up from his computer. For a moment, Dean wants to throw something at him to get him to focus; instead, he clears his throat loudly. Sam looks up and meets his eyes and sighs. “I’m sure there’s probably a spell in the Book of the Damned or the Black Grimoire, but we don’t have a witch that can pull that kind of magic off.”
Dean pats him on the shoulder, squeezing it gently. He tries smiling when he says, “Death doesn’t really stick with me.”
“But your mother —”
cowboy hat. It’s flat out the most adorable, sickeningly adorable, thing that Dean has ever seen. He doesn’t even wait for the go ahead from Cas before he picks it off the shelf and drops it on Jack’s head. Jack shakes his head for a moment before the hat dips further down his head till it’s almost covering his eyes, and he lets out a giggle.
“Her,” Jack says, tilting his head towards the door. Billie's mouth drops open and her eyes are wide. Jack’s voice is thoughtful when he says, “I think the power would be safer in Billie’s hands. After all, she’s Death and she’s supposed to reap God one day.”
Cas tilts his head and narrows his eyes in confusion before he turns to Sam. He says, “If you don’t mind, Sam.”
Cas places his beer bottle down on the counter and takes a small step forward so that he’s in Dean’s space. He draws his hand down from Dean’s shoulder, over the underside of his wrist, and when Dean turns to look at him, Cas slides his fingers up Dean’s wrist. Dean inhales slowly, but doesn’t look away, instinctively pulling Cas closer. Dean catches Cas’s eye and licks his lips. Cas looks up at him, dropping his hand. Dean’s breath hitches.
“I tried to kill him,” Dean immediately shoots back, ignoring the flutter in his chest. “Several times, actually.”
"That's fair," Dean says. It can’t be easy for either of them. Claire is trying really hard to come to terms with her father’s death, and Cas’s role in it; Cas, for his part, is trying desperately to be there for her. It’s just complicated.
“Will do,” Jack says, waving them off.
“Dean, that wasn’t you,” Sam says gently.
It’s an uncomfortable car ride back to the bunker, with nobody really talking. Dean feels restless; there’s an itch for a drink that doesn’t go away. When they pass under a light, he sees Jack lean against the back window.
It’s Eileen. Dean just curls into himself some more.
Jack grins. “We were trying to come up with a birthday for you.”
Dean blinks, feeling his throat constrict.
“Yes, Dean, we will,” Cas tells him, very pointedly, and Dean knows he has no chance of getting out of that one.
“That was then,” Amara shrugs, looking away from Dean to her food.
“You’ll throw your neck out,” Dean grumbles. When he hears someone clear their throat, he looks up to see Claire standing over them with her arms crossed across her chest.
“I’m great,” Dean chokes out, forcing a smile.
“Hey, kid,” Billie says. “I have the next step of your quest.”
“Right, yeah,” Dean agrees begrudgingly. “One normal fucking day, that’s all I ask.”
Dean laughs, so stupidly happy, and leans down to kiss Cas again.
Dean eyes both of them again. “Actually, I don’t know. Think I prefer the second.”
He hears footsteps in the distance and a minute later, Jack runs into the room, Cas right behind him, and Sam not far behind. When Jack spots Billie, an expression that Dean can’t place flickers over his face but it quickly disappears, and Jack says, “Hello.”
“No!”
— better than he’s looked in a while. There’s an effortless, carefree quality to Cas now; his blue eyes are dark and luminous, more celestial than when he was an angel, and Dean wants nothing more than to lean over and kiss him.
Cas drops his head back to the pillow, and Dean quickly moves the blanket so that he’s wrapping Cas in it. He places a hand on Cas’s shoulder again, in what he hopes is comforting, before standing up. “Just get some rest.”
Cas nods, but his face tightens. “But Dean, I need you to know that I still need time to work through — work through
“We should go to the school,” Cas says, walking into the room. Dean quickly closes his laptop where he’s
Dean doesn’t hesitate when he says, “We are.”
Cas sighs and rubs a hand over his face, pinching the spot between his brows. His voice is tired when he says, "I know you're sorry, Dean, and I do appreciate your apology. I just don't think I can forgive you right now. You needed time to forgive me for what happened with your mother, and I think I'm entitled to take my time to make sure things will change with you. I can't be your ‘punching bag’ for whenever things go wrong."
The bunker shakes and the lights flicker, the cosmic wardings that are already damaged from the last time Amara broke into the bunker are effectively toast. Dean instinctively tightens the hand that’s on Jack’s shoulder; Jack meets his gaze, his eyes filled with fear, and Dean knows that no matter how comforting he’s trying to be in that moment, he probably also looks terrified. One of the overhead lights burst out, shattering the glass bulb all over the war room table. Three, two, one. Dean watches as Amara lands on the table, holding Chuck above her telekinetically.
When realization finally comes, when the feeling and the nature of the spell finally clicks in his head, Dean’s blood runs cold in his veins. “We’re hoping? So, you’re saying this is all theoretical?”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says softly, the corners of his mouth quirking up into a small smile. He places the vial on the side table to face Dean completely.
Four sets of eyes stare at her, waiting for her to continue, but Billie just levels an unimpressed look back at the room. Dean grumbles, “Great, thanks for the help.”
“Dean, you’ve been crying,” Cas deadpans, but Dean can see that his eyes are a misty too, so he’s not the only soft one here.
Sam and Eileen are already back by the time Dean makes it back to the bunker. He feels a spark of anticipation when he sees Sam leaning over a sigil painted on the floor; he lights a candle and starts mixing various ingredients, and when he spots Dean, he nods in his direction. Dean notices a vial of Michael’s blood next to the blue-white fog of Cas’s grace on the table.
Jack silently looks at his hand, twisting his fingers together. Something coils in Dean’s gut at the sight — Jack is so similar to him sometimes that it’s painful. When Jack looks up, he can’t hide the sadness in his eyes. “Dean, you know that this is the right thing to do. You know that Chuck has to die.”
Dean immediately stares at Cas, at a loss for words. Cas’s face contorts in anger and he pulls his arm away from Dean. He gives Jack one last look before he storms out of the room. Dean watches the muscles in Jack’s face clench before Jack walks out of the room, not looking at them. Dean clenches his fist at his sides and lets out an explosive sigh, the rage churning inside him.
Sam wordlessly steps into his room, shuts the door behind him, and pulls up a chair. The lines of stress form on his forehead as he frowns. “Explain.”
When Cas falls asleep that night, Dean writes a speech.
Dean flinches. God, he’s such an ass. Reigning his emotions in as much as he can, Dean tries again. "I know that, but — but when Chuck told us that nothing about our lives is real, I reacted badly. I just — I didn't think my actions mattered because nothing mattered anymore. I was just so lost, Cas.”
Sam actually laughs at that, the bastard. It’s not until he manages to control it to a snicker that he says, “Dude, you could go in there right now in your pajamas and give Cas one of those plastic toy rings from cereal boxes and ask him to marry you, and he'll say yes in a heartbeat.”
“That’s not true,” Cas cuts in. He looks down at Dean, his face impossibly soft. “Don’t be so self-deprecating.”
There’s a flurry of movement in the bunker as everyone packs their gear. Rowena gets her setup ready, his eyes flashing purple, as she reads through the book; Eileen loads her gun with angel killing bullets while Sam is transferring holy oil into a small can. Dean looks down at his gun — completely ineffective against Amara, but he likes having it on him. He scans the room and immediately spots Cas passing by in the hallway. Dean double checks his gear bag before he zips it up and races out the room.
There’s just a softness to Cas in the morning that Dean doesn’t often get to see during the day, and Dean feels a flutter in his chest at the intimacy of it all. When Cas catches sight of Dean in the entryway, he tilts his chin up and smiles sleepily.
Sam and Jack are waiting outside the infirmary when Dean walks out. Sam immediately stands up, shooting a look in Dean’s direction. Dean just nods, silently telling Sam that yes, Cas is fine. He might be human now, and Dean will come to terms with that and what that means with regards to
Dean exchanges a look with Cas as they walk up to the church entrance. The muscles in Cas’s face are set into a quiet determination, and Dean knows that look. It’s the one where nothing in the universe can stop Cas from protecting Jack, no matter what he finds on the other side; it’s the one that was fixed on Dean in the cemetery as he pointed that gun at Jack. He can feel his throat constricting, a foreboding sense of shame rushing through him. He takes a deep breath and steadies himself, and follows Cas into the church.
Cas frowns. “Dean, you
“No, you can’t,” Dean agrees, reaching over to take Cas’s hand. “We’ll just stumble onto a toddler next time.”
“I’m just glad you’re feeling better,” Dean murmurs, not moving his hand away.
Dean is about to say something else, but Sam’s loud shout cuts him off. The hellhounds attacking the door are nearly through. Sam grunts, “Guys, I don’t mean to press, but this would be a really good time for a plan.”
“Good,” Sam says, patting him on the shoulder.
Realization immediately dawns on Sam, and Dean wishes nothing more than to disappear in that moment. His face softens and says, “Oh, so, he told you.”
Patricia gives him a startled look. “I’m sorry — it’s just — are you saying you believe the local legend?”
Once Cas settles into the driver’s seat, he frowns at Dean; the wrinkles on his forehead crease together in trademark worry. He says, “Well, the internet made it very clear that if it wasn’t something you’re open to, my intervening would have led to you feeling more lonely and frustrated, and you were doing so well—”
“I told you that I’m fine,” Dean chokes out, reaching for the knife to cut the peppers. He adds, “I’m processing my grief just fine, so you can stop worrying.”
proposal out the window. Cas continues, “Not yet, anyways.”
“Right,” Dean says, slowly. “Free will.”
He wakes up earlier than he intends, and he’s about to fall back asleep when he hears movement in the kitchen. When Dean walks in, he sees Cas moving around with a level of ease that he hasn't seen before. Not even at the bunker. Dean leans against the door frame and watches Cas pour himself a mug of coffee, with his back turned to Dean. His hair is mussed, and he's in a thin white t-shirt, and Dean doesn't remember the last time he's seen Cas dressed down. His chest flutters lightly at the sight.
Kissing in the rain is actually the worst experience ever; it’s blinding, it’s distracting, and the water gets everywhere, but hell, Cas isn’t complaining, so Dean isn’t complaining. It’s not a particularly sweet or urgent kind of kiss, but it’s grounding in a way that comes with the assurance that they were a constant force in each other’s lives and a promise that it’ll continue.
“You should go,” Dean says, voice rough from disuse. He can’t even remember the last time he spoke to another human.
He corners Dean in the kitchen on a night that neither of them can sleep, which seems to be every night lately. The nightmares go unsaid, but Dean doesn't have to press hard to know what Sam's are about, and Sam doesn't need to look far for Dean's. There's the empty shell of their mother's corpse, so far beyond recognition that they couldn’t even attempt to bring her back. There's Chuck and the impending doom that sits over their heads and the very fact that nothing about their lives is real. There's Rowena, and there's Jack. There's Cas,
Dean bites his tongue to keep himself from laughing as Sam and Eileen immediately register the fact that they’re not alone in the bunker. It takes a second, but Eileen immediately jumps from her place on Sam’s lap, buttoning her shirt, and turns to give them a mock salute. It takes Sam a little longer to catch up, as he scrambles around for his shirt, but when he does, he looks up at them, smiling sheepishly, the tips of his ears pink.
Dean just shrugs in response.
“When are things ever easy?” Deans asks, wryly. Without really thinking, he reaches out to grab a half empty beer bottle. He drains the rest of it before tilting it towards Sam. “So, it’s settled then?”
“Wait,” Cas says hesitantly. Dean turns to look at him, and the visible tension in Cas’s face lets down just a fraction. "There is a second bedroom upstairs. I can sleep on the couch. It’s not like I need much sleep."
Sam narrows his eyes. “Why not?”
, he repeats like a mantra in his head.
“Hey, Cas.”
He’s brought out of his thoughts as Cas stirs next to him. He blinks up at Dean, trying to wake up, and despite himself, Dean reaches a hand out to cup Cas’s face, and he watches Cas’s eyes flicker between Dean’s hand and Dean’s face and Dean thinks he should maybe drop his hand, but he doesn’t want to. He knows he should say or do something because Cas is staring up at him, expectantly, but when he tries speaking, his throat feels dry and the words don’t come out.
“Cas, he’s two, he’s not hunting - oh my god -” Dean cuts himself off when he sees the shirt Cas is holding up. It’s a pale blue with a white rabbit and the words
Dean exhales sharply. "Consider it a win for us."
“Once he’s back to normal, he’ll never let you live that down,” Dean explains, holding back a laugh. Jack just stares at them both.
When Dean looks at him, he sees Cas smiling fondly at Jack, and Dean feels a light flutter in his chest at the sight. Fatherhood is a good look on Cas. It’s remarkable how quickly he fell into the role as soon as Jack was born, never once questioning his place in Jack’s life. There were growing pains, like with all things, but Jack knew what he was doing when he chose Cas, and Cas has never let him down.
“Yeah, but it’s expensive,” Dean starts but Cas stares at him firmly, and Jack picks a box off the shelf, and really, Dean never had a chance. He sighs. “Alright, alright. Put it in the cart.”
“Of course, Dean,” Cas says, slipping under the sheets.
It takes Sam two weeks to confront Dean which, in his defense, is two weeks longer than Dean expects.
“When’s my birthday?”
Cas rolls his eyes, but Dean can tell that he’s amused. He shrugs and says, “I don’t steal them. If I just so happen to stumble on to a situation where I need to be a father figure, well I can’t really say no, can I?”
“We want him to grow up strong, Dean,” Cas says as he takes out Sam’s oatmeal and a bottle of honey.
Dean leans against the counter as Cas shuffles around the kitchen, with Jack in his arms. He pulls out a pot and drops the water and the oats in. Dean watches as Cas hums to himself, stirring the oats lightly.
“You know, Sam was going to college to become a lawyer, but eventually he realized that he really liked hunting,” Dean explains. “If you decide you don’t like school or that you would rather hunt, then you can always drop out, and we’ll get back on the road.”
Jack raises a hand up in greeting and says, “My friends from school want to meet at the diner.”
to work, but they both feel gross about that idea. Besides, Dean knows that Cas has been itching to do something more. He reaches over and takes Cas’s hand in his, lacing their fingers together. He squeezes lightly and says, “You’ll be great.”
“How dare you,” Chuck hisses, raising a finger. Dean braces himself as Chuck snaps his fingers. When nothing happens, his eyes widen in surprise, flickering around the room. He tries snapping his fingers again, and once again, nothing happens. He drops his shoulders. His voice is meek when he says,  “Fuck, now what?”
Dean just nods, unsure of his own voice. The burst of light and the black void flash in his mind, and Dean swallows hard. Desperation etches its way through Dean.
, so Dean sighs. He hands the phone over to Cas and takes the shirt from him. He finds Jack hiding behind a chair. He says, “Hey, buddy.”
