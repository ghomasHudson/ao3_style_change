“God damn it, Cap!” He yells into the sky, knowing full well the snow will swallow any sounds before it makes it to the ground below. It’s already piling ever higher, any remains of a motorcycle will be completely gone by the end of the hour.
For long minutes he just stares at it. The box is light weight, a deep shimmering black and made of some kind of metal. There is no latch, no markings on the outside, but Steve knows exactly what lays inside it. He can remember the ring like it came from some far away dream. It will be a simple tungsten, hammered and brushed into an imperfect pattern on the outside but baby smooth inside. There he will find a simple engraving in a script too neat to be called cursive, but soft and swaying all the same.
They rolled off, tussled with each other between laughing and Tony thought maybe things were finally going to be good between them, maybe a little outlet was all they needed. But suddenly Steve was over him, straddling his hips and pinning his wrists to the ground and Tony’s breath choked. Everything had stilled, suspended for a second before Steve shifted and brushed his ass down over Tony’s stunningly hard erection.
"Sorry, sorry. Go back to sleep.” He waves and continues on to his original target, resolutely ignoring the decidedly not adorable grumbling and squirming of the sleep mussed super soldier behind him. “I'm just your friendly neighborhood sleep deprived billionaire. Nothing to worry about."
Tony is stumbling into the communal living room after a three day inventing binge at roughly 3:30 in the morning. He just wants a nice decaf cup of hot liquid sludge before bed and the living room happens to sit between the hallway (and thus elevator doors) and the communal kitchen. (And sure he knows that his own floor has a very functional coffee machine, but the one on this floor always gets a nice undertone to it since Bruce always uses it to brew his weird herbal teas and something about the floral taste really adds to the burnt acidity Tony prefers). He is stumbling in the dark, or actually slight blue hue of the arc reactor, since he'd insisted JARVIS not bother with the overhead lights incase any teammates where about at this hours.
“What?” Steve manages, but he feels shaken by the half memory and lets the armor slip past his fingers. Iron Man is across the room now and Steve can only stare as he stumbles and slams a hand into the elevator pad.
“What?” Tony’s eyes are comically wide in mock indignation and she can feel some tears prickling at the edge of her eyes with how hard she is pushing to keep a straight face. Tony sees it, because of course he does, and the mirth in his eyes doubles as he waves the metal in the air in the same way she would wag her finger at him. “I think that last one was a keeper.”
They are quiet for the elevator ride, glancing at each other and looking away like they are sharing a secret with each glance. They don’t always look up at the same time and without the deep brown locking him in place, Steve finally takes in what Tony is wearing. He nearly swallows his tongue.
He wants to kiss Steve one more time and another time after that, and just for good measure a third and fourth time if he can swing it. His body is hot, so over warm and delicious. If Steve steps away, Tony will fall right through the floor and he just can’t take it.
“Next time, you ride with me. Okay?” And Tony’s whole face cracks at that, his eyes are big and shimmering. Rhodey’s body sags in relief, in sorrow for all the things he failed to protect this man from. He forgets all about the strangeness of Tony’s skin, ignores the hard metallic feeling of it where the man rests his temple against Rhodey’s chin. Nothing matters anymore. He found him, he has him and he is bringing him home.
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you.” Yinsen says without turning and Tony allows himself to lay back and glance over at the battery. It’s not shocking the way it had been when he lived this, but the clarity that he really has to go through it all again stings. Although he knows what’s under the bandages, he decides to play this out right. When everything is pulled off enough for him to see the metal protruding he almost wants to hitch off the bed again. Maybe it will start somewhere else this time, maybe it won't hurt so much, maybe he’ll get to skip the intro.
It’s that ‘about to face down the world with just my own two fists’ fire in his eyes, the one Tony fell for that first day. That righteous bite to his look that meant he was going to pass calculus whether Tony helped him or not, but that he intended to get the world’s worst T.A to take his job seriously. Which of course he did, because Steve could do absolutely everything he set his mind to. He could get someone that finished learning single variable calc when he was 8, actually looking at the material again. He could get the guy who scheduled office hours every second thursday from 12am-3am, hold test review for the entire class without more than two minutes of prompting.
When Coulson dies he feels Stark sag, curl around himself in sorrow. Steve wants nothing less than to hold him down, feels disgusted the feeling ever occurred to him. He doesn’t want Stark under him anymore, wants to hold him up somehow. There is a deep need in him to comfort, but his words don’t seem to work and before he can try to understand what things Stark needs to hear, they are rushing off again.
Yinsen’s pant leg is shredded and the entirety of his shin is covered in simultaneously congeling and flowing swaths of red. No wonder the man hesitated pre-flight.
Steve’s smile falters at that and he looks down at their joined hands. He is still angry, still hurt and surprised and confused, but more than anything he is happy. He is happy to be able to sit here like this, to touch and be touched, to finally know how much his best friend smirks.
He is so large and Tony wants him to use it, wants him to push and push until Tony is pressed so far into the wall he can do nothing but melt against every plane of Steve’s body. He wants to be handled and grasped too tight, wants bruises on his hips. He wants Steve to pick him up and grind into him and never, ever stop kissing him.
It stings, though Steve surely means nothing by it and Tony lets his weight fall more to his right and away from the furnace of their embrace. He pulls himself up a little taller, calling on all the years where this level of intoxication only meant he was ready to leave the pre-party.
“You think you’re a regular renegade hero, but look at you; world’s falling to shit, and the dumbass you haven’t spoken to in months is fishing you out of the snow by your ankles,” Steve smiles at him and lets his eyes close. Tony shakes him, but they don’t open. “Stay with me, Rogers. Look alive.” He begs shutting the face plate again to check his vitals. They are better now, good enough for Tony to scoop him up bridal style. When he looks down before taking off, Steve is smiling, small and soft and perfect.
“You’ll finish before even your due date.” Tony gladly takes the water and savors the lukewarm liquid. He simply nods and passes the canister back, taking a moment to crack his spine.
“You barely know me.” Tony points out, but his smile is brighter now. Steve can see the deep hue of purple under his eyes as they stretch up into his crow’s feet. Certainly, he new Tony was tired the moment he entered but the reality seems to be hitting him just now. He steps further away.
“Been busy.” Stark admits, still looking at Steve in bemusement. He eventually shakes his head and takes a sniff of the mug before bringing it to his lips and taking a generous swallow. Captivated, Steve watches his throat work through it and feels his own go completely dry.
“High praise.” Steve tells him, chuckling along and looking far too pleased at Tony’s inability to stop giggling. Fuck, he just looks so happy and Tony had something to do with that. He put that stupidly fond look on that far too beautiful face and he can’t stop the swell of pride.
Tony follows, clutching the mug tight to his chest to breathe in the steam and let the humid air lull his eyelid into drooping just the smallest amount. Steve is seated back on the couch and pulling the rest of his blanket fort back into place. The motions are smooth and easy, but he seems suddenly so terribly far away that Tony feels his whole body reaching forward in desperation.
Steve starts, eyes flickering over Tony’s entire face like he can’t help but doubt the intention in Tony’s words. He deflates a little and rubs at the back of his neck. “I haven’t been a very good friend lately.”
“Just the usual.” He offers, but feels a desire to really share. “Training, write ups. I got called in to run a few classes at SHIELD. I always like seeing the new recruits. They have a promising group coming up right now. I think a few of them will be great to have helping in the field.” Stark relaxes more and more as Steve continues and nods along to every sentence. It feels comfortable, familiar in a way that it shouldn’t.
The last five days feel like a fever dream and if it weren’t for the near constant tugging in his chest he would honestly write it all off as such. He is back in the tower, alone in what remains of the penthouse and looking out on the rubble of the world around him. Though, that is not the full truth. He is not really alone, hasn’t been since that flight back from Germany. Steve Rogers is somehow here, filled to the brim with so many emotions Tony can’t make sense of any of them. The guy is a tidal wave of feelings, all tucked neatly in ironed slacks and too tight button ups. Out there, somewhere past the border of Maryland, Rogers is hopeful and sad and awed in equal turns. If Tony focuses, he can almost trace the strange unbreakable thread that ties him to the Good Captain. It’s stretches impossibly long, miles and miles between them now.
“I don’t know what an IQ is, but I’m pretty sure you are exaggerating.” And he sounds it too, none of the embarrassment he radiated after the Wizard of Oz incident. Tony’d nearly hugged him after that cringy display.
“Please kiss me.” Someone says and Steve obeys, leans forward without thought and presses in to catch that bottom lip between his own.
“Don’t start a fight you can’t finish,” Tony says instead of opening the bottle he snatched up before retreating. “Or didn’t they teach you that in the army?”
“What happened?” Tony asks once the fire is stoked and filling the room with a pleasant warmth. Steve is still shivering, but the violence of the movements has subsided enough to calm Tony’s nerves. For a long moment the silence stretches and Tony wonders if Steve will ever tell him anything again.
That’s actually why he’d so readily gone with the whole trapped forever in hell spiel. Time travel just wasn’t possible, not with anything even slightly resembling current technologies. He knew it and still.
“Don’t worry platypus. It works great, all my stuff does.” Rhodey snorts half-heartedly. “Hey, the important stuff always does!” Another little chuckle and Tony pouts and turns his head away from Rhodey, but can’t hold it for long before grinning back at his friend. They smile at each other for a lot longer than deserved by the comment and yet not long enough at all. There are so many mistakes not yet made and Tony wants to bask in this easy brotherhood, without all of the baggage they will gather in the coming years.
“You are ridiculous.” She chokes out and then lets the chuckle bubble up until she is grinning and shaking her head. When Tony’s face breaks into a wide smile of his own she beams back large enough that her eyes crinkle nearly closed.
Although he knows the arc reactor so intimately he could probably build about 600 while hanging upside down and asleep, the resources are limited and he doesn’t have any of the tools of 2016. Plus, he is pretty sure synthesizing a new element would tip off the guards that he may not be building exactly what they are hoping. So, he melts down the palatium into a hand smoothed mold and resists the urge to flinch when he presses the device into his chest. Even though the poisoning is months and months away, he knows it is already starting. He clenches his fist tighter and reminds himself that every black line is really just dirt and oil, that he will get out of here again and already knows exactly how to save himself.
“Come out with me later,” Steve says suddenly and Tony finally gives in and locks their eyes. His smile is light, maybe not even forced. “I’ve got a craving for a good burger.”
“Sorry, Rhodey ate the other four.” Tony answers and promptly shoves the unwrapped burger almost fully into his mouth. He keeps his eyes skating through the crowd and starts walking towards the building’s front door.
Sometimes when they are like this, smiling and happy, she wonders what it would feel like to run her fingers through his hair and pull his face close. What it would feel like to bite down on his lip even while he continues to smile so radiantly at her. Wonders if maybe they could love each other, could make each other better.
“Tony, I–” It comes out fractured, punctuated by a sharp grasp of Steve’s fingers into the meet of his lower back. He drags his lips and tongue up the side of that perfect sharp jaw, brings his teeth into the equation just at the hinge of it. He tastes so outrageously good, it can’t be legal. Tony should alert the authorities, or just spend a solid twenty minutes licking and biting at the soft skin under his ear. If the hitching breath Steve is letting out is anything to go by, he certainly sides with that second option.
“You’re right,” Steve tells the now closed fridge door, his hand threatening to bend the handle. It takes a moment, long and stretching, but Steve turns back to stare him down. The sadness is back along with some impossibly deep something that pulls Tony right back into perpetual orbit.  “Can’t fault me for wanting to spend the holiday taking care of the best friend I actually know where to find.”
“I do.” A few of the others are milling about in front of the TV in the living room, but beyond waving at them no one says anything as they move into the kitchen. Steve lets him go to open the fridge and it feels so viscerally unfair that Tony blurts out the first thing that comes to mind.
"Tony, what– what do you do?" Steve asks after another long stretch of silence, Tony is almost asleep and responds without thinking.
“Woah, careful.” Tony is saying, but Steve can’t care, can’t do anything but pull Tony into his lap. He needs to have him in his arms again, needs to bury his nose in the side of his neck and just breathe. Tony is laughing, but it sounds unsure. He isn’t melting into Steve like he usually does and it makes his heart break. He just pulls Tony closer, pleads with his actions for Tony to hold him. “Well, hello to you too. Wanna tell me why you are baby koala-ing me?”
“Just eat,” Tony tells him and gathers another pair of meat and cheese. Steve gazes at Tony, but makes no move to feed himself and something about this is so poignant and yet so peaceful. When Steve is busy chewing, Tony will grab a few bites for himself. Otherwise he is dedicated wholly to Steve, interrupting occasionally to bring the mug up instead, speaking softly, “drink some water.”
“God, Tony. I want you so bad.” Steve blurts. For a second Tony just looks at him, but the words finally translate into some kind of meaning and his body suddenly sets itself on fire. His cheeks feel tight, the whole room gets so hot and Tony can hear the pounding of his heart in his ears. Steve just says it so sincerely, practically groans out the admission and Tony can’t figure out what on earth he is supposed to do with it.
“Alright, Tony,” Steve mutters sometimes, but mostly he is silent. They finish the plate and Tony stands. He can feel Steve’s eyes on him as he places the plate in the sink, as he stirs the pot and fills another mug with the tap water. Even so, it feels like a shock when he turns around to see Steve sitting just as he left him, gaze soft and focus fully on him.
"Tony?" Steve asks after mostly untangling himself from the blanket mountain. Tony looks up from watching the thick liquid trickle into his mug and sees Steve standing just outside the large doorway to the kitchen. He looks so young, almost amusingly tiny, standing barefoot with two blankets draped over his shoulders like decorative capes. His hair is stuck up on one side and he squints into the half light while scratching absently at his stomach.
“Try me?” She prods, gently and with that lovely little grin. It feels so good to be back to this place with her. After everything with the palladium and his less than stellar life choices, he sort of expected there to always be a wall up between them. He lied, kept so much from her and somehow she is still here, smiling at him with all that care of their long years together. It’s so different than what he feels joking around and fighting with Rhodey, but the love he has for her is just as strong, just as permanent and loyal.
“Are you fucking with me, Rogers?” Tony demands, but his hand is still in Steves and he makes no move to pull it away.
Natasha tells him to talk to Bruce about it because this forgetfulness shouldn’t be happening with the serum. She seems worried, but tries to put him at ease and lets him complain about how weird it all makes him feel. Before he leaves she tells him she will look into any causes herself. He doesn’t tell her all of it, does not go into detail about how strange Iron Man is acting. Still, even without all the information she has the best luck at pulling on the right strings.
That, of course, is when the man reveals his own ability to expand at will and swells up like a disturbing animal balloon. It happens too quickly and Steve can do nothing but watch as Pinstripe’s now five times larger fist collide with Iron Man mid air. The armor is sent flying into the nearest building with such a resounding thud, Steve’s ears ring for a few seconds. He is rushing after his friend before he can even think about it.
“Sure.” She says on a sigh, moving to tidy up the papers Tony had scattered earlier. Tony smiles at her, but feels himself stiffen when Rogers cuts everything off to start projecting surprise into their bond. It takes another entire ring before he answers and the whole thing is so agonizing, Tony almost has JARVIS hang up.
Tony actually comes to his floor to pick him up. Steve hears the elevator doors ping, hears him pace a few times in the foyer and tries to keep his grin under control when it takes the man a full forty seconds to knock. For a moment he considers waiting, considers making it seem like he hasn’t been sitting and staring at his watch for the past ten minutes in anticipation. Unfortunately, his body makes the decision for him and he is swinging open the door before Tony can even consider knocking again.
“Oh, you’ve seen it before?” Tony asks, but he is already turning back to the work he’d been so focused on earlier. His smile is firmly in place though, so Steve doesn’t bother to feel hurt by the sudden departure from their conversation.
“I’ll sober up a bit with some food in me,” Tony smiles, genuine like nothing else in his life. He steps closer, lets his knuckles brush against Steve’s sternum, knocks once. “And then we can play a game.”
Just as he thinks it, his chest pulls taught and he throws out a hand to grab Stark before the man can leave. “You’re not going alone!” And it is not just anger shaking his voice this time.
"Oh." Tony responds and it’s not really a question, but he still feels poised for an answer. His lips are suddenly so terribly dry and he licks them quickly before biting at the inside of his cheek.
At this point, Tony can barely be called an active participant in the kiss, he just opens and closes his mouth with Steve’s push and pull, sucks when he can, nibbles when skin catches between his teeth. It’s all happening in some animal part of his brain, well past conscious thought. His body is out of his control and he can’t even figure out where exactly his hands are other than some part of Steve. Sometimes it’s his shoulder, the solid meat at the juncture of it and his neck, sometimes it’s his back, the dip where his torso tapers in so beautifully. Other times it’s Steve’s hand, somehow sliding up Tony’s arm and locking their fingers together to squeeze it too tight, to press it into his cheek.
“Why on earth would he use my room?” Steve implores, managing to bring his face up in some attempt to seriously ask the question. Seeing the impassive mask along side the increasingly loud static prevents any real effort though. His side is starting to hurt, but his smile feels so nice. His other teammates make him happy nearly every day, but nothing can beat a good laugh with Iron Man. “Why on earth do you think I’d let him?”
“Oh, Tony.” He manages and his big hands are on Tony’s hips, firm and so very close to the bruising pressure Tony’s been wanting for weeks. It very nearly kills him. He can’t help it, can’t hope to do anything but grind down more. His thighs flex as he desperately tries to get some leverage in his knees, to tilt his pelvis enough to rub over Steve’s dick on the down stroke while still rubbing his own into Steve’s lower stomach on the way up.
“Right.” Tony mutters, then shakes his head and pulls what he can manage of himself together. He takes a deep breath, pulls their locked hands together than apart, before nudging Steve backward. Letting go of one hand, Tony turns and pulls Steve into the main living space.
“I-I don’t–” The spluttering is just as good as the embarrassment and Tony can’t help but wonder if a blush might be accompanying all of this. He chokes back another laugh, but can’t stop from shaking a bit with silent chuckles. This only seems to goad on more spluttering.
They are sticky, still half in their pants and it is only going to be a matter of time before Tony’s trapped hand starts to fall asleep. None of it matters though, it all just makes the world glow a bit brighter, makes the overhead light hue a soft and luxurious yellow. The couch is comfortable too and Tony is starting to consider the merits of just laying like this for the rest of his life when Steve shifts.
The question pulls him back a little and he turns to look at the far wall with a sigh. A good few minutes may help his anxiety, but the underlying issue is still there. Something is off with him and it may be nothing more than some strange bout of forgetfulness, but it is still worrying. It could be a sign of the serum failing in some way. He shakes that thought off and turns back to Iron Man.
“Steve.” Tony says with a poorly disguised laugh, which only makes Steve groan louder. His arms tighten around Tony’s middle and he burros further into the space where Tony’s neck and shoulder meet. Tony’s smile spreads and his chest seems to fill with something lighter than helium, ready to float away if not for Steve’s hold on him.
“I’m really fine not doing anything.” Falls out of Tony’s mouth and it seems that something important must have been some kind of speech filter or close your mouth processor, because more just tumbles out too. “I just wanna be close to you. Really, I can wait. I know we’ve established I have absolutely no patience at all, but I really don’t mind, Steve. We can wait as long as you want, hell, we could wait forever for all I care. It really doesn’t matter to me if we–.”
Steve lets out a long breath and turns to face him fully, lifting one knee onto the bed beside him. He pulls Tony’s free hand out of the air with his own and presses it down into Tony’s lap.
So, after kissing her on the cheek goodnight and yelling at Happy to make her get some dinner on the way home, he steps into the Malibu mansion alone and exhausted. He will later blame said exhaustion for jumping when a voice calls out to him from the walls, “It is so good to have you back Sir.”
He finishes scrubbing his hands clean and runs some of the water through his hair to make it fall a little neater on his head. It sticks up a bit too much in the front, but he can’t bring himself to care.
“Yeah?” Tony asks him, pulls his bottom lip between his teeth in that way that’s driven Steve crazy as long as he’s known him. He can’t help but lean further in to capture it between his own teeth. He delights in the soft gasp that earns him and soothes the bite with a slow swipe of his tongue. Tony melts a little deeper into his lap and Steve takes another long moment to just press their lips flush against each other. When he pulls back, Tony’s eyes are closed and he leans forward to chase his kiss before opening them.
“We don’t have to keep standing here.” Steve says a good thousand years later and Tony has to blink a few times before he can understand english again. He feels his body warm a little and takes the tiny step back allowed by his close proximity to the wall. His hands trail down Steve’s chest, before flopping down to his sides. He swings them back and forth and Steve chuckles before scooping them both up in his own. As always, Tony can feel the skin of his knuckles tingle as Steve rubs his thumbs along them.
“Look I’m sorry, really I am. It–” Tony starts, but Natasha is upon them and she doesn’t look surprised. Steve can’t take it, can’t look at her or Tony or that hole in the window anymore.
“I love you.” Tony tells him, fierce and more solid than his shaking voice should make possible. Steve feels water burning in his own eyes, watches as Tony’s face blurs out and then comes back into focus as the water toples out and down his cheeks. Tony wipes his away too.
“He’s alive.” He confirms, voice wavering before he coughs and lets out a long breath. “Looks like shit and the storms picked up enough that I can’t fly him out of here like this. It’ll be a day or two before you can pilot in here either.”
"Nothing, Tony it's fine really. Eventually I'll get hot and it'll go away." Steve shrugs, burrows deeper and has the audacity to smile weekly at Tony. And, okay, this is an out, a really easy hear-no-evil-see-no-evil out. Steve obviously has done this very dance before and understands the mechanisms. Tony could go back to his own little sitting room upstairs to enjoy his drink. Tony could step out and not mention it again, ignore the array of folded blankets that found their way slowly into this room over the last few months and pretend he never saw Steve buried under them with all the wariness of his 90 plus years. Tony could leave Steve alone and pretend he doesn’t understand that Steve specifically chose the common room to avoid that very thing.
Before he can even move to press the keypad there is a clatter followed closely by cursing from somewhere in the penthouse. It startles him enough to get him out of the elevator and the doors rush closed seconds after he steps off. If he weren’t so focused on finding the source of that noise, he would spare a minute to be annoyed with JARVIS for that.
“Think the stew is ready?” Steve asks after finishing his soft exploration of Tony’s neck and shoulders. Tony hums and stands up, moving to the stove and giving it another stir.
with him?” Pepper blurts, face screwed up in some mixture of shock and glee. The first one Tony can empathize with, but that last bit seems horribly unwarranted.
“You coming?” Tony asks as he reaches to his right and hits the button to open the doors, canting his hip to the side and widening his stance in invitation. With smoldering eyes, Steve stalks forward seemingly just as caught up in this sudden heat between them. Tony makes it into the elevator fully before Steve is upon him, pressing him up against the wall with all his weight.
Instead he smiles, genuine because Pepper deserves that, and says, “Your eyes are red.” But it’s not the same as last time, he isn’t teasing her. He is awed. Struck dumb, because there in the watery blue he sees all that same love. So long before they really started their dance and somehow she is looking at him with that patient tenderness he will find the breaking point for time and time again. It’s a younger, softer love than what he lost months ago and it knocks him sideways. “Tears for your long-lost boss?”
“Tony,” Steve whispears and it is cruel, so fucking cruel of him to use his name like they mean something again. It hangs there in the air, almost like the invitation it had become back when they were some kind of regular thing. Tony can’t bring himself to look up, even when Steve sighs and settles to rest against the wall beside him. “I wish you wouldn’t push us away like this.”
He steps back from the shattered window then, rubbing at the space just inches below the reactor when it flares with his retreat. When that first little side effect of their connection flared up, Tony was convinced it was some malfunction in the arc reactor. He’d made JARVIS run tests on it over and over before realizing not only was the ache unditectable for the AI, but also a bit too far down his sternum to be caused by his little medical inlay. Then it took only a few moments to connect the push and pull with Rogers’ nearness.
“Giammai.” Tony promises, eyes still terrified but voice filled with a strength that should be beyond such a small boy. It both comforts her and fills her with a new and more complicated sorrow.
“Well, I mean.” Tony begins, but all the wind is falling out of his sails. He shakes his head and bites his lip hard enough for the skin to go white under his teeth. “Listen, I’m not saying it would be forever, but I get that you won’t be able to trust me for a while.”
Steve blinks and searches back in his memory for the image of the artifact. It comes up, bright and focused like his memories should be, like they’ve been since that fateful day decades ago. That mission was simple, requiring just himself, Natasha and Thor. They brought back the strange stones that appeared after defeating the small group of visiting aliens. Those things have been in Tony’s workshop for more than three months now.
“I apologize, I stepped out of the room for a moment and Master Anthony came in to have one of the biscuits.” Jarvis explains in a rush, hurrying over and dropping down to extend an arm in extra support. Maria smiles dazedly at him because the world was just starting to list a bit to the right.
“I know, sweetheart.” Steve cuts in again, and his features are just as soft as they were back in the doorway. His face is still red and the spasm of his hands give away the tension still in his body, but he looks calm. He looks sure. “I know, but I want to. With you.”
Then Banner is cutting in and the mood is cut. They all freeze up at Banners words, but Steve has little time to process the horror of what the man says before Banner picks Loki’s staff.
“You try those new prisma colors yet?” Stark cuts in and Steve shakes himself out of his thoughts. He should just focus on having a nice conversation, instead of planning the tactical advantages of their possible friendship.
“Phase Two is SHIELD used the Cube to make weapons.” He announces, feeling a wash of pride as Stark’s eyes widen in surprise. The feeling only flows brighter when he gets a smirk from the man after turning to say, “Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow for me.”
“Or.” Steve cuts him off, only to shut his mouth and take a deep steadying breath through his nose. The exhale fans over Tony’s wet lips and that certainly should not be allowed ever. Steve’s hands unclench from the fabric at Tony’s back and slowly inch down, fingers getting closer and closer to the swell of Tony’s ass. It makes something, something important probably, short out in his brain. “You could
Rhodey moves to step away after walking him most of the way towards a waiting Pepper and Happy, but Tony grabs tight to the man’s sleeve. Feeling like a scared four year old he pleads silently when Rhodey looks at him before sighing with a pinched smile and a nod. Maybe he is a coward, but he can’t face his not really ex-girlfriend alone. Plus, if Rhodey leaves he won’t be able to punch Obadiah in the face when the jackass tries to hug Tony.
“He has connections Pep, more than even I know about. This is dangerous and I will not let you guys put yourselves at risk.” Tony all but pleads. She still looks angry, though there is more concern there and he thinks he may be able to separate her from the mess yet. “He doesn’t know I know anything yet. I have the advantage and if I can pull the information together, he won’t know anything hit him until they are carting him off.”
Steve’s hand feels amazing, palms silky smooth and fingers calloused from all his sketching and painting. Even with his eyes closed Tony would know that hand anywhere, can remember running his fingers along those knuckles and it makes it all so much better. Steve is jerking him off.
“Fuck, how long was your hand on there?” Rhodey asks after shoving the younger man’s entire arm under the spray of ice cold water. Tony is hissing at the contact and Rhodey remembers distantly something about using warm water to help the skin and twists the faucet.
“No better place to be in a blizzard,” Steve agrees and his arms press Tony flush against him. They are both hard, but it seems distant and unimportant.
The papers only spent two days tucked inside his pillow case, before Tony fashioned a crewd needle and seam ripper. After spending far too long striping the threads fraying away from his neckline and studying the precise in and out loops of the mattress seems, he’d fashioned the makeshift safe while Yinsen slept. And there the papers had stayed, for two weeks and four days, completely unknown.
“One more?” He asks, tilting his chin up and parting his lips because he knows how to play these games. Knows how to get Steve chuckling and leaning back down.
“Alright, alright. You are not going to like this, but…” he begins and then launches into a rushed summary of everything he told Rhodey. Like Rhodey there is a raw anger as the tale unfolds, but unlike him she actually seems completely shocked and he takes comfort that he is not the only one caught off guard by the betrayal. Happy says nothing but he also nearly crashes into a wall when Tony admits Stane is his prime suspect and his heavy breathing says just as much as Pepper’s cursing of the man.
“I’m kidding.” Rogers admits, smile finally breaking through his voice. A pause and Tony feels the little bead of concern before hearing it. “Though, it’s late there isn’t it.” Ah, must have checked the clock. The comment would normally have Tony rolling his eyes, but the man is nothing less than genuine. Something about it warms the genius to his toes.
He lets that shake, lets the conformation of his still secure secret reassure him and pulls his hands into his lap. They spend some time chatting aimlessly, both weary from Tony’s punishing pace. Yinsen keeps up well with the spontaneous jumps from welding to coding to relaxing that Tony makes multiple times a day, sometimes to the point where Tony assumes he knows exactly the deliberacy of each. As much as Tony would love to work through day and night until he nestless himself safely inside the preliminary Iron Man, an appearance must be upheld. If he works too hard and swiftly no amount of convenient pivoting and shadows would prevent the ten rings from noticing. Which could change things enough to make Tony and Yinsen’s escape just as rushed as last time. Just as bloody.
“I don’t see you naming anything that contradicts me.” Stark says and Steve shakes his head to get out of such maudlin thoughts. He can make up for it now, he can be the cause of that happy grin instead of someone believing it only comes with ulterior motives. He can open up himself and be genuine in a way he’s been avoiding since that first day.
Tony cuts him off before he can attempt anything though. Pressing two fingers to the small of his back, Tony guides him to the passenger door as it opens automatically. It feels absolutely absurd to be so moved by the gesture, but Steve’s grin grows more genuine all the same.
“Close it.” They can’t take any more chances, this has to end now and Steve feels horrible gut wrenching anguish as the ache in his chest abates. He cannot look away as the window collapses in around itself, stealing away something Steve feels only ever belong to him.
It happened too quickly. Too fast for him to do anything other than let out a little “Oh” before slumping forward and sliding down to the floor. The drag over the desk had ripped out the largest piece and he lost too much blood before even fully settling onto the ground. Really he should want to keep breathing, but he just doesn’t. The residue of every bad decision has been trapped in his lungs for too long and it’s finally dislodging itself.
They’ve only managed to see each other a handful of times since the rebuked training session. It certainly isn’t unusual to go a few weeks with only a few shared moments, but something about the lack of him is only adding to Steve’s worry. Even when they managed to catch each other, Iron Man is stiff and strangely on edge throughout. He hesitates before speaking and lets Steve lead their talks more than he ever used to. It is starting to fray at Steve’s edges and he needs to sort all this out if only to get his goofball of a best friend back.
It feels intimate, laying under Steve and looking into his eyes. He feels connected, feels seen and known and not rebuked for any of it. He feels desired and cared for and he loves how soft Steve’s hair is so very much.
"Okay, I don't wanna pry or poke at some weird super soldier psychosis or anything, but what the hell is up with the eskimo look you got going here?" Which, okay may have not be the gentlest way to get Steve back into the living room with him, but brash humor is Tony’s default setting. Poke hard, but in a funny place so you get their attention but can be indignant at their anger.
He’s still trying to tamp down on the urge to ask Steve to keep doing this with him forever, when he feels fingers brush along the line of his cheek. Steve is still supporting himself on both elbows, so he can only manage a light swipe with his finger tips. It burns all along Tony’s face all the same, takes up every shred of his focus.
“Steve?” Tony coughs out, luckily with no more blood than what is already dripping from the cut on his lip. Steve meets his now focused eyes and everything stops. Tony is Iron Man. Tony Stark is Iron Man and Steve knew this already, but he really really didn’t.
He feels his shoulders release and walks over to Steve, stopping right in front of him, close enough to have his leg’s brush against Steve’s knees. His hand lifts of its own accord, brushes across the hairs just barely falling over Steve’s forehead and smoothes them back until he can play with the ones at his nape. Steve just lets him, looks up at him with those beautiful baby blues and stays motionless.
“We can stop kissing.” Tony offers, but can’t muster much conviction for it. They both know it will only be a matter of time before Tony starts whining for a peck and then a couple more and then they will be right back here all over again. The first step in getting over an addiction is admitting you have one. Then again, Tony has absolutely no desire to even get the first meeting chip for this particular vice.
It is not until nearly a year later that she remembers the night. This time she is only a few minutes returned from a weekly lunch with the wives of the company board members and only slightly buzzed. No clambering or worried yells bring her to her son this time. Instead they happen upon each other in the front room for the first time since yesterday morning. The sight of her son is enough of a pleasant surprise that what exactly the young thing is doing does not register for several long moments. Then in a sudden burst the licking of the flames from the fireplace spit forward to cover more of Tony’s arms and she gasps in horror.
“Captain. To what do I owe this pleasure?” Tony finally asks, walking forward and gesturing for Steve to come in.
"Well, next time.” Tony’s voice is shaky and horse, but he is so comfortable that no matter how painful being held like this may be, he will not move for anything. “Next time, come find me. I'm not really good about the whole talking thing but. Well, I get it.” He uses his free hand to rub up along Steve’s bicep, slower than would be useful to warm it but it’s the only indulgence he will allow. As if this entire situation is not a huge indulgence. “Body heat is really the only thing that can get me through feeling that kind of numb. So, come find me. I won't judge you, I promise."
“Hi.” Tony blurts out, startled at Steve’s obvious urgency and it makes his entire body warm. It’s clear he is blushing when Tony bites his lips to keep back a chuckle. His eyes are soft though, warm and happy. If anything the flush seems to charm him and for all it is an involuntary reaction, Steve sort of wishes he could do it on command if only to keep that pleased look on Tony’s face.
The storm is getting worse every minute and the little feathered thing in Tony’s chest is dying with every empty patch of land he scans.
The occupants do not notice her. They face away, focused on the large sink in front of them. Jarvis holds a small squirming child on his hip, angled to hold both of the boy’s hands firmly under the spray. The child turns just enough for Maria to see the wet glimmering of one deep brown eye under the fringe of his unruly curls.
“Since Buck disappeared again...” Steve starts, but the wind falls out of his sails and he gives up before getting much of anywhere. Instead he leans back into the fridge, rubs both hands over his eyes and stares into the ceiling like he wants something to crash through it. Tony wants to tell him it’s alright, wants to tell him he knows exactly how much Barnes’ little ‘now you see me, now you don’t’ act is killing him. Nothing comes out of his mouth though, the possessive monster in his chest wont let him concede anything to the man that took Steve. No matter how much Steve never really belong to him. The warmth he left in Tony’s bed has long gone stale, but Tony still only sleeps on one side.
“Holy shit, holy shit.” He pants out, legs winding around Steve’s waist, heels digging into his tight round ass in the best possible way. “Jesus fuck, Steve. This is the single hottest thing any person has ever done in the history of the universe. Oh my god.”
They stay longer than anyone but Tony Stark would ever be allowed, lingering over coffee and dessert like they can’t just go back to the tower and sit in their black cushioned chairs to keep in each other’s company. Their hands have been laced together all night, Steve taking full advantage of the ambidexterity gifted to him by the serum.
The man bursts in with all the subtlety of a bomb, holding some tiny object in his left hand. Steve watches, consumed in his movements and distracting presence, as Stark commands the room around him while keeping all attention focused elsewhere. It’s nothing short of a marvel how precisely he guides their gazes and if Steve hadn’t been able to feel the exact moment Stark pressed his little object to the underside of the desk he would have never noticed. No one else seems to have caught it and Steve contemplates pointing it out, but Stark does not leave a breath a space between his words and Steve gets too caught up to say anything.
“We could, we definitely could.” In what world can Steve think Tony would say anything else? He’s been completely incapable of not plastering himself to Steve since that first kiss. Tony’s been held back on nothing but duct tape and sheer force of will. It takes Steve hours to leave sometimes because Tony just won’t stop kissing him and Steve honestly thinks for even a second that Tony wouldn’t be jumping at the chance to do literally anything with him? Tony goes to football games, volunteers at soup kitchens, and fucking watches shitty black and white movies for him. Tony will literally do anything in the world if it means Steve will just kiss him. “I am all about doing something, never much one for doing nothing, I–”
The doors open then and Steve blinks to see the penthouse living room. His blankets is still tossed over the couch, but it’s clearly been moved. He wonders if Tony knows it belongs to him, if he covers himself in the soft fabric and thinks of Steve.
“Haven’t seen you around in the last few days.” Instead of explaining the fresh mug, Steve takes a seat at the chair across the table and wishes he’d at least gotten a cup of juice to fiddle with.
“Sure. What are you thinking?” Steve immediately answers. He feels excited, pleased by the turn of events. He’s always wanted to actually go out for a meal together, but Iron Man couldn’t really partake in those sorts of things so he never asked. It’s something they can actually do now though, it makes him feel overfull.
The man is laughing maniacally, spouting nonsense about his loyal slugs. Steve is too busy avoiding the largest ones and trying to assist Thor and Iron Man to really pay it much mind. It takes some time, and the largest monsters are certainly getting in a good amount of building destruction as the team struggles to cut them through before they heal. The road is filling with a pungent tan slime for each eliminated slug, and moving is getting a little difficult. Still, they keep pushing forward and soon there are only two slugs left.
“Off, off.” Tony is saying, pawing at the sides of Steve’s jeans, yanking haphazardly while pushing up into the heat of him with his hips. “I need to touch you, please.”
“Don’t.” Steve cuts off and yanks Tony back so hard, their chests bump off each other and it’s all Tony can do to avoid colliding his chin with Steve’s forehead. It seems to shock both of them and when Tony cranes his neck to see Steve’s face his eyes are open wide. He just stares up at Tony for a long stretch, blotchy skin smoothing over into one bright shade of red.
He changes into a suit on the way, while Rhodey sits and watches Yinsen for him. A good dozen cuts line his face and about 98% of his body is a bruise, but the padding in the suit had been enough to avoid any broken or sprained limbs. Rhodey still has to help him stand from the wheelchair when the cargo doors open onto the landing bay of Edwards Air Force Base. Yinsen is wheeled away to the ground transport vehicles and Tony reluctantly allows himself to be separated from the man. For now.
They breathe, just lay there and breathe for a long stretch of liquid time. They sync up, in and out together as their heartbeats slow and the burning heat of the room starts to dissipate. Some external force moves Tony’s free arm, gets it wrapped around Steve’s back enough to rub down the length of it. It guides Tony’s head to tilt right and get his lips against Steve’s temple. He takes a deep inhale of the sent there, lets the sweat rub into his lips and savors every bit of it.
Tony pulls away from him, settles into his lap so they can see each other’s faces again. His skin is blotchy from crying, but his eyes are clear and warm. His smile is contagious, so bittersweet and beautiful. “I missed you so much, Steve.”
“You’ve been, you’re…” Steve hears someone say, too focused on pulling the chest plate off to realize the voice is his own. When it falls off, Tony heaves in greatful breaths, holding his non-gauntleted hand against his chest. Steve presses his own over it, feels a need to weave their fingers together, but instead pulls it off to feel at the ribs himself. Tony hisses at the pressure, but Steve can tell they are just bruised, no cracks or breaks. It should be a relief, but Steve feels fractured. He has done this for Tony so many times, he knows the exact span of each rib, he sees the arc reactor embedded in his chest and can’t muster any surprise.
“Agia who now?” He asks, voice slurring heavily. For a moment she considers insisting he retire for the night, but decides the data this event is currently producing is worth possible throw up on the carpet. Luckily she is not the one charged with cleaning something of that kind, though it would hardly be the most disgusting thing she’d cleaned out of silk Isfahan.
His eyes are half open, but Tony can’t make out any of his surroundings. The entire world is grey around the edges, unfocused except for the sensation of Steve’s open mouth on his throat. He is sucking hard, nibbling at the thin skin until Tony can
He is a danger to himself on the best days and an actual gift to humanity on his worst. Sometimes he will smile so softly and thank her so genuinely for assisting him that she actually feels a bit bad when he calls her Natalie. Other times his leer is so sharp and dripping in actual intent that she barely holds back from punching him square in the face.
Steve pulls back to look at him again, to pet his cheek and grin crookidly. Tony breathes in, shaky and more wet than he’ll ever admit too.
Only the widening of the armored man’s eyes and the pick up of his heart beat clues Steve in that this moment is somehow occurring to both of them. He feels tense, perched on some ledge while simultaneously free falling through open air. He feels full to bursting, overflowing with something complex and simple and consuming. Stark’s back is tightening, his fingers flex and relax, his throat clenches tightly around a shaky swallow and Steve can feel every single intricate movement as if he is suddenly a part of a new whole, a piece of a two body unit.
“I’m one of those people you are ignoring, too!” Steve finally shouts and whirls on Tony with a fire that usually means Tony will be on his knees before the minute is up. It sparks a harsh shiver and Tony swallows deeply, eyes caught on Steve’s like they have their own gravity and he is just cursed to forever orbit them. Something in Tony’s expression draws Steve up short and he deflates just as quickly as he’d ignited. Tony tries not to be disappointed when Steve closes his eyes and looks away. “Do you really think I’d let you wallow on Christmas Eve? I should like to think you know me better than that by now.”
It’s too soon to feel so sure about something, they haven’t even kissed each other. For all Steve knows there might be nothing there for them to share. Maybe they’ll kiss and it’ll feel awkward and uncomfortable, maybe Tony didn’t even mean for this to be a date. It should make him sweat, should make him want to pace and question if he should cancel. Instead he is grinning at himself like a fool and knowing with absolute certainty that kissing Tony will be the single best thing in the world.
Steve nods and then Tony is kissing him. His lips are salty and wet, but Steve could drown in them for all he cares. They kiss and kiss, mouths pressed hard enough to bruise, teeth and tongues and more passion than Steve can ever remember. He wants to fuse them together, wants to burrow himself into Tony’s skin and never leave. He went without this, he lost this and if Tony hadn’t tried so hard they may never have gotten it back.
“I’m fine. I’m- I’ll be fine.” Steve finally answers and forces himself to close the box. It makes it somewhat easier to stand up, to place it gently where he found it. Maybe if he thinks hard enough it will disappear.
“I just.” And he pauses, because he wants to tell her. Really, this is Pepper, his rock, his lighthouse in the distance. If anyone could take it, Pepper would be the girl. She would probably tell him he was overreacting and to just talk to Rogers about it. Would probably not even bat an eyelash at the situation and make Tony feel like it is completely normal and something he can totally handle.
Romanov finds them quickly and they are back in route to the Helicarrier. Stark says nothing to Steve, keeps his face plate down in fact, for the duration and runs off before the SHIELD agents finish taking Loki from them. It makes the line ache, but Steve can't think of any plausible reason for him to follow them man and instead falls into step with Romanov. She guides both him and Thor into a huge conference room, with glowing screens and a man in an unassuming button up and slacks cleaning his glasses.
“I just wanna kiss you.” Tony admits. It’s true, it’s all he wants to do. He wakes up wanting to find Steve and kiss him. He sits next to Steve at those stupid movie theaters and just wants to kiss his cheek, kiss his knuckles and his shoulder. He is so full of something, something both calm and desperate, and the only way to get it out is to kiss Steve.
For a few hours, everything seems completely normal. He sits at the glass dining and work table, makes himself a mid morning smoothie and drinks it while writing up the detailed debriefing. At one point, Bruce makes his way in and sits at the table to drink some tea and chat. Steve makes a few notes on the report as they talk, listens when Bruce describes his latest experiment and laughs along at the story of Stark messing up the previous step with an ill timed interruption.
“Shellhead, this is serious.” He tries, but a little hiccuping thing pops out after and they both dissolve into giggles again. “Come on, come on! I think something is going on.”
“He called it ‘The Dragon’.” She tells him, smirking genuinely as he rubs at his ears. She remembers how this particular shot makes it feel like steam is pouring out of them.
“You’re uncut.” He blurts even as his hand moves to Steve’s stomach, dipping lower and lower until he can grasp the base in his fist. Steve chokes out some half moaning noise, dipps his head down to see Tony’s hand on him. It makes Tony bold, makes him give a long slow jerk. The foreskin bunches up at the end, not quite covering the head, but pulls down over it when Tony drags his hand back down. Steve’s dick is so wet already, glistening in the low light between them and if Tony wasn’t so thoroughly enjoying his current position he would get his mouth on it.
“I’m not mad that you didn’t tell me. Well, I am, but that isn’t the point.” Steve starts, huffing out a breath but not dropping his hands, not even letting them twitch. There is no reason to lie, the truth will get his point across more anyways. “I told you knowing it wouldn’t change anything, Shellhead. I trust you.”
Suddenly, when they are standing closer than they’ve been since the quinjet, the tether pulls sharply. Something about that hurts and chills Steve to his very core. Stark is pulling away from him and it feels so wrong, so sickening. Just as Steve shifts his shoulder, tenses to lift his arms and yank Stark flush against him, Banner speaks.
“Alright, Stark, that’s it. Come on.” A heavy, but blissfully warm arm drapes itself over Tony’s shoulders and starts to direct him away from the bar.
“Ooo, that voice always makes me tingle.” He shoots back with a leer, but the ties fall loose and he pulls away the leather and sweat damp pages soon after. He thinks about trying to block view of the papers, but Rhodey’s eyes are so fixated on the blue glow that the effort is unnecessary.
It jostles them both, slides the soft skin of Steve’s still overwarm cock against Tony’s upper thigh. Something about that, about Steve’s now mostly flaccid dick rubbing along his skin is more intensely intimate than anything they’ve done so far. Tony shivers, gets is brain so fully caught on the idea that Steve makes it all the way up on his elbows before Tony notices the fresh air on his lower stomach.
Even so, every time Tony managed to make it out on the other side of death’s door he always swallowed down the guilt of Rhodey’s words. The “Your my brother Tony, my brother. No matter what shit we pull, you’ll always be family.” and “Tony, one of these days I’m not gonna find you. I won’t ever be able to stop looking” and “You are an idiot if you think anything will make me leave you.” They choke him now too, the same way they did the first night he started writing his secret papers. He wonders again what it says about him that a discarded oil drum will be his saving grace in two life times. Wonders how the universe knits such impossible coincidences.
Steve looks up at him again and Tony’s reaching seems to have only pushed the man farther away. His eyes are nearly glazed over and he spends several long breaths just staring at Tony, through and past him. Tension slowly bleeds in all around them and Tony’s eyes are getting watery from the steam, but he no longer remembers how to lower his arms. The walls of the room are in stark focus, the texture of the carpet too rough on Tony’s feet, the soft white light from the kitchen burning his peripheral. The room is far too aware of itself, the tension is sentient and staring down Tony with the same blue glaze of Steve’s eyes.
"Yeah." Steve answers immediately, voice muffled in Tony’s hair. If he minds the oil and sweat he does not comment.
They kiss again, gentle and languid. Tony traces the seam of Steve’s lips with his tongue and gently sucks on Steve’s when he returns the favor. They both taste of beef broth and potatoes, but their breaths are warm and sure. It lasts for decades.
At base he makes such a scene about the leather on his chest the field medic performs all her examinations without removing it. She also reassures him that Yinsen will be alright, that he stopped the blood loss in time, that the nerve damage from the belt should be minimal a good thousand times. Rhodey takes over for the poor girl on that once she finishes bandaging the various wounds the flight and captivity gave Tony.
“A what in your chest?” Rhodey’s voice is still sharp, but the confusion has replaced some of the tension in his shoulders.
When they are less talking and more running their fingers over each other’s, Steve suggests they call it an evening. He would feel bad about the lack of other patrons, but the waitress is smirking at him and Tony is leaving more tip than could ever be necessary. They take their time walking back to the Audi, steps slow and leisurely to draw out the time they can spend with their hands locked together. Tony tilts his head down to rest against Steve’s shoulder and there is no way on earth they weren’t built to fit together like this. Somehow the serum knew exactly how tall he needed to be for Tony to tuck so neatly into his side.
the exact shape of the words as they form in Stark’s mouth. It’s astonishingly insane and somehow no more unusual than the feel of his own teeth clenching together.
Tony unbuttons his suit jacket when he sits and Steve makes the comment he can feel sitting on the edge of his tongue. It makes Tony laugh like Steve knew it would and even though a part of him feels like that may have been cheating, the result makes him feel too warm for guilt.
He is losing track, lost and consumed, happily drowning in the slick slide of their mouths. Then Steve pulls back just enough to trail across Tony’s cheek and over to his ear. There is nothing to stop him, nothing for his lips to focus on and the sound is out before he can think to stop it. Cracking and breathy, it slips into the air like it has a life of its own and it might as well because Tony can’t be responsible for himself, let alone a noise. Steve is biting his earlobe and holy fuck it makes his body collapse, makes his shoulder drop and his back twist. His hips grind down harshly and Steve grunts.
Pepper is frankly quite shocked the first time she sees Tony’s scales and not enough of it can be credited to their existence. Most of the shock, in fact, is from realizing that this is the first time she’s actually seen Tony catch himself on fire. They’ve been working together for years, skirted the edge of a relationship and backed off more times than she can count and spent so much time together she’s pretty sure Tony’s face makes up about 40% of her visual memory. She’s seen him in all manor of insane moments and intimate positions, his naked body is familiar and they never even made it to the bedroom together. Yet, despite how recklessly Tony treats things like workshop safety and protocol, it is not until after taking the mantle of CEO that she actually witnesses Tony lighting himself on fire.
Steve wishes he’d followed right after him, wants to reach through the screen and comfort the Tony there. Even with the man cuddling into his chest as he watches, it feel like not enough. He pulls Tony closer into him even so.
Sliding his hand closer to Tony’s, he chances a glance up to see him mid sip and focused completely on the proximity of their hands. It makes Steve bold, fills his chest up with air and practically moves his hand of its own accord. Tony’s eyes immediately flicker up to meet his when Steve settles his palm over Tony’s fingers. Again, Steve can’t help but think that happiness looks beautiful on Tony. It softens every part of his face and makes his skin glow in the low candle light. His eyes are shining and Steve can make out flecks of green around the pupils. Those eyes are so warm, so captivating that Steve doesn’t feel Tony’s hand move until their fingers are already interlaced.
Tony laughs outright at that, because honestly for someone who clearly knew his way around the male anatomy, Steve could be remarkably precious. “You do know who you’re talking to, don’t you, Cap?”
One more acre comes up empty when the sensors flash, and Tony’s eyes lock onto the faint red and yellow blur.
“You can tell me, Cap.” Iron Man responds immediately, he leans forward a little and tilts his head. Knowing he has the man’s full attention, he tries again.
“Shouldn't try to breathe the coffee.” Steve remarks once he is back in his seat, watching Stark take small sips of the water between a couple more coughs. “If you need it that bad at least use an I.V.”
“Tony, Tony.” Is all Steve says back, over and over into the side of Tony’s face, into the crook of his neck and the underside of his jaw. Then his hips snap up so hard, Tony can feel it all the way up his arm and he is groaning so loud and long into Tony’s neck, it sends vibrations all along it.
They seperate this time, the tug aching painfully with every step Stark takes away from him. But, Steve spent most of his life consumed with some pain or another. Spent long winters and longer nights shivering and trembling against the never ending aches of his old frail body. Never once did that stop him from standing tall, standing up for the people that needed him. It does not stop him now.
“Deep breath in before you shoot it.” He nods solemnly and does as instructed, exaggerated but earnest. Then he tips back and pours the amber liquid back with more grace than the alcohol should allow. It’s exactly as she would expect and somehow still jarring.
“How, uh, what have you been doing lately?” Stark asks. His voice is a little awkward, but his smile is soft and inviting. All of his attention is on Steve and despite the stiffness to his posture, the genuine interest makes Steve grin back.
“We’re going to go eat some of that fancy food you payed for,” Steve tells him, friendly tone laid on a little too thick, but still nice enough. “And then, maybe, if you’re good, we can play a few games on that big screen upstairs.”
Nothing else seems forth coming, but he does not ask for another shot, so she probes. “When were you breathing fire?”
“How are you feeling?” Steve asks on a sigh and moves to sit just past Tony’s feet. The only thing he knows is this is his shellhead, his best friend. There have been so many battles, so many injuries that he never got to sit at his bedside for. It’s time to make up for that.
“I know it was him Rhodey.” The reassurance is not necessary and Tony feels a little lost at his friend’s reaction. Rhodey never told him. This rage is pure righteousness, something deep like satisfaction and horror at being right in the man’s dark eyes. How long had Rhodey believed Stane capable of something like this?
“Yeah?” He chances a kiss on Steve’s nose and gets a little chuckle for it. It’s such a silly gesture, something only his mom ever did when he was too small to really remember it clearly. He likes it though, likes the silliness, the sticky sweetness of it.
“Crap, crap. Water.” Tony yelps and springs to his feet, bowl clacking on the floor and wine sloshing out onto the forgotten pancakes. He wavers and Rhodey springs up to help him, even though his own legs feel about as solid as still liquid jello. “Where is water in this place?!”
“Tony?” Steve calls, crossing the living space and making his way into a wide hallway with four doors. One is cracked open and he can make out the rustle of blankets and clacking metal on wood. He considers turning to run again, because what can he even say at this point? He is still angry, but more than anything he just feels hopelessly confused. He wants to see Tony, he wants Tony to make it alright, he just wants to be in the same room as him. There is the sound of drawers slamming closed and then more intense rustling before it all stops.
“Yeah, I uh. Malfunction. I need, I have to go.” Iron Man responds, his words jerking out of him in quick bursts. He sounds frightened, sounds exactly like the time he pulled Steve out from under a collapsed fifteen story building, brown eyes wide in worry. He can still see the wetness pooling in them.
It’s clear they both know what Steve is really talking about, what he’s likely been talking about since the start of this conversation. It’s been going on for years now, since the first few weeks all of the original group were crashing in the tower. The first time was fast and rushing in its rhythm, something born of mutual frustration and too many sleepless nights. They never talked about it, still never really talk about it in more than abstract terms and innuendo. Whenever Tony is on the outs with Pepper and Steve is especially frustrated, or lonely, or some other goddamn reason Tony still can’t seem to pin down, they’ll lend each other their bodies. At least, that’s how it was in the beginning, some warmth between not really friends. Now though, now it feels like this fragile silent thing neither of them can let go. Their nights are longer and more frequent, the morning afters more languid and still they never outright say whether it matters or not. Tony half thinks Steve is punishing him and half thinks he is punishing himself. Its tortuous and beautiful and something Tony spends more time drinking about than not. He can’t stop it and can’t get the ‘more more more!’ that some possessive monster in his chest screams for everytime Steve leaves before breakfast.
Time ticks by slowly, the clipping of Tony’s fingers as they tap against the metal bed frame a distant thrum. Yinsen still faces perpetually forward, so much more silent than any time they’ve shared over the past weeks.
“Did you think I wouldn’t come if you needed me too?” He asks, just as gentle, just as solid. He lets one hand slide up over Steve’s throat and onto his cheek, traces a finger over the bone and down the line of his nose. “Steve.”
it purpling. The idea makes him shiver, makes him squeeze his legs around Steve’s waist and when did he wrap them around him? It’s perfect though, his center of gravity is off just enough that he has to hold onto Steve’s head for support, has to depend on the firm arms wrapped tightly around his torso to stay upright.
“You are such a spoilsport.” And maybe that is the heart of it. Maybe she is the problem, too uptight, too pulled together by years of clawing her way through and above the glass ceiling. Maybe she is too grounded and he is too high above it all, burning bright and blinding.
“One.” Steve nods and Tony shivers, shudders near violently because Steve is leaning back down and, oh god, he is so tall.
It is startling to realize, but he really means it. Stark is a beautiful man, someone Steve would have admired from a distance in a previous life. Beyond that though, he is fascinating. He can push Steve to a level of frustration that almost frightens him at times, but he can also make him smile faster than anyone but Iron Man. In the span of their thirty minute conversation, he’s managed to makes Steve completely forget about the strange problems of the last few days.
“You remember, really?” Tony says into his neck, breathing still harsh but more controlled now. He lets his grip loosen just a bit, lets his head leave Steve’s neck and stares at him. His eyes are red rimmed, but no less beautiful than they were by the candle light earlier. Steve smiles, knows he must look just as wrecked as he feels, but Tony grinns back. He looks so happy, so destroyed by his own joy. “God, you know?”
When Iron Man pauses to look him over after sitting down, Steve jumps right to his preferred topic of conversation. ”Can I talk to you about something.”
“Alright.” And Tony sort of wants to just let it drop there, let the silence creep in again. Of course Rogers seems unable to gather that from Tony’s lazy happiness and starts coiling up in awkward uncertainty.
She is busy reordering a stack of papers that require the R&D head’s signature and makes it fully through the glass doors of his workshop before taking in the sight before her. For a moment she holds her breath and considers if this really merits a comment or if it should be added to the list of things Tony Stark does that should be ignored. In the end she lets the curiosity of how he’ll explain his strange positioning win out.
At T minus 20 minutes they sit side by side, code fully uploaded and power sequence on stand by for start up. The crude bullet resistant vest Tony constructed is sewn into the lining of Yinsen’s waistcoat and fitted snugly against the thin man’s chest. Tony’s own body is cocooned in tightly tied leather, which securely presses a history of the next eight years into the small of his back. No words are spoken for long minutes, no words have been spoken for nearly an hour. Not since they sat down with nothing to do but wait and hold their breath against the adrenaline itching to rush into their veins.
“All of it.” Steve replies and catches Tony when he crumbles. His whole body collapses into Steve and he is gasping in deep breaths as he clutches Steve’s shirt in both hands. He presses in as close as they can, winds his legs around Steve’s waist and presses his face into Steve’s shoulder. Steve just holds him, grasps on just as tightly. How could he ever forget this?
consolation prize it’s the ability to compartmentalize, Steve turns to look at their prisoner and bodily forces his mind back on the task at hand. Something was bothering him before whatever just happened between them.
“Stark?” Tony looks up from examining his still full glass of scotch, his sixth of the night, and sees Steve leaning against the bar next to him. Damn does he look good, pale skin off set by the low red lights in this section of the party. It contrasts perfectly with his rich green dress shirt and grey slacks. He looks like the cover of some risque and vaguely holiday themed calendar. Tony can’t decide if its made better or worse by the fact that he knows exactly how that partially exposed collarbone tastes.
“How did you not feel it?” He can’t help but ask when they’ve been standing silently, aside from Tony’s whines of pain, at the sink for long moments.
They stay sitting like that for a while, just breathing against each other. It feels so good, feels as good as it always has everytime Steve gets to have him like this. He wants to fall asleep with Tony’s back pressed against his chest, wants to wrap his lover tight in his arms and keep him safe from all the loneliness. He can’t even begin to imagine how alone Tony must have felt, how much it killed him to see Steve and not be able to reach out. If Steve ever had to see Tony, ever had to watch him go about his day without being able to hold him… Well, he honestly wouldn’t be able to do it. Ever since the first night they spent together all those months ago, Steve’s known his arms were made to hold Tony. He knows his love for Tony is something that lives deep in his bones, something beyond conscious thought and memories. Even when he didn’t know what Tony meant to him, he wanted him. Ached to have him near.
Steve nods at that and lets his hand drop with unreasonable reluctance before moving back over to the fridge. He pulls two glasses from the cabinet, filling one with water for Stark and another with the juice he came in for in the first place.
“Tony, I remember.” Steve chokes out and he knows the minute Tony understands. The fingers in his hair freeze, the hand on his back spasms and clutches into the fabric of his shirt. He pulls back just enough to see Tony’s face, just enough to lift a hand from where it clutches Tony’s side and move it to cup his cheek instead. Tony’s eyes have been trying to tell him this whole time, wide and hopeful each time Steve looked at him. Steve runs a hand down Tony’s cheek and feels his chest tighten when his boyfriend shivers. “I remember everything, sweetheart.”
“Certainly, Sir.” And boy does JARVIS sound just as confused as Pepper looks. Tony, however, feels completely justified for the outburst. He is over feeling the guy fluctuate between wonder and soul crushing nostalgia every fifteen minutes. He is done waiting for the stupid lonely asshole to reach out to him and ask for some fucking company. Jesus! He told the guy to call whenever, gave him an actual business card with his personal number written on the back and everything. What more of an invitation could the man need? An actual wax sealed hand written letter inviting him to chew Tony’s ear off whenever he needed to chat? Honestly, Tony is about two more hours of this bullshit away from doing just that.
The world seems unable to hold any set tension though, and just as quickly as the anger bubbles up the whole ship rattles around them, metal exploding off somewhere in the near distance. He is suddenly in the entryway with Stark, helping him stand and rushing after him to find the man’s suit. Seamlessly they start working together, moving around the Helicarrier like they can anticipate each other’s every move. The entire world gets calmer and more focused, feeling this tug becomes a good thing as they fight to keep everything airborne.
“I know.” Steve mumbles directly into his skin and if it all wasn’t so adorable Tony might have spared a thought for how nice those lips felt back on his neck again.
