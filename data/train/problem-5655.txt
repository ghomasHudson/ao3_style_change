There was a terrible sound – the shield hitting the floor just the right angle, Tony knew that sound all too well by now.
Tony chose not to elaborate – not now, not yet – and if Steve really wanted to talk about it he'd have to wait, unless he didn't want to hear about what had happened with the Prometheus armor first, about why Tony was a prisoner of his own chestplate, why Pepper had called Captain America in the middle of a mission to tell him that something had happened to his lover and he had to come as soon as he was done with his current duties, why the second message had been more controlled but still clipped and noticeably tense.
“I have to know, Stark. With the situation as it is, with you being the most likely candidate to head Registration, I have to ask you.”
Steve wanted to argue, because it wasn't true, because he did his part and then others had to do theirs too, because it wasn't his job only to make sure the world was fair and good and perfect, because he couldn't do everything alone, in the end. But he remembered Manhattan on fire, the Baxter Building in the orange light of open battle, and the first responders going against him, because he'd had an enormous part in causing that situation, because he had been about to kill Stark, because, because, because...
A screen in the top right corner of the control wall – the one that showed his most recent history – caught Anthony's attention, and he raised his eyebrows. High.
Steve braced himself for the pain, and got up from the bed to take a look around. It hurt, yes, but, supersoldier. He could deal with a lot more than most people. Which meant that, yes, it hurt, but it was manageable.
It hurt, but it also made it all easier to bear with, in a way; the less Steve believed in him, the less he understood, the less Tony felt like a piece of shit for not agreeing with Captain America.
It was possible they'd forgotten. Steve had been gone more than a year. He'd been dead more than long enough that, once he'd come back, there had been a lot to catch up on – it had already been like that after the ice, when Steve had had to learn about the future, find his friends again, get up-to-date on the current threats to peace. Tony had been there to help him with that, and then Sharon, Sam, and everyone else.
He'd show them all what it really meant to be a hero – yes, even you, Stark – he'd do the right thing even towards the ones who wanted him jailed.
And, great, perfect, except Steve didn't remember any of that, and all the faith in Tony the other man had shown back there had, once again, been swept under a rug to be forgotten.
Things started going downhill pretty soon, though, even if most people involved wouldn't think so – things did get worse for Tony, if for no one else – as Tony saw his spirit waver, as his decision to keep himself out of the Avengers' lives took the first hit.
Which was – okay, Steve didn't have access to his internal monologues, but he had to know that people didn't actually follow Iron Man like they did Captain America, right? – ridiculous, and he did want to know what gave Steve that idea. Like, it couldn't be because Cap believed in him like that, because it was obvious that he didn't, or else they wouldn't be here – and Cap was the one who cared the most about Iron Man, so. Why the hell would anyone else follow him just because they thought he was right?
“Alright, I just... Well. Thanks for having looked out for Warbird. She might not feel like it right now, but you've done her a favor. She can't get better if she doesn't admit she has a problem, and obviously she isn't admitting anything right now, so someone had to point it out for her.”
Glaring at the newspapers wouldn't change the facts, though. Glaring at Bucky wouldn't, either. It was too late for that. Mistakes had been made, and...
Tony slowly turned around, waiting for the next attack on his life – or at least his physical well-being. Steve having surrendered didn't necessarily mean even the good guys all agreed with him. Or, the usual villains, but that had nothing to do with the current situation.
Questions he'd asked, back when he'd thought Tony had lost it, back when he thought Stark had sold them out.
Not entirely accurate, but who cared? Steve was alive, Iron Man was alive, that was what mattered and at least that way Steve would not be under the impression that logically someone had seen Iron Man's face. Not that Steve would track down said person – AKA T'Challa in this logical lite scenario – to force them to tell him what Iron Man looked like – good luck forcing T'Challa to do anything, to begin with, and anyway Steve did respect Iron Man's secret identity.
Tony Stark wasn't as good a man as Iron Man; however, Iron Man was as flawed a man as Tony Stark, and Cap had yet to see that.
It had been the “official story”, after all, and Steve knew how little that meant when it came to SHIELD.
Still. Regardless of what she felt about it all, there was something she'd said, and he needed to address it. Because Tony hadn't...
He had to wonder, really, how Steve could actually be so single-minded as to put it all on him, all the time, without failure nor remorse, and not even consider the possibility that perhaps there was a reason for it all, other than...
But what he was trying to say – without saying it – was that yeah, Iron Man did exactly what Tony told him to, because he was Tony Stark. Tony controlled Iron Man as much as anyone could control themselves.
Peter made a face, and looked back at the city. The tower gave them the opportunity to see all of Manhattan, something that hadn't been possible with the mansion – of course, a number of the Avengers, whatever the incarnation of the team, could fly, and those who couldn't did board the quinjet whenever the mission led them far away, so it wasn't like the view was uncommon, but still.
It was John Walker, of course, who said what they all thought. US Agent, who answered to Washington just as much as to the Avengers, if not more. Firepower wasn't leaving Tony's mind any time soon, as it was.
But this couldn't go on. Iron Man just couldn't always be here, especially when Tony Stark was supposed to be present too. Only a few days before, actually, Tony had almost given up being Iron Man – risking his life over and over again – and while he had come to his senses, there would eventually be a day he wouldn't be able to go on being the armored Avenger – if he wasn't killed before that, or if his heart didn't just stop beating either. Or maybe, just periods of time when he would need to take a break and not be Iron Man for a while – as much as Tony was the king of denial, he did know, rationally, that never taking a break would just add to the pressure until he couldn't take it anymore, and then good luck in helping anyone, or even in taking care of his responsabilities.
It wasn't even a lie. Cap was a good leader, and had proved it many times. But Tony Stark had never been on the field with Steve, he couldn't know that, not the way Iron Man did.
(I don't necessarily think Tony is always right, but I do think he's right about a lot more than people given him credit for, and a lot less wrong about a lot of things than you'd think)
Of course it did matter who was Iron Man. Tony had trusted very few people with the armor – Happy, occasionally, but not as a fighter, only for the two of them to appear at the same time, because Happy didn't have the training; Eddie March, but that hadn't lasted as the man had a medical condition that made it even more dangerous for him to go out there and fight as it had been for Tony to do it at the time; and Rhodey, who wasn't really at ease with being “Iron Man”, though Tony was toying with the idea of giving him an equivalent suit of armor with another name.
Had he done a good thing, giving Iron Man to the world? He thought he had. But he had no way of knowing that for certain, and it ate at him, especially now that he had been given a very concrete example of how Iron Man could be made into a weapon of evil, instead of a tool of good – something he had always known, but that he had not, at first, really known.
Not that anyone would believe Tony if he told them he was Iron Man – a bit like in that novel by Dostoyevsky, he wasn't quite sure which one, when an old and respected man confessed to the murder of the woman he loved and no one believed him, thinking he had become mad with grief, except in Tony's case people just couldn't believe him to be self-sacrifying enough to be even a little bit altruistic.
Not that Steve would have said any of that out loud, no, but he'd have pinched his lips and set his jaw in that special way that told you exactly what Captain America thought of Tony Stark.
Steve didn't like the look – pity – Carol gave him at that, especially as it really wasn't flattering – disgust, he thought, but he wasn't certain, and it was Carol, she knew him, she couldn't possibly think he really believed that not being 100% human meant you weren't a person, that changing into something else also made you someone else. She had to understand that it wasn't because of what Tony had become, but because of how he'd behaved afterwards – because that hadn't been Tony, it hadn't been, it had been just a shadow, Tony would never have done that, he wouldn't have...
Tony didn't move for what felt like a long time. Waiting for the next blow. For the explosion of anger, which wasn't coming.
“Who do you think you are?!? The rights and privileges of Avengers membership do not come with the armor automatically! Unless you'd want to claim those back, because the original Iron Man isn't quite as dead as Stark would have us believe?”
And that was only one of the reasons why he couldn't let anyone see the slightest weakness in his facade.
Tony blinked, and focused back on Steve. He was... He was happy to see him. Steve might not yet be his friend, not exactly at least – not that Steve knew, if anything – but there was no reason Tony Stark couldn't enquire on how the Avenger was doing, right? Especially after what had happened with Zemo. It was normal, decent human behavior, and...
It wasn't everyday that Tony had a good day, and he saw no reason not to be content about this one, even if it wasn't yet completely finished. All that was left was the signing of treaty and a public meeting.
“I... I like to think I... know a bit about that. Not being able to be... someone you've... been, for a while.”
The only reason he wasn't cutting the chase and not wasting anyone's time, even as he was convinced he would fail to control himself again, one day, was because he was a stubborn fool who thought he could do some good in between today and that moment to come, a stubborn idiot who refused to give up and disappoint people right now, even while knowing he'd just disappoint them worse latter on.
But it was alright. Rhodey would do well as Iron Man. Rhodey was the only one he could trust with the armor, with the skills of a pilot and the heart of a hero.
Iron Man was not guilty of murder, yes, but Tony Stark was guilty of negligence. And since Iron Man was Tony Stark...
The bullet wound in his collarbone made him grit his teeth – or was that the very possibility that Stark had done this? – and Steve closed his eyes for a moment, trying to focus.
“Ah, yes, power corrupts and all that. Please do not tell me what you thought about all of us who followed, because I don't want to hear it.”
And that may have been true, but. Tony was freaking stubborn, and being told he couldn't do anything, well. It always encouraged him to find an alternative – for some reason, Steve, Pepper, Rhodey and Happy, depending on who was here to berate him afterwards, never seemed to like that alternative, especially when it involved self-sacrifice. Wonder why.
Hell, the Mandarin had gotten it, but Tony's own friends didn't seem to even consider the possibility until they were confronted with seeing Iron Man without the faceplate.
“However, I'm well aware that my judgement is compromised, and more than that, I loathe being manipulated; I'll take it if it's for the greater good, but if it isn't, I'm not going to let Kang push me around. Which is why I need you to do something for me.”
For Steve to stop saying how much he believed in Iron Man, only to show how much he had no trust in his judgment, no intention to ask and understand why they might have differing opinions on something – Tony wasn't asking Steve to change his mind just because it was him saying so, but... It would be nice if Steve would be willing to consider he might not be entirely wrong.
Since Steve didn't actually have anything to answer to that without making it sound like his rights mattered more, he didn't comment on that part.
“Anyway. You have to consider, you've been telling everyone that superheroes don't need oversight, that they don't make mistakes, and that when they do they police themselves. That they know what is right and what is wrong.”
But there was no way Tony could say that and be listened to, not without saying who Iron Man was, not while admitting who Iron Man was, either – at least, this way Steve still had some faith in Iron Man left.
It would be perfect, just the right thing to say... If it was true. But Steve had already done his part, by helping Tony Stark, and it was obvious that no, he didn't have Iron Man's back, not inasmuch as Iron Man wasn't only Iron Man, but also the man standing here, and that Steve clearly disliked that man.
The weird feeling he'd had the first time around – it couldn't have been just a dream, no, not possible, not with everything else going on – didn't happen, and Steve didn't know what it meant, but he knew that it meant something.
The sky was dark with hints of red, and everything else was grey with the ashes of destruction. Tony couldn't smell the burned flesh and various other olfactory remnants of the explosion, but his suit showed him the exact composition of the air around him.
“No, it's okay. It's just that Mr. Stark was just here, asking me the same question, and he... and I...”
Even if Tony hadn't been his rich millionaire self – considering the fact that he created a company, Imperio Techworks, from scratch with Tamara and Tyree Robinson while being homeless, it wasn't like it would ever be a permanent situation, but let's assume for the sake of the hypothesis – he liked to think he wouldn't willingly and knowingly endanger strangers just for his own sake – probably not even for someone else, depending on the level of threat and the number of people in danger.
If at least the New Warriors had reacted to an attack by the four supervillains, instead of initiating it...
He looked at Steve, jaws aching as he gritted his teeth, the armor reporting scans of hundreds, thousands of victims, and that was just in the vicinity. How could he not understand, how could he not see it?
He patted Steve on the shoulder, trying for supportive, not-too-worried friend. Just so that Steve would pick up his general confidence – which, okay, was way lower than that, but they could manage to make it work, they could, if only they both worked on it – and maybe realize that not everything here was a witch hunt, that there actually were important points raised by Registration.
He never worked for the money, though it could be considered a comfortable advantage, and it was a necessary tool to constructing anything worthwile.
It was painfully obvious that Steve would never have agreed to what Hill was proposing – first of all because she didn't have the authority to do it, not yet, and even then he'd say no out of principle – but the situation would have been salvageable if she'd just said something about what a shame it was, and left him leave peacefully. But no, she'd had to go and try to get him arrested too – to get him killed, maybe, if he resisted too much – and now Steve had jumped off the Helicarrier and gone underground, which was a stupid, stupid move, and entirely understandable.
Steve woke up in a world, lived out his life here, and when he fell asleep, he woke back up in the second world, and when he fell asleep again, he woke back up in the first, and again, and again. Whether it was the night, a nap, or being knocked on the head – what? It happened – he changed worlds as soon as he fell unconscious. As far as he knew, the past was the same for both worlds.
Not only the ghost seemed to be able to tell whatever Steve was thinking, but he also knew things that had happened in the other world, things Steve hadn't explicitly thought about in this world.
Steve grinned at him, and Tony decided to just enjoy the advantages of only being Iron Man, and not himself.
Yeah, but. He already has a self-destruct plan, in case the world went crazy and decided someone like, say, Gyrich, should be at the head of SHRA – not that Gyrich was, in facts, a bad man, but while he didn't hate superheroes his level of distrust towards them was generally so counterproductive it could overshadow any actual good intent – and Tony had to destroy the database entirely and hightail it out of here, and while he might not need the memory feature, depending on the situation, he'd still have to get rid of the various armors he had left around the world, just in case, and for that he couldn't go with a quick delete.
Peter made a face, and Tony reflected that he was really glad he didn't have any memories of House of M, because that sounded really like something...
He wondered, though, whether Steve would be able to say the same and mean it. To mean, not only that he'd rather Bill Foster was alive, but that he had a hand in his death and he regretted it.
I'm sorry, Tony, I admire you and your dedication to making this world a better place in all and every possible ways, but I'm afraid I can't take the pressure that comes with it, so instead I'll let you to deal with it, alone. You understand, of course.
Tony leaned back a little, fell onto the mastress – he couldn't see Steve from down there, and maybe that was for the best.
“Who know, you might even be the original, though I have no idea how you got out if that's the case. So I'm telling you, as soon as I'm done with you, 'Stark', I'm going to look for V'ra, and I'm going to ruin whatever you were planning here. We're here, and it's too late, you can't do anything about it.”
The other him snorted, put the glass back down. Tony wondered if he'd touch it, if he reached out, if the glass was real, if the bourbon in it was real, if the reality of the glass and the alcohol could tell him that the man with his eyes and his beard and his anxiety behind his controlled face who was standing in his kitchen was in fact real, or if the hallucination could make him believe it had been in its hand when it had been on the counter all along.
Not true, and even if it was, he could still argue that someone needed to, and he didn't see Steve – or anyone else, for the matter, not since Rumiko – volunteering.
Tony almost looked at Don Blake, just to confirm what he had already known – and he wondered, once again, if the doctor had had the same suspicions, if, to Don Blake at least, that particular secret wasn't one at all even while the armor had held itself against the Molecule Man's frankly ridiculous power. He didn't, though, because that would be opening a door he had carefully kept locked for more than four years.
It wasn't like Tony wouldn't have let him keep his identity secret, had Steve not wanted him to know, had the situation allowed it. It wasn't as if someone knowing something about you entitled you to get the same information about them.
The best bet, Steve guessed, was to go and ask Pepper Potts. Miss Potts was definitely one of the most important people in Tony's life – from what Steve had gathered on the situation, they'd been pining after each other a long time before Steve even woke up from the ice, except Tony had had heart issues back then and his secret identity to deal with, and Pepper had eventually fallen in love with Tony's chauffeur, Happy Hogan.
He was hurting all over. Extremis was reconstructing about half his internal organs, the bruising from Steve's blows, the nerve damage from Vision's attack. It wasn't visible anymore, not after the first hour of advanced healing, but inside was another matter.
Just before leaving, Fury added that, after the assassination attempt – it hadn't been an attempt, not when Tony was dead, not even if Steve wasn't, just an assassination – they wouldn't get the chance to free him again, so he should really, really think about what he'd say at his trial.
He didn't point it out, because in the end, it was true that lives were more important. It was true, and yet it still had consequences, but that part Steve wouldn't want to talk about.
That was why, as Tony – Iron Man, as far as anyone else was concerned – brought the undersea craft back to New York, as Giant Man and Jan were spending time with the newly-awakened Steve Rogers and Thor was nowhere in sight, a small, vulnerable bundle of hope appeared in Tony's mind, and no matter what, the engineer couldn't let go of it.
Tony could understand fighting for your rights, but he drew the line at willingly endangering innocent people who had no means to defend themselves – when a supervillain started shit in the middle of a street, that was his fault, not the heroes', but here? Cloak had chosen the destination. And maybe he hadn't thought about it, maybe he hadn't realized what he was doing, but well, that was the exact problem of what had happened at Stamford with Nitro and the New Warriors, wasn't it?
“It's not the same thing. The law is the same for everyone, it's the facts of its application that aren't quite as perfect. SHRA was flawed, unfair, and completely unethical to begin with.”
Then again, it was entirely possible that some of the supers on their side with technological skills beyond what Steve could comprehend – Tony had been one of them, once, but Tony wasn't on their side, and Tony was dead – had all tried to go after the SHRA database the moment they got the opportunity, just to take it down. Except it hadn't been taken down, it had... Its access had been restricted to lawful inquiries – what did that entail, actually? A warrant from a judge? An order by the President? A decision by the Director of SHIELD? What did a lawful inquiry of the SHRA database mean, Tony?
Of course he'd have to deal with the consequences of Hill's entire lack of experience handling Captain America – or superheroes in general – because that was what he did, wasn't it?
Nick rolled his eye while he played with an unlit cigar that the president was eyeing distastefully.
Still entirely unable to trust – no, to even consider that maybe, this was the truth – Iron Man's word, uh?
The marshals were not, in this situation, the ones to be blamed. So he'd rather expect the – maybe not the best, but at least a certain measure of consideration towards him, because they were doing their jobs, and he knew all too well that sometimes being protected from the press could be a good thing, better than the alternative.
Steve managed to look up, past his own wound, to make sure that Tony was still over there, and not unmoving and unseeing on the ground next to him, to make sure...
Even if he, Tony Stark, wasn't really good at this – Iron Man, oddly, seemed to do better than him, but Tony knew the reason for that: people just didn't expect Iron Man to have ulterior motives, unlike Tony Stark. All he had to do was to show Cap that Tony Stark was genuinely concerned.
He also really, really needed to calm down and stop being so short-tempered with everyone. Sure, some slack could be given, considering his current situation, and the fact that he wasn't used to it yet – he hated that thought, but he had to consider it, because the possibility for him to actually find a way to walk again was... not that high. Some slack could be given.
“Good for them. I mean, sure, they could have told you, I guess, but they probably figured your dear friends had already told you, and you were being a self-righteous ass by asking that, of all things, to their faces. Anyway, your friends should really have told you themselves.”
Except the look hadn't left his face, and when Tony had risked a glance at him and their eyes had met, Steve had looked away.
Sure, he had hoped. Sure, he had had that wild idea that, perhaps, Steve would have had enough faith in Iron Man to believe that he knew what he was doing, Tony Stark's orders or not. Sure, he had thought that, maybe, something more important would have come up and Steve'd have been too busy dealing with it to get in his way.
Of course the identity he'd set up to feed to SHIELD back during his armor wars was to be brought up again. Not that “Randall Pierce” wasn't dead and buried after he'd faked “Iron Man”'s death, but yeah, he got the point.
Tony delicately put the lit matchstick in the glass, and watched as it slowly – at first – lit the alcohol. The fire was mostly blue, and it did not stop spreading until it was ligthing up the whole glass. He wondered how long he would have to keep his hand over it to actually get burned.
Tony didn't have much doubt about how this was going to be, when Steve had first called, but he sure as hell had hoped this would go better than this. Yet, there was a limit to what he could endure without definitely shattering Steve's illusion of righteousness and friendship with a single reveal that would make everything worse.
Maybe Nick had been busy doing something after their latest talk, and hadn't had the time to take control of his LMD to inform anyone of what was currently happening, of the fact that yes, Ma'am, he knew who was in the armor, who had done the killings, and wasn't it a bummer, Tony Stark had gone supervillain on them after all those years – not like it was the first time, mind you, there'd been that thing with Kang barely two years ago...
"It's all about control. Back then, he wanted all his technology. Last year it was a Cabinet post. Now he wants to run Registration. He wants that list of names. He wants to have everything, to know everything, to keep it all under his thumb.”
Iron Man excused himself from the team as soon as possible, and came back as Tony Stark just as the others arrived. He was going to greet Steve Rogers to Avengers Mansion himself. The man deserved that, after all he had done for the world, after what he had lived through, after he had been told there wasn't anything left of his world for him to go back to.
Misty took a moment to pause, to look him in the eyes – she wanted him to listen, to take the next words in, to be unable to deny what she'd told him, because it was going to be the truth, and he'd have to deal with it, and fuck it if he didn't like it.
Two seconds later, he was doing his best not to throw up on the rapidly diminishing crowd as – what was happening, what... oh. Falcon had gotten him and was trying to carry him out of there, Sam was here, despite the marshals shouting at him to get them down or they'd shoo...
Tony couldn't feel Steve's torso against his back, he only felt the supersoldier's breath against his neck, and the man's forehead resting against the back of his skull.
If the ghost had been here, he'd be telling him there was no point thinking that, because the reality wouldn't have been different, had Steve not read the goddamn newspapers.
Eyes to eyes, Iron Man and Captain America, for the first time – not Steve Rogers and Tony Stark, not Captain America and Tony Stark, no, Iron Man and Captain America, eyes to eyes, for the first time. No faceplates, no eyeslits, no glass between their gazes.
Tony considered pretending he wasn't actually injured, but his bruise was freaking purple and covered half his lower jaw, so.
The moment the door closed, leaving Steve alone – his head whipped around to stare at the ghost that was still sitting on the other side of the room.
As a man who knew he only had a limited amount of time left to live, he hugged back. That was what they both needed, right now.
He should... He should give Steve the overrides. Pepper and Rhodey had them – he'd thought about Happy, too, but the man had said he wasn't good enough at estimating if it was actually needed or not, he didn't want to blow it, so – but they weren't here right now, and he didn't want to endanger Pepper while he wasn't even sure if he was sane himself.
The skrulls scrambled into... action, he guessed. Most of them weren't warriors – perhaps that guy he knocked out first, but that was it – that much was clear, and Tony's basic combat training – he was an Avenger, after all, and couldn't always rely on his armor's capabilities, thanks Cap for that – was enough to take them out.
Which, okay. Like, obviously, if it would work, of course Tony would do that too. If something had to be destroyed, and he could bargain for it to be only himself, instead of everyone else, he'd do it.
Okay, no, definitely not friendly. Something was rotten in the state of SHIELD, and Tony was most likely going to end up dead or dissected – not that he was a particularly interesting human specimen, but who knew, maybe they'd changed their mind since last time.
He spotted the red dot before anyone else, of course. Right there, on the back of the marshal's jacket. He turned to look at the surrounding buildings – there, the open window, and the glint of light on metal – there wasn't any time.
Charles didn't comment on his identity, on the fact that he only had the mask with him and hadn't let go of it, or, later on, on the fact that he had a failing heart – after all, Charles himself was a cripple too.
He had no idea how they had followed him to Kang's Chronopolis, but wasn't particularly surprised: heroes were nothing if not resourceful, and Jan didn't seem to have bought his excuse when he'd taken over right after Tony had failed to explain to her why her fortune was in jeopardy.
In the end, with Steve, it wasn't so much “do what's right” than “do as I say”. Because what Steve said was right by virtue of having been said by him, wasn't it? If you didn't get the Steve Rogers Stamp of Approval, then obviously you were in the wrong. And, as Tony Stark would never – because he was Tony Stark, obviously – get the Steve Rogers Stamp of Approval, well.
He could, of course, reveal himself, but given the state and anger she was in, it probably wouldn't do any good – it might even pit her against Iron Man even more than she already was, seeing as no one wanted to consider that Tony Stark could be a hero, so obviously if Iron Man was Tony Stark then it meant Iron Man wasn't a hero.
Tony didn't say anything at first – what could he say, especially when he put himself in that situation to begin with? – and just watched as Steve refilled his beer, almost looking like he did it on purpose, to point out that Tony was an alcoholic on top of everything else, and just because of that he should just stay clear of the bar, out, far away from Steve and his righteousness.
Weird that he never put an automatic shutdown option in Extremis, it would come in handy in case of overwhelming suicidal urges. Or, you know, if someone tried to get him to do something terrible, to brainwash him into betraying everyone's secrets, to... Like, a thought, and lights out. No more Tony Stark.
Steve felt compulsed to nuance, but somehow, this time, it sounded weak even to his own ears. He wasn't sure why.
Their destined opportunity to fight without the faceplate, the two of them against the evil, megalomaniac, power-mongering Anthony Edward Stark? No loyalty to Iron Man's employer to keep them separate, the two of them – plus or minus a few dozens of superheroes – against the world? The epic end of a love story written in the stars?
“I'm not saying he's not. I'm certainly grateful for the things he's done for me, for us, for everyone.”
“You're asking yourself these questions, Tony, and I think that says a lot about who you can be, about your values and your intent to be better.”
His neck cracked as he stretched, and the engineer went to do what he did best – handle crisis no matter the personal cost, until he couldn't anymore and he was the one breaking into pieces, rather than everyone else's lives and safety.
Before he knew it, Misty told him to be well – he wasn't listening, he barely noticed – and Steve was standing alone, in the middle of the street, because, because, because.
Also, what was he supposed to answer to that? He couldn't be honest with Steve on that, he just couldn't, because if he did that, if he answered honestly, he didn't even see how Captain America, of all people, could end up liking him, even just a little bit. Tony was the worst advocate ever to defend Tony's personality – if honesty was involved; if not, he could do a very good job of presenting himself as a somewhat passable human being, decent enough, but mostly recognizable because of his great efficiency. But that was all he was, in the end: a tool, perhaps a highly valuable one, one that allowed people to be saved or helped often and efficiently, but still a tool – no matter how valuable, a tool could be sacrificed if it was to save a person, and though the sacrifice could end up being costly, it was still justified.
Steve... Steve was different. Steve inspired people. Steve inspired people, and was a good man, a man with principles, a man who wanted to do good, who inspired others to do good. There weren't enough such people out there. Steve wasn't replaceable.
Also, even if Emma wasn't quite on the same scale of comprehension as people like Tony or Reed – though, for Reed, you had to point him towards it, because a sense of human feelings was not something he was comfortable with – she was far from stupid – and unlike Steve, she'd faced prejudice for so long she was never going to believe in the goodness of the american people when it came to ensuring mutant safety. She knew what was coming, and she might not agree with Tony's approach, but she wasn't naive.
“Apparently Stark is so freaking clean he could star in a health commercial, if he didn't have a freaking lump of metal for a heart, of course. No amount of alcohol, or anything else for the matter. However, his body is acting as if it had processed about two liters of Vodquila just before he got at the Latverian representative's throat.”
But he understood. That was, after all, a necessary evil of his own choices. You couldn't be in control and at the same time expect people to see past the masks.
Tony – who thought he was being weirdly detached from the fact that he'd just died before his own eyes if you asked him – took a tentative step towards Captain America – he really didn't know what to say to that, and right now it just wasn't the time.
“We can... I can... we can protect you, the avengers. If it's blackmail, if he has something on you...”
Ah, there. Newspapers. Always a good thing, newspapers, for people who woke up after long enough a time – not because they were truthful, but because they showed you what the public opinion was, or, alternatively, what some people wanted it to be.
This wasn't good. This phone call hadn't been supposed to be about Tony, and yet here he was, making everything about himself. No, he had to stop it, he had to redirect the conversation...
The approximate moment it started, Steve would later suppose, was the morning of his trial. If he were to try to recall the exact situation of that morning, here was what it would look like: things being as they were, he'd woken up in the apartment / cell in Manhattan he'd been kept at after the first week in the Raft, after Stark had come by and stood as Steve had spewed the ugly truth at him, not even taking the helmet off.
“You told me you were pushed against a door, Tony. Not that you walked into it. So excuse me if I don't believe you. Now, tell me the truth: were you pressured into sabotaging my assets and otherwise bankrupting me?”
Her upper lip twitched, and she made a weird face that looked way too much like his weird face – even in her own form – for it to be reassuring.
Steve might not like him, but he wouldn't let him open to attacks when directly asked, so Tony was almost certain he'd agree to this. Cap was a good man, after all.
Tony just hoped he hadn't behaved too much like Iron Man, too familiar, during the lesson. He might have a very good control of himself, of his body language, but he wasn't a robot either, and sometimes he slipped up, especially when there was no immediate threat to deal with and no one's life was on the line.
He had to wonder, too, if somehow Howard hadn't been afraid that Tony would be too much like him, the man who had made a small fortune on his ideas of destruction alone, when faced with the memories of his father pushing him out of the country of the mind, of directing him unsuccessfully towards a more material way of living. Only a businessman, not an inventor of death.
Neither men could, of course, but they both knew what he meant. The arguments that had happened during the meeting, the arguments that were still going on when they'd left the “break”...
Not that T'Challa, King of Wakanda, had anything to fear in that regard. He wasn't, after all, concerned. He was a king, he wasn't American, and he had the power and the legitimity to deal with his own country's problems.
Yet, after some time, everyone acknowledged that nothing had actually changed, that he was, in fact, himself. Even Steve did.
Your people decided they were answerable to no one, that you being in the right meant the consequences of your actions were only for others to shoulder, that you could start a fight and pin the casualties on everyone else no matter your own part in it, that your rights trumped those of all the people who had no defense against you.
is fear, confusion, and an oppressive sense of predetermined failure which is-- for reasons Steve cannot determine-- also the nauseating scent of vita-cigars and outdated alpha's cologne. His shoulder aches with a phantom grasp of steel, the sort of congratulatory clasp which is also a warning.
A superstitious certainty has been growing in Steve ever since the medic called TOD. The instinct is embarrassing and immovable.
. Someone will eventually notice that Iron Man, genius playboy superhero philanthropist and creator of everyone's favorite homicidal AI, is missing.
"As you likely know, I am their frequent target," the engineer continues. "In fact, I've thought of investing in their drivel myself-- might as well get a cut of the money they're making off me." The prosaic tone melts into something steely, covered over with velvet only for Steve's benefit, "They won't be exploiting
There is a strange, hushed aspect to the display of suits, an inarticulate energy not unlike that which builds up in a shrine. It's doubly incongruous, given that their creator was by no means a man of faith. While he lived, the collection likely served to remind Tony of his own evolution (and genius, it must be said), of just how far he'd come from the sleepless, panic-laden nights whose feverish intensity had birthed the Mark II. Perhaps all victories take on a sanctified air, once the story is over.
"Good morning," Steve says quietly, at last deciding that a little courtesy can never go amiss.  The brown eyes regarding him soften, and the accompanying chuckle could never be mistaken for derisiveness. He'd look away, feeling rather exposed, but the only other real option is the high, ornate ceiling. The suite is as opulent as the chamber-staff have led him to believe; the enormous four-poster bed is draped in opaque linen, open only to the thick block-glass tile above. It gives the occupants an obliging view of the fountain one storey up, where fish flit about in the glow of dawn streaming down through the open courtyard and one way mirror. Guests on the next floor cannot see the newly bonded pair below, nor can the fish, who likely wouldn't care anyway. Now that he's in a position to think somewhat rationally, however, Steve finds the whole setup is making him feel very self-conscious.
Once, not too long ago and punctuated by impassioned kisses, Steve himself had called it a miracle-- the cheating of time and death, his own transformation, and everything in between.
had fallen for the bodyguard ruse was one thing but he, Steve, who fought at Iron Man's side? Something had stirred in him then, unstoppable and subcutaneous as magma. A legitimate heir to the Irish temper, or so his Ma always said, no doubt wondering at times if her son's frame could actually support certain levels of righteous indignation. He'd run hot after the initial revelation of 'Shell Head's identity, to the woe of more punching bags than he cares to admit. But it hadn't been anger that overwhelmed him so much as an addictive cocktail of loyalty, frustration, affection, and desire which even the serum could not dispel.
' Familiar words, easy enough to obey. A barrage of thumping on the bathroom door quickly ruins the nascent rhythm, though-- especially when Steve startles at the sound of his mate's voice drifting in from the other side.
Pull hard enough, dig enough, and you will always find a man behind the curtain-- of that, Tony is convinced. Though he is beyond eager to leave the tender auspices of his current captors, he will make every effort to procure a sample of this fluid so he can deconstruct the fuck out of it.
Dr. Cho's image is particularly difficult to look at. Steve actually met her-- just the once, but she was the sort of person who made an impression, the way one remembers a particularly vibrant sunset or graceful feat of architecture. It was, of course, one of those seemingly endless fundraisers and charity galas Tony used to drag him to.
It might not actually be a hallucination, maybe it was only pretending to be one, in order to trick him into lowering his guard. But, in that case, it was also a mind-reader.
The second thought was, obviously, that he really didn't want to go at it again with the ghost of Stark this early in the morning.
Maybe. After all, while entirely aware that things did tend to go wrong every now and then, Steve still managed to somehow believe everything would go alright and to have faith in people.
The was blood – a lot of blood – dripping down his forehead and onto the ground, but Steve couldn't see a wound, and that was good news, right? He wondered where the blood was coming from, but...
“You're included. He's an egomaniac on a goddamn power trip. This time it just happens to be legal. It's not as if he would care if it wasn't."
After a time, Steve – without stopping with the snuggling, of course – loosened his hold onto Tony and ruffled his hair.
“To start with, what do you have to say in response to those accusations Dugan made? I hear Cap isn't that happy with you, lately.”
“Surprisingly, not so much. I mean, okay, it's still complicated to go outside without getting arrested for people like me, read, idiots, who went and exposed themselves and then decided they might not be, in fact, okay with what it entailed, but mostly I'd have thought we'd all be in jail by, like, yesterday, now that Gyrich has Sentinels on top of everything else, but apparently the SHRA database is having issues, if Jess' sources are to be believed, you know, because it seems the database won't open without a valid reason, so they don't have access to our names unless we do something really bad. Same thing, all the videos of my face got corrupted, so they only have their memory to go by when they try to get me, and since I'm pretty forgettable...”
From what he'd gathered, the attempt against May Parker's life had been one of the reasons Peter had left the New Avengers a few months after Steve's death, but not the only reason. The fact that she'd survived, in the end, had helped, of course, but after the break-up between Peter and MJ – it hadn't lasted, and maybe it had been a good thing, too, because they seemed to be better than ever, now, after some time apart to think about things – and his secret identity that wasn't so secret anymore, Spider-Man had said he needed to stop crime-fighting for a while. He was back at it with Steve's return, though.
“We couldn't find you, though, since no one knows your identity. I guess Tony hadn't hired you yet, anyway, he'd barely created the superhero concept of Iron Man back in that reality. A bit like how he started it out here when he was a prisoner in Afghanistan and wore it himself the first time, right?”
He didn't wait for an answer, and maybe Steve would think him arrogant or whatever, but at least that way he didn't get to tell him he minded, or worse, to lie through his teeth and say he didn't, out of politeness – because then lying wasn't a problem, was it?
“You decided this doesn't concern you, T'Challa, or at least that it doesn't concern you in this way, when you claimed Wakanda's neutrality.”
The sound of glass cracking, of feathers and wings – did Falcon manage to call in his special reinforcements?
Steve finished his pizza, a sour taste in his mouth, before asking – because he still wasn't clear on what had happened exactly for that to end up this way, for SHRA to need a new head, because...
Tony locked himself into his room of the Mansion, took off the helmet, and sat with his head in his hands.
She squinted at him all the time it took the nurse to make sure Steve was alright, which, considering Steve wasn't telling her that Stark was right here even though he should be dead, was probably fair.
He reached down, opened his suitcase – just so that Hill and the president couldn't see what was in it, though Kooning was angled just wrong, which didn't matter because he already knew. At least, that way, they couldn't accuse him of reaching for a weapon – which he'd have gotten in here how exactly, though? – unless Kooning lied about what he was seeing. Which might be a good thing, if he did lie and Hill shot him on the spot as a consequence, it'd give fodder to the voices agaisnt SHRA, if a superhero who had come to willingly give up his identity was murdered under false pretenses inside the White House itself – enough to put a stop to it, or at least push it back long enough for Reed, Hank and a few others to spin it better.
The room he was in showed the sky, and it wasn't through a window. He knew what it was supposed to look like, and yet he still couldn't quite remember it, as all that came to his mind was the catalogue of the various destructions the room had seen over the years.
At least his mechanical heart hadn't given out, as it wasn't directly linked to the armor. Small mercies, he could still be kind of useful.
All of a sudden he felt like he'd ended up in a minefield and had no idea when or how exactly he'd gotten there. The obvious answer would be all the shit Carol and those who'd registered had gone through after Gyrich had taken the helm of SHRA, and before the Skrulls revealed themselves – Steve was a bit uncertain as to when exactly they'd gotten Gyrich himself, actually, but the consensus seemed to be that the real man had been in office for a time before he'd been taken too. The shit Tony hadn't been there to prevent, to make sure it didn't happen like he'd said he would while backing up Registration, the shit he'd walked out of.
Not that Tony could actually feel anything as Steve decided to use him as a punching ball – not after the “scrambler” and its effects.
The door slammed open, Tony saw someone who looked a bit like Agent Vera Lockhart pull a gun on Hank and shoot, except she was green and – oh, skrull – tears were flooding his eyes, except they were pink – crimson? – and he couldn't see right. One of his knees collapsed under him – left – and next thing he – didn't, because he was almost out at that point – knew his hand banged against the floor.
Bold words from a man who couldn't even consider being wrong about his profiling of a man he had never agreed to get to know, from a man who had just demonstrated how much control he thought he should have over someone else's life and opinions when those didn't go exactly as he pictured it in his perfect little world.
It wasn't like it was his first time being a cripple. It wasn't a new thing, per se, considering that being crippled extended to all sorts of physical handicaps, and cardiac problems as grave as the one he had had for three years after Afghanistan definitely counted.
Tony didn't even know why he was trying anymore, what with the way Steve was staring at him, looking like – looking like the mere idea was completely out there, like there was nothing less likely to happen than that, like it wasn't even the point and why was Iron Man even bringing it up?
He was in a rather rundown place, if clean enough, and the windows were borded up. There was Steve's uniform folded on an old chair by the door, as well as other clothes on the back of that chair, and a roll of bandages on the nightstand. He could hear voices from behind the wall, but right now he couldn't focus enough on what they said, let alone recognize then, supposing he even knew the people who were talking, which wasn't a given.
Steve would be mad, anyway, whether or not he died, because he'd probably learn who Iron Man was, then – after they'd recover his body, there wouldn't be anyone left to keep it a secret, and if he survived, Steve might still get up earlier than him and rush to make sure that Iron Man was going to make it and then...
He bit his lower lip, hidden behind the faceplate, and felt tears rolling along the edges of his eyes.
Simple, pure stupidity, and not from a person with powers who was simply defending themselves or even reacting, no, from an actual group of heroes who were supposed to know better.
It was incredible to hear Steve argue about his own righteousness when he had next to no clue as to what the situation really was like, when he could barely judge what was going on because he only had a fraction of all the factors.
“Where was Tony during all that? Did he think, what, that he didn't have any responsibility here? That he'd... done his job, and that was that?”
The last time they had seen each other, Tony had still been drinking. The last time they had seen each other, Tony had been too weak to understand – actually no, he understood alright, it was just that he hadn't been able to cope – that even not being good enough anymore wasn't an excuse, that of course he wasn't good enough, that it was even more his duty to try and fail at being better, because at least, in failure, he couldn't be blamed for not having tried.
But it was the first time it was so evident, so permanent. Even back when people had known about his health issues, even after he had been on the verge of dying in public, it hadn't been what people saw when they looked at him.
Of course there was always the issue that mind control came in various flavors, all of which didn't fall under the kind of threats he could protect himself from, but hey, no one ever accused him of not taking on a challenge.
He turned around a little to face Hill. He remembered Nick's words: efficient second, shitty leader.
How many slights aimed at Iron Man himself, whenever the subject went back to Tony Stark and Steve just couldn't figure out why, maybe, Iron Man didn't hold the same contempt he did for his boss?
Steve did not break the bowl he'd just taken to pour some milk in it – Stark's voice, even though the ghost wasn't saying anything about that, sneered in his ear that most unrespected prisoners in the galaxy weren't quite so coddled, and Steve did not reply that a gilded cage was still not freedom, but only because that conversation wasn't actually happening.
Tony went to the lab, put on the armor, and came back to the kitchen, all that without thinking about the fact that Steve was more comfortable being friend with the mask than with the man.
Tony closed his eyes, thinking of Firepower, years ago, of the fact that if they gave the people and the government the impression that they thought themselves above the law, there would be a reaction, there would be opposants who'd think themselves right to fear them, to herd them, and to kill them. And this time, everyone would be behind them.
She squinted at him, head tilted, and seemed to find something – facial expression? Stature, perhaps? – to justify a positive answer.
The asshole, at least, hadn't had to rely on an armor chestplate to stay alive – he wasn't sure the asshole had been happy, for all that, mostly because he couldn't remember how the asshole had felt, how he'd thought, and why he had done what he had done.
Maybe... Maybe he could make up something, a program that'd take everything he did in the day and put it in a summary that he'd go over at the end of the day, except he'd have to do it outside of Extremis, in case... in case he was the one responsible, because, as Kang's Tony Stark had demonstrated, there was always the risk that he was more or less conscious and therefore entirely able to undo any precaution he could make up.
The Kree Supreme Intelligence decided it had to kick-start Kree evolution by getting rid of all those whose genetics weren't good enough to survive the freaking bomb – no wonder Steve had survived, considering, but at the time they had gotten there and seen the disaster, the Avengers hadn't known exactly what had happened except that the whole planet was devastated – and Steve was of the opinion that they should just let the damned thing turned on. It wasn't even a person so much as a melting of thousands of consciousness, an egomaniacal computer, and while a case could be made about it having an actual sentience, like Vision, it was still a mass-murderer – how many times had the Avengers destroyed a version of Ultron?
Speaking of which, he should start to look into doing more research on medical issues, starting with actually useful wheelchairs and robotic limbs – yes, he already had some people on it, and he had designed a few things, as Misty Knight could tell you, but there had to be a way to do more.
Miss Potts glared him down again, and Steve shut up. He understood that, maybe she was angry at him – no maybe about it, she definitely was – but this... This wasn't all his fault. It wasn't... Tony had done his fair share of it, too. And Steve had been the one who'd ended up killed, not Tony, so really what was this about?
Or should he have let Steve's feelings pass before his own convictions? That wasn't a question Tony could bring himself to ask, no matter how true it actually was, because it was a cruel question, one that would either ask of Steve to reconsider his own certitudes, or of the both of them to part ways.
He had told Rhodey he had been wrong, but that was not the entire truth, if only because Rhodey's own life would have been put in danger, if anyone had seen that hint he'd told him about, that Tony Stark wasn't finished yet, and had wanted to interrogate him.
Steve was almost – almost – crying, Tony could see the glints of salted water on the edges of his eyelids – and the question, in the end, wasn't one at all. The supersoldier still believed this could all happen. He still thought there was an “us” in this story.
Before he could react she had a – spray, was that a spray? Tony wasn't feeling well, again, and considering that he'd still not felt that good and it was basically getting worse he really, really didn't like it – she was spraying his face and he felt wobbly for a moment.
it’s black, it could just be all the dirt stuck to its fur) whines pathetically. It lowers its face onto its paws, tail tucked between its legs and left ear flattened, giving him big soulful blue eyes.
Tony has seen a TV show once, a stupid competition where two teams competed to pump as much air as possible into a balloon without popping it, and the team who managed to make the biggest balloons wins. Rhodey reminds Tony of that one balloon, one more ill-advised pump away from going bang.
There’s a single loud juddering noise, like Rhodey has dropped the mobile, followed by an inarticulate tirade of invectives. Tony leans with his back against the brick wall, looking out of the mouth of the narrow alley, head turned unseeingly toward the grey-bricked shopfront with the red-and-white striped awning. The bakery sits on the other side of the road, popular with the locals for its rich, buttery Viennoisseries. Tony mostly ventures the store for its coffee and Jamelia Rodriguez, the pretty dark-skinned cashier.
.” He shifts himself to a more comfortable position, feeling the knots of tension in his back loosen. “Well, go on then. If you’re going to yell at me, I might as well be comfortable while you’re doing it.”
He waits, phone pressed to his ear, listening mindlessly to the rustling as Rhodey gathers himself and picks up his mobile. “I didn’t tell him,” Rhodey immediately says.
“I believed you when you said you didn’t know anything about it,” Tony says, sounding more defensive than warranted.
be the type to intentionally buy uncomfortable furniture for the sole purpose of making life harder for your visitors,” Steve says in annoyance.
Summer shifts incrementally to autumn. The leaves turn shades of reds and oranges and golds, shedding from their branches and carpeting the forest floor in a canopy encompassing all the colors of the sunset. Tony rakes up piles of them as tall as his hip solely for the purpose of watching his puppy frolic through them with gleeful abandon. He discovers a love of all things blueberry and bakeapples, and stocks up on jars and jars of jam to last him throughout the winter.
They both say some hateful, virulent things they don’t mean in the heat of the moment, and there are floods of manly tears from both sides. Nevertheless, slowly but surely, they get better at talking to each other instead of
“Don’t do that,” Tony tells Gerald, who rolls onto his back and bares his stomach for Pepper to scratch. “Don’t get all vainglorious with me just because you managed to get some bird to scratch your itch. It’s cheap and indecorous.”
Tony tidies up their mess in the kitchen, binning the leftovers and the takeaway carton boxes, appetite thoroughly gone. He feels sick and shaky. Steve’s motorbike is gone from the driveway. That’s probably the last time he’ll ever voluntarily seek out Tony again and their last conversation is a screaming match where Tony accused him of attempted murder.
At minimum, he really should have prepared for Steve, seeing as his former teammate is the reason Tony isn’t being escorted to an execution or a prison cell on the Raft right this instant.
“I couldn’t hear all of that,” Tony informs him in a solicitous tone. “But it sounded quite malicious. Don’t you know, Sourpatch? Words can hurt.”
He’s a glass bottle full of Coke and Mentos with the cap screwed on too tightly to pop off. He’s been undergoing nucleation, the pressure building up higher and higher until the first crack appears in the glass surface followed by the explosion: messy and sharp and dangerous.
Winter arrives in a flurry of snowflakes and a bitterly cold chill. Freshly fallen snow blankets every surface; freezing over the woodland earth; making Tony’s cabin look like a recently frosted gingerbread house or something that should be inside a snow-globe. The snow lades down the boughs of the varied evergreen trees – the overall effect is something that looks like it ought to belong on a postcard.
each other. It’s a process that would probably be substantially accelerated by seeking counselling, something which Pepper brings up once, and Tony responds about how he thinks that drowning on dry land sounds more pleasant.
“I know I’m not an evil person,” Tony says, which seems to surprise Steve into a fugacious silence. “I’ve made mistakes, yes. But I know I’m not Satan incarnate. If I was, you wouldn’t have fought so hard for me in court, and you wouldn’t be here now. But am I a
Tony pulls back the throttle and roars down the road, glad the helmet’s tinted visor conceals his face.
The cold metal biting into the flesh of her wrists, restraining them above and behind her. Sprawling at an awkward angle – too steep to lie on her back and not slide down until she’s dangling by the arms; the tilt of the machine at such an incline that she has to use her legs to support herself but remains unable to stand up completely. Her stomach aches at the point where she’s driven a dagger into herself, the stiches tugging at her skin. Zola on her right and the Red Skull at her left.
It’s almost sunset. The daylight has dimmed and the cheerful white clouds overhead have been highlighted orange. Dugan and Maria, standing only a few feet from each other, are debating at the top of their lungs about whether or not the faint rustling noise Dugan heard earlier was a squirrel or a cleverly concealed HYDRA agent. Tony swings the backpack over one shoulder, tucking the black bike helmet under his armpit.
“Commander Rogers!” Rhodey says, with an expression of unconvincing surprise. “What an unexpected… pleasure.”
This dicey and unspoken armistice lasts for all of a week before it pops like a shimmering soap bubble floating unwisely close to Gerald’s impish paws.
Tony inattentively starts to clean his grease-stained hands on the hem of his shirt – originally white, but now so stained with dark oil that never washes out that it resembles an abstract painting done in black dyes against a backdrop of grey canvas.
Tony sets down the TV remote safely on top of a shelf. Gerald paces in sulky circles at his feet. “Imagine that pain multiplied by a thousand,” Tony says. “That was what it felt like when Happy died.”
“That’s not what I-” Steve breaks off, pinching the bridge of his nose, looking like he’s nursing a headache. “This is getting is us nowhere.”
Tony takes care of Gerald, watches him grow from a downy-furred, pudgy, adorable gangly, tiny puppy to a downy-furred, pudgy, adorably gangly, slightly bigger puppy. He goes to work, impresses his boss so much that he has to turn down a raise – Dominique Owens is a veteran who still suffers from lingering PTSD, has five mouths to feed at home and one more on its way. He plans potatoes, turnips, and carrots in his meager garden. He collects his bronze 7-year sobriety chip. He calls Pepper and Rhodey.
Given the fact that the second to last time Tony has seen Steve before his death was when they were beating the snot out of each other in the middle of New York city, buildings collapsing and vehicles going up in flames all around them, the 180 degree U-turn Steve’s attitude has taken is downright alarming and had Tony questioning whether anyone has checked him for signs of mind-control or Skrull impersonation.
Well. No use in any sort of pretense now. Tony meets Steve’s goggling eyes head on and says firmly, with no chance of misinterpretation. “Pepper and Rhodey will be sleeping with me. In both the literal and biblical sense.”
“Circumstances required me to think of you as an enemy,” Tony says, in a remote and detached voice that makes him hate himself just a little more. “We were both forced to think that the other was liable to do some pretty crummy things. But I liked to think that even then, I knew you too well for you to lie to my face and be able to get away with it.”
“I assume you don’t feel too bad about Rogers being there if you still have the energy to be this insufferable. Phew. For a moment there, I was getting worried.”
“Sounds like a hard man to love, your buddy Wilson. He can give Pepper and Rhodey lessons.” Tony scoffs. “You know that before I gave him the shield, Barnes broke into my office on the Helicarrier and did his best to murder me?”
