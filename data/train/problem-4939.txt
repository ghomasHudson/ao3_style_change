“Maybe
Dean flushed a little, a burnt edge creeping into his scent, though probably only Castiel was attuned enough to every nuance of Dean to detect it. He controlled himself well.
Jack's eyes immediately lit up. "Yeah! Can I soon?"
Dean pressed Castiel down into the couch cushions, and Castiel felt the man's arousal firm and unmistakable against his thigh. He shifted so that Dean would know beyond a doubt that he wanted this just as much. Dean groaned into his mouth.
Dean laughed and buried his face in Castiel's sweaty hair. They cuddled in silence for a while. Dean's softening cock slipped out of Castiel, and the mingled come and lube started to seep out too. Not the most pleasant sensation in the world, but he was way too blissed out to care.
Dean broke the silence first. "We can go back to the top of the list now if you want."
Castiel knew now that trusting Luc had been rather naïve of him, but mating the dick certainly wouldn't have made the situation
Castiel's brain short circuited for a moment from that mental image, and Dean laughed at the look on his face and shoved him gently toward Claire's room.
Castiel groggily half surfaced from sleep and automatically reached for Dean. His hand found empty air. Not only was there no warm alpha to snuggle up to. The other half of the bed seemed to be missing as well. He rolled over and encountered a wall made of squashy cushions. He was lying on a sofa, and not one of the sofas in the bunker judging by the neutral, fresh-from-the-packaging smell of the fabric only faintly overlaid with his own scent. At that point his brain stopped taking things like safety for granted and woke him up the rest of the way.
Sam smiled. "You sound just like Dean."
Paradis (no, I didn't forget the e) is French for heaven. It seemed an appropriate name for a French restaurant staffed by angels.
"So," Castiel took a deep breath, feeling the giddy tingle of hope once again, "you think we can win?"
"Honey, I'm home," Cas called as he shouldered the front door open, his hands full of bags. It was only sort of a joke.
“Is that going to be a problem for you?”
Cas realized he was staring and tore his eyes away from the work of art that was the man's body (in more ways than one) to focus on his face. "Why are you doing this?" he blurted out before he could stop himself.
Sure enough, Claire looked up from her pancakes and nodded enthusiastically.
"The gay thing. Yes. They're absolutely certain that I'm going to hell." He shrugged. "For all I know, they may be right, but it doesn't matter. Dean is well worth that."
"Okay." He breathed another sigh of relief, but he knew it was only a temporary reprieve. So this was parenthood. A state of near constant dread, hyper-aware of just how many bad things were lurking out there in the world. "So what are you doing out of bed? Did you have a bad dream?"
"Shepherd's pie? Are we running a diner?"
again.”
He heard Dean's sharp, surprised inhale, but he kept his eyes closed and his lips pressed against Dean's, waiting, praying that he hadn't just made a terrible mistake. Then Dean made a little noise halfway between a sigh and a moan. His hand cupped the back of Cas's head, pulling him as close as the table between them allowed, and his tongue lightly traced Cas's lower lip, a request, not a demand.
That's all, folks. Honestly, I could probably keep going with this one indefinitely, it was so much fun, but I have a lot of ideas, and I decided when I started that Sam's wedding would be the end point, so I'm sticking with that. For now at least.
The uncertainty in his voice broke Castiel's heart, and it was suddenly a very good thing that they were sitting on the same side of the booth because it meant he barely had to move to press his lips to Dean's in a deep, warm, reassuring kiss. "If I was breaking up with you, would I do that?" he said when they parted.
He jumped and spun around, almost crashing into Dean's solid chest.
"If you're busy, I can —" He shouldn't have called. He was going to come off all pathetic and clingy, like he couldn't cope on his own for a few days. He had coped with much worse than this on his own. Except … Except back then he hadn't had a choice. There was no one to call. And now there was. What was the point of having a boyfriend if you couldn't call him when you were having a bad day?
~o0o~
In the living room there was a small gallery of family photos, and right in the middle, all the other pictures orbiting around it, was a woman who could only be Dean’s mother. They had the same eyes, and the same brilliant smile. In the picture she was laughing, and she even tilted her head back the same way Dean did when he laughed. If there had been any lingering doubt, it was banished by the fact that she was sitting on the hood of a very familiar jet black Chevy Impala.
, who has ever had the privilege of seeing you like this?"
"Okay. Night, Cas. See you tomorrow."
“I’m not,” Dean said, all thoughts of airports and little brothers fleeing his mind in the face of that blue, blue gaze. “Is seven okay? There’s a little diner on Fourth Street called Pam’s that does really good burgers.”
“Cas?” Dean said worriedly, and Cas felt gentle fingers carding through his hair. “Baby, you okay?”
"Yes, in a way." She looked down at her baby, and a soft smile of pure love curved her lips. "She's my job now. I don't want to miss a second of this. Her name is Rose Marie. I wanted to name her Rosemary, but Josh thought it was too old fashioned, so we compromised, and we probably would have ended up calling her Rosie anyway."
He nodded and popped four pieces of bread into a good old fashioned toaster with no buttons or flashing lights. Then he poured himself a coffee and sat down next to Cas, close enough that their shoulders brushed. "What?" he said.
"Come here. Let me do that." Dean took the strip of white silk from Sam's shaking hands, deftly knotted it around his neck, and straightened his collar.
Dean opened his mouth to object, but Castiel was already correcting.
When Dean rested his hands on Cas's hips and bent to scent his neck, Cas gave a shaky sigh and whimpered, "Dean. Please."
“You did seem a little distracted,” Cas said with a smirk. “Do you think you’re ready, Dean?”
Dean didn't try to move right away. He just sat there on Castiel's cock, and Castiel rubbed his thighs, soothing the muscles which must already be aching from this position. They stared into each other's eyes for long minutes, reveling in the closeness, no clothes, no condoms, no need to act professional.
“No. Who would I bring? Everyone I know is already invited.”
Castiel tried to imagine what that must have felt like. His brain supplied an image of Dean lying in a pool of blood, and he quickly shut down that line of thought. "So you killed Brady?"
Cas tilted his head, frowning in puzzlement. "Your parents don't approve of Sam?" What could they possibly disapprove of? A handsome young lawyer, kind and even tempered, completely devoted to their daughter. He was even the "right" gender if they cared about that.
"We gotta sing the snowman song," Jack said as they started rolling the first big ball for the snowman's base.
"You know, Dean," Sam said as they all took seats, "I get why you didn't tell Dad, but you could have told
"I love you too." Dean laid his head on Cas's chest, listening to his heartbeat. "I'm sorry I hid this from you for so long."
husband, and he is as kind and compassionate and good hearted as he is gorgeous. You can't tell me I'm not the luckiest man on Earth."
' traditional French vibe and not too much of a strain on the budget. Usually he would have enjoyed the challenge, but today his heart wasn't in it. It was too busy missing his boyfriend.
“No, I, um … I already looked you up,” Dean admitted. “Love the boots, by the way. Do you actually wear those, or was that just PR for the website?”
He was rewarded with the most brilliant smile he'd gotten out of her yet. Then she abruptly stopped walking, pulled her hand out of his, and dug in her pocket for her notepad and pencil. She'd taken to carrying them everywhere with her, but she still only used writing when she had a question she couldn't figure out how to mime. Such as,
The thing was that despite (or perhaps because of) his promiscuity, this was one kind of sex he hadn't had a lot of. Hadn't had at all really. The closest he'd come was with Lisa, and even that was nothing like this. He hadn't been in love with Lisa. She was safety and comfort when he was raw and aching. She was, as wrong as it sounded, like the mother who had been taken from him so long ago. He had gone to her bed because he was lonely and she was willing and never demanded anything from him that he couldn't give. And maybe also because he could tell how much she wanted him, and he felt guilty for taking and taking and giving her nothing in return. But even then his heart had belonged to the blue eyed angel who now lay, sleepy and sated, in his arms.
"It's okay, Cas," Dean cut him off gently before Cas could go into full on babble mode. "I'd like to be your friend. If you want to be mine."
Sam blinked. "Is that all? I was expecting something a lot kinkier from the buildup."
"Who's Sam?" Gabe asked, either unaware or unashamed that he was intruding on a private moment. With Gabe it was probably a little of both.
"Surprisingly well. It helps that at her age romance is a very nebulous concept anyway. It's an adult thing, so it comes as no surprise to her that it's more complicated than she realized. And now that that part's taken care of, I thought maybe we could go out to lunch one day while Claire's in school."
Once they were naked and pressed against each other, Dean sliding one lubed finger in and out of Castiel while peppering his face with kisses that were more affectionate than sexual, Castiel's impatience settled into a quiet enjoyment of the closeness. He had always considered himself more of a top. Getting fucked could feel good, but not good enough to make up for the messy and slightly embarrassing experience of letting someone else shove their fingers up your ass while you tried to both relax and stay hard. Clearly though, he hadn't been doing it right because Dean somehow managed to make anal prep sexy and intimate. They were both lying on their sides facing each other, gazing into each other's eyes, and Castiel had no trouble staying relaxed. He could fall asleep like this, finger up his ass and all.
"And lonely I imagine." He didn't really have to imagine, but he'd rather not get into that right now.
Dean nodded. "Yeah, that too. I manage to keep in touch with a few people, but it's not the same as having friends you can actually hang out with."
The movie was still playing, but the volume was low so it wouldn't wake Claire, and the wet sounds of lips and tongues getting thoroughly acquainted, plus the occasional moan or whimper when one of them found a particularly sensitive spot, effectively drowned out everything else. Those big hands that Castiel had been secretly (or apparently not so secretly) admiring for weeks slid under his shirt, and they felt exactly as good as he'd imagined, rough but gentle and undeniably masculine. A calloused thumb rubbed over his nipple, and he gasped, sucking breath directly from Dean's mouth which tasted like chocolate and caramel.
They were driving over to Dean's place so Dean could get things ready. Sam's parole officer would be inspecting his living accommodations, and among other things, Dean couldn't have any alcohol in the apartment.
It took him a few tries to locate Dean's prostate, but Dean was already riding high on the glorious feeling of Cas inside him and their combined scents swirling around them in a heady cocktail that smelled to Dean like
“Hello, Nick,” Cas said awkwardly.
"Not until after you've eaten," Castiel replied firmly. When Dean tensed a little beside him (almost imperceptible except to someone who was as attuned to Dean as Castiel was), Castiel paused in pulling up the restaurant's website and turned his full attention to his sub again. "I'm not avoiding it, Dean. I promise we'll talk about everything soon, but first I need to make sure you're not in imminent danger of dropping. And I'm hungry too."
They broke apart, both breathless and laughing. "I'm coming, Jack," Cas called.
"Okay," Dean said, shuffling awkwardly backwards toward the door. "If you need anything I'm right across the hall."
didn't want to kill the mood.
He felt Cas smile against his neck, and the omega's scent got a little bit happier although it was hard to tell under the stronger odors of musk, sweat, slick, and come that pervaded the air.
The realization probably would have scared him more if his brain wasn't swimming in a groggy post-coital nap fog.
Cas seized onto this nice, safe topic. "Not exactly. Photography was what I wanted to do, and technically it
"Shit." He grabbed a towel and swiped at the drop of molten lava that was eating its way through layers of skin. It was far from the worst injury he'd ever gotten on the job, but he wasn't in a glass-half-full kind of mood.
By the time they arrived at Michael and Hannah's house on a quiet street in a neighborhood Castiel could never afford in his wildest dreams, dark was falling and it was snowing in earnest. Dean pulled into the driveway behind Hannah's SUV, probably worried about a snow plow dinging Baby if he parked on the street.
Benny sighed, sending a puff of static through the phone. "Yeah, I hear that. Lord knows I was glad Andrea and me didn't have any kids when we split."
Cas had no idea what he meant by that, but Charlie did. “In his room,” she said as she crouched down to introduce herself to Grace. “Jess called while you were in the shower, and, um … She sounded upset. I think she’s fighting with her parents about the wedding again.”
"Yeah," Dean said and held him a little tighter. "Okay."
He found wipes in the adjoining bathroom, took care of the sticky mess on his stomach and between his legs, then went back to the bed and gently cleaned Cas, trying not to jostle him too much.
"Do you … want something to drink? Water, beer … I think I have some mint tea left from the last time my brother visited."
children." Michael cocked his head. "Can't he? There's no reason a healthy young alpha like yourself wouldn't be able to give him as many babies as his heart desires. I mean, it's obvious that
"Thank you," Castiel said, taking the dish. "I'm sure it will be delicious. I'll put it in the oven with the rest of the food while I finish setting the table."
That certainly motivated Dean to get moving.
“It’s okay,” Cas reassured him. “I believe you. Can we pick this up another time? Because I was really enjoying your company.”
trying to be secretive," Dean put in. "We were starting to think you were all incredibly oblivious."
"There was a fire in our new house," Sam said. He was still holding Jess tightly even though she was starting to calm down, and he looked pale and shaken. "Thankfully no one was there. We hadn't even moved any of our stuff in yet. It could have been much worse. But it's gonna take months to make the place livable again, and —"
He turned to find Sam's fiancee Jess standing behind him, holding two glasses of iced tea. He'd been introduced to her when he arrived, and she was exactly what he'd expected — tall, gorgeous, intelligent, and kind hearted. In a way she reminded him of Dean. Less shy, but she had that same genuine innocence, a pure soul shining out of her warm brown eyes.
the fuck out of me. I was planning to use some of my fuck on my boyfriend the next time I see him. Haven't gotten much alone time with him lately."
"It seems that you could today," Cas said, turning his head a little and scenting Dean's wrist, soothing his inner omega's lingering unease with undeniable evidence of his alpha's devotion.
“Believe me, they are worse than either,” Cas said darkly. “But there is one silver lining to all this.”
They had both lost their shirts about halfway between the kitchen and the bedroom, and Cas now rolled Dean onto his back and began exploring his tattoos. With his tongue. "How long did all this take?" he murmured as he kissed the blood red rose that sat directly over Dean's heart, the spiral of its petals formed by the words,
“My car. Is it ready?”
"Oh," Cas said, and he looked a little sheepish.
~o0o~
"Oh, I, um… I don't drink," Dean lied impulsively. He had a feeling he should keep all his brain cells in working order around Michael.
Castiel almost choked on a bite of chicken as he burst out laughing. "You did
the kind of bad influence a boy like Jack doesn't need."
“Is she okay?” Dean asked, genuinely concerned. He liked that dog, and she was clearly very important to Cas.
Dean swore his heart actually skipped a beat. While he would have happily bottomed for Cas for the rest of his life, he couldn't deny that the idea of being buried deep inside that lithe, muscular body, feeling Cas clench around him, hearing him moan when Dean hit the sweet spot, was very,
"So he hasn't driven you crazy yet?" Anna said teasingly to Dean.
For a heart stopping instant, Castiel thought it was the bite, thought that Dean had somehow accidentally mated him without either of them noticing. Then he realized that after two and a half hours in the enclosed space of the Impala with Dean, the alpha's scent must be all over him. Jack had been exposed to it plenty on his visits to the townhouse, of course, but there it had been diffused over a relatively large area and lacked the visceral immediacy of the alpha's physical presence. Every time Jack visited, Dean spent the weekend away at Sam's, Charlie's, or Benny's so as not to intrude on Castiel's limited father-son bonding time.
reference was deliberate before Cas’s fingers were replaced by something bigger. He wrapped his legs around Cas’s waist, trembling and gasping. It was almost more than he could stand.
should
Dean got a very strange look on his face. Cas couldn’t decide if it was pleased, confused, or both. “I’m not …” He looked away again, his cheeks flaming. “I’m not very experienced, Cas. I’ve only been with three guys, and one of them I don’t really remember it cause I was really drunk. And you’ve obviously been around a bit. I’m not judging. I’m just saying I don’t know if I’m gonna live up to your expectations.”
They were at Cas’s place, a cozy little two story townhouse adjoining the store. Cas lived alone except for Grace (who was currently shut out of the bedroom and not happy about it), so they wouldn’t have to worry about volume control or awkward encounters with certain little brothers.
"He was dying."
Those words, the look, that laugh, and the smoky alpha scent mingled with the heady aroma of the whiskey — it was all way too reminiscent of John.
"A girl." Dean smirked.
His phone rang. He snatched it up, hoping it might be Dean. Phone sex was way better than lonely masturbation even if the process was basically the same. But when he saw the number for Claire's school, all thoughts of getting off fled his mind, replaced with every worst case scenario his imagination could conjure up. He fumbled to mute Julia Child and answer the call at the same time, almost dropping the phone.
"One night, me and Ruby were out working the clubs. I was high as a kite, but Ruby had me driving so she could count the money. She never let me handle the money. And … Well, I don't remember it clearly. I remember a bright light and feeling the car spin out of control, and then I woke up handcuffed to a hospital bed. They told me Ruby was dead, and since I was driving while intoxicated, I was being charged with second degree murder. I did the only thing I could think of. I called Dean. And he did exactly what I always knew he would. He spent almost every penny of his savings to get me a good lawyer and pay for my treatment. If you ask him, he'll say he doesn't regret it, and he'll mean it. But
Claire peered suspiciously out from behind Dean.
“Cas.” Dean took Cas’s face between his hands and looked him steadily in the eyes. “There’s only one thing I care about here. Do
Castiel smiled at the bittersweet memory. "And if you hadn't sat next to me in that Psych 101 class, I probably would have dropped out." No one else at their small community college had been interested in befriending the nineteen year old, pregnant, unmated omega. Only Dean had looked at his face instead of his belly. Only Dean had bothered to get to know him instead of assuming he was just a slut.
Another nod, this one accompanied by a faint whimper.
"You're an angel," he said. It felt strange to wrap his tongue around empty air instead of the solid warmth of Cas' cock.
Dean's eyebrows rose and a small, bemused smile quirked his lips. "Yeah," he said, drawing out the word a little. "If they both want to."
Dean ducked his head, grinning and blushing, and god, he was so adorable. Castiel just wanted to cover his pink face with kisses. But he didn't want them to get distracted when they were finally making progress and actually
"If you think he doesn't like you too, you're blind. He looks at you like you hung the moon."
. Being human was so confusing.
"What's going on?" Sam demanded as soon as Dean hung up. "Is it Cas?"
“I’m okay,” he assured her, but he leaned against her, burying his face in her fur. “I’m okay. No matter what happens,
Sam had expected Cas to be tired and sad, probably still a little weak from whatever illness or injury he had suffered. (Dean's texts had been stubbornly vague, just repeatedly insisting that Cas was on the mend and they would come home as soon as he was "well enough to travel" whatever that meant.) The ex-angel did look tired, but not sad. Not in the slightest. As he followed Dean down the steps to the war room, he gazed around him in wide eyed wonder. He was perhaps moving a bit slower than usual, but not like he was in pain. It was just that before there had always been something slightly supernatural in the way Cas moved, the utter confidence of a celestial being who had never had to worry about stubbed toes or banged shins. Now he was walking like an ordinary person, thinking about where he was putting his feet. There was no lingering hint of illness in his scent either. He seemed happy and healthy if a little worn out.
Castiel turned and almost immediately forgot what the question had been. The fridge was big but still a relatively small space for two grown men to share, and the forced proximity plus the cold made Castiel suddenly acutely aware of Dean's body, how big and warm and solid it was. God, what would it feel like to be pinned under that broad chest or to wake cuddled up against it?
“Hey, hey, hey,” Dean said, pushing him gently back down onto the step. “A few more minutes won’t make a difference now. Besides, you’re the boss. You can’t exactly get fired. What’s wrong, babe? Why were you crying?”
Naomi's expression soured a little at this revelation, but she managed to sound almost sincere when she said, "Then thank you, Dean, for your contribution to this lovely meal."
"No, I think she means the third one," Dean said. "Strawberry? Is that what you want, kiddo?"

"So basically there's no down side."
"So … you wouldn't mind if Charlie stuck around? Indefinitely?" Dean tightened his arm around Cas's waist. If he had to choose between them, he had no idea what he would do.

"Yeah, I can't make it tomorrow. I've got a thing. So we came today instead." He sat down on a couch, hoping John would leave it at that, but of course he wasn't that lucky.
"But I don't." Castiel held Dean tighter, trying to take the sting out of the words. "I know what I want to believe, but I don't
going to talk about their respective pasts. When they were both ready. And in the meantime they could kiss and hold hands and talk about everything else or just sit in silence, enjoying each other's mere existence. It brought him a sense of peace and safety that he had never felt with a partner before, not even the ones he'd stayed with for years.
“Dammit, Charlie, haven’t you ever heard of knocking?” Dean grumbled.
While they were loading the dishwasher, Dean sidled up behind Castiel and wrapped strong arms around his waist. "Thank you," he murmured. "You have no idea how much it means to me that you did this."
~o0o~
Dean's hands were braced on Castiel's chest, pressing down so hard they might leave marks. Oh, he hoped so. He wished he could stay inside Dean forever, but eventually a warning tightness in his balls and a building pressure in his gut reminded him why that wasn't an option. Dean was close too, his cock leaking a steady stream of pre-come and twitching violently with every touch to his prostate. "Are you ready to come for me, Dean?" Castiel panted. "Do you need me to touch you?"
“It is not the same,” Michael hissed, obviously struggling to keep his voice down. He was flushing red with anger now, and it made him look more human but also less handsome. “Be reasonable, Castiel.”
Dean laughed. "I don't know about that, but if I ever do open my own place, I'd definitely do lots of comfort food. This shepherd's pie is pretty damn good too by the way." He helped himself to another generous scoop.
don't want to know, but as your lawyer, I have to ask. How compromising exactly?"
up. I will never leave you by choice. Not that way or any other. I promise."
"Okay," Dean said, and for the first time that night Cas actually felt completely okay.
"Did you have a good Christmas?" Castiel asked as he tucked a clean, pajama-clad little alpha into bed.
Dean smiled and bent to kiss him again, but he pulled back just before their lips touched. "That wasn't a wish. You don't … you don't have to."
"Dean!" Sam snapped as the unpleasant smell grew stronger.
Cas barely had to move to cover Dean’s mouth with his, and holy shit, it was a thousand times better than he’d imagined. Dean’s lips were soft and warm, and when they opened to Cas’s gently probing tongue, he discovered that Dean tasted like an ocean breeze, salty and complex and refreshing. He couldn’t contain the little moan of pleasure that rose up in his throat.
"Can I help with anything?" Dean asked, but at that moment Claire ran over and started tugging on his arm, wordlessly demanding that he come look at her tree and her presents.
Dean stared at him open mouthed for a moment, then said, "Yeah. Okay."
Cas nodded eagerly, partly because he really would feel better if he knew how to defend himself, but mostly because of the opportunity to spend more time with Dean. "Yes. Yes, I'd like that."
"Well, the whole appearing in a puff of smoke thing was a pretty big clue. Plus, you kind of look like a genie with the baggy pants and the pointy shoes."
"Mm-hmm. And garlic mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy. And I picked up dessert from that little bakery you like. Salted caramel apple pie."
"Or for you from the look of it," Sam said, eyeing the blood soaked rag tied around Cas's arm.
He tried to find a happy place in his mind, to block out everything, but part of him was still here, waiting for the familiar hard weight of a dick in his mouth. He wasn't at all aroused by the prospect. In fact he was wondering if he would ever be able to give a blowjob again without thinking of this. He did normally enjoy sucking a guy off, loved the warm, salty taste and the rush of power that came from controlling another man's pleasure like that. Underneath the all consuming fear stirred a tiny spark of anger at this stupid, bigoted redneck for taking that away from him.
anything tonight? I'm kind of worn out."
"Mmm." It was more a contented purr than an answer, but Dean decided it was close enough.
She nodded and reluctantly let him go. He felt her eyes following him all the way across the kitchen.
"No," Castiel said quickly. Then he realized that that wasn't completely true. "Well, not exactly. It's … It's not you. It's Naomi."
"Oh. Right." The man's smile faltered for half a second, but then it reappeared, brighter and more charming than before. "Dean Winchester. Your new sous chef."
Those words on Dean's beautiful lips would probably never fail to bring a smile to Castiel's face, not even if he heard them a million times. "I love you, too," he said, and watched an answering smile bloom on Dean's face, matched by the joy suffusing the alpha's scent.
Castiel smiled mischievously. "It's a surprise."
She was still frowning.
Dean regained control first, and he laughed when Castiel chased after his lips. "Whoa. Slow down there, cowboy. No sex on the first date, remember?"
It was a gray, drizzly Sunday, and their lunch date had turned into an extended nooner. While they worked up the energy for round three, they were talking about everything and anything that they didn’t already know about each other. They had covered favorite movies (Cas:
"Yes." Cas swallowed the last bite of his burger and cleaned his fingers with a napkin. "Dean, they're going to be newlyweds. Much as they love you, they're gonna want their privacy."
." Dean took Castiel's face between his hands and looked him in the eye. "I'm not going anywhere," he said, enunciating each word clearly. "That's kind of what I want to talk to you about. I want to make sure that … that you're not going anywhere either." His voice faltered and a sharp tang of fear cut through his calm, reassuring scent.
"What's the deal with the McLeods? I mean, I gather that you really don't like them, but you've never explained why. Do they complain a lot?"
“I …” Dean had never seen Cas look so lost and sad. No more words followed that first one, and the hollowness inside Dean got deeper.
"Look at me."
His eyes flew open. Dean was staring at him, hurt and confusion and something that almost looked like hope warring in those green depths. "I thought," Castiel said cautiously, "that
"And the wedding is in two weeks," Dean finished for him.
"Oh, fuck, that feels amazing. I could feel that inside me. I'm always gonna make you laugh when you're fucking me."
Dean blinked. “What?”
This time the sound was less sleepy and more pleased.
Castiel thought as he kissed Dean again,
Warning: Discussion of homophobia.
"Because he's a dork," Dean said and distracted Cas with a kiss before he could ask for further explanation.
Castiel nodded miserably because it was though still not nearly as bad as the last few days.
"No?" Castiel prompted. "You think you can come on just my cock?"
"What?" Dean said teasingly as he began to walk towards the bedroom, only the bulging of his biceps under his shirt showing that this was in any way challenging.
"You don't have to if you're not comfortable."
Except…
Dean shrugged. "I was afraid I'd look ridiculous and chicken out."
Dean laughed, and even though Cas had his back turned, he could tell by the sound of the laughter that Dean was blushing again. “Yeah. He was the first writer who made me really enjoy reading. When I was a kid I read Batman comics and that was about it. I mean, I had to read other stuff for school, but usually I’d just skim until I picked up enough to fake it. It wasn’t like anyone cared about my grades anyway.” A touch of bitterness crept into his tone, but he shook it off quickly and continued, “But then we came to live with Bobby and Jodi, and their house is
Dean frowned. "Uh, you did? Just a few minutes ago?"
“I’ve been better,” he said, “but honestly, I’ve been worse too. I feel like … not much has actually changed.”
The door which was open.
This time Dean kept silent. He couldn't fail to notice that the woman in the picture could more accurately be described as a girl, not more than seventeen, but he wasn't going to comment on it in front of Claire.
"Go on then," Castiel said, a calculated challenge in his tone. "Give it your best shot."
"Oh, God. I didn't … Not adult in
Dean rolled double sixes, and while he was putting
Castiel laughed and let himself sink back into the lazy stupor that always followed a really satisfying orgasm. "So what surprised you?"
claiming bite… Well, those definitely weren't boner killing thoughts. In fact, his dick was waking up again just when he'd almost convinced it that it wasn't getting any action tonight.
"The song lyrics, yeah. And some of the other stuff." He didn't volunteer any details, and Cas didn't ask, just started working on Dean's belt. Dean was grateful for that. He didn't want to talk about that stuff right now, partly because it was too personal to share with someone he'd just met, and partly because it was kind of depressing and he
"I know," Cas said, rolling his eyes, a little of his usual sassy self peeking through, "but I did make them Jack's legal guardians, idiot that I was, so —"
"Yeah, I"m…" He cleared his throat and blinked back tears of shame and frustration. "I'm here."
"Fuck you," Cas retorted, the most coherent sentence he'd uttered since Dean got the first finger into him.
First Cas picked up each pair and laid them out on the bed like he was handling the crown jewels. He was drawn to a baby pink pair that reminded him of the story of that first time and the lonely, confused young man finally discovering something that made him feel good about himself. But then he saw a deep aquamarine that had a slight golden shimmer as it caught the light. It was just so perfectly Dean, there was really no other choice.
“Willyougooutwithme?”
Dean gasped, embarrassment momentarily vanishing in a wave of arousal that had him fighting not to come. “Funny,” he said when he could string words together again. “Cause I thought the same thing. Made it damn hard to have a professional conversation.”
"Claire also doesn't seem to be making friends. Again, expected and understandable," Ms. Mills hurried on before he could bring up the mute issue. "But plummeting grades, lack of socialization, and now violent outbursts? That's a very worrying combination regardless of if today's incident was unprovoked or not. In fact, if Alex did attack Claire first, that is even more worrying. I'm sure I don't have to tell you what kind of toll bullying takes on a child's emotional health."
Most importantly, Naomi hadn't said anything. It was common knowledge that she disapproved of liaisons among the staff, but she'd never gone so far as to make an official rule against it, probably because she'd have to fire half the waiters. If she decided to make an issue of it in their particular case, Castiel was certain that was a battle he could win, but he'd really rather not fight it at all, especially not when things with Dean were so new and fragile and breathtakingly wonderful.
. To his credit the warning rumble only lasted about two seconds before he got himself under control, and then he looked and smelled more embarrassed than anything else, but it was an unmistakable declaration of
As soon as he felt Dean start to tense up around him, winding tight with his building climax, Castiel stopped and pulled out. Dean gave a frustrated whine, but didn't complain when he realized he wasn't going to get to come yet. "Color?" Castiel asked breathlessly.
Before he could do more than stare at her with his mouth open, she smiled sweetly and said, “Be right back with your pie.”
"Cas. Short for Castiel? Sorry. I'm a compulsive nicknamer. If you don't like it, I —"
"That's not what I was thinking," Missouri said, her dark eyes twinkling at him. "Want to guess again?"
God, he missed New York. Why the fuck had he let the company convince him to move to fucking Texas? And not even one of the bigger cities of Texas. This was truly the ass end of nowhere where even the cell towers were few and far between as evidenced by the stark white on black message on the screen of his smartphone.
"You thought I would be rough," Cas said. Not a question. "Possessive."
"Yes. Hold me up like you just did out there. Show me how strong you are."
Jack nodded enthusiastically. "Uh huh. He smells nice. Kinda like pancakes!"
Dean turned to look at him but didn't say anything. He could tell that Castiel was working up the courage to say something, and he just waited, tracing idle patterns on Castiel's shoulders, grounding him with soft touches as Castiel navigated the dark, twisting labyrinth of his own mind.
But that definitely wouldn't be appropriate behavior for a staff meeting, so Castiel mentally shook his head and did his best to ignore his half-hard dick and pay attention to Naomi who was now going over the business of the day.
"That's great!" Dean grinned, genuinely proud of his little brother using that fancy ass degree to fight for the underdog instead of lining his pockets defending scumbags.
He opened his eyes and looked into Dean’s, and there it was again, that warm, bright something that might,
Dean immediately closed his mouth.
Once they were naked, Dean dropped to his knees and swallowed Castiel down, getting him good and wet. Castiel had to close his eyes lest the sight of those plump, pink lips wrapped around his cock send him over the edge embarrassingly fast. "Jesus Christ, Dean," he moaned, "your fucking mouth."
"Of course not!" Metatron laughed. "That would be terribly anticlimactic. No, there would have to be a real battle royale. Many angels will die. But if you play your part, I promise you will be spared. And just when your army is on the brink of annihilation, I, in my infinite mercy, will give them a choice. Any angel who swears loyalty to me will be allowed to return to Heaven. After all, a God needs minions."
"Oh." Castiel tried not to analyze his intense relief too closely. He wasn't ready to go back into the lamp yet. That was all. He was enjoying the fresh air and the conversation. It had nothing to do with the fact that every time Dean smiled at him Castiel's skin got warm and tingly in a way he hadn't felt in a very long time.
He gathered more of his slick to lube up his cock and finally entered Dean. As sappy as it sounded, even in his head, it really was like coming home. He had been with a few female omegas and one male beta who let him top sometimes, but it had never felt this right, this perfect. Dean was so responsive, so beautifully loud. He rarely used words during sex unless Castiel demanded it, but he keened, and moaned, and gasped with every thrust. His hands twisted relentlessly in the bindings, not trying to escape, just feeling them, reminding himself that they were there.
Cas had no idea what to say to that. He was pretty sure Dean had just admitted to being gay, but not completely sure. Fortunately the coffee maker chose that moment to beep. He moved past Dean to get cups and sugar out of the cabinet. Dean didn't move, and as their arms brushed, skin on bare skin, Cas had an almost overwhelming desire to be wrapped up in the other man's warmth, to feel those strong arms around him, holding him tight and making him feel safe again. He resisted valiantly. Living in a small and not particularly open minded town had taught him to tread carefully, be one hundred percent sure before making any kind of move.
. Dean deflated with a sheepish, "Oh." Castiel added two more subsections —
Finally Cas spoke, his voice flat and toneless. "I'm sorry I woke you."
“I’ve never read it,” Cas admitted.
"You. Dinner."
“You got it.”
Of course the album could tell a darker story if you knew what to look for. Their mother didn't appear in many pictures, and when she did, her smile looked sad and forced. There were occasionally blurry men in the background, but either Babi hadn't taken any pictures of Mama's "friends", or Jimmy hadn't included those pictures in the album. There had been so many of them over the years, Castiel couldn't remember any names.
"Oh, shit," Dean said, his face turning approximately the same shade of red as the silk panties that Cas was now holding up curiously. "Cas, I can explain."
But Dean said without hesitation, "Hell yeah. I thought you'd never ask."
Dean's tongue darted out to lick a flake of pastry from his lower lip, and Castiel was viscerally reminded of the way that tongue had licked up Castiel's come with equal enjoyment earlier that morning. God, what he wouldn't give to be sitting in Dean's lap right now, feeding him pie and kissing him between each bite.
There was another silence while Sam got his thoughts in order, but it wasn't nearly as awkward. Somehow things had shifted. Castiel was no longer sitting in judgment on Sam. They were working together to bridge the gulf between them and make this strange little patchwork family work.
Castiel decided that aftercare was not a good time for a discussion of Dean's sometimes excessive selflessness, so he let it go.
She nodded and said, "Good." Then she looked him straight in the eye. "You treat him right, Cas, and you and me will get along just fine, but —"
“Cas.” A smile tugged at Dean’s mouth as he said it.
Dean blushed and made a noise somewhere between a laugh and a cough. “I, uh … I actually don’t eat here very often, but Pam is an old friend. When I was growing up, she was kind of like a big sister to me.”
“I won’t hurt you, Dean. I promise.” Cas kissed his neck just behind his ear and then continued nipping and sucking the spot while a lubed finger began circling Dean’s entrance, massaging and loosening the muscles before pushing inside.
Charlie sat down beside him and took his hand, giving it a little squeeze. "You don't need to know a lot about sex to do this. Just trust your instincts. This is what they're for. And believe me, Cas, he would rather have you than some super experienced professional companion. He loves you, and you love him. That counts for a lot at a time like this."
They stopped talking after that and focused on feeling. Even after nearly a month, Castiel still couldn't get over how good the sex was. It didn't matter who topped who or if they even bothered with the whole complicated process of penetration at all. Every damn time was mind blowing, spine melting, forget-how-to-say-anything-except-each-other's-names amazing. This time they came at almost the exact same instant, their mouths sealed together, swallowing each other's moans of ecstasy.
, watch him marry some rich knothead who didn't even know how lucky they were, who would make him suppress his true nature and play the good, submissive little omega… that was worse than anything else Dean could imagine. This burned inside him.
He felt Dean lean in, felt the alpha's teeth scrape his neck, and guiltily allowed himself to pretend that all his dreams had somehow come true.
The room had two doors with a small anteroom between them, double scent proofing. The inner door would only open if the outer door was firmly closed and vice versa, and there was an exhaust fan in the ceiling of the anteroom constantly scrubbing the air clean. Nurse Andrews gave Dean an encouraging smile before she closed the outer door between them, leaving Dean alone. He took a deep breath of sterile, scentless air and opened the second door.
Soon, Cas smelled clean and verdant again, like a rain washed forest, but he made no attempt to leave Dean's arms, and Dean definitely wasn't going to tell him to. He secretly liked cuddling even more than sex, and cuddling with Cas was better than sex and pie put togeth-
His brow furrowed when he saw the rope in Castiel's hands.
"Chef? Want a turn?"
And that's how they ended up side by side on Dean's couch watching something called a cartoon which appeared to be a magical painting that could move and talk (although Dean kept insisting it wasn't magic). Castiel was at first confused and mildly offended.
He didn't recognize the song that was playing. It was one of those girly-indie-rock-love-ballads that Sam liked and that Dean would normally insist did not qualify as rock and barely qualified as music, but right now he was kind of into it. The singer had a rough but tuneful baritone that reminded him of Cas's voice, and Dean found himself really listening to the lyrics.
Claire's frown had turned thoughtful rather than confused. She was absorbing his words, turning them over in her head and slowly fitting them into the jigsaw puzzle of her ever evolving worldview. He waited. Finally she stood up, took the message pad off the fridge, and brought it back to the table.
~o0o~
“Fuck. You know what I mean.” Dean couldn’t resist the urge to push down on Cas’s fingers.
credit for. You're good to Claire, so patient and respectful of her feelings. And even though you know I have secrets, you never push. No one's ever been this understanding about Sam before. And you are something else in bed."
Cas looked at the card one more time. A full name and a phone number. That made what he was about to do seem at least a little less crazy. "Dean, are you gay?"
Was he really prepared to let himself fall completely in love with Dean Winchester? Because the more time they spent together, the more inevitable it would become. Could he handle the hurt and disappointment if Dean took one look at the broken, scarred, neurotic mess that was the real Castiel Novak and ran for the hills?
"I do," Castiel said, taking the tiny rosemary bush and burying his nose in it for a moment. "I'll put it in the kitchen window. I can't wait to cook with it. Thank you, Dean."
The toast popped, and Dean went to retrieve it. It was a little burnt around the edges, but she'd always liked it that way. She watched Cas bite into his second slice of perfect toast and remembered how John had always known to burn her toast a little. And her mother would always make sure a couple pieces got charred nearly black because that was how her father liked it. It was one of those couple things. She wondered how long they had been together, but with everyone's mouths full, now didn't seem like a good time to ask.
He could tell by the angle and color of the light filtering through the blinds that it was earlier than he usually liked to wake up, but he certainly wasn't going to complain about what had woken him. Namely, the exquisite wet heat of Dean's mouth wrapped around his cock.
"Yes, please. Although I don't need it as desperately as I usually do. For some reason I woke up feeling incredibly well rested."
“Yeah. Very. We still live together. At least, we do for the next three months.” As always, there was a twinge of loneliness in Dean’s chest when he thought about that, but with the warm, solid weight of Cas in his arms and the smell of their lovemaking still in the air, he barely noticed it. He had stopped worrying about finding a roommate. Living alone wouldn’t be so bad if it meant he could have Cas over whenever he wanted, and they could have loud, shameless sex in any room in the house.
"I already ate dinner."
He didn't go to the bathroom. Instead he headed through the empty kitchen to the big fridge, his sanctuary on busy nights when Naomi was getting on his nerves even more than usual and he needed to clear his head before he bit off someone else's. It felt colder when he wasn't coming from the heat of a kitchen in full dinner rush mode and wasn't wearing his chef's coat. He hugged his arms around himself and took deep breaths, trying to calm down, but the lump in his throat only seemed to get bigger. What was wrong with him today? He'd been doing so well, facing the memories a little bit at a time. Why did this one hurt so much more?
, the juxtaposition of Cas' cock splitting him open and that pretty bow around his own painfully hard dick, his knot beginning to swell just above it, was possibly the single most erotic thing he had ever seen in his life, and shit, he was gonna come.
"No." Castiel took a breath and let it out, letting go of his brusque, bossy work persona and being just Castiel again. "No, I just thought this was a conversation best had in private. We need to decide how we're going to handle this. Working together and being …"
"Yeah. Just a second." Dean pulled over a blanket and wrapped it around their lower bodies. Then he called, "Okay. You can come in." He didn't bother to ask Cas if he was okay with Sam seeing them like this. He had discovered very early on that Cas had no shame. It wasn't exhibitionism exactly. The omega just did not care at all if someone else was in the room. Much to Sam and Kevin's dismay.
Castiel relaxed into his alpha's arms and let thought slip away for a while, surrendering himself to pure feeling. Dean was right. Sex was definitely one of the better aspects of being human.
"Jack, lower your voice," Cas chided. "You'll wake Dean."
"It's hard to explain. I'm not sure I understand it myself. It's just … For some reason seeing Anna with her baby makes me think of Jimmy, of how much he loved Claire, and of all the things he won't get to see. Her first crush, her first first date, her graduation, her wedding. It's … It's so unfair." His voice broke on the last word, and a few more tears leaked out, but he was still mostly dried up.
“Really?” Sam said speculatively. “Think there might be another wedding in the future?”
When they arrived at Sam's office, a petite and pretty brunette omega woman was there with Sam. She gave off the refreshing scents of grass and wildflowers, but there was something steely in both her gaze and in the way she carried herself. This was not someone to underestimate. Dean liked her immediately, of course. She reminded him of Cas.
"Your brother is a smart man despite his protests to the contrary."
"I had my son Jack when I was nineteen. I had no interest in mating the alpha who impregnated me, nor did I want an abortion. I had every intention of raising Jack on my own, and I tried. I… I really tried." His throat tightened and he had to pause as the old familiar guilt rose up to pull him under. Maybe he hadn't tried hard enough. Maybe he shouldn't have been so quick to accept Michael's offer.
"And I love you," Cas murmured back, tipping his head back to invite a kiss.
Dean shrugged, his ears tinting red. "Yeah. Call me old-fashioned." His tone was casual enough, but Castiel knew him too well to be fooled. This was something Dean had been dreaming about for a long time.
"And the wedding is still —"
"Castiel?" Charlie's eyes widened. "As in the trench coat wearing angel who rescued you from Hell and then rebelled against Heaven to help you stop the apocalypse? That Castiel?"
Claire giggled and rolled the dice.
Dean rolled his eyes and muttered, "Nerd," affectionately.
Benny answered after the second ring. "Hey, cher. What's up? You and Cas want a third for some Christmas Eve fun?"
She nodded.
Castiel was happy to oblige. "You look pretty edible yourself." He didn't even have to try to make his voice low and seductive. Just looking at Dean in that shirt made it drop half an octave.
"I don't understand," Cas said, his brow wrinkling in his trademark puzzled frown. "He is well aware that we are lovers. We often kiss and "get handsy" in his presence." God, those air quotes. They would probably start to annoy Dean again at some point, but right now he was hard pressed to find anything Cas did less than completely adorable. "Why should this bother him more than that?"
"Seriously? That's not kinky enough for you?" Dean said incredulously.
for this chapter. Please note I've added the tag "John Winchester's A+ Parenting". That applies mostly to this chapter, but also a few things in later chapters. There is also an explicit reference to Castiel's pregnancy and the judgment he faced for being an unmated pregnant teenager. This is not meant to imply any judgment of teen pregnancy or single parents on my part. I believe that everyone should have the right to make their own decisions in that situation, free of moral judgment.
Dean lifted his head to look at Castiel. "You're sure?"
“You’re gonna remember to pick me up at the airport, right? Cause getting a cab all the way back to Sioux Falls is gonna cost a fortune.”
Dean was silent for a moment, and then he said Castiel's second favorite three word sentence. "I'm coming over."
Dean was happy to oblige, and for a few hours nothing existed but the two of them in their little oasis of candlelight, making their kind of love.
Dean laughed again and reeled him in for a deep, hungry kiss.
“I’m sorry,” Dean said, addressing Cas this time as he slipped his phone back into his pocket. “I forgot that I promised to pick my brother up from the airport. I’m not making this up to ditch you, I swear.”
Castiel smirked. "No. Nor is it surprising given how much you like it when I take charge. Now are you going to continue distracting me, or are you going to let me finish this so we can, as you put it, 'talk about shit'?"
Castiel's brain came back online enough to prompt him to close the door, but when he glanced over and saw the things laid out on the bed, his cognitive abilities stuttered to a halt once more.
Castiel stroked his bare back and murmured soothing words into his hair. "Shhh. It's okay. We're okay. I'm not upset with you. You didn't do anything wrong. Hopefully the weather will have cleared up tomorrow morning, and we can go home where we can put these beautiful ropes to good use." Remembering the surprise hidden in his dresser at home, he added mischievously, "They'll match the new panties I bought for you perfectly."
liked it. I practically didn't need a fantasy to keep it up that time. It was the best sex I'd ever had until my first time with a guy."
. I don't want it. I don't want it, Dean."
Even though Castiel had been ninety-nine percent sure that would be Dean's answer, he still felt a surge of relief and gratitude as he was reminded yet again of why he loved this man so much.
"Well, here I am." Dean spread his arms helplessly. "What … What do I do?"
“How do you know we haven’t?”
He carefully avoided looking at Dean as he said with forced calm, "I apologize for shouting, but you really don't want me anywhere near the customers tonight. Especially not the McLeods." He had a hard time being civil to them even when he wasn't a raw bundle of nerves.
"My brother," Dean said shortly.
He caught the reassuring scent of coffee and woodsmoke a moment before Dean crouched down beside him, laying a warm hand on his back. It was a neutral, friendly touch, not overly intimate. They had agreed to keep their relationship discrete while they were posing as FBI agents, a decision that Castiel was now deeply regretting. His inner omega wanted to cuddle into Dean, surround himself with his alpha's strong arms and the comfort of their mingled scents. He could almost believe that that would be enough to keep him safe from the monster that was stalking this town.
Dean's back stiffened, and his scent turned sharp and acrid with possessive alpha rage, but he didn't move, didn't even say anything for almost two whole minutes. Sam breathed through his mouth so Dean's aggressive scent wouldn't get his own inner alpha riled up, and he waited patiently while his brother wrestled his instincts under control so they could have a civilized human conversation. Finally Dean said simply, "I know."
"You live in town? I could give you a ride home."
lenient. "Say it. Tell me with words or I'll untie you right now and you can take care of that hard on without my help." It wasn't an empty threat, and Dean knew it. Castiel had followed through on it before, much to Dean's chagrin, and Castiel would only wait so long for Dean to work up the courage to speak.
wanted a small wedding. We
The pillow ended up on the floor as did their clothes, and soon Castiel was on all fours in the middle of the bed, rocking back onto his alpha's cock. This wasn't usually his preferred position. He liked to be able to see Dean's face, but when an alpha was in rut his knot could last up to an hour. This position would allow them to wait it out in comfort and even fall asleep while still tied together. It was fortunate that the cast had come off Castiel's wrist last week or this would have been much more complicated.
"This is my niece Claire," Castiel said, answering Anna but addressing everyone. "She's going to be hanging out here tonight." He wondered if he should mention the mute thing, then decided that they would either figure it out or assume she was just shy.
God didn't need to eat.
Kudos and comments are love. Just sayin'. =)
"Castiel, would you mind helping Hannah with the dishes?" Michael said, pushing back his chair.
Cas pulled up a chair next to him though he still kept a cautious buffer space between them. "Your body has been under a terrible strain for months. Ever since the first Trial. It will take time for all the damage to heal, and pushing yourself too hard will only hinder the process."
"Course I did," Dean said, perching himself awkwardly on the edge of the bed. Despite his best efforts, his eyes were drawn to Cas's lap.
"Good?" Dean asked.
would put him on the defensive.
“Shit, Cas. You’re making me blush.”
"Looks like Cas already took care of that."
"There's no such thing as moving too fast if we're on the same page," Castiel said, amazed that he could keep his voice so steady while his heart was trying to jump out of his chest at the confirmation that Dean also wanted this to last forever, wanted them to be a family. "You're right that I'm not ready to get married yet, but I have no problem with you getting attached to Claire in the meantime. Whether you realize it or not, Dean, you've been a father to her for months now, and you've been a good one. Even if we broke up, I wouldn't cut you off from her. We made a deal, remember? Whatever happens between us, we don't let it hurt Claire, and at this point, you disappearing from her life would hurt her. She's already lost one father. I wouldn't take another one away from her just to spite you."
The next time he poked his head into the living room, Claire was showing Dean her brand new play kitchen, complete with pots and pans and plastic food. Dean had been right. It was the perfect gift. She had been cooking an imaginary feast since the ungodly hour of seven a.m. which had given Castiel plenty of time to prepare their actual dinner. She was now demonstrating how the burners lit up when you turned the knob and the dishwasher made noises like it was actually working when you pressed the button. Dean looked suitably impressed.
Dean's hand clamped down on Castiel's knee. "Don't you dare."
Cas lifted his head and propped his chin on Dean's shoulder. There was bemusement and shy hopefulness in his scent. "Isn't the alpha traditionally the dominant one in the relationship?" he asked.
"… so this week the lemon sole will be offered with a side of steamed potatoes instead. The McLeods have reserved the private dining room for their twentieth wedding anniversary. They'll be hosting a party of twenty people, themselves included, and they would like to arrange a time to go over the menu with you, Castiel. When would be convenient?"
. The transition was remarkably smooth, and much as he hated to give Naomi credit, Castiel had to admit that having Dean and Anna overlap for a few weeks had been a good idea. Now Dean knew the menu back to front and was comfortable enough with the kitchen and the staff to wear his new authority with confidence. The only remaining problem was Castiel's unabating attraction to his handsome new assistant.
Dean smiled gratefully. "Okay, fine. What should I make?"
For the first time Castiel noticed the simmering anger beneath Dean's seemingly apathetic silence, the same anger he had seen when Dean said,
It was just Castiel today. Dr. Bradbury had wanted to meet with him privately to get some context for Claire's situation before they officially started treatment.
Dean chuckled. "Okay. Point taken. I'll butt out."
. Dear God, if it was that deep when he was just talking, what did it sound like when he was turned on? Dean desperately wanted to find out.
Castiel's heart sank. "Of course, if you don't want to, that's —" He didn't get any farther because his mouth was suddenly occupied with other activities.
"This is my colleague, Eileen Leahy," Sam introduced her. "She also specializes in family law, and I think her input on your case would be helpful, if that's alright with you. Eileen is deaf, but she can lipread, and I can sign for you if necessary."
“Come on, Mike,” Gabriel began placatingly.
Castiel buried his face in Dean's shoulder, burrowed into the warmth of him, and sobbed. Dean still didn't say anything, didn't ask questions or offer meaningless words of comfort. He just held Castiel as tightly as he could without hurting him, and somewhere in the maelstrom of grief and pain and confusion, part of Castiel wistfully wondered if this was what it felt like to be loved.
…" Dean hiccupped and continued in a whisper, "the kind of alpha you need."
Dean finally lifted his head and looked Castiel in the eyes. "Cas, I feel like … like I've been looking for someone just like you for a long time, and I know it's only been a couple weeks, and I don't want to sound clingy, but now that I found you … I don't know if I can ever give you up."
“Dude, she won’t friggin leave. She’s eating us out of house and home.” Dean couldn’t quite manage to sound genuinely annoyed. It had actually been his idea for Sam to spend the weekend with his fiancee who was finishing her last semester of med school at Stanford, but even though he knew how much Sam needed this, he’d been dreading three days of an empty house. He didn’t handle alone time well. He either slipped into a funk or did something incredibly stupid and impulsive to break up the monotony. Fortunately Charlie Bradbury had taken it upon herself to be his babysitter and asked nothing in return but the chance to beat the high score on every video game he owned. (Most of those scores were hers to begin with.)
Castiel stared at Dean in mute shock, unable to think of a single thing to say.
He half expected to be thrown up against the wall as soon as he entered the room, was kind of hoping for it actually, but the sight that greeted him was a hundred … no, make that a million times better. Cas had scrounged up some candles, probably from one of the bunker's many store rooms full of random crap, and in addition to the warm golden light they gave off, there was an herby scent in the air that reminded Dean vaguely of Bobby's house, the only home he really remembered before this place. And in the middle of the bed, completely naked and haloed in candlelight, was his omega.
She licked his hair.
“No. We came here when I was fourteen. Before that we moved around a lot.” A shadow passed over Dean’s face, and he abruptly said, “What about you? You from around here?”
"If I let Dr. Sexy patch me up, will he tell me the story behind his secret pantie collection?"
"Hey, hey, hey. It's okay, baby," Sam said, stroking her hair. "We're not pushing it off. We're getting married on the Fourth of July come hell or high water. I promise." He looked to Dean. "Is it okay if we stay here for a few more weeks? After the wedding there'll be more time to go look at apartments and stuff. Right now there's just too much else to do."
care for your children?"
Dean groaned in desperation and frustration. His own willpower was the only thing actually keeping that door closed, and it was weakening quickly the longer Cas stood there smelling so enticing and being so endearingly/infuriatingly unreasonable. "What about Meg, huh?" he demanded. "What about the pizza man?"
Dean laughed. "I was gonna ask how you could tell which was which, but yeah, I've totally seen you make that face."
"I do."
Castiel felt himself blushing at the praise. "I don't know about that," he said. "I feel like I'm failing eighty percent of the time."
"Shit. Hannah?"
Cas removed Dean's glasses and placed them on the nightstand. Then he threaded his fingers through Dean's hair and guided the alpha's head down. Dean let his jaw go slack and relaxed his throat as best he could. The moment Cas' cock slipped past his lips, Dean forgot all discomfort. He forgot the meaning of the word 'discomfort'. His mouth flooded with the salty, musky, sour taste of Cas. His nose filled with the scent of thunderstorms as Cas pushed him almost all the way down to the root, pubic hair tickling his face. Dean closed his eyes and surrendered control to his Dom, floating contentedly in his own personal Heaven. Nothing existed but Cas. The only sounds Dean was aware of were Cas' ragged breaths, the occasional gravelly command to swallow which he obeyed readily, and an almost unbroken stream of praise and endearments. "Just like that. So good for me, my Alpha. My perfect Alpha. Oh god, I love you."
"I'm gonna be in first grade next year!"
He could hear Dean's confused frown when the man said, "So why—"
. I need you to make me forget all about him. Give me something good to remember about tonight. Please, Dean." He knew he was begging and he didn't care. He wanted this so badly, not just the sex but the human presence.
He felt a warm hand squeeze his arm, but Dean didn't say anything, and Castiel liked the man a little more for knowing when words were inadequate and a human presence was enough.
There are several sensitive subjects discussed in this chapter, so I have
Grace leaned companionably against his leg, and he scratched behind her ears while he searched for an interesting book to pass the time until Dean returned.
"Would you have listened?"
Cas conceded the point, took a bite, and sighed with relief as he realized how hungry he actually was. Dean resolved to keep a close eye on him for the next few weeks. After Benny died, he had walked around in a fog for the better part of a month. Bobby, Jodi, Sam, and Charlie had ganged up to force him to eat, sleep, shower, and change his clothes because left to himself he would hide under the hood of the Impala twenty four hours a day, staring at the familiar interlocking pattern of engine parts until it seemed to contain the answer to all life’s mysteries.
"No, it isn't," Cas said firmly.
"I'd be honored to cook with the great Castiel Novak," — there was no hint of sarcasm or irony in the words — "but I do have other options, and I'd rather go somewhere I'll be welcome."
"He would sleep in my room," Castiel clarified. "You don't have to give up your bed."
She nodded and practically fled back to her car.
"Okay?" Dean echoed. "Like, okay, you'd like me to take you home now?"
you to tell me if there's something you need me to say out loud. I'm not great with words, but for you I'll try."
He definitely hadn’t been in love with his drunken one night stand. He didn’t even know the guy’s name. Aaron had been a rebound after Benny. And Benny … He had loved Benny, and Benny had loved him, but it wasn’t the kind of love you could build a future on, and he was just starting to figure that out when Benny died.
Dr. Bradbury chuckled sympathetically. "I'm sure Claire won't enjoy it any more than you will, but better to make sure she has the right information rather than letting her piece it together from TV and the internet and how other kids think it works. Ignorance about sex doesn't stop kids from trying it. On another subject, how often do you discuss Claire's father with her?"
know. "Jerk off."
He imagined Dean reaching out to pull him closer, warm hands gliding over Castiel's bare skin. Or he might push Castiel away, order him back into the lamp and drop it into the deepest ocean. In his heart Castiel knew that Dean would never do that, but even so …
Dean's stomach squirmed with guilt as he said, "Yeah. I mean, there comes a time when you gotta move on and stop waiting around for something that's never gonna happen, right?"
"Sorry," Jess said, releasing Cas. She didn't actually sound sorry any more than Dean actually sounded jealous. "He's just too gorgeous to resist."
The warmth from the vents did help, and as the tension left him, Cas began to feel powerfully drowsy. He rested his head against the car door and gave in to the urge to close his eyes. Seconds later he fell asleep, lulled by the purr of the engine and Dean humming softly. It sounded like "Hey Jude", but he wasn't sure.
"It's okay." They were stopped at a light, so Dean turned to look at Castiel and took his hand. "I'll tell you the whole story, Cas. I will. Just … not today. Okay?"
~o0o~
Warnings: Explicit sex, discussion of bullying, and oblique references to self harm
The words played on a loop in his head. Only when he heard a low chuckle from Cas did he realize he was saying them out loud.
Apparently Claire was no exception. She gobbled up four sandwiches. Castiel tried halfheartedly to resent Dean just a little for succeeding so quickly where he himself had failed repeatedly, but he wasn't selfish enough to be unhappy about anything that made Claire happy.
Warnings: Discussion of murder, suicide, and addiction. If you need specifics before you feel comfortable reading, go down to the end notes.
"That was good," Cas murmured.
"Dean," Castiel said as they stood up. "It's possible that we don't have to kill him. We could explain to him that pain is a natural part of life, that most humans want to live even when it seems like they don't. Maybe if we could make him understand, he would stop."
A week later — the most exhausting week of his life — Castiel arrived back in New York with a sad and silent nine year old in tow. The doctor had assured him that there was nothing physically wrong with Claire.
Sam looked over at Eileen and both of them smiled. "We've won much tougher cases than this," Eileen said.
"You can't sleep either, huh?" he guessed.
Aaron's smile was shy, half hidden by a thick beard. He was clearly the more introverted half of the couple, balancing out Max's vibrant energy.
), the two started chattering to each other in what Dean could only assume was computer-geek-ese because it certainly wasn't English.
without Anna. She'd been with them since the beginning, and even though she could have had her own kitchen a dozen times over by now, she'd always insisted that she would rather be sous chef, that the stress of command would detract from her enjoyment of the cooking. But someone must have finally made her an offer she couldn't refuse. "You found another job," he said, trying not to sound too unhappy. She was talented, and she deserved a chance to spread her wings. He'd been lucky to keep her this long. Eight years was an eternity in the restaurant business.
," Dean insisted doggedly. "You're my beautiful angel. You're so beautiful, my Omega."
"… And Naomi says she's willing to hire Dean permanently if you agree to it. Oh, speak of the devil."
a little jealous of that steak," Cas joked.
Dean laughed and climbed back onto the bed, prowling toward Castiel on all fours until he was caging the omega in with his body. "Glad you think so." Green eyes darted down to where Castiel's hard cock curved up against his stomach, and then back to Castiel's face. "Speaking of my ass, when you said you wanted to fuck, did you mean…"
"Yes! Don't you see?" Dean dragged Cas' hands away from his face and squeezed them. "We pretend to be a couple just long enough to convince your brother that you're settling down."
Since that first dinner, he hadn't had much more success at getting her to eat his cooking. He'd started resorting to peanut butter sandwiches which were at least marginally healthier than pizza, but he couldn't shake the guilty feeling that he was turning into his mother.
Cas lifted his head and looked at Dean. He seemed shocked. “You would do that?”
the other day?"
Cas nodded as though this should be the most obvious thing in the world instead of something Dean had given up on ever having. "I mean, not this year, considering how much we have on our plate, but… when the time feels right to both of us, I would love to have a baby with you."
have deliberately led you to certain assumptions to… well, to literally throw you off the scent."
"Oh. Ha." Dean blushed but answered readily. "Okay, so the thing with Jo was … I was fourteen at the time. And she was more than just a pretty face. She was smart and funny and tough and did not take shit from anyone. I liked her in every possible way. Except one."
He turned the page. "And that's our mother. Your grandmother."
When he came back to himself, Dean was gazing hazily up at him, clearly high on endorphins. With trembling fingers Castiel unbound Dean's hands. He also removed Dean's glasses and laid them carefully on the nightstand, before laying down and gathering the alpha into his arms to cuddle and scent and lick him while they came out of the scene. He made no attempt to clean them up. Being covered in each other's come, the most primal form of scent marking, would help keep them from dropping.
"Yeah. Charlie, meet Castiel. Cas, Charlie Bradbury."
Dean whined and shifted his hips impatiently, trying to get Castiel's fingers where he wanted them. "Come on, Cas. I'm not a virgin. I've done this like a thousand times. You're not gonna break me."
So yeah, he was aware that it was one of his flaws, and no one gave him more shit about it than he did himself, but this once he felt he could be forgiven because the man in front of him was very, very distracting.
Cas rubbed soothing circles on Dean's chest. "I promise your answer won't change mine, Dean. I'm coming with you regardless. I simply want to know what to expect. Will anyone there be even slightly uncomfortable with the nature of our relationship?"
"Are you kidding?! No! Cas, this is perfect!"
Castiel blinked. "That was very brave." He began to get an inkling of why Dean had stood by his brother so loyally even after what most people would consider an unforgivable act. "My brother —" He bit his tongue, but then decided to let the traitorous words out. They had been eating at him for weeks, and if anyone would listen without judging, it was Dean. "Jimmy wasn't supportive. He wasn't mean about it. He just made it clear that my love life was my own business and he didn't want to hear about it or meet any of my boyfriends, no matter how serious it was. He'd probably be furious with me for letting you into Claire's life, kissing you right in front of her and teaching her that it's not wrong."
At first Claire was understandably wary of this enormous stranger, and prison obviously hadn't afforded Sam many opportunities to learn how to talk to kids, but he gave it a try. "Dean says you like cooking, Claire."
. Wealth, power, a harem of beautiful women."
“She had a miscarriage. Her twenty first child. The baby died almost immediately. Mother went into a coma and died a week later. Of course, I only found out the details many years later. At the time all anyone would tell me was that she had “gone to be with God”. I don’t think I realized she was dead until the funeral. It was open casket, and when I saw her lying there …” He shivered. “I ran away and hid in the church kitchen until it was over. I had nightmares about it for months.” He felt Dean’s arms tighten around him, anchoring him to the present, surrounding him with warmth and safety.
"And Dean too. Sleep now, love. You know Santa won't come unless you're asleep."
Cas finally smiled, and his scent sweetened again. He took Dean's hand and kissed the palm before pressing it to his cheek. "I'm sorry, alpha. I didn't truly doubt your fidelity for a moment. I don't know why I responded to her the way I did. I just … When you hugged her, I could both see and smell how much you care for her, and —"
Dean hugged him back, and whether he held on so tightly for Castiel's comfort or his own was anyone's guess. "Did she threaten to fire you?" he asked.
“No, but that’s what’s kind of freaking me out. I … I trust him, Sam. I don’t know if I love him, but I definitely trust him.”
"Yep. It was already half yours, so I just transferred my half into Jess's name. Now you don't have to worry about paying rent, and when the other place is fixed up, you can sell it or rent it out, put some money away for diapers and college funds and whatever."
“Apart from you two, does anyone in this family actually like each other?” Dean asked wryly.
"Thanks." Dean leaned into him, their heads coming to rest against each other. "God, I hate public speaking."
"Are not, jerk," came a tinny retort in the background. Dean ignored it, all his attention focused on Castiel.
actually have romantic feelings for Cas is entirely irrelevant. Cas is twice as touchy feely as Dean is.)
"Castiel. Poor, dear, hopeless Castiel," she crooned, and it would have seemed almost kind if she hadn't been caressing his face with the tip of a blade. His own blade if he wasn't mistaken. "For all your talk about the importance of free will," she went on in a conversational tone, "you never seem to make the
She hugged him again, then followed Castiel out the door, still smiling.
"But if you hadn't been there —" He mentally shied away from any contemplation of just how much worse this night could have been.
"How've you been?" Sam asked as they let go of each other.
"You don't have to apologize," Cas said, stroking Dean's sweaty hair. "I understand why you were scared."
The fear faded from Sam's eyes, and Dean hoped he would be comforted enough to let the rest of it go. Like Grace, he hoped in vain. "Okay," Sam said as he flipped the bacon. "So what's the problem?"
As he started to move away, Claire grabbed his sleeve and looked up at him imploringly. He was getting pretty good at interpreting her silent communications, but this one took him a moment to decipher. When he realized what was worrying her, his heart broke a little bit more.
He opened his mouth.
At that moment a wave of fatigue washed over Sam, so strong that he had to sink into the nearest chair lest he collapse where he stood. They were getting fewer and farther between, but he still needed a nap most days, and going out on hunts was out of the question if just walking around the bunker was this exhausting.
It was a good thing Castiel had already confirmed that he found Dean attractive because he was still too much in shock to kiss back. "Um, no, probably not," he agreed when Dean pulled away after a few seconds. "So you … I … we …" He gave up on forming a coherent sentence, put his cup down on the coffee table, took Dean's cup out of his hands and put it safely out of the way as well, then finally climbed into the other man's lap and kissed him like it was going out of style.
I don’t want to go to your brother’s wedding.”
"Yes," Castiel agreed. His brain wasn't as overloaded with information as he'd expected from learning a new language, and the movements had started to feel more natural towards the end. "What did you think, Claire? Do you like this way of talking?"
Cas took his mouth off Dean with an obscene little pop and licked pre-come from his reddened lips. “Mmm. Much as I would love to make you come in my mouth,” he said, his voice deeper than Dean had ever heard it before, “tonight I have other plans for you.” He crawled up the bed, eyes never leaving Dean’s face. “Top or bottom?”
"I was kind of hoping you'd pick those," Dean said as Cas held them out to him. "They're my favorite." He started to undo his belt, then hesitated. "Cas, could you … could you close your eyes? Just this once. I know you've seen me naked plenty of times, but this is different."
"No. Think I got my second wind. So where do you want to start?"
Dean flinched at the sound of his own voice, sharp and angry.
didn't look at all disapproving. "Really? You two are …"
They laid back down and looked up at the sky. It was a gorgeous shade of purple with streaks of green that foreshadowed a thunderstorm later. Dean reached out and took Cas’s hand, weaving their fingers together. After a moment, he wriggled a little closer to Cas and rolled his head until it was almost but not quite touching Cas’s shoulder.
"Well, maybe a bit bigger than that," Dean conceded, "but you're much bigger now."
"You cold?" Dean asked, already reaching out to turn on the heater.
As they tromped inside, they noticed that it had started snowing again, slowly obscuring the footprints they had left all over the yard.
"No argument here," Sam chuckled. "Now go find your boyfriend and make sure he knows he's got nothing to worry about."
"Yeah." Dean told him what Nurse Andrews had said.
that the new boyfriend was Cas. I wouldn't have judged you. I told you I've known for years that you were in love with him."
"That was going to be over way too fast for my liking," Castiel explained.
That was the real reason he’d spent two years sleeping alone. It wasn’t, as Sam and everyone else had thought, that he felt like moving on would be an insult to Benny’s memory. It was just too damn confusing, grieving for his best friend who was also his lover but only sometimes. He couldn’t navigate that and dating at the same time, and one experiment conclusively proved that the whole casual sex thing was not for him. Which was fine. He had plenty of other things that made him happy — his job, his family, fixing up the house, working on his car.
. That’s why I named my dog Grace.” Said dog looked up at the sound of her name, and Cas patted her head to let her know nothing was required of her at the moment.
think
Dean's eyes darkened at that. He crawled over Castiel, caging him in, then sank down so that their foreheads were touching. They both kept their eyes open, enjoying each other's pleasure as much as their own while they slowly joined their bodies together. When Dean finally bottomed out, he held still for a few moments to let Castiel adjust.
They went to a small, reasonably priced bistro called
"Okay, cher," Benny said easily. "You know you can always call me if you need to talk."
Cas abruptly pulled away from Dean, balling himself up again, his expression closed off. "That's not what I'm afraid of."
. "I don't need time," Cas said breathlessly. "I need
"How old were you?" Dean asked curiously.
"Mmm, yes. Just like that," Castiel purred and kissed the word from Dean's mouth.
The man waiting for them on the steps of the church was definitely a Novak. Dean could see the resemblance right away, but all the best parts of Cas were missing. The dark hair was slicked down with gel and severely styled, and the eyes were more gray than blue, lacking the depths of humor, curiosity, and kindness that made Cas’s gaze so piercing. Everything about this man was cold, hard, and polished like a marble statue.
"How much longer do you think that'll take?" Dean asked as he bent to take the steaks out of the oven.
"Okay. I'll, um… I'll try to be gentle."
Dean frowned in confusion. "Naomi? What does she have to do with it?" And then Castiel could almost hear it click into place. "Oh. Did she … Cas, did she tell you to break up with me?"
Dean blushed. Castiel was finding that he quite enjoyed the sight and tried to think of ways to make him do it again. "Believe me, I'm nothing special," Dean said. "And I do want things. Just not things you can give me." He looked sad again. Castiel did
"I'm starting to get on Sam's nerves anyway cause I'm better at video games than him."
Dean was skating on the edge of orgasm now, and he thought he should hurry this along before he had a coronary, but when he tried to take Cas's rock hard cock in hand, Cas grabbed his wrist gently but firmly and said, "No." Dean made an undignified whining noise but obediently twisted his fingers in the sheets and let Cas have his way in every sense of the phrase.
Dean sighed into Cas's mouth, kissing back greedily, devouring the unconditional love and acceptance he had lived without for so long, and giving just as good as he got. They only parted when they ran out of breath, and Dean was flushed for a different reason now.
"Good. Call me back at this number and I'll get you in. Hurry, please," she added which made Dean's stomach clench and the distress in his scent spike sharply again.
"Oh. Dude, it's not a big deal."
Dean's cock throbbed as it tried to get even harder, a physical impossibility at this point. He quickly shucked his boxers and covered his fingers in a generous amount of lube. Cas obligingly spread his legs wide, and Dean knew that he would never need to watch porn again. He could just close his eyes and picture
Sam rolled his eyes. "That wasn't my fault. The stove was electric and it shorted."
“So what’s his name?”
Dean perked up, his scent changing from worried to hopeful. In terms of the case this was a good thing. Figuring out what they were up against and how to kill it was the most time consuming part of a hunt, and the sooner they could do that, the fewer people would die. So Castiel couldn't really blame Dean for sounding a little excited when he said, "Okay. What?"
"Bedside table drawer."
"Eileen's been teaching me," Sam said, and his poker face was impressive. He only blushed a little around the ears.
gentle. It has to leave a mark."
because Dean, Sam, and Charlie were unanimously appalled that Cas had never seen it. It was quite good if shamelessly campy. Dean and Cas both ogled the very young, very fit Val Kilmer who played the hero. Dean and Charlie quoted their favorite lines until Sam and Cas threw popcorn at them and told them to shut up. All four of them laughed at the terrible special effects.
"Mmm. I think I'll take you up on that, but help me up outta this bed anyway. I need to use the restroom."
That did it. Dean came hard with an almost surprised gasp of "Cas!"
Castiel smiled into Dean's shirt. His dick might be incredibly frustrated right now, but his heart had never been more content.
“Sounds good to me.” Dean had always preferred informal dates. Getting dressed up and going somewhere expensive might be romantic, but it didn’t really encourage people to be themselves which kind of defeated the whole purpose of a date.
Cas. Cas was alive.
Dean needed no more encouragement. He reached across the table, took Cas' hand, and raised it to his lips. Cas' breath caught as Dean's mouth grazed over his knuckles, breath warm on his skin. Even after all these years, Dean could still turn him on with a single touch, and sometimes without touching him at all. Green eyes locked with blue, and Dean started batting his eyelashes. Cas had to bite his tongue to keep from bursting out laughing and giving away the game.
🎉 Happy New Year! 🎉 I hope 2021 is treating all of you well so far.
Sensing his spiraling mood, Grace jumped up on the couch with him and nuzzled his cheek with her wet nose.
Cas's cock gave a hard twitch at the thought too. He spun Dean around, pinned him against the mirror, and kissed him, messy and desperate and possessive. Face to face was even better, the thick, rigid line of Dean's cock rutting with his own and the soft silk in between growing damp with the pre-come leaking into it from both sides. They moaned into each other's mouths and moved with redoubled purpose.
"Pretty much. Cas… I don't think he has any plans to give you custody of Jack whether you're mated or not. He's just stalling."
Dean spent a few minutes tapping at his phone screen while Castiel wiped his eyes, blew his nose, and generally tried to feel more like a human being and less like a walking blob of tears and snot.
Cas wasted no time crawling in beside Dean. His feet were icy cold, but Dean rubbed them with his own until they warmed up. "I had trouble sleeping before too," Cas said into the darkness. "Before the clinic. A man told me to try counting sheep, but there were no sheep."
of hurting his omega and rip their throats out, make
The man's grin widened. "Yep. Best year for the Impala. They never improved on it. You know classic cars?"
"Well, I have an assistant. And I don't usually have to deal with them until after I've had plenty of coffee."
"Because of
Dean nodded and kissed him. This time there was no desperation in it. It was soft and warm as a sigh of relief. They were interrupted by the oven timer, but it wouldn’t have led to anything anyway. They were both well and truly fucked out.
After they got the tree set up in the living room and liberally if somewhat haphazardly adorned it with lights, baubles, and plastic reindeer with glowing red noses, Castiel brought out the box he had found in Jimmy's closet when he was cleaning out the house. Claire recognized it immediately, and for a moment her face went completely blank.
Dean's eyes tracked his every move, pupils already dilated. They came to rest on Castiel's face as Castiel knelt between Dean's knees and ran his hands reverently up those long, strong legs. When he reached Dean's hips, he let his fingers dip tentatively under the hem of his shirt, watching Dean's face for any sign of nervousness or hesitation. For some people being naked was no big deal, and for others it was the biggest hurdle in a new relationship. Dean gave a slight nod and lifted his arms to let Castiel pull the shirt up and off.
Their faces were about an inch apart, and they both had their eyes open, and Dean thought vaguely that this was way more intimate than an adrenaline fueled one night stand had any right to be, but he didn't care. The lost, blissful, utterly trusting look Cas was giving him was possibly the single sexiest thing he had ever seen.
They all tensed up when another woman approached their table, this one with a little boy in tow, but then the boy stepped forward and offered Claire a sticker with a dinosaur on it. "I gots two stickers cause I didn't bite the dentist," he said gravely. "I gots a triceratops and a T-Rex. I think you should have the T-Rex so if the mean lady comes back, it can bite her. The triceratops wouldn't bite her cause they're plant eaters."
He slowly became aware that Dean's shirt was damp under his cheek. He'd been crying without realizing it. "Sorry," he said, lifting his head. "I got you all wet."
"This is my fault." It was barely more than a whisper, but the words felt like ground glass in his throat, like he had been screaming them for hours or days. While he was safe and warm in Dean's arms every night, his brothers and sisters were wandering the world, lost and hurt and angry, a danger to themselves and every human who crossed their path. What right did he have to be happy while others suffered for his mistakes?
"I love you too," Cas whispered, his body starting to move against Dean's in a way that indicated he was hoping for another round.
She nodded.
He had hoped that prolonged exposure to Dean would cure him of that, but it seemed to be having the opposite effect. The more time he spent with the man, the more he wanted him, and his fantasies were no longer purely sexual either. He caught himself imagining lazy Saturday mornings, cooking breakfast together, Dean barefoot and possibly wearing one of Castiel's shirts, sunlight slanting through the kitchen window and highlighting the golden scruff on his strong jaw, the cute dusting of freckles on his nose. Castiel knew that those kinds of thoughts were far more dangerous than just wanting to bed Dean, but he couldn't seem to convince his subconscious of that.
"Castiel, let me handle this," Naomi said warningly, but it was too late.
Cas said very softly, “No. Please stay.”
"I'm okay with it most of the time, but we should probably keep it to a minimum in the kitchen if only so we don't get distracted and start a fire."
Dean hurried to get the cookies out of the oven before they really did burn and tried to ignore his inner alpha howling at him to go comfort his omega.
They let conversation lapse for a while except for Castiel giving directions, but there was nothing uncomfortable about the silence. It occurred to Castiel that he'd never had a relationship quite like this. There was no dancing around each other, no question of if or even when. They
“What’s bothering you, Dean?” Cas prodded gently. “Talk to me.”
Finally Anna returned and, with an apologetic smile, took over the quail while he hurried (but not too much) to catch the McLeods before they left. They might be Naomi's best customers, but they were Castiel's least favorite. Fergus McLeod owned a very exclusive investment firm, and his wife Rowena was a retired prima ballerina who gave dance lessons to the rich and famous. They came to
Sam took a moment to collect himself again and continued. "It started with alcohol, but it didn't take me long to graduate to other things. I lost my law school scholarship, had to drop out. That probably should have been my wake up call, but I kept going. No school just meant more time to get high. And I know what you're thinking. Where was Dean in all this? Right?"
As soon as the words were out of his mouth, Castiel wanted to take them back. He wasn't sure who was more horrified — him or Dean.
So you’re a regular here,” Dean said when Pam left them alone again.
Put like that, he really couldn't argue.
Castiel laughed and held him close, heedless of the sticky mess sandwiched between them. "Happy Valentine's Day." The lingering post-orgasm high gave him the courage to add, "Hopefully, the first of many we'll celebrate together."
Dean gave him a questioning frown. What could possibly have caused him to take such and instant dislike to Charlie of all people? But Cas avoided Dean's eyes, and there were too many people in the room for Dean to pick out the details of his scent. Maybe he was just feeling shy and he would warm up given time.
The three adults tiptoed out of the room, leaving Claire sleeping peacefully in her fortress with her honor guard of teddy bears, sock monkeys, and other such fearsome beasts ready to defend her from bad dreams.
. He was so absorbed in kissing Dean, he didn't even realize something was missing until Dean pulled away to say, "Uh, could use a hand here, babe."
"So why don't you?"
Dean had never expected to even get to call Cas his
"Dean isn't like that." Castiel stood up and put some distance between himself and her insidious words. He understood now why he'd been called in here alone. She was going to try to turn him against Dean since she couldn't forbid them from seeing each other. "He's a good man."
"No. You should stay here and rest up," Dean said firmly. "Besides, do you really think it's a good idea to leave Kevin alone with Crowley?"
Babi or Baba are common diminutives of the Russian word babushka which means "grandmother". Since Castiel's surname Novak is common throughout Russia and Eastern Europe, it made sense to me that he would call his grandmother that.
Sam took the bacon off the fire and gave Dean his undivided attention. "What about Cas?"
Castiel barely restrained a snort. "I'm sorry.
again. Whatever the hell they were.
wink did things to Cas that the one from the waitress definitely hadn't. "Don't worry, baby. You'll get a turn in my mouth later tonight."
“Well, now I
As he watched Dean’s face contort with pleasure, every detail fully visible in the sunlit room, and listened to the symphony of little groans and mewls that came from the other man every time he sank down on Cas’s cock, the realization hit Cas like a freight train.
"Yes. Sixty seven?"
"I love you," Dean whispered for Cas's ears only.
"Hey," Dean nudged him and nodded across the room. The other gay couple was making their way over. Clearly they had the same idea as Castiel earlier.
Several of the staff gave Dean pitying looks, and Gabe muttered not quite under his breath, "Uh oh. Someone's in trouble." Castiel ignored them and led Dean into the pantry. If they thought this was a patented Chef Novak telling off, so much the better. They would think twice about interrupting lest they get caught in the crossfire. There were advantages to being feared.
"Yes. No. Everything hurts. I love you too."
"Oh, as opposed to your delicate, ladylike hands, jerkface?"
Jack considered this. Then, with the unique ability of childhood to treat all moments equally important and unimportant simultaneously, he said, "Okay" before closing his eyes and falling asleep.
Dean laughed. "Both? There were definitely sparks flying last night. Please tell me I didn't imagine that."
Castiel reached for the remote and paused the movie. "Dean, I'm sorry if this is too heavy a question for less than five minutes after our first kiss, but I need to know. What are you looking for here? Because I can't have a casual relationship. I have to think of Claire. She needs stability, now more than ever."
Dean accepted the invitation. He intended to keep it PG, but he quickly gave up on that and lost himself in the taste of Cas and the talented dance of his tongue which seemed determined to map out every inch of Dean's mouth and claim it as Cas's own personal territory. When they broke apart they were both breathing heavily, and Dean had to spend several seconds mentally disassembling the Impala's engine and naming the components to calm the potentially embarrassing situation in his pants.
"She's a professional babysitter," he said in answer to Castiel's quizzical look. "She helped out a friend of mine while his wife was in the hospital. She's trustworthy and really good with kids. I don't know what her schedule is like these days, but she might have an opening. Or she might know someone else."
Dean gave a shaky laugh and threaded his fingers through Castiel's hair. "There's that possessive streak again, Cas."
"No," he said, his voice cracking a little. "No, Cas. You don't really believe that. You made one mistake."
"Yeah, but it's still pretty obvious that you're …" The half of Sam's face that was visible was bright red.
that makes you happy without hurting anyone else is more than okay. It's
Except there weren't any other children. There was only Jack.
He lifted his head, and sure enough, those green eyes were open and watching him with undisguised want. "Happy birthday," he purred, settling himself comfortably between Dean's invitingly spread legs and immediately starting up an easy, rolling rhythm with his hips.
Castiel broke off, unable to say the words, but Dean understood. "They put the person out of their misery," he finished quietly.
“Is a check all right?”
He sank to his knees on the hard tile floor and looked up at Dean, his hands hovering over the other man's fly, waiting for Dean's nod of permission before popping the button and torturously slowly dragging down the zipper. Dean's lust-dark eyes were fixed on Castiel's face as Castiel eased the jeans down off his hips to completely reveal the beautiful panties.
For a few seconds Castiel found himself actually considering it. He didn't really have to play by Metatron's rules. He could pretend just long enough to get his grace back and get the angels on his side, and then …
Dean actually growled, and the sound sent desire shooting through Castiel like lightning. "Clothes off first," Dean said. "Want to see you. Want to feel you."
And holy shit, Cas
"Second of all?" Dean prompted gently. His mouth was suddenly very dry, and his heart was hammering. He was pretty sure he knew where this was going.
Dean must have heard the faint tone of annoyance because he quickly backtracked again. "Sorry. I shouldn't have said that. I'm an idiot sometimes. Can we just pretend I didn't say anything?"
"I'm not saying this because you're an omega! I'm saying it because …" All the fight abruptly went out of Dean, and he reached out to touch her cheek. "Charlie," he said, soft and desperate, "do you have any idea how many people I've had to bury over the years? Please, please don't make me add you to the list. I can't —" His throat closed up, and his eyes stung.
be awkward.
"Show me what?" he snapped.
"Her name was Jo," Dean went on, "and I had a huge crush on her in high school. Her mom owned this little diner, so I got a job there, washing dishes, bussing tables, basically doing whatever I was told, all for slightly better than minimum wage and the privilege of being around Jo. And the free food didn't hurt. Best pie I've ever had."
Dean dropped all defensiveness immediately. "No. No, he would never hurt you or the kid or anyone. I know that sounds weird because I just told you he killed someone, but … Look, it's a long story, and I can't tell you all of it. Not without Sam's permission. But can you trust me when I say he's not dangerous? He made a mistake that he can't ever fix, and he knows that, so he's doing everything he can to prove that he'll do better next time around. He's not a psycho."
Cas smirked and said, “You heard me correctly.”
Mary watched Dean fetch milk and sugar for the coffee, finish and deliver Cas's toast, and bring out butter and jelly. He banged each item down on the table as though it had personally offended him, but when he touched Cas it was like he was handling an injured bird or a fragile sculpture. There was nothing overtly sexual about the touches — a brief squeeze to Cas's shoulder, a hand on top his head lightly ruffling his sleep tousled hair — but every one expressed so much love and devotion that Mary found herself looking away as though she was intruding on something private. Intimate.
"What the hell happened?" Gabe asked as he grabbed a plate off the pick up counter. "Chef yelling at Naomi is just another Tuesday, but you?"
want to do. They had only been dating for a few weeks, and he had only shared his heat with Luc because he developed an allergy to his then current suppressants. The doctor adamantly refused to prescribe him anything new until he'd been through a full cycle to purge the bad stuff from his system. He had been terrified. He'd
Dean gently took the pad from Castiel's hands and read down the list. "You forgot to put where we'll be buried and who'll speak at our funerals," he said dryly, but Castiel had seen his finger pause at the line that said
But no sooner was the creme brulee finished and delivered, then Alfie the dishwasher bumped into one of the waiters, and a lobster destined for table two ended up on the kitchen floor. The boy apologized so profusely and frantically that Castiel didn't have the heart to get mad and just told him to clean up the mess and be more careful in the future, but a fresh lobster had to be prepared of course which held up several other orders, and then table nine ordered the quail. Apart from himself, his sous chef Anna was the only member of his staff Castiel trusted to cook the delicate bird without ruining it, and she was currently in the bathroom for what seemed like the twentieth time that night. He couldn't really be annoyed with her either. Only a complete asshole would resent an eight months pregnant woman for needing to pee, and Castiel was really a very nice person if a bit of a perfectionist.
Cas took the book as gently as if it was a baby bird. It was obviously one of Dean’s favorites judging by the layers of scotch tape holding the spine together, and Cas had a feeling that he wouldn’t have loaned it to just anyone. “So if I like it, I buy you dinner, and if I don’t like it, you buy me dinner?”
"Hey. No. Don't talk like that," Cas cut him off firmly, or as firmly as he could while slurring his words. "You are not a coward, Dean Winchester. You are the bravest man I've ever known. And we can share this from now on. Focus on that." He was losing the battle with unconsciousness, so he decided to just surrender now. It was the middle of the afternoon, but a post-coital nap with his husband sounded like the perfect way to spend a Sunday.
Castiel liked the idea, but he looked to Dean before he said anything. Dean… had a rather odd look on his face. "Yeah, that sounds," he hesitated, "good. I mean, if Cas wants to."
"Cas?" Jess said, concern in her voice. "Oh, God. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you."
but only the original with John Wayne), childhood dreams (Dean: fireman, Cas: veterinarian or unicorn), and celebrity crushes (Cas: Brad Pitt, Dean: Christian Bale, Both: Harrison Ford), and had now moved on to siblings.
Dean froze mid-step. "What? I'm not… I mean, I wasn't…"
, and we will manage our finances in whatever way works best for
Castiel watched the struggle play out on Sam's face with sympathy.
~o0o~
Dean rolled his eyes. "Yes, fine. Just … Stand up carefully. Did you sprain anything?"
made Castiel feel about ten feet tall.
"Hey, babe." Dean poked his head out of the kitchen, saw the bags, and immediately came to relieve Cas of his burdens and give him a peck on the lips. "How was your day?"
Ms. Mills next words popped his bubble of unexpected happiness. "Mr. Novak, while I have you here, there are a couple other issues I've been meaning to talk to you about. Claire's grades are not what they should be. At her old school she was a straight A student. Here she's averaging Bs and Cs."
"Yes, I do." The last word was punctuated by the thump of a hand against the door. Cas was getting frustrated too. "Dean, when I say "ever", I mean in the history of the universe. I may be new to being human, but I am not new to being Castiel. I know my own mind, and I can say with certainty that I would never regret being mated to you. Of course, if …" His voice suddenly faltered. "If you think that you might regret it once your rut is over … I understand if you'd rather not tie yourself to me permanently. I'm not —"
“You really like burgers, huh?” Dean said, his voice still a little hoarse, though probably for other reasons now.
Cas didn't mean that he'd imagined receiving a claiming bite from some faceless alpha he had yet to meet. He meant that he'd imagined
consent. He didn't want Cas to do anything because he felt like he had to.
Dean did. Then he came over to the bed and propped one knee on the edge of the mattress, looking down at Cas speculatively. That look set Cas’s skin on fire. Dean was taking his time deciding exactly what he wanted to do, and whether he knew it or not, there was almost nothing Cas wouldn’t let him do. Cas had trusted him completely since the night Dean had stayed, holding him and helping him through his attack without ever making him feel weak or pitiable.
"Yes, actually. I would value your input." He looked at Naomi, silently daring her to make an issue of it.
But… no, that didn't make any sense. They could always adopt or use a donor. They had the money. Then he remembered what else Michael had said.
Dean laughed, but it sounded nervous, and he was suddenly tense although he didn’t push Cas away.
“Well, at least I won’t be sleeping alone tonight,” he muttered, scratching her behind the ears the way she liked. He wasn’t sure if that was comforting or just more depressing. Grace was a wonderful companion and certainly more than just a pet. Sometimes it felt like she was a part of his soul. But he would much rather have Dean Winchester in his bed. Oh, well. Maybe next time. There had definitely been a spark. He hadn’t imagined that.
Dean gave a dismissive wave. "I'm awake anyway. I can make coffee while you supervise the little monster."
A belated happy birthday to my dear MandalaRose! I hope this chapter is a good present. 🎂
"I agree, it's to be expected," Ms. Mills said calmly. "This is not a criticism of Claire or of you. It's simply one of several warning signs we've noticed."
Dean just smiled at her. It was the complete opposite of the smiles he gave Castiel. All charm, no sincerity.
"I found something you should see," Sam said, still refusing to uncover his eyes. "Meet me in the war room when you're … finished." He bumped into the door frame on his way out, and Dean snickered.
"Naked. Now," he commanded, tugging Dean's shirt up.
“Do you regret telling him?” Sam asked, puzzled by Dean’s tone. It was almost fearful.
Cas was quiet for a moment, and then he said very softly, "I'm not sure
Cas frowned. "Dean, what are you —"
It was odd seeing him so still and peaceful. When he was awake, Dean was always full of restless energy like a humming beehive. It was one of the things Cas loved about him. He reached out and lightly traced the line of Dean’s jaw, stubble prickling his fingertips. God, the man was gorgeous. There were little lines at the corners of his eyes, more than there should be on a man in his late twenties, but Cas found that beautiful too. Dean had clearly led a difficult life, yet somehow his soul had remained pure and innocent. He wasn’t just the most physically attractive man Cas had ever met. He was also the most genuinely kind and caring.
"Whoa. Hey, babe." Dean steadied him and then pecked him on the cheek. They had relaxed their no-kissing-at-work rule somewhat, but kisses on the lips could still get out of control fairly quickly as evidenced by their unintentional PDA earlier, so they tried to save that for home. Even so, the brush of Dean's mouth on his skin, the catch of stubble and the warm whisper of breath had Castiel's eyes slipping closed for a moment and the tension melting out of his shoulders. "Sam says thanks again for dinner and for, you know, giving him a chance."
"Why not? Is it a big one? I don't care how old you are, you know."
“My dad was an alcoholic. He used to beat me and my little brother.” Dean blurted out the words like they might burn his mouth if he didn’t get them out fast enough. Then he continued, slower and quieter, “Sometimes he’d just up and disappear for a couple weeks, and part of me always hoped he’d never come back even though I had to shoplift to keep us from starving to death. We lived on the streets for a while too, and that was a whole other kind of hell.”
“My magic number. Four. I’ve slept with four men. And one woman, but I don’t count that because … Well, let’s just say we both came to the conclusion that I was most definitely gay.”
"Thank you." Cas took a sip and hummed in approval. "It's delicious."
At that moment the door opened and Dean came in. The alpha immediately caught the scent of Castiel's pain and fear, and in an instant he was sitting on the bed, gathering the omega into his arms, and being much more careful of the cast than Castiel himself had been. "I'm here, omega," he murmured. "I'm right here, baby. I'm so sorry. I just went out to get us some food. I didn't think you'd wake up while I was gone. You were pretty deeply asleep. Must have been the drugs they gave you at the hospital."
Castiel retrieved it from the counter.
The problem was that he had stupidly told Charlie that he was in love with Cas one night back in college while they were drinking together. He had sworn her to secrecy once they sobered up (okay, more like pathetically begged her not to tell anyone,
. She blinked at Cas and said in a somewhat disappointed tone, “You’re not the pizza man.”
"And that was how it went for the next eight years. Some places were better than others, but nothing lasted long, and I learned not to get my hopes up. Jimmy and I weren't often in the same home, especially as we got older. It's rare to find a foster family willing to take on two teenage boys, and I had gotten a reputation as a challenging child. Not undeserved. I was… I was very angry."
"Poughkeepsie."
"It's not random. The sheriff said that the victims were all unhappy, lonely, in pain in some way. The Rit Zien can sense pain, home in on it. That's how they find the wounded in the chaos of the battlefield. And if the wound is beyond their ability to heal, they —"
This produced such a tangled knot of emotions inside Castiel that he began to cry in earnest. Bewildered and desperate to comfort his omega but having no idea what the cause of this sudden meltdown was and therefore no idea how to fix it, Dean pulled Castiel into his arms and rubbed his back soothingly. Even Castiel wasn't sure what was making him so miserable, so he just chalked it up to residual heat hormones and let the tears flow.
Warning: Brief discussion of homophobia
“Gabe,” Cas said warningly, a rare blush warming his face.
"Dead," Dean reassured him. "I stabbed him with his own blade."
"He looks like you."
Even knowing what the response would be, Castiel wouldn't have been able to resist telling Jimmy about Dean, about how happy he'd been lately.
"You're worried that once your alpha instincts see me as
Castiel's heart swelled with love, and he texted back,
a sleeping, naked man. Their combined body heat had turned the space under the blankets into a furnace, but despite that and his full bladder, Cas didn’t want to get up just yet. He squirmed onto his other side so he could see Dean’s face.
gesture. John had yet to acknowledge his younger son's presence, so it was probably going to be one of those visits where Dean had to repeat Sam's questions before John would answer them.
to reflect that and put
"So you understand why I can't give him into the care of just any alpha. Especially after the debacle with Jack's biological father proved that he doesn't have the best taste when it comes to alphas."
Castiel laughed. "Yes, I think that pretty much sums up everyone's story. Although in my case it was a man, not a boy."
"It's not the same. Jimmy and I weren't anywhere near as close as you and Sam. We may have been genetically identical, but the only other thing we had in common was a horrible childhood that we would both rather forget. We saw each other on Christmas and talked on the phone maybe once a month. I don't even know why I miss him so much."
"Seriously, Cas?" Dean said as Castiel rejoined him on the couch. "We're not negotiating a new contract."
Nevertheless, he couldn't resist saying innocently, "I didn't know you knew sign language, Sammy." He was a good brother, but he wasn't a saint.
" He swallowed as much as he could, licked up what escaped, then painted Dean's chest with his own release while the other man gazed up at him like Castiel was the sex god here, like
but not to you?”
a classy lady. Tell you what. I'll give you a ride home tonight and you two can get acquainted."
"Sounds great," Dean said with one of those smiles that lit up his whole face and warmed Castiel from the inside out with its glow. "Did you have somewhere in mind?"
"Oooh. Are we at the meet-the-family stage already?"
Whoever had made those marks, Cas wanted to kill them.
“We do this family movie night every couple months. It’s usually just me and Sam and our foster sister Charlie. Sometimes her girlfriend comes too. It’s really casual. We just watch movies and eat junk food. Sometimes we play video games. Do you … Would you be interested in that?”
Dean bite him, knowing it didn't mean the same thing to the alpha that it meant to Castiel.
He wrapped his arms around her and kissed the top of her head, certain that Cas would understand.
"I've got you," Cas murmured against Dean's lips. "My good Alpha." When Cas took him in hand and began to stroke him, Dean felt tears leak from the corners of his eyes, but his Omega kissed them away, murmuring encouragement. "Let go, Alpha. I've got you. You've taken such good care of me today. Now let me take care of you. Let go."
"Damn, that was good," Dean said, stretching luxuriously and tilting the chair back slightly. "I think I'm gonna have to keep you, Cas."
through your eyes. You clearly love her, and when we put love into something, it becomes more than the sum of its parts."
By this time they were inside the car, and the proud owner turned the key in the ignition. The engine rumbled like a tiger, and Cas found the sound inexplicably comforting to his jangled nerves.
"Oh, for … We were
Dean shrugged. "Don't know." He was watching Castiel laugh with the same look of warm affection he'd worn when Castiel appreciated his car, but now it was mixed with a glint of possessive pride.
"Oh, no. No, he believes us. He just doesn't think
Gabriel met them at the gate and immediately pulled Cas into a tight hug. Cas held onto his brother a little longer than he usually would, knowing that this was the only warm welcome he would get.
. It had been a long time since Dean had let go like this.
It was during a lull in the conversation, both of them starting to feel full and a little bit drowsy, that Cas realized the couple at the next table was having a loudly whispered argument. About
Castiel relaxed. "No, but he stays over fairly often since I can't leave Claire alone. Claire likes him. He's very good with her." He couldn't help the goofy little smile that took over his face whenever he talked about Dean. Thankfully Dr. Bradbury was too professional to mention it, but the twinkle in her eyes said it was very obvious just how head over heels in love he was.
?” Michael demanded, jerking his chin toward Dean without looking at him.
is too much. I will not let some stranger fuck me just because this stupid body demands it. I would rather die."
"Yes. But …" This part was always hard no matter how many times he did it. Even with Principal Mills' assurance that Dr. Bradbury would be open minded, it still scared him a little, saying the words to someone new, but he took a breath and added, "There's also my boyfriend." Because no matter how short a time they'd been together, and no matter what certain people might have to say about two gay men raising a child together, he and Dean
The ten minute walk to the school gave him time to calm down and consider the appropriate reaction. His foster parents had usually sided with the teachers, not even listening to his side of the story. He wouldn't do that. As far as he was concerned, Claire was innocent until proven guilty, and he wouldn't punish her if it had been self defense. However, as Principal Mills had warned him, piecing together what had actually happened was difficult. The teacher supervising recess had seen Claire shove another child to the ground. The other child claimed it had been unprovoked, and Claire of course wasn't saying anything. She couldn't even be persuaded to write down her version of events. It was like all the progress of the past few months had been erased in a single day, and she had retreated deep into her shell.
"I believe that you sincerely believe that," Castiel said levelly, "but you're his brother. I'm not sure you're the most objective judge of his character."
horny. This was the longest he'd gone without sex since he and Dean started sleeping together, and his body had gotten used to at least one orgasm a day. More on quiet afternoons like this. Jerking off wouldn't be anywhere near as satisfying as having Dean's big, calloused hands on him, but it might take the edge off enough to let him get some work done.
Realizing that she might not want to be stared at while she worked through her feelings, Castiel said, "How about I make us some hot cocoa."
Missouri looked up from her knitting as they came through the door. "You're early. How was the movie?"
She whirled on him, soap suds dripping from her hands onto her gleaming kitchen floor. Her eyes flashed with an anger he had never seen there before, and her usual roses and lemon verbena scent turned cloying, like a vase of rotting, moldy flowers. "You think you're ready to be a father?" she demanded coldly. "A good father would do what was best for his child no matter how difficult it was. Jack is
Cas let go of Dean's hand, stood up, and stalked — actually stalked, slow and smooth and predatory — around the table until he stood right behind the alpha. "I'll show you." He leaned down to breathe the words directly into Dean's ear. "Later."
The music had started up again, and couples were moving out onto the dance floor that had been set up in the middle of the yard. Jess was twirling in her husband's arms, flushed and radiant with love, and Sam was looking at her like she was the only person in the universe. Bobby and Jodi were swaying gently on the spot, gazing into each other's eyes. Charlie and her girlfriend Jo were taking turns dipping each other and giggling like children.
"Mating?"
"It's fine," he said. He made an effort not to push Dean away, instead gently disentangling himself from the other man. "I'm fine. I'll make breakfast today, and after I drop Claire off at school, we can do whatever you want." He tried to give Dean a lascivious grin but could only manage a tight, forced smile.
Castiel leaned against Dean in relief. Everything hurt, and a bone deep fatigue was settling over him as the adrenaline of the fight wore off. Dean's arms accepted Castiel without hesitation, and he rested his chin on Castiel's shoulder, murmuring into his neck, "It's okay. I got you. You're okay."
~o0o~
“No. Just a small panic attack.” Thankfully. A different kind of attack could have forced him to go back to the hotel, and he would have expended all that effort standing up to Michael for nothing. Not that anything he’d said had made a difference. No, it was Nick’s blackmail that had gotten them through the door which would only reinforce the family’s belief that Nick and Cas were the same — black sheep, rebels, sinners.
When he came down enough to notice his surroundings again, he sensed immediately that something was wrong. Cas' scent had changed from thunderstorms to stagnant water, and he wasn't looking at Dean but at the door.
“Yeah, definitely, but … Look, don’t take this the wrong way, but I kind of want to take things slow. Cause I usually don’t. I’m very impulsive, and I … I really like you, and I don’t want to screw this up.”
"Hi."
"Yeah, that'll be the adrenaline wearing off," Dean said as he angled all the vents in Cas's direction. "You sure you don't want to go to the hospital?"
When he came down, he was looking into sex drunk blue eyes. He realized he was still on top of Cas and basically crushing the other man since he didn't have the strength to hold himself up on his arms anymore, but when he tried to roll off, Cas clung to him and mumbled, "No. Stay right where you are."
"What about… what about scening? Are we still gonna do that?"
"Every hero needs a villain."
“Do you want me to go with you?”
Claire peered suspiciously at the white goop in her bowl.
"Mmm. That's a thought," Cas said, "or…"
Dean smiled. "Merry Christmas, Cas."
"Ah. Picky eater?"
want me to go with you? Yes or no.”
As he turned back to the pot, valiantly resisting the urge to pin Dean against the edge of the counter and taste the soup directly from his tongue, he felt Dean slide past behind him and drop a quick kiss to the side of his neck, murmuring against his skin, "Great minds." He smiled, not caring if he looked like the love struck fool that he was.
They turned, both grinning. Claire pointed to the perfectly flipped pancake, then pointed to herself.
me anywhere. I volunteered for this, remember? And you did warn me, so none of this is on you. Cas, look at me.”
Dean nodded, but he still smelled guilty and ashamed, and he wouldn't meet Castiel's eyes, so Castiel let go of his hand and tipped his chin up, catching and keeping the alpha's eyes with his.
As Dean stepped over the threshold, he brought one hand out from behind his back. It held a green ceramic pot full of dirt with a cluster of spiny green leaves growing in it. The plant gave off a distinctive spicy smell that made Castiel's mouth water. "Usually I'd bring flowers," Dean said with a bashful shrug, "but I thought you'd like this better."
Missouri wasn't in her usual place on the couch when Castiel and Dean got home, and the light was still on in Claire's room. Castiel's heart dropped into his stomach.
Dean kissed him again, harder this time to distract himself from the lump in his throat. Cas kissed him back just as hard, and before they knew it, they were frantically pushing clothes out of the way to get at skin.
Cas nodded. "Yes. I'm quite comfortable. I like this place very much."
For a long minute they just sat there, catching their breath and carefully not looking at each other. "That, um … that wasn't too much, was it?" Dean finally said hoarsely.
Dean nodded and tried not to analyze too closely why his stomach was still flip flopping with nerves. Yes, maybe he had once hoped that this weirdly intense friendship he and Cas had going could develop into something more, but with everything that had happened in the past few years — Cas dying and coming back, going crazy and getting brainwashed by Naomi — it was a miracle they had even managed to keep their friendship more or less intact. Asking for more felt greedy. Worse, it felt like tempting fate. So he would go in there, and he would talk some sense into Cas like a good friend, and then he would leave the rest to the professionals.
"You must understand, Dean," Michael said, "Castiel isn't just my little brother. He's like a son to me too. I raised him after our parents died. Did he tell you that?"
"Same as ever," Dean said flatly. "Ornery, stubborn, and pigheaded."
He didn't have a prayer of finding another babysitter by tomorrow night. He wouldn't be trusting that agency again, and he didn't exactly have a network of other parents to turn to. He would have to take more time off while he sorted this out. Anna and Dean together could manage, and even if Anna had the baby a little early, there would still be Dean. He was so popular with the staff, probably no one would even notice Castiel's absence. (That thought was more than a little bitter, so maybe he
"You want to stay with me tonight?"
Sam shoved his hand away, but he was smiling too, and at least some of the pain was gone from his eyes.
was what Castiel wanted to say.
"Uh huh. Can I be in your class?"
"Mmm hmm," Cas agreed. "I'm right there with you."
"Oh! Oh God, you were right," Castiel gasped. "Laughing during sex is the most amazing thing ever. Do that again."
"Well, maybe not
Dean slid in one last time and let himself go, his vision whiting out as his orgasm overtook him. He was only vaguely aware of Cas spilling over his hand, but he was acutely aware of the way Cas's body locked tight around his knot because it wrenched an immediate second climax from him, so intense that he actually screamed, and it took all his self control not to bite down on Cas's neck. He had a feeling Cas wouldn't appreciate being randomly mated while he was too heat drunk to have an informed say in the matter.
"Dude, of course," Dean said without hesitation. "Mi casa, su casa. Literally. Your name is on the deed too. I couldn't legally kick you out even if I wanted to which I don't. Stay as long as you need." A small, selfish part of him was jumping for joy, but he gave it a mental kick, and it shuffled off into the corner, properly ashamed of itself.
“Got it,” Cas said. His voice only squeaked a little bit.
The food served at staff meetings had no relation to the restaurant's menu. The kitchen staff took turns catering, and whoever drew the short straw that week cooked whatever they liked. This week it was Benjamin's famous ropa vieja with huge mounds of white rice and fried plantains. Leftovers were looking increasingly unlikely by the minute.
"Exactly," Sam said smugly. "The only way you, Dean Winchester, were going to have an honest conversation about this was if you got there on your own."
upholstered in black faux leather with silver studs, but it was mostly hidden behind a truly absurd number of navy, black, and cream throw pillows that matched the pattern on the thick navy blue comforter.
“Oh, yeah. I’m a carnivore through and through. All kinds of meat.”
Dean realized that at some point in the conversation he had flopped down sideways across his bed with his head hanging upside down over the edge. God, he was such a girl, but he was comfortable, and no one could see him.
Judging by the look on Dean's face and the lingering worry in his scent, he knew what Castiel was thinking, and this conversation was far from over, but he let subject drop for now. "So we're hunting an angel," he said. "Which means they'll look like an ordinary person right up until they smite some poor suicidal son of a bitch."
"Yeah, but I mean … I'm
"So when's
Dean's cock slapped his belly with every thrust, and he could feel the texture of the rope, the tassels swishing softly against his ass. He made the mistake of looking down, and fuck fuck
Dean sagged with relief, his head coming to rest on Castiel's shoulder. Castiel stroked his alpha's hair and kissed his neck. "You do deserve this, Cas," Dean said in a muffled voice. "You deserve more than this. You …" He lifted his head but only to rest it against Castiel's, their lips almost but not quite touching. "You deserve better," he whispered. "Better than me."
"Something Michael said to me got me thinking. He, um… well, he made some crack about me not being alpha enough to knock you up with babies of my own, and that was the only reason we wanted Jack. Cas, do you think this whole thing could be because Hannah can't get pregnant and Jack is their only chance to have a child?"
Dean sighed and ran his fingers through his hair, realizing too late that they were covered in bacon grease. Oh, well. He needed a shower anyway. "It's nothing. It's my own stupid problem. You don't need to worry about it."
birthday?" Dean said once they'd caught their breath. "Just so I know how much time I have to think of a way to top that. Pun possibly intended."
They went over the new menu piece by piece. This was always a tedious process, and made more so by the fact that Naomi pretended to know more about food than she actually did, but Castiel could have sworn that this time she was being more difficult than usual, and the dishes she argued about most stubbornly were all Dean's suggestions.
“Oh, yes. Many people. If I’m making you uncomfortable, tell me and I’ll stop.” Cas’s tone had shifted from seductive to serious in two seconds flat.
He looked much better than he had yesterday. There was color in his face, and though he moved carefully, he didn't seem to be in a lot of pain. Even so, Dean immediately barked, "What the hell are you doing out of bed? You could pop a stitch."
"Not yet you're not," Dean murmured only loud enough for Cas to hear, "but you will be later. I've got a special present for you when we get home."
That was it for Dean. He crossed the room in two steps, unlocked the door, and flung it open. Fortunately it opened inward so it didn't hit Cas, but the omega stumbled a little as the surface he'd been leaning on abruptly vanished. Dean caught him around the waist and kissed him, using all his self control to make it tender and loving, not rough and rut crazed. Cas made a noise that might have been a halfhearted attempt to finish his sentence, but then he gave up and just kissed Dean back.
"Told ya," Dean chuckled.
Slurred or not, it was an order, and Dean happily obeyed. He could feel both their heartbeats, and Cas's skin was almost feverishly hot against his, and he never wanted to move again. He buried his face in the curve of Cas's neck and breathed the scent of him — sweat and sex and fresh earth after rain. "Cas?"
"Oh. Cool."
But Dean was shaking his head even before the question was fully formed. He had clearly corrected this assumption more than once. "No. Car accident. He was driving here from the airport, coming home for Christmas, and a tractor trailer hit a patch of black ice, spun out, took three cars through the guardrail with it. They said his neck was broken, so he probably died instantly." This was all said in a flat, toneless voice.
"Slide it under nice and gentle. That's it. Now lift up and quickly turn the whole thing upside down. Perfect!"
"I would have asked for it even if she didn't like it," Castiel said. "This is amazing. You could open a restaurant and serve nothing but this."
He was pointing to a mural on the tile wall above the kitchen sink. It depicted a beach and two little boys building a sand castle. Cas was sure he recognized the golden haired boy with the green eyes and a sprinkling of freckles on his cheeks. The smaller boy with the unruly brown curls tumbling into his face must be a young Sam.
Castiel didn't deny it.
"No. Dean, you should spend time with your brother. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have —"
"Kind of the opposite," Anna said. "We were just talking about tha—"
"Good," Cas said and leaned across the table and kissed him.
But of course his only answer was a solemn stare.
"How, ah … how did you know?" Dean gasped out, his arms coming up to clutch at Castiel, feel the movement of his back muscles.
Claire's face lit up and she was about to tear off the wrapping paper when she paused and looked worriedly at Castiel. Clearly Jimmy had taught her not to take gifts from strangers without checking with him first.
"Seems like you've already done something about it."
After almost half an hour under the warm spray, he was completely calm and also completely hard, the thunderstorm scent of his own arousal infusing the clouds of steam that filled the bathroom. He turned off the water, dried himself, and dumped his towel and dirty clothes down the laundry chute before walking naked to his bedroom where he was greeted by a sight that was equal parts hot and adorable.
"Deputy Connelly of the Pontiac Sheriff's Department. I'm sorry to bother you at work, Mr. Novak, but I'm afraid I have some bad news. Your brother James was in a car accident earlier this evening. He … He didn't survive. I'm very sorry."
After he'd cleaned up himself and Cas, he dug his phone out of his jeans and sent Sam a text.
"It's fine," Cas said. "No harm done." The reek of alcohol and vomit assaulted his senses, and he breathed shallowly as he tried to slide past the man in the narrow hallway.
"Well, it's fitting that we should have our first post-Covid date night in the place where you proposed to me. New beginnings and all that."
by the sound of it. Hell, your food is the main reason
He knew this was an opportune moment to have the relationship conversation. Sam and Kevin were both asleep. Crowley was of course locked in the dungeon. No one was going to interrupt them. And sex was a complete non-issue for several more days so they wouldn't get distracted, and they could really discuss this rationally.
"What? What the hell, Cas?"
Dean looked surprised, but he hugged her back and said, "Have a good day at school, kiddo."
"He made a mistake," Dean said. "He doesn't deserve to die for it."
"Well, why didn't you
They were in their old bedroom at Bobby and Jodi's house. Jess was getting ready in the big master bedroom down the hall, and Dean had strict orders not to let Sam so much as poke his head out the door until Bobby came to get them. As nervous as he was, which was very, Sam was also kind of enjoying this quiet time, just him and his big brother, here in the first place he had ever called home.
"Good," Cas said. And then the smug bastard put his head back down on Dean's shoulder and promptly fell asleep.
Cas didn't react to the sounds of the door opening and closing, so Dean cautiously approached the bed and reached out to touch his shaking shoulder. "Cas?"
Castiel happily snuggled into his alpha's side. It felt even better now that he knew it meant as much to Dean as it did to him.
Dean frowned, puzzled, but he let Cas roll him onto his back and pull the panties down over his hips. When Cas stood up and stepped into the panties himself, Dean's eyes went wide and his soft cock twitched bravely, refractory period be damned.
"When did you …"
Dean retrieved it, then came back to kneel between Castiel's legs. It was not lost on Castiel that their positions had completely reversed. "Do you have a preference?"
Dean nodded. "Okay."
And once again I cannot thank EyumdaRelmera enough for all her help, advice (both taken and ignored), and emotional support. I promise to protect you from the pitchfork wielding minions, hon.
Sam needed no further encouragement, and before his brother could recover enough breath to protest, he had launched into a tale of the time sixteen year old Dean had styled his hair in a bright blue mohawk.
Dean blinked. Then a grin spread slowly over his face. "Are you kidding? Of course I want it."
"So you're her only living family?"
All too soon the inexorable tide of arousal forced him to pull away.
comes to her snooty, overpriced restaurant. If she doesn't think your safety is worth losing a couple of asshole customers over, then believe me, there are dozens of restaurants in this city that would jump at the chance to hire
On her way to the door she patted Dean's arm and murmured something Castiel couldn't quite make out. He gave Dean a questioning look as the door closed behind her. Dean shrugged, his own cheeks more than a little pink too. "She said, 'You be good to him. He's a keeper.' I think it was her version of the hurt-him-and-I'll-kill-you speech."
~o0o~
By the time they were settled back on the couch with their cocoa however, the easy atmosphere had completely evaporated. They were as awkward and uncertain of each other as if they were meeting for the first time. Fortunately the movie gave them something to do other than make conversation, but Castiel had never really liked action movies, and his mind kept wandering back to Dean's offhand comment.
"No, no. She's healthy and safe, but we do need you to pick her up a little early today. There was … an altercation with another student."
"Hey. Come here." Sensing the omega's rising panic, Dean stood up, pulled Cas out of the chair and into his arms.
sorry. To think I could have gotten to see you in those panties years ago if I'd just had the balls —"
"When we were twenty one, I scraped together the money to buy a ring. I only told two people — Dean, and my best friend Brady." Sam closed his eyes and took a deep breath, steeling himself for the bad part. "Well, it turned out Brady had a drug problem, and he was in debt to some pretty dangerous people. He thought that diamond would get them off his back, so he went to our apartment when I wasn't home, and of course Jess let him in. Why shouldn't she? He was our best friend. I don't know exactly what happened next, but it ended with Jess bleeding to death on the floor. I found her hours later."
"Six."
Dean's fingers traced the scars on Castiel's legs, but he didn't interrupt.
Cas gently disentangled himself from Dean and began to undress, folding his clothes neatly before returning them to his suitcase even though they would just get dumped in the laundry as soon as he got home. Dean averted his eyes from the sight of Cas' toned back muscles and the dark feathers inked on his biceps moving hypnotically as he stripped off his undershirt. If he got any more worked up, sharing a bed with Cas tonight really
