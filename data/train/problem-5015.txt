That was mockery, wasn't it? They were all far too casual about coming back from the dead, Clint reflected. He had died, and then been brought back... somehow. He still wasn't sure exactly what Wanda had done, but since it had resulted in Clint Barton still walking around breathing air, he wasn't complaining.
"He deserved it," Sam grunted, as he tried to keep an invader's gun pointed at the ceiling.  He was white, of course — all of them were white — and nearly as tall as Sam was, packed with muscle despite the fact that the blond stubble on his chin was patchy with youth.
Loki laughed, the sound sharp and mocking. "I have spent centuries chained to a rock in Hell. I have slept in the arms of giantesses. My children are called monsters. Do you think I will balk at a few mere scars?"
Cap let go and slowly withdrew his hand, looking miserable. He reached back and rubbed the edge of his shield, sighing. Peter wondered if Cap was even aware of that particular nervous habit; he was pretty sure he was the only one who had noticed it.
"Are you sure you're all right?' he asked, taking a step closer to Tony. Tony had been on edge lately, unpredictable, and there was clearly something very wrong here no matter how fine he insisted he was.
those things. By really stupid, dangerous methods. I can't go back and undo them, and I can't ever apologize enough, but I really am sorry. I... you need to believe that."
"Are you all right, Cap?" she asked. "I was trying to grab her, and then she just — where the hell did she go?"
Loki had as good as told him of her intentions, threatening Thor and everyone connected with him unless he did what she bid him.  He had refused, as anyone with honor or sufficient experience would have.  He should have expected this.
"The city's going to want me to pay for that lamppost," Tony said. It wasn't an actual answer, but he wasn't sure he could give one right now. He wasn't actually injured, beyond the bruises, but there was definitely
Tony left the doorway and went to stand beside Wanda. "One of us should have realized that something was wrong before it was too late," he said, keeping his eyes on Hank instead of on her.
Wanda snorted. "We could have used you a few months ago in LA. He and Hank took the microwave apart to use some piece or other of it to make an electromagnetic field generator."
Tony was still moving, grabbing Sin and jerking her around, and Steve had a long, horrified second to both see Sin's arm draw back, to see Tony thrust his repulsor gauntlet into her chest, and know exactly what each of them was going to do.
"It's my fault," Daredevil mumbled. "I dragged him there, and then I didn't hear the guy who stabbed him."
"No, he came to warn me not to have sex with any men." Tony's face was tense with strain, but his sarcastic little smirk was the same as ever. "Loki's spell apparently had a charming little booby trap built in."
doesn't even trust them to work safely right now." It had been Wanda herself who insisted that she not be sent in to the disaster site, claiming that she didn't trust her powers so close to central Manhattan.
"I can not believe you didn't even check," Sam muttered, shaking his head again. "You're supposed to be a strategist."
"Huh," Tony said. "I dated him too, after the Rolling Stone thing. I think I actually met him when I was there for the photoshoot."
"It's okay," he shouted, trying not to drop her as she kicked at him. "I've got you! You're safe!" Whatever had happened to this woman, she clearly wasn't hearing him; she just kept on screaming and struggling.
The room was a shambles now, sprayed with blood and filled with smoke from sparking and smoldering equipment. Nick Fury's severed head stared blankly at her from one of the workbenches, a line of bullet holes trailing down its forehead and between empty, robotic eyes. "Check the bodies," she ordered. "Kill anyone still breathing."
Sparks were smoldering in her clothing, and Steve could smell the sharp reek of burned hair.  She was limping badly, covered in blood, and her left arm hung motionless at her side, flesh dark and swollen.
Carol landed on the lawn, avoiding the crater, and turned to wave at the security camera she knew was there. If the old defense system had been back online, she would have been dodging lasers all the way to the ground, but as it was, nothing greeted her but stillness and silence. The construction crew still working on the interiors had obviously gone home for the day.
"I don't think I like this new A.I.M.," Clint commented. "It used to take MODOK at least a week to get his plans in motion after a jailbreak."
Nice use of the passive voice, Hank thought. You had to give him credit for that. His ability to convey information to Hank or Tony without actually addressing them directly was improving. It was also getting both ridiculous and really, really irritating.
"It must be nice having your own castle to hide out in," Sam observed. "At least the Wrecking Crew is still locked up. Maybe we'll get lucky, and they'll actually stay that way for a while." Redwing, perched on his shoulder, made a trilling noise that sounded almost like agreement. Jan was never sure exactly how much human speech he understood.
Don poked at the puncture wound on the outside of Clint's thigh, cleaning the dried blood off with an alcohol swab. "This was made by one of your arrows, wasn't it?"
"How else was I supposed to promote my book?" Carol edged around a trio of businessmen who were standing smack in the middle of the path to the main door, talking loudly to one another.
There were moments when it did feel like the Avengers were whole again, the entire messy disaster of Registration over with, but the aftereffects still lingered. The police had seemed relieved to be able to hand the A.I.M. situation over to the Steve and the others, but some of the bystanders who had gathered to gawk at the fight with A.I.M. had just as much fear and suspicion in their eyes when they looked at the Avengers as they did when watching Madigan rant. Nearly a year since Stamford, two months since the SHRA had been repealed, and some people were still suspicious of anyone in a costume.
The silence hung there for a moment, leaden and accusing, though Jan wasn't sure who was accusing who. "Your old rooms are still open," she said to Wanda. "You didn't bring much luggage; I guess you're not planning to stay long?"
Clint froze, unsure what to say. Cap always knew what to do, and usually had no problem telling everyone else what
They weren't going to have a couple of weeks, but for now Tony was safe from everything except the Extremis and his own stupidity.  Steve didn't actually need to check on him, any more than he needed to talk to Bucky, who was also perfectly fine, regardless of whatever horror film imagery his subconscious had come up with.
She made a face, gathering them up again. "Every spread I do comes out like this. It's statistically impossible. Even
"They gave him a shot of anti-venom and some steroids for his lungs," he told Steve. "The SHIELD medics think he'll be fine."
The sound of running footsteps brought him sharply back to attention, and he was halfway to his feet, shield ready in his hand, when Sam staggered to a halt in the doorway.  "You're alive," he panted.  "Good.  Sin said she'd killed you.  Said she was going to ship your head to Barnes in a box."  His eyes went to Tony, and he winced visibly.  "Is he-"
Steve hesitated in the doorway. Pepper must have sensed him somehow -- heard him, maybe -- because she looked up, stared at him for a moment, and then gave him a rueful smile.
Clint cringed visibly, his shoulders hunching up. "Thank you for that. God, Chthon could have made me date rape her again if I'd gone back to get her. I hadn't thought of it that way."
Sam had been on edge, too, throwing himself into the practice with a little too much enthusiasm. Because of the John Donne manuscript, probably. He and Wanda were both uneasy about it, and they still hadn't managed to get Strange on the phone.
"You have concealed things from my shieldbrother as well." Thor released his hand and stepped back, folding his arms across his chest. "You are gravely ill."
"I just..." he started, then stopped, shaking his head. "I don't like fighting with you. With Thor. Not about important things."
Deep fried twinkies were an X-Men tradition, one of the few Wanda had ever adopted. Pietro would never admit to liking something so classlessly American, but that never stopped him from eating three of them in a row, and it was also one of the few things she and John had ever bonded over. He might be a chauvinistic jerk, but U.S. Agent understood the appeal of sugar and grease almost as well as an energy mutant.
Steve almost didn't hear Thor's shout.  The small, dark interior of the vault suddenly seemed almost suffocating, Doom looming in front of him surrounded by shadows, and the air was suddenly too thick to breathe, reeking of incense and blood.  There had been a dead man in the corner, hanging from the ceiling like an animal in a slaughterhouse.  He'd forgotten that.  How could he have forgotten?
He was never sure if she was joking or not when she said things like that.  Was Clint the only heterosexual person on the entire team?  Hank barely counted, what with naming himself after various female insects.  The next thing you knew, Sam would turn out to secretly like guys, too, and Jan would hook up with She-Hulk and that would be kind of hot.
He couldn't stay away from the office forever, though. There was the board meeting the day after tomorrow, and...
"Yes," Hank said, not looking up from the tiny screen he was staring at, "you should have planned for Chthon to reanimate Jack's frozen corpse and bring it back from orbit."
Steve's fingers paused on his own buttons. "I think the construction crew keeps one in the living room. Why?"
"He can hear just fine from over here," the Falcon called back, taking a step forward so that his body was halfway in front of Don and Loki. His teammates occasionally forgot that he was a superhero as well, and every bit as capable of defending himself as they were; maybe it was the cane.
How useful would one of his old Ant-Man helmets be without the ability to shrink down and interact with ants on their own level, anyway? The frequencies would still work, even if he and the helmet were at full size...
Steve shrugged. "He can fend for himself." Tony might not actually enjoy politics, but he was good at them.
This time, the rage was entirely Thor's. Don felt it anyway, magnified by his own frustration at their inability to find his alter-ego's lover; he'd wanted to find her badly, for Thor – at least one of them should get to have a fresh start with the woman he loved.
"True or not, trying to Loki-proof our security is useless."  Tony tapped a finger against the print-outs of what data Steve and Carol had managed to salvage from the mansion's security systems.  "Forget her.  Doom and Sin are the weak links there.  Wherever they teleported to, it was within a five mile radius of the Avengers Mansion."  Which covered almost the entire island of Manhattan, with no guarantees that they'd teleported directly to their final destination.
"We would have needed to redesign the airframe to handle the increased stress, and we didn't have the money back then because I was still trying to get SI back up off the ground," Tony said quietly. "Also, don't talk about me like I'm not here."
"You sound like Jessica," Carol muttered. "I know it wasn't her fault," she repeated, more calmly this time. "Cap told me. Tony told me. Simon and Jessica told me. Clint told me. Even Wanda told me. And then Clint... Chthon hurt her, while he was in her head. Used her body to do things. It's not her fault. It's ours, for not stopping it."
"Yeah, I'll think about it," Rhodes said, in a tone of voice that implied that he had already dismissed the idea.
He could feel sweat prickling against his skin, along his ribs and back, could smell the faintest hint of sulfur cutting sharply through the must of candles and incense and old stone as Chthon's power lashed at him. It battered at his shields, against the edges of his mind, full of malicious intent.
changed was the thin spot in the fabric of reality located just beyond the polished brass altar rail, a blurred space in the air at what would have been head height for a short man – or for a woman of average height. Tendrils of chaos energy writhed invisibly around it, perceptible only to those who had eyes to see, and knew where and how to look.
He’d been on the operating table for nearly eight hours that time.  In retrospect, Steve wasn’t sure how he could have been so calm about it – he hadn’t known Tony as well then, hadn’t realized how much would be missing from his life if they had lost him.
Sam dropped to the floor and reached under the couch, grabbing for the scruff of his neck. The cat squawked, and tried to bite him, raking Sam's forearm with his back feet. It was nothing compared to the damage Redwing could do to his arms and shoulders without even trying, especially not through a long-sleeved shirt, so he ignored the needle-sharp caws and hauled the cat out, handing it up to Steve. "Here. Maybe he'll feel safer if you take him to the other end of the mansion."
Sam nodded at Steve's shoulder, and Steve belatedly realized that he was holding his right arm awkwardly, stiff against his side. "Iron Man said you'd gotten hurt," Sam said. "How bad is it?"
"I will pull you from active duty if I see you using the Extremis," he said into Tony's skin, as he started unbuttoning Tony's shirt. It was a promise, not a threat. "And to hell with Chthon. You'll be a liability if you end up in such bad shape that you can't take care of yourself in the field."
"Actually," Wanda said, "I'm staying, too. Or at least, I was thinking of staying, if it won't cause too much trouble, to keep working on this. I'm sorry, Tony. I've been studying chaos magic on my own, but I haven't had anyone to teach me since Agnes. I have much better control over my powers than I used to, but I know I'm not doing as much as I could. I should be able to fix you."
That was an even more frightening thought, somehow. A hex placed on Tony's unborn child could have done far worse to him than a relatively uncomplicated miscarriage. She could have given him an ectopic pregnancy, eclampsia, made his miscarriage turn septic, all with the best of intentions.
"Jan," Tony interrupted, keeping his voice level, "do I play the 'two of my friends aren't speaking to one another anymore; I must get them back together' game with you?"
Don might have too much in the way of professional ethics to gossip about people's medical records behind their backs, but he wasn't the only Avenger who knew his way around a pharmacy. And professional ethics had never been one of their resident chemistry expert's major concerns.
"I hate this," he muttered. "These stupid breasts move whenever I move." He nodded at Wanda's chest. "Yours are at least a cup size larger. How do you stand them?"
If he didn't come up for air tonight, she was going to the Mansion to fetch him. It was always a bad sign when Hank stopped sleeping.
"You're pulling your punches," Steve informed him. He crouched down beside Tony, hands resting loosely on his knees. "I shouldn't be able to do that so easily."
Sam shook his head. "Look if you want to help her, go downstairs and help the doctors analyze this thing. You were nominated for a Nobel Prize in biochemistry; this is what Cap put you on the team for."
"You're not analyzing the mansion's security unless you can do it from here while the doctors finish checking you out," Steve said.  He was staring flatly at Tony, his arms folded across his chest, stern expression almost hiding the worry underneath.  He didn't sound like he was happy with the order, but he did sound like he was determined to enforce it.
He hit the ground hard, bad knee giving way.  He flung out his hands to catch himself, and both hands and knees slammed against a concrete floor, sending a numbing jolt of pain up his bad leg.
At least Clea wasn't there. The other woman was the daughter of a goddess, raised in a demon dimension; she had learned her first lesson in magic from Dormammu himself, long before she'd ever become Strange's apprentice. Wanda, human and only half-trained, couldn't hope to measure up, and it would have been humiliating to have to display her comparative lack of knowledge in front of Strange's first student.
Jan took off after the woman, catching up with her just as she reached the window and grabbing her by the elbow.
"Considering the amount of influence he's able to exert on the world while still imprisoned..." Strange let the sentence trail off, the pause lingering ominously. "He intended to use Wanda to obtain the chaos power stored within Baldur's Bane, which would increase the powers at his disposal just enough for him to breach the walls of his prison. Once free, he would be undefeatable, especially with Loki's power added to his own."
He was preparing to pointedly ask if Tony was all right when Tony stopped abruptly, his back to Steve. "We can talk about Doom later," he said, a note in his voice that would have sounded dismissive if Steve hadn't known him well enough to recognize the tiredness behind it. His shoulders had stiffened, the weary slump of moments before gone. "I talked to Maya," he added, then fell silent.
"Rogers," he said as he activated it. With any luck, it would be Tony, announcing that he and Jan had finished with the reporter and were on their way home.
"It would have gone ill for the Falcon had we not. He has much skill and valor, but those do not protect against explosions as Ms. Marvel's invulnerability or an Asgardian's strength may."
He could still remember the horrible gurgling rasp of Tony' breathing, when they'd found him again last year, after two long months spent wondering whether he was alive or dead. He'd been so angry, then. He'd spent a lot of the past two years being angry at Tony. For the drinking, for disappearing, for not taking care of himself, for not caring
“You-“ words failed Steve for moment.  “You just scanned all the equipment in the room with the extremis, didn’t you?”
Sparring with Sam was both less playful and a better work out than sparring with most of the rest of the Avengers; with Wanda and Clint, Steve still thought of himself as a teacher, and probably always would, and with Tony, sparring had a way of turning into something else entirely. It had been the same way with Sharon, and with Rachel.
Sharon nodded, then grimaced at the collection of SHIELD agents that were blocking the spot where Sin had fallen from view.  “Synthia Schmidt was on two different international terrorist watch lists, with outstanding warrants and extradition orders out for her in a half dozen countries.  If you were military or police and one of you had shot her, you’d be media heroes.  As it is... this is going to be a political mess.”
Smiling at her felt... strange. This entire conversation felt slightly surreal; discussing 'the good old days' as if they were any group of old friends reminiscing, as if the past year's worth of disaster and death hadn't happened. As if they hadn't all failed each other so spectacularly.
He needed to get out of here, before he did something embarrassing like pass out cold the next time he stood up. One public fainting fit in front of government officials had been enough to last Tony a lifetime, and keeling over now certainly wouldn't do his still-tarnished image any good.
Steve could feel himself blushing. "I don't see how that matters," he said, more primly than he'd intended to. "Or that it's any of your business." He didn't actually add "young lady" to the end of that, but the temptation was strong.
"It  ain't," Logan announced, dropping his evening-long pretence that he  wasn't there with them, wasn't listening to them, and didn't know them.   "Spidey here was just giving us a demonstration of why it took him  until now to figure out that you two have been sleeping together for the  past two months."
Sam nodded.  He didn’t look okay – he looked battered and shell-shocked – but since he was conscious, mobile, and coherent, Jan took him at his word.  “Iron Man’s hurt pretty bad.  Strange, too, I think.  I don’t know about the Scarlet Witch.”
"Our scientific consultant has spoken to both your exhibit curator and to several archival preservation and manuscript conservation specialists from the New York Public Library's special collections department at length," Jan said, smiling up at him with publicity-perfect charm. Beside her, Steve was projecting square-jawed trustworthiness for all he was worth.
"I hate to say it," Carol said, so softly that the communicator only just picked it up, "but in some ways, the city might be better off if she hadn't come back." She didn't need to specify who 'she' was. "Except... I would never want her to stay trapped, not like that. But if what happened when she destroyed the mansion is anything to go by, things are going to get a lot worse."
Hank shrugged one shoulder. "I could try to talk to him for you. I've been working on some X genome studies for him. They're fascinating; it's really a combination of genetic sequences, not a single gene, and-"
What was he going to do with all this art? The framed pieces should probably go back on the walls. Unless Tony didn't want them there — he was the one who'd taken them down in the first place. Probably because he'd been sulking, just the way Steve had been when he'd come stomping up here and re-arranged all of Tony's books.
He wasn't going to think about that tonight, especially at a party where he'd be surrounded by alcohol. Tonight was for business, and he had too many people at SI depending on him to be allowed to fuck up.
"I should give this back to Bucky," he said, carefully working it free from its spot between a Terry Pratchett novel and a leather bound copy of
The next step was nosebleeds. Steve wasn't sure what happened after that — Tony had never pushed the Extremis that far, after damaging it so badly fighting the Mandarin — but it couldn't be good.
things were was a blank, as if something had dragged a hand over her memory and wiped an entire section out. Or perhaps she hadn't been there to remember it at all – the thing-that-was-not-her-aunt might have just switched her off like a doll, and put her away until she was needed again.
After a moment, Tony said, quietly, "I know you're back. I know it's okay." He wrapped an arm over Steve's shoulders, his hand resting on Steve's back, as if to hold him in place. "I am getting better, I swear."
Jessica  Jones and Luke Cage came into the hallway, both of them dressed to go  out, as was Steve.  Peter had already left, and Jessica Drew was  presumably getting ready to go right now.  Tony, whom Steve had found  tearing apart a Quinjet engine, was the only one not dressed for a night  on the town.
The head was about the size of her palm, made of some kind of silvery metal, and the haft was wood, just over two feet long.  Sin frowned at it; she'd expected something more impressive, as well as larger.  This looked almost like a toy.
Steve covered his face with one hand, his ears going bright red. "You're not going to get a chance to kill him, Thor," he growled. "I'm going to do it first."
Wanda was saved from having to reply to his probably-trite platitudes by their arrival at the Mansion's back door, where they caught up with Tony, Don, and Hank.
"What the hell are Winter Soldier and Agent Carter doing here?" Tony asked. He straightened up, knocking away Steve's hands as he helpfully tried to redo Tony's shirt buttons. "Did you tell either of them we were going to be here?"
"If I hadn't said anything, you'd have arranged for me to wear one of those Businesswoman Barbie suits that have a miniskirt instead of pants."
"I... haven't mentioned it to him," she admitted. Strange had only reluctantly agreed to take her on as a student, and his own powers were so perfectly controlled. Clea's, too - the other woman had been using magic her entire life, much as Wanda had, but Clea was centuries older than she was, with far more experience.
"Look, I'm desperate here. I spend half the day reminding Gauntlet that he's not allowed to call seventeen-year-olds pussies, and that Vance is going to telekinetically throw him through a wall if he calls the New Warriors baby-killers one more time, and the other half explaining to everyone who will listen why one horrific training accident shouldn't be allowed to shut down the program."
"Hank's running some tests on mutant blood chemistry for Beast," Steve offered. Despite the seriousness of the topic at hand, he couldn't keep a smile off his face; Tony worried about any phenomenon he couldn't explain and therefore have at least the illusion of control over, but watching news broadcasts of men and women weeping tears of joy over their returning powers was enough to make Steve willing to accept the mysterious return of the X-gene with only a few reservations.
Tony went limp and boneless as Steve mouthed gently at the worst of the scars on his chest. His hands were still at his sides, Steve noted, with mild surprise. They had stayed there throughout all of it.
“I’m sorry,” he offered, not quite sure what he was apologizing for.  “You’ve just woken up, I shouldn’t-“
Sharon let it go, though Jan saw her surreptitiously wave one of the medics toward Sam before directing the other to see to Clint.  “We’re taking all you into custody until we can get this mess sorted out.  Director Fury wants to debrief everyone involved in this, including Parker, Cage, and Daredevil and anyone else they dragged into that mess at the cathedral.
What hold had he had over Sin, that she would carry on fighting for his warped cause even after his death, to the point where she tried to
Everyone in the room dutifully drank. It wasn't until Steve was putting his empty glass down that he remembered that he'd decided they were all going to stop playing this stupid game.
Steve nodded, but made no move to leave, standing beside Tony's bed, one hand grasping the metal railing that ran along the edge of it, staring down at Tony, something strange and intense in his face.
Surely he wasn't so insecure in his masculinity that watching Jan fight without him bothered him. She could take care of herself; she had for years, with and without Hank around. And it wasn't as if she were on her own – she had the entire team with her.
"I was thinking," Tony said, staring across the table at Steve through his eyelashes and lowering his voice slightly - exactly like this afternoon with the DoE representative, except that this time, it didn't make him feel dirty, "that we could have dessert later. Back at the mansion."
"Oh," Peter said, softly. That was... he remembered the sharp jerk at the end of his webline as Gwen stopped falling, remembered Harry lying on a gurney as the Goblin serum in his system degraded into poison. "That must be horrible. I hope he comes out of it soon."
As he stepped forward to seize the nearest victim by the arms, Tony spared a moment to be grateful that it was a weekday, and the city schools were in session at this time of year. Hank's antidote worked as well on children as adults, but subduing a child in order to spray anti-toxin in its face was far, far down on the list of things Tony ever wanted to do.
"That would explain why his name's red-flagged in our medical database as a known superhuman," she said, half to herself. "At least he has bones. The last superhuman we had in here had an exoskeleton."
It was horrible of her to think, but she couldn't help but be almost grateful that Tony had been affected too, because the only way that this could be more humiliating than it already was would have been if she were the only one who'd collapsed on one of her teammates crying -- in public, no less.
"What do you mean, 'we're leaving,' Victor?" Sin snapped.  Her voice sounded odd, harsher and deeper than usual, with a trace of a German accent.  She let go of Sam as if he were something disgusting and swung around to glare at her men, one hand going to the earpiece just visible beneath her hair.  "I'm not through here.  You promised me Rogers' death.  You-"
"Good art should be accessible to the average person. If it's a form of social protest, people should be able to understand what you're using it to say without needing you to explain it to them." He sounded really pompous, didn't he, Steve thought, wincing a little.
Tony looked up to see her tattoos flaring a dull cherry-red, like iron that wasn't quite hot enough to work with.
"I'm taking you to the Modern," Tony told him, as if it had already been discussed and decided upon.
"You belong here." The whispery voice echoed through the house, faint, but seeming to come from everywhere at once.
"How come I've never heard of this?" Tony asked. He was still smiling, not the soft expression he usually wore when talking about Steve, but an openly amused one.
Better, Thor thought, that he had left more swiftly. For he had imagined that he knew everything there was to tell about Hank and Tony's betrayal, about the soulless copy of his body they had made, and used as a weapon against those who had been his shieldbrothers. The idea that there was yet more treachery to learn of made him grind his teeth in anger, the air about him growing thick and charged with energy as it did before a storm.
"We can't destroy him." Tony's artificially distorted voice behind her made her stiffen. How long had he been there? How much had he heard? Carol should have heard his metal boots scraping against the pavement as he came up behind them, or felt the disruption in the air as he landed.
When the last of the tools rolled into his foot and was still, and the last echo of metal on concrete had died away, his head still hurt, his chest still had that odd, lurching flutter inside it, and he was still going to have to give up the Extremis or risk making himself unable to do the job when the team needed him.
Carol had insisted that it might be a trick, that they had no way of knowing whether or not Wanda was actually sane again, or had used her incredibly powerful chaos magic to influence Strange into
She wanted to let Chthon possess him, use his body as a shell to house a demon. Burn his intellect and soul out of him and leave just an empty doll behind for Chthon to-
Peter managed to make it back upstairs without encountering the slightly intimidating nurse. The hallway was empty now, Hawkeye and the Falcon nowhere in sight. Peter belatedly realized that he had no idea how was he supposed to find Hawkeye. Everyone had been acting as if he were still an Avenger, but he didn't have a communicator anymore, and he wasn't exactly part of the gossip circuit, either. He supposed he could go try and find that duty nurse from before and ask her if she'd seen a guy in a pointy mask and purple leather, but...
"It was after..." Tony shook his head, trailing off. "She said things about Steve, and about me, the last time I let her interview me. They weren't true, and I didn't want to listen to them. I don't really remember what I said then. Shouting might have been involved."
The elevator doors opened with a discrete, expensive-sounding chime. It was a far shorter ride than it had been in the tower, but by the time he stepped out into the ground floor hallway, Steve's frustration had shifted focus from Tony to himself. Why had he let himself get sucked in to such a pointless argument? He knew Tony hadn't been using the Extremis — if nothing else, he wouldn't have been typing so fiercely if he had been — but he still couldn't help worrying, or the momentary flash of suspicion he felt whenever Tony closed his eyes and rubbed at his face or temples while working on something. He'd seen that gesture so often while they had been trying to take down the Red Skull and the Mandarin, when Tony had been so completely and continuously immersed in the Extremis that he'd forgotten to eat, stopped sleeping, and begun having the first few of what had become a long series of nosebleeds.
"Yes," Sam said, "it is. You know it is. You're Captain America, and four months ago you came back from the dead. Everything you do is a news story, especially right now." He took the magazine away from Steve, folding it up again; Steve watched the pictures disappear from view with something like relief.
Tony glanced down at his watch again. It was exactly two minutes later than the last time he'd checked it. "Do think Strange really is on to something this time? He's been meditating on it for a month."
The prospect of a nice, loud argument vanished as the sick thrill of fighting with Tony soured in his stomach. "Don't joke about that."
Carol rose into view outside the window, stepping carefully over the broken glass and back into the room. "Who else needs to go down?" she asked.
"That was an accident!" Tony snapped, the strain in his voice clear even though the helmet's voice modifier. "His armor malfunctioned!"
"No, I took Indres. I gave Pepper and Happy extra tickets." Pepper was significantly more than just a secretary - that wasn't even her official job title, and hadn't been for years - and she needed to be present at events like this every bit as much as Tony did. She was the one who filled in for Tony any time he couldn't be present for something, the one who scheduled pretty much everything around him, the one who knew where the bodies were buried and where the records were filed and who the right person to call to deal with the latest crisis was. Or at least, she had been.
Damn it. It had been easier when he could just yell at Tony, stomp off and sulk for a couple of days, and then pick up afterwards as if nothing had happened. A single stupid fight was hardly going to damage their relationship, but where a good shouting match with Tony had once been just another way to blow off steam, now it was more complicated.
Tony was staring at the floor now, shoulders slumped. "Strange thinks the spell is getting stronger over time, tightening its hold on me. Hank ran blood tests on me when I was first changed. I was infertile then. I've never even menstruated." He laughed, the sound edged with hysteria. "I was relieved about that. I thought I was lucky, that at least that was one part of being a woman I wouldn't have to deal with."
He straightened up to find Tony watching him solemnly. "You're limping," Tony said. "I'm sorry for teasing you about Jack Monroe. I forget other people who aren't me actually possess shame."
Summoned him? Summoned who? Safe from what? Wanda pulled away, yanking her arm free from the other woman's grasp.
It was a rookie mistake, but Steve looked to see who she was yelling at.  Luckily for him, Doom was doing the same thing.
"And he'd be right," Jan said, leaning her chin on one hand and looking up at Steve with a little smirk. "Which pizza place do you want me to call?"
Knowing it was stupid even as he did it, Steve glanced over at Tony.  He wasn't moving, his armor still silent and dark, and-
"Sorry, Daddy," she mumbled, rolling to the side to avoid a burst of gunfire. She should have known better than to trust a contact made after so long a stretch of silence. Sin reached into her pocket and triggered Doom's teleportation device.
The days when he had fallen for Loki's tricks were long past. "And what would you do with it then, brother?" Thor asked. "Whom would you slay? Which of the Aesir would you make a feast for the eagles? Where else on Midgard would you sow chaos and destruction?"
People who weren't from New York always had an exaggerated impression of how dangerous it was — or how dangerous cities in general were. It was a toss-up whether the media liked scary inner-city gang violence or maniacal supervillains more in terms of depicting the city as a dangerous place full of sub-human criminals. Not to mention, "Where else are you going to get to work with a collection like that?"
"We did well this day." Thor's deep, rumbling voice echoed in Steve's ear, and only long familiarity kept him from jumping slightly. "You were a most admirable distraction, my friend." He clapped Steve on the shoulder with one massive hand, the force of it enough to make him sway forward a little.
"Thank you," Wanda said, not turning around.  The staircase now ended in a jagged, broken stub at the first landing, jutting out into mid-air with a pile of rubble beneath it.  A length of scorched and twisted metal that had once been a robotic arm was sticking out from under a pile of splintered floor boards.  None of the Doombots were still moving.  Seen from the corner of her eye, they morphed into brightly colored metal and plastic, red and yellow and green reverting back to green and silver only when she looked directly at them.
"Clint and Wanda are downstairs in your lab," Don told him, as the elevator doors slid shut behind the three of them. "You should call them and-"
"I'll leave you alone, then," Don said, and Clint almost told him not to. Asking him to leave was a bad idea; it would probably be less threatening if he stayed, and he was a nice safety barrier between Clint and having to actually look Wanda in the face. Even if the idea of someone else hearing what Clint and Wanda were about to discuss was... well, the whole team might be learning about it soon enough. Maybe it would have been easier to get it over with one at a time.
He was going to have to be careful, Steve realized. Hold back just a little, the way he did when he trained with Wanda.
The green and yellow fabric of her cloak made the colors around her seem dull, and her golden helmet blazed like fire in the natural light that flooded the three-story-high room, courtesy of the immense windows. If it came to a fight, the falling glass from shattering windows alone could be potentially lethal.
Matt grabbed at him abruptly, his hands pulling on Strange's arms and disrupting the building forces of the spell. "You're bleeding. Hold still and let me see where you're hurt." He began patting down Strange's arms, his torso, ignoring his attempt to pull away – and then his hands brushed against the knife handle.
"We haven't run the second-level tests yet," Hank protested. Expecting him to work out in the training simulation room was unfair; the mansion had a perfectly good gym with weights and punching bags and brand new exercise equipment expensive and fancy enough to make luxury health spas weep with envy, and, most importantly, nothing in it to remind him of the powers he wasn't able to use.
It was one thing running into Iron Man during an Avengers' priority alert every so often. Living under the same roof with Tony Stark again, however, would be another matter entirely.
"Captain America and the Avengers brought in people from some mass poisoning on Wall Street." Receptionist guy grinned, rolling his chair back a foot or so and putting his hands behind his head. "Do you know he's, like, seven feet tall?"
"No," Steve said. He tried to make it sound like an order, though he didn't think he quite succeeded. It sounded more pleading than anything else. "Stay. I told you you weren't going anywhere."
When superheroes couldn't trust themselves, it was impossible to expect the public to trust them, especially after disasters like Stamford. Proving they were safe, non-threatening, willing to follow the rules... had not been a very good solution, but it had been better than proving everyone's fears right would have been. Had been.
Hank shrugged back into his lab coat with an inner sigh of relief, and closed the storage cabinet door firmly on the folded pile of red fabric he'd just shoved inside it.
Actually, that idea had possibilities beyond simply keeping Tony out of trouble. Not that that could actually stop him from using the Extremis, but that just meant Steve would have to put a little extra effort into distracting him.
Wanda froze, staring blankly at the miniature screen in front of her. The little box in the corner still cheerfully counted down the kilometers remaining until they reached the runway at La Guardia.
and not at the Avengers Tower telling us you're back? Say, about... when did you come back, anyway?"
It had been a long time, Steve reflected, since he'd allowed himself a day off from being a superhero, to just go and do something normal. It had been even longer since he'd been able to do that with Tony.
"It's not your bad leg that's the problem."  Hank pulled at Don's clothes with huge hands, as if searching for injuries. There were fresh, red abrasions at his wrists, and Don found himself automatically thinking of rusty chains and dirt and wondering when Hank had had his last tetanus shot.  "You're covered in blood.  What did-" and then he found the stab wound and sucked in a sharp, sudden breath.
He should have thought of that.  If Doom had disrupted Tony's anti-teleport machine and possibly their communicators as well, cutting off all cell phone transmissions would be child's play.
Tony was poking at the anti-teleport device again. Had he been this bad at putting work down for five seconds before the Extremis? "I try to avoid the New York Post. Do they still run that awful picture of me from six years ago every time they mention me?"
The knocker on Strange's door was heavy, made out of some kind of metal that looked like brass and hummed under her fingers like something formed of far less commonplace materials. She had been here dozens of times, and each time, the pattern engraved into the metal had been slightly different.
is chasing you?" Tony stared at her. There were scratches along both of her bare arms, and her clothes were covered in dirt as well as scorch marks. There was a crumpled petunia stuck in her hair.
That was a very good question, actually. Would the pregnancy just disappear? Jan doubted it - a spell handcrafted by Loki would never be that convenient or nice. Yet another reason for Tony to decide not to keep the baby; it wasn't worth his life.
Tony was frowning at Strange as if personally offended. "This entire thing doesn't make sense. Wanda used the spear's power, and she's fine."
"After you and Cap's stupidity, everyone here's probably pretty tired of fighting fellow Avengers," Clint offered, after a moment of silence.
Tony had managed to escape from Englehart, and was now talking to the owner of a major Manhattan development company. Beyond him, Wanda was walking slowly down the length of the exhibit hall, stopping to study each piece. Hank was deep in conversation with one of the museum curators, and kept gesturing at a display case of 16th century laboratory instruments. Jan, beside him, was watching with a proprietary little smile that Steve hoped he hadn't been wearing when he'd been admiring the fit of Tony's suit jacket earlier.
"Did not appear to hinder him," Thor said.  "I have," he hesitated for a moment, "a theory about why that may be so."
Sam made a face at him, rubbing his chin, and said, "If you get last minute cold feet and try to run away to California like you did with Bernie, Hawkeye's just gonna send you right back. And he'll never let you live it down." His strike landed cleanly on Steve's right shoulder, and he rolled easily back to his feet when Steve grabbed onto his arm and used the momentum of the blow to throw him.
Hill ignored the gesture. "Agent Carter has been monitoring the Sin situation. She reports directly to Director Fury; you can tell either of us anything you would tell him."
Steve nodded. "You didn't seem surprised," he said again. "You were already thinking about how to keep their mission from being compromised while all I could think about was getting Bucky to stop bleeding. How many missions like this did you help clean up while you were running SHIELD?"
"I thought you'd be older. I mean, damn, you've been in this business longer than I have." It was said with certain amount of respect, which surprised Peter a little.
Steve was still awake, of course. He was waiting for Tony in the kitchen, where he had washed and put away all the dishes from dinner and cleaned up every trace of Barnes's blood.
Tony had obviously put on the armor in a hurry. Beneath it, he wore nothing on his upper body but a white dress shirt, currently translucent with water and molded to the muscles of his chest.
"Give whoever answers the code word 'Paladin,' and ask to speak to Agents Carter or Barnes. Tell them Synthia Schmidt is active again." Steve avoided using Sin's much more recognizable nickname; pedestrians were already gathering on the other side of the police tape, and there was no point in panicking people. "Tell them the Avengers have gone in after her."
MJ's eyes widened slightly, and she took Peter by the arm and pulled him away from the nurses' station, out of earshot. "How bad is it?" she asked, voice low.
Jan raised her eyebrows. "When your picture is on the cover of Maxim Magazine and the entire world judges your worth as a human being based on the dimensions of your ass, you can pick the soda."
They should have helped her, should have tried harder to get through to her. Should have noticed something was wrong before it was too late; by the end, whatever had been looking out of her eyes hadn't been Wanda anymore. The real Wanda, the woman Tony had been on a team with for years, would never have attempted to destroy an entire race of people.
Loki's smirk became a true smile, the same wide, gleefully malicious one she'd always worn in her old form.  "My stepbrother is awaiting my consort's pleasure.  He will be dealt with later."
For the first time since he’d met her, Steve welcomed the sound of Sub-director Hill issuing orders.
She strode forward – behind him and slightly to his right, he could hear the Falcon's hard light wings snapping out, hear Iron Man's repulsors crackling – and then she was in front of him, towering over Don by half a foot. "The day will come when you will wish that you had accepted my aid, Thunder God." She reached out and laid one finger against Don's face, just beside his left eye, the end of her talon-like nail resting against his skin. It took an exercise of willpower not to flinch.
"Don't ask," Don muttered. He glanced down at his cane, debating for a half-second the merits of turning into Thor and letting him handle this. On the one hand, with Carol apparently back on the West Coast for the day, Thor was the only Avenger here capable of going toe-to-toe with Loki. On the other hand, Loki might very well react to Thor's appearance in the lobby by blowing the building up, along with all the innocent bystanders who happened to be in it.
It had been a hard sell - federal budget concerns being what they were, the government wasn't going to fund SI's work unless they were satisfied that they might actually get useful results out of it - but once Tony had realized that the senior official was flirting with him, he'd known how to pitch the project. Lean forward a little, lower his voice to create a sense of intimacy and make it seem as if he were talking directly to the man, smile. Nothing that would make it obvious to everyone else in the room - under normal circumstances, flirting with a male prospective investor was just as likely to alienate half the rest of the room as work in his favor - but enough that the other man's interest in what Tony was saying increased perceptibly.
Steve stared at the ceiling and tried not to think of all the things that might be going wrong with the Extremis in order to cause those headaches, or all the potential non-work-related reasons for why Tony hadn't come home yet or called.
"Can we go back to bed?" Steve asked, not at all plaintively. "It's three am." Actually, it was probably closer to one, but he was tired. Also, Tony was about two minutes away from putting his head on Steve's shoulder and falling asleep standing up.
"I had good reasons for everything I did," he said now, as he watched Steve move and tried to decide when and how to attack again.
It wasn't unusual for Tony to do that. Steve firmly squashed the thought that Tony could easily have used the Extremis to call him at any point, without even the need for access to a phone; he'd spent weeks trying to get Tony to use the Extremis less frequently, and just because it would be more convenient for him right now if Tony used it didn't mean it couldn't hurt him.
There were a few moments of silence while Steve listened to Tony breathe. Then, from beside the bed, there came a sort of scrabbling noise, the kind of sound that might be produced by claws on metal. It was followed by the very faint thud of a small, furry body sliding off Steve's shield and onto the floor, then by an even fainter hiss.
"Tony."  Steve's voice came out harsher than he'd intended, his fingers tightening on Tony's shoulders.  "What the hell do you think you're-"
"Well, no," Steve admitted, "but there was a long, telling silence during which I could feel him smirking at me."
sick — part of him, in fact, felt very aggressively healthy — but the memory of Tony curled into a tight ball on the bed, eyes screwed shut in pain and dried blood under his fingernails, was still vivid.
"I believe he attempted to cleanse the cathedral of Chthon's power," Wong said. "Chthon... took steps to protect itself, and he tried to use the power stored in Loki's spear in his defense."
Tony's face was grey, and there were lines of pain around his mouth that hadn't been there a minute ago. He looked… bad. Sick.
The people who wanted to use her for their own purposes always sounded the same in the end. "I am Django Maximoff's daughter. Not yours. Not Magneto's."
Sin stepped forward, hooking one toe under the shaft of the spear and kicking it up to snatch it out of the air.  "I am chaos!" she shouted, empty, white eyes blazing.   "I was there before time began, and when the last star in the universe has crumbled to dust, I will remain.   Cower before me, mortal, and perhaps I will let you live."
Tony turned to face him fully, holding his hands up, palms out. "You're right," he said quickly. "I shouldn't have walked out of a meeting like that, informal or not. It was about Loki, not about you and me."
Maya hadn't asked any questions, just handed him a glass of water and gone back to her lab. She had never been good at comforting people, even those who wanted it, and he hadn't.
Maya smiled with cheer that he expected wasn't even forced, and advised Tony to see it as just one more scientific challenge to solve. She avoided pointing out that she hadn't wanted to give him the Extremis in the first place, which was nice of her considering that she mentioned how much easier it would be to fix it if she still had access to the Mandarin's rings at least three times, and pointed out twice that it was Tony's alterations and additions to the original Extremis coding that had made it vulnerable to the data corruption in the first place.
"When we get there-" she began, only to be drowned out by a squeal of feedback from her communicator as the chaos magic surging around them fried something.  She turned it off and raised her voice instead, shouting to be heard over the wind and the dull whine of Tony's jet boots.  "What you promised, before.  If Chthon takes control of me-"
"That lightning the other week would not have blown me up." The elevator doors began to close, and without looking, Tony thrust a hand between them, keeping them open. "The armor's designed to handle power overloads without exploding."
"So?"  Peter said.  Clothing didn't prove anything.  It was just… clothing.   And Cap and Tony definitely had separate rooms.   "Daredevil sleeps in  his law partner's t-shirts."
At least Barnes had gotten a taste of what was to come, even if she hadn't managed to kill Wilson or the Carter bitch.  Next time, she'd use a stronger poison.  Something messy, like strychnine.
"Stay with the nice man," Jan said through clenched teeth, shaking off Byrne's grip. The little girl hiccuped once, then let go, still crying, and latched onto Byrne.
Tony's eyes snapped open, and he glared at Steve. "No. I am closing my eyes because my head hurts and my eyes hurt from staring at computer screens all day, which I used to not have to do. Contrary to what the Post and the Bugle have been printing about me, I do have
"I've heard that you and Tony are involved now," she said, offering him a faint grin. Now that he was closer to her, Steve could see a scattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose; combined with the smile, they made her look impish despite her sharp suit.
"I'm pretty sure Nick's owned this place since before DUMBO got trendy." Steve frowned. "I thought your armor was water-tight."
Nowadays, he could have simply saturated a costume with Pym particles and let it grow and shrink as he did, but the old red costume had been created before he'd been able to do that, before the Pym particles had soaked into his bone marrow and bloodstream and made his abilities permanent, and before he'd been able to transfer them from his body into inanimate objects.
"I'll think about it." Tony looked up again, a thin, strained smile on his face. "Thank you," he said. "For understanding."
"He needs an ambulance, too," Tony added.  He gestured vaguely in Sam's direction, then closed his eyes and turned his face into Steve's stomach.
"You would think that," Wanda said, "but you would be wrong." She frowned slightly, fiddling with the seams on one red glove. "I think it's the doctor in him. When have you ever gone to a doctor's appointment and not ended up sitting around waiting for ages?"
Had he thought it would do any good, he could have explained that the levels of chaos energy in the city were slowly but inexorably rising, twisting the forces of chance and fate in their favor. The spear wanted to be found, the power in it hungered to be used, and given time, it would force a means of grasping it to surface. They simply had to bide their time.
The first thing Sam had done when he'd gotten the alert was to tell Hank to call whomever was in charge of the building the Meridian was located in and get him to have a copy of the building plans ready. The guy was supposed to be waiting for them in the lobby with the plans, ready to start the evacuation as soon as they got the go ahead from War Machine that it wasn't some kind of bioweapon.
It had nothing to do with Hank and Tony, she told herself. She wasn't rushing to forgive Wanda because she felt obligated to give the other woman a second chance after being so quick to come back to the pro-Registration side despite Bill's death, despite how uneasy HUSAC's actions and the Fifty State Initiative had made her.
Tony closed his eyes and shoved his hands into his hair, fingers pressing hard at his temples — it eased the remainder of the headache, at least until he stopped. Of course Doom hadn't simply given up after they'd thwarted his attempt to grab the spear last spring. He was Victor von Doom. He'd spent his entire adult life attempting to punish Reed Richards for getting better grades than he had in grad school, and earning a PhD two months sooner than he had. He never gave up when he could hold a grudge, and he would have had the resources to know about the John Dee manuscript well before the exhibit had publicly opened. Hell, the museum probably would give diplomats from the Latverian embassy tours of it, if they asked nicely. In fact...
"Someone just tripped a perimeter alarm." Tony accessed the video feed from the security camera closest to the breach, and frowned as he pulled up the image; Sharon Carter was crouching in the shadows by the newly-restored wrought iron fence. Next to her, his arm slung over her shoulders in a way that indicated to Tony that she was bearing at least some of his weight, was the Winter Soldier. Both of them were armed, non-SHIELD-issue guns drawn and ready.
Steve was already standing. "Armor up," he said. "I'll round up the troops. They're all listening at the keyhole anyway."
If he were being honest with himself, Tony looked more relaxed at the moment than Steve had seen him since he stopped drinking. Apparently, the secret to getting Tony to relax was forty-eight hours without sleep, mild blunt force trauma, and listening to his team trade embarrassing secrets with one another.
"In theory," Strange said, entering the room and closing the door behind him. "You were not Loki's original target. The spell used on you was designed to affect a god, and there are layers to it that even I have not yet proven able to decipher. I suspect that Loki sought assistance in its creation from a magical adept. However, though it has become increasingly obvious that the spell cannot simply be broken by the application of superior magical force, it may be possible to gradually remove it."
He lunged forward, shouting a warning, already knowing that he was too late, as a repulsor beam blew a hole clear through Sin's torso.   And Sin, impossibly still alive and upright, stabbed Loki's spear upwards, straight into the center of Tony's body.
Tony looked away, not wanting to see the guilt and shame that he suspected he'd find if he looked at her for long enough. Remembered that cold, sick feeling of waking up with no memory of the previous night and wondering what the hell you had done, and who you'd done it with. "No," he said, feeling very tired suddenly. "They're not. I shouldn't have brought it up."
"And did you know Pepper is afraid that I don't have enough experience for you?" Steve went on, trying to sound normal, as if this were a real conversation. "I wasn't about to say anything to her, but, well..." Steve trailed off. He was fairly sure he had managed to make up for any lack of experience in other areas. Tony certainly hadn't had any complaints. And then there was time that he had accidentally cracked the bed frame...
The media uproar had been slightly smaller than he'd expected; apparently Tony Stark changing back into a man was less newsworthy and fascinating as Tony Stark being turned into a woman. The board had been thrilled, though DeFalco had seemed somewhat disappointed during his meeting with Tony this morning when he'd walked into Tony's office to find a man sitting behind the desk instead of a reasonably attractive woman. Once Tony had begun showing him the results from the final stages of implementation at the geothermal energy plant, however, the Department of Energy representative had perked back up again. And when Tony had handed him the balance sheet of cost expenditures versus energy output, he'd positively beamed.
It shouldn't have been funny, had actually been excruciatingly embarrassing to witness at the time, especially the raw, open pain on Hank's face when he had walked in on the two of them, but the memory of Steve's appalled and exasperated expression when he'd chewed Clint out...
trying, Steve knew. Or at least, he hoped. He let the subject drop, along with wedding plans and whatever their teammates thought, and leaned up to close the distance between them again, capturing Tony's with his. His hands fit perfectly around the slim curve of Tony's waist, like they belonged there.
was what he actually wanted to ask, but Tony was reluctant enough to talk about this as it was, and those details were none of Steve's business.
"Chthon's one of the primal forces of the universe," Tony went on, as Carol and Clint turned to face him. "The best we can do is seal him up again. That's about all you can ever do, sometimes." His helmet angled slightly toward the ambulances then, and he added, almost to himself. "This shouldn't have happened."
Helicarrier conference rooms were beginning to tie with medical facilities for places Tony had spent far more hours of his life in than he ever wanted to.
"When he is, I'll take you dancing," Steve promised, recklessly. He'd danced with Bernie and Connie, and even Sharon, though she preferred unarmed combat practice to swing dancing. And with Diamondback, who had always tried to lead. Tony would, too – it was a nearly impossible habit to break, as Steve had learned when Rachel had tried to make him follow her and do all the steps backwards. Having Tony's arms around him in public would be worth tripping backwards over his own feet and looking like an idiot.
, the statement ought to have been laughable, but some quality in his voice made Steve believe him. Tony sounded tired and frustrated.
Chthon and Loki and the threat they both represented were far more important than his personal problems, whatever those were.
"I've never been half naked on the cover of Rolling Stone, though," Tony continued, referring to the group shot of the Avengers that had graced the magazine's cover early in their history as a team. Clint, prominent on the far left, had been wearing the shirtless Goliath costume. Tony, on the other hand, had been encased in armor from head to foot. "Oh, wait. No. I'm pretty sure I have."
Steve frowned, looking mildly appalled, and Tony hastened to change the subject. "Still, it's a shame the helium project didn't get the green light, too. Extracting helium-3 from moon rocks is, unfortunately, not cost effective enough, plus the Immortals have a monopoly on them."
'Lucky' wasn't the word Steve would have chosen. Someone had used Tony, taken advantage of him. Even, possibly, violated him. If he couldn't remember, there was no way to know whether he had actually agreed to anything that had happened, and he wouldn't have been in any condition to defend himself.
in," Tony corrected, wincing inwardly. He hadn't thought about how it would sound to Steve if he showed up and found himself barred from entering Tony's workroom. "I wanted to finish this without interruptions."
"Speaking of which, I should get back to the lab." Peter cast a guilty glance over his shoulder in the direction of Hank's commandeered lab facilities. "I don't know how much good I'm doing, but I'd like to think I'm helping some."
Things would have made more sense if he had been, but there had been no alcohol involved. "No." Clint shook his head. "I just don't remember. The whole thing's kind of like a dream, like it happened to somebody else."
The Meridian was located on the top floor of a very expensive downtown hotel, and was noted as much for the view from its large picture windows as it was for its food. It was only a three star restaurant, however. Jan had a feeling Tony had decided that a reporter from the Sun wasn't worth the expense of going somewhere with a fourth star.
They’d saved the world and almost died – actually died, in his case – and had damn well earned the right to dance with whomever they wanted.  Or would have, if that was something that had to be earned.
Tony ignored it, not looking up. The gauntlet was held together by a myriad of tiny screws, among other things, and if any one of them was loose, the structural integrity was compromised.
"Steve." Sam put a hand on his shoulder. Steve looked up at him, realizing dully that he was still stroking Tony's hair.
He'd actually been thinking of Frankenstein, but since Hank had said it first, "You'd think Ultron would have been enough for you.  And Clint says that now you're playing with mutant DnA.  Do you ever think about consequences for anything you do?"
The rest of the team would be finished talking to the press and the police now, and Steve would have gotten them all to gather in the conference room and go over the fight. What they had done well, what they needed to work on, how they had won and why.
The Night Nurse eyed Daredevil appraisingly. "I'll check you out when I'm done with Stephen and with those idiots from the bank robbery in room three," she said. "Supervillains," she added. "They always wait until the last minute to come in, and then it just makes my job harder. It took me ages to get the internal bleeding stabilized. Could you tell your friend Rand to hit people a little less forcefully?"
Don looked up again, glanced at Clint's outstretched hand, and pointedly tucked the piece of paper into his shirt pocket. "It's not either of our business."
The museum was eight blocks away, a ten minute walk for a normal person and a three-minute run for Steve. Neither Clint nor Steve could fly, and Jan and Sam couldn't carry another person with them while airborne, which meant that Tony was going to have to give one of them a lift. Clint, he decided, as the armor slotted into place around him. Steve could handle an eight-block sprint without so much as breaking a sweat, even carrying twelve pounds of metal on his back.
Tony, if anything, looked even more uneasy. "Strange didn't say that, exactly. He said he could only break through the dimensional barriers there, because a fragment of his essence is trapped inside the building. He didn't say he couldn't reach through and influence things in other places."
Tony snorted. "You're not the only one thinks that. We ran into my cousin Morgan at the ball, and he tried to hit on me."
His own grave wasn't there anymore. It had already been empty, and Steve had asked them to take the stone down the last time he'd been in DC. Standing there and looking at his own name carved into the white stone, no different from thousands of others, he'd felt cold, numb; seeing the physical proof of his burial had made what had happened to him real in a way that even Tony sobbing in his arms hadn't — he'd been dead,
Below them, people on the sidewalk were starting to stop and stare. They were too far up for their voices to be audible, but the faint honking of car horns drifting up from stopped traffic could just be heard.
She nodded toward the closed door at the far end of the reception area, her bright hair the only spot of color in the room. "He's in there. Tell him I've cancelled all his meetings for the rest of the day, and he can pay me back by actually showing up for the ones I've rescheduled."
Explaining  that he had come to rescue Tony from the proximity of alcohol would  sound silly.  "MJ wanted water with lemon.  That's three glasses.  And  anyway, I was just trying to be polite."
Carol had lost memories before, and had done things she was less than proud of. And she was kind of like a guy, which somehow made the idea of talking about this less intimidating.
Eventually, Steve was going to ask a few more questions about exactly how deeply Tony had been involved in that side of SHIELD's operations while he'd been director. It wasn't a conversation Tony was particularly looking forward to.
"I am well.  My counterpart's injuries were healed by the transformation."  Thor rose, and approached his teammates, concern growing as he neared them.  Hank was still being violently ill, his entire body jerking and shuddering, and the part of Thor that was Don Blake was cataloging symptoms, noting muscle tremors, nausea, weakness, lack of coordination.
Steve, in that position, wouldn't be willing to— Except that Steve was dead. Tony or Hank might be willing to kill her for the greater good, but Clint, Jan, Simon? They would want to save her at all costs, and there were some costs that she wasn't willing to pay.
"Okay, not horrible. Just annoying." When all else failed, Clint could always make Cap irritated with him. He liked to think of it as a finely honed skill.
“We could always hide behind the—whatever those are.”  Tony nodded at a large, feathery-looking bush that could have come straight out of Dr. Seuss illustration.
"Sure," Steve said, trying to keep the smug triumph he felt off his face. He'd lent Tony clothing before, once or twice, and certainly wasn't going to start objecting to the idea now. Tony looked good in t-shirts and jeans.
"It could be much worse," Hank agreed, remembering Wanda's open devastation after her twins had been erased from existence, the result of some kind of demonic magic he still wasn't sure he understood. "This is what you wanted, after all, right?"
"I'm on the verge of a breakthrough with the DNA analysis." Hank's voice rang with a particularly irksome variety of enthusiasm, one that indicated that he would likely pay no heed to what others said. "I can tell. If I just run one more test-"
The stones of Asgard were stronger than the mortal brick and mortar of the Avengers Mansion.  Let her bring her new allies with her; it would avail her not.  Here, Thor had allies of his own, allies less fragile than his mortal teammates, who were but a single shout away.
"These seal me away from Chthon's power. As long as I wear them, he can't touch me unless I break the barrier between us myself."
"Did that get him to stop worrying about whether Doom had sacrificed thirteen virgins to Satan to bring him back?"
Tony pushed his chair back from the workbench and stood; for a moment, Steve thought he was going to start pacing, or shove the chair back in hard, or maybe sweep something off the workbench with his arm. Something violent or restless. Instead he stood perfectly still, his body humming with tension.
Someone had needed to stick up for Simon. Jessica hadn't been there when Vision had died, when Wanda had tried to destroy them all. She didn't really understand how personal the betrayal had to be for Simon, who'd lost his entire remaining family in a single day. She thought he ought to be happy to have Wanda back, didn't see Wanda's madness as any different than what the Shadow King had done to her.
She had the right kind of voice for jazz -- alto instead  of soprano, and slightly husky -- and Steve enjoyed listening to songs  he remembered from before he'd gone into the army, but this time in a  setting that was refreshingly free of cigarette smoke.
"He'll be back tomorrow, anyway," Hank went on. And thank God for it. If Hank had privately thought that Steve sulked like a twelve-year-old any time Tony was gone
"It sounds like you have things under control, Dr. Avison," Tony forced out. "Why don't you take our visitors to see..." what had he not shown them yet? There had to be something. "To see the filters in action."
It did, in fact, give him an edge, enough that he was able to keep pace with Clint as they fought their way through the obstacle course of tentacles, lasers, and shifting floor and wall plates toward that nest of robots at the far end of the room.
The police would still be en route. If they hurried, they could beat them there, and maybe no one else would have to die. Sin would have automatic weapons, probably still had poison on all those knives.
"Aunt May has physical therapy on Thursdays. The guy at the desk in the rolley chair said you guys were here. What happened?"
"Cap?  Wasp?  Anybody hear me and care to tell me what that was?"  Clint tried his com link again, grimacing when it presumably failed to work.  Wanda's had been producing nothing but static since the Doombot had woken her.
"Armor's filters say it's a chemical compound of some kind," War Machine's voice crackled over the commlink. "No live DNA or bio-organisms. Tell the emergency people standard gas masks ought to work."
Wanda looked up, her face half-hidden by a tangle of dark curls.  "If you can get either me or Stephen within a few blocks of the book, we ought to be able to feel it then."
She'd left Hank and been prepared to leave the pro-registration side and her life as a superhero after Bill Foster's death, but she also knew how much Hank regretted it, and couldn't help feeling defensive of him. She didn't want to be angry at Thor, not when just seeing him sitting across the table from her still made her want to hug him in thanks that he was alive. He was right. What Hank had done had been terrible. Still...
The band switched to a slightly more up-tempo song, and Luke nudged Jessica Jones.  "You want to dance?"
She had used the small amounts of ritual magic she had learned from Agatha as a means of focusing her mind, and since, according to Strange, mental discipline was a vital part of the magic he performed, his training concentrated on that aspect of magic as well. Strange himself used the rituals he was teaching her for raising and channeling power, with the forms of the ritual serving, as often as not, as a contract with the forces he was channeling, but that didn't mean they couldn't be used for other purposes.
"Good," Pepper said. "I'm glad he's finally found someone who deserves him, instead of another stupid bimbo or a supervillain."
"Nay," Thor said. "I shall not leave." He strode further into the room to demonstrate this until he stood over Tony's desk, looking down at the top of his bowed head. "There are questions I would have you answer." More questions, indeed, than he had thought. To Tony's lack of honesty over the clone was added the matter of Tony's health; if he were ill, and concealing it, Captain America would be greatly upset, and though he did not approve of Steve's choice of lover, he did not wish his friend to be unhappy.
"He got better," Strange said dryly. "Victor von Doom brought him back from the dead with black magic. I was able to intervene and make the situation permanent."
Two metal tentacles emerged from slots in the wall and reached for Jan. This time, she dodged easily, twisting sideways to let one tentacle grope past her and grabbing the other in her hand. In her place, Hank would have grown about fifty percent and then tried to rip the tentacle out of the wall. Jan simply grabbed for the other tentacle and wrapped the two around one another, then abandoned them to make a dive for the holographic supervillain, who was trying to 'escape' from Clint.
Outside the airplane's thick window, the tops of fluffy white clouds glowed in the sun, almost blindingly bright. Only when she touched the window and felt the chill seeping in through the glass did it become obvious how cold it was outside. Those smooth, white mounds of cloud might as well have been snow.
Tony glanced over the menu; standard French restaurant fair, which meant Steve was going to get French onion soup and beef wellington. It was what he got every time they went to a French restaurant, to the point that Tony had once teased him for having such unadventurous tastes and taken him to a sushi restaurant the next time they met up to discuss Avengers business. He'd ordered the most bizarre and vaguely terrifying-looking sea creatures on the menu, just to see Steve's face when their food arrived, only to discover that Steve's tendency to order the exact same thing every time they went to a given restaurant concealed a hidden ability to eat absolutely anything.
The sudden spike of tension vanished. Tony leaned back on his elbows, as if sitting upright were too much effort at this point, and said, thoughtfully. "I've never been on the cover of Maxim magazine. I've been on the cover of GQ, though."
Whatever reply Zemo might have made was cut short by a howl of wind as Agatha Harkness raised her arms skyward and began chanting, Wanda's hex spheres impacting harmlessly against some invisible shield several feet in front of her smoke-wreathed form.
"That wouldn't solve anything." All the lawsuits Stark Industries' legal department could dream up wouldn't change people's attitudes. According to an unspecified number of parents whose children attended PS 58, an 'openly gay' superhero was not family friendly enough to be involved in their after school art program for struggling students.* Steve suspected — hoped — that only one or two people had actually complained, but apparently even one concerned and angry parent had been enough.
people, his head cocked slightly to one side like he was committing every move they made to memory. "There was a man praying in the chapel there. He just lost it, went completely crazy and attacked us. I didn't," he hesitated. "I didn't hear him coming. There was this whispering, drowning everything out, like it was coming from everywhere at once."
"Stay away from her," he snarled. "If you're even telling the truth, which I doubt." Loki had not been called the Father of Lies for nothing; she lied as easily as she breathed. And threats against a conveniently absent Sif were exactly the sort of bluff she would make.
They weren't even bad questions, except for the ones about Clint and Sam, who had both proven themselves dozens of times over and didn't deserve to have this kind of mud thrown at them, even by implication.
Sam snorted. "Knowing reporters? Probably. And you're more fun to talk about than the economy. You probably get better ratings, too."
"This is where you have always belonged," her aunt's voice went on, gentle but commanding. "Here. With me."
"I should probably leave," Peter said, before Tony could finish. "I... do you think Dr. Pym could use a lab assistant? I did major in chemistry."
Shit. "Tony," Steve said, exercising all of his self-control in order to keep his voice low and steady, "were you exposed to the toxin?"
Agent Hill would have said something cutting.  Sharon simply shook her head.  "It was the first thing we tried, while the doctors were still looking at you.  Doom is either blocking them or he's destroyed them."
be the first piece of furniture you got," said Steve, and Tony yanked him close and set about trying to make both of them forget the past few hours.
All right, so whatever this speed bump was, it apparently had something to do with Steve and Tony's decision to start fighting again.
"Are they always like that?" Rhodey asked, wide-eyed, as the door swung shut behind them. "I don't remember it being that bad, before."
The armor opened up under his hands, red and gold metal falling away and clattering to the floor, leaving Tony lying half in Steve’s lap. He wearing the remains of what had probably started the day as a nice suit -- wrinkled black slacks and a white dress shirt, the fabric crumpled into shapelessness by the armor. His hair was stuck to his forehead with sweat, and he was breathing in shallow gasps.
"It was over a year ago. I don't know why seeing him tonight shook me so much. I ought to be focusing on the positive; apparently it's really easy to talk people into setting up business meetings with you or settling lawsuits out of court when you're wearing a moderately revealing dress." He shook his head, smiling wryly, and it struck Steve once again how different Tony's facial expressions looked without the mustache or goatee to hide or emphasize them. The smile didn't reach his eyes. "I suppose there had to be some consolation for having this done to my body."
There was a faint thump, and a scratching noise from the window, and Steve looked up to see Redwing landing on the sill. The heavy, sick feeling in his chest lightened just a little; it wasn't much, but it was nice to know that Sam would be there for him if he needed it.
The kitchen door was open slightly, spilling a line of light out into the hallway, and as he approached, Thor could hear voices from beyond it.
She almost pointed out that he'd been the one to form the alliance in the first place, but daddy didn't like it when she talked back.
Wanda held up both hands, palms out, and the energy arced away from Clint, curving around him to burn a long furrow across the wall behind him.
Carol frowned. Steve preferred the movie version of Sam Spade to the more ruthless and less soulful-eyed original, and Tony preferred his manly pulp novels to be of the James Bond variety.
"Have either you or Tony bothered to explain what actually happened yet?" The Wasp's voice was faint now, but the words were still clear to Asgardian ears. Don Blake would not have heard them, but Thor did. "Because if not,
Maya snorted. "Well, when you've worked yourself into some kind of collapse, don't come crying to me."
Tony put a hand on his arm, giving in to the impulse to touch him, and didn't contradict the obvious lie. "Someday, we will manage a date that does not end in supervillains or disaster."
He'd been willing forgive Wanda for her reaction to everything that had happened to her, to her own loss of control. Why was Tony different? Was he holding Tony to too high a standard? Wanda to too low a one?
Tony nodded, and then he unbuttoned his shirt, fingers clumsy. Steve would have offered to do it for him, but he didn't think Tony wanted any help at the moment.
Doom inclined his head.  "Perhaps.  And perhaps not."  He lifted his own energy weapon and shot a long stream of blue-white fire at Clint, sweeping it across the hallway as Clint dropped to the floor to duck beneath it and started to roll back to his feet.
Sin crouched low as the rotating camera mounted on the corner of the bunker swiveled in her direction, and gestured to the men behind her to do the same. The camera was angled to detect motion at long range; this close to the building, anything less than two feet off the ground was outside its field of view.
Doom shot to his feet, nearly lunging for the mirror before he remembered the futility of that.  He curled his hands into fists, wanting to smash her face in, to wrap his hands around that long, white neck and throttle her.  No one dismissed him that way.
The artificial heart was ugly and alien-looking, an asymmetrical not-quite-circle of grey metal surrounded by scar tissue. There were a lot of scars, more than the last time he had seen Tony shirtless.
Hank made a bitterly amused snorting noise—the walls of her cell obviously didn't block or muffle sound.  "Fine, for now.  I'm not sure if Sin has a policy of not giving her prisoners food or water, or if she's just forgotten she's got us."
Clint, surprisingly, nodded. "The big guy's right," he said. "If she was possessed, it's not her fault. Nothing she did was her fault."
The man snarled silently at him and lunged upwards, his knife slashing at Steve's legs, only to skid harmlessly across his shield.
“We thought we were going to have to interrogate Doom about your whereabouts,” Sharon was saying.  “Until Stark contacted us.  Thor just grunted at me when I asked him, so I’m asking you.  Where is Dr. Pym?”
at Steve with the single-minded focus Steve had previously seen him give to complex mechanical problems and fanatical quests to get his stolen armor back. "Doing this with you almost makes being a woman worth it," he breathed, and leaned forward those last few inches to kiss Steve again.
"And an admirable exercise in brevity it was." Byrne smile at them toothily. "I think our readers would appreciate some more in-depth information. Just a few weeks ago, you costumed folks were fighting tooth and nail, and now you all seem to be best friends again. I can't help but wonder if there are any lingering hard feelings."
Sharon had said.  She’d told him to hold on, too, and her hands had been covered in blood just like his were now.
She turned and saw them then, and her face, so eerily similar to Sif's, contorted in a sneer. "I see my darling brother is too busy to speak to me, and sends his mortal companions in his stead. Unless..." her eyes went to Don, and her sneer shifted to something more amused, a sort of contemptuous smirk. "The little doctor. It's always such a pleasure to see you, brother, whatever form you hold, but I cannot fathom your attraction to this fragile mortal shell. It doesn't become you."
The glass shattered under the impact, the fire roaring higher at the influx of fresh oxygen. Agatha was chanting now, her voice half buried by the roar of the flames. "Shemek Iref Wenek Tjhen Inek It-Ek Chthon Djedeni Emm-Maat..."
"She still did it," Carol snapped, glaring at him. "How can you defend her, after what she did to you? She could do it again at any time, the moment she uses enough magic to fry Strange's seals and lets Chthon back into her head."
"If the data's any good.  None of us are computer experts."  If that was the case, and Jan and Hank spent more time in supervillains' hands than they would have if he'd given in and let Tony have his way...  Then he'd just have to deal with it.  It had been the right decision to make at the time, and second-guessing himself now wouldn't help anyone, least of all Jan and Hank.
He wasn't sure what he'd been hoping for — that there would, in fact, turn out to be a problem with the Extremis and it would be something they could fix, after which the headaches would go away, or that there would be nothing wrong with it, and Maya would give Tony orders to use it less that he would actually listen to. The former. The former would have meant that Tony wasn't subconsciously doing this to himself, and that there was an easy solution. That he wasn't using the Extremis just as heavily as always and lying to Steve about trying to cut back.
"That happens when you pay for an entire hospital wing." Wanda's voice was absent; she was still staring at her glove. "I must have torn this when we fought the Wrecking Crew yesterday. I hate it when I do that. Do you know how hard it is to get elbow-length silk gloves in red?"
Hank nodded, and forced himself to his feet, looking back over his shoulder at the door to Jan's room. Then he left, walking down the hall to the elevator.
– she'd spent as a prisoner in her own mind making her stomach twist. If she tapped into Chthon's powers to augment her own, he would have her again, seals or no seals. Strange's spells were powerful, but the seals that protected her could be broken if she put them under enough pressure.
"How long do you want me to stay?" Tony's hair was still wet, as Steve watched, a drop of water fell from it onto his shoulder, and ran slowly down the lean muscles of his arm.
Sam moved in just as the metal caught the Doombot between the shoulder blades, and hooked its feet out from under it with a kick as it started to turn toward her, off balance.  It went reeling back directly into Wong and his dagger, as smoothly as if the three of them had planned it.
Erwin and Clytemnesta Morley... both of them dead in explosions, casualties of Tony's stupid, destructive rivalry with Obadiah Stane. Rhodey felt the guilt over their deaths as much as he did, he knew - he had been the one wearing the armor when Erwin had died, when Tony and Rhodey had both failed to save him.
"I know." Steve hesitated for a long moment, then, "Would you have told me? If Wanda hadn't made you?"
Clint blinked, and turned to look at her. "You've talked to him on the phone, haven't you? Why are you asking me?"
Steve didn't need to read the caption to know when and where the picture had been taken. In the upper left corner, over their heads, he could see rows of identical white headstones, marching away into the distance.
Tony  had stayed home from work the first two days after their return from the  Savage Land, and his first day back, he'd humored Steve's insistence  that he actually eat before leaving.  Then he'd started sneaking out  while Steve was out running, claiming that consuming anything other than  coffee before nine o' clock was barbaric and heathen.
She hadn't really thought about what that meant. She hadn't wanted to. Wanda had killed Vision — she'd watched Simon cry for him, for
Bone was good, Steve reminded himself.  It meant the spear might have glanced off a rib rather than shredding internal organs.  If the spear hadn’t just sliced through his ribs like a meat cleaver.  It had scratched his shield, punched through the armor like it was paper.
Tony leaned his head against Steve's shoulder, sagging downward slightly against the boxes in order to do so, and closed his eyes, the smile still lingering on his lips. "Someday, I'm going to run out of those."
stop me? You, a half-trained child?" Harkness shook her head, the mildly disapproving gesture ludicrously incongruous coming from a blazing-eyed avatar of chaos. "Such ingratitude. And after all the lengths I went to to get Loki to prepare me a second vessel of chaos magic in order to spare your life."
Or he hadn't been able to bring himself to change it and shut Steve out of his life that last little bit; the way Steve hadn't been able to keep himself from answering when Tony had called his cell phone.
"Damn," she said. "Could one of you guys punch that hole in the door a little bigger? We're going to need to get a lot of stretchers up here."
"You didn't know that pregnancy would be dangerous for Tony, or even that it was possible." Wanda fell into step with them, on Steve's left. "Strange and I didn't think it was possible, before we knew the full extent of Loki's spell. And you certainly didn't cause him to miscarry."
"As a foot rest," Steve returned. Thankfully, his hair was too short for chewing on — human hair seemed to inexplicably delight the cat, and he almost hadn't survived his first encounter with Carol, which had involved launching himself at her head from behind while she'd been sitting on the couch.
"They're going to take anything I do as a sign of weakness," Tony said. "I can't win here, unless Strange can magically change me back before Saturday."
They'd argued again this time, despite the lower stakes, over Wanda's return and Simon's refusal to come back to New York and see her. Hellrung was all for facing down your problems with a positive attitude, or at least with long-suffering endurance. Jessica, for once, had been in total agreement with him – she'd kept enough secrets in the rest of her life to prefer brutal honesty in relationships, she'd said.
At least it had started out on a high note, he thought, and followed Steve out of the room, letting his eyes linger on the broad planes of Steve's back.
the training program announced, in a pleasant female voice that was disquietingly reminiscent of Jocasta. "
"Of course we'll help," Steve said firmly, as if the Avengers had already discussed the situation and come to a unanimous conclusion.
And he'd died still keeping that part of himself a secret, a small regret when stacked up against so many larger ones, but a regret nonetheless.
Odin’s old solution, the chains and snakes and venom, involved a degree of calculated cruelty that Thor would never be comfortable with.  And considering that his other half had thought literally sewing Loki’s mouth closed was a funny joke, that said something.
There was a bright flash of light at the corner of her vision, and a deep groaning sound vibrated through the soles of her feet.  Something was—
Trusting Jan and Clint to deal with the A.I.M. hirelings he could just catch sight of sneaking up behind him, he turned and threw his shield at the billboard. It hit the giant LCD screen with a shower of sparks, and the red and white animated swirls that had been about to form themselves into the Target logo disappeared as the screen flickered, then went dark.
"I didn't mean it that way," Clint lied. "You're not a doctor. You haven't taken the Hippocratic oath."
He gave Steve a second once-over, his eyes filling with heat. "You should let Jan pick out your clothing more often."
Tony pushed past Steve into the kitchen and dropped heavily into the chair Steve had been sitting in, resting his elbows on the table and burying his face in his hands. "So I did kill him, in a way," he said softly, the words muffled by his fingers. "I was just so angry, and so scared. I knew what would happen if I didn't fix things. And it would all have been my fault, and I wouldn't have been able to live with it." He shook his head back and forth minutely, digging his fingers into his hair. "I swear it made sense then. I was trying to keep anyone from getting hurt. Even when I was attacking people, all I wanted was to-"
"Jan-" Clint started, just as ambulance personnel began climbing through the broken door behind him.
"Doom sees everything as a declaration of war," Tony said snidely, "from having his medieval zombie army incinerated to Reed Richard having once beaten him at scrabble in college."
"Give me that," Steve said after a moment, able to stand it no longer, and took the dishtowel from Tony's fingers. He put a hand under Tony's chin to tilt his face up, and Tony closed his eyes as Steve brushed the wet cloth gently over his eyelids.
Thor cleared his throat, then said, deliberately, "I cannot fight beside someone whom I cannot trust at my back. Captain America has my trust and respect, as do the Wasp and Hawkeye. For their sake, I remain an Avenger, and have chosen not to pursue your treachery." The words 'drop this, or I will decide to pursue it after all,' were unspoken. Hank could hear them anyway; everyone in the room could probably hear them.
"My father was alive," Tony interrupted. "I know." Shooter had been on the board for nearly two decades, and had disliked Tony ever since his father had first brought him in to a board meeting, intent on shaming his board members by proving that a six year old had a better grasp of the basic principles of engineering than they did. Howard Stark had never expressed anything like pride in his son, not verbally, anyway, but the fact that he'd been convinced that his six year old son really was more intelligent than an entire boardroom full of adults had to count for something. "We've been producing better designs, better technology, since then, though," Tony said, doing his level best to sound positive, confident. "Everyone acknowledges that. Innovation is what this company is known for. You can't innovate and be 'safe.' Safety in this field is a death sentence."
"That's... good," Tony said, and there was a moment of heavy silence. Well, it meant that he was alive at least. "Pietro's a competent adult, and he's not going to do anything stupid or dangerous while Luna's with him; I'm sure they're both fine." It sounded like the lie it was. "At least she was willing to talk to you," he rushed on. "Blackbolt won't talk to any of us right now. Figuratively speaking, I mean. The Inhumans weren't pleased with Registration and the Initiative, or with HUSAC." Blackbolt never literally spoke to anyone, since the power of his voice could level cities, but he could convey a great deal with a look, and the look he'd given Tony the last time they'd met had been distinctly unfriendly.
"It won't really feel like home until we're back in the Avengers Mansion," he said. Not that Tony's penthouse wasn't nice, but it wasn't home.
"Bucky did not say that." Steve moved with Tony, keeping the other man within his line-of-sight. He didn't doubt that Bucky was capable of sneaking into the top floor floor of the heavily secured Stark Tower and leaving Tony a threatening note, but the bit about the sweaters had to be Tony editorializing. "And you're one to talk." Tony's most hideous sweater, a shapeless, colorless mass of grey wool, had been destroyed along with one of SHIELD's flying cars in the final battle against Red Skull, but he still possessed an equally shapeless deep orange sweater.
been thinking of Tony as an enemy, after that first fight. He hadn't wanted to, but he hadn't had a choice, and he'd been miserable with it the whole time.
Jan was shouting, hammering on the energy bubble with both hands, heedless of the pain it had to be causing her.
"Steve," Tony interrupted, "clothes."  Naked, bent in an athletic crouch with his shield in one hand, Steve was a sight to strike awe into the heart of an intruder, but he was also completely vulnerable to enemy weapons fire.  His leather and scale mail wouldn't stop bullets, or even slow them appreciably, but it would at least blunt the impact of one of Sin's poisoned daggers.
"You should really go upstairs and tell Cap you're here. Things are..." his memory offered him a vivid image of Jan huddled in bed, tears streaking her face "not good. And ow, do you really have to do that so hard?"
Loki's eyes narrowed to green slits. "You speak of honor to me?" she spat. "Your father slew mine. He and the rest of you treated me like tainted goods, good enough to serve and aid you, but never truly one of your own. Your precious All-Father wouldn't even let me keep my own children, and you call me traitor for opposing him?"
No doubt he could feel the same aura of evil in the air that Strange could sense; bound to the church as he was, by blood and oaths, he would sense any danger that threatened within these walls.
"I think not."  Doom shifted the manuscript to his left hand and raised his right hand threateningly.  "The way out is obvious.  I will simply go through you."
There was a long pause. "No," Carol said, slowly. "I don't think so. But it wouldn't be normal energy. For all I know, the whole block could be lit up like a Christmas tree with magical radiation."
Tony hated magic. He'd always hated it, but now, he had discovered new and previously unplumbed depths of loathing for it.
"So you're going to chain him up and leave him here, too?  Are you starting a collection?"  Hank's voice was at its most caustic and belittling, and he could do belittling better than almost anyone Jan knew.  It was all in the tone.
"I could say the same thing about your current form." The words were out before Don could think better of them, and he tightened his grip on his cane, ready to slam it into the ground and let Thor take over if Loki responded to his jab with violence.
Tony ignored him. "I couldn't exactly go to a hospital. If this hit the media, whatever shreds of credibility and respect I still have in the business world would be gone. I already have breasts. I don't need people to start writing me off as a slut again. Sleeping around is different when you're a woman; I don't think SI's stock could handle it."
Steve took another slow step forward. "Tony," he said, still gently, "I need you to take off your armor." Before you hurt someone. Before they found out that whatever this was
"That's the marines," Rhodey interrupted. "They are a cult. Anyway, you're one to talk, mister I-sleep-in-my-armor."
"You know, we really could have used you. There were people jumping out windows left and right." It was only a slight exaggeration. If there had been a time for Thor to make a big, dramatic return, flying right into the middle of the whole mess and catching some crazy sonuvabitch who'd just flung himself out the window would have been it. Instead, here was Don Blake, lurking in St. Vincent's emergency clinic. Clint frowned. "Why are you here?"
"Don't be an idiot," Doom snapped.  "As if I'd tie myself to an insane fanatic who thinks her dead father speaks to her.  I am about to become a god; the woman ruling at my right hand could be nothing less."
"It's safer this way," Hank was telling Wanda. "You get to keep your control over your own mind, and keep Chthon out of it."
"No," Steve said, staring down at his hands. He was still wearing his gloves, and in the bright fluorescent hospital lights, he could see shiny spots across the knuckles and palm where the leather was starting to wear. "Hank's working on it. Spiderman's here; he's helping him."
Did it matter?  "During the middle of Tony's stupid registration disaster," and then, feeling suddenly defensive with both Hank and Jan watching him and remembering the stinging slap Jane had given him when she'd first seen him, he added, "It took me a while to get my head together; I came back before Thor did, and it was... confusing... for a while."  He'd been just plain Don Blake for over half his life, until the first time he'd touched Mjolnir's handle, but that had been thanks to Odin's magic suppressing Thor's memories and personality.  Having that part of himself missing entirely had been... strange.
“I didn’t know you were interested in cooking, Clint.”  The tone of her voice wasn’t actually mocking, but Clint had known her long enough to be able to tell that she was mocking him anyway.
"Sure," Don said, and then there was a long moment of silence while the three of them just stood there.
Ouch. Jan winced, and laid a hand on Thor's arm, hoping the gesture conveyed her sympathy. Loki had been carrying out a vendetta against Thor for years, longer than any of the rest of them had been alive, but this was the most personal attack she had heard of yet.
"I'll ask it, then. I'm pretty sure I'm stuck like this for the foreseeable future. I may still be legally male, but SI has lawyers who could probably take my DNA test results and use them to make the state attorney's office cry. Will you marry me?"
It was so blindingly obvious in retrospect — who else would hire Sin to steal a book full of rituals on summoning chaos demons bare weeks after Chthon had been trapped just a thin dimensional wall away from the same chaos artifact Doom had tried to burn down half of Manhattan to acquire?
"You are no longer pregnant." Don made a vague gesture towards Tony's shoulder with one hand, as if he'd been about to touch him and then thought better of it. "Normally, I would recommend counseling under these circumstances, but-"
"Stark said that." Sharon's voice was low, the tension in it audible. "It wasn't helpful then, either."
Tony smirked at him, the expression almost convincing. "Trust me, you really don't. Though I think I speak for all of us when I say that both you and your alter-ego would make extremely good-looking women."
"What else was I supposed to do?" Tony looked away, inspecting the IV line in his elbow. He tugged at it absently, adding, "I couldn't just let them attack each other. More people would have gotten hurt." Standing by and watching when he could have intervened would have made anything that happened to those people his fault.
Wanda shook her head.  "Not there.  That's right in the middle of Hell's Kitchen.  He wouldn't risk trying to work magic that close to St. Margaret's."
She remembered Beast coming to see her, telling her that something had happened to the world's mutants, something bad, and asking – begging – for her help in order to fix it. She had sent him away. It had made her send him away.
Hank hadn't met her eyes since she'd come back to her senses and found him lurking in the hallway; he'd barely even looked her in the face. And that made Jan feel even worse than the shakiness in her muscles and the lingering feeling of illness that Hank had guiltily confessed was probably due as much to the antidote as to the toxin.
MJ  finished her set and left the stage, coming to sit next to Peter.  "So  how did I do?" she asked, as the band started to play dance music.
"I've cleaned all the glass out of you," Tony said, addressing the metal boot in his hands. "Why are you still not working? What else is wrong with you?"
"I'm not. I just heard the name somewhere and was curious." Clint offered, knowing it sounded exactly like the lie it was.
, it was only because he hadn't seen the way Steve was sulking now. If he'd been away another few days, things would probably have devolved to the point where Steve started picking fights with Clint to blow off steam, and Clint didn't need the encouragement.
That was so very much not what they needed. "Blast them," Jan shouted back. "We need to get these people out of here, away from whatever this is."
A long moment of silence followed her knock, and the door failed to open. She raised her hand and hammered on the wood with her fist, and was considering kicking it when she finally heard the scrape of a bolt being drawn back, and a low murmuring that sounded like someone disarming a magical ward.
"This way," he told Sharon. "Bring him into the kitchen." The lights there wouldn't be visible from the front of the house, and if anyone
Ten minutes later, he'd hit the mat three more times, and when he wobbled getting back up the third time, Steve declared practice over with.
"Oh," Tony said, without much curiosity. He'd been asking more for form's sake than anything else. At the moment, it was hard to care about anything but the fact that Steve was here. He wasn't sure he had the energy for more. Except...
'One of our conservationists swears that it whispered to him,' the curator had said. She'd sounded skeptical, but she'd held the box uncomfortably.
though half of France, and through Italy before that; it was probably a miracle that it was still readable, after all this time.
She lashed out at him with the borrowed magic, feeling a surge of triumph at the pained howl that echoed in her skull, and wrenched her own powers free of the spell that bound them. Reality rippled around her, something that had been warped out of true snapping back into place. The cathedral's massive pipe organ rang like a struck gong, a great chord of sound that echoed discordantly off the stone walls and high, vaulted ceiling.
Tony was supposed to have gotten back to New York at nine a.m. Thanks to a combination of last-minute delays, it was now eleven forty-five, and he still hadn't arrived.
He'd spent a lot of time recently staring at Steve, drinking in the sight of him. After knowing for so long that he was never going to see Steve again, it was a little bit like coming into the light, every time Tony saw him. Steve alive and breathing wasn't something he was ever going to get tired of looking at.
"And in the meantime," Tony said, smiling for all he was worth and resisting the urge to gaze at Layton through his eyelashes just in case that might help, "we get the tax breaks just for researching it."
Tony winced. Self-loathing was a familiar feeling by now, almost soothing. Bringing up Faustus had been thoughtlessly cruel; he couldn't have come up with a response better calculated to hurt her if he'd tried, and the fact that he hadn't even meant to almost made it worse.
Sharon and Steve were supporting Barnes between them now, Steve taking most of the injured man's weight. In the bright light of the kitchen, his face was pale and sweaty, overly-long brown hair sticking to his forehead. He all but fell into Steve's recently-vacated chair, wincing away when Sharon tried to pull his hand away from his ribs to get a closer look at whatever injury lay under his black clothing.
The others had found them, then.  Hank must be back at the tower, glued to a monitor and storing up complaints about the fact that he'd been left behind.  Unless Doom had brought them along as sacrifices, in which case... maybe Hank had gone for help?
since before the war; he'd forgotten how much he disliked it. He'd seen the movie with Humphrey Bogart numerous times over the years, and the memory of Bogart's performance had overshadowed the book until he'd forgotten just how much of a heartless bastard Sam Spade was.
He had an ivory-topped cane in one hand. An affectation, or had someone worked him over for money owed them again?
"You know, Peter really would be good at that," Steve said, after a long moment. "But you'll never get him to leave New York City, anymore than you'd get Daredevil to." Not that they would want to; both the remnants of the Initiative and New York law enforcement were pretending very hard that Daredevil didn't exist these days. The unqualified disaster that their attempt to prove Matt Murdock was Daredevil had turned into wasn't something anyone was likely to forget anytime soon.
He wasn't even looking at Wanda, as if the mere sight of her was painful. Maybe it was, after what had happened between them on Mount Wundagore.
If the first book had been based on Carol's time with the Starjammers... "Let me guess," Clint stepped in front of Carol and swung the door open with his free hand, "the evil warlord has an even more evil son who's gonna get his."
"I can only speak for myself, of course," Jan said, "but I'm thrilled that we've been able to resolve things in a way that's satisfactory to everyone."
Steve wanted to tell her that he was proud of her, but that would have been patronizing. He was, though. He had known people who had never recovered from a fraction of what Wanda had been through. It was one of the things he loved about his team; no matter what happened to them, they always got back up and kept going.
"I'm so sorry," Steve repeated. And the worst part was that he couldn't even bring himself to regret what they had done, not really - he'd been happier over the past few weeks than he had been in a long time, and most of that had been because of Tony. "I never thought-"
MJ's lips twitched. Then, "Wait a minute," her eyebrows went up. "You're not thinking that Tony got poisoned because you were mad him, are you? The world doesn't revolve around you, Peter."
Killing the guards at the front gate might have been worth the extra time after all, if only she could be sure that they had the right clearances. The ten minutes that had elapsed since she and her men had slipped past them weren't long enough for a severed hand to cool to the point that it could no longer trigger a biometric lock.
Tony checked his watch again. It was exactly one minute and thirty-five seconds later than the last time he'd done so. "You'd think the sorcerer supreme could be on time."
When Loki came, he would offer Asgard's aid in recovering Baldur's Bane in exchange for the return of the Wasp and Hank Pym.  Their rescue would have to come first, he would tell her, as restitution for aiding Doom.
Sam was doing okay, too, which was a minor miracle.  Steve had been so certain, when he’d seen Redwing grab the spear and heard Sam scream, seen him collapse to his knees, that the spear was going to kill him, drive him insane, burn and electrocute Redwing the way it had Strange.  He wasn’t sure what losing Redwing would have done to Sam, didn’t want to think about it too deeply.
"You shouldn't have used the energy weapon on me," Carol told him, smiling even more widely at him.  "Big mistake."
Predictably, none of the invaders did as she said.  The woman took a step forward, her hand going to the back-up weapon she wore in a shoulder holster, and Clint fired a burst of energy at the floor just in front of her feet.  It lit up the hallway like a lightning flash, rendering everything in bright blue-white and sharp-edged shadows.
"Can we go back to the double entendres?" he asked, managing to work some humor into his voice. "There's one about Cap's mighty shield that I prepared specifically for the occasion."
"We're all good," Sam assured him. "Iron Man's got half the vials for you, and Thor's bringing the rest."
The Night Nurse was explaining Strange's injuries to the Avengers, her gestures short and jerky, as if being forced to repeat the information over again offended her. Daredevil had retreated back to the far wall, seeming uncomfortable in the now tightly crowded room. He'd never struck her as a people person.
Steve couldn't help smiling at that. Of course there was an engineering-related reason Tony liked them. "Art can be a powerful political tool," he pointed out, steering Tony around a group of tourists who were standing in an amorphous huddle in the middle of the hallway. By the slant of the light coming in through the windows, it was already past noon, and early afternoon on a Saturday seemed to be most people's favorite time to visit museums; the building wasn't exactly crowded, but there was a steady stream of people milling around. Steve had been in here before, on weekdays, and seen nobody but a few security guards, and a scattering of art students from Cooper Union.
Pepper was back in New York, holding down the fort in his absence. So was Happy. Rhodey? Rhodey had flown him out here; he could fly Tony to some place where he could get medical attention. Except that he would be no better prepared to deal with whatever this was than Tony was, and it was entirely possible that he might bleed to death internally in transit, leaving Rhodey with Tony's dead body on his hands, which would be an entirely unfair thing to do to someone.
Cap was sitting in a chair next to the hospital bed, head bowed, one hand wrapped around the bed's metal railing. Tony was a motionless ball in the bed, which, yeah. That wasn't good.
"I still can't believe you don't know how to cook." Steve was resting his chin on his hand, looking at Tony with an irritating mix of affection and amusement.
"I hate to admit it," Sam said, turning away from Wanda and joining the conversation, "but that is actually a good point."
There was no one in there, either, but a fire had been laid in the fireplace, and either Steve or Tony had left a book lying on the coffee table, face down to keep their place in it.
"Clint," she said after a moment. "Can you slow down, I can't-" a pause, presumably caused by him interrupting her. "I can't understand you." As Steve watched, Jan's eyebrows drew together in a frown. Then she sat bolt upright in her chair, her eyes going wide. "Wait, Tony and Hank
And there were still tests left for him to perform on Tony's blood samples. It was why he'd stayed behind in the lab after the others had left. This was his job, now, and he intended to do it right. He might not have been able to turn Tony back - it had taken Loki's magic to do that - but he could at least make sure that he and Don hadn't missed anything. Make sure that there truly were no side effects from all that time Tony had spent as a woman. Or from his brief and ill-fated pregnancy.
There was a tentative knock on the door. Steve glanced up, and found Carol and Rhodey hovering in the doorway. Carol was still in her Ms. Marvel costume, but Rhodey had lost the War Machine armor. The hospital personnel probably frowned on visitors who wore shoulder canons.
Both of them came to a halt when they saw the magazine in Steve's hand. Sam nodded at it, looking sober. "You've seen it, then?"
They ought to have had Beast come and examine her – he was the mutant expert, and the geneticist – but while Clint was sure he would have come, if one of the Avengers had been willing to ask him, Wanda, when it was suggested to her, had point blank refused and nearly begged them not to contact any of the X-Men. Not yet.
Maybe Jessica had been right to want to call a halt to things before it stopped being fun. They had worked just fine as friends who occasionally hooked up before the SHRA had passed. And friends who were willing to forgive you some of the things Carol had pulled when she'd been drinking, and put up with the dysfunctional mess she'd been after she'd come out of the coma were harder to come by than gorgeous women with sex pheromone powers who were great in bed.
Jan made a sort of sighing noise, and sagged against him. Clint grabbed for her, catching her around the shoulders before she could hit the floor. "They breathed that stuff in, didn't they?" He looked at Steve as he spoke, his tone imploring Steve to tell him that it was under control, was going to be all right.
No loss; the man had been a coward anyway. Sacrifices had to be made in the name of the future Reich.
Hank turned back to his blood samples, and started muttering to himself. Peter guessed that meant he was dismissed.
For several endless moments, nothing had happened, and then something elsewhere in the mansion had exploded with a hollow boom.
Wanda's lips curved into a smile again. "I think Simon and I managed to stretch that out over at least four months." Then she winced, and Tony mentally kicked himself for bringing up Simon at all.
The clack of the computer keys sounded incongruously loud against the backdrop of hums and beeps from the room's collection of medical equipment, and the soft rush of the carrier's ventilation system, like the gunfire-rattle of typewriter keys in an old movie.
Steve was going to have to do something about that, eventually, before the team's performance in the field suffered for it. He wasn't looking forward to it.
Wanda thanked him for his hospitality, and told Cap that she'd be at the mansion's front gate by morning. The Sanctum Sanctorum was just one more place to hide. The things she'd done to her team and her home weren't going to go away if she avoided them.
Oh.  Steve absorbed that for a moment.  For hours, he’d been sure that Tony had taken that blow on purpose, because it was the sort of thing that Tony would do.  Had done, in the past, more than once.   “She died as soon as Wanda drove Chthon out of her,” he said, and then, before Tony could start wallowing in misplaced guilt, “Wanda says she wouldn’t have survived his possession regardless.  She was a dead woman from the moment he took over her body.”
She had thought she was gaining more control over her powers, working with Strange, but if there was any chance she had caused this...
Steve reached down and took Tony by the wrist, pulling him to his feet. Tony stiffened, hissing through his teeth as the bruises Steve knew were there under his shirt must have made themselves known.
There was a long moment of silence. Jan smiled tentatively, Clint looked at the floor, and Carol glowered at Wanda and everyone else, pointedly silent. Tony stood there feeling awkward, watching Steve and Wanda try to smile at one another, and struggled to think of something to say.
He'd been too angry to notice it at the time, the hurt from Tony's betrayal still too raw, but Tony had been seriously holding back during that first big fight over Registration. Steve should not have been able to get into a fistfight with an armored-up Iron Man and walk away with nothing but some bruises and a couple of cracked bones.
There was silence as everyone considered this, and Clint's too-loud words into the cordless phone he was holding between his shoulder and right ear were clearly audible for a moment. "Get back to New York, okay? This is more important than your booty call with Spider-Woman. I thought you guys were 'taking a break from each other' anyway."
She couldn't even talk to anyone about it; either they wouldn't know enough about what had happened, or they would be appalled at her for missing the way things had been. She ought to have had no feelings left for him but contempt, or maybe pity, but the more time passed, the more she found herself remembering the parts of their relationship that had been good. The parts that had made them both happy.
He was not impressed. "I doubt that," he said. "You've never been able to defeat Thor, and the only god you ever slew, you killed by trickery. You need my help as much as I need yours, or you would not be here." Now that she was here, however, her presence opened up intriguing new avenues of possibility.
Sharon's eyes narrowed, her face suddenly set and cold in a way that made Tony very aware that she was a trained counter-intelligence officer who had tracked down and killed at least three of the double agents responsible for Faustus's infiltration of SHIELD. "No," she said, "he doesn't. And because you're a decent human being who doesn't want me to cut your throat in your sleep, he'll never know. Those things are not remotely comparable." She didn't raise her voice, didn't even sound upset, not compared to the way she had when discussing Steve's autopsy, but she didn't have to.
"This shouldn't be bleeding so much," Steve muttered, almost to himself. He held a hand out, and Tony and Sharon both moved to place another wad of gauze in it, their shoulders nearly colliding. The soaked gauze went into the sink, little threads of blood seeping out from the soggy material into the surrounding water.
"Why?" Steve asked. "Because they have that annoying habit of asking questions like 'Whose orders was Iron Man following when he broke all those federal laws and killed Titanium Man?'" All right, maybe that sounded a little harsher than he'd meant it to.
Steve flinched, his eyes returning to Tony's haunted face. Even though Tony hadn't hurt anyone, Steve was pretty sure he thought he had, and that was what mattered right now. "Tony doesn't handle guilt well," Steve admitted. He didn't handle things that weren't under his control well, either, which was probably connected. If Tony felt guilt over something, punished himself for it, made it his fault, then it meant that whatever it was had been caused by his own actions or failures, and was therefore still under his control.
The vault door was heavy enough that it took both Steve and Sam together to haul it shut. If Thor were there, he could have done it singlehandedly, but diplomacy was not his strong suit, and he'd had business in Valhalla.
"I think being stabbed probably had something to do with it," Daredevil said, nodding toward Strange.
If he only knew why Tony had gone so far over the edge, he might feel better about it, might be able to understand, but he wasn't sure that even Tony knew.
Some time later, he wasn't sure how long, Steve said, quietly, "I don't know what I would have done if your armor hadn't come off."
Steve's fingers closed around his wrist, tugging his hand away from his face, and only then did Tony realize that he had been rubbing the bridge of his nose.
Wanda pulled her hand, half extended to touch the cat, back again. "I always wanted a kitten when I was little," she said, a touch of defensiveness in her voice, "but we weren't allowed to have them because they're dirty."
The front door of the bunker was secured by a single rusted padlock. Behind it, there would be a flight of stairs leading downward and another door, this one equipped with a fingerprint-coded lock and retinal scanners.
"You must be thrilled." Byrne smiled again, adding, "Having a resurrected hero to act as your spokesman to Congress, having Captain America back at the head of the Avengers, all charges dropped and everything forgiven. And he never even had to set foot in a courtroom. It couldn't have worked out better for you all if you'd planned it in advance."
She was wearing the red leather pants and bustier and ankle-length red cape that she'd worn before everything had fallen apart. The old, pointy headdress was gone, but aside from that detail, it was like stepping back in time a year and a half; for a brief, weightless moment, Tony half-expected Vision to glide through the wall behind her, or for Scott Lang to stroll in, helmet in hand, trading half-serious barbs with Jack of Hearts and followed by a trail of ants.
“Sam.”  Sharon bent down, peering at Sam’s face and frowning at Redwing, still a terrified mass of feathers against Sam’s chest.  “Steve said you and Redwing were hurt.”
"I can make coffee," Tony defended. He lifted his coffee mug and took a pointed sip, trying to pretend immunity to the way Steve's hair and eyelashes gleamed gold in the candlelight.
Wanda could feel it as well, a faint but distinct aura of chaos magic that emanated from the church. Whatever it was, Chthon planned to use it to break free from his prison, probably killing her in the process. Once he was free, there would be no way to stop him. Chthon was an elder god, one of the primal forces of the universe; no one on earth had the power to defeat him in open battle.
He did not need it, yet still, he possessed it, and none of the various explanations for Tony's condition that it suggested to him were pleasant.
"I can't say for sure, but my guess is that the main worry for small children would be less the psychological effects and more the toxicity; they've got so much less mass, and..." Hank trailed off, suddenly wearing a look Peter knew he'd had on his own face more than a few times. It was the look of a man who'd just been struck by the blindingly obvious.
Jan dove lower, mentally preparing herself for the dizzy head rush that always ensued when she tried to grow immediately after returning to normal size from her Wasp form. If necessary, she and Carol could rip the doors off the car, get the driver out before—
"Yes, it is," Tony interrupted Hill. "Doom's Romany. He hates Nazis. It's the one way in which he resembles a normal human being. According to Strange, he thinks the spear can make him a god, and Strange wasn't willing to say he was wrong."
"Let go of me," Jan snapped, trying to jerk her arm away. It was no use -- he was bigger and stronger than she was, and with an unknown toxin filling the air, she didn't dare shrink down and hide. She would only poison herself quicker that way.
"I wanted to-" he started, and then stopped, his brain abruptly running out of words. He hadn't been this inarticulate since the last time he'd tried to make up with Bobbi, before... he hadn't been this inarticulate for a long time. Maybe he shouldn't ask to speak to Wanda alone. Maybe she didn't
"What would I do without my regular collection of bruises from being thrown into the mat?" Still grinning, Tony came at Steve, who sidestepped him easily. He blocked all but one of the flurry of blows Steve aimed at him, even managing to land one of his own in return.
The quinjet arrived at ten in the morning, which mean that it had to have left LA at five a.m. Which meant that Tony and Wanda had probably gotten up at four.
Not warm enough, though, that he didn't notice that Tony was leading them in the direction of his lab instead of his bedroom, the library, or some other place suited to resting.
"So said to yourself, 'I know; I'll ask Hank,'" Hank said, in that bitchy voice he used when he was being snide to people, usually Clint. "'He doesn't have any professional ethics.'"
"I gathered that," Steve said, and took the phone from her. He brought it to his ear and found Peter midway through a stream of fast-paced speech. "-fire me again if I don't get the Bugle an exclusive, or maybe just fire me on principle for knowing all about it and not telling him. I can tell him no, though. It's not like Jameson hasn't fired me six times already, and he's mad enough right now that he'll probably do it anyway no matter what I do. And I can find out who took the picture, if you want; there aren't many guys good enough to get that kind of a shot in that kind of light. It was an old-school camera, right? That doesn't narrow it down much, but-"
The woman on the left dropped her Museum of Natural History giftshop bag onto the pavement, a pair of stuffed dinosaurs spilling out of it, and turned on Steve, hissing. The last few square inches of dark brown skin visible on her face disappeared beneath a wave of oily black, and eight inches of tongue lolled out of her mouth, twisting in midair like a snake's.
"We don't know what this substance he and the others have been exposed to is," Dr. Brackett said gently. "We have no idea what it's currently doing to them, or how it's going to continue affecting them. Our lab is running tests right now, but it's going to be a little while before we have any real answers."
He redoubled the force of his blows, angling the hammer slightly with each one and squinting against the bright flare of sparks each strike produced. The first of the dents was almost gone now. He would have to heat the metal again, he decided, before moving on to the second, larger dent.
Steve kept himself tense, carefully braced over Tony’s body and trying hard not to lean any weight on him as he buried his face in Tony’s neck.  Tony’s skin smelled like antiseptic and some undefinable scent Steve associated with hospitals, but it was warm and alive, not clammy with shock, and he could feel Tony’s breath against his ear.
When he got back to the living room, Hank and Jan were gone -- presumably to bed -- and Clint was stretched out on the couch, completely limp and already snoring. Tony was still sitting where Steve had left him, looking more dazed than he had just a few minutes ago.
Steve gave Sam's shoulder a shove when he drew level with him — not hard, just in case he'd collected more bruises than the one on his face — but didn't dispute the statement.  If SHIELD had truly made any kind of breakthrough, Hill or Sharon would have called.  Tony was going to be fine; he'd been shocky and had some kind of electrolyte imbalance and the doctors had made worrying comments about 'being cautious' over his arrhythmia 'just in case,' but the Helicarrier's medical staff had sworn to Steve that rest, IV fluids, and a couple of weeks to heal would take care of everything.
Hank collapsed on top of the guard, limbs twitching in sharp, hyper-reflexive jerks.  He took medication now, Don remembered with horror.  Anti-depressants.  Mood stabilizers.  Maybe both.  How could he not know what kind?  His own teammate was overdosing right in front of him, and he didn't know on what.
The metal exam table and just-slightly-too-cold air conditioning had not improved since his last visit, and the vise-like pain in his head was all-too-familiar as well.  His hopes that SHIELD's doctors would give him a quick once-over and then release him had probably been doomed from the start — he'd known that when he'd woken up in a quinjet with Steve's hand gripping his and no clear memory of how he'd gotten there — but they'd died an even swifter death than he'd expected once they landed on the Helicarrier's deck.
"Unlike some, I am not so enamored of my own reflection that I must gaze at it constantly." It was an unfair charge — Loki was indeed vain, but his vanity had always been for his cleverness rather than his face or form — but saying the words might provoke his quick-to-anger stepbrother into revealing himself.
And no one had heard from Clint or Wanda since the attack began.  Or Carol.  With Chthon and chaos magic involved, Wanda would be more useful to Doom than any of the rest of them.  For all they knew, he could have order his Doombots or Sin's men to take her and kill the others.
"I'm sorry I asked you to marry me," he added. "I shouldn't have assumed. It's the old fashioned guy in me."
"So how's that new car of yours working out?" Tony asked, as the two of them stepped smoothly into a turn. He was getting the hang of this not-leading thing. Another couple songs, and it might not even take effort. "I had doubts about some of the design elements, but I figured you would want the higher horsepower."
Not for want of Tony trying, though.  He’d done nothing whatsoever to stop Sin from stabbing him; Steve could still see the spear sliding easily through his armor, see Tony deliberately leaving himself open, taking the blow in order to get the chance to bring his repulsors up and blast her.
"I've been analyzing the electromagnetic emissions given off by the teleportation device Sin used to escape from the Metropolitan Museum," Tony began.
The floorboards beneath him were just beginning to become uncomfortably hard when Steve's Avengers communicator, lying out of the way atop a pile of boxes, came to life with a soft ping. Beside him, Tony went stiff, his shoulders jerking.
Steve had been right about over-using the Extremis; the headaches had been getting worse, and after the first nosebleed in months had hit him when he tried to do an everyday round of checking and answering email while running all the surveillance and data collection processes in the background, he had reluctantly taken Steve's advice and dropped the SHIELD connection, replacing it with a worm that he'd sent crawling through Fury's computers, programmed to send him notifications if anything of interest came up. He'd had to rewrite the code twice over the past week to keep SHIELD's IT specialists from tracking down and deleting his spy programs, more often than he'd expected to, but less often than he would have been satisfied with were he still head of SHIELD. Fury ought to be thanking him for the training exercise he was providing; SHIELD's personnel clearly needed it.
The nurse smiled at them, his broad, freckled face pleasant.  It was a real smile, not a polite or practiced one, and the knot in Steve’s stomach hurt just a little less.
Wanda didn’t flinch, though, or look anything other than sad and a little haunted.  “I had to banish Chthon.  It took all the power the spear had; if I’d used it up bringing Vision back, he would have won.”
Steve winced. "I'm sorry?" He'd only met Morgan Stark once or twice, and had a vague memory of a stocky man a few years older than Tony, who reminded him of Tony's playboy facade at its most annoying, with none of Tony's intelligence or charm.
And the newspaper articles about himself and Tony were still coming out. When Jarvis had started screening or blocking all calls from the media, they'd started calling the West Coast and badgering Henry Hellrung instead, trying to get him to tell them the juicy details of his possibly hypothetical fling with Tony. Steve had carefully not asked Tony if there was any truth to the rumors, because he would undoubtedly have to work with Hellrung in the future, and having too much knowledge of anything that had happened between them would make that awkward. The tabloids seemed hell-bent on ruining Steve's deliberate ignorance, though.
He'd never be able to speak to Jan or Carol again, or Sam, probably. Sam would be disgusted and disappointed when he heard, and would immediately tell Cap, who would promptly kick Clint off the team. And rightly so, and he probably ought to have left already, except... but he couldn't tell Cap when he hadn't spoken to Wanda, because she might not want Cap or anyone else to know what Clint had done to her. Bad enough, probably, that he'd told Carol and Tony.
"For the love of-" Iron Man interrupted, just as Hank reached the front hall, the print out of his test results still absently clutched in one hand. "Will you stop apologizing, Thor? It's not your fault. You didn't mean for this to happen." His electronically-modified voice sounded odd, off in some subtle way that Hank couldn't pin down.
What was happening to Jan and Tony while he was stuck down here? Sam had promised to call him if anything happened, but what if something happened so quickly that they didn't have time to call him? What if something happened that was serious enough that Cap didn't think of it?
Nothing to declare, of course, because she hadn't brought any luggage beyond the carry-on bag. Mindless tools didn't need extra changes of clothing. Was she here for business or pleasure? Oh, pleasure, definitely. Just a brief sight-seeing trip. She had been looking forward to it for a very long time. Did he think she should visit the Empire State Building first, or the Metropolitan Museum of Art? She had never been to the British Museum, and she had heard that the Metropolitan's Egyptian collection was surpassed only by the British Museum and the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Beside her, Sam was unsuccessfully trying to fend off Redwing's efforts to groom his hair, which were accompanied by fussing sounds that seemed an awful lot like scolding. "We're going to need a flatbed to get it back to the mansion," he observed. "Stop it. My hair is not- I'm fine, Redwing. Quit it."
"What is wrong with you?" he asked, not bothering to mince words. It was not the question he had meant to ask, but he could feel Don's wary, unwilling concern in the back of his mind. The idea of confronting a man when he was weakened and visibly unwell sat ill with him.
Clint snorted. "Like anyone will do anything. He's a rotting corpse who lives inside a containment unit."
"Yeah, that was before my time." Clint tried a smile. "Wanda, Pietro and I got the teamwork speech. Repeatedly." Cap had been even bossier back then, and convinced that being five whole years older than everyone else made them all children who needed his wise and experienced guidance. In retrospect, though, even Clint could admit that he and Pietro had been kind of bratty.
Which was presumably why she'd voted to accept Loki's assistance, alongside Sam and Tony. Neither her vote nor Sam's had been as surprising as Hank's resounding vote against, but when he thought about it, Steve supposed it made sense. Hank had been burned – badly – by supervillains before; Jan was nothing if not practical, the flighty persona she liked to put on notwithstanding; and Sam was more than able to grit his teeth and work with people he disliked if he thought it would serve the greater good.
"No."  It would only sound pathetic, and he'd have to tell Sam about what Doom had said, that he'd been brought back by human sacrifice.  Sam would be horrified, and he'd feel guilty for being relieved and happy that Steve was alive, and then would feel even worse about feeling guilty over that, and Sam had been through enough misery over the whole thing already.  He'd been there when Steve had been shot; Bucky had told him about it, afterwards, and about Sam stepping up to finish the speech Tony had tried to give at his funeral.
"It's not for me, okay?" Clint snapped, giving up on discretion. "I found a prescription for it in Tony's lab. Don wouldn't tell me what it was, so I asked you."
Tony fought down the impulse to snap at her. It wasn't her fault that he and Steve were both national -international, to be honest - celebrities, or that J.J. Jameson was probably going to trumpet Captain America's wedding to a formerly male and infamously debauched businessman as a sign of the moral decay of America. Or maybe not. One could never tell with Jameson; sometimes he displayed surprising flashes of liberal open-mindedness when you least expected them. Well, in between railing against superheroes as dangerous criminals and threats to public safety and printing the most unflattering photos of Hilary Clinton he could find.
"I... may have been over-reacting when I did that." Backing down and putting his real costume back on after all of that had been an embarrassing lesson in swallowing one's pride, but it had been the right thing to do. The administration whose actions he had been protesting had been on their way out - was out, now - and it had been time to stop grandstanding.
Even if he did occasionally want to hit him. "You make it sound so tawdry," Steve protested. It hadn't been like that, not really.
So that they would be prepared if she lost control again, Tony thought. It was what he would have done, what Steve had refused to let him do after the disaster with the fear toxin last month.
Getting the clothing on just reminded him of the ache in his shoulders and leg from spending hours chained to a wall.  Somehow, though transforming into Thor healed major injuries like the stab wound in his leg, it did nothing to erase exhaustion or sore muscles.  His bad leg would barely bend, and his knee felt like it might go out at any moment.
The gym at the mansion wasn't finished yet, and wouldn't be for at least another two weeks, so they were still using the one at the Avengers Tower – moving into the mansion was proving to be a slow, gradual process, and even now that the vast majority of both of their things had been moved over, and both they and Wanda were sleeping there, they still seemed to spend about eighty percent of their time in the tower. It was where everyone else was, where the fully functional lab was located, and where the gym didn't still have only half a floor.
"Don't even think about it," Jan snapped.  "The world won't end if it takes you a couple hours longer to get me out of here."
It was a hard kiss, almost violent. Tony's fingers dug into Steve's back, into his arm, hard enough that it would have left bruises on someone a little less durable. Steve kissed him back, one hand tangled in Tony's hair, holding him in place.
Magic had not been one of her father's preferred tools — it was a waste of time compared to the elegance of the cosmic cube — but that superstitious idiot Himmler had liked it, so he'd had to learn some of the basics.  Yet one more reason why things would have gone differently if he had been given the power he'd deserved.  This rite was intended to invite a demon or otherworldly force to possess the caster and imbue them with its powers.  With it, she would be able to take the spear's magic into herself.
From the slight wistfulness in his eyes, Steve was remembering old times as well. He glanced from Tony to Jan, who nodded ever-so-slightly, and then turned to Clint. "You're with me, Hawkeye," he said, as if nothing out of the ordinary were happening. "Wanda, Tony will fly you to the museum."
"Everyone's so big, and so loud," Jan sniffed, her voice just audible from where Steve knelt by Tony. "Help me, Clint. I'm scared."
Steve didn't like the way Tony's voice sounded, didn't like that he couldn't see his face. "You don't know that."
Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum was still disguised as a Starbucks, despite the fact that he wasn't trying to hide unregistered superheroes from the government anymore. Maybe he liked the privacy, or maybe it just amused him. You could never tell, with Strange.
"Huh," he said. "I never realized how much more sensitive women's breast are. Or, well, I knew, but I never really thought about what it would be like."
The crane had sheared off part of the building's seventh, eighth, and ninth stories when it fell, finally coming to a stop in the rubble of the partially collapsed fifth and sixth floors. It was still in place, a massive piece of twisted metal that pierced through two stories, lashed into place with sticky white webbing — Spiderman's new organic webbing was stronger than the artificially produced substance he'd apparently used before, and he'd covered both the crane and a wide swath of the building's crumbling outer façade in it.
He saw only snatches of what was going on around them, afraid to look away from Tony for more than a moment.  Carol and Thor were restraining Doom, one of them holding each of his arms.  Jan was kneeling by Clint, who was sitting up, one arm wrapped around his ribs, and trying to wave her off toward Wanda.  Sam was on his knees, too, head bent, cradling Redwing in his arms.  Strange was still unconscious, his balled up cloak supporting his head, and Wong was crouched beside Wanda.
The first cops and emergency personnel were just starting to arrive, with more sirens approaching in the distance, when Sam and Steve reached the building's tall, glass doors.
Tony shucked the rest of the armor quickly, avoiding Steve's eyes. He had just bent down to unfasten the last buckle on his remaining boot when he suddenly swayed, planting a hand on floor to steady himself.
Jan tensed, her body managing one last surge of adrenaline as she felt someone coming up behind her, and then Sam fell heavily to his knees next to Clint, Redwing cradled against his chest.
Steve started forward—and Wanda sagged to lean against the edge of the bed, the light flickering out.
Don mumbled something indistinct about Loki, not lifting his head.  Jan didn't think he was feigning.
Tony was out of sight now, the infirmary door having closed firmly behind him. Going in after him wouldn't contribute anything, Steve knew. He'd only be in the way.
Steve shook his head. "This is your house," he said, more stiffly than he'd intended to. "If you think you'd be more comfortable, or safer here... you're still an Avenger."
Don limped off down the hallway. Between the cane and stupid hat, it vaguely reminded Clint of something, but he wasn't sure what.
"You are looking at the spearhead of the federal government's new search for alternatives to fossil fuels. They were especially interested in the nuclear fusion project, though we're also going to push the refinements in solar technology we've made, because the public tends to get really twitchy when you use the words 'nuclear power' and 'green' in the same sentence."
There was probably never going to be a good time to utter the phrase, "I slept with Wanda, but I swear it's not my fault. Carol thinks I was mind-controlled; what do you think?" but right now seemed like an especially poor time.
"Well, whatever I was doing before, it's been replaced by called the landscapers to do something about this." Jan waved a hand at the torn-up lawn. "They've fixed worse damage before, but I want to make sure we get this taken care of before Jarvis feels like he has to start repairing it. He shouldn't have to clean up after those jerks."
"Cap." War Machine's voice again. "I think we might have a problem up here. What ever this stuff is, it's got people totally freaked out; I think half of them are having full on hallucinations, and trust me when I say that I've seen what happens when superhumans are exposed to that sort of thing. It's not good. Tony and the Wasp seem like they're handling it, but Carol's got her hands full at the windows, and I don't want to be the only person up here if the Wasp flips out and grows to twenty feet. Not to mention that if Tony's been exposed, we've got to get him out of the armor before he panics and blows somebody's head off."
That one, thankfully, had been resolved by the pilots and ground crew without serious incident. The squid had been another matter entirely. It had taken an entire afternoon to drive it back into New York Harbor, and Spiderman had insisted repeatedly that there were more of them under there, saying that his Spider-sense had been crawling for days.
Tony himself had been an even greater disaster as director, and she had been a decent second-in-command — better than he had deserved, really. Dum Dum Dugan even vouched for her these days, a significant departure from his previous low-level resentment of her for replacing Fury.
"You're not seriously marrying Loki."  The very idea was ridiculous, not the least because she couldn't think of anything about it that benefited Loki, aside from the ability to maneuver Doom like a pawn against her enemies, which she would probably be able to do anyway.  Who in their right mind would want to marry Doom?
The lines of fire that began arcing through the grass around them as Harkness spoke were considerably more impressive and worrying.
"When morning comes, I shall remove myself from this place." He spoke the words aloud, to give further weight to the decision. "I shall sleep tomorrow night in the Avengers' old home."
"Peter," MJ's voice was sympathetic, but Peter thought he detected a hint of amusement there, too, "you don't hate people."
Tony's smirk faltered, and then he was wearing the slick, polished smile he reserved exclusively for reporters. Jan fluffed her hair with one hand, and put on a smile of her own, one hopefully less superficial-looking than Tony's.
Wanda didn’t by any means have to be – that explosion of magic could have killed her, or she could open her eyes and be nothing but a puppet controlled by Chthon, the way she’d been when Clint had found her in Europe – but after everything that had been done to her, that would be beyond unfair, and Jan pushed the thought away.
"I think I'm kind of mad at myself, mostly," Peter admitted. "Because, yeah, Tony didn't tell me stuff, but a lot of it was stuff I didn't want to know, stuff I was happier not knowing. And I could probably have found it out sooner if I'd been looking harder. I'm kind of," he hesitated, gesturing vaguely with one hand, "glad I didn't know everything he and Reed knew when I had to pick sides." He swallowed hard, looking away. It all came back to Gwen again; if he had known, while she was falling, that stopping someone at terminal velocity could be as fatal as impact... Knowing that he'd deliberately chosen a course of action that he'd known would kill her -- because either option, catching her or letting her fall, would have killed her, he knew that now -- was the only thing that could have made the guilt worse. "What kind of man does that make me?"
None of them had invulnerability or super-strength, either, which hadn't been an issue yet, but had the potential to be.
Then again, one might also ask why Tony would choose to conceal his obvious illness. His health had ever been fragile, and his apparent decision not to seek aid for whatever ailed him could have grave consequences. His disregard for them offended Don nearly as much as Tony's secrecy and refusal to explain his actions had Thor.
"A lot." Tony concluded solemnly, smile turning wistful. He yawned, and added, "Mind giving me a hand up?"
Rhodey made a face. "I'm not touching that one." He shook his head slightly, and added, "Pepper got to you first, huh?"
himself when other people did. And then, afterwards, for running away to California and hiding from the rest of them, and for the dangerous and willfully illegal means he had used to get his stolen technology back.
"Okay," Tony said. "I won't." It wasn't as if he'd had much of a choice, but Steve was stubbornly clinging to his dislike of the Extremis. "I'll be gone for three days," he added. "Don't let Clint destroy the tower." He didn't mention that it would be the longest span of time they would be apart since Steve had come back. He wasn't that pathetic.
stab you in the back. Then you're left rotting in jail for their crimes, or trying to talk them out of cloning dead Initiative members as science projects."
For a moment, he could see the gently curving lines of Tony's naked back again, pale and smooth against the dark fabric of that stupid dress, remembered how Ton's body had felt against his. How he had tasted.
Steve folded his arms and leaned against the wall, to all appearances settling in to stay. "I'll wait."
The woman bucked violently, ripping herself free of his hold, and grabbed him by the throat, just below the bottom edge of his helmet – stupid, so stupid, letting himself get distracted that way – and then he was airborne.
Tony launched a kick of his own at Steve's side, and Steve twisted out of the way and tackled Tony -- who was off balance again -- to the mat.
Tony stood on his own, ignoring Steve's outstretched hand. "You just want to spy on me for Don to make sure I actually get some sleep," he accused.
They probably would; Tony had figured out a way around worse problems before, or rather, Yinsen had done it for him. And then the surgeons who'd done his first heart surgery had, and then the sentient armor. And then Maya herself, after her first Extremis test subject had left Tony so smashed up that the Extremis was their only option to keep him from dying of internal injuries.
"We'll see about that." He should have been annoyed – the genetic research for Beast hadn't produced any results yet, but he hadn't started comparing the homo superior genome to baseline human genetic material yet, and that was sure to generate interesting data – but instead, he found himself smiling. Jan was right. It was good for him to get out of the lab once in a while.
Afterwards, the two of them sat side-by-side on the floor, their backs against the wall of boxes, shoulders touching.
"No," Steve said quietly.  "It's not."  He lowered Tony's head and shoulders carefully, until his upper body was propped across Steve's knees, and resisted the impulse to wrap his arms around him and cradle him to his chest.
The fighting actually halted for a moment, as both the Avengers and the Masters of Evil all turned to stare at him.
He crawled the last few feet, gritting his teeth against the pain, and then his fingers were around Mjolnir's haft.
Steve shifted his weight in the now-familiar plastic chair, which hadn't gotten any more comfortable. He'd been briefly dragged away by Sam and Clint in order to eat dinner, but otherwise he hadn't left Tony's side. And Tony hadn't woken up once.
"I don't know.  He's been stabbed."  Hank shrank back to normal size, then went pale, swaying against the wall.  "I hate being out of practice," he muttered.  "This never happens when I use my powers regularly."  He took a deep breath, then bent down to peer at Don's leg.
Tony froze, the armor going motionless like a machine that had abruptly had its power shut off. Then he shook his head, turned away from them all, and silently left the room.
It would probably be a simple thing to get Extremis to interface with one of the Ant-Man helmets, creating a cybernetic version of the biological antennae Hank had never been able to convince his body to accept. Unfortunate that the failure rate for Extremis was so high.
"I did, didn't I?" Steve said, grinning slowly. He crossed the room in three long strides, and then he was sitting balanced on the arm of Tony's chair, facing him, an arrangement that made him a full head taller than Tony, instead of the usual couple of inches.
His teleportation was supposed to be disabled.  Jack's vault should have been a trap, with the Dee book as so much tempting megalomaniac-bait.  Instead—
Now that he had control of the situation, Steve realized, he didn't have the first clue what to do about it. None of this had been planned. Fantasized about, yes, but never planned.
After an impossibly long moment, Tony nodded. Then he collapsed to his knees, the joints of the armor rattling faintly, and sagged forward, one hand flat against the floor.
He tried to sit up, to roll over onto his side, anything to get away to clean air, but his couldn't move, his body so heavy that he couldn't even lift his head.
Rhodey knew and didn't mind, he reminded himself. Pepper didn't. Jarvis was happy for them. All the people who were important to them already knew. How much of the rest of the world's reactions really mattered, in light of that?
Clint winced, and she didn’t think it was from pain this time.  “She’ll be okay.  We won, right?  Chthon’s gone.  She has to be.”
"I'm not really sure it's possible for me to come on to you more obviously than this, Steve, short of climbing into bed with you in the middle of the night, completely naked." Tony stripped the undershirt off and threw it to one side, leaving him in nothing but shorts and a black sports bra that didn't completely hide his scars. It was impossible, like this, to ignore the fact that his body was inarguably female, just as it had been the other night when he'd walked into the living room in that dress.
She made an attempt at a smile, her lips curving upward slightly, but Clint could see the strain in it. "You did help me. Before you showed up, I was like a zombie – I didn't remember anything, not even who I was. You woke me up. It took me a long time to escape from Chthon's control, but without you, I would probably still be locked up in that house on Mount Wundagore. Or, worse, Chthon would already be free." She looked down at her hands again, tracing the line of Strange's tattoo with one finger. "I know I ought to be more upset that it happened," she said quietly, "that Chthon used you that way, but I can't be. I can't be sorry that I escaped from there. But I am sorry you were dragged into it."
"If I don't, I won't be eating until dinner. The board wants to discuss the past quarter's financial reports and stock performance. And then I'm supposed to go sit in on arbitration proceedings for that lawsuit with Hewlett Packard."
Inside, the chaos magic that had been only faintly detectable from the street was a swirling miasma, almost visible. It seemed to envelope her as she walked closer to the high altar, seeping into every pore of her body. Unlike Chthon's power, it felt clean, pure.
"Actually, it's Mrs. Watson-Parker," MJ's voice was dry. Then she looked up, her eyes meeting Peter's. "Peter! There you are. Is everyone all right?"
"I'm not sure. I keep thinking that I may be imagining it, because Loki's powers and my powers are both chaos based, but I sense Chthon's touch in it. Loki's a chaos deity, but Chthon is raw chaos itself, and the magic wrapped around Tony is raw chaos. That's part of what makes it so difficult to counter. And the structure of the spell..." She took another sip of her tea, resisting the urge to wrinkle her nose at the taste, then set it aside. "It feels more like witchcraft than sorcery."
Steve was already there, of course. He'd probably taken the subway, which at this time of day was often faster than trying to drive.
Steve brought his shield up, and realized just as he felt the first bullet hit it that he had no idea where the ricochets would go. "Scarlet Witch-" he shouted.
Rhodey had caught up with him, just in time for them to reach the table reserved for the two of them and Jan together.
, anything that wasn't about death or burning or regrets it was too late to do anything about. "And I'm sorry for..." How did you even say this –
"Do not break anything." Jan's voice was sharp over his communicator, slightly shrill the way it often was when she was in Wasp form. "Iron Man, Thor, you guys stay out here. We need you covering the exits in case they try to run."
Tony's eyes looked closer to grey than blue in the corner's carefully dim light, and some trick of lighting made dark shadows gather under them. Or maybe the dark smudges were real. "We don't have anything to hide," Steve went on. "It's not illegal anymore." He probably sounded as if he were giving a speech, he reflected, and from Tony's fractional headshake, it wasn't a very convincing one.
Clint planted one hand on the balcony rail and sprang over it, tucking and rolling so that he hit the ground shoulder-first, and sprang to his feet with a dramatic flourish that he immediately ruined by stumbling over a chunk of plaster.
And then Tony arched backwards, the lights in his armor flickering and going dark, and collapsed noisily to the floor.
He wasn't going back to LA until he was sure he'd done everything he could to make sure Tony was okay.
Loki folded her arms, the gesture emphasizing the lush curves of her breasts, and pouted. "What must I do to earn your trust, thunder-god? What further assurances of my goodwill can I give you?"
Knowing that Tony's "let's talk to Loki and see what she means by 'help us'" plan had been voted down five-to-three—Wanda's vote in favor hadn't technically counted—wouldn't make the need to smile and be polite, or at least not openly hostile, the next time she appeared any easier to swallow.
"That's private," Steve said, forcing the words out around the tight knot in his throat. "And so was this." He touched the picture of himself and Tony at the museum with one fingertip.
Tony had been landing fewer blows than usual, though his defense hadn't suffered as much from lack of practice as Steve had expected. Before his transformation, Tony had been barely two inches shorter than Steve, his reach nearly identical. Now, he was half a foot shorter than he had been, and he still hadn't learned to compensate properly for the loss in both reach and mass.
Tony was standing in the middle of the disaster area the restaurant had become, completely motionless, the armor making him look like an incongruous art deco statue. Steve jerked his eyes away from Tony to make a quick scan of the rest of the room -- Jan was kneeling on the floor behind a table, a small child firmly attached to her neck; War Machine was restraining a man in a white waiter's jacket who was still clutching a steak knife in one hand -- before his gaze was pulled back to Tony.
"Is the deep fryer still in the cabinet over the stove?" she asked, pulling the frost-encrusted hostess box out of the freezer.
Vision nodded solemnly, and faded into transparency, floating away through the ceiling. Wanda stared after him, her features set in a blank expression that Jan could tell took effort to maintain. "I'll go unpack," she said, and walked off in the direction of the back staircase, shoulders stiff.
Don stared up from where he knelt on the floor to see Loki standing over him, the huge golden horns of her headdress silhouetted against the ceiling.
Steve's shoulders sagged in relief, and he rubbed a hand over his face. "Good," he said. "I knew he'd be okay."
"I-" Steve started, and then his throat closed up. He shook his head, silently, raising one hand to touch Tony's face, then letting his palm slide down from Tony's jaw to the base of his neck, Tony's skin warm under his hand.
"You meant it exactly that way. Why do people always act like my experiments go wrong on purpose?" Hank flung his hands out, narrowly missing knocking over a test tube full of god knew what.
There was a chair by the wall, the only piece of furniture the room contained other than the bed.  It was the same hard, utilitarian plastic most hospital chair were made of, but Don was used to that.  He lowered himself gingerly into it, sore muscles protesting, and stretched his leg out.  “They want to keep you here for another 24 hours because they’re still not sure what actually happened to you, but SHIELD is pushing to have you transferred to the Helicarrier.
Every nerve on edge, Wanda made a careful circuit of the house, finding no one. Everything was very clean and neat, almost sterile. She had no books, no photographs, not even so much as a vase of flowers. The house was like a cottage in a children’s picture book; one that was still waiting for someone to actually live there.
Five minutes later, Hank was still hiding on the other side of the giant living room, and Jan had decided that this was getting ridiculous. "Hank," she said abruptly, "would you mind bringing that pillow over here?" She waved a hand, indicating the throw pillow that was lying on the seat of the empty armchair next to Hank.
Clint was staring at her, his eyes slightly glazed. It might have been from fatigue, since he'd spent most of the past day leading Kang's elite personal guard on a chase across the rooftops of Manhattan, but Steve didn't think so.
Tony was poking desultorily at his computer now, resting his chin on one hand; Steve wasn't sure if he was putting the finishing touches on his project, or had just run out of steam. He had been working on it for at least an hour, by Steve's watch.
"Because a month ago you had cracked ribs and one arm in a sling." And two weeks before that, they'd all just been waiting for the point at which he would inevitably snap. Or at least, she had been. If Steve hadn't come back, she would have given it about another month.
Scott's little girl would be what, now? Fourteen? Wanda could remember when Cassie had been seven, a tiny blonde girl in an over-sized Avengers t-shirt who had thought having a superhero for a father was the coolest thing in the world. She had collected insects in jars and kept them by her bed.
The need to act swiftly was an irritant in the back of his mind, continually running up against the need to handle Sin with care, and curb her bloodthirst and anarchistic tendencies. Yet one more indignity to make Strange pay for, given that it was his spell that made her presence necessary.
"You take the Wrecker, Iron Man," Steve ordered. "Your armor has the best chance of standing up to his crowbar. I'll take Piledriver. Falcon?"
Sin distracted and one intruder dead or dying still left something like ten or eleven men for Sam and Hank, and Hank's unarmed combat skills left something to be desired.  It wasn't like fighting next to Steve, who always had his back and whose movements Sam could track without even looking, and whose shield would protect him from any bullets that ricocheted off Sam's wings.  He had to keep one eye on the snake-Nazis and one on Hank, ready to yank him out of the way of a knife or burst of gunfire.
