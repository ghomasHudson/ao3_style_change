I welcomed the frigid air that greeted me. I wrapped my scarf more tightly around me and walked quickly to Marylebone Road where I immediately hired a cab.
John raised his eyebrows and mock-frowned. Sherlock shook his head. Why was his brother insisting on expressing sentiment. They never did that. Impatient with Mycroft and itching for some time alone with John, he said, “Yes, yes, thank you, brother.”
They collapsed together, John a heavy weight along Sherlock’s back. His cock twitched inside him. Sherlock closed his eyes and sighed, “You’ve got me seeing stars.”
No matter, there was another one chilled. John brought it and his camera out to the deck. He filled their cups and moved his chair closer to Sherlock’s so he could reach over and place his hand on his leg. Sherlock hummed and stroked down his arm once. They sipped and listened to the surprisingly loud sound of gentle waves hitting the sand.
“Oh, you’re gorgeous.”
Sherlock rolled the glans of John’s cock with his thumb on the frenulum and his forefinger and middle finger on the corona. He relaxed down along John’s side with his head resting on his hip with his eyes focused on John’s cock in his hand. “It could even be called cute.”
He swept his eyes around the room. The flat was a studio so they could inspect all of the man’s possessions in 55 square metres. He came over to where John was still looking at the photographs. He placed his hand on one shoulder. John looked up at him and smiled weakly.
While Greg argued with the agents, John had moved a few steps away toward the sounds of the struggle they’d heard. He needed to know where Mary was. He needed to know that they’d caught her and Graham. He needed to know if she’d met a worse fate. Her scream had been desperate and full of pain.
John released himself to focus on Sherlock. “These need to come off now.” He looked at Sherlock’s tight jeans and imagined he thought they might be a bit difficult. Nimble fingers slowly unzipped his flies and tugged downward from his waistband.
Sherlock smirked as John’s gaze drifted down and his eyes went wide. Sherlock’s dressing gown might have opened a bit upon impact, revealing his nudity.
Sherlock’s eyes flicked over the doorway, and over to the hair and makeup people. They would transform him into a suit-wearing sex bomb. Sherlock walked to the small room and went inside, nodding at the man and woman waiting just outside. John followed and lingered in the doorway.
John seemed to understand and pushed the hand not grasping Sherlock’s cock against his arse to drive his erection further down John’s throat. Afraid of hurting John, he reluctantly pulled off at the last possible second and rested John’s erection on his cheek. Sherlock stilled and arched his back, pulsing his release down John’s throat over and over again. He was vaguely aware of his quiet strangled cry emitted through gritted teeth. God, John knew how to milk the pleasure out of him.
Sherlock thrust his interested-yet-sated cock against John’s belly, quirked an eyebrow, and said, “More than a handful, John.”
“Why are you saying these things? Why are you overreacting?”
He surged up and pinned Sherlock’s rabbity hands near his ears and covered his entire face with tiny kisses.
“Oh? Aren’t you happy at Shad?”
Sherlock glanced at it. “No, it doesn’t. Listen to me.”
They were quiet during their ride to Agra. Sherlock thought about their plan and felt a small flutter of nerves in his gut. He squeezed the fingertips of one hand with his other, working the cuticles and nails, trying to ground his body into stillness. He thought about Victor and wondered where he was, how he was being treated. He bit his lower lip and chewed the inside of his cheek, working his fingertips against each other.
“‘Another excellent idea.”
John reached down and grabbed the base of his cock and squeezed, dislodging Sherlock’s hand from its position. He closed his eyes and blew out a long breath. When he looked back down at Sherlock, he said, “You can’t say things like that. Jesus.” He smiled weakly.
“Good, I want to touch every centimeter of you.”
John moaned and squirmed beneath him, pressing up into Sherlock. His hands roamed all over Sherlock's back, arse, thighs.
Tears ran down his face. They had failed. Good men had died. James lost his career. He could only imagine how devastated James must be. He tried writing back but his short reply predictably bounced back immediately.
In a flurry of activity, everyone went to work to wrap up and clean up their area. Claire cleaned the makeup off of Sherlock’s face with some moist cloths that got most everything. A bit of dark liner remained around his alien eyes. Sherlock changed into his own clothes. Well, his own trousers and coat - he put John’s t-shirt back on. John let it go without comment and merely smiled to himself.
He just watched me, his cheek resting on his closed fist, one side of his mouth quirked up.
“Gavin Adams,” Sherlock said, looking up, curious.
He opened his eyes, which went directly to the ceiling where a small crack and water spot had settled in years ago. Focus on that fissure and stain had helped Sherlock to ground himself upon waking for all of the time he’d lived at Baker Street. When he was away for two years, if he was in any one place for more than a few hours, he would find an imperfection on the ceiling. It was comforting that no matter where he was or how long he’d been gone. He could find a paint chip, a hairline crack, a smudge of paint, once a spatter of blood, that would remind him of home. Of Baker Street. Of John.
John nodded.
The word popped into his thoughts, surprising him. He had never, ever considered it. He’d only been to one wedding, when he was still a teenager. He knew then that no one would ever look at him the way his cousin looked at his betrothed. Too skinny, too tall, sociopathic with a devastatingly sharp tongue, and well on his way to a annihilating drug habit. No, no one would want him like that.
“Someday I’ll tell you, beautiful.”
Sherlock took his hand and led him back to bed. They climbed in and curled around each other. Sherlock couldn’t remember the last time he’d consciously shared a bed with anyone for sleep. Maybe he’d never done. But here was John, warm and small and perfectly suited for Sherlock to wrap his body around and settle down for sleep.
“Let’s go.”
Sherlock smiled at John and kissed his lips softly.
Sherlock made tea. He ordered takeaway. He ate regularly and generally behaved like John’s version of what he thought he liked (not what he actually liked...because what he actually liked was Sherlock manic with glee and a dangerous glint in his eye).
Sherlock frowned, “What?”
Sherlock swallowed John all the way down. The best orgasm John had ever felt ripped through his muscles, down to his bones, and over his skin. His stomach muscles contracted and he let out a hoarse yell. Sherlock breathed noisily through his nose, stilling to let John pulse and pulse his release down his throat, all the while thrusting his cock into John’s leg.
“I probably don’t want to know why you know a homicide detective at Scotland Yard.”
“John, it would appear that you have discovered something about me that I did not know,” referring to whatever that was, it was a least a spectacular orgasm that rocked him somewhere deep.
Sherlock’s fingers were long and impossibly graceful. He was thin, probably too thin, but his body was strong and muscular. John could write poetry, and probably would start any day now, about his arse and hips. It was sinful that man so tall and slim should be so dorsally well-endowed. All of the contradictions were what made him so stunning.
John unpacked his equipment and propped everything up by a doorway. He heard Billy grunt in question as he took a key bundle from his jacket and opened a doorway leading to a small room. The room was filled with old equipment making it seem like an old control room for when the train went by there.
“I need you too. Promise you’ll never leave me again.”
“Shit, shit, shit,” Lestrade said, punching at his phone screen, then lifting it to his ear. “Get eyes on him, now!”
I've wanted to write a whole fic with these two as model and photographer. Down the road, this might just be developed into a longer story...how are we feeling about that? (edit: full length fic is in the works) (edit2: full length fic is done, called My Pictures of You).
John could not hide his surprise, nor could he ignore the gorgeous powerful man in front of him, holding out his hand in invitation. He nodded and shook the man’s hand.
Perhaps my worry was all for naught. After all, I had told him about my drug use. Would he even want to stay acquainted with me, much less share rooms? I had also abandoned him at the restaurant without explanation. I understood this to be fairly rude.
Mycroft continued, now in a rush, “I miss you. I know I ruined everything, but I want to ask if you could possibly forgive me and let me have you again.”
“For a genius, you really are quite dim.”
I took a deep breath in order to project loudly, but the door opened and I shut my mouth with an unfortunate click of teeth. Hudders walked in with a tray of tea and slices of cake.
One of the other models, James, sat on the other side of Jack and was flirting openly with him. In his harsh Northern accent, every sentence sounded twice as filthy, dripping with innuendo and suggestion. Poor Jack looked like a rabbit frozen under the gaze of a wild cat every time James guffawed and squeezed his neck. James was either oblivious to Jack’s mortification, or was sadistically enjoying the quiet, young beauty’s discomfort. Either way, John didn’t like it. At all.
The receptionist blinked several times. “I’ll take that.” Sherlock handed him his book. He hadn’t said much, but the receptionist also had a skillfully crafted London accent. Sherlock suspected his was from the North and was trying to fit in down here.
“The work is...stimulating.”
John tilted his head to one side and knit his brows together. He said slowly, “You may have…”
John just stood and stared at her, palms out trying to placate her. She steadily looked back at him.
John moaned and said, “Sh...Sher....oh god.”
Sherlock smiled, released John’s wrists, and rested his hand, almost protectively, on the crown of John’s head. “I’ve loved you for years. I think I loved you as soon as I laid eyes on you.”
Quickly, he sat up and Sherlock felt him tug at the zip tie around his wrists. His arms immediately fell to his sides as the pressure of the tie was severed. He moaned in relief and the man chuckled again, thrusting his hips one last time before standing and walking to the door. Sherlock looked up at him in time to see him stow the knife in a sheath on his belt.
“Sir! You can’t - “
He wanted to talk to him, wanted to hold him. He wanted to comfort him and tell him that he was right and good and that everything would be all right. With a black pit sinking from his heart deep into his stomach, he knew he would never see James again.
John put down his mug of tea and stared at his phone. He was unable to understand why he felt so connected to Sherlock. He desperately wanted to forget him, he knew he should ignore the text. In his right mind he knew he needed to ignore the pull, the connection, the affinity for this one person like he’d rarely felt before. Before he could decide what to do (
John scoffed, “Well, we can’t all be too tall, impossibly elegant, with impeccable balance and style.”
John was taken aback at his incredulous hostility and became defensive. “Maybe I don’t. You look like you hate me right about now.”
John saw James quickly running towards him, bent low at the waist, with hands up placatingly. John pointed to his press badge and mouthed soundlessly, “Press.”
They lost themselves in the sensation of wet kisses, lust, and deep sighs. Tongues twined over and over again. Greg paid no attention to their surroundings. He had Mycroft again and he wasn't going to let go.
Sherlock answered before Anderson could open his mouth, “Asphyxiation is extremely rare in the absence of obvious trauma to the neck except in cases of anaphylaxis. Here there is evidence of neither. Clearly poisoning. Was it accidental or murder? I need to find the poison and the motive to prove the latter.”
“Oh!” Molly gasped, “Can we do anything to help? Sherlock, are you all right?”
Sherlock almost forgot what he was supposed to be doing. He was going to happily come all over the rug with the taste of John on his tongue.
Sherlock’s whole head jerked up, lips parted. John recognized his blinking as part of his ‘you’ve surprised me’ look.
He adores looking down at Sherlock’s wet curls plastered to his forehead, his only-ones-in-the-world aquamarine eyes half-lidded with lust, his perfect full lips open, teeth exposed, huffing “ah, ah, ah” as John squeezes around him. He rocks up and down, angled perfectly so that the sensitive crown of Sherlock’s cock nudges against his prostate with every thrust. Sherlock’s large hands grip his arse but John is controlling every movement.
John whimpered and pushed up to lock their lips together again. After a few moments of hot, slick kisses, Sherlock pulled back again and looked down at his cock resting on the hem of John’s cardigan.
John writhed and pushed back into Sherlock’s face. “Need you.”
Despite the seriousness of his injury, despite the pain, despite his uncertainty about his own career, his thoughts never wandered too far from James.
John looked up at him with absolute wonder in his eyes. “You do, don’t you?”
“I suppose,” was all I said.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft whispered. He opened his eyes and the brothers stared at each other. As was their custom, a whole conversation was exchanged with that look. A single tear fell down Sherlock’s cheek. Mycroft frowned, squeezed his hand weakly, and said, “None of that now.”
“What about the woman?”
They stayed that way for several minutes. He saw John’s fists relax a bit, and without looking up, saw his body grow slightly less tense. He wondered if he should say something but he thought bitterly that he had probably said quite enough.
“It’s going to just get colder, let’s begin.”
John crossed his arms and pulled his lips into a detached smile, a dangerous smile. “Hello, Mary.” She blinked at him. As the agents walked her by him, he growled, “I don’t need to tell you why I’m here. But I’m glad I am so I can see them walk you out in cuffs.”
“I agree, we’ll be right behind you. Find out what happened to my people.”
Thanks for reading! I am
John looked at him with such sadness that Sherlock had to look down.
John raised his hand to Sherlock’s neck to gently squeeze his nape. Sherlock smiled softly.
After several long moments of light touches, soft kisses, and long, sweeping caresses across skin, John kissed Sherlock’s head and whispered, “I can’t wait to be in your bed every night.”
“Yes.”
Sherlock continued his slow rubbing, up and down John’s back from his arse to the nape of his neck. They were undulating against each other rubbing and squeezing and kissing. It was very heated, very quickly.
He walked around the room then paced rapidly back and forth in front of the windows. He answered, “Sherlock Holmes.”
Moustache had stepped back during Sherlock’s speech. “Uh...”
John looked at him as if he’d completely lost his mind and he was vaguely happy about it. “You’re barking. Pun intended.”
He made a distracted, flippant gesture with his hand and said, “Anytime,” but his eyes stayed on John’s. He looked expectant. Hesitant. Vulnerable.
He pinned Sherlock’s arm up behind him with one hand, his other hand gripped the back of his neck tightly. Voice dangerously low, he said into Sherlock’s ear, “I'm not the idiot here.”
Greg complained, “We had them, with just a few officers. A small operation.”
“Sorry,” John said and waved his hand at Sherlock, a vague gesture.
John shut his mouth.
He sighed, “No, she only stayed about 15 minutes, actually.”
“What did I get wrong?” he said quietly. He seemed smaller somehow, seeking John’s approval.
Luminescent eyes rolled, “Of course.”
“Here, read it for yourself.” She handed him the unsealed envelope.
“Do you want to do something about that?” Sherlock asked, grinning.
“What for?” Sherlock asked dismissively.
"It's supposed to mean that you tell me that all the time, stop being an idiot."
He got off the table, grabbed Sherlock's hand and started leading him towards Sherlock's bedroom.
John smiled sadly at him. It must be something bad if Sherlock didn't believe John could help him. "We'll see," he said, and kissed Sherlock again. This time the detective returned the pressure. Kiss after kiss followed the first one, Sherlock's hunger and desperation growing with each. He was clearly in need of comforting and this, this physical connection, was the only thing he would allow himself.
"Do you know when he can be released?"
He reached his hand out to John's and interlaced their fingers, giving John's hand a brief squeeze of reassurance. John was finally here with him and everything was going to be fine. He had his reputation to build back up, he owed a lot of explanations, but right now all he could think about was John. Everything else, all the worries and all the pain and all the memories of the last few months fell away now that he was here. He closed his eyes, engulfing himself in John's presence. As he mused on how comfortable and at home he felt like this he wondered if John felt the same way. He hadn't pushed away yet but would he be uncomfortable with their current predicament? He felt John hold him closer, his arm now wrapped firmly around Sherlock in an embrace, answering the detective's unspoken question.
“Might as well.”
"Good morning," he announced and made his way over to the bathroom. Sherlock did not respond; he didn't even seem to have noticed John coming into the room, which was unusual.
John was keeping a very close eye on Sherlock who was picking at his food dismally, more so than usual, which was strange especially when he hadn’t eaten properly in days.
Lauren removed her stethoscope from her ears, settling it over her shoulders. “I can hear a wheeze on the apex of the right lung, and decreased breath sounds on both bases,” she observed worriedly. She took the mask from Matt as he cranked up the oxygen and placed it over Sherlock’s face. “This is going to relax your airway and help with your breathing, Sherlock.”
The paramedics shared a look between them, silently deciding that it would be best to keep John busy. Besides, it was always helpful to have an extra set of hands, especially from someone who knew what they were doing. “Monitor his GCS, keep talking to him,” Matt said. He looked at Lauren, “I’ll take over ventilating.”
They finally broke apart and John settled back on the sofa.
After Matt handed her the bag, she busied herself with setting up her equipment and, as always, the sight of a needle seemed to alarm everyone in the room.
"So I've been told."
“Oh, so that’s why my head hurts.”
Time passed surprisingly quickly. After months spent away from John, Sherlock was now painfully aware of his absence. There had been many times in the past when Sherlock hadn’t noticed John going out, even if he told him beforehand. Now, however, there were very few times when the detective didn’t know where John was.
He walked in to the living room to see Sherlock staring at him. It was clear he’d heard the question and was simply refusing to answer it. “Sherlock,” John warned.
“I don’t want to have to go through that again, John. I can’t, I-” his voice broke and he collapsed onto John again.
"Sure."
“Alright, alright,” Lestrade conceded, raising his hands in surrender, “you shouldn’t be so cranky; it’s your birthday after all, enjoy it.”
Sherlock then started sliding down until his head was right between John's legs and John had to hold on to the headboard when Sherlock's tongue slid out.
To everyone's relief- mostly Sherlock's- he was released the next day after a number of strict rules, all of which he only intended to follow if John agreed. As soon as he woke up he called a nurse in and after a final check he was deemed ready to go home. He text John as soon as he could, telling him to meet him at the hospital at once. It wasn't even half an hour later when John showed up at the door.
“His sats are 78% and he’s tachycardic,” Matt relayed as he set up a nebuliser mask with the drugs to help Sherlock.
It wasn’t a full minute later when John was leaning over Sherlock’s writhing form, two fingers deep inside him, while he kissed the detective thoroughly from lips all the way down to his chest over and over again.
Mycroft was getting worried at the state Sherlock was in. It wasn't often he allowed others to see how agitated he was, much less Mycroft, and he was starting to wonder if his problem was more serious than he had first thought. Before he could even ask what was wrong Sherlock stopped pacing and blurted it out.
“I’ll be back in just a second, Sherlock, alright?”
"Hey, Sherlock, look at me," John said and moved his hand under Sherlock's chin, forcing him to look up. And Sherlock was surprised, so very surprised, when he didn't see pity there. He knew. Just like he’d predicted, John knew that Sherlock couldn’t stand the pity or the disapproval or the judgement. And Sherlock knew now, looking John in the eye, that he wasn’t disappointed, he was worried. Worried about Sherlock because he cared, because he loved him. And Sherlock was so grateful that he buried his face in John’s shoulder and wrapped his arms tightly around him.
“Maybe,” Sherlock admitted, “I had other things on my mind, after all.”
John stood up on shaky legs and started waking towards Sherlock. "You're here," he whispered, in a wistful tone.
John broke the kisses and brought his hands up to Sherlock's back, trying to be gentle as he examined the bruising, but there were times when Sherlock still hissed in pain. Whenever that happened John lightened his touch and ran his tongue over Sherlock's neck to keep him distracted. When he was finally satisfied that the bruises were healing as well as they should he settled the dressing gown over Sherlock again and gently wrapped his arms around the detective.
“I didn’t know what to get you, so I wrote something for you.”
"What are you wearing?" he asked.
They sat happily watching telly and sipping their tea, both glad to finally be home together. Sherlock had snuggled under John's arm with a blanket spread over him.
The detective quickly slipped out of them, along with his pants, and dropped them over the side of the bed. “Your turn.”
John frowned. He knew it must have been difficult for Sherlock to work up the courage to propose but he never would have thought that Sherlock might have been worried about rejection. “And why would I do that?”
He closed his eyes without even realising as John reciprocated, bringing their lips together again. When they finally separated they both sat very still, foreheads touching, simply looking into one another’s eyes.
“The food’s fine, John,” he said as he pushed the plate away, “I just feel a bit nauseous.”
“We cornered him, he hit John and then he got what he deserved,” Sherlock replied quickly, slowly walking towards the road where he could get a cab.
He watched as John reached his hand out slowly towards him and lightly stroked Sherlock’s forehead, the gesture bringing a heaving sigh of relief with it.
When the laughter subsided John picked himself up and helped Sherlock off the floor. As soon as he did so Sherlock threw him down on the bed and climbed on top of him, a wide grin plastered on his face.
“I have to say,” John started as he delivered a particularly firm thrust- Sherlock moaned audibly. “I sure as shit am glad we’re finally doing this.” He chuckled and watched in amusement as the man beneath him rolled his eyes
“Sherlock, what’s wrong”?
But Sherlock wouldn’t move, only to shake his head. “Please, you know it’ll help. I hate seeing you like this.”
“When are we going to tell people?” John asked.
Sherlock nodded, and that was all the confirmation she needed. “Matt, can you get the truck ready?”
There had been many times when John Watson had thought about marriage. When he got his first girlfriend he wondered if they would remain together long enough to contemplate the union, when his sister got married he started questioning whether or not he would ever do the same and as he lay bleeding surrounded by gunfire he resigned himself to the fact that maybe marriage just wasn’t in the cards for him.
“Head rush,” Sherlock replied, “I’m fine now, I just need something to eat.”
"I don't know what to do," he whispered pleadingly.
"I should have known better than to think you'd cleared everything up. You probably hid everything in there," John teased. He knew that wasn't true, Sherlock had done a very good job cleaning the flat, and he understood that Sherlock didn't want to discard of any of his experiments, but he liked to see Sherlock squirming and trying to explain himself.
"Then that explains why you fainted," John said as he sat down next to Sherlock and wrapped his arms around him. "I just worry about you, Sherlock, you know that."
They both moaned in pleasure and John closed his eyes and buried his head in Sherlock's shoulder. Sherlock started thrusting slowly in and out, John meeting his thrusts with his hips.
"A shouting match by the look of it," replied Sherlock, keeping an eye on the young boy who was now wandering aimlessly away from his parents.
They fell into bed together, Sherlock in his pyjamas and dressing gown and John in his pants, which he thought was an unfair advantage for his partner.
“Uhhh, oh, oh, John, yes, oh fucking
Sherlock’s orgasm hits him like a train and he throws his head back and wails, toes curling in his socks behind John’s head. His cock, completely untouched, spurts out long ropes of come and he’s folded in such a way that they land on his long pale throat and his own open mouth.
“Will this do?”
He grabs John’s hand and tries to drag him towards the bedroom, forgetting the shorts holding his legs together and he very nearly stumbles and falls over. John bursts out laughing whilst Sherlock glares daggers at him. He strips the shorts off and chucks them at John’s head who dodges them, still giggling, and turns and saunters towards the bedroom. As he goes John reaches out and gives his delightful arse a slap, and Sherlock turns his head and gives him a filthy smirk over his shoulder.
“John. I was in an optimal state of comfort for thinking”. He flings a pale hand dramatically across his face with a sigh. “How can I be expected to work in these conditions-”.
John can only stare for a few seconds before he gives himself a little shake and starts frantically stripping his clothes off. He’s still wearing his badge from the surgery and that joins the growing pile in the corner as he hops on one foot, pulling off shoes and socks and trousers.
“Damn right I do, lucky for you. Don’t know what other poor bastard would put up with you. Now give me those incredible legs of yours.”
too short. John has never been so grateful to be shorter than Sherlock in his life. Whereas on John, the shorts come down to a couple of inches above the knee, on Sherlock at least half of his thighs are on display. John takes a moment to appreciate them – Sherlock is slender, but he still has excellent muscle definition, and a sparse covering of fine, dark hairs. John’s tongue darts out to wet his lips, forcing his eyes continue their downwards progression, and he barely contains a moan when he takes in the
“Fine.” John tries to shift out from underneath Sherlock, who winds his long fingers into the front of John’s shirt, grumbling. John firmly untwines his fingers and dumps his head unceremoniously (but gently) on to the sofa. “I have to go to work Sherlock”.
“Where are you going?” He still sounds slightly out of breath.
and Sherlock was mad for it, for him. For John. He almost wished their positions were reversed so that he could lean down and take John into his mouth, lapping at the slit, tasting him at his most intense, before swallowing him down to the root, pressing his nose into those damp curls where he just smelt so good… But no, that was for another time. Sherlock needed John inside him now, like he needed air, and to make the point he hitched one foot up onto the table with a hand behind his knee, and spread himself open.
“Fuck, please,
“Exactly” Sherlock rumbled, that blissed out smile still plastered on his face “My dear Watson, that is exactly the point”.
“Show me”.
“And what’s that?” Sherlock breathes.
John shucked his trainers off (they joined the pile in the corner) and stepped across to Sherlock in his muddy rugby socks, grinning as he placed a kiss on his proffered lips, head tilting up as he sat on the kitchen chair.
“God, look at you. Your legs are a crime Sherlock”. He slips one hand up behind Sherlock’s head and draws him down into a kiss, which starts off slow and sweet, but when they pull back after some moments they are both panting none the less. Sherlock leans his forehead against John’s.
John slipped his fingers out and grasped Sherlock’s hips, tipping them up slightly as Sherlock brought his long legs up once again around John’s waist, hooking his ankles together behind his back. John gripped his cock at the base and pressed the head against Sherlock’s twitching entrance, before suddenly sliding into the hilt with a hiss as Sherlock bore down and took him in, groaning aloud at the sensation, head dropping back.
, take me to bed John”.
John kissed each of his closed eyelids tenderly, listening to their gasping breaths in the silence of the kitchen, nothing but the brisk October wind audible from outside.
“What –
Back in the present, Sherlock was reverently running both hands now up and down over the sides of John’s shorts, occasionally slipping a hand up to stroke at John’s belly underneath the jersey, feeling the definition of his abs and the tempting line of dark-blonde hair running down into the shorts. They also dropped down every now and then and ran from the back to the front of John’s thighs, feeling the power in his quads and hamstrings. John looked down, and saw that Sherlock was openly panting, and tenting his pyjama bottoms. Finally, he gripped the waistband at the front of John’s shorts and tugged insistently, and John sank down onto his lap, placing his arms on either side of his head on the back of the chair. Sherlock’s breath quickened further at that and he tilted his face up again, eyes burning with heat now, silently begging for another kiss. John dipped his face down and captured Sherlock’s mouth with his own, as he felt those elegant hands come up from his shorts to grasp at his biceps, firm and strong after a year of playing. Sherlock groaned as he did so, the first proper noise he had made since John had cut off his deduction a few minutes ago, and John revelled in it, not quite believing that he, John Watson was somehow fit enough to cause a devastatingly gorgeous man to
He reluctantly places a final kiss directly over Sherlock’s hole, feeling him shudder, and sits back on his heels.
- Sherlock has turned out to be one of the most profoundly sensual people John has ever known. Just as in day-to-day life, every one of his senses is turned up to 11, and he seems to want nothing more than to saturate all of them with John Watson.
John found he also couldn’t wait another second, and grabbed the lube from the table where he’d left it, and coated the fingers of his left hand with military efficiency. As he slid the first finger into Sherlock’s tight heat, he pressed his body forward to kiss Sherlock messily, and their cocks brushed together causing them both to moan. Sherlock panted into his mouth; hot, damp little breaths as John fingered him, soon drawing the first out completely to add another alongside it. After a couple of minutes Sherlock was rocking his hips, pressing down against John’s fingers, trying desperately to get John deeper inside him.
Sherlock now had one arm thrown up over his face, drawing in shaking breaths and moaning in time with John’s thrusts, “Ah, ah, ah… Ohh… Yes, yes, yes…” like a mantra. At John’s words he slid his other hand down onto his stomach and grasped his own cock, but didn’t begin to stroke immediately, just held it loosely in his fist.
Sherlock ensures he maintains eye-contact as he pulls his finger out, and pushes back in with his index and middle fingers together. John swears loudly and rips his shirt off over his head, only bothering with the top couple of buttons. Sherlock throws his head back and moans as he fucks himself – the angle is hard but his long fingers mean he can get in to the second knuckle and he thrusts them in and out, scissoring them and working himself open, already loose from the ministrations of John’s tongue.
Hope you enjoy the update, sorry it took a while!
Ah, so he’s in
his arse, it’s utterly magnificent, and just the feel of it in both his hands has him groaning aloud. He can’t help but slip a finger down between Sherlock’s cheeks to feel where he’s stretched around his cock, the delicate skin taut and twitching slightly with the effort of taking all of John in. The angle is all wrong, but John can’t help but just
“Fuck, Sherlock, so beautiful… So beautiful”
Sherlock’s back was sliding back and forth on the table as John fucked into him and he scrabbled for purchase on the table-top, sending papers flying everywhere. The legs of the table were scraping back and forth on the floor in an unmistakeable rhythm and again John distantly thought that he would have to invest in some earplugs for poor Mrs Hudson, but the thought evaporated instantly as Sherlock shouted, John’s cock nudging insistently at that sweet spot inside him. His cock was leaking onto his belly, a quivering strand of pre-come trailing from the tip to his shuddering stomach where his t-shirt had ridden up, and John knew he was close already.
“Have some of the pasta I’m making later as well and you’ve got yourself a deal”.
in me-”
Sherlock is lying spread out on the bed, naked apart from the long striped socks, dark curls fanned out on the pillow. His right leg is stretched out on the bed, his left hand holding his bent left leg, spreading  himself wide open. And with the middle finger of his right hand, he’s steadily fingering himself. His eyes are closed, brows ever so slightly furrowed in concentration, the little line between them appearing that John loves so much, and his mouth is hanging open. When he hears John enter the room he opens his eyes and stares at him hungrily, pupils big and black. He’s panting with effort and arousal.
“God, Sherlock, what I do to you? Look at you, what did I do to deserve you, you gorgeous creature. Come here”.
Thought I would post this note as a chapter as I know a few people have it bookmarked, I will delete this "Note Chapter" eventually once everyone has found it.
“You love it.”
room, John realises. Probably looking for rugby kit. He wiggles further down into the cushions with a sigh and listens to the kettle boiling, allowing himself to doze a little.
“You’re going to be the death of me Sherlock Holmes”. John shakes his head with amusement and gets off the bed with a groan. “Plus, we had a deal remember? I’m making pasta, and you’re going to eat some.”
The hot, damp air is filled with the sounds of their moaning; Sherlock's arse is so tight, and John's so big, and Sherlock tells him so in breathy gasps as he slides fingers and palms coated with oil across John's stomach, chest and then nipples, rubbing and pinching until John is whimpering and digging his short fingernails into the delicate skin of Sherlock's hips, where he is clutching at him desperately, panting as Sherlock's muscles clench rhythmically around him.
“John.”
“Powerful” John leans up to mouth at Sherlock’s ear, curling his tongue round his earlobe. “Fuckable”, He pulls it between his teeth to nibble on it gently, before he releases it and brushes his lips over the whorl of his ear, whispering directly into it with hot, damp breath:
“Yes John, oh god, yes, hnnn, you feel so – OH – fucking good inside me.”
Sherlock says nothing, but clasps his hands together in his thinking pose, as close as he gets to acquiescence.
! Fuckfuckfuck, God, so fucking
“Shh, it’s alright, I’ve got you… God Sherlock the state of you…”
Sherlock looked up from his microscope at the sound of John’s key in the front door downstairs and blinked a few times. He hadn’t realised he’d been at his experiment so long – it felt like John had only just left, dropping a kiss onto his mussed curls – but here he was back from rugby training, so it must have been at least two-and-a-half hours. His eyes did a feel a bit dry, now he thought about it. Dehydration. Boring. He noticed the full, forgotten cup of tea at his elbow, presumably left there by John at the same time as the kiss and glared at it, as though it deliberately mocked him. Grimacing, he drained it in one, surprisingly feeling marginally better for doing so.
Sherlock never answered, but moved aside to let John in.
“Jo…John,” he uttered, trying to keep the quivering need that had burst into his bloodstream, out of his voice. “This isn't...”
“Afghanistan or Iraq?”
They say time is infinite in its wisdom. Day turns to night; the moon revolves around the earth and sun and true love has a habit of coming back. When John woke in the early morning dawn sated and sore with Sherlock’s nude frame surrounding him, he knew he would never want anything else. He was finally home- they both were. It made John wonder if maybe they had been doing it wrong all these years. He softly chuckled as the thought made more and more sense. Soft black curls tickled his chin as Sherlock, whose brain seemed to capture the moment John was awake, stirred.
The paramedics worked quickly and efficiently and soon Sherlock was strapped down on the ambulance, ready to be taken to the hospital. Before John could say anything Lestrade had found out what hospital they were taking him to and carted John off to his car unceremoniously and followed the ambulance.
John had to find him.
"Of course," Molly replied, "I'll just leave it on the side when I'm done."
His breath came in quick succession and he had to concentrate in order to try to bring his heart rate back to normal. John seemed similarly affected, though not as intensely as Sherlock,
Sherlock craned his head up to meet John, their lips brushing softly before they went in for a kiss. Sherlock’s and John’s hands tightened together, John hugged him closer to his chest needing to feel his husband next to him.
"But you need your rest, I can come back another time."
The honesty in Sherlock's voice took John by surprise and for a few seconds he was left speechless. He'd harboured feelings for Sherlock for a long time, but he never thought that the detective had done the same for him. "I never knew," he whispered quietly.
"No, don't worry about me Mrs Hudson, I'm fine."
Even though John hadn't found Sherlock he decided to return home. He arrived back at Baker Street late at night after going out for dinner by himself. He didn't feel like cooking- didn't feel like doing much of anything- but he needed to eat something seeing as the only real meal he'd had all day had been his quick breakfast.
"Woah, Sherlock, stop shouting. What is it?"
Sherlock brought his own arms around John and started stroking slowly up and down his back. “For what?” he asked.
John walked out to the main flat, contentment written plainly on his features, until he was met with an unexpected visitor.
John unwrapped himself from Sherlock and yawned. He was still tired, and he knew Sherlock must be as well. Regardless of what he'd taken he hadn't slept properly for days and that must be taking its toll on him.
John’s head hung close to Sherlock’s, lingering closer and closer until he lay a quick kiss on the detective’s lips. “You okay?
John watched it all unfold in amazement. Sherlock had never looked so beautiful to him as he did now, completely stripped of the mask he wore on a daily basis. The look on his face was of pure and unabashed pleasure. And as he watched, he felt his own release building up until he could no longer hold back, and he came as well.
"I left Lestrade with him so I could freshen up a bit but I'm going back there soon."
John came downstairs in the morning to find Sherlock poring over a case file at his table.
There were cases that were easily solved after a few experiments and examinations, some that didn't even require them to leave the crime scene, but this one was not one of them. After identifying the suspect Sherlock and John had to chase him through street after street, using Sherlock's brilliant mind to cut him off, and then finally deliver him to Scotland Yard.
John sat up slightly, balancing himself on one elbow while he brought Sherlock down closer to him with the other. He kissed Sherlock, lightly at first, and then more passionately, pouring all the love and understanding and reassurance that he could into that kiss. Sherlock should know that John would never say no to him- to being with him- would never reject him. The thought was unfathomable.
Luckily John was released not long after and Lestrade drove them back to Baker Street.
"I was just enjoying the view," Sherlock replied before stepping into the shower and closing the curtain behind him. Once inside the shower John moved over so that Sherlock was underneath the spray of hot- or in Sherlock's assessment, scolding hot- water.
John then wrapped his legs around Sherlock's back and they both groaned as Sherlock entered John even more, his hips moving at a quicker pace now as John interlocked his ankles and met Sherlock's thrusts.
"You," Sherlock replied, "It's always you, John."
He dropped a soft kiss on the detective’s lips before lying down next to him on the bed. “You’ll be alright, just try to get some sleep.”
“No, I don’t.”
“Sherlock, just wait a minute.” John was trying not to lose his balance as he kicked the door shut, but Sherlock continued pushing them together.
“I don’t care,” Sherlock replied, “I want to go back to sleep. Give me back the sheets.”
As if on cue Anderson showed up, having clearly heard that small revelation Sherlock was trying to avoid. He sauntered over to where Sherlock, John and Lestrade were and addressed himself to John.
After having a shower and getting dressed he said goodbye to Sherlock, who was still staring intently at the case file, and left for work.
Clearly she understood that John needed some time alone and he was grateful. He didn't even wait to get dressed before sitting down and devouring the meal. He hadn't realized how hungry he was until the first forkful passed his lips and he marveled once again at Mrs Hudson's cooking.
"Alright, give me a minute!" John quickly slipped his jacket on and ran down the stairs to meet Sherlock who was already hailing a cab.
“Nothing’s wrong,” Sherlock reassured him, seeing John’s guarded expression. He took a seat next to him. “I just wanted to say thank you, for saving my life again.”
The sensation was overwhelming, just on the verge of too much. John had to very vehemently stop himself from coming. “If you want this to last more than a few seconds I would advise you not to do that again,” he warned breathily.
John smiled down at her, "Thank you, Mrs Hudson."
"I can't calm down, I need to do something." Sherlock finally took off his coat and scarf and threw them unceremoniously over his chair, then stalked off to his room. John didn't even have time to question what exactly he was doing when the detective came into the kitchen balancing his microscope dangerously with only one hand. He went to his room a few more times to retrieve microscope slides and other substances that John didn't want to think about.
There was something soft and warm pressed against him. He held on to it tightly, trying to ground himself, but he couldn’t discern what it was. Everything was fuzzy and the pain in his head only made it all the more difficult to understand what was going on.
The doctor shook his head and smiled lovingly down at Sherlock. "Absolutely nothing," he replied, "everything's perfect." He then reached across Sherlock, opened the bedside table drawer and removed something from within, which he then presented to Sherlock. "May I?"
"Enjoying that, are you?" Sherlock asked as he worked his finger in and out of John. He moved slowly- agonizingly slowly- until John had to keep pushing back to try to get more of him, but he kept pushing his finger back out of John's reach.
As Sherlock continued talking John felt a growing sense of affection for the detective. After everything they had been through already he never ceased to amaze him with how human he really was, how much he truly cared and how afraid he was to show it. John needed to show him that there was nothing to be afraid of; caring for other people was normal, sacrificing yourself for other people was admirable. In one of those rare shows of affection and his own leap of faith John pushed Sherlock carefully off of him and turned the detective so that they were facing each other.
John scoffed in disbelief, "Yeah, I can see that."
He unbuttoned Sherlock's trousers and tugged at him until he lifted his hips and allowed John to bring them all the way down and off, followed by his shoes and socks.
John laid a quick kiss on his lips. "Just go back to sleep, Sherlock."
"Nothing yet," Lestrade replied, and Mycroft sat down and waited with them.
Darkness surrounded him and he felt the comforting presence of the chair beneath him again and the warmth of something soft being carefully folded into his hands. Seconds later, or what he judged to be seconds later, he heard his name being called. He felt a warm pressure on his shoulder, shaking him, calling him. Another call of his name. Louder. More insistent. He suddenly sat up, snapped back into consciousness.
He laid a soft kiss on the detective's forehead before turning around to Lestrade, "Where the hell is that ambulance?"
"I do, don't I?” John said, looking down at the detective fondly. He lowered himself so that he could kiss Sherlock. It was one of his favourite things to do, along with cuddling up to Sherlock, tea and chasing criminals through the streets of London. Quite an odd list, but then he always thought normal was overrated.
“I thought we’d discussed this before. Whenever you feel a migraine coming on, you should tell me.” John got up from the sofa and dropped Sherlock down gently, careful not to aggravate his head further.
After a while John repositioned the ice pack, noting how still Sherlock was. He peered down through the detective's curls and saw that his eyes were closed and his breathing was even; he'd fallen asleep.
“Yes, you do,” Sherlock confirmed and slid one arm under John’s back and the other under his knees and, bringing himself to a standing position, carried a surprised John Watson up the stairs.
“Do you like it?” he asked hesitantly when Sherlock stood there gazing at the case.
"Best, Valentine's, ever," John groaned out between thrusts. He slowly removed his head from Sherlock's shoulder and kissed him, lips lingering for a long time, just moving slowly across Sherlock's while Sherlock moved inside him.
“Well, I have to keep things interesting, don’t I?” John teased. When Sherlock didn’t react he started getting worried. “Is everything alright, Sherlock? You’re asking weird questions and you’re strangely quiet.”
Sherlock sighed in resignation. It was clear that John was not going to let this go, and maybe he could get him through this. He knew if anyone could, it was John.
John smirked, pleased that he had been able to distract the great Sherlock Holmes. “Why don’t we go upstairs like I suggested earlier?”
John, deciding it was too early to try to go back to sleep again, simply spent the next few hours watching Sherlock peacefully asleep and running his hands through his hair. At about 8am Sherlock started stirring again and finally opened his eyes.
"No," Sherlock mumbled.
“Hm,” the detective murmured, “love you.”
He fell limply over Sherlock, both of them utterly spent and covered in sweat, but completely content.
“I guess I’m not a bachelor anymore.”
But Sherlock didn't seem to hear him. He was still thrashing in his sleep and now ran the risk of hurting John as well as himself. Sherlock was becoming hoarse from all the shouting and the sheets were getting more and more tangled around him. Short of throwing a bucket of cold water over him John was running out of options.
Sherlock did so and was rewarded with yet more pain across his ribs. "I thought this was supposed to get better with time," he winced.
A single word broke through John’s subconscious and his body reacted as it always did, whether he was awake or asleep; he obeyed.
"When can I go home?"
Sherlock had never been one for nightmares, luckily, but John knew exactly what it was like to wake up still feeling the remnants of the dream wrapped around you, unsure of what was real and what was not. “I’m right here, Sherlock, and I’m awake, see? I’m fine.”
"I knew you two would work things out sooner or later," he said with a smile on his face. It was clear he was happy for the two of them and John was glad for the support.
Sherlock closed his eyes and gulped, then nodded his consent.
"Of course. Thanks so much, Greg," John replied, earnestly. He always knew he could count on Lestrade, and was glad to have a friend by his side.
"I've got a case tomorrow," Sherlock said as he prepared his coffee.
It wasn’t long before neither of them could contain their pleasured moans so they kissed, and they kissed, mouths suppressing the noises that they couldn’t until finally they were both quiet, heaving messes on the sheets.
“What?” John asked, surprised and confused as to what Sherlock was talking about.
"Irrelevant." Sherlock remarked, before gathering the plates in the tray and carrying it all into the kitchen, but before he could make it to the door John interrupted him.
"Would you like some tea, dear?"
"Maybe I should bring him some case files to review."
Matt was packing up the last of their equipment, getting ready to help Lauren. He picked up the monitor and handed it to John. “Can you take this while we carry him down the stairs?”
John kept moving his fingers in and out, slowly working Sherlock until he was ready. It was clear after a while that what John was doing wasn't enough and Sherlock needed more. "John," Sherlock gasped, "I need you."
"So that's where all the food went!" John exclaimed.
He remembered meeting Sherlock for the first time at St. Bart's. He remembered dinner at Angelo's and his poor attempt at concealing his interest for the detective. He remembered running after a cab, his psychosomatic limp long forgotten, and he remembered laughing like he hadn't laughed in a very long time.
"There won't be a next time," John called from the door.
"I'll bring it up in half an hour," she shouted from her flat and John thought it best not to argue anymore. She had been worried sick as well. Mycroft had to be the one to tell Mrs Hudson what had happened because John hadn't had the heart to, not again. After Sherlock's death John had been the one to tell Mrs Hudson and he couldn't bring himself to inform her this time.
The next thing he knew something was being enclosed around his neck. There were hands gently touching him and he felt something rigid underneath him. The warmth was gone and he tried to protest, but his one feeble attempt was cut off by a bout of coughing which left him clutching at his chest and wheezing.
Sherlock was also painfully aware that Lestrade wanted to speak to him in private and was feeling slightly uneasy. He knew that what he'd said to John was a bit not good, but he just wanted to go home and spend time with John without having to worry about being surrounded by strangers asking probing questions about how he was feeling.
“Yeah, Sherlock’s asleep. What is it?”
"Perhaps you would like to change that," Sherlock said with a glint in his eye.
"Still asleep, but he's been stirring."
Sherlock gave him a radiant smile and pushed him to a standing position. Wordlessly they completed their nightly routine. The doors leading to the stairs were closed, the telly was turned off and they each got into their pyjamas before getting into bed.
"Yeah," Lestrade confirmed, "I just came to drop these off. I'm off now though."
“It’s a seven.”
He lay his head down on the pillow, Sherlock's dressing gown wrapped tightly around him, and drew the covers up and within a few short minutes was sound asleep.
“Right,” John nodded. He sat back on his heels and poured some lube onto one of his fingers. When Sherlock saw what he was doing he brought his knees up and spread his legs slightly but his knees were still joined.
“I don’t like surprises.”
But this time nothing was certain, and Sherlock might still make it. Mycroft would make sure that Sherlock got the best care possible; he had that power in his hands. Anything that Sherlock needed he would get, anything to save his life. He would be fine. They would all be fine.
"Well, the case isn't over yet so maybe you could bring him by again tomorrow, come with him to make sure he doesn't do anything stupid."
"Oh," he groaned, "that feels so good. You feel so good, Sherlock."
Sherlock let the words hang in the air for a moment. He knew that his reply was going to cause uproar, but he also knew that John knew him well enough not to expect Sherlock to back down.
Eventually John pulled away from Sherlock. Their breathing was rapid, their faces were flushed and their lips were swollen from the passionate kisses but they both had smiles on their faces. And right then, in that moment, they didn't need anything else in the world to be happy.
“This is… acceptable to you then?”
that he’s moving like that because he got fucked into next week, by John no less. He loves the idea of every twinge of discomfort reminding him of John’s cock inside him, making him
- aspect of their relationship, and they’re still feeling their way around each other, working out how far they can push. John is amazed at the change wrought in Sherlock once they finally stopped dancing round each other and admitted they were both idiots. So much for it all being
“Fuck, Sherlock, you’re going to kill me” He moans between kisses. He grabs the lube from next to Sherlock’s hip and moves to coat his own fingers with it but Sherlock shakes his head, pulling his fingers out and grabbing the bottle from John.
“Yes”.
He releases his grip on the headboard with one hand and begins to pump his hard, weeping cock desperately.
John takes advantage of the freedom of his arms and slides his hands up from Sherlock’s hips and around to his beautiful, round arse. John fucking
The following morning, Sherlock is lying draped across the sofa in a fresh set of pyjamas and a dressing gown, head in John’s lap, batting at the newspaper that John’s got spread across the arm of the sofa like an overgrown cat.  John steadfastly ignores him and takes a determined drink of his tea, balancing a piece of toast between the thumb and index finger of his right hand and turning the page with his little finger.
John felt Sherlock’s strong arms grip him tighter, surrounding him in warmth.
The second time those words were uttered, several years had passed. They say you never forget your first love. That the memory of it lives somewhere deep in your heart unable to be touched or for that matter be surpassed.
“No.”
while ordering them both more drinks. After returning to the flat, they sat in their old chairs surrounded by a haze of memories, said and unsaid. With each passing moment, the air became thick with the sense of ‘something’. Feelings hidden but not forgotten clouded John’s vision. And when John looked at Sherlock, he saw the man he had fallen in love with; the man he knew he was still in love with. Sherlock smiled and moved in close. John followed suit. Somewhere inside of him, his brain was screaming that this was wrong; to remember Mary. But John knew, in this moment he would gladly be a bastard to have
“You're different,” Sherlock mentioned while pushing food around his plate.
! John hadn't meant to blurt it out. Quickly, he turned to face the man he loved with all his heart. “Sherlock...”  He reached out to grasp Sherlock’s chin, hoping to ease the rest of the conversation, but he could see that Sherlock was already lost to him as he shrunk away from John’s touch.
“Or you could assist me. I must warn you though, it could be dangerous.”
When the mop of inky curls raised up from the microscope, John gasped, then attempted to cover his outburst with a small cough. He would never forget the eyes that once looked at him with tenderness and love. And for a moment he felt like he was twenty years old, when he met the new student and lab partner Sherlock Holmes for the first time.
“Hmm?”
It wasn't until John emerged from the pool with semtex strapped to his person that those things unspoken and hidden bubbled up to the surface. John was a soldier; he walked into battle after battle prepared to die if necessary for Queen and Country. That day, he was willing to do it for Sherlock if it meant the man could live. But fate didn't call their number that night. And as Sherlock stripped him of the trap, all the while checking to see if he was okay, John once again remembered how they once were.
went unsaid, but heavily implied.
“I don't understand,” Sherlock blinked over and over, apparently replaying John’s last few words. “People in war get shot, John; soldiers die and don't come home. Why would you think so little of yourself… ”
Sherlock frowned. “Not my area.” The
“Come back to me,” he managed to choke out, before managing a weak smile.
“And I her.”
“Well, we weren't dancing a waltz then,” he answered casually (or at least he hoped he did).
John shrugged.
“So, you’re staying then?” Sherlock asked, appearing to read John’s mind.
“You know how to waltz?”
“Marry me.”
It took everything in John not to run after the lanky figure who was making quick work of exiting his dorm room- the bastard. But there, in that moment, he didn't know what else to do. After a fitful night with too many tears and too little sleep, John made a decision. Before the sun was even fully risen, he stood outside Sherlock’s door, dressed in his best pair of trousers and button-down shirt. In his hand was a promise, a wish and a prayer all wrapped up in a single question. Before he could knock, the door swung open. Sherlock was dressed in a crumpled t-shirt and pajama bottoms. It was clear that he hadn't slept either.
“They do little else,” Sherlock smiled.
“People will talk.”
“Right then,” John whispered to the empty room.  His feet began to move without thought. As he reached the door, he heard the familiar deep baritone one last time.
It wasn’t perfect. Hell, some days it wasn’t even good, with experiments and body parts consuming almost every available space of their flat. They solved crimes, they went on adventures, and that was damn near perfect. But on a personal front, John and Sherlock remained distant. They both seemed to accept the fact that they would be nothing more than friends. Although the more accurate description was that they both chose to ignore, if not flat out deny the possibility that they still had feelings from themselves and each other. John told everyone that he wasn't gay as to not “out” Sherlock and began to date -  trying to replace the emptiness with soft curves and breasts. While Sherlock remained aloof and unapproachable as ever. He threw himself into every situation, dangerous or not, to keep the status quo.
Sherlock smiled, and pulled John back into him, rubbing his chin against John’s cheek. “I don't care,” he whispered huskily. “Besides, people do little else.”
“You came back.”
Sherlock, having heard the unspoken answer, swept out of the room.
Rising from the ashes, is the birth of a love hidden, so deep in the shadows, the world had to burn down to free it. And burn it did
They didn't speak of it. Like so many other things, it would become a secret they kept from each other and the rest of the world. But secrets have a way of getting out - even those kept hidden in the shadows.
come back to you.”
It wasn't until they were both safely behind the doors of 221B Baker Street, that Sherlock let the facade go.
“Don't be ridiculous, John. You know I’d be lost without my blogger.”
“John, I love you.”
“Boyfriend then? I mean, it's fine you know,” John stuttered.
“Please,” Sherlock rolled up into John’s body and John couldn't stop the moan that fell from his lips.
“What I did while you were… away”, he spat, “...is no concern of yours.”
“Or what?”
“I thought..I never once believed…”
Undaunted, John continued. “Maybe, but what about someone else, hm? Your family. Maybe a girlfriend?” John doubted that Sherlock would have begun dating women, but decided it was best not to assume.
“Just do it,” he interrupted, not liking where that statement was going.
“You are the man she believed you to be John. You are kind, and generous and everything I am not. You do not need to…”
Sherlock’s eyes grew momentarily wide before squinting into the familiar gaze of scrutiny. John knew he was being deduced, his actions and inactions being deduced one by one, but he had nothing else to hide. This was his heart and he was handing it over to Sherlock to do with it what he pleased. He closed his eyes and waited.
Sherlock smiled briefly and held his arms out. “We’ll start in the standard position.”
“Suits you. Although you could stand to care more for yourself. Have a proper meal more often, not do… things that hurt you.” John’s eyes glanced down to the arms now hidden inside coat sleeves. John remembered catching glimpses of scars that hinted of past drug use when they were in the lab.
“You have 4 minutes and 27 seconds. I suggest you get on with it.”
As John stood suspended in a well of rising water, all he could think about were the choices he had made over the years. He regretted only a few. Becoming a doctor and a soldier? John would do it all again in a heartbeat. Loving Sherlock? John would most definitely do again; and for all time, if he could. Not fighting for them to be together when he had chance after chance after chance? That, he would regret forever, however long that would be. As a doctor, he knew the signs of hypothermia and shock. His limbs felt heavy, and he closed his eyes. When he heard Sherlock’s frantic baritone calling out to him to hang on from above, John wanted to believe he would be saved in time, that he had yet been given one more chance. But there are only so many times one could cheat death. For a second he was no longer cold, and somewhere in the back of his addled brain, John knew he was either at the last moments of his life or someone was with him.
? As if he had spoken the question out loud, Sherlock cut his eyes briefly to Mike and then returned John’s gaze, raising one brow.
Friends came by to check on him, Mrs. Hudson fretted, even Mycroft would occasionally find his way along John’s route by “coincidence”. As if Sherlock didn't already teach him there was no such thing as coincidence. Hours, days, weeks, they didn't register. The truth was that the only time John felt anything was when he was staring at Sherlock’s tombstone and then it was sorrow.
“I know it's fine. Since you seem to insist on this line of questioning, I consider myself married to my work.”
“John, I never want us to be…”
“True. True. Well, come on then. I will show you.”
From that moment on, incidental touches started to linger for moments longer than necessary. Secret smiles and shared looks graced their features more frequently. If John didn't know any better he would say they were starting over. It wasn’t until they were deep within Moriarty’s game, that things come to a head. John watched in horror as Sherlock stood on the edge of the roof, told John to watch him, to be his note, then said goodbye and fell. As John rushed and saw Sherlock’s body broken and crumbled, surrounded by a pool a blood he couldn't help but remember that morning or maybe late the night before, when he thought he was just having another strange dream. John was sleeping heavily when his bed dipped and a long lanky body curled into his and enveloped him. A brief kiss at the nape of John’s neck came next, followed by the words whispered in a sorrowful sigh.
