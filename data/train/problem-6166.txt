The punch, with all her weight and considerable strength behind it, landed with twin cracks of her wrist and, she assumed, his face, but it was well worth it when he hit the floor. He curled into a ball, alternating between swearing at her and groaning in pain, but none of it eased the blaze of her temper. She leaned down, grabbing his collar with her good hand and yanking him up with a power she hadn’t known she possessed.
She demonstrated her acceptance by forcing herself to remain still as he worked her, thumb swiping over her clit on every other stroke. Two fingers became three, stretching her carefully but thoroughly, and just before she could start to beg him, Steve withdrew his fingers entirely. Another quick yank tore the lacy garment right off her body and Toni spread her legs a little wider in wordless compliance, to accommodate Steve’s broad build.
Steve followed behind Toni and Peter with the helplessness of a man who knew he had irrevocably hurt the woman he loved, but was at a loss on how to fix it. When Toni had flinched away from his arms, it had destroyed him even worse than Peter’s tears or his rebuke, because the thought of her fearing him was worse than anything Steve had ever faced.
Steve told her softly, love and softness in his voice that suddenly seemed like enough to fight against her current situation.
So, without letting himself think long enough to back down, Steve blurted out, “I do when I’m half out of my mind with jealousy.”
. But damn if each syllable didn’t form perfectly around the inventor’s lips. “Come on, talk to me. I’m worried.”
“What do you need, doll?” he encouraged her, nuzzling into Toni’s neck. “Jus’ tell me, darlin’, I’ll make you feel so good.” The promise was whispered with delicious intent, and who was she to deny him?
“Oh, all the time,” he eventually answered, ignoring the shouting and chaos around him as his fellow rescuers worked double time to rig the safety harness for them. Tears dripped from his eyes but Steve couldn’t have cared less if he’d tried. “Jus’ been waitin’ for some beautiful brunette to come around and take my breath away.”
From the looks that Rogers and Barnes and Banner exchanged, Jim wondered whether he wanted to hear the answer.
“Stop,” he rasped, the sound more of a groan than anything else. In a quick movement, because he wasn’t sure he’d be able to stop if he didn’t do it now, he manacled her wrists with his hands and pinned them behind her back. The action pushed her sinfully closer to him, making Steve growl slightly in equal parts desire and frustration, but it served its purpose as Toni blinked away the haze that had coloured her eyes a sexy shade of dark hazel.
Finally, she ventured cautiously, “What if I hang back? No more Iron Man, except on the rare emergency occasion, until I can figure out a viable substitute for a palladium core?”
Steve swallowed, guilt at his previous thoughts making him wince internally. Intellectually, he knew that he wasn’t grudging the woman her son’s life – only lamenting and fearing for his lover’s – but he couldn’t help feeling like he was letting Toni down with his thoughts. Toni, who had the heart of a hero and a mother, and still found the strength to stand against the people who believed otherwise.
Not for the first time, Steve considered the family they’d patchworked together since the Chitauri invasion, and the battle that had almost cost him the best thing this life would ever give him. It had been Bruce, not him, that had been the first to move in with Toni, although she’d already designed a floor for them all by then. Some might have called it preemptive of her – others, presumptuous, even – but in retrospect, Steve could only think of it as deeply insightful. In the same way that she’d known Bruce would return to the battle in New York even after the disaster on the helicarrier, Toni had also known that each of them would find their way to the newly-christened Avengers Tower when they realized that they needed a safe space to call home.
Biting her lip to suppress the laugh that was bubbling in her throat, because Toni just knew there would be a hint of hysteria in there, she managed to drawl back, “Listen, Featherbutt, if you try to teach him how to shoot an arrow again, I’m not gonna stop Steve from scalping you with a spork.”
“You came back, you came home,” he babbled through tears, almost incoherently, and if anything was clear it was that their best attempts to protect him from this incident had failed abysmally. Peter spoke in stops and starts, breaths hitching uncontrollably with his tears. “I thought you were gonna be gone
She’d been confused, at first, not knowing what she’d been meant to see. But as she always had, she’d listened, eager to please and hoping with all the desperation of an innocent mind that she might gain some measure of approval and respect if she could just do what he was asking of her.
Toni was okay. She was safe, for the moment, and she would stay that way. If HYDRA attacked, there were plenty of ways for her to deflect without confronting them, until backup arrived. She was smart and resourceful and armed with no shortage of ways to wreak havoc.
Around them, the fighting had stopped, the blue creatures defeated. Steve could spot some of the team in position, ready to take whatever shot opened up as soon as it did.
Without giving him a chance to protest, she donned her helmet again and shot out of the plane, making Steve’s stomach lurch unpleasantly when he realized how close to the missiles she was going to be. Seconds passed like lifetimes as he watched the screen in front of him, heart beating a little easier when one by one, the red missiles turned grey before his eyes.
Pushing away the guilt, Toni made her voice light and playful. “Just my ego, Legolas. The kid I’m with is wearing a t-shirt with Big Green on it.”
In a move that would have bugged Tony’s eyes out if he were any less absorbed with situational concentration, Bucky inched in front of him, putting himself between Tony and Steve in what could easily be mistaken as a protective stance.
The supersoldier must have been right on the edge with her, or perhaps it simply went against Steve’s nature to deny her pleas, because that was all it took before he grabbed her thighs and dragged her closer, slamming into her with a rough snap of his hips. Balancing himself with his hand pressed to the mattress near her head, Steve loomed over her, his body completely covering her as he continued to fuck into her with the desperation and need of a man starved. The edge of roughness was smoothed out by the protective way in which Steve held her; as if, after all this time, he still needed to remind her that she would always be safe with him, even in the throes of both their lust-filled hazes.
Her vision blurred and for the first time in forever, she gave into the tears that were pooling in her big brown eyes. They slipped down her cheeks unchecked as she clutched her arms around herself, as though it were the only thing keeping her together.
Tony wasn’t sure whether Barnes was commenting or asking for confirmation, but he nodded anyway, not sparing a glance for the medic (Banner something?) that was stitching him up. “How do you think someone can design a weapon if they haven’t discharged one?” he asked rhetorically, and in case that didn’t make his point, he added, “I was going to a shooting range before I was going to a school.”
Casting a fond gaze at the playing child, he nodded, dragging his focus back to Bucky’s question. “We were worried, but he’s been alright,” Steve confirmed with no small measure of relief. This had been the first time in the two and a half years they’d had him, that Toni absolutely couldn’t get out of leaving, and also couldn’t make the arrangements to take them with. She’d had to leave at an hour’s notice in the middle of the night and there just hadn’t been time, but Peter had adjusted like a champ. “He misses her, of course,” the super soldier added, with the air of one stating the obvious. “Gets a little sad after talking to her, and he’s been bunking in our room instead of his own. But for the most part, he’s been okay.” Honestly, it had been better than they’d been expecting.
“What are you thinking, sweetheart?” Rogers asked, and as much as Jim was still sure that he didn’t deserve Toni, there was no denying how much the Captain was struggling in that moment. He usually steered clear of pet names on the field, but the fact that he was using them now meant that he wasn’t thinking like the tactician he was. He was thinking like a boyfriend.
Rogers didn’t bother to repeat himself or check if anyone had any questions or protests; only turned on his heel and dug right back into the destruction; but Jim didn’t hold that one against him. Time was of the essence, now; Toni had been stuck down there for twelve hours, by the estimate his suit was giving him, and even at full health, that was eleven hours and 59 minutes too long.
“You’re early,” she quipped as she threw open her door at Steve’s knock. She sent him a dazzling smile. “I would’ve thought you and Bucky would close down the bar tonight. Not that I’m complaining, of course, that would jus-
Of course, he’d been right on both counts. Toni and Steve had gotten together in spectacular fashions and epic proportions, and later, the once purportedly cold and immovable Toni Stark had been bowled over by the little boy that she claimed as her own son. Hawkeye really never missed a trick, but unfortunately, for as fantastic as his vision was, Clint didn’t have the ability to peer into the future.
“Please.” He snorted scornfully, barely sparing her a glance before he began to take in her tech. “Even if the technology was at my disposal in my time, I’d hardly think any of your half-baked ideas worth pilfering, Antonietta.”
As Toni pretended to shuffle around, Steve caught the barely-there flicker of her lips, and amusement assaulted him again. Anyone who only knew the public persona of Antonietta Stark, would never have guessed that she’d have been sensitive enough to indulge a little kid’s quest to stealthily bring her breakfast in bed. Hell, Steve himself might not have guessed it, if not for the ways he’d seen Toni defy all expectation when it came to the kid.
, he thought to himself, smiling as Toni complained lightly about helmet hair even as she pulled his spare one over her head.
Bruce made his apologies almost immediately; and judging from the scene in front of them, it was for the best. The Hulk wasn’t needed after this level of brutal destruction, and it was a safer bet to have the scientist remain in the jet until such time that they might have needed him. Somewhere to his left, Clint muttered an oath, but any horror or disgust over the sight in front of them was noticeably absent from every Avenger. If Steve was a betting man, he’d have put money on the fact that they were all wishing they could’ve had a hand in it; could’ve doled out some of their own revenge on the ones who’d made a move against one of theirs. Their most innocent and defenseless, no less.
Steve digested all this, his mind automatically visualizing just what she was suggesting, before a little smile played on his lips. “Like a shield?” he asked, holding his forearm up in the same way he would have with his costume shield attached in the show.
On the one hand, it was typical behavior for the Lieutenant Colonel to throw things at him in the hopes that he wouldn’t dodge or catch it in time. On the other, Steve mused as he cracked the bottle and sucked down half its contents in a single gulp, it was entirely unlike the man to get him a water just because the sun was reaching its peak and beating down on them, and Steve had been like a man possessed for the past few hours, alternately digging and dragging Bruce over for an echo image to check their progress.
For all their banter, Toni had enough experience to tell when some of the darkness was ebbing closer to the edges of Bucky’s mind, and this was one of those times. It wasn’t unusual, as the supersoldier tended to shoulder guilt in any form when one of them got hurt, even more so with Steve and Toni, and long ago, the genius had resolved to keep him out of that dark space. She knew all too well what it was like to carry blame on one’s shoulders; it was a toxic thing that could just as easily break a person as a physical blow could.
“I’ll just see her tomorrow, then,” he nodded, giving Peggy a small smile that he hoped conveyed some of the regret he felt for hurting her, intentional or not.
And really, hadn’t her inherent desire not to disappoint, kind of given way to her innate recklessness in the first place?
His thoughts were a dangerous thing to get lost in during this time, so Thor strove to keep his mind alert and positive. It wasn’t altogether an easy task, even despite his generally sunny disposition, because for all that he was what many would call undyingly optimistic, the Thunder God was still a warrior. A warrior who had lived a great deal longer than most and who had seen horrors stretching from all ends of Yggdrasill. Thor had seen the best of every realm and the worst as well, and he had seen the mightiest warriors felled by a greater foe than any.
“Shh, honey, it’s okay, you’re okay,” Toni cooed soothingly, rocking Peter in her arms while steadily ignoring the throb in her wrist. She’d been comforting him for the better part of twenty minutes, but the child still refused to loosen his grip around her, or even lift his head long enough to look at her. “I’m here, I got you… c’mon, sweet pea.”
His first indicator that he might have been wrong about Stark, came right about the same time that he threw himself over a grenade with the unthinking hope that he could smother the blast enough to spare his fellow soldiers.
Steve’s soft voice had the instantaneous reaction of soothing her, like a wave of calm descending upon her. JARVIS must have alerted the Captain before patching her through, and Toni was grateful because she wasn’t sure she could have started the conversation this time around.
A much quicker update than last time, because I had to get this out in time to say HAPPY BIRTHDAY TONY STARK! :D
The clarity came with the suddenness of a rubber band snapping into place. Shoving off the hand (green-tinted, didn’t escape his notice) that was reaching out to steady him, Steve brushed past Bruce and Nat to grab his phone back from Bucky.
Still, not any amount of bracing could have stopped her knees from almost buckling when she realized just why they’d been called in.
Blinking against the harsh light as the cloth finally slipped away, Tony swallowed a sigh of relief at having his sight returned. As he’d imagined, all three goons were flanking Slime Man, none of them paying him an iota of attention. Not that he could really blame them, since a livid Steve Rogers was a sight people generally didn’t want to take their eyes off of, if only to avoid being trampled in his rage path when he unleashed it. Nobody was aiming a gun at Steve anymore, which was a relief, but Tony didn’t entertain the illusion that any of them were unarmed.
“Alright, semantics behind JARVIS aside,” Steve held up a hand, hoping to preempt any questions. Toni could just damn well answer them herself when she was safe. “Why hasn’t she connected back to us?”
She was almost home and away, when Fury’s clipped voice reached them from the other end of the hall. “Stark.”
“My mom.” Steve had expected the answer, but he stayed quiet, sensing that his beautiful genius had something to say. Sure enough, Toni cleared her throat slightly and continued, “She used to call me sweet pea when I was a little girl. It slipped out with Peter, and he thought it was because of his name, so I just never mentioned it.” She hesitated for a second, before blurting out, “But I’m still a Stark, Steve, and that in itself is toxic. What if I do screw him up? What if my dad was right abou-…”
“What is the matter with you?” Steve finally managed to splutter, after three failed tries at forming words to express his vexation. Toni seemed genuinely undisturbed by her own disregard for pain, and the soldier wasn’t sure whether he was more worried about that, or the bullet that had torn a gash through her side.
That being said… “Not again,” he shook his head, voice little more than a deep rumble. Before she could rebuff against his words, as he knew she would, he added, “Please, Toni. Please don’t. I can’t handle having you in the suit and knowing that it’s slowly… that it’s…” he couldn’t bring himself to even utter the words.
Peter stirred briefly when she laid him on the bed; instinctively, Toni lowered herself on to the bed as well, and a gentle kiss to the forehead combined with the soft Italian lullaby that she remembered her mother singing to her many years ago was enough to soothe him back into sleep.
Sure, the man was using really small words and talking to him as though he were a dim-witted child, but sheer incredulity made it difficult for Tony to accept any of it. His boyfriend; his Steve; the love of his goddamn life; was
At the time, she had resented him for doing something akin to what her father had done to her for the first 17 years of her life. That was okay, though, the resentment, because Toni was pretty sure that Steve had resented her right back for not being the last link to his past, as he might’ve hoped she would be.
“Oh, look!” A sleazy voice called out, and Tony had to wonder to himself whether people had to meet a certain criteria of having slimy sounding voices in order to be a bad guy. And if so, who would conduct that interview? Before he could think any longer on it, the voice was continuing, “We have a guest. Say hello, Captain.”
Lining himself up, Steve bent to capture her lips in a deep kiss at the same time that he pushed forward. Toni whimpered helplessly against his mouth, the blood in her veins bubbling with the scorching pleasure of being filled by her lover again. Steve stilled inside her, giving her a chance as he always did to adjust to the fullness, and after a few moments, Toni rocked against him in a wordless go-ahead.
“We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn,” Howard was saying, casting a speculative look over Steve that made him equally self-conscious and annoyed for it. “But we’re ready. As we’ll ever be.”
Steve wanted to lunge for the man; wanted to demand to know why today, of all days, Rhodes was putting his safety above Toni’s; but he was intercepted by Bucky grabbing his biceps and shaking him once, forcing him to look at the brunet.
A few hours later, when Bucky and him had been properly treated and fed and his best friend was knocked out for the night, Steve ventured out of their shared tent. It didn’t surprise him this time, when he landed up back in front of Stark’s tent, but unlike Peggy and Bucky, he made an attempt to announce his arrival.
“My sensors indicate that the Captain has arrived, along with Dr. Banner and Sergeant Barnes,” JARVIS reported dutifully, although Toni could have sworn that she heard a hint of relief in his voice. “I have also received communication indicating that Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes will be arriving shortly.”
“You don’t know Howard, Steve,” Peggy interrupted him, not unkindly. She patted his arm consolingly, and Steve was too immersed in his righteous indignation for Toni to realize that the touch didn’t fluster him as he thought it would have. “Let her deal with him. She knows how to.”
She started to open her mouth, a resigned look in her eyes that told Steve she was conceding to his request, when someone yelled his name.
When he was close, he bent to capture her lips with his once more. “I love you, sweetheart,” he breathed between kisses, feeling like nothing was more important than her knowing that in this moment. “I love you, I love you so damn much.”
She nodded once, schooling her features as she did every time he had to leave. “Try not to do anything stupid, please?” Toni deliberately made her voice flippant and indifferent. “I have no interest in taking time off work to bail your ass out of trouble.”
She’d made it clear right from the off that she was completely unafraid of him; something which Bruce couldn’t have imagined being gifted with in a thousand lifetimes of being the Hulk. She’d forced him to embrace the side of himself that he hated by treating him the same way she would a friend. A brother. By treating the Other Guy in the same way. The first time he’d Hulked out accidentally in front of her, a couple weeks after the battle with Loki, she’d simply sighed and rolled her eyes at the subsequent destruction in the lab before going right up to the Hulk and introducing herself.
He might have been a little choked up, but as she always did, Toni made it better. “Hey, sexy,” she called up, voice croaky and hoarse and weak, but blessedly vibrant with life. “You come here often?”
In an instant, the expressive features closed down into a carefully arranged mask of disdain and cool irritability. If Steve hadn’t been so sure of what he saw, he would have bought right into Stark’s well-practiced cover.
Even in the early stages of her assignment, well before she got the chance to examine Stark and attempt to peel back all the multiple layers that even surpassed Natasha’s own, the redhead had recognized a kindred spirit in Antonietta Stark. Where she had been trained by ruthless mercenaries into their own little pet assassin, Toni had been trained into the heir of Stark Industries by a man whose only love, reportedly, had been himself and his booze. In some ways, Toni had had it worse than she, brought up in an environment with the illusion of safety and no way of telling the difference between reality and the front put up for the rest of the world, outside of figuring it out herself.
Nodding silently, not trusting her words, Toni hoped that Thor understood how much his words meant to her. How happy she was to be home, to have survived to come back to them.
All things considered, she’d let it go for a little while. Just long enough for everyone’s fears to ebb away.
“It’s my pleasure,” the British agent replied, smiling softly at him, although Steve was a bit preoccupied to fully appreciate it. Now that he was pretty sure he didn’t hate Toni, and thought that she might actually be among his friends, he had a self-imposed duty to make sure that Bucky didn’t go all… well, Bucky, on her. He loved his best friend like a brother, but the man was inordinately incapable of being in a relationship without breaking his partner’s heart before moving on to the next dame. He couldn’t call himself a friend if he allowed that to happen to Toni without trying to warn her.
As she’d intended, her words elicited a bark of laughter from Barton. She knew that the man wouldn’t be fooled into thinking that she was completely unhurt, but that wasn’t the point; all he’d needed to know was that she was still fighting. And she was showing him that she was.
Taking a small, ragged breath, she continued her story. “The bomb… there were pieces of shrapnel that lodged into my chest. When the enemy side saw that they hadn’t killed me, they decided to capitalize on the situation and got one of their scientists to operate on me. They put a car battery in my chest to keep the shrapnel from slicing into my heart, and it kept me alive long enough for them to demand that I help build them weapons. I refused, for a while, but they were very… persuasive.” Something inside Steve lurched with comprehension as he realized what she was alluding to. His insides trembled violently, wrought with fear and fury as he contemplated how close he’d come to never knowing Toni at all. How much horror she’d had to face to still be here today. “Eventually, I pretended to agree, and I used the materials that they gave me to create an ark reactor. It’s a power source that keeps the shrapnel away from my heart without all the wires and dangers of a car battery.”
?” he asked incredulously, unable to wrap his mind around the fact that someone was – insane? Brave? Both? – enough to follow him into the belly of the beast with nothing more to go on than his word. When all this was over, he owed the guy drinks for the rest of his life.
“I know. Tanaka said as much. It’s a bad idea to dump that responsibility on someone else.” Bucky shakes his head. “I should be happy enough with what he’s given me but I want - “ he comes up short with a thousand-yard stare. “I just want to know that he’s okay. That I didn’t ruin his life the first time ‘round. Or when I came back.”
“Dammit, Tony.” Steve rubs his eyes with his palms because Stark being afraid of apologies is just one more of those things.
The hope in Steve’s smile fades when she doesn’t respond. He knows Natasha has never wanted this. She has always preferred the outsider’s role, keeping herself aloof and apart. He tries not to notice how she steers them back inside before he can say anything else.
Stark throws his hands up. “- well, far be it from me to argue with you about the morality of taking fucking advantage - ”
He holds her pale hand and tries not to think of how inadequate it is. He’s not a doctor. The only way he could have helped was to be there and he wasn’t. Air superiority and range weapons are the new Avengers advantages but it means Natasha is stranded on the ground with whatever local military and no one to watch her back.
This was an experiment with tropes I could never really get behind, mainly: omegaverse, fluffy Medieval AUs, we-were-married-in-a-different-universe, pregnancy-fic, and soulmate-bonding. I wrote this because any one of those could go horribly wrong. Really, really wrong. I'm not particularly happy with it but it needs to be done now. It was an exercise in writing an atypical reaction to trauma and I think it works as that. Do not take anything in this story as instructions on how to navigate a similar real-life scenario. Neither Tony nor Steve handle the situation well. Also, I'm sorry about what I did to Peter.
Tony is alive. Howard is dead. Bucky isn’t familiar enough with either of them to know more, so the obvious binary will do.
He draws. Not from imagination but from memory. He sketches out lines in soft pencil, ripping the pages out and starting afresh as soon as the line starts to deviate from truth. He wastes dozens of sheets on perfectly serviceable outlines: too elegant, too staged, too beautiful. Editorializing in image is Steve’s old-fashioned, low-tech version of BARF: massaging the ugliness of his memories into something more palatable, something kinder.
Tony smiled wanly. “You've been good to me. Too good for how I've treated you, probably. Bruce thinks you’re having a sympathetic response to the broken bond and the fact I had a tagalong with your DNA." Steve hated the dismissal of their connection as biology. "It should degrade as I go through withdrawal so if you feel a resurgence in your desire to hit me, you’re right on track.”
When Steve doesn’t move Tony pulls off his sunglasses and slides into the booth opposite him. The waitress reappears and while Steve flew under her radar she definitely recognizes Tony Stark.
Steve’s ears are filled by a dull roar and Tony grins wider. It’s the exact reaction he was aiming to induce.
Steve grinds his teeth. FRIDAY hasn’t given any indication she’s heard his alert. Vision and the night staff haven’t come running. No alarms have gone off. Who knows if Natasha or Tony are even in the building. The smart thing to do would be to march the stranger straight down into the Avengers active area but in a stunning display of shooting themselves in the foot, Steve no longer has access to that part of the Compound between the hours of 11pm and 5am.
February in the Midwest was barren. Interstate trucking compacted the snowfall into heavy slush. Dirty spray stuck to wheel wells until dipping temperatures froze them into stalactites. Instead of fluffy flakes, the snow fell in whipping icicles that drove into skin like needles.
Tony’s lips quirked. “You are severely underestimating how much the Captain hated his Stark. Take the worst feelings you’ve ever had towards me and multiply that by about a dozen bodies.”
Francesca looks over. “Don’t dwell on it, morning glories are annuals. I’ll have to plant them again next spring anyway.”
She hasn’t answered his original question and her forthright stare dares him to ask again. “Trust me, Steve. Don’t wait up.”
It was Strange’s turn to avoid a direct answer. “He told me you were struggling after your experience in the Ether.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve said and Tony’s gaze shot up. Steve reached out cautiously and stroked the soft skin of Tony’s injured wrist. It was meant to be comforting. “I didn’t mean to hurt you. I just don’t like this place and this thing reminded me...“ Steve stared up at the memorial. “I can’t lose you.”
Steve felt a surge of unbearable frustration before he dropped Tony to the floor and stepped back. Tony just flashed a cocky grin like he’d known exactly the magic words Steve couldn’t ignore. Steve knew he’d failed this test and he felt the embarrassment climb to his face in a flush. He left Tony to his victory in a pile on the floor. He didn’t look back.
It’s strange, Steve hadn’t spared a thought for Tony when he left but now here he is, in all his contradictory glory: ratty T-shirt and jeans with thousand dollar sunglasses and a hundred-thousand dollar car. The feeling it induces is nearly fond instead of exasperated. Already Tony has begun to fade into memory, the prickles smoothed over in nostalgia.
“‘Cause you don’t look great,” Sam continues. “I mean beyond your freakish figure you seem…” he shrugs without finishing. “Does Stark let you actually do anything around here?”
This isn’t seduction, this is something worse. It itches under Steve’s skin just the same. His eyes track over tan, scarred, blank skin but he keeps his distance. Tony huffs and walks up to him with characteristic overconfidence bordering on the suicidal. Like Steve couldn’t crush him and hasn’t before.
The cold found every crack in Steve’s armour. The line of his wrist between glove and coat; the tips of his ears; his cheeks where tears dried slowly, taking heat and sorrows with them.
He strains against every instinct in his body that’s screaming to just drag Tony away from the drop. He makes himself use words instead. “Come back from the edge.”
Steve hasn’t come by since the typhoon incident and his heart sinks because Bucky shouldn’t have to wait on him anymore. “That why you’re not wearing the arm?”
“That’s what I said. Don’t know if the paranoid bastard believed me. He has me lumped in with you and Natasha so my credibility is shot on that front. I don’t know if it’s worse that he thinks I walk lock-step with whatever you decide or that he’s spent a year believing I sent him to Siberia to watch a video of his mother die on purpose.”
“That’s… good.” Sam grabs two cans of lemonade instead and tosses one to Steve. “How long’s it been?”
Steve pretends he’s speaking to an empty room. “Helping people. I just want to help.” It’s so simple and it’s cost him so much.
Tony is not Steve’s responsibility, or his colleague, or his confidante. He’s not even sure they’re friends, but they used to be. It’s enough. Steve wanders over and collapses into the pink lawn chair. The polyester fabric strains under his weight. He grabs the whisky and takes two long slugs straight from the bottle.
This started out as an experiment with opacity. I wanted to write a story from the viewpoint of a character who was stuck, literally and metaphorically. My Steve's not the most well-informed or emotionally perceptive person. He's hyperfocused on certain subjects and very passive in others. His reactions to Tony, the Accords and/or the future do not reflect my own, nor am I putting them forth as correct. Adherence to the Accords forms the background of this story and that will not change.
It’s the first time she’s responded to a command given by Steve since he moved back in and he imagines he hears approval.
But Tony had proved himself a different kind of Adversary. He couldn’t let the man he loved die even if it made him hate Tony. Even if he had to suffer at Steve’s hands over and over and over. It was those little-deaths that ironically kept Tony sane and made Steve madder. Every fresh betrayal begot another as they corrupted their paradise and dragged it further into Hell.
“I want to be here. For you. The world can save itself for awhile.” That’s what everyone keeps telling him.
For an experience Steve has no intention of repeating it occupies more than its fair share of his thoughts. Part of that is the isolation. Despite his relative freedom in the Compound he’s still under house arrest and the agents who mill about remember that. They don’t associate with him: half on principle and half fearful of picking up the taint.
“Hey man, I get it, a million years in that place with only Stark for company. I get why you’d need space. Eventually he would have driven me nuts too.”
Tony stares out the window at nothing. “And you don’t fix anything at all. You break them and then wait around for someone else to repair it. You don’t even try.”
The hand on Stark’s neck bites in hard as Steve spins him back around and devours his mouth before he can make things worse. This time Tony’s no help whatsoever. He can’t get away pinned under Steve’s weight but he struggles just the same. It stops being exhilarating almost immediately; goes from a whirlwind rush of lust to a slog through the motions. Joints bang at odd angles against hard floors; skin is rubbed raw. Under him Tony is sweating and still cold to the touch. Steve’s frustration mounts.
It was unusual for Steve to attend mass on Sunday. He sat in a pew at the back of the vaunted cathedral and tried to find comfort in the familiar prayers or the simple presence of people gathered for worship. The children shifted in their seats, trying to hurry the sermon along. Half the adults followed suit. The priest’s sermon today was on Community Acceptance and Steve wondered when fire and brimstone went out of fashion. If Rome still taught that the Devil had horns and a forked tongue or if they imagined beautiful fallen Lucifer with blackened wings. If they warned you of that most magnificent of his lies:
If Steve says nothing there’s no doubt Tony will strip naked in the hallway. Another performance, another stab at instigation, all of which means nothing because, “I can’t be bought, Stark.”
A flood of emotions flicker behind Tony’s sunglasses. Steve only recognizes a few of them. He might never understand Tony well enough to recognize more. It might not matter. Tony tosses him the car keys anyway and slides into the passenger seat.
"No." Steve blocks him. For once this isn’t about a fight between the two of them. For once Stark’s the one reaching out and not the other way around.
“I’ll take a rain check: you don’t have time either. Little Ross is in town so to punish him Vision’s making Korean BBQ. Everyone’s been summoned to suffer through it to make the charade seem plausible. We need your iron constitution to take one for the team.”
The yellow paint of the Lamborghini is glossy and obnoxious but the leather is cool as Steve slides behind the wheel. He makes a show of checking the mirrors so he doesn’t have to look at Tony in the passenger seat.
Tony stepped out of the car. His spine straightened, his smile returned, the invisible armour assembling around him, piece by piece. Steve envied it. His hands flexed on the steering wheel. The cold that crept in felt deserved.
This time they don’t have a magic stone to blame. This time the rush of anger flooding Steve’s body is accompanied by pinpricks of something else. He’s too aware of Tony’s body: the dark cotton of his shirt, the smell of oil and old sweat, the uneven lines of his beard where he hasn’t shaved. Stark lives in his skin in a way Steve can’t in his stolen body. The tension in the room ratchets up like a heavy, drugged haze. The buzzing in Steve’s ears grows intolerable. He wants nothing more than to reach out and bridge the gap between them but whether or not the touch is welcome, it definitely means the talking part will be over.
“Sorry,” Tony mumbled as he tied off the end. His fingers had always been dexterous and mobile but now they seemed clumsy.
“Well, I pretty much just read between the lines. The guy’s a teeny bit overprotective of Stark regardless of whether or not they’re on speaking terms.”
His spade hits a bundle of roots hiding under the rich earth and slices it cleanly in half. “I think I killed your… purple.”
“That’s never stopped us before. Do you really think we can get through this,” Tony brushes up against Steve’s body, “without a fight?”
Steve closes his eyes behind the tinted lenses (and why exactly they’re tinted, he has no idea) and lets himself think of nothing but how Christmas used to be a bright spot: midnight mass and cheap presents, and for a day even the cold seemed kind. The scene refocuses. It’s solider than Bucky’s version; the wood has knots, the wallpaper has seams. Their younger selves are the exceptions: they’re as see-through as ghosts. Steve doesn’t try to revive them. He concentrates on the elation of Christmas. His mother’s voice floats in from the back door and hearing it outside his own head is the best and worst thing he could have imagined.
It’s amazing how regardless of the situation Stark can instantly make himself into Steve’s greatest frustration. “You’re joking, right?” he growls. “There’s an unauthorized civilian in the Avengers kitchen at 3 am, FRIDAY’s ignoring me, and a Code White went out 20 minutes ago and you’ve only now decided to show up!”
He opened his eyes to a red sky, sunlight filtering through the atmosphere, lighting it on fire. There were two sets of footprints in the sand leading toward the horizon. The air smelled damp, like peat and decay.
It was compulsive truth and in unkinder times Steve had thought Tony incapable of it. But it was never cathartic. Tony seemed to share like he was oblivious to how much it hurt Steve to hear. He’d repeat stories; looping back, the same event finding awful refinement in the retelling. In a car at sixty-miles an hour there was no escape.
Tony tastes warm and bitter. Like coffee. Like he would have a lifetime ago, before everything went sideways.
He reaches around Steve to the coffee machine but the moment his upper back twists his breath catches violently. He retracts his hand so quickly the coffee pot smashes to the ground and he has to brace both arms on the counter to prevent himself from doubling over.
The Soldier catches his left fist before Steve can take a second swing and now he is well and truly immobilized: stuck between the assassin and some entity in charge of the Iron Man suit. He's failed Tony and Bucky both. There’s nothing he can do except wait for the high-pitched whine of a repulsor charging at point blank range -
Bucky arrived on the third day looking like a zombie. He handed Steve a coffee and slumped into the adjacent chair. “I’m sorry.”
The scene starts to fall off kilter. Wanda screams when Pietro dies. Rhodes falls to the floor like a marionette with his strings cut. Howard and Tony have turned on each other, arguing with loud voices and each with a drink in hand. The Barton children are crying but their parents are nowhere to be found. Natasha, Fury and Hill are back in their SHIELD blacks, shouting orders. T’challa pulls his mask over his face while Bucky, with blank eyes but that same grin, picks up a gun and -
“I was thirsty.” The stranger snorts into his tea, another less-than-proper mannerism. “Clearly it was a mistake; serves me right for stealing really. No one told me Captain America slept on the sofa”
Where’s Tony?” Steve’s words came out rough and raspy as if the fire had burnt their edges. He could still smell the smoke.
Even if the undersuit does no harm, it’s still a battle Tony’s losing. It looks like he’s being swallowed from the inside out by a monster. Like he’s caught in the pull of the undertow, dragged under to drown under a sea of perfect gold, and Steve doesn’t know how to help. He’s not even trying. Instead he stares at the car keys clutched in Tony’s fidgeting left hand. They eat up his field of vision until they’re all he can see.
as defined by Natasha has a different meaning than its accepted use but Steve takes her point. It’s difficult for him to accept that the battle is over and the crisis has passed. This is just what normal and home look like now.
On the worst days once Steve is spent Tony just smirks before spinning on his heel and walking away unsatisfied. He leaves Steve behind to the heavy post-orgasm bliss curdling in his gut. The lack of reciprocity feels like a betrayal of the only redeeming feature of this terrible idea: that it is mutual. The one-sidedness just feels like another resentment he can add to the pile.
Once upon a time she would have volleyed back a sly joke of her own as they corralled the rest of their team. Now she just inclines her head in greeting before taking off. He tries not to let the disappointment eat at him. It's unfair. There was no abrupt implosion, no argument, but their relationship is slipping away regardless. The more desperate Steve tries to hold on, the more intangible she becomes. When she seeks him out later for a walk around the grounds it's a rare occurrence. She leads him to the very edge of the perimeter, out of range of any of the Compound’s surveillance.
She may as well be deciphering tea leaves but Tony lets her voice wash over him and imagines he feels the rustling blooms settle.
They don’t consult him at all this time. He doesn’t even know they’re adding someone until an agent mentions Rhodes got another flier conditionally cleared with the council and Natasha is taking ‘the new guy’ on a tour around the Compound. Steve wonders at what point it’s appropriate to introduce the brand new Avenger to the resident prisoner and then -
Steve grimaced like he knew it wouldn’t and knew that Tony wouldn’t quit until he’d tried and failed. Steve barely changed position, just nudged his knees out wider and Tony found himself once again lying in mud but with a much greater prize in sight. He struggled to undo the zipper of Cap’s uniform pants and when he’d looked up for help, he’d only found Steve’s remote face staring down at him. Tony bowed his head back down. The sharp pain in his sprained wrist was brief and excruciating as Tony wrestled the zipper open but he was rewarded with a sharp hiss when he engulfed as much of Steve’s manhood as he could on one go. He couldn’t taste anything of Steve, just generic skin and aroused flesh. The angle was terrible and drool ran down Tony’s chin to join the mud as he tried to accommodate Steve’s length. His elbows dug into the soft muck and he slipped forward, impaling himself until the cockhead hit the back of his throat.
“For fuck’s sake,” Stark's voice has the quiet flatness that covers simmering rage, “I didn’t invite a HYDRA agent into my living room. Let’s pretend you respect me enough to believe I’d check,” his lips draw into a thin line, “or did you think I’d do it on purpose?”
Steve’s creeping through the North Wing, sleep long since forgotten. He can’t find Bucky in his quarters so he heads for the next logical place: the small gym. As he approaches he can hear the murmur of two distinct voices and instantly his focus snaps to, everything in him going on high alert. At night the floor is supposed to be empty save Bucky. Steve doesn’t even wait to hear what the voices are saying, just pushes open the double doors -
Bucky opens the gift carefully and smiles like no one could ever want anything more than tiny squares of baked flour and salt. “Aw, Stevie, you shouldn’t have. It’s just what I always wanted.”
Steve still needed to know, his voice barely a whisper. “When we were in the castle, at the very beginning, how did you fall off the parapet?”
matttered less. The chorus of Avengers and henchmen alike had paused to allow the villain his moment in the spotlight. They all knew their roles by now. Evil appeared, the Avengers were summoned. They clashed, they retreated, and lived to fight another day. Deja vu.
“No one. I’ve got this. Just…” he squeezed his eyes shut, “give me a couple days. It’s just a heat. I’ve had them since I was thirteen, I can handle it.”
It’s not good set-up for either of them. For Bucky to have to stare at an echo of a man he killed. For Tony to feed and house and help the man who strangled his mother. Except they banter, and Tony helps, and Bucky smiles. A secret pact in no man’s land. Steve’s own relationship with Tony might be worse.
Steve purses his lips and carefully keeps both hands curled around the railing to keep himself from leaving.
Natasha manages to snort elegantly. “Tony’s always treated rules as optional, why would he start obeying them now?”
Steve needs to leave for both their sakes. He can render Tony unconscious, hammer his way through the doors and be on his way to Belgium before Stark wakes.
They were all funerary cairns; every one of the dozen structures dotting the plain marked a death. It was then that Tony saw what Cap had: embedded in the torso of the cairn among the dazzling shards of ore was a cracked arc reactor. He curbed the urge to reach for it.
Six months ago revealing a vulnerability felt like giving away one of the few things that still belonged to him. That’s not the way sharing works. It feels like a massive revelation but Tony takes it in stride. He just nods and rests his head on the back of the chair, closing his eyes. He used to do that a lot: fall asleep draped over whatever piece of furniture was nearest - a residual product of science binges and a lifetime of living alone. Being safe enough to fall asleep around was something Steve didn’t realize he was missing until he got it back.
The answer, as it turns out, is a dialect of Spanish. He throws himself into learning it and his poorly-pronounced attempts fall flat in an empty room. It’s frustrating and slow-moving and Steve’s not the only one who thinks so. FRIDAY hits her breaking point one Thursday afternoon and starts correcting him in a rapid Irish-lilted, flood of Spanish.
hurt me, Steve. Not physically.” Pain, like death, didn’t exist here. Not for Tony. “And we both know you’ll eventually ask again and I’ll say
Stark gives a little laugh at Steve’s spirited defense. “Well, that certainly makes me a hypocrite.” His eyes glitter in a way that only precedes casual cruelty. “At least I’m in good company.”
“Tony. Stop.” To his surprise Tony does. “I didn’t invite you here for anything to do with talking. I just needed a ride and I thought it was time you knew.”
Tony nearly smiled. “That’s the joke: biology doesn’t care about feelings. The Captain was as bonded to me as I was to him and when I left he didn’t have any foetal tissue to ease him through the shock.” There was the curl of a lip. “I killed him. He died of a broken heart.”
Sam’s still nodding. “Functioning addicts are the hardest to convince. Rhodey told me he hit bottom over Christmas.”
Steve's the one who’s stuck. He spends the anniversary of the Starks’ deaths alone in his room, staring at the sullied shield Howard once handed him with all the hope in the world.
He spends the rest of the evening trying to cover his agitation. He spends hours failing to add faces to the figures in his sketchbook. Every expression he draws is wrong; waffling between cartoonish and lifeless. He can’t get the precise tick of lips right to indicate a secretive smile so the woman is left with a silent scream. The eyes of another stare off the page in desperation, as if needing to escape the mutilation of Steve’s pen. The Tin Soldier’s face is blank and dead but at least that fits. It’s only humanity Steve has difficulty capturing on the page.
Sin’s tongue darted out to lick her thin lip and Steve was struck by her utter ridiculousness. He pitied her shallow, zealous evil. She was a Halloween costume; with her cartoonish red skull face and her parroted ideas. Her father could arouse the beast in men but his daughter had no such talent, only paid lapdogs. Steve had seen the face of evil and none of them wore her unfortunate visage.
before he figured out the answer. It was so audacious he couldn’t believe it. He wouldn’t have, had he not known it came indirectly from Tony.
Steve frowns. “No, you’re not. You don’t like being hurt.” He hesitates, ten paces behind. “I don’t like hurting either.”
Tony knows what the flowers mean. He looks at his husband, the love of his life, his partner of four years -
Steve doesn’t know how to answer. Frustration is already creeping back, afterglow cut short because nothing is different. Tony is still Stark is still Iron Man and they’re still stuck. The shield on the couch is still damaged. Tony must have known this wouldn’t help them. Maybe he just went along with it to prove that point to Steve.
“I had a choice. I had a deadline. The hospital was a nice upgrade; medieval doctors suck.” Tony’s gaze was sharp. “Don’t you dare tell me I shouldn’t have.”
The blooms don’t stop. The first petal is joined by a second, a fifth, a forty-sixth: a rainbow of shapes and colours and sizes. His chest aches every time. The coughing accelerates. He hacks up showers of limp, spittle-covered flora; stuffing them quickly into pockets, burying them in garbage cans. He has an alcoholic’s gift for careful deception and not one escapes his eagle eye. Steve remains loving and none the wiser and ever-growingly absent. Tony used to dread the time alone but now he counts the days, desperate for the long windows of solitude when he doesn’t have to hold his breath and pretend the truth isn’t a living thing in his chest.
” Steve spat through gritted teeth. MODOK was ugly, not beautiful. He was welded to his technology inelegantly, he didn’t wear it like a second skin. He was a wretched creature by design, not a Fallen one Steve had tried so many times to restore.
"You have the worst ideas." Tony attacks Steve's mouth before he can retort. It's a dirty trick but Steve swiftly doesn’t care once Tony’s hands start wandering downward.
(Just once, Steve tastes whisky on Tony’s lips. He drops Stark on the couch and walks away, deaf to the curses hurled after him.)
Despite its narrowness the river was deceptively deep and the bottom dropped away almost instantly. Tony was a competent swimmer but he found himself fighting the current as if it were a riptide. The water was too viscous to be any form of true water. It was like swimming through syrup and with each stroke Tony sunk further in. The floating white tendrils snagged his calves and arms like kelp as he swam, begging him to follow and let the flow take him where it wont. He closed his eyes and the river’s triumphant gurgling rang happily in his ears.
Sam himself looks a little bit older, a little bit wiser in person than their video calls would suggest. He’s in a civilian suit and it’s a good look on him. His hair is subtly longer and he seems leaner than before - details that don’t matter much on their own but stacked one on top of the other are indicators of just how much life has moved on since they saw each other last.
“There are no electric sheep involved and unconsciously processing the day’s memories takes him all of 20 seconds.”
When Natasha goes to Amsterdam to visit Wanda, Steve sees her off in the hangar at her request. She looks him up and down, calculating. Then she steps close and wraps her arms around his neck. It feels like the hug from a ghost, transient and unsubstantial, but more than you ever thought you’d get again. Steve tries not to grab more than is freely given. Natasha doesn’t hug people these days. It feels like goodbye.
Clint had taken up a very foolish position between them. “First of all: massive overreaction, Doc. Secondly: Cap, this isn’t like you. The guy might be a dick but Avengers policy is that’s not a good enough reason to attack someone.”
Steve had seen that smile before. Tony had laid dying, triumphant and evil and beautiful, in his arms. He’d denied Steve’s pleas for release and then he’d denied Steve his retribution. Tony had always been inventive: he’d splintered a femur from the boneyard and found his own brachial arteries. Now warm blood ran down them both as Steve clutched him in his lap.
“He’s dead,” Tony replied simply. “Barnes and Logan didn’t stab him if that’s what you were hoping to hear. He was alive when we left.”
Steve stilled to try to avoid giving away any details, be they intimate or of a darker nature. He could not be sure he fooled her.
“Of course you are,” Steve snaps angrily and he has never been able to leave anything alone in his life. It takes him all of five strides to catch up to Tony and absolutely no effort at all to push him up against the wall. He run his hands up and under Stark’s shirt in a way that is becoming too familiar as Stark struggles, sandwiched between Steve’s body and the wall.
In the end it doesn’t matter that it’s Stark. Steve breaks. He takes what he can, what Stark has offered. Steve doesn’t bother with a warning: he’s silent as the grave as he paints Tony’s already slick skin and already ruined shirt.
“You mean you won’t.” Tony’s voice is harsh. “You’re just going to abandon them? Bucky and Natasha? Sam? I suppose it’s comforting to know I’m not the exception.”
He blinked and found himself in the common room of the Mansion. He wasn’t alone. Clint and Dr. Strange were at the table. The room was tense, stress lingering in the air despite the casual domestic scene.
. It’s every dark accusation Steve has ever wanted to hurl at Stark but packing more weight because they’re coming from someone Tony still respects.
Stark pushes off from the car and hisses lowly, “I know at least two people who’d say differently if they were alive to say it.”
The fact that he manages to get both of them off is a credit to his determination more than his skill but for a solitary moment after orgasm Tony looks a little less like a force of nature and a little more human. It doesn’t feel like a victory. Steve’s skin feels dirty and too tight, covered in grimy sweat from the silt on the floor. He offers Stark a hand up but instead Tony drags himself to sit with his back to the wall; exhausted.
“You’re not here for Bucky at all.” The realization aches somewhere deep in Steve's chest. “You’re here for Tony.”
Now Tony admits it’s Steve’s. Only now that it’s damaged, no longer a symbol of righteousness. Steve glowers and flips the shield from its resting place into his hand. He tries not to relish the ghost of fear that flickers across Stark’s face. The simple weight of the shield on his arm is anchoring, like the return of a missing limb he never realized was gone. It feels like courage.
Tony had weakly raised his head, lips trembling next to Steve’s ear only to croon: “Maybe next time.”
Stark comes back to the Compound two days after Christmas dragging a trail of tabloid headlines. They’re nothing extraordinary by Starkian standards: a fling, a fight, some trespassing. The gravestone of a former SI president gets vandalized in Boston. Stark’s new mansion in Malibu is rumored to have three secure underground bunkers. There’s an online petition to revoke Stark’s key to the city in Philadelphia. There’s another to get him charged with treason.
“But I’m supposed to trust you?” The words hang heavy in the air. “I have half a mind to jump just to prove my point. Final warning, Rogers.”
“Rest,” Tony ordered and Steve noticed the stars were out as if Tony still held sway here and had called down the night.
“Don’t lie. You don’t have to tell me specifics but - ” he bites himself off before please, “don’t lie.”
“We should do this again,” Steve says. He hesitates to ask for more. “Maybe next Thursday? Or Tuesday? I know you’re busy.”
Steve holds his tongue. This is their line. Anything further could too easily cause irreparable damage to themselves or the garage. Steve is familiar with following rules of engagement. He lets the silence stretch, tacitly granting Stark's point.
One of the conditions Penelope Nirin bargained for was Steve’s privacy. He’s not an Avenger so there was no reason for any of them to know but he’s realizing that Francesca isn’t a secret he needs to keep. “I’ve been seeing her for three months now.”
Steve resents the implication and the poison that lives under his skin spills out. “Why shouldn’t I? You willed all of this into existence; this team, the Accords, everything, right down to me being trapped here with you. You got the future you wanted,” he falters, “and I
Steve hopes Tony doesn’t expect direct reciprocation. It’s not that Steve would leave him unsatisfied but he’s not quite sure he could manage that today and certainly not to what Steve imagines are Tony’s usual standards -
“Well I won’t.” Steve planted himself between the doctors and the door. “I called you to help, not to use him as an experiment - “ Richards made a move and Steve grabbed him by the collar, exposing Sue’s decades-old bite.
Tony very nearly gives a genuine smile at that. He’s not wearing Steve’s T-shirt - the injured ribs would make the maneuver all but impossible - but after the initial complaint the coffee seems to be a hit.
The stranger smiles and there’s something placating in it that sets Steve’s teeth on edge. “I meant, may I have my tea?”
“No. Before the Accords, before Ultron, and secrets. We weren’t perfect but - ” So much promise. “The longer I’ve been awake the worse things have become.”
“Fine.” Stark scowls as he stares down the hall at something that isn’t there. “We always have to have things your way.”
Steve knows why Kovalchyk thinks plants would help Tony with his guilt. They helped Kovalchyk’s father deal with his but that’s not Steve’s secret to tell. “You don’t have to do anything. I will.”
The trees themselves were tall and empty with crooked limbs that gave them a jagged, malevolent outline. Every bit of dried bark Tony tore from their trunks crumbled to dust in his fingers. The sap they bled was black and smelled like motor oil. At first Tony didn’t notice the armour; without the reflection of sunlight, the metal of the Iron Man helmet looked dull where it was stamped underfoot one of the trees. The mask was crumpled under the weight of the root, the terminus bursting through the eye-slit to bind the faceplate more tightly to the base of the tree. A gold undersuit was suspended from on high in a sister tree, hanging limply like a flag without wind. A full gauntlet was embedded into the trunk of another. Further into the wood an entire suit was being consumed by a black-barked giant: the armour still complete as if the man inside had suddenly transformed into a dryad and no one had bothered to tell him his armour no longer fit.
Steve reached and Tony gave. It was never a power play or showing off, it was whatever Tony thought Steve wanted.
Dr. Tanaka keeps talking but Steve hears nothing but a high-pitched, faraway ringing in his own ears.
He stared down into the nothingness of the well as the mortar gave way under his palms, the stones crumbling and leaving him with nothing but handfuls of empty air. He was perched on the edge of oblivion, caught; the pendulum too far forward to snatch back from gravity, with nothing but the beckoning black maw of the darkness below readying to swallow him whole.
Steve stopped loving Tony easily enough before and he will do so again no matter how vehemently he denies it. He won’t even need a fairytale illness to force his hand. Tony doubts he’ll mourn for long. Wakanda doesn’t get snow.
“I know.” The only flaw in this paradise was in Steve; in the oozing wound that stung and reminded him that mortals were never meant to live without death. “Send me back. Please.”
“Tony.” She plants her hands on her hips at Steve’s surprise. “Out of the suit he’s not much of a challenge.”
“There were dinosaurs with feathers rampaging through Times Square and we were saved by you hitting a sorceress with a big metal frisbee. I promise you I haven’t had this much fun in a long time.”
“I’m working on it,” Tony said confidently to cover his unease, “and you don’t have to do anything but stay with me, Cap. We’re not dead yet and I don’t believe in the Afterlife - and that includes Hell.”
He doesn’t like what it says about him that this revelation hits from out of the blue. It’s the simplicity of it that catches him off guard. He is too used to thinking of Stark as exceptional - with his money, his mind, his modernity - but he is not the exception in this. It’s written, plain as day, in every line of his body. This is the the thinness of the ledge Steve’s walking. This is how he’s changed and it has nothing to do with serum.
” Tony says like it’s a failing. “So you’re not leaving, I’m not drinking, and Natasha’s coming back.” His expression is wry. “Want to bet on how long we last?”
“Tony…” Stark turns, oblivious to what’s coming, and the words rush out, “What did you see in the stars?”
“Not all of it. Too much.” Tony laughed and shook his head. “It doesn’t matter.” He stared into the depths of the fire. “The body’s going to be a bitch to get back out, I’m sorry about that too.”
Tony glared at him, or tried to, only one eye truly awake where his face was resting on the porcelain rim of the toilet. “No. If you’d actually suspended me instead of sending me on vacation you could drug test me.”
Steve wakes on the floor of the gym to a dull thrum at 3am. It’s a blessing. The dream slips away, leaving nothing but a slick, acrid aftertaste at the back of his throat. It takes him several moments to realize the hum is not in his imagination. He’s not hearing it, he’s feeling it; minute vibrations singing through the structure of the building itself. It’s a living pulse, keeping tempo like a beating heart.
Steve stared at where Iron Man’s armour had bent under long sharp teeth and something dark in him quickened. “Is this
“You’re in my seat,” Tony says, finally taking the bait and wandering away from the open safety hazard. He settles onto the roof next to the lawnchair.
The stranger nods. He moves slowly, whether due to age or caution is moot. The cane and overcoat are abandoned and he keeps both hands open and in Steve’s field of view even if he’s otherwise impervious to Steve’s gaze. He lumbers carefully to his feet.
The Iron Man armor hovers over the edge, five feet beyond where the roof falls away. Tony turns to stare at Steve, gaze askew and not entirely from drink. Steve’s grip tightens subconsciously.
“Well, I do.” Steve’s taken aback by the vehemence in Tony’s voice. “Just how do you expect me to explain any of this? Christ.”
Bucky gives a smile back, sweet and soft, and Steve doesn’t recognize it at all. That’s when he realizes that Stark hasn’t taken this from him.
Steve waits for the shimmer to fade, his voice is cracked. “You fix things Tony, but people aren’t things.”
Tony contemplates him and then shakes his head. “You’ll hate it - you already hate it - and let’s be clear: you have no say in what I decide to do to myself.”
She looks at him steadily but doesn’t pry further. “I was in New York. There was pushback on Colonel Rhodes.”
The fledgling sinister blooms that will grow to consume his every moment are indistinguishable in the beginning from everyday aches and pains. His chest seizes at odd intervals and for the wrong reasons. He wakes abruptly, gasping for air, and can’t quite remember the nightmare that propelled him there. There’s a thickness at the back of his throat; easily ignored but never absent. The ghosting scent of spring permeates the bedroom.
Tony would hazard that Steve was right. The river stunk of burning oil wells, smoke floating up in thick black clouds, but no heat emanated from it. Between the pools of fire and the rainbow oil slicks Tony could see the shallow bottom littered with bits of shrapnel. He dipped his hand into the water and retrieved a remnant of an artillery shell. He knew what it was before he turned it over but he still made himself read the lettering.
“So that’s a no, then,” Tony said with forced lightness, scrambling to cover the rejection. “Makes sense, I hung you out to dry for awhile there, let’s just - “
Stark leans back on the black sportscar. “No, you didn't," he says with too much surety. "And my answer's still no.”
“She’s right.” Steve can see the single vibrating string holding all of Tony together. “This can’t end well.”
A frisson of pleasure runs through Steve but watching a similar response ripple across Stark’s face might be better. It’s not an altruistic joy. It’s competitive at best - running right up to the edge of vindictive. Captain America would never feel such a thing but Steve isn't him anymore. He's just Steve Rogers now and Steve Rogers wants to claw his way through Stark to Tony and this seems as good a way as any. Every instinct in him screams at him to get them both off as quickly as possible but he keeps his strokes languid and even until the last of tension in Stark’s shoulders bleeds out.
“Same bat time, same bat channel,” Tony murmurs. “You need to get out of here too, Rogers.” Without waiting for an answer he steps into the Iron Man suit and takes off through the hole in the ceiling leaving the two soldiers alone.
Tony tenses. The unnatural stiffness travels through his body, his shoulders pinch, his arms fall to his hips. “Great. Why Wilson would choose you as a character witnesses is a mystery, but message delivered.”
Rhodes comes back in June. Tony walks into the Avengers active area with a duffle bag slung over his shoulder and there’s Jim, a half-step behind. He’s got new titanium leg braces and the same half-exasperated, half-intrigued expression he’s always worn when listening to Tony chatter on about a new project. It could be a scene from six months ago or six years ago. Tony leaves him to deal with the relieved handshakes and welcome backs from the Avengers support staff and Steve waits for them to peter out before making his presence known.
Tony was still pinned by the throat but he smiled because here, in reality, Tony had always been a much better liar than Steve. That was when Luke burst in. Steve dropped his hand automatically, Tony’s gauntlet likewise retreated, but neither of them turned to look at the interloper. They were the only ones who existed.
The bar is nearly empty when they arrive and even emptier by the time they leave. The scene that greets Steve when they return is comfortable and intimate. Pepper’s curled up on the couch asleep, her jacket tucked under her head, red hair streaming, her feet nestled in Tony’s lap while he taps on a tablet. It’s a gentle reminder of things he and Tony never had.
, Steve, why did you think he was always so guilty around you? He knows he can’t repay you the way you want. I didn’t tell him, he just knows.”
MODOK had launched his attack and Steve ignored the swarming robots. They didn’t bleed. MODOK would. He wasn’t hard to locate and Steve ran after him, dropping his shield to tackle the hydrocephalitic head. He hit the ground like Humpty Dumpty.
, and the sting of being left behind. Hanahaki is the disease of the lovelorn and Steve reached deep down into Tony’s lungs and tore any such love out by the root.
The sand was too hot for the warmth to be soothing so Tony just led Steve back to the nearest skeleton tree and shuddered when he saw his own chestplate subsumed into the trunk. Of the pair of them Steve was normally the one who ran hot but now Steve’s skin felt like death warmed over. Tony stripped him down as far as he could and snuggled close, careful not to jostle Steve’s wound. It felt like cuddling a corpse, albeit one who insisted he couldn’t feel the cold. Tony supposed, now that he thought about it, that dead men couldn’t feel one way or the other.
“Can’t you ever just leave well enough alone?” Steve replaced the stone in the exact spot Tony had taken it from. “It’s a funerary cairn.”
Sam shakes his head. “Not that job.” He fiddles with the tab of his lemonade. “Captain America 2.0. Bigger, better, Blacker. Less Mighty Whitey.”
Steve had been so wrapped up in finding Kovalchyk’s true motivations he had almost ignored Tony completely. “I don’t know, Buck.”
Tony had stood with his back to the edge of the crevasse. The pit held the only true fire in this place and the heat rose in a hazy shimmer.
“He is,” Rhodes checks his watch, “but he’s also about to tell her he injected himself with an untested experimental virus and that’s just the tip of the iceberg of what needs to come out tonight.” He eyes Steve in a way which leaves no doubt that Steve is going to be one of those revelations. “You might want to steer clear.”
“Why do I even bother trying with you?” Tony asks bitterly, mostly to himself. He doesn’t wait for an answer. “I’m going to bed. Happy’s outside to drive you to the airport, Doc. Rogers.” He turns on his heel and wanders towards the elevators.
Steve’s seen Tony beg. He’s seen him plead and appeal to Steve’s higher nature, sincerity etched in every feature. It’s awful to hear a man so proud grovel and awfuller to know it has never worked. “I said
He tries to fill himself back up with other things: Bucky’s smiles, video chats with Wanda, Vision’s terrible food, walks with Natasha. When it gets too much he picks fights with Tony and tells himself it’s in service of a righteous cause. As if Tony is the keystone and if Steve can just get him onside then the rest will fall back into place. They’ll get back what they had and who they were. Instead he gets harsh words and an orgasm as a consolation prize.
It’s Tony’s fault he makes Steve feel so much; out of control and lashing out in any direction but even if Tony is the instigator the sickness lies in Steve. Tony just brings out the worst in him: the liar, the coward, the bully, but it was all there under the surface, waiting.
Natasha's unimpressed. “You could call the Joint Task Force, the US military, and the UN down on his head if he ran and we both know Steve wouldn’t hurt you deliberately.”
Steve had experience overcoming those. The blade cut cleanly; through skin, through tissue, stopping short of organ. He exhaled and let the pain flow out and through him. It stung sharply but it wasn’t
As long as those letters remain unopened and Tony takes his time assessing the prosthetic arm then neither has to find out where they stand. They can coast by on stalemate. The idea is anathema to Steve. It seems to be working for them anyway.
The days start to blur. With no missions or responsibilities, time slowly slips away from Steve. He no longer wakes with the sun. Instead he stays up to all hours of the night, curfew long since forgotten. He starts marking the passage of time in destroyed punching bags instead of calendars. He runs from dusk til dawn around the rim of the property, orbiting the Compound until its lights call him back.
There’s a loud smash and Steve tenses, every muscle in his body singing with the call to action. There’s not much he can do if they armour up. Tony can call the suit at any time. Rhodes can too. Steve would be going in blind and unarmed. Vision though - Vision is powerful enough to phase through the wall and pull them apart with ease, so why hasn’t he?
A sportscar a violent shade of robin’s egg blue pulls up through the curtain of rain and Steve watches as Tony dashes from the car without an umbrella. It’s not far to the safety of the porch but it’s enough for the warm rain to soak him through to the skin anyway. Steve holds the screen door open and hopes the amused smile on his face is interpreted as the fondness it is.
He doesn’t know what Natasha does but Stark up and solves any of Steve’s lingering doubts by leaving for California on an extended Christmas vacation. Part of him had hoped that Bucky would relax once Tony wasn't in the same building but it’s December 14th and Natasha’s prediction of Bucky’s worsening slide has come to pass.
“I need to.” Bucky licks his lips. “He looks a lot like Howard. The one we saw at the Expo, not the older one. Calling him Tony helps separate them in my head.”
Calling Tony by his full first name is so unusual Steve can’t recall it ever happening before. “And that means I should trust you?”
“What are we losing? Our fantastic working relationship? Our friendship built on mutual trust and respect?” Stark counts them off like those were never things they had and lost. “C’mon Captain America, save me from myself. Pep’s gone, Rhodey’s gone. There’s a bottle of scotch upstairs screaming at me and there’s nothing in my workshop anyone wants me playing with right now.” Stark’s voice is unsteady. “If it helps don’t think of it as doing me a favour, think of it as saving the world from me.”
What pulled him back to full consciousness wasn’t the fading wind but Steve’s fidgeting. The world was the same grey twilight but the rain had abated to a warm drizzle so light the droplets were nearly suspended in air.
Benching Tony only hastened the spiral. It was like Iron Man was the only thing keeping him in check. It devolved: bars, tabloid headlines, parties. Steve held his breath, waiting for the self-destruction to take something irreparable but Tony balanced everything precisely on a knife’s edge. The nights he didn’t come back to the Mansion were cause for concern. The nights he did were worse.
The Avengers threw Steve and Tony a Welcome Back party at the Mansion. The potluck table was laden with the offerings of busy people with unpicky palates. Sam had made meatballs, Jess had brought cookies.
In typical Stark fashion, Tony ignores the fact he’s been blatantly caught out. “You gonna stare into my eyes forever?” He nips at Steve’s thumb impatiently before his voice turns husky, “Or are we doing something else?”
They’re not really Steve’s or Tony’s. Captain America and Iron Man are just convenient touchstones for viewpoints a dozen international law graduates are perfectly capable of expounding on their own. Across the conference table Tony looks like he wants to say something but he bites it back. Their petty skirmishes don’t end in sex or violence or airports getting destroyed anymore. They just end with ugly words that linger without the rush of adrenaline or endorphins to disperse them.
Across the continent Tony sighed and the line didn’t even crackle. Steve swore he could feel the breath flutter across his cheek. “No, I didn’t. But I thought forgetting might be the better option.”
Steve thinks of all the nights Bucky asked him not to come, of all the times FRIDAY wouldn’t tell him where Tony was. He thinks of the day Bucky started wearing the arm again and the confusion on Dr. Tanaka’s face when Bucky couldn’t articulate what had changed.
He up and retires to the endless prairie of rural Manitoba. That doesn’t rule out any secret work he could have done. In fact, the numerous silos and bunkers littered across the Kovalchyk homestead suggest otherwise, but to the world at large he becomes a landscaper, has his children, and changes his name.
“We’re in Hell,” Steve corrected and Tony knew now that he meant it metaphorically and had from the very beginning. Steve gestured towards the hole in the ice and his voice broke. “You even gave me a home.”
He shivered despite the temperate climate and levered himself with difficulty onto sore, blistered feet. There were footprints in the mud leading off in various directions, criss-crossing each other like a hideous stampede. No birdsong broke the monotonous silence. The flat light made his bare limbs seem paler, skin dotted with smears of brown muck and dried blood. He was naked but otherwise mostly intact. There was a bump near his hairline that hurt dully when pressed. The skin around his collar felt raw. With numb fingers he traced the edges of three small, circular punctures in his abdomen. They weren’t bleeding but the internal ache made Tony worried they ran deep. He couldn’t remember how they came to be.
He looked down. He’d re-opened his stitches sometime during the night. The wound was bleeding sluggishly through his white T-shirt. The red reminded him of the colour of armour.
Steve can tell Tony doesn’t quite believe it. They’ve all grown too accustomed to standing alone or divided, and Tony’s shouldered it better than most. Expanding the Avengers is a necessity to him but Steve’s wants to make sure it’s a reward too. That what is rebuilt can stand without them because the foundation is sound, and since Steve is not an engineer he needs to find other ways to help.
“I absolutely did,” Tony said, voice colourless. “I assumed so many things I shouldn’t have. I thought I was invincible. I went looking for the Captain. I just assumed he’d help me because he looked like you.”
“He was," Steve squeezes his eyes shut, "or well, he might have been. There’s a good chance HYDRA had him killed and that they used the Winter Soldier - James Barnes - to do it.” He rifles through the papers. This isn’t how the conversation was supposed to go. “I don’t have everything here, but I’m - if Tony…”
Howard and Tony are in sync, looking too much alike with their dark hair and white smiles as they chuckle at the chaos. Fury and Maria are dressed down in civilian clothes and oblivious to the mistletoe above them. Dum Dum, Gabe and Sam are chatting about baseball in the corner. Near the buffet Wanda and Pietro are extolling to Vision the virtues of cake. Bruce has his head buried in the fridge as he carries on a conversation with Erskine and Selvig. Helen Cho is being charmed by Thor and Rhodes interrupts his conversation with Jane Foster to stride across the room on unbroken legs to grab them both a drink. Darcy Lewis is attempting to induct T’challa into the spirit of Christmas through the use of felt reindeer antlers. Bucky’s there too; with shorter hair, an enlisted man’s uniform and a grin.
Sometimes Sam’s there panting to keep up. Sometimes Steve catches the red flash of Natasha’s hair disappearing around a corner. Sometimes he just
“No,” Tony replies surprisingly magnanimously. He stares off into the far corner. “Listen, if you want to stay up - “
No one’s told Steve this directly. The conversation dies down whenever he approaches but the civilian medical staff never quite got with the program so Steve learns all this three days into the stalemate once relations have become tense enough that the Belgians have threatened to treat any incoming Quinjets as hostile.
but eventually even the most optimistic have to admit there’s a deterioration. The Winter Soldier's programming doesn’t emerge in full but Bucky slips more often and more often into fugue states. He collapses entirely inward, refusing to open up except to repeat the Soldier’s last designation in a singular, robotic monotone. He hasn’t worn the arm for two weeks and counting. No one believes his refusal has anything to do with physical discomfort.
“I can’t go back.” He knows he’s severing whatever thin thread of hope is keeping his friendship with Tony on life support.
Everything holds; nothing blows up or gets corrupted but Steve feels like he’s just waiting for the other shoe to drop. He stays up in the living room every night. He never runs into Kovalchyk again.
Bucky makes his way to the bench along the east wall and Steve follows, grateful for the silence as he gathers his thoughts.
They’re not actually going to fight, the drunk banter means nothing, but the talk of teams and recruitment and drawn lines is too much for Steve to handle sober. He’s too sensitive to it and when he dares a glance at the sofa Tony is -
It’s a love bite. Faded in the interim hours but still visible, peeking just above his collar. Steve reaches out and swipes his thumb over it. Tony freezes. It’s too red on his skin, even redder next to Steve’s pale fingers. Without his brain’s permission he reaches under the vee of Tony’s unbuttoned dress shirt to flip the collar down, exposing the rest of the hickey and another laid high on Stark’s pectoral. Broken blood vessels in a perfect circle. This is what Tony was aiming to hide.
Steve looks out over the patchwork of colour and feels proud of something he helped grow with his own hands. It’ll all die soon. The frost will come, then the winter, then the spring, but if you plant well enough and deep enough everything comes full circle.
Steve climbed into the bed and Tony followed, both of them fully clothed, under the sheets. It was a mercy, this peace, however temporary it proved to be. It was the long middle of the cycle before the wheel turned and they became their worst selves: succumbing once more to love and violence and treachery.
Suddenly they were making out furiously, all teeth and unkindness. Steve didn’t give Tony an inch, not even when he tasted the unpleasant tang of his own blood and saw the triumphant smear of red across Tony’s mouth, lips arranged into a cruel smirk.
“He did end up saving me from a kidnapping attempt though, so maybe Clint was aiming to be reassuring by just missing me all those times.” Tony’s life is insane. “I picked up the weirdest security detail this year.”
his mind remembers from some dark box labelled before. Then he gathers his courage and seals his mouth over Stark’s.
The harsh halogens are unflattering lighting for anyone but Steve can finally see how jet lagged she looks. Worn and tired under the yoke of responsibility and unable to dart for the safety of the shadows. Sometimes he thinks she’s the only one trying to hold them all together - everyone else is just trying to survive or rebuild or forget. It’s a wonder she hasn’t run off to join Clint yet.
That’s where they’d left it: festering under every interaction but strictly off limits. They stick to the details now: the legalities of American interventionism, Vision’s visits to Wanda, Dr. Tanaka’s team. Dealing only with the symptoms and keeping far away from the disease. It’s not as if they lack for conflict - the shield is just the latest in a long line - but no one’s in the Raft, no one’s dead, no one’s fighting in the streets. No violence. No death squads. No ticking clocks. It should be better, the peace instead of the war, but the ragged broken thing inside of Steve can’t help but insist nothing’s won without blood.
wait. He is determined and hard-headed and could bear the tragedy of love for decades. He could keep the candle burning no matter how much it cost him. He would be Hanahaki’s perfect host: the serum would keep him alive to bloom forever, coughing up flowers like a never-ending fountain. Never to laugh again, never to sleep through the night. Steve wouldn’t get a beautiful death, but a beautiful life filled with nothing but suffering and he would bear it all for love.
“Your conscience never bothered you before so what - oh,” Tony alights on the answer. “It’s not that at all. The Golden Child got a speech from Natasha too.”
Steve lurched upright to stare down at his burning limbs and found nothing but skin. The grey sky was now the dull concrete ceiling of the Baxter medical lab. Any heat he felt was imagined but Steve still might have screamed had the cool air not stolen his voice as readily as the flames.
“So I owe you an explanation.” Tony sat close but not touching, a distinction not lost. “If you keep pulling the story out of Barnes, he’s going to keep leaving me panicked voicemails.”
She gives him the slightly asymmetrical smile that Steve hopes is her real one. Her words cut deeper because of it. “You don’t know any more about me than they do.”
They make it to the bed and it’s soft, so soft. It proves Steve’s point. They don’t need the anger. The fact that it’s common doesn’t mean it’s necessary. Afterward Steve feels numb in the best way. He’s tired and satisfied in a post-orgasmic haze. He watches without an inkling of fear as Tony dresses efficiently and pauses near the door. He picks up Steve’s sketchbook and the faintest of alarm bells begins ringing somewhere far, far away. Tony flips through the ruined pages, getting closer and closer to -
“That’s why I love you, Tones.” Rhodes’s head falls back against the couch to stare at the ceiling. “That and the Maserati.”
“Natasha’s missing. She fell off the grid eight hours ago,” Tony huffs abruptly. “Before she left she told me to trust her which would be hilarious if I could afford to laugh.”
Tony shoots him a dark look like he knows exactly what Steve’s thinking. “Oh, we’re well past the point where you screw me, Rogers. We’re now at the part where you leave me with your shield and run off to bury your head in the sand for 3 months. Except I get to keep Barnes in the divorce this time. I’ll ask him if he’s up for another round of cryo - ”
The bouquet mocks him as he lets Steve take him apart and put him back together as faulty as when he started. Tony’s chest aches and it’s nothing to do with the passenger he carries with him.
Then later, “He’d shave me. Sometimes he kept the beard, the mustache, sometimes he got rid of it all. He’d hold me down and just... decide who I was going to be.“ Tony ran a finger along the underside of his jaw. “He never even nicked me.”
There’s no way of knowing how long the blooms will draw his death out. Some Hanahaki cases go quickly, for others it takes years - for a select few, decades - but they all die in the end. There are no recorded survivors; only anecdotal evidence of miraculous recoveries. It’s difficult to scientifically test if true love’s first kiss really undoes the spell. For those outside the fairytale it’s left to suffer unto death for the whims of the heart.
Tony whistled as he looked at the neat pile. “This amount of corbicite is worth about a 2 million back home provided you could extract the vibran - “ Steve grabbed his wrist hard and there was pain and a muffled
“I’m just saying,” Bucky says slowly, precisely, “losing every week at basketball might not be worth you giving that up.”
He manages to go a whole five days before he breaks his promise to Bucky. He doesn't confront Stark in his office, he corners him in the garage as Tony steps out of an obnoxious orange Audi back from some business in the city.
“Don’t ask me when though. Thor made some good arguments, but having never told someone before… I can’t tell you how or when I would’ve. Know I wanted to, though. I am… relieved, that you all know, now.”
. Tony almost deletes them, but he’s interrupted by a sharp knock and the door opening. Tony scrambles to his feet and drops the box behind the shelf, the phone abruptly shoved in his pocket – but Pepper’s pity is still there, still cuts him. She walks up to him carefully, and cradles his face in her hands, pushes his hair back from his face and kisses his forehead. She takes his hand and leads him out with clicking heels, and it’s only when he puts his hands back in his pockets to check the phone is still there that he realises why her face had fallen so; he’s still wearing the ring.
, this entire fucking mess…” Tony trails off, because he doesn’t need to say it. Tony made mistakes, he can recognise that. Steve wasn’t the only one who didn’t do enough talking – but Steve was the one with the secrets. “
” He speaks as grandly as he does with every word, and perhaps the address was somewhat informal for a dragon, but Tony understood the Scandinavian easily, and preened a little at the title. The One Who Is Golden and Red.
“Can you ask me to?” Tony asks him, pulling back. It’s honest curiosity, there will be no repercussions of Steve’s answer, it’s not even a trap; but it sets these events in motion. It means everything.
“Of course not.” Steve murmured, but he didn’t look up. In fact, he looked impossibly sad for a moment, but Clint interrupted before Tony could ask what was wrong.
“Upstairs,” Tony ordered, poking him in the chest. Steve didn’t move, just blinking at him in shock. “Now, Rogers.” Steve looked about to protest, but Thor cut him off.
sorry. I thought… I thought that telling you was going to hurt you more, and reopen wounds you’d already worked to heal. I… honest to God, Tony, I never even thought of what you might do to Bucky. You’re better than that. Had I known how someone might use it…” he trails off, and while through the ache in his chest, the
