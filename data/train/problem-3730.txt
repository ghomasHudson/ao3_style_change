Dean snarled, wishing he could be an adult and take on the doctor himself but since he was still a child, the little boy had no other option but to sit and wait. Dean hated waiting, the little Alpha despised being away from his mother for so long, Dean couldn’t breathe without his mother and that alone was eating him alive.
And the Alpha’s pectorals were powerfully curved, plump, and proud. A quality trait that Alphas killed to have because such potency was highly desired amongst Omegas. Clearly, the Alpha was god’s only exception at being considered
Dean’s contagiously great mood went down faster than a shitty rollercoaster at six flags, it was so easy to point out when the Alpha became extremely pissed off at anything that was existent/nonexistent along with a bitter sense of humor. Exactly when the time struck 4 pm, Dean became the hugest asshole to ever exist.
Yes, a killer the Alpha was. Every insult, every word, every demeaning offense, every humiliation being spat by Dean’s derogatory mouth were enough weapons to kill the Omega. Slowly, Castiel could feel himself fading. This is exactly how he felt when Lucifer cruelly abused him with words, bullying the Omega and smugly knowing that Castiel would never have enough ammunition to fight back.
The Omega was certain that the Alpha’s lips were a combination of tenderness when the Alpha gave soft kisses yet firm when it came to rough and ardent kisses. The authority that the Alpha would have over Castiel’s lips, left the Omega panting with salacious hunger.
Castiel was dressed in a tight navy-blue dress shirt, a matching-colored tie with polka dots that was slightly crooked to the side, and rocking expensive looking black dress pants. Man, Castiel looked so
Castiel checked his phone again and cursed underneath his breath, two more minutes left. Castiel went to change into his work uniform, basically running into the locker room like there was no tomorrow. The Omega spent only a few seconds getting ready.
“Dean,” Cas says, and in the dark of the kitchen, backlit only by the dim hall light, he looks terrifying. He looks, in a lot of ways, the same as he did the first time they’d properly met.
When was the last time he and Sam had acted like that? Hunting each other down for useless annoyances.
(Especially since Cas severely overestimated just how much soap he needed to wash a single shirt and pair of pants and they’d spent the morning before ankle-deep in suds.)
Jack closes his eyes for just a moment too long to be blinking. His cheek caves in where he sinks his teeth into it. He squares his jaw. “I’m glad we got you back.”
Garth groaned at the sound, covering his ears with the pillow and nudging Castiel awake with his leg. “
Castiel was literally having a panic attack, the Omega’s eyes were clouded with lust while the Alpha urgently pressed the palm of their hands together, keeping them high above Castiel’s head. They were so close, so
Dean covered his mouth, trying to hide his laughter while Sam smiled in a speechless manner. “Usually, I’m a top.”
The Alpha was talking to the Omega, their calm conversation turning into muffled shouts. Then the Alpha was charging towards the Omega but the Omega did everything he could to fight off the Alpha’s hands. The Alpha was trying to get a good grip on his mate but the Omega wasn’t submitting to him, and after struggling for a few seconds, the Omega managed to push the Alpha back and deliver a painful slap to the Alpha’s face.
Chuck was displaying a wide grin, patting Gabriel’s shoulder and mentally congratulating Gabriel for being a goddamn genius. “Yes, Castiel. Gabriel wanted rent boys for his birthday so I got him two. The one he chose, Sam Winchester, is currently upstairs waiting to bed your brother.”
the Alpha detected the aroma of blackberries submerged in rose water. The color of the water changing from light pink to a deep magenta, like the way the galaxies in space shine underneath the lens of their own vanity. It was making Dean salivate like a rabid animal, the insanely sweet fragrance of the ripening fruits belonging to the innocent.
Dean so wanted to chase after Castiel, but he could play games too. “I actually didn’t get your name.”
The younger Alpha flared his nostrils; hints of moistened coconut flakes melted onto his tongue, the sweetness dripping down into his throat while a bouquet of ripe mandarines flooded his mouth with ecstasy. Sam could almost taste the cascade of golden fruit dripping from his mouth onto his chin. The scent of nature made Sam’s head spin in circles; the privilege of consuming that scent made the Alpha’s cock harden with primal urge.
The Omega looked down at his romper, pointing towards his name and smiling innocently. “Guilty as charged.”
Behind the secrecy of midnight oblivion, there were images flashing before the Alpha’s closed eyes, it was like being forced to endure the uncomfortably long hours of a distressing film that was stuck on an endless time loop, never ending and always starting again.
Before either of them had the sense to speak, Dean threw a duffle bag towards Sam’s head. “What the fuck are we doing here for? Let’s give the Novak family the best fucking week of their lives.”
Not really, besides, Crowley would pay for Sam and Dean’s new wardrobe, as he’s done with all of his rent boys.
Dean could feel the beginnings of a huge smile on his lips, at least he didn’t offend the gorgeous creature. “Are you okay?”
Sam turned to face Castiel, his look was soft and heartwarming. “Mr Novak, please forgive us. This was uncalled for and I assure you this won’t happen again, at least, not without your consent.”
This was by the far, the prettiest Omega the Alpha has ever seen and like all the Alphas waiting in line to date Castiel, the younger Alpha was smitten.
Castiel’s body was sending mixed signals that eventually transformed into desperate questions, was he terrified? Was this turning him on? Should he defend himself? Should he give in? Did he want this? Did he not want this? The Omega’s mind was whirling, he didn’t know what to do, until both Winchesters began to nose at his throat, the scents belonging to either Alpha flooded past his sensitive nostrils.
There was a sunset of obscurity closing in on his body, a fogginess intoxicating his mind. The Alpha could feel the growing length of a twisted rope decorated in bloodied thorns, wrapping itself in every exposed corner of his room. Dean could easily feel the rope making its way towards him, snake-like but viciously alluring.
The years passed and Dean grew up to be 16 years of age while Sam was entering the phase of being 11 years old. In all honesty, Sam and Dean were Castiel’s only true loves. Being a single mom was hard but thankfully, Gabriel invited the boys over to his diner whenever Castiel had to work. Although Dean was old enough to stay at home and take care of his little brother, Sam and Dean always insisted on going everywhere with their mother.
Jack attempts to placate them with his normal, neutral smile but it just makes Sam’s stomach plummet further into the ground. “He can’t be an angel,” He explains. “Because that would just keep The Empty awake.”
“You know… I enjoy eating again,” Cas says as the onion begins to sizzle. He adds, as if he’d been reading Sam’s mind. “Being human is not without its benefits.” Then, out of nowhere, “But time is weird.”
They hug, and it isn’t a goodbye. Their palms leave no scars or blood. They’re both alive. “Don’t ever pull that shit again,” Dean warns, just loud enough for him to hear, and Cas swallows.
Sam sits across from Eileen, tries to keep up with the words of people whose mouths Eileen can’t see to read, also tries to shovel bites of food into his mouth between bouts of excited yelling. His ASL has gotten better in the past year, but he’s still bad enough that Eileen laughs at him a few times.
“Time for humans, it’s so… Linear.” When Sam doesn’t respond he adds, “When I was an angel I came to terms with the fact that everything goes away. It’s how things
Dean contemplates going back to the store to get more paint, but he stares at it long enough that fondness grows like a weed in his heart.
Self preservation is different, Sam supposes as he watches Cas hack away at an onion with tears welling in the corners of his eyes, when the only thing that can kill you is a specially-made metal. Angelic kryptonite.
“Keep in mind,” Sam says. “The last time we saw you, your only request was that we not contact you again.”
Sam holds out the smoothie he’d offered Jack. She stares at it, then looks up at him and raises an eyebrow. Maintaining eye contact, she reaches behind him and grabs the partially-full coffee pot.
For a moment, it’s just Dean against stiff, chapped lips, until Cas goes slack in his arms, and puts a hand on the back of Dean’s neck.
For a second, Dean’s breath caught in his throat. The guy was close, his face just a half foot away from Dean’s. Dean got a whiff of his cologne just before he pulled back.
It doesn’t escape him him that he’s thinking so passively of a werewolf. That after Chuck, and the Leviathans, and Lucifer, a lupine amalgamation feels like a vacation. A gun, some silver bullets, and the job is done.
“I’m proud of you,” Cas says, and it makes Dean’s gut lurch. He disguises it by shoving another bite of ham and cheese into his mouth. “You made the right decision.”
doing?” Sam asked cautiously. Dean had his fingers around his glass of whisky, but he hadn’t taken a sip.
Dean blinks. “Uh. Okay?” He says, and doesn’t think about it again until he hears the guitar floating out from under Cas’s bedroom door. Curious, Dean peeks through the open gap in the doorway.
Sam leans his forearms on the counter. “Dean taught me a little bit. But, uh, motel rooms don’t usually have stoves, so I didn’t learn how to cook with an actual kitchen until college. My girlfriend—“
Dean urged the gas pedal down a little further, gripped the steering wheel tighter. “I’m driving you, aren’t I?”
Dean stands and pushes his chair in. He throws his plate in the sink. “Then I’ll see you in the morning.”
For the first dinner, they shove all of the library tables together last supper style. They all sit elbow-to-elbow, bumping shoulders when they reach for their drinks or another helping of potatoes. Bobby tells a joke, and half of the table explodes into unrestrained laughter. After a few seconds of Telephone, the other half of the table catches on and laughs, too.
(Had he ever had that? Did college count when he was always bracing himself for the phone call. About Dean, or Dad, or both.)
The bunker felt relatively the same, though. Sam walked through the hallway and despite the gaping holes where Cas should be, he managed to feel at least a little bit at home. He’d made his way into the study to find Dean staring down the barrel of a bottle of jack. Any other time, Sam might scold him for his vices, but it seemed as good a time as any.
“Chuck’s been keeping busy.” Dean shoves another forkful of spaghetti into his mouth. “Let me guess, it’s the one where God finally goes rogue.” When he holds out his hand, Charlie hands it over.
She wonders, idly, if this is what her grandfather had wanted for her. To live in the bunker, to kill monsters. If, maybe, he’d hoped for Maura’s discretion. If he’d ever hoped that a normal life was in the cards for them.
“There something I can help you with?” Bobby asks when he looks up and catches them staring. He wipes his lips with his sleeve and raises an eyebrow at them.
have been, without Michael, or God, or Lucifer. “I’m glad, too,” He says, and Jack nods into his shoulder.
“We can leave in the morning,” Sam says, and Eileen’s face lights up. She scooches herself up to the headboard, and leans into him when he sits down.
He squints into the night and tries to remember what Dean taught him. Don’t choke up on the steering wheel too much, don’t stomp on her brakes, ease her into a faster speed, drive closer to the middle than the shoulder.
Sam furrowed his brow. “He said he loves you,” He repeated, and Dean finally threw back his drink. Sam sighed. “Wow.” Then, “What did you say?”
There’s not much about her grandfather. There’s a few photos with him in them, a few loose records from random hunts. She knows that he’d killed a handful of vampires, that he’d (if the photos are any indication) gotten decently drunk at a Christmas party, and that he once saved a young couple from a Djinn.
Sam suppressed a shudder. He’d been trying not to think about how cold the cement was below Eileen’s cellphone. So he asked, instead, leaning forward, “Is it like that? Like with Eileen?”
“It’s because you’re tough,” Jody says, nudging her. “It’s good practice. Now shh— They’re calling names.”
Jack sits up with a gasp, and Sam’s heart drops to his feet. Dean rounds the corner so fast he knocks a box off the shelf. It clatters to the ground and spreads salt all over the floor.
He was well dressed, in dress slacks and a button-up, sleeves rolled just below his elbows. There was a leather jacket thrown over the back of the chair behind him, though, and a clear strain on his shirt when he squared his shoulders.
Dean lets out a long breath. He rolls onto his back and traces a crack in the ceiling with his eyes.
They find a cassette player buried under a pile of old CDs at the Goodwill. They’re there for clothes, because Cas has been wearing the same outfit for over a decade and doing laundry every single day got out of hand fast.
Dean takes a step back, hands on his hips to admire his handiwork. There’s a sheen of sweat on his forehead, and paint on his palms, but it doesn’t really matter because it looks…
They learn together and separate. Sam has a long way to go, but he guides them through the basics— the alphabet, simple phrases. They try to fill in the rest themselves.
Sam rolled his eyes. There was a moment of hesitation, a hitch in his breath, then he said, “You could at least pretend to be happy for me.”
Dean leans back in his seat and his chair knocks into Sam’s. The expression on his face is so overwhelmingly neutral.
And it’s the conjunctions that keep tripping Dean up. The ordering of the sentence. Teaching his hands how to communicate instead of destroy.
Sam holds his glass up to Dean, and he must understand because he grins and taps their drinks together. The beer slides down his throat and Sam thinks,
He drove the rest of the way back hankering for a drink, and the feeling only worsened when he found John waiting up for him.
Cas looks at him, confused. “Dean cooks for me all the time,” He says, as if it were the obvious answer.
A realization strikes him there, in the middle of his bedroom while they’re both splattered with paint and AC/DC is drumming along in the background.
“I’ve thought about kissing you,” Dean says, because it’s the closest to a straight answer he can come up with.
There’s no power to his entrance. No flashing lights or shadow wings— it’s just Cas standing in the middle of the room where he’d died, somehow managing the same theatrics he’d mastered with Grace.
Mostly, though, he thinks about how aggravating it must be to be so fragile when you aren’t raised it. Cas is four billion years old, but he could die from a tumble down the stairs, or a poorly-placed paper cut; A splinter that goes unnoticed and travels in just the right direction into his bloodstream; one hamburger too many; cutting his finger on a piece of rusty metal.
“I need to talk to you about something,” Dean says. He’s straggling near the doorway, one hand shoved into his pants pocket. It’s how Sam knows whatever he’s about to say is serious.
“Uh, no thank you.” He hovers on the other side of the kitchen island. He breathes. It sounds measured. He regards Dean carefully. “Jack told me what you did.”
He thinks about when he was soulless. Without emotion, without want, or love, or guilt, there was still a crushing need to make the Winchesters proud of him. And now he’s staring down the barrel of God’s gun, every squeak of the windshield wipers bringing them a moment closer to... to what, he doesn’t know. The end, maybe. To Nothing.
It isn’t bothering to look human anymore. It’s towering above him, glistening black with beady red eyes.
(“Alright, now what are you going to say when you find it?” Dean had asked when Jack had taken a seat.
“I’ve gotta go,” Dean repeats, and Sam’s expression softened. He nodded, even smiled. Dean refused to give away the knot it eased in his chest.
“You’re not the best interpreter,” She tells him after the third time she’d had to take his palm between her thumb and forefinger.
“What do you think?” Jack steps out of the way and motions to the wall above his bed, where he’s hung up a Star Wars poster he’d snuck into the cart on their latest Walmart run.
Jack dreams often of the car ride back from the silo. It’s all road and the gentle squeak of windshield wipers that desperately need to be replaced. Just outside the range of the headlights, the world is dark.
He feels something move behind him, and he squares his shoulders and tightens his jaw. He summons the commanding stature of Sam, the courage of Dean, the bluntness of Cas. With elements of the three of them, he supposes, he’s as ready for battle as anyone can be.
They aren’t dancing so much as they are stepping in a very slow circle. Dean has one hand on the juncture where Cas’s hip meets his abdomen.
He speaks of her fondly. Regretfully, even, as if the reality of his life was coming into stark focus.
“Look, Cas…” He tenses. The lines in his forehead deepen. He’s readying himself, Dean realizes. Stabilizing. Dean swallows. “I should have said something. Instead of just… But there was a lot happening, and you kept talking, and I— My brain doesn’t work that fast.”
The cover is a drawing of the two of them standing in front of Baby. They’re swarmed on all sides by ghosts. On a barn behind them, the shape of wings is burnt into the wood.
“Look, kid…” Dean stops. “Go to college, don’t go to college… I don’t give a shit. I mean, look how Sammy turned out, and he went to an Ivy League.”
Dean presses the tips of his fingers to her shoulder. “You’ve had it rough, alright? I’d be more concerned if you turned out perfect.”
He starts by taking down the guns he’d mounted on the wall. He unscrews the mounts, and he thinks back to when they’d first moved into the bunker.
The second dinner isn’t scheduled, it just happens. Donna is passing through, and Bobby turns up unannounced, and soon there’s a bunker full of hunters. The kids have taken up one of the tables in the library and covered it with a myriad of art supplies: crayons, and markers, and coloring books. One of them even has those dot markers that Dean had always wanted as a child. They’d been advertised late into the night on old motel cable.
It had made for a lot of budgeted date nights: being in the kitchen, together, finding a rhythm beside each other. Studying, with
Breakfast has become something of a tradition in the bunker, even with Sam breathing down all their necks about eating less red meat, less sugar, less salt, fat, egg yolks. He has, for the most part, resigned himself to drinking his smoothies— he puts
It was like the Alpha’s teeth were set to bite and kill anyone who dared to even look at him, Dean was undoubtedly rigid and unapproachable.
Castiel winced a bit when Dean hugged him but the Omega returned the embrace, scenting the Alpha and imprinting his scent on the little boy, nuzzling against Dean’s soft hair. “I guess mommy fainted.”
Why was there the need to ask for Crowley’s permission in order to destroy everything in their path?
Not the fucking fake Cas in his dreams. Dean could feel it, the surge of adrenaline empowered by anger, he was fucking pissed off. The Omega should be beneath him, screaming Dean’s name and taking his knot. The Alpha was about to get up and rip the sheets apart when a sickening thought made his stomach turn.
The Alpha really didn’t know what to say to that, so Dean shrugged nonchalantly, nervously rubbing the palm of his hands against the side of his thighs. “It was nothing, Cas. I… I’m just glad you’re okay. And if you ever need anything, I’m just a door away.”
Crowley watched with pure delight as the Winchesters took in their new home. But certain rules to living in this brothel was becoming impossible to ignore and although Crowley hated bursting their bubble of happiness, the terms of their verbal contract needed to be stated. And so, Crowley began to state his four rules.
The Omega’s body was practically whining at Castiel to fall onto his knees, to be the whore that every Omega was, and let the Winchesters use him however they desired but a small nagging voice echoed throughout his skull, demanding control which pushed Castiel to ask in a slightly confused tone, “I’m sorry, wh —“
Dean snarled at the pet name coming from the Alpha’s mouth. “What’s the rush, blondie? Cas doesn’t want to go with you, so piss off.”
Which is why the Alpha’s mind wandered over to a blue-eyed enchantress living next door, it was rare and it never happened to Dean but apparently, the Omega’s sweet sucking scent triggered a spontaneous rut.
The Alpha died, like actually died when Castiel responded to his arousal, feeling his eyes rolling into the back of his head. “Don’t stop, Cas.
That was Dean’s main priority but being inside this house and doing nothing… well that made the Alpha feel even worse.
. Dean’s fingers were itching to feel the Omega. The beautiful difference of Dean’s lightly bronzed skin against the Omega’s ashen skin, would drive the Alpha insane.
Lucifer snarled viciously, tightening the collar around Castiel’s neck, enjoying the sight of his Omega being choked to death. “I’m sorry, what did you say, pussycat?”
by the Alphas that were strategically cornering him, blocking all exits and leaving Castiel with no other option but to receive them. Yet the Omega’s mind was lost; all reason and explanation were thrown out the window, the familiar tactic of protecting himself from any Alpha wishing to harm him, was irrelevant.
Henry always believed in the personal touch, making contact with other employees no matter their secondary gender, the Alpha never cared for that. Henry believed in respecting everyone equally. In all fair sense, Henry was way ahead of his time. Bypassing prejudice Alphas who treated Omegas and Betas like they were filth, sex toys, and slaves.
The Omega gently placed his hands against John’s chest, making the Alpha walk backwards until John’s back came in contact with the Impala. “Why don’t we have fun in the back of your car?”
With the strength of a very weak horse, Dean dragged his sore limbs into the cool tiles of his shower, giving himself a harsh scrubbing. The Alpha — with more force than necessary — rubbed against his skin with a washcloth, washing away the pheromones that reeked of sex, cum, and sweat. After showering and deeming himself completely clean, Dean nakedly walked towards his drawer, taking out pajama bottoms that had hot dogs all over it and choosing to be shirtless for the time being.
Dean fastened his lips onto his mother’s thick red nub, moaning in pleasure as the warm liquid landed on his tongue. “You taste so good, mommy.”
Dean possessively lapped at Castiel’s scent gland, drinking down the Omega’s aroma as if he were a lost traveler seeking water and gratefully stumbling upon a waterfall, greedily drinking down every drop and never stopping. Sam, on the other hand, was sucking at Castiel’s neck; his teeth were gnawing into the Omega’s flesh while his lips were covetously delivering an intense suction to Castiel’s skin, as if the Omega were a fruit and Sam wanted nothing more than to tear Castiel away from the fruit’s skin, sucking down every drop of sugar until Sam’s mouth was spilling of the Omega’s taste.
As usual, the diner started to become busy; orders were being taken down while plates of food were being placed in front of hungry customers. After serving eight tables, the Omega reached the last booth and smiled giddily when he recognized the three dapper men — Alphas — sitting together and working on their crossword puzzles.
The Alpha wanted to burst out laughing, he doubted that out of everyone, the Omega would understand the concept of love. Perhaps Castiel understood the basic foundations of what love could be but come on, the Omega’s definition of love was warped, twisted, and perverted.
The Alpha brought his hand towards his face and saw clear bite marks that tore through his bandages.
This wasn’t Sam, the Alpha wasn’t himself at the moment. It was difficult, well that was an understatement, no words could express the longing pain Sam felt when he pulled himself away from the exquisitely gorgeous Omega, but it had to be done. There was such a thing as being a goddamn gentleman and Sam was going to makeup for his foolish behavior, acing his way to Castiel’s heart.
The Omega took a deep breath, exhaling slowly and coming closer to Dean, his pointy nose — which was adorable as fuck — hovering above the Alpha’s scent gland. “Dean.”
It was unbelievable, Castiel was definitely, wifey material. “So, what brings you here, Cas? Are you secretly fattening me up to pay respects to a certain pagan god? Sweet talking me into offering my body as a sacrifice?”
The popular fantasies that the Alpha remembered well enough involved cowboys rescuing the damsel in distress, the pizza man delivering pizza, doctors examining their patients, demons seducing angels, blue eyed Omegas riding his cock, pregnant Omegas lactating and… yeah, the list could go on.
“I’m not telling you to ignore it either. Just keep it cool, man. I’ve never seen you this possessive over an Omega before.”
Dean was about to respond when Rufus noticed Castiel, the older Alpha going from extremely pissed off to flirtatiously insatiable in four seconds.
Castiel gave a small chuckle, reaching for Dean’s hands and resting them over his curvaceously plush hips. “
The Alpha had an idea, well, it was worth a try. “Is there any chance that maybe I could tag along with you guys tomorrow? You know, make it a happy threesome?”
That insanely sweet scent unveiled the raw lust buried beneath Dean’s chest, the Alpha’s canines were sharpening at the prospect of leaving behind an angry bite mark that reeked of an Omega being rightfully claimed by a rogue demon. Dean wanted him, he wanted him
pie. Tell your Omega intuitions that they get 100 pie points for being so freaking awesome. You’re hitting all my sweet spots, Cas. Keep feeding me pie and I’ll be your devoted slave for all eternity.”
Dean shoved Sam to the side, when the younger Alpha grabbed Dean’s shoulder, turning the Alpha around and punching Dean across the face. “Dean! Focus on me, man!”
There were black gates made of iron surrounding the entire area, enclosing the grim mansion displaying its ebony color in full blast. Although its massiveness was overwhelming, it lacked physical attractiveness. Yet the entire area seemed spotless, clean, and well kept. Just by looking at it, you’d believe that this was a murder house vibrating with dead bodies instead of a sleazy brothel.
Which is why the Alpha never stayed with anyone for more than 24 hours, quickly bouncing back onto his feet and fucking someone different for the night. And it is also why Dean never exposed himself to anyone before, he just wanted everyone to see him as the hot Alpha who was a good fuck, which up to this point, he didn’t mind gaining a reputation of being a goddamn sex symbol.
The Alpha instinctively reached forward, ready to embrace the Omega, pushing out calming pheromones to relieve Castiel’s stress, making him feel loved and protected when the Omega stumbled backwards, knocking over the stool behind him.
As of right now, the Alpha still wanted to hurt himself, the pitiful infliction of splitting open his knuckles was not enough pain for him, not nearly close enough. But what could Dean do at the moment? Nothing. Besides wait until the morning light came the next day, promising the chance of a better day.
Dean, on the other hand, was having a blast. During his hugging session with basically every rogue demon in the bar, the Alpha caught sight of Bobby Singer, an old family friend. Dean told his friends that he’d be right back, pushing past the crowds of people to hug the older Alpha from behind. Dean laughed at the way Bobby smacked him upside the head and settled himself next to Bobby, ordering a drink when —
Gabriel growled, cursing loudly while picking up the fork and stabbing the leaves of green with hatred in his veins. “Castiel, this is ridiculous and
The Omega became flustered at the compliment, the previous blush coloring his pretty face was resurfacing in a darker shade of ruby red. “Well, would you like me even more if I told you that I made apple pie along with banana cream pie?”
The Alpha managed to bury the beastly possessiveness overtaking his body. It was difficult and highly impossible but Dean had to do it. The Alpha didn’t want to hurt the Omega and at this point, Dean didn’t trust himself to be alone with Castiel. Maybe this was a mistake. What if the Alpha couldn’t control himself around the Omega and instead of worshipping Castiel, he’d end up hurting him?
Dean always thought that the Omega boy was kind of an odd ball but a sweet kid, and somehow, he kind of understood why Jack got along with Castiel, they were basically the same person. “That’s great, kid. Listen, did he say anything about me? Was he okay? Did he seem hurt? Sad? Angry? Anything?”
Dean lowered his gaze, blinking and looking up at Castiel with his black eyes, the Alpha smiled even more when the smallest whiff of Omega pheromones tainted with fear crawled past his nostrils.
Castiel was about to step forward when he thought better of it, he was about to invade the Alpha’s personal space and the last thing the Omega wanted, was to offend Dean.
They stayed quiet for a bit, staring at each other to the point where it became incredibly awkward, forcing Castiel to speak up. “Um, is there —“
Chuck came to stand beside Dean. “I can’t believe you got to my son. He’s never acted this way before. Especially with someone he
It was obvious that Crowley made large amounts of money by simply owning rent boys and selling them off to customers who would pay any price to fuck them. That idea alone made Sam and Dean doubt their decision in accepting Crowley’s offer. After exiting the car that picked them up and drove them all the way to Crowley’s brothel, they stood before two large Victorian doors decorated with spooky knockers shaped in the form of evil demons.
Castiel could feel his skin crawling at the foul words being directed towards him, it was almost as if he were in the presence of Lucifer himself. “What is your problem? Why are you saying these things to me? You’re getting offended because I used the word
Dean was nervous, anxious even, for the Alpha felt like he was approaching the door to the boy who was his prom date, a child basically dressed up as an adult to his impress his crush. Thankfully, Dean’s hands were full and he could distract himself for a while but if he were to be honest with himself, this wasn’t exactly the way he wanted to introduce himself to the Omega of his dreams.
Dean stood at the doorway to his bedroom, happily admiring his handiwork and feeling slightly better at returning everything to its natural state. The anger bottled up inside him had finally died down, the Alpha wasn’t filled with wrathful rage, instead, he was at ease. Dean remained quiet, silently blending into the non-moving ambient of his home when the Alpha felt a twinge of burning pain.
The Omega yelped in surprise when Dean practically consumed Castiel’s tiny frame with his massive body. The Omega could feel himself being pressed further into the workbench; it was painful but the hand on his hip slowly shifted towards his lower back. The back of Dean’s hand was against the workbench while the soft flesh of Castiel’s body was against the Alpha’s firm grip.
The Omega was breathing loudly, chuckling nervously while Castiel’s hands made their way towards the Alpha’s jeans. The Omega undid the zipper to John’s jeans, barely taking hold of the Alpha’s heavy girth. John was huge and Castiel needed to use both hands to hold all of John’s length. The sounds ripping through John’s throat were rabid, dark, and unholy in a deliciously twisted way.
As the car approached the house, Sam and Dean could see a circular pool with clear blue water that spilled over a small waterfall, located at the front of the house. Next to the pool, there was a small set of stairs that led to a lower level where a small eating area with four lounging chairs decorated with red fluffy pillows surrounded a marble table in the middle.
John growled hungrily, baring his teeth as his broad hands cupped Castiel’s pecs, pinching the Omega’s thickly rounded nipples and drinking in the beautiful sounds escaping Castiel’s full lips. The Alpha grabbed the lapels of the Omega’s romper and with a rough force, tore the front of Castiel’s romper apart.
The Omega nodded, forcing a smile. “I fell down the stairs. Happens all the time. I’m very clumsy with my feet and well, a simple trip and down I went.”
As Castiel led Jack towards the front door, the Omega boy turned to face the Omega, radiantly smiling up at Castiel who was only taller than him by an inch. “It was really nice meeting you, Castiel.”
The Winchester Company had five divisions: Marketing, Finance, Operation Management, Human Resource, and IT. Under Henry’s ruling, there were hundreds of Omegas occupying every department. A wonderful triumph in Henry’s book. While the Alpha was president, his second in command was his son, John Winchester.
Then with red colored cheeks taking over his complexion along with a hint of embarrassment reeking through his pores, the younger Alpha awkwardly stuck out his hand and introduced himself. “I’m John, John Winchester.”
Chuck’s bright aura seemed to fade at the question, a melancholy smile on his face. “She passed away.”
Of course, attaining shelter and food was commonly easy but not without a price. As it is well known, nothing in this world was free. Dean, being the eldest brother, had certain childlike features that aroused the disgusting hunger buried beneath the belly of older men with unresolved tendencies of fucking a minor.
“She’s an Alpha magnet, Sammy. Her ass, that thing bounces with every step she takes and her tits. Let’s just say I’m willing to go into town with them. Just
Without trying to sound like a creep, Crowley admitted to seeing Sam and Dean leaving their motel room late at night and returning at ungodly hours. To those who didn’t pay attention, Sam and Dean were seen as young boys living their lives to the fullest, spending most of their nights outdoors and getting wasted.
to reach the Omega in his own way. But instead, he was sickeningly greeted by the nebulous void consuming the darkened shadows swallowing and crushing the bright halo that illuminated the Omega in such a virtuous and holy way.
Dean entered the kitchen, the air filling up with pheromones blossoming from the grumpiness that radiated from the Alpha. Dean turned on the coffee machine, waiting patiently until the coffee pot was filled with coffee. The Alpha filled up a large amount of caffeine into his mug and leaned against the kitchen island, mindlessly staring at the house next door and sipping at his coffee.
But in The Winchester Company, Henry fought for equal rights. A certain flaw that made every Omega and Beta fall in love with him. Sadly, Henry’s open-minded perspective didn’t reach his son, John Winchester. John — with great pleasure — didn’t take after his father. From a young age, John’s views on Omegas were clouded, toyed with, and manipulated by societal opinions.
“Sam, son. You must understand that Alphas cannot do this job. We are more important than Omegas and we will not lose our honor to be seen as an elevator boy. Which is why, Mr Novak and I agreed that we must have a trial run, to see if having elevator workers are our style. If it suits us, we’ll begin the process of hiring Omegas within the following week.”
Dean was quite pleased with John’s change in the company because now, Omegas had no other option but to obey every command given by the Winchesters. Sam, on the other hand, took after his grandfather, Henry Winchester. The Alpha believed in his grandfather’s point of view; adopting the personal touch, respecting Omegas, and offering Omegas the chance to work in any job position without judgment.
, Dean wanted to covet the Omega as if he were the most rarest and purest diamond found amongst the mountains. Dean’s heart was wildly pumping against his chest, skipping a beat and going faster by the minute.
The houses that came into view were small, the neighborhood seemed mediocre and the townspeople seemed friendly enough. Castiel was bubbling with curiosity, never had he seen a town where its population mostly consisted of enormous families with happy smiles on their faces. The children running freely through the nicely trimmed yards were the closest thing to freedom that the Omega has ever seen since he was a child.
Castiel panicked for a second, gripping the flowers tightly and looking around as if someone might be hearing them. “I’m sorry?”
Castiel reached towards Dean, mindlessly wiping away the stream of blood cascading down his bleeding lip. “Honey, it’s okay.”
With the clock striking 8:30 am, the front doors to the diner were pushed open and the owner of the diner waltzed in like he was the hottest Alpha in all of Kansas and without a beat of hesitation, all the workers greeted their Alpha boss. “Good morning, Gabriel!”
Sam willed himself to calm down, pinching the bridge of his nose and taking deep breaths. “Yes, come in.”
Dean looked back at the Omega and smiled happily, using his gruff voice to say, “Hiya new neighbor.”
The Alpha managed to swallow the first bite and began to repeat the process, god eating greens was vile. “So, catch me up. How’s everything here?”
John continued speaking, “Other than my ego being stroked by my most trusted colleagues, we’ve had certain complaints from neighboring companies who visit and do business with us. Many find it offensive that we lack in workers who run the elevators. Pushing a button themselves is tiring and exhausting, and it demonstrates to other powerful companies, especially competing ones, that we don’t have enough money to hire someone who can perform that task for them.”
Of course, The Winchester Company has been owned through a bloodline of Alphas bearing the Winchester name with pride and an overgrown ego. The Winchester family has been known to mate with Omegas with a background glimmering with a well-known title along with wealthy roots that reached through secret rooms stashed with crispy new green bills of money.
Castiel reluctantly pressed his hands against his feeble chest, terrified of how the situation escalated in dangerous degrees but somehow, finding the strength to rest the palm of his hands against the Alpha’s beefy pecs. The touch was soothing, never had the Alpha been so
The Omega was never prepped during sex. Nor did Lucifer ever take the time to make sure that his cock was dripping with his Omega’s slick, making sure that every violent thrust against Castiel’s prostate was pleasurable for him and his Omega. As always, Lucifer never cared if Castiel was in pain, in fact, the sounds of the Omega’s pained screams during sex aroused the Alpha even more.
The following wounds made Dean sick to his stomach; the Omega’s plump lips were split open, tearing the sensitive flesh down the middle line located between the Omega’s upper and lower lip. It was tough to ignore the wave of burning red flesh being exposed, and along with the horrible abuse sticking to the Omega’s skin, there was a deep cut running from the corner of the Omega’s mouth to the side of his chin.
think of me? You think just because you have an idea of who I am, that gives you the right to believe that whatever you say, is the exact representation of who I am.”
the final scent that left Castiel completely wrecked. The aroma of skin being stained with engine oil, the splashes of gasoline sloshing against a red canister, and dirty rags that were filthy of greasy residue. Absolutely perfect. Masculine in every way possible. And to top that, the smell of a hardworking green eyed mechanic sweating underneath the morning sun, the salty rivers of sweat gliding down the glaciers of his back, and seeping through his shirt in a sensually forbidden way.
The Alpha instantly made grabby hands towards both pies, his stomach growling in ravenous hunger when Dean paused to look up at Castiel. “Wait, Cas. You didn’t have to do this for me. I mean, I really appreciate the gesture but you didn’t have to repay me back. My intentions weren’t to make you feel like you
Dean didn’t do anything. And the Alpha’s faulty trait of building the endless fury pumping through his veins was becoming more difficult to ignore. And Dean hated himself more than anything because it was such a natural sensation that kicked into his body, he couldn’t control it, the only method he knew of taking out his anger was hurting others or himself.
they were only a breath away from kissing each other when Castiel awkwardly offered his hand to Dean. “Castiel Novak.”
Lucifer smirked, trying to steal a kiss from Castiel’s mouth when Dean ripped Lucifer away from his mother. “He said get the fuck off him!”
Omegas will forever be seen as precious sex objects; their bodies useful for sex, breeding, producing as many pups as possible, and most importantly, servicing Alphas and their carnal urges. Betas and Omegas deserved more than bias perspectives tainting their secondary gender but, in a society, ruled by Alphas, that dream seemed like a long shot.
Dean pulled away, feeling himself becoming drunk at the sight of the Omega being breathless. “I know you’re right here, sweetheart.
If the Alpha wasn’t careful, his heart was in danger of exploding in his chest. It was seriously frightening, the way Dean and Castiel kept gazing at each other, neither of them daring to look away. It made the Alpha feel absolutely naked in front of the Omega, letting his soul being exposed so easily without putting up a fight and miraculously, letting Castiel see him for who he was, something Dean has never done before.
’ part slip past his mouth, sue him, Castiel was perfect! And due to his comment, the Omega’s cheeks were redder than a whole cherry field waiting to be plucked.
Dean could feel the wired cord tugging at his heart, constricting his chest, and making it difficult to breathe. And that was enough to make the Alpha realize that the Omega next door was beyond special. Dean felt the Alpha inside him instinctively wanting to protect the Omega from any harm existing in this world, the Alpha knew that there was a reason why he so drawn to the angelic Omega living just next door.
The Omega had a tray in his hand with a cup of coffee, his free hand resting on his hip while lifting the tray next to his head and falling into the same welcoming position he did everyday.
Cas looks at him with his trademark, bug-eyed stare. He licks his lip and takes a sharp breath in. “Dean,” He starts, “I have been alive for four hundred billion years. I’ve witnessed every human extinction— Aided in some of them, but you were the first piece of proof that humans are more than pieces on a chess board you clear when you’re losing. Without you, there would
Dean reached over and turned up the radio volume. If Sam had anything else to say, it was drowned out by Lynyrd Skynyrd.
Cas blinks, then nods. “I managed to get the cassette player to work,” He explains. “It was very dusty.”
“Hey! I’m telling the story.” Dean glares at him, and Sam has to bite his lip to keep from laughing in his face.
It’s the first room he’s really had. Whenever he tries to remember their house in Lawrence, all he can picture is an ever-growing rotation of cheap motels.
Jack stares into the darkness and he waits. Existing like this is different than existing on Earth. On Earth, he can feel his body living: his heart pumps, there’s a faint rush in his ears, joints meet resistance when he moves them. Here, he feels as Nothing as the Nothing around him. Like air, or fog.
“He said he loves me,” Dean said after a grueling silence. “Before he...” The Winchesters are no stranger to death, but Dean’s voice caught on the word.
and hoping it makes enough sense for Eileen to pass him the toast and the butter. She does, with upticked lips and soft lines around her eyes.
He teaches him to curl his fingers back so it’s his knuckles exposed instead of the soft flesh of his fingers. He also teaches him to hold the onion from way, way farther back.
And then, of course, he had, and now it’s all he ever thinks about. The remnants of prayer, he supposes.
There’s some letters, too, from after he’d moved to Ireland. He’d been friendly enough with some of the members to keep in touch.
It took everything inside the Alpha to not lurch forward and grab Castiel, keeping the Omega from leaving. “God, no.
It was obvious that John was doing everything in his power to not jump up and down in excitement. “Your place or mine?”
Castiel rolled his eyes, leaving Gabriel’s office and definitely not hearing the raw words of lust and hunger directed towards the pastry left in the Alpha’s care. The diner wasn’t even open for five minutes when the Omega spotted nine tables in use. Of course, all the people inhabiting the diner were regular customers.
Castiel, by all means. The Alpha felt his body burning with a flaming passion to mark the Omega as his. Dean was on the verge of shoving Castiel against the wall, turning the Omega around and wrenching the collar of Castiel’s sweater to the side, giving no mercy and ripping through the Omega’s claimed scent gland with his teeth.
Dean’s scent was vigorously potent; the Omega was surrounded by heavy masses of dark grey clouds, the smell of firewood burning through the cracks of strong trees and their indestructible bark, the freshly exploding sounds of pine cones being cooked by the sea of flames caused by forest fires, and the smoky fragrance of whiskey rolling around Castiel’s mouth, burning as it went down his throat.
Garth got off the bed, looking down at the pile of clothes and facing Castiel with a worried look. “Oh boy.”
During spontaneous ruts, the wait time for his knot to go away was pretty damn short. The anger building inside the Alpha was slowly turning into lust again.
“And every bone in your body until your stupid ass can’t even get up to take a piss.” Bobby said through gritted teeth.
Dean licked his lips, settling his gaze on Castiel as the Omega continued touching his hands, that is until Castiel languidly caught the admiration pouring from the Alpha’s emerald green eyes, their locked gazes intensifying by the second. “Your hands are nice. Strong yet gentle.”
long time for the Omega proceeded to do the most cutest thing ever known to this boring ass earth. The Omega was evidently confused for he squinted his eyes and formed the most adorable pout on his mouth. And
Dean witnessed the Omega being raped, and the smothering guilt clogging at his throat was like letting Death’s bony fingers choke the life out of him, snapping bones and clipping at his warm skin with sharp pliers.
Sitting silently for more than five minutes together led to nothing except the continuation of the Alpha’s light dabbing of the cotton ball against the Omega’s cuts. Castiel would coyly rake his eyes over Dean’s broad shoulders, the clear statement that the Alpha was powerfully strong, making the Omega feel a bit intimidated yet aroused at Dean’s dominating strength.
cuddle bunny, for the Alpha was a major beast when it came to cuddling. Dean would probably suffocate Castiel with his bear-like affection, which was difficult to resist by the way.
of the door being opened, a blonde woman greeted them with a large smile and a bear hug that was sweetly suffocating. “Hiya boys!
Castiel purred as he came even closer, invading Dean’s personal space and hovering his lips over the Alpha’s, teasing Dean while looking up at the Alpha with his round doe eyes. “And if I say no?”
The Alpha tiredly sighed while slipping into his pajama bottoms — which were awesomely super soft — and dragging his feet towards the bathroom door. Dean pulled off a gray robe resting on the hook. The Alpha sleepily put on his robe, not even bothering to tie the sash around his waist and deciding to stay home.
And after three hard thrusts, the Alpha’s knot was swelling, growing in length and stretching the Omega’s rim. Dean remained still, grunting at the unbearable sensation eating his body alive but man did it feel good. Castiel couldn’t help the ruined sounds of his screams ripping through his throat, the Alpha’s knot kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
He’d never pictured himself kissing another man, not in the casual way he’d thought about women. Hadn’t pictured kissing Cas until he’d actually done it. Hadn’t considered it an option.
Then there was Benny, the lines of whose face Dean found himself following in the glow of the fire. They tended to sit closer together than most people, held each other by the jaw when they were injured. That was it, though, and that was Purgatory. A place with no hope.
“She hasn’t stopped talking about it,” Claire agrees in a lower tone. “I’ve given so many mock interviews.”
To his right, more laughter breaks out. Sam and Eileen snap their attention back to the rest of the group.
“Yeah, basically.” Sam clears his throat. “Jack seems to think he can do it, which means we just have to find him.”
He talked about her mother, mostly. How she’d been getting along well in Ireland— he’d been worried about that. It’s a big change. He talked about teaching her spells, about how he almost wished she wouldn’t have to know about the bitter dangers in the world.
Eileen marches into the kitchen still half-asleep. Her hair is pulled into a messy bun, and she’s got a Monday morning scowl painting her face. She’s wearing one of Sam’s shirts and a pair of boxer shorts.
Dean rubs at the back of his neck. “I… Uh… I didn’t leave him hanging,” He finally chokes out, just as Sam’s about to remind him that
“Not always,” Cas says. “Though, I had forgotten… How needy a human body is.” He pauses thoughtfully. “Maybe Chuck will grow to regret his actions.”
Studying with Cas is a lot different than studying with Sam used to be. For one thing, there’s no imminent threat of bedbugs. For another, Cas takes less shit.
It was all Jody, all Alex, all… Determination and good parenting. Her graduation cap was askew, but she was grinning.
He cracks open the paint and stirs it. This is no different than any of the odd jobs he’s taken over the years, save for the fact that he’s the one who picked out the color.
just about make Dean break out in hives. But how can he say no to Cas, after everything. After Dean has heard his voice bouncing around in his head for weeks. After tiptoeing, and avoiding, and handprints. Isn’t Cas worth a rash?
Dean stares out the windshield. He can feel Sam’s gaze on him. Can sense the disappointment coming off of him in waves. The kid is too hopeful, has too much faith. “No,” He lies again. “It’s the right thing to do.”
Dean shrugs. “There’s another paintbrush in the bag,” He says, motioning behind him to where the package was open on his bed.
He’s had a glow about him lately. Normally, Dean would make some joke about how he’d finally gotten laid and it had knocked loose the stick stuck up his ass, but he doesn’t want to break whatever zen has come over Sam. It’s too nice to see him like this, in puppy love or whatever.
He’s interrupted by Dean pulling him in for a tight hug. Cas smells like paint, and laundry detergent. He tentatively wraps his arms around Dean’s back.
She’s been doing good, too. Staying with Jody, sometimes hunting with Claire. She’d found stability.
Dean purses his lips. “Didn’t need to. Thought I’d give him a taste of his own medicine. Humanity’s a bitch.” He remembers his company and falters. “I mean—“
It’s the only personalized thing in the room if you don’t count the sweater hanging over the back of the chair in the corner.
He was aware of it in a tangential way, in his periphery. How sometimes his stomach would knot up a guy would smile at him. How he wanted to be John Wayne so bad that sometimes it felt like he was bursting at the seams. How, sometimes, a guy would lock eyes with him from across the bar and he’d feel that feeling again,
Sam made direct eye contact with the passenger’s side mirror. “Y’know, If I’d have known you were going to act like this, I would have taken a bus.”
Someone demands a speech just as they start moving to gather their plates. It starts as a rumble, then rises to a chant. Dean just raises his beer, says, “To free will,” and winks.
“Once or twice,” Cas says. He puts his hand just under the stalactite of Dean’s ribs. “A very long time ago.”
They pull apart, and Dean’s a little dazed. Swept off his feet, like some kind of storybook princess, a damsel in distress, and he’s about to make a joke about it except Cas is staring at him with wider eyes than usual and whatever he’s going to say goes out the window when his mouth dries up.
Dean wakes up to the smell of burning rubber. There’s a thin, smoky fog in the hallway, and he follows it into the kitchen.
“Jack, hey—“ Sam grips his elbow to ground him. Jack hovers in the air for a dazed moment, life rushing back into him. Sam knows the feeling, the sudden rush in his ears, the crack of his joints.
“I, uh—“ He clears his throat, tries to lean against the doorframe in a cool, bad-boy-sorta-way instead of
Cas’s arms end up full of dress shirts and pants as he stands in a miscellaneous aisle surrounded by a handful of records, a couple lamps, one of those beaded curtains from the seventies, and, of course, the cassette player.
Dean drags his gaze elsewhere, to where Bobby is standing alone, hunt-and-pecking out a message on his cellphone. He grumbles, rapid-fires on the backspace button, starts over again. Then he pulls a flask out of his jacket and takes a swig. Dean’s eyes catch on it, and he elbows Sam to get his attention.
“So who kills who?” Dean asks, leaning forward to get a look at the blurb at the back of the book. “I kill Sam, God kills me kind of deal?”
Sam nods. He wracks his brain and tries to put together a coherent response but what comes out is, “Hey, are you burning that?”
Dean steps a little bit closer to Cas and he tries to imagine the past. Maybe in this bunker, maybe in caves, or gymnasiums, or docks, or saloons— dancing, just to be close to someone else for a little while. Someone who smells like sandalwood, whose palms tickle his ribs. To Elvis, or Bach, or Led Zeppelin, to the sound of rain.
“No, uh…” Sam clears his throat. “You kill Cas and then…” Dean stiffens. Sam flips the page. “And then the rest is… Open for interpretation.”
“You’ve made that clear.” Dean says it with a smile, but she just rolls her eyes. He shoulders her gently. “Hey, I didn’t go to college, I turned out fine.”
Sam shrugs. “Get this, though. A family in New Jersey was found with their lungs ripped out and their bodies, quote, ‘drained of blood.’”
He tapes where the floor and the wall meet, the sharp corners of the doorframe. It’s a ritual like any other.
Jack frowned up at Dean. “My name is Jack Kline, you killed my father, prepare to die— That doesn’t really work,
“It doesn’t taste as bad as it smells,” Jack offers from the table, though the plate of food (can it even be called that? It looks more like compost) isn’t even half eaten.
Dean threw his hands up in surrender. “Just checking.” He watched Sam pitch his bag over his shoulder and fumble with the box. “Look, I gotta get back before Dad wakes up. You good to take all that up yourself?”
They get in the car, and suddenly Dean is twenty-two years old, gripping the steering wheel, sitting in a simmering silence as he drives the dark highways of California. The memory plants itself in his chest like a rock.
Sam rolls his eyes. “I want to find Kevin. It just… It doesn’t sit right with me that he’s…” He waves his hand. “And I figured that, y’know, with Jack—“
Dean tries to pass off the speech he gave, he really does. He repeats his own words confidently until a roll hits him in the face.
“Where’s Eileen that she’s missing out on this… lovely breakfast?” Dean asks, plugging his nose to grab the coffeepot.
“Alright,” Dean is saying around a mouthful of meatloaf. “So we show up to the park and these people are dressed up. I’m talking fantasy shit, straight out of Lord of the Rings.”
Castiel was on the brink of fainting when Dean began to consume the Omega’s scent from the source, clasping his lips around Castiel’s scent gland and sucking at the skin with animalistic vigor. The Omega’s eyes fluttered closed, inhaling sharply at the hot suction against his skin when to his right, Sam Winchester began to rub his face against Castiel’s, covering the Omega with his own scent.
The Alpha boys straightened themselves up, waving back at Castiel and doing their best to show off their strength to the Omega. Castiel chuckled fondly at their determination of wooing him but Castiel died of pure shame when all the Alphas shouted, “
Maybe it’s the dark cloud that seems to be looming over Eileen’s head, maybe it’s that he wants to keep Cas from asking any more questions about Mrs. Butters, but Dean works up the courage to sign,
Jody and the girls have shoved in beside Bobby and across Charlie. Kaia and Claire sit so close together it’s hard to tell where their jackets end and they become two different people. Jack is tucked in beside Cas, who’s taken a seat across from Claire and is squinting at the cell phone she's holding out to him.
When he pulled away, he watched out the rearview until he couldn’t make out Sam’s towering form anymore.
A long, cold moment passed. He could have let it go, could have made a joke or said nothing at all, but loneliness is a festering wound and Dean had never learned how to treat it, so he barked, “I don’t know what you want me to say, Sammy. Good for you? Congrats on being too good for us?”
“Eileen is moving in,” Sam starts. “And, you know, I think it would be nice if we could all…” He opens his laptop to a Youtube video. In front of a white background, a man is making hand gestures as captions show up on the screen.
“She will be,” Dean says, opening the door. “When she gets out of her own head. What are you thinking for dinner?”
“I’ll get better,” He promises. He turns her hand over in his, locks their thumbs together, and presses a kiss to her knuckles. “I’ve got time.”
After everything, after losing her twice, Sam thinks he could watch her laugh forever. She corrects him with a crooked grin, and reaches across the table to move his thumb over, or twist his wrist, and the pads of her fingers are warm.
That night, Sam dreams of fire and blood on his pillow, and he wakes with Eileen’s hair in his mouth.
“I think that’s a great idea, Sam,” Cas says before Dean can stick his foot in his own mouth. “It would be nice to be able to communicate fully with her.”
It still feels like a dream, being alive. Having her here, with his biggest problem being a werewolf running free in Pennsylvania. When was the last time he had that?
“He’s your soulmate!” Claire yells, and Alex responds, “He collects stamps! I hate you so much!” And Jack urges, “Can’t you just ignore the message?”
He pulls his head back, mouth open, ready to ask a question, or say Dean’s name, or make another connection to some bible story Dean had never sat through Sunday school to learn, so Dean just kisses him to preemptively shut him up.
“What’s Braveheart?” Jack asks innocently, and then winces when the table shouts over each other to rag on him.
(Dean feels the steel chill of a gun in his hand and he clenches his fist until he’s warmed it back up.)
Jack and Cas, however, are impressive. Dean blames it on Jack’s grace and Cas’s four hundred billion or whatever years of life.
He’d gone to Sam’s high school graduation, cheered loud enough for an entire family when his name had been called. Watched him shake hands with the principal and give some speech about perseverance or some other, similar bullshit. He hadn’t expected to end up back here, though, standing at the top of bleachers. It had felt like a one-time thing. A fluke.
Sam keeps his mouth shut and Castiel, the trench-coated traitor, says, “I believe it was a vanilla latte.”
There was always a part of Sam that believe in Dean more than Dean was ever capable of believing in himself. A part that urged him on, slid a crudely edited essay across the table to him and said, “Re-write it.” He threatened, a decent amount of times, to let Dean turn in whatever shit paper he’d come up with, but they were all empty threats. He wanted Dean to succeed— believed that he
A figure appears in the doorway. Dean glances up, then looks back at where his paintbrush is dragging down the wall.
Dean shakes his head. “That’s not what I’m trying to—“ He sighs. Opens his mouth, closes it. Tries to coerce his tongue into lasso-ing his thoughts. “I thought I’d lost you. Again. You know, it felt like some point of no return bullshit, and I tried to… I can’t picture a future
Cas isn’t a slow learner, but common sense isn’t built into his brain the way it is theirs. Despite his past brushes with humanity, it’s habit to grab a hot cast-iron pan, and it doesn’t occur to him that if he starts smelling natural gas he should turn the stove off.
awkward. Ever since Cas came back, they’ve been playing a fucking game of freeze tag, catching each other’s eye and clamming up until someone else shows up or the subject gets changed. It’s conversation suicide, really, because Dean doesn’t want to be the one to bring it up— they all say dumb things when they’re about to die, and he doesn’t want to hear Cas tell him that that’s all it was. Something said out of desperation. Final repentance.
