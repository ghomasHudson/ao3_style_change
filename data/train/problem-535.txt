Babbling, pleading, lost.

trouble, John?”
Dinner lasts over three hours, their food mostly growing cold as they try to fit eating in between the talking. At differing points they each come close to needing the Heimlich (and Victor does know how to perform it) as they choke on curry puffs and rad na over stories of John and Sherlock dressed up as ninjas, and the time that Sherlock burned all his hair off in chemistry lab, and remedied this with wigs until his hair grew back.
Madam Pomfrey returned after a while, as she had said she would do, and this time she brought a steaming vial of  greenish-brown potion. Sherlock first took her to task for being ten minutes later than she said she would be, and then he demanded to know what was in the potion and every step to making it, and then he wanted to know if somehow the ingredients could have been tampered with, unbeknownst to her.
,” he said again, as if trying out how to say the name right, like John did, when trying out a new word that he’d just learnt. Sherlock smiled to himself, then, the kind of smile you got when you’d just had a sweet and it tasted particularly nice.
“That’s not what Bill means,” Mike said quickly. “There have been rumours about you
And maybe the pustule that Sherlock had just popped had been particularly satisfying, because he was smiling at his plant now.
The kiss deepened. Sherlock’s lips cradling his, and his tongue- first flickering, and then slipping into John’s mouth. His tongue was cold, too, as if he’d been sucking on ice cubes just a minute ago, an image that made John shiver first and then run hot.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” John says, honestly.
“Well, yes,” Sherlock agreed. “But don’t you want to be best friends, for a very, very long time?” He looked at John earnestly.
John could hear Sherlock’s heartbeat when he rested his cheek against his chest. He was so warm. When John breathed in he could smell him, leather and cigarettes and warm scent of musk, wholesome, clean laundry smell of his shirt. Due to their height difference they slotted together perfectly, John’s head tucked underneath Sherlock’s chin. John had always felt a bit peeved that he had never quite gotten that growth spurt everyone had promised him would happen as he got older, but in times like this, maybe he didn’t mind it so much.
And John, he’s never felt so stupid, knees and elbows bruised up from practice, hair wet and flat against his head from his shower, shirt sticking uncomfortably to his skin because he didn’t have the patience to wait to dry properly. He’s parceled out to awkward pieces under that look, indexed down to his smudged glasses and the spot he forgot to wash behind his ear.
murder, which was just as good. Not the murder of Muggles part, that was terrible, and really he didn’t think Sherlock was one of
Sherlock turned to him, and the moonlight was on his skin, and the night was in his hair, and the slight curve of a smile rested on his full lips and despite the glacial color of his eyes John felt everything but ice.  He shifted uncomfortably in his seat, shifted his gaze to the movie screen.
And so Sherlock had known the altercation with Powers would escalate the moment he saw the boy with the red-marked Charms quiz clutched in his hand. He had predicted that a crowd would gather and that none of them would offer any assistance: Bystander Effect. What he had not accounted for was John Watson, who was baffling and fascinating in the extent to which he baffled him.
He dared not give it voice. It was a terrible thing he wanted, but what frightened him was how little he cared that it was sinful and bad.
the way in which two or more concepts, objects, or people are connected, or the state of being connected.
,” mumbled Sherlock, wallowing in his misery. On top of everything else, he now had to deal with the idea of having a completely useless overachieving brother, as well, who thought that the cure for everything was just sitting here and doing nothing and rubbing his back in a most annoying manner.
“Oh,” said John, and bit his lip. “But what about my friends and family?”
Patsy Cline was singing on the radio,
“You’re getting your nice robes all bloody,” John said, distressed. He knew how expensive robes were because Mum had stressed that he had to be very careful, and he knew how expensive
“Those are some rather heavy allegations, Mr. Powers,” Professor Hudson noted.
He saw them later, chasing each other in the water, giggling and splashing and acting silly. He looked back to where Mummy sat, higher up on the beach, in her hat and sunglasses. She was busy reading her book with the shirtless muscley man on the cover who was struggling to hold up a lady in what appeared to be some sort of windstorm.  Daddy snoozed on the beach blanket, the radio crackling out the game, and if John listened real hard, he thought he could hear him snore.
John swayed on his little feet, standing there in the middle of the hallway. The movement was small and graceful, almost as if he were moving to some music that she could not hear. His eyes were closed.
Then-
It’s frighteningly normal, the way they sit at the breakfast table together. John doesn’t feel like he’s any different. He doesn’t think his genes have recoded themselves in the time they were sleeping. He doesn’t have any urges to go clubbing or see a musical or pick up an interest in fashion. The world seems much the same, as well. Victor’s Belgian waffles still taste amazing, and his coffee still tastes like shit.
Dusk has settled upon the cornfield, the sky deepening in bands of colors. They’ve missed the sunset entirely. John doesn’t know when the light fades and the stars flicker into being.
The stranger, in a gravely serious voice, tells John that he is a rum-runner. A man who is capable of anything.
They were all so very
John hesitated. He'd never seen this boy around before, he was certain of it. But the rules were getting fuzzy in his head.
“Sherlock’s hair is actually kind of a really dark brown if you see it in the sun,” John said.
It was too much vulnerability. John felt silly and exposed. Sherlock pressed a soft, affectionate kiss to the side of John’s face, and then his neck, dropped another one on his collarbone. He pulled back to look at John with his mesmerizing, memorizing stare, touching himself through his jeans, palming and rubbing at his own cock. John didn’t feel so silly anymore. Still very exposed.
the time? You don’t think that rules aren’t
It didn’t matter. He really needed to get some sleep.
“We do not raise our hands or wands to anyone. We never resort to violence. If you have a problem with another student, you come directly to me and I will help you resolve it. If someone is bullying you or you know someone is being bullied, you tell me immediately and I will mete out the proper punishments and help you deal with the issue,” Professor Hudson said. “That goes for all of you.”
Sherlock shrugs and lights a cigarette. John reaches over and plucks it out of his mouth.  Sherlock has the dignity to look irritated instead of immediately snatching it back.
With his tongue darting over the seam of John’s lips, he had tasted him, he had learned him. He had calculated the amount of time he had for maximum enjoyment before John pushed him off, and it had come out to an average of 86 seconds.
Two thoughts occur simultaneously: one, that John Watson, for all of a little idiot that he is, can have brilliant illuminations sometimes, can have the ability to see deep down to the cut to the quick, and two, that he must be shamefully, painfully obvious if he is so plainly read. Then there is no room for thoughts at all because he is pulling John towards him and kissing him on his sweet, promising mouth.
on John’s lips. He kissed him with bruising force, pushing him down onto the bed. With both hands he grabbed John’s wrists, the way he had wanted to, and John arched beneath him, making a little sound into the kiss. Sherlock rubbed his still mostly-clothed body against John’s naked one, earning him a gasp from the rush of friction against a now-eager erection.
“John?” Sherlock smoothed down a patch of blond hair sticking out at angles from when John had run his fingers through his hair, muttering something about an octopussy. For a man modest and conservative in public displays of his sexuality, he had an odd fascination with octopus genitalia.
“Excuse me?” said John.
“Oh my god,” says Victor. “Yes, that story! Tell me
John wakes up, shoulder aching and leg aching from having spent the night all twisted up on the sofa, and the other half of his body completely numb from having someone else’s body crushing him. His skin is sweaty, sticky and hot in all the places that they’re pressed together.
“Fine, what
The way Sherlock took up space reminded John, again, of a storybook panther, prowling in the night, black and languid as ink. Fear and excitement fluttered inside of him. He had to make a move - Sherlock stood tall before him, waiting, watching with his panther-eyes. Again, that feeling of inexplicable dread, a voice inside that said
Had the walls always been so tight and close? There seemed to be no space in between the stone and the rows of wooden pews. Had the windows always been so large? The hard, unforgiving wood of the pew pressed back on his thighs.
“I’ll be careful not to ruin anything,” Victor says as he sets his bag down in the far corner of Sherlock’s room.
and that she was
“You little
Afterwards, his mortifying condition went away; the feeling of dirtiness remained.
The sun was shining bright on a Saturday afternoon, so they headed down to the beach as a family.
“Don’t wink at me like that if I’m innocent,” said John.
The touch went unnoticed in favour of replying to an anonymous question. “What
All the boss stuff.
John wondered what Sherlock’s owl could possibly have to do with school disciplinary measures. Then again, ever since the day he’d found out he was a wizard, he’d learned to accept extraordinary things in his life with very little surprise. And anything to do with Sherlock Holmes, it seemed, was extra extraordinary.
You’re very lucky I found them before they started to smell and alerted the rest of your Housemates to their decaying presence.”
The tide. John had stood there on the wet sand and watched as the waves flooded over him and then retreated, pulling with it sand and bits of seaweed. Over and over the waves washed up on the sand and washed away again. Little by little, the water had washed away her little boy. He could have been caught in a riptide, he could have been tugged out to sea. He was a good swimmer but what was a small boy against the force of an ocean?
Ella says that John is getting better.
“Thank you, Bill,” said John. “I am deeply touched that you would tell a great many lies on my behalf. That’s almost Slytherin of you.”
The digits on the clock glowed red:
Mycroft looked at him, unimpressed.
John jerked back from the flash going off in his face, cursing as hot tea splattered down the front of his jumper and jeans. “Fucking
Searches in the woods surrounding the Watson residence at 10 Chelmsford Street have turned up nothing thus far. Neighbors state that they have not noticed anything out of the ordinary.
Victor tugs restlessly at the duvet. “I tried to get him to give it up. You can imagine how well that went, getting Sherlock Holmes to do something he doesn’t want to.
He put both hands on the sides of John’s neck.
see you all next time.....
They’re meant to be tidying up, John knows, but all that seems to be happening is making more mess. Or rather, moving mess around, as he opens folders and shows Victor their crime scene photos and newspaper articles: “Junior Minister Suicide After Drink Binge;” “Journalist Slain in Impossible Murder” - acting as tour guide through his life with Sherlock.
"John…" John begins.
Sherlock’s mouth, sucking and nipping at his sensitive inner thigh. He was sucking hard enough to leave bruises. Bruises. In the shape of his mouth, blue and purpling, like coins, like rose petals, the blood rising to the surface of John’s skin. Bruises, from the capillaries bursting, from the bleeding under his skin.   Blood-
“Well, Sherlock
Pressed so tight to Sherlock that it made his sternum ache, sucking in little gasps of air when a shift of the head or brief parting of lips created space for it, John realised dimly that no one had ever kissed him like this, never clutched him so tight that he could feel the blood throb in their veins like their pulses had merged. He tugged at his wrists, still pinned to the wall as if Sherlock was afraid he might lose his mind and decide to leave. “Mmph,
“Chocolate mice!” Mike said brightly, and pushed two plates towards his mournful Housemates. “Chocolate mice for everyone!”
“I just told you already,” John said, brow furrowed, and she had already known. He had, in fact, stupidly told her twice.
” kissed against the corner of his mouth, his jaw, his ear.
Those thrusts - filthy and bad and right where he needed it, cleaving him open. He was dripping wet. The weight of Sherlock’s body pressing him down into the bed, held so tightly that he couldn’t move, he was completely enveloped, surrounded, invaded, and with every hard shove of cock inside of him his peaked hard nipples and his dick rubbed, rubbed against his own sheets.
He ranks that number eight, easily, on the Top Ten of his favorite sounds that John is capable of making.
The seat next to Sherlock was still empty.
Bite the pillow, Sherlock encourages him when he turns him over, has him face-down so he can fuck him right and proper. Inside John is where he finds himself again: John’s body tight and clasping around him, shuddering and small beneath him, the press of their bodies together, chest to back and heart to heart. Thought of this, something like this, many a time watching John walk by in the school hallways, idle daydreams of having him against the lockers or over a desk or even over a locker room bench.
He didn’t say a word. John inhaled, sharp and sweet, and nodded all the same.
“Ten Chelmsford Street.”
was the first word that came to mind,
chair, the stacks of medical texts and loose papers, old witness reports half-written, casual messages left in sticky notes gently curling at the edges, kitchen sink a mess, bath tub with questionable stains, the violin silent in the corner.
“Did you? With her.” Just saying the words made Sherlock look like John had socked him one after all: betrayed, with all the wind knocked out of him.
sometimes. Liz-Beans is what you call it when two ladies make a baby."
” he continued, whining, “If we don’t find a terrarium for him I shall have to
John’s voice wove comfortably around him in the dark, every now and again pitched with excitement, hushed when he talked about something he found frightening or delightfully
He pulled his hand away so that he could use both hands to release the latches, and then he was pushing up the screen. The black night seemed to roll in, cool breeze over his bared skin, his heated face, and now there was no more barrier between them.
“Well, nice to meet you, Sherlock, I’m —”
“Bill, you are
John adamantly shakes his head. "No, no, you misunderstand the lingo," he says. "Bad means good, remember?"
“Oh,” says Harry. She bites her lip, and John hears the conversation from yesterday morning in the way she lowers her lashes.
"Victor Trevor," he says, gripping John’s hand in a firm clasp. He has a warm, decent handshake, the kind that’s meant to be a sign of good character. His accent is posh, totally public school; John can see it so easily - Victor and Sherlock cut from the same cloth.
There were few visions a man could call sheer perfection. This was one of them, and how Sherlock wished he could share this with the world, with the female-bodied part of the world in particular, specifically those who had once dated John Watson. How he wished John’s girlfriends could see him now, hands bound in pretty red straps and chained above his head, collared, mouth plugged full of Sherlock’s cock and sucking like he was starved for it. God was in the details, or the devil, depending upon which saying one ascribed to, and Sherlock would show them god or the devil depending in all the details of John. He would extrapolate for them the finer points of John’s skin, warm and lightly perspiring, the flush of his cheeks, the blown pupils of his deep blue eyes, his nipples peaked pink with arousal, completely untouched. How his wrists turned white when he tugged too hard at his restraints, how his throat and collarbones and shoulder and chest purpled under Sherlock’s mouth. He would direct their attention to John’s cock, of course, flushed and hard, engorged with blood and jutting out proud, shining at the tip with the wet drip of arousal, and then - John’s mouth, stretched so perfectly around Sherlock’s cock, and the way the saliva dripped from the corner of his mouth and glistened on his lips. How damning the evidence, all added together: John was no longer theirs, had never really been theirs, he was Sherlock’s, he was his, he was his.
John moved down the table.
"That's it," Sherlock encourages. "Spread your legs for me, just like that."
“And stop following me, it’s creepy,” Sherlock bit out. John’s face heated with embarrassment. Perhaps he hadn’t been as sneaky and Bond-esque as he’d been hoping to be. Perhaps suits of armour and potted plants weren’t as good hiding places as they initially appeared to be.
“John? Is that you, honey?”
They play 20 questions with each other, trying to divine each other’s backstories. But it only takes the stranger one question (“Korea?”) to figure out that John is a soldier. A war veteran, in fact. John tells him he was shot in the shoulder to make it interesting, but then later forgets and favors his left leg, feeling the pangs of a phantom injury.
The colonists began repairing the houses that the first failed expedition had built, as well as building new homes. However, they were low on food, tools and supplies, and fearful of attack from natives. And so they persuaded Governor John White to return to England to explain their desperate situation and to seek help.
“Ah,” said Sherlock. “Has the spell worn off?”
Now, John Watson - there’s a boy you can hang your hopes and dreams on. Hitch a star to this boy and he’ll take you places. He wants to be a doctor, he tells Sherlock, as he bandages up the laceration across Sherlock’s knuckles, mindful of the bruising.
“Oh, John,” Sherlock purred. “I’d love to.”
“And then you spin her,” Sherlock said, taking John’s hand and guiding him. “1, 2, 3, 4.” His touch was confident and sure, his movements deliberate; a natural leader. He caught John as he came back to starting position, placing his hand on his lower back. “Now signal for the dip.”
John was so sensitive. He was wonderfully responsive. He made Sherlock want to lay him down on an examination table and figure him out. Surely he couldn’t have been like this with his girlfriends. But then again he’d never had a girlfriend who wanted to investigate him the way that Sherlock did, to unravel him and explore him and make a discovery of him. He’d never had a girlfriend who had heard him beg, who could make him cry and beg and come all in the span of sixty seconds. He had never had a girlfriend who had owned him.
“And sweets,” the Head Boy reminded him.
OpalGrey did a really cool thing and put Sherlock's angsty music into youtube doubler so you can hear the mess that he was listening to
John hopped up on the wooden workbench against the wall of the garage. From there he watched Sherlock work, watched the visible flex of lean muscles underneath his thin white shirt. Sherlock was always good with his hands, at taking things apart and putting them back together. John liked the way that Sherlock looked when he was working, deep in concentration and lost in the machinations of the engine - but also he liked the way Sherlock looked when he was bent over, blue jeans pulling tight over the curve of his ass.
Bill frowned with confusion. Mike giggled.
He worked John’s body, rolling and pinching, squeezing and stroking, till he had John squirming in his lap, caught pleasantly between the hand at his nipple and the one in his pants. A lapful of John was a very nice thing to have, Sherlock reflected as that sweet arse rubbed thoughtlessly against his erection. It was impossible to resist grinding up against it, rutting against that lovely firm curve while John wriggled for him, sinking deeper and deeper into the flood of pleasure Sherlock gave him. .
“Mr. Holmes,” Professor Hudson said, a great deal more kindly than she’d spoken to either Carl or John. “Although I am not your Head of House, I am still your professor, and I want you to know that you can come to me with any issue at all. My door is always open.”
“No, no, Bill, I’m sorry,” said John quickly, dutifully abashed. “I didn’t mean it. It’s a beautiful S.W.A.G.”
“You know,” Victor says, when John’s regained his breath, “He looked surprisingly good ginger. But the blond wasn’t bad either.”
“Well, you can’t kiss any girls,” Sherlock said, “Because you have to kiss me.”
“You’re always right. Doesn’t it get annoying?” John asked him. “You’re annoying, Sherlock. It’s very annoying.”
John can feel his own heart beating when Sherlock kisses him. His heart thrills up in his chest, galloping like he’s just run an 8 minute mile. Sherlock’s lips are dry but his tongue is hot and wet. John feels like he could run forever.
It was late afternoon by the time John left the library, the hallways warm and golden with the afternoon sunlight, streaked with the long shadows of statues stretching out onto sun-warmed flagstone.
What a strange day he was having. As he walked through his school’s black-and-white tiled corridors, he could hear his own steps out of rhythm. It seemed that he was always half a step behind or a step ahead of everybody else.  It was as if he were moving through a dream; everything just slightly moved half an inch to the right. He might wake up any moment and find himself, once again, in his own bed, ready to repeat the morning.
“What’s wrong with you, son?” his father had asked.
Bill looked largely doubtful of John’s ability to judge character.
“No. I think this will be a good lesson for you,” John said. One of his eyebrows was raised in that way that turned his forehead into lopsided Celtic knots.
Sherlock had read this in a document found in a manila envelope, left on the  kitchen countertop labeled
"Think about how good it's going to be, when you're all stretched and ready for a fucking," Sherlock says, focused on the slide of two fingers, the tightness of John's body around only two fingers.
“You can research sex all you want.” John poked at the permanent little gaps between buttonholes in Sherlock’s gamely straining shirt. Sherlock must know how tempting those little glimpses of smooth pale skin were, or else he would’ve bought shirts that fit by now. “It takes practise to get good at it.”
The snap of the shutter gave him away, of course.  When he looked back up from his phone, John was glaring at him, a self-conscious blush spread charmingly across his cheeks.  Sherlock stared him down.  “You can
“What’s not fair is the way you’re being treated,” Mike said.
John quieted to listen.
When Sherlock walked to classes, no one walked with him. In fact other people, even older students, gave him a wide berth, as if he were a man with a great white beard and a staff, who was capable of parting the ocean.
If he had met her earlier.
“You need to stop coming here,” John said, one last desperate attempt at reason. His hands were on the ledge as he pleaded his case, leaning towards Sherlock even as he beseeched him.  “My life was fine before I met you. Now I don’t even know who I am anymore.”  His voice sounded small, even to himself.
Tomorrow they will head to Bilke’s Western Museum before they leave Kansas. It’s filled with antique bits, spurs, saddles, and all sorts of other cowboy things. Jesse James robbed the bank across the street from it. Maybe John will pick up another souvenir.
He was on the opposite side of the train from the platform, so he could not wave to his parents even though he knew for sure that they were waving at the train as departed, saying goodbye to him and Harry, calling out that they loved them. It was the first time John had ever been away from his parents. There was a funny feeling in his throat and as much as he swallowed, he couldn’t seem to get rid of it.
“Although I wouldn’t worry so much about hurrying to dinner,” he said. “I don’t imagine there will be a seat for you, anyway.”
Sherlock’s pale eyes were completely focused on him. They looked blue, and then they shifted green, here in the shadows of the forest.
“Where are we now?” John asks.
“I’m happy you found someone to talk to,” Harry says.
Sherlock’s tongue was inside his mouth and Sherlock’s hands seemed to be everywhere, as if they wanted to probe every crevice of his body, touching and rubbing him in too many places, and John’s skin was tingling, buzzing all over with too much sensation. Greedy. All-consuming. As if Sherlock couldn’t get enough of him. Touching, squeezing, running up and down the sensitive insides of his thighs, making him shudder with frightening intensity; he could feel himself twitch and leak inside his pants, and it was too much, he was spiralling out of control.
"Sure," said Sherlock. "But I was asking about you."
And then it came again:
back to normal....for now.
Sherlock’s skin, on the human boy part of him (and not the fishy boy part of him) was warm and soft, just like John’s. His hands, John noticed now, had thin, transparent webbing between his fingers, up to the first knuckle. There were lines across his neck like John had seen on pictures of sharks. They fluttered, a little, with Sherlock’s laughing breath, when John asked to touch.
“Tell me more about this bat-man and...movies,” Sherlock said, closing his book and settling back into the bed. The potion was bound to take effect again, and John would be asleep soon enough, so he wouldn’t have to listen to it for long.
Sherlock was torn between scoffing at the idiocy of the question and being pleased that John thought it was a possibility that he had been dreaming about Sherlock.
And the prickling fear that crawled up the back of his neck, the sensation of being watched? That had to be his imagination.
“We can’t move, Hazel. Do you know how lucky we are to have this house? This great location?”
Sherlock didn’t need any further encouragement. He reached down between them and guided the head of his dick right where it needed to be, slick and warm and waiting for him to fill it up. A moment of pressure, a moment of resistance.
“ I will even offer you a weekly care package from Honeydukes to sweeten the deal. All the Chocolate Frogs and Fizzing Whizbees and Ice Mice you could possibly stomach,” the Head Boy continued, which was an awfully tempting offer. Fizzing Whizbees were the
After Bill and Mike left, John fell back asleep, as the potion had a definite soporific effect on him. He woke up at one point to find that dinner had appeared and then he, subsequently, made some of it disappear. He was thankful for the sleeping, because otherwise it would have been unbearably boring.
"Look," Sherlock says, casting an eye about; the parking lot mostly empty, but not entirely deserted. Practice has just let out, after all. "You want to do this, we'll do this. But not here. Not right now. Get in the car, and we'll talk."
“Oh,” John said, voice soft, suddenly not so hellbent on Sherlock’s bloody demise anymore. His thirst for violence melted into a touched surprise that smoothed out his face and made his eyes wide and bright, at once looking very young and almost puppylike. Not that Sherlock would ever mention the latter if he didn’t want the murderous intent to come rushing back.
and he should not stop, he could not stop, he should never stop -
“John Watson,” said John, who had always been taught to mind his manners. “How do you do.”
Sherlock wriggled out, slipping his cock out first and then sliding himself out from between John's legs. While he could have easily stayed inside of John all night, the chain digging into his back would have made it slightly uncomfortable for actual sleep. He unchained John next, grabbed a few Kleenex from next to the bed. He wiped them both up but paid special attention to John, cleaning up the semen on his belly and then in between his legs, unable to help a hiss at the sight of his own cum dripping slowly out of a reddened, used hole, still wet with lube.
- all the way in deep where he thought nothing could ever go. The pain still there but it had, transformed, into sensation. Between his legs he was painfully hard, and now his body had become accepting, insides fluttering, clinging to the pull and drag of it, the rub of it against that place inside of him that made him spark white-hot. He was so hot, he was a flame, flickering with pleasure with every jolt, every push, wanting to cry, to sob, but in a good way.
“Don’t you know? That’s
“Are those--?” John asked.
“Oh come on, John,” Carl said, “We all know about our little Sherlock here. He’s Dark spawn, and someone has to be the hero.”
“Sherlock, we
quite brilliant,” John said with a little smile. He normally did not like to brag, especially not about fighting, but Carl was such a wanker. “I think I broke his nose!”
Sherlock presses John’s thigh against the back seat, leans against it and pins him there, keeping him spread open like a specimen for Sherlock's hungry, inquisitive gaze.  He presses kisses against the inside  of John's thigh while he rubs his finger, searching out the spot inside of him that would make him burn with pleasure.
It was nearly bedtime before the Ban on Bill-words was lifted. Both John and Mike were saddened to see it go, although they had missed Bill-words a little, tiny bit. Bill celebrated the lifting of the ban by making as much noise as possible, although admittedly he had been doing that already, with the way he had been rummaging through his wardrobe, his bedside table, and then his trunk.
“Sherlock?” John said, muffled from behind Sherlock’s hand. And then, “Am I dreaming?”
“Right, but then he’d wander out and
Corners of a book peek out from underneath the mattress. Sherlock reaches down and tugs it out:
John laughs as well. The aching eases up in his chest.
John found Sherlock sitting on his bed when he got home, having clearly let himself in with the spare key the Watsons kept in the flowerpot. “Did you have a good time at the dance?”
Sherlock was right, after all. He was always right. Being right made him happy. It was a reassurance that the universe was a logical place.
John hunched and typed furiously.
John looked confused for a moment, but Sherlock didn’t blame him. Mycroft was particularly hard for most people to comprehend.
“Have you ever heard of pareidolia, Mrs. Watson?”
A tiny little feeling of smugness squirmed up into John’s chest. It was the smallest consolation, really, considering that he had lost so many points and now had to serve Detention, on top of the shame of having Professor Hudson so disappointed in him, but, oh gosh,
“Yeah? And what did he say?” John asks, leaning in.
I'm gonna show you where it's dark, but have no fear
The sun shone down on the little car with its family inside, the countryside scrolling merrily by.
“You’d let me do anything to you,” Sherlock murmurs, words only barely comprehensible in the humming sensation that fills John’s brain, the pleasure that sweeps through his body.
But wait, no.
Sherlock bristled. He was not a
"What they are saying,” said Bill, “Is that you have Liz-Bean dwarf and house elf parents but you're still basically Muggleborn and you don't have enough money and also that's why you have a voice like a girl."
by criminals, you’ll like that part at least. That’s why he devotes his life to fighting crime. I always thought that he must be very lonely, and that’s why he has Robin. But in the movie there’s no Robin, so that’s sad. Maybe I’ll show you a movie sometime. They’re brilliant.”
John swallowed as Sherlock’s fingers slid under the edge of his collar and began to push it open.
“Way to go, Watson, yea!” a Slytherin girl smirked, standing up to applaud as John walked by.
“I’ll, ah, see you in the morning,” John says, and then winces at his own lameness.
He coughed delicately in Carl’s general direction.
So Sherlock took a step back, and then another, until he had retreated back into his own little comfortable fortress of blankets plus one very heavy Restricted illicit textbook.
means: 2.5 children and white picket fence.
“Then let me see it,” John said, wanting to know how weird that looked. “It’s only fair.”
Sherlock watched him all the while, seeming amused. “Do you still think you’re dreaming?”
“It is,” Bill said, proudly. “I’ve had it for a while but I think you’re going to need it far more than I do, if you plan to hang around freaky-creepy Holmes all the time.”
And all he wanted was a photo of them kissing. He’d even
“But no more rifling through my things,” Mycroft warned him, “And stop snooping in my room. There will be dire consequences if you do.”
assignment. That’s an actually
“No!” John said, making a swipe for the camera. Sherlock stepped back to avoid it, forcing John to collapse back into the armchair.
“Does the water go down real quick?” John asked.
That was, of course, until John came along.
“What kind of sweets do you have?” he asked Madam Pomfrey, because this was a staple of every hospital or doctor’s visit he’d ever had. He was certain that there was a supply closet somewhere in every hospital and clinic that was purely for shelving sweets, while the bandages and plasters and needles all lived somewhere else.
He reluctantly pulled his covers back and swung his legs around; the wooden floorboards were cold underneath his toes, and creaked as he put his weight on them. It was real, solid. He stared sleepily, for a moment, at the square of sunlight on the floor, before shaking off the haze to get ready for the day.
John knew, without looking, who it had to be.
He’d gone to sleep hugging his letter that night, shivering happily with his heart thrumming in his chest.
leave Hogwarts! He’d only just gotten here!
Satisfying didn’t even begin to cover it.
“John Hamish Watson,” John said. “I agree to the contract and I do it freely.”
“Shh,” Sherlock coaxed. “Remember to breathe.”
"Just...don’t wander off on your own again. And stay away from the water, all right? It’s dangerous!” Harry chided him, giving his hand a little shake.
“Sherlock,” the boy replied, and he held out his other hand expectantly, for John to take. It wasn’t a name like any John had ever heard before, although he’d only just started school and certainly hadn’t heard all the names there ever were.
“I know you insist on being friends with Sherlock Holmes,” said Bill in resigned tones. “Despite how dangerous, negative, stupid, toxic--”
“It’s radishes,” her father corrected. “The red ones.”
John shuffled a little guiltily. It was true. Mrs Hudson had taken a picture of them smooching under the mistletoe at the Christmas party last year, just before Jeanette had dumped him for being a better boyfriend to Sherlock than to her (oh, the irony), and John hadn’t put up a fuss about that.
John leans up for a kiss. He’s stopped by a hand on a chest, Victor keeping a careful distance between them.
John had climbed plenty of trees in his childhood so this one was no real challenge. He had only twisted an ankle once, and sprained his shoulder another time. Momma said that when he’d hit the ground, his sense of fear had been knocked clean out of him.  Once he reached Sherlock’s window, he took a look inside to confirm it was the right one.
“You do what you want,” said Harry, chewing loudly. “You do the right thing and it’ll all be all right. But you really need to get that creepy little Slytherin friend of yours to teach you how not to get caught.”
“Well, that’s- Hang on, what do you mean,
“Home, obviously,” Sherlock replied. “Mummy said she would miss me terribly when I went to school. Now she won’t have to.”
, which it was most decidedly not. This was Sherlock’s
“So good,” Sherlock praised him, voice rumbling deep in his chest with luxurious pleasure. He pulled back slowly and relished the slide of every inch, rocking just the first few inches of his dick in shallow thrusts at first, teasing. John made a soft, keening sound, pushing his hips back, needing to be filled. Sherlock stopped, hesitated for a moment, petted John’s hair and drank in the pleading expression etched into John’s wonderfully familiar features. There had been a time when he could have never seen an expression such as this; there had been a time, tonight, when he thought he might never see this expression again. He nudged their mouths together softly, kissing lightly, right before he slammed his hips forward, cock shoving in so hard that John lost his breath.
“John,” Sherlock repeated to himself. “
John looked up at him, and steeled himself. He had always been brave, unafraid. He took a step forward, and didn’t tremble, although he had the dizzying feeling of taking a footstep towards a cliff. As when one looks down from a great height and is overcome with the impulse to jump. And another step, and another - moving both too slow and too quickly, as if in a dream.
Sherlock pushed John’s thigh up a bit higher, and ran a cool, slippery finger down along his taint into the cleft of his buttocks. When John gasped and squirmed, Sherlock pushed down to keep him in place, and then began to press gently against his entrance, over and over, in a soothingly erotic rhythm that quickly made John want him inside. He flexed his hips. “Come on, Jesus, stop fucking around!”
Sherlock had leaned in, had brushed their lips together, and whispered a soft "No," breath hot and pressed right up against the younger boy's mouth. He'd pushed himself back just long enough to enjoy the look of hurt, of shock and confusion, before he amended his statement. There had been fire in those midnight eyes. Fire, fire burning bright. "Not here, where anyone can cast an eyeball at you."
“I don’t have anywhere better to be,” Victor shrugs. “Is it true that you moved in with him the day after you met him?”
Sherlock kisses his ear, then the side of his face, then his neck and shoulder. His kisses are soft and wet. His chokehold is brutal, unrelenting.
Also:
“I’m Sally,” she said. She held out her hand and smiled. John was relieved. It was the first time all day that someone had smiled at him, and not out of derision. “Sally Donovan.”
Sherlock is outside. John can see him through the large front window: a dark figure vivisected by the white slats of  vertical vinyl blinds. It’s still dark out and he is half-lit by the yellow glow of the recessed lights outside their room. He seems to be enjoying the beautiful view of the parking lot.  A light wraith of smoke curls out from his cigarette.
a female voice whispered loudly - as loudly as possible, really, for it to still be a whisper. It was loud enough for John to look around fearfully; they were all very mindful of the wrath of Madam Pince. Legend had it that Madame Pince had once had a mouse thrown out of the library for sneezing too disruptively.
They find a box full of newspapers delivered but unread, pages bundled up and still crisp in their plastic wrap. John builds the fire while Victor hands him the papers, one by one. They watch as fire eats up the headlines: “Suicide of Fake Genius” consumed by flames.
“You’ll just have to work harder at it I guess,” John said. “Maybe you could steal a car or something,” he offered helpfully. “Just don’t smoke, though, Momma would have a fit.”
“Was it the kind of dating where everybody thinks you’re on a date but you’re not actually, or was it the kind of dating where you intentionally go on dates?”
“Oh, come off it, Bill!” John said, batting the other boy’s hands away from his face. “I’m not under any evil enchantments.”
John does not protest the little motions, instead his breathing comes fast and shallow. His body jerks with sudden stimulation when Sherlock rubs his inner walls just right, and his mouth opens to let out a sharp little cry.
you’ve gone and done it,” Mike chided Bill, and smacked him on the arm.
The door to John’s room was slightly open. Hazel’s heart rocketed into her throat.
“I want to hear all the noises you can make,” said Sherlock. Yes, that roiling feeling in his stomach, that was excitement.
name, then. You know. Like Lester or Minnie or Bob.”
John cocks the rifle and hefts it up to his shoulder, staring down the length of the barrel. “I’ll protect you, too,” he says, and pulls the trigger. A can flies off the fence with the hollow sound of a bullet piercing metal, 650 meters away.
Victor sighs and rolls over until he’s very close, peering up into John’s face. “I suppose that’s why I’m glad he found you. Or you found each other. He deserved to be happy. I think….that’s all I wanted for him, in the end.”
And once again, without really thinking about it, he gently touched his own lips.
He was not allowed to go swimming on his own, even though his instructor said he was a natural. “Just like a tadpole,” Greg had chuckled, and John had wondered, with great interest, if this meant that one day he would grow into a frog.
John shudders and closes his eyes. “People will think I’m a beatnik,” he protests lightly.
Sherlock smiled. Victory.
Sometimes the enemies came from within one’s own ranks. Victor Trevor had stolen all of Sherlock’s books and hidden them again, and although it had taken Sherlock only fifteen minutes to deduce all the possible hiding places, this time he had baked
John found himself flushing again. “I...I don’t know.”
John sat up a little straighter, and tried his best to hide his smile behind his cup of tea. This proved rather difficult, so he took a sip of tea instead.
John had been busy at the clinic lately. Winter brought with it influenza season, as well as an endless stream of runny noses, colicky and feverish babies, adults presenting with vague complaints of “not feeling well”, and the stubborn elderly patients that fought him with each inoculation. The clinic was understaffed, more so than usual, as doctors and nurses had yet to develop immunity to the disgusting illnesses that surrounded them daily. As a result John was shackled to long hours of forced overtime, feet plodding up the stairs to 221B after every shift, arriving home full of boring war stories about other people’s bodily fluids.
In the backseat, Harriet and John were engaged in a hand game.

“Powers,” Sherlock said slowly, aghast at the thought, “This is my
“Batman fights for justice,” said John, “and he’s different, because some people think he’s scary, because he always comes out at night. But that’s why they call him the Dark Knight. He gives bad guys something to be afraid of.”
The want happens before the knowing, desire before logic, urge before reason.
“Mm,” said Mycroft sympathetically.
“Harry!”
Hazel rested with her head upon her hand, propped up against the window, not sleeping.
While he fumbled and searched for it, checking first one pocket and then the other, standing up in the middle of the restaurant and then getting onto his knees, looking underneath his chair, and then the table, Sarah said, “John, John, wait, get up...we need to talk.”
“So does he save a lot of people, this bat-man?” Sherlock asked.
“Hey there, Lawbreaker! You were quite the talk of the town today!”
"Get it off of him, you incompe-...Pomfrey!" Sherlock cried, and in one swift move, knocked the potion out of her hand so that it spilled, splattering big red drops on white hospital sheets before the bottle clattered on the floor.
There was nothing to do but to stand out in the hallway and wait, and listen to his sister in the shower, completely unaware of what kind of brother she had, and listen to his mother downstairs, completely unaware of what kind of son she had, and with every passing second he could feel the body-temperature wetness soaking into his underwear.
“Do you drink coffee, Sherlock?” she asks. “I could put on a pot.” She looks at him then, her scrutiny stone-steady. “John’s too young for coffee.”
The clerk behind the desk had to know. He was a medium sort of man, medium height and build, a middle-ranged voice; decent-looking with neat, clean hair and fingernails. He probably had a medium sort of wife at home, two kids and a dog, went to church on Sundays. He would take one look at the two of them and know about all the things that they wanted to do to each other, just how John liked to be touched, and wrecked, and the mess they would both make all over the sheets.  Horrified, he’d cast them both out in sin.
Four drinks later and even Sherlock was feeling charitable. That was dangerous. It meant that people got away with extreme idiocy without ever being informed of it. The world would surely go to ruin. The alcohol warmed him from inside, however, and gently slowed his thoughts, and he was aware of a pleasant warmth on one side of his body, where John half-slumped, resting against him. The world could go to ruin for an evening, perhaps.
.  It was a hateful little word that Sherlock so despised because he had none and had no need for any. He had Billy, he had Mummy, he had Mycroft (in both owl and brother forms), and in these, all the social interaction one could possibly need. For one brief moment he’d entertained the thought of having a real, human friend for once, a foolish idea that had been wisely abandoned the second that John had turned that predictable, dull look of despair onto him at the Sorting.
They're talking about you, boy
Sherlock sucked in a breath. He smeared one grease-stained thumb over John’s bottom lip.
"Sherlock," John says, "I thought you didn't do dances."
John looked over at Sherlock, who only nodded impassively. He had seen people be nasty to Sherlock several times already, and it was hard to believe a stern talking-to from a teacher and a deduction of House points would make it all stop so easily.
"Yeah, sort of," said John.
A chase ensued. Sherlock pressed the shutter haphazardly as he pursued an elusive-yet-loudly-protesting John around the room. John was not making himself an easy target, pulling out various pieces of furniture to block Sherlock’s path and tossing various objects in his general direction.
“I took a poll,” said Bill.
Now, he understands, when a voice so awfully familiar says, “I have been waiting for you for so long"  - melodic and deep, and terrifyingly triumphant.
"Does it feel good?" Sherlock wants to know, torn between watching John's face and the sight of his own finger, rubbing in and out of the tiny little hole.
John whimpered, looking ruined, almost not daring to hope but his expression desperately hopeful nonetheless. His eyes were nearly black with arousal. He was obviously close again, every inch of him, every muscle and nerve straining for orgasm. He could do nothing but shudder and moan weakly with every thrust to his now-oversensitised prostate. Saliva trickled from the corner of his forced-open pink mouth and his eyes rolled heavenward; he was absolutely and completely overwhelmed.
Hazel screamed. She did not intend to scream. She could not help it. The horror burst from inside of her, it rushed out of her throat and flooded loudly out of her wide-open mouth.
Batman,” John corrected. “His real name is Bruce Wayne and he’s a millionaire and he's a superhero. He fights villains, and solves crimes, and keeps the city safe."
He should have felt a resounding internal roar of triumph, then, when he saw John two days later in the Great Hall, laughing with his new friends at the Gryffindor table. Because he had known that that would happen, eventually, either once Sherlock was Sorted Slytherin or when John learned about his reputation. John was very normal -
The changing of the hours: this familiar sound. Autumn was in the air with its apple crispness and the snap of cold, the smoky firewood scent of impending winter. In the distance, a siren wailed and wailed.
In short, Sherlock Holmes had been too distracted by all the pretty, shiny things floating around that he had somehow missed the very obvious truth about the whole place. For shame.
"Sherlock," John says; he's balled up tight, his muscles tense, fingers undoubtedly white with the way he grips Sherlock's body. "Kiss me," John says; both a plea and a demand, and Sherlock kisses him twice, once for each meaning of it. He slides his tongue into the wet heat of John's mouth; John's soft tongue slipping against his, just the way Sherlock has taught him to.
and these things simply did not happen back home.
“I don’t recall.”
Sherlock’s hand found one of John’s, pressed it down against the pillow, pinned it there and interlaced their fingers. He looked into John’s eyes as if he could stare into dark blue irises, the wide black pupils, and slowly extract all of his thoughts, his secrets, and he thought, hard,
John wasn’t quite sure how to react to that.
“I’m still your Professor, dear,” Professor Hudson said, “And I deserve to be respected as such.”
“Oh, John, John my dear heart, you’ve given Mummy such a fright!” Hazel threw her arms around him.
What he didn’t understand was the laughter that had started to follow him in the halls, Monday at school.
Midnight approaches, sneakily and without warning.
When they separated, it was Sherlock who pulled away, and John followed him, instinctively, as steel drawn to a magnet. John with his hand on Sherlock’s chest, his own heart in his throat, until Sherlock’s cool fingers were wrapping around his hand, to gently peel him away.
He's inside John Watson for the very first time.
Sherlock leaned back on the sofa, lush with satisfaction. He was still fully dressed, with only his black trousers pushed down past his hips. John was completely naked, tied up prettily and glorious.
whatifwhatifwhatif
John moaned weakly, precum spurting out clear from the head of his dick. The sound of his moan was muffled by the black ball gag stopping up his mouth. It was just big enough to stretch his mouth sweetly open. Sherlock liked the sight of John’s mouth with something in it. He liked to have either of John’s holes plugged, either with his cock or with a toy. If it were up to him, that would always be the case, but as cases went, that would be very impractical.
, reads the letters arching over the gate. Over the entrance, painted green letters reiterate “THE BIG WELL” - just in case anyone missed it - with a giant arrow pointing down.
“Mummy, why are you crying?” he asked her, in his familiar little voice. His breath was formed by small lungs that were not filled with water.
John does not deny it.
John Watson kills him.
“Apology accepted,” said John, who put the amulet on. “And thank you.”
“Of course he didn’t. That’s so like him,” Victor shakes his head. He’s still smiling.
"Like me," Sherlock said, and smiled his bright little smile. "Come with me, and I'll show you everything."

Mike and John said in unison.
“Was that supposed to be funny? I don’t need
slug. We fed him and we’re going to train him and we gave him a name.” He reached into the jar and pulled out Rachmaninoff from where it had been nestled, as its slimy brethren attempted to slowly climb the glass walls. “And he likes you. We can’t stew him! Just look at this cute, adoring little face! We must save him!”
“What?”
“It’s dangerous to be out alone at night,” the young man continued. His voice was low, almost soothing.  “Anything could happen to you in the dark, you know.”
Nothing like a big bad bridge
When Sherlock used to peeve him he went for walks to keep from strangling his flatmate. When Afghanistan loomed close, gunfire and heat and nitrile gloves smeared with blood, he grounded himself in the chaos of London.
in the night, thought of (
He gives himself a few strokes for the sheer pleasure of it, spreading his own precum down the shaft. John watching him, mouth slightly open - he’s never seen this before, not with Sherlock, not with anyone. Sherlock presses that same hand against the willing plushness of John's mouth, smelling of musk, tasting of his salt, his sex.
“Oh?” Sarah smiled. “Who was it? Should I be jealous?”
John made an abortive sound, as though he’d been about to protest and then thought better of it. Instead, he reached up to stroke a hand up Sherlock’s neck--John was always so fascinated with Sherlock’s neck--while Sherlock licked soothingly at his abused flesh.
he’d built little nests in metal drums in the backyard. In the first set he made a miscalculation and built the kindling up too high, leaned in an inch too close as the flames shot up quick and licked at his face; he remembers the light, the intense heat. It had been an experiment; he was operating underneath controlled conditions, he was most certainly not a budding little arsonist, but this was difficult to explain to the screaming maid who had found him, a lit match in his hand and one brow singed off.
“Technically, it’s six,” corrected Mike.
"Oh," Victor says. His eyes are wide.
sort of noise and a great heave, he managed to finally wrench the camera away out of sheer determination alone. He sat back on Sherlock’s hips, triumphant, keeping the git pinned while he started deleting photos. How the hell did you get to the photo gallery in this…? He squeezed his eyes shut as the flash went off in his face again.
“Oh come now, that’s not fair,
“And made them fall in love with him?” asked John, who was confused by the romance part.
John nodded, and held back that needy-sounding moan when Sherlock began to kiss down his spine. Sherlock was murmuring to himself like he was listing off each of the muscles as he kissed them. He had done that before; said he was tutoring John in his anatomy. Trapezius.  Supraspinatus. Teres. Latissimus. Obliques. Gluteus.
. And if John was really lucky then sometimes he got in to watch the movies for free, even the ones that were deemed inappropriate for audiences younger than 13.
John groaned, hands sliding up to bury themselves in Sherlock’s dark hair, encouraging more, forgetting all else.
And then, to further worsen matters, John said, “Thank you,” in a very sincere tone which Sherlock did not understand, because people did not generally thank Sherlock  for anything unless it was the cessation of something unpleasant that he’d been doing. Furthermore, people did not thank other people for a beating unless they had severe masochistic tendencies, and Sherlock had not read John as that sort of boy.
“You can’t be Sherlock,” he accused, shaking his head. “You can’t. He’s…” he stumbled over the word, heavy and clogging in his throat.
“Come help Mummy with dinner, John,” Hazel said. “You can make animals out of the dough and then we’ll bake them.”
“Harry, no!”
” said Bill, nodding sagely. “And like, if you stopped being seen with him the rumours would stop, you know? For both your sakes.”
“You know,
“A great, powerful wizard,” Sherlock said, emphatically. “Well, that or a Muggle who stupidly wandered into some magical crossfire. I haven’t decided yet.”
John took his potion without fuss, although he made a face because it tasted like it looked: all mashed up leaves and bitter, salty slugs. Or, at least, what he imagined slugs to taste like.
“What were you reading?”
“Where’s your mummy and daddy?” John asked, because he was sure his Mummy and Daddy would be scared to death if he were stuck somewhere. He also knew that in any sort of trouble situation, you were meant to get a grown-up to sort it all out.
John said, “Well, that
His voice cracks a bit on the word all. He clears his throat, once, twice, coughs. Presses a fist to his forehead.
Bluebell sat on the table, nibbling at cake, glowing faintly as if in response.
Sherlock’s hands upon his bare shoulders and then down his chest, rubbing, squeezing. Sherlock’s hands at his trousers, fingers skimming over his hips, grabbing his hips, squeezing his buttocks, John could barely think about what was happening, only that Sherlock’s hands felt so big, seemed to cover so much so easily, and then there was Sherlock’s cool tongue sliding inside his mouth. Sherlock’s hands at his nipples, tingling sensation where he’d never been touched before,  pulling forth muffled whimpers and sounds John didn’t recognize as himself.
“Well, I don’t know what an Umboogu Slashkiller is,” John admitted, “but I don’t think Batman’s like that. He’s in comics and movies and stuff.”
He looked at himself once again at the mirror and smiled at his reflection. Then he frowned. His hair was
Downstairs, right now, Mrs. Watson will be fixing herself another Irish coffee, hold the coffee.
John was silent.
“Some,” Sherlock amended. He wanted to hear all the different cadences in John’s voice when he tried to be witty while he was being pleasured.
was sitting patiently across from him, observing and getting his fill of John’s concentrated face, heartlessly ignored. The situation was a simple enough fix. Sherlock rose from his seat to stride across the room, leaning in to press a tender kiss to John’s forehead. It was the sort of romantic gesture that usually earned him the adulation that he deserved. He hovered, waiting for John to look up at him with adoration shining in those dark blue eyes.
obvious. I’m amazed you don’t nod off during History of Magic.”
Cremation takes place at 1800 to 2100 degrees Fahrenheit, 950 to 1100 degrees Celsius. Over the course of one to two hours, a human body is turned to ash; although some portions of the pelvis, skull, and teeth may remain recognizable as human.
The pressure on his throat then isn’t pain, isn’t anything anymore really, the world fading mutely from around him. His vision goes blurry and then small spots of colour appear, vibrant inky splotches of black. He’s literally breathless, lips parted and attempting to gasp, no air in, no air out. His lungs burn with the need for air, the desperation to inhale, exhale, and his heart pounds a quickening, thundering beat in his chest, racing with his spiking adrenaline.
“Well,” says Sherlock drily, “At least we know what we’re getting ourselves into.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He found a seat by himself in a bench near the front, because he wanted to be up close for the lesson. Immediately he opened up
John held his breath as he felt Sherlock’s dick nudge and bump at his entrance, releasing it in a long, low moan of relief when it finally breached him. That unfamiliar stretch, the slow insistent burn of penetration; being filled was like cold water on a sweltering day, layered with painkillers rubbing out a bone-deep ache. Sherlock moved slowly inside him, deep and luxurious. John could feel every inch as it filled him, and then again as Sherlock pulled out, only to push back in. He could barely move with Sherlock’s weight holding him practically folded in half, lower body twisted to the side, and still it felt so good that it left him panting for it, squirming uselessly in place.
John closes his eyes and lets Sherlock debase the sanctity of his mouth, wet little tongue eradicating the sinful evidence of desire.
The sun is starting to set when they pull over in the middle of nowhere.
The Gryffindor dormitories were horrendously and predictably outfitted in garish red and gold. To look was to be nauseated; prolonged exposure surely would be enough to drive one mad. This would be logical explanation for the behaviours of most Gryffindors. Sherlock himself would have been suffering a headache (at least) this very morning, if not for the fact that he currently had an unclothed John Watson nuzzling his throat.
It was because John was in the Infirmary, and he was in the Infirmary on
“Where did they all go?”
He raised his hand, and placed it upon the screen. Their hands met, touching, palm to palm. Sherlock’s cool skin was touching John’s, and it was all John could feel, despite the wire mesh between them - Sherlock’s touch against his own heated palm. An electric tingle shivered through him, as if the two of them together completed a circuit. Here: the beginning, the end.
He really wanted to look at John’s scar again, to trace that white line of scar tissue underneath his fingertips and try to pinpoint every entry the needle had made into his skin. He wanted to see all the interesting scars and marks John had; the stories they would tell about what John had possibly been doing when he’d gotten them, or what stitches may been done to sew all those terrible little holes shut again.
Three fingers are much harder for John to take, he's so tight, tighter than anybody else Sherlock can remember or cares to remember.  Three fingers bring John close to sobbing, the most exquisite expression on his face and the most delectable sounds tearing from his throat.
that he’d been teased, and was both embarrassed and annoyed at himself for falling for something so obvious.
“Okay,” said John, blinking, taken aback by Sherlock’s harsh tone. “But since I’m here, you may as well take it.”
He pulls John's peepers off and sets them aside on the nightstand. "Do I look blurry without these?"
Because John did.
They took to locking John’s door at night as well as the front door, per Dr. Mullaley’s recommendation. Hazel swept the halls and scrubbed the floors and hoovered the carpets, until there was no sand anymore.
John made a face. “Like
James Dean, in his red jacket with the popped collar, all cool disillusion with his suburban life. Angry and unsatisfied, brimming with unspoken energy. And despite his rough-and-tumble exterior, inside Jim Stark was desperately lonely, searching for something greater, with a deep capacity for love.
"Of course it’s taken.” Sherlock moved in to occupy the space freed up by John’s sway-back. It may have been his imagination, but the air felt warm. Perhaps he should experiment sometime to see if John left a human-detectable heat trail. He was certainly warm enough in bed. “That and any other references to Bond movies. I know that, and I don't even like Bond."
John and Mike shared a glance that said that they didn’t know if “debonair” was quite the word for it, but to be fair, at least they hadn’t gotten pelted with food this whole time.
“These seats are taken,” Violet said, not skipping a beat. “They’re all taken. No room.”

Sherlock did not appear to share his very legitimate fears, but then again, Sherlock had not broken anybody’s nose. (Pity, that.)
“Do you know him?” Jeanette asked.
"Boring. Did that earlier.” Sherlock leaned low into John’s personal space, enjoying the smell of his hair. He hadn’t showered yet today; it smelt more of John than usual. "You're missing an e."
John pretends to be asleep when Sherlock slides back into bed. Sherlock traces his fingers over John’s skin as if absorbing him, like there is something here that needs to be preserved. John squeezes his eyes shut and does not think he can stand it.
“Yes, Ma’am,” said Bill and Mike in unison, beatifically. They beat a hasty retreat, and John hedged a little bit closer to Sherlock in their absence.
“May I?” Sherlock said, while John stared at him around his thumb, hovering somewhere around baffled and sidling toward furious.
The way John sucked him now, motions restrained by his position, unable to use his hands, his mouth reduced to another hot, wet hole for the using - it was like he’d been born for it.
Sherlock had smiled at him then, with his wolf-bright smile. No pretence, no cover up, just open honesty. People often find his honesty frightening.
They’d awakened on the sofa a few mornings later, having fallen asleep arguing over the relative merits of an Edgar Wright movie marathon, and exactly how ill-advised it would be to start one at 11 pm. Morning found them with John’s nose squashed against Sherlock’s pulse, Sherlock’s cheek resting against ruffled blond hair, shielding John from the worst of the bright early light that had dared to wake them.
chapters, then.”
Every slow, powerful stroke of his cock drove the breath from John. There was something sublime in being forced to breathe with the rhythm of Sherlock taking him. As Sherlock sped up, the thrusts came faster, harder, their bodies smacking together. John found himself struggling for enough air. He couldn’t move, he couldn’t breathe properly, while Sherlock played with John’s body however he wanted; the sharp awareness of his own helplessness seemed to make his sense of everything else keener. Sherlock’s cock felt bigger and more vibrant inside him than it ever had before, every rub against his prostate flashed brighter, each thrust drove him closer to the precipice of orgasm. John moaned and writhed, he raked his hands over the backs of Sherlock’s shoulders and keened with desire for
“A friend?!” Sherlock asked, unable to hide his shock. He hadn’t had someone call themselves his friend since he was eight years old, and that relationship had been tragically short-lived. An experimental oversight, on his part.
“I’m always right,” Sherlock said.  John thought that he sounded bitter about it, or at least dissatisfied, but before he could decide, Sherlock went right back to banging and clanging on the engine and anything else John said was lost in the noise.
“Of course not,” Bill reassured him. “They hate Carl Powers, too. And Sherlock Holmes, of course, but that’s nothing new.”
"Tell me," John says, "about London again."
This chapter is dedicated to the amazing cutie baby beekitten
The future - what of it? He was still too young for that to be anything more than a hazy ‘someday.’ He would finish school, of course, because that was what was expected of him, but then what? There was no Great World War waiting for him, no great world stage on which he would be a soldier or a hero - and what did he want to do with his life?
He snapped the laptop closed and just barely missed sandwiching John’s fingers in the process. It was the fastest John’s hands had ever moved over the keyboard.

“Okay,” John said, unable to help the warm flush that rose to his cheeks and the little flip in his stomach. Him! On the Quidditch team!
John laughed. “Now I know I’m worri--” Sherlock cut him off mid-snark, shoving his knee up and to the side to deposit his lower legs on the back of the sofa. The other leg went with it, both of them caught in the knot his trousers had formed around his thighs.
“I knew him,” says the stranger, by way of explanation. His dark eyes are tired, with shadows smudged underneath from lack of sleep. He gestures at the grave with his bouquet. “Sherlock. We used to be...close.”
“We’re wearing moustaches because Bill wanted to protect his identity so he could keep hanging around you.
Victor orders three drinks from the bartender. John suddenly realises that one of them is far more drunk than he originally thought: Victor for forgetting how to count, or himself for seeing double.
He released John, and then he turned and bounded up the stairs, John after him in a second.
Then again, the worst that could happen was that Sherlock would say no again, and John had already been through that once before. Well, technically, the worst thing that could happen was John getting Bubotuber pus in his eye, but that could happen whether or not he asked Sherlock to be his partner.
into a
“But I bet you didn’t know it was an alpatross,” said John to Harry.
They both hissed at the feeling of connection. John was so
“John,” Sherlock was murmuring, and John gasped suddenly, for air that he didn’t need, because he could always breathe. “You’re so sweet,” Sherlock was saying, and he was kissing him sweetly on his trembling mouth. Soft kisses, gentle press of lips together - there was nothing filling his throat - and Sherlock was petting him as he thrust in and out.
Sherlock pulls his mouth off abruptly. "You can't," he says. He gives the underside of John's pretty cock a lick, down to his balls. John gasps, shudders wonderfully.  “You're not allowed. I'm not even inside of you yet. That's when you're allowed to come, when I'm inside you and fucking you.”
“John,” Sherlock said, patiently - and he’d never been patient before, “it is only a Horned slug. There are literally hundreds of them in the Greenhouses.”
“John, whatever it is, I take it back,” Bill said, and he didn’t even know what it is that made John upset, and John didn’t know how to put it into words.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed suddenly, glaring, his look turning hard as jagged rocks. He shoved John backwards with a little hiss. John stumbled, falling back and landing on his bottom in the water with a great big splash.
"Oh!" she said, grinning at them. "I’m sorry…I didn’t realise. Nevermind, then."
In the centre of the crowd, Sherlock was on the floor, and Carl Powers had somehow managed to acquire his books and his homework and he now stood above him, taunting him.
“Swag?” John echoed.
John had been the one to choose California as their destination. The reason for his choice, however, was unbeknownst to Sherlock, although most things did not stay unbeknownst to Sherlock for long.
It was too hot in the church, hard to think. John looked up to see Jesus with his muscles straining in quiet agony, the godliness of his torso, the tightness of his chest and abdominal musculature, the perfection of his divine features.
He paused by his chair. A newspaper lay folded and waiting on the arm, a polite gesture from his flatmate. No, not just flatmate, his...More-than-just-a-flatmate. If his brain could have coughed, it would have. Years of determined, insistent heterosexuality tended to do that to a person’s brain. (Said brain had no problem imagining said person in sweaty bedroom antics with very male More-than-just-a-flatmate, however, but that was neither here nor there.) John was still coming to terms with the term. He had
“I know you can, you can get anything,” said Sherlock. “And
“Thank you, Bill,” said John. “You are a good friend.”
And so he whispers in between kisses, “The name is Sherlock Holmes” and John is whispering back “John, John Watson” their names melding together in the same breath, introducing themselves to each other, playing at being lost, playing at finding each other, playing at being older, after all this time, waiting all this time, the desperate hope that no matter the time or place, that they would find each other.
“John,” he said, tone slightly hurt, just ever so reproachful. “You’re not afraid of me, are you?”
John clutches at Sherlock’s waist, his whole body pressed to Sherlock’s back with the wind whistling past, the thrum of the motorcycle rumbling beneath them.
Sherlock kisses up his neck and tells him about New York, about Boston, about London, all the places that John’s never been, while his fingers work on opening his shirt.
“You’d never be happy and you’d always be wondering why, what could possibly be missing. Eventually you’d run off, unable to take it anymore, and if you didn’t, if you stayed because of your compulsion to do the right thing, to be good, you’d be slowly dying, drowning in the mundanity of it all, just like all these people around you, with their dull little lives. Suffocated by normality.”
“That’s terrible,” John said, and truly he was horrified. This seemed like a sort of magic in itself, but it was all things that could be solved through logic - a magical
John awoke to an earthquake, or rather, he was being roughly shaken awake. His first thought was of Sherlock, because that seemed to be Sherlock’s forte, manhandling people with head injuries, until he heard Bill’s voice say, “Oh, thank great Merlin he’s alive!”
Madam Pomfrey sighed, the long-suffering sigh of a much-beleaguered woman who knew when to cut her losses. She cast a quick
“You have those?” John said. His breath hitched with the way that Sherlock’s hand was moving. “News to me.”
It wasn’t scary the way that monsters were scary, it was more…that word, intimi-dating. Like people could be, and as Mum had said, you musn’t be intimidated. It always made John think of some sort of bizarre ritual of dating, which made perfect sense to him, since all dating was weird and foreign.
“I...ah!” John arched his chest out more in response to the firm squeeze Sherlock gave his nipple on that side. Pain, pleasure and uncertainty melded together beautifully in his expression. He could claim he didn’t like this--and Sherlock wouldn’t argue with him just yet, if John needed time to get used to the idea--but his body told Sherlock the truth.
“Who?” John said. “I hadn’t noticed him,” he said, although he felt like he always noticed whenever Sherlock walked into a room. Everybody did. Sherlock was someone of note.
"Demanding, aren't we?" Sherlock said, arching a brow. He pushed his fingers in hard then, a nice direct thrust to John's prostate that made him cry out, sharp, hips jerking up and precum dribbling out.
“Good.” Sherlock rewarded him with a nip to his throat, a quick pinch to his nipple.
he thought fervently to himself.
“Oh, god, yes,” John said, pushing his hips forward so he could rub himself against Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock immediately took his hand away. Jerk.
had come from.) She let him kiss her there, and it was all sweet and soft and not like kissing Sherlock at all (and his stomach knotted up funny, thinking of Sherlock) and although it seemed that they both enjoyed it he couldn’t help smiling with relief when she said, “Just kissing, John,” because she was a good girl, you see.
Sherlock’s room still smells of him. Since Victor has moved in his sheets smell of the both of them, Sherlock and Victor both intertwined. John’s heart flutters a rapid tattoo in his chest, his breath fast and his whole body riding high on some strange crest of adrenaline, spiked with potent lust. But Victor is a gentle, careful lover, patient, slow - asking, “Is this all right?” with each touch, expertly stroking his cock in a way that John’s never experienced before, whispering, “Relax”, hushing, “Say stop if you need to,” with his fingers slick with lube sliding inside of John where he’s never had anything before, meticulously stretching him open, rubbing some place inside John that he knows, clinically, is his prostate but Jesus Christ how it shocks him, makes his body jerk and his dick twitch, and Victor is touching him and teasing him and stretching him until John is shaking and moaning for it, mouth open and gasping in Sherlock’s sheets.
When Sherlock hedges close John tenses, knowing much about fighting and what to expect. Growing up small he’d had to learn kids some respect, had himself learned the taste of blood early on in life. He can sidestep a punch easily enough but doesn’t know how to miss this, something else this, hands on his shoulders and his back slammed up against the locker, and time slowing to molasses when Sherlock’s face comes close and then closer and then -
Sherlock scowled at her, and probably thought a lot of rude things, but to his credit, he did not say them. He was only rude with his eyes. His eyes were being downright shocking, and John thought if that look translated into words they would be the type to make his aunt Agatha have one of her famous conniptions.
The small crowd of people who had gathered watching the confrontation quickly dispersed, leaving Sherlock in the middle of the hallway, with all his scattered papers and books all around him.
MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! I always associate Potter things with Christmas. THIS CHAPTER MADE POSSIBLE BY THE FOLLOWING PEOPLE:
John was up to his chest in the water, giggling and splashing. That was not the sight that stopped Hazel dead in the sand.
” Bill said. “The Liz-Bean is the magic bean and then there's a baby and that's why they call two ladies Liz-Beans.
“There isn’t any homework you could possibly be doing?” Professor Hudson asked him.
Their church was old - considered historic, in fact; built about one hundred and fifty years ago, when their town was first founded. Since then it had been renovated a few times, fitted with modern amenities. It had been completely rebuilt once, at the turn of the century, after a great fire burned it to the ground.
Sherlock nodded. He knew what it felt like, sometimes, to be the only one in the world of something.
“Sherlock’s not weird,” John said. Bill rolled his eyes.
“John?” Hazel knocked on the door. There was no sound from inside the bathroom, not even those of water splashing or childish imitations of explosions.
The only problem was that it was very large, and the shelves towering and arranged in labyrinthine formation, which made it very difficult to find anybody inside it, nevermind a Slytherin first year who usually did not want to be found.
It possessed that comforting smell of old books and knowledge, the way that all libraries do, and it was magic, as all libraries are, only this being a magical library, it was particularly full of magic. John felt at home at once.
in this soup. Ugh. If only it weren’t split-pea. Yuck.”
He pulled at John’s trousers with rough hands. He stripped him hurriedly and hastily, needing to see him, all of him, needing to touch him in all the places where he’d once been denied.
“Umm…He used to make a barking noise,” John explained, cheeks warm with how babyish the toy was. But it wasn’t Gladstone’s fault that that was the way he was designed.
“Drat!” said Bill, and curled the ends of his moustache between thumb and forefinger. “Foiled again.”
. Not exactly bedtime material. Then he opens the book and pictures of James Dean fall out.
The older boy poured into the room like a shadow - motions graceful and fluid. When he stood up he seemed to unfold; he was shockingly tall. His mere presence enveloped everything. He took up the corner where he stood, making John’s room appear suddenly too small. John gasped, in spite of himself, instinctively taking another step back. He’d never seen Sherlock at his full height before. He hadn’t expected him to be so much, well, bigger, on top of everything else.
, you bloody idiot!” Sherlock reprimanded him, giving him a little shake. “What do you have brains for if you don’t use them to
I’m alive, get off of me, you prat!” was what John tried to say, but it came out sounding much more like, “Mmmrph mmmff mmmff, mmf mfff mf me, mmmo mratfff.”
Sherlock does, and he listens to the giggles flourish into gasps, with John’s little body clenching in waves around him.
He opened his trunk and started tossing things haphazardly inside of it, occasionally missing and generally making a great big mess of the dormitory. He decided he liked it. Messes were satisfying.
“Is it the fear that keeps you believing? That’s no way to live. There’s so much you can have, that you don’t know you could have, if only you weren’t afraid. Fear is just another way to control you.”
He brings his hand to John’s mouth, presses it against his lips.
“What is that?”
at the
“Bill, that’s creepy,” John said. “Don’t do that.”
“An enemy,” the Head Boy replied, all too easily.
John knows that feeling, of something being new and yet it has somehow existed all along.
“No?” Sherlock said. John shook his head again, making small, pleading noises, pitched with desperation. John was feverish with need, sick with it. It made Sherlock feel sick, almost, a swirling feeling in the pit of his stomach and the depths of his chest, with how much he wanted him.
“You’d have to entice it with food or something. Most slugs eat leaves and detritus. Sometimes flowers. Fortunately for us, we are in a greenhouse,” Sherlock said, and plucked a leaf from some nearby wild daisies.
“We are going to try to be better,” Mike said definitively. “Aren’t we, Bill?”
“Oh,” said Sherlock, visibly relieved. John smiled. “That’s all right, then,” Sherlock said. He smiled tentatively back at John, an expression that was slow, a great deal shyer than before and slightly crooked, almost unsure. It was nothing like that great big toothy smile he’d given John earlier, but this one made John feel warm all over.
“Oh.” The corners of Sherlock’s lips twitched. Manipulation, then. The dirty sod was enjoying himself. He was probably gauging how much he had to pout before John would start singing his praises. “I can think of many ways.”
“That’s hardly fair,” he whined. “It’s usually Bill who blows up the cauldron.”
“Of course!” said Bill, smacking himself on the forehead. “Why didn’t I see it before? You’re small and light and I bet you’re really quick. Perfect!”
No, no, no. Not casual enough. Not cool at all.
“John!” she screamed, “John!” - until her voice was hoarse. There was no reply.
Regardless, John found new friends and if he thought at all about the boy that he’d met on the train, the boy that he’d wanted to be his Housemate, he made no indication of it. Sherlock hadn’t seen him between classes at all. During mealtimes Sherlock watched John laugh it up with his new mates, sitting with his back to the Slytherin table.
It’s obvious when John is going to come, his movements more frantic, his breathing gone ragged, teeth scraping against Sherlock’s open palm. Sherlock presses down with his hand, his other hand sliding into the golden strands of John’s hair, fingers tangling, tugging. John squeezes his eyes shut and gasps, body arching up before he completely buckles like a bridge collapsing. Sherlock bites the back of his own hand when he comes, as if pressing a kiss to John’s open mouth that travels straight through the flesh.
“There’s only a little bit left,” Sherlock told John, and smoothed his fingers through soft blond hair, petting him. “You can lick it for me, can’t you? Show me how you use your tongue.”
“Sorry!” John apologised.
“Well, you know what!”
“Oh,” said John, and looked over to Sherlock, who was completely focused on his plant as he spoke. Sherlock did not look up at him, and was, instead, prodding at one of the growths on the plant.
“Right,” said John, who did not even know how second cousins worked.
party inside John’s stomach.
There was a sudden loud splashing sound coming from inside the cave where it got all dark, echoing off the walls.
The cross hung upside-down.
The touch, the closeness makes them frantic, skin to skin with jeans still on and the bed beneath them. Heat like molten iron inside of him, starts up right between his legs and shivers in his stomach and in his core and the whole of him on fire, his prick hard enough to fuck through steel. John moaning against him when he feels it, not saying stop now when Sherlock palms him through his jeans, kneading and massaging his cock. Hand around Sherlock’s wrist like he wants to push him away but instead he just holds and squeezes.
The lack of John made his arms ache and left his front cold, but it was worth it to watch the sudden deprivation rip through John’s frame. He twisted around to look at Sherlock, puzzled betrayal shining magnificently in his eyes.
He rocked up, fast and sharp, a direct stab into John’s prostate, all swollen and sensitive for him.
“Bloody bastard,” John managed, eyes squeezed tight and hands grappling at Sherlock’s back, blunt nails digging into the shifting muscle. He could feel the heaviness of the leather straps around John’s wrists, and when he thrusted hard the chain jangled, so he did it again, and listened to the chain and the sharp “
