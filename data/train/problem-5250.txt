“Don’t worry Cas.” He says, once sufficiently recovered, though still bright red. “There’s other things we can do.”
Castiel is thrilled. Castiel has found a way to fly again. He pushes back with enthusiasm, groaning happily. Feels Dean’s tongue tracing his lips and cradles the back of his head, short hairs soft under his fingertips.
“Ssshh…” Dean soothes against the damp skin, making him shiver. Cas grinds up against him as he pulls his face closer kissing him desperately, messily.
“You can’t go into this half-heartedly. Because I don’t think Cas will.”
Castiel just folds his arms expectantly.
“Jesus Cas, that is so fucking tempting you have no idea…”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because he knows how he tastes now. He can remember how Dean’s body had surged against his. He can still hear the greedy moan that had sounded nothing at all like revulsion. And he doesn’t understand any of it. Doesn’t understand why Dean is acting cold, like they didn’t burn together little under an hour ago. Like that kiss didn’t leave them both hot and shaking.
“I’m glad you’re okay,” Sam states sincerely. He reaches out, holds the hand that’s not hooked up to any machine, squeezes tightly for a moment.
“You don’t want to do this,” Castiel says clearly, trying not to shiver from how cold it had become. There was an electric charge in the air, like the calm before a lightning storm. A sense of something building. Something unpleasant, bitter and violent waiting to be unleashed.
“Yes Dean?” It slips out, teasingly innocent in tone. Castiel bites his lip to stop himself adding anything more. What is wrong with him today? Acting like a teenager…
“So fucking hot….Who new?” Dean half-laughs. His other hand is running up and down the soft skin of Castiel’s thigh soothingly.
Sam glared. “Don’t you dare. Last time, I had a bruise shaped like a bowling ball. You say away from first aid!” He ordered, then cursed inwardly. Humour was Dean’s way of deflecting. It wasn’t going to work this time. “What did you say?”
No amount of threats, pestering, begging, blackmailing or pleading had gotten Dean to confess what he had done to make Sam well again.
Dean’s voice rumbled below him, familiar, comforting. He could feel Dean’s erection against his inner thigh, shifted a little so as not to excite or frustrate further. He’d felt so
“You like this?” There’s something almost triumphant in Dean’s voice that tells him he doesn’t need to answer. Especially when his body answers for him, practically jolting when Dean’s thumb rubs just right along his slit. The Winchester’s other hand rubs circles against his hip, kneading the smooth surface whilst expertly pinning him down.
"What’s wrong?" The low, gravel tones make his stomach writhe. He’s close, too close…
Sam will understand – he hopes. He is however, unsure of how Dean will react. A part of him feels like Dean hasn’t really processed the changes in their relationship. Now he has to.
He knows this is the place. He gets out of baby and wanders over to the large barn doors, only opening them wide enough to slip through. No dramatic entrances for him, that was Cas’s forte.
Everything perfect comes at a price.
“Good.”
“What if he sells his soul for me again? I can’t let him go to hell again, I won’t.” Sam had sworn for the hundredth time, fever making him ramble repeatedly.
But then the hands are on his belt, unbuckling, unbuttoning, pulling his jeans down so he is no longer confined. His eyes shoot open when Cas’ hand gingerly wraps around him, over-stimulating against the cotton of his boxers. He leaks into the material, so eager.
They stay locked like that for a moment, Dean drinking in the pleasure Castiel was willingly giving him. Until his eyes shot open with realisation.
“You and everyone else.” He chokes out between coughs, trying to salvage his tattered reputation as the cool Winchester.
They are sparring. In a freezing cold, empty room in the ‘Batcave.’ It has rubber floors and walls reminiscent of an insane asylum, but this doesn’t seem to bother Dean much, who proclaimed it would make an ‘awesome’ training room.
They pull up to the bunker at the break of dawn.
“Stop. Just stop.” He gasps. He bucks Dean off so he’s left sprawled over Cas’ legs looking befuddled.
“What?!” Dean snaps, interrupts. “Can you get his grace back or not?”
A few minutes later and there’s the angry slamming of a door followed by silence. Someone’s stormed off. To cool down he hopes, as opposed to gone forever. He guesses it was Dean. He always seems to run away lately, instead of facing things head on. Taking what he wants and needs…
angry. Just admit it.”
After, they just held each other – something so small that means so much. Dean wiped them down with a pair of boxers, limbs heavy, and after discarding them, rolled back into the heat of Castiel’s arms.
The way Dean’s face simultaneously lights up and grows darker has Castiel’s mouth going dry.
“That’s the bit that annoys you? Inaccessible sex supplies?” He chokes out.
Dean makes soothing sounds and strokes him awkwardly, hand trapped under a layer of denim and between their bodies.
Shirtless make-out sessions on Dean’s bed once Sam has left the bunker... Slightly adolescent, yet right now he’s finding it hard to care.
“I’m broken.” He states again, a hollow echo of his words on the roof.
He doesn’t get it. “Am I still what?”
. He always knew it but never admitted it. He wants to make him come undone at the edges. He’s seen the way Cas looks at him, like he could be everything to him. He wants to make the angel lose that careful tight control, mess him up a little. Make him messy, open, vulnerable and human…
A devilish grin spreads across Dean’s features. “Is that how it is? Trying to seduce the truth out of me now?”
Castiel is panting, toes curling against the bed spread. He’s sweating now. Never liked that body function before. It was always kind of repulsive to him. You did it when you lose control, when uncomfortable: too hot, in pain... But this, breathing in Dean’s scent, being pulled apart beneath him… he could get used to it. It’s a good loss of control.
It was only a kiss.
There is suddenly miles of skin to explore - toned, golden, firm yet yielding. Castiel runs his hands over his chest, savouring the heat, the way Dean tenses, bucks up a little beneath him. He presses indents into skin, makes Dean laugh when he traces the muscles of his abdomen, nails lightly grazing. He finds the anti-possession tattoo, traces its stark lines before placing a messy kiss over it. Dean’s breath hitches as he scrapes his teeth over the mark, presses his cheek against the heat so he can feel his racing heart.
And with that, he made his way to the heavy bulk headed door. But not before Dean could swoop by out of nowhere to lean close so he could whisper: “If you want to do something reckless, how about you come with me?”
“Dean. I’m trying to help. I’m just concerned.” Dean snorts at that.
“Oh God,” He moans.
“What is it?” He asks curtly.
Castiel had been sat on the sofa in the makeshift living room of the bunker. He was considering which movie to watch on their improvised date night (though Sam may have shown up at any moment given that he had not been informed of said unofficial date night). Then Dean had appeared in the doorway. Leaning casually, but watching Cas as he scrolled through Sam’s movie downloads stored tidily on his laptop.
He does. And it feels good. So damn good.
“Because that body wasn’t ever a vessel. She was reborn human.”
“What is this?” He sees Cas' eyes flicker down to where Dean is hard, before obviously snapping away again, jaw set and cheeks reddening. He likes it.
So he’d vaguely understood that food could be emotionally comforting. From Famine’s example, to the way Dean had always enjoyed pie, eyes crinkling happily, little sounds of pleasure escaping that Cas had admittedly found rather cute, even in his angel days. Mary Winchester used to make Dean pie. Castiel learnt this by peaking in his head. It was hard not to see. Dean had so much love in him. Such adoration was associated with the snack food, ideas of love and home. Castiel couldn’t understand it, but he came to love that about Dean.
“Oh.” Castiel fights back a blush, swallowing hard when Dean reaches his throat, clamps down and sucks another bruise on his right side this time, without any warning. A groan is ripped out of Castiel and his eyes flutter as he pushes his hips up into Dean’s. The hard line of him finds friction against Dean’s solid thigh and it leaves him aching.
“Not everything is your responsibility.” He answers calmly, knowing Dean won’t listen.
“He’s with you now isn’t he?” He asks lightly, suggesting that’s worth all the trouble, so Dean can interpret it any way. He carefully keeps his face blank.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ones I love. He’ll process that later. The stupid heart monitor speeds up a little which he finds vaguely embarrassing. Stop that. Dean is hurting.
Castiel has never been so sorely tempted to head-butt him. But the sight of Dean slicking himself up with the nearby gun oil is worth waiting for. He feels his mouth drop open and knows that image will be seared into his memories until the day he dies.
Dean is pressing so gently, barely placing any weight upon him. He’s holding on to Cas as if he were fragile, which he is now, to an extent. The angels were fond of choking him. He blocks those thoughts out, concentrates on holding Dean, keeping Dean.
His slid his own hand to join in, to grip Dean’s length, press their cocks so they could gently rock together. He slid his hand over Dean’s so they could slip over both their lengths, find their pleasure together. It was a slow, gentle, controlled, simmering heat. This position did not require any exertion, he was relaxed, at ease, desperate for more.
He rolls over in bed and is alone in body and mind. He feels so
Dean says nothing. It’s almost as bad as a protest.
“But Sam…” Cas trails off, feeling hopeful. Perhaps Dean doesn’t mind whether Sam knows or not.
He flopped back into bed next to Cas, led on his side so he could face him. Castiel rolled back onto his side, so he could whisper more confessions in the dark.
A blow to the right this time that nearly knocks him unconscious from her impossible strength. The chair would have tipped over if the male angel hadn’t started forward to catch him. His face throbs and there’s blood on his lips. He can feel his face swelling by each passing second. The pain is so strong, but he is unused to it, every time, it takes him by surprise. He does not know how Sam and Dean can stand it, in every fight against every supernatural threat they have faced.
His fingers grip Cas’ soft hair and he just about bucks into the sturdy warmth of him. Any other man would have been taken aback by such a sudden, forceful kiss, but not Cas. He’s still in the same place. He’s not just a man. He’s so strong, it makes Dean want him more. He's never wanted anyone so badly his entire life.
“Secrets are bad Dean. I know we haven’t been the same since you healed me.” Sam pushed his anger down once more. This wasn’t about that, but the thought of Dean, striking some mystery deal to cure him, made him feel cold all over. It was like the hell deal all over again. He couldn’t let that go. Couldn’t stand to see Dean suffer for his sake once more.
By the time Castiel has scrambled into a sitting position, he is alone with his thoughts once more.
He wants to have this this. Wants to keep Dean Winchester.
Cas doesn’t have the energy to answer that. Or to worry that they’re still alive. The brothers must have banished them. Doesn’t care. He’s falling. Always falling, so cold, even in Dean’s arms. So tired.
Everything takes so much longer to do now. Going somewhere for example. Once a journey was effortless. A blink of an eye and a flutter of wings was all it took. Now travelling is arduous and grating. Getting from one place to another requires hours of being confined within a metal box - sometimes the bus, often the Impala. He finds it hard to share the brothers’ enthusiasm for such means of transportation. It’s jarring, the contrast between freedom and constriction. It’s just so time consuming. He can never relax en route, though he does try. The Impala means so much to Dean and Sam. It’s their moving home where they feel at ease.
Sam empathises. Made all the right sounds of condolence, the reassurances of time being a great healer. He emphasises that at least Cas has Dean, they have each other. They’ll be fine. All the while he wonders.
Dean grins and rolls his eyes. “I know that Einstein.” He looks less smug when Castiel peels his underwear away. Remembering his own fantasy, he licks his own hand first before wrapping it around Dean’s member loosely.  Dean swallows hard. He circles the stiffness obligingly and begins to pump, imitating Dean’s actions before. Dean watches this whole process silently, mouth agape.
“But…” Castiel feels his face fall. But. Here it comes. The excuses. He doesn’t want him after all – why would he? This isn’t going to happen.
Dean determinedly looks away, foraging in the box for more first aid tools.
care about the sex stuff a bit. But only because you’re so fucking hot and I want you so damn much.” Dean blurted out. “You’re
“I can do this. I am good at this,” Castiel repeated several times to himself as he entered a busy junction.
“So you want to turn into a Cas-icle?”
Dean’s achingly hard by the time he gets to his room. He laughs at the ludicrous situation, running his hands through his hair in frustration. He feels like a god-damn teen – no,
To abandon his ailing brother was out of character enough, but the look of fierce determination had scared Castiel deeply. It was the look someone gets before doing something exceedingly reckless, a desperate last resort.
Ambush.
Reviews are appreciated. Thank you.
Dean can’t let him leave. Won’t. “Well, maybe it is the mark talking. Maybe it is making me braver, stupider, a little more honest. Thank God it’s good for something.” His voice catches then, causing Cas to meet his eyes. “I’m scared Cas,” he admits. “I’m so God-dammed scared of how it’s changing me.”
“Cas, Castiel, this is – I can’t…tight, it’s just…” Castiel takes his face in his hands and kisses him deeply, messily.
The airs smells electrified like that very first introduction. Hazy sunlight filters through the gaps in the walls, highlighting motes of dust. The sigils and warding signs still remain, covering every square inch of wall and floor. Dean smiles. They had been so afraid of him, he and Bobby. Castiel had been something vast and unknowable. Dean had forgotten what that had felt like, the awe of being in his presence. Cas was still a miracle, but a little more human now, touchable. If he was brave enough.
Dean pauses. He fidgets. Doesn’t meet Castiel’s eyes. This only increases Cas’ curiosity. He sits still and waits for it to come, still so patient.
“It doesn’t matter.” Cas gasps out, lips swollen. It’s not the only part of him that is, a thrilling prospect. “You push down everything for so long…”
He is careful, pulls Dean close to his neck, just holds him, strokes his hair soothingly as Dean breathes shakily against him. He’s held him like this before, after making love, but this is different. They are a little more broken, more desperate than they’ve ever been. He wonders how they will move past this, if they can. He thinks he feels wetness against his neck, though knows better than to mention it.
“Touch me,” He orders.
He’d borrowed one of the shiny ‘sexy cars’ as Dean had termed it, from the bunker garage, and set off to the nearest store, list in hand. And he could drive just fine. Sort of. Dean had been teaching him. All he needed was more practice. It wasn’t that difficult anyway. Castiel had become a very cautious driver, mortality at the forefront of his mind.
He worries that the Winchesters will realise he is useless to them now. He cannot even aid them on a basic salt and burn mission without being injured by a mightily pissed off ghost. He could not smite the spirit. Couldn’t even distract it for long. Sam was hurled soon after which was worse because he still wasn’t fully recovered from the trials. He tries to forget the angry whispers on the drive home as he slumped in the back seat. He thinks they were arguing about ‘taking Cas on hunts.’ The thought hurts far more than the physical injury itself.
“I’m not! Just drop it okay? Me and Cas? Off-limits. It’s new. It’s private. I don’t even know what it is, so stop pushing.” He emphasises those last words, pushing up to his feet before pacing the hall.
Dean’s moving fast now, hips hypnotically smooth but thrusting in harder, until they are both moaning at how much it feels. He curves into Castiel’s body, kissing his chest, mouthing at a nipple. Castiel is nearly sobbing now, the pleasure is so bright, yet he’s still achingly, wonderfully full. He slips a hand between them, skims his fingertips over the place where they are joined, skin stretched, senstitive and damp. Dean nearly loses it when he notices this.
Sam clears his throat. Waits.
The conclusions they had drawn from local news reports proved to be entirely correct. There had been an unusually high occurrence of heart attacks all within the same office block in Kansas City. Four heart attacks within two weeks pointed to something supernatural (“Either that or a killer lunch menu , right Cas?”).
“I’m so sorry.” They can read his thoughts, can hear his sincerity. He’s starting to feel so cold now, shock setting in. “I let you down. I let you all down.”
“No, not just trying. You are going to make this right. You fucked up big time Cas. But we will fix this together because that is what we do. It’s what you have to do.”
“Not at all.”
“Never mind that now,” The angel stuffs his hands into his pockets, making himself seem even smaller somehow, less threatening. Dean doesn’t trust it for one second. This man is a snake. “What is it that you wanted anyway? Make it quick. Being King of Heaven is a pretty time consuming job.”
“Yes, I think so.”
He pushes the handle down, turns away.
He hopes he gets to do it again.
—————-
Dean leans closer over the table, pinning him with those eyes, oblivious to other customers. His pupils are blown and Castiel feels trapped.  “And what’s that then?” He hears the dare in his voice.
“You see Castiel, you’re responsible for getting us kicked out of heaven.” His voice is low and so dangerous. He never breaks eye contact all the while. “Now my friend Lia here, would be happy to just carve you up and walk away. But I think you know more than you’re telling. So let’s compromise, yeah? Let’s see what secrets I can carve out of you.”
“Just making sure you’re okay.” He replied, edging back to the door.
Dean promptly drops his hands and proceeds to cough up a lung. He looks as though Cas had bonked him on the head. And shuffles in his seat, hands covering his lap for some reason.
“What are you doing? It’s damn near freezing up here.”
“Thanks Cas. Thanks for being so ridiculously cool.” He grins, leaning over to briefly place his hand on top of Castiel’s. He smiles brightly back at him.
Dean hears his heart increase too. His head was pillowed in his hands as he dosed fitfully next to Cas’ bed. Now he looks up to meet Cas’ eyes, to reach out and cup his face so gently, he can barely feel it.
Cas is thrumming lightly against him and he wraps his arms around Dean in a grip so tight it is bruising. Dean’s hand find its way into that hair and runs it through his fingers over and over, murmuring soft words of comfort:
Dean isn’t sharing anything with Castiel right now either. The atmosphere is intense, so awkward, that even Cas can take a hint and realise how uncomfortable he has made his friend. He’s surprised Dean didn’t just drive off without him after the case was solved.
In the peace of that hospital, surrounded by family, Cas smiles slightly, closes his eyes, and sleeps.
only a punch bag, Dean thinks sombrely each time he strikes. He’s starting to think it’s not enough. There’s no challenge. The bag takes his punches but doesn’t fight back. There’s no rush, no adrenaline, just this. Endless frustration, anger and an underlying current of fear. He grunts with every hit, sweating from exertion as the bag swings wildly on its strained, clanking chains.
It wasn’t that he didn’t trust Dean, quite the opposite. It was the fact that his body no longer reacted to the unexpected with eagerness and excitement so much anymore. Just shock. And occasionally some fear. He could never completely relax. Couldn’t allow himself to lose control.
“I really don’t see the point in this Dean.” Though admittedly, he’s enjoying the closeness this exercise provides an excuse for. Dean. Standing an arm’s length away. Looking all serious - or at least trying to. The corners of his mouth keep twitching though his eyes remain intent. The itch is back and he has to fight not to step right into Dean’s personal space. He is in control. He is not some over-sexed teenager, no matter how Dean may make him feel.
Cas didn’t think. He just knew. He knew they must have overlooked something. It must still be here. So small, so crucial to life…
“Trust me, I know.” He grinned smugly and Cas just had to collect that smile with another kiss, drawn to his light. “We gotta do
“Of what we can do together.” Dean’s voice goes very low and eager. It does things to Castiel’s internal temperature. Suddenly the whole diner burns away until it’s just them.
“So he isn’t angry?”
“I’m gonna kill those bastards,” He vows bitterly.
“Dean I-”
The bone-deep sensation hits him like a fist. He craves him in a deep, carnal and shockingly primal way. It’s in his guts. His blood plunges south. He feels dizzy, short of breath, heart pounding. He can’t take his eyes from the man. He has never felt this way about anyone. Never. A wave of lust washes over him so fiercely; it’s all he can do to stop his knees from buckling. Or from taking action, pushing the angel back into the wall and taking him right there, showing him what a real man feels like. A true introduction to fucking. Something real, unlike that little reaper of his.
“Huh. Guess not.” He can hear the teasing smile in Dean’s voice and tries to contain a grin, unsuccessfully. He feels too happy, content, weightless. He’s never felt this relaxed before. Such a contrast to his first weeks as a human. The loneliness, hunger, guilt and horror… He sighs and skims his hand down Dean’s back, relishing the sigh the action elicits, getting lost in the motion.
“What Cas?” He asks softly, cupping his cheek, leaning closer. Cas slides nearer in response. “What?”
Yeah. Yes. He said yes.
He feels like rolling Dean off the bed then. He was being entirely serious. It’s a good thing he no longer has his powers. He would smite a pharmacy to get what they need. Dean is keeping him waiting and he’s so painfully turned on, frustrated and in love, he could cry and laugh at the same time. It’s a little hysterical. Hormones are a serious business, he realises. He wonders if it feels this way for everybody. If it leaves everyone feeling held to ransom like this.
Jealously and revulsion push at the edges of his lust-filled mind. This is
He’s lying in bed, in his sparse room, wearing only a comfy pair of sleep pants. It doesn’t quite feel like home yet but he’s trying. He doesn’t own much in the way of possessions. Just a few books, amongst them a battered, but beautifully engraved bible Dean had found for him in a thrift shop, and a few items of clothing.
“’You got’ Jesus?” Castiel dead-pans.
“Yeah…” Dean murmurs. “I got you. Just like that.” His voice is soft and breathy.
He once used to be taller than this building, he remembers telling them. He could laugh at the irony of it all.
When Cas pulls away to look at him with startled eyes, blown pupils, he practically sobs from the loss of contact. Buries his face in the warm crook of the angel’s neck and just breathes, tries to slow this train down. He feels those hands stroke the back of his neck.
“Interesting,” Metatron muses, smiling at his feet as he paces the room. “I might be able to give him that…Maybe not
Dean’s jaw clenches but his eyes are steely, accustomed to patching up himself and his brother. “Must be weird for you, first battle wound and all.”
“I just – I suppose you would say I have ‘a thing’-“ he makes an air quote gesture. “-about my neck. Ever since Metatron…” He tries to be matter of fact but his voice shakes a little. He settles for making a slashing gesture across his neck.
He reaches down between their bodies and wraps his hand around Dean’s cock.
Castiel digs his hands into Dean’s hair, settles for another kiss. Dean’s eyelashes are soft against his face. It doesn’t take long for him to respond, mouth open, hot, wet and so ridiculously prefect he could laugh. He’s pushing Dean back onto the bed this time, taking charge. Crawling on top, he nudges his legs apart so he can settle between them. He gives him one long kiss before wordlessly pulling back with a wet smack. He leans back so he can savour the sight of a heavy-lidded Dean Winchester - mouth open and face flushed - looking up at him.
He leans forward, acting casual to hide his racing heart. “Really?”
“Don’t make any deals Dean, please! Not again!”
“Well I don’t.”
“Not my first.” Castiel automatically corrects.
“Not a crime,” He finally murmurs in response to Cas’ question, heat simmering through him. He can hear his own heart beating. The mark thrums gently, like an itch under his skin that he just can’t scratch. His breathes heavily.
“C’mon Cas.” Dean sounds like he’s scolding him again. “We’re both too old to park… Especially you, yikes.”
Dean takes a deep breath, takes himself in hand, lining himself up, before freezing.
Then Cas is kissing him again, he can’t not. His former angelic touch cures all ills. No disease for Dean. Dean is pure. Dean is
“I love you,” Dean stated quietly in the darkness, tone slightly uncertain.
“Only the past week.” He admits reluctantly. “And are we really talking about this? Shall I set the aromatherapy up or do you want to skip straight to the gossip and pillow fight?”
He’s trying to sleep but he can hear the brothers arguing. Angry murmurs that buzz through the bunker, filled with pent-up frustration. They often bicker but this time they really mean it. He can tell. Dean’s secret keeps them apart. Sam’s new determination to cure demons is another matter of dispute since Dean cannot understand it. Perhaps he should try to intervene, the mediate, but maybe he agrees with Sam too much. They need to have it out. Dean has to tell them if he struck a bargain for Sam’s life. And to cure is better than to kill. He can see that now.
“Enjoy your meal,” She says dazedly, staring back and forth between Dean and Castiel.
Castiel doesn’t know how. Neither does Sam. But they are both in complete agreement that Dean must have done something very foolish. Cas had seen Sam’s illness before falling, gotten a good look at it. He saw enough to know that Sam was damaged on a deep, molecular level. Abandoning the trials would not change that. To recover from such devastation is nothing short of miraculous.
“And I will always be here to help you,” He answers, voice low and mischievous, though he means every word.
Castiel licks his lips and pulls himself to his feet, unsure of whether or not to follow. He thinks he should give the brothers some space. As long as Sam can make his peace with his brother’s new relationship, he doesn’t see why this should be a bad thing. No more sneaking around. More time together and no excuses needed.
Everything is so much smoother for Dean then. Dean’s hand fits over Cas’, guided him with precision until he can find his own release. He grunted, almost animalistic. Cas doesn’t have to tell him not to bite.
“I don’t - because… shut up Cas that’s why.” Dean blurts out, voice rumbling. Castiel feels something warm in his chest. It could be a glimmer of hope though he has no idea why. He is so very cold. He’s empty and grieving. For himself and his fallen brothers and sisters. They’re out there. And they’ll tear the world apart in their desperation to regain heaven. Castiel can relate.
grace per-se but potato potahto. Perhaps you could even go and get it yourself as part of my original IOU! Yes, I can think of a few pesky targets! Two birds, one stone…” He seems to be talking to himself rather than Dean, but the greedy look in his eyes is not encouraging.
“Is he smiling?” Sam asks, smiling himself though in relief. It’s worrying that he can’t tell.
He grins and dips back into Cas’ body without so much as a warning so he can repeat the action, causing Castiel to yelp. This time, when Castiel moans, he doesn’t withdraw. He does it again, more confidently. Harder, a little faster, twisting inside so pleasure zips up Cas’ spine. Castiel’s fingers shift to Dean’s body, scrabbling to find purchase and they slip up his back, haul him closer, pushing Dean deeper inside as an accidental consequence.
Street lights illuminate his face in flashes. It is not a happy face.
There was no kindness or relief in that voice, only a cold kind of triumph. And anticipation. He didn’t think he would like what the voice had in store for him.
“I gripped you tight in Perdition…” He trails off, thoughts a mess.
And so Dean, still at a loss for words, does the only thing he can think of to make Cas stop, to make him see that Dean feels the exact same way.
That, at least, is what Castiel is forcibly reminded of, with every shy smile that passes between him and Dean. Every time they resist a public display of affection to not further traumatise Sam. Sometimes he thinks they started running before they could truly walk. And now it feels like they are struggling to get to know one another again, in a more intimate manner.
“I want him safe.” Dean answers, unfazed. He has never felt more sure about anything in his life. He won’t lose Cas again. Last time was too damn close.
He balls his hands into fists tightly enough to draw blood.
He runs the flat of his palm down Dean’s spine and practically makes a keening sound when the hunter responds by mouthing at his nipple. A scrape of teeth and the warm, wet heat of a mouth makes his head spin. Dean sucks down on one and pinches the other with deft, merciless fingers.
“Sssshh…” Cas soothes him, hands in his hair, resting their foreheads together. Castiel is panting too. “Put it all on me. I’m here for you. I’m yours.”
“I’m sorry Cas, I’m so sorry. You’ll be okay, you’re gonna be fine,” He tries to pull Cas to his feet, but Castiel’s legs won’t cooperate. He falls into Dean’s arms helplessly. The younger Winchester scoops him up, draws him close so he’s half sat on him. Sam hovers nearby.
Metatron’s grin is plain nasty. “And isn’t that what you’ve both always wanted? One big happy family, you got your brother from another mother back?” He laughs in a way that implies he knows exactly what their relationship is, and that it most certainly cannot be described as ‘brotherly’. Dean stiffens his spine, reminds himself he has nothing to be ashamed of as far as Cas is concerned.
“I’m no expert,” Dean states raggedly, grabbing one of the pillows from under Cas’ head and slipping it under his hips with a little manoeuvring. Castiel’s legs do not lose their grip during this entire process which makes Dean smile. “I’m gonna push in real slow. Tell me to stop if it hurts.”
Thanks for the Kudos. You guys rock.
“Believe me, it’s nowhere good.” His tone is grave but a bright smile follows that Cas basks within. He can almost imagine seeing the beautiful light of his soul again. “Like I’m one to lecture but still.”
“I have no logical idea. Some kind of DNA trace?”
“Whatever gets you to sleep at night.”
“Because I wanted to,” Castiel shouts back though he doesn’t know why. He also doesn’t understand why Dean’s getting so upset. All he had to do was ask. Castiel is fed up of lying, of hiding. If anything, he owes Marty the disgruntled ghost one for opening his eyes a little. Life is too short.
“My little…?” Cas is honestly baffled. The concussion is too strong. He realises this could cost him his life if he doesn’t concentrate harder. “You mean Metatron? He isn’t my friend.” Castiel protests gently, mind still fuzzy.
“This okay?” He says softly, going slow as he kisses the sensitive skin, making Castiel shiver. Dean is helping him get past the bad memories, he realises. He wants to let go, likes having Dean’s mouth there.
“Are you actually falling asleep on me?” Dean laughs and Castiel practically purrs in response. “Hang on.”
“What? What’s wrong?” He recognises that voice. It’s the fog of lust again.
Dean’s hands are back on his hips and he rocks into Castiel, unaware, the slightest movement. This makes him break off as the friction is almost enough to make Cas' eyes roll. He haphazardly palms the side Dean's face, holds him against his own, cheek to cheek so he can just breathe.
“Easy...” Dean’s voice sounds much closer now though he does not try to touch. He hears him shuffle closer hesitantly.
Shrugging off the fog of lust, he remembers. Sam knows.
Dean had calmly walked over to him then, footfalls echoing against the marble floor. He took his time, almost prowling, before sitting beside Cas, winding one arm around his waist, palming his cheek, and leaning in for the slow burn kiss.
When Dean eventually lets go, shuddering to a finish, Castiel’s shoulder is throbbing. Dean licks lazily at the indents as Cas tries to catch his breath. He runs his hands up and down Dean’s naked back. His hip aches and his mind is a puddle of pleasure. When Dean pulls back, they look at each other carefully, waiting for someone to break the silence, breathing heavy as the moment hangs suspended. Dean is still on top, arms either side of Castiel’s head on the pillow.
“Cas!” His eyes flash open, alight with pleasure, awe and amusement. “Stay still a minute or this will be over pretty damn f-fast!”
“I don’t need you to be.” Castiel counters, feeling hot, lost in those eyes. “Stop mistaking me for some vulnerable idiot – I am still a warrior of God and I’m older than you can begin to fathom.” He notices Dean’s breathing gets heavier as does his own. “I know my own mind and I know what I want.” He says firmly.
Dean mimed swatting him. This quickly lead to some very gentle play-fighting that had delighted Castiel.
“Shocked then?”
“I wish I could heal myself.”
He has to live like a human.
“Should be.” He pauses before running a hand through his tresses. “I don’t know what he wants me to say.” He admits with a sigh.
It’s a sweet and tender moment but not terribly honest. His words imply they are friends who now have sex. Castiel isn’t ignorant. He knows they are much more than that to each other – always have been - and feels a flicker of annoyance that this is what Dean is reducing them to.
He hears a snort of amusement from Sam who towers over him like the concerned giant he is. Castiel does not understand what is so amusing, perhaps it is an inside joke. He allows himself a small groan as his head gives another throb of pain.
He pulls over on the dusty roadside and takes a steadying breath. This feels right.
“You really are a child aren’t you?” Dean asks sadly, winding his arm around Cas’ shoulders as he attempts to steer him away from the edge.
“Like this, Cas?” He whispers, huskily once they’ve pulled apart. His eyes are beyond predatory. Like he wants to devour Castiel. “Exactly like this? Face to face while I fuck you?”
Dean nods. “If you want...” He adds, exposing the slightest hint of insecurity.
----------------
“Hey Cas, you’re in the hospital. You’re ok.”
He has to do all the stupid little things that never even required much thought before. Tasks such as showering. Personal hygiene is important. Dean had practically manhandled him into the bunker bathroom one day after weeks of sulking. Now he was a real boy, Castiel could smell like a real boy. This was not a good thing apparently. Even Sam had started to maintain a wary distance and Dean had made the occasional teasing remark.
again at some point though.”
“Go with what feels good.” Castiel nods frantically, echoing words from before. He decides right there and then that he won’t ask Dean to stop even if it does hurt. He wants to feel it all. Every last snag of humanity. It’s what he wants. What he needs and deserves.
He instead decides to shut Dean up by sliding a hand down his pants and squeezing just right. Just enough to make Dean whine low in his throat, laughter choking off. At least he can feel that Dean is suffering too. He lets go just as Dean begins to push desperately forward, breath shuddering out of him. He regrets it immediately. He loves bringing Dean pleasure, seeing his eyes cloud, his jaw go slack. But there’s a lesson to be learnt here.
“Lia, enough!” Commands the biker angel. “He’s human now. He’s weak. Another blow could kill him and wouldn’t that be a shame?”
“Why are you so cool about this?” He wrings his hands together, looking confused.
“Nice try with the macho-avoidance crap. How long have you and Cas - ”
“When can I go home?” His voice cracks.
“What was that?” He’s still holding Dean’s head away from his own. They would look ridiculous if Sam walked in, but Dean doesn’t blame Cas. He’s the only thing stopping him from launching again. His hands are free to wander though. He slides his hands under Cas’ shirt, pressing his fingertips into the warmth of his skin, the softness of his stomach. Castiel gasps, tries to shuffle away but Dean has already seen the way his eyes fluttered. He wants this too.
“Finish it.”
It’s true of everyone he’s ever cared about. He always seems to need them more. From the day Sam chose Stanford over him. Then demon blood. Then Ruby. Even Amelia while Dean was lost in purgatory. Benny chose to stay in that hell too. His father chose hunting over being a real dad. Even Lisa and Ben were better off without him in the end.
Dean’s eyes blazed as he met Sam’s, expression sardonic. “Why would he want to be human?” Dean said ‘human’ as though it were a dirty word. Sam had to sigh. Dean’s opinion of himself, his ideas of self-worth, were still far too low for his liking.
“Yes, I like the idea, very much so. As long as you are sincere.” He gasped out. Dean shifted slightly, pulled his hand away so he could lick it, move more smoothly against the heat of Castiel. “Oh God!”
Something passes over Cas’ expression. Something like realisation. He reaches out slowly, as though confronting a wild animal, which maybe Dean is. But he gently cups Dean’s cheek, trails cool but slightly rough fingertips across his cheekbone. Dean’s eyes flutter shut at the sensation, conflicting emotions battling to defeat the other. Cas’ touch is soothing, like a cold compress to his fevered mind. It also excites deeply. He lets out a long sigh, shakily.
He loves him. He knows it. It may have slipped out, between the babble and the begging. The groans and snarls. The cries of “Yes!” “Cas!” “Mine!” “Fuck!” and “Please!” “S-so Good.” It’s all he can say, a constant cycle.
Cas glanced up at that, to see Dean waggling his eyebrows like a fiend, trying to act normal. Cas’ mouth went dry at the sudden flurry of images that conjured.
Dean sighed, eyes slipping shut, leaving Castiel fighting a flood of arousal and hope caused by his words. He looked so peaceful, lines smoothed out, breath hot against Cas’ neck. He held him and felt something swell within.
He tries to tell himself it's anticipation making his insides squirm, not nerves, but knows this is a lie. The last time he saw Cas, the angel told him he loved him then died. That kind of thing throws a guy. And he, the suave and badass Dean Winchester, had just stared at him in disbelief, desperately trying to process the situation, and said nothing. And now Cas was free from the empty and hadn’t even sent a postcard? Sure it had only been weeks from Dean’s perspective, but still. He wondered whether the angel had been avoiding him and then chastised himself for being so needy. The entire reconstruction of heaven was an important job to do that probably ranked a little higher than a: 'Hello, Dean.'
“Please Cas. Just help. Please.” Now he’s pleading, begging, and that would be humiliating if he wasn’t’ past the point of caring.
So at Bobby’s casual mention of Cas rebuilding heaven, he simply smiles and waits. He’s gotten so good at waiting for Cas. Practically a lifetime.
The eldest Winchester responds by rolling his eyes and leaning back on his haunches. He pulls his arms from Cas’ grasp so he can cross them, looking unimpressed. “Well, that’s a moment killer.”
He finds his release first and comes hard, eyes rolling, biting his lip so he doesn’t scream. The hot sensation goes on and on, hitting himself and Dean. He thinks he may have blacked out for a second when his vision goes dark after the initial flash of light. He tastes blood from his lip and would surely fall bonelessly against the damp sheets if Dean were finished.
He’s had his doubts along the way, of course. He’s lost Cas so many times that grieving him has become second nature, right next to loving him. He aches when they are separated, even for reasons that are not part of a life or death struggle. Mundane moments such as a trip to the shop or working a case in separate states. He has to fight not to check in every hour or so with a ridiculous: “Still alive dude?”
He can feel the curve of Dean’s smile against his cheek. “I think you did too. Pretty sure actually.”
He complies, but makes a show of it. Sitting upright so Castiel is suddenly very close, nestled firmly in his lap. Cas has to swallow hard at the predatory look in his eyes.  He slowly peels the hem of his shirt up, bit by bit, muscles rippling. He tugs it over his head and chucks the offending garment away so it ceases to exist for them.
“Come on then.” Dean orders, obviously still flustered as he runs a hand through his hair. “Don’t want to worry Sam.”
Castiel wanted to jump him right there and then but he knew he couldn’t. Dean was right. His body was not ready. The ass, he thought ungraciously. He was painfully turned on and could do nothing with it. Every position was too painful, or made him panic, feel too constricted. Even the deadlock Dean had on him now was begging to get a little uncomfortable.
He aches and clenches around the base of Dean’s cock, feeling stretched, impaled around him. The way his skin pulls over his hips as he reclines back, leaves him feeling beautiful, powerful. The sounds Dean is making, shy at first, but growing louder, indulging, beginning to babble.
“No,” Cas agrees softly. “But you’re hurting yourself.”
“Could you be a little more patronising please? You know how much I love it.”
“Hmm.” He doesn’t care, keeps his eyes closed, sighs at the sensation of Dean’s touch. “Where’s Sam?”
“His factory settings would reset.”
“Nothing’s ever simple,” He agreed, since Dean seemed to want some kind of vocal acknowledgment by the way he was glaring.
When Cas next finds him, Dean is battering the stuffing out of a punch bag.
“Really? Some gift.” Dean’s lip curls as he turns around to face the angel. “Which ‘gift’ would that be? The gift of ageing? Of tricking him into betraying his family? Of cutting his throat?” It’s a struggle not to shout. A haze of red washes over Dean’s vision and his pulse pounds in his head. Metatron should tread so so carefully.
his throat. Do angels breathe?
Dean has no words to form questions, just looks at Metatron, hopes he doesn’t seem too pleading.
Sam just made an exasperated sound, looking at Castiel for backup. “Can you believe this?”
“Cas, I’m warning you, leave.” His voice shakes, his body too. He clutches his bedside table, practically gouging marks in the wood with his fingernails. It roots him to the spot. Stops him from launching at his best friend. He feels sick with lust, seeing red. He closes his eyes and takes cool air in. Doesn’t help.
“And what would it matter if it was guys anyway? Careful Sammy now, your HOMOPHOBE is showing.”
He wishes bitterly that he could have killed them. Really killed them, slowly, painfully, not just banished to Neverland. that was too easy. They could have survive.
Sam thinks the blade may have pushed primal responses to the surface. He may be right. For one thing, he’s always hungry. Not just a Dean Level of Hungry either. He ate everything in the bunker. Sam said he was worried Dean would eat the bunker. And he’s growing. His muscle mass is increasing steadily though he does very little exercise. It’s as though his body is preparing for something. When Sam looks at him, it is with a mixture of fear and concern. He doesn’t know which disturbs him more, but he can’t bear it.
He needs first aid.
He grins triumphantly and fingers the hem of Castiel’s shirt. “Now how is this fair?”
Reconnecting...
Castiel internally repeats those words as Dean apologetically presses the edges of his cut back together and slowly sticks the bandage over the top. Cas winces in spite of himself.
He doesn’t realise he’s saying the words out loud until he sees the look of twisted sympathy of Metatron’s face. It’s practically sincere and that scares him most of all.
Cas knows how to do this. And well. He doesn’t care how, or when. His wet, warm mouth offers sweet relief when it was too much. Has anyone ever done more for him? And it’s Castiel. Another layer of unreality that doesn’t feel true. It’s surreal – everything he ever wanted, though not like this. One possessive thought buzzes through his mind: he’s fucking Cas. His Castiel.
“If he became an angel again, even a pretty-boy angel, there’s no guarantee he’d be the same.” He sighs, corners of his mouth twitching. “He’d probably go back to being the original soldier boy you first met, remember? That cold default killer that Naomi turned him into millennia ago?”
“At least let me drive you somewhere! We’re practically in the middle of nowhere.” Dean insists, ignoring his brother’s question.
“I’m fine.” He hears the younger brother bristle at the reference to his overall health and appearance. The fallen angel feels a stab of worry and wishes more than ever that he could still heal others. Though he doubts there is anything he could do to help Sam. Time and patience is all they have to work with.
“I don’t want either of you to get hurt. Cas isn’t a regular guy remember? I just hope you know what you’re doing.”
“Jerk.” Dean mumbled under his breath. He knew that Sam had him there.
. “You don’t need to worry about me.”
This is spiralling out of control and he is glad. Dean makes him feel like he can fly again. Cas had only meant to clear the air, not to seduce him into this state. Dean just seems to really have a thing for dominance.
You take a deep breath. Open your eyes and let yourself look at Cas, with that new awareness.
So did you.
Don’t shut me out, not now, Dean. I deserve the truth. And Cas deserves it too.
“Dean!” Sam gets to his feet. Glaring daggers at him.
Cas. Oh god,
Episode 15.20
I never lied to you.
It’s a lot to ask of him, at this moment, but you know – you know it without a single thread of doubt – that he will come. Because he always comes when you call. Because he loves you, in this all-encompassing way you can’t wrap your head around, filling you with a glow that hasn’t entirely left you ever since he said it.
Then –
He made a deal. With the Empty. To save Jack.
We miss you too.
Hold on. You said something about Cas –
Jack made you choose.
(from the other room) Huh?
What are you going to do?
What happens now?
Listen, they’re gone now. And we need to go. Just … make sure you’re safe, all right?
This, you’ve got down.
Keep it in check, Sam.
He got cancer … and he didn’t tell me?
“Cas,” you say. Just saying his names fills you with an anticipation that makes your heart beat double time.
The hell it didn’t.
“Cas!” Sam’s gasp is as instant as Dean’s own.
It will allow me to pass into Heaven whenever I choose to.
Dean turns.
When he was happy.
Whatever boundaries you want to set, he’ll respect them. You know that, right?
Morning.
Death isn’t life. Heaven, no matter how peaceful, isn’t life. It never will be.
You do that.
I think there’s something over there. We should probably check it out.
Well. Then I guess you don’t have to worry about it, right? You do what you have to do. Cas is going to understand that.
It’s been a while, right? Recently Eileen’s been taking more cases than I. But I’m almost done with grading, it’s a good time to get back on the road.
Son of a …
Move on to where?
Anyway, thanks.
Er … No, thanks.
No. You don’t get to ‘Dean’ me. You got your say. Now I get mine.
Will he be all right?
It was bound to happen sooner or later. You know that Dean would have preferred to die like this. Doing what he loved, saving people. And…
Don’t.
Have our pie and eat it too.
That’s the same thing Jack said, the last time we saw him.
You know, I’ve been thinking.
He isn’t.
I think I am no who I was meant to be.
“What? No!” Under Jack’s steady gaze, he deflates. Especially when Sam, next to him, clears his throat. “Not a word,” he warns his brother. “I’ve been getting better, okay?” And he has. The dog helps a lot. He’s got a reason now to return to the bunker. He’s been drinking less these past weeeks. “I don’t,” he says to Jack. Dying means leaving Sam, causing him even more pain. It means that Cas’ sacrifice would be in vain.
I hope I didn’t make you wait too long.
Dean –
“Hello Dean”, Castiel says.
Dean … He loves you.
You could say that.
Bad timing?
Supernatural
Jody checked that.
Dean –
Damnit, Sammy. Now you’re making me cry.
Don’t do that, Dean.
Yeah, all right. We’re on our way.
You got somewhere else to be, Sam?
He hesitates.
“Listen, Jack. I do appreciate your … interference … although, didn’t you say you were going to be hands-off?”
You’re right. This
(low) It’s got to be around here somewhere.
You keep your voice low. “Come here.”
I was waiting for you.
What if … what if it turns out I can’t, and I hurt him?
Sorry, kid.
Who the fuck are you?
Unless it transformed into George and he’s dead.
I didn’t close it. I got rid of it.
Okay. But … why?
You shouldn’t concern yourself with it right now. It’s all in order. The important thing is that neither demons nor angels will interfere with humanity anymore.
“This,” Jack says, with that frown that you’d expect from a disheveled, silver-haired grandpa, not from a teenager, “cannot keep happening.”
had those kinds of thoughts about me? You sure about that?
Yeah.
Well, the thing about lines is that sometimes they’re drawn for you. And you’re not even aware that there’s an option to re-draw them. If you’re not actively striving to do it, then it’s quite possible that you spend your life driving firmly on one side of the road and it rarely, if ever, comes to your mind that the median isn’t a law of nature, isn’t necessarily how it’s meant to be.
“So you
a death trap.
So I’ll lose you too. And I’ll be left here without both my brothers.
We got work to do.
I just wanted to say thank you. For the help. I really appreciate it.
I sense a presence.
This isn’t working. Why isn’t it working? You’re keeping me
We gotta go.
So you see, given the choice between dying on a hunt, with you by his side, while saving people that he loved …
There’s also Dean. He hasn’t been well.
Are you …
When Jack took the last of my grace, he gave a little bit of it back to me.
All right. I want a hug too.
Man, some more windows would be nice.
to die?”
Shut up. Bitch.
Bad timing. Yeah.
There are some changes I can make and some that I can’t. Some flaws are by design. The flaws create the pattern, and I can’t change it without unraveling it all. I wish I could. But in order to end all suffering, I would have to end the world.
So what, you want to, like – be my platonic valentine?
Yeah, in a minute.
Dean. Is there a reason for him to come back?
It’s okay. Come here.
– maybe it’s worth considering it.
Right. I’ll let you get back to work.
Well, I didn’t.
“Yeah,” you say. “I do. Cas. I
If you actually
They couldn’t call someone else?
All right.
You put  a hand on his neck, brush your thumb over his ear, cup his head. Pull him close, breathe him in. Kiss him, make it soft and just a little wet and endlessly sweet. Feel the way he opens to you and then melts into the kiss.
had those kinds of thoughts about me? You sure about that?” you say, and from the way Cas is looking at you right now, you’re willing to bet that he hasn’t been entirely truthful. From the way Cas is looking at you, he’s been having
Everyone.
Dean?
You too. I do miss you both, you know.
Like when you came back and said you needed time.
all right.”
You know what, I’m pretty beat. I’ll take a shower and get some sleep. See you guys in the morning.
I want to be with you too.
Cas. God, we missed you.
And you?
Not for a long time, I hope.
Or maybe that’s just you.
Both of you.
But right now as you’re looking at Cas, it’s almost funny, and both anticlimactic and disconcerting, to discover that the line you were so acutely aware of when talking to Sam no longer exists.
“Right.” Dean clears his throat. This is something he can’t process yet. Coming so very close to dying. “Yeah. Huh. Thanks.”
You break the kiss, rest your forehead against his. “Fuck,” you whisper, in wonder. “Cas.”
“Fuck,” Dean breathes, staring at Cas, who is standing there like he’s never been gone. When Cas’ gaze meets his, a shock runs through him.
kinds of thoughts about me?
I don’t want to – I don’t want anything from you that you can’t give, Dean.
“His grace was almost gone,” Jack says. “I didn’t restore all of it, just enough so that I could get him to help me with a few … projects.”
Shut up.
Come on, let’s go for a drive. The others are waiting for us.
Something clenches painfully inside of him. “He’s not some
Nothing. All right.
Are you seriously trying to give me the ‘gay is okay’ speech, Sam?
You can sense it, can’t you?
Take my grace. What’s left of it.
Like Hell.
The bad guys aren’t always monsters, Sam.
And then he’s holding out his arms and Castiel walks right into them, and it feels like everything he’s been missing, everything that he never thought he get to have again. Dean inhales deeply, then lets out a single, hitching breath. Holds on.
It’s good to see you.
I’ll leave you alone then. See you around.
Yes. I don’t know what we would have done. I don’t think that Dean would have been able to endure it, the chemotherapy, the limitations once his condition got worse.
They both jump, and Dean hisses and then moans, because holy shit, that was an amount of pain he didn’t need right now. It takes great effort to open his eyes. Blearily – he’s been trying so hard to keep his gaze fixed on Sam – he stares at the glowing figure in front of him. “J-jack?”
‘Bout what.
Come here, then.
that for a second, you’re nearly swept away by that rush of fondness – this impossible man. You could
“So what? You’ve been like – watching from the sidelines? Is that what this is? You’re studying us like we’re your little pets?”
That was Jody. Apparently Charlie and Stevie have gone missing on a hunt; they went after a nest of vampires. They need backup.
Last year, when he went in for knee surgery, they ran a couple of tests. He was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. He got worse over the fall, and we were starting to look into different kinds of treatment.
It’s all right, Dean.
I want to be with you. But I don’t know if I can, not yet. And I … I don’t know what
Of all the patronizing shit you ever said to me…
This time their assumptions would be entirely correct.
He doesn’t know what to say to that so decides to let Dean rant a bit.
He senses him, thinks he can actually smell Cas. That’s all manner of disturbing but it just might be true. He enters the small training room so quietly, yet Dean is aware of his presence immediately. Not that Cas smells, but it’s unmistakable. A tang of warm sunlight on skin, fresh electric air and salt. Unless the mark has fucked up his imagination too. The hairs on the back of his neck stand on end, his skin prickles.
“That’s the stuff.” Dean nods approvingly, eyes crinkling with affection. It’s getting better. Dean may not ever fully trust him again but it is getting better. He found him on the rooftop. Tracked him using the GPS in his phone and brought him home. Castiel smiles back warmly, before taking another sip. It burns all the way down, igniting the existing warmth he feels for his friend. That’s better. Hurts less already.
“What?” He asks stupidly.
That’s nothing to say of the finger marks on his hips or the deep ache of his thigh where Dean had hoisted his leg up. He relishes that good ache, smiles to himself. He wonders how he’d be walking if they’d had the right supplies on them. His heart hammers at the thought as he realises he wouldn’t mind finding out.
Castiel stands a few feet away from him, eyes glistening as they rake over dean’s face.
He must have blanked out a little - oh the joys of modern medicine - because the next time he opens his eyes both brothers are there, looming over him at the foot of his bed, looking awkward as they debate whether to wake him or not. It almost makes him laugh again.
He hated being a burden on the brothers. True, he was using their money, the small cadge they’d leant him not so long ago. He thought he’d do them a favour and knew what they liked. Things were too tense in the bunker these days. Sam kept making ‘third wheel’ jokes though Cas had no idea what that meant. He’d always thought a third wheel was a good thing. Either way, Dean didn’t touch him whilst Sam was around. Too self conscious, Cas supposed.
Dean pauses as he pulls on his jacket. “Oh right,” his face falls as he remembers his little brother’s presence. Castiel represses the feelings of hurt that Dean wants to keep him a secret. There’s no sense in pushing him after all. He’s already pushed enough.
It’s Cas’ turn to whimper when Dean finally manages to slip his hand inside, finds that warm, leaking hardness, squeezes in a way he knows is just right. Castiel gasps against him, clasps his arms. He looks beautiful in pleasure.
Castiel waves the apology away. “What is it you wanted to say?”
Castiel hazily throws his hands out across the bed, spreads himself out like an offering. Dean jerks into him, smooth rhythm falling to pieces. He’s watching Castiel, from his eyes, tracking the flush down his body, looking at where they are joined, where he pumps in and out of him. It’s blurring back into pain again but Castiel doesn’t mind. He lets Dean take what he needs, use him, break him. Dean’s choking out obscenities again, mixed with praise, thankfulness and desperation. He’s moving so fast, hips juddering harshly, everything becoming wetter. It’s obscene and so incredibly hot that Castiel cannot look away. He’s too sensitive, the pleasure/pain divide is so sharp, he bites his lip until he tastes blood. It’s animalistic. Dean looks so strong and dominant, so filled with pleasure, breathing heavy and steadily working to a peak.
Kind of like the one he was wearing now.
Deep down, he knows they’re better than this. They are more than this so he tries to slow it down. Breaks away to pull in air. Traces the solid curves of Dean’s shoulders, squeezing the muscles beneath soft cotton. He wishes he could see those beautiful eyes pooled in shadows, whether they are wide with awe or soft with desire. He can feel their intense focus.
Also, instead of demanding an explanation for Sam’s recovery that night, he chose to allow Dean to vent his frustrations through sexual contact. They parted that night feeling extremely sexually frustrated, both in agreement that the memory of Metatron had spoiled the moment (Castiel kind of wants to stab him in the neck even more now). But the tension is still there, simmering, waiting for another opportunity.
“Now I’m no expert. Generally I just punch the sucker in the face until they stay down. Seems to do the job,” Castiel nods intently, pretending to take in his words as if they were gospel whilst dodging several of Dean’s blows with ease. Dean grins, looking proud. “That’s it exactly!”
For a moment he thinks the woman, this Lia, will protest, land a killing blow anyway. She looks like she wants to. Instead she nods reluctantly, almost solemn in her agreement. “Yes. He needs to suffer first.”
He sighs raggedly instead. “Not at all.”
“What guy?”
“He can come in if he likes.”
love coffee. He’s lost for words at that declaration. At the way Dean smiles so fondly at him, eyes crinkling.
And simply because Castiel wants the sunshine back, he lifts his head and closes the gap between their mouths, tries to kiss the sadness away. Their lips move almost gracefully, sliding against each other. Dean’s mouth opens instinctively. His hand moves to cradle the back of Castiel’s head as they press closer. It’s gentle, yet searing. The room no longer feels so cold anymore.
“Fights never are fair in my experience,” The smile slides off Dean’s face. “Not for us anyway.” He amends.
Dean finds a new plan of attack. He doesn't want gentle and grabs Cas’ wrists, pinning them to the pillow, either side of his head. Castiel can only stare up at him in something close to awe - wide eyed, open-mouthed, and painfully turned on - hot breath against wet lips making him shiver. Dean proceeds to soften the gesture of dominance by kissing along his jaw line, down to his neck where he kisses his pulse-point gently.
. Sucks against Dean’s tongue, breathes against his lips. He thinks he could kiss Dean Winchester forever. Wonders if it would have felt this intense before he was human. They wasted so much time waiting. How can this be anything but right?
That was all he knew at first, soon followed by a large dose of nausea. His head was splitting. His hands were bound. Everything was spinning slightly. Concussion. He was becoming familiar with the sensation, sadly. His head lulled painfully, too much effort to remain looking up, but he eventually managed.
“How couldn’t I Sammy? They early killed him!” He exploded. Dean took a few deep breaths, continued, “As far as I see it, he’ll always have a this huge target on his back, long as he’s human and vulnerable. And his douchebag ‘family’ are still walking around down here.” He grimaced.
Right now, he can hear sounds that he’s only heard in porn. And it’s coming from him. One hand anchors itself to Cas’ thick hair, the other he uses to muffle his moans.
Dean slips out of him and Castiel winces a little, feeling the loss already. Dean notices.
He wonders if Dean is referring to his own unhealthy drinking habits or something else. Castiel fleetingly remembers Dean describing a 2014 version of himself thanks to a little trip courtesy of Zachariah. A broken, decadent, human version of himself. Cas had scoffed - it was a false vision or one possible future that had already been derailed. Now he begins to wonder if he’s becoming a little more like that nightmare version everyday. If Dean sees him that way. He shudders and decides that it may be better not to ask.
But he won’t. His patience is too thin to be gentle. He’s no longer in control of his actions. Their first time, Dean within him, needs to happen when the mark is gone.
The scrape of the chair as Dean positions himself opposite makes him start a little. That was something he never did before. He now sympathises with Dean all those times he chose to materialise behind him unannounced. He understands why Dean always jumped and cursed at him.
“He’s old-fashioned…”
ironic? There’s no way Sam didn’t hear that if he’s home yet Dean can’t seem to care. He lies back on the floor, revelling in the few seconds where the desperate all-consuming need has faded. He stretches, sighs, sated. He stays spread out, a mess on the floor, shivering with the aftershocks, feeling hazy. When he finally summons up the courage to peek at Cas, he sees the angel is still straddling him, eyes wide, innocent (how? How can he still think that?) with a hint of satisfaction, as if he had just had
“You know,” He clears his throat awkwardly, not meeting Castiel’s eyes. This causes him to immediately fear a rejection. Unnecessarily though, as it turns out. “This afternoon… that was only the tip of the iceberg Cas.”
“No Dean.” He orders voice low and commanding. “I won’t let you keep hurting yourself in this way. The mark is driving you crazy.”
“Please say you’re not considering contacting him?” Sam asked, on the verge of exasperation. He ran his hands through his crazy hair, standing up so he could walk up to Dean, shake him if necessary.
“You are most wise,” he murmurs as Dean moves in closer, laughing a little at Cas‘ words. He gingerly removes the cloth from the wound.
“Sammy where’s that first aid kit?”
“Shower. Now! Before we have to call you the Stink Guy.”
At first he thought he was in some kind of dank cave. But no. He appeared to be in the world’s grimiest disused factory, cold and grey, though his vision was still clouded. He could hear water dripping nearby and was so very cold. The man stood in front of him and Castiel could only assume this was his attacker. He wore a leather coat, was broad shouldered, had long black shaggy hair, and an expression of complete loathing aimed Castiel’s way. Never good.
Castiel stiffened, heart rate picking up in an odd combination of pleasant/unpleasant. A weight on top. Trapped. Looking down at him, his scars, his aches and pains. But it was Dean. His Dean. He
“You have no idea what you are to me.” Castiel insists, voice rough.
He waits for Dean to look up before continuing. “My short time with Daphne has become a blur to me. We were…domestic. Intimate. But it wasn’t real. I didn’t feel it. It was as if something were missing. Some part of me. I wasn’t capable of love or sensation back then. Not really. Not like now.”
He once left a mark of his own on Dean’s skin. His own brand. He wants to see if it’s still there – to trace it with hands and lips. To make new ones the only way he can now. He realises that he could have remade Dean without the handprint marring his flesh. But he didn’t. He never cared to closely examine why that had been at the time. It had been a reminder of who Dean should be grateful to for rescuing from the pit. A warning to others that he was marked, protected. A burn from a desperate moment, when he had saved Dean Winchester and in that moment, he had been his, Castiel’s entirely.
The idea of pushing into Dean, that tight, slick heat. Being surrounded by him in every sense of the word… It made his whole body tremble, break out in a filthy sweat. He never realised how badly he wanted it before now.
“A cupid’s bow, the heart of a Nephilim…my grace.” That received very pointed looks. “I didn’t know what the spell would do,” he concludes, voice quiet but steely underneath. “I swear. He tricked me.”
Warning UST that may make your head explode.
Castiel privately thinks it was always going to end like this between them. Sex or death.
“You just have to be more careful Cas.” Dean’s voice cracks a little. It tugs powerfully at his memory. Castiel recalls a broken man, lying in a hospital bed, insisting destiny had chosen the wrong person. He wanted to protect that man. He wants to protect him now but all he ever brings him is more pain.
Once Castiel had adjusted to the sneak attack, managed to pull in a lungful of air and the taste of Dean, it was comfortable, natural, familiar with an edge of determination. As if kissing could hold this moment together forever, as if they wouldn’t have to deal with any looming troubles.
Reviews/kudos are appreciated.
“Can we not tell Sam?” Dean pauses, looking away for a moment, almost guilty. “Not just yet anyway. He’s got a lot to deal with and…”
Their hips are moving of their own accord now, fluidly and hard. Castiel has his hands on Dean’s waist, slipping in sweat, hard enough to bruise. They’re making noises like animals, trying to stifle them though hard kisses and bites. They breathe against each other’s mouth, explosions of air, sweating under too many layers. It shudders over the line of discomfort and Dean seeks to rectify this. He slips out of Castiel’s grasp, bobbing back to kiss away the noise of protest he makes. Cas’ arms feel empty during the time it takes Dean to slip his pants off but the sight is worth it in the end.
“I’m not angry.”
“Oh. I’ll…just come back in a minute.” She stutters before swooping away again.
The kitchen was bare. That was unacceptable. The brothers had never really had a home or a kitchen to stock before. They’d often run out of the necessities. But Castiel no longer wanted them to go without. He wanted to help and chip in, especially since he was partly responsible for the rapid depletion of food every week. And so with an uncomfortably empty fridge, clutching a wide ranging list, he went out to do the grocery shopping. How hard could it be? The brothers supposedly did it every week. When there wasn’t an apocalypse.
“Because you're being annoying!” Sam throws his hands up in exasperation. “I just need to process this for a minute okay?”
“What do
“Your face was a picture.” Cas whispered to break the tension, smile playing at the corners of his mouth.
“It’s just… You need stuff for that.”
“You know what? Forget it. This is stupid.” He spits out, pocketing his blade as he heads for the door.
“Thank you,” Cas responds with a smile, sensing nothing amiss. Dean merely gives her his best and biggest grin, with no hint of embarrassment at all. At least until Cas adds:
“You think I’m going to hurt Cas?” He laughs bitterly. “That’s a joke.”
Dean sighs, “I’m not trying to hurt you. C‘mon Cas, dance around a bit. You‘re a sitting target.”
“Come on, I’m not exactly saying that. You should know that he’s pretty new to this human thing. He reacts differently to stuff…”
“And I love you,” He murmured into his hands, sighing softly.
The question seems to catch Dean up short. He opens and closes his mouth in a way that reminds Castiel of baby birds waiting to be fed by their mother. He may not have a grip on emotions yet, but he doubts that Dean is expressing similar sentiments as an infant bird. No. This is confusion. This is irritation. He files the labels away neatly. He experiences them every day now too.
“Yes, yes of course.” Castiel growls out, sliding his hands under layers so he can trail them over the smooth warmth of his back.
“Metatron.” He manages to infuse as much loathing into those three syllables as possible.
Cas flinched, rolled onto his back. Sighed. He placed his hands over his face.
He feels a rush of excitement, of nervous anticipation, a hot surge of lust and longing that takes him by surprise. He swallows hard, breathing growing more wrecked. He needs to keep talking. To keep moving. He presses indents into Dean’s hips. This can’t end like last time, as wonderful as that was.
“Dean…how do you know he’d even survive the process? Anna’s body blew up.” Sam said, delicately voicing one of his concerns.
“Dean…” His voice is rough, shaky and reproachful.
Dean’s putting clothing on. This is a bad thing. He says as much and Dean has a good laugh at that.
Lips smoothly bumping, firmly pressing. Dean deliberately takes Cas’ bottom lip between his own, sucking softly, running his tongue over the seam. They fit together so perfectly. It’s hard not to think they were made to be like this. It’s taken him millions of years, but he’s finally found this. Found
He hears Dean swear under his breath again before he tears his gaze away to pull out his wallet and throw a few bills on the table.
“The truth perhaps?” Castiel suggests gently.
Castiel swallows hard.
Dean’s fingers, inside, stretching, scissoring. Getting a little less careful as his own arousal tears at his patience.
That made Sam sit bolt upright, the deception not lost on him. “Okay Cas. Where is he?”
Dean’s mouth suddenly goes dry, his legs watery. He flashes back to images of Anna. “I don’t understand…”
Sam cares deeply about Cas. But he doesn’t want Dean to get hurt. Not again.
They’re closer now. Castiel can feel his warmth. Can see the thick hairs on his head move in the steady wind stream. Can pick up the green and golden flecks in his eyes. But he can no longer see what’s
But it wasn’t a magic fix all.
It may have taken him nearly two hours in a relatively small store to locate everything on his list. And he did have to battle a busted shopping trolley, and a distracted mother who had rammed into him, but he was triumphant. He almost wildly overpaid a bemused store clerk in the process, but had made sure to pick up an apple pie, one of the unhealthiest brands crammed with sugar, the type Dean loved. He had hesitantly selected a nice range of fruit and vegetables to make up for it and placate Sam. He also added human essentials, plus pasta, pizza, beer, coffee, rice and a good selection of sauces. He was getting better at cooking all the time now. Though at first, the brothers had found his tastes a little bizarre but he was learning all the time what went well together (not mashed parsnip and tuna soup-broth apparently. Even Dean couldn’t fake enjoyment to appease him with that one).
“Oh great. So you’re saying we should just burn it all down?”  Dean asked, voice heavy with sarcasm. “That’ll go down well. Not at all suspicious.”
“Yes. It is.” He agrees quietly, broken smile spreading across his face like a dash of winter sunlight.
Castiel rolls his eyes, wants to tell them not to overreact.
Instead, he repeats his order: “Move.”
“Why don’t I be on top?” Dean’s voice whispered into his ear, low and tempting.
Sam is like a brother to him. He doesn’t want to upset the youngest Winchester. He needs to know they are okay. But right now, it’s so hard to care. If Sam has any qualms with this, Castiel would quite gladly tell him to go to hell. And he knows that’s ridiculous - and insensitive considering the circumstances - but there is something about Dean that makes him selfish. He wants to be greedy. He wants
When the heat of Dean’s mouth draws back, his eyes open so he can glare a protest.
As it turns out, he doesn’t need to get up. The remaining brother comes to him.
“How do we reverse the spell?”
This causes their grey-haired waitress’ mouth to fall open as she dumps their orders on the table.
“You’re gonna be okay, Cas.” He swore, eyes blazing down at him. Dean was shaking in his intensity. “I swear, I’m going to make everything better.”
“How are you?” Dean winces. He could kick himself.
He’s pulling Cas to the floor before he’s even given his body permission to do so, crawling into his lap, grinding already, achingly hard. The angel looks startled, transfixed by every sensation gasping against his lips. It’s too fast but it’s what he needs right now. It’s not how he’d wistfully imagined their first time would be. A part of him wanted romance, nothing he would ever admit out loud. But admittedly this feels perfect. Cas’ hands, the friction, the matching hardness where Cas needs him too - and that’s so incredible he wants to touch. He settles for bucking against Cas, writhing so close it shivers over the line of comfort into burning desperation.
so fucking hot.” He emphasised carefully. Cas tried not to smile, almost succeeded.
------------------
Cas had felt sorry for him. Had even sympathised with his lonely existence. But he had no right, no right at all, to take those people with him. Especially one of the few people Castiel loves in this world. The person he loves most of all in this world, he’d realised. And with that, the answer came automatically in his mind. Obvious and certain.
”Looks like we’re finally getting that slumber party, Cas.” He hears Sam say.
“- Me and Cas. I don’t think I’m ever gonna get used to that you know.” Dean sighs, smiling in spite of himself.
----------------------------
He sees Dean taking in all of him and takes a moment to appreciate the sight before him, the long angular planes of Dean Winchester laid atop of him. He runs his slightly wet hands down the sweat-slicked expanse of his back, pressing into muscles, making him almost purr. He finds the softness of his ass and squeezes fingers gently.
“That’s it, think positive.” Castiel had responded, not really listening. Tucking a feverish Sam back into bed like a demented nurse maid, in a subtle attempt to restrain him. Sam had already made several failed attempts to escape the bunker in search of Dean. Castiel was not going to break his promise.
“No. It’s fine. Sam’s fine…” Dean sighs, hating every moment of this. Having to bargain and reason with this creature, knowing he dumped a load of murderous angels on to his planet. That he tricked and manipulated Cas, before slicing his throat open, stealing his grace, his identity.
He pulls back, feeling gratified at Dean’s noise of protest. “What? Is this okay?”
- he doesn’t let himself add.
“Dean!” It only makes him smile more, the way Cas is gasping, squirming, almost as impatient as he has been. Almost as frustrated. But he’s enjoying exploring Cas’ body, very much so. The salt taste of him, the rhythm their bodies make, rubbing hips together ceaselessly. He moves to the other nipple, scrapes his teeth along it, makes Cas writhe, buck up, pant. The friction against his aching cock is too much. He presses his cheek against Cas’ slightly damp chest, moans.
“What’s wrong?” He mumbles, once he’s managed to extract himself from Dean’s embrace a little, resting forehead to forehead.
“What was what?” Cas replies, mercilessly.
“I suppose there’s one way to find out if it will work…” Lia concurs. She is so beautiful. Cas violently hates her, hates them both. He has to hope that they are the exception, that the other angels aren’t like these two deep down. They are sadists. They enjoy his pain. “He’s clearly no use to us alive anyway.”
Dean, you’ve got to slow down.
I want to go back.
Well – you know, it’s
Seems we just can’t catch a break.
Let’s not do this now, all right?
You said he summoned the Empty. How did he do that?
Fuck, I don’t know. I hardly understand it myself. It’s …
Morning, Cas.
,” he says, unamused. “I leave you two alone for two minutes and you use it to get yourself killed. Seriously?”
I rearranged some matters. Got rid of some things that aren’t needed anymore.
You okay?
Except –
That was … wow. Thank you so much. That could have ended badly.
want. You never told me.
He gave me a choice.
I can’t get over it. Of all the stupid ways to die … we got through so many hunts far more dangerous than this.
“I don’t think it’s a matter of choice, Dean,” he says, so fucking serious, and for a moment, you want to laugh because it’s all too similar to what you said to Sam on the road only hours ago when he kept babbling about
Hey. Wait.
I know.
Unless there is something else you’d rather do.
I’m not telling you to. I miss him too.
SAM No! I mean – maybe?
Somewhere that isn’t here or somewhere that is at Eileen’s?
Dean.
So instead, you close your eyes and let yourself imagine it, for the first time – or maybe not, come think of it: for a second, you recall the faint memory of watching him talk, against the backdrop of a blue summer sky, of wondering, faintly, what his lips would feel like under yours,  a thought fleeting and unacknowledged yet crystal clear in in your memory. But it’s only now that you permit yourself to think of it, of walking over to kiss him and feel his heartbeat under your hand. And when it really hits you, a wave of
The first demons were created by Lucifer. And they tricked and tempted humans into selling their souls. I find that … unethical.
That sounds so much like something Cas would say that Dean’s throat is suddenly  tight. “Oh.”
His mind soon began to wander and found himself reminiscing over certain special memories which included Dean Winchester who was not only a man who saved the world with his brother but his best friend. Cas played through the memories, one by one enjoying everyone and everything in them. He remembered the first time they met and feeling the demon knife being blunged into his chest by the human and the complete look of shock on Deans face. The time Dean and him had sat together in a diner just enjoying their meals while they stared at each other with some much adoration that you could practically hear their hearts beating in sync. Then the time where Castiel popped into the hotel the Winchester brothers were staying in which he did quite regularly only to be faced with a green eyed man. His face turned so red in a matter of moments it had reminded the angel of the paint the hunters used to draw sigils and devil traps with, the angel was quite confused at first from this reaction but then as he studied the man and he noticed he was bare naked expect for the white fluffy towel that was wrapped around the humans waist, dripping wet from just getting out of the showe-
“It’ll be okay Buddy, just let it all out”
“I- I’m s-sorry D-dean I jus-st  I- I’m s-sorry”
“I'm fine.”
He felt his face heat up and looked down in embarrassment when he realised he was alone with his thoughts and that he was biting his bottom lip. He decided to keep that memory for later.  ;)
Suddenly what can be heard in the background is the sound of a door opening but neither of the men hadn’t even registered the noise or the sound of Sam cursing or the sound of the door shutting softly well that’s what they wanted to all think. As soon as the room was filled with crushing silence it was again broken but not by a door or a curse but a shaky breath and then a sob. A gut- wrenching provoking sob which coursed through Cas’s body like a virus infecting every cell, every strand of DNA. Just everything. Had been completely covered.
“Because if I see what Heaven's become – what I – “ Castiel sighs. They make eye contact. “What I made of it... I'm afraid I might kill myself.”
“Yeah, poke around, see if the God squad can't tell us how you got out.”
As Castiel sat on the bed, covering his face with his hands letting the tears fall dampening his trousers. He felt a abrupt pressure land on his left arm; it was comforting. So being confused and intrigued, the man removed his hands from his face and looked over to his left with his eyes red and stinging.
“No.”
Dean Winchester
Dean stares in disbelief at the scene that was occurring right in front of his eyes.
“I’m in love” Castiel whispers to himself but suddenly Sam overhears him and asks “what was that Cas?” While raising an eyebrow, looking at the other man expectly.
“Look, man, I – I hate those flying-ass monkeys just as much as you do, but –“ The young man starts but then is interrupted.
“Castiel” The human whispers, the other man immediately looks up at him. “That is not true. I-I-I  w-would never f-forgive myself if that h-happened. You matter and p-people love you. I l-love you... and Sam d-does too. So don’t ever think I w-wouldn’t do anything for y-you to be s-safe and h-happy.” The angel is stunned with shock as he watches the hunter leak small tears down his face, he doesn’t even pick up on the sudden slip up the man had made but instead quickly jumps forward and embraces Dean so tightly that he would’ve killed any other human or creature. They stay intertwined with each other sobbing until they both drift off. Sam doesn’t come home until later where he finds Dean laid down on his bed with Castiel on his chest, asleep . He sweetly smiles as he quietly writes a note saying that he would be at the library if they needed him and leaves it on the table while walking out the door, making sure to softly shut it the second time that day. The rest of the day was just filled with gleeful glances but it was mostly full of looks which said one unspoken secret between a certain pair of a hunter and angel.
He had kept reading the same line of text for the last hour as his thoughts were all over the place, in places of his mind that he didn’t even know were there and places that he was way too familiar with. But all of these thoughts had a replaying something in them, a rather person. Castiel shook his head as if he was trying to get rid of the thoughts but soon realised that was impossible. He sighed in disappointment.
He didn’t care about anything else, not the footsteps of the younger Winchester brother or the questions being asked by his son.
Cas rests his head against Dean’s shoulder sobbing, moistening his flannel while the other man whispered sweet nothings into his ear.
“I-I’ve just caused so m-much p-p-pain and I-I-I just don’t know what to d-do. I feel so awful and just think i-it w-w- would be better if I was g-g-g- gone...” Castiel admits. As the words leave his mouth, he feels the rate of Dean’s heart start to race and his breathing become heavier. He feels the arms around him loosen until they drop and he is suddenly pushed gently back to be faced with the hunter’s green eyes. Cas feels a sudden warmth engulfing his hands. He slowly looks down, Dean had cradled them with his own.
When he finally catches his breath again, he runs the words through his head again and again and again. The more he repeats it, the more he realises it’s true.
“Well, I just – I – I know that when... I got puked out of Purgatory, it took me a few weeks to... find my sea legs.
Then that one night...
The room is filled with silence and after a few moments Dean closes the laptop, walks over and sits on the edge of the other bed, facing the angel.
Tears
Cas pauses for moment.
There sat next to him the one and only Dean Winchester with his right hand resting on the angel, his eyes filled with nothing but concern and empathy. Neither of them speak, they just stare at each other taking in the tender moment that was in play. That’s when Castiel felt a familiar prickling in his eyes, he quickly looks down and he frowns deeply but suddenly he feels a pressure under his chin and it’s being lifted up to meet Dean’s gaze which then showed the angel something he had not seen in a long time.
————————————————————————————————————
Their eyes meet. “Talk to me.”
Dean had been sitting at the motels room table of which they were staying at and using Sam’s laptop while Castiel was sitting on one of the beds, looking at John Winchester’s journal. They were sitting in comfortable silence when suddenly the angel had broken it.
He had been reading through the laws on leviathans which still caused him to feel sick not only physically but mentally after his time being purgatory, with Sam sitting on the other table across the room doing his own research and Jack playing around.
There’s nothing you want more, in this moment, than to keep going. To let it all escalate,  light the fuse and let it blow up.
Oh. Hey.
You said you couldn’t talk about it. And I tried to respect that. But he was my friend too.
You’re not staying overnight.
So, it’s you drawing the lines. And if you say, this is as far as I can go, then Cas isn’t going to argue with that. It’s your choice, all right?
Not that it matters. It’s just, like, a metaphor. The line was there until it wasn’t, and the road ahead ... it looks better by the minute.
It’s not a
And, you know, you can start working things out with –
I know what you mean. I am not going to make a habit out of this.
‘Course she did. Anyway, that thing sure
Sam, in front of him, makes a noise that sounds like a gutted pig and sinks to the floor like someone cut his strings. Burying his face in his hands. Shaking.
I don’t understand.
I am sorry.
A Screenplay by dornfelder
I guess it doesn’t matter.
that you can
One of the reasons that I find it easier to accept than you was that I knew we were going to lose him. Not quite so soon – not so unexpected – but a lot sooner than either of us would have liked.
She’s it for you.
You pull back so you can look him in the eyes, stare in wonder at the way his eyes have grown dark, the way he looks at you with that burning intensity that has probably always held a hint of desire but is only now turning carnal.
They did it, Cas. They found a way. And I … I took on the burden. Such as it is.
You do.
“What projects?” Dean can’t take his eyes off them. Off Cas. He swallows. He body still has to feel the aftereffects of almost dying, that’s the only way to explain the sudden tightness in his chest that makes it hard to breathe.
Dean.
You forget who I am, Sam. I was always acutely aware of how fleeting life can be.
Is this about Cas?
I chose this.
It’s his choice. And as it happens, he’s already made it.
Do we get to see you again?
You see people drive on the other lane. You see people cross the median, and you don’t spend more than a fleeting moment wondering what that would be like. It’s just not something you do, especially when it's John Winchester who first explained the concept of driving to you.
So when you said, ‘the one thing I want is something I know I can’t have’, I just imagined that, huh?
Dean gently pats his back. “Sam. Hey, Sammy, it’s all right.” Sam just keeps shaking, and Dean crouches beside him and puts an arm around his shoulders.
Something is different. What …?
He flinches a little. “What?”
Hey, can I buy you a drink?
SAM follows suit. He turns on the lights.
I should probably report that.
I really think I need to live somewhere else for a change.
What do
No. You’re mine. We made a deal. I’m not giving you up. Where’s the fun in that? Just you wait. Some day, all these memories will pale. They will fade.
I wasn’t going to say anything.
It’ll be all right.
Forget I said anything.
Fuck. That was …
Don’t do this.
Right. So –
It’s just – you know that dad had a couple of outdated views on some things. I know you probably internalized a lot of that, and that it’s going to take a while to …
He’s home.
The thing is – now that we’re free – I think that there’s a way for us to have it all.
But it won’t work if I matter less. I have to matter just as much.
I understand.
“So, now what?” Dean says. “We’re not supposed to hunt anymore? Because that ain’t happening.” They haven’t freed the world of Chuck just for Jack to put them in chains.
Wherever that thing is, it’s not here.
Dean –
What about you then? How will you be able to move on?
Then you know what to do. Figure it out as you go along.
It’s his choice.
That’s part of it. If you’ll let me explain.
He wanted you to move on with your life. Knowing there was a good chance that he was going to die soon, he was asking me to make sure you would be fine.
There is no obligation. Your love saved me, Cas. And it saved this universe. The very least I can give you in return is the ability to choose. What is it that
Dean.
I believe in second chances. So I gave them one. To return to earth, as humans, and try again. Or to move on.
