. I'm also going to post the link in the end notes of this fic. If you have questions concerning any of my sources, feel free to ask.
“Always.”
“How?”
“Wise decision. The more you cooperate, the sooner we’ll be out of here. Let’s hope the wait for the scan won’t be too long. Another ambulance arrived shortly before you. Seemed to be serious. While we wait, if you feel up to it – and can actually recall what happened to you since yesterday evening – I’d like an account.”
He watches as Watson stands up slowly and stretches carefully. His shoulder seems to be troubling him. He fetches his jacket and cap and briefcase, and almost as an afterthought his stick. Despite wearing a watch himself, he asks, “What time is it?” as they exit the building.
Shaking his head, he busies himself with his clothes again.
John pats her hand reassuringly. “Your reaction is understandable, Mrs. Matthews, and as Sergeant Lang and my colleague Mr. Holmes here have already indicated, I doubt anything bad will come of it for you. On the contrary, the assailant was a wanted criminal on the run, so in fact you’ve done Scotland Yard a service by stopping him.”
personal, are still out of bounds, and probably will remain so. They’re just not like that, John and he, talking about
She shrugs, gathering together her things. “Just ... he couldn’t have been more obvious, could he,” she says quietly. “Remember what I said, John. I suspect he’s a complete idiot when it comes to romance, worse than you, in fact. But did you notice his reaction? He was totally distracted by half your arse hanging out of your pants, but was too shy and awkward to even enquire how you were doing.”
__________
“What does?”
“To protect me, I suppose.”
“Do spare me the lurid details, Dr. Watson.” He lets out a breath. “Do you believe there is reason for concern? You know how Sherlock gets when he is truly fascinated by a case.”
“Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson, welcome,” she greets them, looking anxious, stressed and relieved at the same time. “I’m so glad you could make it. Please, come in. Daniel is doing another round of informing the neighbours about what happened and asking around if anybody has seen her. He should be back soon. Can I offer you anything?”
“I must speak to Miss Hooper now,” Sherlock interrupts her sharply. He hears his landlady mutter another complaint, before she is replaced by Molly. Sherlock hears her thank Mrs. Turner and shoo her away much more gently and considerately than he would have done.
“Wow, that bloke really is vain, isn’t he?” remarks John. “He has about twice the amount of hair products than even you.”
“What?” John looks confused.
John shook his head, which hurt. “If it helps convict the trio, I will, but otherwise I don’t see the point. Two of them were injured as well, and since I chased the leader and took a fall in the process, the question of guilt is rather moot. There were no witnesses to the attack, either, so …” He was tempted to shrug, but thought the better of it.
Through experimentation, Sherlock has found an angle, speed and tightness of grip that feels just right. John doesn’t last long after that, his orgasm rushing through him with an intensity he hadn’t thought possible during a race like the Tour de France and the toll it usually take on his body and libido. He sags against Sherlock, panting, reaching out with a shaking hand to turn off the shower and brush wet hair out of his eyes. When he feels he can stand on his own legs again, he turns in Sherlock’s arms and looks up at him. Sherlock’s cheeks and chest are flushed, his hair brushed to one side with some strands framing his face and his ridiculous cheekbones, giving him sideburns and a funny 1970s look. His expression is one of fascination, smugness, a trace of worry, and, because John can’t think of a better description, love.
“Indeed. I’m quite proficient at lip reading. Wiggins is complaining about team tactics, not just to Moriarty but to their
He leafs through the folder that contained the intercept, then whistles softly. “Oh,” he breathes, as his heartbeat accelerates at the rush of adrenaline coursing through him. John halts and turns back to him.
Even over dinner, John doesn’t speak much, sitting opposite Sherlock and picking at his food in a way that belies his previous claims of being famished. Sherlock ends up eating almost twice as much as John, which is a strange reversal of their usual habits and slightly worrying. A few times, Sherlock utters encouragements, trying to entice John to eat, but to little avail.
“I see. You needed the aloe gel for your hair, then?”
John nods, cleaning his plate with his last piece of haddock. “Will you tell me about them?”
“Are you always this inquisitive?”
Sherlock had hoped that things would improve once John had settled back into the routine of Baker Street, but if the past months are anything to go by, this is unlikely to happen ever again. John has changed, and so has Sherlock. There is no way back to how they were, and he isn’t clear of the way forward. He does know, however, that he doesn’t want to lose John again. Not to another person, nor an ill-fated knife or bullet at a case.
“Oh?”
John nods. “You’re aware of the rumours, I take it?”
“Inevitable?”
John smiles. “Hi, Marla. Uh … apologies for the string traps earlier, by the way. Hope you didn’t hurt yourself too badly on those shards.”
“We’ll live,” replies John. “As long as we can keep Mr. Holmes here from dashing off again or picking another fight.”
“I heard that, Molly,” said Sherlock mock sternly.
Even though he thought he had braced himself for this very question, when it is asked, Sherlock feels at a loss for words. He swallows, blinks a few times, looks everywhere but at John. Eventually, he clears his throat. “Love is a chemical defect,” he says, his voice rough.
“I’ll think about it.”
“Daniel,” Sherlock acknowledges him with a brief nod. “Did you learn anything about Tiffany’s last whereabouts after she set out from her friend’s? That was the purpose of your going round the village, wasn’t it?”
“The Woman, eh?” asks Billy with a shrewd expression. “She’s singin’ at The Windmill tonight, ain’t she?”
Sherlock glances at his watch. 8:35 pm. They’ve spent over four hours on the message. His official tea-break would have been at eight, halfway through his shift. “Let’s go and see if we can get some in Hut 2, or if not there then in the canteen. The tea urn here is empty. I’ve just seen someone trying to get the last drops out.”
At this, John lifts the rucksack from his shoulder and eyes it suspiciously. Tiffany notices and blushes. “You never know when you’re going to need it, do you?” she says a little defensively.
Sherlock gazes towards John. He, too, has straightened up again, looking tense. He half turns to Sherlock, his expression alarmed. “What the—” Then he understands.
While John gets them something to drink, Sherlock become aware of Lestrade making his way over to the bar. “She’s pretty stunning, isn’t she?” he states, nodding towards the stage.
“That’d be splendid,” says John.
The corners of Sherlock’s mouth twitch in a smile. “Yes. And with you. He told me in no uncertain terms that I was an idiot and that I should grab what lay in front of me and stop dithering. He spoke quite highly of you, if you want to know. The way you helped him when he was unwell made a huge impression on him, particularly because he thought you thought I was trying to get back together with him. And he was right, wasn’t he?”
“Ja, die sind auch gut,” said the girl, smiling up at Sherlock. “Welche magst du? Und wie heißt du? Und wie findest du den Yoda?”
“And your ego wouldn’t allow it?”
John watched the almost naked, extremely tanned cyclist, a man in his late sixties wearing nothing but state of the art cycling shoes, sunglasses and a pair of black swimming trunks round the bend and rise from the saddle to cover the steep ascent. “He’s bloody fit.”
They fall silent until John alerts Sherlock to take a left turn in the village of Clyro. Shortly afterwards, they cross the river Wye in its deep bed bordered by dark, wind-swept trees, and drive into a festively lit and decorated Hay-on-Wye. Sherlock is mildly surprised by how small the town is. His parents’ accounts of the world-famous annual literary festival taking place here made him imagine it to be larger. But it looks to be no more than a few score houses occupying a hill overlooking the river, with the ruins of a medieval castle in their midst. Most buildings they pass appear to be either bookshops, vegan restaurants or shops catering to an alternative or mildly gentrified crowd.
“Miss Connolly, my name is Sherlock Holmes, and this is Dr. Watson. We are friends of Molly Hooper’s, whom you had agreed to meet last night before Mr. Brook – if that’s indeed the name you knew him under – persuaded you to accompany him. If you are feeling well enough, I’d like to ask you a few questions. However, if you prefer, Dr. Watson who is a qualified surgeon of the Royal Navy would be happy to examine you first and look after your arm.”
John glares at both of them. Most of the others are grinning, or nodding knowingly. What are they implying? He
“Lovers’ quarrel, likely,” opines Constable Grant somewhat dismissively. “Had a bit of a tiff with her beau in the car, maybe he broke it up. Girl is stressed and unstable anyway so she escapes to a lonely place and ends it. Seriously, Mr. Lestrade, I don’t think we need to worry too much about this case.”
“Perhaps I’d like to keep my room for myself, for when I need some space.”
to be here, I guess, as it would be a tremendously boring and ... well ... lonely existence.”
something
Now it was John’s turn to blush. It always felt strange to receive compliments on his features or physique from someone as handsome if unusual looking as Sherlock. It felt bloody good, though.
“She was still quite shy and very lively,” replied Susan thoughtfully. “I doubt a complete stranger would have had easy game catching her to put a halter on her, even in the confines of this stall that would have limited her movement. Even we had to come in twos sometimes to get her. Although she’s still only a few months old, she’s quite tall and strong. Headstrong, too.”
“I ran back to my bike and came here as quickly as I could. I didn’t want to turn her over or search round the place, because I feared that I’d destroy evidence. I remember you once complained about the police walking all over a crime scene you were called to in London, thereby destroying all the tracks.”
“Sir, would you please let us help you? Your wife called us because she is worried about you.” One of the paramedics, obviously, trying to remain patient. “Please return inside and calm down.”
The small yet bustling town of Valloire bore a striking difference to sleepy and industrial Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne with its beige-grey houses and narrow, cramped streets. The architecture of Valloire was in most part modern yet inspired by traditional alpine building: flat, overhanging roofs and wooden panelling along the weather-fronts of the houses, with large balconies at the south-facing facades, geraniums and petunias in full flower spilling over them like floral waterfalls. The town was a busy place in summer and winter, with several ski-lifts moving up the mostly treeless mountainsides. Now in summer they were carrying hikers and mountain-bikers to the hilltops instead of skiers.
“Right. Good. I’m off to the bathroom, then.”
“Oh, you’ve got plans, then?” asks Sherlock, feeling increasingly confident with this light teasing and gentle bickering. It’s what they do, what they’ve always done. It’s familiar and comfortable, yet with an exciting new component now that touching and kissing have been added. To his surprise and great relief, Sherlock finds himself thoroughly enjoying this unprecedented intimacy. He had been worried that he wouldn’t. But the kissing despite its intensity and unpredictability has been wonderful so far, so much so that Sherlock is actually looking forward to furthering the activity and hopefully exploring some more of John.
“Yeah, thought so, too,” says the man. “You’re not famous, are you?”
She laughs softly, nods. “Thank you. I should counsel you the same, though. You’re a bit too clever for your own good, it seems. You were watching me up there, weren’t you? You could have interfered much sooner, but you and your partner were waiting. Why? To see how the game ended, of course. Had you been in my position, Mr. Holmes, you would have played as well.”
“Yeah. But that’s all right. He’s not one for drinks, anyway.”
Lestrade looked up from his notes. “What?”
“That’s not an unusual colour. Half the women at the Park wear lipstick of that shade.”
Lestrade shook his head and grinned. “That was a good one, for sure. Whenever I need a good laugh – and a reminder that he’s human like the rest of us (more or less) –, I look at the photo of him emerging from the cellar with his coat full of kittens.”
She cocks her head and looks at him strangely. “I can see that you, too, like to help people. And you’d be good at it.”
John said. In a way, Sherlock feels he hasn’t grown up at all yet. He is thirty-four, but compared to John he feels like a mere child in terms of experience. Is it just this lack and his naivety that make him want to forgo all caution and grab John’s hand right now and kiss it? And is John holding back because of some past discrimination or injustice he was subjected to because of his inclination?
“You can’t just admit it, can you?”
“Thanks for the warning, mate.”
John laughs. “Yeah, that one. So you have watched the films?”
Other traces are equally unclear. He finds some scuff marks on the living room carpet that could have been made by high-heeled shoes or some kind of walking stick –
Sherlock heaves a dramatic sigh, glaring at John.
“I will need a full statement, Lady Moran, and a more detailed account of what you’ve just told us now. I take it you wish to see your son now?”
They arrive at the Park with time to spare, which comes in handy because the soldiers at the gate check their papers more thoroughly than usual, perhaps because of their arrival in a strange car, or because of increased security measures due to the visit of the Prime Minister. The drive in front of the mansion is almost completely blocked with all kinds of vehicles. Sherlock recognises the military transport they overtook the day before. Several large, expensive cars, too, and a host of motor-cycles are parked there as well. There is an increased presence of military police and people in dark suits which scream “ministerial aides”. Sherlock spots representatives of Army, Air Force and Navy, conspicuous in their uniforms weighed down with medals – although none wear their official garb as handsomely as the Naval officer next to Sherlock. Ever since he clapped eyes on John descending the stairs to join him and their landladies for breakfast, Sherlock has been suspended in a state of faint but incessant arousal. Things such as John in Naval uniform simply shouldn’t be allowed, he decides. There should be a law against it. John, being the bad man that he is, of course picked up on Sherlock’s state and teased him endlessly during the short drive to the Park. Sherlock has vowed to pay him back tonight.
He shuts his mouth abruptly when a noise sounds from downstairs. John has tensed in alarm. The small insect lifts off his finger.
John licks his lips. “Need some space?” he ventures.
Casting a glance at the people behind him, his attention is caught by the flame of a cigarette lighter. Some newcomers have arrived and are standing in or near the doorway. One, a tall man in a light-grey, double-breasted suit and a dark hat with a white hatband is lighting a cigarette. The light catches on the ring he wears on the little finger of his left hand. Not a wedding ring
As one of few personal touches, Sherlock spots a couple of framed family photographs on the mantelpiece of the fireplace. They mostly show Tiffany during various stages of her life, from baby to toddler to nursery-child to student. As in her photographs featured in the press, she rarely smiles but often seems dreamy and far away. In some of the family shots where apparently she was told to smile, her face looks like a grimace. Sherlock recalls that there are similar pictures of himself. He always hated being photographed as well.
“Did you love him, too?”
“What do you mean?”
“And secretly in love with someone who doesn’t return it?” John shakes his head, reaches over to take Sherlock’s phone out of his hand and lean in to kiss him. “I don’t think so, Cyrano. In the story
John’s face darkens momentarily, probably at the reminder of him abandoning Sherlock. But at the mention of the game, his expression brightens. “What was that like, then?”
And speaking of nerves and expectations ... A little further away, John sees Sherlock warming up, bent over his bike. He seems lost in a world of his own, listening to something on his phone, the earbuds hidden somewhere under his sweaty mop of hair. His eyes are closed, his head bowed deeply over his aerobars. Unlike many others who prefer a more upright position during warm-up, he is already riding his time trial bike, his lower arms propped up on the aerobars. John wonders if he’s going to ride it during regular stages as well, eschewing the normal racing bikes with their different sets of handlebars. It’s almost as if Sherlock’s married to his bloody machine.
“But I don’t,” spits Moran, stepping so close to Sherlock that their noses are almost touching. Sherlock feels the urgent need to take a step back, but stands his ground.
John nodded as he watched Sherlock whip out his magnifyer and descend upon the body, not even bothering with a greeting. “Hi everyone. Yes, we did. Another one, too, the following day. It was brilliant, but far too short a trip. The landscape is spectacular.”
He has reached the door, and begins to feel around for a lock or handle. It soon turns out that whatever lock there was has been welded shut. The door is slightly corroded in places. It must have been installed a long time ago. The hinges, unfortunately, still feel very sturdy, and yield no point of attack without heavy tools. The bricks surrounding the metal doorframe feel hard and firm, too. They are of a more recent date than the bricks on the lower walls of the tunnel, once again supporting Sherlock’s deduction that the door and the bit of wall it’s set into have been added at a later date to block exit from the tunnel. Sherlock wonders what’s on the other side.
“Anderson’s really good at this,” John observed after watching the commotion for a while.
The phone’s screen turns black and John steps back, his heart pounding. What does this mean? Is it because of the investigation that Victor wants to meet with Sherlock, or is something else going on there? And why is he, John, so alarmingly jealous? Yes, he’s in love with Sherlock, but they’re not in a relationship. Sherlock is his friend but has stated on several occasions he’s not interested in more.
Sherlock sips his tea.
“What things?”
“They’ve already requested a medical helicopter,” pants Sherlock who has ridden up to John, nodding towards the skies. “Wiggins won’t be continuing with this Tour de France. He’s out.”
He’s excited and anxious in equal measure. There are so many things that can go wrong. He feared illness, work, the weather, and his cousin’s outright refusal to have him around. But so far, everything has worked out well. They have reached the outskirts of Washington now. The weather is dull and grey and cold, the sky overcast with the Downs hidden in fog, but it’s neither raining nor is there a storm blowing. Now Sherlock only has to live through tea with the Warringtons and possibly endure a minimum of interaction with his cousins and whatever guests Christopher invited, and then, if he seizes the right moment, he’ll be free.
“I don’t know if I’d have managed another year,” John admitted quietly. “Not the way I was trying to cope. I’d either have moved on, deleted you as best I could, maybe gotten married and all that.” He didn’t mention the alternative, and didn’t have to. Sherlock gave a brief nod.
Mr. Suffield takes a gulp of his tea. “Left at four yesterday morning, walked to Bletchley.” He hesitates briefly, casting a quick glance at his wife before letting out a breath. ”Met some mates in town who’d just returned from their shift .”
wasn’t the one who left his family, and moreover told his son that it had been the child’s fault that his marriage broke apart. I didn’t let my love-life influence my familial or parental duties nor my political career.”
. Sherlock is clearly suffering but tries not to let it show.
John shook his head, deciding to clear a few things up because Lestrade’s expression was one of horrified curiosity. “Well, some of the artworks are clearly more flattering than the pap shots. I never looked this ripped even when I was still playing rugby regularly. And they tend to stylise Sherlock as this pale supermodel and drape him over furniture (or me) in a number of seductive poses. According to him these would give him some nasty back pain in reality. Wonder what those artists and authors would say if they knew what’s really going on – namely, a great big nothing.”
“What’s going on?” murmurs Sherlock groggily, his usually sharp mind obviously not quite online. John squints at his phone. He’s got several messages from friends and family, mostly his sister, and lots of twitter notifications. “Apparently there’s an article about me in
John hands a notebook to Lestrade, who takes it with a surprised but grateful expression. “You know, should the two of you ever find yourselves out of work, I’d gladly take you on the squad.”
“I know some excellent restaurants in London,” says Sherlock, smiling gently. “Some of the owners even give me free or extra portions because I solved cases for them.”
John looks at him gravely. “So without something to occupy your mind, it turns on itself, tearing itself apart?”
He walks back to his bike. Realising that John is not behind him, he turns to see the doctor standing with his hands in his pockets and his shoulders drawn up, shaking his head as he gazes at Sherlock.
, the team’s therapists and other helpers will be waiting with the
“No, go ahead. I have to make a few phone-calls.”
“Does Mummy know?”
Wilkes’ eyes narrow at this. He steps closer to John and Victor, lowering his voice, despite them being the only ones on the jetty, without even Sherlock in hearing distance. “If I had to put a name to who’s behind all this—”
“When did you bleach your hair?” asks John.
“John,” murmured Sherlock hoarsely, “I think you should speed up a bit. Otherwise ...,” he nodded towards his nether regions with an impish smile.
Scowling at the splendid interior of the foyer with its large chandelier and stylish furniture, John shifts his phone nervously from hand to hand as he waits for a reply. Which, to his relief, comes promptly.
“Oh, he’s been running experiments on them all afternoon. These are some of the few that survived intact. He told me to tape the lower ends of the stalks with sellotape to prevent them from splitting and curling upwards in the water,” she said with a thoughtful glance at the flowers.
Wilkes shrugs. “Well, there are many who’d be delighted to see me quit the race.”
“Yes. Offa’s Dyke, the old border-wall between the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia and the Romano-Celtic one of Powys, runs just over there.”
is still over two minutes behind. Ricoletti is visibly fuming. He is going to lose his yellow jersey to Moriarty. John spots him riding next to one of the official red Tour cars in agitated conversation with a
“Yes. And that’s why you’re still here.”
To John’s mild surprise, Sherlock indeed shouldered the rucksack and after adjusting the straps, he mounted. When they returned to the main thoroughfare that would lead them out of the centre and onto the D902, the one and only road to and over the Col du Galibier, the doctor already started to appreciate the loss of weight and pressure on his back. So far, his shoulder had behaved surprisingly well, apart from the occasional sting at a more vigorous pull at the handlebars, but there was an ominous feeling that after the long descent with its harsh jolts and bumps and the constant strain on his arms due to braking he was going to pay the price in the evening. Hopefully, Sherlock would agree to carry the pack downhill as well to spare John’s injury some additional aggravation.
“I’m fine, John,” Sherlock assured him, his mood obviously lifting because of John’s concern. “The bike seems undamaged, too, which is the girls’ luck, although no doubt their parents’ insurance would have covered the replacement of one of these Simplons. At least the dog didn’t bite me this time.”
Despite the heating being on and Mrs. Hudson having been around to light a fire in the fireplace (as well as depositing scones on the coffee table), without the immediate exercise John was beginning to feel the chill in his sweaty clothes. He dashed up to his room for some comfortable gear to change into and hurried in the bathroom. Sherlock had less natural insulation than him, so it was vital for him to change quickly to avoid catching a cold.
“Kent?” asks John, before realisation dawns on him. “Oh, you mean because of the message?” Immediately, he looks excited. “Great, I’m in if you want me around.”
After some more searching, John found the rucksack in the bathroom. Deciding against getting rid of his wet clothes and to take a shower before attending to the injured, he returned to the room with the first aid kit in hand. Glancing over Sherlock’s shoulder, he scanned the laptop screen. It showed a list of chemical formulas.
“Married to your work?” prompted John.
“Read on, Sherlock,” John says patiently. A hint of a smile is playing around his lips, but it’s sad. Sherlock lets out a sigh. Who knows, perhaps John would have referred to his girl as some kind of royalty, too. They’ll never know now.
“No,” Sherlock snapped vehemently. “No, I don’t. If he wants my forgiveness, he can damn well come here and ask for it. I haven’t needed him in my life for almost three decades, and I certainly don’t need him now. He made very clear what he thought of me back then. I don’t need to hear it again. Or who do you think suggested I needed therapy to ‘cure’ me? He’s wrought enough damage. I’m better off without him – have always been, actually.”
He makes a gesture that seems to encompass everything. Sherlock understands. “You’re welcome,” he replies quietly, holding John’s gaze, hoping to convey with his eyes what he finds difficult to put into words. He, too, has missed ‘his’ John, the doctor, the soldier, the friend. He’s seen quite enough of the grieving father and ex-husband lately.
“I do, actually.”
“How so?”
Now it’s Sherlock who is avoiding his eyes. “It’s ... personal,” he says evasively. “There are some things ... things we need to clear up, once and for all.”
Reaching up, John ran a hand along his jaw, feeling the rasp of faint stubble, before leaning forward and kissing him tenderly. “Excellent deduction, my brilliant detective,” he murmured when he drew back. “Thank you, Sherlock.”
“You’re welcome,” replies Sherlock, cringing internally at how formal his voice sounds. “Any time,” he adds, to make up for the formality, causing John to grin, now with his eyes as well.
Sherlock bites his lip, brushing his lank curls from his forehead. He should have carried Tiffany to spare John the pain.
Hope motions for her to follow him to the fireplace, where he begins to explain about the game. Outwardly, Jennifer Wilson looks bored throughout his long-winded and overly dramatic narration, although Sherlock notices how tense and excited she is underneath her carefully maintained calmness. He completely understands how she must be feeling, having been in the same situation before. He creeps closer to the hole for a better view of the two small bottles Hope places, one after the other, on the dirty mantelpiece. Oh, even watching somebody else play the game is exciting. He’s still convinced he chose the right bottle before his latest reset, even though it turned out not to be the case.
“Basically, yes. And now, the members of the Black Hand wouldn’t have hurt him. That’s not how they operate.”
“But you’re right,” she gazed at Sherlock. “Things between us are tense at the moment. Andrew’s death hit her badly – both of us, in fact. She’s withdrawn from me, spends most of her time in her room or with our neighbours’ horses. That, in fact, is the one thing that seems to be keeping us together at the moment: our mutual love for horses. It’s what made us bond in the first place, you see. So when two of our neighbours’ animals died, one shortly after another, Emma was deeply upset. One had been her favourite and she had helped groom it and prepare it for shows for a while now, and was even present when that particular mare’s latest foal was born this spring. Our neighbours breed Suffolk Punches, you must know. They have a considerably large farm and stud, and they also train the horses to pull vehicles and work the fields. Sometimes they’re used for period films or commercials, or educational material. They also have some Icelandic horses for riding and produce cider from ecologically grown apples. Emma spends most of her free time at their place and loves the animals dearly. She wants to be a vet some day – well, that’s her emergency plan anyway if being named the first person to fly to Mars doesn’t work out. So you can imagine her and mine and our neighbours’ shock when in the span of about a month two of their most valuable Punches – their stallion and the prize mare – were found dead in the stables.”
Sherlock shrugs. “Why not? Since he is sitting at home or is locked away in some rehab facility, he might as well make himself useful. Might speed his recovery, too.”
Sherlock inclines his head toward her, reaching out to take her hand and kiss it. “Miss Adler, always a pleasure.”
Sherlock only frowned as he donned his coat and wrapped the scarf round his neck before flipping up the collar. John shook his head. “It was kind of you to give some to Molly, although she seemed a little irritated by the gesture.”
Sherlock thinks for a moment. “The ‘Them’ had just been introduced.”
– when, “Someone is coming,” says Tiffany suddenly. Sherlock listens to the key in the lock downstairs followed by slow, heavy footsteps. “Hope it’s not dad already,” she goes on. “I’d like to stay longer.”
He needn’t have worried, however. Suddenly, he feels John’s leg brush his under the table, and one of his hands steal over to his as they rest in his lap. John’s fingers brush his, and he smiles involuntarily, his heart leaping. Immediately after, he tries to hide his joy. This is interesting, observing himself in love, doing couply things. Alas! In the past, he reviled public displays of affection whenever he witnessed them. To suddenly take active part in them is novel, exciting and embarrassing all at once.
“Possibly. He appears to have been dealing with several different – and adversarial – parties at the same time and lost track of his many obligations. Moreover it looks like he got greedy and wanted to switch business partners. His former clients weren’t too happy about it.”
A brief flash of an idea races through Sherlock’s mind as he notices her lipstick, some spark of memory, but it vanishes before he can grasp and reevaluate the thought, and he returns to studying Molly and her companions.
Shaking his head, John grinned broadly. “Don’t be ridiculous. I’d have to tie you up to keep you from dashing to a crime scene, so how on earth can I expect you to sit through a concert. Come on, let’s be off. You can always play for me tonight if you’re in the mood, and we’ll have our music. Besides, I’m also curious about this case. Molly seemed pretty excited.”
decides Sherlock after watching his expression intently. While the other listeners are standing lost in the music and the lyrics, some slightly swaying to the rhythm or even drying their eyes or clinging to their partners, with a few gazing at The Woman’s striking figure with fascination, desire or slight envy, the man’s eyes on her are harder. He looks possessive, jealous of everybody else in the room who sees her like this. Are they a couple? Does the man wish them to be?
“Well, he got his PhD, but he didn’t write the thesis himself, nor did he conduct the studies it documents. According to the file Gregson just sent – good thinking on his part, actually, to send it to me, too, not just to Suffolk Constabulary – there was a bit of a scandal a few years ago involving a thesis written in fact by one of Rutherford’s students which he subsequently claimed to have penned himself. The student found herself being exmatriculated over a shady financial matter to shut her up. The examination board very purposefully didn’t ask too closely about the origins of said thesis. Interestingly, they’d all received nice presents or academical favours. The fraud was discovered, however, and Rutherford was stripped of his title and made to leave his post. He seems to have spent some years abroad afterwards, licking his wounds and making contact with people like Lydia Montville before he resurfaced as Dr. Martin Sommersby about two years ago, acclaimed guest lecturer and freelance archaeologist with a number of high profile excavations and publications under his belt. Interestingly, there was an academic of the same surname in the early 1930s whose identity and credentials Rutherford appears to have acquired. Apparently Donovan gave a vital clue concerning this.”
Victor shrugs. “Perhaps. Guess I’d be more open, and I’d definitely try to accommodate his needs more than I did back then, instead of pushing forward when he was clearly uncomfortable and overwhelmed. But all of these ‘what ifs’ are useless now.”
“I’ll be quick,” he promises.
John must have stared, because when he looks up, his eyes meet Sherlock’s, who is watching him with an unreadable expression, holding his gaze staunchly until John breaks the connection, blushing. Sherlock jerks up his chin defiantly, his lips thinning.
“Me neither. I’ll be grateful if I reach Compiegne in one piece.”
“No, it isn’t. I tried to delete him, and avoided him on campus. He spent his weekends on his parent’s estate which increasing frequency, and the girlfriend was replaced by another after a relatively short while. But then at the end of Michaelmas Term he suddenly showed up at my quarters with an invitation to visit him in Norfolk. I was highly suspicious, but he won me over by asking me for help in a complicated matter involving his father which would challenge my deductive skills.”
“Yes. There are several options by whom, though.”
“I was a kid back then,” John went on. “I had not long before watched
thinks John.
“Same as yourself, Holmes. He’s been briefed at the Admiralty.”
“That’s brilliant. I remember you writing about them. I loved your accounts, but always regretted not having been there. Speaking of cases, whatever happened to our friend Moran? You never mentioned him in your letters, I suppose because most of it is still classified. I only read a few things about his trial in the papers whenever we could get British ones, but given that some of them were the
,” he then says. “
Sherlock swallowed. His tightly controlled expression wavered, the corners of his eyes crinkling and those of his mouth quirking in the faintest of smiles.
to split the group up further. Moriarty and his men are riding along but not attacking – yet. They are on their toes, though, ready to thwart attacks that could cost Moriarty his yellow jersey.
“Yes, I think it is.”
touching me.
“Sherlock,” John interrupts his musings.
John casts a glance at Sherlock who is sitting next to him and sipping from his orange juice, looking far less surprised by the news than everybody else. When he becomes aware of John watching him, he cocks an eyebrow and smiles mysteriously. John rolls his eyes, shaking his head and grinning. Of course Sherlock knew. He then shifts his attention back to Lestrade who isn’t done with his speech yet, it seems.
Sherlock exchanges a glance with John, who shrugs and smiles. “Sounds good, thank you,” says John, stepping past the couple, his rucksack and a small overnight bag in hands. “We were going to contact Dr. Rawlings, anyway, because she was the person to alert us to ... what has been happening here lately.”
The last comment is brought on by more rain drops, falling with increasing density now, accompanied by another gust of wind and a very distinct bolt of lightning, followed after a short while by the rumble of thunder.
“He cheated. It was pretty obvious. And we’ll get him for it. You, Wilkes and Ricoletti are only mere seconds apart, and you’re only twenty-five seconds behind Moriarty. And
John stares at him. “Shit. That must have been quite a shock. Eight years ... wow.”
“I usually am.”
“Sherlock,” repeats the boy. He pronounces it funnily. Sherlock laughs and corrects him. The boy gets it right on his second attempt. Sherlock points at him.
“Yes.”
John looks up in alarm from the second phone. Sherlock frowns. “Is everything all right with them?”
Like this, they stand for a while, kissing slowly yet thoroughly, trying out various angles and different degrees of pressure. It feels experimental. Sherlock approves. Whenever his mind permits, in between moments of utter distraction, he tries to catalogue John’s reactions to their activities, and to file them away for further analysis.
“Are you sure you’re fit to travel, Sherlock? Be honest, please.”
Another young woman is waiting outside, wearing curlers in her hair and a silk dressing gown over her pyjamas that betray her wealthy upbringing and look rather out of place in the rustic inn. She looks familiar, and he recalls seeing her at Ivy Farm. She, too, recognises him.
John sighs. He understands only too well what must have happened, and how Kit must be feeling now. Typical rookie mistake. Riding in a breakaway, even one as large as this one used to be throughout most of the stage, is far more stressful than rolling along in the peloton. You ride in the wind for longer stretches, you’ve got to constantly watch out for attacks from the others. You can’t just stop for a pee-break because your fellow breakaways won’t wait for you. It’s easy to forget about nutrition in the heat of battle, too. He doesn’t blame Kit at all. John’s been in similar situations throughout his long career. Even if he loses white today, Kit has exceeded expectations by far and has all reason to be proud of his achievement in this Tour. And perhaps it’s good that he learns a lesson about timely meals during this stage, where there’s no danger of him not making the time limit, halfway up the pass as he is already. There are more mountain stages ahead where he can try to win back his young rider’s jersey.
He withdraws a folder from his chosen day. It only covers the first shift. Sherlock sighs when he sees the amount of messages it contains. “This is going to take a while.”
“So you’ve got a boyfriend?”
Sherlock’s eyes narrow. Two can play this game, apparently. He never thought he’d enjoy this, engaging in teasing and suggestive remarks; that he would actively try to seduce John and not just surrender to his own arousal and let things be done to him. John appears to be enjoying the reversal of roles, too.
He returned to their seats half expecting Sherlock to be on the phone again, but instead the detective was sitting quite still, lost in thought. His expression was almost unreadable, but John thought he detected a tinge of sadness.
John laughs happily, relief surging through him. “Are there still any horizontal surfaces in this flat that are not occupied by poisoned gingerbread?”
“She’s from Northumbria,” says Sherlock after listening for a moment. “They still use a number of words with Scandinavian roots there, from when the Vikings invaded.”
“It’d be best if we ran into each other at the door, anyway,” goes on Lestrade, “to make it look like a chance meeting. Here are your tickets. I had them bought in advance. There’s bound to be a queue, though. This is a popular time, and a popular venue, and the fact that Irene Adler is performing tonight is going to draw even more people. I’m going to do a quick check of the area now. I ordered two patrols to be present, just in case.” He gives John and Sherlock a beady glance. “One never knows with you two. Do me a favour and behave, yeah?”
“No, I won’t calm down. I’ve told you plenty of times to not experiment with dangerous things in the kitchen,” John heard Mrs. Hudson thunder when he reached the landing. The door to the kitchen was open, as well as all the windows in the flat judging from the cold draught. From the corridor, John could see neither her nor Sherlock. Apparently they were in the living room. “All this stench will be difficult to get out of the curtains and the other fabrics. Your whole bedroom is going to reek of it – not that you use it much, but still. And those soot stains or scorch marks are everywhere, even on the ceiling. And you know how bad smoking is for you. And don’t you dare roll your eyes at me, and you will look at me when I chide you. You really have no idea how much we worry about you all the time, John and I, do you?”
me,” he says, hoping he sounds gentle, that Molly understands what he’s implying and that he won’t have to spell it out more clearly.
At Ivy Farm, John and Sherlock are greeted by an enthusiastic Kenworthy. “I’ve just spoken with Mr. Tiltman on the telephone,” he tells them in his office. “He has forwarded the messages to one of his colleagues who said they showed definite promise. They were very excited about it, and have also started an investigation at your place as to why the messages vanished from the archive, who handled them and everything.”
“Yes. A car is waiting for you, Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson. Please follow me. Your personal belongings have already been forwarded to the driver.”
Despite their relative rarity, each letter, telegram or phone-call from John were like a cup of hot tea on a cold night, keeping the flame of Sherlock’s love for this remarkable man alive, nurturing it and turning the sharp, passionate fire of their time together into something deep and steady. They were also painful reminders that John wasn’t there, that he was out at sea fighting a war, that his life was in constant danger. News about the fall of Singapore and Java didn’t help in that regard, causing Sherlock to desperately call his brother to enquire after the fate of HMS
“Feel free. My sheets are better quality than yours, and the mattress is firmer.”
Tiffany beams before her expression turns serious again. “A girl in my class, Alice, said that if you haven’t had a boyfriend by the age of twelve you might as well be dead.”
“Well spotted, Dr. Watson,” says Sherlock as he lowers himself to the mattress, artfully draping the towel over John’s head. John giggles and pulls it off, grinning at Sherlock, his eyes sparkling with mischief.
“‘Course not,” says Eddie. “That’d be pretty stupid, wouldn’t it? Would have damaged Zarah’s career, had it become widely known. After all, people paid to see her do the veil dance, not some rarely known double – pretty and talented though she was.”
Sherlock’s lips narrowed. He drew another breath, then nodded gravely. “We’ve been there before, remember? With Moriarty. He knew you were important to me even then, when officially we were still only flatmates and crime-solving colleagues. ‘I’ll burn the heart out of you’, that’s what he said, back at the pool. And he almost succeeded, not just with me. Nine months of grief and mourning for you, and the same time of darkness and loneliness and many things I wish I could delete for me.”
Sherlock watches The Woman closely. Her expression is guarded. She won’t reveal anything she doesn’t want to by accident. They need a different strategy to unlock her secrets. Unfortunately, before she can reply, Wilcox returns with a waiter in tow carrying a tray with a bottle of Champagne
and links it with somewhat mousey features and shy smiles directed at him.
The scene they behold makes clear how lucky they have been. What must have been a small indentation under the bushes – deep enough to hold some rainwater but too shallow to be recognised as the site of a bomb strike, thus ensuring that this unexploded device went unnoticed all these months and subsequently wasn’t defused and removed – has been deepened into an earthy crater by the explosion. Torn up bushes and the remains of a medium sized tree litter it. It is free of human remains, which Sherlock considers a good thing, although a small part of him mourns the opportunity to study those leftovers more closely. In front of him, John stoops to pick up something, which he holds up for Sherlock to see. It’s the burst remains of a football, strips of leather torn apart at the seams. Across the crater, a couple of shaken-looking but resolutely acting women have rounded up the children and are looking after their worst injuries, which appear to consist of scrapes and bruises, mostly. One boy holds his arm strangely. It’s either broken, or his shoulder has been dislocated. Sherlock assumes it’s the latter.
John snorted and grinned. “You just want to hear how brilliant you are.”
“Yes, sorry for having kept you waiting. Phone-call from London. Apparently we’ll be getting an important visitor in less than a week’s time. Thanks for looking after him, Dr. Stamford.” He shakes Mike’s hand.
“I’ll endeavour not to,” vows Sherlock, reaching for John’s hand and squeezing it. John is gazing at him with a fond smile. He looks quite touched. Sherlock feels an acute desire to kiss him – and where has this come from, this random need to suddenly kiss people? He’s mutating into a soppy, love-struck idiot. And what’s worse, he doesn’t even mind. Fascinating.
“John,” he begins, but John holds up a finger.
“If there was any reassurance it wouldn’t end up being fed body parts or die of neglect, I might even get you one. Unless you’d prefer a bunch of roses.”
He swallows again, reaching up to touch the scars surrounding the eye-patch carefully. “You were running next to a chap, next moment he wasn’t there anymore. Or the fellow right in front of you got hit, and you thought, had I been a bit faster, that bullet would have struck me. It was so utterly, horrifyingly random, the way people died. Had I not turned my head to check on the chap running next to me upon hearing a strangled cry and fearing he’d been hit, the bullet would have gone right through my eye. Like this, I was lucky. The other one wasn’t. The bullet whizzed over my closed eyelid and tore up the bridge of my nose and hit him. I think he died. I should have tried to find out ...” He swallows again. His hands which have come to settle on the rim of the sink have begun to tremble.
“More than you can imagine. But have a care, or this will be over very quickly.”
Riders start in reverse order of their GC placement, meaning the current bearer of the “red lantern”, a young Dutch rider from Team Netflix, sets out first at around eleven o’clock in the morning, while the current bearer of the yellow jersey, Moriarty, is expected to leave the starting ramp at four in the afternoon. Apart from the twenty-five riders leading in the GC who start with three minutes separating them, all others start with two minutes apart. John is currently positioned at rank 32, rather better than he expected. Of Team Speedy’s, only Kit and Sherlock are going to hit the track after him, while most of their teammates have either already finished their round or are
John slaps him playfully on the head. “Yes, you git. Off with them. They really look rather a mess. I doubt they’ll manage to save them. My jacket is worse. But Sherlock, I can’t buy a new suit. I haven’t enough coupons left since I had to buy so much civilian attire when I was send home to recuperate.”
“We’ll see, Dr Watson, we’ll see,” he now said. “I’ll have our bikes checked and prepared for the mountains next week. Would you like a third chain ring for the chainset?” he asked with a mischievous grin.
After a bit they reached a low bank, and the track Sherlock had mentioned. Urging the horses into a gentle tölt again, they followed it northwards until they reached a t-crossing where another path joined there’s from the west.
“I was. Honestly. But sometimes, you’re just ...”
article borrows heavily from an old interview Victor gave after our last Tour together. Many of his words have been misquoted in the German tabloid, been edited or taken out of context, or simply – wilfully – mistranslated. But the gist of the interview still shines through. Victor was angry and disappointed back then. The Tour hadn’t proceeded in a way to justify the hype surrounding his person, nor had it gone according to his own expectations. Suddenly there was this young, inexperienced time trialist winning all the stages he’d had in his sights. Add to this what happened between us in private ...,”
“Don’t stop,” breathes Sherlock.
John snorts contemptuously. “To his wallet, yeah.”
“I know. Still, watch your words, okay. This isn’t over yet. The shit with the press, I mean, and I fear it’s going to get uglier in the days to come. Imagine you’re the one they’re grilling. He’ll need all the support we can give him, okay?”
“Wrong. If I were exposed as a doper, it would hurt the team, and therefore you.”
“If you insist. You seem to be in rather a hurry to get me in there.” He gave John a wink and shut his laptop. “And it’s ‘sillier’.”
“Okay. Oh, and Sherlock,” John held him back gently when he set out to return to the kitchen.
John’s head jerks up some more, almost as if he were to stand to attention.
“Is water wet?” asks Bainbridge and winks at John. John sticks out his tongue at him.
“Sure. Thanks for coming.”
“I should apologise. We’ll be more careful in the future. Thank you, Lestrade.”
John nods darkly as Sherlock yawns again. John leaves him to his research and gets ready for the night. Sherlock only lasts another thirty minutes before, almost nodded off twice over his laptop, before he, too, clears his side of the bed of computer, tablet and papers and settles down next to John, curled up on his side. John puts down the book he’s been reading and smiles at him.
“I’ll make it. Somehow. Wilkes is not far behind. I’ll suck up to him and his teammates. And if I don’t make it ... at least you’ll be having a room to yourself soon. And now, piss off.”
John blinks, turns to her, frowns, blinks some more, swallows. “This is ...” He huffs, shakes his head slightly as if finding it difficult to believe his eyes. He smiles a little uncertainly. “This is brilliant,” he manages at last, his voice oddly tight. “It’s ... perfect.” He casts another glance around, taking in the mess, before looking at Sherlock. “I see you already moved in?”
“They should be arriving early tomorrow,” she said. “They’re taking the ferry from Esbjerg to Harwich.”
In desperation, he shifts onto his back and kicks out. His legs, at least, are free. The darkness lifts. Warm light washes over him when the blanket he was tangled in flies away. He gulps in a deep breath, looks around wildly. He is on the sofa in his own living room. The television is off, but the orange glow from the streetlamps down on Baker Street is filtering through the curtains. Other than that, the room is cast in gloom. It appears to be night, or late evening at least. He has slept more than eight hours.
“I would gladly enlighten you about the deductive reasoning behind my statement, Miss Donovan, but I think we should concentrate on the matter at hand. You, and you, Mr. Suffield, were at work last night. What time did you leave, and how did you travel to Bletchley?”
“Because they don’t want to be found out, perhaps? You saw yourself to what lengths they went to hide their little undertaking.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Yes. Angelo insists.”
John frowns. “Coming? Where are we going?”
As he glanced around the room to see if they’d forgotten anything, his eyes resting on the majestic shape of the Croix des Têtes for a moment before turning his back on the view, John realised that Sherlock hadn’t shown any indication of working on the case all morning. Not sure whether he should be worried or pleased about that, he closed the door behind them.
A thump in his back tells Sherlock that in the row right behind him, the woman attending the show with her fiancé has just kicked her man, likely because he was leering a bit too obviously. Sherlock has to admit that despite the fact that The Woman is wearing far more than the naked ‘Tableaux Vivantes’ earlier, because of the way she moves and how her dress sometimes reveals and sometimes hides her skin, and how the silk clings to her body because of its clever bias cut, she is more enticing, even to him. He steals a glance at John who is staring at her wide-eyed, his mouth partly open. Sherlock feels tempted to discreetly kick him as well, before berating himself for this desire.
John shrugs again. “Don’t know. It’d be nice to settle down at some point. Not necessarily with a wife and kids, mind. Just ... someone I could see myself spending the rest of my life with.”
“Yes, it would,” says John thoughtfully. He frowns at Sherlock. “Your brother is going to be there as well, isn’t he?”
John looked up at him, aware of their proximity. Sherlock’s light-coloured eyes seemed almost golden in the warm light in the room, but his expression was stern. “So this was taken at Monte Carlo,” asked John, “and the guy with his arm round you is that South American drug-baron you were trying to seduce to get at his list of contacts?”
“Tiffany’s?” asks John, snapping a photo with his phone.
“Don’t touch it,” Sherlock hears one, a girl, by the sound of it, say. She adds something else, but her words are swallowed by the babble of the other children and the racket the dog makes. There’s a rustle of foliage, then a splash. “Hey, Spot, get out of there. You’re getting all muddy,” cries one of the children, and the others begin calling the dog to return from wherever it got itself into.
“Normal is boring. Oh, don’t look at me like that. You are as excited as I am.”
“As you wish, sir. Would you like something to refresh yourselves, too? I could have tea brought up?”
John shook his head, smiling, but then winced at the movement. Sherlock’s expression changed into one of concern. John sighed. “Guess it’s bed for me now. Thanks again for the excellent dinner and for letting us stay here, Katie.”
John is already in bed by the time Sherlock returns to his room. Sherlock is touched to notice how familiar the sight is already, how self-evidently John has occupied what seems to become ‘his’ side in ‘their’ bed. Sherlock reels with a powerful stab of sentiment when he takes in the scene, steadying himself against the doorframe. John looks up from the book he’s been leafing through in the light of the small lamp. “All right?”
“Asp viper. Quite poisonous, mortality rate of untreated bites at about four percent,” announced Sherlock, slowing down..
“Probably, if we get caught by Magnussen’s team or the deliverer.”
“Could the toxin have been in the hay?” mused John. “You said the stallion died about a month ago, so I guess the animals weren’t kept out at pasture at this time of year.”
Sherlock raises his left hand and studies the skin of its back. It still shows the mark of his teeth. It smarts a little. He bit it rather hard, trying to stifle the sounds he was making. But at least he hasn’t drawn any blood.
John’s head twitches in a shake. “Actually, no, we haven’t. Not about what I mean.”
dead. I saw him kill himself. And whatever may still be left of his organisation is dispersed and lacking concise and ruthless leadership, a mastermind to pull the strings in the background. No, this is something else.” He feels John’s eyes on him.
, about John, so often during the time they spent apart, the mere fact that now, after three years of longing and pining, John is here, and intimacy is suddenly an option again, is almost overwhelming. And even though he wants it, wants desperately to be close to John, Sherlock feels anxious and woefully unprepared at the same time. It’s not as if he has a lot of experience in that field in the first place, and what little there is, is connected with John. They only had about three months together before John was deployed again, and apart from a kiss in the kitchen interrupted by Lestrade, and some chaste cuddling in the back of the D.C.I.s car on their way to Dartford and back, Sherlock hasn’t been intimate with anybody ever since John went back to sea. What if he has unlearned how to do things?
To his utter astonishment and surprise Sherlock Holmes, the world’s only consulting detective, finds that this is a riddle he doesn’t want to investigate – much less solve – right now. There is time for it some other day. For now, there is an appointment with scones and tea and good conversation, and later with a promising novel for the journey back to London (he must persuade John to drive). They could go out for dinner tonight. Angelo’s, with a candle on the table. Or perhaps Lestrade or another officer of the MET will come over with a case. There’s the prospect of more kissing, and new bedroom arrangements at their flat. Mrs. Hudson will be delighted to win her bet with Mrs. Turner concerning their changed relationship status.
Sherlock regards him, one eyebrow twitching up. “Well, I think I can still do this.” He steps away from John, takes a moment to concentrate and gather himself, before spinning around in a near-perfect pirouette. John laughs and claps in appreciation.
“What happened to her?” John wants to know.
Sherlock is allowed to phone Molly at his lodgings, who a little more than an hour later arrives at Buckingham winded and sweaty, having cycled the entire way. She reports that Deirdre met her at Sherlock’s and John’s accommodation, worried about
This actually impressed Sherlock. As a child he had always been curious about Ellie who seemed so different from other people, and so much more interesting. Her being called a witch made her even more fascinating in his book, and he spent a day trying to find out if she was actually able to do magic, with inconclusive results, however.
“Okay. But let us know if things take a turn to the worse. We have another call nearby and would return here if required.”
“Tell Molly to call her superior’s office directly.”
“You may have, occasionally. But don’t stop now.”
Sherlock shakes his head. “No, John, this is it for me. Also,” and now his hand slides over the table to reach for John’s, which he squeezes gently, “without you as a team- and roommate, I’m not interested in riding another race.”
“A bit, yeah. Touched, too. Very much so, in fact. To be the only one to ... you know …”
“Excellent. That apple pie from a few days ago wasn’t too bad.” John smiles at Sherlock and nods his head in the direction of the canteen. Sherlock studies his face once more. Despite John’s obvious mirth and affection, he thinks he can detect a trace of something else lingering, a hint of sorrow, or regret. He wonders what else Mycroft told him. Have they talked about John’s deployment? Churchill spoke of a commendation, but does that mean John may stay, or will he be sent back at sea at the nearest opportunity? Has he been given a date already? Does he know when his time with Sherlock is going to end? Sherlock knows that he could ask, and that most probably, John would answer truthfully. He is tempted to enquire. He hates not knowing things. But he is also aware that knowing this would tinge what time he has left with John with unbearable sadness, and that if John wanted him to know, he would have told him straight away.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about. I’m no druggie like you. Nor am I queer. It wasn’t me who started it.”
Sherlock laughs softly at the comment. He feels light and slightly dizzy, but in a good way. This is so exciting. It’s almost as good as being kissed by John. The possibilities ... oh, they are marvellous, both for crime-fighting and case-solving. They’ll have to work on communicating with their environment – the world of the living – of course. He wonders whether Lestrade actually got his texts and emails asking for cases. Can living people receive ghost messages sent electronically? He needs to find out. And as for Mrs. Hudson, there are two possibilities. Either, she can easily communicate with ghosts, which Sherlock wouldn’t put beyond her. Perhaps her consumption of herbal soothers helps there. Or ...
depicting the view John wakes to in the morning:
Sherlock grins at this. “Oh, that shouldn’t be a problem, sir,” he says, his mind already spinning with ideas. They’re likely going to need a car for this venture, at least for the stretch beyond London. It won’t do to show up on foot or bicycle after walking miles from the station along dusty country lanes. He has several ideas where to commandeer a suitable vehicle. He hopes John knows how to drive, and that moreover he can be persuaded to accompany Sherlock, although he doubts the doctor is going to refuse.
Sherlock blushes and wipes at it. “Gone?”
Freak – and being different. He doesn’t care if people like him, as long as they fear his deductions. He builds a reputation of being something of an arsehole, albeit a brilliant one with observational skills bordering on magic. He revels in this status.
Does he really wish to view its contents? There could be photographs, video-files, even. There could be pictures of his little girl, stealthy, grainy shots from a wide-angle lense, probably, taken by people from the intelligence community on Mycroft’s behest. Jesus, there could even be sound. He could hear his daughter’s voice again after more than half a year, a voice he was convinced was going to be silent to him forever.
Sherlock feels another wave of heat rise into his cheeks. “There isn’t much to know,” he says, drawing a deep breath to prepare himself for spilling some of his own secrets. It seems only fair.
“Unless you’re resolutely set against it, so it would appear.”
Apologies for the cliffhanger. I hope this chapter makes up for it. Thanks again to rifleman_s for quick and helpful beta work, and to everybody who commented on the last chapter or left kudos.
“With Victor?” asks John before his brain interferes.
“Guess it’s possible,” muses John. “Risky, though. Have you talked to Molly and the other mechanics about this?”
Therefore, thankful for the task, he begins to recount the case of missing Nora Perkins, of his investigation, and of his deductions based on her co-worker’s account which ultimately led him to Brompton Road Station. Lestrade writes down notes, and fills in what he can on Sherlock’s statement form.
For the last two kilometres before the climb, Sherlock simply pulled him along when John couldn’t take the lead anymore, at least not at decent speed. John lacked the strength for more work in the wind. His left leg is about to cramp, and his shoulder is killing him. Each pothole or bump on the road feels like the stab of a knife. He’s going to need a long descend to recover, but he has to endure another six or seven kilometres of steady uphill cycling before he can rest his legs. The road isn’t steep. The average gradient of this climb is around four percent. But the gradient is irregular, constantly changing, often too steep for a large gear, and too flat for a small one, meaning he has to shift gears constantly and often feels as if he’s been glued to the tarmac without moving much at all.
Well, some of this guard had softened under John’s influence, he was sure, but whether Sherlock would ever be willing to open up completely he did not know. And now the very chance to get away from London, the Work and his own commitments was in danger, a fact John mourned but did not bring up when he urged Sherlock to take the case, his heart leaping despite his disappointment when he saw the gratefulness in the grey eyes, and the manic, happy glint when Sherlock began devouring the files.
She shrugs, sipping on her drink. “Well, it did seem odd to me that James severed all contact to the team, and particularly you, after you’d been roomies and friends for so long. I thought he’d keep in touch with somebody he’d been that close with. He must have been in a very dark place for some time.”
“Didn’t think I was this slow for Mortimer to catch up with me,” John tells Sam via radio. “Isn’t he more of a mountain goat?”
Tiffany nods, her eyes still glued to the screen. “It’s amazing that they can still find out all these things, even after so many years. Imagine this man stuck in the peat for two thousand years and then some worker finds him by accident, and then these scientists can tell what his last meal was and how he died. That’s brilliant.”
He does, placing two tins with Jammie Dodgers
Sherlock holds up one of the shards, then points at the floorboards. John whistles softly. “Do ghosts bleed?”
Sitting huddled in jacket, coat and blanket with Sherlock’s scarf still wound round his neck, John felt a bit like a useless idiot when the rest began moving the foal into the horse-trailer attached to Peter’s car, no easy undertaking since Ælgifu was stressed and frisky, tossing her head and sidestepping so that Peter and Katie had to take her between themselves and hold tight onto her halter. The children were loading the saddles and bridles of the Icelanders into Peter’s car. Originally Peter had wanted to ride them home to avoid stressing them by putting them into the trailer with the lively foal, but considering that the rain was still strong and it was very dark by now, he decided to drive them. Just as the children were readying the two mares for transport, two police constables stepped up to the door, brushing rain off their uniforms. Both were looking rather disgruntled.
Storming out of the room, his mind swirling with troubling thoughts, Sherlock collides with John who has come up the stairs, apparently to look for him. One of John’s hands lands on Sherlock’s shoulder to steady him, the touch warm even through the double layer of fabric of jacket and shirt. “Sherlock, you okay? Did he bother you?”
(John always teased him about his vocabulary when it came to sexual terms) – an experimental lick. It elicits another full body shiver from John, another deep moan. His hip jerks up. Sherlock smiles. He must be doing it right, then. The taste is wonderfully familiar, as is the smell, up so close. Both are incredibly arousing. John won’t have to touch him at all if things continue in this vein.
Not much else of interest could be unearthed about Vanessa Warrington née Burns. Born in 1978, she has been working for Worthing Council for almost fifteen years, ever since graduating from the University of Reading with a BA in Business and Management, but with a five year break when she was looking after Tiffany until the girl went on to school. A former tennis player with some success as a teenager, active in the local community, went to Ibiza with a couple of female friends last year according to her Twitter account. Married Daniel, who apparently she met at a friend’s wedding, in 2005. Her looks haven’t changed much as her tweeted selfies reveal. She still appears to be working out occasionally (running, her figure suggests), but no longer plays tennis due to wrist surgery in 2011.
“It must be something on me that causes the reset,” he muses aloud.
John nods darkly. “Yes, I know. My uncle fought in the Boer War, and my granddad against the Zulus. Grandpa was deeply troubled by what he saw down there, so much so that he tried to hinder Uncle Charlie from going to South-Africa to fight against the Boers. Granddad always said it wasn’t our war to fight. But I’m surprised. You
“You should go and see Mike or Irene if your neck continues to bother you,” he tells Sherlock. “I’d rather not massage you too firmly there.”
Sherlock gazes at him, shrugs, starts to grin. “Well. It was, wasn’t it? All that rutting and sighing? Even if it was unintentional. Or were you simply feigning sleep to indulge in a bit of frottage on purpose?”
When eventually, after a whispered “All right?” from John answered by an enthusiastic nod, John slips his hand between his legs and begins to stroke, Sherlock hides his head in John’s shoulder and holds on to him for dear life, not trusting himself to do or say anything because the sensation but even more the wave of sentiment crashing in on him are overwhelming. John holds him throughout his orgasm when it strikes, whispers things into Sherlock’s ear and his sweaty curls which Sherlock isn’t equipped to listen to and process at that moment.
The boy tilts his head to the side. He says something in a language Sherlock has never heard before. It sounds ... old, somehow. Some words are even faintly familiar, in an odd, subconscious way Sherlock can’t explain. The language sounds like the land under his feet feels, the words like the very bones of language the same way the flint fossils buried in the chalk are the bones of this land. Sherlock feels a shiver run down his spine. Perhaps, he thinks, this is Irish, and the boy is one of the Irish Travellers. It could be Irish. Or some Scandinavian language, in the way some of the words are familiar.
“Yes, she revealed some interesting facts.”
Team Arla’s party is already in full swing when a large delegation from Team Speedy’s arrives shortly after nine. The lobby has been taken over, music is playing. On a television in one corner, football is on, with a considerable number of people watching raptly. Even though only very few of the party-guests are actually drinking alcohol, this fact doesn’t diminish the exuberance of the activities. Several chairs and tables have been pushed to the sides to create a small dancefloor where currently Søren and some of his teammates are jumping up and down with the beat. On the far side, somewhat shielded from view by the bulky Dane, Carrefour’s Bernard and Lachapelle are dancing together in a close embrace. John watches them for a moment, touched by their obvious affection for one another and how unconcerned they seem, lost in their own private world. He chances a look at Sherlock who, however, is glancing towards the foyer where Henry Baskerville and some of his teammates are standing, uncertain whether they’re allowed to join the fun or not.
“I found a syringe in your cupboard. It had been used, albeit not recently.”

“Makes sense,” says John. “Well, good luck, then.” It’s not lost on him that this time, Sherlock doesn’t invite him along.
John flashes him a lopsided smile. “I promise. Any ideas what to do with the rest of the evening?”
Sherlock grew increasingly irritated. “What is it, John? What did I say?”
“Will you tell this in the morning too?” Edmund wanted to know.
“Yes, some of it. I even took photos, which I’m going to send you later.”
“A few samples have been taken, but they were all Kerke’s.”
Heaving a deep breath, he turns to Sherlock, fixes him with a steady look, and says, “Sex, Sherlock. I was referring to sex.”
“Does that mean you want one, too.”
He is right. After a hectic, thankfully accident-free descent into the mountain village of Bielle, the
“You could have slipped on loose gravel – which in fact at one instance you did – and taken a permanent shortcut down the slope. You could have hit one of the cars, or they you.”
She rolled her eyes.
“Bit of a shame, nice car like that,” mutters the eye-patch man, which earns him a beady glance from his father.
John’s eyebrows rise almost into his hairline when he sees the bed.

intrusive, unwelcome thoughts supply. John tries to shut them up, coursing his latent, mostly unfounded jealousy.
“I know you hate not being able to think,” said John gently. “And moreover I know that it scares you. Guess it would scare me, too, were I in your situation. But Sherlock, that’s what sex is about, too. It’s about trusting and letting go, letting yourself get overwhelmed and not overthinking everything. And while it’s laudable that you want to try and keep concentrating on me and my reactions throughout it, it’s totally okay to simply enjoy it, or, you know, take turns. Whatever. It’d be totally okay for me if we concentrated solely on you for a while. God, Sherlock, you wanted to know how it’d go about making love to you. I’d do just that. I’d do all the things you indicated to me that make you feel good. I know you enjoy when we kiss, so there’d be a lot, and I mean
Molly is gazing at him doubtfully but refrains from digging deeper. She raises the mug. “Your coffee. I’m sorry it took so long. The coffee-machine didn’t work properly.”
Another shudder passes through John. He has to forcefully remind himself that this time, Sherlock is fine. A bit bashed up, true, but he’s been through far worse. They both have. It’s unlikely his injuries are life-threatening. His concussion is a mere nuisance and is going to result in a moping, sulking flatmate for a few days. The fact he sprained the wrist of his dominant hand may require John to help him with certain things such as dressing and undressing.
She smiles and waves a hand. John watches her leave before returning to his room. Molly’s words have rekindled hope in his heart. Sherlock is pining for him. If only the dratted stage were over already so that they could finally talk.
Sherlock hums thoughtfully. “Interesting. Tell him to watch out for more things like that. Unfortunately, I don’t have the time to view every bit of footage that’s out there, so an extra pair of eyes would be helpful. He is experienced and knows what to look out for.”
Sherlock thinks, taking another bite of the biscuit. They really are rather nice. He nods slowly, chewing thoughtfully. “Yes, it would. But Moriarty is dead.
There is a brief exchange of salutes. Sherlock isn’t sure how naval hierarchy works in this case because actually Watson is of higher rank than the other, but he isn’t of the Admiralty, and also he’s a medical officer. Apparently they have met before, as there are no introductions.
After ascending the Côte de Cruseilles, a relatively short descent and an ensuing category four climb to Côte de Peguin, the peloton approaches the last and longest climb of the day. The mountain massif hiding their destination, the ski-resort of Le Grand-Bornand, can already be seen mounting to their right, with sheer sides of light-grey stone studded with trees in the lower reaches, the bare peaks, despite the hot summer, still carrying traces of snow in nooks and crannies of their northern faces. The riders are about to traverse this mountain-range via the Col de la Colombière in a south-western direction. The mountain pass climbs to 1618 metres of altitude over almost twelve kilometres, with gradients ranging between four and twelve percent.
The world’s only consulting detective was however not available for by-ear deductions. He was still sitting unmovingly with his eyes closed, his hands folded over his stomach, his long legs stretched out under the table well into John’s footspace. He wasn’t asleep, though. John could tell by the tension in his body, the way his hands and feet twitched occasionally and his eyes moved underneath the closed lids. Not REM sleep, but deep thought. Now and again Sherlock’s lips would move as he soundlessly mumbled to himself. The game was one, it seemed, and Sherlock’s hard drive had accelerated to full case-mode.
“Yes.”
send some tiny flakes were visible on the rim of her jeans pocket, together with a trace of white substance. Also, there were some small stains on the front of her t-shirt. You saw the photographs. It’s turquoise with some darker blue flowery pattern which almost obscured the stains.”
By Sherlock’s expression, so could he.
John frowns at him, before sighing. “You’re right, I guess. I’ll rinse them out anyway.” He cocks his head as he mulls over Sherlock’s words. “What kind of shocking thing might you be referring to? Is your brother into anything ... odd?”
Silence reigns immediately after this speech, before slowly, one after another, people begin to clap, until roaring applause rings amid the huts and trees and across the lake. Sherlock has been stopped from rolling his eyes by John standing to attention next to him, and raising his hand in a salute. He looks visibly moved by the speech. Sherlock has to admit that he, too, is somewhat touched, but rather by the acknowledgement of Jenny’s deed than any allusions to patriotism. Churchill knows how to work the crowds, how to rouse people and to instil a sense of national pride while at the same time fostering feelings of duty and community. Silently, Sherlock scoffs at himself. He thought he’d be more immune to the Prime Minister’s words and the obvious propaganda behind them. But perhaps it’s all John’s fault again. Sherlock may be able to shrug off notions of patriotism. However, he’s certainly not immune to John Watson attired in dark blue and gold, standing proud and tall with his fingers touching his cap.
right. I have no proof for or against it. I didn’t know Jenny personally apart from seeing her briefly on the day she died. And I loathe to base my deduction on a vague feeling and instinct. But ...,” he lets out a long breath, exasperated at how jumbled his thoughts are. Something is missing still. Some vital clue or link to put it all together. Or rather, it’s already there, he just can’t grasp it, and not even John’s presence is helping.
“It’s okay, love. It’s okay,” he whispers. “I’ve got you, and I won’t leave you again, I promise.”
Sherlock breaks the spell. Turning his back to John to place his violin in the case lying on one of the two beds, Sherlock motions towards the ensuite with the hand holding the bow. “I assume you want your shower now. It’s all yours. Mike should be here soon.” Apparently, speaking is easier when he’s not looking at John.
“Don’t be ridiculous, John. I’m over the moon. But I’d prefer not to discuss particularities right now. I really am very tired. Good night.” He nuzzles his nose into John’s hair, sighs deeply and contentedly, and lies still, relaxing gradually. Soon after, his breathing turns deep and regular as he drifts off.
Sherlock heaves a dramatic sigh. “Very well, doctor. But no alcohol for me. I’ll have ginger beer or lemonade.”
Meanwhile, Lestrade has opened a small notebook and has begun to write down what has been said so far. Once again, Sherlock is positively surprised by his efficiency. He decides to strike into the blue, hoping to unsettle Moran even further and gain some insight into his true dealings – and his true loyalties. Recalling his German lessons back at school, Sherlock asks, secretly pleased about his lack of accent,
He drew a shaky breath and fell silent, turning away from John, who felt rather overwhelmed at the confession. He knew that Sherlock’s time abroad had been dangerous and dark and lonely, and for a while a part of himself he wasn’t proud of had thought it just right that the consulting detective had tasted some of his own medicine. But he hadn’t known that Sherlock had missed him and feared for his safety and indeed survival that much.
The first drawing for this chapter is done: "
“Should have known that there’d be no signal around here,” mutters John. Sherlock casts a quick glance at his friend in the passenger seat, his face illuminated from below by the cold glow from his mobile phone. Dusk has fallen. Outside the car windows, dark trees and hedgerows rush past, opening occasionally to allow views of a wintry landscape of meadows dotted with ghostly grey sheep, hedges and copses of woodland interspersed with lights glinting in houses and small villages, the occasional brightly lit Christmas tree next to a solitary farm, and the dark hills of the Brecon Beacons half-shrouded in cloud with here and there patches of snow remaining. The heavy rains of the past days have stopped for now, having eaten away what there was in terms of snow in most places – and probably destroying most traces of the ... occurrences John and Sherlock have been asked to investigate in this remote area between England and Wales. The wind is still strong, though, blowing steadily from the west, chasing clouds and brown leaves across the countryside, tearing off twigs and branches and occasionally even rocking the car with a howling gust.
“Is that Sherlock playing?” An obviously freshly showered Kit has stuck his head out of his room’s door. John almost drops his bag in shock at being addressed. Kit laughs softly. “Oh, sorry, John. Didn’t mean to spook you. But that’s some beautiful music, don’t you think?”
John grinned. “No, but I see what you mean. They had different kinds of Toblerone, so I bought one of each: normal, white and dark. Actually, I don’t think I ever tasted it. Is it good?”
The next morning, John wakes and finds himself alone in bed. It’s still early, only a little past seven, but already quite warm. Birdsong issues through the open window. Sherlock’s spot in their bed is still warm, he can’t have been gone for long. Presently, John hears the toilet flush in the ensuite. Sherlock steps out, drying his hands on his t-shirt. John smiles at him.
“Isn’t that a common ailment with horses?” asked Sherlock.
“So, those things you say you can do ...,”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Because they enjoy it. It
“How long have you been standing there?” she asks, shrugging off John’s jacket.
John leans close and gazes at his handwriting. “Hm, yes. There, I even wrote it down. She must have said it, then.” He looks at Sherlock. “Oh, I see. Moran was wounded at Dunkirk. He could have other injuries, of course, ones you can’t see so easily, and could have been referring to those. But isn’t his father dead, and has been for some time? Are these seats hereditary?”
Sherlock grinned at him, clapping his hands together. “I know. It’s Christmas, isn’t it? But don’t fret, Lestrade. With a little luck, I can solve it before Father Christmas makes his rounds tonight, so you won’t miss any festivities.”
“Oh, nothing. It’s just that you seemed very focused on The Woman. It’s a true marvel that you managed to pay attention to anything else in the room. Or anybody.” He knows he sounds bitter and petty, but he can’t help it. He kicks away an apple for good measure before he steals another glance at John who sits watching him quietly, a faint smile playing around the corners of his mouth and crinkling the skin at his eyes. Sherlock glowers. Why on earth is he smiling?
“Yeah, you can tell them. And nice of you to chase me up and down those bloody stairs trying to find a working key. Couldn’t you have picked the lock before my second excursion?”
“Lovely chap,” comments John, grinning. “Have you tried to blow up your place with one of your experiments, or why is he so ill disposed towards you?”
Sherlock rolls his eyes, nodding towards the panel where the number of their floor is already illuminated. “Obviously.”
“I ...,” Sherlock lets out a deep breath. “I don’t know what we are, John. I just told you that I have no experience with relationships, platonic, romantic or sexual or ... however you’d like to define them. I never even expected to have friends. So I’m ill equipped to label whatever exists between us. I only know that you are the most important person in the world for me, and that I want you to stay at Baker Street and share the work and ... well, everything, really.”
“I didn’t know you were interested in modern art,” Sherlock’s voice came from behind him.
“About five.”
“You little freak,” Daniel spits at him hotly. “You’re such a wanker.”
Sherlock doesn’t wait for the torch to be turned up the corridor. He grips the handrail and pulls himself onto the stairs. They’re altogether dark, but he doesn’t care. Up, up, up. There is only one way now. Running as fast as he can and trying to block out the heavy footfall and angry voices behind him, accompanied by a flickering, searching beam of light, he sprints upwards until he feels as if both his head and his lungs are bursting.
“We saw the videos,” says Ricoletti darkly. “But we don’t know what made him do it. Marco didn’t want to talk about it. He seemed very unhappy about the whole thing. And
Sherlock casts down his eyes. “It was the only time I actually took anything, though. I swear, John. And it was for the case. I needed to be utterly convincing.”
“Perhaps.”
As usual, Sherlock left it to him to get their luggage onto the train – quite a challenge with the two bike-bags. Busy as he was, John did not catch all of the conversation, but apparently Lestrade had made some progress with finding out more about the dead woman’s identity. Sherlock was excited, listening raptly for long spells after he had settled into a seat, only to leap up again and start pacing the corridor when it was his turn to speak. Twice the connection failed, and Sherlock huffed and snorted and rolled his eyes, cursing French phone providers and their general lack of transmission masts.
Team Speedy’s arrive early in the picturesque town of Semur which is dominated by the gothic collegiate church Notre-Dame, mostly intact ramparts and city wall, and a citadel with four round, red-roofed towers. The peloton is set to depart on the large square in front of the impressive western portal of the church. To reach the old part of the town, their coach crosses the Pont de Joly, a large bridge that grands a spectacular view of the town’s most striking features. Several of the riders get up to take photos out of the windows. John stays seated. He thinks he has been here before, but he’d have to look up old Tour de France itineraries to make sure. The many French towns and cities he has been to over the years tend to blend into each other in his recollections, some particularly memorable places aside.
Finally, he hears the front door close, followed by slow, weary steps on the stairs.
Lestrade nods. “The evidence, I see. Well, I hope you are keeping good track of
“And yet you stayed. It doesn’t matter. I hope the meeting will be short.”
“Cake isn’t proper food, despite these containing pumpkin,” John informed him. “I’ll cook something, okay. The thing with peas? And some fish and chips?”
“None that we could find.”

John bursts out laughing and can’t seem to be able to contain himself, almost doubling over as he bites into his hand to stifle his giggles. Sherlock watches him until, he, too, feels compelled to join in.
. Her bed is covered with a patchwork throw, there is a makeshift wardrobe in the corner behind the door, curtained with a plain sheet of bleached canvas. Next to the bed and in front of the window is a desk which has been converted into a dressing table with a mirror and a large assortment of make-up tins and perfume bottles. A washing bowl and a pitcher with water stand there also. On a shelf fastened to the wall opposite the bed Sherlock spots an assortment of children’s toys, old bears and dolls made of cloth, as well as a few puzzles, picture books and sticker albums. One shelf has been emptied to house Jenny’s collection of hats. On a chest of drawers to the right side of the door Sherlock sees a stack of newspapers and magazines, as well as assorted other papers. Three handbags stand there, too. The wallpaper next to the bed has been partly covered with images like a scrapbook. There is a London tube map with a few stations marked with pencil, several postcards from destinations all over England and one from Paris, some nauseatingly sentimental images of couples kissing or doing other couply things, the odd picture of a small dog, kitten or fluffy duckling, an arrangement of pressed violets attached to a card, and a large assortment of stylish photographs, small posters or leaflets of musicians and what appear to be actors clipped from newspapers or collected at cinemas.
“Well, mate, now you do, because I’m not sleeping with Anderson. You can have this bed.”
video game. Their running comments and the reactions of their viewers are very ... interesting.”
John runs a shaking hand over his eyes.
“I know how to look after myself,” declared Sherlock haughtily. “I wouldn’t be here otherwise. And so does John. And of course we’re under constant surveillance by you and your minions.”
At length, Sherlock cleared his throat. “I apologise.” John knew it wasn’t just for his little scene about the perfume.
Sherlock freezes and listens carefully. Three knocks, not very strong. Lestrade always knocks twice, two quick raps. Billy Wiggins and other members of Sherlock’s network of informants have a special signal. Sherlock’s heart begins to beat faster. Curiosity floods him. A stranger then. But who would come at this time of day? The blackout curtains are not yet drawn, and Sherlock hasn’t switched on any lights, meaning his flat must look dark and empty from the street. Mrs. Hudson’s flat is dark, too, and the café is closed with a sign stating when it will open again in the new year. Is it one of the neighbours, looking for Mrs. Hudson, intending to bring over Christmas gifts? Has Mycroft sent his minions a day early?
Mummy’s old friend Dr. Barbara Rawlings, a former lecturer of mathematics at Cardiff University, runs a bookshop and small publishing house in Hay and is involved in the organisation of Hay Festival as well as a number of local charities. She is a large woman dressed in colourful scarves and sustainable hemp garments, her short, originally white hair dyed bright ginger with Henna, the faint smell of stable clinging to her indicating that she dabbles in animal husbandry (
Taking a deep breath, Sherlock asks the question which has been weighing on his heart. “How long until they send you back to sea?”
Once again thank you to all the faithful readers of this story and your kudos, comments and encouragement, and to my wonderful beta rifleman_s and translator Lesli_rus – and last but not least to Ariane_deVere whose brilliant Sherlock transcripts helped a lot.
“Finally,” he grouses. Picking up a few things from the floor he brushes past her and strides into the room. He is wearing today’s new yellow jersey and is carrying a tote bag with his helmet, gloves and what looks like several water bottles. A bouquet of sunflowers and another stuffed lion are under each of his arms. He deposits everything on the bed not occupied by John and Sarah’s equipment. Before even taking in the rest of the room, his eyes flit to John, whom he studies with a long, keen gaze. John gets the distinct impression of being x-rayed.
The motorcyclist shrugs and begins to talk to someone on radio. “
John cuffs him amicably. “True, I’m not. Guess your true prince was that toad you pickled and keep in my room.”
“And I’m rather convinced so did he. We never raised the subject again when we met, never talked about it. But evidence suggests he was in love with me, had been for some time. And I think he felt ashamed of it, like I did. Not that he felt drawn to me in particular, rather because I was a man. His family are very ... conservative, quite religious, too. Even though James never seemed to care much about religion, I don’t doubt that he worried about these things, a lot, in fact. Perhaps this contributed to his depressed state after the War. I don’t know. He never got married, though, and to my knowledge never had a partner or lover after the War, either male or female.”
“Would that be so bad?”
“Night, John.”
“Don’t,” he added sincerely. “He really thinks very highly of you even if he can’t express it properly, and it’s well justified.”
Sherlock snorts. “I wouldn’t call myself ‘interested’, but some things I find useful to retain. Moreover, in order to correspond with my brother whose entire life comprises of politics, I find it helpful to at least have a general idea of historical and current developments.”
John swallows. “I haven’t yet. Been busy cycling and all that.”
John huffs again. “Because we’re here, and neither of us is tired enough for sleep yet. Because it’s a fine night, and there’s good music playing, and I feel like dancing and Hattie’s a bit too small for it, and you’re here, and because I have it on good authority that you secretly enjoy it even though you try to keep it hushed up, and that moreover you’re good at it. Up, now, Mr. Holmes, and give me your bloody hands.”
“Lestrade is on his way to Tate Modern to investigate after the whereabouts of the bag – again,” announced Sherlock. “He sent Donovan and some of the forensics team – lead, thankfully, not by Anderson but Vathijanathar – to the victim’s accommodation. They’ve located the friend. Apparently she is returning to London from Tavistock and expected to arrive later today.”
“Into the river, if they were smart,” offered John.
“Victor told me he’s got something on Moriarty,” offers John.
He looked done in, drenched and muddy, pale despite his flushed cheeks, drawn and gaunt-faced, his nose red and his wet hair flattened to his skull. John didn’t ask him whether he was all right, because it was plain to see that he wasn’t. But at least he didn’t seem to be physically hurt.
“Again, why? It has nothing to do with you.”
“I see. So ... if I understand this correctly, up there in the speech bubble next to the little Sherlock are the tools required for the ... construction. Or deconstruction, rather. Because – and please don’t be shocked now – I’d really like to take you apart eventually. Switch off your brilliant brain for a bit and make you just feel.” Sherlock twitches at this and shifts where he sits, swallowing hard.
“Do with this what you want. You can call Robert, tell him what I just told you. He’ll be delighted. He has been spying on me for some time. I don’t know who he is working for. Honestly, it seems to me that one branch of British Intelligence doesn’t know what the others are doing. So many agents wasted on Moran and myself .... Anyway, you can even inform the police, call in the dishy Detective Inspector from Scotland Yard. Perhaps that’d be for the best. I’m tired.”
“Yes, but you often get situations during a stage where bikes are exchanged. A flat tyre or another defect, a crash. And if you have enough people on the ground to quickly switch a bicycle ... A rider notices a “defect”, stops, helpful bystanders hold on to the bike, there is a bit of a wait until the team car arrives with a spare ... Many of the bystanders have bikes with them. Who’d notice if one of theirs got loaded onto the car instead of the rider’s original one, if they looked identical?”
John nuzzles his neck. “Thank you, love.”
The door swings open, causing both men to turn in surprise. Sherlock is standing outside, bag slung over his shoulder, his violin-case in one hand and an iPhone charger in the other. “Lestrade, I fear we have to switch rooms yet again, if you don’t mind. Apologies for the confusion.”
“As I’ve told you before, you flatlined after they’d removed the bullet. And unlike those two times in the ambulances, it was almost terminal. You’d lost so much blood, most of it internally. By the time they’d got the haemorrhaging under control, you were tachycardic. They tried to shock your heart back into a sinus rhythm, repeatedly, but nothing worked. Eventually, you went into asystole. I know the surgeon who operated on you, back from my days at Uni. We’d been in some classes together. He later told me he’d already put down your time of death. And then, suddenly, your heart started beating again. He’d never seen anything like it, although medically, it is possible. In some rare cases, in can happen when the heart fills with blood again and kinda restarts itself. I read up on it. Anyway, however you managed it, you came back.”
Of a sudden, Sherlock looked immeasurably sad, almost revolted at himself. “I should have known better, of course,” he said quietly. “It’s not like I hadn’t been in virtually the exact situation before, and had messed up then, too. Isn’t there this saying that those unable to learn from history are doomed to repeat it? Well, that’s what happened. Victor didn’t rage at me or anything, he just told me very quietly to leave. I did, and that was the last time I saw him. He didn’t return to university the following term. I later learned he had moved to India, is now owner of an organic tea company and married to an Indian eco-activist.”
often believe you are, wrongly believe, I might add. He only calls you that because he secretly envies you for your intellect and the fact you don’t give a shit about what people think of you. I believe deep down, he’d like to be more like you. Everything about him is so ordinary and predictable. Even I would have been able to tell about the secretary. I mean, seriously. He’s a walking cliché, Mr. Warrington. You aren’t. You’re different. Special. Quite extraordinary, really. And you are cherished. You have friends, you have family who love you. And I know for a fact that you care about them in return. Even your brother. A bit. Don’t let your arsehole of a cousin get to you, okay? He’s a bloody looser.”
And what was more, John seemed grateful for his presence. In this moment, so important for John, he was relieved to have his best friend at his side. He raised his eyes from his daughter’s face and gazed at Sherlock, his expression full of wonder. Sherlock knew that the vow he had made at the wedding to always protect all three of them truly extended to the little one (although Mary’s status had become a bit more questionable). John smiled at him, beckoning him closer. Sherlock advanced, his heart pounding when John indicated he should hold out his arms. He did, hesitantly, anxious about what was to come. After all, who in their right mind would entrust Sherlock Holmes, self-proclaimed high-functioning sociopath, with a newborn? Well, John Watson, apparently.
A big thank you goes again to all who’ve been patiently following this story, and for your comments, kudos and kind words. I hope this story with its descriptions of various places in France serves as a distraction during a time in which neither of us can travel abroad. A particular thank you goes once more to my brilliant beta rifleman_s.
“You’re babbling again.”
Incidentally, John ends up standing next to Sherlock. As before, Sherlock ignores him, finishes quickly and mounts his bike again. John notices that he doesn’t have any water bottles left. Apparently he’s really learned yesterday’s lesson and is taking hydration more seriously now – as he should. It’s another dry, hot day today. Even though Sherlock could easily fall back and get himself new bottles from one of the team’s cars, John knows that one of his jobs is to provide a teammate placed so well in the GC with what they lack, be it food or drink, himself as a wind block to draft behind, or, in an emergency, his bike in exchange for his flat or damaged one. John’s still got two spare bottles stuffed into the back pockets of his jersey.
And as before, Molly casts down her eyes, shrugs a little. “It wasn’t working for me.”
“You mean that basically you haven’t heard from him for almost thirty years because neither of you ever made an effort to get back in touch?” asked John incredulously.
“Well, I’d choose another term, but yeah, it could be worse. At least we’re intact and functional. Jesus, that bloke with the stab wound I treated ... now it makes sense. He was already dead, that’s why I could see him, and he me. And Mrs. Merryweather had been suffering from terminal cancer. She must have died, too, and come afterwards for her regular appointment because she didn’t notice. And old Mr. Cleaver ... he was 93. I guess he passed in his sleep and came over for his weekly check-up (but mostly chat) like he always did. And the new receptionist … probably a ghost, then, too.”
“All right.”
“I don’t remember clearly. Just warmth and ... friction. Things that felt good.”
“Sherlock, are you doing anything important at the moment?” John lowers the Patrick O’Brian novel he’s been trying to read ever since they were forced into self-quarantine a week ago due to a suspected Corona-infection at his surgery.
John laughs. “None taken. The appeal of chocolate is completely understandable. Personally, I’d love some bananas and other exotic fruit, and I’d die for a steak. Haven’t had one of those since the war started.”
“I’ll get Sarah,” mutters Sherlock, still standing closer to John than strictly necessary, not meeting his eyes.
Sherlock’s bright expression darkens. “I don’t have a
Her shoulders droop as she sighs. For the first time, the gun wavers. At Sherlock’s side, John twitches, but Sherlock half raises a hand to check him.
“He told me to have another look at your bike for today, something about the saddle and the aerobars.”
Sherlock sits up as well. “No, I don’t
Sherlock frowned. “What’s wrong with my chin?”
“I wasn’t. Grammar was correct. Second week of August, four days and three nights in Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne in the French Alps.”
“Or what?” challenged John, his grin broadening to a mischievous smirk. “Billy.”
They end up kissing gently and unhurriedly for a good while until John disentangles himself with a groan and indicates he needs the toilet. Since breakfast is set for 7:30 with the transfer to Cognac leaving at 9, they get ready soon after.
