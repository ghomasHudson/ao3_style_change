“Always tends to be one of the syrup drinks too,” Kali said. “Which makes the floor sticky.”
“No thanks,” Dean said.
“He’s just socially constipated,” Kali said.
“No,” Castiel said. “My father has had lovers over the years but none of them ever took on the role as a parent.”
“What question?”
Dean slowly shook his head. “No, sadly not.”
It was getting late by the time C asked him a question that let Dean know there was some serious talk ahead of them again.
“Yeah, that one. Ohh, and Uncle Gabe promised me –”
Of course, Dean would stop the second Cas indicated he didn’t want the same but so far, there was no sign of that.
“Yeah,” Dean replied, ears burning up. Not really a topic he’d wanted to discuss with his kid. At least not at such a young age.
Yeah, that was probably it.
“Then how come none of my other teachers has made the connection?”
A door down the hallway opened and Dean’s eyes went wide, a pleading look directed at his friends. They both nodded just before Gracie entered the room. Contrary to any regular Saturday, she was wide awake. “
“This is marvelous.”
Cas looked confused by his statement.
Cas’ harsh breathing filled the room, the man sprawled on his bed, looking divine and utterly blissed out. Grinning, Dean kissed a path up his body – avoiding the mess on Cas’ stomach – taking some extra time when he reached his neck, and finally caught his lips in a lazy kiss.

“You look gorgeous, pumpkin. Though you always do, in my opinion.”
Like a horde of hungry wolves, everyone reached for the plates as Amara put them down on the table. Everyone except for Dean and Cas, because Gracie had stepped right up to them, offering her own plate. Disentangling their hands from beneath the blankets, they both took one of the sugary treats and Dean’s heart warmed when he saw a big smile light up Gracie’s whole face even further, her eyes solely on Cas. He watched his daughter watch Cas and Dean could see just how much she was waiting for his approval once more. Instead of eating his own cookie, Dean watched his boyfriend as well.
Cas sighed as he dropped his pen. Reading that his soulmate had been with someone else… it hurt. It truly did, though he knew it hadn’t happened out of malice. To be quite honest, he had long realized that he had feelings for D beyond the normal soulmate connection. It might be the demisexual side in him, but all the writing with D… yes, he knew he had fallen for his soulmate, deeper and more thorough than he had ever heard from any of his friends or family about their experiences with their own soulmates.
For what it was worth, Dean was sure now that he was not into men. Not in general, at least. He could appreciate them and… yeah, seeing them naked was surely not a turn-off.
He was out of his line of sight too quick for Dean to really take him in fully, and all Dean really noticed during these few seconds was the stoic face Cas was keeping the whole way.
Closing his eyes for a second, Dean drew a deep breath before replying.
“I know. I know, Daddy,” she interrupted him, hugging him even closer.
When he was satisfied with his work, he nuzzled into the crook of Cas’ neck, giving up his attempts at staying hovered over Cas. He had no desire yet to move away from him and Cas didn’t seem all that eager either.
” she chirped, having all of them chuckle as they ended the call.
(See the end of the chapter for
But then there was Cas and… and there was no denying that he had found a way to soothe something in that girl. If Dean had to guess, he was sure that the man himself wouldn’t even have noticed. Couldn’t, really, for he had never known Gracie
Which made it all the more surprising for him to hear that C was now ditching classes – to go shopping, of all things!
Seeing the insecurity in Cas’ eyes though, Dean threw all these bad ideas to the wind, sighing over his own stupidity. This was a talk that should have happened long before they made it this far and it might have if Dean had only tried harder. Or if he would have had his shit together sooner. As it was, they at least had to discuss some of those things now or neither of them would be able to fully enjoy what they were both so clearly looking forward to.
And, okay, maybe the fact that they were about to have an epic romcom movie moment.
Of course he knew when they were standing in front of Cas and Grace’s, hardly able to keep from smiling. What a wonderful lumberjack, even better than the one Gracie and he had planned during practice. He was wondering how much of this had been Cas’ influence while Miss Patty already raved over the little details. Like the beard or the little twigs sticking out of the beanie like strands of hair. It quickly got a ten from all of them, and Dean was glad he didn't have to defend giving his daughter’s snowman the highest points.
He liked Michael and Gabe’s Fallen Angel as well, even though he was pretty sure it hadn’t been their original plan. Not that he would ever know for sure – the three of them might be friends, but when it came to things like these contests, their friendship ended, the design of their snowman a well kept secret. But he knew his friends well enough and if he had to guess, he would have bet that they’d tried to build a real angel. Not one with broken wings, but oh well.
Besides
It was like watching an accident about to happen. Knowing the cars would crash into each other but not able to stop it. Knowing the glass would drop to the flour, shatter into a million pieces, but not able to catch it in time.
“Grace, it’s not that easy,” he finally tried, but he could tell that his daughter wouldn’t accept that.
“Alright. Guess I’ll see you then.”
He thought about opening his mouth then, thought about actually taking Cas in, of actually weighing his heavy cock on his tongue… but somehow, he couldn’t. This was all still so new to him and aside from the thought of, ‘what if I don’t like it? What would that do to us?’ there was also that little voice wondering, ‘what if I’m bad at it and Cas will regret all this?’ Neither was rational, he knew that. His willingness to give blowjobs wouldn’t determine their whole relationship, of course. But the nagging doubt was still there, so instead of going all in, Dean stuck to carefully exploring Cas’ cock for now, before eventually making his way back up. Kissing all over Cas’ stomach, nipping at each bump of his ribs, sucking in one nipple, leaving small kisses all over his collarbone and neck until he reached Cas’ lips again, where Cas kissed him back eagerly.
“You loved him even back then, didn’t you?”
A soft smile tugged on Cas’ lips. “So…
He was tempted to clasp his hands over his ears at the screeching and squealing that came through the speakers. Instead, he laughed at the joy as he watched Charlie and Jo celebrating, basking in the love and enthusiasm his friends had for him.
They didn’t get far though, their stomachs soon rumbling, reminding them that they both had barely eaten anything yesterday aside from their pizzas. Trying to ignore it for a little while, they soon couldn’t help but chuckle every time it happened, finally deciding to eat first and then get back to bed right away.
10 (last section)
Dean was sure he had blatantly been staring at the man for countless minutes until finally, the meaning of his words sank in. He tried to push down any hope flaring in his chest - this was a step forward again, right? - but couldn’t help the smile slowly forming on his lips. Maybe Cas was taken and maybe this would never lead to what Dean was hoping for. But maybe, just maybe, it could lead to the second-best thing: Cas’ friendship.
Andrew seemed to feel awkward about the whole situation, but still stumbled out what he wanted to say. “It’s just… well, compared to the past two weeks… you, ehm, seem…
“Oh, Dean,” she said, adding a big squeeze to their hug. “It’s so good to see you, darling.”
He stepped next to Cherry in such a way that Cas would simply have to throw his leg over her neck and Dean would be able to push him up the rest of the way.
“– and have a nice Christmas party tomorrow, all of you.”
“What did I do?”
“But I have my sleeping bag and all the straw. And you know it’s warm here.”
“Wha- what? No, I- no, what?”
“About Cas?” Dean prompted, still staying serious.
Well, not a lie, technically.
“Dean, wait,” he breathed out, putting some space between their lips. He didn’t go far, but still too far for Dean’s taste. “Hang on, wait a minute.”
The fact that he hadn’t even bothered to greet Dean was like a bucket of ice water over the budding hope of maybe amending his mistakes tonight.
“That doesn’t make sense,” Michael said, more to himself than Dean, quite obviously racking his brain for something. “He never said anything… no, we would’ve known.”
His gaze wandered back to Cas’ eyes, asking -
journey with Lumberjack Cookies will finally come to an end this Sunday... I kinda wanna use a crying emoji but also a laughing one and maybe a somewhat crazed-out one... I'm not sure yet which one it will be on Sunday 😂 guess we'll find out. Until then, take a breath, eat a cookie, and maybe come find me on
Back then…
Michael’s comment had sounded so innocent, and looking back, Dean was pretty sure he’d been able to sound convincing when he’d thanked his friend and then played it all down. Actually, there hadn’t really been anything to play down. At that moment, it really had been alright.
- it was one of the first survival tactics every successful teacher had to learn.
Dean let the words sink in, trying to sort out his emotions. But it wasn’t all that easy and inside of him, there was a little war going on between his emotional side that wanted to be jealous; and his rational side that told him not to be a hypocrite.
Yes! Yes, smooth question, very good!
Which obviously he
“Well, it’s your turn.”
“You have no idea how much I want this,” Cas told him and
Rolling his eyes, Dean pulled his daughter close for a quick kiss on her forehead.
; a huge step in his eyes. Monday had Cas smiling at him freely - only to be hurt so badly in an accident the next day that despite Cas’ insistence to the contrary, Dean still felt at fault. He had scared the man or just distracted him - either way; Dean was the reason Cas had tumbled down that hill.
“Does our family have a secret cookie recipe as well?”
Grace’s confused question actually stung, making Dean realize what kind of picture she must have simply based on their rather cold and rare interaction.
While Cas kept babbling slurred nonsense, Dean took a moment to let the feeling of a cock in his mouth sink in. Really sink in. Cas’ reaction was amazing – but how did it feel for him?
It got harder not to outright grin at the whole interaction.
it and even
of all days.
“Maybe it won’t be the best for you to meet him with everybody around. Go to him now. I know you want to talk to him without getting interrupted.”
A small noise came from his left, nothing more than a grunt, someone clearly in pain. It was enough for Dean to zero in on that place. And thank
God, Dean could hardly wait to feel this hand everywhere on his body.
Right away, Dean snapped out of it and averted his eyes, looking back down at his notes. He could feel the heat creeping up his neck and into his cheeks; Charlie’s chuckle certainly didn’t make it any better.
and it is so, so amazing! Thank you once again 😘
“Ohhh, right, the Christmas Cookie Fundraiser,” she exclaimed and Dean seized the moment, taking a fork and stealing a piece of the pie in front of his girl as he answered her.
As Dean looked up, already chuckling, Gabe was rubbing his hands, looking gleefully around the display. Wiggling inquisitive fingers and making grabby hands, he picked up the first bag and looked at it.
“Lydia?” he inquired, unsure why Cas would even care.
He also still hadn’t found a way to stop his heart from hurting whenever he passed the crossroads that would lead him back home without a single sign of the man.
Basking in the feeling of the moment, Dean began to softly sway them while he thought this through. When Gabe already called out that it was close, Dean was struck by an idea, the smile forming on his lips inevitable. “I know, how about this,” he murmured into Cas’ ear. “You’re not allowed to leave Stars Hollow until you find a better author than Vonnegut. No running away from me ever again.”
“It doesn’t matter, because I am not going to pull him away from his life in New York. As far as I know, he has a boyfriend now, so no need to ever talk about this.”
Dean had to chuckle at that, moaning softly as Cas began to nip and suck and lick along his collarbone and up to his neck. “Oh yeah, because making pancakes takes up such a huge amount of time.”
The dreams that had gotten somewhat steamy two nights ago. Not really, of course, but … had that been a start?
On the other hand, he did understand his daughter’s sentiments when it came to Lydia.
to let me know what else you would like to see in the Angel Cookies verse. I already got so many nice prompts and I can't wait to work on them 😍
That would be such a novel concept for him…
Gasping in surprise, Claire went silent and looked at Dean, ignoring some of the quickly stifled laughter of her classmates. Before he could say anything, she had found her voice again, picked up the cap, and chucked it back at him.
For whatever reason, Cas broke into hysterical laughter, stumbling even further. Dean followed, always staying close enough to reach him should Cas really fall. By now, they’d made it to the side of the barn, which lay more protected from the snowy storm.
Halting for just a moment, Dean nodded. “Of course. As long as you know you always have people around you who are here to help you, I’m happy.”
“Sorry, that really was my fault. I should’ve watched where I was going.”
“He’s just a friend.”
Or drown.
, they were standing so close and he couldn’t listen any longer when Cas blamed him for playing with his feelings and all of a sudden, Dean surged forward, only enough presence of mind to catch their crash into the wooden wall of the barn so he wouldn’t crush Cas.
But Cas?
Cas was really here, he was safe, he was in Dean’s arms, he had kissed him back, and God damnit, why did Dean have to be a responsible adult? Carefully, not wanting to startle the wonderful man in his arms, Dean leaned his forehead against Cas’, hand still cradling his face.
about the mistletoe!”
“Yes, I’m here,” he vaguely heard his daughter reply. “Dad! Guess where Castiel works.”
Chuckling, Dean shook his head. “Get out of here, before I give you those twenty questions after all,” he replied in good humor, happy to see that Andrew’s smile only grew bigger while he waved at Dean and finally left the room.
Once the barn door closed, the begging Dean had been waiting for all night finally began.
“Well,” Claire finally began. He should have known she would be the first to man up. “You see, Mr. Winchester... we. Well, we...”
Shrugging her shoulder and sniffing, Gracie didn’t reply, apparently deep in thought. He hated this. Hated not being able to take away her pain.
“Merry Christmas, jerk,” Sam replied with a grin while Eileen simply rolled her eyes with a fond smile on her lips, standing up on tiptoes to press a kiss to his cheek.
On the other side, Sam chuckled. “Seems like it. He even packed a bag.”
“Come on, Dean. Just because you wouldn’t admit to them back then or might not have been able to name them, the feelings for Cas were already there. Are you really going to deny it?”
Her only reply was a sniffle.
Dean could hardly sign quick enough to show how enraged he was. Why on earth? He had confided in his best friends, had trusted them –
Not to speak of how hurt he would be about being the talk of the town again should this get out. Just the other day, he had told him about how embarrassed he had been all these years ago. Had tried to leave once already because of the
“What about me, ya idjit,” he grumbled out, making them all chuckle.
Gracie was sitting at the kitchen island, a plate full of pancakes in front of her, a mug of hot chocolate – based off her chocolate mustache – in her hand, which appeared to be forgotten as Gracie babbled on quite happily, her story making Cas smile.
your- um...
“Hey, Max, it’s alright,” Dean interrupted. “Honestly, don’t sweat it. This is not official school business, it’s a fundraiser. And your classmates will understand. They had it handled.” He watched as Max’ shoulders sagged in relief, some of the tension he always seemed to carry leaving him.
from him - there was something seriously wrong with their relationship and Dean would feel like he had failed as a father.
to feel shitty because it was just the friendship that connected him to Cas. He convinced himself of all those lies without ever really thinking about any of it. It had been like a coping mechanism. Something he had no need to actually think about
“You mean as in–”
“I know, Gracie. I know.” Pulling his pouting daughter close to him, he hugged her to his side. “I’m sorry. We’ll do it next year, okay?”
And Dean was absolutely on board with that. Less talking,
Dean looked closer now, knowing that while the form was easily made with a mold, Gracie still had to color it all by herself. The dragon he held was different shades of green, every scale painted individually. His daughter had clearly put a lot of time into this.
Always a welcome part of it all – and still, there had always been that tiny fragment of his mind that felt separate. Now though, for the first time, he finally, and truly,
love Lisa and it's a topic of the conversation towards the end. If you don't like it, I understand - but please don't bash on her character or Dean's feelings for her. After all, she was a huge part of his life and she is still Gracie's mom 💚
No, but he knew his family well enough to know they would only keep poking and prodding until they got what they wanted. This way he hoped to appease them - give them a bit of insight but then also make sure they knew that there was no prospect of anything coming from it. Maybe, if he added a little, ‘it hurts to think about it, so please leave it be,’ it would even shut them up about that topic for good.
Although, it turned out he hadn’t taken into account his very own students.
had feelings for you. But -”
“Right,” Dean relented, letting the topic of love confessions slide. “Who was it that used to call you Clarence?”
All of a sudden, Dean became incredibly aware of just how close he was standing to Cas - had he been leaning in towards him? Had he
That something was what made Dean get up after all, ready to take Cherry out for an earlier ride than usual. True, yesterday he had thought about not crowding Cas and not coming off as a weird stalker… but he
Letting his fingers brush slowly over Cas’ name, Dean read the quote he had picked to go with his picture for maybe the hundreds time.
“I better take this.”
Well, Cas had told him, hadn’t he? Explained that what Dean had done to him ruined a once beloved family legend. How it turned into such a bad memory he wasn’t even able to eat those cookies anymore without thinking of that terrible moment.
“This is the first time he’s been back in a while, isn’t it?” Harry added before Dean had a chance to answer Alice.
Throwing a sideways glance at Sam, they both barely hid their snickers. Everybody knew how much Taylor annoyed Luke Danes with everything he did. It was always fun to see how long it took before Luke exploded. And just like always, Taylor ignored the man and all the rest of them and went right on. Groaning for real, Dean settled back in his chair, trying not to fall asleep until Gracie would enter the stage. That was until he saw the little red light on Sam’s fancy camera blink.
“We don’t torture,” Hannah said.
Castiel looked him over. “And for what purpose am I alive? Apart from your frequent sexual assaults.”
“Newish,” Dean said. “Been here a few months now.”
“We’re glad Castiel is getting out of the house,” Kali said. “He spends too much time alone.”
“You don’t have to clean up straight away you know,” Dean chastised him.
“Sated at the moment,” Dean said. “But it keeps coming back.”
“It would be mutually beneficial,” Crowley said. “You’d have my protection; you’d have my ear.”
“Wait, they give you keys?” Dean said as Castiel unlocked the door.
“There’s a local candy wholesaler?” Dean asked.
“Thank you,” he said, letting out the breath that he had been holding.
Dean’s eyes widened. “The guy who wrote the horror books?”
Gabriel smirked. “Kali actually enjoys it when he comes in.”
“No. No, that’s very right,” Dean said. “And kind of hot.”
“Is Castiel easy to work with?” Dean asked.
“Because we’re truemates,” Castiel guessed. “That’s not very demon of you.”
“No,” Castiel said. “I learnt that from Google.”
Dean scowled. He hadn’t even thought about his dad. He wasn’t even sure where his dad and little brother were. All he knew was his dad had been pissed at him for taking up Bobby’s offer to join him as a mechanic at the workshop and scrapyard. “Yeah, I guess I better. Maybe I’ll just send him a text. I’ll shoot Sam an email while I’m at it.”
“Yeah. Sure.” Dean raised a brow. “Because going to college isn’t what your family wants.”
“Noted,” Dean said, taking the syringe. “Ignored.”
The two angels behind her flicked their wrists, their angel blades dropping into their hands. Dean rolled his eyes. He pulled the First Blade from his belt, absently tapping Castiel’s angel blade with his other hand. He saw Hannah spot it, a question in her eyes.
“Okay, point taken,” Dean said.
“We all have our days,” she said. “Would you believe when I first started I used to wear heels.”
“Castiel,” she said as she stopped before him. “You have your grace.”
“News flash, you’re not better than me,” Dean said. “Who was it that set the Leviathans free again?”
“Okay,” Sam said, licking his lips and trying to catch up with everything in his mind. “So what do you need me for?”
“Could always find out,” Dean purred. “Just let me go, Sammy. I’ll leave you alone. Let me get on with my life.”
“Then why is there only one bed?”
“So the usual then,” Dean pulled on his jacket and picked up his bag, giving the room a once over to make sure he hadn’t forgotten anything. “I’ll meet you at the car.”
Things could be replaced, but demons were harder. Random bodies had started to appear littered around Hell. Most of them were alphas Crowley noted, and when alphas died in such numbers it usually meant that either an alpha was making a move to attempt to take the throne, or an omega was on a murder spree. He had a feeling it was the latter.
“No idea,” Bobby said. “Could be anything. Family’s too big. Getting the younger siblings dumped on them. Old man not caring. Could be a long list of reasons.”
-----O-----
“Are you okay?” she asked.
She looked up. “Surrogate uncle?”
“Bacon cheeseburger, thanks,” Dean said. “And I’ll have a coke with that.”
Crowley hung up the phone, Dean giving it a look of displeasure before hanging up. He sighed, reclining back and resting his head against the back of the throne. If there was one thing about Hell it was that it was boring. Dean knew that he could probably go and torture some souls but that really wasn’t his thing. He enjoyed the killing more than anything. The soft sound of his blade slicing into flesh; the metallic smell of the blood. He enjoyed seeing the light fade from the eyes of his victims as he stared them down.
“You really should be moving around.” Crowley frowned. “Dean has a thing or two to learn about keeping prisoners.”
“You do,” Kali said. “But you get used to being in here too.”
“At least we convinced him to stop wearing the suit,” Kali said.
“I did,” Castiel said. “That was very coincidental timing.”
“They don’t talk about him much,” Benny said. “It’s like he doesn’t exist.”
“That must be fun,” Dean said. “Everything you do being made about them.”
Castiel swallowed hard.
They both looked up as Dean moved, slowly waking up. Sam grabbed the holy water flask from the table, unscrewing the lid. Beside him Castiel drew his angel blade at the ready. Dean had tried to escape on them at least two more times in the last few hours, and each time they had increased his bonds. The escapes usually happened right after he awoke so they were ready.
“Thank you,” Castiel added.
Sam lit the match and dropped it into the bowl, reciting the incarnation. They waited for a moment, Sam gazing around and waiting for something, anything, to happen. He could feel his questions bubbling up within his mind as his heart raced. He set his jaw, ready to call defeat.
“I get it, man, I get it.” Dean smiled as he drank from his coffee. “No talking about brothers.”
“You finished?” Dean asked as he sat down.
He’d done it.
“That’s kind of nice of him,” Dean said. “Do any of your other family check in like that?”
“All very good points,” Kali said. “You’ve put some thought into it.”
“Well we’re going to get it first,” Dean said. “No punk ass demon is going to take it away from us.”
“It doesn’t matter,” Castiel said.
“This is it then,” Crowley said, holding it up. “All this for this one little vial.”
“It split if that’s what you mean,” Gabriel said. “And that was a once off thing. I was distracted at the time.”
“That’s right,” Kali said.
“From what I have sensed he would be very angry,” Castiel said. “He might well destroy you.”
“This isn’t you,” Castiel said.
“You’re coming home then?”
“I told him that he needed some real world experience,” Gabriel said. “That he’d been sheltered for too long. So I offered him a job and he took it.”
Sam ignored him, frowning as his nostrils flared. He eyed Dean. “Did you stop taking your suppressants?”
“Sure, Cas. Your body says otherwise.”
“So they’re moving East,” Bobby said after a moment. “He got Sam enrolled in a school yet?”
“Famous last words,” Crowley said. “Feathers is going to be your complete responsibility. Anything happens and it’s your head.”
“He always says family don’t end with blood,” Dean said. “Although he kind of gets annoyed when I call him ‘uncle’.”
“Is that why you’ve got me killing?” Dean asked. “To remind them?”
“Yeah.”
After things calmed down a little and the last customer wandered out the door Kali turned to him. “How are you doing?”
Dean nodded.
“I was wondering who’d take over from Novak,” Benny said.
“Well I say it’s not going to,” Dean said, standing up. “Keep that in mind.”
“That’s alright,” Dean said. “I’ll manage.”
“It’s a good skill to have,” Bobby said. “Remember that.”
“Is he like the youngest or something?”
“Don’t choke on it,” Bobby warned. “I know how fast you eat.”
“Not all jobs need one,” Sam said. “You’re working hard and doing better than Dad ever did.”
“Oh my god,” Dean pulled a face. “Those things are ugly already but in tan?”
“What do you want?’ Castiel asked.
“Figures. So I need to talk to Hannah,” Dean raised a brow. “Pretty sure Cas has her in the contacts of his phone. I’ll have to give her a call.”
“No,” Crowley said. “We only discussed the important matters. Well, the one that’s important to you.”
“I can do that,” Dean said, patting the First Blade. “Do you have a timeline for getting it done?”
“Where are you, Cas?” he asked the air.
“You’re a good kid, Dean,” Gabriel said. “A hard worker. You mean well. But Anna was going to completely destroy you.”
“Dean is not himself,” Castiel said. “When he becomes human he will regret it.”
“A book,” she answered. Her eyes scanned the shelves. “One I have never read.”
“I wish I had your optimism,” Sam said.
After they closed the shop Dean had walked back to the Impala, climbing in and driving back to the workshop. He raised his brows as he saw that light to the shop was still on meaning that someone was working inside. When he’d gone up to the flat he’d found it empty, telling him that it was Bobby who was working late.
“That is my intention, yes,” Castiel said.
“A Nephilim,” Crowley repeated. “I thought they only existed between an angel and a human.”
“You’re not mad, are you?” Castiel asked, breaking the silence.
“People complained about it being too sweet,” Kali said. “It wasn’t a big seller.”
Castiel shook his head.
“I think I’ve already got it out of my system,” Dean said. “Spent my whole life on the road. It’s nice to just settle down.”
“What’d you tell them?”
“Neither do I,” Castiel said. “I think Benny is going to insist.”
“You let your radiator run dry,” Kali said.
“How’d your test go?” Dean asked as he closed the door.
“We need to tell Sam,” Dean said out loud as he finished making the sandwiches.
“Thank you,” she said. She reached out across the table, resting one of her hands on his. “It’s nice to have someone say that.”
“We were worried you’d quit,” Kali said.
By the time knock off time rolled around Dean was exhausted. He was glad when Kali went to the front of the store and locked the door. He pulled off his apron with a sigh, needing to sit down. Kali tutted him and handed him a broom.
“Yeah, Cas said,” Dean said.
“Let him.”
“There was coercion,” Dean admitted.
“We do,” Hannah said. “I was unsure if you had already spoken with Crowley about the new arrangement.”
“You mean where would he hide it?” Castiel thought for a long moment, thinking about what he knew of Metatron. “If I were him I would hide it in a library.”
Sam sat up straighter, hope fluttering in his chest. “He gave you a location?”
Crowley sighed and rubbed his eyes. He really needed a drink. He looked over the remaining demons in front of him and dared one of them to try and step forward with some pointless news. Some demons just liked to be in the throne room for the status and bragging rights of it. And some of those liked to speak up in order to claim they had the ear of the King. He made a decision that the next one who did just that would find themselves served up to the hounds.
“Anyway,” Dean said, closing the newspaper. “Need any help looking at cars this morning? I’ve got some time to kill.”
They kissed for a long while, hands slipping over naked skin. Dean explored every inch of Castiel, mapping out the new territory of his mate. There was no rush, Castiel slowly grinding his hips against Dean’s and dragging their growing erections together. Dean groaned into his mouth, rolling his hips to increase the friction.
“Wow,” Dean said. “Didn’t your dad stop them?”
“If you don’t leave you won’t be,” Dean growled.
“Most of them,” Bobby said. “They don’t want anything to do with her. Scared she’ll start rumours about them being abusive to her if they do.”
“Wow.” Sam shook his head. “Sometimes I think you guys are worse than the demons. At least the demons keep their deals.”
He had settled in and was about halfway through his sandwich when someone slid into the seat across from him. Dean frowned, glancing up and starting as he recognised her: Anna.
Crowley let out a long breath, Castiel almost able to see the cogs turning in his mind. Abruptly Crowley stood, smoothing down his shirt and dusting off his pants. “You realise I’m going to inform Dean of the situation.”
“This afternoon,” Gabriel said. “You’re stuck with me this morning.”
“Not really,” Dean said. “It’s one less angel after my head.”
“So did you work at the shop or…?”
He glanced up as his phone rang, Sam sliding it toward him and glancing at an unfamiliar number. He frowned, picking it up and answering.
“Definitely glad we don’t have carpet,” Dean said.
got too mushy for me.”
“Good argument,” Dean said. “I take it college meets those requirements as well.”
“You have a curfew?” Castiel asked.
Dean nodded, knowing she was right. He finished his lunch and wandered back behind the counter to wait for the next customer. The customers came in at an uneven rate, some stopping to chat to Kali. Dean took notice of how she was no-nonsense and straight to business. There was a fire in her eyes that told Dean that he really didn’t want to mess with her. Not to mention she didn’t seem to miss a thing that was going on.
“I’m sorry,” she said.
He pulled his legs in as the footsteps stopped by the door, the locks grinding as they were opened. He raised his head and gazed toward the doorway. Spotting Crowley he set his jaw. What did he want?
“In time.” Crowley said. “The longer we can delay the inevitable the better.”
“Where is he?” She asked.
“Metatron still hasn’t broken,” Crowley said. “Apparently angels aren’t as effective at torture as you are.”
“That’s actually good advice,” Gabriel said. “Mind you my family’s reach is pretty far.”
“Ran away at 13,” Bobby said. “Moved in with this couple on the other side of town and started calling them ‘mom’ and dad’. Told everyone that Chuck was an abusive father and that her older siblings would beat her. Ended up with CPS involved not that anything came of it.”
“Anyway, you better grab your apron and switch on the open sign,” Kali said.
Dean smirked around his cock, then swallowed around it before pulling back off it at an agonisingly slow pace. He fell into a rhythm, timing the slide of his fingers to that of his mouth and slowly increasing it. Castiel began to gently rock his hips, Dean watching as the muscles rippled beneath his skin. He ran his free hand over Castiel’s abdomen just so he could feel them beneath his fingers.
She shook her head. “Rent’s too high and it doesn’t get the tourists or school traffic. It would also mean moving away from the Sugar Heaven.”
,” Dean said. “Just find Cas’ grace so we can give it to him. That way I won’t need to keep hunting angels for a top up for him.”
“Answer the question,” Sam said. “Is Dean a demon?”
“That’d do it,” Bobby said. He sighed. “Anyway it’s late. We should probably head to bed. I’m guessing you’re tired.”
“And what do you plan on doing with those degrees?” Benny asked.
“I can’t even imagine what that must be like,” Castiel said. “I’ve always had enough money to feed myself. Gabriel taught me how to budget for things. He always said rent first, food second, utilities third.”
“What if I mess up?” Dean asked, nerves slowly creeping in.
“That doesn’t mean you have to keep cleaning the back room, either,” Gabriel said. “We actually have a cleaner that does that every Saturday.”
“Gun,” Dean said. “He had a gun.”
“We are having one problem trying to get payment from someone,” the demon said. “They’ve locked themselves in a warded room. We can’t get to them.”
“Exactly,” Bobby said. “And if you need a part we don’t have talk to me so we can negotiate something.”
“You stole?” Castiel said surprised.
Hannah shot him a sharp look.
“I’ll see you Wednesday,” Castiel said.
“I’m sorry, Sam,” Hannah said. “It’s already been decided.”
Castiel nodded. “I was always top of my class in school. I am hoping to continue the trend.”
“Yes it is.” Crowley gestured for Dean to take his seat beside him. Dean elected to remain standing, stopping in front of the throne. Crowley found. “Something the matter?”
“And Dean?” Sam asked.
Castiel slipped a third finger into him and targeted the spot again, Dean moaning. He kept rolling his hips, reaching down to wrap his hand around his cock and slowly beginning to stroke it. He closed his eyes as he lost himself into the feeling. He could come just from this, he knew that. He sucked on his lower lip as he grew accustomed to Castiel’s fingers. A droplet of precum trickled out of his cock and over his fingers.
He wondered what Dean had planned for him. He swallowed hard, knowing that Dean was a master at torture. Did he intend to torture him? That would explain why Castiel needed to be naked. The room itself looked like it would be the perfect place for torture to take place. It even had the faint smell of old blood to it, but then most of Hell had that smell. It lay just beneath the smell of sulphur and pain.
“He killed our brethren,” Hannah reminded him.
“What they’re doing to her isn’t right,” Dean said. “Can’t they just let it go?”
Hannah and Sam nodded.
Benny left him to his thoughts, Dean slowly eating the last of his burger. He glanced again at the gossiping couple and wondered how word had spread. No doubt he and Anna being seen together at the shopping mall had made it to the grapevine. He let out a long breath as he considered his options. He was supposed to meet up with Anna this coming Saturday. He wondered if maybe this should be the last time.
“View it any way you want, Cas, it doesn’t change the fact it happened,” Dean said. “So live with it.”
“Slowly,” Dean said. “But that’s kind of the point.”
Castiel glared at him.
“Yeah, Cas and Gabe didn’t do that,” Dean said. “They actually serve customers.”
“One more,” Kali said. “Work knockoff time. Then we close up.”
“No,” Dean said. “I just wanted you to mate me.”
He headed for the office of the motel, quickly getting them a room. Key in hand he headed back outside to where Castiel was waiting and led him along the row of doors until he reached theirs. Opening the door he led the way inside, spotting Castiel’s hesitancy. He watched him as he waited for Castiel’s reaction to there only being one bed.
“Well I’m technically not a heterosexual,” Castiel said simply.
“I’m not killing Cas,” Dean said flatly.
It had been nearly two weeks now since he had been cured. Dean’s body was slowly starting to recover from the whole ordeal. The Mark still itched and cried out for blood but he had been resisting the call. It was easier to do that now he was human.
“Castiel,” she answered. She glanced at the clock. “You’re actually on time.”
“That’s right,” Bobby said. “You going to make him the offer are you?”
“Gabriel seems to think it’s lies,” Dean said. “And Kali.”
“None that you can prove,” Castiel said.
“I would like that,” Castiel said with a smile.
Dean looked at Bobby. “Yet you said Castiel could get away with anything.”
“She won’t do it, you know,” Gabriel said. “She’ll stay here.”
Dean nodded. He could see that. “So the sugar shop doing special orders again today?” Dean asked as he began to take the chairs off the tables.
“I thought that would be obvious,” Dean said. He tapped the end of Castiel’s nose with his finger. “Took a little something myself to make things easier.”
Castiel nodded. “Both male and female.”
“Are you prepared?” Castiel asked Sam.
“Apparently he’s not nice to his kids,” Dean said. “Well, some of them he’s nice to, but the rest he’ll throw under a bus.”
Dean didn’t know that. He stared at the man, glancing behind him as he saw someone walk past the front of the store and slow down in the way that meant they were going into the sweet shop. His eyes widened as he spotted the uniform.
Dean raised a brow. “So your dad’s a millionaire but your brother lives in a shit box.”
Kali then got him to wipe down the glass and door while she closed up the till and stored everything in the safe before doing the day’s paperwork. Dean was glad he didn’t have to do that because it looked like a lot of math. Nearly everything seemed to be computerised, but for some reason they had paper records as well. No doubt in case the system crashed.
“I understand,” Castiel said.
“Yeah. I think I was six last time we were there,” Sam said. “Anyway he’s been calling the schools to find somewhere for me, so next week you call we’ll be in Illinois.”
“It will make it hard to hunt if you don’t,” Crowley said. “Speaking of hunting, I have an errand I would like you to run.”
Dean frowned. “What?”
“Like the majority of them did,” Castiel said. “Without the help they would be nothing.”
“Yeah, it is a pretty good setup you have here,” Dean said.
Dean let his eyes wander around the open living room, taking in the high walls and open space, the artful decorations, the soft colors that matched and complemented each other, and the furniture that looked comfortable but stylish enough to belong in the living room of a rich person.
Cas was obviously thrilled about this reaction – well, who wouldn’t be? – and once Gracie let go of him to pick up a box, Cas stayed on the floor, simply leaning on his elbows so he could continue to watch Gracie. Meanwhile, she let out another squeal of excitement and hugged the box close to her chest.
Michael put some more dishes down, right next to the ones Dean had carried, looking at him intently, the earlier carefree demeanor gone.
It was the accident that had finally pushed aside the denial Dean had about his feelings for Cas - only for him to realize that he could never act on them. Cas had a boyfriend and how could he not? He was amazing, with his sharp mind and keen wit, his dry sense of humor and such a big heart. Not to mention that killer smile, those damn blue eyes, and how handsome he was and
“Are you crying?” he asked in shock, unable to put all this together and really starting to get frustrated now with the lack of forthcoming information. “Damn it, Cas, talk to me.”
right now, you know.”
“And I’m sorry, okay?” He should probably stop, he knew it. But he was fed up with this… this
Hauling Cas with him as he got up, he stopped the moment they were in a standing position, giving Cas time to readjust. Time to slow his pained breathing and unclench his teeth.
Well, there was one thing Dean certainly couldn’t deny: the guy obviously made Cas happy - which, of course, was good.
Damn.
! You knew that, didn’t you? You knew and you still kept trying to be near me these past few weeks.”
Neither had Dean and he berated himself for letting Cherry gallop like this when he couldn’t even really see what was in front of him.
their first night together. After all, the way Cas responded to him, the way it had sounded earlier, the way Dean hoped it would be… there would be many nights ahead of them to explore it all.
, Jo,” he greeted them back in what little German he had picked up. Really, having two enthusiastic friends who had wanted to at least
Still, he knew it wasn’t their fault. The whole issue had been there already, the topic steered up the moment Cas had stepped foot into Stars Hollow. Really, if he was honest with himself, it was a miracle the gossip mills here at school hadn’t started flying around once Gracie began having lunch with Cas every day. Or maybe they had and he just hadn’t realized it…
As Castiel had predicted there were more customers around the lunch hour but not enough to be considered a ‘rush’. Dean also noted that many of the customers that came in were holding gift baskets and wrapped boxes branded with the Sugar Heaven logo. There was definitely an overlap between the two stores, and Dean had to commend Gabriel for thinking of that.
“Knowing him it’s full of sugar,” Dean said.
Dean glared up at him for a moment before he flinched, pulling at his bonds. He groaned, grimacing in pain. Castiel stayed ready with the holy water in case he tried anything but instead Dean seemed to be fighting with something inside himself.
Castiel growled again, baring his teeth. Dean chuckled.
“Hey Cas,” Dean said. “It’s Dean from the Holy Perk.”
“Mercifully no,” Castiel said. “They are usually busy in the city. You’re likely to see them around Christmas when they come home.”
“Toss up between Michael and Metatron,” Gabriel said. “If I had to put money on it I’d say Metatron. He actually went to college to become Dad’s editor and spends all his time singing his praises. Mind you he is critical of Dad’s writing when he has to be.” Gabriel thought for a moment. “Michael is still definitely a daddy’s boy though. He does everything to try and make Dad proud. In reality I don’t think Dad even gives a shit. He’s too busy with his books.”
“Right there,” he said, drawing his legs up slightly. “Add another finger and hit that spot again.”
“We know you have Castiel,” she said. “We are hoping you will release him to us.”
“And then you all went to bed and you never saw her again,” Bobby said.
“I’ll be in touch soon.”
“Yeah,” Dean said. “I asked him that earlier.” He looked up at Castiel. “You don’t mind, do you?”
Gabriel frowned. “Why?”
“Hey Dean, thanks for…. Oh shit.”
And with that he was gone.
“Dad came back,” Dean said. “Sam had to run.”
“The guy wears a trench coat that is two sizes too big for him,” Dean said. He wouldn’t be surprised if Castiel had picked it up at a thrift store, honestly. It looked like it.
“No,” Castiel said. “Gadreel is also absent. As is Ishim.”
Gabriel raised a brow. “She did?”
Dean took offense at that. “No I’m not.”
He asked Benny about it when he was next at the diner, Benny shrugging it off.
Castiel reached out with his hand. “May I?”
“Still can’t hurt to send him a message,” Bobby said.
“Great,” Dean deadpanned.
“What have you done,” Castiel breathed, staring down at him. “Dean. What have you done?”
Dean searched his mind trying to place her face. It clicked in his mind. “Hannah, right?”
“I don’t know what they said about me,” Anna said.
Reaching for his bedside table Dean tugged open the drawer. Without looking he found what he wanted, fingers closing around the well-used bottle of lube. He broke the kiss, beginning to nip and suck his way down Castiel’s neck and chest. He heard Castiel breathe his name, Dean smiling against the skin.
Crowley nodded.
“Valentine’s Day stuff,” Dean said. “He wanted some alone time with Eileen.”
Castiel frowned. “Why?”
Every so often he glanced over at a little stick sitting on the table. He had finally convinced himself to buy a pregnancy test. It had been two weeks and he hadn’t noticed any changes so he was starting to wonder if Castiel had lied to him. Castiel wasn’t one to lie about things like that though, so Dean had bought the test. He felt stupid peeing on the little stick, but now he had to wait for it to tell him.
Dean knew he should be. They had promised that they would make big decisions together, and this definitely was a big decision in Dean’s book. He sighed, trying to work out exactly how he felt about it. “I don’t know.”
“Yet he works in a coffee shop,” Dean said.
“Why are you doing this?” Castiel asked. “Why are you helping me?”
“Oh great, so you’re getting hooked in by another Shurley,’ Bobby said.
“Who cares if she’s lying,” Bobby said. “That family controls this town. You don’t wrong the Shurley’s.”
“Maybe,” she said. “But Castiel has already cut his hours. He’s just going to keep cutting them until one day he doesn’t work here anymore.”
Hannah averted her eyes. “There are those of us in our ranks who have practiced torture, but we do not.”
“It’s a night for couples,” she said, leaving them to look over the menu.
“Very quiet,” Castiel said as he put the supplies Gabriel had given him away. “Although my upstairs neighbours do tend to party a lot.”
“When he remembers,” Castiel said. “He is in the middle of writing his latest book. First draft. He rarely comes out of his office when he’s doing that.”
“1978 Lincoln Continental.”
“Yeah,” Dean said. “I’ll be waiting for you at the door as usual.”
“Yeah, I heard,” Aaron said. “Lucky.”
“Benny’s got a good head on his shoulders,” Bobby said. “He the one who convinced you to cut the cord?”
“Because of the principle,” Castiel said. “Although the fact she is my sister also lead to my decision."
“No you won’t, boy,” Bobby said. “You’ve got to have some time to yourself.”
“You’re going to afford it even less if it slips,” Dean said.
“You know that apartment building that looks like a giant cardboard box?” Gabriel said.
Hannah glanced back at the other two angels who nodded to her. She nodded back and turned to Sam. “We’ve decided that he must be eliminated.”
“Couple of years,” Aaron said. “It pays for college. You’re new, right?”
They looked up as the waitress brought their drinks, setting them down on the table with a smile. Dean and Castiel thanked her, Dean taking a drink from his. His mouth had gone dry at some point so the cold liquid went down well.
“Is there any truth to it?” Dean asked, finally looking over at the other man.
“Right now he’s looking at pre-law,” Dean said. “I don’t think he’s 100% committed yet though.”
“Right.” Dean looked up as a new customer entered and plastered a smile on his face.
Crowley groaned, rubbing a hand over his eyes. This was too much.
“Dean,” Castiel warned, watching as he walked away. “Dean! You can’t do this!
Dean glanced around. “Does she offer everyone this?”
“Why?”
“It is,” she said. “But he crammed everything into two and a half days so he could work the rest of the week.”
“But it was fun,” Dean said. “You kept pinning me to the bed and fucked me over and over. Your knot barely ever went down. It’d go down and boom, ten minutes later you were climbing right back on.”
“Oh yeah,” Dean said. “He thinks it’s unnatural.”
“That’s the whole point,” Dean said, rolling onto his side to face him. He wrapped an arm around Castiel’s waist and drew him in close. “So did you get what you wanted?”
Dean shrugged.
“I talked him into it,” Dean said. “I had to work for it though. It took a lot of babysitting Sam.”
“Yeah, I bet,” Dean said. “Makes me glad I took the apprenticeship route.”
“Okay,” Castiel said, tilting his head slightly to give Dean more access. “Was today a date?”
Dean frowned, looking up. “Yeah?”
“Kali,” the man said.
He stopped short as he heard the door open, and turning around he looked toward the doorway. His fingers wrapped around the dagger on his belt as he prepared to confront whoever it was that had entered. His eyes narrowed as he spotted the familiar shape of an angel.
Castiel looked at him, thinking for a moment before reaching a hand up to touch his ear. “Oh, a eh… gift from Claire.”
“I’m the one who’s going to have to deal with the fallout if you die,” Crowley said. “Be seeing you soon, Cassie.”
“Maybe, but there are other fees for owning the building,” Kali said. “Then you have to factor in supplies and ingredients, and the sweet shop has more workers.”
Dean pointed to his neck. “Does he know I was trying for this?”
“A little,” Castiel said. “I know Hannah and Samandrial look up to me. They would follow me around when I still lived at home.”
“The Dean you knew was made to torture. By you.” Dean reminded him.
“It was, yes,” Castiel said. “She tried to convince me to sleep with her afterward but I turned her down.”
“I won’t,” Dean said as he headed for the door.
“So you can put it back together again,” Bobby said. “Replace what you need to with parts from the yard. See if you can rebuild it and make it run.”
“Huh,” she raised an eyebrow. “Never viewed him as the type to be good with kids.”
“Tell me.”
“Hey Cas,” Dean said, stepping toward the angel.
“What an asshole, right?”
Crowley took several long steps back from him as Castiel breathed in the grace. He closed his eyes, feeling the power seep into him. There was a bright flash and an eruption of energy radiating out from him. The bed was thrown backward and crashed against the wall, barely missing where Crowley now stood. Castiel straightened, spreading out his broken wings with some relief. They hurt but it felt good to have them back.
It took them another hour to find a cinema with a film playing that Dean was interested in. He led Castiel into the building, making sure to stock up on treats before he led the way into the theatre. Castiel’s eyes were wide as he tried to take everything in at once, Dean finding them a spot in the back row just below the projector.
“The alternative was my nose,” Castiel said, scrunching up the spot in question. “I passed.”
“Cas…”
“Yeap. Glad that didn’t happen,” Dean said as he wiped the floors. “I do not want to clean that up.”
“Well your background and his background might not be that different,” Bobby said. “He’s from a weird family. Understand they travelled a lot when he was younger before they settled into town here. He’s dad’s some sort of big shot writer.”
“What Naomi does is not torture,” Hannah said.
“Still too long,” Crowley said. “And who knows what kind of Hellspawn he’ll give birth too.”
And with that he was gone.
“Yet you’re going to give it to Dean to give back to Cas,” Sam said.
“None,” Castiel replied.
“I might take a couple of days down time,” Dean said. He rubbed his arm where the Mark was. “It’s pretty sated right now.”
“Yet you can’t get Anton to ‘sing’,” Crowley reminded him.
“Thanks Benny,” Dean said. He frowned. “By the way, can I get some take away for Bobby?”
She seemed to consider that. “I’ll have to discuss it with the others.”
“No deals,” Dean said. “Promise me that.”
“An honourable profession,” Castiel said. “Not very well paid though.”
“Sorry, sorry,” Dean said, pulling off his jacket and glancing at the clock. “We kind of got talking and lost track of time.”
“He’s fine with it,” she said. “Give me your phone.”
“He tried to escape,” Castiel said.
Dean nodded. “You said something about that it kept happening.”
“Don’t concern yourself with it, Dean,” Kali assured him. “It wasn’t your fault.”
“Turned him into a drunk,” Dean said. “Meant we’ve been moving our whole lives because he refused to settle down again. I think he’s scared that if he settles down he’ll start missing her so he just kept us moving.”
Dean raised his eyebrows as he dropped into a chair. “That must have been murder.”
“What did you just do?” Castiel asked, eyes wide as he finally spotted the syringe in Dean’s hand. “What was that?”
“Fair enough,” Benny said. “Did you want a drink refill?”
“Very much so.” She checked the machines again. “Anyway you better put your apron on. It’s almost time to open.”
“Yes,” she said softly.
Sam was worried. Less than week ago he’d received a cryptic message from Crowley telling him to urge the angels to hurry up with their search for Castiel’s grace. He’d tried to ring him but it had gone straight to voicemail. If Sam didn’t know better it was as if Crowley was lying low, which could only mean one thing: something was wrong with Dean.
“That’s not fair,” Dean said. “You earned it so you should get it.”
Anna frowned. “Trouble with your own father?”
Dean stared at him. “Seriously?”
He eventually dozed off, falling back into a fitful slumber. This time he dreamed of Crowley dead at Dean’s feet, Castiel chained up next to the throne in Hell while Dean sat on the throne himself, the new King of Hell. His eyes burned black as he turned and smiled at Sam with a toothy grin.
Castiel pushed himself up, swinging one leg over Dean’s hips so that he could straddle him. They worked together to line up Dean’s cock, Castiel slowly sinking down onto the length. Castiel flicked the trench coat out so that it wasn’t in the way, and Dean had to admit how hot he looked naked in nothing else. Dean knew that every time he saw the trench coat now he would be thinking of this moment.
“Of Singer Spares and Repairs?”
She nodded. “I’m ready.”
He broke off a portion and handed it across to Castiel. The angel took the bite, slipping it into his mouth and chewing.
Aaron shook his head. “I was rostered off. We work alternating weekends on special order weeks.”
“I wanted her side,” Dean said. “I was curious.”
“He’s safe,” Dean said. “I’m keeping him juice up and preventing him from topping himself.”
“Gabriel did mention it to the officers,” Castiel said. “I imagine they will question him about it.”
“I cannot afford a streaming service,” Castiel said.
-----O-----
“But not at the coffee shop,” she said. “That was always a family business.”
“This isn’t over, Winchester,” Crowley said. “Stop killing my people or I’ll have to do something about it.”
“So you’re Crowley’s bitch,” Castiel said.
Gabriel wandered into the store as Dean was finishing. “Hey, Dean-o.”
-----O-----
“Been a while,” Dean said. “How you holding up?”
“Nobody can resist a Winchester,” Dean said. “It’s our animal magnetism.”
“He does,” Castiel said.
Castiel stared at him, Dean feeling his glare. He sighed, stroking Castiel’s jawline and feeling the stubble beneath his fingers. Dean glanced up toward the door and wondered if the other demons were trying to listen in.
“Mostly through our bond,” Castiel admitted. “But it is visible, yes.”
He watched as Dean entered the cell. Castiel looked him over and noted that Dean looked healthy. He had been worried since he had sensed Dean’s fight with the angels. He knew that Dean had gotten injured in the fight but he could see no sign of it now. Once the fight was over he had closed his mind down again, trying to suppress his bond with Dean. He didn’t need Dean to know his every thought.
“I intend to earn my own place in the world,” Castiel said. “Unlike my brothers and sisters I don’t want to rely on my father’s money to get a start.”
“Will you stop doing that,” Dean complained. “Look at me.”
“Okay,” Sam said. “Good luck.”
“What if she’s not the one who’s on the wrong side?” Dean said.
Castiel stared at him a moment before he pulled off his trench coat and tossed it over the back of Dean’s desk chair, then reached up and began to unbutton his shirt. Normally Dean would feel excited at the sight of this but right now all he could feel was dread, worrying just what Claire had talked Castiel into doing.
“I have my books,” Castiel said. “I am also expecting Gabriel to drop in tomorrow, and no doubt a phone call from my father once word spreads.”
Castiel blinked. “I could help.”
“Let’s get some breakfast,” Dean said.
Castiel didn’t need to be told twice. He started out slow enough that it was driving Dean crazy, but slowly increased his thrusts over time. Dean rolled his hips, angling them with each thrust until Castiel began spearing into his sweet spot. Dean grunted, tilting his head back as Castiel began peppering soft kisses over his neck and jaw.
Please kudos and comment!
“Tried digging but got no results,” Benny said. “Few of his siblings pass through here but even though they’re happy to talk about him they never explained the name.”
“This morning,” Gabriel said. “He let me know as soon as he found out.”
“Tough day?” Dean asked as soon as they were gone.
“That’s just because you hate flying,” Sam said. “So have you met him?”
Benny smiled faintly, shaking his head. “Like I said – it’s just the way things are.”
“Why?” Dean asked. “You’ve helped her before.”
“Apparently it’s their law,” Sam said. “So if you do find it, maybe tell them to go to ground.”
“He wouldn’t touch Sam,” Dean said. “He never touched Sam.”
Crowley nodded.
“We were already in town,” Hannah admitted. “Sam sent us the coordinates less than an hour ago.”
“So Kali’s not pissed at me?” Dean asked.
“What I figured,” Dean said. “Give Dad a chance to get out of the place.”
“16 all up,” Benny said. “Sure it would have been more if Michael hadn’t put his foot down.”
“Exactly how long have you known this?”
“The Moose is not really a problem right now,” Crowley said. “He still doesn’t know you’re a demon, and he hasn’t yet realised Feathers is missing.”
“That’s fine,” Gabriel said.
“None,” she said. “It’s a very profitable coffee shop. We actually put a Starbucks out of business.”
“Anything else you want to know?” Dean asked.
Dean stretched out in his seat, resting the popcorn on his lap. He lost himself in the film, absently chewing on the snacks and sipping from his drink. He noted out the corner of his eye that Castiel occasionally reached over for the food and took some. Dean smiled as he took in Castiel’s wide eyes as he stared at the screen.
“Their location,” Crowley said. “Once you have the information come to me. I will decide what to do next.”
“Castiel should be your first priority,” Dean said. “The kids not going to be born for months.”
“He is using the grace stolen from our brethren,” Hannah said.
He reached the door in the dungeon and wondered if the guards had followed his orders exactly. There was only one way to find out, and Dean unlocked the door and pushed it open. He stepped into the room, spotting the chair in the middle of the space. Castiel’s head came up as Dean entered, Dean closing and locking the door behind him.
“It’s this god damned Mark,” Dean said, scratching his arm. “It made me do things.”
“I look after my parents,” Anna said. “They’re getting older and my mother is sick.”
“No,” Castiel said. “He has offered but I have refused.”
Dean made his way down to the dungeon, passing several other demons on the way who gave him a wide berth and kept their eyes down. He really was enjoying their fear. He could almost taste it. He licked his lips. He hadn’t felt this since he had been in purgatory, and even then he had had a disadvantage. Now the playing field was even. Dean even had an advantage.
“So she singled you out,” Gabriel said. “She knows you’re not rich, right?”
“We should go start setting up,” Kali said to Dean. “And Gabriel probably has toffee apples to make.”
Castiel frowned. “Then how did you get food.”
Crowley stared him down without flinching. He set his jaw. “There’s a pack of werewolves that have been attacking my people and screwing with my business on purpose because I refused to cut a deal with them. Teach them a lesson.”
Dean left him in the kitchen, heading for his room. He peeled off his work shoes and clothes and got ready for bed. He climbed between the blankets, contemplating reading for a while but deciding against it. He switched off the light and settled into bed. It didn’t take him long to fall asleep.
Castiel didn’t answer. He reminded himself that this was not Dean but rather a demon talking. Demon’s lie. They would say anything to get what they wanted. He had no way of verifying what Dean was saying was true so he could only assume that it was fake.
“You’ll hurt yourself,” Castiel warned him.
He’d then headed to the shoe shop and had a discussion with the attendant about what he was after, the attendant pointing him toward a particular brand of shoes that was apparently popular with people who worked in retail. Dean had tried them on and found them to be comfortable, and the attendant assured him they would hold up after being on his feet all day. Dean had purchased himself a pair, then gathered up his haul and headed for a café to get some lunch.
“He kept me in line,” Dean said. “That’s what matters. Whenever I got distracted he put me back on the straight road.”
This rush didn’t seem to be as busy as some of the previous ones, and they managed to work their way through it without Dean making a mistake. He actually felt relieved as the last customer exited with a smile on their face. Dean wiped his hands on his apron, feeling a wave of exhaustion play over him. Kali sent him to lock the door as the clock ticked over to closing time.
“So it could be anyone,” Sam said. “Any angel.”
“Which he no longer is,” Hannah said. “Castiel is currently an abomination of an angel.”
“Flattery will get you nowhere,” Bobby said, giving him a light shove. “Let’s call it a day.”
“No,” Dean said. “I personally think he’ll have the grades for Harvard or Stanford.”
“Dean, don’t,” Castiel said.
“You realise Crowley is going to kill him first chance he gets,” Sam said.
“Sacrilege!” Gabriel said. He slapped Dean on the shoulder. “Don’t worry, it’s actually pretty straight forward. It just looks intimidating. Shall we begin?”
“Such a horrid word,” Crowley said. “It’s not like you haven’t wanted it.”
“Purgatory,” Crowley scoffed. “With a broken angel and a hellspawn child.”
Dean felt his mouth watering at the sound of them. He wanted to try all three and knew that he could only pick one. It was going to be a tough call.
“Our father took a liking to him for some reason,” Anna said. “He always sheltered him. I think he always admired his free will. In our family you were either fiercely loyal to our father to a fault or you rebelled and were shunned.”
“Well I can’t leave him locked up for six months,” Crowley muttered.
Castiel levelled him with a look. “You enjoy killing my brethren.”
“Yes,” Castiel said. “That’s why he sometimes sends provisions home to me.”
“So they never caught the guy,” Dean said.
“I’m ecstatic,” Dean said dryly.
It took Dean almost two weeks to hunt down the last of the werewolves. The pack had spread themselves out across a state, burying themselves deeply into Crowley’s business and sabotaging it at every step of the way. The demons had pointed him in the right direction and Dean had begun his hunt. He had wiped out entire families, leaving none alive.
“It has already been two months,” she said.
“I mean for dinner,” Dean said. “I was just thinking that maybe we could go to Benny’s after shift.”
He stepped into the throne room to find Crowley practically dozing in his seat. Dean knew he was awake – demons didn’t need to sleep. It was probably pure boredom that was gripping the King. Crowley’s eyes flicked up toward him as Dean entered, the King straightening in his seat and stretching.
“It would have destroyed everything,” Castiel said. “That is why Nephilim are forbidden.”
“At least this one is respected,” Dean defended.
“It does,” Kali said. “Especially out the back where they make the candy. It’s all climate controlled. Everything has to be a certain temperature in order to make the sweets.”
“Right.”
“So he hid it from himself,” Dean said. “Smart. That way if someone does interrogate you you have nothing to give up.”
“Okay, I’ll give you that,” Bobby said. He picked up his knife and fork and cut into dinner. “So what’s his place like? Got a golden toilet?”
“Oh come on.” Dean pointed to the spot where his shoulder met his neck, right where his scent gland was. “Just a little mark right here.”
“So we can do it over several weeks,” Castiel said.
“Car crash,” Dean said. “Chuck adopted the orphan.”
“Pass,” Dean said. “Not a wine fan.”
had a friend?”
“Human?” Crowley shook his head. “He’s a Knight of Hell. He’s not becoming human.”
“I see.” She tilted her head. “Anyone I know?”
“Understandable,” Castiel said with a huff of a laugh.
A flare of overprotectiveness flashed through Dean as he contemplated taking Castiel’s advice and terminating the pregnancy. This was his child he was thinking about. His and Castiel’s. He couldn’t bear to think of destroying it. He wanted to nurture it, protect it. He knew that his decision was already made and had been made the day Castiel had told him they had conceived.
“There’s one in every family,” Kali said softly.
Dean frowned. He hadn’t thought about that. “I doubt he’d get out. Besides, he’d be pretty stupid to target the same place again now the cops know who he is.”
“Yeah,” Dean said. “I tried to rush things.”
The bath bombs had turned out to be soothing though. Sam had convinced Dean to give one of them a try, Dean reluctantly relaxing back in the tub. He had almost fallen asleep. It had been years since he had simply taken a bath to relax. His whole body had thanked him for it.
“We’re going to have to work something out,” Sam said. “There’s got to be some way to get the grace. Just like there’s a way to cure Dean.”
“They abandoned him too,” Anna said. “I visit him in prison sometimes but even he doesn’t want to talk to me.”
Castiel had kept in contact, and Dean could still sense him over their bond. They kept their minds open to each other now. Dean tried not to pry too much over his, trying to give Castiel his privacy. He knew that Castiel had gone to visit the angels to reassure them that everything was fine. Dean was scared they would realise who were the ones behind the Nephilim and kill Castiel. Castiel had sent him reassuring thoughts and Dean knew that he was still alive.
Sam stared at him for a long time, Castiel’s words sinking in. He felt a wave of anger wash over him. “Was it you?’
“How about your other job?” Sam asked. “Was a coffee shop, wasn’t it?”
“Depends how you look at it,” Dean said.
“Why would I do that?” Castiel asked. He sat on the edge of the bed, looking down at Dean with soft eyes.
“So I have been told,” Castiel said, a faint smile on his lips.
“You ran away too,” Anna said defensively. “And Castiel and Lucifer both changed their names.”
Sam stepped forward and began to undo the bonds on Dean’s arms and legs. Once he was done he held out a hand. Dean took it and allowed Sam to pull him up into a tight hug. Sam squeezed his eyes closed as he breathed in Dean’s familiar scent. He could still smell the omega in his brother that was usually deeply suppressed, but Sam had always been able to slightly smell that scent. It was part of knowing what Dean was.
“It does help,” Gabriel said, dropping into a seat. “So I’ve got a favour to ask you, Dean.”
Dean fisted Castiel’s hair with one hand, pulling him close with the other. He rolled his hips in time with Castiel’s thrusts. He didn’t think this could get much better but then an idea occurred to him. He groaned, opening his eyes to look up at Castiel.
“Sounds like a loose belt,” Dean said.
“Nice.”
Dean patted the First Blade. “No, I think I’ll keep it handy. Never know when you might need it.”
“Wait, what?!” They spotted Gabriel in the door of the sweet shop, his eyes staring at them. “You guys got robbed?”
“I did,” Castiel said. “The Nephilim no longer exists.”
“You’ve got something she wants then,” Bobby said. “You stay away from Anna Milton. Do you realise what she could do?”
“You made it my business when you started killing my demons,” Crowley said. “This started after you visited Feathers. Did something happen?”
Dean’ eyes lit up. “Pie?”
“It’s not like I’m planning on spending it all on pie,” Dean said. “Just heard about the place, that’s all.”
“If you’ve met Chuck you’d understand it,” Kali said. “After all, this is a man who adopted 16 children and barely had much to do with them growing up aside from occasionally checking in on them to make sure they were still alive.”
“Bobby say’s that I can work on it,” Dean said. “It has to be in my own time and he’s willing to offer a discount on any parts it needs. They’ll be second hand parts from the yard here but they’ll be better than the ones you have.”
“My grace,” Castiel said.
She nodded. “You are an abomination.”
-----O-----
“No,” Dean said, meeting Bobby’s eye. “Remember Castiel?”
“Bullocks you do,” Crowley said. He drummed his fingers on the throne, trying to work out how to navigate this mess. He shook his head as he tried to get the rage back under control. “Exactly how powerful is this thing going to be?”
“In his daddy’s eyes that boy can do no wrong,” Bobby said. “He got busted with weed in high school and his family just swept it under the rug.”
“That and the fact he didn’t want Dean as a demon anymore,” Sam said. “What happened, anyway? What changed?”
“I told you it doesn’t matter,” Dean said. “We can’t keep meeting up like this, Anna. I’m sorry.”
“Dean…” Castiel said softly.
“Actually I would,” Dean said. “I just didn’t have the means before.’
“She has embellished a great many things,” Castiel said.
“Benny works his people hard,” Bobby said. “No lazing about on his watch.”
“Got to make myself useful somehow,” Dean said.
“I’ll believe it when I see it.”
“Isn’t that what angels are for?” Crowley said, frowning as he spotted something. “Your famous for your faith, however misguided it is.”
“Well see,” Sam said. “We’re only one injection down. There are seven more to go.”
“I told you I’ve got it covered,” Dean said.
“Several,” Castiel said. “My father included.”
“What’s going on?” Eileen asked as she stepped into the room behind Sam. She spotted Castiel and Dean and smiled, signing something to Sam.
He watched as Castiel stood and wandered back to the bakery. Dean finished his cherry pie before doing an ‘eeny-meeny-miney-mo’ game to select which pie to try next. He ended up on the lemon meringue, making sure to leave a bit for Castiel before biting into it. This one was even better than the cherry. The bakery definitely was in contention for the ‘best in state’.
“Wouldn’t have made things easy,” Benny said. “If Bobby’s willing to take you on then you must be all right.”
“His interview was kind of intense,” Dean admitted. “He asked a lot of questions about school.”
They ate the rest of the meal mostly in silence, Dean occasionally shifting his feet to try and ease the ache in them. As he was finishing dinner he frowned when Bobby got up and headed for the bathroom, coming back and setting a tube down on the table. Dean spotted the IcyHot logo and gave Bobby a look of thanks. He didn’t know how Bobby had known.
-----O-----
“Why didn’t he come with you?”
“Better than us,” Kali said. “Because they’re indoors they tend to get more people.”
“So you are independent,” Dean said.
“And where are you going?” Crowley asked.
Dean frowned. “Independence Day?”
“No,” Castiel said. “I get take away once a week but I usually have it at home.”
“Wow,” Aaron said. “So you were the ones who got held up?”
“I didn’t,” Bobby said. “Did you?”
“You know what, fuck you,” Dean said, getting defensive. “I’m an adult. I know you can’t accept that but I’m doing fine, and I’m still going to look out for my little brother. Wasn’t that my job?”
“Have an apartment?” she asked.
The rest of the day was uneventful, Dean making it through the remainder of his shift with only two small mistakes. Kali had been a little out of it he noted, so he’d made her a little cream cup with sprinkles in the shape of a smile on top. She had grinned at that, thanking him and giving him a hug. Dean had felt better about brightening her day up a little.
“You!” The masked man waved the gun in his direction. “Come around front!”
Dean frowned and wondered what he meant. It took a moment for the puzzle pieces to click into place. “You mean Anna.”
“My dungeon,” Crowley said. “My cell. You’re the one who should be asking permission.”
“Yeah?” Dean asked. “How does that work?”
“Dean,” Castiel said, his eyes soft.
Eventually the subordinates left one-by-one, having given their reports and been dismissed. When the last one left Crowley slid out of his chair, his eyes on Dean.
“Yeah, but Dean will see right through it,” Sam said. “And Crowley usually sees through it too. If they realise we’re lying they’ll be pissed and we might never get Cas and Dean back.”
Benny frowned. “Is this because I won’t let you pay?”
“Anything exciting?” he asked Castiel.
“He lives there,” Gabriel said. “He’s got an apartment on the first floor.”
“We can cure you,” Castiel repeated.
“But that was long before you were born,” Bobby said.
“He’s always busy,” Dean said. “Besides, Castiel is closer to my age.”
“I guess so,” Dean said. He reached out, taking Castiel’s closest hand. “Cas, can you do something for me?”
Gabriel stuck his hand out, Kali shaking it.
“You should not be torturing, Dean,” Castiel said.
“Why would I lie?” Crowley asked. “What Squirrel does isn’t my business unless he makes it my business.”
“Why wouldn’t his family help him out?” Dean asked.
“That’s not going to happen,” Dean said. “Nobody’s dying.”
“If he hits Sam I will personally drive to Minnesota and pummel him into the ground,” Dean growled.
They soon found themselves caught up in the first school rush of the day. There were tons of inappropriate questions that Dean just ignored. He noted that Kali wasn’t answering any of them either. Some of the kids shared how they would have been the hero and taken down the robber, but Dean knew that it was all bluster. Most of them would probably wet their pants if they’d been in his shoes.
“She went for the lips,” Dean said. “She um… offered herself in exchange for money.”
The surviving demons all shook their head, backing away slowly from the King.
He tried to speed up but that resulted in him making mistakes and having to start again. He decided in the end that it was better to be slow and correct then fast and make mistakes. Not to mention every time he made a mistake it was more profits going down the drain. He bit his lip, frowning as he focussed on doing things right.
“Well good for you,” John said sarcastically. “You could have had that here.”
“I’m living with my surrogate uncle,” Dean said.
Abruptly Dean moved, pulling at his bonds. Castiel pushed himself off the wall as he saw them coming free. Quickly he crossed the room and grabbed them, Dean snapping at him. Castiel reached into his grace and grabbed Dean to hold him down. The last thing he needed was Dean loose in the bunker. He would probably kill Sam if given the chance.
“Thanks,” Dean said. He kept his head down as he led the way over to Bobby’s office, unlocking the door and turning on the lights. He stepped inside, turning to face Gabriel as the man entered behind him. “You wanted to talk.”
“If you want I can get some time off from the Holy Perk to help,” Dean said.
“Dean used a potion to induce my rut,” Castiel explained. “And one in turn that brought on his heat. He turned me into an animal.”
and began to re-read it. He spent most of the morning focused on the book, losing himself in the story. He liked to pretend that he was one of the characters taking on the ghost truck, imagining himself as the one who got the girl and saved the day. He wondered what it would be like being a monster hunter. It would probably be a lot of thankless work. He was glad for his own mundane life.
“It’s done,” Crowley said, drawing one of the potions up into a syringe. “Just give this to Feathers and it will induce his rut within 24 hours. It will be so intense he won’t be able to think clearly. You’ll get your mating bite.”
She nodded. “That’s not his real name of course.”
He could barely raise his head when the door to the cell opened, Castiel having missed the approaching footsteps. He blurrily looked up and spotted Dean making his way into the cell, a frown on Dean’s face as he came to kneel beside Castiel. A hand caught him under the chin and lifted his head back, Dean gazing down at him with his green eyes.
Castiel could feel the last of his stolen grace fading rapidly. He had been deliberately trying to burn it out, using it to try and force himself free of his bonds. He could feel the darkness spreading through him, his senses dulling. He knew it would only be a matter of time now before the last of his grace burned out and burned him out with it.
“You mentioned he served,” Castiel said.
Dean allowed Castiel to pull him to his feet, Castiel stepping into his arms and kissing him firmly. Dean wrapped his arms around him. He could taste the pb&j on his lips as well as the honey cake, and they hadn’t even gotten to the alcohol yet. Dean kissed Castiel back, his mind singing with the word ‘fiancé’ over and over again.
“I will be powerful enough,” Castiel said. “I am a seraph.”
“Sounds fun,” Dean said sarcastically. He had finished sweeping the floor and moved to put the chairs down off the tables. “At least it’s only one holiday out of the year. Imagine if you had to do Thanksgiving.”
Not to mention there was Castiel. Sam was still scared about what could be happening to the angel. He didn’t know what demon!Dean was like. For all he knew he could be torturing Castiel. Even worse, Castiel might already be dead and they could just be trying to get a hold of Castiel’s grace for some other purpose. There was no clear way of knowing.
“Barely,” Bobby said. “Think of it as practice between doing odd jobs around the shop.”
“So the two of you…”
“Worried,” Castiel said. “Dean, we can help you.”
“Writing,” Dean said.
“Yeap. His misses is from the wealthy end of town. Understand she helped pay off the rest of the place and became a silent partner.” Bobby shrugged. “Never see her in here, though. I understand she’s more into book clubs and yachting.”
“No real issues,” Kali told him, eyeing the sweet. “Eating the profits again?”
“Most likely,” Benny said. “She hasn’t fired you yet so there’s still hope.”
Castiel set his jaw and remained silent.
“Every lie starts with a kernel of truth,” Castiel confirmed. “But no, things were not as she made out. She has exaggerated them.”
“Do you ever miss being an angel?” Dean asked Castiel.
“I’m sure they’ve tried,” Dean said, taking a sizeable drink from the Whiskey. He gestured to it. “This is good stuff. Where’d you get it?”
Sure enough she picked up an apron and turned to him with a smile on her face. “You must be Dean. My name is Kali.”
“Anyway you should be fine on Saturday,” Kali said. “If anything goes wrong we’re right next door.”
Sam turned and sprinted for the front door, taking the steps two at a time. Reaching the top he threw open the door and found Crowley standing outside. Sam’s eyes widened as he spotted Castiel standing directly behind him, but it was the demon struggling in Castiel’s arms that caught all of Sam’s attention.
Dean nodded, glancing toward the front of the store. He looked at the sign that was hanging in the front window and raised a brow. “Hot chocolate really is popular, isn’t it?”
“Well, nobody fell over today,” Kali said. “You did a good job keeping the floor clean.”
“It could destroy worlds,” Castiel said.
“No,” Dean said. “Like I could.”
Anna shook her head. “My parents lost their jobs after everything happened. There are rumours about them too. My dad has to travel three hours a day just to work. No school will take my mother on anymore, and I can’t find a job.”
“Ah yes, I forgot you can sense that now,” Crowley said. “Your bond.”
Dean picked up his beer and downed the remains of it before pushing himself to his feet. He swung himself out of his chair and stalked across the room, grabbing Castiel by the hand as he passed him and dragging him out of the room. He could feel Castiel’s amusement over their bond, Castiel dutifully following him through the bunker to Dean’s room. Dean pushed open the door and dragged Castiel inside, then closed the door and slammed Castiel back against it.
Bobby thought for a second. “How about this. You work on his car on your own time. I’m talking outside work hours and on weekends. I’ll let you have a discount on the parts
Dean did feel a bit intimidated though. If he messed this up Bobby might be the one who had to wear the consequences. He made a mental note to have Bobby double check all of his work before he gave the car back to Castiel. That way if he did make any mistakes Bobby would be able to catch them before they became a bigger problem.
He let his head fall, closing his eyes again. It was going to be a rough next few hours.
“You don’t have to get up at dawn you know,” Bobby said. “Not when you’re working downstairs.”
“Then stop acting like one!” Crowley growled, slamming a fist down on the arm of the throne. “Do you understand just how complicated you have made things.”
Dean laughed. “Yeah. Maybe. I wouldn’t put it passed him.”
“Cas,” Dean said, wrapping his arms around Castiel’s neck. “You feel so good.”
Dean chuckled. “Yeah, I guess that would help.”
“It’s your time,” Bobby had told him. “Just make sure they pay you.”
“Can’t? Or won’t?” Dean asked.
“What are you intending on doing with him once you find his grace?” Crowley asked. “Have you at least thought that through?”
“Fuck you, Crowley,” Dean said. “Cas is my responsibility and I’ll take care of him.”
“Remember that fire at the Brooklyn warehouse?” Crowley asked.
“He is a bit,” Dean agreed. He stared down at his cheeseburger. “Look, can we not talk about my dad?”
“No regrets?” Dean asked.
starting to sound like Crowley,” Dean accused.
“When he finishes school?” Kali said. “He got any plans?”
“Sex, Cas,” Dean explained. “They’ll have sex.”
“I reported that place, you know,” Sam said. “To the health inspectors after we left.”
“Like I said – it doesn’t matter,” Dean said. “Let’s just say they told me what you would offer. They were right.”
“Daunting,” Castiel said. “It is like you are forever facing the unknown. You must make your own decisions and live with the consequences of them.”
“Yes, we do,” Anna said.
“How’d that go?” Dean asked, remembering how she’d mentioned this before.
“He cannot be allowed to,” Castiel said. “It must be destroyed.”
“Hey Bobby,” Dean asked as they headed inside. “Know anything about a place called Benny’s?”
“So we’re back to that,” Crowley said. “Is it the blood lust? Because if so I have a few new targets you can take out.”
Dean settled in beside Castiel, smoothing his hands up the inside of Castiel’s thighs. Castiel kept his thighs firmly pressed together. Dean made an annoyed sound before forcing Castiel’s knees apart, sliding into the gap between them. Castiel stared him down as Dean reached forward and wrapped his hand around Castiel’s cock.
“Do that.” Crowley looked at Sam. “Moose.”
“It went,” Castiel said, sighing heavily. “It was on the Abrahamic faiths and their differences.”
“Sam Winchester?”
“Maybe I’m new and improved,” Dean said. “You’ve had a taste of this sort of power, Sam. You know what it’s like.”
“Yes,” she said. “He’s helped in the past. When my dad had a fall Castiel helped pay for his hip reconstruction. I was hoping he could help again.”
“Why are they so big?” Dean asked.
“So your dad isn’t a douchebag?”
“At the same time he can track you,” Crowley reminded him. “He can also sense what you’re feeling. Perhaps even what you’re doing. You turned a simple liability into a fucking train wreck.”
“If you think his apartment is ugly you should see his car,” Kali said.
Gabriel gave her a pointed look and left. Dean bit his lip, wishing he could find out more to the story and knowing he probably wasn’t going to get it. Instead he moved back out to finish mopping the floor, making sure that the floor wasn’t too wet so that someone might slip. Kali went back to checking the coffee machines, Dean noting that there was a tenseness to her shoulders that hadn’t been there before.
“It’s that Gabriel fella, isn’t it?” Bobby asked. “Short guy, long hair.”
“Cas,” Sam said. “Was Dean carrying the Nephilim?”
Castiel paused, a concerned look on his face. “Did I do something wrong?”
“I couldn’t afford it,” Dean said. “I’m still living with Bobby and he’s barely got enough room for me. I’m planning to save up and pay for Sam to go to college though.”
Sam whipped around, spotting Crowley standing not too far away. “Crowley!”
“About now I wish I was legal,” Dean said as the headed into the diner. “Be a good night for a beer.”
“He’s a nice guy, that Benny,” Bobby said. “There’s a reason the place is popular.”
“You’re scared of my family,” Anna said.
“Unfortunately,” Crowley said. “But I bet you knotted with Feathers.”
“Don’t look so scared,” Gabriel said. “Felicity doesn’t bite.”
“A Nephilim?” Dean asked. “Cas, did you just knock me up?”
“I’ve thought of everything,” Dean assured him. “You worry too much.”
“We haven’t been formerly introduced,” the man said. “I’m-“
“We need to talk to Crowley,” Sam said. “I’ll text you some coordinates. I’ll meet you there in a few hours.”
They began the process of setting up the store, Dean not needing to be told what needed to be done. He set up the tables as Kali began warming up the machines.
“That must make it hard,” Dean said with a frown.
He waited until Dean was gone before moving to sit on his throne with a heavy sigh. He could almost sense Dean becoming more dangerous with every passing day. He was getting stronger and more adept with his new skills as a demon, and with the Mark fuelling him it wouldn’t be long before he would be in a position to challenge Crowley for the title as King.
“Yeah, but a family that big you’ve got to know something,” Dean said.
“Is he the only one you watch?”
“I think we can agree that middle-income is the way to be,” Benny said. “Enough money to get by without being rich.”
Gabriel’s eyebrows rose. “Really?”
“Yeah,” Dean agreed. “They are a bit.”
“Since when do you need hex bags?”
“How do you know I’m not one of those idiots?” Dean asked.
“You’re not a failure,” Sam said. “You’re working a job and have an apprenticeship. You’re going to take over Bobby’s place one day. That’s pretty good.”
“Yes,” Anna said. “Lucifer was always a rogue entity. He always pushed back against authority, including our fathers. When he turned 18 our father wanted him to follow a set path but Lucifer had other ideas so Father kicked him out.”
“Wait, so you know about the ‘golden child’ thing?” Dean asked, surprised. He hadn’t expected Castiel to know about that.
Castiel regarded him. “He doesn’t approve of your choices.”
He rubbed his tired eyes as he settled back into his chair. He had managed to get a little sleep but he was still mostly running on coffee and energy drinks. The talk with Dean had not done him any favours. His dreams were now plagued with nightmares about Dean with black eyes. Part of him was thrilled that his brother was alive, but the rest of him was horrified by what he was.
“Gonna text Sam first to make sure he isn’t around,” Dean said. “Sam said last week that Dad tended to go out in the morning so it should be fine.”
“What about
-----O-----
Castiel didn’t answer, instead just staring at him with wide eyes.
He settled back against the wall, stretching his legs out in front of him. He didn’t know how long it would be until Dean returned again so all he could do was wait.
It took Dean a lot longer than he had hoped to find the man that Crowley had sent him to find. And it was a man – not a demon. The way Crowley had talked Dean had expected the man to be some kind of monster who was too hard for any other demon to kill, but no, he had just been an ordinary man. Nothing special about him although he did seem to be adept at witchcraft.
Huddled up like that under the blanket, they ate their breakfast, Dean feeding Cas and Cas using the time to let his hand wander all over Dean’s body. Eliciting soft moans from him. Dean couldn’t get rid of the plate fast enough, all but stuffing the last piece into his mouth so he finally had his hands free as well. The moment the plate left his hand, Dean pushed Cas back onto the deckchair, letting his hands wander and roam and caress.
During dinner, Cas had actually sat next to him and they had spent the whole course discussing various authors, their good and their bad aspects and Cas had thrown one name at Dean after another. With some, he had to admit Cas was driving a hard bargain - but Dean would always and adamantly stay on his point that Vonnegut beat all of them.
“Good morning indeed.”
The fake groans of the two men filled his ear but all he could hear was Cas’ rough voice. His grip around his rapidly filling cock became stronger - the stokes rougher.
The sale was planned to last at least two hours, maybe a bit more if need be. Or less, if they were sold out before then. The way the first half an hour of the sale went, Dean was pretty sure that second one was going to be the most likely option.
didn’t want it anymore. Didn’t want
“You two are so mean.”
“But why can’t it be?”
“Yes, it’s amazing, and again, you can see all of Paris from the top. Dean, you
Dean squeezed Cas’ thigh again before looking back on the road just as Cas took the turn towards the ranch.
“Go. I’ll watch your kids.”
“– by playing with their feelings for your own ego and–”
“Hey, Emma. Merry Christmas.”
Lydia’s eyes went wide and Dean cut himself off, realizing what he had just said.
Somehow, it had meaning.
He said it with a smile to his voice and was glad to get some laughs from the room.
Dean waited but there was no immediate reply, so he went back to work, bending over the open hood of the Volvo he was currently tending to. After he had turned sixteen, he’d started working for Bobby here and there; but for a year now, his job in the garage was full time – and still, there was no job Dean could think of that he would love more than this. He still silently thanked C every day for giving him the push he had needed to follow this dream.
The smile on his lips pulled wide as the memories of last night came floating back to him. He might not know what woke him this early but he also didn’t care when it meant he could cuddle close to Cas again and fall back to sleep with his arms wrapped around the man of his dreams.
and he wanted him
It was only when the man calmly spoke that Dean had to swallow, but he still nodded, letting Zar know that he heard and respected his warning – and that he took it seriously. He wanted to tell him that it wasn’t needed, that he didn’t plan to ever hurt Cas again, in this life or any of the next. But the truth was, they were all human. They all made mistakes. Dean would say the same if the roles were reversed.
There certainly were enough guys around him at the moment, and Dean hoped no one would notice his ears burning up as he suddenly looked at them with different eyes.
Cas that none of this had been a game to him, that he had feelings for him, that he fucking
Dean smiled down at his daughter. “They sure will, pumpkin.”
“Don’t worry, I’ll get them for you. You ladies just relax.”
“Cas?” he asked, putting on a bit of his teacher-voice. “Don’t you wanna try?” he added, gesturing meaningfully down at his daughter once he had caught Cas’ attention.
“Sorry, Mr. Winchester. My sister-”
“That’s mighty honourable of you, boy,” Bobby said. “But I think your brother would rather you look after yourself first.”
“I did,” Castiel said. “I believe it was rogue.”
“Handy,” Dean said. He felt a small swelling of pride hearing Sam’s plans. “Sounds like you’ve got it all planned out.”
“Castiel has not abided by our laws for some time,” Hannah said. “He is also one of the angels we are not in contact with.”
“So what do you do?” Dean asked Anna.
“Ah,” Dean said. “Probably what the comics are based on.”
“Mind you, I can see the appeal,” Crowley said as he looked down Castiel’s body to his crotch. “Why he’d want to mate you, I mean.”
“Lucifer is still part of the family,” Gabriel said.
“You make do,” Kali said. “Anyway, let’s get ready.”
“Forget it, Cas,” Dean said. “You’re stuck with me. Literally. Get used to it.”
“Stop burning yourself out!” Dean ordered.
“All you’d get is boredom,” Castiel said. “And the fact I believe you should terminate your pregnancy.”
“I imagine.” She glanced up as a customer entered. “To be continued.”
“Same,” Castiel said.
“Well if anyone knows it’s him,” Bobby said. “She’s stabbed him in the back more than once.”
“What are you doing in here?” Dean asked.
“He tried to contact us recently,” Hannah said. “We felt his presence calling to us but couldn’t make it out. The only word we could understand was your name.”
“It was,” Gabriel said. “But I bet you any money he hasn’t eaten today and just crashed when he got home.”
“Oh great, now you’re ignoring me,” Dean said. “Peachy.”
Dean quickly killed the engine as he pulled back into their parking spot. He climbed out of the car, again grimacing at the loud creak of the door. He hoped that Castiel was still asleep. Going to the rear of the car he grabbed his spoils and closed the door, heading for the motel room door. He unlocked it, pushing the door open and noting that Castiel was still in bed. He breathed a sigh of relief and gently closed the door behind him.
“Mind you he hit up his family for money when he wanted to start his business,” Bobby said. “I think they had some sort of deal. Gabriel met his end.”
“I found your list,” Castiel said. “I got everything on it.”
“Can’t feel love?” Castiel finished.
“The doctor just swung by,” Sam said. “He says you should be right to go home in the morning. He also said something about you wanting to go back on suppressants?”
“You are very kind,” Castiel said.
“You taking that to the bank tonight?” Dean asked.
“Agreed,” Benny said. He glanced back at the counter. “Anyway, I’ll leave you two to your dinner. Let me know if you want any dessert.”
“Because of your family?” Dean guessed.
Sam frowned.
Dean opened the bottle and tilted Castiel’s head back. He held the bottle against Castiel’s lips. Castiel tried to resist it but could feel the grace rising toward him like metal to a magnet. He inhaled, the grace seeping in through him. He instantly felt his body begin to warm, the power coursing through him as he took it in. He tested his bonds again and found that they were still too strong for him, a move that Dean didn’t miss.
Dean frowned. “How do you…” he scowled. “The bond. You sensed it.”
Bobby gave him a look of pure appreciation, smiling. “Thank you.”
“I got lucky. It was the last one left,” Dean admitted.
“Dean is.” Sam answered. “Dean’s trying to find his grace to keep him alive.”
“Hey guys,” he said softly.
“Anyway,” Gabriel said, checking his watch. “I better head back next door. We’re about to stretch out some more toffee.”
“Right,” Dean nodded. “So we shouldn’t expect to see Gabriel and Kali today.”
“Dad’s not here,” Sam assured him. “He probably won’t be back til tonight.”
-----O-----
Dean nodded. “It’s done. It’s over.”
“That’s because he had purpose,” Gabriel said. “Try and shoot the shit with him and he’ll just stare at you blankly.”
“Have fun,” Crowley said.
Dean smirked. “I help look for the Nephilim.”
“Right.” Dean grabbed the mop and began to wash the floors, wiping away the muddy footprints and puddles of water. “At least we don’t have carpet.”
“I thought it was about finding ‘Mr Right’,” Castiel said, making air quotes around the last.
“It’s already taken care of,” Crowley told them. “I am not going to have an omega in heat walking around Hell.”
Sam tried to register what was going on. If Dean was miscarrying then that meant that he was pregnant. His omega brother was pregnant. Sam knew that Dean would never have allowed himself to be in such a position and couldn’t help but wonder if Dean even knew who the father was. Sam worried his lip as he got them to the hospital.
“Aside from being able to kill you are useless,” Crowley said. “You can’t even smoke out of that body of yours. You can’t do deals without messing them up. Your first thought is to destroy everything you touch. And you refuse to kill Moose and Feathers which means you’re compromised.”
“So he’s gotten attached already,” Crowley said. “Brilliant.”
“Well you did say some pretty messed up stuff,” Dean said.
“Same as this time,” Castiel said. “Only I was alone in the shop. The barista who was assisting me had gone on break and for a walk.”
“You going to be all right tonight?” Dean asked.
Dean stared at their hands, feeling slightly uncomfortable by her touch. He didn’t pull away though, instead just choosing to ignore it. “I wish I could help.”
“For a mutual cause,” Crowley said. “Get Castiel his grace back and everybody’s happy. Except me, mind you. I’m happy the feather duster hasn’t got his grace.”
“I’ll send Rob out for them in the morning,” Bobby said. “He’ll get the last say on if we take them or not.”
Dean sipped his coffee to hide his smile.
“But he’s a demon,” Sam said. “He would have never allowed himself to become a demon.”
“Dean’s smart,” Sam countered. “Why? What’s he doing?”
“On more than one occasion,” Castiel said. “It is rather fascinating.”
“Holy crap,” Gabriel said. “You might just be the one to break through to him.”
“It was a team effort,” Crowley said. He held it out. “Now you do understand the plan?”
Dean slipped the First Blade back onto his belt and stood, grabbing his bag. It was time to go back to Hell.
Dean sucked in a breath as he saw it. It spanned shoulder to shoulder, the tips coming down Castiel’s arms. Big, dark coloured wings. They were intricately detailed with just the hint of rainbow colours to them but they were mostly dark. The tattoo definitely didn’t look as fresh as the ear piercing had been but it was still new enough that the skin was still tinged red.
“Is it because Cas is anti-social?” Dean asked.
Crowley looked at him. “Yes, your brother. I heard he died. My condolences.”
“Well, for a start, there’s something like 16 kids.”
“You do that,” Dean said. “Don’t starve yourself. Besides, I always learnt that the mind is sharper if you’ve eaten.”
“The one that went to college?” Dean asked.
Then again, Crowley did see how it could be useful. If mated to Dean there was less of a chance that Castiel would try and escape. And if he did escape then Dean would be able to track him. Not to mention if Feathers dared to try and plot anything Dean would be able to sense his betrayal before it happened. So maybe there were a few perks.
“Dean, I wouldn’t have suggested it if I wasn’t,” Castiel said, undoing his belt.
“It makes a mess,” Castiel said, climbing off Dean to stretch out on the bed beside him.
“Thanks Benny,” Dean said.
“Dude, she is so checking you out,” Dean said with a laugh.
Castiel blushed slightly. “I wasn’t interested.”
Castiel frowned. “I fail to see how that is fun.”
Dean wandered in, closing the door behind him. “Hey.”
“I will.” Dean frowned. “I’d tell you to say ‘hi’ to Dad but…”
“What is it?’ Hannah asked.
“Telling their dad ‘no’ for one,” Bobby said. “Running away from home.”
Before Dean knew it his lunch break arrived, Gabriel handing him a coffee scroll as a reward for his hard work. Hearing the door chime Dean looked up and saw a woman walk in. She was stunning, with dark hair and skin. She was a beauty to look at.. Dean watched as she walked around the counter and pressed a hand into Gabriel’s back, kissing him gently on the cheek as he served a customer. Dean assumed this must be Kali.
“Morning,” Dean said, flashing Castiel a toothy grin as he joined him.
“Anyone else got any problems?” Crowley asked.
“I’m sorry it’s just…” she looked up as the door opened, Gabriel wandering in.
“The Nephilim has been trying to sooth him,” Castiel said. “It is threatened by the darkness.”
He found Crowley seated in his throne, a glass of Craig in his hand and the bottle sitting on the arm of the throne. Sure enough Crowley had a sour look on his face, but he also looked contemplative. Dean knew that was never a good sign and wondered just who was about to bite it next. When Crowley was scheming someone always ended up dead.
“He understood,” Anna said. “I think he likes Castiel’s independent streak.”
“Hey Cas,” Dean purred. “Looking kind of rough there, buddy.”
“We own the distillery,” Crowley explained.
Dean frowned. “Was he in on it?”
“No,” Isiah said. “Naomi’s been doing that.”
“You don’t seem to have a problem with me,” Dean pointed out.
“It’s a start,” Sam said. “I’ve started running the scan now. Do you have any dates? When they were there?”
Michael offered to help and even though Dean had a foreshadowing feeling about it, he couldn’t really say no, seeing how there were way too many drinks to be carried. His gut feeling had been right, however. They’d hardly left their group when Michael started talking.
“That’s right.”
Dean looked up and over to Rebecca, who had spoken up during a lull in the conversation, gaining the attention of everyone around. Her focus though, Dean found, was on him and Cas.
“You need to follow your heart, son,” Harry added, summarizing his wife’s words.
his pleasure on his tongue… It was like nothing else had ever been before. Almost maddening in how right everything felt in this moment and that was the only thing that really made sense in Dean’s mind. Everything else, every insecurity, could wait for later, for he was sure that with time – and with Cas’ gentle guidance – they would find their rhythm in this part of their relationship as well.
. How was he supposed to answer that?
With what little space they had - big girl or not, Cherry still was just a horse and they were two grown men - Dean’s chest was pressed against Cas’ back right away. He had anticipated that, had known it. But the feeling still had his heart racing, the moment almost distracting him. But he couldn’t let that happen so Dean did not hesitate to wind his arms around Cas’ torso to grab the reins to get Cherry going. Even though he wanted nothing more than to close his eyes and inhale this wonderful fragrance that was Cas’ scent.
“No idea how I missed those. I don’t even remember when I fell asleep.”
Ready to face the music once more, Dean returned straight to the living room, no desire at all to have Michael catch him again whilst on the hunt for Cas.
It had never gone away? Cas’ feelings for him had never gone away?
“That’s more from him being anti-social,” Gabriel said. “I bet if you asked him he couldn’t tell you the last time he went out for dinner.”
“I have passed it a couple of times,” Castiel said. “I was curious so I looked it up on the internet.”
“You’d be surprised what Hell owns,” Crowley said. “Not all deals involve souls.”
Dean knelt beside him, catching Castiel under the jaw and lifting his chin to gaze down at him. “Crowley wasn’t kidding when he said your grace is fading. You need juice bad.”
“I will in a minute,” Bobby said without looking up. “Most old cars still go in print.”
Dean nodded cutting into his own food. “Apparently it’s all he can afford that’s close to college.”
-----O-----
“Ah.” Castiel gazed out the front window. “So Valentine’s Day is about sex.”
“Typical Winchester,” Crowley mumbled. “At least try to use protection. I don’t need a hormonal bitch lurking around.”
“Don’t care,” Dean said. “Nobody touches Sam. Not even him.”
“It is,” Castiel said. “He has contemplated selling the chocolate mix at the Sugar Heaven but decided against it.”
“That,” Dean panted, “is definitely the best sex I’ve ever had.”
“Partly,” Castiel said. “I also find more value in memories than personal items.”
Kali unlocked the front door of the shop, Gabriel standing with her with the umbrella until she had the door open. That done, Gabriel made his way to the sweet shop and left Dean alone with Kali. Dean made sure to wipe his feet before entering the store. He knew he was going to spend a lot of time mopping today. He dreaded it.
Dean made his way over to her, Anna stepping forward to give him a hug. He stood stiffly, frowning when she leaned in to kiss him. He turned his head away, Anna’s lips brushing his cheek. Where had this come from? He had made no indication to her that he was interested in forming that sort of relationship with her. Was Castiel right?
“So that’s why you wanted to work part time,” she guessed.
“He won’t take it, I bet,” Dean said. “We pull out our wallets and he’s going to complain.”
The before school rush seemed to pass quickly, Dean again noting that a lot of the high schoolers preferred the speciality drinks which meant Kali was extra busy during this time. Dean stayed where he was though, helping out when he could. He’d heard the names of some of the drinks so often that he had started to pick up on what they meant. He still wasn’t sure how to make them, but he knew the cup sizes and in some cases how much coffee they needed.
“They have,” Dean said. “I don’t know what you told them but Kali and Gabriel are talking to me. Gabriel came to see me last Friday at the workshop even.”
“Just making sure,” Kali said. “It’s going to be all hands on deck at Sugar Heaven so Gabriel and I won’t be able to come in and check on you.”
The rush eventually died down, Dean relieved to get a break. He sat down at a table to eat the lunch he’d packed, Kali taking her time to eat her own lunch while there were no customers.
“Bit of both,” Dean admitted. “Last we talked he was looking into what classes he needed to get into pre-law.”
“Well technically it’s about your family,” Dean said defensively. He didn’t really want to talk about himself and his mistake. He knew he was going to have to make up for it and he worried a little about what he would need to do.
“Yes, I remember reading about this,” Castiel said, taking the bottle.
“No.” Castiel said.
“It’s poisoning me,” Castiel confirmed. “When it burns out I will die.”
“No,” she admitted. “He fell silent after that.”
“Right. Lesson being don’t piss off Kali.”
“It’s Valentine’s Day, man,” Dean said. “All the single ladies are looking for a guy.”
“We are not working with demons,” Hannah said.
“Apparently a Nephilim exists,” Sam said. “They said they need to destroy it before it is born.”
“What we need for a summoning.” He explained. He took in her posture and frowned. “Something wrong?”
Dean blinked. “Felicity?”
“Yeah, you do,” Dean said. “They’re still your brothers and sisters. You still want to be accepted by them. I think you like being considered one of their leaders. Hell, you’re important enough to them they’re willing to work with a demon to get your grace back.”
“Just thought I’d come check on you.” Crowley reached out, turning Castiel’s head and inspecting his neck. “So he hasn’t bitten you yet. Interesting.”
“Yeah, I know,” Sam said. “He’s still pretty pissed.”
“Wow. That’s a massively dodged bullet,” Sam commented. “A being that powerful being raised by Crowley?”
Castiel nodded. “That is the general idea. When the coffee shop first opened it was open every Saturday but we found that there were very few customers in winter on the weekend.”
Castiel gave him a firm look that made Dean laugh.
Castiel grabbed Dean from behind, wrapping him with his arms. Dean instantly fought back as his arms were pinned to his sides. Castiel summoned his grace and cloaked Dean in it, pushing down the demon. He could feel the Mark burning on Dean’s arm, Dean roaring as he struggled to fight Castiel off.
“There’s no way I’ll get the grades for them,” Sam protested.
“Never said it would be,” Dean said. “It’s really your only option.”
“Sam, we’re concerned about Castiel,” Hannah said. “We have not seen or heard from him in some time.”
“Cas, you know Gabe doesn’t like it when you skip meals,” Dean said. “Neither does Kali for that matter.”
“Have you tried summoning him?”
“No,” Castiel said. “Even if a Nephilim is born of an angel host the host is still destroyed.”
“Sets them apart from the rest of the family,” Bobby said. “I’ve give them that.”
“No!” Dean said. “The only person who decides what happens to it is me.”
“I have to agree,” Castiel said. “I spent my younger years travelling as well. Stability is quite nice.”
“Cas,” Dean spat. “What have you done with Cas?”
Dean followed him back out into the corridor. The other demons were long gone, but the two guards by the door straightened as they exited. Crowley led the way down the halls to the room where he made his spells, Crowley gesturing for Dean to put the bag down on the table near where he already had various items spread out.
“Which is why we must eliminate him,” Hannah said. “We’ve already began tracking him. It will only be a matter of time before we find him.”
“The plan will work,” Castiel said as he stepped behind the door.
“Left you to go drinking, did he?” Dean asked.
“No,” Castiel said, his cheeks warming. “It was a… very involved kiss.”
“You may be correct,” Castiel said. He looked at Dean. “Are you really okay?”
“There is an element of truth to what she says,” Castiel said. “But it is vastly exaggerated.”
“He’s been there for seven years?” Dean asked. “No wonder he’s so good at it.”
Dean licked his lips as he looked at the newly exposed skin. There was something different about seeing Castiel get naked like this. It was entirely voluntary, and altogether hot. Dean quickly removed his pants, pulling them down with his underwear in one go. He hadn’t been wearing shoes so it made the task to remove them easier. He looked up as Castiel removed his own shoes.
“By the time you remember they’ll be mouldy,” Sam said, his trademark bitchface firmly in place.
“Hope he doesn’t stiff you on the bill,” Dean said.
Then there was Dean. Castiel swallowed, the memory of those black eyes flashing up. How could this have happened? The Dean he knew would never have allowed himself to live. Castiel knew the Mark was a corrupting influence, but he had never suspected that it would turn Dean into a demon. Then again he hadn’t thought Metatron would kill Dean either. He should have suspected it though. Metatron knew Dean was Castiel’s primary weakness.
“He is,” Dean said. “He’s the best. I miss him a lot.”
“So you say,” Dean said. He reached out, gently caressing Castiel’s face. Castiel turned his face away from him. “Why are you still resisting me?”
“Did I give you permission to come in here?” Dean asked.
“It would be in everyone’s best interest if you avoided her,” Castiel said. “She’s using you.”
“PB&J,” Castiel said, taking a bite out of it.
“Your brother gave us some ideas with how to work with Metatron,” Hannah said. “We have decided to implement them.”
“They are expensive,” Castiel said, pointing up toward them. “They also take a good deal of time to make.”
“So they’re religious?”
Turning the angel blade he stabbed Isiah through the heart. “No hard feelings,” he said as he watched the light fade from Isiah’s eyes. “Just can’t have you blabbing to the higher ups.”
Castiel raised a brow. “Have you slept with anyone?”
“Sure,” Bobby said, reaching for the newspaper Dean had just put down. “Just let me finish my breakfast.”
“Heard that before,” Sam called after them.
He turned and walked away, leaving Castiel and Sam alone with an enraged Dean.
“It was just a little fun,” Dean said. “You know if you’d just gone with it I wouldn’t have had to force you.”
“That’s the plan,” Dean said. “Is it really that strange?”
“I would like that,” Castiel said. “Our shifts do rarely align.”
“He knows.”
“Open your eyes,” he commanded.
“He would have massacred thousands,” Castiel said. “The Mark wanted him to kill. He had begun to kill indiscriminately although his main target appeared to be alphas.”
“Will you stop fucking saying that!” Dean snapped. His hand came down on Castiel’s knee, fingers squeezing hard enough that Castiel knew it would bruise. “I’m keeping you alive for a reason.”
Dean dropped the stick and rested his head in his hand. He really should have thought the whole mating thing through. He had been so preoccupied with mating Castiel he hadn’t even thought to worry about getting pregnant. In fact he hadn’t even realised that demons
“You’re just mad you became his servant,” Castiel said. “You were his little bitch.”
“No doubt Hannah or Samandrial will hear something and mention it to him,” Castiel said. “And he will call and check on me.”
“Except weed,” Dean said.
“Not an exact one,” Hannah said. “However he has named a city.”
“He can be quite vindictive,” Bobby said. “Never cross the Shurley family, Dean, whatever you do.”
“So you had a good chat then.”
“And their entire nest,” Crowley said. “Think you can handle that?”
“Remember,” Bobby told him before he could leave. “This is the last time.”
“It wasn’t lies,” Anna said.
“Been sleeping too much lately,” Dean admitted. “Now I’m wide awake.”
“It must be hard being away from him,” Kali said.
Dean washed up, changing out of his dirty clothes into something fresher and more comfortable. He then wandered back to the kitchen to help Bobby with making dinner. Bobby was teaching him how to cook more than just mac and cheese, Dean taking a keen interest in learning to look after himself. He still missed Sam though, knowing that the kid would have teased him for being so domestic while helping out.
“Well anyway,” Dean said, breaking the silence. “What say we drive around for a bit and then go find somewhere that serves pie.”
“Not thick enough,” Castiel said. “But better than some of the alternatives.”
“Difference is
“You mean YouTube?” Dean asked. “There are some good tutorials on there.”
“Smart move,” Crowley said. “He probably expects me to try and poison him.”
Dean shook his head. “He’s thinking about it. Honestly the kid’s a genius so he could be anything.”
“How did your father react?” Castiel asked.
“But he is skilled at it,” Hannah said. “It was his suggestion that allowed us to retrieve the information from Metatron.”
“One, that’s none of your business,” Dean said. “Secondly, no. We’re taking things slow.”
Dean felt his cheeks warm again, hiding it behind drinking his soda.
“So they got their just desserts,” Dean said.
Benny and Bobby looked at each other and shrugged.
“Metatron is not leaving Heaven,” Hannah said.
“What is it about Castiel?” Dean asked. “Everyone seems to like him.”
“Oh hey Sammy,” Dean said, not relinquishing his hold on Castiel. “Thanks for making us go on that date. It was awesome.”
Dean, but at the same time it wasn’t the man that Castiel had come to know and love. The real Dean was lost beneath the murky blackness of his corrupted soul, the Mark burning into it.
“It’s still weird,” Dean said.
“I’ll give it a shot,” Dean said.
“So Crowley’s useful to you.”
“We’ve been over this,” Bobby said. “It’s just ‘Bobby’. Enough with the ‘uncle’ nonsense. That’s for 10-year-olds, not 18-year-olds.”
“I don’t like leaving things unfinished,” Dean said as he pulled off his jacket and hung it on the hook next to hers while picking up his own apron.
“And you’ll destroy it,” Sam said.
“You’ve seen how he dresses,” Gabriel said. “He wears that trench coat of his everywhere.”
“Want it or not you’re going to get it,” Dean said. He ran his eyes over Castiel, taking him in. “How human are you?”
“Hello?”
“What’s it like getting robbed?” Aaron asked. “Did you wet yourself?”
Dean knew he had just painted a big, massive target on his back. He was going to have to do everything he could to protect this child. He wondered if he should tell Crowley or not. No doubt Crowley would insist, like Castiel did, that he destroy it. Then again Crowley would probably see a possible way of trying to use it for Hell’s bidding.
“Doesn’t she still work?” Dean asked.
Dean closed his eyes, focussing on their bond. He pulled down the walls he had put up between them. There was a moment’s pause before he felt Castiel drop his own walls. Then it hit him like a tsunami, as outpouring of love washing over him. Dean gasped as he was overwhelmed by it. Tears sprang to his eyes as he realised this was how Castiel felt about him.
“Huh?” Dean asked looking up.
“Including you,” Bobby said softly.
“Bye Dean,” Sam said, hanging up in a hurry.
“It happened a long time ago,” Castiel said. “What of your mother?”
Dean nursed his coffee as he watched Bobby go through the classifieds of the newspaper as he ate his breakfast. Dean had already had a look at the offerings in the paper and hadn’t seen much that caught his eye, but Bobby had his own way of looking at things. Bobby knew what parts were needed and kept an eye out for cars that had them. Dean wondered if Bobby would ever let him know the list and search for them.
