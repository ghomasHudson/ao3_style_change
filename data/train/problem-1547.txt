“Did you have contact with other departments? Other police stations? Maybe they received threats as well?” John tried.
Fortunately, there was nobody there. He took two cups from the cupboard and switched on the kettle. Only then did he notice that his heart was still reeling, his hands sweaty. He sighed deeply, trying to regain his composure.
At first, Mycroft came by in person to tell him, but after a couple of months, he started to send Anthea. The 8
John entered the familiar hallway and gave a sideways glance. Something unsettling grew inside of his stomach. He sighed and lingered behind Mrs Hudson. If he had known then what he knew now, he would not have given up his lease. He wouldn’t have left. He would have stayed, waiting for him. The regret he felt was almost overwhelming.
“How are you doing today?” Maggie asked politely. It was probably just a question to break the ice. Sherlock took a breath.
In the last 72 hours, he had returned to London to see his best friend again, who was supposedly dead and had to see him giving up. He had read Sherlock’s farewell letter to him, of which he had absolutely no idea. The words of it had touched him deeply and had triggered some very new and raw emotions, of which John didn’t even know he had. He then had to rush back to the hospital to make a decision on which Sherlock’s life had depended on. He had to sit there for hours and wait for setback after setback, in the hope that he had made the right decisions and that Sherlock would survive everything. And he almost didn’t.
“That wasn’t my… I didn’t…” I stammer, but I know he’s right. But when I open my mouth to tell him, the driver stops.
He had said too much and Sherlock knew he couldn’t save himself out of this one. His eyes flickered from Lestrade to the files and back, desperately searching for something he could focus on, but there wasn’t anything around that could comfort him. He was breathing heavily, panting even, as a wave of nausea hit him which he tried to suppress.
Finally, I fall on my knees and linger at the waistband of his trousers. I allow myself to glance up, so I’m able to memorize him like this, panting and wholly undone already. Then, I let my hands roam over one of the most intimate places of his body.
John was surprised to see that the gate was open. He walked across the schoolyard and entered the building through the main entry.
"Don't. I don't need to know what happened last year. I believe you are a decent human being and a great teacher, and that's all I need to know in order to work with you. We will deal with the rest later." John paused for a moment. Then, he gave Sherlock a small smile. "Now, I was going to watch a movie. do you want to watch it with me?"
“I think we ought to have a say in who’s on our staff and who’s not,” Mary interjected. “If you want us to work together, that is.”
It was nothing like the previous, chaste kiss they had shared moments before. This time, there barely was any hesitation left. The kiss was more deeply, more passionately, and Sherlock briefly wondered if every kiss he and John would ever share would feel unique.
“Yes,” Mycroft answered. He swallowed and tried not to show his emotions. Getting beaten up by his younger brother wasn’t one of his best memories, although he couldn’t blame him for doing so. “That’s why I arranged female assistance instead of male. It was his own choice to take on a male physical therapist, though.”
The loudness of John’s voice made Sherlock flinch involuntarily, and John immediately felt guilty. His first reaction was to walk towards the detective and apologize, but he saw Sherlock twitching when he made a move. Instead, John let himself fall on the couch, his elbows on his knees and his hands in his hair and took a deep breath to calm himself a bit.
So here he was, after more than two years, at a table in the middle of the café. He sat with his face towards the door, his body tensed, jaw set, his look stern, and waited for the detective to arrive. John had to admit, he hadn’t expected that Sherlock would agree to his invitation, but apparently, the man had learned a thing or two during his time away and knew that he owed John at least this much.
After a couple of months, I managed to gain some trust. That’s when they told me hacking wasn’t their only “business”. They had a… niche. They wanted me to help build it further, expand it to other countries.” Sherlock stopped talking. The hardest part was yet to come, and he started to feel nervous again.
"Doctor Wilson Is trying to save the upper lobe of the spleen. At first, it looked promising. She was able to dissect the affected part and just started to suture the parenchymatous vessels."
It was barely a whisper, but Sherlock’s voice cut through John’s heart like a knife. He just couldn’t stand it any longer. He pulled Sherlock to him and closed his arms around him. He held him tight, letting Sherlock's head rest against his chest. He felt how Sherlock began to shiver under his touch.
When John arrived at year three, though, it became clear that not everyone was able to deal with the situation. Molly was trying her best, but between trying to calm down two girls and yelling at tree boys who were running around, she had forgotten to count her class.
The click of the kettle indicated that water was ready. John poured the hot water into the cups. His hands were shaking uncontrollably. Closing his eyes, he tried to focus on his somewhat shallow breathing. He leaned against the counter.
John frowned, looking at his schedule. “Then I’m afraid he has to wait for a long time, as far as I can see. Send him home Holly, let him make an appointment for tomorrow.”
John regretted the words immediately and tried to adopt a more friendly tone. “You know you can tell me anything, right?” He paused a moment to take a breath. “You can trust me,” he added.
John had been there from the moment he knew Sherlock was back and had never left his side since. And during that time, Sherlock had noticed a change in John’s behaviour. Earlier, he would keep things at a distance, hold back on the touches and apologise or excuse himself if he felt like he had invaded on Sherlock's personal space. But now, he was more comfortable around Sherlock than he had ever been.
Mycroft waited for John by the large window of Sherlock’s room. When John approached, he saw that Mycroft’s nose had become blue and swollen overnight. That must’ve hurt.
From the first look, there wasn’t much to see. Sherlock started to look for clues, for any trace he could use.
I sit in my office and lean back in my chair, my feet on the desk, and my eyes screwed shut. The aspirin I took an hour ago doesn’t seem to help with my headache, but at least my nausea had subsided. Nasty things, hangovers. But then again, I know damn well that you never go home after a beer or two when you go drinking with John Watson. Especially when he got things to tell you.
This spiked John’s anger again, because not only did it mean that the last two years had been for nothing, but also that there was still a threat. He ran his hands across his face in frustration. “Do you have any idea,” he began, his voice low and threatening. “What I’ve been through these last two years? How much it hurt me? How much it had cost me?”
“When one is avoiding the attention of Sherlock, one learns to be discreet. Your ankle must be hurting you. Please, sit down.”
The first few days that John was away, Sherlock had been busy trying to discover everything there was to know about Moriarty, which wasn’t much. On the third day, he even asked Mycroft if he could get more information on the criminal mastermind as a last resort. Sherlock had to make sure he kept his mind occupied so it couldn’t slip into the depths of his mind palace because he feared that if he did, the recent event would affect him. But when Mycroft called with the disappointing news that there wasn’t much information he could give his little brother, Sherlock threw in the towel in frustration. He had yelled at John that he was afraid that for the first time in his career, there was a puzzle he couldn’t solve. But in the emptiness of the flat, it became painfully evident to Sherlock that John wasn’t there.
“Don’t even start,” John interrupted loudly. “You fell asleep in the bloody cab. I had to wake you. Twice!”
“He wasn’t,” Sherlock answered impatiently. “But someone has been here after the kidnapping,” Brandon clearly wasn’t a smoker, but there is fresh tobacco ash near the window in the bedroom. Marlboro, by the smell of it.”
John stepped forward and laid his hand on Sherlock's shaking shoulder. "Sherlock, what's wrong?" he asked gently.
Eventually, Sherlock pushed away ever so slightly. “John,” he panted, his voice low and husky. He let his forehead rest against John’s and smiled against John’s lips. “Would you like to get upstairs, so I can kiss you the way I want to kiss you? So I can kiss you where I want to kiss you… Do more than just kiss you?”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows at this. He had to admit, that was impressive. Hills was one of the most popular restaurants with an incredible reputation, and the fact that John had put in the effort to make a reservation at that place did say something.
Before John could ask about it, he felt his gurney move. “We’re ready to go, Mr Watson,” one of the paramedics said and pushed the gurney from the breaks.
“We didn’t know what to do. We know we had to go downstairs, but we couldn’t leave her, so we started yelling and banging on the windows,” Charly added and John saw tears prickle in the corners of her eyes. “Please don’t be mad.”
This was another thing John appreciated about Greg. He knew Greg wanted to know what was going on, but he didn’t push. He never did. Even though he was a DI and knew many techniques to retract information from someone, he never would use those on friends.
When Sherlock didn’t respond, John pushed himself from the man’s chest and looked up. He didn’t expect to see such a tormented, sorrowful look on Sherlock’s face. For the first time during this encounter, John realized that it would be possible he wasn’t the only one who was in pain.
John sat down with a steaming mug of coffee. He took a sip and sighed, clearly enjoying the moment. He gazed over at Sherlock. The man looked terrible. His skin was even paler than usual, dark circles underneath his eyes clearly visible. He also seemed more skinny than he was when he got out of the hospital, which worried John.
When they entered the classroom, John looked around in astonishment. It was a mess. A proper mess. The tables and chairs were piled up against the wall and in the middle of the floor were schoolbooks, notebooks, files and stacks of papers.
When he entered through the front doors of the school, John was greeted by a new face. An older looking woman sat at the reception desk. When she saw John entering the building, she stood up immediately. “You must be our newest addition!” she said enthusiastically, holding out her hand through the window.
Sherlock stood up and put his hands on the kids’ shoulders. When he walked passed Lestrade, they shared a look. Lestrade gave him a small nod in understanding, and that was enough for Sherlock to know he would do everything he could, which was one of the most comforting thoughts Sherlock had since John entered the burning building.
“Dr. Watson,” Dr. Wilson spoke before John could exit the office. “I know it may be a little hard to believe right now, but we are on the same team here.”
Sherlock opened his mouth to say something but snapped it shut again. He knew this was an argument he couldn’t win. They stared at each other, waiting for the other to say something, but nothing came. After a minute, Sherlock admitted his defeat, stood up from the floor and walked over to the sofa.
John turned around to face Alice again and closed his eyes for a second to keep his nerves under control. When he heard the click of the door falling shut, he opened his eyes again. “Okay, Alice, it’s just you and me now. Let’s get you out of this.” And with that, he started to check what he was dealing with.
A rush of shock went through John’s body. This could not be happening. He made sure everyone had counted and checked their students. Twice. How on earth could this be possible?
John felt his phone buzzing in his pocket. He knew it was Lestrade with an answer. John had texted him half an hour ago with a short update. With one hand, he took the phone out of his pocket while he nipped from his cup.
Lestrade eyed John for a moment before he seemed convinced. “Okay, that explains a lot. And how is he holding up?”
Sherlock’s eyes roamed over the parking lot, not sure what he was looking for. He searched for some companionship, for someone who noticed what was going on. But everyone was busy. Some of his colleagues did seem to mention what just happened and were trying to keep their class calm. Others were a little slow on the situation and were searching for what caused the commotion. He didn’t care. The only person he could think of was John.
He narrowed his eyes and looked closely at Mycroft. The man had not changed much. He still wore the same neat suits, the slick hairstyle, and still had the same stiff gaze and his umbrella in his hand. Yet, there seemed to be something different about him. He looked tired, almost exhausted as if he had slept very poorly for a few nights.
The fact that John had previously seen Sherlock in the ICU didn't make it much easier this time. He was still taken a little aback. Despite his height, Sherlock looked quite small in the large hospital bed. The amount of equipment was considerable, and a fair number of tubes disappeared under Sherlock's duvet.
When he opened the door, he was surprised to see a tall, dark-haired figure on his doorstep. “Sherlock? What are you doing here?”
John raised his eyebrows at that. “No, not at all,” he started. “Quite the opposite actually. We are kind of a good match together.”
John nodded. He wanted to say more but stopped. He didn’t register that little fact properly yesterday. A shiver went through his spine. He knew how susceptible Sherlock was to drugs. He also knew GHB wasn’t his drug. Heroin, cocaine and sometimes painkillers were his drugs of choice, not GHB. That only meant Sherlock hadn’t taken it voluntarily.
Both John and Mycroft nodded in agreement. They knew it would take everything to get Sherlock to talk to a psychiatrist. John suddenly felt tired. How on earth were they going to manage that?
John guides me through the crowd, into the hallway and through the front door of the building. He clearly knows where he wants to go, like a soldier on a mission.
John wasn’t a drinker. Weeks could pass by without feeling in need of alcohol. Yet this was the second night in a row he was drinking, this time a much too expensive bottle of whiskey from the minibar whose bill would eventually go to Mycroft. When he got back to the hotel room, he had immediately knocked back his first and poured in a second, much too full glass.
Sherlock closed the front door of the school with his keys. He and John were the last ones who were working, but when John started to complain about being hungry, they decided to stop as well.
After a moment, the sound of footsteps came near, and he heard a key scraping the lock. The door opened, and Mrs Hudson looked at John with big eyes.
John stared at his phone. He had four missed calls, two text messages, and one voicemail, all from the same number. When he tried to call back, no one picked up. He quickly sent a text message with an apology and sighed.
Mike frowned a little. “They haven’t hired you already? They are crazy not to; you were top of your class!”
Whoops. I played laser tag with my friends the previous week, fell and hit my head against the corner of a wall. I survived, but writing with a concussion isn't the best combo. But I'm back now!
John didn’t respond right away. “I don’t think you can do this,” John said softly, and for a second Sherlock thought he had lost John’s faith. But the doctor took a deep breath and continued. “I know you can. But if you want to stop, if you don’t want to do this, then that’s okay. I’ll support you anyway.” He reached out his hand and placed it over Sherlock’s.
Doctor Wilson narrowed her eyes and looked at John for a second. “Doctor Watson, I know you have to deal with a lot right now. But as a colleague, I’d like you to advice to put aside your personal opinion and look at this professional. My advice would be to go for option three.”
John put back his phone and made a mental note to take the inspector to a pub on his costs as a thank you.
John was glad Mike was the first to give his reaction. “I think it’s a great idea! I’m sure my students would love it.”
Mike didn’t reply to this but gave John a long look. John couldn’t help it but feel a bit uncomfortable. He quickly looked away and pretended to look through some of the work of the students.
John sighed and felt his anger ebb away. “I know you can’t. That’s why you need to have this appointment. And why you have to let me talk to Mycroft if I need to. You can’t let me figure it all out on my own. We both are on your side, you know.”
When they got back to Baker Street, Sherlock threw himself on the floor again immediately and hastily started rustling through some files. John stepped inside and closed the front door of the apartment with such a loud bang that it made Sherlock look up at John for the first time in hours. He narrowed his eyes and took the soldier in. He was angry; his knuckles white from the tight grasp of his fist, his shoulders tense, his jaw tight.
“How long,” John interrupted trough gritted teeth before Sherlock could wave his question away. “beforehand did you know what you were going to do to me?”
“A quarter to eight,” Sherlock answered as he closed the door and walked to the street to hail a cab. Only when John didn’t follow, he realized what the problem was. “Oh.”
John blinked. What? He looked around, but the man was nowhere to be found. Was this some kind of joke? He reread the note and contemplated his options. He could ignore everything, shake it off and walk away. But something in the note made it clear that it would indeed be best to be on the same side with this person. Maybe he should see what all this was about, see who wanted to talk to him. It would mean that he would be late for his date, but he could text Sherlock that something came up and he would be there as soon as he could from the car. He would understand.
Sherlock didn’t respond right away. He really didn’t want John to go, but he had caused him enough pain already in the past. He couldn’t do that to him anymore.
Sherlock shook his head. "I'm sorry," he stared. "I thought I could do this, but I… I can't. I need another therapist."
"Okay." John stood up from his chair. "Do you want to rest? I can ask the physical therapist to come by later this afternoon."
A shiver ran across John’s spine at the thought of the previous night. He couldn’t recall much anymore; everything seemed to be a blur. One moment, he was about to propose to his girlfriend, and the next he was looking in the icy-blue eyes of his former best friend. He remembered how he got up and how he heard the blood rushing in his ears. The words Sherlock spoke were utterly lost on him as he tried to fight the urge to hurt the man, to be the bigger man. But in the end, his anger had won. Not once, not twice, but trice.
“Oh, my God. This is officially the weirdest date I’ve ever had.” John snickered, and after that, he started giggling uncontrollably. Sherlock couldn’t help himself and joined a second later, giddy with everything from that evening.
John watched as Sherlock nodded, shook Dr. Wilson’s hand and walked out of the office without sparing John a glance. Something in his posture told John that something was going on; that he wasn’t doing well, and he had to fight the urge to go after Sherlock, instead of staying behind.
Reluctantly, I stretch out my arm. The touch of his warm, soothing fingers is so soft, that suddenly I forget how to breathe.
After seconds, Sherlock seemed to give up the façade and sighed. “I thought you wouldn’t want to see me again, not after last night.”
Sherlock seemed to realise the same thing and looked away first. He cleared his throat. “John, uhm…” he started. “I think you should know that I consider myself married to my work and while I’m flattered by your interest, I’m not sure that…”
John watched the bartender walk towards the tap. When he was gone, he felt how Sherlock bent towards him. “Thanks for the invite,” he whispered and returned to the table, leaving John standing at the bar with a blush on his cheeks again.
By the time John would arrive at Baker Street, Sherlock had himself so worked up, he decided to leave the flat to calm down a bit, which was why he was sitting at Speedy’s for the last couple of hours.
“I have an appointment downtown, so I’ll be gone for an hour or two. You better be sound asleep when I get back.”
Mycroft had sat down, his legs crossed, his hands resting on the armrests of the chair. John took back his seat behind the desk.
The examination was quick. Within no time, Dr. Wilson had taken a look at the incisions, had checked Sherlock’s lung capacity and heart rate, and had taken some blood to check the levels. She asked another couple of questions, and soon after that, she seemed satisfied.
It’s still early, not even seven, but some military habits never die. I don’t mind; it gives me time to cherish this moment. I turn on my side to look at your sleeping form. The street lantern and the beginnings of the morning are shining through the curtains, illuminating your features. They give you a mystical look, with your dark hair against the white sheets and your pale skin that almost looks translucent in this light.
John did his best to finish in time, but when the still buzzer went off, he had the feeling he was behind on everything. This wasn’t the way how he wanted to start the week. He sighed, stood up and walked to the door.
John’s eyes roamed across Sherlock’s face, and Sherlock knew he didn’t have to say anything else. He knew John was able to read him when no one else could; it had been like that from the beginning, and this situation was no exception. He would be able to see the struggle Sherlock had in the last few weeks with finding anything on Moriarty, the worry he had experienced that came with it, and above all, he would see the fear that was there for the first time in God knows how long.
Lestrade opened the door of the apartment without knocking. “Here are all the files Austin and Brandon worked on together. There weren’t many cases, but maybe you’ll find something we didn’t.”
When he’s done venting, Greg takes a large swig, puts the bottle down with a thud and eyes me for a long moment. “So, what’s going on with you and Sherlock?”
John felt the sudden urge to text Sherlock to see if he was already awake, but when he grabbed his phone, he stopped himself. The last thing he wanted was to come across as a stalker. After all, it was only early in the morning, and he would see Sherlock in an hour anyway.
Sherlock looked down at his hands again and fumbled with the sleeve of his robe. John wanted to take his hands and tell him there was no need for him to be this nervous, but he knew If he did that, he would scare Sherlock away, so the only thing he could do was wait.
John just looked at the detective for a long moment, unable to decide what to do. A part of him knew that he shouldn’t give in to it; that he shouldn’t give Sherlock what he wanted. But then again, John also knew the man was right. The faster they’d solve the case; the faster John could make sure Sherlock would strengthen.
As John looked closer, he saw that Mycroft was holding his umbrella more firmly than usual. It looked like he needed the umbrella to lean on so he could to keep his balance, which was strange.
I sip my coffee and let my eyes take in John’s form left of me. He sits at the kitchen table with the newspaper in one hand and his spoon in the other, eating his cereal and reading at the same time. A smile tugs at the corners of my mouth at the sight of him, so relax, so content.
John was halfway his story when an unexpected guest arrived. With a loud noise, the door swung open, and everyone was surprised to see Sherlock entering the staff room. He said nothing and sank on one of the empty chairs gracefully, his hands behind his head. No one, including John, dared to speak first. John looked around the table and saw that everyone looked both surprised as tensed.
John tried to regain his composure and cleared his throat. “Morning,” he said softly, trying to keep his voice under control.
Sherlock shot up. “I tried John, I really did,” he almost pleaded before John got the chance to say anything. “But I just can’t sleep.”
“Excellent,” Sherlock replied sarcastically. “Now, out. Or didn’t I beat you hard enough yesterday?”
John grabbed a chair and put it next to Sherlock's bed as quiet as he could, not wanting to wake Mycroft, who was asleep in the far corner of the room. He sat down and immediately grabbed Sherlock's hand. He ran his thumb across the back of it without thinking.
Mycroft’s eyes flickered briefly at the window where John was behind. “Have you reconsidered your refusal of treatment?”
John stared at the ceiling as he waited for the time to pass by. It was 5.34 A.M, but he was already wide awake. He knew he wouldn’t be able to fall asleep again. The slight excitement he had felt before he went to bed manifested in utter nervousness. In a few hours, he would finally meet his class for the first time this year. Twenty-six students were becoming his responsibility for the rest of the year. He wouldn’t just be “John” anymore, but “Mr. John.”
“All right, all right,” John called. The class was silent in an instance. “For this once, I will come and listen. But that’s just because I’ve heard great things about you guys.”
Mycroft cut him off. “Nonsense. The fact that you didn’t know and therefore didn’t approach him differently made him feel he could trust you again right away, even after not seeing you for two years. You were one of the few people who, in his eyes, hadn’t changed.”
The students started to whisper instantly. For a second Sherlock looked shocked, but he recovered quickly. He straightened his jacket and wanted to say something, but one of their students cut him off.
So now, Sherlock wanted a cigarette. If he was candid with himself, he maybe even wanted something else, but since that wasn’t an option anymore, he wanted a smoke. And he was going to in three minutes because that meant it was a quarter to eight and that the time Sherlock had given John to show up, was up.
Everyone was getting seated and was talking about their holiday. John looked around, but there was no sign of his partner. He looked at his watch. It was almost 10 o'clock. John was sure that Sherlock wouldn’t be late, something that became clear the other day. Just when he took his phone from his pocket to send a text, Molly sat down next to him.
“Oh, that’s a low blow, and you know it.” John decided to try something else. “Look, I know you are embarrassed about last night…”
Greg lets out a frustrated groan and starts talking. Before I know, I’m listening to a lively story while enjoying a second and a third, beer.
“Sherlock!” John yelled after him. But Sherlock kept walking and tried to ignore John. He knew it wasn’t fair. John would not be able to keep up with him, but he didn’t care. He wanted to get away from him as soon as possible.
“Ugh, stop it.”  John groaned and walked past Harry to put on his shirt. Harry followed him and fell on his bed with a loud thump.
Sherlock cleared his throat and tried to get his voice to sound even again. “There were different stages,” he started to explain. “First, I was the help. I had to clean the rooms, make sure there was enough equipment. After that, they let me be the host. I had to welcome the clients.” He paused. “They’d let me sometimes watch, too,” he added softly.
And after that came the image of horrid realization on John’s face when he saw the little red dot of the second sniper appear on Sherlock's forehead. That was the moment for Sherlock where he had realized that was it. It was game over. He wouldn’t be able to save himself, to save his friend. He had failed to protect him.
I walk to the sofa and let myself fall, determined not to get off of it anytime soon. I need to re-evaluate yesterday’s events and figure out what to do with this situation before John gets home. Closing my eyes, I let myself sink into my thoughts.
After long minutes, Sherlock noticed John’s unsteady breathing. For the first time, he looked up at the man, who looked down at him and gave him a glimpse of a smile. Tears were pooling from his dark blue eyes, but he didn’t seem to care. John pressed Sherlock closer against his chest.
But deep down, Sherlock knew that was not what he wanted. He wanted to tell John how he felt, that he liked him, cared for him and wanted to be with him. And not just in a friendly way, but in a more romantic way. If John was amenable, of course. But Sherlock did not have all the facts and to ask John how he felt about him was simply out of the question.
John watched him with concern and knew he had to do something to prevent that Sherlock would blame himself for hitting him. He reached across the table to grab Sherlock’s hand, in hope to get his attention.
“Oh, yes, among other things.” John took the lapels of Sherlock’s coat again and pulled him in for another kiss.
“You do if you want to keep your job,” Lestrade said. John knew from the look on his face that he was trying to stay as calm as possible. For a moment, John thought about interrupting their argument. But he didn’t know what to say.
“Everybody, listen up!” John yelled as loud as he could, desperately trying to remember what to do in a situation like this. “There is no need to panic! Find your fire buddy and form a line at the door, please. It’s probably just a drill, nothing to worry about!”
John stared at Mycroft, not able to get a word out of his mouth. Was he Sherlock’s medical proxy? Why? How? He didn’t sign anything, did he?
“There’s not much in there—just some basic facts. No names, no patient history. We want to make sure no one is possible to trace him down,” Mycroft spoke deliberately. John started to read.
Suddenly, Sherlock realised what was going on. Nothing was real; he just had had a nightmare… It felt incredibly real, though. He screwed his eyes shut tightly and reached for his cheek with a trembling hand to wipe the tears away. He was gulping for air, fighting to keep the memories of his nightmare at bay, to not slip back into the horrible flashbacks that had disturbed him.
Sherlock is standing near the window overlooking Baker Street when I enter the apartment. I greet him, but he doesn't acknowledge me. I take off my coat, settle in my chair, and take a good look at him. Something's going on, that much I can tell, but he doesn't answer me when I ask what's wrong. I look around, searching for a clue, when my eye catches something on the table - a small box. In it, I find a simple silver ring.
John turned around and walked back towards the crowd of kids. Suddenly, he felt a little anxious. What if kids were missing? Or if kids were panicking? He shook his head. This wasn’t the moment to let the kids see his own fear. He had to be brave. Otherwise, there would be even more panic. He just hoped that the rest of the staff could act the same way.
Lestrade closed the door behind him and sat down at his desk. Before John would take place opposite him, and Sherlock would stand so he could pace around like he always did. This time, Sherlock walked over to the chair and sat down, trying to hide the painful grimace that threatened to show on his face. John immediately walked closer and stood behind him, protectively.
Sherlock tried his best to create a reassuring smile. “Yes. Don’t pay for that expensive hotel room of yours if you are not going to use it.”
John's heart shattered into a million pieces. He wanted to scream, to throw things, to punch someone. He wanted to say that Sherlock didn't need to apologise for anything, but he didn't trust his voice. All he could do was give Sherlock's knee a small squeeze.
John suddenly felt his heart racing inside his chest. He felt a rush of shock run through his body, but there was something else too… Anticipation? Hope? He started to doubt his hearing. He did hear it right, right?
John raised his eyebrows. He had not expected this question. Of course, they wouldn’t return to Baker Street. It wasn’t theirs to come back to anymore. “I don’t think so. I don’t want you to have to kick someone out because of us.”
John didn’t bother to give her a proper goodbye. He stood up straight in his military posture, turned around and walked towards the door with firm steps.
When Sherlock entered Speedy’s café, John noticed he didn’t look like the confident, arrogant man he pretended to be yesterday. Sherlock’s shoulders were bent forward; his head hung low. John almost felt sorry for the man, but the bruise that had formed across Sherlock’s face reminded him of the events from the previous night.
“Then I need every case file from all of the victims from the last two years at Baker Street, stat.”
“Sorry, sorry! I know I’m not supposed to laugh,” John snickered. “You are an idiot; you know that? I’m not going anywhere, Sherlock. And I’m sorry I let you think I bailed on you. Please believe me when I say you are the most interesting, brilliant person I’ve had opposite me. And not to mention, incredibly attractive as well.”
John opened his mouth to reply but got interrupted by the buzzing of his phone. There was a text from Mycroft.
Hours passed, and although John didn’t want to admit it, he was starting to get frustrated. Sherlock hadn’t spoken since this morning, had decided he could go another day without food and ignored John completely. At first, John had tried to make clear that it wasn’t Sherlock’s fault, but it was no use. Sherlock had decided he wouldn’t forgive himself for the upcoming time and had thrown himself on the case.
“I want to look if it’s possible to make this project school-wide,” Lestrade explained. “That’s why I asked John to tell you something about it. Of course, we must see what’s achievable per class and work out the details, but I think it will be incredibly motivating for our students to participate. Any thoughts? Questions?”
“You are a hero; you know that, right?” Lestrade told John and patted him on the shoulder. John lay on a gurney, ready to get to the hospital. He didn’t know what to say, so he just shrugged.
Her face looked puzzled for a moment. “Will you come back to Baker street when Sherlock’s feeling better?”
John hurried to the sink and jerked the handle of the tap as hard as he could. The dripping stopped, and a horrible realisation hit him. A shiver went down his spine, and he felt a wave of nausea. During his work in Afghanistan, he had heard of an old torturing method where they slowly dripped water onto someone’s scalp or forehead for hours to get information out of them. It drove people insane in the end. Was this one of the things what had happened in Kosovo?
"What if," Patrick started deliberately after minutes. "What if John was the one to help you? Would that be okay?"
But John didn’t respond; he couldn’t. His throat felt dry, and his heart was hammering in his chest. He opened his mouth to give a reply, but nothing came. All he could do was look at Sherlock with panic in his eyes, hoping the detective would notice what was going on.
Once at the hospital, John hurried down the corridors. There was no sign of the hustle and bustle that dominated the hospital during the day. He hardly met anyone, and in the rare case that he did, the person was introverted and quiet.
Lestrade was visibly relieved that someone offered to help. “Yes, you’re just the man I need. We are terribly short-handed. Could you check if everyone has counted their classes and if they are complete?”
John stared out of the small window, his thoughts lingering. Once he had sat down, his mind began racing. He tried to ignore it, but it seemed impossible. To John’s surprise, he didn’t have questions. Those would come later. For now, he was trying to focus on the facts, something he had learned in therapy. In his mind, he went through the list of things he knew: ‘
“Nope.” I open the door, place my other hand on his back and guide him inside. “It was absolutely brilliant.”
John was already at the door to enter when two nurses pushed him aside and ran inside. They acted quickly and injected a drug into Sherlock's drip. In no time, Sherlock stopped kicking and fell asleep almost immediately.
He suddenly wondered how Sherlock would prepare the start of the new school year. Surely he wouldn’t be nervous, the man was confident enough to know what he was capable of and had done this before. But then again, maybe the things that had happened last year would be cause for a little nervousness after all.
“Of course not,” he shrugged, trying to avoid the conversation they were about to have. “I’ve got an appointment afterwards.”
He did not listen to Mycroft. Instead, John walked to the door, opened it, and gestured him to go. “Leave Mycroft, now before I will throw you out. I know what you are going to tell me. I’ve been around your brother long enough; I am able to
Second, I'm not entirely happy about this chapter. But I really wanted to write something for you guys. You have been patient and waited long enough.
John raised his eyebrow by this statement and looked at the receptionist. How could Sherlock possibly tell? He looked at her clothes and her make-up, but he couldn’t notice anything strange. Everything was spot-on. Sally didn’t’ seem that impressed and gave Sherlock a fake smile.
John turned around and looked at the receptionist with big eyes. It took a couple of seconds before he knew what she was talking about, but then it clicked. “I didn’t realise today was the 17
Lestrade sighed. “That’s not the point. You are under my supervision, and I want to see you in those meetings so I can keep an eye on you. You can start to cooperate, and I’ll stand down.”
Sherlock returned to the laptop and started typing, a clear sign that they were going back to work. John sat down opposite him and looked at the stag of files. “Should we start by discussing students?”
He hadn’t been here in two years, not since the death of his best friend. The place reminded him too much of the cups of coffee they had drunk, all the meals they had eaten together and of the conversations they had had, Even the smallest memory hurt of the man hurt like hell, and after months of grief, he learned that he couldn’t torture himself like that. Sherlock Holmes was dead, and he had the right to try and continue with his life. At least, that was what John believed for the past two years.
John nodded and felt a little irritated. It was the third time in a row Anderson had allowed students to skip his P.E. classes. Usually, it wouldn’t be that big of a deal, but with the school reports coming up he had to grade everyone.
I put on a simple pullover and black jeans, not feeling like wearing my usual fashion today. Those shirts and suits usually are my armour, but today, I feel unarmed.
Sherlock gave a small nod and looked away. As John walked past him to get back inside, he briefly took Sherlock’s hand in his own and squeezed a little. Sherlock barely got the chance to register it properly; John’s hand was gone almost immediately. But Sherlock didn’t miss the warmth and sparks it caused, which ran through his whole body after that touch. He wanted to take John’s hand back into his, to pull him closer, to feel his skin against his own. But it was too late already; there was no one left.
It took John a moment to realise what the man had said. He looked at Mike to see if he had heard it right, but Mike just grinned at him, his eyebrows raised. “Sorry?”
Sherlock took a deep breath. “If things are getting too difficult, you can go. I can’t ask you to stay. I’ll manage.”
Sherlock nodded, his eyes avoiding Lestrade’s. He didn’t want the principal to know he was barely holding it together.  He took a deep breath and allowed the mask he so often wore to glide into place again.
Sherlock didn’t answer. John walked a bit further into the room and looked around. There had to be something that triggered this. He started walking. His mind went a thousand miles per hour. There was no radio on. He checked if the TV was still on, but it was turned off. There was no book, so Sherlock hadn’t read something that might have upset him. The lights were on, so it wasn’t the darkness that caused him to panic. He went through the conversation earlier this evening. Was it something he said? Was it something he did? But he couldn’t think of anything.
Not missing the fondness in John’s voice, Sherlock looked up from his newspaper for the first time. He opened his mouth to reply, but his eye caught the bruise on John’s cheek. He raised his eyebrow questioningly, but John just sat back in his chair. Sherlock waited for an explanation, but nothing came. “John,” he finally said to get the doctors’ attention.
But Mrs Hudson just reached out to his arm and patted it gently. “I know dear.” Her voice was soft and full of love. “How are you holding up? You look better, a little tired maybe. Is Rosie keeping you up, dear?”
The fire-fighter sprang into action. “Okay, we need to act quickly. Peterson! Make sure three ambulances get here, stat,” Sherlock heard him say while he watched the man walk away.
“We need to do something,” Sarah said softly, her effort to not let her emotions get the upper hand clear in her voice.
“Dr Watson,” he started after a moment of consideration. “I think you ought to know he’s not himself right now. We don’t have many specifics on what happened to him, but it has changed him. I must warn you.”
He hadn't realised that he had been away from Fairlight Cove for a week and a half already. John had relied on Mycroft to take care of everything, and the man had. He had cancelled John's appointments, made sure he could take a leave of absence without any problems. But of course, Mycroft had not taken care of his personal meetings. Not that he had many of those, but this one was a long-time arrangement, one he took very seriously. This was the first time he had forgotten about it, and he hoped that his simple apology was enough. He didn't want to explain the whole situation. He even didn't know if he was allowed to.
"You did," he interrupts, slightly amused. "Come on, we may have mixed up the order of our' list of firsts' a bit, but I'd love to have a first date with you." He bends closer and presses a kiss against my cheek. "Plus, I have some other things on that list I want to check off tonight."
The tall doctor standing next to Mycroft was the first one who started to move. “You’ve heard the man, let’s go. We don’t have any more time to waste.”
John didn’t reply immediately. He just stared at Sherlock and blinked. “You don’t remember?” he asked eventually.
A moment later, there was a knock on the door. “Come in,” John replied, not looking up from his computer screen. “With you in a moment. Have a seat.”
Sherlock looked at him for a moment, his face unreadable. “Yes, please,” he answered, his voice much softer than John had anticipated. He decided not to dwell on it and walked out of the bedroom.
I love this weather; it clears my mind in a way nothing else can and allows my thoughts to wander. It lingers on you, upstairs, still vast asleep. I admire your ability to sleep trough this all. But I guess you are accustomed to this kind of weather. Because unfortunately, you’ve been in a much bigger storm.
John took another sip from his coffee. Suddenly, he felt the urge to tell. He needed to vent; he needed to share. It was just too much to keep to himself, even though he didn’t know he was allowed to tell.
“We’re complete,” Sherlock said at once. John glanced over the group of kids and came to the same conclusion. He gave the kids a reassuring smile before he turned to continue to year five, but Sherlock stopped him. “Is everything all right?”
“You can’t blame Sherlock for last year. It wasn’t his fault,” Molly said with a slight tremble in her voice. “Not completely,” she added.
The resident didn't bother to knock this time. When he entered the waiting room, Mycroft immediately walked towards him. "You better have a good reason for not updating us in time," Mycroft spit, trying to keep his self-control. The resident ignored the older Holmes brother and directed himself to John.
But John didn't answer. He stood in the middle of the room, unable to move. He started to feel sick. He turned quickly, grabbed the closest spit tray and vomited.
“Please Greg, don’t,” Sherlock tried and looked up at the man opposite him, hoping that the use of the DI’s first name made him realize there was something else going on. “Just let this slide, okay? It was wrong of me to do so, I understand that. But trust me when I say I wouldn’t have done it if I didn’t have a valid reason.”
The class quickly followed Sherlock and John out of the classroom, walked through the corridors, and up the step to the first floor, where the music room was situated. John was surprised to see it was a large room with college benches and a stage in the front of the classroom. Keyboards, drums, guitars, and other instruments were spread around the room.
When Monday finally came, Sherlock decided to go to Bart’s to see how things were going. He knew John had to teach that day. Maybe it was better to see him again at work. That way, they had something to talk about, and Sherlock could avoid some more personal subjects. He even thought of going to the teachers’ meeting that Lestrade had scheduled for later that day.
First, he checked in with Ella, who seemed to have everything under control. She wasn’t missing any kids, which was a relief, because the smallest children were the hardest to manage in a situation like this.
John nodded understandably. “That happens with PTSD,” he simply answered. It all sounded too familiar. “You know I slept with the radio on the first couple of months when I returned from Afghanistan? The whole night I would listen to boring talk shows so that I got the feeling someone was there in case I would fall asleep. It made me feel a little less alone.”
When John finally had his emotions under control a little, he tried to speak again. “You know,” he started, his voice hoarse. “At one point, I thought people were going to be right about us.”
Maggie’s words were the encouragement that Sherlock needed to start this. “I started in Ukraine,” he began hesitantly. “I went undercover in a Russian organisation which was settled all over Eastern Europe. They were specialised in hacking and were preparing a big attack on some big European countries. If they would pull through, it would mean the end of Europe as we know it.”
“You know,” John started, his voice sounding a little weaker then he liked. “I’ve planned his funeral at least a dozen times in my head? I even wrote my last words to him.” He sighed. “I hate to admit it, but I think even a little part of me feels relieved.”
“You did great kids, just wait here on further instructions,” John said once the class stood at the right place. Other classes came walking outside the building, and John let out a breath when he saw that his own class, including Sherlock, got out as well.
Sherlock just shrugged. “Since I told you what happened, you aren’t talking to me like you did before. You are watching your words. That, and you are texting more often these last couple of days which means you don’t want to be here. It’s quite obvious.”
“Okay, everyone,” Sherlock said softly when everyone was silent. “I want everyone to focus. We did a great job last year, but I’d like to keep working on our harmonies. I believe we can finetune those even more. We are going to warm up our voices, and then I want to repeat Viva la Vida. After that, we’ll start with something new. Norah, could you give us a C?”
Sherlock could hear the smile on John’s face, which was enough to let some of the fear fade away. He realised that it was all because of John. This man was the reason he was able to go home again, and for a moment, he hesitated to tell John everything. To tell him how he felt, to tell him about what he wanted to say when he had to leave him, to tell him about the letter. But Sherlock composed himself almost immediately. Now was not the time nor the place. Besides, it was too risky.
Sherlock looked down at his plate again for a long time, trying to come up with a proper response. “Thank you,” he mumbled and gave John a small, shy smile.
When John came running, there was a lot of commotion around Sherlock’s room. Mycroft was in a fierce discussion with one of the doctors, the other one standing next to Mycroft, both female.
This took John completely by surprise. “Oh, uhm… Sherlock has another appointment to get his cast removed. Is it possible to do it over the phone?”
“Yeah, I think we just lost our reservations,” John said as he walked up to Sherlock to stand next to him.
From the moment Sherlock and John were able to leave the hospital, the tension was palpable. They had stepped into the car in silence; both men didn’t spare a glance towards the other. John took out his phone and Sherlock turned himself towards the window. He was twisting and bending his wrist absent-mindedly, wholly caught in his thoughts.
The resident looked like he was about to argue with John. He opened his mouth to speak and then shut it again. Then, he just nodded.
“Hey, it’s okay,” he said softly and waited for Sherlock to look at him. “It doesn’t hurt that bad. Plus, I should’ve known better than to touch you,” he continued and gave Sherlock’s hand a soft, reassuring squeeze. “Rookie mistake.”
When he realised he was lingering a bit too long, John took a step back and looked across the room. It was a mess. There were files across the floor, half-drunk cups of tea on nearly every surface and empty cardboard takeaway boxes had taken over the coffee table. He knew he wasn’t going to get back to sleep now, so he started to clean a bit of the mess.
“In his mind, certainly. If you were to ask him, he’d probably say his archenemy. He does love to be dramatic.”
Mrs Hudson chuckled a bit. “He sure would be, but I’d hate to see him get overworked. He’s an excellent teacher and such a good man.”
In the end, John had decided not to dwell on it too much. Of course, Sherlock also had the weekend off, and he was entitled to spend it the way he wanted. Maybe he didn’t check his phone during the weekend,  did he visit his family or did he spend some time with friends and didn’t he had the time to check his texts. There was nothing to worry about.
John took a sip from his whiskey and looked into the fire, letting the thoughts about the last couple of weeks roam in his mind freely. And suddenly, another feeling struck him. Admiration. Because yet again, Sherlock started to manage to come back from this. John knew it cost him a lot this time, but in the end, Sherlock would win again. And that was just the thing that John frightened the most.
For a couple of hours, Sherlock’s focus was completely on the case. His attention only slipped for a moment when he heard footsteps on the stairs, but he quickly deduced who it was.
Mike looked from the man to John and pointed in the direction of John. “That’s an old friend of mine, John Watson.” But the man ignored Mike and took the phone from John and started texting.
John broke the kiss and rested his forehead against Sherlock’s. “All right, all right,” he replied, and Sherlock felt him smile against his lips. “You’re probably right. But God, I would love to take you inside now.”
Kyle shook his head in answer. “We didn’t see any fire. There was some smoke at the bottom of the stairs, but we ran very fast.”
John reached towards the nightstand to turn on the light and stood up from the side of the bed. He listened, but he couldn’t hear Sherlock downstairs. Softly, he walked out of the bedroom and down the stairs.
John blinked up at him and felt almost felt sorry for Sherlock. The man who he got to know the past week was nowhere to be found. Instead, there was an insecure, almost scared man struggling in front of him, and John felt a dull ache inside his chest. How could this be so hard for him? What had happened?
The 5thand 6thyears had loved it. They didn’t want to quit the lesson and practically begged to do it again if the weather would allow it.
He thanked the driver and followed Sherlock, who had already stepped out of the car and was walking down the street. The familiar image struck John. Although the detective didn’t walk as fast and confident as before, seeing him in his long, Belstaff coat striding towards 221b made that John couldn’t stop smiling the whole time.
But he knew Mycroft was right, as always. John always talked about “his friend”, or “his brother.” He couldn’t remember the last time he spoke out his name. Sherlock. It even hurt just to think about him.
John closed the tap of the sink, took his towel to wipe off the remains of his shaving cream. He looked in the reflection of the mirror and saw Harry leaning against the door frame of his bathroom. She was giving him a daring look, and John knew his sister knew what was going on.
When he did let go of Sherlock, it felt like a loss. Both men weren’t able to look at each other and shifted their gaze to the burning fireplace.
Sherlock's eyes fluttered open for a second. He looked at John, and John saw that he was fighting to keep his eyes open. John just gave him a little, reassuring smile. "Go back to sleep. I'll be right here," he whispered. Sherlock closed his eyes again, and within seconds, he was drifting off into the shadowy world of sedatives and painkillers.
It takes Sherlock some time to wrap his mind around what I just said. “How would you know?” he asks, his voice uncharacteristically small.
“They got a call. We tried to get phone records and track down the phone, but the phone that was used was a prepaid and only used once.”
“Will you just collaborate for once and attend the staff meetings from now on? I can’t keep protecting you, Sherlock.”
“Then why did you? Do you have any idea how humiliating that was? I know you have your doubts about that project, but you don’t have any reason to doubt me!”
Around 9, John and Sherlock excused themselves, thanked Mrs Hudson and went upstairs. Sherlock said John he was tired from the day and went to bed early. John couldn’t blame him. He wanted to go to bed as well but knew that If he would, he would just lay there and stare at the ceiling for hours.
So Sherlock had done the only right thing to do; he had turned around and walked back home where he had landed on the sofa to sulk for days.
John felt a blush creep up his cheeks. He knew she was right. Ever since their altercation during the last staff meeting and the confrontation afterwards in the supply closet, he and Sherlock had become much closer than it had been in the first couple of weeks. It felt like they were entirely in sync. They were on the same page about almost everything, knew what the other thought without saying a word and even finished each other’s’ sentences once or twice. And apparently, it didn’t go unnoticed by their colleagues.
First of all, I'm so sorry for the delay. It feels like an excuse, but there was so much going on that needed my attention that I couldn't find the time or the energy to write a chapter for this fic. I'm still absolutely, 100% committed to this fic, but it just felt hard to write such a serious fic with so much going on. That's why I focussed on Teach me ABC for a while; it's a little more light and breezy than this one (for the time being). But I still love this fic, and I'm not going to abandon it!
Thank you so much for reading! I've been walking around with it in my head for a long time now, so to know that you guys are liking it means a lot to me!
“Listen, John,” Mycroft started. “I understand why you think you want to know what happened. I could tell you the things I know if you really want to. But I do think you shouldn’t hear it from me. Sherlock will tell you when he feels he can. In fact, I think he’s already telling you things he wouldn’t tell anyone else.”
When John didn’t say anything, Sherlock took a breath. Even though he didn’t want to admit it, it wasn’t easy to talk about it. He preferred to keep things to himself, especially stuff about the past. But for some reason, it didn’t seem that hard to tell John about what had happened. He cleared his throat and continued.
Mycroft took a moment to arrange his words in his head carefully. He knew he had to act precisely. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to convince Sherlock. He had a plan: target Sherlock’s pressure point. And Mycroft knew his pressure point was John Watson.
John ignored the invitation. “You know, I’ve got a phone,” he said as he walked towards the man. “I mean, very clever and all that. But you could’ve just phone me. On my phone.”
John smirked and pulled Sherlock back against his mouth. He wasted no time and opened Sherlock’s mouth with his tongue. The slow, sensual kiss they had shared moments ago had made way for a more heated one.
“I’m done giving up,” Sherlock said, sounding determined all of a sudden. ”I want to fight this. I just don’t know how, and it’s driving me insane.”
He was about to sit down when he saw a man glancing in his direction. For a second, he looked directly at John but looked away almost immediately. John decided not to dwell on it, took out his phone and sat down at the table. Sipping his coffee, he scrolled through some news articles on his phone, deliberately not thinking about his date with Sherlock.
“You are aware of the fact that you will put his body through a lot of unnecessary stress?” Doctor Wilson now snapped. She sat down straight in her chair, her eyes hard as steel.
John felt a wave of anger flowing through his body. He had thought that after his panic attack last night Sherlock realised that it was best for him to cooperate, but now everything started from start to finish again. Today would be his first EMDR treatment, but to John's great frustration, Sherlock had taken matters into his own hands and cancelled it.
“I didn’t know, I saw,” Sherlock started. “You referred to this classroom as a place you used to be familiar with. But you haven’t worked in one for quite a while. Your face is tanned, but no tan above the wrists: you’ve been abroad but not sunbathing. You used your left hand to give me your phone but wears it in your right pocket, so you prefer not to use your arm for large movements. You don’t see a physical therapist for it anymore; they would say that you need to use the arm as much as possible. So it’s probably partly psychosomatic. That says the original circumstances of the injury were probably traumatic. Wounded in action, suntan, an old teacher: Afghanistan or Iraq.”
“All right, how about this. I’m going to the restroom, and when I get back you and I are going to start this thing from the beginning, okay?”
“What?” He turns away from the window and looks at me, and for a second, all I can think is how mesmerizing he is in the passing city lights. “I never send us to the wrong location?”
I really would love to hear your thoughts, especially after the last couple of chapters. We are finally on the road to recovery!
John watched him walk away and decided to get back into Sherlock’s room. He sat down in the uncomfortable chair again and continued to look at Sherlock.
"Let's start with the questions first, so I have a clear vision of what I'm dealing with here." Patrick didn't look up from the chart. "How accessible is your house? What kind of house is it? Do you have a bath or a shower? How many stairs are there until you reach your bedroom?"
“Sherlock, look at me,” Maggie said in a friendly but demanding tone. His eyes snapped away from John. “Remember what I told you. Try to act like he’s not here. There's nothing going to happen that you don’t want to. You are the one calling the shots today.”
John waited a moment before walking to the nurse's station. "Do you want me to leave too?" he asked hesitantly.
“Sherlock,” John started in his sweetest, most gentle tone that made Sherlock shiver. “As much as that touches me, you know you don’t have to, right? I am competent to protect myself. I am a soldier; protecting civilians is what we do.”
John snorted in disbelief and threw his hands in the air. “That’s not what I- You know what, never mind. I’m not having this discussion again.”
. He couldn’t’ think anymore, couldn’t focus. All he could think about was the feeling of John’s lips against his. They felt soft and firm at the same time and feel absolutely fantastic. He had never thought kissing John would feel this exiting, this electrifying.
Remember how I asked if there was a way to get into contact with some fellow Sherlock fans? I found them! So thanks for recommending the FB page, because it made me find Ughilovejohnlock and fireandhoney who are the best and helped me to get me through this writers' block!
Mycroft immediately turned around when he heard John, ignoring the doctor opposite to him. “He was declared legally incapacitated an hour ago. We need a decision on that to do.”
John heard Mike sigh a little while he was grasping in his pockets. “Sorry, left mine in my classroom.”
The class started their day with reading, followed by writing. After the morning break, they had spelling and math, and in no time, it was time for the lunch break. John was walking around his classroom to pick up some of the work from the children when Mike entered the classroom with two steaming mugs of coffee.
John looked at his watch. 03:18 a.m. It had been more than two hours since they had seen the resident. Maybe he just was too afraid to show his face again, but John could not shake the nagging feeling he had started to feel. He tried to remain calm and steady, but deep down, he was frightened. He knew something was off; the surgery was taking too long. "Something's wrong," he stated.
The group started running, and after a couple of minutes, John called them back together to make teams. He was in the middle of counting when he got interrupted by the incredibly loud whooping noise of the fire alarm. The class started to chat right away. Some kids were holding their ears against the sound, and some were panicking a little.
OH MY GOD! This chapter took me FOREVER to finish. I don't know why, but it took me nearly 4 weeks... I'm so sorry for the delay, this was not what I intended!
"Mr Holmes, I can assure you I'm the best there is in this hospital. Don't let my…" Patrick defended himself. John cut him off with the raise of his hand.
Sherlock couldn’t be happier when he got the news. He had been bored during this break. Out-of-his-mind, laying-on-the-couch-for-days, shooting-up-the-walls bored. He and John had prepared all of the upcoming lessons before the break started so they could have a decent couple of days off. He had tried to do some research, read up on some articles, and read four books in two days. He even tried to follow a series on Netflix which John had recommended. There was nothing that could keep his mind occupied. The only thing he could think of was his partner.
When Mycroft gave no further response, John dropped his elbows back on his knees and clutched the cup of hot tea between his hands. He stared at the steam rising from the container.
With that, the man just walked away, leaving John and Mike alone in the classroom. John watched the man and only when the door fell into the lock with a click he looked at Mike, who was grinning widely.
John glanced up at the clock, quickly calculating how long Charly and Kyle were gone. Three minutes, which meant that they should be safely outside and told Lestrade to get an ambulance. The fire brigade should’ve arrived as well to take care of the situation.
“The stupid Valentine’s fundraiser at the Met,” I clarify. “Sarah cancelled, and going alone is just pathetic.” I regret my phrasing immediately, knowing Sherlock doesn’t have a date. At least, I suspect he doesn’t. “Sorry.”
After finishing his dinner, John sank onto his couch with his second beer of tonight in his hand. He took the remote and started searching for a good movie on his television. Just when he found one, he heard the doorbell rang. Sighing, he stood up. He was not in the mood for company.
Carefully, he starts to push. Inch by inch, I feel him enter me. His eyes roam across my face in search of any sign of discomfort, but all I can feel is pleasure ripping through my body.
Sherlock didn’t wake up. Instead, he started moaning louder, clearly in distress. His movements became more violent; his eyes squeezed shut tightly. He began to mumble again, and this time, John could make out some words. “No, please…” Sherlock whimpered, and John felt his heart tighten in his chest. “Not him… Me… Not…”
Lestrade snorted in answer. “For someone who calls himself a sociopath, you are a terrible liar. Why did you do it in the first place? Even you must know taking evidence from a crime scene isn’t a smart move. Did you really want to make us do another drugs bust? Because you know we would.”
“I’m not sure that would’ve gone well,” John chuckled and looked at his watch. “Listen, we should go, I don’t want you to have to hurry once you get to the station.”
“He doesn’t have many friends,” the man sighed. “I’m the closest thing to a friend that Sherlock has.”
John's sleep was roughly disturbed around 2:30 by his phone. It took a while before he registered what was happening. Only when he heard the sound for a second time did he realise that it was his telephone. He shot up immediately. This could not be a good sign.
When Sherlock finally laid down against his pillow, Mycroft gave his shoulder a gentle squeeze and decided to leave the room in silence, leaving Sherlock and John behind.
Half an hour later, Sherlock sat on the sofa and was staring outside the window, his cup of coffee forgotten between his hands. He listened to the of the newspaper John was reading and sighed.
When they arrived at the helicopter, John and Mycroft quickly walked up the metal stairs, put on their seatbelts and put their headset on. Mycroft gave some instructions to the pilot, and in no time, they were on their way to London.
Sherlock looked down at the ground. “I didn’t want to do that,” he mumbled. He started to shift on his feet uncomfortably.
Sherlock didn’t answer. He didn’t want to admit it, but he liked John’s presence. It was nice to have a normal conversation with someone instead of living a solitary life. The prospect of sitting alone at his apartment for another weekend didn’t sound attractive at all. But what did ordinary people do on a Friday night? And what was a good thing to propose without crossing any boundaries?
Greg Lestrade was a good friend. Not only had he correctly estimated that John would have a decent hangover the next morning, but he had been the best company John could have wished for that evening. Without asking questions, he'd grabbed a bottle of whiskey, poured two glasses, and silently let John drink his first glass. After that, he had subtly started about recent cases at New Scotland Yard. This had been the opening for an evening of talking and drinking, without John having to tell why he was in London and what was going on. This was something John was very grateful for.
Before he tried to pick the girl up, he looked around the classroom, searching for something. If the situation on the ground floor had changed and the fire would’ve spread, he would want to prevent that Alice would inhale smoke. He could protect her from the fire shielding her, but he needed some fabric he could use as a mask.
“Because you deserve the best date possible.” John paused for a second, deciding if he dared to be a little suggestive. His eyes darkened a little, and he licked his lips. He bent forward a little before he continued in a low voice. “Plus, I’m hoping that, if I do my best, you will invite me back to your place by the end of this evening.”
“have you’ve been talking to some of your new colleagues, dear?” Mrs Hudson asked, still smiling at John. “He can be difficult to work with for sure. He can be arrogant and very self-centred. He doesn’t get along with parents, and most of his colleagues find him intimidating. But the children absolutely adore him, and once you get to know him, he’s worth the gold.”
“John,” Sherlock said after a moment. His voice was a bit hoarse, and it clearly took him a lot of effort to form his next sentence. He frowned and looked down at their hands. John’s hand was so close, so easy to reach. But he didn’t dare to seek the comfort he needed without asking. He swallowed and tried to get rid of the raspy feeling that had settled in his throat. “I need you to tell me you think I can do this because I’m starting to think I can’t.”
Doctor Wilson didn’t reply. John was sure she was holding back a snappy comment. It seemed to take her every bit of willpower to keep her professional attitude. After a long moment, she continued. “So then, which method will it be then?”
Sherlock turned his head to look up at John and swallowed. “It was you… Instead of Visar. That’s what I was dreaming last night.”
John stopped in his tracks but didn’t turn towards Sherlock. “Obviously,” he replied, his voice clipped.
But it didn’t help. Sherlock’s breathing quickened even more, and he started gasping for air. John grabbed him firmly by his shoulders. “Calm down; you are starting to hyperventilate. Stop fighting Sherlock; you are okay.” He tried, desperately trying to make contact.
When they were done, Sherlock pushed himself off the wall and turned to face John. “John, for what it’s worth, I did have a really good time.”
He frowned. “I didn’t. I wouldn’t be able to escape; I was too far gone.” But then, a sudden realisation hit him. “I think I had a client who recognised me and who contacted the government.”
Johns's train of thoughts was abruptly disturbed by two silver-blue eyes looking into his own. He hadn’t noticed Sherlock was awake, and suddenly it felt quite hot. For how long had he been staring? Could the detective deduce what he was thinking?
Mycroft decided he had to sit down for this and took a seat next to John. “Last time he detoxed with Methadone,” he stated.
John closed his eyes for a moment and breathed in deeply. He made it. He survived. He was going to be okay. He looked at Mycroft, who was also visibly relieved.
After a long moment, John cleared his throat and looked away. “It’s past lunchtime already,” he said, trying to sound casual. He looked at his watch and stood up. “Do you want to go to the teachers’ room and eat something?”
“I can’t do that, John. I can only rest after I solve the case. The sooner I solve it, the sooner I can let you hover over me. That’s what you want, right?”
Sherlock didn’t reply. He withdrew his hand from John’s grasp and let his head fall, unable to look John in the eye any longer. He knew what John was trying to do, but he wouldn’t let him. This was his fault.
He was fighting an inner battle with his conscience. Sherlock trusted him to make the right decision, but it wasn’t really his decision to make. Sherlock had already decided, and John really didn’t want to go against Sherlock’s wishes. He couldn’t. If Sherlock would survive this, he would not be able to forgive John, and that was something John couldn’t live with. But he absolutely did not want to lose him. Not again, not definitive. It was an impossible choice to make.
Before Sherlock could offer to take care of the tea, John walked towards the kitchen. Sherlock sat down in one of the chairs and watched him while John rumbled through the kitchen. He was surprisingly cheerful, Sherlock noticed. He had a small hint of a smile on his face almost constantly while he was making tea, and Sherlock wondered what caused it. He looked around. There was something different about John’s apartment, something he couldn’t quite place. His eyes lingered on the purse next to the sofa.
That was all John needed. He grabbed Sherlock’s hand as tight as he could and let out a quivering sigh of relief. “it’s okay, we’ve got you. I’ve got you,” he whispered.
Mycroft was waiting for him outside the room. He looked like shit. He was pale, and his eyes were small with deep, dark circles underneath them. The visible stubble on his chin and cheeks indicated he hadn't shaved in days.  His hair was tangled, and his clothes were wrinkled. In other circumstances, John would remark it, but he probably looked just as bad.
Sherlock let out a long sigh when his brother was gone and relaxed a little. He pressed his eyes shut and sank a little deeper into the mattress.
John looked up from his desk to see Molly standing in the doorway. It was Thursday afternoon, and he was finishing some correction work before going home. He could tell Molly came with bad news just by looking at her.
“Doctor Watson, could I have a quick word with you?” the therapist asked and walked to the hallway. John shot a questioning look at Sherlock and followed her.
Sherlock stepped back from John and straightened his coat in a desperate attempt to compose himself. “That’s acceptable,” he said. He gave John a small kiss before he turned and walked away from him with a broad grin on his face.
“Made me pull the trigger,” he finally whispered. “I couldn’t see him, but I knew it had to be him.”
The third method is a rather unknown method, mainly used in America. It would require bringing Mr Holmes in a medically induced coma for about two weeks. That way, his body can recover and get through the detox without experiencing withdrawal symptoms.”
Sherlock was about to walk away when Philip Anderson arrived. His face hardened by the sight of Sherlock and John. Sherlock turned around to face the man, his face completely blank. John stepped a little closer to meet his other colleague as well.
Mycroft didn’t wait for an answer. “Get out. Go get someone who is capable of handling my brother, because you clearly aren’t.”
It was the third morning in a row John had woken up like this. After Sherlock told him he was afraid to sleep alone, John had decided it would be best to sleep in the same bed, and it was the best decision he had made so far. Not only did he get the chance to be close to Sherlock and keep an eye on him, but Sherlock had slept like a baby from the moment they laid in bed together.
The first time it happens, it’s a Monday afternoon. It’s a typical Monday; it has been pouring all day, the clinic was swamped with crying toddlers, and when I leave work and get on the tube, I am stuck between a woman who smells like an ashtray and a man who clearly has undiagnosed Hyperhidrosis.
John walked to the desk, sat down, and started to read some documents. Sherlock started to rearrange some things in the classroom. They had agreed that John was the one who would start the day. Sherlock already knew the children because of the music lessons he had with them, and usually, John would be the teacher who the class had on Monday. Sherlock would back down a bit, letting John take the lead today.
“And I need you to bring their electronic devices. I’m sure you missed something. You always miss something.”
“Good. Start from the beginning. You don’t have to go into detail. Just tell me what you want to tell me. Take your time.”
After a long shower, he shaved with precision, got dressed, went to the kitchen and prepared some lunch to take with him. Since he was already up, John decided he would take a walk before going to Bart’s and grab some breakfast and coffee on the go.
He couldn’t concentrate. At first, John thought it was because he felt slightly nervous, but there was something else too. For some reason, it felt like he was being watched. When John looked up again, he saw the man looking in his direction for the second time. This couldn’t be a coincidence, right? Maybe it was someone he was supposed to recognize? But if that was the case, why didn’t the man walk towards him to greet him?
“Sherlock,” John started and tried to get his laughter under control. He took a deep breath. That’s Harry!” he explained, still with a broad smile on his face and waited until the penny dropped. But Sherlock just stood there with big, questioning eyes.
The next morning, Sherlock sat at the kitchen table reading the newspaper when he heard John coming down the stairs. “Good morning, John,” he greeted, not looking up from the article he was reading.
I started this chapter almost right after I finished the previous one, but then I decided to go play laser tag with some friends and fell on my head... Long story short and a minor concussion later, here it is!
John broke the kiss with a final brush of lips and pulled back slightly. “Even better then I imagined,” he whispered against Sherlock’s lips.
John spun around and saw Sherlock standing in the door opening with a smile on his face. He was taken aback for a moment but tried to recover quickly. It was the daring, playful look in Sherlock’s eyes convinced John to join his class.
“So,” John started, not looking up from the cup he held in both hands. He tightened his grip to keep his hands from shaking. “You found him then?”
John just looked at Mrs Hudson in astonishment. What on earth was she talking about? And then, he remembered. The note. Sherlock had put his name on the lease too. A small shiver ran through his spine. The thought of him being back with Sherlock at their beloved apartment was just too much. It was something he could only hope for. And then again, he realised that it would probably be a bad idea. There were just too many memories behind those doors.
John waited a moment before they walked further into the classroom and sat down on top of the instruction table. He watched Sherlock, who started pacing again with his head bowed down. John noticed that this was a different kind of expression than before. He looked worried, almost scared. “Sherlock,” he tried, but there was no response. He tried again. “Hey, Sherlock?” Still nothing.
It felt like the ground was swept away beneath John’s feet. He couldn’t have heard this right, could he?
“Then you have to find another way to make him listen to you.” Molly stood up from her chair and walked away. Before she left the classroom, she turned around. “I’m sure it’ll be all right. For what it’s worth, he seemed to enjoy your company last Friday.”
John sighed and decided it wasn’t worth the effort. He had, in fact, counted the class before they had started the P.E. lesson and had noted the absent ones. Besides, it wasn’t his responsibility.
John sat in his chair and stared outside. The little drops of rain where gliding down the windows. The sky was grey with large, dark clouds hanging above the sea. The sea itself was stormy, with rough waves hitting the coastline of Fairlight Cove. Just like it had been for the last couple days or even weeks.  On days like this, John could really appreciate the village.
“Sure. Why not,” I answer equally casual. I get up and walk to the kitchen before he can see the smile on my face.
They were silent during the ride; an occasional glance made them both blush. Their hands were next to each other, nearly touching, but neither one of them dared to reach out to the other.
“Good morning John, feeling okay?” Greg asked, looking up from his newspaper once he heard John enter.
After they had taken the elevator, they arrived in the basement where the operating theatres were located. They held their cards against the lock and hurried through the sliding doors. John heard a woman call after them but completely ignored it. Only when he heard his name for a second time, he stopped.
"Good. Now let's get you up and walking, shall we? Swing your legs to one side of the bed and sit up straight. Don't get up on your own; I will help you."
The man just shrugged. “I only work part-time and Mike here is far too eager to introduce me to you, an old friend who previously worked in Afghanistan. That’s no difficult leap.” The man started to gather some things and put them in his briefcase.
My mind does that more often lately, linger at the thought of you. Your room in my Mind Palace is extending; soon it won’t be just a room anymore. It's not entirely my fault; you’re getting more fascinating every day. I was already intrigued when I first met you, but now you’re becoming the perfect contradiction. My perfect contradiction. You are the doctor who can kill, the soldier who wants to heal… The ordinary guy who can make everyone’s head spin. Or maybe that’s just me.
“it’s not that, Sherlock. It’s that I understand,” John said and waited a moment for Sherlock to look up at him. “God, I understand only too well.”
And last: THANK YOU so much for all the kudos and comments, again. You really are the best, and it really makes my day. So I make you a deal: I will try to update as soon as possible, and you write me a comment. Sounds good, yeah? Thought so!
He was calm, in army doctor mode. This was a crisis, and he was trained in this. Someone had to stay strong; someone had to be able to make decisions. And John knew he was the person that job. This was what was expected of him. By himself, by Mycroft and by Sherlock.
Sherlock looked past her at John, but John didn’t look back. A rush of hesitation hit him, and suddenly he doubted if this was a good idea. Maybe it was too soon, too quick. What if he couldn’t tell him? What if his body decided to pull another trick, just like yesterday? What if it would be too much for him to handle?
And then, there was their new sleeping arrangement. Obviously, Sherlock had noticed their closeness during the night. He didn’t mind in the slightest. In fact, it was the only way Sherlock managed to fall asleep. It felt comforting to have John so near to him, knowing that there was someone who kept an eye on him. He really had tried to keep his distance the first night. But when he woke up the next morning, his body pressed close against Johns; he felt so utterly relaxed that he decided he didn’t care if John knew.
But in reality, Sherlock Holmes was starting to fall for John Watson. Hard. He just didn’t want to admit it, not to John, and not to himself.
This took John by surprise. Not only because he didn’t expect the question, but also because he no longer felt the anger that was usually reserved for he thought about forgiving Sherlock. “I think I already did,” he answered and gave the detective a small, tentative smile. “But it’s a lot, and you’ve got to give me some space to sort all of this out. So please, Sherlock, don’t reach out to me. I promise I will contact you when I can, but please, don’t push me. Not now.”
“I’ll ask,” John said while he stood up from his chair and put on his coat. “Sherlock, would you mind if I go back to my hotel afterwards instead of dropping by?”
Suddenly, it clicked. Sherlock didn’t come to him just to check how he was doing. He came to talk. And John thought he had a pretty good idea what Sherlock wanted to tell him, which made his heart jump out of his chest. But then, he realized what Sherlock must’ve been thinking once he noticed Harry was around and John couldn’t help himself. He started to giggle, and before he knew it, he was laughing hard, unable to stop.
He looked over at John, who was looking at his phone and was typing. Sherlock wanted to ask who he was texting but hesitated. A year ago he would give John a smart-aleck comment about it, but somehow he didn’t know if it was his place to say something about it. He continued to look out if the window instead.
When John entered, Norah and Penny noticed him right away. “Mr Sherlock? Mr John is here!” Norah called.
“And what about the fact that you had to shock him? Twice? I don’t think that that’s part of the normal procedure, is it?” Mycroft snarled.
The class immediately went up the stage and stood in a choir arrangement, clearly knowing what Sherlock wanted them to do. A girl named Norah walked up the piano and sat
The chapters keep getting longer and longer, but there's just so much stuff to write about! The struggle is getting real with these two... I really hope you guys like this chapter! I worked my butt off to get this one up, haha.
Dr. Wilson walked back to her side of the desk and sat down, but didn’t start right away. She waited and seemed to consider her approach carefully. After a moment, she gave John a small smile before she started speaking. “How’s Sherlock doing? From your perspective, I mean?”
Sherlock nodded, closed his new Belstaff coat he got Mycroft around his body, put his collar up and took his first steps outside towards the black car that waited for him and John to take them to Baker Street.
“Of course he did,” John muttered. It didn’t surprise him that Sherlock already knew he would come by.
“Listen to me. The doctors have declared you medically incompetent, which means I have to decide if they can operate. If they don't, you will die. Do you understand me?”
Again, Mycroft nodded, his face still focused on the window with a closed expression. John suddenly realised this was Mycroft trying to keep control of himself and his emotions. It wasn’t he didn’t have any, he just didn’t want to show them.
Oh no. John realised that he hadn’t told Mrs. Hudson about his divorce with Mary. How could he possibly tell her everything that had happened without hurting her? He let out a sigh and braced himself a little, his face serious. “Mrs Hudson, I need to tell you some, but you need to promise me to let me finish, okay?”
“I think that’s for a doctor to decide, hmm?” He walks over and settles himself next to me on the couch. I try to ignore the warmth from his hip against mine. “Come on, roll up your sleeve.”
Sherlock had expected that all of that would fade away once they returned at Baker street, but the opposite was exact. It even felt more natural between the walls of their old apartment than at the hospital. He knew that it all was temporary and that John would leave him to go back to god knows where, but he didn’t seem to be preparing to leave anytime soon.
Lestrade shook his head. “No, other departments didn’t get any.” He paused for a moment and sighed. “And we don’t want to check with other police stations, trying to avoid a lot of commotion. But as far as I can tell, there were no other stations who received threats.”
John continued after the attention was back on him. “Together, we will make sure you all will have a great year.” He smiled a little. “Now, let’s get started, shall we?”
“Oh, I uhm…” John stammered. “I hit the door of the cupboard in the kitchen when I was cleaning this morning. No big deal.”
Doctor Wilson continued. “There are different treatments regarding detoxification. I’d like to present three options for you. All three of them have good results, but only you can decide which is best for Mr Holmes.”
But when John had come home and finally allowed himself to calm down a bit, he realized that Sherlock once again had managed to infiltrate his life. Of course, he still felt furious, hurt and upset, but another emotion came at the surface as well: curiosity. He wanted an explanation, wanted to know how and why he faked his own death, wanted to know why the detective had been away for two years, and above all, wanted to make sure he was going to stay. John needed him to stay.
John stared at the note in his hand. Minutes passed by. He re-read it, desperately trying to remember every word of it, trying to understand what Sherlock had tried to say to him. But he couldn’t. His emotions got the better of him.
But that wasn’t necessary. The door of the room opened, and Mycroft tiptoed towards Sherlock and John. Without a word, he took Sherlock by one arm and let John get up. Together they lifted Sherlock on his feet and guided him to his bed. When they stood opposite each other, John’s eyes met Mycroft’s, and he instantly knew the older Holmes brother had seen and heard the whole thing. He felt his cheeks flush.
When John entered the room an hour later, Sherlock laid on his bed, looking at the ceiling. John didn’t know what to expect. It had gone rather well. Mrs Hudson had been sweet and reassuring, and Lestrade was able to pique Sherlock’s interest with some cases he told him about. But now that they were gone, Sherlock became silent.
I’d always known that John would be a fantastic lover, but in reality, it’s so much better. Every touch, every lick, and every kiss he gives me is with so much care that he makes me feel things I’ve never experienced before. On the contrary to what Mycroft believes, I do have some comparable data, so I know that this is something else entirely.
