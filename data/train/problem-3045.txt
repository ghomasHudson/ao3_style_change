Dean looked at him. "You can stay if you want to."
, but if this was how Cas was gonna do it, then that was fine. It all meant the same thing in the end.
as the Empty took him. Dean had known with absolute certainty – just as he’d known all those years ago when Castiel saved him for the first time – that he didn’t deserve it. And he knew now that he didn’t deserve Cas.
The words rang out in the room, seeming to bounce off of the empty walls, their faded blue paint. Dean heard them echo in his own ears long after the sound was gone.
His anger dissolved into panic and he choked, "No," bizarrely terrified to let Cas touch him.
"Sorry?"
“What?” he groans, rubbing his eyes.
He found the book surprisingly easily – he’d thought he would have to hunt for it, but it was just on a side table in the main room. He located the page with the spell. It identified the spell at the top as the

Over time the kitchen became more home for Dean than his own apartment because he knew: Here was always someone waiting for him, needing him. It was the only moment in his everyday life where he wasn't alone. Jo and Ellen grew on him and he knew that it was the same for them, being worthy, feeling worthy.
Sam could finish his warm-up and a long run through town way before Dean was able to open a single eye. But Sam wasn’t there waiting for him anymore – there was just ‚Highway to Hell‘ playing on his nearly dead phone; it was one of the old models you could throw against a wall and the wall would break. It was like the Devil himself said ‚hello‘ to Dean every morning, throwing ice cold water into his face with burning claws.
After the last beams of sun that had shone dimly through the milky little window had disappeared, Ellen came into the kitchen. She touched his shoulder with her soft, warm hand, at first silent and slowly breathing, then saying, „We already have post nine, Dean. You should stop before you're killing yourself.“ Dean didn't know when Jo and Castiel had left the bakery, he just knew he was alone again. Well, Ellen was still here, but just because she was the owner of the store and had the keys.
„Let's see how this new guy is.“ He grabbed one of the aprons hanging there and tied it around himself. „Why did Charlie even know before me?“
Castiel's huge smile disappeared as fast as it emerged. „You look distracted.“ He tilted his head a little bit.
"Dammit" was the only thing Dean said after he looked down upon the pile of paper in his arms.
Leaving Dean completely unaware of what was going through his father's head. If Dean had seen the look he probably would have been more prepared and not said what he said later.
“The world isn’t black and white John I had to learn that as Angel.” Cas spoke up.
What Cas truly wanted was to finally be able to spend time on earth with Dean, Sam and Jack, without the constant worry of what was happening in heaven nagging him in the back of his mind.
“Plus that was long enough ago that it makes sense that you are thinking of getting engaged. You are lucky I’m around Dean. I seem to be the only one who has actually got the brains to pull this off.” Rowena gloated, honestly she knew the boys were all emotionally stunted but it wasn’t that hard to work out when the story should reasonably start. Even though she would never admit it out loud, she was honestly shocked that they hadn’t gotten together then.
Dean was dazed as he pulled back slowly opening his eyes. Though he was quickly startled back to reality when he saw only confusion in Cas eyes. Cas may have kissed him back but it was obvious it was just to help Dean.
Which meant by the time John came back Dean was not only even more certain that he had made the right decision standing up to him. But being able to spend so much time with Cas without a crisis made Dean value his friendship even more, Somehow they had gotten even closer. They had always gravitated towards each other, Cas had never had a concept of personal space. But now they were never in the same room without touching of some sort, legs pushed against each other when sitting on the couch, arms against each other when standing.
“I’m sorry Dean.” Mary started, once Dean our down the empty coffee mug.
Should he have clarified what Bobby meant about Cas? Is Cas free from the empty? Is he in heaven? Can Dean see him?
Dean tried to be patient, but it was hard as the hot feeling of anger already seethed in his stomach. „You will. We're more a café than a bakery in the traditional way. That means you will see a lot of cake, pie and fluffy cupcakes which you will give to crying toddlers and violent children. So you should be okay with that.“
A big thanks goes like always to my lovely beta-reader soldier-dean (vesselofcain)! <3
„You should all try cat. It is very effective.“
As Dean entered the room, the stranger turned, the long fabric of his coat billowing around his legs. „D-“ He stopped, his eyes wide like they would see something they had lost a long time ago.
Charlie greeted him with a friendly wave. „New Padawan, right?“
„Well, it has to be“, Jo said, giving her mother a cheeky smile.
Ellen's Bakery was just a small place in a big town but it was more special than anything else you could find there. It was a location where the spirits of bumped people came to heal their damage, but empower their specialties.
„What do you have against gay people?“, Castiel asked while seeming more interested than taunting as if he would try to find the solution to a bigger problem.
Castiel laughed. Little wrinkles surrounded his eyes of deep sea blue like a contrast to the innocence of his nealy childlike expression. The dark of his eye rings was outshined by his bright smile, but only a second glimpse was needed to see how tired and decayed Castiel's hand rubbed his temple, the fingers trembling like the ones of an old man.
Life was hard, cold and brutal, pointed, sharp and severe - and always ending with death. Nobody could ever escape the fear of dying, nobody could ever escape the fear of losing. Law was law. So plain but also so branched.
Dean brandished his hands. „Dat's not NICE. Dat's gay.“
„It seems to be a very nice place.“
The man continued staring at him, his gaze burning into Dean's like a glowing light. „Good morning“, he said with a deep, rough voice, floating about Dean's skin as sandpaper.
It felt like Dean was missing something important like he forgot the solution to a problem. Weird. Just... weird. He didn't know why he pursed the feather, but he did.
place.
"W-what?"
, Dean thought confused, not even trying to let the letters upon the paper make sense.
In his apartment, Dean opened a bottle of cheap beer and threw himself upon the obsolete couch. He didn't turn on the TV. This time, he pulled out the black feather and watched it, watched it for minutes, watched it for hours.
Dean tried to push the off-button while groaning, blinking his way through the madness. Afterward, the apartment became depressingly silent once again. He rubbed his tired eyes, and stumbled his way through the bottles and outdated newspapers that littered the carpeted floor into the small bathroom at the opposite end.
He cleaned his teeth without a glance into the grease-spotted mirror. He flicked a dead fly off the sink and flung cold water onto his face.
, Sam's voice tuned into his head,
But while it was daytime, the building didn't represent any danger or problems with shitty gangs. In summary, was it a good place to hang up placards – even if they were pasted over with new ones the next day.
, Dean thought tiredly, and while walking to the closet, he accidentally stepped on a shard of glass.
They stood in front of the storeroom, the darkness behind the open door like a gasping mouth. Dean groaned and turned on the lights with a fast tip upon the switch. „Of course you will. Or do you think I would wear these damn tennis shoes for free?“
There was nothing special. Just frustration.
Sorry that it took so long, but we (my lovely beta-reader and I) had some technical problems and I also started at university this week :) I hope you enjoy <3
„Yeah. I know.“
It could have changed his life.
"Do I really need to kick your pretty ass to make you stop dreaming or will you get to work now? Son, we'll get huge financial problems because of your temporary dickhead moves."
(and already working on chapter 5)
„And mom trusts you“, she said more quiet, nearly whispering. „Mom trusts only the right ones.“
„I do not serve anyone.“
„Thank you, Dean. This is very nice of you.“
But it didn't.
"Dammit" did he say again as he tried to wash his hands and clean himself without letting the stack fall down.
„Because you're a douchbag“, Jo said from the kitchen in a sassy tone. „And I told her.“
„Cas?“, he asked. Then, he recognized that he just gave the new boy a nickname.
~ o ~
„I will have to change my clothes?“ Castiel's eyes widened, surprised.
And something in him felt incredibly right.
Dean didn't realize that he never introduced his first name.
It was the one he needed desperately, like gasping for air to breathe.
„What if I do not want to change my clothes?“
„No“, Ellen shook her head, „not seen here.“
Castiel smiled. It was the wide, unadulterated, kind grinning of child, showing pure happiness without any lies and secrets that needed to be covered up. It was so unalloyed and absolute, so improper in this angular face. But it was beautiful.
Dean caught himself by thinking about why the hell Castiel came to this place, and how his life had looked before. Was he a derelict thrown into a new world? The messy hair would fit, but for being homeless he seemed way too pure and not embittered enough.
That wasn't Sammy's voice anymore. This voice was rough and harsh, hurting like sharp needles that drilled into the flesh of his skin.
If Dean hadn't been asleep, if Dean hadn't seen enough of his poorly life, he maybe had recognized the man standing on the fire ladder and staring through the smudged window into his apartment. He maybe would have recognized his glowing blue eyes.
"You do the run today. Grab the sellotape and hang it up where Jo did it from last time." She sighed, then she gave him a motherly look. It was one of the kind that made Dean always feel goosebumps crawling over his skin, but also made him feel way better than anything else could - except a slice of pie maybe.
„Of course. I will do what you say.“ His face was genuine, the curved lips slightly opened like the ones of a toddler who was watching the world around him with excited fascination.
Dean had the desperate urge to facepalm himself but resisted by cutting the flesh of his callused palm with his fingernails.
„Of course I was!“, Dean protested.
„I am Castiel.“
„Okay... We go casual...“, he hemmed and rubbed his hands, grinning while trying to wish the awkwardness away, „why not.“
Castiel - who was going to Ellen to get more orders from her - turned his head slowly in Dean's direction, a small grin upon his lips. „Yes, Dean?“
That was why Dean loved this place, maybe more than he loved himself.
good at it. Maybe that was his special ability: making everything look better than it was. Guess he could work for an advertising agency, too.
Nothing ever felt worthy enough. That was the sad, bitter truth.
„He arrives at eight. Just check him out. And be patient.“
Okay that's not really in context but I just wanted to mention Misha because of... Misha xD
„Dean...“, she nodded, her face expressionless but her eyes excited. „He’s here.“
„No. My first name is Castiel.“ The stranger inclined his head in the right direction.
"Just do it." She nodded encouraging to her counterpart, turned around with a staunchly move and left hastily.
It wasn't like he was good talented at something reasonable. Not like Sammy.
She was also a sassy wise woman with a healthy measure of self-awareness and a healthier punch with her right fist if it was needed.
Dean shuddered and let his eyes rest on the corrugated brown rand of the bloody red spot, trying to avoid Castiels intensive stare.
„Fine“, Dean said and swore. „You can keep your crappy trench for the first time. But don't mess with Ellen. When she says you will have to doff it, you will, okay?“
Hey guys!
Dean smiled, too – the first time in weeks.
Ellen arched her eyebrows while Jo bursted into laughter, hysterically holding her hands in front of her mouth. Dean's eyes wandered to Castiel. He felt hot blood floating into his head, trying to make him blush so that everyone could see how embarrassed he was.
„Well, you will have a problem then. Do it, those are the rules. If not: leave.“ Dean didn't want to sound this harsh but he just said it like it was. The bakery surely was an informal place with people grunting at each other like family, but it was still a
He laughed humorlessly. Sammy‘s nerve-racking voice was everything he had left of his brother. What an honor.
It was nearly as odd as seeing unicorns behind a bank counter. Not that Dean would ever make that comparison.
She smiled, encouraging. „Go home.“
„So... What experience do you have in this work?“, Dean asked as Castiel stood in front of him, the face just a few centimeters away from his own.
seemed not fitting into this situation, but although it felt so painfully wrong, it was the only right thing. For Dean, it felt like everything in this reality – twisted and distorted.
Castiel let his eyes slowly wander down Dean's body as if he would burn the view into his mind. Dean coughed slightly, feeling very embarrassed. If a woman would have looked at him like this... well, he would be more as just aroused.
cool“, Jo tossed in and buried her hands into the box of glowing white flour which was standing in front of her. „Dean isn't, too.“
Sometimes he went a little crazy – no big deal.
But why would Castiel work a job like this? He wasn't even working as a baker, he was just a temporary help – but it seemed like he was intelligent enough to be qualified for being a professor at college. Dean knew that Castiel was intelligent – not only because of the way the freshman used language without any slang but also because of the way how he scrawled mathematic formula upon his notepad, which was made for the customers' bills like they were some kind of aesthetic sketch and not totally difficult to understand. And, of course, how Castiel observed the world.
„Dean has a bright soul“, Castiel, playing the hobby-psycho-analyst.
The pie was literally a flicker of hope in their cold, lonely darkness.
„Yeah...,“ he just said with an awkward grin. „I’ve gotta go.“
Dean loved to bake pie. He loved the feeling of his fingers digging into the warm, soft pastry like it was nothing but pure lifeblood: made to be great, made to be unique; he could make it into anything he wanted it to be. He was a creator of something what was made for blessing someone with better life - even if it was just for a second.
He played with the stem by rolling it between his fingertips, trying to remember something he didn't even know about. He pondered over the day, Ellen, Jo, and Castiel, and the longer he had them in his mind, the more grew the urge to jump up and just run until he was too tired to move anymore.
Castiel looked even more frightened.
Dean flinched, trying to put the words into the right order so that everything would make sense, everything would be great, everything would be fantastic.
Several things happened at once.
“I said I’m fine, Cas.” It came out more harshly than Dean intended, and Cas took a step back, his eyes shuttering. Instinctively Dean wanted to reach out to him, hold him there, but he still felt the memory of the dream on him – abstract and intangible now but still bothering him like a bad taste in the back of his mouth.
smell, and he brought his hands up to fist them in the front of Cas’ trenchcoat sort of helplessly, trying to tug him closer even though they were already about as close as they could easily get.
Dean plastered on a practiced, friendly smile and showed her a business card that claimed he was a lawyer specializing in wills and inheritance. “Are you Adelaide Moriarty?”
Castiel gave him a soft, slightly sad smile. “I’m not going anywhere, Dean.” He reached out and took Dean’s grasping hand, his skin cool and dry against Dean’s. Dean hadn’t even realized he’d been looking for Cas’s hand, but he was certain now that he had been.
Cas seemed to be thinking. "Yes," he said slowly. "I want that too."
“It’s kind of what we do, you know,” Cas told him. “We work out our shit.”
There were drunk college students somewhere outside. Shouts and laughter floated in through the open window, cutting through the quiet in the room like a sharpened knife.
– for a second. The shape of it in Cas’ mouth – and then the shape of Cas’ mouth. Then he snapped out of it. “No, I thought I should tell him in person,” he said casually. “I mean, I didn’t even really know I liked dudes, so it’s not like Sam’s gonna have any idea.” At least, he hoped not. “Also, I’m gonna have to freak out about that at some point, by the way.”
Charlie disappears into her room and comes back a moment later with an armful of books. “Anyways, I’ve got another exam today to study for. I’ll see you later?”
“You knew about that?” Dean was surprised. And annoyed.
Cas was looking at Dean, but at this he shifted his gaze to Sam. “Dean’s right, Sam. You should stay here.”
When he drew the blade back, preparing to swing it in a clean, brutal arc, the vampire threw his hands up, shouting, “Wait!” just as Dean had known he would.
Dean opened his eyes. “Cas?” he replied, trying to sound neutral.
“I have a lot of shit to work out, I guess.” Dean laughed a little shakily. “But if you’ll have me – if you want me –” Dean felt his self-control slipping, his fingers stilling on Cas’ hand. “I mean – you know. We can do that. Be together, I mean.” He flushed, feeling stupid.
"Gotta go," Dean says, and he hangs up on Sam's muffed protests.
"Great."
"I don't know, I told him that was great."
Dean groaned. “I’m just pissed because he took the tablet and fucked off again, okay? Not to mention that then he went and lost it.”
The first time Castiel saved Dean’s life, he didn’t thank him.
Keeping his eyes on the vampire, Dean pushed him ahead first, then shoved his way through the bushes after him. He’d been right – they were, in fact, in a clearing.
“Yeah,” Dean agreed. “It does.”
He remembered thinking – knowing – that Cas wouldn’t hurt him – it was
“Let me guess,” Dean said. “You’re here for the “I told you so”.”
Cas smiled. “Yes. Ding ding ding.”
But Benny was nodding, seeming to know better than Dean himself what he’d meant. He takes a swig from his beer and says, “I get it. You’re hung up on someone.” He laughs. “Man, for a second there I was worried you were gonna say you were straight.”
Sam didn’t reply, only opened the door for Dean with an air of resignation.
But then sex during the day when no one was home turned into spending the night, turned into breakfast the next morning. Turned into Dean showing Cas his favorite movies, his favorite books, accidentally mentioning him to Sam.
was to be good." Cas sighed. "I realize now, good intentions are just the curse of free will."
Cas had a strange look on his face. “So,” he said. “We can’t do…” and he gestured to himself and then to Dean with one hand, neatly encapsulating everything that had happened between them in one smooth motion, “…
Dean snorted. “Yeah, and look where it’s gotten us.”
“Still alive,” Sam confirmed, sounding reasonably healthy.
Cas smiled wryly. “Three days ago, you thought there was no such thing as me.” Dean couldn’t help but stare. “Why do you think we’re here, walking among you now for the first time in 2000 years?”
“I feel…” Dean thought about it. “Okay.”
“’M gonna fail,” Dean muttered to the table. He went to hit his head on the table once more for good measure, and felt Cas’ fingers in his hair, gentle but insistent, preventing him. He carded both hands through Dean’s hair, close to his scalp, one on either side of his head, holding him firmly still.
“I see,” said Cas. The smile was coming back slowly, in degrees. Dean was glad. “Well, I guess we’ll both have nothing to do for a few weeks.” Looking thoughtful, he finished off the last bit of ice cream, Dean watching.
Cas’ eyes followed the movement. He took a second to respond, shrugging, “Not really. This book is rather dry, even for me.”
“I’ve already apologized to you, Dean. It’s up to you if you want to forgive me. I just want you to know that I thought I was doing the right thing when I took the tablet.” Cas hesitated, looking at the empty plate between them. “I… I’ve done so much wrong. I thought that I had to fix it alone. I thought the only way
Cas looked both vindicated and angrier than before. "So, what?" He spread his hands exaggeratedly. "You just hate me now? That's it?"
Cas’ hands clenched in his lap. “Are we alright?”
“Well, thanks a lot for the angelic assistance,” Dean growled. “You know I almost got my heart ripped out of my chest?”
In the dream, everything is simpler. Dean isn’t himself, or at least, he’s a different version of himself, one who Cas would want to stay with. One who didn’t carry around all of the baggage Dean can’t rid himself of. In the dream, he doesn’t drink, he doesn’t have to distract himself, and he’s with Cas. He’s happy.
“Well, Cas sounded upset when I talked to him, and you’re being – well, you,” Sam said.
He froze, surprised. "Yeah, yes, that's fine," he hastened to say.
“Cas and I will go check it out,” Sam finished. He looked a little exasperated, as well as more than a little tired, his face drawn and seeming to pull downwards with exhaustion. The invigoration of successful research seemed to have left him and he slumped over the table, elbows holding him up like the supports of a bridge.
“We’re inheritance lawyers. May we come in?”
“What?” Cas was trying to pick him up off the ground. “Are you
Apparently Sam and Eileen had wanted to come home when Cas called them, but he’d talked them out of it, saying he was handling it. It had occurred to Dean that Castiel had been protecting him in his subtle way, letting Dean suffer his indignity with minimal spectators. He was grateful, although he was trying not to think about the whole episode in general.
“So,” Dean started up again, shifting awkwardly, “your grandmother. Were you two close?”
"Oh," he said. "Right."
Dean bit back a retort and kicked the wall of the building with the toe of his boot. “There’s nothing to
Finally getting his laptop safely onto the bed, he flips it open and settles down to watch All Saints' Day 3: The Reckoning. Not his favorite, but still good. He would have watched his favorite in the film series, All Saints' Day 4: Hatchet Man Lives, but he had watched it recently. Well, if a month ago is recent. It had been with Cas.
He realized that was the weight that had been lifted from him – the weight of all those words. Dean realized that he had desperately wanted to tell Cas – wanted him to
After he finishes lunch, he goes back to bed. He scrolls through various social medias for a while, distracting himself. Reads a couple of pages of his book. His eyelids start to feel heavy, his breathing slows, and soon he falls asleep.
They smiled. “Oh, how tragic,” they said. “He doesn’t. And now he never will.”
He tried to glower at Castiel, squinting his eyes in pain. Cas glowered right back, except it was more intimidating on him.
Cas said, “I’m doing a semester abroad.”
“Go.” Dean lowered the blade and used it to prod the vampire in the back to get him moving.
“Navigation is so much easier by wing,” Cas grumbled. “All of these streets and highways you humans have built, they’re so needlessly complicated.”
, really.
Dean’s eyes flew back up to his face, his heart thudding against his ribcage like a small bird. “Oh,” he managed to say.
He’s starting to feel a little sick. Maybe the grilled cheese didn’t agree with him – he isn’t sure how old that cheese was, now that he’s thinking about it, or maybe it’s all the memories of Cas, knowing that it was over now, lost to time.
Dean looked up, frowning. “Did you – did you think I wasn’t gonna tell him?”
“So you and Cas made up, huh?” Sam sounded almost on the verge of laughter.
That’s what he was thinking as he got ready to leave for what was sure to be the most painful road trip he’d ever experienced, and that was including the one when he had to drive five hours back to the motel with a broken arm and a nasty ghoul bite.
Adelaide ignored him. “What did you say your names were again?”
Okay, he thought. So the angels think I can somehow save an entire planet’s worth of people. Okay. Fine. That’s not my problem. He wiped the remnants of tears from his eyes with the back of his arm, stinging the cuts on his cheeks, and then ripped the IV out of his arm.
He indicates his glass and replies, “I’m good, thanks.”
“You’re up late,” he said by way of greeting.
, mostly to feel the movement of Cas’ fingers as he did so.
Charlie and Garth are worried about him, he knows. He doesn’t usually stay in his room for an entire day, and they had both caught on that something had happened the previous day, although presumably they don’t know what.
When he goes to make coffee, he finds that the milk is expired. Not expired as in past its best-before date but probably still good; nope, expired as in foul-smelling and full of suspicious chunks. This discovery comes after he’d already poured it into his coffee, of course.
Cas didn’t respond, turning the map ninety degrees instead. “Maybe we should ask someone for directions.”
Dean sputtered, feeling disproportionately flustered. “Well – not something
But that was then, and this was now, a few months later, when Sam and Eileen had left for some romantic getaway in Miami (of all places), leaving Dean and Cas alone together in the bunker – going on cases alone together, eating meals alone together, watching the new season of American Horror Story alone together. And it was getting
Dean considers this last, but he can’t stomach the idea of any kind of party at the moment. He shrugs. “I’m good. Catching up on some sleep.”
“Uh, well, we thought – you know – her name sounded English,” Dean improvised. Throwing caution to the wind, he continued, “We have records of an incident taking place in the late 1800s. Would you know anything about that? Maybe family stories? Maybe a personality change after it happened?”
"Yeah?"
“What is it?” Cas answered immediately.
He’s sipping a whiskey, neat, when someone slips onto the stool next to him.
Dean showered and got dressed, all the while uncomfortably aware of Cas – who was somehow still reading the same book – in the other room. Grabbing his keys with one boot half on, he paused, looking at him. “Coffee, Cas?”
Over the next few days, Dean avoided Cas as much as possible, which he couldn’t do very well considering that they were alone together in an underground bunker literally sealed off from the outside world.
“Well, you guys must have had a good talk. You sound much happier today.”
have to stop it.”
Castiel was confused. “I told you.”
Cas smiled at him, so faint that Dean almost thought he was imagining it.
Dean was still thinking about hand gestures, as well as their corollary: Cas’ hands. And about France. Or, more accurately, the distance between here and France. He tried to mold his face into an expression of detached nonchalance, most likely failing miserably, and agreed, with only a tenuous grasp of what he was agreeing to, “Yeah.”
Dean swallowed, unable to speak. He was close enough to see the strange juxtaposition of the ordinary blue of the angel’s eyes against the pupils, eerily contracted despite the dim light of the kitchen. He seemed more angel than man. As if his true form was somehow eclipsing the vessel.
Sam hesitated before answering. “Uh. This morning.”
“I’ve only been on Earth for a few years now, but it seems to me that love makes you stronger.” Cas paused. “Not weaker.”
He sits back down on the bed, wincing, and gingerly picks up the two chunks of glass, throws them away. The cut on his foot stings but isn’t bad, with blood just barely beginning to well up.
Cas watched in alarm as Dean rose unsteadily from the bed and went to the closet for his clothes. “Where are you going?”
“I know,” Castiel said simply.
“So how are you and Cas?”
Cas just shrugged, apparently unbothered. Despite himself, Dean felt a grin spread over his face, slow and warm.
Garth looks like he wants to say something else, but Charlie tugs him out of the room before he can, closing the door behind them. Dean hears their whispered voices fade as they move away, and slumps back against his pillows.
Cas smiled in sleepy relief. “Good.” He closed his eyes again.
More than once, Dean turned onto a side road that ended in a dead end and had to backtrack to the main road. Meanwhile, Cas squinted at a map he’d pulled out of the Impala’s glove compartment that Dean was fairly certain didn’t even have Philadelphia on it and was also probably from the 80’s.
“Dean?”
Cas hummed behind him, low in his throat. “You’re not going to fail,” he said. “You know this material. You’ve studied it all semester.”
“Hey, I’m gonna call Sam.” Dean pointed to the phone.
– to say it.”
But that was then and this was now, and now he was just Cas and Dean was just Dean, neither of them an Angel of the Lord or the Righteous Man or the Michael Sword anymore.
Dean stared at him. Cas had his long coat on, the one that Dean liked. His hair was damp from the drizzle that had been going on and off all day, falling loosely to get in his eyes. He had already pushed it back once while he’d been there. He needed a haircut, Dean thought absently.
Dean knew Cas didn’t need sleep, but that he could put himself in such a deep meditation that it was like sleep, which was obvious what he had done. Dean should have gotten up. He felt incredibly well rested, and really should hop up and leave before Cas ‘woke up’ so things weren’t awkward.
“John how can you be disappointed in them sure they have made mistakes, don’t you think you are being unnecessarily harsh, they have done the best with the situations they were presented..” Mary pointed out coming to the boys defence.
So Dean was expected to share his past, the reasoning behind the decisions he made, his feelings and fears. The type of stuff he absolutely hated sharing with his own brother or Cas. Yet here he  was being expected to share it all with his brother who at least knew most of it. His mother who knew the overall gist. Bobby but not their Bobby, and Rowena who had only recently gotten on their side.
“I agree he is being a jerk about it, but he wasn’t exactly wrong you are putting on a ruse, this is fake remember.”
Now I think I should tell Castiel that when you say we needed you about Jack bringing him back really you meant YOU needed him. Jack didn’t really know what he was missing and he understood. Sam was dealing he mourned you Castiel don’t get me wrong. But he accepted you were gone and focused on Jack and getting Mary back.
Positive - When he was ready it seemed like he was going to be able to visit his family blood and found.
He could have easily continued to rant to Cas. It was almost too easy once he had gotten started. But he wasn’t that kind of person that was more Sam. So he made himself wrap it up.
John was barley back a day when everything changed again because even if things were better lately. Dean was still a Winchester and their lives could never be smooth sailing. John came and confronted Dean in the library. Interrupting the research  session Sam, Rowena, Cas and Dean had been engrossed in. Well Sam, Rowena and Cas had been engrossed, Dean was slightly bored. Mary and Bobby wandering  into the library slightly after John. “‘Look son this ruse has gone on long enough, you may have everyone fooled but you aren’t a fag, just admit you aren’t sleeping with that Angel and we can move on. I know you are just doing it for attention.” John demanded.
He may have put on a brave face for Sammy when he was dying. But now he was by himself Dean was allowed to be pissed off.
“Not at all, they are similar but they have their differences, I'll show you the websites Dean and Sam’s Charlie showed me when we had our conversation about her being a lesbian, it was quite a fascinating read. Especially because even though I am an Angel there are people who think just like I do. People who don’t care about the gender they were born with and who genuinely don’t care what their romantic partners gender is they just care about them.” Dean felt the usual pain in his chest when ever Charlie was brought up, but couldn’t help smile at the memory of Charlie apparently schooling Cas on human sexuality. Dean hadn’t realised they had spent enough time together to even have a conversation like that.
Why can’t my life ever be normal.
“Right and when did this whole thing happen?” Asked Sam who seemed to be determined to poke all the holes in Deans plan.
Ending with Dean finally saying yes to Michael. That was thankfully the last of it to catch Dad up to date as when he had been resurrected they had caught him up on how it had happened with the whole Michael thing.
“You boys can’t sit there though and tell me conspiring with those monsters hasn’t bit you both in the arse. I'm sorry did I mishear the part where you became addicted to Demon blood and were sleeping with a Demon Sam.” Dean felt sorry for Sam because he knew how much he regretted Ruby and everything he had done since to make up for it.
“It’s Mom can I come in honey.” Mary asked, opening the door slightly.
Dean was startled awake by the noise of his door banging and years of training had him instinctively rolling over and grabbing his gun from his bedside table, sitting up and aiming it, before he had even really woken up or realised what was going on. Cas had immediately sat up drawing his angel bland so both hunter and Angel were ready before their brains realised there was no threat and it was just John. Yet neither made a move to lower their weapons.
But he was back and then he was gone searching for Jack. Then he had been kidnapped not that I knew that until he had escaped. Then there was Lucifer and as always in our lives, it just never stops. We never get a break or a second to breathe it’s always just one thing after another.
Who were able to bring a more human, team working,dealing with failure, kind of life experience to the table.
Just focusing on the rest of the morning, which meant Dean didn’t mind that Cas had decided to rest last night, or that he had forgotten he was wearing his clothes. But did he not mind because he just did not mind, or because it had pissed John off.
“Well actually Dad I’m even worse than Sam in that regard not only have I had a relationship with a ‘monster’ but I still am and he's male at that. Why do you think Cas and I disappeared earlier.”
It gave them the chance for Cas to really explain in detail everything that had happened in Heaven.  As well as for them to both talk about what their current plans were. Because for the first time they were able to actually think and plan what they wanted to do. Not have it be predetermined by whatever the current crisis was.
“What can we help you with John?”Cas asked icily.
Now Dean wouldn't have minded Sam coming in but, obviously he had brought people with him and that was the complete opposite of what Dean wanted at the moment, hopefully it was just Jack he was talking to.
“I’m proud of you boys for killing the yellow eyed demon. But that’s about all I can say I’m proud of you for. I honestly feel like I don’t recognise either of you. Neither of you have turned out to be how I wanted you to when I raised you.” John paused to take a breath. Both  Dean and Sam kept their mouths shut, they could tell he was nowhere near finished lecturing them though. He had obviously been preparing this the whole time they had been telling their story.
“It’s this binge culture we live in one second Cas and I are just watching one episode of Brooklyn NineNine the next second we’ve watched half a season.”
Positive  - He did his duty as a big brother and his little brother is alive.
“Who is it.” He grumbled still half asleep.
Even Rowena was giving him the odd compliment.
Positive - It seemed Cas wasn’t stuck in the empty.
Dean took a deep breath  before starting to tell their story, picking up from the hospital after they realised what John had done to save Dean.
Sam then took over telling them how they thought Jack would be a baby but they found him as a teenager.  Dean and Sam spoke about the different reactions they had with Jack.
“What like reinstate the men of letters properly?” Asked Dean
Dean blamed the fact that he was already on edge, that he was angry at his father, that he had so many years of pent up feelings towards John for the words that came out of his mouth next.
As soon as the door swung closed behind him Dean threw himself back on the bed in frustration.
“You told him what?” Spluttered Dean.
So it wasn’t exactly hard to keep the lie up but it was weird. Dean hadn’t been prepared to have so many people think he was in a relationship with Cas.
Dean was driving down a long open road. Seeing Baby in Heaven was the first thing that felt okay since he realised he was dying.
“I’m happy to stay here watching Brooklyn NineNine if you want to.” Cas offered giving Dean an out.
Dean and Cas shared a quick wondering if they should share why John was pissed already but decided to keep it themselves. “Well he can be pissed somewhere else. I had a great night's sleep, and am in too good of a mood to care about him today.” Dean Spoke.
I can't hold your hands though. I can't write your conversations for you. I could make it so you can read each other's minds. But I won't I'll save that for if I see you again and you still prove to me you haven't learned anything.  Take this wisdom on board realise what an opportunity I have given you to move forward and stop making the same mistakes. Take time to think things through individually and then have a conversation together give yourselves a chance at being happy.
John had given them a couple of days to just enjoy being back before he demanded they sit down  together and the boys catch him up on everything.  After all, the only big bad John had been aware of was yellow eyes. Lucifer, Lilith, Angels, Apocalypses and everything else was hard for him to get a handle on without the stories. He wanted more than the snippets he was hearing in passing from different people. He wanted to hear it straight from the source.
“I told Dad he wasn’t allowed to comment on it or ask questions until we finished telling him all about it.  Well as of last night he’s all caught up. So now I have to deal with him and his comments and questions. And let me tell you Cas he’s not going to be happy with me and Sam. It’s all going to be my fault as well I’ll be the failure I should have been the one to stop Sam from choices he made. So no Cas I’m not entirely happy to have him back.”  That was as honest as he could bare to be at this stage.  And he was only letting himself be that honest because he was honestly emotionally exhausted from the past month and could barely hold his walls up around everyone else, let alone Cas.
That statement got a reaction out of Cas with his eyes filling with anger and Dean having to grab Cas by the arm so he didn’t storm out and have a go at John.
Dean could see Dads eye twitch every time they mentioned Crowley or Cas. They spoke about what the start of the apocalypse really meant and what events they witnessed and had to try and stop.
Even though nothing life threatening had been happening or anything along those lines like Dean normally reserved his hugs for. He had been through such an emotional turmoil having to relive his past and was so stressed about the judgment and the comments that were still to come. That Dean couldn’t help himself,  he needed the feeling that came with having Cas safe in his arms.
It was a weird dynamic between them  but it worked and Dean wasn’t going to judge, and besides the odd thought it wasn’t something Dean spent a lot of time wondering about.
Jack had locked himself in his room on a massive Netflix binge and requested he not be disturbed. A quick text to Jody assured them that locking themselves away and spending the whole time on their laptops was common teenage behaviour.
Which at least that was one good thing about this already. Dean had been pretty certain if he ever said anything to Sam he wouldn’t care. But at least now he knew for certain that Sam wouldn’t care.
Dean was fully committed to this plan and he was going to see it through, Sam needed to understand that.
I wish I wasn't such a screw-up. But that's all I’ve ever been Dean Winchester a screw-up. I feel like all I've been doing my whole life is trying to right my wrongs and just making more wrongs in the process.
Maybe if he really thought about it would admit that he could see some sort of attraction between each other. But lately he was noticing it seems deeper than that.
John obviously couldn’t stand the conversation and stood up slamming his chair in as he stormed off.
Sam had even admitted late one night when they were both drunk, that he had told Rowena things that he had never said out loud before when Dean had questioned why he was so trusting over her now.
John being brought back was a gift from the Angels to show their thanks for Team Free Will’s help as well as sort of a truce. Not the weirdest team up/gift they had even been a part of/received
“My my Castiel, I know your Dean’s but I do have to say how delicious you look in his clothes.” Flirted Rowena.
To Cas he had felt it was finally a chance to redeem himself for all the wrongs he had caused his brothers and sisters, and even though spending an extended period of time in heaven was not ever something Cas wanted to do. It was worth it to finally ease the guilt he had felt all these years.
It might take a while, but he could make this work. He could accept being in Heaven.
Would it have made more sense to stay with Bobby and catch up? Should he go and visit his parents?
I thought that would be comforting and helpful but of course, as everything else, it came back to bite me in the arse.
“Mom there are only two reasons you didn’t know. One like you said there hasn’t exactly been a moment to really sit down and talk about it. But the main reason was simply It was never a thing that needed to be said. Cas and I, are just Cas and I, it’s not like we are a typical couple. We aren’t even in the same state the majority of the time. This is the first time since we started  we have ever been able to be together without something major looming over us. “ Dean tried to be as honest as possible, in the hopes to appease Mary’s guilt.
“Think whatever you want Dad, obviously you aren’t going to just believe me but I’m not lying to you.” With that Dean stormed off out of the library to get a drink.
John was never one to admit he was wrong, yet he was really struggling to process what he was seeing with his eyes,and how that fit with what he believed. Dean was just faking his realtionship to piss John off, no one knew John was coming to confront him this morning. So why was Dean in bed with the monster, why had they been curled around each other like lovers.
“It’s never a good idea to startle a hunter away Dad, or did you forget one of your own rules.” Snapped Dean, pissed off with having been startled awake.
Dean had never been one good for reflection and processing. He was always looking for the next hunt the next problem to solve. But he was in heaven and there were no monsters to fight. No problems no nothing.
I could admit at least to myself that the last thirteen years since I picked Sam up from college to look for Dad had changed me.
They had finally truly defeated Lucifer, and the new Michael.  In the end having Michael in their world for even a short time had actually worked out well for them. Michael had kidnapped Jack, from Lucifer and restored his power. As well as brought back countless Angels from the empty. Sure it was all for nefarious purposes to destroy the humans. But with so many hunters, and the Angels on their side  they were for once able to defeat the big bad before anything went wrong.
“My brain keeps going there because after decades of trying to impress Dad and not get on his bad side, I know the easiest ways to piss him off.  Now don’t you have some more plans to work out for this headquarters you want to implement, get busy,”  Dean was officially done with the conversation.
Let me know what you think? Who do you think is going to make the first move?
Because it was easier that way. If I ever did get hit by a truth spell and Sam started asking uncomfortable questions it was easier to blame Dad.
Not so fun was Sam speaking about the struggle of seeing Lucifer constantly.
Plus Dean was trying to deal with his own emotions and thoughts regarding his father.
”Plus I know you are a celestial wavelength and all, so you don't have a gender but your vessel is male and Dad hates Gays almost as much as “Monsters” so it means I'm going to be a double disappointment in his eyes.” As Dean was explaining his reasoning he realised that it was kind of convoluted and may be crazy but he was sticking to it. After years of not rebelling or sticking up for himself, he was finally doing it and he was going all out.
“I’m not going to say you look delicious but it’s nice to see both you boys looking so relaxed and happy together. I really am so happy you have each other and that you are feeling more and more comfortable sharing yourselves with us.”  Mary couldn’t help but add, even though it really had nothing to do with her, it did make her feel like she hadn’t ruined her boys lives completely to see them happy and healthy.
And even have a prank war with Sam for the first time in years because he could.
But here he could, there were monsters to fight. And while he wasn’t sure where Cas was he could find him. And Sam would join eventually. Plus it would be better than he ever imagined because Bobby could be there. Mom and Dad could be there. Here in heaven, it wasn’t just Sam, and Cas.
Dean made a demand of his own though. No one was allowed to ask questions or make any comments about anything Sam or him said till after they had told all of their story The only way Dean was going to be able to get through this was if he didn’t have to deal with judgement until after.Plus he doubted they would ever get through it all if they had to stop every other sentence to answer questions.
“I assume your girlfriend is on board.” Dean wouldn’t be Dean without comments like that Sam had to have known it was coming.
He had to try and process this. It is what it is he was dead. If he let his anger rise, it wouldn’t stop and he would make himself miserable for eternity. Who knows how long he had been driving to come to this conclusion Bobby had said time worked differently here in Heaven but he felt like he had been driving for a long time.
They may not be together but it was just a matter of time. Rowena may not have been Deans first choice for Sam but he had certainly done a lot worse and if she made him happy well that was all he wanted for his brother.
But of course not talking about it was biting me in the arse now. I had tried to mention it in some way earlier to have at least some sort of conversation asking how he was holding up with everything.
In the end, Dean had to agree with Sam’s reasoning but he also laid down the law that this wasn’t going to be something they told him all in one go. If they were going to go into absolutely everything, no secrets all skeletons put out to air, they had to do it slowly and if either Sam or Dean needed a break, they could take a break.
He didn’t have time to dwell on it before Jack was asking him and Sam to clarify something.
Dean led them through the bunker to the one place he knew they wouldn’t be interrupted, his mancave. Sam had no interest in it and Dean had purposefully not shown it to anyone else beside Sam and Cas.
Of course the main reason Rowena was offering help was to piss off John Winchester, who really just rubbed her the wrong way. But goodness you had to be completely blind to not be aware that the two boys were actually in love with each other. She would be shocked if Mary didn’t have her own assumptions about them.
Which if Dads eye keeps twitching every time they mentioned working with someone who wasn’t a hundred percent human he was going to have a permanent tick by the end of this tale.
Figuring Dean had already dealt with enough, Cas slid into the seat across from John and placed Dean’s coffee in front  of the other seat greeting everyone.
“Why do I feel like this could easily be us walking into an intervention?” Dean  joked to Cas under his breath trying to lighten the mood.
Days managed to pass without Dean even seeing his father much to his relief. It let Dean just enjoy this charade, a charade he was suddenly incredibly thankful because no one was questioning why he was always with Cas, touching Cas.
Everyone expected Dean to be over the moon to have his father back. John’s death had affected him the most after all. He was always the one that looked up to John the most. And yet, after his initial happiness, Dean couldn’t help but to resent the fact that John was alive more each day, not to the point where he wished him dead, but it was quite clear Dean wasn’t exactly thrilled with the situation as other’s had expected, especially Sam he had assumed Dean would be with Dad every moment he could make up for lost time.  .
“I don’t have to nothing Cas I want to. The whole point of defeating God was to have free will right. So that we got to live lives of our own choosing. Well, I want to be happy, I’m not happy I’m here but I’m taking it a fresh start. A chance to try and be the me I want to be. That me want’s to be truthful with myself. And that means admitting I’m in love with you. If I misread what you said, or you’ve changed your mind and realised I’m not who you thought now you’ve had time then I’ll understand but if you want me Cas I’m yours.” Dean was trying to convey his emotions as best as he could.  He was putting everything on the line hoping Cas was picking up what he was putting down. But would understand if he had changed his mind.
There was a pause. “I think that’s a load-bearing wall, Dean.”
"Why's he leaving?" Benny asks gamely.
“No,” he said. “I’m estranged from most of them.” He seemed as surprised as Dean was to be telling him this.
Dean made a noise of agreement and settled his head back onto the pillow, turned to face in what he thought was Cas’ direction.
He’d had a midterm coming up, had been freaking out about it, convinced he was going to fail. Cas helped him study for it, during one of their regular study sessions.
Dean didn’t answer. He just turned the key and drove away.
And now Dean’s hands were all over Cas – he couldn’t stop himself. In his hair, at his hips, pulling him closer, closer even as Dean moved forward himself. There was a muffled thump as Castiel’s back hit the wall Dean had unintentionally pushed him against, and Dean felt Cas smile under his mouth, driving him half out his mind with desire. He moved to kiss Cas’s neck, one hand on his jaw and the other still pressing him against the wall. He tasted the salt of Castiel’s skin on his tongue, heady and arousing, before Cas gave a low growl and tugged Dean’s mouth back up to his own with his hands in Dean’s hair.
“And you’re inheritance lawyers,” she stated.
Dean walked over. Castiel saw the tense set of his shoulders, the way he clenched and unclenched his fists as he gazed through the window, and almost recoiled at the fear he sensed coming off of Dean, hitting Cas like a tsunami wave flooding the room. Dean swallowed, oblivious to the effect he was having on Castiel. He turned around. “Fascinating,” he said, his voice barely controlled. “Where’s the door?”
“Okay. If you have to be here, you have to drink,” Dean informed Cas, signaling to the bartender.
“Well. No.” The look on his face said it all. It was the third flash card he’d gotten wrong in a row.
She looks hard at him. “Okay, dude.” She looks like she’s going to say more, so Dean quickly says, “We’re out of milk.”
When he got back ten minutes later with the coffees and a breakfast sandwich for himself, the mood was inexplicably different, like some of the tension had loosened enough to trickle away. Cas greeted him with a smile, his eyes focused on the cardboard cups. Dean handed Cas his usual black coffee and popped the lid on his own to dump in cream and sugar packets. He flopped into the other chair at the cramped table and gratefully sipped at the hot coffee, trying not to scald his tongue.
Cas looked a little sad. “I didn’t want to make you feel uncomfortable. If you don’t want me to know how you feel, then that’s okay.” Dean blinked. Oh. Cas continued, “You were under a spell, Dean. I’m not going to hold you to what you said while you weren’t in control of yourself.”
It dawned on him then, seeing Cas look at him like that, that Cas really loved him. He, Dean, was wholly, truly loved by an angel – albeit a partially human angel. And it didn’t matter if he deserved it or not; Cas loved him anyway. Even after everything.
“Are you all right?” he asked.
Cas looked surprised. He lowered the mug and looked into it as if it would tell him. Slowly he said, “No, I only taste the molecules in it. I suppose I drink it because… I like the action. The repetition of it. And because you and Sam do it.” He tilted his head at Dean, studying him and asking a question at the same time.
“In France.”
“No,” Dean said with too much force. “Two. Two beds.”
“I was made aware.”
After he finishes his movie, he finally makes lunch. He isn’t even really hungry anymore, he just can’t think of something better to do. He makes an elaborate grilled cheese, using whatever they happen to have in the fridge.
When his look of disbelief was met with bland earnestness, Dean gave in, giving a performative shrug as if to indicate to some invisible audience that he was
God, he
“I can take you to him.”
Cas was doing something with his tongue in Dean's mouth that was making him feel like he might pass out, and he realized that he was getting lightheaded, so overwhelmed with sensation that he was hardly breathing.
to believe in it. He was a soldier: nothing more, nothing less.
Things weren’t going according to plan, Dean thought. He was fucking this up. He had intended to be doing the talking here – for Cas to understand how he felt, not the reasons why he couldn’t tell him. He felt a little frantic. “I
"Is it okay if I shower here?"
Dean was very conscious of Cas’s weight on the mattress next to him, of the fact that Cas was close enough to touch, clad only in a t-shirt and a pair of Dean’s old jeans, the exhaustion and worry that had lined his face now smoothed out in sleep.
“Not really.” Dean exhaled heavily. “It seemed like they didn’t know anything about the grandma, and they would know everything the real Adelaide knew, so I guess that means the trip would’ve been a bust even if she’d been alive.”
He woke up gasping and sweating, tangled in sheets, hands flying to his chest in search of blood.
“Dean?” A voice comes from behind him as he’s nodding to himself, mulling this option over.
Her voice was harsh when she spoke. “What do you want?”
Eventually Dean was starting to feel like they had run out of all possible objects to Spy. Worse, he was having that odd sensation again, the one that felt like he was approaching a precipice he couldn’t fully see. Examining the feeling only made it worse, as if he was only turning to face the treacherous cliff head-on, so he pushed the thoughts away – edging away from the drop-off – and tried to think about the case. Would the granddaughter – Adelaide – even know anything useful? Dean kind of doubted it, but he would rather drive halfway across the country on a shitty lead than to sit uselessly at the bunker while Sam just got sicker. He grimaced, regretting this new line of thinking.
Cas nodded. His hands twitched around the coffee.
“What are you even talking about?” He’s honestly not sure.
"Please."
“Dean, I don’t get drunk the same way you humans do.”
Dean had rather expected a straightforward
For a long minute he gripped the wheel with trembling hands, willing himself to calm down. He wanted to peel out of this stupid motel parking lot, wanted to drive until he hit the next state, or Canada, or maybe just the nearest bar. But the enormity of what he'd said was holding him in place as surely as if he was a titan with the world on his shoulders.
Cas studied his face, searching his gaze. Then he shrugged easily. “Me neither.”
He got into the car and waited.
Dean glared at him. “I never said it was his fault.”
Castiel looked alarmed. “Oh. My superiors – they weren’t satisfied with…how I was carrying out orders.” He reached for the next glass unprompted.
“No,” Dean interjected randomly, wondering distantly where he was going with this. “I mean, don’t leave me.” He gestured vaguely with the arm that was working the best. “Us. Home, the bunker. Me.”
Cas had come over to study. Dean's best subject was English - turns out, reading all those books in high school was actually useful in university. Meanwhile Cas was good at the math-y subjects, although his major was gender studies. He'd mentioned to Dean that he took a few semesters of math courses before changing his major. He would help Dean with his calculus class, although he wasn’t in it himself.
“Where’s Cas?” he asked Sam when he met him, alone, at the door of the bunker.
“Mm-hm,” Dean confirmed, still half-asleep.
“How does it feel?” Dean asked curiously, unable to help himself.
He shoved the book across the table, turning it to face Dean. A single word was penciled in the margins of the page in thin, jagged handwriting:
or possibly
Cas’ brow was furrowed in concentration. “There’s a person with blue hair in that car? The billboard with blue writing on it?”
"Shh," Cas was saying against his neck, his chest pressed to Dean's back. "Just a dream."
Instead, he’d replied simply, “Dean.”
Next chapter being posted tomorrow!
"See you later," Cas had said simply before he left, closing the door softly behind him.
“Okay,” Cas said. He retreated to the table in the corner of the room, where he had clearly been sitting with what looked like a magazine.
hate you, that I
“No,” Castiel said.
“You know,” the shapeshifter told him serenely, “you hunters are the reason old Adelaide had to die. I had to take her place to survive. I had no choice. If I didn’t have to constantly worry about you bloodthirsty brutes tracking me down and murdering me, I wouldn’t have to kill to hide myself.” They shook him, making his teeth rattle. “Do you have any idea how hard it is to pretend to be someone you’re not?”
“Ah, that’s why it’s taken you all night to read,” Dean remarked absently, unwrapping his sandwich.
"Well," Benny says, "has he got anything holding him here?"
about.”
Despite the dream – despite everything – Cas’ presence comforted Dean as it usually did, even just sitting in the corner hunched over a book, flipping pages at a disturbingly rapid rate.
Dean stared at him. “You do?”
“It was a witch, not the Tet Offensive.”
Dean winced. “Not right this second.” It was technically true; he’d been worrying about himself.
to do.
He raised his eyes to Dean's then, an unspoken question in them. Breathless, Dean nodded, unable to form any thoughts beyond the electric awareness of how close Cas was – an awareness that was always there, but ramped up to a hundred now.
He felt almost desperate for Cas to be near – he wondered, half delirious, if perhaps Cas was the cure to the curse, not whatever was in that stupid vial. He felt like he couldn’t be safe until he was totally sure of the presence of the angel – until he could feel Castiel physically next to him, his skin, his hands, his face, his lips. Dean started to feel hot underneath the chills.
Dean swallowed. “Why didn’t you say anything?”
Benny looks thoughtful. "Does he know you want him to stay?"
Cas looked up with one hand poised to turn the page of
“I wish I was different, you know, Cas?”
Cas' eyes were dark – his pupils blown – and his lips were red and wet. He looked fucking gorgeous, a scene right out of one of Dean’s most well-buried fantasies. His hands trailed down Dean's arms to loosely hold his hands, and he looked Dean carefully in the face, studying him. Cas’ hands were solid and warm on Dean’s, somehow grounding him.
“Not a tree.”
He didn't drive away.
He’s looking forward to talking to Sam, of course, he always does, it’s just that he knows Sam will inevitably ask about Cas, and he’s not sure what he’s going to say when he does. If he’ll lie or tell the truth. Or even what the truth is.
For a long, terrible moment, he's sure that Cas has left early, is already on the plane, maybe. Or even that Cas is home and is simply ignoring him.
He felt arms around him. Cas’s arms, he was pretty sure. He could tell because they felt nice and rather familiar holding him up. Less nice, however, was the cold air that hit him in the face as the arms pulled him out of the car. He buried his face in Castiel’s coat, inhaled that comforting Cas smell. They were back at the bunker, Cas trying to unlock the door while supporting Dean. “Cas?” Dean asked. His head was swimming.
The next morning dawned early and damp. The sky was grey, dark clouds visible in the distance, and there was a crisp edge to the air that promised rain.
“Are you worried about Sam?” Cas asked.
He calls Sam when he gets back to the dorm, gratefully taking gulps of hot coffee.
Dean just shrugs, toying with the glass. "Well, he’s not blind, and he’s not stupid, so it must be me."
Before it reached him, there was a loud, sudden bang, and then time started moving normally again, although the shard of glass had stopped its downward trajectory. Dean watched as the shapeshifter’s grip on it slackened and it fell, tumbling end over end, to the ground, where it broke cleanly in half.
Cas touched him on the forehead and Dean, suddenly feeling like his whole body was being encased in a warm glow, involuntarily closed his eyes. For a split second as the many aches and stings, cuts and bruises on Dean’s body healed themselves, he had the curious sensation that part of Castiel was in him, putting him back together from the inside out, almost intimate in the strangest way. Dean felt intensely uncomfortable. When the glow faded and Cas removed his hand, Dean cleared his throat self-consciously. “Thanks.” He made for the door and stopped as the angel made to follow him. “Look, buddy, I appreciate you healing me and all, but I’m about to go get hammered in a shitty bar instead of dealing with my problems and I’d rather do it alone. If you don’t mind.”
It didn’t matter. He wasn’t going to end up back there. Because Dean wasn’t going to let it happen. He and Cas may have been friends before all this, but he was starting to think they were better off as… something else. Colleagues, maybe.
And Dean did, almost perfectly, the variables and symbols appearing easily in his mind. A flash of lightning lit up the room through the window.
Dean stared at him, but before he could say anything, Cas continued hastily, “Anyways, I doubt I’m going to find anything useful in it.” He looked contemplative. “We still have to finish looking through the older Men of Letter’s records, but I think this Ingrid is the only lead we have. I’m just not sure her granddaughter will be able to tell us anything helpful.”
Dean was grateful for the excuse to end the torture of talking about old books and research, but there was something else that was on his mind. “Uh, Sam,” he said, wincing slightly.
He sees Dean. Their eyes meet, and Dean realizes distantly that he’s holding his breath, isn’t sure how long he’s been holding it for.
“I’m Benny,” the other man offers. He smiles, and for a second Dean sees Cas when he first met him, in that English class all those months ago, sitting in front of him taking beautifully detailed, handwritten notes on
,” and he opened his hand to stare dumbly at the tiny purple hex bag in his palm. Motherfucker.
He was holding a blade to the throat of a snarling vampire.
Dean groaned and opened his eyes to the sight of Cas’ pale, worried face over him in the dim light. The same face and yet so different than the one from his dream.
"And I know I've said it before, but I'm sorry, Dean."
He slid to the floor, groaning, while the shelves that had broken from his impact surrendered their contents to gravity, heavy hardcovers careening to the floor and slippery paperbacks toppling onto Dean’s head.
Cas nodded. “That’s why we’re here. The rising of the witnesses is one of the 66 seals. They’re being broken by Lilith.”
Dean shifted, uncomfortable. “It’s fine,” he said, unconsciously echoing Cas. Feeling the need to continue, he explained, “I never knew my mom, and my dad was a piece of shit anyways, so. But I’ve got a baby brother, Sammy. He’s too busy being a hotshot lawyer to come visit me all the way out here, though.”
“Me?”
Dean was only half listening, the other half of his brain focused on looking for a weapon. Coming up mentally empty handed, he responded, “We wouldn’t have to hunt you if you didn’t kill people.”
When Castiel first met the righteous man, he thought that perhaps there had been a mistake.
Clearly taken aback, Cas nodded.
“Not getting worse,” Sam agreed.
“Then why are you acting like you hate the guy?”
Dean looks at Benny, who looks back at him knowingly, eyebrows raised.
Unable to respond, Dean squeezed his eyes shut as if he was in pain and nodded, once, at the steering wheel, though Cas didn’t seem to need or expect a response.
There was no reply. Dean started pulling on his shoes, daring Cas with his eyes to stop him.
Dean jumped at the sensation when Cas pushed the sweaty hair off his forehead and pressed his hand against his skin, checking his temperature. Dean watched him do it with mild interest, following the track of his fingers through the air with dull eyes, and noting distantly that Cas seemed alarmed at the heat of his skin. He missed the pressure of Cas’s skin on his own when it was gone.
"No - fucking - what is this, the Spanish Inquisition? Leave me the fuck alone." The words come out more harshly than he'd intended, and there’s another short silence before Sam speaks again.
And then Cas said something odd. He said, “So you don’t have to worry.”
He still couldn’t feel it even as Castiel ripped the blade free of his flesh, and he watched with detached dismay as blood immediately began to pour from the wound following the tip of the blade, as if it had been only waiting to be released from his chest.
When he opened his eyes, Cas was staring at him, his eyes dark and inscrutable. Wordless, he took a step closer to Dean, who had to resist the urge to take a step back. He felt the change in air pressure intensely, like his skin was more sensitive than normal.
“Single bed?”
“I’m going to go call Sam.” Dean heard Cas move into the hallway and dial. Soon, he was listening to the low murmur of Cas’s voice through the door. He felt very tired. He didn’t remember falling asleep.
Sam was quiet for a second. “Oh,” he said finally. “That sucks. Did you get any information out of the shifter at least?”
At first the kiss was almost chaste, closed-mouth and gentle. Cas’ palm was warm on Dean’s cheek, and his other hand moved to cup the back of his neck, pulling him close. Dean breathed him in, the scent of hotel soap and that distinct, indescribable
“Well, great fucking job so far,” he spat with a scornful laugh. “Stellar work with the witnesses.”
Castiel surprised himself by laughing, a strange chain reaction of muscle contractions that felt foreign to him. He thought Dean’s expression softened a little, and he sat back on the bench.
“This is a different green thing,” Cas informed him.
The second time Dean met Castiel, he was afraid.
When Dean left to get them both drinks, he'd come back to find Cas and a drunk Gabriel having an argument in the corner. His arrival had broken up the argument, whatever it had been about - he hadn't asked - and Cas had introduced them to each other, tersely polite.
“Not really,” Cas said finally. “Just relaxing.”
Cas turned back to face him. "What is this really about?"
“I don’t think that would work,” Cas answered seriously. Frowning, he brought the mug to his chapped lips. Dean noticed there wasn’t any steam rising off of the coffee anymore – it was cold.
"You told him it was
Dean hesitated. He wasn’t sure what to make of this new Cas, who didn’t mention orders or commands every thirty seconds, who offered to heal him for no reason. He shrugged despite feeling apprehensive as Cas approached him. “Okay.”
“What?” Cas demanded.
At first it was good – too good. So good he began to feel doubtful. Was he dreaming? No – that was the edge of the table digging into his side, that was the sweat on the back of his neck from the heat. And that was the sweet taste of vanilla on Cas’ lips, his hand on Dean’s thigh, and the clean smell of his hair. He was definitely, definitely awake.
Dean stopped moving.
Cas crossed his arms. The image it conjured to Dean’s mind of a petulant, trenchcoated toddler made him snort with laughter.
Dean bristled on cue. "I just want you to be able to do one fucking thing before I get skewered by some crazy shapeshifter, is that so much to ask?" He pointed a finger at Cas in accusation, but he was panting, both from the exertion of anger and from the throbbing in his bruised ribs. He put a hand to them, wincing.
. But he swallowed all of the words before they could make it to his vocal cords, let alone his lips.
Cas looked unconvinced. “Are you sure?”
The bartender refilled their glasses and Dean mutely pushed one over to Cas after draining his own. “Cas,” he said abruptly. He felt very warm.
The lobby was deserted save for the desk clerk, an older woman with short black hair and dangly earrings that swung when she moved her head. She smiled at him as he approached.
Castiel inclined his head and Dean said, ”But we put the spirits back to rest.”
(See the end of the chapter for
, it claimed, next to a blue crescent moon.
condoning this. “Okay, whatever floats your boat, man.”
Dean certainly did not know what mallow flowers looked like, but he neglected to mention this. He pointed to the only vehicle on the road that could possibly be described as pale purple, a beat-up Volkswagen Beetle. “Is it that?”
“What – ” Dean started to say, and then he saw the blade glinting in Castiel’s hand.
Dean drove away.
The rest of the night he slept a deep, dreamless sleep.
The drive back to the motel was impossibly tense. It passed by in a blur, his body on autopilot the whole way, but simultaneously the miles seemed somehow much longer than on the drive there, each stretch of highway never-ending.
It was June, and there’d been a heatwave.
"But all I ever
Cas looked doubtful, still concerned, so Dean tugged him back in with a hand around the back of his neck, causing him to smile faintly against Dean's mouth – a smile that quickly turned to a sigh when Dean licked into his mouth the same way he'd done to him, pressing their tongues together to taste him.
Cas didn't seem to appreciate this, making a low noise, almost a growl, that vibrated through Dean's mouth. His hands moved to Dean's wrists, using them to push him back against the Impala where he proceeded to press their bodies together much more efficiently than Dean could've hoped for.
Cas smiled wryly, tinged with bitterness. “Maybe not quite as much as they hate me.” He sighed. “Regardless, I would be more useful to you if I could fly us there.”
“I can’t,” Cas protested. “Rowena said this needs to be taken every hour.”
Although perhaps that was something he’d known all along, deep down.
Dean watched him, his fists knotted in the bed sheets pooled around his waist. How stupid he'd been to suggest, to imply, that Cas might want more than what they were doing. As if anyone would ever want
Dean Winchester looked at him hard. “Not in my experience.”
“Why is it called a glove compartment, anyway?” Cas mused, holding the map right up to his face like he was nearsighted.
“No.”
“Okay, yeah, I give up.” Dean turned to face him, amused. Cas’ gaze on him made him feel simultaneously vulnerable and warm.
Standing between Dean’s knees, Cas put his hand gently, tenderly, on Dean's face, a strange expression lighting up his face. He looked – awed, almost. Transfixed.
The things Cas had said when they were both about to die. The way he’d looked at Dean, eyes shining with emotion, and told him
Dean hadn’t known Cas very well at the time. They’d been in a study group together that semester, for a class they had together – a class on English literature. The rest of the study group had left the group one by one for whatever reasons, until it was only Dean and Cas.
"Oh. Sorry, dude.” Here they go. “Are you okay?"
He'd suggested it to Cas sheepishly, expecting him to scoff or mock him, but Cas had agreed easily, surprising Dean.
He would do whatever he needed to do, hypothetically speaking, because he was perfectly capable of killing a guy who was hell-bent on killing
"Sure." Cas seemed to hesitate. "Do you want me to stay?"
He wanted to say something like,
There was a pause over the line, then:
Feeling nauseous, he was relieved when the traffic picked up and they went back to sitting quietly, Dean focusing on driving.
Dean had known it was coming, had anticipated it all this time, but it didn’t make it hurt any less now that it had finally come. He closed his eyes tight against the pain, allowing himself an extra second to feel it, to wallow in it, and then he opened his eyes and said, “Goodbye, Cas.”
Dean felt Cas' gaze on him, hot and blue as ever, and he kept his eyes down like a coward, unable to meet it. He thought that he might just crumble into a million pieces if he did, eroded like a riverbank by that knowing, relentless look.
Dean mentally cursed himself. “Oh – sorry – I shouldn’t have asked.”
something – anything. But all he could do was watch the cold blue eyes above him.
. Dean hears the words again as if there’s an echo. "Of course he does."
Dean Winchester was – once again – messing with his head. He had thought he was mostly recovered from the effects Dean had on him, after a little while of no contact with him – this being due, he suspected, to the efforts of his superiors. But now he was back in the same room as Dean, and experiencing the now familiar sensation of being blinded by the furious ball of emotions that was Dean Winchester. It was like looking directly at the sun, Castiel thought. The intensity of Dean’s emotions was stronger than any Castiel had ever seen in a human.
“I need you, Cas,” he said again, unable to stop himself.
“Hunters,” she hissed.
to me right now?”
The angel looked up. For a second he just stared at Dean, surprise and relief warring on his face. He took a tentative step towards Dean and then Dean had crossed the rest of the distance between them to wrap Cas in his arms, his chin on his shoulder. He was solid and reassuring, enough to make Dean’s whole body relax. Cas’ hands came up to rest on his back, warm through his clothes.
Sometimes, like now, Dean would look over at Cas, with his fingers wrapped around a coffee mug, peering into the dark liquid inside like he was trying to read his fortune, and he’d feel like he was teetering on the edge of some intense, all-encompassing emotion, something that made him feel like there was a heavy lead block in his stomach. Something that made him feel like he was kneeling on a cold stone floor, watching a silver blade high above him. He didn’t like it.
He ignored the frustrated noise Cas made, as well as the eye roll that accompanied it.
Cas hesitated for a split second, his face carefully guarded. “It’s going to be okay, Dean.” Cas slammed the door and got into the front seat. “You’ll be okay,” he repeated, pulling out his phone.
Dean mumbles something noncommittal, and Sam only has to wait him out for thirty seconds before he caves and admits, "Not good, I guess."
“You can set an alarm.”
“Yes.”
"This is getting ridiculous," he spat, glaring at Dean. "This whole trip, you've been acting like one second everything is fine and the next you hate me. I've already apologized, Dean. What do you want from me?"
, and most of all
Eventually, Dean relaxed in his arms, drifting back into a calm, restful sleep.
“Anyways,” Sam said finally. “I’ve got some soup on the stove to get back to. I have a lot of soup to eat before you guys get back.”
“Our orders were not to stop the summoning of Samhain,” he explained. “They were to do whatever you told us to do.”
The realization of what he'd just said hit Dean like a bolt of lightning, slamming him back into his body at a million miles per hour. He opened his mouth to say something, do damage control, but he knew as he did it that there was nothing that would unsay what he’d said, and instead he turned on his heel so fast he nearly fell and he stumbled to the door.
And then Cas smiles.
“Just protocol,” Dean cut in smoothly. “To ensure you knew the decedent before we give you the money.”
Dean waited. When it became apparent that the conversation was over, he rolled over onto his side and pulled the threadbare bedsheets over him. It seemed that he’d finally run out Cas’ patience.
Dean darted a look at Cas, who wasn’t looking at him, but a small smile quirked the corner of his mouth.
He drove.
He looked unimpressed. “Then why are you here?”
“Dean?” he murmured, shifting slightly to face him. “Are you okay?”
He only knew that he was transfixed by the shine of Cas’ mouth, the way his thin t-shirt stretched slightly across his shoulders as he turned to face Dean. The blue of his eyes when he met Dean’s eyes, darker than Dean remembered them being only seconds ago. He knew that he wanted something very much, that something low in his stomach was trembling with that want, desperate and demanding.
“Well, you seem like you’re about to have somewhere to be, so I’ll leave you to it.” Benny gets up, taking his beer with him, and wanders to the other side of the room, where Dean watches him strike up a conversation with another man who’s apparently caught his eye.
For a second, the shifter seemed to momentarily inhabit an entirely new state of matter, both solid and not solid, and then suddenly they were whole again and there was a dark haired man in a beige trenchcoat standing in front of Dean. He smiled, the expression distorted on the face Dean knew so well.
In another room of the building, somewhere nearby, and in the aggrieved voice of one who had an assignment due at midnight, someone shouted, “Fuck!”
Transfixed, he reached out to trace the outline of Cas’s jaw, then moved up to brush his fingers through the soft hair behind his ear. He pulled his fingers back as Cas stirred.
Dean awoke that night to a pitch black room, save for the sliver of light that shone between the heavy curtains on the windows. At first he wasn’t sure why he had woken, his head muddled with dreams of black eyes and blood, hellfire and feathers. His chest burned as if he had been breathing in smoke from a fire, a sensation that faded by increments as he became conscious. Then he heard a voice in the dark, soft and close.
“Dean?”
Castiel looked impassive. “But you didn’t.”
Cas brought their hands up to press a kiss to the back of Dean’s hand, sending a prickle of warmth radiating through Dean from the point where his lips touched.
And finally Dean exploded, "Yes, Cas! I hate that you've betrayed me and tricked me and tried to kill me, and – and you lost the tablet, and you released fucking
Cas refused to look at him the whole time.
It's a joke, but also a good question - non-rhetorical, unlike most of the questions Dean asks himself - and Dean hesitates before he answers, looking away. He takes another sip of his whiskey.
Dean searched Castiel’s face with an intensity that unnerved him. For a second, Cas was convinced Dean was seeing past his vessel and perceiving his true form – but this was impossible. Dean sighed. “Well, tell Uriel – or whoever – they do not want me doing this, trust me.”
And Dean heard the wet, repulsive sounds of skin shifting,
Dean had almost said, “I know.”
Cas shrugged. “I don’t know, Dean. Perhaps they think it’s inappropriate of me to take you to bars to get drunk.” His mouth quirked upwards in the hint of a smile, but he didn’t meet Dean’s eyes. Dean didn’t push it. He was only just starting to feel a little less like he was barely containing a scream.
„Not that I know of.“ As so as he said that, Charlie started to wink at him.
Something in him felt incredibly wrong.
„I actually made a sandwich once.“
I'm still alive! xD I know I didn't update for a long time (16 days!) but now I'm back ;)
, he thought automatically.
„I know“, Ellen said and winked at Dean as if she would know something that he wouldn't. „He can be, “ she said with a big pinch of humor and stroked the loose locks of her hazelnut brown hair behind her ears.
, he heard Sam's voice into his head. Suddenly the hot, sudorific air of the bakery seemed to be degrees colder, nearly stabbing into his lungs like sharp, limpid ice.
The dirty smell of exhaust fumes reached his nostrils as he lifted his head to study the poster. Dean started to hum 'Crossroad Blues' into the dim light of the afternoon sun. It was dusky in the shadow of the bridge, dusky and cold.
„I am the new attendant.“ The guy's voice was as dreary as his look.
He lowered his head in guilt. If he didn’t know any better, he’d say that Ellen was too precious for this world; she gave everyone a chance, no matter who they were or what they’ve done.
„Guys, we have work to do.“ Ellen grabbed one of the tablets that were stored beneath the counter. „Dean, you can make the cupcakes. That shouldn't take too long, so you'll be finished when the new one arrives.“
The year after he came back from war. The year after he left Sammy behind.
By the time Dean stepped outside of the small, warm building, it was already dark. He breathed into the cold autumn air and watched the plume that came out of his dry mouth fading slowly.
Everything in his body seemed to scream in anxiety
She rolled her eyes. „You have a new worker, or-„ she asked more distinctly, „A new muggle you have to train.“
„Come on, we will get you stuff“, Dean suggested, „so that you can begin making sandwiches.“
„Hey, Dean,“ Ellen greeted as soon as she saw him. „We've got a freshman.“
Dean yanked his hands out of the cake batter to hold them up in a defending way. "What? I'm totally working."
Castiel nodded, checking the setting around him with an interested stare. The light of the lamps above the stove underlined the structure of his cheekbones and made his face look harder, but also more aesthetically pleasing.
, Dean thought,
The man shrugged his shoulders. „Okay. Thank you, then.“ He inspected the goods on display. „Before I go... I‘ll take one of these fluffy rainbow muffins there, please.“
