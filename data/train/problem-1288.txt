John runs through his usual routine: a couple of laps around the rink, a little footwork. When he comes back around to Sherlock and Greg, Greg’s expression is neutral, while Sherlock’s is rather more toward the displeased side.
“I was nearby in Colorado Springs, working on arrangements for February,” Mycroft says smoothly, “and thought I would stop by to see how my brother was faring with his new pupil.”
Living with John is a risk, but it is paying off. Sherlock finds it is good to have company in a way that it never has before. Living with Lestrade as a teenager had been loathsome, because it had been an exercise in being controlled. This situation, though, this exerting influence by mutual consent, is wonderful. It’s exhausting. It’s amazing.
There are complications to living with John. He is not unobservant, so Sherlock has to take care. He only ever texts his work contacts, never calls. No one ever came to his apartment, so that is safe enough.
“Yes,” John says, opening it. “Oh boy.” The text is long, rambling, and full of typos and uncorrected autocorrects. “I should be ashamed of myself and I’m no brother of hers. Let’s see, it’s ten o’clock? Looks like she had the day shift today and started drinking just as soon as she got in the door. Lovely. You know, Sherlock, I have to say, the lack of substance abuse in this household is a major point in your favor.”
I once read that writing about music is like dancing about architecture. I endeavored to do my best, and included links to similar music so that you can judge how good a job I did. You cannot listen to John’s free skate music like you could his short program, as it is an original Sherlock Holmes composition that does not exist in our universe. You can get a general idea of what I’m imagining from pieces such as
John puts his hands over Sherlock’s ribs, just above where his stomach begins to round out into a gravid curve. As Sherlock inhales, John can feel—God, and
“Fuck,” John says, looking off and to the side. “I can’t even look at you doing that without it doing things to me.”
“I found a buyer half an hour ago. Tape the key to the bottom of the exhaust pipe. The money should be in your account in a few days.”
“You don’t move your hips unless it’s absolutely necessary. You need to get them more fluid. Show me again, from the beginning into the combination, and this time let your hips go.”
It really is fine. John has been surprised at how fine it’s been. It’s a little sore after practices that are heavy on the jumps, but nothing unbearable. Even after he first dislocated it, it was painful, but the pain didn’t last long. It was the inability to hold his weight that had sidelined him in the end. Every doctor and every test had said he had no nerve damage, no torn ligaments or cartilage, no necrosis of the bone. Now that John knows it was all in his head, it’s actually a relief.
It’s becoming increasingly apparent that while sex may be just doable from a purely logistical perspective, there is every possibility that this specific position is a Very Bad Idea. Especially considering the problems Sherlock already has with overexertion and round ligament pain and pelvic girdle pain and, generally, pain.
Had he the capacity to do so, that would have been the moment at which Sherlock would have flounced away in a fit of pique. At present, though, it is a lucky moment indeed when Sherlock can rise unassisted from a seated position.
John goes down the hall to his bedroom, drags a suitcase and a backpack out from under the bed, and starts stuffing them full of his earthly possessions. Sherlock’s right, there isn’t much. Honestly it’s just his clothes and laptop. Everything else is easily replaced.
“We can wait until tomorrow, at least. I know you’re about to take him to the gym and run him into the ground.”
“Want you to fuck me,” Sherlock breathes. The subsonic purr of his voice makes the hairs on the back of John’s neck stand up.
“Love watching you make yourself feel good, babe,” John says. “Can you jerk yourself off without coming too soon?”
The man in the suit rolls his eyes, rises from his chair, and offers a hand to John. “Do forgive him, Mr. Watson,” he says. John has time to notice his fine English accent, like Sherlock’s, before the stranger says, “Our mother did her best to teach him manners, but nothing ever seemed to stick.”
“Can’t wait until I can tell everyone what you make me feel. When I win that gold medal, I’m pulling you out of your seat at the kiss and cry and we’re gonna show everyone why it’s named that way. Gonna show the whole world how much you mean to me.”
In one shocking push, John thrusts in. Sherlock’s back arches as if he’s trying to ride his whole body down further onto John, to take more. John leans over Sherlock on all fours and tries to get his breath back.
Honestly, every part of this has gone better than he hoped. John has not fired him. In fact, John is showing every sign of actually trusting him. He works hard, he has not told Sherlock to fuck off, and he has even very nearly complimented Sherlock.
As I passed, I heard the distant strains of a violin. I had not heard music in some time, not since long before coming to Bakerfield. Curious, I tentatively approached the chapel door and stepped inside as quietly as I could.
with an inside spread eagle on a very deep edge. The deepest of edges can be found on the lady skater in a
“My former coaches would be appalled at this particular usage of my Y spin position,” Sherlock says with a smirk.
Of course he falls. On the ice, he thinks back through the jump. Was that four full rotations? Did his blade come down cleanly backwards?
Checking in, checking in on the pregnant husband. Very important. Self-control. “How are you?” John asks.
There is a long stretch of silence, after which Sherlock says, “Thank you. There are...few who believe me.”
“Uh. Pleasure.” While shaking the proffered hand, John looks, open-mouthed and eyebrows raised, over to Sherlock, whose expression is grim and sour.
Sherlock rises from the bed and stalks towards John, and suddenly John’s mind goes to an entirely different place. “All I have been wanting to do for hours,” Sherlock purrs, “is get that costume onto the floor and have you, all to myself.”
This was a beefy boy, folks. It's the first part of what was initially going to be one chapter, but which I realized I should definitely, definitely split into two. As ever, constructive criticism is welcome, as I am my own beta.
And in his heart of hearts, he knows that’s exactly why he was reluctant in the first place. It’s not just that Sherlock is beautiful and that he’s carrying their child and that John loves him. When John has him like this, he is forced to admit that he is very, very aroused by Sherlock’s
One final note about scores: I am pretty sure these scores check out as reasonable, according to the 2017-2018 ISU rulebook. I've taken some liberties (as I have in many other places in this fic) about some of the more subjective scores, as John would in real life be unlikely to score so high due to some truly irritating tendencies towards reputation scoring. Don't worry,
In silence, John loads his things into the trunk as Sherlock gets into the car. The silence remains unbroken as John punches the directions to the Philly airport into his phone, pulls out of the driveway, and navigates onto the highway.
John quietly calculates what the cost of a 150-mile Uber ride must be. Five hundred dollars? More? And that in addition to a last-minute plane ticket from Denver to Philadelphia, so add on another $1,500? And then
Mycroft returns to the sofa, the better to stare down his brother. While his back is turned, John points to him and mouths to Sherlock, “There are two of you?”
“Well, then, if you believe me, and I believe in you, then take the next logical step,” Sherlock hisses.
The airport at these hours is practically deserted. This provides numerous advantages to Sherlock, not the least of which is his ability to monopolize the only convenient electrical socket so that he can charge his phone. After several hours of use en route to the outskirts of Pennsylvania and then again going back to the airport, it is in dire need of power.
tickets back—another $3,000? What must it be like to be able to drop John’s entire monthly income on a whim?
“Okay. I’ve got an appointment with a physical therapist after practice tomorrow, so no gym. Take a nap. You could use it.”
Yes, John Watson is certainly desirous. Desire is not the problem. Self-control is the problem. Sherlock may not want to admit it, but he’s more fragile just now. He gets out of breath, he nearly doubles over with abrupt pains in his stomach and groin when he moves too quickly, and his hip joints have been almost constantly sore since he reached the third trimester.
Sherlock stays still for a moment and savors the feeling of being full, of brimming with so much pleasure and pain and
Sherlock almost misses the bus, but scrambles on just in time, tucks himself into a seat in the back of the bus, and continues furiously tapping notes out on his screen. He is peripherally aware that he is humming quietly: “la-dee-da, la-da-dee-day-dah.” It’s the violin line. The piano and percussion are in his head still, but the violin is, at the moment, paramount.
“Boy, it didn’t feel better,” says John. “Did Sherlock fall this much this hard when he was training his quad lutz?”
He practically flings himself onto the bench and starts unlacing his skates with incredible speed. John looks on, bewildered.
To John’s surprise, Sherlock shambles out of his room somewhere around eight and shuffles into the kitchen.
Sherlock has pried himself out of his fit over his brother and is now looking at John with that “who is this idiot” expression that John is gradually becoming accustomed to. “Of course you are. We need to let everyone know you’ve arrived and properly announce our intention to make you Olympic champion.”
Sherlock retrieves his phone and earbuds. When he reaches for John’s, John notices that his hands are trembling. John regards him with disbelief, eyes wide. He doesn’t need to look at Greg to see he’s making a similar face.
Apologies for the delayed update! I had a big move, and then a lot of craziness, but updates should be back to the usual rate (tentatively faster, even?) now that I'm mostly unpacked and settled in.
Also, as a fun figure skating side note, the real life figure skating world keeps supporting the ridiculous stuff I do in this fic. For instance, Daisuke Takahashi has just announced he's coming out of retirement after four years at the age of 32! However, it looks like he will actually be skating at his regional competitions, unlike John Watson, who is written by a lazy writer and who is skipping those for convenience purposes.
Sherlock could open the emails from Mycroft, the ones offering him nominal “work” giving anonymous feedback over the internet or writing training presentations for judges and coaches and skaters in exchange for an egregious sum of money. But he knows the hidden cost of these jobs. He weighs the cost and benefit and determines that he does not and will never need to take those offers.
The next day, John repeats the same routine. The violin playing has stopped when he wakes. Only the sound of pages turning indicates that there is any life inside at all. Before John leaves for the rink, he leaves a few granola bars outside of Sherlock’s room, knocking on the door to let him know they’re there. He gets a grunt of acknowledgment and nothing more.
Sherlock’s eyes flick to John and then back to the visitor. His hands are pressed together as if in prayer and tucked up under his chin. “‘Guest’ implies an invitation,” he says darkly.
“You’re fighting a losing battle, Mr. Watson,” says Mycroft. “Anyhow, I only wanted to stop by and issue my congratulations to Mr. Watson here.”
Sherlock holds up a hand and ticks off the accounts as he names them. “There’s @sholmes, which is the official account Mary created for me in 2011. I update it occasionally with commentary on current skating news, et cetera. Then I have my fan accounts. There are two English-language accounts, one based out of Michigan and one out of Toronto, and one account each for Japan, Korea, Russia, and Italy. I keep my ear to the ground.”
“2009 Nationals in Cleveland. It was your first year competing in juniors and my last. Do you remember?”
and find the bullets for a step sequence. Sherlock is finding John’s first effort to be “creative and original” and the elements “matched to the musical structure,” because those are the bits he himself is responsible for, and because Sherlock, of course, can do no wrong.
There is no violin music that night, and none the next morning. John goes through his morning routine and to the rink.
"Fair enough," John says, and saunters over from the kitchen to the sofa to give his husband a proper seeing-to.
But all that is in the past. John needs to live in the here and now, in the lutz he can’t land cleanly.
Sherlock lifts his mouth away for a moment. “Then keep your voice down.” He reaches up and plucks John’s belt open, and then his fly, and then he’s tugging John’s jeans and underwear down and John’s cock is flexing free as John’s head drops back to knock against the door.
As they speak, Sherlock whizzes past them, running through a complicated footwork series. John chews at the inside of his mouth. He’s going to be expected to replicate that?
Sherlock reaches up, cups John’s face, and brings it down to his to kiss him, just as he hitches his hips in the effort to make John do it, please, finally, do it. John, who wants nothing more than to give Sherlock exactly what he wants, does it.
“I had no idea you choreographed for so many people,” John says. “I never heard about it or saw you at any competitions.”
It’s fine. Nothing spectacular, just fine. He’s always been slightly more of a technician than an artist, but he feels satisfied enough with his performance.
Forget Sherlock. What’s John doing worrying about someone else’s love life? He hasn’t seriously dated anyone since...well, seriously? Never. There had been a few teenaged flings with a few girls he met through the sport. But none of them held a candle to the deep, abiding crush that had occupied the majority of John’s attentions in those days, the one that could never come to pass. He’d been so infatuated for so long that after he was free, it had taken him years to realize that time was passing him by. Even after that, there were only ever the one-night stands, the weekends off in Philadelphia, Saturday nights spent cruising bars and clubs, going home with strangers and quietly making his exit Sunday morning before they woke and making the drive home.
As ever, constructive criticism is welcome. I do all the editing on this, so I'm sure I miss some things.
A lutz is a jump that takes off from an outside edge, which is not the edge that you intuitively want to be taking off from. If you take off from the inside edge, it’s technically not a lutz, it’s a flip. When a skater plans a lutz and messes up the edge that badly, it’s nicknamed a “flutz,” a very cute term which I love very much. Similarly, if a skater attempts a flip and takes off from an outside edge, making it technically a lutz, it’s called a “lip.” These are much rarer than flutzes.
“I made sure the manufacturers made them comfortable, to make them a more attractive alternative to the traditional ice bath.”
Harry’s shoulders stiffen for a second. John spreads his stance very slightly, just enough to brace if she does what she sometimes does. But Harry doesn’t. Instead, she slumps, and shuffles to the side, clearing the doorway. John marches forward, wrenches the door open, and leaves. Sherlock follows.
There is a flash of something across their faces, gone too quickly for John to parse what it is. Surprise? Disdain? Probably the latter. They were probably still skating in juveniles when John won his national title.
showing us a lovely example of a Biellmann on a male skater. (Meanwhile, in the comments, you’ll find some lovely examples of garbage gendered expectations bordering on homophobia in figure skating.) Here is
Sherlock feels better than he has in years. Every day he wakes up and there is work, good work, work that makes him feel alive like he hasn’t in years. It’s draining, yes, but he has his ways of coping with that. During the day, there is practice and training, and at night, there is his consulting work. He hasn’t been bored in months.
“If you’re quite finished disparaging me,” Sherlock says in a pained voice, “could we get on the road?”
ignore it,” John replies drily. “I’ve watched you ‘ignore it’ on the floor of the kitchen, and tipping over at crime scenes, and in the bath—”
In a rush, Sherlock’s eyes are flying open and he is shooting upright and grabbing at the hand holding his wrist.
Sherlock scrolls down to the related videos and taps the one for John’s free skate. He winces when he sees the title of the music flash up on the bottom of the screen. Turandot? Surely John didn’t choose this music himself. It doesn’t suit him at all. And while John’s short program costume was unexciting but flattering and attractive, his free skate costume is flat-out boring: black pants and a white shirt. Someone probably told him that a simpler costume would keep the viewer focused on his skating. Someone ought to be fired.
John makes two more passes at it (one fall, one step out) before Sherlock, ever impatient, has decided that’s enough.
Repeatedly slamming oneself onto hard ice and a 4 mm blade with a force of about 10 G’s is not great for the human body, so sometimes athletes will skate through where a jump goes when they’re running their program to try to minimize damage. They do the transition into the jump, the entry, and then the exit. Yuzuru Hanyu is currently rehabbing an injury, and recently did an entire ice show where he did a bunch of his older programs and marked every single jump. People still paid hundreds for tickets. Like I said, there is a LOT to skating that isn’t jumps.
He’s in a spread eagle and in the process of entering the jump when the door to the rink bangs open.
Sherlock still does not look at him. All he does is briefly shut his eyes in what could be just a long blink, if John didn’t know better.
John does it again, and this time, Sherlock does not stop him. By the time he has finished the section they have learned today, Sherlock is grinning, and John is grinning, and they are both breathing hard, and Sherlock has forgotten entirely about that odd moment earlier in favor of the breathlessness of seeing his creation come to life.
Small note: between this chapter and the last, I changed the sort of coach John and Sherlock are using to get to London. I implied they were traveling by stagecoach last chapter and have since done more research and found that traveling from Derbyshire to London by post, or post chaise, is more doable than I thought on first research, and far more appropriate for men of the Holmes's station. Correct me if I'm wrong there. You all were so helpful with my question on names for the Holmes boys! I used your info to address it a bit in this chapter, and managed to slip in some SWEET GAY VICTORIAN FLIRTING alongside as my little thank-you.
Sherlock swallows around the lump that has suddenly congealed in his throat. Here it comes. John will have heard from
She looks from Sherlock to John. John watches as her eyes track from his face, to the backpack slung over his shoulder, to the suitcase in hand behind him. He watches her face morph from confusion, to unambiguous betrayal, to careful blankness.
“If you want to watch him land so far forward he falls off the front of his toe pick, please, go right ahead.”
“You’ll get the hang of it,” Sherlock says. He has two laptops out on the coffee table in front of him. One has a series of complicated spreadsheets, and the other is turned away.
The next moment he is aware of, John is rubbing lotion into his stomach, and his hips, groin, and lower back are in almost unbelievable amounts of pain.
By the time the sun has gone down, he has the rough draft of the first third down. The middle section brings him up short. It needs to mellow here, he knows. It requires a different energy.
John skates to the other end of the rink, swallowing around a knot in his throat. The insanity of all this is starting to set in again. What if the triple axel last night was a one-off? What if he just falls all over the ice and Sherlock realizes this is all some big mistake and sends him home?
He starts to unpack his few belongings, a process which can’t help but remind him of the other times he has done it. California back to Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania to James’s basement in California, and the big house in the countryside to the one in town. John thinks about his mother telling him all about how he’d have a bedroom all to himself, and how close it was to the rink, and how he’d never have to see his father again. He does not think about his empty bedroom in Catawissa and how Harry is probably already taking everything he left behind to the Goodwill. He does not think about sleeping in James’s basement and tossing and turning with heated dreams.
It’s a good thing he’s on his side, because Sherlock may actually have blacked out for a moment. Just a moment, though. And really, he could just as easily have been drifting for reasons unrelated to his consciousness. Yes, that must be what is happening.
Anger flares hot in John’s face. “What did you expect, Harry? You wanted me to stay here for you to shout at?”
I know, bad writer, doesn't update for over a week and then posts barely 1k words. In my defense, I suffered not just a one-two punch, but a one-two-three punch of health problems: first my physical health, then my cat's health, then my mental health. One of these things is connected to the other two. I bet you can't work out which. In any case, the kitty is home and doing much better, I can breathe, and I've got the brain shit...well, that bit's not much better, but such is life.
A jump is considered underrotated when between a quarter and a half of the final rotation is completed on the ice. More than half a turn is considered a downgrade and is counted as the next jump down. For instance, if you try to do a triple flip and finish half the last turn with your blade on the ice, it’s counted as a double flip. While trying to get an additional rotation on a jump, a skater often underrotates, but you don’t want to do it in competition. This is a hard mistake for most viewers to spot, but it can be a costly one. Often you’ll watch a skater, think they did well, and be confused by how poorly they score or where those little red dots in their technical score box on the TV coverage came from. This is usually because of underrotations.
with Martin's face pasted on) doing some lovely skating. For those nerds, it's a Y spiral, Russian split jump, triple toe loop (I think? not a great shot of the entry), and a scratch spin. Thank you to everyone who tagged me in it!
As they go inside, Sherlock doesn’t look up from his phone. How much can he see out of the corners of his eyes?
They keep going. Molly, Sally, and Philip come back from lunch. Greg sets Molly to practicing her triple-triple combinations while Sally works on her spins. Greg goes to work jumps with Philip. Sherlock and John get to some footwork.
“Did Greg promise to coach you, but only if you tried Sherlock too?” Philip asks. “That’s how he got us.”
Also, FUN FACT: penny-locking a door is totally a thing you can do. Fun prank to play, though here it is being put to the cause of temperance/studying up for your case instead of fucking your mistress. My dad always did it to us with just the one penny.
"If I do it, you promise afterwards you'll use the lotion? I'm not laundering your stomach-dandruff off the sheets."
This turned out to be clairvoyant. Less than a week after I wrote this bit, Karen Chen posted a picture with Mai Mihara on her Instagram at the rink where Brian Orser’s skaters train, and eagle-eyed fans spotted a man in the background. Twitter blew up trying to guess who could be switching to Orser. For days, Twitter was chock full of side-by-side comparisons of the mystery man’s hair and the curve of his thigh and calf with Boyang Jin’s. They put Setlockers to shame. (It turned out to be Yuzuru Hanyu, who we all already knew trains there. Someone spotted his mom in another part of the background and worked it out.)
John rolls his eyes and flicks the light on. Dressed in a chic gray sweater and jeans and lounging on John’s bed is Sherlock Holmes, looking like a model. John feels like an idiot in the ridiculous Ralph Lauren opening ceremony getup, with the massive parka, sweater, boots, and utterly ludicrous suede fringed gloves.
The Timberland boots are the biggest problem. John tries to toe them off while kissing Sherlock and fails miserably. Eventually Sherlock gives up, kneels at John’s feet, and starts untying the laces.
He’s gotten into Greg’s and Sherlock’s habit of referring to Anderson and Donovan by their surnames. He’s not sure how it started, or why Philip Anderson and Sally Donovan are Anderson and Donovan while Molly Hooper is just Molly, but it seems right.
“Better,” Greg calls, while John picks himself up off the ice. “You were only a little underrotated that last time.”
“Why? He’s got an excellent lutz, and he’s coached by the first man to land the first ratified quad lutz and the man who coached the man who landed the first ratified quad lutz. The circumstances are ideal.”
-How was the pacing here? Did any bits seem to go by too quickly or not quickly enough for what was happening?
His world narrows to the feeling between his legs, the almost unbelievably perfect pressure, the heat. Below him, Sherlock is groaning with every thrust in a way that makes John want to fuck him more, and harder, and deeper.
As mentioned last time round, this is quite unedited. Please, leave concrit! I have a thick skin and am a big slut for criticism!
Above all, Sherlock is in pain, and he is in pain because of this incredible thing he is doing for them all. And despite all that, he still wants John so badly he is willing to hurt even more for it. John loves this man so much he could die of it.
Sherlock throws back the covers, takes John’s hands, and pulls him into a sitting position. That is...not great, but better than doing it himself.
And now it happens. “They all fired me and used someone else’s choreography in the end.” Sherlock’s hand is tight around his bottle of water.
Look, I'm not going to try to play like this chapter took a long time to write. I had a wedding to plan and be in, and then a honeymoon to go on, and writing gay skating trash fell by the wayside. Hopefully the contents of this chapter make up for the wait, and much of the next chapter is already written.
I'm naming every chapter (so far) after lyrics from a song. This one's is particular corny. Points to whoever can spot it.
And then, Sherlock Holmes did the most extraordinary thing. His eyes flicked down and up once, looking me over, and then he took me apart.
One time while rehabbing from an injury, Yuzuru Hanyu could not seem to land his single or double axel. His coach, mostly just out of curiosity, told him to try the triple axel. He landed it right off. As his coach said, "His body only remembered how to do the triple."
“You still don’t believe me. It’s fine. You will eventually. I only need you to trust me insofar as my direction goes.”
John lifts his foot and Sherlock tugs off the shoe. He also leans in and presses his mouth to the inside of John’s thigh, breathing through his jeans. John lets out a long, slow exhale.
Sherlock scrolls down to the related videos and taps the one for John’s free skate. The performance is gorgeous. John’s stamina is evident in his consistency throughout the program. His jumps in the later part of his program are every bit as solid as those in the first part.
Anyways, EDITING QUESTION for this chapter/the next: please, let me know if you're following Sherlock's plan. He won't reveal the whole thing at once, because he doesn't, but I do want you, the reader, to get it by the end of the next chapter.
The yoga, at first, does not help. But after the first few miserable poses, John finds that it is improving. His situation improves substantially after a very cold shower, and by the time he is finished with breakfast (a delightfully spicy breakfast quesadilla with spinach and white beans) he finds that he can move without pulling a face, if not completely comfortably.
The announcement that John Watson is coming out of retirement makes an initial bang, but eventually fades, as all off-season news does. John’s social media notifications taper off to a slow trickle. Sherlock takes John to a kindly older woman to be measured for his costumes and shows her a series of sketches that he will not let John see.
John’s mouth moves, and Sherlock wants to turn back time to before this, before he had to see John’s face before he said the words he is going to say.
The eye contact lasts just long enough to begin to make the hairs on the back of John’s neck start to prickle. It is only broken by a ding from John’s phone. He looks down and grimaces.
The Grand Prix series is, essentially, the World Series of figure skating. High-level skaters (we’re talking about the people who are probably going to the Olympics, in an Olympic year) can be assigned to two events and, based on the results, might qualify for the final. I’m playing awfully fast and loose by giving John GP assignments at all. Technically there’s no way he’d be assigned to a GP event, as that’s based on achievements in the previous season. But that doesn’t make for good drama, now, does it?
“Oh, don’t be smug, you’re terrible when you’re smug,” Greg says. “John, are you sure you haven’t jumped in seven years?”
John returns to the bench with his lunch, where Molly is sitting with hers and chatting with an attractive blonde woman. John slides in next to Molly and shoots the blonde a dazzling smile.
Sherlock looks up from his phone briefly to shoot John a look. “Long ago, I realized that I was the only person who could meet my standards. I made myself into the best choreographer, nutritionist, personal trainer, and athlete that I could. I could recite my education and experience for you, but suffice it to say: I am, at minimum, ‘qualified.’”
“You don’t understand,” Sherlock pleads. God, why is his voice so high and weak? Why is it breaking like this? Where has his control gone? “It isn’t like that, it wasn’t ever like that.”
Sherlock really is interested. It’s no time at all before he’s squeezing John’s waist and sighing into his mouth, the unsteady shifting of his hips taking on a rhythm and an intent.
John shouts. Sherlock flinches. John stops, breathes slowly, and says, in a still, careful voice, “Explain, because I would love to hear how this isn’t you lying to me and
John does his triple toe, and then his triple loop, triple flip, triple lutz, and finally, the axel. He knows the loop was a little messy. It’s never been his best jump. His axel, though, was very good, and his lutz is a personal favorite. He skates back over to Sherlock and Greg. Greg is staring at him slightly open-mouthed.
Sherlock is whizzing past just then, working on a transition between two jumps, and has time to lean in and say, “Again.”
Sorry for the lack of action here. In the end, I think I'm going to merge a lot of these chapters together. The full thing is just too much to get done in a week, so it's coming out in shorter pieces. You can follow this and the other S4 fics on the
John can feel the blood rush into his cheeks, even though what Sherlock said is fairly benign. It’s the first time he’s mentioned sexuality concerning him at all, and John suddenly feels embarrassed about how he’s thought about this too much.
it all would be fine, but what if you slipped? You aren’t perfect!” John clenches his fists, and flinches at the sharp pins that rush through his arm. He winces and tries to concentrate on what he was speaking about. And Christ, that headache!
A cab. A car only seen when needed, and never thought about otherwise. People get in and out of them dozens of times a day, and never even bother to look in the front seat to see who was driving…
Just as he’s worked himself into a mental tirade against his flatmate, he slows, just now noticing a sleek black car crawling alongside him. He stops, tensing as the car does as well. Before he can work through this mentally, an attractive, auburn haired woman pokes her head out the window. “It’s not wise to walk on that leg so much, Dr. Watson.”
What a fucking twat, John fumes, gripping the book tighter. Does he really think that John has nothing better to do but turn in paperwork and bring home a dead body for the other? When he gets home, he’s really going to let that man have it--
The man in question is dressed in briefs and a t-shirt, when John returns,  sitting on his bed and examining his right hand, which is now inflamed and swollen.
He catches sight of his own eyes, and stares at himself. When had he gotten such dark circles under his eyes? Had he always felt this tired?
Mike laughs, not seeming to notice John’s lapse. “Just wait till the kids arrive,” he jokes. “James is starting preschool, he’s talking a mile a minute, and Joe is throwing tantrums all the time. You don’t know multitasking until two toddlers are demanding your attention at the same time.”
he thought, his eyes fixed on the watch as he was loaded onto a stretcher, ignoring the shooting pain that rushed through his shoulder by the jostling.
John hums. “Well, it’s just--” but he’s cut off, as Sherlock suddenly grabs him and twirls him around. “Sherlock, what-- mm--” and then the detective envelopes him in a kiss.
He prefers to be alone. His mind is at peace, or the most at peace it can be. The rioting noises in his head don’t stop, the pull and push of knowledge, the loud screaming of boredom, or the need for something to
“There’s...a headlamp on the operating table...I suppose it won’t be missed,” she murmurs, still confused, but seeming to have calmed down from her hysteria (although she is still leaning inconveniently against the door). “Twine...Why do you need twine? I can’t...We’re a hospital, we don’t have twine.” She looks in shock, probably answering my questions on default, before remembering that she doesn’t know who I am, and that I’ve already figured out her darkest secret.
The girl giggles now, turning away, while the boy’s eyes follow her with a self-conscious smile. They must think this is only the awkwardness of the first time, it is only that they have lost their virginity that they feel so giddy and confused. As they grow older and acquire new lovers, they will become casual and suave about sex, they must be thinking, hoping.
Or, that was the plan, until John finds himself on the couch with the detective that evening, naked once more. Sherlock is over him, pumping them both in his hand. It’s far too much, and John can hardly think straight, with the sweat, Sherlock’s soft moans, the way his hips feel when they jut against his, the way his shoulders feel when John digs his nails into him --
Sherlock doesn’t make any move to approach the man, only gives him a half smile, and traces the backside of the curtain with his hand, and looks expectantly at him.
“What?” Sherlock shouts, throwing his hands up like in a shrug, a comical and deranged smile on his face. “She’s your Soulmate, right? The woman you’re
As I think over the situation, I fail to notice the footsteps down the hall, only becoming aware of them when the door opens. I freeze, hurriedly scanning the room again. There’s nothing I can hide behind, it seems I’ll have to negotiate...
A part of John’s heart aches for whatever Sherlock had had to deal with before. Some people didn’t seem to see the majesty that John saw, maybe.
John jolts awake with a gasp, trying to wake up in enough time to find the bomb, keep it from going off, keep his men alive.
But for now, the seas are calm. John is in his arms, and beyond the walls of Troy, the disgraced lovers sleep peacefully.
The silence weighs heavily in the air, no one daring to speak, no one daring to take their eyes off the two men staring each other down.
They rush into the darkened exhibit, and John’s eyes dash to every corner of the room. No one. Shit. Nothing on the ceiling either.
It suddenly occurs to me that even such a small pot roast as this costs a handful of ration cards, something a woman like Mrs. Hudson probably would not take lightly, given the modesty of the rest of the home.
The nurse blinks at me. “St Bart’s. How do you not know that?” she sounds incredulous. I suppose when someone sneaks into a hospital, they ought to at least know which one. As I near the door, she hurries back to it, pressing her back to it to keep me from leaving. “No! I--I’m not going to let you leave. Tell me who you are!”
“Don’t scream!” I plead at her, holding up my hands in panic. I can’t risk having hospital security or superintendent come, especially if I could be arrested for trespassing (could I be arrested? I don’t have any memories for these sort of laws. Either I don’t know them, or I ignore them).
John nods, saying a quick goodbye to his old friend as he hurried out the door. God, they’d changed so much in the seven or so years since they’d been close. Their nights back then were full of energy drinks and floors sprawled with medical vocabulary, or smuggled vodka and fellow students who happened to have large breasts…
They pretend as if nothing is wrong. John goes to work with his soldier’s facade. Sherlock occasionally experiments or solves cases for someone to whom he owes a favor.
“Whoa whoa, what are you doing?” he asks, setting down Sherlock’s cup and staring in shock at the blue screen on Sherlock’s tablet. He recognizes the coding on screen as a maneuver to bypass firewalls.
John turns from Sherlock, his head rolling. Unfaithful. Infidelity was rare, one of the worst sins to commit against a partner... How could anyone do such a thing? It always seemed like the most dangerous, harmful, and the least rewarding thing one could do.
The cab driver looks up at him, wiping at his eyes. “Same thing that happens to every child who’s not born to Soulmates,” he snarls, venom dripping from his voice suddenly. “Sold, off to the sex fiends. The old bitch finally told me that. Made her be raised as a whore, no registration in the world, no other choice in life!”
There were a few people who in that time would find their Soulmate, although John only knew of a few couples. John burned with envy whenever he saw them kissing in the hall, or holding hands in classes.
My first thought is to immediately go down and explore. How can I be expected not to want to see the secret tunnel under the house I’ve come across?
“Ah, John, you managed to join us. Fantastic,” Sherlock says, an almost cheerful chirp to his voice. John looks at him in confusion, but he keeps his gun steadily pointing at the old man’s chest. He has killed four people, after all.
“Yes, because you’re not my Soulmate!” John shoots back, glaring at Sherlock. “That’s what love is! It’s the sacred union between a man and a woman, not-- the debauchery you--!”
He runs to the tube station, but realises it’s tapering off of rush hour. There will be too many people. He doesn’t have that time.
to wash her dishes. Not that one could blame her, despite her large and kind heart, I am still a strange, homeless man she found on the street.
“No, I know. Thank you, Mrs. Hudson, it’s not you I’m cross at,” John sighs, and steps back into the foyer. There’s nothing that he can do here. “Is this really more than a tantrum?”
“If I could guarantee that no one would ever discover this… If there were no consequences, no guilt… Would you continue this?”
“Er… No, it’s -- it’s your room anyway. I’ll go into my own room. But, um, yeah, you’re right, maybe, if you could give me a bit of space…” His voice is getting quieter, something that John despised. “Check back when you return?”
At any point he could ask his friend, bring it up politely, nonchalantly, as if it is a casual question about the weather.
Three aisles over, in the desserts section, a young girl lies sprawled on the ground. A small crowd is beginning to form around her, panicked voices rising.
Sherlock leans back. “I don’t know,” he confesses. “Honestly, I don’t think he cares about us, not in a moral sense. I don’t think he believes in any part of his job. It’s just a means to an end. Get power. Sew chaos. Reap the benefits. But I… I jeopardize that, in a way. I have no belief in the system either, have no stake in it. Which makes me dangerous. I have nothing to lose if I did decide to burn this all to the ground. Perhaps that frightens him. Or perhaps he’s merely intrigued by my intelligence, and just wants to add an extra flavour to whatever psychotic fantasy he has.”
With that, he takes a large gulp of his final dregs of coffee, and begins to stand. “Unfortunately, I cannot stay for much longer. I still have to speak to Parliament later this afternoon… And I haven’t looked at my speech yet.”
“Yep, looks like you’ve sprained a few ligaments,” John murmurs, shaking his head. “Maybe next time you break your hand, don’t have sex immediately after, yeah?”
Admittedly, John doesn’t know what the hell he’s talking about, but his rumbling baritone is a nice soundtrack to their walk.
And, he looks… incredibly bored. Like he would rather be absolutely anywhere, but here. Not that I can blame him. The job of a watchman is not strenuous or entertaining by any standard.
“Oh, about three years now,” Mike responds, giving the awkward smile in return. “We’ve got two boys… It’s all crazy, I--” He stopped abruptly, and John could see something lingering in his old friend’s eyes, almost like nostalgia, or regret, before he quickly snaps himself out of it. “Anyway, let me treat you to lunch. It’s been far too long!”
Sherlock hasn’t questioned him about his odd behavior, although John is certain that it must be obvious. But he’s noticed that Watches seem to be Sherlock’s weakness; the man never checks anyone’s Watch while they’re out, even when they’re on a case, even when Sherlock is trying to think of motive. Yet to John it seemed so important. Wouldn’t knowing if someone had a Soulmate, or if they were days away from meeting her, affect whether the person was a suspect or not? Very few people would commit murder a week before they’re destined to meet their Soulmate, after all.
On one of these ridiculous errands, about three weeks after their initial case, John has to submit Sherlock’s will, and, of all things, return a library book. It wasn’t as if he has any desire to do such, of course, but Sherlock’s mobile had been ringing constantly with reminders from the library, something that the detective didn’t seem to notice or care, but for John, there was a set number of times he could hear the bridge to the hideous pop song Sherlock had as his ringtone, without him going on a murderous rampage, and that limit was approaching very soon.
OHMIGOD finally. This has been such a crazy ride. I've really loved creating this world though, and I hope you all liked reading it!
It was nice to have that faith back, though. Just the Watch itself was somewhat comforting, knowing that there soon would be a time when he would have a soulmate. He just had to wait 348 days. 176 days. 493 days. Whenever the Watch thought it best for him.
Sherlock looks excited to leave as well, as he’s at the door in almost three strides. John follows as usual, but he’s a step or two more behind than he would be usually. It’s as if there’s some forcefield around Sherlock, one that if John steps into, he’ll have to think of what they’d just done, and how the other’s lips had felt against his own, how he had tasted.
Sherlock appears to be more well adjusted, as he always does. He walks casually along the wings of the museums, glancing about as if looking for a taxi. John follows after him, and doesn’t even notice how far they’ve wandered until they’re deep within a gallery. The police are posted all near the entrances, and he and Sherlock are at least a floor up, far into an exhibit.
As he wanders the store, he watches as a young couple reunite behind the counter, both teenagers. The girl is petite, curly, golden hair, a red vest makes it obvious that she works here. With her carefully applied mascara, and accessories of dangling earrings and tingling bracelets, she looks like she belongs anywhere but a hardware store.
The pathway gets dark quickly; I cannot see anything within ten rungs. Oh, and the smell is horrible, I have to breathe through my mouth to keep from gagging. It must be a sewer of some kind.
The two men continue to laugh and talk about trivial matters with one another as they walk (The larger one’s name is Mike, and lives with his mother, who treats him like a child, apparently), and not once do they look back to see if they’re being followed. Either they’re extremely incompetent, or I’m rather good at this following thing.
John swallows, feeling his eyes burn with tears that he desperately tries to wipe away. He wants so desperately to believe that… “Then how does Moriarty know?” he asks.
“What was his problem?” John asks on the cab ride home, holding their groceries in his lap while Sherlock adjusts his coat to hide his jar of eyes better.
They gnash at each other’s lips and tongues, both trying to gain control, but what John has in muscle mass and ability, Sherlock has unbridled angry energy, and he soon has John pinned, with no option except to bite at Sherlock’s lip.
“What did you deal?” John asks quietly, suddenly incredibly curious to hear what Sherlock’s past was. Anything to get the smell of blood out of his mind.
“That’s good,” Moriarty sighs dramatically, sipping slowly at his coffee. “I’d been worried about him. You know how hideous that case was… although I have to confess, I thought Sherlock Holmes would have been able to solve it if anyone could have.” There’s a hint of glee to his voice, although John can see the almost physical contortions the man has to go to in order to mask it. “Such a terrible crime. I can still hardly sleep. How someone could be so depraved, I can’t understand.”
He checks his mobile instinctively, but of course there’s no message from the detective. Was he really expecting any different?
The only thing I know of today is my name. A completely, utterly useless thing that cannot help me figure out absolutely anything.
But as awful as this explanation is, maybe he just has to accept once that the system isn’t perfect, and that Sherlock was on the losing end of the stick with it.
Sure enough, the other man leads them to a table with loose chairs, directly in the centre of the cafe. Anyone would be able to see them. This isn’t some secret meeting.
But John still can’t help being terrified. The first few sirens that blare past Baker Street make him jump, and his dream that night (in his own bed) is of Lestrade finding them, naked, curled up like they were on the couch, and throwing them in jail, where Moriarty, the man from the government, approaches them slowly.
“That you’re with her?” Sherlock cuts him off again, now taking a step closer. “Not the only reason you belong together?”
He takes the tube home, needing to be away from a talkative taxi driver tonight. The sounds of people on their mobiles, the buzzing of the electric automatic train, they all fade into one incessant hum, one John tunes out, or tunes in, anything to keep from thinking of her face.
Sometimes he tries to tell him. He opens his mouth, staring at that tall, utterly gorgeous man, but he never gets it out.
He looks back at Sherlock, who is still in his chair, and tries not to think of the life this man must have lived, nor that sinking feeling rising up in him as once more Harry’s relationship, Greg’s lack of one, and now this knowledge comes back to him.
It’s near nine when he’s done, and as he’s signing out at the front desk he hears someone call his name.
Sherlock lets out a harsh scoff, the ones he only does when someone does something he deems enormously stupid.
He gets to sleep regardless, and wakes up later in the morning for the clinic. He texts Mary on his way, although he knows she won’t be able to answer until her lunch break. Nurses rarely have time to goof off during their shifts, not like his easy appointments, almost all of which are minor illnesses or injuries, as always.
“I’m... not sure,” I admit. She doesn’t like this answer, apparent in the frown that replaces the smile she wore a moment before.
“Not really.” The voice is soft, more so than John has ever heard. In the moonlight, Sherlock’s face is even more statuesque and mythical, shadows curl up under his nose and slide along his cheekbone. The sight takes him aback, just for a moment. Something churns in his stomach, and he can feel every drop of blood in his veins.
“No, that’s impossible.” The anger fades from Sherlock’s face, the disbelief crowding it out. “I’ve gone through every precaution. What did he say? What were his exact words?” He’s stepped close to John again, staring at him intently.
Training, I remember suddenly. It’s a new implementation by the government, having army trainees serve two months in potentially endangered cities before being shipped out to the front. A completely stupid idea, I can remember thinking when finding out, why the hell delay their deaths, when they know that they will die? (I can also remember being lectured for this opinion, thought of as heartless. Maybe I am, so far I have no sympathy for anything, save for perhaps Mrs Hudson and her hospitality)
Fourteen. He takes the risk, and walks towards the shop faces. The countdown continues, he must be on the right track.
Sherlock shakes his head, his expression becoming even more confused. “I read in the paper that you had nailed someone for it. You obviously figured it out.”
sorry for how long/late this is. It was difficult to find a right ending point, and everytime I got on a roll life became busy. Review, kudos, bookmark, etc :)
“What? Molly, the case won’t be closed unless--!” Lestrade starts, rushing after her, just as Sherlock doubles in the same direction with a shout of, “I
Thirty-five rungs later, my right foot hits water. I jump in surprise at the cold, flinching as a shiver runs through me. Perhaps I should have put on shoes before this endeavour. Too late now, I think as I lower my foot again. There’s ground about ankle deep, and I recoil again as I feel slime and dirt. Oh, this is disgusting. I plant both feet quickly down, before I can change my mind, shuddering.
John laughs softly too, and soon the both of them are unable to stop laughing. But even then it can only last so long, before once more reality sinks in. John had committed a serious crime, despite what his current feelings were on the law now. Someone knew, and that person was powerful, and had some vendetta against Sherlock.
Sherlock lets go of him at that, stepping back with a harsh laugh. “Why?” he snarls. “What about it do you think is so against nature?”
Still, they both know Moriarty is watching. For John it’s the frightening feeling that occupies him every day that everything they’re doing as precautions is nothing, that everything they do is simply playing into his hands. He’s a mouse, thinking he’s safe while Moriarty sharpens his claws and gets ready to pounce, just out of view.
A flash of rage rushes through John. “You want me to spy on my flatmate?” he asks incredulously. “That's ridiculous! I have no idea what your deal is with Sherlock, but he's done nothing that egregious!”
. The memory of their first case sends shivers down John’s spine. How long had Moriarty been watching Sherlock?
“Sorry,” she sighs, turning off the sound and getting up. “I work the early morning shift, like I told you yesterday. Probably should have reminded you before we went to bed.”
Once I’ve recovered, I turn on my headlamp, take a final breath of fresh air, and start back in the tunnel once again.
I nod, keeping my eyes on the plate, my mouth watering painfully at the prospect. She directs me to a chair at the table, and places the biscuits and the mug of tea in front of me.
After all, the woe, and misery of having to be away from a lover for so long, certainly that is a connection enough, isn’t it? Nevermind that Penelope waited loyally, patiently for twenty years, while it has been only ten days since he’s seen John, and in that time Sherlock thinks he may drop dead; not to mention Odysseus left for a ten year long war, and was presumed dead, while John has just been busy and unable to sneak away. The kinship is still there, waiting, worrying, suffering, loving.
“Why, yes,” Mycroft hums, glancing back to Sherlock. “Can’t you see some family resemblance?” He smiles warmly, while Sherlock scowls. Now that John sees the two of them together, they each have the same mouth, and perhaps if Mycroft were skinnier he’d have the same face shape, and jutting cheekbones.
The men turn a corner, and stop at the hospital building, not far from where I left it. I stop short, just at the corner, so I can watch them without having to worry about them seeing me.
Usually, it’s in the middle of a case, when Sherlock pulls an all-nighter to try to piece together the evidence and John tries to stay up with him, and ends up slumped at the desk.
That doesn’t make sense. It can’t make sense. ‘Anti-social tendencies.’ Sure, Sherlock is awkward, but certainly that did not make him incapable of love, did it? If anything, John has thought that Sherlock deserves love and affection more than anyone. He’d be a pill, but his Soulmate would still love him, wouldn’t she?
He can hear Sherlock say something, that rumbling baritone drifting through his ears, but he can’t catch the words.
There’s a moment of silence, the three men soaking in the story, and emotion, but John can’t help but ask, “What happened to the child?”
The thought doesn’t even occur to kiss him, until their lips are suddenly together, and John pulls him as close as he possibly can.
The music stops, and Sherlock turns. His face is pensieve, proving John’s hypothesis, but he shakes his head.
It makes John shiver, and step closer to Sherlock, as if he will protect him from any boogeymen that may show up.
But the clothes smell old, a hint of mildew clings to them. It’s been a while since anyone’s worn these clothes, or visited here at all.
John Watson owns and wears a collection of the ugliest sweaters Sherlock has ever seen. He’s almost tempted to set fire to them, just to see if they scream or profess their love to Satan before turning into ash.
John raises an eyebrow, and is about to ask why Sherlock thinks that he alone has the skillset to capture a man whose entire job description is evasion, but then he catches sight of something in the corner of his eye.
But one of them opens with a shaking creak, and they’re sucked into the old institution. John follows after Sherlock and the inspectors, feeling useless as they’re ushered into the Expressionist wing. There’s no body, no use for a medical doctor here, but Sherlock had insisted.
But, whichever way, it’s incredibly distracting for him to try to be a proper doctor at a crime scene when the most gorgeous man he knows is undressing him with his eyes.
“One of Lestrade’s lackeys got lectured today,” he gloats, unable to control himself past two seconds. “He made a grave mistake in his lab work, turns out the suspect has a bloodborne disease that, if that test had been done immediately, would have narrowed down the field considerably and saved innumerable Scotland Yard resources.”
Of course, he has to be, with Sherlock as a partner. Otherwise, they’d never get any cases done. Their teamwork reminds Sherlock of the various cop movies he saw in uni, the good cop, bad cop routine. Completely idiotic and dramatic.
First, of course, he has to procure a tall mirror. There is one already, hung against the door of the bathroom, but it seems like a Sisyphean feat to remove it from its screws, screw it into the bedroom wall, then put it back in its rightful place the following morning.
, John realises as he makes his way up the stairs. How stupid would that be, for him to make this trip and nearly have a heart attack, only for Sherlock to be off with some new case.
Which way to go, then? There is no visible light in either direction, and I have no idea where each passage ends. I have no way of knowing how my decision will affect the outcome.
“What?!” Sherlock demands, his face growing into a mixture of disbelief and anger. “Where did you see him? Was he following you?” John must have a guilty look on his face, because Sherlock shakes his head. “You scheduled a meet up? What the hell were you thinking?! Why didn’t you tell me?!”
Another shot rings out, and this one John swears he can hear fly by his head. He tries to turn and take aim, but he doesn’t have a shot, not without putting multiple priceless paintings at risk.
Lestrade shakes his head. “Right, of course. Ignoring however you figured that out -- You do know how many strings I have to pull to get you to crime scenes? You can’t just run off again! You didn’t answer any of my questions, or--”
She dresses, and John finds he’s too tired to even look at her body or take in her curves. He doesn’t even hear when she shuts the door and leaves, already half asleep.
He turns off the alarm, and gets out of bed slowly and deliberately. He doesn’t even dare to look at the Watch until he has on trousers, terrified that somehow him deciding on the black slacks would delay this further.
He forces himself to look into Sherlock’s eyes, which are so full of hurt and anger that he can’t stand it. “What?”
A message, for me, then? A threat? What are they threatening? That I’ll end up like Knight, murdered, face down in the rubbish? Hasn’t erasing my memory been enough?
Moriarty cocks his head. “That’s all the enthusiasm you can muster?” he teases. “It’s only what you’ve been waiting for your whole life.”
He slowly begins to rationalize this, through the days and weeks beyond. Perhaps Sherlock’s Soulmate had been just as odd as he was, but perhaps that had come with some other life-threatening disorder, and she had died. Perhaps that was part of the reason why the Watch was removed.
He had. So far the story had not become a huge phenomenon in the press, but there had been a snippet in the first few pages of the newspaper. Three people, all wealthy socialites, all found in odd places, with a fatal dose in their system. Not one of them had a history of being suicidal before. A small jolt of excitement runs through him, but he manages to keep a straight face as they step into the bare room, where an older woman lay face down on the floor.
“Sherlock!” she huffs, catching her breath and adjusting her face mask. “How many times… must I tell you, to stop…” she trails off, as she often does. Poor thing. Even with the mask hiding her lower face, John can tell how much she’s blushing.
His favorite food is pasta carbonara, which he has never told John but every time they get take away it is the first thing he suggests. He takes his coffee with two sugars and a splash of milk.
I cringe as I reach the ground, trying to ignore the animal corpse behind me, and not think about the things I possibly stepped through in the dark before.
“I didn’t take you to be a Conspirator,” he snaps defensively, as it’s the only thing he can think of to say. A conspirator, a traitor to the State, was someone who believed the State was wrong, that Freedom was lost in the State bringing Happiness. There were violent organizations, terrorist groups that attacked many State officials, bombed office buildings, even at times killed families.
“Erm, John Watson,” John quickly quickly says, holding out his right hand and giving the other an apologetic smile.
“Is that what happened when you met Daddy?” John asked excitedly, taking her hand and looking at her Watch, which read no numbers now.
John lets his head fall into the crook of Sherlock’s shoulder, and the other immediately wraps an arm around him. Why does this have to feel perfect?
They’re out of breath, and John’s lips are cracked and aching, but somehow it manages to work. John bites, sucks, digs his nails into Sherlock’s shoulders, doing everything he can to take as much as he can of the detective, and the other does the same, keeping John’s head in place as he explores the doctor’s mouth with his tongue.
Not that John would ever refuse. He does love Sherlock, no matter how much he’d like to deny it. It hangs in the air between them, both of them knowing that John needs this, and would never turn it down, but neither ever mentioning it, for fear of shattering their fragile relationship, which is only just being mended.
Bile fills his throat as he tries to hush the girl again. She’s so young. Too young. But she was also too young for a child, too young to be alone, much like he was at her age. Too young to take pills they said would kill the fetus but would also kill you.
He keeps kissing John as he undoes his own belt and trousers. John can feel Sherlock’s fist graze across his stomach and the small jump of his hips, starting to pump and get himself off. The detective pulls away and buries his face in John’s neck, gasping and grunting softly.
“The where is simple to answer,” Sherlock says, striding forward. “All of the pieces taken are from this era. Different forms of art, and schools, but they’re all from mid-century, Antiques before the new Revolution. Not very many museums house that epoch of art, do they?”
I eat the rest of the cookies quickly, and do not attempt the tea again, eyeing it warily as my tongue begins to go numb.
John shivers at how casual Sherlock says this, when it fills John with terror. Without Sherlock, what would he be?
It’s only when John is lying on his back, with Sherlock over him, that he begins to feel the panic again.
John stands and smiles softly at Sherlock, and tries not to let the small, probably sarcastic comment get to his head too much.
Sherlock takes his hands, tugs him along, with a ravenous look in his eyes. He walks them to his bedroom, and once again begins to kiss John, biting at his lip and purring every few moments.
Sherlock smiles proudly, setting his instrument down at that soliloquy. He isn’t sure which answer he prefers: those heartfelt, loving ones, or the ones where John gapes and struggles for minutes, his mouth forming the forbidden affirmative, in the end only able to smile bashfully.
Their eyes adjust to the dark a few moments later, and they find each other in bed once more, Sherlock curling into John, resting on his chest. For just a moment, they’re silent, settling into sleep, when Sherlock glances up. “Do you love me?” he asks.
When it nears the time John promised to be in by, Sherlock remembers his relation to Penelope. The two of them waiting expectantly for their love to return home, feeling almost hopeless.
“No,” Sherlock sighs. “He’s not going to do anything. He could. He certainly has the evidence. He’d have a bit of difficulty explaining how it’s all illegally obtained, but he’d be able to snake around the issue. But instead he told you, knowing that you’d come and tell me. It’s all a part of his game.”
“Of course. What else would it be?” John asked with a small laugh, but Sherlock shrugs, and turns back. His smile slips. There was definitely more to that reaction, probably some harsh memory of the past hidden in that simple shrug.
John scowls, but relents, and takes a slow sip. “This conversation isn’t over, Sherlock!” he snaps, his blood still boiling. “Tea doesn’t make this better!” He stops, finding that he has to take another sip with how hoarse his voice feels
He could tell him, John thinks. Three years of regretting never telling Sherlock that he loved him, and the man is right here.
The man’s smile widens and he shrugs. “It’s not as if you were going to introduce me, how else would I know whether he’d be good for you?” he asks. “I did promise to protect you, did I not?”
“Certainly,” Sherlock shrugs. “I enjoy your company, John, whether or not you happen to be clothed.”
When he glances up, he swears he can see a touch of a smile on Sherlock’s lips. “Neither do I,” he says.
“Then why the playing?” He found his own voice was soft too, as if speaking louder would break something.
The boy is hardly taller than her, still hasn’t hit his final growth spurt, is wearing the latest fashion fad of skinny jeans, with a belt uselessly around his waist, and a jacket that is at least two sizes too big for him. The only thing not up to date is his hair, the style of which Sherlock thinks was never popular with anyone under the age of thirty-five. But on the sight of him, the girl smiles, and approaches him with a dreamy look. The boy returns it without a thought.
It doesn’t take John long to grow used to his new life, despite what everyone he tells this to believes. Chasing criminals, sleuthing about crime scenes, the long nights without sleep… It’s oddly comforting for him. He craves the danger, the adrenaline of running for his life that was so common in Afghanistan, but now, there’s a way out. After each case he’s allowed to go to bed and sleep, without fear of a bomb going off while he rests.
As I listen to the rain, another sound echoes in. Laughter, from close by, a woman’s, clear and shining. It’s followed by a man’s voice. I cannot hear what he is saying, but he is cheerful, he’s laughing along with her. I listen in interest, staring across the narrow alleyway to the darkened building opposite.
Sherlock pulls his lips away just enough so John can see his face completely, no longer contorted with rage, but still looking just as determined. “I want to fuck you,” he growls in a voice that makes John gasp and shiver.
He pulls out his Sig, drawing it at his hip as he slowly approached. Examine the perimetre, secure threat, use caution when going in. His back is pressed against the wall, and he moves in, walking slowly into the room with his gun drawn.
As nervous as John is, Mary is shockingly alright with him moving in with her so soon. Although, then again, why shouldn’t she be?
Before I’m able to analyse this properly, another draft gusts through me. It’s coming from my right, behind the table. I walk hesitantly over, my feet padding softly on the tiled floor.
Mary still looks unsure. “Probably chocolate cake. Those really rich ones,” she says. “I could eat those all the time, if they didn’t have such obvious health effects.”
Christ, she’s young, he realizes as he looks her over. Seventeen at most. She’s small, and her long black hair is splayed above her body. Her arms writhe, and her head bobs up and down in an epileptic spasm.
, he thinks, wincing to himself, and stops. This sort of thing wasn’t supposed to happen. He takes a breath, and fixes a fake smile on his face before he turns.
It’s that same night that he feels something, something nagging at the corner of his heart as John laughs and stuffs far more chow mein into his mouth than can really be considered proper.
It must be around eight in the morning. There are a fair amount of people bustling around the streets, men in suits holding briefcases and boys in caps rushing past on bicycles. As far as I can see there’s no one just loitering, although, given that it is a bomb-threatened square, I can see why.
attracted to me, and you want this! I’ve seen it, don’t bother denying it. I was even content to never let it come to fruition, if you preferred to remain in denial, but this is--” his nostrils flare. “I will not allow you to destroy this relationship because of your insecurities!”
John sighs, not knowing what Greg wants. He pockets his phone, accepting Greg Lestrade as another friendship he has to lose because of this.
Within a few minutes Sherlock let’s out a choked breath, and John can feel warmth pool on his stomach as Sherlock settles against him.
“He’s been fine,” John says, slowly, wishing more than ever that he had Sherlock’s knack for deduction, just to see what the fuck Moriarty was getting at. The man pinches at his wrist, as if disposing of lint, when his entire outfit of course is immaculate. What does that mean?
Now, he pulls John (or does John pull him?) into the bedroom, desperately kissing the other. He’s so distracted by John’s mouth and body that he doesn’t notice his own clothes being shucked off his body, which he regards a bit in surprise, but doesn’t particularly care. Likewise, John is so preoccupied with undressing Sherlock that he doesn’t seem to notice the absence of the usual periodic table on the wall, and the replacement mirror.
He doesn’t bother to contact the other, as he figures that Sherlock doesn’t want much to do with him now that Mary is in the picture, understandably. And, given that he has received no texts from Greg detailing Sherlock's
As she says it, John knows that she’s right, but the words make his heart sink. Never seeing Sherlock again, all because he’d been stupid, let this go too far, didn’t tell the other that this was coming soon, whatever the hell it was that made Sherlock so insane.
She groans in pain, and John tries to shush her. She grabs his arm, and her eyes open, tears in them.
It’s a few days later that he realizes what’s odd about Sherlock’s appearance. He’s so used to seeing it, that it’s completely unexpected to see it not there.
Another thing about this good mood is that it makes Sherlock even more blunt that John could have imagined.
Another pursed frown makes its way onto Lestrade’s face, and he shakes his head, tapping something on his screen again. “What’s connecting the chairman of a nonprofit committee, a widowed octogenarian, an estate lawyer, and a madam?” he asks, shaking his head.
He also still doesn’t ask the questions that burned in his mind so many years before. He could so easily, reach out a hand, ask any of the fiery questions that still occupy almost every moment of being with Sherlock.
John immediately deletes the message, because it makes his heart beat too fast, and his stomach churns. He goes home, to Mary, to the woman he’s supposed to be with, and the life he’s supposed to have.
I step down the hall, barefoot (she’s neglected to give me shoes), following the soft sound of humming into the kitchen, where Mrs. Hudson is standing at the stove, pouring what seems to be tea into a green ceramic mug. A small plate of shortbread biscuits lies next to it, and the smell of onions, herbs, and meat roasting invades my nostrils.
That cathartic presence helped him as he was bored to tears during his medical exams, kept his mind focused on the future when his father died, kept him sane and on the ground during those sleepless, painful nights when he contemplated jumping out of his bedroom window because living hurt so damn much.
Sherlock pauses. “About a month ago I noticed the for rent sign leaving the building across the street,” he says slowly. “But there were never any movers.”
“Excuse me?” he hears John’s voice from behind him. It sounds almost angry. Sherlock stops and turns on his heels to see John glowering angrily at Anderson.
He blinks in some confusion, glancing over to the empty table, where Sherlock’s mobile still is. It only takes a few moments for curiosity to settle in, and a few more for it to become unbearable.
When Sherlock mentions this to him, John looks shocked for a moment, then grabs the end of the sweater he’s wearing (gray, wool, with rather sloppy and frightening-looking sheep crocheted along the hem), and mumbles “my mum made this for me,” in a devoted, defensive tone.
After the mirror is purchased and taken back  into the flat (Mrs Hudson is passing through and looks surprised by it, but she’s long since learned not to question whatever Sherlock brings home), he takes it up to his room, where just that morning he took off the large poster of the periodic table, for use of this, and experiments with it. Hanging it somewhere, and then lying on the bed, looking to see the reflection.
At any given point, in school, at the bus stop, during a commercial break on the telly, each child would be watching their wrist, waiting for that little ticker to hit zero.
John takes the opportunity to go to the kitchen, to get some water. His heart is pounding, and it takes an enormous amount of willpower to just turn his wrist to face him.
He’s silent, until the dark haired detective hands him his plate and mug of coffee, and sits down himself.
It’s in the morning; John has just gotten up, walked downstairs to make himself some coffee, when he sees Sherlock sprawled in his chair, asleep with a book in his lap. After a few moments the detective yawns and stretches, his arms outstretched to the sides. For once his bare right wrist is in plain view. Then it hits John.
“What does it matter what I wanted to be when I was a kid, though?” she asks. “Why would that help anything?”
It takes half the amount of time ascending as it did descending, most likely because of my eagerness to be out of the sewer. Within half a minute I am directly beneath the light, another hole in a floor.
“On your feet!” a man shouts. I press myself against the wall on an impulse, to hide from his threatening tone. A childlike fear, I remind myself, his voice cannot hurt me.
I almost vomit at the sight of the stagnant water, which is a shade of brown that I have never seen before, shines as if oil has been spilled on it, and contains multiple pollutants, including an old boot, a large branch of a tree, and a rotting carcass of a sewer rat. Oh, God.
He heads inside. He’s halfway up the stairs when he hears the front door open and shut again. Dammit. He’d been hoping that he could avoid the other.
“Is that an ‘A’?” John asks in disbelief. His heart sinks once more, as he knows when convicts have their Watches removed, the ‘C’ they receive is by branding.
“Excuse me?” a voice calls from behind me. It sounds meek, yet holds an underlying force of will. I whip around to see a small, older woman, wearing a modest middle class dress and folding her arms across her chest, pursing her lips as she regards me. It is truly terrifying.
Still, just like Christmas Eve and before he was sent to Afghanistan, John does manage to fall asleep at some point, his wrist tucked carefully underneath him to assuage the temptation to stare at it like a teenager.
But, then again, perhaps Sherlock felt no guilt. He had no Soulmate, no poor woman he was letting down. Why not commit a sin, if nothing is keeping you from doing so? Perhaps he was trying to punish the very government that had denied him a chance at happiness, by becoming as corrupt as possible for them.
John blinks in surprise, realizing as Sherlock mentioned it that his shoulders were indeed square and pressed back at that moment. He hardly had the time to correct it before the other begins speaking again.
Sherlock smiles, and goes back to his laptop, trying to ignore the hot flush in his cheeks and the ache in his heart.
“Naughty boy, John,” the heavier one chuckles to the handsome one. “I saw you coming here from Mary’s direction. Just a chat that lasted a bit longer than expected, then?”
“I’m going to bed, Sherlock,” he replies, his voice hardly a whisper, and he continues on the stair.
“Not a suicide,” Sherlock disagrees, his half smile growing into a smirk. “At this point I think we can rule it out as a cause of death, hm?”
“As we discussed before, I did not serve, making that one weakness in my intellect. Whether or not this is a common tactic taught to all men, or just those shipped off, does manage to narrow things down a bit in terms of suspect.” With that, Sherlock turns to Lestrade and the other constables, and claps his hand together.
“Ah, thank you, darling,” Mycroft says sweetly, taking the cup. As he takes a sip, John gets a glimpse of his Watch, and sees that it’s blank.
“Right, fine, whatever you want to call it,” the man sighs, rolling his eyes, until they finally settle on John, whose brow is furrowed in confusion as the others talk. “Who’s this?”
When the car finally pulls up to Baker Street, John all but throws the money at the driver before rushing inside.
But there was nothing he could do. Eric had the legal standing. No officer would separate the sacred Family, even if there wasn’t a baby yet. It was only when someone was in mortal danger that they removed the Soulmate.
I eat the remainder of the meal incredibly fast, and find myself sitting politely as she still works on her plate, perhaps out of politeness, or maybe because I don’t know what else to do.
The room is clean and dark, even with the light on, smells of dust, yet is perfectly kept. There are no personal effects, just a mahogany wardrobe, and across the room, a white-sheeted queen bed with a metal frame. Anything else that may have been here was taken out long ago.
Mike introduces John, and John reaches out a hand, his eyes on the pale, bony wrist that snakes its way from the table and takes John’s hand firmly. The way the man moves his hand, however, keeps the back of his hand up, making his palm, and his Watch on his wrist, invisible to John.
But there’s something odd about his appearance, something that’s nagged at John since meeting him, but he can’t think of what on earth it could be… He is exquisite, not quite normal looking in his beauty, but there’s something more.
He huffs, waiting for some response, some reaction that can make him yell again, but instead all Sherlock does is get something out of the cupboard, and pour hot water into John’s mug with whatever tea he’s found.
Sherlock pauses, and while John wishes that it’s to think of an answer, they both know it’s only for dramatic effect.
Her level of concern visibly increases. “And do you have a place to go?” Her voice is soft, almost scared.
Sherlock talks a mile a minute when he’s particularly excited about something, and when he’s had a breakthrough with a case after three days of no sleep, his explanation of the crime is jumbled so much it sounds like a different language, but the detective never seems to notice.
He’s getting the hang of the Soulmate life, or at least he is until another message from Greg comes in:
The fact that the message was a telegram worried him. Chiron rarely sent messages to demigods that no longer attended Olympus Boarding School. Younger demigods were likely either at the school or on a quest, but for older demigods, Iris messaging would be out of the question, being too easily noticed by mortals if it appeared at the wrong time, even through the mist. If he did need to get word to any of his old students he usually sent a letter. Though telegrams would be delivered faster, they would also be viewed by multiple mortals in the process of being sent, so the wording had to be vague to avoid rousing suspicion. Chiron only ever sent telegrams if something was truly urgent.
As Holmes hurriedly folded his nightgown, a scrap of cloth fell out of its pocket. He picked it up, inspecting it. It was a handkerchief. Unfolding it, he breathed in sharply. It was the same handkerchief as the woman had given him in his dream. Embroidered in the corner was the same tiny bronze sword, stitched with such detail that it almost seemed real.
Watson thought for a minute. Even demigods were often fooled by the mist. They could see through it better than most mortals, but it still made monsters appear normal until they attacked. He had never been fooled by this. He had only survived as long as he had because he always saw monsters for what they were immediately.
Watson smiled slightly, recalling the years he had spent here in his youth. Then he hurried toward the porch.
“Right as usual, Holmes,” Watson replied, giving the detective a weak smile, “Hopefully it isn’t too serious, but I ought to pay my... brother a visit, just to be sure.”
Edit: (Jan. 19, 2021) The first four chapters of the sequel have been posted! I should’ve added this earlier.
I’m really sorry for posting this late, especially with the cliffhanger at the end of last chapter. I don’t even have a good excuse, it just completely slipped my mind yesterday.
Edit: (Dec. 26, 2020) The sequel to this is almost done! I typically write the whole story out in advance and then edit each chapter the week it comes out, to make things easier on myself. I plan to post the first chapter of the sequel the week after winter break, so sometime in early January.
The cause of his distress was the message that he had received this morning, just as Holmes had been paying him a visit. He had been elated to see the detective, as always. One of the things Watson had missed most since his marriage was the near constant presence of his dearest friend, but Holmes’ safety was well worth any sadness he felt at their separation.
“That girl has quite a lot of energy, doesn’t she?” Watson mused, “She reminds me a bit of myself at that age.”
The ex-army doctor glanced out of the train window at the scenery speeding past. Why did the school have to be so far from London?
The woman had, by this point, noticed him. She was observing him with oddly familiar piercing grey eyes.
“It was actually Lydia who first realized that the “Boswell” line could be referring to you,” Chiron continued, “I sent you a message immediately.”
Holmes filed the strange pause in Watson’s speech away for further analysis, and with that both Watson and Holmes donned their coats and exited out into the snow, each heading in opposite directions.
“I won’t keep you, but remember to be careful,” Chiron warned, “You know how important it is to take these things seriously.”
The centaur walked down the hallway, his hooves clicking loudly on the hardwood floor. The two demigods trailed behind him. Watson watched as he opened the door to his study and Lydia raced inside, plopping herself down in the nearest armchair. The older child of Apollo followed her, sitting down in the armchair next to hers. Chiron went to the side of the desk opposite the two and turned to face them.
The lack of stains and wear on the woman’s clothing indicated that her entire outfit was new, and though it was fairly simple and lacked most of the adornments typical of the upper class, it was high quality and fit well enough that it must’ve been tailored specifically for her. If Holmes had to guess, he would say that the hairpin was likely also custom-made, given the unique design.
“Ah, well,” Watson sighed, “Prophecies rarely make sense until afterwards. I ought to get back to London.”
“As touching as this is, we have important matters to discuss,” Chiron interrupted, “Follow me, both of you.”
Again, sorry for any mistakes. I’m still trying to figure out how the heck formatting works on this site. If you missed the edit I made on the Author’s Note for the last chapter, I plan on updating this every Wednesday.
Holmes knew his Watson well. The good doctor had nerves of steel, but he was clearly shaken by whatever news he had just received.
“What in the…” Holmes began. Then the whole room shook, and the fire spilled out from the fireplace onto the rug.
“Indeed,” Chiron replied, “but we have important matters to discuss. Can you see through the mist? Completely and totally?”
Just as the detective was opening his mouth to begin to explain the strange dream and the mysterious appearance of the handkerchief, there was a knock on the front door. He could hear the maid answer it.
Sorry this chapter is almost a week late. I had it written and everything, I just forgot to upload it. Well, that’s ADHD for ya. This is the last chapter. I’ve already started writing the next story in this series, but it’s still in the “figuring out the plot” phase, so it’ll be awhile before I post the first chapter.
“I apologize, Holmes, we must continue this discussion another time,” Watson hastily explained, “I have just received word from a family friend…”
Watson called for the maid to bring the telegram to the dining room, where he and Holmes were sitting. As he read the message, the doctor’s eyes widened, color draining from his face. Then he quickly shoved the scrap of paper into his pocket and stood up.
Watson hurried towards the train station, the cold winter wind buffeting him, and the telegram in his pocket weighing so heavily on him it might’ve been lead. Upon arriving at the train station, he purchased a ticket for the first train heading north. He paced along the platform, unable to sit still in his agitation. Only once the train had arrived and he had safely boarded did Watson’s mind slow down enough to allow him to think the situation through.
He hastened to get dressed. Perhaps today he could visit Watson. The doctor’s mere presence often cleared his mind, aiding his ability to find solutions to even the most convoluted riddles they had come across on the many cases that they had solved together.
He continued to pace. The sun rose, its light shining off the thick blanket of snow already coating London, and a new day began. Holmes could hear Mrs. Hudson retrieving the paper outside.
“As always, my dear Holmes, I am at your command,” Watson responded, “Mary is visiting a friend of hers in the country today, and my practice hasn’t been busy.”
“Practically all demigod children are born out of wedlock, yet most still have a mother and father,” Chiron pointed out, “and even an orphan would’ve had to have had a father.”
So... a lot has been going on lately. This is a chaotic time for everyone and I hope that you’re all doing okay. I know that fanfiction can be a way for people to escape and distract themselves from bad things going on in their lives, it certainly has been for me, and I understand that many people will need that right now, so I do plan on continuing to update this fic. That being said, I feel that it would be a bit irresponsible of me to not at least acknowledge everything that’s been happening in the world right now. Just to make things clear, I fully support Black Lives Matter. There is something deeply wrong with any system that allows for tragedies like the murders of George Floyd and so many other people of color. This issue affects all of us. In the words of Martin Luther King Jr., “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere”. I am not the most qualified to speak on the topic of police brutality towards people of color, so I urge all of you to at the very least stay informed and try to learn about this issue, and if you are able, what you can do to help.
“I’m afraid I’ll have to wait a moment to hear your story, Holmes,” Watson said, looking apologetic, “this may require my immediate attention.”
“There has been a new prophecy,” the teacher explained, “and we believe that it may be referring to you, Doctor Watson.”
The sight of Watson smiling up at him made something inside Holmes’ chest swell. He shoved it back down. He knew perfectly well the romantic nature of his feelings towards his closest friend, just as he knew that those feelings were not reciprocated. Watson was a married man, after all. Some part of Holmes secretly hoped that his affections were returned, but the more sensible part of him knew that there was no use wasting time daydreaming about a chance so hopelessly slim.
For those of you who want to know, the water is from the River Mnemosyne, controlled by the goddess Mnemosyne, which some believed was a sixth river in the underworld. Followers of Mnemosyne believed that drinking from the river before you drank from the River Lethe to be reborn would allow you to retain your memories. Like basically all myths, this is only one version. I decided to go with it because I liked the idea. I’m trying to keep this in line with Riordan canon, just how I imagined things would happen in Victorian England, so I probably would’ve moved the river out of the underworld, but I didn’t really need to go into that much detail in the story. The thing about Hyacinthus being a child of Clio is also only true in some versions of the story, in some he’s just a regular mortal. Again, I liked the idea, so I went with it.
