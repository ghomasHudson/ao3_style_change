Maybe this is the perfect segue to bring up all that fanfiction. Cas should know about this, after all, it’s his body too that’s being described in wonderf… disgusting prose.
Outside, the cold nighttime air pricked in his lungs. Cas breathed deeply in an attempt to stop feeling so annoyingly alive.
“Dude, is that a shelf full of, uh,
The next few evenings, Dean keeps going back to this weird archive site. He’s going to google soon where he can burn its servers like he’s putting a ghost to rest. Cause damn, those stories are haunting.
Cas slowly lowers his cutlery on the plate and wipes his mouth on a cloth. “I don’t know, John,” he says slowly, maintaining eye contact. “Didn’t
CASTIEL
Well. There’s one thing he
He shakes with it, cheek pressed against the fabric, feeling a bit of cum hitting his chin, and not caring  one single fucking iota.
Holy crap. Cas looks furious. “What, Dean? Is there some joke you haven’t thought of yet?”
His heart stops as a light shatters. Dean wasn’t supposed to be here yet! Heaven was Cas’s safe haven. Good Lord. Did Dean get himself killed
He hears Cas sketching.
The fight is simple enough, they behead a few of them, slice through another, work together to fight them just like the good old times.
Dude. What kinda weirdo is this Jensen Ackles?
“W- what about my pants?” Dean asks and he’s not sure why he needs to know.
! But of course… of course I love you.”
“Cas!” Dean cries out.
!” She sticks the sharp point of her elbow into Dean’s side.
And that murderous battle angel
Cas is gazing at him with a strange look in his eyes.
But it feels real good not to have any hang-ups whatsoever about this kind of stuff. Thank god he’s outgrown any issues he’d have with showing… closeness. With a bro.
Dean briefly closes his eyes, taking a measured breath.
But that’s all, though. Nothing more to it than that.
He stuffs another Dabb pie in his face.
He eyes up the bleeding package and gathers all his courage. For Dean. For Dean.
Just like the other victims, Cas disappeared.
Dean frowns. It suddenly dawns on him. “You didn’t think you deserve to be saved.”
Dean swallows. Yes he is. He wants to show himself, fearlessly, as Cas did.
“You’re a natural at this, Cas,” Sam teases, and takes a swig.
Dean glances at Cas. The guy’s looking out the window, hands plucking away at the trenchcoat.
He stares up at the angel, and feels his bottom lip friggin’ quiver. His voice comes out low, raw and pleading. “I need you, Cas.”
Small mercy: no eye contact. He’s just stuck looking at his knee for what? Five minutes? Ten? Cas never specified. How long does he want to look at Dean?
— like very fucking naked no bees to cover up a damn inch of that skin — and now everything’s just gonna be weird between them. For the rest of their lives.
He paces to the door. This was enough to drive a good man crazy.
“Hell yeah,” Dean says. That much is true.
He hopes nothing else will start growing along with it, because there is definitely something in Cas’ eyes that flashes with a certain degree of heat.
If Dean’s honest with himself, which he of course always is, then damn it, he is enjoying it just as much. He adds another finger, feeling Cas stretch. Dean bites his lip - he imagines his dick breaching that tight hole soon.
“No!” Dean calls out. “No, that would be stupid.”
Holy shit. It’s this Jensen guy’s personal notes.
His makeup artist ushers him up. “Please remove your shirt, Mr. Ackles.”
Jack frowned. “You needed a project. You were moping around heaven, you didn’t know what to do with yourself.”
Dean’s just ogling — erhm,
He slides a warm hand down Cas’ spine, set alight with the memory of drawing him, and settles for the dip of his hip.
"You know, ever since we met and ever since I pulled you out of Hell, knowing you has changed me." The tears in Cas' eyes have only grown more and more, threatening to pour out by the second. "Because you cared, I cared. I cared about you. I cared about Sam. I cared about Jack. I cared about the whole world because of you. You changed me, Dean." The tears have fallen and are strolling down Cas' cheek slowly. Cas takes a shuddering breath.
.” Dean shifts uncomfortably in his seat.
“Hello?” He answers, while pinning a pastor. Call that multitasking.
Dean falls silent, struggling against the next words, failing.
Pastor Richard coughs wildly into his cigarette.
He’s… he’s in love with Cas.
Then, in a flash of inspiration, he reaches into his back pocket. Unfolds the little crumpled note, full of Jensen’s handwriting and a little of his own.
“I’m not-“
“You didn’t have to come and try to humiliate me, Dean,” he mumbles.
At that, Dean flinches, and Sam immediately regrets his words. He closes his eyes briefly and tries to calm the anger coursing through his veins.
Is this Cas’ first blowjob?
Dean’s doing this For Science, okay?
This was supposed to reveal why Cas is mad at him, not make him even sadder.
He can’t be making noises like this, damn it. So Dean turns around. Oh god, oh no, now he’s looking right at Cas.
”, boomed behind them.
Shit. Of course.
He’d slip his underwear back on quickly afterwards, too. Just wasn’t hygienic.
Why is Cas acting like it’s a burden on him to live here?
Chuck nods.
Technically.
“Ew, Dean! Cas is pretty much my
Dean gulps.
wants to do this. But to save the entire world? Just a small thing.
Dean shakes his head. Unbe-lievable. Does Sam think he’s blind? He can see Sam’s eyes moving between him and Cas. He’s standing
The light in him is fading. It’s like watching a fish cruelly left on the shore, slowly struggling less and less against the suffocating air.
“That one only applies to me, Sam,” Cas frowns. “You’re very bad at this game.”
Dean licks his lips.
It’s super weird seeing his colleague’s face with a different personality. Even weirder when Jared’s not giving him a wedgie.
“What’s wrong with my pitch?” Cas asked in the gravely, manly voice he’d adopted in recent years as if his angel balls had dropped at the sight of Dean Winchester.
Dean can’t reciprocate.
Then Claire abruptly unpeels herself from him and punches his shoulder.
“Scene twenty-four take two,” Richard announces, and silence falls. On the outskirts of the set, Dean can see a crewmember actually recording this atrocity with her phone. Absolute madness.
But he gets lost in the bunker and might even be running in actual circles while trying to act casual to Sam whenever he accidentally arrives back at the war room space again in this whole maze of a building.
“You lusted after me, you little fag. You don’t think I knew? Every one of your angel friends warned me about it. Even demons saw it.”
Cas clears his throat, keeping his gaze firmly locked on the floor. “Dean… For what it’s worth…. I would give anything not to have you do this.”
“Why is that?” Claire asks, pushing vegetables to the edge of her plate before stuffing her mouth with pasta and sauce like she’s trying to break the world record for lasagna eating.
Dean falls to his knees. “Please… you can leave me here. Just save Cas.”
Then, he walks to his bed, throws his open duffel bag on there, and, back turned to Cas, he lets his towel slip off.
Dean’s room would be.
Maybe while Cas was reliving their final moments forever, well, so was Dean.
He closes his eyes, feeling Cas’ presence so close, and rubs his thumb along Cas’ jaw toward his ear. He wraps his fingers around Cas’ neck and waits.
He’s positioned in front of the chair now, one leg drawn up and leaning backwards, hands flatly resting behind him. The leg offers some blessed modesty in the — lap region, at least from Dean’s angle. Cas’ face is turned the other way, exposing the smooth muscled side of his neck.
It’s a rush Dean never wants to stop chasing. He moves his hands closer, now holding Cas’ cheeks in his hands as they deepen their kiss, get lost in the -
“Isn’t it?” Dean raises his voice. “You’re forgetting who you’re talking to, boy.”
Cas waves a hand dismissively. “No, it’s the same one. I went back and un-stabbed him.”
Dean carries on.
A single tear slides from Cas’ eye, but Dean catches it with his thumb.
He forces his mouth into a half smile. “That wasn’t half bad acting, Cas!”
“But Jimbo,” John says after a long silence. “What was it like being bodysnatched by an angel?”
What team are they playing for?
“Cas, I think I’ve…. dislocated my shoulder.”
His right arm stretches over Cas’ shoulders, keeping him locked inside.
“We have 58 minutes and 43 seconds,” Jack reminds him.
Cas blinks.
Cas’ soul appears to have ascended on the spot.
He takes a deep, slightly shuddering breath. This is just two friends sharing a motel bed. Nothing weird at all.
Dean claps the angel on one shoulder, pulling him closer so they aren’t overheard. “Hey Cas?”
Finally, he finds Dean’s room.
If Cas even
After he… after they…
Oh, he’s pushing it now!
If he’s still doing the damn toy analogy - Dean feels like a square trying to squish through the wrong damn hole. Opening! Not hole.
NOT LIKE THAT.
He allows air to become part of everything. Around him, inside him. Consuming him. It’s almost religious. Divine.
Dean reaches over and touches that hand.
-ZAP-
Fuck.
Then it clicks that Cas is kissing his hand, and that Dean is letting him. He meets Cas’ eyes watching him kiss all five of his fingers, one by one, with growing, monstrous intensity.
Cas looks down at his glass. He licks his upper lip. It’s his turn, but no sound comes out of the angel.
Dean grins at “They’re welcome to join the crowd” and “Sir, I am a lesbian”, though both don’t really fit his mood.
His eyes flash over Dean in quick succession, never bothering long with particular parts, while still looking entirely thoughtful. His movements on the paper are swift.
Anyway.
“I’m just trying to catch up to your small playing field, Dean,” Cas says, and he drinks.
“Cas?”
Dean lifts the pen and starts scribbling away.
Cas stares at him, seems to mull over that information. Then, he slowly turns his head away. He closes his hands and buries them in his pockets.
He brushes more 'sex hair' out of Cas’ face.
Dean finds himself trying to get his breath steady in the bathroom, when a fucking
“To be fair it’s mainly solo action. A whole lot of solo action actually.” Dean can practically hear Kevin’s smirk in his voice.
He shouldn’t ask any weird questions that indicate he’s read any kind of fic. Just be normal. Just be normal.
,” Sam yells, exasperated.
Right around four in the morning is when the single man tears start over Dean. It’s unfair! It’s just so unfair. The fans are gonna kill him. Jensen, not Dean. Dean’s already gonna be dead.
There’s no ‘one’. There’s just silence.
Dean startles. “Chuck!”
Dean quickly interrupts. Can’t have her getting mad. “He means we did you a favor with Billie, that’s all. Just… tell us where he is, please?”
"So, do you have it?" Betty asked, unfazed. Sam and Dean looked at her, confused. "The book. Hand over the book." The brothers glanced at each other hesitantly. "Wow. Slower than they look."
"Goodbye... Dean," Sam gasped at his lack for oxygen.
Dean looked down to also remember his half-brother. "Poor bastard never caught a break." Understatement.
"Ketch. Good dude. Your mom and him seem happy together," Bobby explained flatly. Dean's face changed a little bit, still a little hesitant of the relationship, but he grew to trust Ketch, so he's figured he should trust him with his mom.
"Hey, guys," Chuck grinned, standing ten feet away from the brothers. "Enjoying a little alone time?" He added, just to throw some salt in the wound.
Michael slow claps, eyes rolling far back into his head. "Bravo," he smirks. "Really, a great show. So entertaining. Too bad I have Dean buried so deep in my mind he couldn't watch," Michael raises his hands to his eyes and mocks tears falling down.
"Wow. Look at you, bro. The almost-mighty." Michael gave him a small glare. Lucifer knocked over his own deck of cards. "Hmm. I cheated," he chuckled. Sam and Dean walked into the room to see a very much pissed off Michael who pointed his finger at his little brother.
Sam pats his back and then whispers, "Knock 'em dead." Cas gives him an almost shocked face. "I'm not going to
Dean whips the spear around, catching Michael's new vessel on the arm. The cut is strong enough to rip his shirt and even draw blood. He groans, grabbing his arm in pain. He's breathing heavy, facing the one and only Dean Winchester, who has the power to kill him in his hands. Cas, Jack and Sam all collectively stand up, moans and groans making their way out of their mouths from the damage Michael has just done to them. Dean's face is stern, focused.
"Well...sure. I always do. Me being me. Is that it or..." Chuck raised his hands, expecting more from the boys he claimed were his favorites.
"...resisting me. He was too attached to you," Michael makes an annoyed face motioning to Sam. He thinks for a second, remembering how Cas-filled Dean's mind was about all the love and feeling he has for him. He fixes his mistake. "...to all of you. He wouldn't stop squirming -" Michael rolls his shoulder back, as if remembering what all of Dean's clawing and prying felt like. "-to get out, to get back. So I left...," he reaches down to pick up a glass of alcohol he had been pouring himself earlier while waiting for TFW 2.0, or more specifically Dean, to arrive.
He knows now why Michael looks so confident. He can't find himself to kill the one person in the world he wants dead more than anything. And that's when he realizes, he can't feel his limbs. He can't control them. He's trying really hard to just lung forward and drive the spear into Michael's chest. The opportunity awaits itself like dangling a carrot in front of a bunny's face. If only he could feel his limbs.
"Oh, no, this is -- this is the first reaper to check out since Billie, right? So...wait for it. Wait for it. Ohhh... And... Meet the new Death," Lucifer held his hand out at Betty, who had gasped a breath and opened her eyes. She arose from the floor quickly. Dean walked around Sam to untie the scarf that kept her from talking. As a weird thank you, she looked into his eyes and then headbutted him. In a few swift movements, she yanked the chains off her body in a dramatic fashion.
"Goodbye, S-Sammy," Dean managed to get out just before the both of them took their last breaths and shut their eyes forever. A small smile was on both of their faces despite them both being in unimaginable pain. Because they were both at piece with their deaths. They died saving the world and would soon be rightfully reunited.
"Dean, do you think we're it? All that's left?" Dean went over to shut off the annoying noise that was the dripping of beer. He tiredly chuckled.
"Okay, the end of God is in the special book, and if you give Betty the book, Betty can read it. Understand?" Betty talked to Sam and Dean as if they were five year old's like Lucifer just had minutes before. But she got a hesitant nod out of the Winchesters.
brother.
"What if once we confront Chuck, we let him beat the shit out of us. That'll allow Jack to absorb Chuck's energy," Sam conspired.
Sam, Cas, and Jack laugh along with him similar to how they had right after Dean had killed Lucifer.
The first thing they saw was a roadhouse. But not just any roadhouse. Harvelle's Roadhouse. And none other than Bobby Singer himself was sitting on the porch. He was drinking a beer and just staring off into the sky. He turned his head and his eyes lit up. He jumped up from his chair and gave his boys the biggest hug. Sam and Dean melted into the hug, as they had missed Bobby so much. Having Apocalypseverse Bobby was nice, but it wasn't nearly the same.
Jack and Adam stood by and watched as the Winchesters set up the spell.
Meanwhile, Jack gasped, absorbing so much power through the death of Lucifer. His eyes turned into his iconic gold ones, and he just let the power sink in. Sam turned to give Dean a look of reassurance, seeing Jack absorbing that much power. In an instant Lucifer had disappeared into nothingness. Michael stood there breathless, the archangel blade still in his hand.
at him. It was sort of strange how Dean had never heard Cas's real laugh. He'd only ever heard a huff or a chuckle.
"We did it," Jack said to them, remembering what Dean had told Sam and himself after killing Lucifer. It was a team effort and they all worked collectively to get to this point.
you. Or, better yet, they'll end all of your little friends while I end you myself. Don't worry, I'm not impolite. I'll let Dean watch as I do it," he smiles, teeth very much viewable. Sam shivers, shifting in place.
"No, no, no," he whispers, really panicking now. "My grace it's not-" his voice cracks. "I'm too weak... I can't save him," fresh tears roll down his cheeks.
"Okay, be honest with me, please. Would you have let me in if I said it was really me?" He raised his hands up in innocence.
"Save it!" Chuck quickly raised his hand as his eyes glowed white, his rage taking over as he began killing his own son. Michael's own face turned white and he was frozen in place, waiting for it all to end. And in a dramatic fashion, Michael exploded into a big white light, sending a wave of power all around him.
Sam is fuming, smoke practically coming out of his ears. His teeth clench as they often do when he's feeling overly emotional.
"Daddy's boy," Dean quipped. Michael chuckled.
"Billie," he simply said, her name coming out like venom.
Jack's voice is raw, full of emotions. Sam walks up slowly and laid a gentle hand on Jack's shoulder. He flinches slightly at the touch, but turns around and gives Sam and appreciative smile.
"You're the most caring man on Earth. You are the most selfless, loving human being I will ever know," Cas honest to God
"And you two. You know, eternal suffering sounds good on paper, but as a viewing experience it's just kind of...eh. So we're done. I'm canceling your show."
"I don't know," Jack replied.
Dean continued to stare at the ground while his brother looked at him as if there were more to the story. As if Dean would say,
"And, thus, it will be --" Betty's reading came to a halt, as she had been turned to nothing but ash by the hands of Lucifer. Lucifer took the book for himself with the quick flick of his hand.
"Alright," Sam walked towards Chuck with all his fury gathering up inside him. "Well...one for the road," he said before landing a punch right across Chuck's face. However, Chuck hardly reacted besides a head tilt. In fact, it was Sam who's hand hurt the most on the impact.
"I'm so happy to see y'all. And you're looking much better without having to carry all that emotional baggage on your shoulder's," she looked at Dean saying that last part, referencing the time she visited him on earth for a brief period of time. The two looked at each other with care in their eyes. They never established what their relationship was, but it was certain that the two cared for each other very much.
"Trust me," Dean speaks and Michael's head whips up. "That's gonna leave a scar," Dean references his own scar from previously being Michael's vessel and being injured by the very same spear in almost the same spot on his arm. Michael barely cracks a smile. He stands up straight, all the confidence in the world. Dean's face turns confused, almost surprised.
"Father," Michael proudly addressed his dad.
"You sure about this, Jack? Whatever you're picking up on is in there?" Sam asked the kid for confirmation.
"Behold, in the end, there is the ending of he who created the beginning."
"Wait a second. You're sure about this?"
"That would make sense. So what? This is part of Billie's plan? For you to absorb power?" Dean questioned.
"Uh...yeah, not so much. Um, after pop nutted out and murdered pretty much everyone in the world, the Empty booted me with orders to find the missing God Book and use it on Chuck. Uh, normally, I'm not very good at following orders, as you guys know, but uh, you do not want to mess with the Empty, man. Total 'B,' especially after Jack blew up all over her, and she killed Death. I mean, guys, never a dull moment. But that's the past. What's up?!" He raised his hands in celebration with a big smile plastered on his face. "We're a team again, guys."
"Oh, this is Betty. Betty -- Betty, say hi." He taunted her with her inability to speak. She muffled something inaudible at him, most likely a swear of some sort. "No, no, no. Say hi to the boys," he smiled, chuckling. He turned back to Sam and Dean. "Just getting it straight. Oh, did I mention Betty is a reaper? I'm doing a fly-by, right? Okay." He chuckled at the boys confused faces. "I'll say that again. Betty is a reaper," he repeated, this time pronunciating the words longer.
"Cas," he begins, taking another long breath. "I l-love you too," he manages to get out, taking a gasping breath after doing so.
Michael's vessel falls to the ground - dead on the spot. Michael has killed her.
"You found a dog?"
They exchanged passionate glances with all of their former friends before laying their eyes on their family. Jack, who couldn't help himself, ran up to Sam and Dean and buried his head into their chests just as their mother had a moment ago. He pulled back after a few moments and looked at them with a certain fondness and relief. They did what Jack always knew they could do. They did what they were always meant to do, screw Heaven's bullshit plan for them.
"How did the three of you manage?" Michael finally asked the question they had been expecting.
Jack turned his back on the crowd and faced the pile of logs holding Sam and Dean's body. He took a deep breath before tossing the lighter on the logs. As always, the fire started pretty quickly. It was a weird feeling for Jack. He'd been to quite a few hunters funerals before, but he'd always be attending with Sam and Dean. He smiled, knowing they were in a better place. The place that he had helped build. The Heaven that Sam and Dean deserved. He decided he was going to go greet them up there now that his job as the funeral planner was finished. He turned and walked past the crowd that was surrounding Sam and Dean's bodies. And by the time the crowd turned around to see where he had gone, he had disappeared.
"Yeah." Michael's face is relaxed, so unnatural on Dean's face: as Dean's real face is almost never relaxed.
As Jack walks back to stand by Cas, Cas grabs his arm to get the discouraged boy to look at him. Jack, who's eyes were glued to the floor, moves them up to meet Cas' shiny blue eyes. Cas' eyes are sympathetic looking into Jack's hopeless ones.
"Something like people?" Sam questioned, very curious about what this could be. A cruel trick from God? What more did he want from them?
"Remember when I talked about paradise, Dean? Back when I tried to convince you to say 'yes' to Michael." Dean nodded, his expression curious as to what Cas was going to say. "This is it, Dean. This is paradise. You can finally feel peace. And know that you granted all of Earth's people freedom," Cas smiled at him, taking his hand. Dean nodded, happy tears in his eyes just the way Cas's eyes had looked right before he died.
"And?"
"It is, Sam. I think everyone's gone." Sam looked at his big brother in disbelief but deep down knew he was right. He turned again to take a look at the empty road before taking a few steps back and fishing his phone out of his coat pocket. He quickly called Jody's phone, which immediately went to voicemail. He hung up the phone, a look of frustration on his face. He searched his contacts and spotted Garth's name. Like Jody's phone, Garth's immediately went to voicemail.
"I'm sorry," he muttered, but his apology did seem sincere. The boys sighed heavily as yet another plan went down the drain.
"Well, we don't have anything that could actually physically help us, but we could always try talking to him to try an get Dean in control. Sure, it won't really fix our problem, but all we need is Dean to be temporarily in control so we can get him back to the bunker and figure everything out from there," Sam tells them. Cas and Jack nod.
"Kill him!" Jack yells, frustrated and just wanting Michael to be dead. He's been waiting for this opportunity for a long time. He was of course the first person to call Cas out on his wanting (needing) to save Dean over killing Michael.
Cas' face is what's more devastating, mouth agape with shock at the sight. He has never been so surprised at an unexpected turn of events. But this one is just so shocking that he can't help but simply stare with fear. There's no telling what the future can hold from here.
Not an inch of regret was on Chuck's face. It was more like relief and frustration. He turned to address the Winchesters, who were standing up to face him.
"Oh, but I doubt I'm going to be able to get close enough to defeat Chuck anyways. That'd be nearly impossible. Even with me absorbing his energy, he'll still be powerful," Jack explained.
Standing in the War Room, Dean, Michael, and Jack searched through the lore while Michael waited impatiently for Sam. But what Michael didn't know was that they had a plan.
"We're surrendering. We're giving up," Sam said, the words coming off his lips like a sigh. This was the last thing he and Dean wanted to do. The thing people had been telling them they would eventually do their whole lives. Kill each other. But they were going to do whatever they could to bring back the world. As Dean had once told Cas,
"Yes, we do," Cas snaps back, no longer fear in his eyes - only determination.
Jack read the text Dean had just sent him on his phone,
"Wassup?" Standing there, leaning against the doorframe was none other than Lucifer himself in his iconic vessel Nick. Dean instantly shut the door in a panic. "Wow! Way to treat a pal," Lucifer whined, hands in the air. Sam quickly turned to see the man he probably hated most in this world. The man who had been killed just around two years before.
"Well, well, well," is all Michael says as Cas steps toward him. Cas doesn't react, just sighs, preparing his long awaited speech. Something he knows will really drive a reaction out of Dean. He's done it before when he was dying, but this time it'll be different. He'll just be talking to Dean. Confessing his true feelings.
"I never spent much time on Earth. I was...curious about the perception of God and Heaven."
Jack clears his voice before beginning. "Hey, uh, Dean. It's Jack," Michael scoffs at Jack's mumbled introduction. Jack clears his throat to try again. "I just want to tell you that... you're my biggest influence. I know you don't think of yourself as a hero, but I do. And I want to be just like you. I want to be a hero - to save people, to save the world. I want to impress you - to make you proud," he lets out a shaky breath, feeling some relief roll off his shoulders. "You've become like a father to me. You, Cas, and Sam. And the only thing stopping us from being a family is... well our Michael problem. So all you have to do is just fight. And then we can help you fix this.
"How does this work?"
"Okay," Sam shifts uncomfortably in the close distance between himself and Michael. "Dean," he finally peels his eyes off the floor and lifts them to Michael's. Michael's smile is bone-chilling. "I would talk about all our history together, how we've saved so, so many people and even saved the world. Multiple times. But I'm afraid we don't have much time. So, Dean," his eyes begin to water. "-let's focus on the future. What we're going to accomplish once you're free of Michael. Really picture it, Dean. L-like Jack said - we can be a family. Hunting monsters and drinking beer, your two specialties," Sam lets out a small chuckle.
"What can we do now?" Jack turns and whispers to Sam and Cas. The two look at each other and take a second to think.
"I'm sure he's aware I took your side against him, I've avoided using any powers that might attract his attention," Michael explained as he approached the group.
"I guess," Jack shrugged his shoulders.
"Alright, Chuck. You win," Dean gave him the words he knew Chuck wanted to hear.
"Dean?" Sam calls out to his brother, but Dean is far gone. The three of them are confused as to why Dean hasn't struck and killed Michael yet. This is all they've wanted since Michael left Dean.
"What?"
"Dean. Come on, Dean. Are you in there?" Sam's voice is desperate, looking deep into his brother's eyes. But he doesn't look deep enough, because he can only see numbness.
"We reached out to you. You ignored us," Dean spoke with frustration.
"Oh, good. I get to listen to you three give long, sappy speeches for who knows how long," Michael quips, rolling his eyes in annoyance. "You know once I get out of here, which could be any time now, all I'll have to do is snap my fingers and my monsters will
Cas straight up
"What if...what if the reason you're able to sense a presence is because you gained the plants power by killing them?" Sam threw the theory out there. Dean and Jack thought about the idea for a second.
Before running up to each other, they just looked at one another with the utmost of adoration. Both started running up to each other and wrapping their arms around each other desperately. They pulled each other close never wanting to let go. They remain in one another's arms for a long period of time before Dean began to pull away, wanting to see and talk with Cas again. He contemplated his decision about pulling away and before he knew it he was just inches from Cas's face. Cas was looking at him with his big, beautiful eyes. Although this look was not the usual one of concern. But it was of love.
"Well, actually I was the one who lunged into your blade. You did me a favor by killing me so here I am just returning the favor," she smiled back at him.
"To break him, to crush and disappoint him so completely that, this time, he'll be nice and quiet for a change -" The group gives him a confused face. "- buried. And he is. He's gone." He grins at their shattered faces. Just the reaction he had been hoping for. He gulps down the rest of his alcohol and takes a satisfactory look at the glass once he's done.
"So...you survived," said a voice that belonged to none other than Sam and Dean's half-brother, Adam. Well, his vessel anyway. They could tell by the way he was talking that it was in fact the infamous archangel, Michael.
Jack tried to remain cool, calm, and collected as he rose from his seat at the table in the library.
Attending the funeral was the Wayward Sisters, Eileen, Rowena, their Apocalypseverse friends, Garth and his family, Ed and Harry, Mrs. Tran, Adam, Amelia, Cole, Donatello, Sister Jo, Alicia and Max, and every hunter and friend that they came to know throughout their lives. Oh, and of course Miracle.
"Are we seriously thinking about trusting him?" Michael kept his finger pointed at the guy he once cast down to Hell.
"You okay?" Sam asked his brother.
"Well this...this is great! All you need to do is absorb as much power as possible and then maybe you'll be able to overpower Chuck! We need to get you all the goddamn plants in the world!" Dean exclaimed, already getting ahead of himself.
"Hey, everyone," Jack held up a microphone to his mouth and grabbed everyone's attention as he stood in front of Sam and Dean's bodies with a lighter. "I'm Jack. And today we're here to celebrate the lives of Sam and Dean Winchester. They've saved the world on more than one occasion. They died saving the world. So let's remember them as the most badass, courageous, lovable, self-sacrificing, loyal, strong, determined, and brave human beings to ever walk this earth," Jack held up the lighter in comparison to the beers everyone else was holding. "To Sam and Dean."
Instead, he watches quietly as Cas reaches for his cellphone, sets a timer and starts drawing. As if this is a regular weekday activity. Like a game of Scrabble. Just your regular old getting naked with your best friend. Friends with drawing benefits.
“Take us to him,” he pleads.
Cas breathed out shakily. Killing Kansas was a mistake.
“Never!” Dean says.
Though he
Cas is just so warm. He pushes deeper in. Cas whimpers and pushes back.
Now Dean’s gonna have to explain about dumb sexuality quizzes, and why even straight people take them.
Dean holds out a tentative palm. “I’m… new in town. Name’s Iggy.”
Dean wonders if Cas is one of the results.
Cas locks his hand into Dean’s upturned palm, and allows his grace to flow through until it’s healed.
No. Not to live here.
“Gave him a whole speech about how disgusted Cas made him feel. You see, Dean loves cars and chicks. As I intended, some people say.”
Jimmy
Every time, Dean follows “Jimmy’s” movements with silent eyes. He nods. Cas nods back.
He takes one of Dean’s fingers inside his mouth and swirls his tongue, sucking.
“I mean about the case, jerk. Just. Walk me through everything — but spare me any uh, artistic muse visuals, ok?”
“Any weird smells?”
“Oh, shit,” he says, dropping the knife at once. It clatters on the barn floor.
“Killing vamps with Sam.”
Dean swallows, pencil hovering over an empty canvas. The triangle of Cas’ chest somehow makes him look insanely masculine, yet fragile.
Cas slightly opens his mouth, now holding onto Dean’s elbows more strongly. He presses into Dean as if he wants to forever leave a mark.
Shhh. The angel is sleeping.
Dean’s eye diverts to a cubist style vagina. He quickly looks the pastor in the eye, again. No application for sainthood. Just — professionalism.
A brief flash of emotion crosses Cas’s face, but he controls himself quickly, like he’s impersonating a marble angel statue. “Who are you?”
“I am, Dean. Up for it.”
When that thought hits, well if Dean thought he was close before — finish line is surely in sight now.
“I wish I-”
It was Kansas, suddenly remembering their death’s purpose.
In fact, now that he’s here…
“Leave us alone, Chuck!” Jack says, angrily.
, is scribbled on the first page. This must be his personal copy.
Dean’s body feels like a glass slowly being filled to the brim with piping hot chocolate. Breathe, he reminds himself, but he’s afraid it’ll steam right out of his nose.
Still, better than breaking news.
“Dean, you’re acting really weird.” Sam’s voice rises in anger.
Shit, there must be full on confusion written all over Dean’s face. His lip twitches as he tries to rearrange his expression. Just once - get through this take.
“It’s okay, Cas. You did good.”
Guess Cas is angry, then. So what? What about it? Why should Dean care? They’re just friends, and this is a minor disagreement. Shit, is Kevin reading his mind right now? Dean tries to think about sheep in a meadow. The animals are eating glass, uh, grass. Nothing interesting to see. He thinks about Sam. About flowers. About the damn bees Cas likes so much. No, no, no reminders of Cas. Okay, he thinks about the bunker. Actually, you know what’s bonkers? A fic can’t ever be the Word of God. That’s insane! Especially that fellshish fic, filled with weird thoughts about homosexuality.
“He was Cas’s vessel,” Dean says.
All these years, I’ve been trying to be the hero people needed me to be.
Cas quickly retreats, pulling back his arms. The angel’s expression is shadowed. Dean blinks, letting his eyes adjust to this side of the room again. The streetlamp’s light somehow finds a way around Cas’s sharp cheekbones like it’s carving them, like it’s excavating a cherished relic from an archeological site.
,” Kansas sang in the distance. “
After what feels like forever, Cas walks out, trenchcoat and all. He must’ve bought a new one.
Oh no. That voice.
“You’re doing okay, right? In Rexford?”
“No,” Dean says, cum staining the inside of his pants. “I barely glanced at it.
“If it must be done, I guess I’ll make this sacrifice. It can’t be worse than the mark of Cain,” Dean jokes, but a small flash of sadness in Cas’ eyes quickly shuts him up.
CONTINUED (2)
This does nothing for Dean, of course. Totally not about to shoot off like an amateur.
And it does make a lot of sense. Cas after all has always claimed his bond with Dean was more profound. And Dean hasn’t properly dated in years. He’s always been devastated whenever they lost Cas.
And dammit if the asshole doesn’t wink right at Dean.
“Dean?”
That’s how Cas and seven very confused rockers ended up quietly sitting on the roadhouse floor while Bobby drank beers with an unsuspecting Dean in front of it.
Dean doesn’t look at the angel, not even one second, only at their hands. Then, heavily: “Thank you, Cas.”
The space itself is pretty depressing. Everything is shaded in every version of the color brown imaginable, including the carpet. There’s stacks of drab plastic chairs against one of the walls. Some of them have been removed to form a half circle before a small raised platform with a single chair on it.
Then, Cas rubs his thumb in his own cum and smears it around Dean’s hole, getting it all over the edges. He dips his thumb inside just a bit, and Dean just… blacks out.
John’s face slowly drops, his laugh lines smoothing out.
“Drama queens,” Eileen smiles.
“Wait… wait a minute.” The drummer dropped his sticks. He looked pale as a ghost. “I’ve seen The Good Place. Is this hell?”
That’s about the only demand he feels entitled to make of Cas right now.
“A…. sign?
Dean blinks.
Oh no. Those bible freaks were right. God is a homophobe.
“What?” Cas’s stomach dropped to the ground.
“Cas,” Dean says quietly. “Oh no. Cas.”
Yes. Exactly how he remembers that
Slowly, air refills his lungs, and Dean decides that it’s kind of cool that the rhythm of an angel’s breaths helped him remember how to be human again.
Dean’s ears burn.
Dean, however, doesn’t let go. He breathes heavily, fists still holding on tight to the fabric, swallowing and swallowing words.
“Jack! I’m almost finished. I’m waiting for the Harvelles, they’re the only ones with an alcohol permit around here.”
Cas still seems out of it. “M tired,” he mumbles, then freezes as he stares at Dean’s shoulder and its proximity to his cheek in horror. “Oh. Sorry.”
you,” Cas exhales. “It’s not the Empty.”
Quite the unconventional choir room this is. Is this what those singing choir boys are looking at? Dean smirks.
Maybe he needs a bit of cheering up? Dean puts a hand on his shoulder. Oops. Bad idea. Very naked. He retreats the hand quickly, his fingers feeling hot somehow.
“No, I just need you. I need you. I’m sorry. I thought - honestly, I thought an angel could never care about me that way. Especially one that -“
Dean exhales in relief.
“Dean”, Chuck smiles. “Fancy meeting you here.”
Cas keeps his eyes fixed on him, and says, so fucking simply: “You are beautiful, Dean.”
And Cas... Shit. Cas looks like he’s at his breaking point.
Fuck.
Dean drinks up the way Cas has his hands folded half underneath his head so they’re touching Dean’s lap just a little.
“Take your time,” Dean jokes half-heartedly, mind still racing.
Those eyes are quite firmly focused on him, actually.
Dean lowers his lips to Cas’ back and presses them between his shoulder blades. Then he trails kisses down Cas’ spine, until he reaches his underwear. Face suddenly heating, he carefully loops a finger around the waistband and gently tugs down Cas’ briefs. And then, holy shit, the angel’s fully naked underneath him, waiting.
He calms himself down. Then, he pushes slowly forward, listening carefully for any sounds from Cas. Cas stays quiet, except for occasional hitched little breaths. Dean pulls back a bit, then with one final push he’s fully sheathed. Inside Cas.
He glares in the general direction of the aquarium. Yeah, so what, 43
"And now... I have a whole army out there," his arms stretch out wide. "-waiting, ready for my command," Cas' eyes scan the ground, desperately thinking of someway they can get out of this one. As if on cue Sam nudges his foot. Cas subtly looks down to see some holy oil and a lighter that was kicked out of their backpack by Sam. Cas nudges Jack and gives him the hand signal they worked on for 'attack.' "-ready... for this," Michael hold's up his hand, fingers in perfect position and ready to be snapped.
"I know. I know how you see yourself, Dean. You see yourself the same way our enemies see you. You're destructive and you're angry and you're broken. You're- You're 'Daddy's Blunt Instrument.' And you think hate and anger, that's- that's what drives you. That's who you are. It's not," he sees Michael's face shift.
. He shook his head in denial. His father could not be dead.
"...but not without leaving the door open... just a crack," he smiles, pointing at Sam mockingly. The tension-filled silence in the room is too much to handle, so Cas starts talking once more.
"How are you sensing anything? I thought you were all powered down," Dean asked, already kind of knowing the answer.
"Hey," Dean caught Sam's attention and pointed at the television. It was of a Bears-Vikings game, but no one was on the field. A strange sight indeed. Sam looked up at it in bewilderment. "It brings a whole new meaning to the term 'sudden death.'" Dean tried to lighten the mood with one of his quippy lines. It didn't work.
The tension was thick in the air. Both brothers were processing how long they had left to live. How their lives were up to this point. Had they saved enough people? Did their cons outweigh their pros? All these questions and hardly any time left to answer. Because in a few hours, Sam and Dean Winchester would be no more.
"That's one of Death's books," Michael observed.
face is frozen, but eyes are wide.
"Yes, we heard you. So what?"
"Wherever you want it to go." Dean chuckled, typical cryptic Cas.
"You're my big brother," Sam began, getting serious again. "-and you are the strongest person I know. There's nothing you can't do. There's no doubt in my mind you're able to fight Michael off. All you have to do is fight. Fight like you've been doing your whole life. I
Dean's eyes once again land on Cas'. He just tilts his head with sympathy and sadness at Cas' utterly broken face, tears still streaming down his chiseled face and mouth agape. Dean’s really struggling to breath now, his breaths coming faster and harsher. He looks at the three of them knowing these are his final seconds. He manages a smile, knowing they’re all going to eventually be okay.
"Alright, well, that's a good thing, 'cause the man had no love to give -- not to you, not to me, not to...humanity. You see that now, right?" Michael simply stared at his brother with pure anger. Abruptly, Betty appeared in front of the group, clearing her throat.
"Yeah, this is what Pop wanted to get his hands on. Hmm. Did I say that out loud? Yeah, Pop was the one who let me out of the Empty. I'm sort of the new favorite now. What did Dad say about you? Oh, yeah. 'Mikey's a cuck.'" Michael's eyes flashed, warning his brother to stop talking. The rest of the room was just as angry, but mostly at themselves. How could they have trusted and gotten betrayed by Lucifer yet again?! "You're a cuck," Lucifer laughed whole-heartedly. He swiftly sent Sam and Dean flying backwards into the bookshelves after their attempt at attacking him. "D'oh!" Lucifer mocked his brother's attempts at taking him out. "Wow, you are really getting rusty at this, buddy. Bye," Lucifer easily sent his brother flying backwards. "So...buddy...you're gonna have to make a decision now," he finally addressed his son. "Uh, dump the losers and join Gramps and me on the winning team. Of course, this is the only way you're getting out of here alive, 'cause you're not strong enough to fight me now, so... What do you say, kid? What do you say? Come on," he encouraged his son with a smirk. "Somebody's behind me?" Lucifer asked no one in particular, seeing Jack's face, who was looking at the figure behind his father. Lucifer slowly turned around to face his brother. He flashed his red eyes of evil. "You don't learn." All of a sudden, the archangel blade was in Lucifer's abdomen. Lucifer groaned painfully before tilting his head up and letting the white lights take over. He screamed the same way he did the first time, except this time it was maybe more painful, as it was at the hands of his
"Relax. I'm not giving him shotgun." He paused. "Unless you're cool with that." Sam playfully rolled his eyes.
"What...what happens now," Chuck sat up and asked his former grandson. "You gonna kill me? Go ahead. Do it!" Chuck practically begged, not liking being human. Jack just stared at him.
"Watch," he stabbed Betty in her chest, the wound and her eyes glowing white as it did for every supernatural being that died. She fell the the floor painfully, the chains around her chest and waist rattling noisily.
"Fascinating," Lucifer quipped.
Jack had waited outside, still needing time to truly process Cas's death. He was leaned up against a cement cylinder with flowers sticking out of it. Jack looked up to the sky, desperately hoping someone was listening.
"Yeah. I guess Chuck didn't get everything," Dean said in a smile. "I mean, maybe there's people he missed, you know? Look, either way, this guy's coming home with us."
"Yeah, but this one is about God." Michael looked up surprisingly at Dean. "And how to kill him."
"Wow, we have lot's of catching up to do," Sam chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck.
"No," Dean stated flatly, still looking around the discarded town.
"Y-your efforts?" Sam questioned in confusion.
"We'll take you back to the bunker, get you in some, uh, angel cuffs? And then, uh, we'll figure it out from there," Sam says, clearly unsure of his own plan. Dean wears the disappointed face Sam expected him to. His eyebrows furrow in confusion.
Sam and Dean nodded, still breathless from Lucifer slamming them into the bookshelves.
"That's the plan? Angel cuffs? This is
There was a bit of a pause after what Sam had said. Like Chuck was thinking about whether or not he accepted Sam and Dean's surrender.
"No," Sam whispers, not wanting to face what's right in front of him. What the both of them have always avoided. Letting a supernatural creature of any sort into their bodies.
He sees Michael struggling to remain in control, but that only lasts a couple seconds. He turns back to Cas and Jack, who, for the first time since Michael gained control, have hope in their eyes. Sam steps toward them at the same time as Cas steps forward. They meet in the middle to exchange a word.
He let's out a long, shuddering breath, building enough oxygen to have the words to say to Cas.
The three turned around to make sure it was really him.
"Yeah, kid. We did," Dean smiled, placing his hand on Jack's shoulder. It still amazed Dean how his opinion of Jack changed so quickly. How at first all he wanted to do was kill Jack without even giving him a chance. But Jack was lucky to have gotten his mother's genes because his heart was 100% pure. And Dean loved him for it.
"Gone," Michael stated, anger in his voice. "I'm sorry to say. Exterminated by my father, like everyone else."
"Guys, come on. That's enough!" Chuck yelled frustratingly as the Winchester's helped each other up after minutes of endless beating. Chuck went to roll his eyes at the boys and that's when they attacked. Before Chuck knew it he was on the ground, as Sam and Dean had tackled him. They sat him up and kneeled beside him. Dean took Chuck's left arm in his right arm and Sam took Chuck's right arm in his left. They let their blood that dripped from their faces fall into their free palms before beginning the chant.
"It ain't just Heaven, boys," Bobby continued. "It's the Heaven you two
"He's upset that Chuck brought back Lucifer and made him the favorite. Michael’s going to want to be the favorite again. But anyways, the plan is for Sam to tell us there is a spell to defeat Chuck. Then, once we get there, hopefully you'll have enough mojo to gut both their asses. Whaddya say, kid?" Jack processed the plan for a moment. There were some flaws, but this was a risk he was willing to take. To save the world. To make up for all the pain he's caused Sam and Dean.
"Alright, Michael. Here's the book we've been telling you about," Sam slammed the book onto the war room table.
"Yes, I noticed it around the same time you guys did," Jack admitted. "But I don't know why. Or how," Jack furrowed his eyebrows, trying to think of any possible solution. Sam and Dean did the same.
None of the three men dare speak, as they've learned it's best to let Dean let out his emotions without interruption. Dean's eyes dart across the floor, minding moving a million miles an hour. That's when his eyes catch the spear in his right hand. His breath hitches, remembering the dark memories attached to it. How it was the cause of the still burning scar on his upper arm. But then his eyes go wide, realizing this is the perfect opportunity. The spear, it will kill Michael. If he doesn't do this, who knows how many people will be killed once Michael regains control or gets out. He looks up and realizes he's been caught staring at the spear. All of their eyes are wide with fear.
Dean slowly approached Jack with a look of sympathy on his face. Cas had meant the world to Jack. And Jack was hurting real bad over this loss.
"Sorry. It's slow going. But I think I was able to piece it together," Sam gave them a small smile.
we're talking about! A freakin' archangel! How long do you think those will hold him? A day? A few hours?" Dean is furious.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Look at you. Hey!" Dean reached down to let the dog sniff his hand. Seemed friendly enough for Dean. "Wow," he laughed. "How did Chuck miss you?" He asked, scratching the dog's ears. "Whoever thought finding a dog would feel like a miracle? Come on, Miracle. Come here," he called for the dog that he decided he would name Miracle. He picked the dog up and headed back to Sam to tell him the good news.
"Jack, have you noticed that you've been, uh, draining the life out of plants lately? Because Sam and I watched as those plants a few days ago died as you walked by them. Do you have any idea what that's about?" Jack's eyes grew wide at the realization he had been caught. He deemed his plant-killing ability to be a bad thing, which was why he had been keeping it from Sam and Dean in the first place.
"Cute. You know, when I decided that I was going to kill you guys I knew snapping my fingers wasn't going to be how I did it. Too anticlimactic. No, you two deserve much worse than a finger snap. That's why I'm going to tear you both apart with my own two hands," he smiled, looking the brothers right in the eyes before attacking them. He punched Sam first, seeing as Sam was already right in front of him. He then went to Dean, also punching him in the face, then adding a head-butt. This would go on back and fourth for awhile. All while Jack stood off to the side, absorbing all the power Chuck was unknowingly sending his way.
beat Michael, but not Chuck. The boys sighed.
"I never got to say goodbye," Dean whispered, dropping his head slightly. Now Cas put on his face of concern for this unexpected and sudden emotion from Dean. "I never got to say I love you back," he whispered again, somehow softer and quieter than the first time.
Michael hops to his feet, a very frustrated look on his face. But that look doesn't last too long, as he doesn't want to let Sam, Cas and Jack have the satisfaction. He begins to laugh.
"Yeah, no," Chuck said to Sam and Dean's surprise and confusion. "I mean, I appreciate the white flag, but frankly, it's too little, too late. I'm kind of enjoying this story now," Chuck smiled at the anger he was causing the boys. It had taken the world being wiped away to get them to surrender and Chuck wouldn't even allow them to fix their mistakes by giving him what they thought he wanted.
"Uh, what?"
'Dean' takes slow walks towards the glass window, the spear still in his hand.
"Sammy," he called. Sam lifted his head up from pumping gas, his face shocked. "Check it out."
"Dean, don't!"
"Cas?" He asked, his voice breaking saying his name out loud. Tears filled his eyes as he already knew he wouldn't be getting a response. He slowly dropped his head down to think about his father. After taking a few moments to think, he straightened himself up and started heading towards the entrance of the restaurant, those tears in his eyes dropping down his face. He felt a sudden sense of weird power while walking, but he brushed it off.
"You guys ready?" Tessa asked them. Sam and Dean looked at each other with a smile and then turned to Tessa and took her hands. They smiled, finally at peace as she lead them into Heaven.
"T-take care of," he gasps, it's more painful this time. "-of yourself, S-Sammy," he sobs, which hurts his chest a lot. He's in agonizing pain at this point. But Dean being Dean doesn't dwell on it.
Michael smirks, and now Dean knows something is really wrong. His vision goes too blurry for his liking. Flashbacks of all the things Michael did in his body are shown in his mind as if he were at a drive-in movie. It horrifies him.
"And Adam?" Sam asked with curiousness, but he unfortunately already knew the answer. Michael looked down, remembering the boy he had grown a liking to.
"As far as we know, only Death can open it. But, um...we're hoping, uh...maybe you can, too." Michael turned to look at the desperate family in need of his assistance. He looked down at the book once more before attempting to open it. He stuck a shaky hand and raised it a few inches above the book. The books delicate handiwork glowed white and just as the boys gained hope, Michael ran out of power, gasping for breath and lowering his still shaky hand.
He walked into the kitchen to see Sam and Dean already talking, their faces tired, but focused.
"Dean?" Cas tries, although his voice is uncertain and he knows something is really wrong. Sam tilts his head to the right, waiting for something, but he doesn't know what. Jack remains still as a board, terrified of what is going on in front of him.
"We can what? There's nothing left, Dean," Sam interrupted his brother, angry and frustrated, but not at Dean. "No one left to save. Everybody's gone!"
"How's, uh, Sam doing? Any progress?" Michael asked Dean, pacing around the room with a book in his hand.
"How can you tell?"
Sam and Dean stared out the window of the restaurant in confusion. They were both concerned and curious seeing Jack kill those plants by just walking near them, but that was a topic of conversation for a later time.
"Oh, am I excited to hear this," Michael's sarcasm is picking up speed, and Sam can tell he's getting annoyed with this. That could mean a lot of things, but Sam won't get his hopes up. Not yet.
Each individual or group that had attended the brothers' funeral had a unique relationship with them. Whether it went from enemies to friends like Cole, or friends to lover like Eileen, all of the people in attendance were there to honor the Winchester brothers' legacy.
Cas' eyes are extremely wide, his hand finds Dean's and he squeezes it hard. He lets out a soft sob at Dean's confession. He's known this man for so long, knows how that must've been hard for him. He feels his heart strings tug at Dean squeezing his hand back. He leans forward slowly and looks into Dean's eyes. He sees the way they light up slightly. He sees that as his cue and he leans in forward enough so that their foreheads touch. They remain in that position for a couple seconds, gathering a couple good breaths. That's when Cas moves his chin forward enough and his lips meet Dean's. Dean's lips are bloody and chapped, and the kiss is desperate, but it's passionate and full of love. Cas pulls away after a couple seconds and let's out a chuckle, his eyes still locked on Dean's. He sees the life fading from them. They move over toward Jack.
"Alright, well first let's follow whatever sense Jack is feeling," Sam clapped his hands and a small smile started to form on his face. Maybe, just maybe, this whole power-sucking thing was going to work.
you can do it," Sam finishes his speech, sighing and turning away so that he won't have to listen to Michael's witty comments. But when he sees Cas and Jack's eyes, he turns around in an instant.
"Apparently, your old man has a sense of humor. He thought it would be hilarious to watch the three of us on an empty planet," Dean explained. Michael dryly chuckled.
"To Sam and Dean!"
Before Sam and Dean could even attempt anything, Chuck sent them flying backwards towards the water. He did the same with Jack just a moment after that, leaving him to face his son.
Jack could feel almost all of Chuck's powers were drained, so he tilted his head up and let the final bits of the power sink into his body. The three of them cried out all at once, and then they all fell backwards from the intensity of the situation. Only, two of them weren't getting up. Chuck remained on the ground for a few moments to steady his breathing. Jack sat up immediately and looked at Sam and Dean, who were laid on their sides, facing each other. More tears streamed down his face as he heard the heartfelt goodbye of Sam and Dean.
"Bathroom," he gave Michael a small smile before walking away. He smiled wider once he was out of Michael's sight, glad he didn't screw that up.
What Jack didn't know was that Sam and Dean were attending their own funeral.
"No, you're not our 'pal.'" Sam fumed, trying to keep his shock in check so Lucifer wouldn't see him as weak. He clenched his jaw and fists, preparing for whatever Lucifer was going to throw at them.
"I'm not sure," Jack answered honestly. Sam and Dean traded looks, remembering what they had seen with Jack and the plants from earlier at the restaurant. "But I feel it," Jack added.
is what Michael was doing in his body? Making an army?
"In there or very nearby," he said hesitantly, but that was enough for the brothers to head in. "Guys, I have no idea what we're walking into," Jack admitted as they walked into the church. The scary atmosphere was almost out of a movie. Thunderstorms came crashing down as the rain drops were also loud and annoying. The church was abandoned, but there was something odd that made it seem like someone had been there recently. Candles were lit around them.
"Who's she?"
"Peace at last," Dean took another look around Heaven to make sure he wasn't dreaming. "Where do we go from here?" Cas tilted his head and slightly smirked.
"Everyone's gone," Sam finally spoke the hardcore truth. "You see anybody on the way here?" Sam asked, his tone desperate.
"Yeah, we do. But I think y'all should greet some of your other friends before we do that, they're dying to see y'all," Ellen told them with an encouraging smile. The boys nodded their heads with appreciation before turning to start heading to see their other family and friends. But they didn't have to walk very far, as all of them appeared just a few feet in front of them. They turned back to Ellen in confusion. "Word traveled fast I guess," she chuckled, shrugging her shoulders.
But no. Cas was really gone. Sam eventually turned his to look at Jack, a devastated look on his face. He quickly turned back to Dean, needing to break the silence.
"Yeah. You, me, Jack," Dean said, still in disbelief.
None other than Mary Winchester stood before her boys, her eyes filled with tears and a smile on her face. She ran up and grabbed her sons, sobbing into their chests. The brothers engulfed their mom into a long overdue hug with their mother. The hug felt of warmth and love, just how it had been just a couple years before.
"There's one thing that could work to make sure he’s held in place before I can get there. It's this spell I read in the lore once designed to transfer energy. And the only ingredient is the participants blood," Jack grew quiet for a moment. "Well, your blood and your lives," he looked up at Sam and Dean, who were surprised at this. But Sam and Dean being Sam and Dean looked at each other for a few moments and nodded.
"Why wait?" Oh, Michael has been waiting for this question. He smirks before delivering his long-awaited answer.
"What?" Dean mumbled, staring down at his phone in confusion. "Cas?" He answered the phone, praying to God -- Chuck -- that Cas would be on the other end.
A playful smirk on his lips, Michael lifts his head up slowly. "Dean's not home right now. Please leave a message." Sam's not the least bit bothered by it, as he had expected it. But it was worth a shot.
Instead of offering a vocal response, Cas put his delicate fingers on the bottom of Dean's chin to tilt his head up. It worked and Dean was soon staring into Cas's eyes. Cas's fingers make their way up to his right cheek, his ring and pinky finger resting under Dean's ear and the rest of them caressing the hair above Dean's ear. His warm palm is comforting on Dean's cheek. Dean leans into the touch until they're so close their foreheads touch. They manage to catch each other's eyes, looking into them for a look of approval. It's Cas who leans in first and Dean follows just a second after. Slowly, they lean in until their lips meet at last. All the years of angst, tension, awkwardness, adoration, and a whole bunch of memories came together in the kiss of a lifetime. The kiss itself was slow and passionate. Cas hadn't a lot of practice kissing, so it was Dean who led the way with the kiss, his top lip caressing Cas's bottom. After a few seconds they both leaned back and smiled. Their smiles weren't over the top, but they were filled with relief. They took a moment to catch their breath before speaking again.
These familiar faces included Pamela, Gabriel, Meg, Crowley, Kevin, Charlie, Ketch, Mick, Jessica, Agent Henriksen, Rufus, Aretha, Anna, Becky, Balthazar, Mr. Devereaux, Benny, Hannah, Lily, Metatron, and, of course, Jack and Cas. They all stood before the boys with smiles and appreciation for saving Earth and sacrificing their lives to do so.
"We'll give you what you want."
"Let's light it up," Dean told Sam after they had finished setting it up. Sam tossed the match into one of the three bowls they had set up, resulting in blue flames to burst into the sky. This lasted a few seconds before the flames stopped and the bowls were tossed a few feet back by the force. Just as they had planned. And just as they thought the spell didn't work, Chuck appeared before them. His face looked bored and smug.
"Amazingly, the believers loved him. They have for thousands of years. I guess my efforts were more effective than I'd hoped."
"Uh, Jack, you wanna go first?" Sam gulps, trying to keep his voice steady. Jack hesitantly nods. He steps just a bit closer to Michael, showing hardly any fear. Michael looks him up and down, clearly not intimidated by him.
"Uh, I wouldn't exactly say 'trust.'" Dean told him with a scoff.
The funeral was just how they would've wanted it. It was in an open space in Sioux Falls. The bundle of logs with Sam and Dean's bodies was in the middle of it all. There were a couple of carts filled with beer, a choir, a food truck serving both salad bowls and cheeseburgers, and of course lot's and lot's of people. Some had tears streaming down their faces, others were hid their emotions better. But they were all there to celebrate the lives of Sam and Dean Winchester.
Dean's laughter dies out quickly and he stands up, feeling powerful. He stretches out his limbs, as they feel weird to him after not being in control for a little while. He looks back at the three men standing in front of him, fond smiles on their faces.
The group of four hopped out of Baby, carrying the ingredients needed for the spell. But what Michael didn't know was that this spell was not the one Sam had explained to him earlier. It was simply meant to set off a powerful force into the sky to get Chuck's attention if they were wrong and Michael hadn't actually warned Chuck about all of this.
Jack couldn't help but feel helpless. He knew this was part of the plan, but seeing his father figures get beaten up by his grandfather was not fun to watch. But he just needed to wait until Sam and Dean seemed weak enough so that Chuck would underestimate them and wouldn't see their tackle coming.
Jack, being his caring self, couldn't help but think. He mostly thought about losing Cas. He also thought about what he was going to do now that it was just himself, Sam and Dean. He couldn't hunt, so what was there really to do?
"Wow. Really?! Great," Dean exclaimed, very much confused and frustrated at Lucifer's confusion to kill the reaper.
"Of course I'm sure. I'm Death," she spoke with an obvious tone.
"Welcome to Heaven, my sons," she backed away from them and squeezed their arms, admiration seen on her face. They just smiled at her, so grateful to have seen their mother again. She steps aside to let the boys see everyone who had come to see them once again.
Sam, Cas, and Jack can only watch in horror as the last of Michael's grace is destroyed, leaving only Dean bleeding out from his chest. Sam quickly grabs his backpack from the ground and uses it to put out the flames still surrounding Dean. As soon as Sam clears a path with no flames, the three men rush to Dean's side.
"It wasn't Billie. It was Chuck." Sam tilted his head in confusion.
"You're dead."
After walking down the road for a little while, they decided to head inside a restaurant, which greeted Sam and Dean with country music and the sweet smell of beer the second they stepped foot in the door. They turned to their right to see deserted tables loaded with beer and food. The sound of beer dripping was in the background of the cheery music.
"I'm sensing a presence. There's something out there...besides us."
"That's right. The whole Cain-and-Abel thing. Us dead. Whatever. I'll kill Sam. Sam will kill me. We'll kill each other. Okay? You pick. But, first, you got to put everything back the way it was. The people, the birds, Cas!" Dean's voice changed speaking Cas's name just to emphasize it. "You got to bring him back." Chuck just gave Dean a bored look as this is what he expected.
"G-goodbye. I-I l-love you a-all," his words are muffled and difficult to understand, but they all do anyways.
Sam's head is immediately pressed against Dean's chest, searching for some sort of breathing. Cas checks for a pulse. He finds one, it's extremely weak, but it's there. Dean's breathing is uneven - Sam suspects he punctured a lung with the damage of the spear. He knows Dean doesn't have much time left. He looks to Cas, silently telling him ‘hurry up and fix him!’ Cas quickly presses his fingers to Dean's forehead. His eyebrows furrow after a couple seconds. He begins to shake. He shakes more and more before he pulls away with a gasp and a horrified face. Sam and Jack's faces look just as horrified. They look to him for answers. Cas had maybe suspected that he was too weak to use his angel grace, but he had pushed that thought way down because he'd know the consequences if it wouldn't work. And now, he's facing them. He shakes his head in denial, eyes practically bugging out of his head.
Dean's eyes become impossibly heavy and he feels his heart beat begin to slow down, his breathing also slowing down. He feels peace as he let's his eyes shut, knowing he had saved the world once again, and managed to reveal his deepest secret in the process. He only now wishes he can find more peace in Heaven, where he knows he will eventually reunite with Sammy. He feels his face go numb, his body go numb, and then... nothing.
"What other choice do we have?" Sam fired back, leaving Jack to break eye contact and look at the floor to think. The rest of the day went on in silence as the three continued to think of an option to fix their mistake.
"I've been waitin' for you two idjits," Bobby gave them a toothy grin after pulling away from the hug. "Come sit, come sit," he walked over and grabbed a couple chairs from the side of his cabin for the boys to sit in. "You guys wanna beer?" The boys said yes and thanked him while walking over to their chairs. As they sat in the chairs, they felt relaxed for the first time in a long time. They had zero worries. They could just be themselves.
"I thought I heard you boys! Come here!" Ellen exclaimed, her face containing a wide smile as she called the boys over. They quickly rose from their chairs to greet their old friends. Ellen gave them the biggest hugs, shaking them with excitement. "Welcome to Heaven, boys," she beamed. Next to greet them was Ash, who seemed happier than when they last saw him in Heaven, which they didn't think was possible considering how relaxed he was. But it seemed he was really enjoying having his friends with him. The brothers hugged him too, really happy to see him. And last but certainly not least, Jo. She hugged Sam first and then gave Dean a kiss on the cheek before hugging him real tight.
Not that they ever found the bodies.
Cas curses his vessel.
, yes, Cas is definitely hard. Dean can feel it - Cas - bumping against him, as Cas moves his hips agonizingly slowly. He’s
Dean switches to pushing him up by the collar.
John Winchester.
Dean scoffs. Softly, not to wake Cas, who's snoring gently on his lap.
But Cas doesn’t repeat the question. The fallen angel’s just lying there, fully alert and awake next to him. Unlike Dean, who could totally fall asleep if he wanted to.
“Thank you, Dean,” he tells the floor. “For trying to save me.”
. Or how Dean drew him so carefully, trying to catch all of Cas in a few lines, never fully succeeding. It’s eyes lifting off the page, with pencilled longing. It’s a muscled back, strong legs, it’s questions tucked away in soft graphite.
it, Castiel. Every single soul I hurt, every drop of blood I spilled on my knife, every… every piece of skin I peeled. It was a drug and I wanted more, every day. Man, I regret not giving in sooner than those 30 years.”
But even after the silent ‘one’, it takes Dean a few seconds. He tries to get in the ‘zone’, that inside the actor studio type of bullshit about actually being the character you play.
"What's going to happen is you're going to grow old alone. You'll die and no one will care. Goodbye," Jack didn't so much as look in Chuck's direction as he touched Sam and Dean's bodies, sending the three of them to the bunker. Chuck was left distraught on the dirt road by himself. For the first time he didn't know what to do. He scrambled on the ground and yelled Jack's name until his voice went hoarse. He was lost. He no longer had a purpose. And that was the worst punishment.
"I think that can be arranged," Cas smiled. Dean smiled back at him, his eyes lit up brighter than ever. "Now come on, we have some catching up to do."
"Wow," Lucifer smirked.
"When I gave up Dean, you didn't think to question it, to ask why? Dean was...," Michael pauses for a second to think of the right word. 'Fight' was giving Dean too much credit, but he certainly didn't remain calm. A light blub goes off in his head.
The three guys hopped out of Baby, as they had arrived at a gas station. Sam started pumping gas into Baby as Dean and Jack wandered away. Dean walked up to the men's bathroom before hearing whimpers. He turned and looked down to see a beautiful golden doodle  laying beside some wood and a trash can.
Sam and Jack run up next to Cas, hope in their eyes watching Michael struggle to keep control. Michael's struggling goes on for another thirty seconds before it abruptly stops. There's silence for a couple seconds before they hear panting.
"Sam, we can-"
"When the rapture first began, I took refuge here. It is St. Michael's, you may have noticed," he waved his arm around and had a cocky smile on his face.
"Jack, I'm sorry." Jack looked up to see Dean's face was hurting more than his own. Dean fell short to meeting his eyes and quickly turned away to start approaching Sam. Jack eventually turned to head in Dean's same direction.
"One of you will take's Chuck's left arm in your right arm and the other take's Chuck's right arm in their left arm. Then, draw blood in your free palm and start a chant. I will take your free arms in my own and start to drain Chuck's power...while also draining your lives away." The brothers nodded their heads acceptingly. This would be their destiny. Their one last ride. Their last moment to give everything they've got and go down swinging. Butch and Sundance style.
"And?"
"So, um, what now?" Jack asked. Sam looked away from the television that had an empty chair and what seemed to be a news station.
"I mean, she's got the whole Death starter kit going with the decoder ring. Isn't that awesome? And that, whatever that is. Yeah. I'm good, right?
"Yeah, me, too, pal. We need aspirin," Dean groaned slightly, rubbing his face with his hands.
"Uh...not a group project," she smirked before shutting the door in their faces.
"You can't just give up!" Jack exclaimed.
A few days had gone by since the Winchester's meeting with Chuck. Since then they had just been staying at the Bunker, thinking about everything that had gone down, or, in Dean's case, try not to think about everything and drown yourself in alcohol.
"Dean?" Dean slowly picked his head up and out of his thoughts to see his brother and Jack giving him questioning looks.
They hopped out of Baby to take a good look at the gloomy church in front of them.
He laid in bed thinking about all of that when suddenly felt something. He sat up and draped his legs over the side of his bed, trying to focus on what this feeling could be. His hands flew to the sides of his head to try an steady himself, but the sensation continued. After a few moments of confirmation that it wasn't just a headache he was feeling, he headed towards the War room, where he assumed Sam and Dean would be, to tell them about this feeling.
"It's an expression, Cas. Just- bring him back to us." Cas' expression softens. He nods slowly and gives Sam a reassuring look before turning towards Michael.
"This should come in handy," he mutters to himself, switching his grip on the spear to his right hand.
"Yeah. The thing is, it's kind of late in the game. You did side with the Winchesters. I can't forgive that."
- looks up at them. The three of them are frozen in place, not knowing whether or not Dean is okay. Dean cracks a smile and chuckles, his face relieved more than ever before.
him!" Cas hisses, tilting his head in confusion at Sam's words. Sam just shakes his head.
"He better," Dean grunted.
In a dramatic fashion, he turns to face Sam, Jack and Cas, eyes glowing and all to confirm their worst fears. They all freeze up, unable to hide the utter devastation in their body movements.
Dean, heartbroken and drunk from the previous nights events, approached Sam and Jack, standing helplessly in the middle of an unusually empty four-way intersection. The three took a look at their surroundings, trying to fathom what was happening.
"Michael is going to betray us," Sam said flatly, as if it was obvious. Jack scrunched up his face in confusion.
The first thing Jack did after bringing Sam and Dean's bodies back to the bunker was restore all the worlds Chuck had destroyed and brought back all the people in his current world. He also made sure all of their friends from Apocalypse world remained in their current worlds, made sure all trapped ghosts were assigned reapers, including Kevin, made more angels to keep Heaven from falling apart, revived the angels and demons from The Empty that he felt deserved a second chance at life, and assigned angels to help him rebuild Heaven so that souls didn't have to just relive all their best memories. No, that would be apart of Heaven but he wanted Heaven to be a place where loved ones could reunite with each other. He knew Sam and Dean would be so proud of him right about now. He smiled at that thought. He then thought of what he should do with Sam and Dean's bodies. He needed to give them the best hunter's funeral there ever was. Him being God, went back through time and found what Sam and Dean had described to be their perfect funeral. A choir and open bar. That was so them. And of course all their friends and family would be there. So, Jack got to inviting. Some calls were easier than others, but he was able to go contact all of Sam and Dean's friends and allies. And they all wanted in on the funeral.
"He saved me," Dean finally spoke after giving himself a few moments to gather himself. "Billie was coming after us, and Cas summoned the Empty. It took her. And it took him." Sam let out an uneasy breath, trying to wrap his head around yet another death of someone close to him. Dean himself looked still in shock about the situation. "Cas is gone." He looked away from the pair, the tension in the air getting the better of him. His heart was shattered inside. He had the opportunity to confess his feelings that he had buried deep inside himself for years and he blew it. It was Jack's turn to let out an uneasy breath as he had just lost the man who had become his dad. Sure, Dean and Sam were also his father like figures but Cas was his
It physically hurts Dean to say the next words.
Once clean, fresh underwear and all, he clears Cas’ drawings off the floor and lays them on his bedside table, face down — then thinks better of it.
He glances at Barb. Is that how the women in this class see Cas? Dean looks at Barbara and the other, elderly lady who’s enthusiastically sketching with her tongue firmly stuck between her lips.
. He looks so stricken.
Jensen frowns. He knows Dean’s not real. Right?
Cas frowned. “How?”
Dean imagines himself as the knight in shining armor to all these drawn hotties.
He doesn’t.
He looks at his trailer’s small window — this’ll have to do.
This is where the list ends.
“It’s ‘I need you, Cas’.”
Dean briefly closes his eyes. Cas can practically feel the storm brewing inside him.
He points to the wall of shame, where yesterday’s drawings and paintings are hanging fresh next to all the previous victims.
Eileen nods, and Sam looks over the top of his laptop, eyes focusing on Dean’s fingers clenching his own side with a pained grimace on his face.
Then, a message lights up his phone.
? No. Cas took a step back. There was supposed to be a whole crowd to disappear in. So Dean could enjoy his time with his friends, family, car and Kansas the band instead of enduring any awkwardness.
Cas covers his legs and briefs with the blanket and leans his body against the headboard. He doesn’t seem sleepy, despite looking exhausted.
“Didn’t know you toed that line, but you’re really not my type. Now, what’s your point”
People thinking Jensen Ackles is an organ dealer
“Come on,” Jensen encourages the dog, holding the door open. “Where’s Sammy? Go find Sammy!”
The robed creature steps on the stage and turns.
“Sorry / about the blood in your mouth. I wish it was mine”
A masterpiece of their own creation.
Then, he gets distracted, because suddenly Cas moves his head a bit, rubbing his cheek against Dean’s leg. Dean's only wearing very thin pajama pants, so it’s really a… fest of warmth down there.
“Please,” Cas begs. “Just
“I’m only messing with you, Jimmy,” John says.
How can he leave him in there?
“Cool special effects, dude,” the drummer said.
When their lips touch, Dean chokes back a whimper. It’s
Cas squints. “Capitalist price settings are more of a demon thing. Don’t you think, Dean?”
. That’s definitely the reason.
He googles the French Mistake script to look up the ingredients for the spell to travel to the Supernatural universe, carefully steering clear of that ao3 site Misha keeps sending him links of.
Until Dean swings his knife a little too freely and ends up giving himself a nasty cut in the thigh.
“Why not? Stop gatekeeping heaven, Dean.”
He’d promised Cas this flick would be a little more angel-human family friendly than Life of Brian. Some Jesus-type dude happily whistling and singing on the cross was perhaps a small miscalculation on Dean’s part. But what’s not to like about The Holy Grail, with its Killer Rabbit, repressed peasants and Knights Who Say Ni?
, and for what!”
Pastor Richard takes a seat behind one of the easels and holds up his phone, opened on its timer function. “You may start with your first pose, Steve.”
this shell.”
And nearly has a heart attack when Sam makes a surprise return from the direction of the kitchen with more beer.
“You can’t just say handle —” Dean sighs and focuses on the road. “Just — if you weren’t there for a case, why were you nude modeling, Cas?”
What?
Dean’s knuckles tighten around the steering wheel.
“Bla bla, your gay dads are gay, no surprise,” Chuck continues. “But you know what little Dean here said? Oh Dean. Good ol’ John Winchester would be so proud of you.”
“Never have I ever saved a Winchester from hell,” Sam smiles.
Ever since we met, you turned my life upside-down. I mean, before you, I didn’t even know angels existed.
? Is he okay?
A pretty neat perk of this case is, he’s not all that far away from Rexford, where he worked that Rit Zien case recently. So after this is all wrapped up, he could go by that Gas-n-sip where Cas works. Check in on the dude, and all. Grab a drink even, without the cloud of a case hanging over them.
“Happiness is in being yourself even if you’re rejected by the people you love, Dean,” Cas says, frowning. He seems almost… offended. “My love had no conditions.”
His cheeks must be flushed with it, because Claire’s voice softens. “Dean doesn’t know yet. But talk to me, Cas.”
gay, it’d be you, mate.
Maybe the Empty gave Cas enough time to realise the truth about Dean - he ain’t all that much. Not any of the things Cas was rambling about. Not the most caring man on Earth, not even
Fuck. So much silence to fill with thoughts. When’s that fucking alarm gonna go off?
“Repeat the question in your answer please.” Ben’s smile is unfaltering.
he be looking away? Out of respect for his friend?
No. That’s probably the answer they want him to choose. He’s not about to walk right into their gay devil's trap.
The options, however, make his hand suddenly still in Cas’ warm, soft hair that he forgot he’s still stroking.
He forces himself to take his sweet time stretching Cas, adding more lube. Cas is downright writhing and whimpering, holy fuck, it’s like his body is just asking for Dean, but he knows that it’s not time just yet. Hell, it takes some of those freaky fic writers ten whole paragraphs to just do the stretching part.
“Last pose,” pastor Richard says. “Twenty minutes, again. Steve?”
“It’s just...”, says Jared, eh, Sam. He sounds sad. “I’m thinking about Cas, you know?”
“What? Dean-“
Jensen reaches for his phone. It’s an email.
“No. I don’t know.”
He trails off. His eyes track up and down Dean’s body.
He can actually feel Sam’s massive bitchface through the phone.
How had Mish put it?
Maybe his brain isn’t exactly the body part that’s replying.
Dean swallows. No. Not that… horrible softness in his voice. He is okay. He is okay.
drawn to Cas because he felt so miserable, wasn’t he? Dean’s face crumples slightly thinking about it.
He glances back at Cas’s striking eyes.
Dean leans closer, leaving still a small space between their lips. He won’t force Cas to do this. He won’t hurt him, not for the world.
Holy shit. After an hour of Lord Huron on repeat, Jensen’s just had the best idea.
low in his ear, and oh God, it goes straight from Dean’s ear to his, um, crotch.
Possibly his eye roll is louder, though.
After two hours of unadulterated jollies, suddenly someone sets a tall glass of beer in front of him. He looks up - it’s.
“What?”
He seems to pull himself back together rather quickly.
Sam turns on the sound of the closest camera and translates for Eileen.
Dean pauses, thinking. He doesn’t wanna mess up the timeline. So if he has to rub up all against Cas for that, well, then that’s just the gig.
As if they’re the only ones in the room.
Dean remembers to breathe.
“No — Cas. Look, I don’t know what you’re thinking, trying to work this hunt alone, but…”
“Hey,” Dean says, looking down at him. He’s not smiling, and thank goodness because it’s so much to be near him already, Cas doesn’t think he could handle a curve of his lips
,” Dean says, and Cas moans desperately. He hears Cas fall over that brink. He feels soft warm spurts hitting his skin. His back. His cheeks. His ass. Painted with cum.
him? To his face?”
Until, slowly, oxygen returns to Dean’s brain.
“Look, can we do this later?” Dean rises from the chair. Those damn stage lights are
Or maybe time had been stopped until this very moment, and only now started running again. Like a heartbeat revived.
Cas briefly closes his eyes, then opens them bravely and raises trembling hands. But the very moment he cradles Dean’s face, Dean lifts his own hands instinctively. It’s too much. The hands turn into fists and crunch up the front part of Cas’ shirt, pushing the angel up against the door like a butterfly being pinned to the board.
It all adds up!
“No need.”

She lifts her eyebrows.
Silence.

It’s pretty late in Cas’ speech when Dean starts to realise what he’s doing. Why Cas is so emotional while Death is banging on the door like it’s a damn Kubrick movie. Why he brought up the Empty, and a deal -
“I know right, no idea what just happened,” Sam replies, shrugging.
“What the hell are you sorry for, bud?”
“Oh by the way, don’t check your phone, Jen,” Richard shoots out over a shoulder.
He opens his eyes. Fuck. Cas does look
The third one’s just a large bag of salt. Jensen curses Nesnej. He for sure still has salt left in the little kitchen here.
Jensen shakes his head at himself. Okay Ackles, he thinks.
“Cas,” Dean repeats, softer now, more hesitant, and Cas briefly wonders if angels can get heart attacks because oh boy, he knows
Dean has lost everything.
He walks up to one of the walls, where all the previous weeks’ drawings and paintings are on display. It’s a huge, disorganised collection showcasing various levels of artistry. And, well.
Cas frowns, remaining silent.
Except he is living it, breathing it. He feels his chest push back against the space, demand expansion.
Gabriel walks up to them. This version looks a bit older, sporting a scruffy beard, baseball cap and dark-rimmed glasses. Dean scoffs. A disguise.
Not her too? Does the whole friggin’ world think they’re a bunch of fruits? Two rabbits eager to exchange carrots?
“Right,” Dean nods, and slaps him on the shoulder.
“I know, but…” Kevin hesitates. “You’ve read it?”
Dean points his finger at Cas’s heart, and Cas hopes he can’t feel how it's hammering in his chest as he searches for the answer. To be fair, though, it
Sam knows a hug when he sees one.
Sam is not entirely sure how to proceed. Really, this is not his place, not his wrong to set right.
Right. Miracle.
. In fact, he’s mostly ever played it with women he wanted to hook up with.
Dean lifts up his shirt even higher, and Cas freezes.
“Umm,” Gabriel laughs nervously, eyes darting around at the people in the chairs.
He closes his eyes and imagines it: the pencil pressing against him, breaching him, sliding into him. How would that feel, Cas fucking him with a pencil? He imagines it brushing against his prostate.
“I think he…” Dean pauses. “It doesn’t matter, he’s clearly changed his mind.”
And then he fucking disappears. Into thin air.
He’s in love with Cas.
Fine, not that old. New actually — nice ones. In case Cas got a date again, or something.
Dean supposes this is where tonight’s model will be showing off her heavenly curves.
Suddenly, Dean's phone lights up on the armrest. He glances at it — it’s a text message from Sam.
Makes sense, now that Cas is fully human and locked into his vessel, like a sword stuck in its sheath, that he would have to protect himself like this.
They’re really doing this.
Cas looks up at him. Dean exhales. His eyes really
. It’s Jimmy Novak.
but they’re just too stupid to read it?”
“Leave me.”
Behind him, he feels Cas’s eyes burning into his back.
Dean nods. Okay, let’s hear it. What lovey dovey crap is he supposed to say?
All the same for Dean, really. They’re a grown man and an angel after all, they can manage a little bro on bro action and then have their alone time.
“Dean?”
He pulls up to the All Saints church.
“Leave it, Jimmy,” Dean says.
“I’m sorry.”
Foxhole friendships, between men. Nothin’ more.
A tiny whimper escapes Cas throat, and Cas lifts his hands to Dean’s neck, more skin exposed this time, more to touch, to rub. His fingers feel warm, his lips, damn it, his lips -
Also, Dean totally knows that he has taste. So there’s that.
“You’re literally in my father’s body pretending to be my father.” She wrinkles her nose at him.
And anyway, he’s not about to be intimidated by a dude in a beret.
Cas’ brow crinkles, and he nods slowly.
Suddenly, it feels like a cold wind has engulfed Dean, leaving only his ears burning. No. This can’t be.
Dean has about three heart attacks in a row.
Cas doesn’t need to look up to know her eyes are drilling holes in him. But who is she to judge? It’s not like she’s ever been a billion year old angel dying for loving a human whose only steady relationship is a car.
Cas sighs deeply, and Dean's hand freezes over the top of his head.
After John leaves, Dean’s shoulders relax. He turns to Cas.
The alarm goes off again.
“What do you mean?”
“No,” Dean interrupts him, moving onto the mattress. He kneels between Cas’ legs and slides his hand slowly up the angel’s back. “You’re stunning. You’re beautiful. Has anybody ever told you that?”
With a snap of his fingers, he broke two more members’ necks. “You’ll soon be dust in the wind.”
His eyes burn holes in Sam’s back.
He’s jerked out of his thoughts abruptly by the sound of the bathroom door opening. It’s Cas, wearing nothing but black briefs.
But if Cas thinks there’s a single thought in Dean’s head, he is wrong, because Dean’s melon is empty.
Cas wiped his eyes with his wrists. He’d be fine. This was just a reaction to the music. Maybe Kansas
Cass.
Cas hesitates. “I can sleep on the floor.”
, not the other way around.
No, Cas has never expressed any ill feelings toward the queer community. And didn’t he kill a bigoted pastor once?
Dean shakes his head. “What are you doing here, Cas? Thought you were mad at me.”
But silently, Cas moves his hand away.
“I raised me,” Dean says, unblinking.
Is he actually gonna
John raises an eyebrow. “Didn’t your body go through excruciating pains? Didn’t your own
Just then more people started pouring into the roadhouse. The four of them turned around, their backs turned to a still passionately performing Kansas, to greet the guests.
