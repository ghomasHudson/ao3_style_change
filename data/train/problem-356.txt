13 Jan 2019: So, I've had to go back and make some changes to the previous chapters. The thing is, I don't ever actually plan stories before I write them, so I've had to backtrack and change a few details about the case that started Sherlock on his time-traveling journey. If you don't want to go back and read it again from the beginning, the biggest thing you need to know is that the body of the Victorian woman wasn't found on Parliament Hill, but rather on the beach under Tower Bridge.
Sherlock pointed over to John’s chair. There, propped against the Union Jack pillow like a flat little person, sat a large piece of blue craft paper. In Sherlock’s nearly-illegible scrawl, John deciphered, “John – gone to S.Y. Lestrade got a lead. Taking Rosie. Be back by tea. – S.”
“Just keep your eyes on the road.” John took a gentle grip of Sherlock’s bulge, deliciously wrapped in satin pants which were warm from his body heat. He kneaded softly at Sherlock’s crotch and the taller man cleared his throat. Pressing the cruise control button, Sherlock reached down and found the lever to move his seat backward, affording John more - ahem- head room. One hand on the wheel in a remarkably sexy posture, Sherlock dropped his other arm over John’s shoulders as he bent forward and extracted Sherlock’s magnificent erection from his clothes.
It was, in fact, very similar to an experiment John had conducted in grade four, the objective of which was to determine if soybeans would grow at different rates when exposed to different genres of music. Sherlock did not need to grow any more and, in fact, John wished he wouldn’t. He was currently the perfect height. But he did have a very interesting reaction to different genres of music and John was very keen on his observations of the dressing gown-clad bean-pole in their sitting room.
He stopped short when he saw John standing with a woman who was pretty, if a bit plain. She was blushing  as she handed over a small card. He returned her expression with a warm, flirtatious smile and winked as she waved goodbye. Winked!
"I know," Sherlock said, almost confused, as he sat up on the couch and stared over at John. "My mind seems strangely clear." He stood and straightened his shirt before leaning down to give John a swift peck on the lips. "Let's go and tell Lestrade."
“It’s in the drawer under the kettle,” he called back before resuming the seemingly-impossible task of assembling a cot. All of the pieces were identical and yet, somehow, expected to fit together?
Sherlock's shiver was visible as John adjusted his grip on the handle, his fingers coiling deliciously around the smooth leather. John took the few remaining steps to close the distance between them, staring up at Sherlock with their chests almost touching. Sherlock's pupils were blown wide and John could feel the bass of the club music vibrating between them. His voice firm and even, John said, "Now, Sherlock - we came here on a case. I'm sure you're miles ahead by now, so just tell me: is there anything important? Anything we should take care of before we continue here?"
John felt his eyebrows climbing up his forehead and he nodded, thoroughly amused. "You might even like that movie, Sherlock. It's rather dirty."
Sherlock was still tremendously fit - that was obvious to anyone with eyes. What most people - even those he would consider friends - didn't know was that Sherlock was a Master in Judo. John had caught him practising once in the middle of the night when Sherlock had accidentally knocked over a lamp. In a fit of self-conciousness, Sherlock had moved his workouts to the cellar that was 221C, despite John's insistence that it was rather attractive.
Sherlock clenched his eyes against the onslaught of images swimming in his mind. Redbeard… Tartan coat, eyepatch, long red tail -
“Hmm.” Sherlock drummed his fingertips together. “Dodds had three, Crewe had one… But why Crewe and not Dodds?”
“What do you think?” Sherlock gestured calmly down at the man as though he routinely came upon mysterious crime scenes in bars. John supposed he probably did.
. John held up two fingers and Sherlock nodded in agreement. John put up one finger, made a pausing motion, then pointed to Sherlock before holding up two fingers again and gestured to himself.
“Vatican cameos,” John whispered harshly. Sherlock inhaled sharply through his nose and nodded. Silent as the night, John reached under the pillow beneath Sherlock’s head and retrieved his service revolver from where he had stashed it earlier in the evening. John jerked his head and Sherlock slipped off of the sofa and padded over to stand against the wall beside the front door. John went to stand on the other side of the entryway and he grabbed Sherlock’s gaze with his own.
people didn’t – John’s face swam into the forefront of his mind palace, but he pushed it away. “Their career? More likely, people are so attached to their jobs. But not just any job, no, something big, something
With both hands in Sherlock's hair, John slid his tongue into Sherlock's open, panting mouth. When he spoke, his voice was rough and thick with arousal. "Sounds like a plan."
and John took a sharp breath through his nose. Sherlock's expression calmed as he recognised the apology on John's face. "Sherlock, I - I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to -"
“If you do, it will only be as an absolute last resort,” the detective replied, gesturing about. “This place is far too clean – obsessive, really, it reeks of cleanser – and I’m sure Jack would not want you to make a mess here. Otherwise, you might end up with your throat cut, as well. Now, tell me about Danielle.”
Arg. I feel like my brain has been trudging through mud this week. This may not be my best work, so kind and constructive criticism is welcome. All my love to you guys.
John hadn't even realised the radio had been on in the first place. It was a little transistor, high on a shelf by the only window in the lab at Bart's. Molly had strung all number of wires and strings to the antenna to grab a signal, and John was very careful not to disturb the delicate ecosystem as he turned the knobs. He was only able to get a pop radio station - everything else was pure static.
"Never heard of them." Sherlock shrugged and returned to his beakers. But after a moment, he stopped and turned to look at John again. "Make it stop - they have a terrible tonal quality. Haven't these people ever heard of harmonizing?" John was nearly indignant, but lowered the volume and changed the track via the bluetooth connection between his phone and speaker. For a few minutes, John played something else, some classical something-or-other, and Sherlock was quiet.
When they reached the main street, Sherlock stopped dead in his tracks. There were no cars, only carriages. Women were wearing bustle skirts and bonnets, the streets were cobbled stone, all the street lights were gas. Sherlock’s mouth actually fell open.
His arousal flamed up as Sherlock arched his back and hissed. John teased the sensitive bud with the crop before sharply flicking it a second time. Another brief pause while Sherlock drew in his lower lip, then John asked, "Do you know why I'm punishing you now, Sherlock?"
“Can you feel this?” John gently stretched and turned Sherlock’s foot, eliciting a hiss from the detective on the ground.
,” he whined and John suppressed a chuckle. “That boy was clearly reporting back to the killer and now it might be
“Of course I could work it out, but I don’t particularly care to,” Sherlock replied with a sigh. “I’d rather hurry this along, if you don’t mind. I’ve got a bedtime story to get to.” At that very moment, Mrs. Hudson was finishing up Rosie’s dinner and giving her extra shortbread biscuits before she attempted to put her in the bath.
across the face. "Don't be so cheeky, dear." Then John leaned forward and delved his tongue into Sherlock's willing mouth. His tongue rolled over Sherlock's, further asserting his ownership, and tasting his own sweat and pre-cum. Finally, he spoke into Sherlock's open mouth, "But yes. Twice." He kissed him again, deep and swift, running his thumbs over the lovely red welts on Sherlock’s face. "God, I wish I could stretch you out - fill you with a plug and make you wear it til we get home." Sherlock gulped and his eyes widened slightly. "But I'm not going to do that - not here. You're mine - not for anyone else to gawk at." Another kiss, Sherlock surrendering his mouth with a soft moan. "And I don't usually carry anal plugs with me, anyway."
“We’re going to the morgue!” Rosie exclaimed and John shook his head, eyes cast upward in a silent plea for help from whichever deity deemed fit.
"Doesn't seem to know much about anything, does he?," Sherlock muttered, but John shushed him with a finger to the lips.
and an incredibly large order of Chinese takeaway. It had become a bit of a habit. Whenever things were slow and there were no cases to be had, John would sate Sherlock with another James Bond flick and Chinese and his strange, wonderful mind would be quieted for two blissful hours.
“Tempting,” John replied, bringing Sherlock out of his thoughts, “but let’s save that for sometime when you really bugger things up.”
I'm so glad folks have taken to this story - I'm having such a fun time writing it and your notes of praise literally give me life. Always open to suggestions and edits. Love and Happy Christmas!
“At least twenty-one, including her,” Sherlock answered. “I’ll start canvasing the homeless network – very closely connected to prostitution – see if anyone has seen anymore of these tattoos.”
"If you can't find someone to undo those buttons for you, you know where to find me." With that, she moved to her next customer and John turned away from the bar. He couldn't help but grin. Just a little.
All of these swirling thoughts were what caused John to snap irrationally when Sherlock bounded back into the flat with Rosie in his arms that day.
I love you all for sticking with me. I didn't mean for this story to turn into so much of a fix-it, but here we are. <3 Diana
“Come inside, won’t you? I’ll patch you up and you’ll be right as rain.” He was gesturing toward the door of a lab Sherlock had visited before, though under very different circumstances. “It’s not exactly clinic conditions, but we’ll make do.”
John checked his watch and scrunched his face in apology. "Three minutes." Sherlock sighed and shook his head.
"No, John, stop," he murmured, pulling his head to the side to quell his husband's kissing. John would not be put off so easily - he licked up the side of Sherlock's neck and elicited a positively sinful sound. "
“And you think they’re connected?” John inferred. Lestrade was silent, his hand cupped over his mouth as he tried not to vomit at the sight before him. Noticing this, John replaced the sheet and Lestrade visibly relaxed. “Not just similar tattoos – same artist, maybe? Choosing numbers important to them?”
"Sherlock?" John sat forward and spoke into his husband's ear. He didn't answer, merely sighed and worked his jaw with arousal. "Sherlock."
! Who would have something to lose? And what? Their marriage, a family – people don’t murder for that –” Well,
“Sherlock!” John cut his eyes down at Rosie, who was listening raptly to the conversation happening before her.
Holy shit, you guys! I cannot believe how many comments this little fic got after just one night! Each and every comment and kudos and visit just makes my little heart soar, so thank you all so much!
“Sherlock it is, then. You can call me John, if you like.” Watson ‒ John ‒ added another careful stitch to the side of Sherlock’s head.
?" The detective in his lap grunted a little sound of affirmation, completely nonplused. "How did you get her number?"
John stopped working entirely and gave Sherlock a shrewd look. “No, it does not. Only, it seems, when I ‒”
Sherlock danced all the time, really. He danced about the flat, he danced about the crime scene, he danced about the morgue. He had even taught John to dance for his own wedding, something which John now sincerely wished he could undo because Sherlock surely felt very used. But nearly each and every movement made by the tall, lithe detective was a dance, a sway, a swish, his hips somehow always moving at a different pace than the rest of his body.
The first time John noticed Sherlock's increased response to glam rock was when they were at Bart's. Molly had the radio turned down low and had gone to fetch everyone a cup of coffee, despite John's insistence that she did not need to serve them, and Sherlock was swanning around the morgue. While examining the corpses of three triplets who had died after having their eyes, ears, and tongue removed (respectively), John noticed Sherlock's body moving in a more unified manner. As his hips gyrated gently to the rhythm of
“I know you wouldn’t.” There was a silent moment between them and John found he couldn’t keep staring into Sherlock’s eyes so intensely. “Go and check on Rosie, why don’t you? Make sure those two idiots didn’t wake her?” Sherlock nodded slowly before turning up the stairs to the room John shared with his daughter. Once he was gone, John took a steadying breath, off-balance from the intensity between them.
“Client,” they whispered into each other’s mouths. A soft laugh floated between them, unsure of to whom it belonged.
“No. No, you said, ‘I know how you like the four o’clock hour.’” Sherlock took a step closer and his eyebrows lowered fractionally. He towered over John, but his demeanor was quiet and curious.
“It’s psychosomatic.” John looked at Sherlock with a deep expression, his dark blue eyes boring into Sherlock’s in an attempt to determine his character. He had overstepped again. He was always doing that, according to Mycroft. Changing the subject, Sherlock asked flippantly, “Will I live?”
“Prove it,” Sherlock demanded, gesturing toward the game board. “I deduce that the killer is, in fact, Miss Scarlett, and that furthermore, the weapon of choice was the spanner and the location was the kitchen. Can you refute this accusation?”
“They are so far from ‘just’ words and you know it,” he panted in anger. That was the crux of it, right there. Sherlock could betray him again, just like he had before. Just like Mary had. Anything could happen and all this perfect happiness could be snatched away and John would be left mourning all over again. And he wasn’t sure if he could survive it. “I’ll never forget the sound of you saying that to me before you… before I thought you….” He swallowed and took a deep breath. “I know it wasn’t real, but it
“Self-defence,” Sherlock said flippantly, unloading and dismantling Thompson’s gun. He placed the pieces in a neat row on the coffee table, waiting for Lestrade.
Sherlock turned, apparently surprised, to look out of his window, but he spun back around to look at John after a moment. “Do you think so?”
“Sherlock, keep your voice down,” John said, waving his hands in a lowering sort of gesture. Looking out the window to the darkened street, John continued, “What time is it, anyway?”
"What can I get for you?" she asked, leaning over the bar to better hear John and her ample breasts very nearly spilled out onto the black acrylic surface. Her tongue slipped out over her bottom lip and John watched as her barbell piercing
“John,” Sherlock finally spoke, his voice drawing John’s gaze upward. “I am sorry. I never should have said…
Lestrade shook his head and sighed, resigned to accept John’s presence, and asked Sherlock, “So? Have you got anything?”
going on. “But… when one has eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Right?” He stared up at John expectantly.
, just maybe, let us in on the details you’ve worked out? If we don’t follow procedure, at least to some degree, we could lose the case in court if it ever comes to that.”
John raised an eyebrow. "Excuse me?" Her eyes raked over his conservative outfit and she smiled salaciously.
“With someone important’s baby – someone who would be compromised if she were to give birth.” Another nod from Sherlock. “The pimp?”
John huffed a breath through his nose. How incredibly uncharacteristic. Sherlock usually texted – why hadn’t he texted?
Someone please double-check the end of this chapter for typos and other mistakes. I am drunk and listening to Hozier, so anything could have flown out of my fingers. <3 Diana
She was in fine form - refusing to get dressed, refusing breakfast, refusing to brush her teeth, refusing to
He threw his hands out onto the bed to keep his face from hitting the floor and John pulled his head back by his hair. "Don't you
“Stop right there.” John grabbed Sherlock by the upper arms and spun him until they were facing each other. “You did the right thing. If you’re going to be Rosie’s ‘Papa’, you have to put her first. Always. And you did that without hesitation.”  John paused for a brief moment, but eventually decided to voice his feelings. “I’m… proud of you, Sherlock. You did good.”
milk and four sugars.” He placed a second kiss on the knuckles of Sherlock’s other hand. “I know that you studied chemical engineering ‒ whatever that is ‒ at Cambridge; you sneeze more than anyone I’ve ever met around books and dust; you sleep like the dead; you always‒”
“No, that would have been a bit convenient, wouldn’t it?” Sherlock tried to suppress his grin at John’s sardonic tone and only failed a little.
-ed, but couldn’t stifle his smile at Rosie’s infectious laughter. “I’ve just gotten off the phone with Lestrade,” John said, taking up Rosie’s cards as Sherlock rolled the dice. “He wants you to come in tomorrow to discuss the case.”
Sherlock wasn't far behind, having grasped his own cock in a desperate grip. His back arched upward, dislodging John's arms, and his free hand slid across the table until his head was pressed against the cool metal. He came hard, another shout escaping his throat, and John dropped his hands to Sherlock's hips as they rode out their orgasms together.
-ed in agreement, his hands flying down to Sherlock's waistband. But Sherlock stopped him, gripping his wrists firmly.
“John?” Sherlock. His face was unusually gentle as John met his gaze. He shut his open mouth and cleared his throat. Shoulders squared, John shook off the uneasy feeling and joined Sherlock at the bar.
Short chapter, I know, but I'm sleepy. So I'll cut it off here and return tomorrow. All my love and I cannot thank you all enough for the beautiful outpouring of love this story has gotten! It was completely unexpected -- especially seeing as I wasn't necessarily taking this fic seriously when I started. It was just a cute little prompt response and I absolutely did *not* expect so many people to respond so well. I love you all! <3 Diana
“So Janus Enterprises is completely false,” John’s voice pulled Sherlock out of his thoughts. Blinking rapidly as he came back to the present, Sherlock listened as John continued to think aloud. “It looks as if it didn’t even exist until about a month ago.” Papers were shifted and stacked as John confirmed the theory for himself.
"Not really, no," Sherlock answered causally. Alright then. If no one was in danger, then John was going to enjoy their little break.
“Because you don’t know what it means, Sherlock.” John flopped into his chair with abject exhaustion and placed his head in his hand. Why did Sherlock’s declaration make him so sad?
Rosie giggled and held her cards up to her cheery face, failing to hide her delight from him. “It wasn’t me!”
Well this only took forever, didn't it? This chapter feels a bit short and it's been so long since I wrote anything, but I'm finally back to it. Now that school has been cancelled for the rest of the term, I'm hoping to get back in the habit of writing every day like I did before I started teaching. Wish me luck and send all your good vibes to break through the muddiness of my ADHD-induced writer's block.
“No, obviously you’re jealous of her.” John’s expression of confident derision stung more than Sherlock would ever admit. “You can’t just decide for both of us how this is going to go. You don’t want to have sex because being too close to people clouds your mind, but you demand that I’m always with you because you can’t think clearly. You’re so contrary. You can’t have it both ways.” He jabbed a finger in Sherlock’s chest as he continued, “You’re the one who insisted that we just be flatmates. I have every right to try and find some happiness with someone else!”
The bar was in his prescribed pathway, so he took out the photo of their missing person from his coat pocket and headed toward the line of people vying for drinks. He didn't see the victim in the crowd, so he pushed his way to the bar and flagged down the woman serving. She was wearing a tighter-than-tight black leather dress that barely passed her buttocks.
He was six - maybe seven? - when Victor became the tragic victim of Eurus’s fit of sociopathic jealousy. His best friend, gone forever, cruelly taken away from his family and from Sherlock. Logically, he knew that his parents probably missed Victor more than Sherlock did, but Sherlock had
What Mycroft had been trying to convince Sherlock for years was nothing more than fantasy, Sherlock was convinced was memory. The flashes were so vivid, albeit short. A little boy, a big dog, and a dreadful, cyclical tune.
“I imagine he’ll have several,” Sherlock confirmed. He stood upright and captured John’s gaze with his own. “I have what I need – let’s go home.”
After a moment, John seemed to come to without having actually passed out to begin with. The hem of Sherlock's open shirt was tickling his thighs. He patted Sherlock's bum gently as he pulled out, their breathing finally beginning to even out.
"Molly plays it all the time," he answered with a flip of his elegant hand. "Apparently, it's from some film she quite likes about colour schemes or something."
“People need people, Sherlock! This isn’t about sex ‒ it’s about something you’ll apparently never be able to comprehend. No matter how smart you think you are, there are some things that you have to be human to understand.”
“If you’re going to turn off again the next time you get a case, I don’t think I can ‒ I don’t want to just be waiting for you like some pathetic… I don’t know what.”
“Done,” Lestrade said proudly. “Thankfully, Sherlock called us early enough that we were able to get him into custody before he left this evening. He had this woman’s photo in his pocket,” he handed over a small wallet-sized photo to Sherlock, who brought it close to his face and set about memorising every detail. “You were right - he was after her, too.”
“Why would I want to talk about it?” John felt very tired, but they had to keep working. Rosie would be coming home tomorrow and they needed to do what they were going to do before bringing her back into the flat.
“I think… I think something rather unbelievable has happened,” Sherlock said quietly. Something about John Watson made him want to talk about what was going on ‒ whatever
“Miss Adler,” he called out, shouldering his way into the room. “I’m coming in. We’ve got a situation‒” His voice trailed off as he took in his empty bedroom. She was gone.
“Not to worry, Miss,” Sherlock said in his most disarming tone. “I’m John’s partner – you’ve got nothing to fear from me.” His smile was calming and genuine, but John was taken aback when Sherlock placed a gentle hand on John’s knee and leaned slightly against his shoulder. Sitting across from them in the reverse-seat, Julia visibly relaxed and the meaning of Sherlock’s text became clear.
“Rosie goes to the Yard all the time,” Sherlock replied, his eyebrows knitting together in confusion and frustration. “I didn’t think –”
"Pass me those blood samples, John." His eye still glued to the microscope in front of him, Sherlock extended his arm and waited. John debated insisting that Sherlock say "please", but decided it would be a lost lesson on him in his current state of focus. He was surprised, though, when he handed the slide-filled tray over and Sherlock said, "Thank you." How considerate.
13 Jan 2019: I've made some edits to the chapters I've already published. See, the thing is that I don't actually plan anything before I start writing it. And I've realised a crucial change that needed to be made for the overarching plot. Hopefully, it will all come together nicely now - I've done a smidgen of planning, so (fingers crossed) I won't have to backtrack any more.
The offices were busier than usual, so Sherlock went in alone and left John waiting on the pavement. He took out a short advertisement which read, “Bon voyage to N.S.C. en route to N.Y.C.” The notice would run with a little illustration of a boat to catch Brook’s attention, given that it would otherwise be minuscule in the packed lines of newsprint. Sherlock paid for his advert and made his way back out to the courtyard with a bit of a proud swagger.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed, but he did not dissent. His lip pursed, he turned on his good heel and stormed from the townhouse, the action somewhat diminished by his awkward gait.
He flashed Sherlock a smile and did his best to cover up his awkwardness. Sherlock gave a little cough and gestured with his head for John to follow him out to the street, John feeling foolish and tremendously underdressed in his simple button-down and jeans.
, John,” Sherlock whined, gesturing to the two offending people in their sitting room. Donovan reached for the slipper on the mantle and Sherlock snapped, “Don’t touch that!”
"Never, Captain," he answered sincerely. John tapped lightly against his erection. Sherlock sucked in a hissing breath and his eyes slipped closed.
John smiled, his eyes drooping shut as he breathed in Sherlock's cologne. "Probably not." He took another deep breath. Versace Pour Homme - it smelled a little bit like Earl Grey tea - Sherlock's favourite. It also always managed to send a little shiver down John's spine.
“It’s none of your business, Lestrade,” Sherlock cut across their conversation. “John, come and have a look, will you?” The small crowd of people surrounding the bar parted and John took a step forward, but almost immediately stopped in his tracks.
"Stop, John. Now." Sherlock finally managed to get a good angle beneath John's body and flipped him onto his back against the other arm of the sofa. Quickly, he stood and took a steadying breath. He looked quite the picture, John thought slowly, his mind still muddled. His shirt was untucked, his cheeks flushed, a few gentle red marks blossoming on his neck, and the most beautiful bulge John had ever seen in a pair of trousers.
“You’re married to me now,” John reminded him before sucking fiercely at Sherlock’s collarbone. He soothed the raised flesh with a kiss and Sherlock melted - actually physically slumped in John’s arms with a delectable sigh. John slid his hands down Sherlock's ribs to untuck his open shirt before taking a firm grip on the band of his bespoke trousers and spinning him sharply so that his back was against the table. “Work can wait.”
He was only twelve. Elderly for an Irish Setter, but Redbeard was exceptional. Mycroft would never convince Sherlock that he was “just a dog”. He could have pulled through, Sherlock knew it. Mycroft didn’t give him a chance. They took him away and put him down and Sherlock could feel his mind beginning to spiral out of control. It wasn’t long before Sherlock found himself looking up at Mycroft from that dingy cushion.
With his hands held behind his back like that, Sherlock's chest strained against his crisp white Oxford shirt and John could see his nipples through the sweat-thinned material. He traced the crop along Sherlock's jawline and down his throat until he reached his sternum. Hesitating for one delicious moment, John lifted the tool in his hand and brought it down swiftly on Sherlock's left nipple.
“It’s Greg,” the D.I. sighed as though he had said so a thousand times before and shook John’s hand. “So, has Sherlock got himself an assistant? Finally got tired of fighting with our M.E.s?”
When John released Sherlock’s foot, he let it fall listlessly to the ground, his arms spread out in a pathetic pose. He was pouting. With a heavy sigh he said, “I am an island.”
Detective Gregson was all too happy to see the back of Sherlock and John and graciously offered to do away with the mess they had made of the interview room. They had made a bit of a nest at the Yard to sift through evidence that Gregson insisted was not to leave the station. Finally, after thirty-nine hours on the case, Sherlock was ready to announce his result. They got into a cab and Sherlock instructed the driver to take them to the Times office.
. And I never will again.” He stepped forward and made as if to put his hands on John’s arms, but thought better of it. “I’ll never
"Yes, Captain," Sherlock breathed heavily as his hands flew to John's waistband. He swiftly untucked John's shirt and undid his fly, bringing John's trousers down to his ankles. Sherlock pressed his fingers into the flesh of John's arse in a desperate grip. He buried his nose in John's crotch, still covered by his cotton pants, and
“Just so.” Julia slipped her arm into the crook of John’s elbow and nodded her head toward the door. That’s when he saw the tattoo on her arm – a barcode just inside her left elbow. “Why don’t we go somewhere a little less… sparkly.” She grinned and as they started to leave the store, John felt his mobile buzz in his pocket.
that man?” Sherlock demanded in frustration, pulling his arm from Watson’s grasp as they marched away.
“And the humility, apparently.” Sherlock removed his hand from John’s knee as he took up his phone again and John bit his lip at the loss.
John was sitting in the comfier of the two armchairs reading a text from Harry ‒ riddled with spelling errors ‒ when Sherlock re-entered the parlour. The heels of his shining Oxford shoes clicking sightly on the hardwoods drew John’s gaze up and he nearly did a double-take. Sherlock fully-dressed was as confident and straight-backed as a soldier in his armour, and the glint in his shrewd eyes lit his entire face with excitement.
that sounded through the air caused Sherlock to jump, even though he knew he was in no real danger. Thompson screamed excruciatingly and dropped his own weapon in favour of grasping at the wound above his knee. John stepped from around the kitchen island where he had been lying in wait, as per their plan. As Sherlock grabbed Thompson’s gun, John bent down and quickly checked his pulse and the location of the injury.
Surely, this would be the death of him. Eventually. But not today. John pounded unforgivingly into Sherlock's arse, both of them panting and sweating and grunting. His right arm wrapped around the crown of Sherlock's head, pulling him dangerously far back as his fingers digging into his hair. John's balls tightened, his toes curled in his shoes, and his muscles tensed as his orgasm drove through him. "
Now, you might think this is a bit odd, as Sherlock is generally the one microwaving body parts and mixing chemical concoctions. But this was very important scientific research and, as Sherlock was busy with a case, it fell to John to collect the data.
He had been out with Greg and Mike, watching the match at a pub they liked in Soho and eating an obscene number of chips. While he had not intended to leave as thoroughly pissed as he was, it seemed that his tolerance to strong stout had been greatly weakened since his uni days. Domestic life was perfectly amazing, but a rotation of riotous student do's, it was not. Except for that case a few months back that had earned them the respect of the current medical students' social club and had resulted in John and Sherlock both waking up on a Sunday morning crammed into a pub booth somewhere in St. Alban's after a lock-in wearing nothing but stethoscopes and each other's coats.
After a few seconds of soft guitar, Sherlock took a deep breath through his nose and his eyelids drooped shut. His hands were still pressed against his lips, so he wasn't asleep, but he was visibly calmer. His eyebrows unfurrowed and his breathing became uncharacteristically calm and even. It almost seemed as if he was meditating. Then he elicited a deep hum in the back of his throat - John was utterly fascinated. How could the same artist elicit such completely different reactions? Before he could think too long about it, Sherlock took another deep breath and opened his eyes.
and Sherlock made a slightly-apologetic expression. "The lyrics, John. They're about us. A near-perfect expression of our relationship in the form of popular music."
“Not lucky enough if I’m being detained from my search for a ruthless murderer by a self-important –”
Nina Simone. John could tell from the set of his eyebrows that he was interrogating the stranger, but he still didn’t like how close they were.
“Perhaps I should go, then. Leave you free to court as many women as you like without your former lover stalking about the flat.”
"You understand that you still need to be punished?" John asked. Sherlock could only nod, but that wasn't good enough. So John snapped the crop against his prick a second and third time, each one harder than the last, until Sherlock was twitching and crying out. "Answer me!" John snapped.
Just so you all know -- I've read all of your comments multiple times and they give me life. I don't always reply, but just know that I am absolutely over the moon for each and every kudos and comment. You're my favourite people. <3 Diana
“Hardly.” John stood and retrieved the telescoping aluminium cane from his bag that he had used when he first met Sherlock. He’d kept it all these years and Sherlock had used it more than once – twice for its intended use, four times as a presentation pointer, and once to push and pull objects away from Anderson at Scotland Yard. Extending it to its full length, it was still a little short for Sherlock, but it would do. John held out the handle for Sherlock to grab, but he did not move until John knocked his hip bone hard enough to annoy. He pulled the detective to his feet and forced the cane into his hand. “Come on, let’s go and have a proper look at the crime scene.”
"Foxtrot," Sherlock replied. He was trying not to look down at John, but the smaller man could see that his mouth had softened with a repressed smile.
be a cousin, but you’re a war hero who can’t find a place to live ‒ unlikely you’ve got an extended family, certainly not one you’re close to, so brother it is. Now, who’s Clara?” Sherlock’s cheek pulled upward in a knowing grin as he continued to prattle on at lightning speed. “The expense of the phone says wife, not girlfriend. She must have given it to him recently – this model’s only six months old. Marriage in trouble then – six months on he’s just given it away. If she’d left
“Papa…” Sherlock breathed, blinking rapidly as realisation washed over him. He forced himself to meet John’s gaze and swallowed thickly. “John… I’m so sorry.”
More for his own pleasure than for Sherlock's comfort, John swooped down and plunged his tongue into Sherlock's open hole, eliciting a shaking moan from the writhing man beneath him. He lapped greedily at Sherlock's opening until he was sufficiently slick before sitting up, tossing the remote aside, and thrusting forcefully into Sherlock's body.
“Sherlock, you called the police to handle a police matter,” John reasoned calmly. “You had Rosie with you - it was very responsible of you to call Greg and let the Yard handle it.”
It was such a gentle press of lips, so nervous and uncharacteristically shy that John didn’t want to breathe for fear of ruining the quiet of the moment. Sherlock pulled away, but John leaned forward and kissed him again, unaware of his intent to do so. After a moment, he realized that his hands were gripping the lapels of Sherlock’s obscene purple shirt so tight that his knuckles had gone white.
"I know." Sherlock removed the current slide and reached for a second. He took a moment to roll up his sleeves - a look John very much appreciated - and exposed a tract of skin on the inside of his forearm, marred by something John had not noticed before.
In the five seconds that had passed, John and Sherlock had successfully incapacitated two armed intruders. John smirked, proud of them both. He wasn’t slowing down too much, after all.
sounded again and John stilled, the hair on the back of his neck standing on edge. Long, eerily still nights in Afghanistan had taught him to heed that sensation. Something was amiss.
Sherlock moaned, open-mouthed and hot, against John's shaft before taking the whole of his length into his throat. His head thrown back in ecstasy, John snapped the crop down again, this time on Sherlock's other cheek. The detective moaned richly around Johns cock before he took a deep breath through his nose and swallowed, the muscles of his throat rippling up and down John's prick.
“Yes, it is.” Sherlock’s tone was surer, more insistent, and John quieted. “We share everything. We live together, we share holidays and family events – I have an equal part in raising Rosie, which flies in the face of all logic. You came back to me even after I faked my death and I have been here for you as best I know how since you lost Mary. You killed a man for me, and I for you, and I would do it a thousand times over to protect you and Rosie and to keep you here with me because I
John swiftly redid his trousers and gestured for Sherlock to stand. Jackets replaced, they both smoothed their clothes and regained their composure. But when Sherlock made to leave, his movements forced the plug, still pulsing, to shift inside his body and he threw out a hand to John. He sucked in a hissing breath, squeezing John's fingers, before finally managing to compose himself. Sherlock threw his shoulders back and walked as properly as possible toward the door, though John grinned to see him walking almost with a limp.
"Jesus, Sherlock, you are a magnificent slut, aren't you?" Sherlock nodded slightly, his mouth being too full to reply, and grunted in assent. John swung the crop down in a swift X formation, catching both of Sherlock's cheeks in rapid succession, but yanked Sherlock's head backward from his cock before he could swallow again. He looked up at John with eyes so full of lust he looked almost sleepy. Or at least, he would, if not for the wet redness of his lips and the panting of his breath. "I am going to take you home and fuck you until you beg for mercy."
“What do we do now?” Lestrade was visibly upset, his face as pale as his white shirt and his breathing shallow. John gestured for him to step back into the house and away from the body. He did so willingly.
Not like he usually danced, unknowingly around the room as he was lost in thought. This was very different.
It was electric. Neurons lit in Sherlock’s mind like fireworks and he met John’s fervour with a rough growl, gripping the hem of John’s waistcoat and pulling him harder against himself. Loathe though he was to admit such a thing, he had missed this. Kissing John was an experience unlike any other; he kissed with such determination and confidence and Sherlock had forgotten the shaky feeling it brought to his knees. It was good, God, it was good.
There was an intense pause. The back of Sherlock’s neck prickled as they each breathed as heavily as if they had been running full tilt through the city. And before he could even think of resisting, John pressed his lips violently against Sherlock’s in a brutal kiss.
Sherlock did so instantly, twisting on his knees until he was facing the sofa. Looking up from Sherlock for the first time since they had started, John saw other people around them taking notice of their activity. The woman having her pussy licked had even gone so far as to shift herself and her playmate around so that she could face them head-on. She winked at John as he stepped around Sherlock and placed his  denim-clad erection directly in front of his husband's nose. Sherlock's expression had grown hungry as he eyes John's substantial bulge.
“Jesus, John, why not?” He flung his hands up and said with exasperation, “You’ve never exactly had a problem before.”
“‘Piss off.’” He did laugh then, a chuckle bubbling out from his chest and catching Sherlock by surprise. The grin that took over Sherlock’s face was almost sheepish. It was actually incredibly adorable. “Did I get anything wrong?”
"Doubtful." That made John chuckle. Yes, doubtful. Even John could see gaping plot and characterisation problems - just imagine Sherlock ripping into the
Later, when he’d finally reached the surgery and made his apologies, John took a moment to look up the lyrics (and a translation) of the last song. “
“You can do it.” She patted John’s hand reassuringly and Sherlock smiled faintly again. Rosie needed to start spending time with women other than Mrs. Hudson – she was remarkably matronly for a girl of only three-and-a-half.
real to me, Sherlock, and I don’t know if I could manage it if…. You can do that – you can forget things, Sherlock, that are so much more important than you let them be. But I will never forget!”
“Harrod’s? Not exactly the seedy location I was imagining to pick up a prostitute.” John leaned over Sherlock to stare up at the iconic building which positively oozed of class.
“You can’t just kiss my husband like that.” John's chin jutted forward and he felt very much that he would like to hit this man.
After quite possibly the longest moment that ever was, Sherlock lifted Rosie from her chair, placed her on the floor, and gave her rump a little pat. “Rosie, why don’t you see if Mrs. Hudson has any of those biscuits you like?” She shot John a confused look before nodding to Sherlock and toddling off toward the hallway. Sherlock watched her go carefully down the stairs and into Mrs. Hudson’s flat before turning slowly back to John. Again, John felt that betraying sense of anger bubble up in his chest – all of a sudden, Sherlock was a responsible parent? Without having changed any of the terrible infant nappies or waking up at all hours before she got on a regular feeding schedule? Without taking her to the clinic that time she had the croup or icing her dummy when her teeth were cutting in?
Sweeping his hand behind himself in quite the dramatic fashion, Sherlock knocked the microscope and his precious soil samples aside. In no time, he was on his feet, his hands planted on the smooth, metal surface. He spread his legs seemingly without thought and John felt an intense surge of power at his eagerness.
, something they had to work for and people see them…” His voice trailed off and he turned on Thompson. “A politician. An MP?”
Perhaps John’s emotions didn’t have to be logical. That was something he had tried to impart to Sherlock before, but he’d always struggled to comprehend the notion. All that mattered was that he was upset and Sherlock didn’t want to make it any worse.
“So you’ve said,” John muttered, rolling onto his back and throwing an arm across his eyes, attempting to lower his heart rate. “What don’t you like?”
he thought, and even the voice in his head sounded pathetic and weepy. “You took… you took him away.”
Sherlock turned in John's embrace and he looked down with a little less ire than before. "Did you enjoy your night out with Lestrade and Stamford?"
John swallowed his laughter and said, “Harry and me don’t get on. Never have. Clara and Harry split up three months ago and they’re getting a divorce. Harry… is a drinker.”
“You could always punch me again – make it look like a struggle.” Sherlock couldn’t help the grin that spread over his own face.
“I beg your pardon, but I am the chief detective on this case and I will not have civilians traipsing through ‒”
“Shanghai Palace,” they replied in unison, both focused again on the game. Out of curiosity, John took up the tiny manila envelope and peeked inside. Professor Plum with the revolver in the ballroom.
been sleeping rather soundly. The detective tilted his head and observed John like some sort of long, thin owl.
But instead of being upset, Sherlock smiled. “I’m supposed to be the detective, John.” John laughed quietly, his breath ghosting out against Sherlock’s collarbone, and Sherlock visibly shivered.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft whispered, his voice resigned and tired, “have you made a list?” Sherlock tried to answer, but found that his voice was being held down by the pain in his stomach. His fingers fumbled in his trouser pocket and managed to extract the small bit of paper. It fell from his grasp as another wave of sobs took him over.
Sherlock was writhing against a man in a pair of unforgivingly-tight leather trousers, their hips moving backward and forward in tandem. John had never seen Sherlock move like that. He had felt him move like that, when they were naked and in bed, but had never watched from a distance.  Sherlock was practically straddling the stranger's muscular thigh as his hips rolled in rhythm with the music. He had removed his jacket and his crisp white dress shirt was clinging to his muscular chest with sweat. He was gorgeous and completely enthralling. In all of John's days he would never have imagined seeing Sherlock Holmes, the poshest man he knew, grinding in a dark nightclub.
Their path wound through Marylebone and into Soho until the bundled-up Baker Street Three landed on the steps of the London Library, looking out over St. James’s Square. John glanced around expectantly, but saw no one he recognized. He had learned a few of the faces in Sherlock’s homeless network over the years, but the population changed so rapidly that he had a hard time keeping up. After a few minutes, Sherlock suddenly stopped bouncing Rosie in his grasp and pushed her into John’s arms. “Stay here.”
John shifted on the sofa, almost uncomfortable under Sherlock’s odd scrutiny. He cleared his throat before saying, “Erm… I know you’ve got a brother, and going by the way you talk about him ‒ which isn’t much ‒ I’d say you don’t care for him at all.” Sherlock scoffed and the corner of John’s mouth lifted in a small smile. He went on, “Your birthday is January sixth ‒”
“Obviously.” He settled into his seat and stared excitedly out the window. As the car took off, John felt a jostle against his knee and looked down. Sherlock’s leg was bouncing wildly, brushing against John’s with every movement. Suddenly, Sherlock clapped his hand down onto John’s knee, nearly causing his heart to stop. “John!” Why did he always say John’s name? No matter what he was thinking or feeling, he
John shifted in his seat and forced his gaze away, unsure of the protocol for watching. His hand fell down to his own crotch and he adjusted his erection. Where was Sherlock? He wanted to get him home. Now.
“It was you,” she replied confidently. Sherlock’s mouth twisted up in defiance, but the front door opened before he could defend himself. “Daddy!” Rosie called as John entered the flat and dropped his jacket on the peg.
Sherlock, John, and Lestrade were all standing still, staring up at the body of a young woman who had been hanged in a small abandoned warehouse in Lambeth. Her long blonde hair hung limply around her conventionally attractive face. Or, at least, it
The mantle clock read 12:37 AM. John was still not home. What is he doing? Isn’t it obscenely late? Where are all the overbearing morality watchdogs I was led to believe ruled this wretched time?
"Bugger research, Sherlock, you want a puppy," John interrupted and Sherlock finally made eye contact.
John stared out into the club and every glance offered some new sinful experience to witness. People were doing everything from undulating in the dance floor to blow-jobs in the corner to a full-scale orgy in a large conversation pit. There was all manner of leather and satin and feathers and chains and suddenly, John’s plain denim jeans felt simultaneously very vanilla and very tight.
Sherlock did not back down. “You were out unseemly late with a strange woman, one who obviously has less-than-honourable intentions with you, given her shameless enthusiasm to be alone with you.”
“John? Where’s the tin opener?” Mary’s voice called from the kitchen and John leaned around the doorframe to what would become the nursery.
. They’d just decided that they liked each other – loved each other – kissed once and hopped right on over to co-parenting. What were
To his right, John saw a wall of equipment - whips, chains, cat-o-nine-tails, the whole gamut. They had dabbled in the past with control and dominance and more than a little bondage, but never in a public forum. John found he quite liked the idea of strangers witnessing him assert his control over this unbelievable man, and his eyes landed on something he knew would arouse Sherlock to no end. He stretched out his left hand and took hold of the black leather riding crop.
“Excuse me?” The smile was dangerous now, John’s eyebrows a little lower, his eyes slightly narrowed, his head tilted just so.
“What is it?” She held up what appeared to be a pair of wooden chopsticks and he took them, his eyebrows furrowed.
?” John suggested. Swallowing thickly, Sherlock nodded shortly, still not making eye contact. “Sherlock – Sherlock, look at me.” He did, but it was with great effort. “If Rosie turns out half as smart, as passionate, as – as
“Anderson, we will continue this discourse when our company is not so impressionable,” Sherlock said, all ire for the other man gone at the prospect of somehow upsetting Rosie. John’s heart warmed at his remarkable ability to turn off certain facets of his personality for her benefit. Mouth agape, Anderson looked from Sherlock to John, who merely nodded his consent.
“Finally!” Sherlock bounded from the stoop and started jogging blindly down the street as he typed out a mystery text.
angry if he was going with the bag instead of taking the time to do the leaves. John sidled up behind him where he stood facing the cabinets and wrapped his arms around his husband, leaning drunkenly against his back. He was warm and pleasantly firm beneath John's cheek. "I'm sorry, Sherlock. Really. Tell me about the case."
you!” Rosie reached for the envelope in the centre of the board, but Sherlock put his hand on top of hers.
“Right.” John licked his lips. “D’you have a… boyfriend?” A smile touched at Sherlock’s eyes and John felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up.
“Alright,” Thompson cut him off, pointing his gun more directly at Sherlock. “That’s enough talk out of you –”
"Stop talking." John grasped Sherlock's face in his hands and took his mouth in a searing kiss. Sherlock responded immediately, opening his legs so John could press against him where he sat on the stool and wrapping his arms around John’s waist. Swirling his tongue expertly against Sherlock’s, John ran his fingers through that mass of black curls and down to his shirt collar. Sherlocks own hands slid into the waistband of John’s jeans and started untucking his jumper.
It was all too much. John stood from his chair, then realized he didn’t know what to do so he sat back down. The room was too small. Sherlock was too far away. His heartbeat was thumping in his ears so loudly he couldn’t hear anything else.
Sherlock was motionless for a second, standing by the still-open door, staring at John as he moved about the flat. Finally, he seemed to reboot with a little jolt and scurried into the kitchen, dropping the tongs and cricket ball into the full sink with a clatter. By the time John had gotten the TV over to the correct input (Sherlock had gotten them mixed up when he electrocuted the telly a few years ago) and the DVD started, the kettle had boiled and Sherlock brought two steaming mugs into the sitting room.
“You’ve never kissed my neck before,” Sherlock said, his fingers threading in John’s hair. “I am finding this to be a far more enjoyable activity at the moment.” With a flexibility John could never understand but would certainly come to appreciate, Sherlock melted against his body, fitting his knees into the chair on either side of John’s thighs. They sighed together as their thrumming bodies touched and John took Sherlock’s mouth in a searing kiss. His hands found their way into Sherlock’s hair – his amazing hair – and held him tightly to him as their tongues slid against each other. How was it even possible that that hair could be so soft and smooth, not a mass of tangles, but gentle, separate curls, each one perfect for John’s fingers?
The problem with David Bowie - which wasn't really a problem as far as John was concerned, but for the experiment it was - was that his work was too varied. Rockabilly, glam, psychedelic, electronic, dance - the list went on and on. Honestly, it was hardly a wonder that Sherlock Holmes, a tall, thin, strangely-beautiful, high-minded, well-dressed free-thinker would be into such a unique and cerebral artist as David Bowie. But for the purposes of observing Sherlock's dancing hips, Bowie would be difficult. And much to John's general upset, Sherlock did
of that woman!” Sherlock huffed, pacing again. “To suggest that I would be so careless with Rosie in the flat –”
“All taken care of?” John asked affably, his face relaxed and smiling for the first time in days. And that woman had done it. He tapped the card jovially against the fingers of his right hand.
– say that to me again, do you understand?” His voice was low, rasping, and Sherlock’s eyes filled with sudden realisation and terror.
Grabbing up his phone from the coffee table, John finally realized what had caused his husband's translation. The music from earlier was still playing, a randomly-generated selection of music based on his previous song choices.
They could do a lot. As John pulled Sherlock down into a surprised kiss, they pressed against his own with a practiced fervor. Even though John had pulled him away from his work, Sherlock did not appear upset. Those hips took control, leading John backward to the bed as their tongues danced in their mouths. Those hips submitted to John's as he flipped them over so that Sherlock was on his back and his legs wrapped around John's waist. Those hips snapped up as John plunged his cock into Sherlock's willing flesh and the pulsing rhythm of the music seemed to swim around them.
John hissed and jerked awake. His hand, which automatically wrapped into a fist, eased as he stared into Sherlock’s shrewd, jade eyes, mere inches from his own. “What in
Staring out the window as the cab wound through the dark streets of London, John finally said, “We should have done better, Sherlock. We should have protected her – we knew the danger she was in after she talked to us and we just let her go on about her life.”
He especially didn’t like it when the man gripped the back of Sherlock’s neck and shoved his tongue down his throat. John leapt to his feet and dropped his empty glass on the thick carpet. Before he even realized it, he was marching across the dance floor and had pulled a very shocked Sherlock away from his assailant.
He breathed a sigh of relief. Behind the suggestive signage on the outside of the building was, in fact, an almost painfully hip bar. Clearly, the facade of an adult store had been left as an ironic decoration, and John rolled his eyes.
“What, can’t you work that out?” the man sneered. “You’re supposed to be so smart, aren’t you, Mister Holmes?”
“Get out.” They were all shocked by Sherlock’s words, but he repeated them. “Get. Out.” His eyes were dark with unbridled anger and his demeanour was so stiff and quiet that John felt a shiver.
He took a step forward and now Sherlock was following his lead. Those long legs bumped up against the sofa before quickly folding and placing the detective on the cushions. John clambered into his lap and pressed Sherlock backward until he was lying where he so often lay in thought. Thinking did not come into play as John's hips came into contact with Sherlock's thigh. There were no thoughts in John's mind as his cock stiffened pleasantly and their tongues began to swirl around one another. His mind was blank of everything except Sherlock as he slowly ground his hips down, pressing firmly against Sherlock's muscled leg, and moaned into his open mouth.
“It’s meant to be paella, but we’ll see when it’s done.” Mary offered him a self-deprecating grin and dumped the contents of the tins in her hands into the rice. She had never been an excellent cook, but John appreciated the effort nonetheless. At any rate, she was leaps and bounds better than he was. Overcome with affection, John stepped up behind her and placed a small kiss at the nape of her neck, his hand falling to her belly.
“You’re always Professor Plum.” John picked Rosie up and took up his chair, holding her in his lap. “A brain in a tight purple shirt.” Rosie giggled at Sherlock’s expression of absolute affrontery.
Through an exasperated smile, John replied, “Well, it’s better than the alternative. It isn’t broken.”
There was a moment of stunned silence while Lestrade stared down at the nearly-unlimited wealth in his hand before John shifted Rosie in his arms and made for the door. “Where did he get this?”
Sherlock didn't like to have sex when only one of them was drunk. If they were both pissed, sure, no problem. They'd fumble around each other for hours before finally managing to get off and go to sleep and it was always a perfect, hazy, mess of a romp. But if only one of them was impaired (usually John, as Sherlock honestly didn't drink very often), Sherlock absolutely would
“I’ll just pop out and get a paper while you finish up, shall I?” Stamford stepped jovially from the room, leaving Sherlock and Watson alone.
and Sherlock cried out unabashedly. "I writhed against a stranger in a nightclub. I straddled his thigh and ground my cock against him." Another, unforgiving
Sherlock steered the car off the road and into a patch of gravel on the shoulder, swiftly throwing it into park. With all due haste, Sherlock lowered the driver’s seat to give himself room to lay backward. He shoved his trousers down past his knees as John quickly undid his own, awkwardly toeing off his boots and pulling off his jeans and pants within the limits of his seat. He clambered over the console and placed one leg in either side of Sherlock’s. Gripping the wheel for balance, John gasped as Sherlock spread his arse cheeks before licking his long fingers and pressing hastily against John’s entrance.
John instantly felt his cheeks redden. "Oh, um… just, playing a little air guitar, I guess." He tucked his hands between his knees and pulled his lower lip inward, trying to abate his embarrassment.
began, Sherlock had moved to the bookshelves and was practically twisting about the sitting room. His hips rolled round and round, his chest following just behind in a smooth and very attractive wave. Watching him undulate from shelves to desk, John found his mouth going a little dry. As he considered the papers and books in front of him, the fingers of Sherlock's hand found their way to his chest and started elegantly tapping out the quick beat against his exposed sternum. Similar movements followed through
Later that night, Rosie all tucked in and Sherlock resting with his head on John's lap where they lay on the sofa, John passed a hand over that beautiful mass of curls and said, "You know, you really are quite the romantic."
Sherlock whined and his eyes fell closed again, but he nodded, open-mouthed and panting. "Yes, Captain." He licked his lips and took a steadying breath. "It stays on."
,” Sherlock’s voice was breathy as John’s fingers finished undoing his buttons and slid expertly over his nipples. “The case… work…”
. He missed his Redbeard. So that was what he called him. Mycroft kept insisting that his name was actually Ignatius, but Sherlock found that ridiculous. Redbeard it was.
“You’re very kind. But I’ll keep the clinic on standby, just in case.” He smiled at that as she stepped out of his arms and opened a drawer to her right. It was filled with the oddments of a typical suburban kitchen ‒ soy sauce packets, measuring spoons, keys which belonged to unknown locks, unopened straws, and of course the tin opener. She dropped the utensil back in and dug around for something else as John tended to the cooker. “John? Are these yours?” There was a hint of laughter in her voice and John turned, intrigued.
Immediately, John wanted to slap him. Ennui, indeed! Didn't he think John would like to be taken up on the couch in a fit of metaphysical angst? But things needed doing and he could really use Sherlock's help - if he could take Rosie to daycare, he might not been too late for the surgery.
“I’ll do my best.” With that, Sherlock led John out of the cordoned crime scene and into the street. John took a deep, sharp breath of fresh air, but turned to Sherlock with a look of confusion.
John reveled in the rush that went through his abdomen and placed his thumb against Sherlock's lower lip, running it along the full flesh until Sherlock opened his mouth. Taking John's thumb into his warm mouth, he sucked lightly and John groaned.
John ran a hand over his tired eyes, resigned to wakefulness. “Sherlock, I know how you like the four o’clock hour, but we mere mortals do not.” Sherlock immediately stopped pacing and spun around to stare at John with an unreadable expression.
“Then why bring her up? Just to make sure I knew? ‘Look, Sherlock, I don’t need you after all. Women are still willing to sleep with me, what do you think about that?’”
“Great.” Without invitation or further discussion, John dropped the food onto the coffee table and extracted a DVD from his jacket pocket. He popped open the case and set to work on the DVD player. “Put the kettle on, will you?”
Alright... so year five is wood and I'm a bit stuck. The obvious answer is, well, you know, Sherlock's wood, but in keeping with the timeline (as well as I can), their fourth anniversary occurs between The Abominable Bride and The Six Thatchers. So for the purposes of this story, they aren't quite together yet.
Looking up from the pavement, Sherlock realised that it was dark. The deep shade of purple in the sky indicated that it was long past sunset. John was surely gone by now, out to dinner and possibly even dancing with that Sawyer woman. Sherlock could just picture it: the two of them, laughing and spinning around a crowded dance hall. Their faces would be flushed, John would be panting as he wrapped his arm around her waist and led her into another opening step. Sherlock loved to dance.
“Because I’m more interested in stopping a murderer than following procedure,” Sherlock replied smartly, his grip on Rosie’s hand tightening defensively. “When a young woman is branded as chattel and her insides brutally removed –”
“Sherlock!” A man with greying hair and a tired expression waved at them from beside the bar and John could see the trappings of a crime scene forming. They approached the group of plainclothes officers and the man gave John a bewildered look. “Who’s this?”
Sherlock had announced his awakening with a cry of "Damn him!" as Lestrade texted to inform him of a turn in an ongoing trial. This caused Rosie to wake and begin chanting, "Damn, damn, damn!" as she clambered from her bed. Sherlock had locked himself in the bathroom while John was left to get Rosie ready for the day.
“Afghanistan,” John finally answered. “Kandahar, about fourteen years ago.” His shoulders stiffened as he remembered. “I was shot in my service as an army doctor in the Second Afghan War.”
“Approximately thirty years of age, training as a midwife at a later-than-usual age due to some dissatisfaction with her previous employment. Likely as a governess, given the limited options for women these days. Family in possession of decent money, though she is reluctant to take much, preferring to support herself. One sister, married, with children. Not sure how many, but at least two. Perhaps she chose to enter midwifery after her sister lost a child. Unclear. I have only glimpsed her from several feet away.” Sherlock caught his breath and met John with a raised eyebrow and a level gaze.
“No. Let’s go.” Sherlock spared Lestrade a passing glance and said, “I’ll text you when I find the killer.”
“Yeah,” John muttered, pulling himself reluctantly to a sit. “You said so the first day we met.” Sherlock swallowed.
“Better than the hat.” That earned Sherlock a genuine chuckle. They travelled in silence for several more minutes until the car pulled over at Harrod’s on Brompton Road. “She’ll meet you at the Cartier counter.”
“Well, I call it fear. Old age. Complacency,” Sherlock spat out the words as if they had an unpleasant taste. His legs bounced up and down and his fingers danced on the armrest of his chair. John tried to swallow the little smile that arose at the sight of him.
“Sherlock, what are you doing here?” Much to Sherlock’s surprise, Mycroft sat down on the dingy cushion beside Sherlock. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s torso and pulled him upright with considerable effort, Sherlock being little more than dead weight.
“But you weren’t in my company, were you?” Sherlock muttered under his breath. Not quietly enough, it seemed, as John stopped on his path toward the stairs and turned slowly back.
. John replaced his lips, landing more squarely this time, and took a firm grip of Sherlock's lapels.
“Hush, Sally,” Sherlock said, as aloof as ever. “Your voice summons other idiots to the immediate vicinity.” He hooked the police tape with the handle of the cane and pulled it down before stepping aside to allow John passage. As they passed, John made sure to give Donovan a glare that he could tell left her feeling shamed about her comments.
