“It was not,” Cas pouts.
“So is that why you had to exchange it?”
“You’ll call back sometime?” Cas asks, voice instantly panicked. And yeah that unsaid ‘and then we’ll hang up forever’ still hangs in the air between them. “Dean, don’t! Don’t go! I… I am sorry! I am sorry about everything! I just... I just want you to know that!”
Cas huffs. “I have already forgiven you, Dean. Like I always do.”
So instead, he goes with, “I’d give you the speech about personal space again, but it’s hopeless. You know what? Why don’t I call you back sometime, okay? Cause in opposition to you, I’m human. I need sleep.”
“So what was the name again?” Dean asks.
“It’s just - it’s the writing style. It’s the small things.”
Bucky shakes his head. “She told me.” He snorts. “I think she was mostly impressed. Somewhat annoyed that I marred her record by killing the guy. But not actually angry that I shot her in the process.”
Dean looks at the time stamp. 3am. He smiles and makes an internal note to thank Sam for working the whole night to find something.
“Where are you staying?“ The question comes out of the blue.
“Could you try to be any more annoying?” Dean mutters, but it’s obviously not quiet enough because Sam turns back around to him and his bitchface has intensified a hundredfold.
“I will. If you want me.”
“Heh,” he grins and returns the little wave she gives him before she leaves through the backdoor. He’s never pegged himself for the dad type, nevermind that he basically raised Sam, but he thinks that overall he’s doing a pretty good job with Claire.
“I’m not sure my work and life circumstances in Illinois agree with that.”
Cas had never been sure how much of that had really been Gabe being unable to keep his fingers off of Balthazar, and how much of it was proving to the world that he hadn’t changed. That the camp hadn’t changed him.
“Mostly, it’s me,” Cas sighs.
Cas goes rigid with the words, though he’s not looking at Dean’s face anymore. He’s looking at his hands.
By the time he hangs up, his phone is blinking furiously.
“Make it up as we go?” Dean asks. “Team free the gay?”
“So people here know?”
For a long minute nothing happens. “Gotcha, huh?” Dean mutters.
Charlie takes that in quietly. Dean looks at his hands, fiddling with the remote control. He half expects the conversation to be over. Either because Charlie tells him that Unsealings are against her religious beliefs, so she can’t counsel him on this, or because she says he needs help to see that he’s wrong on this and that he needs to accept his soulmate to lead a happy life. At which point he’s going to throw her out of the house, whether she’s Cas’ friend or not.
“You’ve had enough,” Dean repeats tonelessly. “So, you’re drunk calling to break up with me?” Even for him the sarcasm hits way too close to home. Too close to what he actually is afraid of.
Dean sighs. He is getting sick of this. His computer knowledge may not be up to par with Sam’s but it’s not like he’s living in the stone age. He sits down on the couch and reaches for the laptop to type in his password on the opening screen.
“Is a tattoo,” Cas confirms. “And you really...?”
Of course he remembers. But still. “Let me do something for you at least, Cas. Please. I can be good for you,” Dean begs. Because Cas is out of his league but maybe, if he makes this good for Cas, then he can have something anyway. Not everything he wants, most likely, but he’d be okay with something. Maybe Cas will take back the statement about one night only. Because Dean liked it much better when they were talking first date. Before Dean turned into a frikking crying mess.
"So long as you harbor this creature, I will not 'lighten up' as you say. We should finish killing it and go."
"Then don't call." She picked up the notebook and walked away. A pot bellied man in a biker's jacket smirked up at her over his beer.
"I did my studies. I'm hungry." She got up and went to order food. Sam came in the next moment and joined Dean at the table.
"Pfff-urg. You Angels. So straight laced its hilarious. Ow."
"Not a flat road, sweetheart."
He frowned at her. "You don't sound fine."
"We need to talk," Castiel grumped. "Preferably without the Aberration."
"What the Hell?"
Layla glanced at Dean to confirm he was working his way through his bindings. "My father was a demon. I inherited his power. Makes hunting creeps like you easy, though. How many have you killed?"
"Dude, stop. You sound horrible." A lighter voice said. There was a ring of familiarity to the tone.
Sam gave Dean a look. His eyebrows climbed and his chin came down. Dean scrunched up half his face and threw his hands up. Sam motioned to the door and jerked his nose in that direction. Dean rolled his eyes.
"No."
"Bitch." Layla summoned flames to her fist. "I really wanted to do this clean."
Layla unbuckled and fumbled for the door handle. The door abruptly opened and she fell sideways.
Sam excused himself to get a cup of water. Castiel twitched.
Layla rolled her eyes. "Charming."
"Depends on which document you look at."
"We need help. You still have that whiskey in the fridge?"
"This looks old."
"Cass!"
Sam nodded. "I'll do it. You two go check the place out."
"Why don't we go tonight?"
"Once or twice. I've been around awhile." Layla coughed.
Dean slid past his brother and carried Layla into the house. He bellowed, "Bobby?"
"You will regret this," Castiel muttered and stormed out.
"Didn't tell you to be a host, just put her up on the couch for a day." Dean clapped a hand on Castiel's shoulder and strolled back outside.
Sam confirmed her statement, gaining him an odd look from Bobby.
"It's what it sounds like. Do you think you're the first people to think just because you've got experience it makes you different? My first partner was a human. He died bloody at the hands of a demon. And he was experienced, in his fucking prime. I've seen good people crushed, shot, burnt, hacked up and torn to pieces. You are not special."
"You think so?" she wise-cracked.
"Boy, when do I not? What is going on?"
"Farmhouse," Dean proclaimed. "Harvest God, Farmhouse. Makes sense to me."
"Same as you, we think. Young men going missing every summer in this area," Sam explained. "We were thinking maybe vampires."
"And how old is that exactly?" He started in on his burger.
He stopped, squinting at her while licking grease off his thumb. "You're kidding."
"If you get free," The god corrected. "And even then, I'll just restrain you again. Poor hunters. Thinking you could kill me. So many have tried over the centuries."
"Always room for a first."
"Like I said. No one's home." Dean strolled right in, eyes scanning the walls. Layla picked up one of the clay jars on the mantle piece and took a sniff. She smelled char and iron.
Layla turned on her toes and slammed her fist into the guy's face. He sputtered and fell out of his chair. His beer broke as it bounced off his chair onto the floor.
A knock at the door interrupted her musings. She licked the grease from her fingers and got up from the bed.
"Oh, so that's where I put it." She grinned and curled into his side. He gulped down his beer.
"What do you want Winchester?"
"Whenever you're ready, Dean," Layla said.
"So, dig anything up?" Dean picked up one of the newspaper clippings.
"Name's Layla. Half God, half demon. Anyone got a cigarette?"
Dean finished eating and stood up. Layla put away her camera and followed him out.
"That sounds an awful lot like a God killing weapon to me, Sam."
The screen door clanged shut and boots stomped down the steps. Castiel leaned on an '89 truck missing it's wheels by the side of the driveway. He had his hands in his pockets and the grumpy look on his face might as well have been carved out of stone.
"Nope."
She slowly found her feet in the field of prairie grass. A pattern had been pressed down, showing how she had been thrown from the innocent looking house meters away. The light from the street lamp shone over wet dark patches on the ground.
Bobby rolled up his sleeves. "Sam, explain everything. I'll take a look."
The Previous Day
"Well, I am fine." Layla coughed once into her hand. "Not like I didn't get stabbed."
The rumble of the road masked the sound of the guitar coming in over the radio, the wheels skipping over bumps in the road. A deep bass voice joined in, terribly off tune, but boisterous and unapologetic.
Her eyes turned black and the mirror fogged over. An image of a fire pit with a cauldron hanging over it filled her mind. The image rotated, showing the rest of the inside like a slow moving camera.
"What!" Layla shoved off him, stumbling to find her balance. "You let that feathery bastard touch me?"
Castiel stood like a statue in the corner, furious eyes fixed on Layla as if it were his duty to keep an eye on her. She looked at him a couple times and then laid her head back and stared at the ceiling.
"No." Layla cut him short with a glare. "He'd have killed you on principal. I wouldn't have argued too much in the end. Anyway, turned out to be vampires. Pretty standard raid. Problem was, some of the nest were out hunting. They got back and saw you first."
"Bobby!" Sam tried to steady Layla.
The singer stopped to argue. "C'mon. Not like you've complained before."
"What are you?"
Bobby growled, "You're not just going to dump her here?"
Sam opened the door for Dean and frowned at Castiel. "Cass, drop it. She's our friend and nearly died helping us."
"No kidding." She groaned as the car went over another bump. "You mind driving straight?"
"Willow," Layla mumbled. She licked her lips. "Willow and rabbit's blood?"
"Great, so what do you know?"
The god gloated, "Then why don't you take a nice long nap."
Dean frowned. "Are you racist?"
"I'm being serious here," he burst, turning half way. Before he could say or do anything else, a thick root thrust up out of the dirt and slammed him into the table. Layla whirled, knife flying into her hand. The root hit fast as lightning, throwing her into the side of the cauldron. The heat burned through her shirt and scalded her skin.
"What is it? Your demon half?" he whispered.
He shrugged. "Average. Bread's a bit dry. Okay, so Celtic Harvest Diety. Not ringing any bells?"
She shrugged. "They were going to kill you. I killed them first. Then," she made a face, "you freaked on me. So I erased your memory."
"What. The. Hell. Did you break my baby?"
Dean looked at her sideways. "Do you have to be so condescending?"
He laughed.
She opened her eyes and saw black leather. She was lying down with her face on a leather covered seat. There was a ringing in her ears.
"Great. Then we'll go help Cass with his thing and when we get back, you and I are going to talk."
"Killed? No, they were sacrifices." He knelt to look right in her eyes. "Used to be, the locals would offer something up: the outcasts, the weak, the deformed. I even accepted the odd goat in old times. Now, I have to find my own. A few people die and the town thrives. Is that so bad?"
"You never answered my question," Castiel growled.
She muttered, "As old as I am." She clicked through the photos she had taken at the church.
She blinked and her eyes returned to normal. Dean though was staring at her with a crook in his smile.
Dean hung from the ceiling, tied up in roots, his shirt torn open and a deep scratch down his chest. He was yelling still at the god with long yellow hair. Sam hung next to him in the same manner, only with five extra gouges in his skin.
"What?"
thank you for waiting. Took me awhile to get back to this and polish out the ending. I am currently finishing up the next section which takes place right after this.
"Somewhere safe," Dean grumbled. The engine cut and he got out.
"There it is." Layla pointed to the house along side the road and Dean hit the brakes. "Looks cozy."
Dean ran into the kitchen for the alcohol while Sam took off his jacket in the living room.
A wooden crack interrupted them. About to break free, Dean found himself bound once more, but more tightly.
"Doesn't look like anyone lives here," Dean mused. "Let's go in."
A yell rang out. Layla squinted, trying to see in the dark. The lights blurred, gaining halos for a moment. She eased her eyes closed and touched the side of her head. She could feel the stickiness in her hair.
"Blue and white," She decided after a second.
Layla threw back the whiskey and almost gagged. "Gods that is horrible."
"Next time will be to kill, I promise," Castiel snapped and turned to Dean. "Now that the Aberration is fine, can you help me with my problem?"
"She was stabbed," Sam explained, "but the wound isn't healing right."
Layla nodded thoughtfully.
"I'll be good. You got any local delivery menus?"
He reeled, holding his jaw. Layla lunged in, hitting him a second time. He smashed through the table.
Present Day
"Likely story, demons."
Bobby tossed back the rest of his glass. "I remember waking up and thinking I'd gone on another bender."
Sam somehow got loose, dropping weakly to his knees. Layla risked a glance his way and got wacked in the arm for it. She yelled, jolting back into the cabinet. Sam crawled forward, his fingers wrapping around a wooden stake.
They drove in silence except for Layla telling him where to turn and stop.
She glowered at him and stumbled her way into the kitchen. Several bottles of alcohol sat on the table. Layla leaned as she picked them up one at a time until she decided on the half empty bottle of vodka. She opened the bottle and chugged half of what was left.
"I think I found something, but I can't get close to it. It's warded against angels."
"What do you think is in the stew?" Dean wondered aloud.
"Yup."
"Willow dipped in rabbit's blood. Thought it doesn't look like it was enough to kill you." Sam glanced back at the road for a moment.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I was?"
Layla nodded. "Of course you turned on me. I don't blame you for that. Anyway, I knocked you out and carried you back to the hotel room."
Light flashed over the grass. Layla tried to get up and felt her arm fix itself. She choked on the pain.
"Then what about your friends," Dean asked slowly. "Alice and Jack and that other guy."
"I always knew you lacked brains, but I guess, Sam really did get the whole bucket," Layla quipped, following him into the greasy atmosphere.
"Woah, there." Dean caught her with an arm around her shoulders. "Take it easy. I got you."
The man pulled a sheet of paper from his desk and handed it over. Layla took it and went to her room.
He flinches at the same time that Amara starts growling. In fact, she half gets out of her seat, putting herself in between Dean and Gabriel.
“How’s Eileen? She still coming tonight?” Dean finally breaks the silence.
She narrows her eyes suspiciously, her lips tightening into an angry line.
“You are,” Cas says and squeezes Dean’s hand. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you earlier. But it’s been - she is the reason both Gabriel and I became Guardians. So we could help others where we couldn’t help her. But it’s been - it’s not been easy. Being a Guardian does not always give you the freedom you’d need to actually make a difference.”
“If you wanted to go axe murderer on me it would have been easier before the stitches and the pain killer, you know that, right?”
“Alright, Dean, can you hold on to the car while I open the door for you?”
The tiles of the kitchen floor suddenly feel freezing so Dean heaves himself up. He goes to find his phone, ignoring the notifications and mechanically searching for Charlie’s number.
Dean sighs as he puts the phone down. This isn't helping. His research led him to this forum and the more he reads, the less he knows what to think of anything. He checks the time and sighs. 3:12 am. It's not that he didn't try to sleep but every time he shut off his phone, he had another idea what terms to google to find out more about asexuality and aromantics.
“But you...,” Cas blinks confused.
“I’ll do that,” Bucky interferes and takes the pie out of Steve’s hand. “You can still come if you’re actually interested in the
Dean turns his palm up in invitation and Cas hesitantly slides his hand over Dean’s. It makes Dean shudder. Noticeably enough, actually, that Cas cringes and tries to take his hand back.
“Yeah, please don’t,” Sam says. “I mean, I’m grateful and all. But I don’t want any additions to my brother’s arrest records.”
“It’s a boat!”
“Do you do this often?” Castiel asks.
“What have the tomatoes done?” Cas asks and Dean turns around with a jolt, knife upwards and ready to attack. When he sees that it is Cas he relaxes immediately and lowers it. “Jesus Christ, Cas! Don’t sneak up on me!”
“Maybe he’s had to go offline?” Charlie says, clearly trying to console him.
Which, you know, he still doesn’t know how she did that. All he’d seen was Cas scowling. Then of course, Cas scowling while Dean pathetically follows him around, flirts too hard, and basically just in general tries too hard and flushes scarlet every time it gets him any attention at all, is pretty much a common occurrence these days. And if you want to label it with a power balance, well, Dean’s not coming out on top in that dynamic.
“She might think paying one of the people on the list a visit will sway me faster,” he says tonelessly.
or something. He cringes at his own thought.
“It’s hard work, trying to fit in. And today is Christmas. No hard work on Christmas. So. You’re wearing the sweater, that’s assimilation enough. Just be yourself for the rest of the day, okay? See what happens. Maybe it’ll be a positive surprise.”
“Me too,” Dean answers and hopes it doesn’t sound as desperate as he feels. If he’d ever known how exhausting it is to buy sheets, he’d have taken better care not to get monster blood on so many of them. But then, when you save someone’s life, they probably take having to buy new sheets in exchange.
“Got off your high horse, Dean,” Cas bites and suddenly sounds pissed. “Just listen to me for once instead of going on assumptions. I never texted you to say goodbye. I just wanted to show you the bees. They were sweet. I like bees.” It sounds ridiculously defensive.
Only, there’s this cold ball of dread in Dean’s stomach and while the words are not enough to dissolve it, it’s like a ray of sunshine hitting the ice, warming its surface and making it shrink. So he knocks his knee against Cas’ under the table. “Yeah, Cas, I want that, too,” he admits.
“I ran into Amara - or rather, she ran into me. Literally.”
It’s a soft reprimand, all worry and not a hint of intent to punish. Cas lowers his head for a moment in acknowledgement, but he thinks they both know that he will be at it again tomorrow night. There are not enough daylight hours anymore to get this done without straining his eyes. And he wants to get it done before the temperatures drop to where they hurt in the depth of winter.
Cas nods satisfied. “Your color?”
“Concealing my bond from Amara,” Dean admits.
“But we can do that, can’t we?” Cas asks carefully, clearly picking up on Dean's fears. “I mean, if we both want to? We can be a couple? There is no one to stop us.”
He’s got little success in getting her attention about the case at hand, though. She’s got a star-struck look on her face and keeps saying, “Oh God, they’re cute! Nat, are they always this cute?” Charlie grabs Nat’s arm and shakes her to make her share her excitement.
“Cases have been reported where seals showed up as late as 21. But,” Cas shrugs, “when I turned 18 and went to college and still hadn’t gotten one, I kind of knew.”
“I still need to text Steve whether he should bring something,” Cas says after a moment.
Dean exhales in relief, lets himself become malleable and soft as well, pliant under Cas’ hands and lips. After all, Cas is the one who has no soulmark. Who says that
But the one thing Cas knows is, “Heat hurts, Dean. Even with the tea against pain, it hurts.”
But he’s met her. And he’s got to deal with the consequences. And he’s not sure anymore that he can go through with what they’ve discussed yesterday. Not if the result is that people he loves get hurt.
Dean makes a few random sounds of protest but he can feel himself blushing when Cas side-eyes him curiously. He’s got no idea whether Claire actually meant that as kinky as his brain decided to take it - he’s not going to discuss
Something like relief runs over Cas’ face, the emotion gone too fast to be sure. “See? You’re stronger than you give yourself credit for. You can fight this if it’s not what you want.”
“Cas?” Dean asks, worried about Cas’ sudden retreat.
“Huh,” is all Dean knows to say.
“No, Cas, sorry, of course not,” Dean answers at the same time that Sam replies, “Yes, maybe that would be best.”
Nat is unfazed. “Saw your body. Or rather, the scorched remains of it.”
“It will be for me,” Rowena shrugs.
“Not good enough, Dean.”
It doesn’t take long before Dean starts fidgeting, though. He tries his best to pretend that everything is like before. That they have weeks and weeks of figuring this out between them. That the case isn’t really all that big and a few days of no forward movement won’t make a difference.
Cas is still staring at him, though the gaze is not scrutinizing anymore. There’s something soft and warm behind the steely blue of Cas’ eyes, like he’s looking at Dean and happy about what he sees. He lets go of Dean’s hair and Dean expects a request to move. To lay down or to get up maybe. Instead, Cas moves. He slides to his knees, pushing Dean’s legs apart so he can kneel between them. And that’s pretty much the last thing Dean expected.
“Nah, luck’s got nothing to do with it. I worked hard for this. Both for the place and for, y’know. Being out and proud and not taking any shit. Took me a long time.”
“A straight answer, please,” Cas sighs.
“You got some excitement going, though. What with
Cas is still waiting, still observing, though his hands are clenching at his sides, moving forward in little aborted motions, like he is fighting against invisible shackles. Or holding himself back from touching with forceful restraint.
Dean turns the screen back towards himself and studies the video again. There is no doubt, even though he doesn’t recognize that free laugh in Bucky. He has a feeling that Bucky hasn’t laughed like that in a while. Years probably. Decades maybe. “Holy shit,” he still doesn’t have any words. “Well, I guess the arm makes sense now.”
It works half-what. Enough that he isn’t upset anymore about the fact that Nat showed up by the time he gets out of his second shower. Not enough to quiet the conundrum of thoughts and feelings about Bucky that his head provides in a constant stream.
“If you feel like you have to report this, do it and I will take responsibility for my actions,” Steve grinds out.
Dean stays where he is, though he lets himself plop on his backside to watch the proceedings. He is aware that Cas is nowhere near actually undressing, but he’s only ever shown up in a full suit, only occasionally even getting rid of the suit jacket and never so much as  rolling up his sleeves. So this might actually turn into a bit of a show.
“Don’t ask me,” Cas shrugs.
Steve shrugs. “We all got our issues. War changes you. Believe me, I have ample experience.”
“There are other options, you know.” It’s the first time in a while that Gabriel has said anything in the conversation but he definitely gets everyone’s attention now. He looks grim.
Dean hadn’t answered that one.
. My favorite.” She smiles a secretive little smile. “She’s got the same talents I do.” She leans in a little closer so that no one else will overhear. “Means I know she’s still alive. Cause I would feel the ripple caused by her death. Means that I’m pretty sure that we’ll find a spot for winter where we’re going.” She straightens back up and takes the ladle out of his hand. “You have your answer. Come back when the stew is ready.”
“Yes,” Cas answers and looks down at himself. There are clumps of dirt clinging to pretty much every part of him. He shrugs. “I needed some fresh air.”
Cas’ eyes light up from the inside, shining with a warmth that makes Dean blush. For a split-second, Cas’ eyes drop to his mouth but he catches himself. His smile turns a little regretful. “Tonight,” he promises.
She means that, Dean knows it. He just wishes he could be sure she’s only threatening him. But Dean’s got a feeling that everyone who is helping him will be on her list, as well. And worse than that - there’s Cas. Who she has seen now. Who she could find out anything and everything about. Now Dean’s kept every dangerous feeling for his best friend hidden deep inside, and he doesn’t think she could find that out, but the fact alone that he’s living here…
Steve looks away from him then, out into the garden. “I know the feeling.”
“Beer?” Cas asks when he comes back.
“Dean…” He can tell from Cas’ tone that he’s not happy about this.
Thank you infinitywritten for betaing! 💙
“It's okay.” Dean waves him off.
There’s a picture of a trading card on the screen. Dean remembers the cards, actually. They were vintage even when he was young, but a few of his friends dads had collected them and were all very proud of them. This one shows a muscular man, gun in one hand, shield in the other, looking towards the camera. Or rather, the brush, seeing that the card is painted. He’s wearing a star-spangled costume and looks pretty ridiculous.
Dean almost jumps out of his skin when Cas steps forward out of the shadows.
The thought leaves a sour taste in Dean’s mouth. He’d always thought that no matter else was going on between them - or not going on between them as it turns out - Dean at least was there for Cas as much as Cas was there for him. Now if the whole time Cas didn’t actually appreciate any of their - no, Dean doesn’t even want to think about it.
“I remember what?”
“Ha!” Dean exclaims because he loves being right.
Dean takes a deep breath. He doesn’t delete the messages but he closes the message string. He will ignore this. For now, at least.
Dean wonders why Cas agreed to this in the first place. Of course Sam can make any plan sound brilliant when he explains it, but frankly, now it sounds like the worst plan on the planet. It might still get them to solve their case, definitely, but Dean might just get himself in so deep that there’s no going back anymore. When that happens, he’ll lose Cas for sure.
That doesn’t make much sense.
“What’s with pie?”
“Dean, yes, we’re okay,” Jess says. “I’m sorry, I didn’t want to worry you. But I texted you and you didn't answer. I got worried.”
“If you can do stitches on a hamster, you can do stitches on a human,” Castiel frowns and drags Dean with him when he pushes past Chuck and into the house. “Where should I put him?”
Dean allows his knees to give out under him and lets himself sink to the kitchen tiles because the weight of that is just too much.
“About what?”
“Personal opinion? Start by acknowledging he existed. Tell your mystery man about him. Write it on a postcard if you have to. But let Gabe be a part of your life. He deserves to be.“
Dean feels the heat creep up his neck. “Sorry,” he mumbles.
She gives him a smile that is as sweet as it is dangerous. “Import/Export, I told you that.” Then, with a quick move, she captures his hand in an iron grasp and turns it to look at his wrist. “So you’re the one.”
“She is dangerous. It is a
“So, where were we?” Amara asks pleasantly as soon as Gabriel is gone. She doesn’t seem to have any intention of letting go of Dean’s hand so that he can drink his coffee. “Ah yes, the past few days. Did they help you clear your mind? I understand that you went to see your brother. How is he?”
“Yeah,” Dean says. “I’m looking forward to a happy life on my own.”
Natasha directs them to clean away the spy equipment. She’s got the information she needed and now she’s on the phone, talking to God knows who while leaving it to Steve and Bucky to disassemble the gadgets and store them in their cases again.
“Hot cocoa with tiny marshmallows,” Cas says and wrinkles his nose.
“Yes, Dean. That’s all.”
Cas considers that for a moment before he shrugs. “It’ll be the movers who have to pack stuff. Gabe is going to put everything in storage. He and Charlie are working on getting it in a container and down to Cali without leaving a trace.”
“He’s got bacon and eggs, too,” Sam helpfully supplies. “Though it's too many fats and not enough nutrients for me. And those two are always into the sweet breakfast foods if you give them a choice.”
“You know what I mean.” Dean averts his eyes. He hates it, that every conversation of this type comes back to the same topic. He hates it that everyone worries about him.
“It won’t, love. It won’t happen again,” she soothes softly, stroking her hand through his hair.
And Dean does, in a way. He feels empty somehow, like the tears took away some of the ballast inside him but there is nothing to fill up the new space. It’s disconcerting, so he turns away and to the nightstand to get the water and the pain killers. He winces when he turns a little too abruptly. Cas had pushed the pain into the background, but now it comes back.
There is a box in my closet. You’ll have to dig to find it, I’ve buried it under everything else. It won’t look like much, it’s just an old shoe box. But it is my past. Go there and get it. Look through the contents and dissect them as you please. Ask me what you need to ask. I never wanted to keep secrets from you. I just never had the words.
And that wasn’t at all what Dean was saying. He was apologizing for being a dick. “I’m not pitying…”
Cas gives him a nonplussed stare, but then his eyes soften. “Of course, Dean. We’re good.”
“Oafs?”
“Because it makes me assume.”
“Dean?”
So Steve stretches so that he can put a hand on Bucky’s knee. “Hey,” he says quietly. “Don’t. Till the end of the line, remember?”
“Look, Cas, it’s just a month or so, okay? Dean will get his shit together.” He’s pleading now and he knows it. He probably also shouldn’t make it so obvious that he plans on actually letting them sit here for at least this whole month.
Cas parses that for a moment. “Is that your way of saying that you were committed?”
“Why didn’t you ever tell me?” Dean asks flabbergasted.
He doesn’t even have to look to know that she’s raising one eyebrow at him. When he does look, that’s exactly what she’s doing.
“I can tell my son to set up some secure communications. Give him the money and the information that he needs and your documents will be ready.”
“The soulmate bond,” Charlie starts back up once it’s clear that no one else is going to continue, “has been activated. Fleeing it without breaking it would only make it stronger. To the point where I fear that Amara would feel you over long distances. Very long distances. I’m not sure you could outrun her forever.”
Getting into the Impala feels like coming home. His car always gives him some peace with her smooth lines and her steady rumble. And there is a second of calm today, too, of letting the leather smell engulf his mind and crowd out all thoughts but the ones of endless roads, miles put steadily behind. The moment passes too soon, though, as reality returns with a buzz of his phone.
“I am all ears,” Cas nods. He still exudes tension, though. Like their almost-fight left him rattled.
There is nothing to say to that. Nothing to answer that would make this even a slight bit better. So all Dean does is drop his head onto Cas’ shoulder. Cas’ arm comes up around him, drawing him close.
“Well, it would make much sense for him, to go to where his career options are best. And now that we have found each other, he doesn’t have to stay just to take care of you anymore. That’ll be a relief for him.”
“Ah, dammit, I should have made something that needs cutlery to eat. I mean, how the hell am I going to test their reaction to silver now?” Dean continues unperturbed.
Dean’s about to admit that the whole thing for all its dangers was a total bust when Cas says, “There’s something peculiar about them. It’s - I’ve felt it from the beginning but my senses are severely diminished right now. But it’s like - like they’re much older than they look.”
so he stops, “anyway, what I want to say is that I’m attracted to you. And I’d - I’d like to try it out, you know? Whether it works between us? Sex, I mean,” he stumbles over his words. “But if it doesn’t or if you don’t want that, I’ll still -,”
Bucky processes that for a second before he says. “I do that still. All the time.”
“Oh, it is and you will. I have no doubts.”
“Arrrr-woof.”
“I wouldn’t want you to,” Dean replies somewhat heatedly. “When I fell in love with you, it was with all the quirks included. And the, umm, dominant thing as well.” His voice wavers towards the end of the sentence, short-lived anger already burned out and embarrassment creeping back in. He shakes his head unwillingly. He’s been over this with himself a bazillion times in the past few months, he
“Nah, Steve, I know you want to, but you can’t protect me from this. I needed to know. Need to at least get an idea of the shit I did. And the shit I have to expect from different people. They ain’t all Natasha.”
“Is that so?” Cas asks and the way he keeps his eyes locked with Dean’s make something hot and smoldering come back alive inside him.
“You were looking for me?” Cas tries to find his way back from his uneasy dreams about cold mountains and feverish snowfalls and into this conversation.
They eat in silence for the first bit, well, in silence apart from what Dean knew was coming. What he didn’t know was how Cas’ moans around his food would play together with his
“No, Dean, I don’t.”
“Why?” Cas asks.
“That’s not - You know what I mean,” Dean grumbles.
They stay at the door while Sam climbs out of the pickup truck and then while he opens the passenger door to let out - what was his name again? It’s a fur-ball, a giant one, and he’s excitedly yapping around Sam, not letting him out of his sight.
Dean takes Cas’ arm, loosely splayed over his chest so far, and draws him in tighter, until Dean is firmly pressed against Cas’ chest, Cas’ hand on Dean’s chest holding him.
“But I can’t… I don’t…” Helplessly, he turns to Dean.
He looks away when Cas catches him staring.
Cas frowns at him though his eyes stay too soft for him to be seriously upset. “The Lincoln was a good car, Dean.”
"How is he? As a person, I mean?" Claire asks.
“We’ll keep you safe, Cas, okay? No matter what else, I know we’ll do that,” Dean reassures him, misinterpreting Cas’ silence.
Dean’s just decided to wrap the second burger for later because otherwise there won’t be space for pie in his stomach, when Cas speaks up again. “How much do you want me to tell my brother?”
“Dude, I stabbed you through the chest.”
to call if Dean needs something, Dean sits down on the couch and looks at his phone. He is relieved to find no new calls or messages. It’s been a while since he’s stopped answering any of Amara’s attempts to communicate with him via his cell phone, so maybe it’s finally sinking in. Yeah, right. He snorts at his own foolishness. Then he rereads the messages from this morning. He looks at the clock and decides that Sam had enough beauty sleep. He hits the call button.
Cas @Dean: I’m sorry to put this on you. I will not be upset if you bow out.
Dean sits up, suddenly not feeling like he needs the bed to support his weight anymore. Because he’s dug beyond the pain and the fear and he’s expected to find more pain and fear there, but instead, the deeper he delves, the more the hope solidifies into something that feels, well, solid. A core of his being, maybe, though it is bigger than him. It reaches out from inside him to the ones he loves. It’s a foundation to build on. To build a life on.
our society. Dean, believe it or not, but I’m not actually a baby in a trenchcoat.”
Relief courses through him but then Cas gets up and immediately everything in Dean screams
As if there was ever any danger of that. Cas chuckles at the thought and relaxes against Dean’s chest, curling up into Dean’s warmth, “Sometimes you are very silly, Alpha.”
Well, now’s as good a time as ever if Dean really wants to do this. Which he’s still only half-certain about.
“I’m working on it, Dean, just give me a sec.” There is furious typing on the other end of the line. “I’ll try to counter-hack them. Maybe I can find out more about them.”
“Cause we weren’t,” Sam shrugs. “Happy surprise. Cause you know, there are those, too.” He nudges Dean and puts the ultrasound pic safely back into his pocket when the waitress comes with their food and drinks.
“Sam,” the tall guy nods, “and I mean the whole two guys moving in together thing. Still a bit of a novelty in suburbia, isn’t it?”
“It’s not like that.” Dean rubs a hand over his face but he sits down as well. He’s not going to get rid of Charlie anytime soon.
He does and holy cow, somehow his brother’s answer has brought an immediate reply from angelheart.
“I’ll make sure they won’t. That it’s someone with an open mind. Okay? I promise they’ll help.”
“You can tell me, love. What is going through that pretty head of yours?” Amara encourages him.
“Wait and see,” Charlie smirks. “So, want me to go easy on you or start with Rainbow Road?”
“What?” Dean asks, not following. “You won’t accept my apology?”
Dean shrugs, though he’s still smiling. “Pity Sam isn’t here. That’s my brother. I’d make him get Mario. Then I’d be the tall brother for once. Cause Sam’s a moose.” Dean trails off lamely. He frowns when he notices that he’s just volunteered a piece of information about himself. She didn’t even have to ask. Huh.
She grins smugly as if that’s the end of the discussion, while Cas stares at her with an open mouth and Dean guesses that he isn’t much better.
“Yeah. See you soon, Bobby.” His voice breaks on the last few words and he quickly hangs up.
“Charlie!” Natasha warns, even while Steve follows Bucky in ducking his head and hiding his expression because he knows he’s blushing brightly.
“Charlie, that’s not…” Dean starts.
He steps up behind Cas, draping himself over him. And yeah, Cas’ breath hitches at the contact as well, so at least Dean isn’t the only one affected. Dean takes it as a win and grinds his hips against Cas a little bit, even while he takes another egg out of the box and puts it in Cas’ hand.
“Are you feeling better now, love?” Amara asks him, voice gone soft.
“Steve?” Bucky holds him back. “Can we sit outside for a bit?”
“That’s very reassuring coming from the beaten-up drunk in the alley-way, thank you very much,” the man rolls his eyes.
"Sam!" Dean interrupts. "What's with the fifth degree?"
“You could have tried!”
It’s the noises that make Dean look away from Cas eventually. There’s kissing. Of the hungry wolf kind.
get out the other side. I promise.”
“Hey,” Steve holds his hands up in an appeasing gesture. “It’s all good. We are still strangers to each other. Though I must say that the evening has done a lot to change that. Would you allow us to reciprocate and come by our place later this week?”
a cute one, aren’t ye?” Rowena chuckles and runs a light finger along his cheekbone.
Dean stares into the fire as he eats, chewing slowly and without tasting any of his food, Cas would bet.
But Dean holds up a hand to stop him. "You came back. Took me a while to figure out that I had to let you go, took you a while to figure out that I had actually done that. But you came back in the end.”
Cause it’s different with Cas. Yeah, they bitch and bicker and hurt each other, but Cas doesn’t expect Dean to fill a predefined role. Actually, whenever Dean tries, Cas looks right through him and calls him out on it. Dean never had that much ability to fool him. It should bug him more than it does.
And on another note: If any of you speaks French and would maybe be willing to help me with a thing, please let me know how I can contact you in the comments, so that I can ask you something? I'd be grateful!
Garth’s sock puppet show? There is no way he suddenly writes, you know, sex scenes and shit.”
Which of course means it isn’t there. Because this is Dean and his luck always abandons him when he needs it the most.
He swallows heavily.
“I’m from Illinois.”
“Huh?” Dean asks.
“Well…” And suddenly Dean’s not all that opposed to going back to the topic at hand. “So, what do I do now? About angelheart I mean.”
for an answer from you!” She squeals again. “You gotta answer, Dean! You gotta answer
Cas nods as he takes one of the duvets. “I will go make myself a bed on the couch then.”
Still reluctant, Cas untangles himself from Dean and gets up. His whole spine pops when he stretches.
Dean shakes his head. She doesn’t need to. “They’re beautiful.” He gives her a lopsided little smile.
“Not the way your family celebrates Christmas I gather? If they are celebrating?” He’s blatantly fishing for information but he’s learned early on that subtlety is an art that’s lost on Castiel. See also: all his failed attempts at flirting.
“Hey, morning,” Dean says to shake himself out of the dream when he finally steps into the kitchen.
“Yeah,” Dean nods. “Yeah, I think I do. I think I - actually, I think I kind of feel the same way about you that you feel about me. Like, you were my friend first. And then, then something changed. I can’t, like, pinpoint it, but…”
“They can meet us today.”
He turns on the TV for distraction and background noise, but even the TV can’t keep the silence at bay. It’s like the voices of the reporters don’t even reach him, their message getting lost in transmission.
but he can’t bring himself to actually do it. It’s too painful and too true, ”- gets hurt sooner or later. The dog won’t be an exemption. Do you want to have the death of a puppy on your head?”
“I never wanted,” Cas looks away though he doesn’t let go of Dean’s hand, “to be one of them, you know.”
“Well,” Gabe chimes in. “From a practical perspective, I have to say, the less people we tell the easier this is going to be to control. I’ll place my cafe at your disposal for the funeral party, but I’d rather not get arrested for this shit.”
It‘s his 27th attempt to enter the graveyard.
“I trust you,” Dean says simply. “You wouldn’t go too far.”
“Dean, my falling is not your responsibility. It never was. I made my own choices.” And dammit if Cas doesn’t sound forgiving and gentle and everything that Dean doesn’t deserve.
“But this year your feet freeze in the snow just like ours! And this is only the beginning! It’s not even really cold yet!” Sam argues. “Dean, you can’t honestly want to have Cas freezing to death because you’re stubborn!”
“Like he’d stand a chance against either of them on their own,” Claire shakes her head. “Dude.”
It’s not news to him that Cas is good-looking and it isn’t even really news to him that he finds him attractive. It’s just - Dean’s worked his whole life under the assumption that sex was just sex until you met your soulmate. Once you’ve done that, you do the whole relationship romance thing. And thus, he’s always taken care to keep sex to just sex, and form no attachments. Anyone who meant anything to him was off limits. Because you don’t ruin a good thing just for a romp between the sheets.
That leaves all of them stunned.
“Doesn’t it?” Dean doesn’t move away from Cas but he turns his head to her. “So you’re telling me
Cas makes another attempt at passing Dean while Dean keeps adamantly blocking the doorway.
Steve is stunned for a moment.
“I’m not sure you want the active Guardians and the lawyer in here if you want to discuss this, Dean-o,” Gabe cautions.
But even a limited choice is still a choice. And if the only thing he could control was that his mother didn’t get the chance to hurt someone else he loved, then so be it. He’d take that bit of control and run with it. It had been too late for him anyway. He’d already been broken.
“I want to come back home to you, Dean. To you. It’s not – you don’t have to – but I thought you should know.”
It gets him a small smile from Cas, too, like he notices the effort that that’s cost Dean. The smile is not as bitter as he’s used to seeing lately, either. Unfortunately, it’s a lot sadder instead. “I’m angry at myself, Dean. Not at you.”
He knows Charlie isn’t all convinced about that, and Dean isn’t actually sure Cas knows, either, but that doesn’t make it less true.
Charlie nods and turns back to Gabe. “Your cafe it is. I’ll follow you there.”
So many thanks to Edelwin for turning my atrocious French into something that makes sense! <3
Cas shrugs. “I have a lot of experience with not fitting in, no matter how hard I try, in many different places. I have little doubt that I can manage it here just as well as everywhere else.” He gives Dean a smile that is supposed to cover the pain but that does an awfully bad job at it.
“Dean,” Cas says a little louder and he’s using his stern voice so Dean looks up, meets the other man’s eyes. “I can’t accept this. I just need 2 or 3 hours of sleep, Dean. You should at least try to get to 6. You get the chance rarely enough.”
They haven’t talked about anything feelings-related in the days (weeks? lifetimes?) before Sam found this case and suggested they move in together. Dean still wonders what made him think that this was a good idea or how he even agreed to this. Maybe he thought for one moment that he could fix things doing this. But obviously he can’t even do normal things like buying stuff for a home. Their home, even though it is only temporary.
“Alright,” Chuck says and gets rid of his gloves. “That’s it then. I’d love to chitchat but you should go home rest and I want to go back to bed. So I’m throwing you out.”
“No, Dean, that’s
“What did you expect?” Hannah asks curiously.
“Okay. Just let me know if you change your mind,” Gabriel nods. He sends a worried glance back at Dean where Amara can’t see.
because Dean’s lips are pressed against his. Because that’s the only reaction he has. The only thing he has to offer.
Steve nods. “You’ve told me that before. And I’ve accepted it. I don’t need to be reminded.”
, and embarrassingly, Bucky comes over to pat him on the back until the coughing has subsided.
“You still shouldn’t let me elbow you in the face,” Cas says, voice and face softer than they had been. Like he’s noticed everything that Dean has changed and is proud of him but doesn’t want to admit it.
“Meaning?” Dean asks. “What is the procedure here? What are the dangers?”
“Yeah,” Cas closes his eyes for a long moment. “Your life plans. That was what we were talking about.” When he opens his eyes again the smile on his face is obviously fake. “We’ll get them in order somehow. It’s not unheard of that people develop a second mark after their partner died. Maybe this is how it’s going to work for you. Maybe the second time will bring the person you want.”
“Okay, let’s do this.” His voice sounds more determined than he feels. In an effort not to take Cas’ hand again, Dean buries his own hands deep in his pockets and walks over to Gabe with long strides, leaving Charlie and Cas to follow him.
“Just out of curiosity, what do you think that I am?” Cas asks.
Dean feels himself turning beet-red. He opens his mouth to rebuff her but no words come out.
Castiel looks at him thoughtfully for a moment, then he shrugs. “I promise nothing. For the kittens, anyway. I’ll try to keep Dean from a repeat performance.”
“What did you find?” Steve gives in with a sigh.
“Yeah, right. I wish. Did you find anything else?”
“Language nerd,” Dean rolls his eyes fondly and bumps Cas in the shoulder.
“Dean.” Cas goes for calmth but it still sounds worried. “You were far away.” He is kneeling in front of Dean, his strong grip on Dean’s shoulder not loosening. “Are you back with me now?”
It actually sounds apologetic, so Dean gives in. "Ah, her living situation before was not feasible anymore. Her grandma and her had, uhhh, spiritual differences."
“But Dean!” Claire whines.
“No,” Steve whispers, his voice abandoning him. “No, it’s not. But it’s...” The first time they wouldn’t have to hide. The first time there doesn’t need to be shame attached to it. The first time they wouldn’t need to encourage each other to find someone else. Someone less dangerous. “I’m not your only option, Buck. I mean, I know it’s hard to find someone with shared life-experiences, but - there’s Nat. There’s others whose lives have not quite been normal. You ain’t stuck with me just cause you half-remember some things from - before.”
“What?” It’s Cas’ turn to stare at Dean uncomprehending.
“Yes, Dean, I’m serious.”
“Hey, don’t dis alternative lifestyles.”
Benny shakes his head but his voice is more peaceful when he answers, “You know best, Chief. I hope anyway.”
“I wasn’t sure it was going to work. We don’t know each other well enough for me to know exactly where to prod. And if you had kept your walls up, I wouldn’t have kept poking. But Dean, you responded so beautifully. You are amazing.”
But the reason was either that they already had had sex before, that they were playing and Cas wouldn’t allow sex, or that they’d been to a party and were too tired and drunk to have sex. Because they haven’t ever lived together. So when Dean stayed over, sex was usually on the menu.
“Cas…” Dean’s got no idea what to say to this. Because yeah, of course he’s planned to make Cas see reason. He’s got no idea why Cas wants to go with him in the first place. It’s not like they are - anything, really. “You have your whole life here, man. A job that you love. A house. Friends. Your brother. Don’t throw it all away because of me.” Cause Dean is definitely not worth that.
It shouldn’t set his heart racing. It really shouldn’t. It also shouldn’t set off an automatic reaction of wrapping his hand around Bucky’s neck, drawing him close until their foreheads rest together. Until they are breathing in each other’s breaths. It shouldn’t push tears into his eyes and it shouldn’t make the I love you that he wants to say every day, no, every minute of every day so painful in his chest that it’s almost unbearable.
, Dean. It’s a matter of being practical.” Cas trails off, looking into the distance instead of at Dean.
Dean snorts. “Dude, she’s saving herself. All I did was provide favorable circumstances.”
“So is that my first life lesson?” Dean asks.
“I will wait for you. And Dean?”
“He’s left me before,” Claire accuses.
Cas’ smile is still no happier than before. “You’re welcome, Dean.”
If Cas thought that Sam taking Kaz means he’s going to get out of further riding lessons for the time being, the next morning shows that he’s mistaken.
“You need me to lawyer him?” Sam asks, voice growly.
“Really?” Gabe rolls his eyes. “
Instead, Dean throws himself into cooking. There’s something he’s wanted to try out for ages, and this is his opportunity doing it without Sam making fun of him: Hester Blumenthal’s recipe for fries. It’s a fucked up recipe, needing almost the whole day for one batch of fries, but that’s at least going to get his mind off things and if it works out, it’s going to go great with the burgers tonight. So he throws himself into peeling and slicing potatoes.
“You answer. And try to figure out whether they actually know you or not.”
“It’s good to see you, too, Dean,” Sam frowns.
to it. Cause you can’t.”
Cas shakes his head, though he does so with a smile.
Bucky shakes his head. “Your call, Cap.”
“Small price to pay.”
you, Dean!” Cas’ voice is angry now. “Right there in a room full of people, in what was supposed to be a civilised conversation about the future!”
Ellen smiles sweetly at him. “Why wouldn’t it be?”
He should have expected the question, he guesses, seeing how, yeah, he had been sure that he didn’t want to live with Amara before he even met Charlie. Well, he’s still sure he doesn’t want to live with her, nothing has changed there. Or will ever change. Not that it makes a difference.
Yet, he feels lost. Like he’s watching himself from the outside and someone else has taken over his life.
“What now?” Cas asks and shakes him out of his thoughts.
“Not making it any better, Cas,” Dean says because Dean will never stop feeling guilty for making Cas fall. At the same time, he can’t help smiling a little as well when he sees Cas’ smile. It’s like it’s physically impossible for him not to do everything in his power to keep that smile on Cas’ face.
“Whoa,” Gabe holds his hands up disarmingly. “Cafe owner and all, flirting with the guests is for tips only. No need to feel threatened.”
“I’m not going to lag behind. No worries, old man.”
“Hey, come on, you’re still the only person to ever get a reply from them.”
“Yes,” Cas confirms, still sounding all serious about it.
manage to say it out loud to Cas. “My boyfriend and my Dom. I loved you as both of those, Cas.” It comes out stable and Dean even remembers to word this in the past tense. He nods satisfied. At least something.
“So you’re saying SHIELD got outsmarted by a couple of mooks?” Bucky mocks.
His phone dings several times in rapid succession.
Dean chuckles, but he even he can hear how forced it sounds. “And here I thought you meant pack the food away before my Sasquatch brother arrives. But I guess yeah, the dog is a danger to the food supply as well,” he answers and gets up, making everyone else get up, too.
Dean huffs. “I will, okay. You have it hard enough with having to sleep at all and stuff…”
“Holy moly,” Sam suddenly exclaims. “That can’t be.”
“Ah,” Dean shrugs. “Nothing fancy. My brother’s gonna come over in the morning and we’re gonna have a little Christmas breakfast. Just him, Claire and me. And then we’re gonna drive out to Uncle Bobby’s for dinner and exchange gifts and enjoy Ellen’s eggnog like we do every year. That’s basically it. We drive back the day after and I’m opening the bar as normal on Sunday.”
Cas smiles weakly. “The preferred terms would be asexual and aromantic.”
It takes a moment, a long moment in which Bucky goes over what he’s just said to figure out what Steve wants him to repeat. Then he gets it and his own eyes go wide. “Your mother’s name was Sarah. You used to wear newspapers in your shoes.”
“I…,” Cas rubs his forehead. “You’re right, Dean. I didn’t want to hear it. If only because it would make things easier if you had moved on. Benny would take you back in a heartbeat. Lisa, too.”
“Cas! Hey, Cas!”
Dean nods. “Will do.”
He notices his mistake when Bucky raises his eyebrow in question.
Charlie rolls her eyes. “Help me set up and I’ll let you be Mario. Unless you’d rather be Princess Peach.”
This time, Cas not only grumbles but also opens his eyes. “Stay still,” he grouches. “Too early to move.”
“Yeah. I guess,” he shrugs.
“Why would I do that?” Dean asks, apparently genuinely puzzled.
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas repeats.
God, why is everything so messed up. Dean runs a hand down his face, glad to find no wetness. Crying over spilled milk is not something he does. He just wishes he knew. Whether it was a fluke, a onetime thing. Or whether he actually doesn’t have it in him to kill Cas. He had wanted to kill him during that fight. Had wanted to be rid of him. Of his concern. Of his love. It had all weighed him down, held him back. Kept him sane, he sees that now, but he didn’t back then. Only, he hadn’t killed him. He’d tried to scare him off. And now he was scared that that had worked.
Dean shakes his head. “Only counsel he ever accepted was from Jackie D. ‘s what killed him in the end, too.”
“Because open communication is important?”
“Stand down, counselor,” Dean calms him. “No need to take action yet. So far, all he wants is to talk to Claire.”
“And shit changed, somehow. Like, not that I love him, that hasn’t changed. But like, I see him differently now. And the stuff he told me today…” Dean shakes his head, he doesn’t think he wants to get into any of this with Charlie. “But you know, I think I can help. Like, actually help. Not just -”
He sends a few grateful thoughts in the direction of Missouri, their case worker from CPS, for not being stuck up on appearances. And for giving him a chance. See also: young girl living with a dude who owns a bar.
“Dean?” Fingers are wrapping around his, gentle and strong at the same time, grounding him in the moment where he was drifting away.
“Want some beer?”
Cas shakes his head, suddenly not able to meet Balthazar’s eyes. “He doesn’t even know Gabe exists.”
Dean’s holding the reins, a hand ready to catch him should Cas fall, and Cas just can’t. He can’t do this. It’s too much.
“Rainbow Road is fine,” Dean answers, trying to project a confidence that he doesn’t feel. He remembers Rainbow Road, yeah, but mostly he remembers falling off of it and that was when he was playing video games semi-regularly.
That shuts Cas up. There is of course no possibility whatsoever that he is pregnant. Cas hasn’t had a heat since things have changed between them, and Dean’s not even seeming impatient for that moment to arrive. He has in fact, done nothing but what Missouri has called
one after all. Problem is, he can already see Sam running around the bunker after him making smooching noises, and Dean really doesn’t need that.
, not her lifestyle.”
That produces a low content rumble, as Dean finally relaxes. Cas brings a hand up to cup Dean’s face, letting his fingers glide along the side of Dean’s face. It’s not as smooth now, not with winter being what it is and the effort to heat water for shaving often too much. But Cas doesn’t mind the new growth of hair. Dean is always Dean. He peels his eyes away from Dean’s lips and looks up at him, question in his eyes.
“Possibly,” Dean answers with a sigh. “But wasn’t there something about believing in your abilities yada yada?”
Dean flinches when he notices that he’s been staring at Cas for an indefinite amount of time and apparently has been caught. By Bobby of all people. “Uhh,” he takes another long gulp of his beer. “No?” he hedges.
Ellen’s eyes soften. “I know. But Dean, if you don’t put yourself out there, that’ll always be it. That man is always gonna be the last relationship you’ve ever had.”
“Sam asked her out on a date?” Dean asks, slightly surprised.
Cas gives her a smile, half because he’s happy about her understanding, half because he’s actually a little bit proud of himself for doing this. “It’s been years. I think it’s time. I want to finally be able to face this.”
Immediately, Bobby takes a step back and puts his hands up. "You don't gotta convince me. I can see it." He turns back towards the others and nods in Claire's direction. "She looks happy."
, he apologizes silently to his brother.
“Accepted,” Dean nods because that’s pretty much the only thing he can answer. And because words desert him for the moment, he leans forward and lets his head to drop to Cas’ shoulder before he can talk himself out of it.
“Indeed. We were just looking for… shower curtains,” Steve explains with an open smile that seems just a little bit too much. Dean doesn't trust him. No one can be this all-American and not hide something. Though maybe he’s mostly hiding the skeletons in his boyfriend’s closet. I mean, come on, a metal arm? Dean’s got to do some googling, but he’s reasonably sure that that’s not normal tech.
“Yeah, I should finish my run as well,” Steve agrees. “I’ll see you around?”
“You suck,” he mumbles but he shrinks back against it a little. Just enough that she smirks and backs off.
Code Red
“Okay, guys, I’m going to get my stuff packed. Expect me by tomorrow morning.”
“That’s been a century, dude.”
And it’s not actually that part that Cas isn’t sure about. “You can always command her how to treat me. I’m not sure the same is true about…”
For a heartbeat, Dean is frozen. Then Cas squeezes his fingers.
“We haven’t been young in a very long time.”
The rush calms down shortly after, so Dean starts in on the dishes and clean-up. It still takes until almost 2am before he manages to push the last few stragglers out of the door and into a taxi to bring them home safely. With a relieved sigh, he locks up and cleans the last table, before moving up the stairs to the apartment above the bar.
Charlie and Gabe make some topical small talk while they eat, debating the advantages and disadvantages of changing the system from within. Dean’s too anxious to eat much or to take part in their conversation, so maybe that’s why he hears the pauses in Charlie’s part of the conversation even though no one else comments on them. Of course she doesn’t outright say it, but the longer they talk, the more Dean thinks that Charlie’s way of changing the system from within is not always legal, either.
It makes Dean’s stomach tumble over itself again. Ridiculous. Ridiculous amounts of hope. All because Cas is giving him any attention at all, negative as it may be.
Bucky sighs and shrugs. “It’s fine. We’re going to have to play our parts, so if you’re getting into it, that’s all the better I guess. That Dean is quick with the trigger finger.”
“No, not kinky. I mean, yes, also kinky. But it wasn’t - he didn’t ask for the right reasons and I shouldn’t have complied.”
There’s a redhead leaning against the porch railing of their neighbor’s house, arms crossed in front of her chest, watching him sternly.
“Bet you do. Here, I brought Mario Kart.” She fishes in her messenger bag for the game. “I brought the console, too. I kinda doubt that old man Castiel has ever played a video game in his life.”
“I’m dissing
“Whoa!” Bowser drives clean off the road while Charlie stares at him. “What did you just say?”
“It’s Bobby’s town.”
“And here I always thought spies should be inconspicuous. What’s with all the red hair?” Bucky grumbles and yawns, the tension of the abrupt wake-up already leaving him in light of Natasha’s relaxed stance.
“Please. Why are you not worried when everyone else is?”
Dean groans. That torture is so much more delicious than the slow forward crawl of seconds while he’s waiting for a reply. He lights up his phone again, checking for a new message that isn’t there.
“Ah!” She holds a hand up to stop him. “I need yer name, sweetheart, I don’t need theirs. The less we know of each other, the better.”
“Pie,” Dean interjects.
And that’s the moment when Dean understands a second thing. And that is, that he has to get out of here. That if he stays, it’s only a matter of time until he’ll follow her home. “I need to go to the bathroom,” he says abruptly.
So Cas leans in until lips touch lips, until warmth is shared and breaths mingle. It gives him the funniest feeling in his stomach, as it always does. A bumbling and a buzzing, like his insides are tumbling all over each other. It comes with an urge and a pull to be closer. Cas gives in to it, a little at least, rearranges himself so that he is facing Dean, who unceremoniously pulls him into his lap until their chests are flush against each other, before unhurriedly continuing to kiss.
Jess’ voice has gone soft and careful when she answers. “You know that it’s a common tactic, right? Of abusers, I mean? They are very charming and helpful people, pillars of the community, who would never hurt a fly - unless of course you’re one of the unlucky family members they think they own.”
“None of you has heats,” Cas mumbles into Dean’s shirt. Even the word leaves a bitter taste.
“The bed already has fresh sheets,” Cas continues, though he makes no effort to actually move yet. “I just have to get my blankets from the bedroom.”
“So, what’s the deal with the arm?” Brother slash boyfriend asks when Bucky hands him his glass. It sounds hostile and Steve can’t help but notice that in opposition to Sam, who immediately took a sip of his lemonade, boyfriend guy doesn’t. He gives his significant other a meaningful glance, too, that Steve takes to mean as ‘let’s see whether Sam keels over first before we try this concoction’. His glare gets even harder when his boyfriend doesn’t listen, and instead sniffs at the lemonade, then tries it, and finally downs half his glass in one big gulp.
“Fuck,” he mutters again, the word still being the only one that fits the situation, and goes back to trying to get his legs to cooperate.
Dean shakes his head. He doesn’t remember. Never, he thinks. Not like this, anyway. “I take care of them usually.” It comes out so rough that he hardly recognizes his own voice.

“You weren’t talking about your crush on your car, either, right? Cause dude, I’m not judging anyone for a fetish but I do
Half a minute later, Dean’s phone chimes.
“If it’s that easy, why don’t more people do it?” Sam asks suspiciously.
“What?” Sam seems dumbstruck.
But Dean doesn’t let him finish. Can’t. His body moves before he consciously catches up with it. Cas’ last word comes out with a small surprised
And oh God, Dean had managed to successfully block out that he’s going to have to tell his little brother about this whatever he decides. “No!” It comes out more panicked than he wanted. “No,” he repeats softer. “Not yet. Not until I know what I want to do.” Though
"I know Greek, not Celtic."
"No, the part under that." Layla rolled her eyes. He took another look.
She peered through the peephole. Brown hair and a clean shave wearing a brown jacket over plaid stood in front of her door. She could see the shadow of someone just out of sight. She put a hand on the door and rested her head.
"1956, 1958, 1974," Layla listed. "Only got the name of the second one. Abraham."
"Great." Bobby went to the fridge for a beer. "So, you're a demi-god or something?"
"That is not what I meant."
"Well, we're not your average hunters," Dean said. "We've killed dozens of demons like Lilith and Azaezal. I've been to Hell and back. We don't die easy."
"I'm not going anywhere, Angel," she muttered.
"Something's not right."
"One instance changes nothing."
"Well, this something is going to have to wait." Sam motioned to Layla. "She's needs help."
"Any of them still standing?" Layla asked between bites. Dean gave her a funny look as she scarfed up fries.
Dean gagged. "That's disgusting."
"I wouldn't do that if I were you," he warned. "I could snap you in two."
"We are," Cass agreed.  He sat there for several long moments, eyes going from Dean's face to where his hand had been and back again.  "Humans do tend to get overheated when doing...things. Correct?" Dean could stangley only manage a weak nod. "Well then...maybe…" Hesitantly he slid his hand back to where it had been, causing Dean's breathing to go ragged again.  "It would only be for the sake of survival."
How long had they been asleep? Dean rubbed a palm into his bleary eyes as he looked around, still half out of it. It couldn't have been too long since they had conked out; the windows hadn't frosted over. And besides, Sam was quick on the draw. If they were still out here without help arriving yet then it had only been a few minutes.
"Really?  Because see, you're human now and that means you can get hypothermia and die. We have no blankets, our coats ain't gonna do crap either.  So if you have a better plan I'd love to hear it." Dean knew the only reason Cass wasn't keen on this idea was that he was uncomfortable.  Sharing body warmth with another guy was not a comfortable thing. But Dean would rather be nervous than dead.  And he'd rather Cass live than freeze to death. It was sadly just that simple.
"Fine." Cass growled the statement in annoyance as he crawled over the seat. Dean joined him, taking off his coat as the two men sat close to each other. He wrapped the coat over both of them, the pair staring off into the distance in silence.  This was just odd. Like, really odd. Neither man could look at each other or say a word.  That was until Cass said gruffly, "This is rather awkward."
Cass' words stopped short when he looked back at Dean and the hunter knew why. There was no way Dean could hide the heavy breathing nor the state his body was in.  He should get up and move to the front seat.  Now. He really should.  But yet…
"I am not impotent," Cass replied.  "The...what do you call it...morning wood that I get daily, suggests otherwise." If his eyes weren't already closed he would have been rolling them. Cass was better with the idioms, but just not quite there yet.
The pair fell back into the seat, Dean resting on top of him. Warm skin pressed against warm skin as the pair moaned through their delightful kisses. Dean unconsciously began to grind his hips, which caused Cass to break the kiss as his head fell back with a groan. Both of them were now hard as a rock, their lengths wedged against each other's and their own chests. The more than Dean moved the more their cocks rubbed each other, bringing both of them to a point of loud panting and moaning.  Dean felt fingers dig into his back, nails scraping down his skin.  He hissed, not in pain, but because the pain felt so freaking good. And as those warm hands gripped his rear end all Dean could do was speed up and bury his lips into the man's neck.
"We don't have anything in the trunk to help us keep warm, Cass.  This isn't going to be fun."
"Yeah Cass. I'm aware." Pulling out his cell phone he groaned as he saw it was down to two percent. They were mike's away from the hotel in Georgia, on a deserted stretch if highway, in the middle of a snowstorm. The snow had come out of nowhere so he hadn't been able to go as fast as normal, which means getting back to his phone charger had taken way too long.  Sam was back in Kansas as well.  This was bad.
"Yes…" That was all Dean needed to speed up, their cocks rubbing each other to the brink.  The second that he felt the warmth soak Cass' chest as he roared in delight, Dean joined him. His body stiffened as he snapped harder and harder, his cries practically turning into sobs. The two men slowed down as the wave crested and fell, grinding becoming stuttered and erratic.  Dean fell limp against the warm body underneath him, the pair panting loudly as they tried to catch their breath.
That was enough to stir the sleeping man back to consciousness. He grumbled in his half asleep state and lifted his head to look at Dean in confusion.  But as he woke up enough to realize that his hand was in such a specific place he shot up, looking at Dean in embarrassment.  "I'm...I'm so sorry. I must have fallen asleep and...I'm…"
His hands tightened in the hair that he used to hold that gorgeous head in place, but moments later he growled in frustration as he pushed that hot mouth away from him.  "I'm not gonna last if you keep that up."
“Do you want to come with me?” Dean asks, smile edgy.
“So, is it all Gabe? Or is it the mystery man?” Balthazar asks.
Dean’s not so sure about going into the lion’s den, but Cas seems to have none of his scruples because he smiles at Steve and says, “We’d very much enjoy that, yes. You are very pleasant company.”
The place around the corner turns out to be a nondescript coffee shop, vaguely modern stylish interior, overpriced lattes in too many taste combinations. Balthazar flirts his way through ordering, leaning too close to the barista, who obviously is either used to overbearing customers or knows Balthazar, because he laughs and playfully pushes him instead of getting annoyed like Cas would.
“You don’t have to apologize,” Cas says, softer now. “You don’t have to stop, either. Some days,” Cas swallows heavily before continuing, “some days your prayers were the only thing that kept me going. That stopped me from – you know.”
“Yes, Dean,” Cas repeats, “I’m ‘cool’ with it.” He actually does air quotes.
It sounds like such a small thing. It sounds so harmless. Hands and a mouth on his body. Not even any violence. It shouldn’t be able to make him feel like this.
It gives Dean the courage to answer the other part of the question. “Can’t really give you much info about the actual fight. As I said, I kind of blacked out. There’s a few hazy memories of punches thrown but that’s it.”
“Hells yeah. Guess you can’t know it, seeing how you’re from out of town, but this place is known for being a queer-friendly space. In fact, it’s what made Claire stop here.”
“Or they’re going to mess with us extra because they find it suspicious having an Omega on a horse!”
“You know that I trust your judgement, Chief, but I don’t like this.”
“I can’t.“ It’s out of his mouth before he’s even thought about the offer but his palms are suddenly clammy with cold sweat. “Please. I will come back. But I can’t - I can’t stay. I can’t look at - I will rent a small apartment.“
“Cool.”
Running with Bucky is not the same as running with Sam. For one, Bucky can keep up. For two, Bucky doesn’t only keep up, he runs either next to or half a step ahead of Steve. Which shouldn’t be as distracting as it is.
Cas regards him carefully for a few moments. “Are you sure? People have told me I hog blankets.”
That makes him chuckle again. “I obviously don’t. I never do. Doesn’t usually stop me.”
Cas shrugs. “It's the truth. Also, he’s very cute with his dog. I follow him on twitter just for the photos and videos of him and his dog.”
Cas shakes his head, though his anger is falling in on itself. “I can’t face her. This is different. And besides, I didn’t even make it to the cemetery to visit Gabe. How would I make it to her house?”
“Sure,” Steve smiles.
“Well, I’m glad that you trust my driving skills still after yesterday.”
“Yes, please,” she whispers and drops down heavily on one of their kitchen chairs. She’s still staring at the picture. “Shit. It’s really him, isn’t it?”
“Yeah, I guess.” Dean’s a bit flabbergasted by that revelation.
He chuckles and grabs his stuff to go back to the bedroom.
“Gabriel!”
Missouri's tea with the herbs against the pain. A tea that Missouri has personally fed him every time. Though after the first try, she never gave him the full dose, because the minute he felt like he could move, he’d tried to get up and do some of his tasks again. Missouri had scolded him for risking his health, but Dean hadn't been there and Cas’ body had yearned while his mind tried to cope with the feeling of being rejected by the only Alpha who had ever been good to him, and lying there on his own with nothing but bad memories and the fever to keep him company had seemed too much to bear.
