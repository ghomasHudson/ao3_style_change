“Most people who are cross-trained need to spend at least some time in their classified headspace outside of work.” Steve waited several seconds to see if there were going to be any folllow-up questions. When the only sounds in the room were the noises of several of them chewing, he nodded and sat forward in his chair. “I have some questions now, if that’s okay? Ms. Potts, what does this memo do to the timeline?”
“I’ll do it,” he said, unsure even as he rose to his feet and wiped his eyes if he’d actually be able to manage the task. After a brief, critical glance at Steve, Tony seemed to come to the same conclusion. He shook his head, already in the process of turning on his heel to go do the job himself. Then he stopped and looked back at Steve, something vulnerable and full of a fragile hope Steve hadn’t seen so nakedly clear since before the Civil War.
“He made me swear not to. I think he might have told Steve at least part of it eventually, but he probably made him make the same promise.” Then Rhodey redirected his attention squarely to Tony, shifting his hand from Tony’s hair to his chin to tilt his face upwards. “We lost someone we loved. We wish like hell that he weren’t gone. But we are not trying to use you to fill that void. You
Tony wasn’t down as long as he had been after his first few scenes. He really was starting to level out a bit, his body and mind beginning to trust that they’d be able to go back into headspace soon enough that they didn’t cling to it for all they were worth. Steve had allowed himself to get rather behind on SHIELD projects lately, so even if he would have happily accepted more time caring for his submissive, he didn’t regret the opportunity to focus on his work as much as he might have otherwise.
Somewhere during the middle of this catalogue of  complaints, Tony joined them as well. He kissed Steve, then cast a thoughtful look toward the floor. Steve’s heart began to pound a little faster. Would Tony really choose to be at their feet here, in public? It was the type of thing none of them would have pushed for, but it had been a long week, and the thought of his submissive kneeling for them in front of everyone without shame or fear was a soothing prospect.
“Roughly triple the normal range, yes. From your reaction I’m guessing cortisol still exists in your universe, but I want to spell this out because it should help you understand why were we appalled to learn what Howard had done to our Tony. His heart could have given out from that kind of prolonged stress-response. Cortisol raises blood sugar, so he could have gone into the equivalent of a diabetic coma. His blood pressure, his ability to achieve REM sleep…best case scenario he could have…hell, he
“I neglected to teach you about something pretty important during our lesson earlier. Could I maybe have a do-over?”
“The first thing I should say is that he told me something in confidence, and I won’t be sharing that until he gives me permission to do so.” And if that wasn’t enough to make the intense curiosity that made Phil so good at his job go haywire…but what else could he do but agree?
“You have no idea how lucky you are that you’re wrong.” Then, without giving the other man much time to ponder what he’d said, Steve lunged.
And now, a short vision regarding Sam Wison. This conversation took place during the aftercare that followed Steve and Tony’s first scene.
Eeek! I've been so excited to share this one for ages. If you're confused about how the heck Steve is talking to Tony, there's a pretty big hint way back in chapter 44 of symphony.
And what else was there to say to that, to the promise of forever when such a short time ago hope itself had turned to dust?
The third response deals with feelings of jealousy (all expressed and explored in what I consider to be healthy and safe ways, but they're still there and very real.) The person experiencing the jealousy also feels a lot of guilt about them and requests a punishment for them, which is denied.
Tony outlined the whole harebrained scheme, the dating and the subbing lessons and how they intended to try to keep things separate. He didn’t mention the kneeling, or the…whatever had happened with Bruce the other day, but Rhodey had always been good at reading into the edges of Tony’s pauses; he got as much from silences as he did from Tony's most rambling sentences, and if anything the emphasis on communication in this universe only seemed to heighten that particular superpower. Before he got himself (or Bruce, because he had a feeling Rhodey would not be pleased about how that whole thing had initially gone down) in trouble, Tony switched gears.
The first time he'd whipped around to glare at the man but had only smirked at him in return. The few times after that Anthony made sure to not give the man the satisfaction of a response.
He was sitting in his ruined garden, crying unto his withered flowers when the werewolf boy, Remus, found him. The young man smiled at him, gently wiped his tears away and took his hand.
SI would weather the storm alright, just a drop in stock prices but nothing that they hadn't ridden out and recovered from before. They had enough of his plans and tech in the archives that would carry them for the next ten years.
It took two days in the library  microfilm archives to find some information on his quarry. Back in 1976, there was a fire in the apartment and two young men had died. The older one, a nineteen year old Solo Maxwell had been burned to death while the younger, seventeen year old Duo; had died of smoke inhalation. It was reported that he'd been trying to rescue his older brother when he'd succumbed.
Draco kept his head down, letting his mother handle her irate husband. Unlike Lucius, he had no aspirations to have been part of the elite War Eclipse. For him, the terror and danger of being a member of the battle corps outweighed the supposed the fame and fortune that came with it.
As Scott shrunk back and glanced timidly as his alpha, Stiles turned his cold gaze back to her. "Are you done wasting our time now, Talia?" He drew out her name, the open mocking in his voice making her wolves bristle with anger. Not that he gave a fuck what they felt towards him anyway.
Anthony curled his lip, his brown eyes sparking with anger. It had all been a test, a trap set by the rebels to set him off balance, to observe how he responded to the sight of his soldier ripped apart and destroyed. He gestured sharply at the whole tableau, as if saying 'satisfied?'
"Recent epiphany was it?" Derek leant toward the mirror, adjusting the ears on his head. "Liking cock more than pussy?"
He caught glimpses of the iron legion, their metallic bodies gleaming in the fire light as they sprayed the flames with fire suppressant. It was slow going, with how much the fire had spread but at least the human fire officers were able to back off from the more dangerous points.
Hands reached for the collar, flicking it up against the rain and Tony looked up into clear grey eyes. Pride looked like he wanted to say something but one of his agents hailed him so he guided Tony into a sheltered doorway and, with an admonition not to move from the spot, went back to the crime scene.
But that was talk for the future. In this moment he had a different goal. Working Rodney's body and pulling pleasure from him until he was boneless, blissed out and at peace within his ever turning brain. As his lover shuddered through what would be the first of many orgasms that night, Ronon could swear he could hear Rodney's comm bleating weakly.
Then of course there was Potter with his new Dragon Moth, which  despite being one of the most powerful breeds ever and a formidable fighter, much like the dragon it was named for; looked incredibly dull and ugly with its muted colours and bulky form.
That night the little crooked house burned, with its little crooked fence and overgrown garden. The bottles of herbs and dried flowers cracked and melted, the old clay pots crumbled. The broken broom stick crackled and turned to ash while the black cloak and crooked little hat shriveled.
The border lands were a long stretch of nothingness, flat arid land where nothing grew and the heavy clouds belched up lightning and caustic rain that fell almost constantly.
Stiles was alive, safe and in his arms. He was happy. His wolf was happy. The pale moonlight painted the room stunning silver.
Once he had his lover warm, dry and sated, he lifted his lover by the hips and lowered him inch by inch unto his hard cock. Rodney keened against him, grasping at his shoulders and back as they were so intimately joined. With the steady pour of the rain outside their windows, the warmth of the heater, the soft touch of the nest and the wet, sucking heat of Rodney around him, Ronon knew true happiness.
Stiles gaped for a moment. “Yeah. Cora never said anything about that. What have you done? Have I read your stuff?”
It had taken a week of sleeping like the dead and crying in the shower before he’d traced a path back to the spot. From there he could see almost the whole valley and a large swath of uninterrupted starry sky. It was peaceful, it was beautiful and most importantly, it was quiet. No werewolf drama, no teen drama, no family drama, no fucking drama at all.
He was fine though, having lived with her in their little crooked cottage with its wild garden and crooked fence since he was ten. It hadn't always been his dream to be the Witch of the Woods but life was what happened when you were making other plans.
Tony hadn't spoken another word as he threw the garbage bags full of clothes into the junker T'Challa deigned to lend him, and drove off without a look back. He was just about to wail the last strains of the classic song when the piece of shit car started making weird scraping noises.
Derek frowned and shook his head. “I can almost see that look on your face.” He jabbed a finger at where Stiles’ face was. “Yes. That look. That research boner look. You know the one. Stop it now.”
He sighed, then frowned, a bit angry at himself for all the sighing he’d been doing lately. His fingertips found his rings and twisted them around and around his finger absently.
“Aw shit, I’m sorry. Here I am pouring out all my troubles on a beautiful stranger when all you did was offer me a drink.”  He ran his hand through his hair, messing up the careful hairstyle Natasha had combed for him. “You must think I’m the worst kind of loser. It’s ok, i don't mind. I’ve been called worse.”
Then he would make the trip down dirt side to visit one of his friends and spend some time soaking up all the planet had to offer. Quatre would welcome him with open arms, letting him sleep his jet lag off in a nice big bed, before stuffing him full of food and taking him to visit the Maguanacs at their coastal base.
And with those disquieting words, he melted back into the dark of the tunnel and disappeared on silent feet; leaving Anthony standing alone and strangely cold, surrounded on all sides by his enemies.
It had started as sex, soon after they'd turned chunin, stress relief with people not their own team mates. Shika's team was too close, Kiba's team had been scattered to the winds on solo missions and Naruto's team…. well, Naruto's team was a fucking disaster.
“Your will be done?” A voice hissed from his side as the redhead stalked up to him, her eyes dark with rage.  “Your will? Who are you?”
There was a sharp intake of breath from the beautiful stranger. A warm and solid hand cupped his elbow. “What’s on that mind of yours soldier? It’s not just the drink is it?”
"What I hide… is forbidden to be heard, the knowledge that no one is to know other than a few. Not even with the Avengers…" Steven said glancing at Steve who was clenching his fists tightly at what he heard, and then he starts walking to the door with fast footsteps, ignoring Tony when he touched his hand gently, which made Steven scowl and call out to him. "What are you planning to do? Drag the first agent you see to beat the answers out of them? Stop being an idiot and stand down soldier." Steven said which made Steve growl and turn around power walked to Steven.
"I… d-didn't, mean it, Papa!" Peter sniffed as he tried to wipe his nose with his sleeve, only to be stopped by Steve who took a tissue from the bedside table and wipes the boy's nose. "T-the room wasn't locked… Lila and Copper… they wanted to see the room, I told them, no, but they said that Tony used to let them in that room when they were little, and then… and then the puppy ran inside and we couldn't stop it! I'm sorry!" Peter let out a few sobs as he hides his face in his father's chest, which made the man give a tired sigh at that.
"The Omega and his pup…" Nattalegg said which made blond Omega purse his lips and stop cleaning his bow, looking at the Alpha with the red hair, a while of silence passed between the two of them with the two gazing at each other's eyes having a silent conversation before Klint sighed to himself.
Even Morgan seemed to sense something was off for her cries turned into quite whimpers as they both heard the closet door slam opened, followed by screaming and cursing and the sound of fighting. Tony could only huddle with Morgan away from the hidden door, tears running down Tony's face as he prayed over and over for a miracle or something; he can't believe this, he can't believe this madness, not only did Tony met Steven Grant Rogers in the flesh but it looked like Tony and Morgan were the reason for his death, what's going on for heaven's sake?!
At the mention of his father the pup fidgets in Tony's lap which made the Omega's heart nearly stop as scenario after scenario flashed through the Omega's mind, from the Alpha abusing the pup that he ran away, to the Alpha not even knowing the pup was not home. "Papa… 's at… work." The pup said which made Tony's lips press into a thin line and he raised the pup's face to look in his eyes.
"What is the catch?" Anton stated with a resigned voice, already knowing that there was no fighting the elders when they made their orders known, especially if 'Fury of the Seven Seas' decided to stick his nose in Anton's business, and Jamti knew that Fury had returned from his voyage a week ago to do just that, but at least Fury was the only reason that Anton was given the chance to choose the person who Anton will share his life and wealth with.
It ends with the Omega and pup falling asleep on Steve. The Alpha looked up at the ceiling humming to himself, the pup was snuggling to his chest, while the Omega was hiding his face in Steve's neck, soft puffs of air was tickling Steve making the Alpha stop himself from squirming last he woke the two up, even though his legs had fallen asleep because of the companied weight of the Omega and his child, he didn't dare to move, he just looked up when the door was opened nodding his head when he saw Jarvis entering the room.
"Who is your leader?!" Johann's roars left unanswered, as all the Vikings looked at the king with a thirst for blood, and the things that Steven heard, made him raise his head in alarm. "Bring him here at this moment!" Steven released a shuddering breath, looking around towards their visitors and hides his son's head in his breast, covering his ears as he saw them regard Johann with raised brows or blank stares, and then completely ignored him while turning their eyes to him and his son.
Sneakily, or as sneakily as the two babes thought they were, the two of them entered the workshops and tiptoed around the place, making Anton snort and shake his head before turning around, making the two boys squeak and gaze at him with wide eyes, looking like two dears who got caught by a hunter. "So… why did you think that entering my workshop is a good idea?" Anton asked, raising his brow as he gazed at the two boys, old enough to be edified as Alphas, but too young to have their first rut.
"I always bath when a foul scent rub on me." Steven said as he looked forward, eyes not looking at Johann's face that became red with anger. Steven raised his hand to touch his throubing cheek, the sound of the slap made James whine and clutch his mother's dress, hiding his face in his mother's skirt when Johann looked at him. Whatever foul words Johann wanted to say, he was cut by the screams and shouts coming from the outside, the cries became louder making Steven tense when he understood the words, which were screamed in terror…
On his way back home, he saw Pepper and his mother, the two of them with tears in their eyes, his mother held him tightly when he reached them, it ends up with Tony thinking and thinking, turning to look at Barnes who was surrounded by his family, his father, mother, and sister as they hold him crying on his shoulder. "Hey, Barnes…" Tony called out which made the Alpha turn to him. "I expect to see you in a week, I promised you an arm, and I always keep my promises." He said which made the other Alpha laughed at that and nods his head… Tony tried not to feel like trash for not telling Barnes that he was the Carbonell he talked about.
Holding his breath, Tony bite his bottom lip to stop the smile that was going to take over his face and gazed at Steve whose eyes fluttered opened as he gazed around the room in a daze until his eyes settled on Tony and a huge smile taking over Steve's face. "This is the first time I have slept through the night…" Steve whispered inching closer to Tony, causing his breath to hitch. "You look more beautiful in the morning, do you know that?" Steve murmured, his lips leaving a butterfly trail of kisses, causing Tony's breath to hitch.
The Omega acted like he was still unconscious as he cut in the robs bending his hands, his heart hurting painfully as his son's whines of fear and pain, the Omega bite his bottom lips in deep thoughts wondering if he should attack the man now, but his boy's whimpers made him tense and let out a sigh, deciding to act alone in hope of knowing what the man wanted. "Shush, baby, everything is going to be alright… Mommy is going to get you out of here just calm down baby…" Steve whispered to his pup as he sat, with his hands behind him, leaning a little on the small boy who let out a sob and hid in Steve's arms.
Steve drew his hands over Tony's chest and sides, tweaking the Omega's nipple. His right hand found Tony's shaft and grasped it. Stroking up and down and rubbing through the wetness at the tip and collecting it on his hand, swallowing every pleasured sound Tony made with a kiss. Meanwhile, his left hand stroked lower and found the Omega's hole. Tony was slick and Steve carefully inserted a finger, feeling Tony tense against him.
"I'm back!" Tony called out as he closed the door behind him, the sound of Peter squealing in delight as he ran toward the Omega made Tony smile and lower himself to the ground, holding the pup tightly in his embrace when the boy was within his arms reach, which caused the boy to purr happily and snuggle into Tony's neck, letting out a purr in delight, which made the weight on Tony's back vanish. "How was your day, bambino?" Tony asked as he had to force himself to let go of Peter and stand up, smiling at the pup when the boy starts chattering immediately about his day as he pulled Tony toward the dining room.
"What do you mean, dear?" Serpentine asked, floating near Tony trying to look at his face, something that Tony didn't pay any mind as he took another bite of his ice cream, trying to ignore the heavy feeling in his chest. "What do you mean by those words dear? They describe my husband well, but the way you said them, stated something else." Serpentine hummed as she took Tony in before letting out a sigh and put her ice-cream tub down. "When I met Joseph, I was a fugitive who ran away from home because Mama, hated that I was fascinated with Normal People," Serpentine stated, looking at her nails that suddenly were like claws, making Tony gulp and eye them with fear. "He refused to love me if I wasn't normal like him; the forties were such a dreadful time to be an Addams; I did in the end, I tried to change who I was for him, and I suffered for three years because of that until I finally got fed up with him and killed him before he decided to target my baby next… trust me, darling, if you had told Steve to be normal for you, or accept his proposal of becoming normal… I wouldn't have let you live even if Steve begged me to let you go. Stevie spoke highly of you though, about how you kick him out when you saw what he decided to become for you." Serpentine stated, her eyes twinkling darkly, taking Tony in with equal approval and hunger for blood, something that made Tony shift in his place and swallow.
Tony dozed fitfully, too agitated to fall into a deep sleep, too exhausted to try and make himself more comfortable, thinking that the reason was that Tony used to stay with Peggy and her husband, as their house always has some movement going on in it, and not this quietness that made Tony feel cold. When Tony slept, he dreamed. He dreamed of running along the roads lined with tall trees fear seizing his heart as he heard Stane and his father getting closer to him, he dreamed of bright-eyed shapes moving between the branches closing on him nearly trapping him when he tripped. He dreamed of still water, black in the moonlight, the surface mirror-flat, though there is movement in the depths, a flash of something pale among the reeds, and when Tony tried to focus on the shape, he let out a terrified scream when he saw a body of a small baby floating in the lake.
"I will kill him, that's it; I will finally do what I have dreamed of for years and kill him!" Natasha hissed, huffing and buffing until Steve sends her a teary look, begging her silently to stop because then he will start crying for real. Natasha, God bless her; realize how close Steve was to a meltdown, and calmed down, giving Steve a loving and supportive smile. "Now, let's ignore that good for nothing Alpha, which I told you not to marry. Let's talk about something more cheerful; like that hunk of a brother he has…" Natasha wiggled her eyebrows as she said those words, causing Steve to snort and give a weak laugh.
He waited a month for the old woman to return, going through the motions of collecting swamp toad bile,  harvesting the young bulb root of the myrtle blossom and curating the large collection of jars and bottles that she demanded by kept clean and organized.
Xander could only nod eagerly, snatching up the matching nightgown as they went. Oh yeah, scratch another one off the bucket list.
He woke up with a warm hand on his ass and stubble burn on his inner thighs. His ass and back ached in that good, toe curling way and he smiled against the shoulder his face was smoshed against. He lay there in the pale early light of morning, snug against a warm, firm body and felt like he'd finally found a place where he truly belonged.
“You look a little nervous. Let me buy you a drink gorgeous.” A warm, deep voice said from his right elbow. A hand wearing an expensive looking red and gold watch slapped a thick money clip down unto the bar. “Bar keep, another one of whatever my friend just had, thanks.”
Like the way he knew in his heart that if he opened his mouth to speak, he would start screaming and wouldn’t stop. There were no smart ass quips, no snippy sarcastic come backs. No one to circumvent the mindless terror that still reverberated through his very soul.
“Rude.” Stiles pouted, flopping sideways unto the back of the couch. He hooked one arm over the back and pulled one leg up. “I will have you know that it’s my research boner as you call it that allows me to be my own boss these days. People pay a pretty penny for information these days.”
"Damn right." Tony chuckled, rubbing his cheek against the ritualistic scars along his lover's back. "Especially when since I get my returns in both financial and flesh equity around here."
Tony enclosed his fist around himself closing his eyes and gave a good long stroke up, the leather slid along his skin smoothly. He worked up to a steady rhythm not too fast to get off, but enough to satisfy and prolong the pleasure. His cock throbbed with need for more, but Steve wouldn't be too hasty he'd take his time and draw it out maybe make Tony beg a little. Yeah, he'd like that.
Steve looked down at himself, his pants tenting from his raging erection. He had gone from partial hard-on to full mast as soon as he had caught scent of Tony in the room with him. The blonde hit his hand against the door in frustration. He was better than this, he wasn't like those other power alphas. He wasn't about dominating his mate, or taking one against their will, but now he knew that had to be the case.
Once Bruce had left Steve for the day he laid back on the bed and stared at the ceiling while his mind raced over the complications of his predicament. It was uneasy to be in quarantine since he was always watched and monitored there was a constant state of unease. He was looking forward to having actually alone time to process what had happened. Since he discovered his recent problem when thinking back on it.
Tony's hands were on Steve's hips, his fingers were digging hard into his skin with effort to keep himself still. Steve flexed, clenching tightly around Tony's encased cock , and causing him to curse softly under his breath.
“I know you can Tony, you are always so good Tony. I can feel how wet you are, I got you close. Hm you are so tight, so wet, god Tony.” Steve praised as he thrust into him. Tony gasped and his body grew tense he felt Steve still, and the warmth of his come flooding him. That sent Tony over and he too felt the explosive orgasm rock through his body. Steve was panting hard as he settled the two of them onto their sides careful to ensure Tony was comfortable as his knot swelled within him. Steve held Tony kissing and whispering sweet loving things into his ear as they came down from the endorphin high.
went unsaid. They didn't say anything more Tony just lifted his head and planted a kiss on Steve's cheek before he settled back down into the soft pillows. Steve pulled a blanket up over the two of them and they cuddled together safe and warm the arc reactor's light glowing between them.
“H-Harder Tony...please!” Steve begged and Tony obliged willingly. He rocked his hips back and forced them forward roughly into Steve. Tony groaned with every thrust, how wonderfully his cock slid in and out of Steve's clenching asshole. “So good, ah-ah so good!” Steve chanted. Tony felt Steve's body tense under him, his cock was being squeezed as Steve's muscles clenched up around him. Steve was thrusting his hips uselessly in the air as his cock pulsed with fresh streams of come. It splattered across his chest, on the floor and Steve moaned filthily as the pleasure rolled through his body. The rhythmic clenching and releasing around his shaft was enough to push Tony over the edge, and reach his own orgasm.
-A week later Tony received a package in the mail from Steve Rogers with a flip phone and an apology letter.-
The first time Tony saw Steve in the stealth suit he had a momentary existential crises. The lines of the suit, the way it hugged and framed every portion of Steve's sculpted body. The emphasis of his shoulders that tapered into his narrow waist, and defined the shape of his supple perfect ass. It was devoid of the (in Tony's opinion) obnoxious red and white stripes, instead it was all a single dark navy blue, and the star emblazoned across his chest silver with three horizontal lines across the chest. The stitching along the heavy fabric, obviously tactical in function for the body armor but aesthetically pleasing to look at. Paired with the uniform was a handsomely fitted leather belt, a crisscrossing harness to hold the Shield, and a pair of matching finger-less gloves.
Steve's gaze was met with a pair of the most enticingly beautiful brown eyes he had ever seen. Warm pools of rich chocolate framed by dark long lashes and lids lined with charcoal black. Doe eyes were all he could think. For a split second Steve had wondered if there had been a mistake, as he had never known a man to possess such a breathtakingly gorgeous set of eyes. Once he shook himself from his momentary lapse of speechlessness Steve took in the rest of the view before him.
Tony kissed Steve deeply, raking his nails down his back. It was all so intense Steve above him driving into him stretching him, Tony clutched onto him tightly. He had to say it, this wasn't a damn game it never had been "We aren't strangers! I know you Steve! god yeah you feel so good!" Tony kissed him again in desperation.
“That's good.” Steve slotted his lips with Tony's in a deep kiss, both of them moaning into it as their passion grew. “That's very good.” Steve breathed and he reached down for Tony's belt. Steve unfastened it with quick hands and worked his pants open and pushed them down Tony's thighs almost hastily. Tony lifted his hips up and kicked the offending clothing off, and letting them drop over the edge of the bed. Steve splayed his hands over Tony's abdomen, tracing the tips of his fingers along the band of his boxers. He could clearly see the outline of Tony's cock, and the wet spot forming from the young man's leaking tip. Steve took a moment to breath and gain his bearings on the situation. He himself was painfully hard and he wanted nothing more than to take and pleasure Tony all night, but he was the adult here he had to be certain he wasn't taking advantage. Steve's better sense was finally overpowering his lust addled brain.
Tony came, his hips rocking with the pulses from his cock spilling messily onto his stomach and over his hand, the last few spurts dribbling down over the leather glove. With a heaving breath Tony relaxed letting his legs fall back to the bed and let the post orgasm afterglow settle over himself. It was short lived however once the reality set in and Tony had to face what it was he had done. Not only had he been masturbating again to thoughts of Steve, his team-mate, Captain, his friend but had stolen the man's gloves and used them as an extra prop for his sick fantasies.
“See? Now you are getting where I was getting with it. Those models can be so full of themselves.” Sam stood up from the table to return to his duties. “Good luck with it and let me see how it turns out when you're finished.”
“So close” Tony was panting and thrusting his hips, forcing his cock into Steve's hot, wet mouth. Steve held firmly at the base and began to stroke, short and quick movements of his wrist as he bobbed his head faster focusing more attention on the head. Tony's cock felt rigid and hot in his hand, throbbing with growing need. Tony was so close he could feel it, he was so ready to reach that explosive edge. “Oh-oh God! Oh fuck Steve!”
“I'm not avoiding. I've just been busy.” Tony replied dismissively. Okay that was actually a lie, Tony had been avoiding, but for good reason. His body had grown to be very responsive to Steve's alpha aura, and he had to get himself under control before he dared face him again.
“Okay.” Steve replied and gave Tony a hard demanding kiss. “Okay.” They continued to kiss and just feel over each other, cataloging everything about each other. Tony ran his fingers through Steve's hair, carding them through the locks and over his beard. The look really did suit him. Steve turned his head and kissed at the palm of the prosthetic, he loosely closed his own hand around the wrist and stroked his thumb over the shiny red metal. Tony stroked over Steve's cheek and then traced a single digit across Steve's lower lip, the readings supplied him with the sensation of the wetness, and the warmth. Steve closed his lips over the tip, stroking his tongue over the finger joints, and sucked it deeper into his mouth.
“Okay.” Tony agreed and let his body go pliant while Steve ever so slowly pushed the single digit into him. Tony tensed up involuntarily and Steve soothed him back into a relaxed state with light kisses and whispered encouragements.
Steve felt Tony's fingers tangle into his short hair, petting through the blonde locks and scraping his nails along his scalp. Humming in response Steve closed his eyes to better enjoy the sensations for a moment. There was a brief tug and Steve opened his eyes to look up at Tony, panting and tense with need. Steve massaged Tony's hips briefly before moving his hands to cup and grope the soft globes of Tony's ass, while he leaned in and licked the head of Tony's cock. He ran his tongue around it, tasting the salty precome before taking the sensitive tip into his mouth and gave a suck earning him a stifled moan from Tony. There was the tightening of Tony's grip in his hair and it only encourage him to go further, Steve took more of Tony's aching length into his mouth.
“Trust me.” Steve replied and with a gentle nudge to Tony's hip he coaxed him to turn onto his back so Tony could face him. Steve crawled over him, holding his weight up on his arms and leaned down to kiss Tony's lips. While making out Steve re-positioned himself and thrust his length back into the loose and slick entrance. They both grunted softly, and Tony managed to hide the wince. Tony drew his legs up and wrapped them around Steve's middle changing the angle just enough for Steve's cock to graze his prostate.
Tony reached down to take Steve's length, his penis hot and velvety in his rough hands. Tony gave him a long stroke and Steve bit his lip as his hips bucked forward into the touch, “Ah-Tony!” Steve moaned and he bracketed his arms on either side of the brunette below him. “I-I want to...to feel you.” Steve gasped and reached for Tony's pants. Tony wasted little time, assisting in the removal of his own clothing to reveal himself fully to Steve. Caching his lips in his own once more, Steve kissed Tony full of heat and passion as he rutted against him.
“Oh-Oh fuck, oh fuck oh fuck!” Tony chanted as his entire body quivered, his cock spilled over Steve's fist and abdomen as the orgasm rippled through him. Tony tensed up, full body everything tight and clenching and Steve came again too. Tony sagged down, using his hands to keep himself upright but his shoulders and head dropped as he let the wave of post coital bliss just wash over him. Steve sat up and gathered Tony in his arms and kissed him sweetly. They remained like that for a time, just lazily kissing and coming down from the endorphin high.
the filthy noises echoed throughout the lab as Steve bucked his hips, rubbing his cock into the tight heat of the centipede's enclosed spindly legs, stroking along the soft belly so wonderfully. Its own stiff length driving into his hole, Steve clenching around it greedily wanting more.
Steve watched her and waited for her to strike first. “I don't know if I can fix it that's the problem. Tony refuses to stay in a room long enough to let me talk to him.” Natasha made her move and Steve blocked her arm, she came in instantly with another and he deflected that, but Natasha countered with a swift kick to his stomach. Steve stumbled back and caught himself. He hadn't had his stance right.
“You like it when I call you that? Look at you, the all American golden boy getting railed by playboy Tony Stark. Getting it on with a fucking mutant sex bug.” Tony laughed at the audacity of their situation, but it didn't change how hot he found it, all the previous misgivings were completely gone. Damn that pollen was powerful stuff.
Tony stood and gazed out the window at the city below him. It was late the sun had gone down hours ago and a soft patter of rain sprinkled across the valley. There were a few flashes of lightning in the distance. From here was easy to pretend that everything was normal. The world was still moving, people living, and the mass amount of death had never occurred. It was a pleasant fantasy, but always short lived. Tony heard movement behind him and he turned expecting it to be Rhodey or Shuri, perhaps Bruce or Thor...he hadn't expected Steve Rogers, Tony's guard went up immediately.
“...no fucking way...are you really?” Tony mumbled into the pillow and looked over his shoulder at Steve. The blonde was still catching his breath, his mouth hanging open, body tense, and his cock still rock hard and buried inside of Tony. “How?”
“I can't reach an orgasm!” Steve clarified with a huff of irritation. What did he have to do spell it out? “Ejaculate, jizz, whatever you wanna call it I can't get there! That's my problem because I can't stop thinking about what happened, and not in the I am so horrified way, no in the...the...depraved and wrong way.” Steve heaved, spilling everything. This was it. He was done. “I'm sick, there is something horribly wrong with me and I cannot fix it. I would think about it and become aroused and I thought maybe it was a side affect. If I got it out of my system I would be okay, but I can't get it out of my system. This is like the worst case of fucking blue-balls and I don't know what to do!”
Tony closed his eyes, groaning loudly as his body tensed up, he arched his back up, chanting Steve's name as he came, pulsing waves of pleasure flowed through him. His muscles clenching down around Steve tightly Tony sank back against the bed, panting heavily. His skin was covered in a light sheen of sweat, covered in his own come, some of it on Steve's chest. That was all Steve needed for Tony to send him over the edge, watching him come, and the way Tony's body clenched and squeezed his cock. Steve moaned Tony's name as he came, riding the wave, and nearly collapsing onto his chest, but he caught himself on his forearms.
“Yes you can, we'll keep it confidential no one has to know. Whoever you need to tell.” Tony's voice was soft and almost pleading. Steve had never seen this side of him before. Was he that concerned for Steve's well-being? Did he see this as his fault and now was desperately trying to find a fix? He knew then he had to tell Tony that it wasn't what he thought, he wasn't the problem exactly. It was so much more complicated than that. Maybe if he opened up to the one other person that had been there with him it wouldn't be quite as bad. Still he was prepare for Tony to pull away from him, repulsed by him.
Tony felt his body tensing, he was getting close. "I will baby, I will, I'm so close." Tony kissed him. "yes right there!" Tony moaned while he reached down, and began to furiously stroke himself. Steve changed the angle of his thrusts so he hit Tony's prostate repeatedly.
“I've been fingered before Steve. I know what to expect.” Tony breathed out and tried to let his body go loose as Steve gently circled the pad of a finger around his entrance.
“You want to take this to the bedroom? Might be a little more comfortable there. Do this proper and all.” Steve nodded and peppered small kisses down Tony's neck while pushing the blazer off his shoulders. Tony chuckled as his hands reached for Steve's wrists and ever so gently pushed him back. “I know you're feeling eager but we have plenty of time. Come on to the bedroom soldier.”
Steve froze after his last punch and settled his hands on the bag in front of him. He set his forehead against the leather and sighed. Why? Why was the universe torturing him further?
“You do whatever you want with it. Either alone or...if you would like me to be with you and monitor you I can do that too. I realize you are in a difficult position, desperation can lead people to act in ways they may otherwise never have before.”
The first time Tony realized he may not be the only one with a problem. He bumped into Steve in the early morning which wasn't typical for Tony to be heading to his workshop at that particular time. He had a difficult time sleeping and had decided it was best to get an early start on his latest project before he had to get cleaned up for his board meeting later. The odd thing was Steve had been in Tony's workshop. Tony walked in and Steve jumped dropping something to the workbench and he spun around with a blush forming on his cheeks.
Steve smiled pleasantly though and nodded. "Sure, Tony I would really like that." He took a long drink to finish off his first round, and set the empty glass down. "You aren't bothering me. I wasn't expecting company, but I don't mind it. Unexpected but I wouldn't say unwelcome.” Tony got the bartender's attention and ordered Steve another of what he had  before. The glass was set on the table, and as the bartender walked away Tony added to the conversation.
Steve shut his book and set it down on the coffee table. “Is this another coffee run Jarvis? Or is Tony having another craving for gummy bears.” Since Tony's hiatus in the workshop he had often used Jarvis to contact certain Avengers with small requests for items.
“Mmm.” Steve hummed and pulled back with a wet pop. His fingers still teasing over Tony's leaking ass. “You get so wet for me Tony. I love you like this...so natural.” Steve praised between fervent kisses to Tony's member. It hadn't always been like this, it hadn't always been easy. It had been a long and bumpy road to get Tony to this level of comfort and acceptance of himself. Not now though, now Tony was wet and open and he wasn't resisting.
“No worries Steve. I figured you could do with some better company than Bruce. Not that I don't love his company personally, but he also gets my jokes and we can talk for hours on the merits of molecular fusion. I lost you there didn't I?” he chuckled. “We'll have you out of here soon and then we can put this all behind us.”
“Ooohh.” Steve let out a long moan as the pulsing waves of pleasure crashed into him. The centipede wriggled out from between Steve's legs and circled around him as he remained on his hands and knees, catching his breath. It seemed to be studying him, watching intently for his next action before it moved in on him again.
Steve sighed again and absent absentmindedly stroked his fingers along Tony's arm. “You need to understand Tony, no one will blame you, but if anyone finds out about this? about us being intimate with each other? I could face some very unfortunate consequences. Howard would surely find some legal way to keep me away from you. Two fellas together isn't exactly well accepted. I mean it's better from when I was a kid, but I don't want you to face any of that.”
“Tony?” Steve asked hesitantly as he walked in and stood before the engineer. He stuck his hands in his pants pockets feeling awkward and nervous.
They kissed for several minutes, exploring long kisses full of tongue and gentle nips with soft moans and breathy gasps. Steve shifted slightly on the bed and tried to calm down his over active libido. “How about we get some sleep.” Steve suggested as he nestled down into the blankets and pillows on the bed.
"You could say that. Why care to try me?" Steve asked with a challenging look, that's right two could play the game here.
“Fuck! Steve there! Right there again!” Steve took a moment to reposition and he found a good rhythm, their bodies rocking together. In response Tony arched his back and cried out with every snap of Steve's hips, driving his hard length deep into him. Tony dragged his nails down Steve's sweaty back, leaving deep marks against his fair skin while panting and groaning. Steve bent down to crash their lips together in a messy kiss as he pounded into Tony's tight ass, the brunette keening in response. The tight coil of heat spread in Steve's groin, he was close to shooting his load. “Steve.” Tony gasped. “I want...I want to try...hold on okay?” Steve stopped and felt a twinge of panic.
Tony panted, getting a hand between them and palming the front of Steve's pants. "Yeah you like that? I promised to show you a good time. I'll give you a good time." Tony whispered, his voice low and husky in Steve's ear.
Steve met Tony's eyes with his own and gave a small shake of his head. “At this point...no I don't think we're friends.” Steve then reached his hand over, settled over the top of Tony's hand, and stroked his thumb tenderly over Tony's skin. “This is more than that, and I'm willing to see where this goes if you are.” He admitted.
Tony practically collapsed onto the bed then, breathing heavily and Steve still behind him. Not wanting to crush the much smaller young man Steve caught himself before he too fell onto the bed. He pulled out from Tony with a soft grunt and pulled the condom off himself, tied it and tossed it into the nearby trash bin. Steve then laid back against the bed and let himself drift in the afterglow of the post orgasm haze with Tony beside him. “Come here.” Steve reached a hand out and rubbed his palm over Tony's back. Tony pulled himself up with a slight wince and laid himself nearly on top of Steve's solid body. An arm around his waist and his head resting against Steve's shoulder.
"Oh, God…" Tony's voice cracked as he said those two words, hiding his face in the Alpha's chest, hiding the tears away from the man, and he was thankful that Steve didn't mention the wet spot that started growing on his shirt. He could already imagine how the four years old Peter might have been terrified, crying out and thrashing as he called out for Steve to save him.
The man was silent, never talking, only blinking and looking around the place without a real interest, which made the Omega wonder if it was something that he did, or if that the Alpha was disappointed that Tony wasn't here to escort him around, the Alpha just shuffled around and followed Steve when the Omega directs him to the guest room that Tony has prepared for him, he left the Alpha to refresh after that while promising that dinner will be prepared soon, which gained him nothing but silence in return…
"No funny business, Rogers, or you are going to regret it." Tony hissed in a low voice, putting his hands on Peter's ears in hope of him not hearing his threat, which the pup didn't seem to hear, and that made the Omega relax a little.
God, his husband looked handsome in the morning, with all the sharp lines relaxed and the sun falling on him from the window, giving him a golden halo. His husband; a word that Tony will never get tired of saying, a word that every time Tony thought of, he had to stop himself from squealing like five years old.
"Does that mean I'm three-quarters American one-quarter Italian? Gwen and Harry will be so jealous!" Peter said which made Steve give a small laugh at that as he shook his head a little.
Tony couldn't help but whimper at the soft lips and gentle hands that set to take him apart, claiming him with every gentle kiss and soft caress. "Please, don't leave me waiting anymore…" Tony whimpered, deepen his voice a little as he tried to intimate Steve, who was still worshiping his body without stopping, even after taking his suit off, leaving him in nothing.
"We should tell the kids…" Tony mumbled, stretching his body over Steve, purring when his Alpha started running one of his hands over his back. "We also need to go to my doctor; Dr. Cho would probably rip my ears off for not contacting her for a long time." A smile crossed over Tony's face when he heard his Alpha chuckle softly at his dilemma.
"No!" Morgan giggled, snuggling happily into Tony's chest, happy laughter leaving her now and then as she seemed to try and control herself. "Mama!" Tony let out a confused noise at the word that left his baby's mouth; for he was sure he never repeated that word in front of Morgan. "Mama!" Morgan chirrup, pointing at Tony with a huge smile taking over her face, before turning around and calling 'Papa!' when her eyes fell on the lake.
Steven looked at his younger self with a cold and unimpressed look, which made everyone flinch at how much coldness in his eyes. "That's what they wanted you to believe." Steven said which made Peggy let out a chocked sound, what does he meant by that? Hydra was gone; Peggy had made sure to destroy everything with the Howling Commandos before they start searching for Steve.
"So doctor, tell us the news," Tony asked, getting out of bed and ignoring how Steve tried desperately to get him back in bed; count on Tony to ignore his health and walk around the place after being admitted to the hospital not a few hours ago.
Four hours, they waited four hours, before they heard anything about Tony and the pup, four agonizing hours. Steve glance at Maria who was passed out, leaning on Howard who was gazing at the white hospital walls with a dazed look, Peggy was holding a sleeping Angie, and she was too nodding off now and then, the crying drained her out, Jarvis (God bless him) told Steve he was going to bring some clothed for Tony and the Pup, never once did he give any reason for Steve to doubt the pup's survival, Natasha called him every hour, asking if she can come, or if they needed anything, or she was updating him on what's happened in Shield since Peggy, Steve, and Howard left, Steve asked her what did she found in the cell, the Alpha paused a little before she answered him, Steve told her to bring everything to him, he didn't know why, but he told her to bring the newspaper that talked about the Starks reappearing, and some papers that talk about all type of bonds of fated mates.
"… It's home…" A new voice said, which made everyone look around the room to see who was the speaker, and in the end, all of their eyes turned toward Rogers who was touching the dry paint on the padded walls, his face taking in the room with wide eyes, like he couldn't believe himself, and to be honest, even Tony couldn't believe his ears either, because here went Tony's plan of getting Rogers out of his mansion.
Steve wanted to say scream no, that Tony didn't die, that he and his son were finally saved, but he knew someone like Tony wouldn't believe something like that without proof. "Why do you think you are dead?" Steve asked the Omega gently, which made the Omega wet his lips, thinking.
He didn't know why he flushed when he heard the man say that, he could have said that to anyone or any star not him, but when he flushed he shined brightly which made the man below him smile.
"Don't know, woke up and saw you here," Steve stated before leaning in his seat to look at Tony with wide eyes full of wonder. "Are you my husband?" Steve asked causing Tony to shriek out a 'What?' only to curse and shush Morgan who whine at his loud sound. "I mean you live in the Rogers family home; a house that my grand-grand-grandfather builds, a house that my family owned for generations and refuse to give up. So it only meant one thing; you married one of Rogers's family members and I am the only Rogers after my parents and Nana," Steve stated giving a proud smile at the words he said, like the reasoning he gave has no wrong.
Tony finally saw inside of the boathouse, which made him grimace at the disgusting mess that was inside, which Natasha promised that they will clean it tomorrow as Tony should rest now, considering that the teen shouldn't exhaust himself to death like how he was planning with the way he wanted to work things out.
"Mama, 's cap Papa?" His son asked him one day, the two of them were lying on the floor far, far away from both the mattress and the door, no matter what, he will not let his son sleep in the same place that monster violate him in…
Thor… they haven't heard or see that much of him, ever since he gave the throne to Valkyrie and went with the guardians, Bruce was the person who talked with him the most and kept them updated on their friend, that was until he disappeared in 2026, they all have been searching for him until Betty came to them and told them to stop. In the end, they did, after learning that Bruce was finally free from the burdens he put on himself, Tony spent that night crying…
It was night, and as always, you could see Steve wondering down the mansion's halls of the Starks family… Steve knew he was crazy, he knew he was, and he was waiting for the others to notice that too, he was waiting for them to point their fingers at him and throw him into the loony bin… so far no one noticed… no one noticed how Steve wandered the halls like a ghost at night, no one noticed that Steve close his eyes tightly when he was alone hoping the singing would stop, no one noticed that every painting he draw since waking up from the ice, contains nothing but dead and bloody corpses twisted in such a strange angles that it made him sick looking at them for a long time, no one knows that he always go to Bucky's grave at night begging him to stop torturing him because he can't take it anymore… he was grateful that no one noticed that he was breaking down…
"Hello…" Tony hummed which made the small cat give a meow and licked Tony on his cheek, making the Omega hum at that and blink his eyes open, looking at the ground hoping to see Steve still there, but the man seemed to have already got up and tidy the place before going out of the room, that made a small pout make itself known on the Omega's face, he really wanted to see Steve.
Steven snarled which only caused the Alpha king to give a dark smile and take a hold of his left wrist, tightly, making Steven flinch at that, trying to continue his glaring at the Alpha hoping he will back down, but it only caused the Alpha to hold tightly into his arm tugging him toward him making the Omega nearly stumble.
Steve didn't know how long his car rolled around until it came to a stop, leaving Steve hanging upside down thanks to the seatbelt, it was only after a few desperate tried that Steve managed to unlatch the seatbelt, and fall on his back toward the roof or the car, his head ringing leaving Steve hopeless in his place. Steve's head hurt, his back hurt, his belly hurt… everything hurt… blood was running down the gash on his forehead to the side, matting his blond hair red and brown with blood. Steve's nose was throbbing and he couldn't help but cough a few mouthfuls of blood, making fear take hold of him and for him to take a few shaky breaths to calm down. The gashes on his body, leaving Steve feeling like he was nothing but a big throbbing bruise.
"As if." Steve snorted and rolled his eyes, an amused look on his face as he gazed at the bright sky before him. "He is going back home, and I'm sure when the Asgardians realize that the fallen star is me, they will pester him about his worthiness and try to dethrone him when they realize I still haven't given him my blessing. This was me saving myself and him the headache that will come." Steve walked toward the edge of the roof, whistling at the people and cars he saw down there, they all look like ants, a familiar sight that brought nostalgia.
Seeing his love awake, Tony almost jump out of his chair and toward Steve, planning on holding the Omega tightly and not letting go; if this was a dream, then Tony wished to never wake up from it, he wishes to be with Steve in any way he can, even if it was just a wistful dream like this.
"No, I didn't, Peggy didn't tell me about it either." Tony walked around, touching the art on the walls, humming as he sat on the blue matters, sneezing when the dust float all around the place. "We need to clean this place up." stated Tony as he sneezed once more, causing Rhodey to open the window, hoping to air the room before Pepper and Morgan showed up. "The Rogers family, the one who owned the house, Peggy told me about them having a son who was always sick and couldn't leave the house; probably his parents made this room for him before he died…" Tony's words trailed as he went to check over the corner that had books glued to the walls as if they were
"He was hated for that, being called insane, made fun of, and abandoned, the only one who stood beside him was his caretaker… as you see, he was not popular… I guess him acting like this was a defense mechanism… as other stars used to do a lot of unpleasant things when they see him…" Thor shifted in his place, as he looked down, feeling shame creeping on him making it hard to breathe.
The breakfast spent with pleasant conversation, smiles, and laughter, with Tony, spending that time rotating from taking a bite and feeding his baby, who giggles every time Steve takes it on himself to make airplane noises and feed the pup. Tony gazed at Steve when the Alpha did something making the pup squeal, and the Omega's eyes soften at that, looking at his pup then at the Alpha, flushing rosy color and a smile made its way toward his face…
His schedule was tiring and draining, leaving him no time to catch his breath and rest for a few seconds or go and check on his friends to see how they had fared in the last two fortnights he was forced to separate from them and leaving them to care for themselves while he cared for that useless man who called himself an Alpha, Steven can even say that his health was taking a little turn for the worst, always feeling dizzy and tired, sometimes even having shortness of breath that he couldn't indulge a few seconds of rest to catch his breath unless he wanted to be screamed at.
It was shocking to say the least, how the pup was so attached to this practically Omega when he always screams when he sees one coming near him, but Sarah stayed near the trio holding in her laughter when she saw the pup flush after he was told that the Omega was actually the Tony Stark. To see her grandson interact with an Omega without a fear, with a happy smile all over his face, it made her day, but to actually see her son joke with an Omega and talk with him without the wariness that usually takes a place every time Steve stand near an Omega… it gave her hope.
"Just something to think of…" Angie stated as she put a cup of tea in front of Tony while sitting in front of him and sipping from her cup, a thoughtful look on her face. "You know, I always thought that Rogers was just like us, a victim that was kept in the dark surrounded by lies and secrets his friends tell… I don't think he is a bad person… not if he would go out of his way to save those who came to him." Angie hummed; her words made Tony press his lips tightly in deep thoughts…
This is how Pepper found him, the Beta had to leave last night for something had come up, and when she called the Omega yesterday he didn't answer her, she had thought that the Omega was probably busy with meeting his pup and was so happy hoping that today she can come and meet the little fella that made Tony look all around the world for him, but when she entered the house, she was shaken at what she saw, everything was a disaster, it looked like a hurricane had passed through, she searched for Tony until she found him in the nursery crying, and when he looked at her she knew… she knew what happened and tears start running down her face as she went to hug the Omega rocking him back and forth, shushing him gently when he started sobbing harder than ever. And when Pepper finally saw the pictures after Tony calmed down a bit, she felt like the ground around her start shaking, because the baby looked a lot like Tony, and he was so happy and beautiful, and she cursed Howard, Stane, and that driver who took everything away from the Omega who asked for nothing, just for his pup.
"Did I ask you to correct me, foolish mortal?" Steve snapped, finally getting feed up and throw the raccoon at the man, causing him to falter to catch the raccoon who was too shocked to do anything. "Now, I am the one who is going to ask the questions here, and I advise you to answer them; it won't be smart gaining the ire of a star after invading their territory." Steve hissed his brightness and shining increased the angrier he became, which made the guardians shuffled before nodding their heads in fear…
"Her eyes… why are her eyes are blue?" Tony asked, feeling even more stupid and crazy for repeating the same sentence over and over again as if he was somehow trying to prove that Morgan wasn't his child.
Steven just hummed and turns his attention to the small boy who was pouting at missing the chance to play pillow fight, Steven gave him a small smile that made the boy flush and shy behind the woman from before. "Say is your name Petrus?" Steven asked, already remembering a lifetime ago where Anton was a chieftain of his own tribe and had a small boy named Petrus… sadly the boy died from fever when he was six years old in human time… he remembers how broken Anton was that day... Petrus was his favorite out of Anton's children…
Bucky glared at the man's back as he turned to Steve who was looking after Tony with a sad look on his face, making the man glare harder at Tony's back hoping that he will burn with the power of his glare alone. What did that man have and Bucky didn't? I mean, he knew Steve since the two of them were five and Steve taught him how to scare someone to death! (Literally speaking that is) "Forget about him Stevie, that man is nothing but trouble and heartbreak, you will live nothing but a miserable life if you went after him." Bucky said, only to realize his mistake when Steve let out a choked sound of happiness.
When Steve returned home, he has to blink when he saw Tony sitting on the stairs that led to the house's front door, gazing at the distance without seeming to see anything, which made the Alpha walk and sit beside the Omega, waiting for the younger male to talk, to do something, anything.
"You and this lie again! You say you have a girlfriend for ten years now, and not once did you even bring her home to meet the family! God, where is Steve when you need him, at least he would have knocked some manners into you!" Winnie complains which made Bucky groan at that and throw himself on the couch ignoring the rest of his mother's rant.
He needed to find his Omega and explain everything to him, tell him about what Howard did, plead with him to understand, kiss his feet in hope of him understanding, Tony will do everything, absolutely everything to gain Steve's forgiveness, and be granted the chance to meet his pup… his pup, Tony has a child. The Alpha let a small laugh at that, a child that would look like a small version of his mate, a little pup who was witty as his mother, a little artist or a little inventor. Tony took a shaky breath, his mind was a jumbling mess, and his heart was pounding so hard, Tony thought he was going to have a heart attack very soon, but Tony couldn't help noticing that for the first time in so many years…
"You Alphas are all the same… how disappointing…" Steven said before turning away, leaving Anton standing in front of his workshop, the realization of what Anton had implied by his words made Anton choke and for the blood into his veins to turn into frozen water, making him stay still in his place. Anton couldn't help but feel like he had just lost whatever progress he made with the queen, throwing him back into the starting line where Anton couldn't even share his input without being labeled as a monster by the queen.
"I think it will be a good idea, maybe then Peter will stop writing poets about how amazing Harley is, and how smart he is, and how genius he is." Steve said in a playful voice, which caused Tony to hide his laughter behind his hand, especially when Peter shriek from embarrassment, telling his father that the two of them are enemies from now on, and that Captain America sucks and it totally meant Civil War is going to happen, which caused Tony to let lose it and laugh loudly his, which turned Peter's adorable wrath to him…
"Steve!" Steve could only hear Tony's terrified scream of his name followed by the sound of the repulsors firing before Steve realized what Nebula did… she had activated a portal… as much as Steve wanted to know how she did that without the Space Stone or the Bifrost consent, Steve thinks he knew the answer, especially when he felt the Scarlet Witch's tainted magic coming from the portal… a bending spell that force the Bifrost to open without its guardian's consent…
The sound of his name being called made the trickster turn to Steven's eyes widen a little before be put the book in his hand down. "Traveler…" Loki said slowly looking at Steven when the man entered his room after Loki gave him permission, which made the trickster look at him with an unreadable expression.
"Oh… it took me weeks to catch…" Rogers said with a sad voice, and Tony could only shake as he saw that… that thing! start yowling as it hissed at the crows making the birds give a mighty caw before flying away from the trees.
"J… is Steve home?" Tony whispered, not knowing why he was whispering but knowing deep down that it was unwise to make any sound. When no answer came from the A.I. after a whole minute, Tony knew that something was deeply wrong and he stood up fast from the bed, his breaths coming in fast puffs as he tried to calm himself, walking slowly out of the room, looking through the hallway before rushing toward his sons' room; praying that if someone was in, they haven't reached his babies.
"It is OK, sweetheart, I got you," Steve whispered in Tony's ear, causing him to calm down and let out a sigh, leaning on Steve's chest and being grateful that his husband didn't point out how jittery and nervous Tony was becoming as he started to think that they missed something.
Tony hummed to himself as he tucked the clothes in the basket, dividing them into their designed places; it had been a few months since the conversation with Steve had taken place, months since the two of them became closer and closer every moment that took place, so close that Tony realized he couldn’t imagine his life without Steve and Peter in it anymore. Tony was so grateful to Steve and Peter, so thankful that they remained with him even knowing that he was damaged and there is no hope of getting better, even when Steve spent his days assuring Tony that things are going to be fine, he just have to wait and see.
Things became a little rough after the secret of Tony being pregnant get out; Peggy and Steven were furious, not only at Rogers and Tony but at themselves too for letting things reach this point. Steven knowing it was too late to feel anything but regret, managed to calm Peggy and Tony; the three of them have a long conversation about the next step from there, in which Tony told them that he doesn't want Rogers to know that he was the baby's daddy because he was going to offer the child for adoption, which shocked both Steven and Peggy but they both know they couldn't change Tony's mind, not now.
"Thank you…" The woman said as she took the teacup from the Omega, keeping a subtle eye on him, not believing her eyes when she saw him here when she was expecting to meet a mid-forty, someone who was going to be her lead on Dr. Erskine after all this time, she never would have thought that Steve was actually the man's grandson, but looking at the man now, at the way he acted, she can say that he was the fiery type that Erskine was and always respect when he sees it. "So Steve…" The woman could see the younger man's blue eyes rising toward her, taking her in, and deep down she wondered how she was going to break the subject. "You might not have known this, but I was actually your grandfather's friend, Dr. Erskine, he was my mentor, and I was actually hoping that you know where he is, or if that he left me any message, I know we haven't met for years, but I really wish to find him." Peggy said gentle, hoping that the young man will know where the doctor was if he was alive… and if not, she hoped that Steve will at least give her something that will help her.
They didn't give any time to recover as the demon fox's ki made the blond's recovery time incredibly short. With Shika's cool hand on his hip and a soft press of a kiss against his sweat slick shoulder, Kiba slid into Naruto's tight, wet heat with a broken groan. Thick corded legs came up around his waist as he pressed in to the hilt, that perfect ass quivering around his length. Kami, he'd missed this so keenly. He snapped his hips forward ruthlessly, grunting deeply as he worked his cock into that mind stealing heat.
The brunet’s eyes drag unconsciously to the blond’s soul mark, peeking up over the open collar of his knit shirt. He flushed and looked away quickly but the damage was already done. The captain slapped a palm over the mark and stared at Anthony in shocked dismay.
He sacrificed a couple wet wipes to the cause, cleaning off most of the sweat and dirt of the road and soon enough he was slipping on the red panties with a sigh. The thin satin felt awesome against his bare skin, smooth as it slide along the line of his legs, the curve of his ass.
Kiba had missed him something fierce, throwing himself into work and his clan to smother the pain of being apart. He loved Shika and he knew the shadow nin loved him but there was something missing from them both because their third wasn't there.
Adjusting the optics, Anthony observed them for a while, taking careful note of what the diggers wore, where they were and what kind of equipment they were using to dig. The vehicle looked fascinating and for a moment, he wished that he could just set it all aside and explore how the massive thing worked. Citadel mechanics all functioned on direct solar energy conversion and looked and sounded nothing like these machines.
“I know you didn’t believe it, and maybe on the bad days some part of you still doesn’t. But it would have been enough just to know you, to be your friend and your teammate. To be given more than that, to be given your trust and your submission and your love, that’s far more than any of us would have ever imagined. I’m not a greedy man, Tony; I learned a long time ago never to want too much or hope too hard. That kind of thing just gets in the way in the business I’m in. But when it comes to you I just can’t seem to stop wanting. I want all of it; I want your smiles and your anger and your stubbornness and your generosity and your endless capacities for love and forgiveness. I want every day of the rest of our lives if you’ll have me, have us.”
“Not really. I tend to find that the folks most invested in thinking about corporations as people are the same ones who really want to avoid thinking about people as people. I will admit the benefits are probably better than freelancing though—which is good seeing as it looks like you’ll need ‘em.”
Steve was a lucky man, he reflected as he watched Bruce walk away, and not just because of the submissive waiting for him in his bed.
Major Content Warnings for this Ask Strange response: This chapter depicts D/s Steve in the immediate aftermath of D/s Tony's death. There is nothing overly graphic about the conditions of Tony's demise itself beyond a mention of the Avalon protocol. (This is a theory originating (I believe? correct me if I'm wrong on this) from fandom that Tony likely has protocols in the suit allowing it to keep fighting in the event of his death, and not inform the team until after the immediate danger has passed.) While it isn't explicitly stated here, BTW, my headcanon is that Tony had actually meant to take this protocol out of the suits and just didn't get around to it in time; he was not being deliberately cruel to Steve or anyone else.
“I’m afraid so, Mr. Stark. It’s an acronym, one your counterpart coined, even. It stands for Sentient World Observation and Response Department.”
The choice laid out in the selection in front of him was a fairly obvious one. Natasha wanted him mindless (or as close to it as Tony was going to be able to manage), and seemed equally happy to take him there through pain or through pleasure. Pain still felt intimidating and appealing in pretty equal measures (that paddle in particular made his gut clench every time he looked its way); getting there through pleasure, that one was in some ways even more novel. None of his previous partners had ever thought to try to deny him that before. It probably never would have occurred to them given that most of them had been attracted to him in the first place because of his reputation for taking, taking, taking.
Skip the human interaction, supplement with money and apologies. Yeah, the guy sure sounded like Steve’s Tony, at least the way Tony had been at the beginning, before he’d trusted them to want
Steve got his answer when the doors to the media room slid open and he heard Tony’s voice—except it wasn’t this Tony. It was his Tony; in the footage, he stood in his usual sunglasses and immaculate suit at the entrance to SI’s New York offices. There was a small, healing wound above his right eyebrow that Steve recognized as a souvenir from one of their numerous battles against Doom.
“Got any more of that lemonade Bruce made? I don’t know what the hell he puts in it, but the stuff is addictive.”
“Maybe not in all the same ways as people in this universe,” Bruce agreed, moving another step closer so that Tony could feel the low rumble of the other man’s voice against his back. “We can talk more about that later, too. But that
“Bucky.” Beneath Steve, Bucky stirred, then went rigid as the memory of the previous day returned to him. He tried to relax back into a posture resembling sleep, pretending he hadn’t heard Steve at all; if it hadn’t broken Steve’s heart a little, the performance would have been laughable in its complete unbelievability. “Bucky, I know you’re awake. I know you can hear me. I gave you the space I know you needed last night, but it’s morning. The team’s having breakfast together, and you’re not making whatever it is you’re feeling worse by skippin’ out on a meal.”
fell asleep listening to me complain about my bullshit once.” Out of nowhere, the skin near Bruce’s eyes flashed green. It was sudden, over in an instant, and accompanied by none of the other dozen or so signals that Tony needed to be getting the hell out of dodge. But it was unmistakable. “I wasn’t—it’s not like I blame you man, you’re definitely not
“Phil mentioned you were having some issues with some homework—not in a tattling way, he was just mentioned in passing that he was concerned. Anything I can help with?” Tony groaned, flopping onto the couch into a dramatic, swooning pose.
“Not to you. To Tony.” Especially given how Tony had died (the Avalon protocol, Steve might never forgive him that even in death) it shouldn’t have surprised Steve that Tony had prepared for this moment. Tony’s orientation had never once made him afraid or unwilling to go behind Steve’s back, or right in front of his face, and do what he thought was right. (Beautiful, insolent,
Steve saw very little of Natasha, Bruce, or Tony for the next two days. Given how cursed Tony’s previous experiences with aftercare seemed to be Steve supposed that was a good thing, and he took Dr. Domen’s advice to try to focus his attention on other things as much as possible. He and Clint had a memorable scene with Phil; Steve attended another art class; he devoted countless hours to strategy sessions and memos and phone calls related to the workplace orientation program. The latter, while often aggravating, did at least give him an excuse to call Talia and check in.
“Not sure that’ll be necessary, Dr. Domen. No offense, but I really don’t think grief counselling is necessary at this point. I need to figure out how to deal with the new Tony, not…” Domen peered down at the tablet in her lap, scrolling through a text-document. Something about it rubbed Steve the wrong way. It felt too similar to the way the first round of SHIELD doctors that he’d seen right after he’d been pulled out of the ice had looked more at their computers than at Steve himself.
“I want a detailed sit-rep in under two minutes,” Coulson said, all traces of good humour now vanished. Tony leaned in toward the speaker, his heart in his throat. Who was down? Had something managed to harm Hulk? Or Thor? It couldn’t be Natasha, she was just as stubborn as the rest of them and entirely unlikely to call a med-evac for herself…
Some of the not-so-old hurt of their breakup following Peter’s outing lingered close to the surface of MJ’s words, and his stomach lurched. He’d lost her in one capacity already, the thought of her being out of his life entirely felt unbearable. Before he could do any further damage, he pulled the heavy bottle out of his backpack and waved it in her direction. She took it with a pinched sort of expression that somehow managed to look both impressed and disapproving.
In between all of the crabbing, he did actually try to just do the damn homework. It didn’t have to be elaborate, after all, just one damn sentence, one thing Tony genuinely liked about himself. He made and then scribbled out several dick jokes and other glib remarks, one of which resulted in the ink from the fountain pen spattering everywhere. Through it all, Coulson never so much as glanced up except to occasionally peer out at the rolling waves of the ocean. Tony was starting to truly believe there was something superhuman about the guy’s focus.
, just like I can’t be the Rhodey you remember, not exactly. But that doesn’t mean we have to be nothin’ to one another, or that accepting our help with this charade you’ll have to put on means wiping out who you are. Do you think…could you give this a shot, a real shot, for two weeks? If you don’t want to stay here after that I swear Pepper and I will figure something else out, but your team and I, we’d like the chance to be here. If that’s alright with you.”
Tony tried, he did. Phil was being just oppositional enough to push all of Tony’s authority-defying buttons; he clearly expected Tony to be unable to do this simple thing, and Tony was nothing if not a man who enjoyed upsetting other people’s expectations. And it was, he knew, a simple thing. What Coulson had said that night had been kind, but it hadn’t been overly effusive or hyperbolic. Somehow, that made it worse. The man staring back at Tony in the mirror, what the hell had he ever done to earn that kind of praise from a man like Coulson? His very existence in this universe was predicated on his own failure in his own. His life now was built on his inability to get the team to listen about Thanos sooner, to prepare. He’d failed to do that, and he'd lost everyone one way or another: Pepper, the team, Pete—
“Just tell him and go, Pepper. I have this.” She sighed again, a long, defeated sound that reminded Tony far more of the post-Snap version of his own Pepper than the one that he’d slowly become familiar with on this side. He sat up, some of the edges of headspace falling away in the face of her obvious distress.
“No, it’s…it’s a good idea. I’m sorry no one thought to offer footage to you before.” Steve shuffled his feet like an anxious teenager, then squared his shoulders, took a long, deep inhalation, and continued. “I know we got off on the wrong foot, and that was mostly my fault.”
A little over two hours later found Peter wandering the compound on his own. May had been reluctant to leave, but was eventually persuaded by Happy’s thoughtfully-timed reservations in the city (Peter had mouthed a silent thanks to the guy for that one.) The repeated assurances of Peter, Happy, and FRIDAY that Captain Rogers would be returning later that evening was the eventual tipping point.
“Would you like to kneel at my feet while we talk, or would you prefer to stay standing?” was Coulson’s next query. This one was even easier. Tony had wanted to be on his knees for Phil since that morning in the media room weeks ago. It felt natural and right to sink onto the pillow Phil placed on the floor. “May I touch you or would you prefer space?”
“Yessir,” Tony said, but before the honorific was even fully out of his mouth, Tony’s jaw was tightening. He looked quickly away from all of them, staring at the gentle rolling waves of the sea instead. “Sorry. I’m—sorry.”
Using a range of philosophical, cultural studies, humanities computing and feminist/critical race scholarship, as well as popular culture case-studies, this course explores the obligations humans and machines hold to one another. Core themes of the course include an exploration of pain and empathy, shared responsibility, and acting within a context. By exploring this topic from such a wide array of directions and perspectives, our aim is to present human-machine interaction not as a singular script or process, but as a dynamic and ongoing relationship shaped by mutual respect, shared goals, and informed decision making.
“Only if you tell me if you’ve really made a breakthrough with nanotech. I’ve heard rumours about improvements to the suit, but you haven’t made any public statements, and Captain Hardass has some annoyingly strict rules about revealing anything to do with you that you haven’t already said yourself. I ask you, what is the point of knowing the boss when you still don’t get any of the good gossip?”
“I guess so,” Steve agreed. He wanted Tony to pursue whatever relationship he wanted with Peter, he really did, he just wished he didn’t feel like their own bond was on such shaky ground. Nat rolled her eyes and elbowed him in the side.
“I can do more,” he pleaded. “I can eat you out, I’m really good at that, or you can put the ring back on, as long as you want. Or—or.” He couldn’t think of what else to offer Natasha, what would be good enough for her, make her see that Tony really was trying to be a good submissive even if he was awful at it.
“No. I worried about that at first, same as I worried about my partners only wanting me because of my resemblance to someone else. And that’s why I didn’t want to lie to you about this, because I think suspecting something like that would be a hell of a lot more painful later on. But that isn’t what’s going on here. You are very far from a carbon copy of the Peter in my old universe. And sure sometimes that’s weird and hard in its own way, but I like you a hell of a lot on your own terms, kid. You are tough and smart and absolutely determined to make a difference in a world that basically tries to force you to be apathetic. We might never have the kind of bond I had with that Peter, and that’s—that’s okay too. But I couldn’t see the two of you suffering and not at least try to help in whatever ways I could, you know?”
He padded towards the sitting area on socked feet, dragging them against the carpet childishly. Most of the old manor had been hard wood floors and proper house shoes and quick, harsh scoldings for running too fast or laughing too loud.
Armed with this knowledge, Wufei found and printed year book photos of both boys and had them framed. He then went to the local Chinese market and bought incense, oils and some sweets and delicacies. He also bought some flowers and took some cash from the ATM.
"Put the damn thing on, Tony, you look like a drowned rat. And this rain can't be doing your lungs any good either."
His skin was pale, much like everyone Anthony had seen so far, but there were patches of pink along his arms, wrists and neck. This man had been in sunlight. Very recently in fact. Anthony narrowed his eyes as the man absently rooted around on the table for some tool or the other.
Rossi led him down several corridors until they came to a large pair of heavy doors. They were just as ostentatious and over whelming as the rest of the house, screaming money and power so blatantly. The salt and pepper Italian rapped on the door three times then waited three seconds before he twisted the knob.
He’d even given Xander enough time to make a last call to Sunnydale where Willow and Giles were already battening down the magical hatches while Buffy prowled the chaotic streets. It had been a huge relief to know that his people were safe back home. Well, as safe as they could be on a hell mouth anyway.
Rodney waved him into the jumper and dropped himself into the pilot's chair. "They're not coming today. It's just the two of us. I wanted to show you something."
He placed the second cup on the small table near the arm of the chair without a word, just making sure that it was in clear view and within reach. There was no reaction. Well, he didn’t expect much of one. The sky rumbled as he approached the windows, his breath skipping a bit as the clouds seemed to press down upon the city like the lid of casket slowly closing.
He wrapped the glowing stone carefully in a bit of his mother's handmade lace and tucked it into his shirt next to his own heart. Scott handed him the bag he'd already packed and hugged him tight.
Xander felt a flush at the words, his hips bucking helplessly; the press of Spike’s leather clad hard-on as it snagged on the flimsy satin making heat coil in his belly.
He especially loved the look of it over the ocean from the view of his room. He'd moved his mattress over to the windows, collecting all of his blankets, pillows and cushions in to a giant nest. He'd placed one of the ancient space heaters he'd traded for off planet, and that Rodney had suped up for him, nearby, turning it on. It glowed a soft honey yellow that made the room glow when all the other lights were turned off.
He spoke his human name for the first time in years, leaving his title behind in the ashes of the past.
Eugené snickered, her over-sized turquoise sweater marvelous against her mocca skin. "You watch too many horror movies, dude. "
Erik grinned and turned the stool, tugging at Tony's waist until he stood between his legs. Tony hummed into the kiss, his hum turning to a moan as the kiss deepened and Erik's hands wandered down to his ass.
The small sound his wedding ring made on the marble countertop echoed through the empty kitchen as he tapped his fingers restlessly and without rhythm. Along with the clink of his coffee cup as he twisted it back and forth with his other hand, the soft glub glub of the bubbling percolator, and the almost sighs every time he exhaled; it all came together like some kind of odd melody.
He knew without looking, every curve of the words engraved on the inside of the plain band. Words of promise meant to last as long as the rings did. Steve’s hand came up to grasp his own, stilling his fingers, his other hand warm on the small of his back.
"Am I boring you?" The deep voice startled him and he flinched, cursing himself for not paying better attention. He looked up into sharp blue eyes and held their gaze. "I guess you must find our dark little corner of the planet primitive compared to the bright shining future you've known."
“I may be horny, but I’m not fucking dumb.” Reaper gave him a flat look. “I can drop you off on the nearest planet right now, you just say the word, but I’m not letting you free on this ship for a fucking second. And I really don’t want to have to kill you. Today at least.”
Draco trailed to the back of the group, having been to the ceremonies before. It didn't matter if you rushed forward, choosings happened in their own sweet time.
The gravity of the situation finally hit him then, the cold and brutal truth that the one fated by destiny to complete him, body, mind, heart and soul; was the one who most likely be the death of him before this was all over.
It was good money, if a little dirty; but it was stepping stone to being legit and was probably as honest as he was going to get. He wasn't the shining family Scion like his cousin was, with his high education and fancy house in the hills.
The man in question frowned, glancing at his boss before staring disapprovingly as Tony once more. Nick sat back with a smug disbelief, arm slung over the back of his chair.
It took another day for the news to leak out to the public and that’s when things really went to shit. Martial law was initiated worldwide as people panicked and ran around like headless chickens. News and Media talked about nothing else and the National Guard were out in force to stomp out any one trying to take undue advantage. Money started pouring into beleaguered space and missile programs, trying to find some way to swat the comet away from the planet like some unwanted fly.
"No still means no, gentlemen, so if you could see yourselves out of my building and out of my life before I call security that would be awesome."
That night, as he shook in his lover's arms, he felt like he'd found home. He no longer had to try to make a family out of people who didn't love him back. He'd found a new love, new friends and, if Seeley was being serious, a new job that satisfied his need to serve and protect.
He rushed to the stable and slipped the reins over his favourite bee, Buzzcut, before slipping out of the building and zooming down towards the great clearing. He'd trained the bee from larva and loved how fast it went, much to his mother's displeasure.
Spike had just rolled his eyes and grabbed Xander by the collar, frog marching him away from the feasting beastie and shoving him into the car the vamp and stolen and hot-wired.
Draco felt a something ripple through him, like the ringing of a clear and beautiful bell. *Hello Gorgeous*, he greeted mentally and was almost blown away by proud response that resounded though his mind. He could feel his eyes tearing up as the Mabille fluttered its giant wings, its two long hind fronds flared. This was a moth built for long flight, strong and agile and beautiful and perfect.
The brunette jerked his head towards the open doorway, grabbing and pulling at Anthony’s arm when he didn’t move fast enough. He barely had time to snatch his under suit before he was hustled down a series of long and dizzying corridors.  Anthony’s mind spun with scenarios. The sudden wake up and hurried pace did not bode well for his situation.
Draco himself, preferred the steed built for long distance flight. He loved the sky and fantasized about keeping to the air for hours on end as he sped towards the horizon, unknown lands unfurling before him.
"Oh God, Don't be such a dramatic bitch," Candy sighed heavily. "I need this to complete my thesis. No one put a gun to your head to make you come with us you know. Frankly, I didn't even want to invite you but Jake said that you would just spend the break holed up in your room, like the sad sack you are."
The sound of a prison shiv entering flesh was like cutting into a ripe watermelon and the man fell back against the hallway with a choked off cry, holding his hands against the wounds in his chest.
Stark’s sharp peel of laughter echoed across the empty balcony. “Oh man, that’s Obie, my God father. He finally retired last month and handed over the reins of the company to me."
Scott stood there until he couldn't see Stiles anymore, letting the tears fall freely from his eyes as he cleared the pyre. With one last longing glance at the distant cliffs, he sighed and turned back towards the town.
He’d seen Natasha become an entirely different person with a change of clothes, a touch of make-up and pinned up hair. Pepper wielded her fashion like a weapon, finely honed and deadly with her solid, uncompromising colurs and unrepentant femininity.
He finished typing and waved away the keyboard, glancing at the small confirmation icon that all the messages and instructions had been sent.
The air was searing hot and black smoke and ash clogged the filters of his mask, he could hear Karen calling for him and he tried once again to heave the large beam off his back. The beam creaked and bent a little but wouldn't give, somehow braced against some other metal framework. He grunted, straining fruitlessly against the beam once again, tears forming in his eyes from the acrid smoke.
The shorter youth tossed a look over his shoulder while he gestured at the interned corpses around them. "Who's gonna report us?  These guys?"
As the comet streaked across the sky, lighting it up as bright as day, its tail a spectacular show of blues, purples, whites, and fiery yellows and oranges. Stiles could only stare, transfixed as the heavenly body slowly made its way across the sky. Holy fuck, his mind was officially blown.
He shrugged and motioned absently at his eyes with a rueful grin. Stiles gaped stupidly at his tactless humor for a few seconds before he broke out into peals of loud laughter, leaning against the other man as he cackled unrepentantly.
His next words were cut off as Steve moved, stealing his breath and making him throw his head back with a cry. God, Steve was so fucking deep.
She'd sent him a carefully cropped picture of random internet boobs and extracted a promise of discretions which he was all too willing to agree too and wiped the texts right after  with a neat little trick her brother had taught her. The phone was back in Cindy's purse before the girl even knew it was gone. It was almost as easy as breaking into his gym locker and cloning his cell phone while he was in basketball practice.
She panted as she dumped most of the weed into the drainage tunnel off the canal, making sure to stuff some into her pockets and on the shoes, squeezing the oil into the crushed burgundy velvet and matching hat. All that running made it harder to climb the trellis but she made good time, stripping and stuffing the outfit to the back of the closet and shoving the bloody shiv behind the toilet tank.
He smiled to himself as he saw a flush crawl up Rodney's neck and around to his back. Ronon's cock twitched and he willed it still. There'd be time for that later… if Rodney really was interested.
Once in a while they would pass an open doorway, carved directly from the bedrock. The room beyond would be lit with the same blue light, its occupant bustling around the small cramped space, hard at work.
The voice was low and it drew Anthony in, thrumming through his entire body as the blond grew closer. He could feel it from his curling toes to his fluttering eyelashes. His mark gave a sharp zing and he gasped. The captain was so close now, he could feel the man’s heat. Feel his breath along the length of his neck. Anthony shuddered and gave a ragged breath.
He was stuck to one of the nearby buildings, watching for any signs of movement when his radio chirped. It was the police sergeant. The Avengers were on site and he wanted Spiderman to do a final sweep of the outlying buildings for any stragglers. He gave a cherry reply and set off on his way.
"My sister knits…. A lot." he'd confessed sheepishly as they'd stood in the small kitchen making coffee. "I send her cool weird yarn as gifts and she sends me back stuff made from it. It's how we keep in touch now that she's moved to California."
Satisfied, she tucked the make-up away and stowed her bag behind some storage bins in the small room. The window was easy to prop open and she stepped down unto one of the large dumpster bins that stood right outside.
Moments passed with no movement of the letters so he took that as a yes and proceeded to clean up the broken lamp and the disrupted shrine. He still left the pictures and the flowers and some of the sweets he could salvage. He got rid of the oil and the incense, anything to do with fire and flame.
It ends up with Tony making the miniature Arc-Reactor, followed shortly by Mark l Armor, it ends up with Yinsen's death, and him and Bucky surviving by a miracle, it ends with them walking for three days until they saw a helicopter with Rhodey waving for them, it ends with them finally back home…
And lastly, there was Steve… Steve who seems like he didn't age a day over 46, other than the few laughing lines and the few white hairs here and there, he was still as young and strong as the day they got him out of the ice. He saw lots of ups and downs in his life, but it seems that the five years after the snap changed everything, instead of quitting heroism like Tony or Thor, Steve and the rest of what's left of the Avengers were active within the community, which caused them to become celebrities and figures of safety and stability in the fragile world, everything changed after the final battle. And after that day Steve found Tony on his doorsteps, things changed between the two of them, they tried to tie the snapped threads of their fragile relationship, they end up getting out with something beautiful instead, after a long and hard path, the two of them ends up getting married in 2028 and they had been married for over twenty years, Steve was never thankful for the Arc-Reactor as he was now because it gave him a little more time with his loved one who was now reaching the age of ninety-five.
The two pups were so shocked that they needed a few more minutes before gathering themselves and when they finally did the two of them pouted. "You said he will not notice us, Petrus," James stated, a familiar frown on his face that Anton was sure if he tilted his head and close one of his eyes, he would see the queen frowning at him… good to know that James inherited the scary frown from his dam.
"J, I give up, tell me where is Peter." Tony grunts as he leans on the couch behind him, having returned from searching the whole communal floor not a minute ago. You will think that for a loud and energetic kid like Peter, finding him will be easy; no Sir, no one can find Peter when he doesn't want to be found, even when Natasha gets involved, which was scary as hell if Tony has anything to say. Though lately, the only one who seemed to be able to find the smaller boy was no one other than Steve who took Peter under his wings.
"Where is the fun in that? At least this way he would come after me to get revenge, and if that happened, it's justified that I turn it into sashimi." Steve grumbled, making Tony snort and shake his head at that, ignoring how panicked everyone was still around them. Tony was sure that the shark won't show its face in this neck of the woods for the next one hundred years if it could; hell! It would probably bring its gang with it the next time they came around, hoping that they would manage to overpower Steve by dumb luck.
Suddenly lights start flickering on and off, making Clint frown and look up, he saw a movement in the mirror which made his heart jump. He gazes with an opened mouth as he saw the bathroom curtain move to the side, when Clint turned to the tub he saw the curtain in its place… unmoved… that caused a shiver to rake Clint and he turns his gaze to the mirror, he can hear some light pulps exploding in the distance but he didn't care… because he was sure that he saw something.
That day, Howard can say he had so much fun, he had so much fun being a part of a family that he never thought he will have a place in. it made Howard think, it made him wonder, what if he was more acceptant of the baby that Tony had, would the small boy be with them now, roughing up with Peter and planning many mischiefs together; it made Howard wonder if the last three years would have been spent here, spoiling his grandkids and being a part of a family that loved him, instead of spending it in Malibu, staying in that big and cold mansion alone, doing work and work and wallow in regret and pity.
"You know, darling, you would make an amazing Addams one day!" Steve stated happily, ignoring the yowl of the cat that Steve stole from Maria; Steve was sure Maria's precious 'Lily' will make a great addition to his cemetery, and this time Steve was sure Tony would like the honor of being the one to bury that pest alive… or they could keep it as a pet after it raised from the grave? It all depends really.
"Uh… I should be the one asking you that question. You are the ghost that I always see here, but Mom and Dad never believe me when I tell them about you; Nana though, says that you might be a vision I am having of something." Steve said before he started coughing causing Tony to wince at the sounds that left the teenager's chest (The sounds were painful to hear), taking a closer look, Tony notice the blanket that Steve huddle under, and the medicine on the nightstand beside him. Tony took a shaky breath as he took in the room once more, taking the strange furniture that decorates the room and how old and new it was at the same time.
After the day that Steve told his baby about his father, the little boy always came to him to ask more about his father each day, and to say the truth Steve didn't have it in him to hold the information from his son anymore, his son needed his father, even if it's just a phantom of him, Steve promised himself that he will tell Peter the whole truth when the child gets older, but not now.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, angst, sadness, violence, panic attacks, mention of infant's death, and poor Stevie! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
The next two weeks went by faster than Tony ever thought was possible; Tony wished to re-live the past month, again and again, wanting to be held in Steve's arms until the world's end. A small part of Tony was convinced that this beautiful life he was having now, was nothing but a dream; nothing but a beautiful fantasy he had wished for and was dreaming of, and that any moment now he will wake up back home… alone.
Bruce hummed for a few seconds, turning to Tony with a small smile on his face after he was done, causing Tony's heart to pound a little too loudly in his chest. "Congratulation, it's a girl!" Bruce ended up saying after taking too long to answer building in the anticipation, hearing those words Tony nearly jump from his place in happiness, hugging a squealing Pepper when she skipped toward him with a happy smile on her lips, Rhodey claps him on the shoulder, pointedly refusing to make any eye contact last Tony noticed his shiny eyes, not that Tony didn't notice, he just didn't point it out loud.
"Oh, this? That's also a tree, little one." Steve said when he saw pointing at a tree with yellow leaves, considering it was fall, Steve had a small fleeting thought that everything was going to get mixed for the small pup, which sadly proven to be true, when the pup frown at Steve's answer, and looked out of the window to look at another tree.
"I never meant for this to happen, Anthony, if I could go back in time, I would have changed everything…" Howard said in a choked voice, not knowing what to say anymore as his gaze never left the suffering Omega, that looked at him with betrayal, it seemed that his son forgot that Howard also didn't know about the pup until after his death. Until after he start looking for him until he start uncovering the truth... until he learns how rotten Obadiah was that he will get rid of his grandchild just to get rid of any competition to have Tony as his... until Howard charged Obadiah with every felony known to man that the Alpha ends up going to prison and stop destroying his and his son's life more than he already did. The Alpha knows that no matter how much time passed, he will never get the trust and the relationship he had with his son back, he knows that now… now Howard was really alone because he not only lost his grandson but also his son who refused to even look at him in the face without seeing his pup's murderer, he knows that no matter what he did he could never gain forgiveness, for that boat had long since sale and left him.
in 2010: In the first part of the Year, the events of Gala took a place where Tony met Peter, as for the latter part of the year, November. the events of The Avengers took a place.
Fury, like Tony, seemed to be done with Barnes shit, which was a miracle considering that this was the first time the two of them agreed on anything. "Barnes, quit your whining! If you want to see Rogers that badly then go to the fucking holding cells and see him!" The man snapped which made Barnes sniff a little and turn his head to the commander.
"Oh, Peter!" Steve choked as his legs finally lost the strength they had and Steve found himself on the ground shaking, with Peter in his lap. "Oh my stars, I nearly let her take you, I nearly let her take you…" Steve choked, tears falling down his face as he took in Peter; the small boy was shaking like a leaf. "We are leaving, come, we are going." Steve started shakily as he tried to stand up on his uncooperative legs.
Returning home, whatever happy mood Steve was in has vanished when he remembered that Tony had abandoned him on the most important day of their life. That caused tears to threat and fall from his eyes once more, and for the fourth time that day, Steve cursed how the hormones were making his emotions go highway.
