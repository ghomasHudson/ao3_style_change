He bit back an automatic retort—he might have been a host instead of production staff, but that didn’t mean he sat around doing nothing all day—but stopped himself at the last second. Rumlow would just grunt at him like he always did and then go report to Pierce that Steve was picking fights again. And he didn’t need another writeup. Pierce already thought of him as a troublemaker. He’d been suspended twice in the last year alone for punching Rollins for harassing some of the interns. Any more trouble and he was running a real risk of losing his job.
Tony was busy putting the breakfast dishes in the dishwasher when the overhead light popped loudly. Instinctively, he ducked, raising his arms above his head as though that was going to help any. When, after a moment, he still hadn’t felt any glass raining down on him, he slowly straightened back up and looked at the light.
Tony: On the surface, it might look really cute. Hey, you’re serenading this girl, that’s so romantic, right? But even just a second look will tell you how creepy it is. You’re basically harassing her into a relationship with you. She can’t escape you cause you’re at school together and she can’t even hear herself think because you’re blowing a trumpet—probably badly if we all take a moment to think back to high school band—right in her ear. Of course she’s going to agree to go out with you! She doesn’t have a choice! And I’m sorry, but that’s just not romantic.
They fall into an easy silence as they work, which surprises Steve. He would have thought, given how their last few conversations had gone, that any silence between them would be fraught with tension, if they were able to keep from sniping at each other at all. But maybe, he thinks, maybe Tony is just as tired as fighting as he is.
Damn. Steve had been so distracted by the thoughts of what Thor was buying and what it would be used for that he’d completely forgotten about the expiration date on it. “Think I should go after him?” he asks gloomily.
“No, it’s fine, I sleep better in my own bed anyway,” he said, parroting an old excuse he’d used a thousand times before, pretty much every time he and Tony ended up in the same bed together.
He knows the answer, even as he asks it: Colonel Rhodes is there with Tony, Colonel Rhodes, who will never again be able to fly War Machine; Vision, who spends more time with Wanda in their rented hotel rooms than he does in New York; and a child whose name Steve still doesn’t know, who is in no way ready to be an Avenger. And he winces, because by this point, his letter will have reached Tony. His letter, in which he’d given the team to Tony and called them his, only they’re not, are they? Because he looks around the cramped safehouse and he realizes—he hadn’t left Tony with anyone really, had he? Out of the original team, Clint had stood by him all along, Bruce and Thor are gone, and now Nat’s come to join him. He had always had Sam and Wanda, and Vision might as well be with them, for all the time he spends with Wanda. Even T’Challa, so firmly supportive of the Accords, has gone behind the UN’s back to give Steve and his team assistance.
He grins. Open the store. He loves the sound of that. Decided, he climbs out of bed and changes back into the clothes he’d worn earlier that day. No sense in ruining a new outfit when these still smell fine, right?
about how he’d been gone for so long. He can understand that. Since she was born five years ago, Tony’s tried to limit his business trips to only a couple of days at max. But then they’d had a factory manager who was stealing wages, and Tony had had to fly out to India to deal with that, plus the rehiring of the new manager and trying to figure out compensation for his employees…
“Apology not accepted,” Tony replies primly. Steve grins at him and for a moment, it’s like nothing is wrong. They could be back home in the Tower or at the Compound, joking around with each other like any other night. But they’re not, and Steve’s grin fades as he realizes that nothing will ever be the same again.
Tony stretched up to give him a chaste, closed-mouthed kiss. “The shelter sounds nice. But maybe later in the afternoon.”
He’s still thinking about it that night when he gets into bed. He’s still wondering if he did the right thing. There’s no doubt in his mind that signing the Accords, as they are right now, would have been a bad decision but he thinks about Tony and he just…
“—as permanent members, it is my honor and my pleasure to introduce Hope van Dyne, Agent Sharon Carter, Maria Hill, and Ororo Munroe. Agreeing to a temporary rotation, I’d like to welcome Dr. Stephen Strange, King T’Challa Udaku, and Vision. Being welcomed to our probationary status, I’d like to introduce Scott Lang. I will now be taking questions.”
“Right, but you’re still living with somebody who does have lice? So there’s nothing to stop you from getting it, say, tonight or maybe tomorrow or—”
“You’re back,” Tony states, propping one hip against the counter. “Something wrong with my license? Are you taking it back?”
Steve: Is your marriage really so unstable that the rumors a jealous coworker is spreading are enough to destabilize it entirely? Cause what I’m hearing here is that you’ve just decided that your marriage is as good as over, and maybe it is, and maybe that’s a good thing because if that is what you feel, then clearly your marriage wasn’t in the best place anyway.
Tony bring up that night? How dare he taint it like this? They were drawing attention, people poking their heads out of their offices to hear what Tony and Steve were arguing about. “You can’t just—” He couldn’t do this here. He was going to lose it. He was going to break down in a way that he hadn’t since the night Tony had left and he
There are an untold number of Steve Rogerses currently alive in Europe, and none of that matters because not once, in
“It’s not that I didn’t trust him. Well, maybe a part of it was because of that. Tony feels a lot of guilt cause of what he’s done, and every time he messes up, he tries to find someone who can steer him back in the right direction. And when we couldn’t be that someone anymore, he went and found someone who could. Unfortunately for all of us, that happened to be an organization you and I couldn’t trust, so it was hard to trust
is a sparkly rock that Tony found down by the riverbank this morning. In the sunlight, it shines with the same colors as Steve’s ice, and he thinks it makes for a very lovely courting gift.
“You’ll tell me if something is uncomfortable?” he checks. Tony nods. “You can talk. We’re going to be here a while an’ I won’t be taking any pictures of your face.”
That’s right! They were talking about the shelter. “Right!” he exclaimed. “I was thinking if we got a dog, we could call it Dodger.”
“Now, Rumlow tells me you might have heard some of the rumors about your show,” Pierce said, as though they could have somehow missed them.
This chapter is pretty much nothing but smut, so fair warning for the smut-averse ahead. Feel free to pick back up after the first line break
He doesn’t want to admit that he’s getting worried. He knows it’s destiny—everyone meets their soulmate eventually—but he’s almost thirty-eight years old, and he still hasn’t found his, and he doesn’t
Tony shrugged. “Cheaper than the garage.” He led Steve to a dark blue sports car that Steve recognized as an old birthday gift from Mrs. Stark before Tony’s dad insisted she cut all contact with their wayward son.
“I’ve never worn a romper before,” Tony says with a casual shrug that belies the tension building in his body as he watches Steve pull one of the ice cubes out of the bowl. “Wanted a chance to—
And if those aren’t enough to remind him to stay his tongue, then the thought of what will happen to Tony if he and Ana leave is more than enough.
Caller: But they’re moving! Our relationship is going to end and they didn’t even bother to talk about it with me.
Steve chuckled. “Knowing her and Vision, they’d probably figure out a way to turn it into a cute couple’s costume for
He laughed nervously. “That’s not possible. Everyone has a home here. We’d know if she didn’t have a home, wouldn’t we?”
He turned back to the stove and accidentally brushed a glass bowl off the counter as he did. They both jumped back as the bowl shattered into a million shining pieces as it hit the floor. Tony stared at it for a moment—he’d never known Steve to be so clumsy before—then turned to Steve, opening his mouth to babble out something about grabbing the broom. But Steve just blinked at the glass and continued stirring the mashed potatoes on the stove.
Steve actually doesn’t really like the house in Sweden. The home is set high in the mountains, high enough that there’s snow almost all year round. It reminds him just a little too much of the mission in the mountains where he had lost Bucky during the war, though he had always set aside his discomfort because the team absolutely
Steve is nearly to the door before something else occurs to him. “Tony, who did you want to give the list of superheroes to? You said you didn’t trust it with the UN, but you must have trusted it with someone.”
Someone had knocked on Pierce’s door before opening it just a crack. A horribly familiar voice said, “Hey, Alexander, you ready for me yet?”
Well that’s a little hurtful. What is Steve, chopped liver? Except… he knows that Tony compartmentalizes people. The vet can’t be Tony’s friend because he’s already Janet’s. Rhodey can’t be his friend because he works with Howard. Steve can’t be his friend because they’re already business partners. Steve knows why he does it: it’s an attempt at minimizing the hurt when someone does something deliberately cruel. If they weren’t friends, it won’t hurt as much, right? Not for the first time he wishes he could punch everyone who’s ever made Tony feel bad about himself.
He wants to ask, push, know what it is that Tony was going to ask, but he’s certain that Tony will shut down on him if he tries to do that. So he just nods, though he knows Tony can’t see that, and says, “Be careful.”
He means for it to be a nice gesture but Tony’s frown just deepens. “I do know what I want to do though.”
“Yeah, but heaven forbid Captain America be gay. Anyway, you haven’t left this place since Thanos died. I don’t think you can keep saying you’re from Brooklyn when you live in the middle of nowhere.”
There are a little under fifty thousand Steve Rogerses currently alive in the United States, and thirteen year-old Tony Stark has crossed off about twenty thousand of them. About seven thousand of them were born after Tony was, so that makes them impossible. The other thirteen thousand have all already met their soulmates, though Tony has to laugh at the Steve Rogers who’s coincidentally soulmated to a different Tony Stark. Like, what are the odds of
“No, I get it,” Sam agrees. “It was a bad situation. I’m just saying that she won’t go back if it means getting locked up again.”
Steve gets up, not wanting to disturb Wanda and Natasha’s celebration, and heads outside. Sam follows him. Steve leans on the balcony of their rented apartment, Sam turning so his back is pressed against the railing next to Steve. He spends a moment looking out over the city. They’re in Edinburgh this week. He’d never been there during the war, but he can’t help but hope that Dum Dum made it here. It seems like his kind of city.
There’s the faint scent of iron in the air as Tony’s emotions override his control, making the lights on the dashboard of Steve’s car flicker wildly for a moment before settling back down. This means a lot to Tony, Steve realizes. He doesn’t know how long it’s been since Tony and Justin dated but it must have really mattered to him when they broke up. He reaches out and squeezes Tony’s bicep comfortingly.
Tony wandered in, humming a song he thought he’d heard on the radio, though he was hard-pressed to remember what song talked about androids and newlyweds in the same verse. “What are you doing cooking?” he asked. “It was my turn tonight. I was going to make carbonara.”
“I’m not here to shop.” He holds up the license in its frame. “I’m Steve. I just came by to drop off Tony’s business license.”
“I’m sure you are,” Tony said with an easygoing chuckle. “He hasn’t fired anyone since Earl. His wife only prepared one course and Mr. Hart always expects at least three.”
Once, Steve thought he might have ignored a tug like that, but now, he followed it, wondering what he was thinking of. It felt—it felt like there was something locked behind a wall, like he could unlock so much if only he could get past that barrier. But something was blocking him—something insidious and terrifying and a bright scarlet red the color of blood.
“Tony’s not a dick,” Steve replied. “He’d probably let anyone stay over.” He didn’t add that the reason he never took Tony up on the offer was because
“Because,” Sam starts and then drops down heavily to sit on the bed. He leans forward, hands clasped in that counselors pose that Steve recognizes from the few times he’s attended meetings at the VA. “You know I was a double major in college?” It seems like a non sequitur but Steve waits him out. “Psychology, obviously, but also history. I had this idea of working with minorities, using cultural history to explain psychological differences or something like that. Didn’t get much further than a vague dream before Riley enlisted and I followed right after him. Point is, Ross said that he wanted to keep track of our abilities and all I heard was another 1930s Germany. I figured that’s what you heard too.”
And Steve agrees, but he doesn’t know if Bucky is ready to see anyone. Still, they shelve the discussion while he sends Shuri a message and waits for her reply. It takes two days for her to respond; Bucky evidently had asked for time to decide. But she does eventually reply, giving him an affirmative answer.
Just a quick note for y'all: people who've seen the show will recognize this chapter as the Sebastian Raine episode, only told from Steve's POV (because I will always be sad that we didn't get Patrick in that episode; still, that's why fanfic's for, right?). For anyone who's not seen the show, this chapter deals with an ex from Tony's past coming to town, duping Howard, and Tony seducing them to get the information he needs. This is fully consensual on Tony's part, though it's not something he really wants to do, and since the whole chapter is from Steve's perspective anyway, I've decided again not to use the dubcon tag. But I just wanted to keep y'all informed
“Guess that makes me feel a little better,” he says. At least it’s only the two spies. “Yeah, we’ve been talking. We’re just barely at civil, so talking about my problems with the Accords is—” He sighs heavily, “—not on the topic list yet.” But he wants them to be. He wants to be able to have a rational discussion about his reservations that isn’t just Tony giving him meaningless platitudes or telling him about the worse things the UN wanted to do to them.
as though he was just being tactile to needle Steve and not that he really had been trying to be friendly. He felt bad for a moment, but reasoned it away by reminding himself that they didn’t touch. He didn’t need to explain himself to Tony.
Tony runs a hand over U’s crushed pincer and winces. U ended up getting nearly flattened by some of the Malibu mansion’s foundations when it crumbled into the ocean. The bot’s going to need not only a new personality chip, but new struts, new wheels, new
He wants to ask about the clean mouth comment but Tony clearly isn’t paying any attention to him. And even if he is, it’s more fun to bug Tony by not asking when Tony clearly wants him to. Instead he just lifts the water bottle to his lips and drinks, trying not to think that Tony had his mouth right where Steve’s is now. He doesn’t quite manage it though, especially not once he notices that Tony is openly staring at him.
Like this, with Tony so close, the subtle scent of his cologne permeating Steve’s senses and overwhelming him—he never thought he’d be able to get this close again. He’d thought he’d ruined his chances at something more with Tony the moment he ran. And maybe at one time, that was true. But Tony’s right. They

impatient. He doesn’t know what Natasha wants. It could be important (it could be completely unimportant too, but he doesn’t know that) and she can’t possibly know that he’s going to meet Tony, so she wouldn’t know that he’s in a hurry.
As soon as he gets in, he sits down at his desk and pulls up the files on business grants. He’s been thinking about all that product Tony has that he needs to sell and how Tony is actively losing money every time his sister uses one of his products. There has to be a way for Tony to get more startup money, he knows it.
For as long as they had been working together, getting a drink together had been their code for sex. It had started back after their one-hundredth episode, when they’d gone out for a celebratory drink together and wound up back at Tony’s place, half their clothes torn off before they even made it through the front door. That had been the only time he’d spent the night at Tony’s, too frightened by the soft look in Tony’s eyes the next morning to ever risk it again. Tony had offered to make breakfast, Steve had insisted that it could never happen again, and that had been the end of it—at least, it had until two weeks later when they’d found themselves at the same bar. At the end of the night, fucked out and exhausted, Steve had laid down the boundaries of the new development of their working relationship as Tony tried to convince him to stay the night again. Tony had eventually agreed, and Steve had thought that was it.
over, but Tony has never once complained, only just made easygoing jokes about bulls in china shops and told him that the pipes are built to withstand forces a lot stronger than Steve. It had gone a long way toward helping him feel comfortable in the space and now he spends a lot of time down here, talking with Tony about the mechanics of the ship, even though a lot of it goes over his head.
“Aye,” Thor says, brightening up. “It’s for my Jane’s birthday. While I think she’ll like my gift—” He winks and Steve, who knows that the gift in the bag is a potion for virility and stamina, winces. “—I believe that the gift receipt is a good idea, just in case.”
Steve waited, half-expecting Tony to invite him out for drinks once their show was over like he always did. But Tony just fluttered his fingers in a little wave and turned, heading in the direction of his office. Stunned, Steve stood there for a moment. He couldn’t remember the last time Tony hadn’t invited him out. Steve didn’t always take him up on the offer, but that had never stopped him. What was going on with Tony?
“So what do you want to do instead? Most of the kids are gone. Some ass went around and stole all the candy so most of the families packed up and went to the festival.”
“You’re damn right I stopped it,” Tony says. “I—hopefully you can understand that I don’t want anyone else to know where the Sentinels are, but no one can get to them.”
can do magic tricks. Anyway, I’m stopping by the neighborhood watch meeting before the show. Wanda and I heard some strange noises last night. You two haven’t heard anything strange, have you?”
Captain America raises his head and looks at him. Even from this distance, Tony can see his wide eyes. “That was
Steve snorted. It was so like Tony to be completely irreverent while they were discussing something so serious. When they were dating, it was something that had irritated him—that Tony seemingly couldn’t take anything seriously—but now that he was older, now that he wasn’t personally invested in how seriously Tony took something, it was more amusing than grating. Tony grinned at him and winked.
When asked later, Steve will say that the night passes in a blur. There’s Tony’s hand in his and there’s winning Tony that bear at the balloon dart game (Steve has always had near perfect aim and it plays to his favor now) and there’s Tony’s warmth pressed up against his side on the ferris wheel and it’s all wonderful. By the time they’re driving home late that night, Steve is hard-pressed to remember a more perfect night.
,” Tony pointed out, laughing as he ran his hands through Steve’s hair. But when Steve pulled away to look up at him, it was to see that Tony had indeed opened his eyes and was looking at him with a soft expression.
“Hi,” Tony replies calmly like there’s nothing strange about this. He passes first Sam and then Steve plates. Steve surreptitiously pokes his omelet, wondering if it’s actually edible. Tony isn’t exactly known for his stellar skills in the kitchen. But the omelet doesn’t look either burnt or undercooked, and Sam is shoveling his down like it’s his last meal, so Steve cautiously takes a bite of his. It’s surprisingly delicious. Tony must have learned how to cook over the last few years, since he and Pepper broke up and the rest of the team moved out of the tower.
“No,” Tony disagrees. “When everyone you’ve shared a bed with says they don’t want to share a bed with you, you learn to concede the point.”
By the time Tony gets back, Steve’s already burrowed beneath the covers, Dummy sleeping on the pillow next to his face, which is definitely nerve-wracking. That cat still hasn’t warmed up to him. He’s not sure it won’t try to claw his face off in the middle of the night. Steve perks up when Tony walks in though. Dummy always behaves for Tony.
He heard the front door open and looked over from where he was lounging on the couch, mindlessly watching some show he didn’t recognize. There was an odd look on Steve’s face that Tony didn’t like—troubled and worried all at the same time.
“Well, darling,” Tony said, yawning. He stood and stretched, revealing a thin strip of skin under his t-shirt. “I’m going to head on back to my office. See you this evening?”
Tony shrugged. “I did, but you know me, I fall a little in love with everyone I bring home. I’ll get over it. At least this way, I can get dicked down while I’m getting over them.”
“Right. Ah—sort of,” he says, remembering that they were talking about U’s ability to feel pain. “It’s not—he doesn’t feel pain like we do—or at least, I assume you feel pain. Did the serum take that away too? Never mind, not important, we can talk about the serum later. Anyway, it doesn’t
Steve’s breath hitches at the implication that Tony is his family. It’s something that he doesn’t even let himself think when he’s alone, never mind speaking it aloud. It feels too much like a claim on Tony that he doesn’t get to have, not after everything that’s happened between them.
And that—that sounds pretty damn nice actually. “Okay,” he says, kicks off his own shoes, and climbs into the other side of the bed. Tony rolls over to face him, gives him another small smile, and closes his eyes. Within minutes, he’s asleep, soft breaths puffing out from his slightly open mouth
. Falling back into bed together isn’t convenient, it’s punishing yourself. And worse—you’re punishing Tony. I know he fucked up when you guys were dating, but using him so that you don’t have to find someone else is shitty.”
and secondly, neither of them would ever do that to Aunt Peggy), but there’s something about him that keeps drawing Tony back.
—the wheel turns, protesting the entire way. Eventually, he gets it open, letting another blast of heat into the engine room. Tony tosses the stardust in. It flares in the heat of the converter, setting off beautiful gold and purple sparks. Steve closes the door. It closes a lot easier than it opened. Tony hums thoughtfully at it.
“You know, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”
“Thanks,” he said, giving Tony a soft smile. Tony brightened—how had Steve missed how worried he’d looked that his gesture might be taken the wrong way?—and nodded right as the On Air light turned on.
He thinks about his secret meetings with Tony and how they were able to rationally discuss the Accords during their last one. She’s half-right at least. He’s not ready to sign yet, but a few more conversations with Tony and he might be. He thinks he might do just about anything to be able to go home and have Tony smile at him the way he used to.
left. And Steve would pick himself up again, only it would be easier this time. It wouldn’t hurt like it had last time.
“Erotica in Art,” Steve clarifies, leading Tony deeper into the apartment. “An’ I guess everyone thinks that means I’m going to fuck the model or something cause all the department models I asked looked at me like I was crazy for asking ‘em an’ turned me down flat.”
He could keep arguing. But Tony sounds like this is something that’s been bothering him for a while, and Steve knows him well enough that he knows it’ll keep eating away at him if it’s not absolved now. If Steve can help him with that misplaced guilt, then that’s what he wants to do.
for all the damage that had happened here when it was clearly not their fault, he was going to pitch a
“And then we’re no worse off than where we started,” Tony agrees. He looks over at Sam. “Would that be enough for you?”
“Oh I don’t have a wife!” Tony said cheerily. He turned the picture of him and Steve on their wedding day around and showed it to Vision. “This is my husband, Steve.”
was one of the only dating advice radio shows out there, something that had only boosted its popularity as people with no other similar shows to listen to had tuned in in addition to the people listening for specifically Steve and Tony, and it had proven to be extremely profitable over the last three years. Cancelling it wasn’t in Pierce’s best interest.
“Yeah. Professor X says it’s a genetic mutation—the X-gene—that causes superpowers. Just think, if you’d had the X-gene, maybe you wouldn’t have needed the serum. Maybe
“Which is why I’m worrying about it now.” Tony takes a sip of the coffee and beams down at it. “You remembered,” he murmurs.
He hasn’t known Tony very long, but he knows enough to know that Tony frequently bites off more than he can chew and refuses to admit it until he absolutely has to. He’s gotten a couple texts like these and gone in anyway just in case, only to find out that Tony definitely needed help but hadn’t wanted to bother him to ask.
“Hey, Shellhead,” Uncle Grant says warmly, and Tony smiles. He’s never figured out why Uncle Grant calls him that, but he likes it. “How’s the search going?”
“Sorry, Tones,” Steve said, and he did sound sorry, but Tony knew better. He groaned again and slumped against the bannister as Steve called back, “Be right there!” Steve gave him a quick kiss. “Maybe when I’m done with this kid?”
“Yeah, I like him too,” Tony agrees. He grins and climbs to his feet. There’s a few feet between his bed and Rhodey’s, plenty of space to pull DUM-E up and avoid his own feet if he’s careful. He braces himself on his bed and hauls the bot up, using all his strength to pull DUM-E off the bed. He’s only had DUM-E for a few weeks, but he can already tell that the bot is going to end up giving him some impressive arm strength if he keeps tripping over things.
Steve tries very hard to hide his smile behind his hand as he puts his pen down, not wanting Tony to think that he’s laughing at him. He’s been doing this kind of thing for the last thirteen years and he’s never run into
He stops. Blinks. Tilts his head curiously. Pepper grins knowingly at him and returns to her spreadsheets. She’s convinced that Obie is embezzling money from SI. Tony, who grew up with Obie, is pretty sure she’s seeing things that aren’t really there, but he likes Pepper a lot and she’s Rhodey’s soulmate, so he’s willing to let her look. Hey, it’s better to be overcautious and find out that there’s nothing there than to tell her there’s nothing to worry about and find out five years down the line that they’ve been dealing under the table, right?
Tony smiles softly and takes the card, rubbing his thumb over Steve’s name. “That’s pretty cool. I don’t know a lot of those.”
He hears a low whinny and wriggles with delight. A whinny means that that ridiculous water horse is back, which isn’t great, since honestly, Tony would be perfectly happy if that horse would never return to the Forest. But, it also means, more importantly, that Steve is back from his weekly visit to Arendelle. Tony’s smaller salamander form isn’t very fast, but he’s still only a few steps behind Natasha to greet Steve as he pulls up in front of the human camp.
“I can’t talk to you about this right now,” Tony says abruptly, standing. His chair screeches along the floor, making Steve wince. He leaves, one of the Dora Milaje following him at a glance from the king.
There was a disquieting feeling in the pit of his stomach as he looked at the coffee. It was nice, what Tony had done, but was it too close to what he used to do? Was this yet another attempt at getting Steve back, even after Steve had explicitly told him it was never going to happen? But Tony didn’t deserve his distrust. He’d been nothing but honest the entire time with Steve. It was his own fault that he’d misunderstood what Tony was doing. He didn’t deserve Steve snapping at him for doing something nice. He knew that Tony liked to get things for people, knew that was how he demonstrated affection, not just for Steve but for everyone he liked. It didn’t mean anything romantic, no matter how Steve’s brain took it.
Trying to move on from that awkward moment, he says, “Here’s an easy one for you: a brief description of the business.”
Steve smiled at him as a wave of color washed over the two of them. Tony’s brown eyes sparkled in the light pouring in from the light next to the couch. “Me too,” he said and leaned in for a kiss.
Six months later, Steve steps off the quinjet, his team following him, to greet the Accords committee waiting for them at a small folding table off to the side of the landing platform with four copies of the Accords waiting for their signatures. Bucky signed a week ago, having decided to stay in Wakanda for the time being. The committee steps forward, passing the four of them their copies. Sam’s copy, Steve notices, is considerably lighter, as he won’t be joining the team as a full member for a while, if ever. Steve glances behind the committee to see an older man in a wheelchair—that would be Professor Xavier then, going off of Tony’s descriptions, here to take Wanda back to his school so she can get the training she deserves. And standing beside him—
Hugging Tony is … an experience, there’s no better way to put it. He smells nice, like magic and cinnamon rolls, and he’s warm and he fits just about perfectly into Steve’s arms. He wants to have this all the time, even though he knows Tony deserves better than someone who’s still trying to figure himself out, who took almost thirty years to figure out he’s gay.
“The way we run it,” Tony stated, eyes narrowing. “We don’t run it any differently than any other relationship show out there.”
He luxuriates in the feeling for only a few moments though before he rises back up on his knees. Tony’s hands fall away back to his head. Steve pauses to take in the sight of him: nipples flushed red, trails of ice water crossing his chest and stomach, a contented look in his eyes. He’s still as beautiful as he was the day Steve first met him; not for the first time, he marvels that out of all the people Tony could have chosen, he’d chosen
as well. Tony is reminded of the problem of Theseus’ ship. Is it still U if he has to replace everything about it?
“Undecided,” Steve repeats, wondering why on earth Tony would come to file his incorporation papers if he doesn’t even have a name for the business.
Tony’s eyes turn dark and heated. He slinks closer to Steve, runs his fingers up Steve’s chest, and purrs, “Or I’ll shut it for you.”
Before either Steve or Betty could respond, the intercom in the studio came on with a loud screech, making all three of them wince. “You’re late is what you are,” Rumlow snapped from the broadcasting studio. Steve bit back a groan. He didn’t like to say that he hated working with any of the sound technicians, considering they were the ones who made sure they made it to broadcast, but he hated working with Rumlow, who was arrogant and easily irritated. “Are we paying you to talk or to work?”
—she’s still fussing and refusing to even have her bath, let alone go down for the night. Tony’s pretty sure it’s because he was gone on a business trip for most of the last few weeks, especially after Steve had confided in him that she was perfectly well behaved the entire time he was gone, and now she thinks she can get away with anything since he’s missed her, but she’s wrong.
Dottie ruled the neighborhood with an iron fist, Steve and Tony both knew that. There was no point in arguing openly with her when they could offer comfort in other smaller ways instead. Something about that rang false in Steve’s mind—he had the strangest feeling that he should be shouting her down about her tyranny—but as quickly as the thought appeared, it was gone again. He gently touched Wanda’s shoulder as she passed him, looking shamefaced and concerned all at the same time.
“What? Oh, no, sorry, I got distracted helping Herb with the yard,” Steve said. Tony smiled fondly. That was his husband alright, always trying to help other people. He had one of the most generous hearts Tony had ever known and it was one of the first things that had caught his eye when he’d met Steve all those years ago. “Sweetheart, I was talking with Agnes and she said something—something strange.”
Sometimes, Steve glances up from the cash register to where Tony is helping a customer. Tony always seems to know when Steve is looking at him because without fail, every time he looks back over at Steve. They share a mutual look of baffled wonderment—he’d known that Tony had a good idea with the store, but even he hadn’t expected this level of popularity—before they both go back to their work.
It still looks like Tony is going to refuse and turn, but then Tony surprises him by saying, “Okay.”
because of that. But that wasn’t all of it. I knew it was going to be a lot harder for him to run than it was for the rest of us. Tony isn’t someone you just hide. But he really seemed like he wanted to help, so I took that chance and told him where you and Barnes went. Clearly, that backfired on all of us, but my point is—I did trust him too.”
And then, for the first time all day, Steve is left alone. He tilts his head back, massaging out the pain in his temples. When he’d moved to town, he’d taken this job because it’s what he’s familiar with and Luis was willing to offer him a room in exchange for the job, but he’s got to find something else to do. He just can’t get any work done like this.
Laughter sounded again, much closer that time and continuing for much longer than Tony felt the joke needed. He wanted to look around but found himself nodding instead as though it was fine (it
Steve, whose two best friends had hated each other until Tony had set them up and now they were married, shrugged and said, “He’s okay.”
Steve awakens alone in the bed. He looks at the cold, empty spot beside him sadly. He should have expected this, he knows. Tony risked a lot by coming to their safehouse, having no way of knowing when Sam would be coming back or even if Steve would be alone at all when he arrived. It makes sense that he’s already left. He probably left hours ago before the sun had even started to
Tony doesn’t argue anymore, just moves over. Rhodey climbs up beside him and tucks Tony into his side. Slowly, the tension bleeds out of Tony’s body as he relaxes against Rhodey’s side. Rhodey lifts a hand and strokes it through Tony’s soft hair.
The door opens, just a crack, and Tony’s small face peeks around the corner. He looks worried and perhaps a little scared, and Peggy’s heart breaks a little. No child should ever look like this.
To his consternation, Captain America doesn’t immediately listen to him. Instead, he says, “You know, Fury warned me people would say things like that, but I didn’t think it would happen this quickly.”
It only takes two more strokes before Steve comes, whining loudly as he spills over Tony’s stomach and red silk alike. He slumps forward, only remembering at the last second to roll to the side so that he doesn’t crush Tony beneath him.
“Possibly Thor’s. I’ll bet Goat Steve picks fights with every goat that looks at him wrong. Probably does a lot of headbutting.”
Tony shakes his head. “You were always the only person I’d ever trust with that list. You still are.”
“Hey, you know, it’s not like I knew what the store was going to look like,” he protests good-naturedly. “I’ll have you know I have an art degree, as well as the MBA.”
“Oh.” Tony rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly. “You—you didn’t. It’s just—it’s your birthday next week and I know they usually come see you for a few days and since you were starting to look impatient, I figured they must be arriving today.”
love this person and you want to be with them. So now it’s time to ask yourself what does being with them look like? Does it mean you quit your job and move with them? Does it mean that they turn down their job offer and stay with you? Or what about a long-distance relationship?”
He hopes, though, that it has something to do with the way Steve smiles at him sometimes, shy and a little thoughtful, mostly because Tony sometimes smiles at
“Ew, too hot,” Tony grumbles and starts to push away from Steve’s hold, only to give up and snuggle back in. Steve hides a smile in Tony’s hair. He knows his husband, knows how much Tony likes to be held after sex, come heat or cold or whatever else.
On one of his circuits, Steve screeched to a halt at the window, distracted by something going on across the street. “Huh,” he commented, tilting his head to the side in an attempt to get a better view.
“Good, cause, you know, some people don’t know that and—it’s not like Janet does it deliberately, and it really hurts her when people assume she has to use her abilities to get dates. She really tries not to but she ended up missing the whole part of her classes about learning how to use them because she was in Libya and it was this whole thing. Anyway, she’s catching up on most of the classes she missed in high school, but there’s only one school in the world that works with succubi and that’s in France, and well. We obviously can’t afford to send her to France these days so—”
It has the intended effect. Tony lets out a wet little laugh and hugs Steve tighter for a brief moment before letting go. They go back to setting up products, Steve holding the box as Tony grabs things out of it to put on the shelves.
He opened the door with a loud, “Honey, I’m home!” the way he’d heard on the show they watched a few nights ago.
“No, not at all!” the man exclaimed. “Just glad to have a normal job in this normal town. Me, a normal person—I’m glad to have the job.”
“Hey, Tony, why don’t you run out to grab lunch for all of us?” Steve suggests. That’ll give him time to talk to Natasha about the room situation.
“Yeah,” Steve agrees. At least they hadn’t dissolved into arguing a few minutes in. He watches Tony go, still mulling over Tony’s words:
that’s a bad idea, and then there’s a blast coming from the gauntlet. He ducks immediately after firing; if he misses, he doesn’t want the angry god to know who was trying to hit him. Fuck but he hopes he doesn’t hit Captain America. That’d be embarrassing—“Hi, I think I’m your soulmate, sorry about hitting you with an untested flight stabilizer.”
Tony clearly seizes on the distraction, judging by the way his eyes light up and he exclaims, “Yes!” He holds it up and shakes the bag. “Thank you.”
Steve asked, nearly choking on the words. God, it was like a nightmare, like he’d stepped into one of those horrible dreams he’d had every night in the months following their breakup. Tony couldn’t seriously be asking what Steve thought he was—
Steve still looks unsure, but he obligingly pushes his sleeve cuff up, revealing Tony’s name right there on his wrist. Tony exhales, relief flooding through him. It’s real. This is
Tony bailed him out of jail the next morning, informed him that he’d apparently blackmailed his dad into dropping the court case against Steve, and told him that if he ever brought any of that night up ever again, Tony would personally see to it that Steve never saw daylight again. Steve, who’d gotten a glimpse under the curtain, nodded along until Tony ran out of breath and then hugged him. It took almost thirty seconds for Tony to relax enough to hug him back and Steve’s heart had broken a little at the implication.
, if that’s okay with you. It looked like there were storm clouds gathering earlier and I don’t really want to go out later in the middle of a thunderstorm because your dog isn’t potty trained.”
She speeds through her bath and brushing her teeth. Normally, Tony would insist that she go back and brush them again, but at this point, almost an hour past her bedtime, he’d just like to get her to go to sleep.
“Oh, so cruel!” Tony laughed. He kissed Steve again. “Thanks for the reminder about the florist. I’ve got such a smart husband.”
“But how many of those people would have shown up without the discount?” Tony shoots back immediately.
had Tony picked up a coffee for himself but not for Steve if he was running late anyway? Well, nothing for it. He placed an order to the coffeeshop down the street—not nearly as good as the place Tony went to, but acceptable—and groaned at the estimated delivery time. It was going to be a
“No one’s going to want to drive all the way to the suburbs just to drive you back into the city. You’ll be waiting all night,” Tony huffed, crossing his arms. Steve looked away. “I get it. You don’t want to share a bed with me, but at least sleep on the couch. Or I can sleep on the couch and you can take the bed. Just don’t leave.”
doesn’t seem so impossible. It’s okay that it took him this long to figure out he’s attracted to men, cause it led him right here, to this moment.
“Yeah,” Steve replies. He crosses his arms, trying not to hunch. He has no reason to be defensive. Tony should have been expecting this all along. He couldn’t really have thought that Steve would just leave him frozen. “Shuri and one of the Dora Milaje have been working with him.”
“Are you sure I should go to this?” he asks. “Wouldn’t it seem like I’m endorsing it if I go? It’s not an official musical.” His publicist had been very firm about that point when they’d first found out about the musical. Steve hadn’t given his approval, so it was really more of a fan-made production that just happened to get a spot on Broadway.
He was used now to the stretch of the cock inside him, and he wanted to move just as badly as Tony wanted him to, so he rose up and dropped himself back down, moaning in unison with Tony. He set a fast pace, fast and hard. It wasn’t Tony’s preferred pace; he usually liked to take things slower, drag them out until Steve was begging for him (once, Steve had liked that too, but he couldn’t let himself have those anymore, couldn’t let himself get used to that), but Tony wasn’t in charge today. Steve was, and today he wanted it hard.
“Since when do you believe in being on time?” Steve teases, thinking that maybe that Tony needs something to lighten the mood.
He glances at Sam, who shrugs as well and puts his fork down. “Wanted to ask what was still holding me up on the Accords.”
Tony was already waiting in the production studio with their interviewee, Betty Ross, more commonly known as Dear Elizabeth. He looked up when Steve entered the studio, offering him a tight smile that felt in line with how Tony had been acting that morning. Clearly he wasn’t over whatever had him acting odd earlier. Maybe he wasn’t feeling well. Steve felt a brief urge to see if Tony would let him bring over some soup—Tony had always liked his Ma’s chicken soup recipe—but brushed it aside as quickly as it appeared. They weren’t like that anymore, and besides, he’d told himself he wasn’t going to get further entangled with Tony than he already was. That was the ground rule he’d set for himself when they’d started sleeping together. No feelings, no entanglements, that was the best way to avoid setting himself up for getting hurt again.
, as though being someone’s friend wasn’t enough of a benefit, but that was pretty much exactly what she was. Tony stiffened, looking past Steve’s shoulder as he nodded. Steve ignored the guilty pang in his heart. He knew how much Tony hated hearing about the other people he slept with, but it wasn’t as though Tony had any claim to Steve’s heart.
They never did go back to cleaning. What they had seen had rattled them too much. Nothing like that ever happened in Westview, and to have watched it happen in front of them had felt like a rude awakening from their idyllic suburban life. Steve didn’t even understand it. Had this always been happening right under their noses? Had they missed other cues?
falling into bed. At least Steve had managed to stay firm on just being casual. He’d sworn never to take a chance on Tony again. He’d learned his lesson, and no matter how many times Tony asked him out to dinner or invited him to stay after a night together, that wasn’t going to change. It might have gotten harder to refuse over the years, but he knew better now. Nothing had changed since college.
Steve all but dives for it, casting a furtive look at Sam asleep in the next bed. The team doesn’t know about the phone he sent Tony and Sam is the only one who knows about the letter. He’d said it was a bad idea, that Tony might use it to track them down. But Sam doesn’t know Tony like he does. Tony wouldn’t do something like that.
“Janet, why am I smelling roses?” Tony shouts from the back, voice getting louder as he walks into the main room. “What are you—oh.”
Tony hated that look on his face. He got up and moved around the couch, taking Steve into his arms. “Stop worrying about it, darling,” he said, stretching up to give Steve a quick kiss. “Geraldine is fine. Agnes was probably just jealous that Wanda’s been spending so much time with Geraldine so she made up some silly rumor. You’ll see, it’ll be gone by tomorrow.”
To her surprise, Tony’s piercing wails cut off right before she reaches his room. Perhaps irrationally, Maria picks up the pace, fearing the worst. Her Tony, her bright boy, cries so often—to be so suddenly quiet must mean that something is
been building toward something, have been since Tony first reached out to him on that horrible flip phone that Steve sent because he couldn’t resist needling Tony like he used to.
And yet—Steve loved their show. He loved their booth with the letters from fans taped up on the backside of the door. He loved the mugs that Pierce had gotten them for their one-hundredth show with the show’s logo printed on the side. He could feel the anger start to drain out of him as soon as he sat down in his chair. He put his headphones on and tested the microphone. Tony wasn’t there yet, but that wasn’t surprising. While he was always on time to their shows, he was rarely early unless they had a guest speaker that he was showing around the station.
Five minutes later, when he still can’t sleep for the heat, he finally adds, “Fine, but we’re leaving tomorrow. And you have to promise never to break our A/C again.”
He turned back to the bed just as the lamp on the nightstand clicked on, revealing Tony leaning up on one elbow, his other hand sleepily rubbing his eyes. Steve bit back a wince. He’d always thought Tony was adorable when he was tired—and he probably always would—but that line of thinking led to trouble.
They have a good day, productive, busy, and Tony’s smiling again, so that’s something at least, even if he
After a long minute, or maybe it’s a few days, another seventy years could have passed by while Steve was kissing Tony and he wouldn’t have noticed, they pull away. Tony’s eyes are bright and shining. Steve can feel the words on the tip of his tongue, but this isn’t the time for love confessions. Not when this is so new, when they still have so far to go.
He loves that boy, loves him as much as he would his own son. He and Ana helped raise him; he means as much to them as he does to Maria, and rather more than he does to Howard. There isn’t a thing in the world Jarvis wouldn’t do for him, even if means staying in this mansion longer than he’d like.
The words make Steve more than a little nervous, but to his surprise, Tony doesn’t go for any of the wine in the fridge. Instead, he heads for the coffeemaker, tossing over his shoulder, “You want a cup?”
Tony’s look of innocence can better be described as the cat who got the cream, the canary, and the whole tin of tuna. “Well, maybe someone pointed her in the right direction, but it clearly wasn’t me. I’ve been here for the last four days since the committee session broke. Anyway, King Kitty Cat has been calling for Ross’ arrest since Shuri made his files public. Looks like he put enough pressure on the committee to agree.”
“Yeah, him,” Tony says quickly. “He insisted I put the Stark name on the business so now I obviously can’t use that.”
“Uh, she said something came up at the motel,” Tony says. He looks distracted and a little nervous. Steve can’t help but wonder what Natasha said to him. Did she tell Tony about his feelings? She wouldn’t do that, would she? She has to know that’s something he wanted to confess on his own… Right?
“Once upon a time, there was a princess who woke from a one-hundred year sleep,” he begins, only to stop when Tony frowns. He mumbles something that Steve takes to mean as that’s not how the story begins. “I know that’s not how it begins. This is the next part in the story.” Tony hums and settles back down, which Steve takes as permission to continue. “Once upon a time, there was a princess who woke from a one-hundred year sleep. The prince who woke her hadn’t expected her to wake up, so he didn’t know what to do with her and he left her alone. The princess felt very lost in this new time period.”
Steve stares dubiously at the sparkly tickets for Rogers: The Musical in his hands—he hadn’t even known they
They arrive in Wakanda a few days later with one of the Dora Milaje as their escort. She isn’t a talkative sort of person, but Steve doesn’t think he’s met a single Dora who is. The most he knows about her, though Natasha tries to draw more out of her, is that her name is Yama and she’s served as a Dora most of her life. She nods politely at them once they land and disappears down the ramp without another word.
He trades off on the ropes, the lingerie, and the locations as the hours drag on, first the gold ropes and the silver lingerie on the pillow and then putting Tony in a pink nightie for a few pictures on the couch and the red ropes and a green thong back on the pillow and on and on and on. Tony is even willing to let him take a couple shots on Steve’s bed (black panties and red ropes), and fuck, but Steve doesn’t think he’ll ever be able to get that image out of his head of Tony looking up at him from twisted blankets in a rope dress. He really hopes Tony is up for doing this again without the camera.
He thinks about it for a moment, then begins, “Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tony—”
Steve: Okay, let’s take a few steps back. I think what we’re confused about here is that this is a friends with benefits situation. You’re not promised to each other. You’re not dating. Presumably, you’re friends, but even then, that doesn’t give you any say in what they do with their life.
“You don’t trust him?” Steve asks, eyes following the swish of the Dora’s coat as she turns the corner.
“Oh no, darling,” Tony laughed, getting up and extending a hand to Steve. “You’re going to join me.”
Tony, trusted him not to pull some stunt like he had today, trusted him not to remind him of what they could have had if only Tony hadn’t taken that job. Instead, Tony had done just that and taken what few pieces of Steve’s heart weren’t shattered and stomped on them.
“Oh please, like you didn’t see this coming when I’ve been trying to get you to go out with me for all three years.”
during their episodes—not the way they used to be—but they bantered a lot and shot barbless jabs at each other that everyone had said was due to unresolved sexual tension (if they only knew).
“I think crawfish are kinda hard to find around here, Sam,” Steve said, hiding a grin behind his hand.
Steve decides not to ask. Tony will tell him when he’s ready, probably in the car since he’s so insistent on Steve joining him for the vendor runs. “Alright, half an hour then, sound good?”
Sure enough, Tony huffs out a laugh, even though he mutters, “Since Howard decided to start in on all this bullshit.”
Tony’s smile faded, and he looked Steve straight in the eye. “Steve, I’m not that much of a glutton for punishment—”
“Seriously? What did you think those invitations for dinner were if not dates? Do you honestly think I’d let just anyone stay the night? I don’t even let Pepper stay over and I’ve known her as long as I’ve known you. I—Steve, the very first night we did this, I told you I wanted to try again.”
When he still didn’t get an answer, he sighed heavily and stomped to the garage, throwing the door open as he shouted, “
There’s a skeptical look in his husband’s eyes, but he doesn’t ask if Steve is sure, which he appreciates.
Tony nods. “After… everything, they added an amendment about what to do if the Accords are violated. Clint and Lang will have to stand trial for what they did at the airport—you all will, actually, if you want to come back—and they still have to either sign or go into retirement but yeah, if they want to go home, they can.”
“Steve?” Tony asks again. “I’m sorry, I know you’re not—” He sighs. “I’ll see you in thirty minutes.”
Steve frowns. They’d been planning on him doing some of the unpacking at the store while Tony handles the vendor runs. Tony’s better with people anyway and knowing himself, Steve would probably manage to somehow talk the vendors into upping their prices, despite only needing to do pickups today. “Tony…”
,” Steve said in a high-pitched falsetto that didn’t sound anything like Dottie’s voice, but got Tony to laugh. “You know we have to go. She notes who doesn’t show up every year and makes life miserable for them for the next year”
“Yeah, I heard Tony came by to file his papers,” Rhodey says from beside him and Steve jumps about a foot in the air.
“But now, you gave me a gift,” Tony says, picking his new rock back up. “Steve, I don’t understand. You’ve been hiding in the human village for weeks, you won’t talk to me, you won’t even
He wants to protest, point out that Bucky wouldn’t have to fight if he came back to New York, but he can’t promise that. New York is a lot more visible than this small village. If Bucky came back, even if all he did was stay in the Compound, Steve can’t promise that he wouldn’t be pressured into fighting again as reporters clamored to know why he wasn’t fighting with the Avengers. He doesn’t want to force anyone into having to do something they don’t want to, and he knows Bucky wouldn’t blame him, but he doesn’t want to put him in that position in the first place. And Bucky looks happy here. He’s clearly built a life here with his goats and his home and the knitting Steve spots in the corner near his bed.
“Wasn’t my fault we were so busy with your robot last year that we forgot to buy presents. Now shut up and listen to the story.”
“Luis!” he calls, hoping that Luis is here and can pass him the phone so he doesn’t have to leave the eggs. No luck. The house is silent.
Steve has his suspicions about just who this visitor is, only to be confirmed when they enter the throne room and he spots Tony quietly talking with the Queen Mother. “Tony,” he exhales, not sure if he’s relieved or worried. It’s great to see Tony again, but it can’t be good news that brought them to Wakanda at the same time, and T’Challa
Tony is going to sleep in his bed. Tony is going to sleep in his clothes, and they’re maybe going to cuddle. Suddenly, things don’t seem so impossible anymore.
“You said that when you were putting up the shelves last week too and I came in to find you straining to hold one up from falling on you, so you’ll have to forgive me if I didn’t believe you.”
He groans as he leans back in his chair and stretches, his back popping as he straightens up from the crouch Luis’s chair puts him in. He now has twenty-five voicemails from Tony and for all that he actually kind of likes Tony (in spite of his disorganization), he is not looking forward to them. Honestly, he’d like to just take the rest of the day off, head upstairs to his room, and read whatever’s left on Luis’s bookshelf that he hasn’t already read, but he knows he needs to deal with this first and he’s got too much responsibility to put it off. He presses play on the first message.
. She doesn’t think she can hear another one of those, not without doing something drastic, so she quickly adds, “I’ll even tell you a bedtime story, hmm? How does that sound?”
It’s not the first time he’s heard the number, but it might be the first time it really sinks in. This had never been like SHIELD, one shady government organization with its own agenda that changed depending on who Fury was talking to. This had been well over half the countries in the world, all managing to agree on this one thing: the Avengers need to be put in check. And he hadn’t even managed to listen long enough to hear them out.
caught Steve’s attention. “What?” he asked, looking up from the stove. Tony moved aside so he could see the calendar, which read
“What kind of strange?” Tony asked, kneeling up on the couch so he could look over the back of it without having to twist.
As if to emphasize what he’s saying, U makes a sad, drawn-out beep. It sounds almost strained, and Tony’s face falls as he pats his injured bot.
“A salad, huh?” Steve asks, dropping his bags in the hall. He rolls up his own sleeves and takes his place next to Tony, who moves away as soon as he takes up the knife. Steve watches out of the corner of his eye as Tony checks on some sort of sauce on the stove, stirring it twice before smiling and putting a lid on top of it as he turns the heat to low. Tony looks tired again but he’s moving easier than he was the last time they saw each other. “Didn’t take you for the salad type of person.”
He leans forward and breathes, “Please,” over Tony’s lips before kissing him deeply. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Tony’s hands twitch like he wants to reach for Steve, but they obediently stay where Steve put them. He rewards his husband by licking his way into Tony’s mouth, letting him taste the orange cream frosting he had been preparing before the power went out. The frosting and cupcakes both are stored in the fridge now; hopefully, they won’t go bad before the power in the fridge turns back on.
Ana Jarvis is standing in the middle of the room, holding Tony in her arms. She bounces the boy up and down a little bit, pressing his head against her shoulder, as she murmurs, “The table were set beautifully. Great food was piled up high. ‘But wait—no one is eating!’ The rabbi wondered, ‘Why?’”
“Sorry,” he said, suddenly wishing they could afford a single bed like one of those fancy couples up in New York. He hated being so far away from his husband when he was so out of sorts. “What were you asking?”
“I was thinking,” Tony repeats. “We’ve been building toward something, haven’t we? All these talks, these secret meetings, they mean something. Don’t they?”
Tony frowned and checked the clock. Steve sighed, already knowing what was coming. Tony made the same offer every time, clearly hoping that one day, Steve would take him up on it. “Steve, it’s two in the morning. Come back to bed.”
And the plot thickens! Please remember to check the updated tags for anyone who might have a problem with outside homophobia.
“And you thought we’d ever want to sign something like that?” Steve asks, unimpressed and more than a little horrified.
to lose hope—but it’s rough every time JARVIS sends him a notification that he’s crossed one off the list because yet another Steve has found their soulmate. He’s happy for them, really he is, but he’d like to know where
“Well, that’s okay,” he says, turning his attention back to his coding. “I’ll just finish the story when you wake back up again.”
“What are you doing?” Tony asks confusedly as he puts the car in park. “Oh gods, this is when you murder me, isn’t it? I knew I should have listened to Nat when she said you’re secretly an axe murderer.”
To his delight, Tony laughs. “I think that’s the worst line you’ve used yet,” Tony informs him. In retaliation, Steve swipes the rapidly melting ice cube over his nipple, making Tony jump and then moan. He arches, pressing forward into the ice.
Steve frowned. That—that couldn’t be right. Babies didn’t just magically age ten years overnight. Tony had to be misremembering it, getting Wanda’s boys mixed up with someone else’s kids. That was the only logical explanation. And yet… As Steve thought about it, he could remember—rain falling indoors, a black and white lamp… Tony, young and beautiful and not Steve’s at all. And—
She smirks at him. “Yes, Tony and I had sex a few times right after he first moved to town. What’s the big deal? Seems like you and Tony want to have—”
“And what’s the next part? Shoving ice up my ass and making me squirm that way?” Tony asks sarcastically. Steve raises an eyebrow and waits. It takes Tony only a few seconds to realize what Steve is implying—
The next time he’d wanted to see if Tony wanted sex, he’d suggested that they go out to get a drink since that was what had happened the last two times. Tony had laughed and said, “You know, if you want sex, you can just say so,” as though Steve would ever be able to just come right out and say it (while he was sober; drunk Steve was a different story), but the phrase had stuck.
They meet up again several times over the next few months, both to discuss the proposed amendments and to talk about other things. Steve has a lot of thoughts about the Accords, about how much they would need to change to become palatable for him and what he’d be willing to compromise on, about the treatment of people born with their powers under the Accords instead of people like Steve and Tony, who became superheroes in some other way, and about that list that Tony keeps talking about. It helps that Tony is more than willing to listen to him—oh they argue a lot about what they don’t necessarily agree on, but it never comes to blows again, and Tony does listen to him, just as Steve is listening to
“Huh,” Steve says, following Tony through the warren of copper pipes toward the energy converter. He has no idea how Tony knows where he’s going without a map. Steve still sometimes needs a map and he’s lived on this ship for a year. “That’s not something you can fix?”
He grabs onto the wheel and wrenches it to the left. Tony sure hadn’t been kidding; the wheel doesn’t budge at all. He applies more of his strength, muscles bulging. Under the squeal of metal, he hears Tony’s breath catch, and he grins saucily at him. Tony sticks his tongue out and gestures at the wheel again.
Tony’s gaze, fixed on Steve, was quietly regretful. Steve ignored it. This topic was already hard enough. He didn’t want to have to deal with Tony’s feelings on top of it.
DUM-E, Tony thinks, is going to be just fine. The saltwater damaged his personality chip a little bit, but that’s a couple of hours of easy coding, nothing too difficult. At this point, after years of coding and upgrades and fabrication, Tony’s pretty sure he could do it in his sleep. Butterfingers needs a new strut, as well as a new personality chip, but again, that’s the work of maybe a weekend.
He texts Tony and sets up a meeting date and time at one of the safehouses he has and then he heads over there and waits. The team is more than capable of handling any problems without him while he’s gone, and he’s determined to beat Tony to the safehouse this time. If that means he has to wait there for four days until Tony arrives, then that’s what he’ll do. The world seems very quiet right now anyway, like it’s recovering after the Avengers’ split. He doubts that’s really the reason, doubts that the world could be so centered on his team, but that’s how it feels to him anyway.
Rhodey eventually has to go, called back to his pointless war in the sand, and Tony calls Uncle Grant.
There’s a knock at her bedroom door, and Peggy sighs sadly. She had expected this. At five years old, Tony is too young to be an entire ocean away from his parents for a whole summer, but Howard couldn’t be persuaded from whisking Maria away to a tropical island to celebrate their twenty-fifth anniversary. Peggy had argued, both of the Jarvises had argued, even Maria had argued against it, but Howard had insisted that it’s time Tony learn that his parents can’t always be there for him, as though he’s a teenager going off to college and not a small child. It had only been at Maria’s insistence that Howard had even agreed to let Tony spend the summer with his beloved Aunt Peggy instead of all alone in that big mansion.
Tony snorts. “Fuck no. If I wanted to make someone proud, I would have invited Jarvis. I want to rub our success in Howard’s smug little face. Does that make me a bad person?”
rarely went through any weekly changes bigger than “So-and-so won’t be able to appear as a guest this week so we got someone else instead,” which was fine since he and Tony never prepared questions beforehand anyway—but it was still polite to listen. Valentina went through a lot of trouble to prepare the meetings. The least Steve could do was listen.
That—that may well be true actually. Gracious knows Howard has never truly looked at his son unless it’s about something that Tony made or did for him. Anything else—like the boy’s truly excellent aim during his Little League games—flies right over Howard’s head.
He—he’d told himself that he wasn’t going to let himself get attached to Tony again. He’d told himself he wouldn’t let Tony hurt him the way he had fifteen years ago. He was sticking to that. Tony could leave. It wouldn’t be the first time and it probably wouldn’t be the last. Tony
Tony opens up the duffel bag, revealing a jumble of lace and satin of all colors, haphazardly shoved inside. Steve grins. He’s only known Tony for a few minutes, but this seems very in character for him.
It takes less than a minute for Tony to respond and Steve bites back a smile at the sight of the address and date. It might be too late for him to sign the Accords, but maybe—if he’s very,
“Tony, I think the whole world saw that.” Uncle Grant pauses, then continues hesitantly, “Everything okay? I know it’s frustrating having to wait so long for your soulmate, but I’m worried about you. Out there all on your own…”
Another five minutes and then Tony says, “You won’t get to see me walking around in just my lingerie if we wait five years.”
“Exactly! I—” Tony stopped and looked over at Steve. He looked tired, Steve thought. “You want to go get a drink?”
Tony flashes him a quick smile, more real than the last one. “Thanks.” He twiddles his thumbs. “So…what was that you were saying about Clint and—who’s the other one? I don’t know a Scott. Or, at least, I think I don’t know a Scott. You know, I probably do. I’m pretty sure there’s a Scott on the board, bane of Pepper’s existence you know, and—”
Steve opens his mouth, intent on offering up something—he doesn’t know what, but he can’t stay quiet.
“Probably? Man, you told one hundred and seventeen countries where to stick it. It’s definitely too late.”
“Amendments.” Tony tilts his head to the side. “Technically, since you haven’t signed, you don’t get to propose any amendments, but…” He glances away nervously, then back at Steve. “But maybe you could bring your ideas to me? We could talk about them at least.”
“Alright, that’s enough feelings for one night,” Tony says, suddenly taking his hand away. Steve would feel hurt by it if it’s not for the fact that Tony rubs his fingers over the spot where their palms had touched. “What brings you and the team to Prague?”
Steve blinks at him. “Do you really think so little of me that you just assume I can’t stop by because I want to say hello?”
He doesn’t know how long he spends on Tony’s nipples, but he’s gone through three ice cubes before Tony’s moans change pitch, sounding closer to a whine. He pulls away. He knows that Tony can come just from having his nipples played with—they both can, something that has delighted them to no end in the past—but neither of them are as young as they used to be, and he’s not done with Tony yet.
“I would sign if it were just me,” he says. “But I’m not alone, and I won’t leave my team like this. They deserve better than me abandoning them.”
There was still a strange look on Tony’s face. Steve couldn’t read it. Tony had changed a lot in the ten years they hadn’t seen each other and even though they’d been working together for longer than they’d been in a relationship, he’d worked so hard on maintaining the boundaries he’d set that he didn’t know what was going through Tony’s head.
The phone clicked off. Steve stared at it for a long moment and then broke down, grieving for everything they’d lost all those years ago.
“Yeah, except taking care of herself would have meant harming civilians, which would have only had people more afraid of her, and it would have been a terrible cycle. Anyway, my point is, Wideawake was a project designed to stop people like her. Not Wanda exactly, but other people like her, with powers and without the morals that she has. It started off as just an idea, a way to stop heroes gone rogue, but secretly, Ross managed to actually create these robots—he called them Sentinels. Their entire purpose is to stop superpowered individuals with evil intentions, but I think we both know how easily Ross could have abused that power.”
It makes him wish they could go back to when they’d first heard about the Accords. Maybe, if he’d known how easy they would find it to talk about their disagreements, he would have been more willing to listen than to insist it was his way or the highway.
of space travel, at least not realistic space travel, and now they’ve got colonies on galaxies as far away from their own, it makes his head spin. Humans have peace treaties with over two thousand alien civilizations. And mechanical body enhancements, meant to augment humans for travel and work and sometimes sheer entertainment, are as common as breathing. But Steve, with his serum-induced enhancements, is somehow still the odd one out.
“Still not soon enough,” Tony says. “But sure. I don’t want to make you have to cut your shower too short.”
Tony shoots him an amused look. “Ana used to say that if you were making a home-cooked meal, you should
“No, we always cared,” Natasha informs him. “We just weren’t going to say anything to the Great and Powerful Fire Spirit.”
) had been formidable backup. If it hadn’t been for Nat’s assistance, Steve doubts they would have made it out of there. Most of them hadn’t.
“I don’t. Howard likes to send me links to shitty articles about me so he can tell me I’m wasting my life. Anyway, every time they talk about us, it’s about how we’re gay. What, have they never heard of bisexuals before?”
after returning the Stones to their timelines. Steve stares in abject horror at all the people on their feet applauding the musical, which ends with character-Steve and character-Peggy sharing a dance together in this new timeline that character-Steve has apparently created.
He stares at the message for almost a minute, wondering if there’s supposed to be some sort of subliminal message coming from it. Tony—
“So tell me, Steve,” Natasha immediately says, propping her hip against the counter. “What has you so upset about Tony staying over?”
She nods, gaze falling on the tablet he’s clutching. “Have you thought about what you’re going to do if Tony isn’t able to pass all of your amendments?”
“I talked about it with Sam and Wanda as well; they both agreed on this list,” Steve continues. Tony glances up at him, a faint worried look in his eyes. “They think I’m going through T’Challa, so you don’t have to worry that our secret’s been compromised. Uh—do these seem at least a little bit reasonable?”
“We can do slow,” he murmured. “You wanna let me up so I can go brush my teeth? I wanna kiss you and I know how much you hate the taste of morning breath.”
“I found something for you,” he tells Steve instead. He fishes around in his pockets—the only good things about clothes—for wherever it went to when he summoned the clothes. “Aha!” He pulls it out and holds it out for Steve to take.
Steve turns the phone over in his hands. Tony hasn’t texted him since they saw each other in Wakanda. Steve has reached out a few times, but never received an answer. “I want to sign,” he says, surprising himself. He hadn’t realized he’d finally reached that stage of wanting to sign the Accords. He’d thought he was still deliberating with himself.
“You go get dressed,” he says. “An’ if you come back and want to snuggle up, that’s fine. If you decide you don’t want to, that’s fine too. Or if you decide in the middle of the night you’ve changed your mind either way, that’s also fine. But don’t let someone else decide that for you.”
They were halfway through the movie when Steve leaned over and kissed him. “You looked really good today,” he murmured into Tony’s ear, hand cupping the back of his neck. “Kept thinking about you over on the stairs, about what I wanted to do to you.”
Steve has a feeling that he probably wasn’t supposed to hear that, so he says instead, “You really think this could work?”
about what modelling for an Erotica in Art portfolio should be like, and those ideas don’t include a skinny asthmatic artist. So. He’s got nothing for his project, it’s due in less than a week, and Steve is desperate.
“I think I should warn you,” Tony says as Steve fishes pajamas out of his drawer to give to him. With the lice outbreak, Tony flat out refuses to return to the motel until both Janet and motel are declared lice-free, so Steve had offered to lend him some of his clothes (and if he’s aware that a big part of why he’s offering is because he wants to see Tony in his clothes… well, at least Tony hasn’t realized that). “I’ve been told I’m terrible to sleep with.”
“I picked up a yoga instructor at the bar this weekend,” he blurted out in an attempt to keep the conversation going and immediately winced. That was the kind of thing he could tell Sam and Bucky, not Tony, who was likely still trying to get over his feelings for him. Fuck, was he
“I think he could have been back when this whole mess started if it hadn’t been for everything else going on in our lives.”
He scrolled through his twitter tag, laughing at a picture someone had posted as “incontrovertible proof that stony are dating,” which was very clearly a photoshopped picture, and not a very good one at that. For one thing, neither he nor Tony would ever be caught dead at a Yankees game. Steve liked the Dodgers too much to betray them like that and Tony didn’t like baseball, period.
“You wanna stick around for dinner?” he asks without thinking about it, glancing out the dark window because he isn’t sure he’ll be able to bear it if he looks at Tony and sees the same pitying expression on his face that he so often sees when he asks people out.
It’s a low blow and he winces even as he says it. Their life is rough enough without him begrudging Wanda for finding what little happiness she can and fighting to hold onto it.
He goes home that night, exhausted but happy. They’d gotten a lot of work done today. The store is really coming together, and he’s bizarrely proud of that fact. It seems ridiculous. It’s not his store and Tony has made it abundantly clear that he doesn’t want Steve’s help unless he’s forced into it, but Steve is still really pleased with everything they’ve accomplished.
“Hmm? Oh, sure. You look like you have a clean mouth,” Tony mutters distractedly, more focused on setting the store back to rights than he is on Steve.
“Sure,” Steve agrees, smiling bashfully back at Tony. He doesn’t have a preference about pizza as long as there’s no pineapple on it.
Steve interrupts him before he can bother Tony any further and stress him out again. “Thor, do you want a gift receipt for this?”
“This is slow,” he whines to Rhodey over the phone. Rhodey’s too nice to sigh, but not nice enough to stop himself from pointing out that Tony could just wait instead. “I don’t want to wait. I want to know where they are.”
They take care of each other. Rhodey knows what people think, knows that everyone thinks he gives and gives and gives to Tony Stark and Tony takes nothing in return. But they’re wrong. Sure, he’s there to make sure Tony doesn’t get too drunk at a party or that one of the many fame-chasers doesn’t take advantage of his youth and innocence; he’s not going to deny that he plays his part in taking care of Tony. But it’s Tony who quizzes him for hours the night before an exam, Tony who wakes him up on Saturdays  with coffee and a muffin from the coffeeshop down the street, Tony who has Mama Rhodes’ phone number memorized so he can call her when Rhodey has a bad day. They take care of each other, and
Disillusioned with love, Steve moved on—sort of. He never dated again, but he wasn’t lacking in partners. Steve knew how he looked and the fact that he was kind and respected everyone he slept with was an attractive quality. He spent his nights hopping from bed to bed, telling himself that it was better that way. No one could hurt him if he didn’t stay long enough to care about any of them.
like the shifters he’d known back in New York so he thinks maybe something without too many flavors, just one strong…
That’s why he isn’t surprised when Tony doesn’t say anything to him about the amendments passing. Instead, Tony—always one for a show—texts him one day to turn on the TV. When Steve sits down next to Sam and Wanda, Nat perched on the back of the couch behind them, he sees Tony standing beside T’Challa as the king announces the new changes to the Accords.
Steve ducks his head to hide a blush. He ignores Tony’s words and instead says, “I think it’s a good idea, what you’ve got here, your whole plan of rebranding local potion ingredients and making and selling your own potions. There’s a lot of hedgewitches in the county, plenty of people to grow the plants needed for potions, but the closest alchemist is in Elmdale and they don’t have formal schooling, not like you. Very inventive, I think it’s got promise.”
To his surprise, his husband turned over in the other bed to face him, leaning up just enough to turn on the lamp before slumping back into the pillows. Tony was up early indeed if Steve hadn’t even left for his run yet. He smiled fondly into Steve’s grey eyes, illuminated by the dim light of the lamp.
“You’re coming home,” Tony whispers, and the words sound so right coming out of Tony’s mouth that Steve has to kiss him again.
Rhodey was young when he graduated high school, young when he went off to college, but Tony is younger still. The college paired them together in a dorm room because who else could they pair them with? Rhodey was younger than the next-youngest student by a year and Tony, with his big eyes and fluffy hair, was younger by three. They’d fought terribly those first few weeks, Rhodey headstrong and bitter that ROTC wouldn’t accept him for another two years and Tony angry that his request for a single dorm room had been denied. But then Rhodey had woken in the middle of the night to Tony sniffling over the fact that his fuckup of a father hadn’t even bothered to tell him goodbye before sending him off to college. Then Tony had come home to Rhodey slamming his head against the wall because his statistics professor was assigning him impossible questions on purpose (“Shouldn’t MIT’s wunderkind know how to do this already?” she laughed meanly).
“Oh nice,” Tony says, brightening. Steve nods at the drafting table under the window where there’s a folder with the contract inside and a pen. Tony wanders over, leaving his duffel bag on the couch for Steve to look through. He’s selected a matching set of silver bralette and panties to go with the gold ropes when Tony comes back, holding the folder out for him to take.
was, but for the most part, Ross designed it that way. He told me that he was communicating with you, and like an idiot, I believed him. He wanted to tear us apart, wanted to force you into a criminal life so he could hunt you down and—and take the serum. I didn’t see it at the time, but I do now. I’m trying to get him ousted.”
That’s—Steve doesn’t know how he feels about that. Tony hadn’t mentioned it, but he can’t help but wonder if he
“Aw no, man, you did, but then I saw I had some waffle mix and who doesn’t like waffles, right? Oh, hey, did I ever tell you about the time me and my cousin Ernesto went to this breakfast bar place that they used to have in Elmdale?”
“Hey, Steve, about that favor you said you owed me: what do you think about going to see the fireworks together for your birthday?”
“Hmph. I like it my way better.” He yawns, probably tuckered out from the long day. “Uncle Jarvis, will you tell me a bedtime story?”
Rumlow strode into the conference room, acting, as he always did, like he owned the place. “—Focus on the Family is threatening to remove their financial support if they’re not cancelled,” he was telling Rollins. Steve looked down at the table to hide his frown. It sounded like Rumlow was still talking about
“Um, Mr. Captain America sir?” the actress who played Natasha asks meekly. “I think you forgot a word in there.”
And Tony gets it. He smiles, vanishing his clothes away with a thought. “Steve,” he says, taking Steve’s hands in his. They’re wonderfully cool on his heated skin, and he wonders how they’ll feel on the rest of him. “Steve, you can look. I want you to.”
“The vendor is calling those dreamcatchers,” Tony explains. “But I’m pretty sure that’s culturally appropriative.”
Steve turned to look at him. Tony was leaning against the doorframe, outlined by the light coming from the bathroom. “For…” He trailed off as he gestured between the two of them.
“We know who your dad is!” Luis shouts cheerfully from the other room, but funnily enough, Steve doesn’t think that’s why Tony corrected himself. “Howard” sounded way too familiar in Tony’s mouth and “my dad” too unfamiliar for that to be the reason.
“Hi, Tony.” Is he imagining it or does Steve’s smile turn a little shy when he sees him? Excited, Tony can’t help that he bursts into flames. Steve just makes him feel like that. Steve laughs. “Oh, it’s like that, is it?” He conjures up a pile of snow.
Clint doesn’t even startle. Out of nowhere, Steve thinks about a game Tony and Thor used to play with Clint and Nat when they all first moved into the tower. Well, they’d
Tony brightens, straightening up, and for a brief moment, Steve feels a flash of hope—right up until Tony opens his mouth. “Okay so it’s kind of inspired by the old apothecary that used to be there except it's a lot more general?” he says. “But it’s also a more specific than just general.”
Tony perked up. Steve did as well. Westview had never had a magic act in their talent show before. “You two can do magic tricks?”
Carol is working the counter when Steve walks in, same as always, and tingles run up his arm as she turns the force of her smile on him. He doesn’t know what she is—no one does, according to Luis; he would suspect she’s a hedgewitch, based on the fact that she’s working at a mediocre restaurant that probably doesn’t pay well, but the feeling of power that he gets from her rivals the feeling that he gets from Tony and, if he remembers the tabloids correctly (obviously from before the Starks lost their fortune), Tony is one of the most powerful witches in the Western Hemisphere, so that says something about Carol.
separate occasions he’d bonked into the wall) had latched onto Tony, so it was only right that they took both animals home.
smiling because Steve stepped in cow dung. By the time they get back to Schitt’s Creek, Tony seems much more relaxed.
their show on the cutting block. He nodded and, thinking that was the end of their conversation, reached over to turn his computer on, pulling up the website for their guest speaker for that day’s show. To his surprise however, Tony didn’t leave, only sat back in his borrowed chair, closing his eyes. He looked exhausted, Steve suddenly realized, and he wondered if Tony hadn’t been sleeping well or if the rumors had been bothering him more than he’d said.
, he knew, was at least a partial lie. Steve knew for a fact that Tony had stayed up half the night—they’d been together, after all—but Tony was an insomniac who frequently came to work on significantly less sleep than he should and still been as talkative as ever. He never let lack of sleep bother him.
“Yeah,” Tony said happily. Steve glanced over at him to see Tony running his fingers through the mess of come on his stomach and bringing them up to his mouth to lick off. He groaned again, oversensitive cock twitching against his thigh.
“Huh,” he said and glared up at the ceiling. Very rude of the rain to stop only once he’d taken care of protecting everything important instead of ten minutes ago or, even better, never starting at all. He glanced at the covered paintings and knickknacks, wondering if he should uncover them again. Probably best not to since he didn’t know what was going on with the water situation in their house. For all he knew (and knowing his luck), it would start back up again as soon as he uncovered them.
Tony seizes the opportunity. “Sure, but how many Steve Rogers have Tony Stark on their wrist? Because that’s my name. What’s on your wrist?”
And Steve could argue that point all day long—who would look at what Tony’s doing for Schitt’s Creek and not think that?—but that isn’t what Tony needs right now. He needs a hug and, you know what, that’s exactly what Steve’s going to give him.
Steve: There’s no “in confidence” in radio, Tony, and I’m going to tell my mom you said that about her.
rationalized the entire events of the morning in his mind. He’d also taken care of what little bit of cleaning he had been planning to do around the house while Steve took care of the yard—at least, that had been the original plan before the rain. It was terribly boring work, but he certainly wasn’t going to make Steve do it when he was more than capable.
“When you two aren’t emotionally compromised,” she amends. “But the two of you worked well together when you weren’t being influenced by the scepter or Wanda’s magic or the UN’s timetable. Why else do you think we had a standing bet about when you and Tony would start dating?”
There’s a very long line outside the store when he gets in the next day with his and Tony’s coffees. Tony himself is standing just behind the counter, frozenly staring at the line of eager people. Steve lets himself in, ignoring the people yelling behind him that he can’t just cut the line and that he needs to wait like everyone else. He’s not sure how they missed seeing him unlock the door, but he’s got bigger problems on his hands than them not realizing he’s an employee, like Tony’s impending panic attack.
“Sure there is! We know what we like. We don’t have to spend any effort finding someone else. That’s the very definition of convenient.”
To his delight, while Tony’s eyes narrow, there’s a smile lurking at the corners of his mouth. “You’re very snippy, you know that?”
gone outside, then it was silly for Tony to be standing around in the kitchen calling for him like a nagging housewife.
Oh. Steve’s very big on this whole clothes thing, which Tony doesn’t understand. He’s a nature spirit, it’s not like he’s human, why should clothes matter?
“Look,” she says, voice softening. “You two seem to really get along well. Whether Tony wants to admit or not, you’re his friend, which is supposedly the best foundation for a relationship.”
“Clearly you’re putting it to good use.” Tony’s smile fades after a moment. “Just so you know, if we don’t get the grant money—”
an incredibly Tony thing to do and yet it feels wholly unexpected to Steve. “He’s really doing that for them?” he asks, just seeking to double check.
I was looking at rings; I took you to the jewelers.” Tony didn’t have a response to that, so Steve continued, “And now, what? After three years, you decide to just spring this on me?”
. When Pierce had floated the idea to him, he’d made it sound like Mr. Right Now was supposed to be a player always looking for a new conquest, but Steve had been able to turn him into more of a live in the moment kind of character, the kind of guy who told high school girls not to follow their boyfriends to their college and go their own direction instead.
Tony jams his hands in his pockets. “I know. I want to hear what you say when he’s not standing right there.”
Caller: Right, so, I’m—uh—I’ve got this like friends with benefits situation going on. And it’s really new, and it’s not like we promised each other forever or anything. Like it really is just a friends with bennies thing. But then I found out today that, like, they’ve been thinking about moving to be closer to their mom, and I’m like what the [beep], you weren’t going to tell me about that, and they were like well, no, that’s not the kind of relationship we have, and now they’re calling me a [beep] for not caring about their family problems, but I’m not!
“I didn’t know it was him,” Steve tells him again. He’ll tell him as many times as Tony needs to hear it before he’ll believe it. He never would have hurt Tony like that, never would have
“Oh please, I’m not nearly as bad as you,” Tony said, apparently missing Steve’s slip. Well, if Tony didn’t think it was that big of a deal, then Steve wasn’t going to worry about it either. “I keep thinking one of these days, you’ll bring home a puppy.”
“I’m completely serious. I wouldn’t have offered if I wasn’t okay with this.” He smirked. “So what do you say about going to get a drink tonight?”
“I’m sorry,” Steve says again. “I wish I had a better reason than I didn’t want you to tell me it was a mistake talking to him.”
It was a quiet, awkward car ride. The only time Steve spoke was to tell Tony which hotel Sam and Bucky were staying at. For his part, Tony seemed about to speak a couple times but he always glanced over at Steve and shut his mouth again. By the time they pulled up to the hotel, he was more than ready to get out of the car.
“It’s the only idea we’ve got,” Tony replied wryly, but he looked more settled now that they had a plan. He’d always been such a planner, always wanted to prepare for the worst-case scenario no matter how unlikely it might have been. Steve was a planner too, but he was nowhere near Tony’s level.
Tony gives him one of his Looks. “Steve,” he says patiently. “There’s only one were in the whole county, no we’re not going to sell it. It’s the full moon tonight. Thought it might be nice if Nat had something to help the transformation.”
Something washed over him—a feeling, one of great sadness, threatening to nearly overwhelm him with its intensity. That had to be it! He’d forgotten to call the florists and have flowers sent to his parents’ graves. He didn’t know how he’d forgotten; he’d remembered the anniversary of their deaths every year for the last five years. Well, five years though. He was bound to feel the pain of their passing more intensely on a round number like that. Yes, that was it. That had to be why he was feeling that grief so much more this year unlike all the others before it.
Idly, he wonders if Tony has this many problems trying to work out of a motel room with his family, and that leads him right back to thinking about the frame. He picks up the business license, intending on finally putting it in the frame, only to frown. As an enchanter himself, he can tell when objects have had spells placed on them. Most first-time business licenses come with a spell of good fortune, meant to aid the owner in their first year, but someone must have forgotten Tony’s because he feels nothing from the certificate.
Steve Rogers, the one that the other fifty thousand Steves Tony has to go through to find his were named for—but his dad is
She grimaces slightly. “That’s not really how the Accords work.” He glances at her questioningly. “It works more like an auditor, somewhat. We have a battle, we do a certain amount of damage, we then have to account for that damage to the Accords committee. They ask why the damage was unavoidable, what could have been done to mitigate the battle, and then we work out a way to repay what happened, whether that’s financially or helping with the cleanup or whatever else might be decided.”
Steve waits him out and then shrugs. “My bad. Just figured with you here this late, you might be nervous.”
The rumors didn’t go away over the following week. If anything, they just kept getting stronger and more specific. Steve was getting more and more worried that Pierce really was planning on cancelling their show, but every time either he or Tony had tried to corner him to ask about it, Pierce had brushed them off. It was unprofessional and rude and frustrating. Steve had done what he could to manage his frustration, including trying some meditation Youtube channel Bucky had recommended for him and going out to the bar on Saturday to find someone who could fuck the anger out of him (he’d found a very nice bear who’d done an admirable job of leaving him drooling), but it didn’t work. It only took a few pointed comments from Rumlow on Monday morning for his anger to reach a boiling point by the time their showtime rolled around that evening.
Steve pretended he didn’t hear it and started walking toward the nearby parking garage. Technically, Hydra staff had their own parking lot behind the building, but Steve had heard from multiple staff members that it was a downright nightmare to try to get in and out of. And Tony was an impatient driver at best, so Steve would be willing to bet Tony parked in the garage one block over instead of in the lot.
