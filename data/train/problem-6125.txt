"Chest hurts," Peter murmured after a moment, voice thick with unshed tears and a bit of fear. Tony rubbed his back, holding him close, willing him to feel better.
"I'm testing it with Jamie's as well," Bruce said with a nod. "I'll send those results over when they're done."
"Keep an eye on that playlist! I have to make my own to counteract everything that he puts on there." Tony lifted his head, making a new playlist under that one. "
“Hey, babe,” Tony breathed out. “If I didn’t know better, I’d say you were worried,” he said quietly.
“It was Sarah,” Peter said to Tony. “Wade’s old babysitter, but he never liked her.” Tony looked at Steve, whose expression said that it was not good. “She came and signed him out after lunch, and he didn’t come back.”
"Jarvis doesn't have much footage that we can actually use." Bruce came back over to her, handing over a Starkpad. She looked down and saw Tony cleaning up the pool room. He was in mid turn, almost as if someone had called out his name. The video blinked out a little, like a glitch, and suddenly Tony is falling back first into the water. As his body went under the water Steve was running in and diving into the pool. There was no way that Tony should have been able to reach the bottom of the pool that quickly, but it felt like an eternity before she saw them run in and Steve coming back up with Tony in his arms.
"The time is One Twelve in the morning," Jarvis spoke at the small command. "Colonel Rhodes is still asleep, and Young Master Peter still sleeps soundly. There has been no change, no nightmares, and no further, visible, reactions."
Tony turned slowly, and then there were hands helping him sit up. "Are you okay?" Meg asked quietly, trying not to draw the attention of the two still fighting. "Shit, your nose." She pressed a cloth into his hand and let him bring it up to his face. His chest was on fire, and he glanced down to see that the arc reactor was still glowing under his shirt, just missing the hit.
"He's not here right now, and there are no cameras inside the hall," Tony reassured her, and himself. "They don't let the press, with their cameras, inside the hall."
“Good luck,” Bucky huffed. Steve was looking at him with one eyebrow up. “The kid ratted, didn’t he?”
“Meg and Bucky were experimenting,” Tony finished with a sigh. “Great, trigger words. Wait, did you say someone was trying to hack into Jarvis?”
“Why don’t you take Uncle Bucky down the hall,” Tony said, setting Peter on his feet. “I have to finish getting Jarvis back up, and I’ll be over with Jamie and the twins, alright?” Peter nodded then hurried over to take Bucky’s hand, and they left the apartment. Tony looked over at Mary, tapping a few more things on the tablet. “You going to be okay here alone?”
“Gotta stop,” Tony took a breath, “doing things like that, if you want me to talk. Fuck, that feels amazing. Steve, if you stop, I may strangle you.” Steve huffed out a laugh and it reverberated through Tony. “That, I uh, I could see it. I saw the vibrations of sound.” Tony opened his eyes and started to move his body, wanting more friction and heat, needing more of it.
Steve opened the door and the two men looked at each other for a moment, before Steve moved to let the shorter man in. "You must be-"
"I was sassy in the ice, and you know it," Steve shot back with a grin. Tony made a grumbling noise under his breath, because he was probably right.
"We've slowly been getting some information about AIM." Tony felt pretty confident calling them that, even if he didn't know what it stood for yet. He didn't care at the moment. "Nothing about this lab, yet, but I think we're close. Probably closer than you and Natasha."
"Well, I understand you have to at conferences." Tony raised both eyebrows at Steve now, and Steve joined him walking down the hall.
Mary went back to biting her thumb. The first few months of being frozen had been hard for Steve, His PTSD rearing up with a vengeance, making up for lost time being trapped in the ice. He had survivor's guilt piled on top of all the nightmares and insecurities. She knew that he still suffered from them, but Mary had helped Steve find some coping mechanisms, and he had even talked to a non-SHIELD issue therapist that specialized with soldiers and veterans. It hadn't lasted long, but Steve had stayed there long enough that he was actually able to sleep at night.
"I think we both know that I would have gotten restless," he leaned in to rest his head against Tony's. "If I quit, that's not going to stop others from doing bad things, from killing others, or from another invasion. I have to still be there, to stop them from hurting you, from hurting Peter, from hurting Jamie now." Steve let his thumb rub against Tony's cheek, using his other arm to pull Tony a little closer. "I don't know who to trust anymore, not after what happened with SHIELD, what's happening with Bucky. I never thought I would find myself doubting Natasha, but I did, in DC, on our missions. But I know I've never had to doubt my trust in you."
"Forget the house, you're staying here. These children of yours need to be corrupted in the best way possible. And then I will have them listen to good music." He grinned when she punched his arm. "Steve'll love it, and then I'll have an extra babysitter for these two hooligans. Living with superheroes is the best."
"And he's my child," he pointed at her. "Still a step down on that hierarchy." Rachel cackled gleefully. "I'm not breaking Peter's little heart by telling him that his poor sick Granma lost his card game to his healthy cheating mother."
"Don't," Tony breathed out. "Please, just, don't go yet." He relaxed slightly when Steve put his hand over the one in his shirt.
"What I did was personal, and had nothing to do with SHIELD," Mary re-iterated, a bit softer and kinder this time. "People make mistakes, but I stand by my actions." Steve still held respect for her; at least she stood by her decisions. "Whatever your personal thoughts about Tony, as a Stark, are, are yours to keep and work out." Steve nodded. He had a lot of new thoughts about Tony.
"Ah, yes," Thor nodded. "Indeed, this is something that can be done. I am merely waiting for your Director's return with the tesseract, and then we will be able to depart."
Tony had of course been invited to have dinner with them, and to watch Peter open his presents down there, but Tony made up some excuse to just wait until the next day. Honestly, it would have felt weird for him. Mary was married now, and as much as they were all a family because of Peter, he was still personally aware that they were two separate families. Plus, Tony was attempting his own thing for Christmas, maybe with Steve.
Rhodey had sat on the floor, letting Peter show him the drawings he had done, and then started reciting his numbers for him. Tony had grinned, his boy was smart, and learning fast, and he was the proud Daddy. Even pepper had spent some time listening to Peter, hearing stories about times that he and Tony had spent together, all the fun things they had done together.
"It's unaccounted for." Tony groaned and almost banged his forehead against the desk. "I'll put out the order, that's going to be one of the top priority finds."
.” Tony looked at Steve, pulling both hands up to wrap around Steve’s face before pressing their lips together, greedily stealing kisses from him. Steve took in a breath through his nose before pressing back against together just as eagerly, lifting his hand to rest along Tony’s neck. “If there’s anyone who deserves to have all of that, it’s you,” Tony said breathlessly against his lips. “You deserve to have a family more than I do. You selfless, fucking sap.”
"Honestly? No. But, maybe I could show Rachel his way and let her take it all out on him." Tony's fingers of his good hand were flying over the screen of his phone. "Also, I wouldn't trust Thor and Loki alone at SHIELD, at least not with Fury. We gotta figure out something to do with the Cube, and Reindeer Games, and it'd be better if we were all in the same place. Jarvis will be able to keep people out of where they aren't supposed to go. Just have to figure out a way to contain him though," Tony murmured.
"That's not what I meant, Tony." Steve put his hands up in front of his chest a little. "I know you've kept Peter out of the press, and I'm just hoping that this man isn't stupid enough to say anything just because he wants a little attention."
“Steve, come along, your food is almost done,” she announced. “My parents, and Dr Banner, are on their way up.”
"Nope, my Peter." Tony shook his head. They all walked into the dining room and suddenly Peter was plucked from both of their grips.
“I assure you we do not mean to interrupt,” Stephen Strange’s voice called out. “That’s why we waited up here.” Tony rolled his eyes, then lightly bumped Mary’s shoulder to keep her moving.
Meg got up, nodding to Steve, and letting her hand rest gently on his arm before going for the nursery. Steve looked at Bucky and they heard the door close. The brunette stood up to face Steve, but was able to keep the couch between them at least.
"An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not awesome." Tony was starting to really get under Steve's skin now.
"That's because I haven't actually lived there, or been there, since before my parents died," he said, shrugging to try and look like it wasn't a big deal. He'd have to get someone in there to actually dust it, or something. It probably needed to be aired out. The last person to have been there had been Jarvis, the real life person Edwin Jarvis, but he had died a year after his parents had died. "It's in Manhattan, the better of the islands by the way, so it's not too far away."
"I'm not going anywhere, Petey," Tony said as he ran his hand through his hair a little. "I'm gonna stay here and talk to Agent while you visit, and then I'll come back, okay?" Peter nodded. William put him on his feet and took his hand as they headed for the ICU entrance.
"Tony doesn't like to admit that he sometimes needs help," Mary said softly. "He's," and she hesitated. Steve could kind of understand, it wasn't her story to tell. "Tony is complicated, to say the least." Steve just hummed softly, nodding. He still wanted to meet the man, he felt like he needed to now. What was this Tony really like? To Peter he was Daddy, near about a superhero to him; to Mary he was a co-parent, and friend. But to Steve, he was someone who was trying to do right, but could probably be doing more. Peter and Mary deserved the best, and if Steve had to knock some sense into this Tony, to accept help, and to reach his full potential, then he would.
"Yeah!" Peter unbuckled from his booster seat as Tony got out of the front seat. He opened the back door and Peter hopped out, almost vibrating with excitement. Tony took Peter's hand and they headed for the large museum. It was a weekday, and it was early in the day, so there weren't as many people at the museum, just how Tony had hoped it would be.
"Yeah, exactly." He sighed a little. "I'm handling that, got a routine down, after how many years? Now, let's throw in another child, a baby, one that I almost-" Tony took a breath. "They wanted me to experiment on that girl, that baby out there learning how to crawl. They were going to make her into a weapon, and they were going to make me do it." His eyes trailed down the hall a little, words echoing through his mind. "What right do I have to her? Just another life to screw up with a past that won't seem to leave me alone."

Steve noticed that when Natasha and Clint came down to eat, that Clint purposely distanced himself from Peter, sitting the furthest away. One would think that he was letting familiar faces surround the boy, but Natasha and Steve knew that it was because he felt guilty, thinking that he was part of the reason that Mary was in a coma. Natasha had assured Steve that she would handle that.
He let out a breath of relief and pulled and twisted, hearing the flaps break up, hearing the ice chunks crackle off. Putting his arms and legs out, he tried to slow his fall as much as possible, waiting for Jarvis to recognize that it was now safe to reboot. He watched the ground from the eye holes, wondering if he should make them bigger, until the screen burst to life, the icons loading and minimizing, and finally, Finally, Jarvis was powered up again and he had control.
"Well, I was told that you were the sci-fi expert." Tony raised an eyebrow at him. "I'm trying to broaden my movie horizons."
Steve watched them with a smile, having seen nearly every Disney movie thanks to his time babysitting Peter. “You’re putting a lot of thought into this.”
“Hey Pep, what about GTA Man?” Tony said, looking to his PA. Who wouldn’t want to be named after a popular video game. The answering unamused look from Pepper said everything.
"I can't." Tony opened his eyes, brown meeting blue. A blue so open, warm, welcoming, that he almost broke down right there and told Steve every shitty thing in his life that he had kept to himself. "Not," Tony pulled in a breath and held onto it for a second before letting it back out. "Not,
After an hour, all the eggs except for the red one had hatched. Tony watched it, watched it shake and move. “Come on Ruby,” he said gently. “We’re all here waiting for you.” He smiled when the egg finally cracked. Vee walked over to it as well, the rest behind her, playing with each other, and with Pepper’s fingers. “She’s coming,” Tony said to Vee. “Fashionably late.”
“No, just don’t want to see your naked ass again,” Bucky snorted out. “Saw enough of that even before the Army. Tony can call dibs on all that.”
"Yeah, you know me, I keep strange hours," Tony murmured, before standing up again. He saw Steve's bright blue eyes looking at him and Tony had to bite the inside of his cheek. "I tried to sleep again and had a nightmare," Tony confessed. "What are you doing awake so early? Because this is early even for you."
"He looks just like you," Rhodey said, smiling at the picture, and Tony felt a little surge of pride. His best friend was smiling at his sons picture. That was his son. "I won't tell anyone, Tony, but I do wanna meet him sometime."
“Your Mama would usually call me by my last name when she didn’t like what I was doing,” Tony explained, divvying out the plates. “Which was, a decent amount of the time.” Peter and Wade both got an elephant ear covered in cinnamon sugar, and funnel cake plate with fruit covered with whip cream, and powdered sugar. Peter had requested strawberries, while Wade had gotten raspberries. Two cups of lemonade were set in front of them as well. Most of the food was set in front Tony and Steve, and Steve knew that he would eat most of it, followed up by a late night gym visit. Three elephant ears were in front of them, two funnel cakes with just blueberries, and one funnel cake with strawberries. Tony had also gotten a plate of at least half a dozen corn dogs, setting that one in the middle of the table.
Pietro was pacing slightly, looking as if he were fighting with himself on if he should interfere or not. Wanda must have warned him off if he wasn’t moving just yet. The rest of Tony’s body started to thrash on the bed, and Tony wanted nothing more than to grab him away.
Rachel had come back from the hospital three days ago, and was recovering nicely in the comfort of her own bed. When she stayed in it. Mary was pulling double duty or helping her parents, and helping Coulson go through information about possible Hydra locations. Julie was getting along exceedingly well with Todd the security guard, and Wade and Peter were in deep discussions about how they would try to thwart his all-knowing gaze around the Tower. Tony had money on Todd.
"I tried to make pancakes?" He looked a little lost, putting the bowl in the sink. Mary took a breath and nodded, pushing the sleeves of her shirt up.
Steve couldn't stop himself. He surged forward and wrapped his arms around Tony, pulling him into his lap, against his chest. "I won't let that happen," he promised fiercely. "I promised Peter, and I promise you, I won't let anything happen to you."
Bruce looked through the crate and pulled out a couple of old film reels. "At least we'll have entertainment while we do it."
His head was hammering in his chest, his head was pounding, and he got a body shivering sensation of fear. The man was coming towards him, that man was after him! He pulled the helmet off, and wriggled around, grasping for the restraints that kept him in the vehicle. The car tilted a bit, unsteady, and Tony thought that he could still use that to his advantage to get out.
He squeezed Steve's hand once before he was pushing himself up again, brushing away Steve's other hand that tried to stop him. "I have to- Downstairs- I've got his stuff." Tony managed to get his feet on the ground and stood up. He wobbled for a second before he started walking. "In my workshop, I've got the shooter's stuff. I need to go through it, need to know why."
"Exercise is good! Specially for pregnant women," Tony crowed, taking a look around her hotel room, heading over to the windows. Jarvis hadn't detected anything through the night, but Tony wasn't taking any chances. They could still be being watched.
"Do we have any other leads?" Steve looked up at the two spies. They were temporarily distracted when Bruce came in the room, immediately taking a seat next to Tony. Tony heard Steve start his conversation up again, but Bruce was shoving his tablet into Tony's hands.
Bruce pushed Tony towards Steve, who was examining the restored motorcycle. Tony shot Bruce a little glare, but then felt Steve's gaze on him.
"I have a plan." Stark reached the end of the platform. "Attack." He jumped and shot off in the sky.
"That's the big floor!" Peter whooped as they ran to the trunk of the car. They each grabbed their backpacks and a duffle bag, and Tony peered inside. The trunk was full, with at three bags of what Tony could only assume were souvenirs.
"Do you really want to ask me that, Tony?" She asked a little coyly, and Tony instantly started to shake his head.
"And that's what you need to go and introduce," Bruce insisted. "I can work with Jarvis here, and we make all the necessary calculations, and see what actually needs to be done."
“Years of training,” Tony explained. “I’m pretty good at picking out melodies, then working from there. I know a lot of the classics, the real classics, but I can also play a lot of modern songs.” Tony lifted his eyes up to look at Steve as he transitioned into another song. Steve raised an eyebrow at him, then smirked a little. “I had a little bit of incentive to learn this song.”
“I was thinking some alone time for a few days,” Steve said, leaning down to and kissing along the shell of Tony’s ear. “Maybe head to Malibu.” Tony raised an eyebrow. “We didn’t to spend a lot of time there before, and it was nice.” Steve wrapped an arm across Tony’s chest, pressing their cheeks together. “I’m thinking that maybe that vacation idea of yours isn’t too horrible. It’s good even.”
"He didn't make it, he was in Midtown during the attack." She turned away from the phone, but Tony still heard her air stealing cough. Tony bit the inside of his cheek.
"Mr Steve! It's me!" Peter leaned over in Tony's arms, Tony having to adjust to hold onto the wiggly boy. "I'm not a bunny!"
"You get first dibs," Tony offered with a hand wave. "I'll go out with you tomorrow to pick up what you need though. We'll take the SUV, less of a hassle then trying to get things delivered right away."
It was one of Steve's drawings, this one in just pencil. There was no denying Steve's talent with this piece. He had managed to catch one of the times that Tony had fallen asleep on the couch with Peter. Tony's head was resting on the arm of the couch, Peter on his chest, hand resting over the arc reactor, a blanket pooled around Tony's legs. Steve even managed to show the glow of the reactor against Peter's hand, and the softness in his face as he slept. Tony's arm was wrapped around Peter's waist, fingers curled around his side.
Tony was so lost in his thoughts, and the happiness that was coursing through his chest, that he missed the elevator arriving to his floor until- "Daddy!" Tony jumped when Peter came running into the living room. He took a deep breath so that he wasn't panting from the kiss, and looked over to see five people standing in the living room, looking at them. Steve still had one arm around Tony's neck, and Tony still had his arm around Steve's waist, and Steve's face was turning red.
"Not a bodyguard," Steve quickly amended. "I talked to Natasha, Clint, and Bruce, and we all decided that someone should go with you, to represent the Avengers."
"Psshht! You're dating, you've been dating for nearly three months, and if the accidental moaning I caught over the phone last week had anything to do with Stark's lips, then yes, he's your boyfriend." Steve's whole face had to be red by now. "You've spent over half an hour on the phone with me so far asking what colors to wear just to go up to see him. You are so smitten it's equal parts adorable, and disgusting."
"Sir, I believe that young Master is having a reaction to the peanut butter." Tony's blinked and Rhodey looked up from his pot. "His heart rate is becoming elevated, and I'm detecting swelling around his eyes, and his tongue."
"Shit," Tony murmured, unable to look away. "This is, amazing." Tony suddenly started looking around the penthouse, at the bare walls, jumping up with the drawing in his hands. Steve blinked, turning on the couch to watch him. Tony pulled a painting off the wall, quickly replacing it with Steve's drawing. "I like this much better here. This is better than any other art in this whole Tower." Tony was resolutely ignoring the tingling behind his eyes, staring at the drawing for a few more moments. He hurried over back over to the couch, leaning over Steve and cupping his face with his hands, kissing him deeply.
"You two should go talk to Fury, tell him and Hill that you're here for Thor and Loki," Natasha said from the front passenger seat. "It'll distract them enough for us to get to Coulson and get him to a Quinjet."
Tony gave a little whine, turning into Steve’s side. “I was kind of hoping that you might have forgotten how long it’s been since I went there.”
Tony wrinkled his nose a little. "Because I thought he was stirring up shit last night, so I went to talk to Thor and make sure." Steve raised an expectant eyebrow at him. "Well, it's hard to get an actual answer out of him, but Loki tried to con me into doing something that might get him a lesser sentence when he has to go back with Thor."
Steve retreated into the bathroom to change, and as he started to dress he could see it coming together. Tony was having him dress as Luke Skywalker from the beginning of
"I'm not entirely sold on the Zoo theme," Tony said with a hum. He leaned against the kitchen counter, stealing a piece of bacon from the pile that Steve had started. Steve eyed him, but didn't say anything. "What about a spider themed-"
“Everything is all set, Captain,” the AI responded in the hallway. “There is a car waiting to take you and Sir to the jet. The house has been prepared to your specifications.”
"Maybe for someone other than the inventor of the hottest current smartphone," Tony shot back. "Who needs to call when I can just send message from my seat?"
“I’ll say,” Steve chuckled. “So, this,” he waved his hand at the two other outfits and the baby Ewok, “you’ve have this planned for a bit?”
Thor laughed and it was like a slap to the face. Tony took a couple steps back, putting a hand to his head. No, this wasn't right. The room felt too hot, the air was too thick, and something was buzzing in the back of his head. Was this from the arc reactor? Tony glanced around. No, everyone else was acting odd, off.
"I'm beginning to get an idea of what that means," Steve said as a teacher rushed over to the boys, trying to get Wade to sit properly on the swing. Steve glanced over at Tony, the man still slumped into himself on the bench, and he remembered the talk he had with Mary at SHIELD.
Tony started to shake his head, lifting a hand to stop Steve. “No, it’s fine. It really is. I was more or less surprised that they went with you…. I’ve never taken them to go see her, because I don’t want anyone accidentally seeing them with me,” Tony admitted. He leaned against one of the counters, crossing his arms across his chest. “There are only 7 people who know about them, and sometimes I feel that number is too big. I know they could take care of themselves, but I don’t want to put them in danger just because of who I am.” Tony rubbed one of his arms, and Steve could sense there was more, that Tony was keeping something to himself. “Aunt Peggy knew about them, but I just hadn’t gotten them to meet her yet. I’m glad they went with you, though. I really am.”
They talked for a little bit, Wade telling his mom about everything that he and Peter had done together, and he leaned against her side, still playing with her hospital bracelet. Tony had thought that the boy would probably miss his mom, so he had packed some of Wade's stuff in the backpack. "Hey, Wade, do you wanna spend the night here, with your mom? Steve, Peter, and I will pick you up in the morning?"
"I don't mean to be rude," Steve said, internally cringing at interrupting, but he had to know something, "but I have to know, are things really going this easily right now?" Mary tilted her head, eyebrow raised in confusion. "Well, you're very kind ma'am, and very helpful, but I would think that others would want things to move quickly for me, to get me back out in the field."
Tony put him down, but took his hand, walking over to the different displays. "Yeah, it is. I was a big fan when I was a kid, and I collected everything." Peter got as close as he could to the glass, seeing a large collection of comic books. "Did you know that my Dad actually knew Captain America?"
Tony was suddenly falling back as the whips shorted, releasing him. When Tony reached for his neck he pulled off the end of the whip form Vanko's suit, and looked at it. No, the whips had been sliced through. Tony rolled back to his feet, and saw something fly past his head.
"Please, you can call me Mary," She said, giving him a soft, very motherly, smile. "And if you change your mind about tonight, I won't be offended. A lot can happen between now and the time I come back." Steve nodded, giving a small smile. He followed her back to the front door, opening the door for her and watching her go grab her jacket before leaving.
"You said that you were going to work on getting Pepper out to see her family, and you would let me know what that happened," Mary reminded him. "Typically Peter and I go over to my parents on Christmas morning though, and he opens his presents there, and we eat lunch."
Bucky stared Wade down for a few moments. “Meg! I changed my mind, I’m taking my chances with the public! I’m leaving! Hydra gave me less headaches than I get here!” There was a faint snort from the other room.
"Sir, Ms Parker and Young Master Peter have arrived," Jarvis told him. Tony grinned, slipping his t-shirt on and grabbed his phone, slipping it in his pocket.
"No, I said don't go overboard with Christmas," Mary deflected his fast paced rambling. "Although, no, he still has not forgiven strawberries."
“Yeah, but you’re still too young to be saying what Tony says,” Julie said, shooting Tony a meaningful look. “It was probably called for.”
"I approve." She nodded. Steve kept smiling and walked back over to Tony as he booked an extra room, throwing his name a bit to make sure it would be ready.
"I make some smaller pieces and sell them online, or at art gallery gift shops," she said with a shrug. "It took a while, but I've got enough steady commissions that come in to keep me busy."
"No, no reports of that," Hawkeye answered. The lights actually flickered as the elevator doors opened, and Tony opted for the stairs, taking them two and three at a time.
"It's really warm," Tony muttered. Peter scrunched up his face in disgust. "Learn from my mistakes, Peter."
"You're a physicist," Tony argued. "I'm an engineer. Really, I'm lucky to be alive since I've been handling this all by myself."
"He didn't seem like it the first time I saw him," she said. Tony jolted up, hissing and pressing a hand to his ribs at the movement, and Steve stopped in his tracks.
"We're all doomed if they ever have to split," Tony told him. Steve just nodded with a grave seriousness. They ate in a comfortable silence for a few minutes, before Tony spoke up again. "Steve." He had said it quietly, but Steve's head shot up when he heard the use of his first name. Tony almost flinched; apparently it had not gone unnoticed that Tony only used his first name when he was being serious. Rhodey would gloat if he ever found out about that. "I have to.... I can't....." Tony let out a soft sigh, then looked into his eyes. "Thank you." There was so much more than he wanted to say, that he needed to say to the blonde, but he physically couldn't get it all out without needing another breathing treatment.
“If you can put up with my overworking, stubborn, and arrogant ass for this long, then who am I to stop you.” Steve smiled at Tony’s words, kissing his head.
Steve sat down on the floor after depositing the dishes from snack time in the kitchen, and look at Jamie. "How did you get your socks off so fast?" She was sitting up with her legs extended, leaning forward so she could play with her toes. Her socks were nowhere to be seen. "I was gone for less than a minute. And where did they go?" Jamie just burred her lips a little and continued pulling at her toes with her fingers.
"Well, I was a little worried that she's so quiet, and he thinks that it probably has to do with being kept in the base," Steve told him, one arm secured around the baby girl, who had let go of his fingers to look around as they walked. Tony reached inside the bag that was resting on Steve's hip, grabbing a towel, and wiped his fingers off from slobber.
"You are, it's kind of cute. So, just send me a text with what you decide to do, and I will see you when I get back," Mary said, and Tony could hear Coulson in the background. "Have a good weekend, Tony!"
Tony let out a loud laugh, with a snort working its way out, making Steve grin as he bit back his own giggles. "That date was an unmitigated disaster! And it wasn't even my fault!" Steve just grinned, then pointed up as Jarvis started to speak.
"For that project you were working on, right?" Seemed Steve had a good memory. That or Peter kept talking about it; could be either honestly.
"Does Wade live far away?" Peter shook his head when Tony asked, and Tony hummed, nodding. "How about we make something for Wade to eat? We'll them dinner, and then make Wade something sweet, like, maybe cupcakes?" Peter's eyes lit up and he smiled, nodding. "Yeah? You like that idea?"
Steve hummed, nodding a little. It still didn't explain why Tony had come out so quickly. "What do you know?" Tony looked at him. "You found something first, and connected a couple of dots."
"I hope you aren't going to try and pull the guilt card," Mary followed him around, pulling his arm away from starting to unpack some of the stuff. "I know for a fact that traveling isn't hard for you, and I know that there's a SI office in New York."
Another spot appeared on the floor, followed by another, and another, until there was a trail leading to the elevator. The doors opened, the light dim, but comforting to Peter after his nightmare. "I'm sure that both of them will be happy to see you, Young Master. They always are." Peter nodded, holding the stuffed animal against his cheek.
“No, it’s called giving the two guys from a different century an actual shot,” Tony shot back. “Sam likes to do a lot of feinting, usually to the tight because of your metal arm,” he said to Bucky. “Steve, when you get the ball, barrel down the center, do not let Rhodey push you to the sides. Use your agility if you have too, it’s not cheating if you jump over him.”
"Finding a barber is less of a priority when you're traveling the world," Bruce said, smiling a little when Tony let go. "I do have half a mind to let you die to heavy metal poisoning now, though." Tony frowned at him, and Bruce raised an eyebrow. "The SHIELD Agent that picked me up?"
"Then it will be my duty to stop you," Steve replied, hands on his hips in a faux superhero pose. Tony took his fingers off the handles of the nozzles, the rest of the kids already done. They were watching the standoff now, big eyes as they watched Captain America and Peter's Dad start to circle each other.
Bruce walked in, a small smile on his face, stethoscope in his hand. "Just going to make it clear, this is not going to be a regular thing." Mary smiled at him, nodding once, and Tony sat back on his legs.
"That's right," Tony smiled. he reached a door at the end of the hallway, a little panel slid out from the wall, lighting up. Tony put his hand on the panel, the panel scanning his hand, and there the sound of a lock unlatching. The door clicked and started to slide open.
"You rang for me, Brucie-bear?" Tony says as he walked into the lab, unbuttoning the top two buttons of his dress shirt now. With the tie already gone he was feeling a bit more relaxed. When he looked at Bruce, he saw how tense the man was, pensive, and his eyes possibly tinging a little green. Not good. They don't say another word and Bruce motions to the computer screen in front of him.
Tony jumped a little when Bruce put a hand on his back, starting to gather him towards the main deck of the carrier. Tony let Bruce enter first, needing a minute to himself. He could hear Fury talking to Loki through the speakers, he wanted to analyze this without anyone else around.
"Peter, why don't you go put your bag in your room?" Mary told him. "Daddy's gonna stay for dinner, but you still have to get washed up."
"Well, I'm not going to have you watch something like Star Trek and have you miss everything." Tony scoffed a little like he was insulted. "Maybe a series instead of movie, there are a couple of those where you can watch most of the first season and not miss much, or just watch them again." The elevator doors opened and the duo walked out and towards the kitchen. "I'm feeling some hot chocolate, how about you?" He didn't wait for Steve's answer before he reached into one of the cupboards.
Unbeta'd, and Marvel owns more of this than I do. Also, all music/movies/tv shows belongs to those that wrote/performed/produced/etc them. I use them for humor and good times.
Tony's hands fisted in Steve's shirt tightly. It would be so easy for him to lay the blame at Steve's feet. Howard was dead and gone, and Tony kept find new reason to be thankful for that, and the reason that he had put time and money into the research was holding onto him. The man that he was constantly compared to as a child, said he would never live up to, to always be a disappointment in his father's eyes, was whispering in his ear. It would be so easy.
“You two were perfect,” Tony reassured them. “Clint and Natasha are gonna get you away from the fight, alright? I’m gonna help Pops clean this up real quick, and then we can go home.”
Tony thought for a second before answering. "Not like you can," he decided on. "I draw designs, like for the arc reactor, or for the Tower that I built. But those are more blueprints." Tony knew that Peter was smart, but he also knew that his school wasn't going to be teaching the kids anything about technical design. He tried to keep things simple enough, but didn't want to insult Peter's intelligence. These were things that he would teach his son, if he had an interest in them. "My drawings consist more of rulers and straight lines, more exact measurements. Not much imagination needed on my end I'm afraid."
Both men were barely paying attention when it happened. "Tony?" Tony's head whipped up at Howard's voice. "You're too young to understand this right now, so I thought I would put it on film for you." Tony frowned, leaned forward in his seat a little, vaguely aware of Bruce doing the same besides him. "I built this, for you." On film, his dad motioned towards the model of what was now the Stark Expo. "And someday you'll realize that it represents a whole lot more than just people's inventions. It represent my life's work. This is the key to the future." Was his dad really trying to tell him that the Stark Expo was the legacy he wanted Tony to live up, too? "I'm limited by the technology of my time, but one day you'll figure this out. And when you do, you will change the world. What is, and always will be, my greatest creation, is you."
Tony leaned over a bit to grab the knife that was thrown, folding it back up. He held it out to her, and she grabbed it with a shaking hand. "That's yours?"
"I can feel you stressing from here, I'm very familiar with the feeling." Tony grabbed a tablet and pulled up the series. "Seriously, I'm holding nothing against you. I don't think that you're some Hydra plant here to try and kill me and Steve, and I don't think that you’re Barnes' Handler. Although, you kind of are."
"No one's investing in any lessons," Steve replied as he put the uniform in his bag, followed by his gloves and belt. "I don't actually plan on dancing again anytime soon."
“They don’t stand a chance against Iron Man and Captain America,” Tony heard Peter telling Jamie. Wade was running after Clint to the other car, and Natasha was giving him a pointed look.
"The render is complete, Sir," Jarvis announced, pulling Tony's attention away from the TV. Tony looked over and saw the Mark II, soon to be Mark III, in all gold. He wrinkled his nose a little, taking a drink from his glass.
"In Ohio," Tony answered, eyes still on the Starkpad. To be fair, he hadn't started keeping tabs on Steve until day two, and that was because Peter had asked about him. "This is atrocious," he muttered. "What kind of travel playlist is this?" Bruce raised an eyebrow at him. "He's listening to Mandy Moore!"
"Grab your bags first," Mary said when she saw that they were poised to run inside. "You can drop them off in Peter's bedroom first. We're eating on the family floor."
"Do you know who attacked?" Steve could hear some papers shuffling in the background, and knew that she had to be in her office in California. Probably going to be working overtime for the next couple of days.
"The same that you have," Bruce clarified. "That was expected though, as she was created with your blood."
How had she missed so many signs from him? She hadn't known that he was this out of whack, so affected. Mary needed to know what was going on between Tony and Steve while they had been at the Manor.
"Man, you just keep growing, kid!" Tony blew a raspberry on Peter's cheek before setting him down on his feet. "I swear, you're bigger than last time I saw you."
Tony tilted his head back, looking up at the ceiling. "Shit, I'm too tired to be doing this. Peter watched this movie once, I don't even remember what it's called now, I was only half paying attention. Something to do with food, it was based off a book, I don't know. Point is, and this is a really stupid point, there was a character that could literally pull his tears back into his eyes. How I wish that was something that was possible right about now."
Was Tony happy with this new turn of events? Hell, no. He didn't want anyone else here, specially the Neighbor, seeing his failings at making cupcakes, but now he was going to steal the thunder of cupcakes, and Peter couldn't be happier about it. Steve absolutely was not going to go with them over to Wade's though. That's where Tony drew the line in this particular moment.
"While Bruce and I were working on the new model, we went through some of Howard's old stuff from SHIELD, and we found some old films. He left a message for me on one of them, and it didn't click right away, the words that he used, and Bruce didn't comment on it but I think he knew." Tony leaned against the hutch, his back to the alcohol now. "'What is, and always will be, my greatest creation, is you.' When the nicest thing you can ever remember from your father saying to you is 'Good job on not pissing off the Board', you take a line like that as hit or miss." Tony rubbed his face with his hand. "He never told me that he loved me, and then he calls me his 'greatest creation', what is that supposed to mean?"
"Wait! Wait!" Tony frowned, now at Cap. Who was he to step into this argument? "Hold on, how is this now about me?"
“If the scepter were not lost, I might be able to create a loop to protect myself and free Stark,” Loki told him. “As it is now, I am unable to recreate the power needed.” Steve could tell that Loki was keeping something from them, something about the scepter. Fortunately, he was not the only one to have this thought.
Steve’s eyes widened and he almost fell off the bed himself. Mary let out a shocked bark of laughter, then covered her mouth. But her eyes were shining. She nodded immediately. “Holy hell, yes!” She leaned forward, grabbing his face with her hands and kissed him. “That was possibly, the most perfect way to propose.” Phil grinned at her. “Seriously, only you would propose while talking about paperwork, and still make it sound romantic.” She kissed him again, beaming ear to ear.
Vanko pulled Tony closer with the whips, laughing through the suit. "You were right before, double cycle, more power." Tony grit his teeth as a wave of pain coursed through his body, this one was from the palladium. "Now, true Stark name will be shown."
"So, I was down in South America, and we wrapping up the mission early, and I saw these flowers," Steve launched into a story before Tony could get his brain going again. "I asked a local what they were called, and I swear, I'm not making it up, but they're common name is Darwin's Slippers. I'm instantly thinking of you, more so than usual, and then he tells me that they usually don't bloom for at least another two months, and that these are rare." He had been moving steadily closer to Tony as he was talking, and he holds out the little vase to him. "And, I just knew that I had to pick them for you, even though they're flowers, and I really don't even know if you're a flower person, if I had to hazard a guess I'd say no, but it didn't matter. They had a name that I thought you would find amusing, and they were rare and beautiful and unique, just like you...."
"Clint took a team after we saw a new building pop up," Mary told him. "Got luckier than last time, caught a scientist who actually had something on him."
"Yup, that's me," Tony said, nodding, letting Steve put his hand on top of Tony's still on his chest. "Careful about moving, you're probably going to be sore. Your whole body was pulled tighter than one of Clint's bow strings." Steve started to fidget a little, and Tony's put his other hand on Steve's back when he insisted on sitting up in bed. "Yeah, you're okay now, though," Tony assured him.
"I don't remember him," Bucky cut in. "At least, not that well." He looked away from Tony, calculating the new movement, the people leaving and coming in. "I'm not who he remembers, who he thinks I am."
"Jealous??" Steve's eyes widened in surprise. "Of what?!" What could this man Possibly be jealous of? From what he knew he had plenty of money to make sure that Peter never wanted for anything, and he had Peter as an amazing son. He had Mary's loyalty and friendship, and a steady job, and was extremely smart. Except when it came to cooking.
"Sleeping is overrated," Tony mumbled. From the other side of the bed Tony pulled out some fresh blue sheets. Rhodey blinked, unaware of where the sheets had come from. He stopped questioning things, well most things, with Tony a long time ago. Maybe at MIT.
Jamie made a noise of contentment when Bucky brought her in close enough for her to rest against his chest, head on his arm. Steve let out a soft breath when he saw that, and Tony knew what he was going to say. “Fine,” he breathed out, rolling his eyes at himself. “But that doesn’t mean that I won’t be talking to them about this,” he followed up, and Bucky let out a snort, but never took his eyes off of Jamie. His face said that he was afraid he might drop her, but his arms were secure.
"Even with after years of drug and alcohol abuse?" Bruce asked, but he still moved to get a needle and some vials. "And the arc reactor?"
"Come on," Steve said, putting a hand on Tony's back and steering him back towards the elevator. "Time for your meds, and you've been on your feet all day."
“I thought we had moved you on to something better?” Steve’s fingers started to gently rub Tony’s neck. “What about the mint chocolate chip?” Tony scrunched up his face a little. “Peter loves it!”
"He's so not the same man that he was a few years ago, he's a surprisingly good date." The man and the reporter chuckled and Tony's hand gripped the phone so hard his knuckles were turning white. Did he think that this would be a play to try and get back together with Tony? Or was he just looking for the fifteen minutes of fame?
"Come have dinner with us," Steve blurted, not wanting Bucky to finish that sentence. "All four of you, come up for dinner." Bucky stared at him. "Tony will be back with Peter by then, and he's feeling jealous of Jamie, so a distraction would probably help him as well. And then while the kids are playing, or sleeping, whatever we'll figure that out, then we'll talk. We'll go from there." He saw that Bucky was unsure about what was happening, didn't really want to say yes. "Nothing else it going to happen today, so we might as well work on this, yeah? It makes sense, even tactically."
Tony looked at Steve, and the blonde saw the look in his eyes. He knew what was going to happen, the wheels were turning in Tony's head. He smirked and sat back down next to him. "Get ready." Meg frowned at him, and Tony pulled out his phone.
A couple hours later Tony’s phone started to ring, Pepper’s picture appearing on the screen. Steve had reclaimed Jamie, and they were inside the Lego store, Peter running rampant with excitement, Steve following him around with a couple of baskets. Tony really thought that they should have a cart, at least, but they didn’t exist in the store.
"Well, it's just a prototype. Let me know how it works after a couple missions, and I'll be able to go from there." Tony crossed his arms over his chest, covering the blue glow of the arc reactor. "I know I can make something better, but can't get better until I find out the weaknesses of the first product."
“There are sometimes where it’s unavoidable,” Steve said carefully. He never liked having to take a life, but he also didn’t let it keep him up at night if he rid the world of a few less HYDRA Agents.
"What was it like in the Dark Ages, Cap?" Tony smirked, pushing back one of the cars and moving to the next. "Were smoke signals used?"
"Don't want a repeat performance of when we found out about the allergy," Tony said. He stopped when he found himself up in the main hall with Steve. When had they made it all the way upstairs? "I don't know if I could get my doctor here that fast again."
"Well, in my life, I don't have that luxury," Tony said with a snort. "I've spent over six years trying to keep my son from the spotlight that is my life, and thanks to Loki, that's probably going to be ruined. Which, he's going to be here later today with Thor, just to let you know." Natasha's eyes narrowed a little, but she didn't comment on the new information. "If there were even a chance that anything would happen past what happened in the gym, then Steve would have to be ready to handle the press, no two ways around it."
"Tony!" It was a different voice that shouted his name, they had sent someone else. "Tony, open your eyes." Tony growled and kicked his feet again, trying to kick up where he thought a head might be. "Tony, it's Steve! Open your eyes."
Hi!! Okay, first, a very huge, very warm, Thank You to everyone! It's been rough, but things are starting to look up. Adulting sucks sometimes, but you all have been so very patient, and your kind words have meant so much! Small update: My mom is kicking butt in Physical Therapy. Her surgeon had said that she'd never walk again, but she's proving him wrong by getting a recommendation for a prosthetic. She's beating the odds and getting better step by step. Now we're just addressing issues that have to do with her finances, and finding places to live, for her, and myself. (Down below I've posted a picture I sneaked while she was working in therapy.)
"Ouch, hitting that guilt nerve," Tony muttered, keeping Jamie from falling on her back as she drank from her bottle.
Bruce glanced at Tony, then looked back at Steve, and pulled his glasses off. "I've been able to confirm, that from the sample that was found, it's human DNA." That had a hard look from everyone in the room. Tony had looked back down at the tablet, still trying to process that what he was looking at was actually in the process of happening. "They're experimenting with cloning, and they've moved on to humans."
"Can't say that I won't be glad to have them around," Tony nodded. "Now we're just missing our favorite Demi-God and it'll be a full reunion."
The faceplate lifted and Steve was moving to remove it. “Wait,” Tony said softly. He bit back a wave of nausea as he gave the command for the suit to retract, folding back up into his case. He stumbled and Steve wrapped his arm around his waist, letting him lean against his side.
"Non-lethal, uh," she waved her hand a little as she thought, searching for a word. "Reconnaissance only. We need to know where he is, and if he sent the shooter after Julie and, or, Wade." Steve tilted his head a little at her, silently asking what she was up, too.
“Tony, we need to get you out of here,” Steve said quietly, and Tony was thankful. “You’re heading is still bleeding, front and back, and you look like death warmed over.”
"I know for a fact that you're not religious," Steve commented as they put the plates down on the counter. Tony moved to the other side of the bar, leaning down to pull out the small ice bucket as Steve grabbed two tall glasses. "Are you telling me you think Angels are real? Like Cas?"
“You stay up here, I’m going to go and get Steve and Bruce.” Tony let out a sigh as Mary left the bedroom. His head dropped back and he fought back giving out an audible groan.
Seriously, everyone is awesome! Your comments make my day when I read them! I read each one, and I'm gong to try and start responding to everyone as well.
"I had a bad dream, Daddy," Peter told him, cuddling up against Tony, his hand on the arc reactor. "You were there, but then you weren't, and I couldn't find you."
"Doesn't matter," Tony told them. "If he frees Loki, or kills him, the tesseract's lost." Tony was not going to let that happen. He turned, heading to the end of the bay doors.
The ground rumbled and Mary looked around. Concrete started to move from in front of Pepper, something coming up. Correction, Obidiah Stane was breaking through the ground with his suit. He flung the concrete up and Mary ducked down to cover Peter. Mary saw out of the corner of her eye Pepper fall tot he ground, a smaller piece of concrete catching her in the temple. She was still alive, she could see the movement of her chest. Mary stood up, about to check on her, but was stopped by the giant of a machine.
"I might make an exception," Tony muttered, and Rachel looked a little smugly at Steve. He turned back towards George, who now looked pleased with himself. "Give me one good reason why I shouldn't call the police, or get the other Avengers in here. They are all here, you know."
Tony's eyes wandered over to the hot rod that he worked on little by little, the one he had been working on before his flight to Afghanistan. "Tell you what, throw a little hot-rod red in there." He finished his glass, pushing back away from the computer desk as Jarvis made the changes.
Steve watched him as he spoke, other arm wrapped around his side, fingers gently tracing against Tony’s skin. “When the arc reactor was killing me, I got all my affairs in order.” He let out a little groan, closing his eyes with an embarrassed smile. “I recorded a video for him, but, I thought I was the happiest I was going to get. I was ready to check out knowing that I tried to love my son the best I could. Then, I didn’t die, like, three times in one week, and I found out who you really were. Then you go and do this thing, making me fall for you, and then, holy crap, I found out I could actually be happier.” Tony looked at him and smiled, stretching his leg against Steve’s side. “Then you went and did something like this. Let me tell you Steve, I’ve had a lot of sex in my life, and I’ve never gotten close to how you make me feel. Even when you’re not making me see the meaning of life.”
"I can't deal with you!" Tony threw his hands up, turning to leave the room. Steve caught up with him quickly, walking next to him back down the hallway. "The Twenty-First Century has corrupted you Steven Rogers."
The Winter Soldier let go and Tony and headed for the door that Tony just came out of. He went to shout at him, but Steve was leaping over the railing, landing between the Soldier and Tony. They two locked eyes, and Steve nodded, before turning back to Tony and running over to him.
"You're faith in me is every so appreciated, Sir." Tony leaned up, his other hand sliding along Steve's jaw, and kissed him slowly.
"Tony." Tony didn't look up from the prototype he was working on, Mary's unamused voice filling his workshop, Jarvis putting the call through. "Tony, there are people moving my furniture. Why are there people moving my furniture, out of my apartment, into a truck?" Tony could hear the inquisitive coos of Peter in the background.
"No, that's cheating," Rachel told her daughter. "You can't have Tony Stark help you with strategy." He merely raised an eyebrow and walked over to take a seat.
“You were humming one of my songs to me.” Steve got a silly little smile on his face, looking at Tony. He reached his hands up to tangle in Tony’s hair. “I almost didn’t recognize it, because you slowed it down. I don’t get to hear your voice enough, will you sing it to me?” He pulled Tony’s head closer to his, their foreheads resting together, Steve’s arms moving to hold onto him.
"Good night, Tony," she smiled at him. Tony looked at her for a second, then nodded, giving a little smile. He continued upstairs, pausing between the doors to his room, and Peter's room.
“What exactly are they doing?” Steve spoke for the first time. “Or rather what are they trying to get you to teach them?”
Steve frowned as he watched another news station. It had already been a week after Monaco, and Anthony Stark was still one of the top stories. The cameras hounded him at every turn, so much that you could barely see the man when they showed him on TV; cameras, and microphones, cellphones, and recorders shoved in his face, Steve was surprised the man didn't start exclusively using the Iron Man suit to get around. No matter what he thought of the man as a person, Howard's son didn't deserve to be hounded as he was.
"Because you're so far from being right, it's almost laughable," Bruce said as he got up from his chair. He grabbed peter's plate, earning a bright smile and a
"I'm sorry Nick," Tony turned screen as he found one of the many plans for weapons, this one a missile. "What were you lying?"
“Nothing huge, but it explains why she’s getting teeth so quickly,” Bruce added in. “Barely noticeable, really, unless one were looking for it.”
“Stop!” Steve tried to command, hand cover up to Jamie’s head, turning her head slightly so she was looking away from tony, one ear pressed against his chest, and his hand covering the other ear. He needed to keep an eye on them, to keep an eye on Tony, but he couldn’t keep Jamie in the room while this was happening. Jamie started to cry when Tony let out another scream. “You’re hurting him!’
"Not my title," Tony stopped her out of habit, looking over when she walked over. She set down a plate with a small cake on it, with a single red candle on it. Peter dropped his toy and squealed at the sight of the cake. "You're going to give him more cake?"
Steve got up, watching Wade for a second, seeing his eyes peek out to look at Steve again, and then he was following Tony out into the hallway, quietly closing the door. Tony nodded to Todd at the end of the hall as he went for Meg and Bucky’s apartment. “It would just be crass to say anything else,” Tony said softly.
Tony stretched and rolled his neck as he went over to the workshop door. Opening it he saw Steve standing there with a plate and a mug in his hands. The mug smelled suspiciously like coffee. "Hey Tony," Steve said with a smile, holding up the items. "I brought you some food, and thought maybe you could use some silent company?"
Wade and Peter had bonded right away when Wade saw Peter's Captain America hoodie, both boys being Cap fans. Tony thought he might show Wade his collection one day; Peter had already told him about it.
“You shouldn’t talk about Steve like that,” Tony said with a put upon pout. “He’s not little. Not little at all. Anywh- Oph!” Steve had reached around to poke his side.
He felt the jet start, and eventually take off, but Tony didn't move. Peter started to drift off in his arms, and for just a moment, Tony could forget everything else that was happening. Inside the jet, inside that room, on that couch, in that moment, Tony was just like any other father. He was holding onto his son, his child, that he would do anything for. His fingers started to card through Peter's hair, idly thinking that it was getting long, a bit shaggy. He could see the waves from the natural curls that he had inherited from Tony. Tony liked to keep his hair short so he didn't have deal with those curls anymore.
"No, see this isn't a game." Oh yeah, he Was at work. That was the Colonel voice coming out. "You do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone. You understand that?"
"It's sometimes weird how much like a little adult he acts like," Steve commented in a soft tone. He knew what it was like to have to take care of things at a young age, to have to deal with illness.
"It's been over two years though," she looked at Tony. "Why would he wait this long to do anything?"
Steve looked up at Tony, lost in his thoughts, surprised at the billionaire's appearance, even though he had been waiting for him. "Uh, yeah." Very intelligent, Rogers. He stood up straight from the wall to look at him.
"I'll tell the press about this," George said. He was no longer smiling, but he wasn't going to stop apparently. "I'll tell them how Iron Man and Captain America assaulted me."
“Yeah,” Peter nodded. “We gotta watch the last Star Wars movie tonight,” he reminded him. Steve moved the menu so Peter could look at it, too.
"Phil," Peter whined. "What's going on?" Steve skirted around them, heading quickly for his bedroom, and heard Peter's gasp. "Daddy!" Steve wouldn't let Peter lose Tony, no matter what Steve thought about the man.
"Grab his stuff, go the lower garage entrance. Give Jarvis, override code Alpha-Zero-Four. Take it all to my workshop." He didn't wait for a reply before he running back for the fire escape. Bucky would take care of that stuff, he needed to get back to the Tower. The sounds of sirens hit his ears as he ran back across the street.
Tony found Bruce first, he was sitting out in the covered patio, windows open to let the breeze, and the smell of the gardens in. There was a teapot there, and an empty mug of tea in front of him, and he was sitting on the ground. Tony walked over, sitting next to him, and Tony thought he had been silent, but Bruce opened an eye to look at him.
Tony frowned a little at his thoughts. He leaned down and kissed Peter's forehead softly, and got up quietly and gently with Peter still in his arms, taking him to his bedroom. Mary's parents were still around the Tower, not wanting to leave until Mary woke up, and Coulson was there as well, traveling between Tony's floor and Mary's floor. Which to be honest would become Mary and Agent's floor soon if they decided to live together.
"I'll get his present, Tony," Rhodey told him, cutting him off. Tony seemed to sage a little in relief, not knowing that he was tensing a little. Then after a second he asked what Tony was waiting for. "What's his name?"
Steve gently laid Jamie down into the crib, watching her for a moment to make sure she was going to stay asleep. "Jarvis can send video feed to your phone or tablet," Tony whispered.
The golden energy as able to surge, pushing back the blue light. Red streaked forward, as if to attack, and the pain started to lessen. “
Tony turned his head, raising both eyebrows at Steve, hoses still turned on the two boys who were too much fun. "And if I refuse, Cap?" He saw the amused glint in Steve's eyes.
Sam raised an eyebrow at Bruce, then looked at Tony when he felt the genius' gaze. "Hey man, we just shared a moment of brotherly bonding while fighting Hydra."
"Follow me." Tony suddenly change direction, heading down the opposite hallway from the bedrooms. Steve tilted his head in confusion, but followed Tony. He had gone down this hallway, but most of the doors were closed, and he hadn't wanted to try to see if any of them were locked or not, feeling like he might be intruding on something personal.
"It sounds like you're moving, Mary why didn't you tell me you were moving?" He smirked a little at her frustrated noise.
“He could be a Naveen, but, I don’t think works that well.” Tony raised an eyebrow at him. “Daddy would totally fall for that singing voice as Prince Eric though,” and Peter was giggling as Tony raised both eyebrows now. Steve was probably going to pay for this in private. Worth it. “Oh.” Steve smiled then, then leaned down to whisper in Peter’s ear, and he started to giggle and nod.
“You got it from my playlist!” Steve said suddenly, cutting him off. “That’s why I know-“ Tony put his hand over Steve’s mouth, making him laugh. He stuck out his tongue, licking a stripe across Tony’s palm and making him pull it back. “You were humming a pop song!”
The static filled ringing ended, and Tony heard the click as the call connected, but no voice answered at first. Tony wasn't surprised. "What are you doing in Calcutta, Brucie-bear?"
"I'll respect the restraining order, and keep the pictures private," the man said. "For a nice seven figure sum."
"Why are you encouraging this," Tony said, shooting a meaningless glare at the Captain. "I don't have room in my house for half of New York!"
The sound of smacking skin had caught Steve’s attention, and that’s when he saw Tony. Almost vibrating on the couch. Loki looked over at him, slowly standing up to move away from Tony. He wasn’t spooked, but the look in his eyes said that he didn’t want to take the risk of a bomb going off in his face. And that’s what Tony looked like. Steve started to step closer, as did Rhodey, but Bruce had put a hand on Rhodey’s arm to stop him, shaking his head a little.
"I was very specific with them, to not aim for your head when they brought you in," the man continued like Tony hadn't said anything. "I am glad to see they listened. I need your mind intact."
"I believe we've been over those," he said with a bop to Peter's nose. "You can't stay here alone. They don't need Iron Man for this one, so we get to chill in the-"
"The best way to do something you don't want too," he said with a nod, then looked at her. "I can kind of relate though, you know." She tilted her head a little. "Just found out that my Dad was part of Hydra as well, and that he was trying to make me something else."
"Well, in a few weeks I'll come over there." He grabbed all his clothes and laid them out on the bed, starting to get dressed. "For your birthday we'll start looking-"
“Our little girl is smart, she knows what I mean.” Tony smiled at Jamie. “Listen, Papa wants to take me out, and it’s kind of a special night. So, I think that our big girl can be courageous, for just one night.” Steve moved her around until he was able to lift her from his arms and move her over to Mary’s arms.
Tony was aware of Pepper stopping Steve from following him past a certain point, hidden from the cameras and reporters. Flashes started going off as soon as Tony got closer to the mic. Tony waited a couple of moments, looking out at them, putting names with faces, mentally putting together the pecking order for questions. His smile was up, his game was on, the counter had started.
"He's still very well-behaved," Tony said before William could say anything to his wife. Tony needed to prove to her that he was at least a little bit competent. "Mary keeps me in check as well, but when I have Peter we still have chores and rules at the house. His homework comes first, but he also knows that he can ask me for help if he's having trouble with it. I've only had to punish him twice, and I didn't like it all, but I also didn't leave it for Mary to handle when she picked him up." Tony cleared his throat a little, leaning back into the seat. "I'm not the parent that Mary is, but I love Peter, but know that I am still his parent."
"We'll be safe," Peter replied happily. Tony chuckled and couldn't help but pick up Peter as they walked by the couch. He ducked when the glass exploded inside, covering Peter with his own body, shards hitting his back. Peter clenched up, holding onto Tony tightly.
"That's what he told me," she told the Super Soldier. "I dated him for five months, Steve," she said quietly, almost imploring him to not think that she was a spy, or something else. "He was abroad most of the time, I didn't know what he was doing, or who he was working for." Steve pursed his lips, arms crossed over his chest.
"It's like I get high," Meg said, coming out of the bathroom, pulling her, now blonde hair, into a ponytail. Tony hadn't noticed the change in hair color when they walked in. "Really I just get real giggly, I'm in an amazing mood, and my pupils dilate. I remember almost everything though, but when it's happening, I'm not really aware of what I'm doing. I'm technically under the influence, of cherries."
“Sir, Captain Rogers is on his way down, with Young Lady Jamie.” Jarvis’ voice brought his out of his thoughts and he grunted a little in the affirmative. Tony leaned back, stretching his arms, and listened to the carious joints cracking as he did so. He was pretty sure that he had missed breakfast and lunch, and it was probably getting close to dinner.
Steve nodded, examining the metal piece that would go on his back. "Thanks, Tony." Steve smiled at him and Tony leaned against the table so he didn't react to the flutter of warmth in his chest. He shrugged a little.
"Seriously, Tony," Bruce said with a little sigh. "Go do something around the tower, find something to take up your time until Peter gets back."
"Peter," Tony breathed as he tried to get up. He stumbled and Steve reached out to steady him before he went back down to the ground. "Where's Peter!"
“This is going to end so badly.” Tony had one arm wrapped around his stomach, his other hand pressed up to his hand. Steve was standing next to him. “Just, so awful.”
If the results were positive,... Well, he wasn't actually sure. They would probably try to pay her off, enough money both Mother and baby would be set for a good many years. He was 27, the CEO of a Weapons Manufacturing Company, he traveled when he wasn't out on his own, he spent long hours in his workshop at home, and in the R&D labs at the office, and just generally wasn't responsible enough for a child. Also, two hours was not enough to make a life decision, while nursing a hangover.
"That's the problem," Hill said. "We don't know, sir." Both Mary and Fury looked at her, eyes narrowing a little as getting an answer they didn't like. They effortlessly moved past all the people moving files and different prototypes out of the building and heading downstairs.
Nothing about the article should have caught Steve's attention, but it did, and he clicked on it. Maybe it was because of the name Tony, and he didn't like to refer to Stark as Tony, as it would mix him up with Peter's father.
Tony looked down the hall and saw Steve, raising an eyebrow as he walked towards him. "Don't you look fancy, Captain."
"We're still a couple hours out from the Tower, why don't you try and get some sleep," Steve suggested. "I'm not going anywhere, and you like to use my side as a pillow"
Bucky was looking between Tony and Steve, silently asking Steve for some back up. “Is she trying to say your name?” Tony asked the dark hair man. “Were you teaching her to say your name while we were gone?”
Next chapter will pick up where this one left off, so get ready for some more emotions to be felt! There are emotions being felt as I write this. Don't hate me!
“Tony,” Mary said carefully. “Is it possible for you to keep your nerd in check, for just one minute?”
"That sounds so cool," Meg said, hands in her pockets. Tony and Steve naturally flanked either side as they walked down the sidewalk. "Astronomy was the only science class that I did well in at University. It was just interesting to me, it didn't feel like I was putting much effort into the class at all."
"You recently watched Lord of the Rings with him, didn't you?" Clint accused, setting Peter back down on the ground.
"No, you definitely lost," Mary said as she walked over to them, draping a towel around Tony's shoulders, and tossing one over to Steve. Mary motioned to the crowd of overly-enthused kids, and smiling parents, and Tony thinks he'll take the loss this one time.
"I'm afraid Mrs Parker is leaving the building." Tony raised an eyebrow. "She is on her way to the New York SHIELD building, it seemed rather urgent."
"I'm not gonna feed a baby until I'm much older," Peter said confidently. "I don't wanna get barf on me."
Tony started shaking his head, taking a step back. "No. No, absolutely not." No one could touch his arc reactor, except for Peter, and himself. And maybe Pepper and Rhodey, sometimes.
"Okay!" The kid took off running for the elevator. Steve motioned to the chairs as he disappeared and Meg moved to sit down, Bucky staying standing.
“This place is huge,” Steve said as he followed them into the mansion. “And you’ve lived here the longest?”
"It sounds lovely," Steve said, before she could start on a nervous talking streak. "I'd actually like to do that, thank you for the generous offer. I wish I could bring something, though."
"Are you trying to appease to the Italian side of my family, Rhodey?" Tony asked as he walked over to grab the box.
Tony shook his head, taking a step back, feeling like someone had clapped in front of his face. He frowned and looked at the woman as she studied him back. He heard a low keening noise behind him, from something large, and he turned around. Letting out a shout he stumbled backwards as a Chitauri Leviathan flew past him. When he turned back around he wasn't sure if he wanted to cry, or throw up. There they were, everyone he cared about, had pulled into his home, his life, they were there, dead, on some god forsaken rock in space.
Tony looked at him, raising an eyebrow for just a second before his eyes widened. "Shit." He turned and ran back inside, laughter behind him as he tried to get to Peter before he saw Steve with Jamie. "Jarvis, tell Steve to meet me on Mary's floor!" He pulled opened the door to the stairs, seeing Todd walking back from the elevator and knew that it was already moving. He thought that he and Steve would have had time to talk about how to introduce Peter to Jamie before he got there. "Have Wade go see his mom on the Communal floor, but keep Peter on his floor."
"Curious about what?" Tony asked, foot shuffling on the carpet. "Many things to be curious about, especially for you, Cap. All that time in the ice really set you back with society."
"How did you get it all over both hands?" Rhodey asked. he was making a fresh sauce for the pasta, tomatoes and garlic sitting out, and some milk, thinking he might make a kind of alfredo sauce. "Did you not use a knife?"
"That's pretty much her normal setting." Tony shrugged a little, adjusting the small backpack. "Well, when it comes to me. She puts board meetings to shame, that's for sure. But she's good with Peter, and she never talks bad about me in front of him, so that's about all I can ask for."
Tony's bones felt tired, and he knew that Jarvis had been right to lock him out, but he didn't want to sleep. He shivered a little, letting out a breath into the comforter on the bed. It was comfortable, and he couldn't deny that just lying there was really helping his weary body.
It felt like hours, even though it must have been maybe a minute. The lights dimmed, the helmet came down, and he felt the power rush through the lines through the suit. It didn't feel as heavy now, he could move, and he could get out of there, he could find Yinsen and get them out.
“Something from a game that Peter and Wade were playing last year,” Tony told him. Steve was a little envious, but impressed, with the way that Tony was able to play and talk to him at the same time, to follow the entire conversation. And on a song that he had only learned not too long ago, with no sheet music. Sometimes Steve thought about learning how to play some kind of instrument. Before the war of course. “They weren’t too incredibly thrilled with it, apparently calling it one of the weaker of the series. But, the music was catchy, and I tend to dabble at the keys when I can’t sleep, but don’t want to be in the workshop.”
"I have a bad feeling about those three women getting together," Tony said after hearing that they were traveling in a pack. That usually spelled trouble for Tony Stark. He could only hope that Pepper didn't think that now would be a wonderful time to come back from Malibu and join up with them. He would be even more doomed.
“It’s about the only show that we can watch and stay up to date on,” Tony said with a nod. “We’re still trying to catch up on Supernatural, but we’re close to that.” Danielle hummed, nodding. “Yeah, it’s taking us a while, but that happens when you have two kids. And when you’re an Avenger, of course.”
"Did little hands take Mom's phone?" Tony asked, a fond little smile on his face as he went back to his project. He never got the hang of doing the baby talk thing, but Peter never seemed to mind, and Mary didn't care, as long as Tony never showed up with alcohol on his person, or inside of him. She said no swearing once he was old enough to start repeating words. Tony had made no promises. "You know, I'm okay with this, because I think Mom was trying to yell at me about getting you a new place. And let me tell you, Petey, this new place is nice, and you'll have your own room." He always referred to Mary as Mom, but never to himself as Dad. He was just the guy who showed up a couple times a month, that's all, he wasn't a Dad.
Tony quickly shook his head. “No, not at all. Old Tony never would have thought that he’d be happy, especially doing cliché everyday, normal people things.” Steve mouthed the last few words, trying not to laugh. “I think we all can admit that my life is anything but normal.”
"No! I'm the Asker, not the Askee!" Tony watched Steve stifle a giggle, and he couldn't help but smile. He bit his lip so it didn't become to glaringly obvious. "What can I expect on a date with Captain America?"
"How is he? Peter, I mean," Pepper asked in a softer voice. "I heard about his Mom, and then Tony having to fight," she trailed off a little.
“But why change spots?” Tony asked mostly himself. “Keep hitting the spot enough and you weaken it, making it easier to break through. The way these things are growing, it wouldn’t even take that long.”
"Those don't exactly look like swim trunks to me," Steve said as he look at what Tony was wearing, pushing the door to the pool room open for him. Peter and Wade were throwing different pool toys in the pool, and Steve pulled all the floaties off, throwing those in the shallow end as well.
To her credit, she looked him right in the eyes when she answered. "Captain Rogers, and myself." Tony opened his mouth to protest, but Steve locked eyes with him, and shook his head. Tony frowned angrily, mouth clicking closed that everyone heard his teeth chatter together before he locked his jaw.
“I can wait to meet the mini-Cap,” Rhodey said. “Specially if Peter and Wade had finally taken a liking to her.”
“I’m not the only one,” Steve said with a little hum. He pushed the sketchbook to side, then stretched over to kiss Tony. “I told you that this would be good for you.”
Tony turned him, making his movements a little jerky, making Peter laugh more. "Hey! I know you! You're Peter!" Peter put his arms up in victory. "Why would I want to eat you?"
Steve blinked, staring at Tony. He didn't know that a human could actually talk that fast. He was surprised that he was even able to keep up with everything that he said, even with the Serum. "I'm usually here?" This Tony was naturally charming, and disarming, and hostile, all at the same time. This wouldn't stop Steve though, not from learning more about this man. Was this really the same man that he had talked through a panic attack?
"I do admire you're unwavering loyalty to my son," Tony confessed, and that pulled another grin from Wade. "I do not admire the little bit of creepiness that you possess."
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah," Tony nodded a little. He thought he remembered Pepper saying something about this guy. "The guy from the...."
"Something's up in DC," Steve said with a frown, which caused Tony to frown. "We're getting rail-roaded with benign missions from the WSC. What have you been able to figure out?"
"Comfort wins out!" Tony said in triumph. "Little do you all know that my very slow plan to completely corrupt America's national icon is in full force, and I'm winning." Mary snorted with a smile, putting Peter back down on the ground, but still holding his hand. "In three years I fully expect to see him getting arrested for disturbing the public." Steve elbowed Tony's side, dropping his head a little.
"It would seem another core has been depleted, Sir," Jarvis said seriously. "It has happened faster than our last calculations. I would suggest up the dosage of-"
"I should go tell Bruce that we're back." He closed the dresser drawer and turned for the door. "I should probably also check in with Potts, see what the media shit-storm looks like today."
Steve stumbled a tiny bit and Tony took his arm, then leaned in to kiss him. “You were entirely unprepared for that ride, weren’t you?”
Natasha smirked a little and the trio headed inside. Banner met with Fury and they started talking about finding the tesseract, and Steve tuned out a little. He didn't understand a word of what was going on. He watched Coulson closely though, seeing the tense nature of his shoulders, knowing the man was holding a lot in at the moment. But, there was nothing that Steve could do at the moment, not while they were all on the Hellicarrier with nowhere to go. He found his way down to the gym, until someone needed him.
Steve stared at what Tony was seeing, blinking rapidly. They had seen the blood on the cards though, on the wall. But they had never seen the body. "Dammit," Steve breathed out. When Tony started to swipe through files he stopped on a picture, and Steve had to turn, punching a dent into one of Tony's tables. There was Phil, in a hospital bed hooked up to a lot of the same machines that Mary was here in Tony's house, and looking alive by the heart monitor in the picture.
Tony tried to scream into the water, tried to push away, to push out of the water. It was filling his nose, in his mouth, pouring down his throat. He had worked so hard, tried to get away. He had just wanted to live.
"I got Natasha, and Sam, we're heading back for the Triskelion," Steve said quickly. At least Steve wasn't alone.
Tony looked back at Steve. "You said that already..... You keep saying together." Steve could see something in Tony's eyes, something crumbling, shaking his foundation.
"But it's your birthday," Mary told the ecstatic little boy as he pulled himself up into his booster seat. "That means your get special pancakes." There was a little gasp as Tony leaned against the wall, filming Mary and Peter.
There was one knock at the door, before it opened, Mary walking in. Her hair was pulled back, and she looked a little less frazzled. She had Peter's bag with extra clothes, and Steve assumed his art stuff as well. "Thank you so much, Steve," Mary said as she kissed the top of Peter's head. "I couldn't get a hold of Tony, and they need both Phil and me down at SHIELD."
Steve was in DC, and Tony would never admit that he was giving him the cold shoulder, but he knew that Steve was at least calling Peter. Tony needed to let a couple new suits work through production, so he figured it was as good a time as any to check up on their new house guest. He had put Meg down a couple floors from Mary and Coulson, on one of the floors that held multiple apartments.
"You sank to the bottom pretty quickly," Steve said, a bit of worry in his tone. "No one sinks that fast, not even after just falling in. It was like you skipped the whole floating part of water."
Mary pursed his lips together, then slammed her hand on the button, vaulting over the bar, and running from the building as the arc reactor over powered, lightning and sparks flying through the air like a giant tesla coil. She cleared the building, running towards the cars, turning around, hoping for any sign on Tony, as an explosion suddenly rocked the building, fire bursting in plumes from the windows and doors and the roof.
"Sir did some quick thinking to remember that Miss Potts keeps extra Epipens around the mansion," Jarvis informed Mary, and Tony almost wanted to facepalm as Mary's eyes widened a little. "He then got his personal physician to the mansion."
"Ahp ahp," she pat his butt and he giggled. "At the table mister." Peter smiled and shuffled out of the kitchen, over to the chair that had a booster seat on it, climbing up. "What can I get you to drink?" Mary asked, looking at Steve. "We have various juices, water, or milk."
. It drove me nuts, Tony!" Tony blinked, eyes going blank. "Almost insane, I was starting to hallucinate from my flashbacks, I couldn't break out of them. I've been to the therapist, was there for months. And now? I can sleep at night, almost every night of the week." Steve never broke eye contact with Tony, the words pouring from his mouth. "I don't wake up screaming in the night nearly as much, but it still happens. Do I still live with the guilt of being alive, and still so damn young? Of course, every day, but now I know what that crushing feeling is, and I know how to try and make it lessen."
"Because you've been trying to protect yourself, and your son," she told him. "That much is obvious from the douche that plastered himself all over TV." Tony groaned. "Tell me you didn't seriously date him."
“Morgan,” Tony said quietly, and Steve lifted his head a little. “Her name is Morganite, but we call her Morgan.” Steve widened his smile at him a little, then looked back at Morgan.
Steve saw Tony hurry towards the front door, Peter quickly following behind him, an excited look on his face, and Steve knew that he had to follow as well. Tony kept looking back over his shoulder, smiling at Peter, walking just a touch faster before Peter could catch up to him, and Peter giggled a little. Tony reached the front door, opened it just enough to push his head out the door, blocking the rest of it as Peter tried to peek past him. Steve tilted his head, moving to try and look over Tony's head, but not getting too close.
"Even with the arc reactor, well, that's a whole different problem." Tony shrugged, trying for casual and missed by a mile. "You know, those shows about the stars, and about space? And they tell you that it's dark out there, because light just keeps going and going. Well, they're right, in a simplified way. There's so much, Space, out there, that light just keeps going until it hits something. In the absence of light, there is, nothing." Tony's voice trailed off for a second, looking at the bedspread. "There is so much
Tony put his mug down on the closest flat surface and almost skipped over to the couch, leaning in to give Steve a kiss, then kissing Peter's head. "Look at my two favorite boys, holding babies all on their own." Tony grinned and vaulted over the couch, then settled on the floor in front of them. "You're growing up too fast on me, Petey. Look at how awesome you are at holding him."
"One good thing about your Tower being chosen as Alien HQ." Steve smirked as Tony shot him an unamused look.
"Tony, you just gave me unfettered access to you, all of you, at any given time." Steve sounded awed by the gesture, which Tony didn't quite understand, but he liked that it was making Steve smile. "You trust me enough to use these responsibly. This is, this is huge, Tony. I love it." Steve wrapped his arms around Tony's neck, leaning in to kiss his slowly, hand sliding through his hair. He moaned softly when Tony pressed against him, tongue teasing at his lips. One of Tony's hands slid up Steve's neck, the other sliding around his side to Steve's back.
He could tackle this, as well as get going on the Stark Expo, and build up a prototype for new energy, run Stark Industries, and be a more constant role in Peter's life. He was Tony Stark. But maybe, there were a few too many things on his plate, maybe there was a way to make things a little easier. He needed more time, and he'd have to make it somehow. Tony watched Pepper coming towards the lab, and a few more ideas started to pop up, to play out, and take form.
“Sir has already retreated to the workshop,” the AI informed him as Steve made a beeline for the private elevator. The elevator was just hitting the floor where Tony kept his larger workshop, on that nearly twenty floors below the Penthouse. “My sensors pick up that he is experiencing an extreme Sensory Overload episode.” Steve bit his bottom lip as he waited for the cart to return up to him, foot tapping on the ground. “He has always suffered from the effects of sensory overload, but it has not become more prominent until after his return from Afghanistan, and more recently after the Battle of New York.”
Steve hummed a little. “That last one is a little hard to answer. The loss of a life, shouldn’t really be an option, but sometimes it’s unavoidable. And, what it sounds like you’re kind of describing is self-defense.” He was starting to get an idea of what Wade was starting to get at. “There are times where, there really is no other option. If the only way for you to live is for your attacker to, well, not, then it’s a form of self-defense.”
Tony rubbed the back of his head, wincing a little. "Well, kind of." He took a breath. "There's really going to be no easy way to say or explain this." Steve glanced up at him. More than anything he just wanted to grab Steve and start kissing him, wrap him up, get back to the Tower, and never let him out of his sight again. He wanted to forget about Hydra, about the visions that he saw, and what he was forced to make.
"This is Steve, Peter, he's our new neighbor," Mary said to the boy, her hand resting on top of Peter's head. "What do you say when we meet new people?"
"-and he'd try and get you back," Tony finished. "He keeps company with the likes of General Ross, so I wouldn't put anything past this man personality wise."
"I'm going to get him," Tony growled out. The files disappeared, the tablet turning off. "I'm bringing him back here." Steve grabbed Tony's arm, and his eyes flared with anger. "Don't even think about stopping me! There's nothing there they can do that I can't-"
"Do you want me to bring you your sketchbook?" Tony asked his son a little bit later. "Maybe a book? We can read to Mama later, as well, and you know she'll love to see all your new drawings."
Steve followed him out and to the kitchen, walking quietly past the still sleeping Sam. "Must be familiar for you?" Steve asked Tony as he instantly moved to the coffee maker. The older man glanced back at him, eyebrow raised. "Taking care of a baby?"
“I’m sorry,” he said, catching the attention of the Eevee. “You just looked so lonely, and you must have been in the ball for so long. He’s not around, and I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to remind you. You must be so sad.” Eevee lost her defensive stance as he talked, tilting her head a little. “I just wanted to play with you, maybe try and cheer you up.” He bit his lip, trying not to cry. He didn’t want her to feel like she had been abandoned, or forgotten. Didn’t want her to feel like no one cared, like he sometimes felt with his parents….. Like he felt with his Dad. Tony sniffed and quickly wiped at his eyes when he felt the wetness building. He couldn’t cry, because Stark men didn’t cry.
He was an engineer. He was a CEO. He was young still. He was- He was under attack. The last soldier got out of the car, telling him not to move, which didn't really fill him with confidence when he saw the young man fall to the ground, holes appearing in the side of the humvee. Rhodey, Rhodey would know to do.
"Yeah, I hear that a lot." The Agent was still talking, right he was still there. "Listen, I know this must be a trying time for you, but we need to debrief you." Coulson kept going. "There's still a lot of unanswered questions, and time can be a factor with these things."
“-but it is clear that he was corrupted early on. I can only assume by all the time he spent with Peter.”
Tony walked into the guest room and started to strip the blankets and sheets off the bed. "Yeah, I'm working on that plan. I've got a few things on my mind."
"Yup," Wade said but didn't move, staring right at Tony. Tony knew that protective look all too well. "I know you wanna talk to Pete, but you know he's just going to tell me everything right after." Wade was too smart for Tony's own good.
“You know Miss Sarah, too?” Wade asked when they reached the car, Bucky opening the backdoor for them. He looked at the older boy, then nodded once. “Do you like her?”
"He's not slowing down!" Thor started to swing his hammer, gaining speed and momentum. Tony was getting far too close to the ground, far too fast.
Mary had said that the press was trying to get anyone from SI to talk to them, anyone that might even be hinted at having a relationship with Anthony Stark was being hounded. Steve asked Mary how she knew all of this, and she told him that another SHIELD agent was undercover with him as his PA right now. SHIELD had their own interest in Stark, a little differently than the Governments', and this was an easier, and slightly safer, way for them to keep an eye on him. Steve thought that the agent might be able to help Tony if he needed it, too.
"I talked to your AI," William said after a beat. "Jarvis. He's very insightful." Tony leaned back against the couch, William sat down next to him. "He told me what happened, with that missile, and how your first thoughts were of Peter."
He sighed and sat up a little straighter. “You know, it partially has to do with the nightmares. But, I didn’t lie, I’m not having those again. Rather, I’m not having the living nightmares.” He put his glasses back on, the lenses darkening slightly into sunglasses, something for him to hide behind. “I still have nightmares of Those nightmares, does that make any sense?” Danielle hummed, nodding, giving him her full attention.
"Can he do any magic with just his voice?" Steve asked, this time looking at Thor. Thor had gone over to Loki and carefully removed the gag, handing the bottle of water to Loki. The skin was red where the gag had been.
"What choices do I actually have?" Steve looked back out the window as they drove over the bridge. "Are we going to Queens?"
"That would only hurt my feelings. Isn't that taboo, anyway?" Steve pulled out a blue button down shirt. "What about a blue shirt?"
"I'm sorry," Tony whispered to her, looking back down at Peter, who was still sleeping against his chest, little hand on the arc reactor, safe in his arms. "I keep making things hard."
"Thank you, Jarvis." She smiled and headed back down to her floor. She had a phone call to make, and a Super Soldier to talk too.
"Find him," Steve said, opening his eyes when he hadn't been aware they were closed. "Find him for me, Mary." At that point Steve wasn't sure if he was talking more about Tony, or about Bucky. Everything was feeling conflicted inside. He knew that Peter would be safe, so he didn't have to worry about that. It was becoming clear that he wouldn't have been a target, just him and Tony. Steve wanted his best friend back, but he couldn't let Bucky find Tony first. That man wasn't his best friend, not right now. The Bucky Barnes he knew wouldn't kill a man without batting an eye. Even when he was a sniper with the Howling Commandos, Steve could see that every kill weighed a little on him. He didn't lose much sleep over it since they were Hydra targets, but Bucky never lost that bit of his soul in the job.
“Why would I be going out shopping for you tonight?” Tony asked, turning back to the mirror, unbuttoning the top button of his shirt.
"Yes!" Peter screamed with laughter, trying to get away from Tony's hands. "The sun is up! Present time!"
"He's stuck in a flashback," he told them as he tried to catch his breath. Bruce was moving Tony to his side as they pulled off his wet clothes at the same time. Mary had towels and was wrapping them around Tony. As Steve lifted himself out of the water, he heard Tony give a shout, then immediately start coughing, hacking, up water. He was trying to throw off the towels, rocking his body a little, to get away from the hands on him.
"Granma likes Mama better, cause that's her daughter." Tony pushed Peter's nose a little. "She's biased, and cannot be trusted in a looks contest. But, if ever asked, Granma is much prettier than anyone else. Got it?" Peter nodded seriously, then giggled once.
Both have the same songs on them, so it really doesn't matter which one you choose. I made both for those that don't have Spotify, or can't access it, or those that even prefer one or the other.
"Yeah, Dr Banner mentioned something like that," Steve said. "But it doesn't mean that I should have said what I did. I made it personal."
“I told him the two of us had therapists, but no one would be mad if he turned it down.” Steve crawled into bed, wrapping an arm around Tony’s waist, pulling him a little closer.
Wade nodded, stopping at the front door to their apartment. He took a breath and looked at the door for a second, thinking. “Thanks, Mr Steve.” He quickly wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist in a hug, and just as quickly was pulling away and walking inside the apartment. Steve blinked, surprised by the swiftness, but then a small smile crossed his face and headed back to the stairwell.
"That's assault!" George cried out. "I could bring you up on-" He stopped when Steve stepped up close to him.
"You think Fury's hiding something?" Steve asked. He shouldn't be surprised that this was what Tony was saying.
“Don’t jinx us, baby,” Steve told him, giving him a kiss. “We’re going to go out, we’re going to get some food, we’re going to have a special night to make up for the one that we didn’t get one year ago.”
"What time is it, Jarvis?" Tony asked as he grabbed a rag, wiping his hands off, heading for the exit.
Mary followed Fury out of the helicopter, the wheels barely touching down before the Director was already out. Agent Hill was waiting for them, suits and scientist moving quickly. Seemed a full evacuation was already in process.
“And Mr Steve won’t?” Wade asked before he put a big piece of the elephant ear in his mouth. He moaned a little, grinning at the taste. “This is amazing!”
“Eeeeeeveeeee!! Veeee!” Steve didn’t stop the sob that escaped him as Evelyn ran over to him, jumping into his arms. He held onto her, letting her check him over. “Eevee, Eevee, vee, Eevee.” She licked all over his face, pressing her paws to wherever she could reach.
Tony and Peter were quiet for a bit after that, Peter moving so that he could tuck his head under Tony's chin. "I love you Daddy."
Wade got closer to the couch, and he saw some hair sticking up on the arm of the couch. Bingo! His target was asleep on the couch. Perfect. A mischievous smile spread across his face and he pressed his body low as he made his way over to the couch. He wondered if Bucky would have the reaction that Mr Steve did, always jumping and falling off of whatever he had been sleeping on? Or maybe he would react like Mr Tony, eyes widened and trying to become one with the soft surface he had been asleep on? He hoped he wouldn’t react like his Mom used too before he stopped trying to wake her up, arm flailing up as she yelped.
Tony's foot started to tap in the air and he started to snap his fingers. "Bruce is following a lead about those scientists from the Fall, a biological lead after Clint and Natasha dropped off a couple of files, and lab samples."
"Ah yes, well, the cameras don't always get my good side," Tony pasted on his patented charming smile. "I keep telling them to get the left." He stopped when he felt Rhodey touch his back, reminding him that he wasn't dealing with the usual business sharks. These were Peter's grandparents. "This is my best friend, and general guardian for the moment, Lt Col James Rhodes, but I call him Rhodey."
"Oh my god, are you okay?!" She moved forward a little, knowing that Coulson would take care of Peter, no matter how much she wanted to keep him with her. She couldn't let him get hurt anymore though.
When Tony pulled out a Leaf Stone, Vee tilted her head. “I know that these don’t work on Eevee’s, but I’m just looking to influence it a little. So using the right element might help, right?” He scratched her ear and set it on the table, along with a Dusk Stone, and an Ice stone. “We have Flareon, Vaporeon, Jolteon, Leafeon, Glaceon, and Umbreon. What can we use for our Sylveon and Espeon?” Vee trotted over to Tony’s collection stones and pawed a Moon Stone, and a Dawn Stone. Tony raised his brows, then grinned. He wrapped his hands around Vee’s head, pressing a sloppy kiss to her head, pulling a happy trill from her. “You’re so smart! Of course!” He grabbed the stones, and placed them on the last two eggs. “Perfect, simply perfect.”
"No time! I figured it out!" Tony took a deep breath and after pulling out the second piece he had to sit down. "Okay, so maybe fifteen seconds won't hurt." Bruce pat his shoulder and pulled out the pieces, setting them up.
"I probably won't see my son graduate High School," she said softly. Tony leaned back in his seat, looking off to the side a little. He had been thinking about this since Wade asked if he could get his Mom to agree to move in.
“Romantically linked with former Handler Emil Dittmar,” he started to rattle off easily. “Of direct German heritage. Graduated with a degree in Art and Art History. Considered of value and a likely recruit for training with Hydra, to report directly to Handler Dittmar. Name entered into Hydra databases at time of birth by Jacob Rosenfeld. Surveillance held, but no contact made until recently.” Tony couldn't help but tense a little. He felt like Hydra was suddenly everywhere.
"So is Wade a Sith?" Tony asked, leaning back in his seat a bit to watch Peter. His not-so-secret inner nerd was paying attention. He was still planning a Star Wars day for Steve.
Steve made a noise of surprise, but his hand was already moving to slide through the short hair at the back of Tony's neck. "You just threw a painting on the floor," Steve panted when they finally pulled back to breathe.
"He wasn't Hydra," Bucky said as he stood up, looking down at the man. "He left a bag from the spot where he shot." Tony nodded a little, then turned around.
"Watch out!" Yinsen called out to him, voice weak, but audible in the suit. Tony stopped short then leaned back when he heard the projectile headed right for him. It hit the wall and Tony put his arm out, opening a panel in the arm, arming his own little missile, and firing right away. Silence, the man went down.
“They’re not completely wrong though,” Tony murmured. “I’m can be an asshole, and brash. I have a certain expectation of people, and experiences, expect a certain level of treatment. I’m selfish, and uncaring, looking out for me and my company-“
"Were you talking to Pepper too?" Tony accused, narrowing his eyes a little. "Did she tell you to say all this?"
Tony stumbled back a little, chuckling, ruffling Peter's hair. "Hey, kiddo! How's homework going?" Tony took steps, shaking Peter as he walked, making him giggle. "Mama! I've got something stuck to me!"
“You said you would take him to Disneyland?” Tony hissed the next morning in the bathroom. “He just got back from Disneyworld, and you said you would take him to Disneyland?”
"You're going to end up with this on your shirt if you aren't careful," Steve threatened as Tony pulled away from him.
"I think something's wrong," Tony confirmed, Jarvis connecting the call. No one was saying anything, but they could hear the sound of wind, and talking in the background, as if someone were walking down a busy sidewalk, or something, outside. "Is this the hooligan adding songs to my boyfriend's playlist?" Bruce looked at Tony at the use of the word 'hooligan'.
"I'm sure even you heard about when I went missing in Afghanistan?" Tony didn't want to give a history lesson, but he had to know how much Bruce knew. It wasn't common knowledge that Stony had the arc reactor. He was very good at hiding it from anyone that might have taken pictures, muting the glow with specially designed patches under clothing.
Peter had already had lunch, before they picked him up, so nap time came just after Tony showed him to his room. Rhodey understood now why Tony had changed the sheets to blue now; Peter had been overjoyed. "You remembered my favorite color, Daddy!"
"I'll let Bruce take a couple samples, and I think I know what I'd like to do," Steve said, pushing his sleeves up.
"I served in Desert Storm," the man said suddenly and Tony raised an eyebrow. "I recognize someone healing, and coming to terms with PTSD," he held up a hand when Tony opened his mouth to protest. "My wife just cares very much for our daughter and grandson, and if she ever corners you, you're never going to hear the end of not marrying Mary right away, taking care of both her and Peter."
Tony tilted his head a little then reached out and took the bracelets from Steve's hand. He turned them over, investigating them, what they were made of, and how the simplicity worked. "Why do you have so many of them?" Tony asked, rubbing his thumb over the plastic pieces.
“Young Lady Jamie is with Sergeant Barnes, Sir,” the AI replied dutifully. “Shall I take you to there?”
Tony absently tapped his finger against the arc reactor, looking out the window. If things kept progressing the way they were, he wasn't going to be able to give as much time to peter as he'd like. He needed to set up a legacy for him, to be even more of a role model, an example. Not a disappointment. Tony needed to make up for not being able to spend more with his son.
"Sounds like a plan," Tony said with a nod. "I promise to tell you all about the meeting when we meet up to go baby shopping."
"I'll send you an update in a few hours." He turned back to his tablet, and Mary started to head for the elevator. She paused for a second.
Steve reached up slowly, gently, cupping Tony's cheek. Tony closed his eyes tightly, trying not to lean into the warm hand. Jarvis, the human, had been the last one to cup his cheek like that, when he had been dying. As much as he tried to stop it, a tear slid down his cheek and Steve's thumb wiped the tear away. Steve's other hand rested against the side of his neck, curving around to the back.
"Did you have a nightmare about that portal?" William asked and Tony froze a little, shoulders hunching a little. "Was it just the portal? Or were there other things."
"There is one more thing," Coulson interrupted him, with that infuriatingly calm voice of his. "The assassin who attacked you twice," and that had Tony turned around, "you said he had a metal arm, right?"
Steve did. Thought back to when he had just met Tony, in those glasses and hat, picking up Peter. When he saw him outside of Peter's school when he had to keep a low profile. How Peter would tell Steve about what he was going to do with his Dad, or what they had already done that weekend. Peter adored Tony, said that his Daddy would never let him down, that he was always there. Mary said it, too. She admitted that Tony spoiled Peter a bit, but Steve wasn't sure that the term meant the same now as it did when he was a kid. Peter was always respectful, said please and thank you, did talk over adults, very much, unless he was really excited. Mary had never really had to punish Peter, except when he would get in trouble for being gone to long with Wade on an adventure, but even afterwards she would smile fondly at Steve, tell him that she was glad he had such a loyal friend.
"I'm not a morning person," Tony piped up. "I just usually happen to be awake in the morning because I haven't gone to sleep."
"That was last year, and it was only one time!" Wade declared, crossing his arms over his chest, and Tony started to laugh. "We didn't know it was a cherry bomb." Both Julie and Tony snorted.
“That’s how you know exactly how I was going to try and get out of it?” Tony asked, watching Steve nod. He let out a little sigh, slumping a little in his seat.
"Yes!!" Peter jumped up and down, making Tony's eyes widen a little, not ready for that reaction. "They live so far awaaaaay."
"I'm not sure how you're going to explain away a broken nose," Steve told him, before helping Meg to her feet and to the back of the car. Jarvis had directions to the hospital already on the GPS inside of the car. "Did he get the arc reactor?" Tony shook his head and Steve let out a breath. He pulled on his seat belt and they were headed down the road. Steve checked every mirror compulsively, hands tight on the wheel, all the way to the ER.
"This way!" She shouted to Pepper as she started to run for the door. Mary had to get Peter out of there, but it seemed that the suit, with Stane most likely inside of it, was after Pepper. The agents started firing their weapons as they ran, and she caught eyes with Coulson, giving her a little nod, and she moved with a little more purpose. Peter was crying in her arms, holding onto her tightly.
"You haven't found the pool yet?" Tony asked, then shook his head a little. He pat Steve's arm, pushing a little to get him out of the door frame. Steve moved and followed Tony when he walked down the hallway, past the foyer, and then towards the back of the mansion. The passed the door that would lead out to the garden and Tony took a right. Steve caught the distinct smell of chlorine and wondered how he had missed this before. There was a glass door and Steve saw tiled floor and lounge chairs. Tony tapped a panel on the wall next to the door, and the door clicked open. He pushed the door open and Steve stepped inside, blinking. The pool had to be almost olympic sized, complete with a shallow end, and a deep end that went down fifteen feet. Two jacuzzi's sat against the wall furthest from the door, and there were other chairs, loungers, and tables sitting along the walls. The room was cool, not too warm or muggy, and when Steve walked over, crouching down to put a hand in the water, he felt the water was the perfect temperature.
"No, and you ain't telling her if you know what's good for you," Bucky pointed at him with his metal arm. "She's as likely to try and hit me as you are."
"I'm adding that to the secret list." Mary raised an eyebrow when she heard a female voice talk over the music, the song fading away.
"I made the argument, and Director Fury agreed, that you would probably be the best option." Coulson continued on.
There was no elevator, how did people live in a building without an elevator? Luckily, Mary only lived on the third floor, so he took to the stairs, eyes pointed down at the stairs in case someone was coming down, and might have recognized him. As Tony saw that paint was slowly but surely chipping off of the walls and the trim, he wondered when the last time this building had been inspected, or even worked on. Maybe he was being too harsh, he lived in a custom built mansion and not an apartment in the city. When he saw a rat trap in the corner of the stairs landing, with a rat in it, he decided was in fact Not being too harsh.
“He got here last night,” Phil said as he brought out the last plate of pancakes. “Told him that he wasn’t allowed to miss breakfast.” He leaned in to kiss Mary, a little longer than usual that even had Peter making a face, until he suddenly squealed.
“He’s being sheltered by another, nothing that my powers will aid at the moment. It’s not working against us, that’s for certain.” He then took notice of Steve and bowed his head a little. “I wish I had more news for you, Captain.”
“Dammit, Rogers-“ As he had kept moving, Clint had reached Tony first, accidentally bumping Tony’s knee. That seemed to be all that was needed.
"We kind of work and live together, and my kid really likes you." Tony's hands were starting to move around, getting involved in his words. Tony was a very animated talker. "And I hate when my kid is sad or upset, so I'd like to keep you in his good graces, and not angry at either one of us. Or making it awkward if he sees us kissing, or you know, stuff."
"I'm not surprised that he would sneak in to get back his Handler," Clint spat out. Clint would definitely be holding a grudge against Bucky for attacking Natasha back in DC.
“See, if you get dressed, then you could see Papa.” She held the little girl out to Steve and he stepped forward to take her in his arms.
"Obviously they had missed some perfect opportunities." Steve snorted a little as he put some lasagna in a couple of containers. "Do you have a bed that you sleep in down there?" Bucky nodded and opened his mouth to contest the point, but Steve kept going. "Then it's a place that you live. Seriously though, I got two kids that I plan on teaching them to call you Uncle Bucky. What kind of Uncle doesn't pick up their niece or nephew?"
“That’s something entirely different,” Bucky argued. “I’m not teaching her anything, she already took lessons and classes. And just cause you ain’t Steve’s blood doesn’t mean he don’t care about you two.”
It took nearly three seconds for Steve's brain to catch up to him, and process what he was seeing. Natasha and Bucky, no the Winter Soldier, were fighting. Close quarters, and meaning that no one could use any guns. Thankfully. Clint had folded his bow a little so he could use it as a weapon, and Meg was putting to use her self-defense classes. Steve wondered what kind of classes she had been taking as he watched her defend herself.
Also, I'm posting some screenshots of the program that I use to try and keep everything in some kind of timeline order, so I remember what's happened and when. It's another peek into my crazy mind. You can find it over at my tumblr (megaranoelle. tumblr. com)
"So, she still has the Serum?" Steve asked, hand wrapping around her back a little, more protectively.
Tony swallowed, looking at Steve. "Then I guess I need to say something first." Both Rachel and Steve looked at him with big eyes as he moved down the hall towards his own office. They both followed after him. Tony was already pulling out his phone, typing out something as they walked inside of his office. "Jarvis, get Pep on the phone, tell her it's a Code Cheeseburger." Steve and Rachel frowned at each other at the code name.
Silently, Wade pushed the door open the tiniest bit, slid inside, and shut the door again. His shoes were off and he kept himself as low to the ground as he could without actually crawling. Very carefully he took long steps across the carpet, and stopped at the wall that led into the living room, then peeked his head around to survey the area.
"I, myself, am a huge fan of the Nineties music, specially Pop music," the woman confessed. "I'm probably still stuck there, but the music was good, and just felt like more value was placed in vocal harmonies...." She trailed off for a second, not looking too positive in her statement. "Well, with some artists. That doesn't even cover some of the instrumental songs that came in the early Two-Thousands. Like I said, I just really like music, and there's not enough time in the day to talk about it. I've probably taken up too much of your time as it is."
Tony bit his lip a little. "'Cause I'm your superhero, buddy. I love you." And he was up, headed straight for the portal, the missile too close to Zero.
"No idea yet, again it depends on what they're trying to take down. Everything gives off different kinds of energies, like lazer grids and tazers are two different things," Tony explained. "I can't be sure until we get there, and I'll try to take some scans."
Tony grunted, flying back, almost dropping from the sky from the resulting energy wave. "The barrier is pure energy. It's unbreachable," Jarvis said in the helmet.
“It’s a surprise!” He called out to them. Steve felt like Peter a little as he looked around the lobby.
“Captain,” Thor greeted, and Steve moved his head slightly so he could look at the Asgardian. He nodded to him, but he wasn’t about to let go of Tony. “It is good to see you again, but I think that we should move so that Anthony lies down.”
Steve was resolved to get Tony a little more medical training after he was bandaged up. Perhaps Julie would be able to help the man, but maybe Steve would just avoid being in the path of bullets from now on. The skin around the shots was red and puckered from the digging that Tony had done to tried and pull the bullets out. Steve hadn’t been impressed.
"Too which part are you referring," Tony interrupted her. "The part where you were there, working for the government agency trying to get my attention? Or the part where my own partner is still selling weapons, to the enemy? Or the part where I was made to look the fool of the company that has My name on it?! Please, enlighten me, Mary!"
Mary smiled, watching Peter and Wade at the table with Tony and Bruce, all of them leaning in looking like they might be performing some kind of experiment with the carbonated water. It wasn't her problem tonight. Phil leaned in behind her, kissing her cheek, and pulled out a piece of lavender from his corsage, slipping it behind her ear. He slipped something into her hand before turning around and heading towards the table where her parents were sitting. Mary raised an eyebrow until the thing in her hand started to buzz and ring quietly.
"Or where they're doing their research," she said with a nod. "They would have a lot more information there."
“Let’s not get too crazy,” Steve said, snatching the plastic spoon out of the air when Jamie let it slip from her hand. She pushed at the container of applesauce and Steve put it down by the plate.
"Alcoholic hot chocolate you mean." Tony smirked a little. "Always a classic, but not what I'm feeling at the moment. You Brooklyn-Irish boys, always causing trouble."
"What do you want?" Tony growled out. Rachel had moved to stand next to Tony, glare pinned on George.
"Yeah, well, I work around here, and I just got out of a zoning meeting," Tony continued, shrugging a little.
“I’m certainly going to treat the person I love the way they deserve.” Tony smiled up at Steve when he heard a tiny lilt of Irish in his voice. “I’ll spoil you the way I see fit. And I don’t see you complaining about it.”
Steve shook his head a little and looked at Tony. "Well, it was nearly as bad as Fury made it out to be, he doesn't even have to be on oxygen." Tony flipped through a couple of pages. "The spear nicked one of the ventricles to the heart, but they emergency surgery to fix that, and they've kept him in a drug induced coma to make sure that it heals correctly." Tony took pictures of the pages, sending them to the doctors at the mansion. "I think he should be awake by the end of the week at most." Steve nodded, letting out a little smile. They needed a win in their column right now. They would deal with Fury later.
Turning off the TV, sighing a little, Steve grabbed his keys, and messenger bag with a couple sketchbooks in it, and left the apartment. He was starting to feel cooped up in the apartment, and Peter didn't get out of school for another couple of hours. Mary was working with Coulson today, and Steve had eagerly volunteered to watch Peter. Drawing seemed to distract Peter from remembering that his Dad was unable to visit right now.
Tony walked over to a small wood hutch, pulled open a wooden door and pulled out a crystal decanter with an amber liquid inside. Tony pulled the top off and took a sniff. He closed his eyes and set it back down, leaving the top off, but didn't reach for a glass. "The stories never stopped, but they changed as I got older. I went to a lot of different boarding schools, and the teachers didn't like that I was smarter than them." Tony was looking out the window now, having pulled the curtains back a little. "I don't mean to sound like a dick, but it was true. I was always above what grade I was in, and I got bored, and I corrected the teachers. I mouthed off when they called me a cheater on tests, and I eventually would get kicked out. Howard never listened to my side of the story, just threw money at the next boarding school and shipped me off. And tell me how I would never live up to the great Captain."
Tony moved instantly, racing to the couch, putting Peter down on the couch, rubbing his back. "Jarvis, where are Pepper's pens??"
Tony pulled up the test results that had just finished, and some older ones. He had pulled a new blood sample from Jamie, to track progress on her growth rate after she cut two new teeth in seemingly record time. He had also pulled up the results of Steve’s sample interacting with the serum that he had synthesized at Strucker’s base.
“Very little shame,” Tony corrected. “I’m sure there’s some there, it’s just, I’m not sure where at the moment.” Tony grinned, leaning forward to press his lips to Steve’s again. “It certainly isn’t going to show up in front of Rachel and William.” Steve’s eyes widened a little.
??” Steve gave a little snorted and chuckled a couple times. “So uh, he sees someone, then. And, that doesn’t bother you?”
” They were calling out to him, that much he knew. What was he supposed to focus on? All he knew was pain, what else could he possibly focus on?
"I'm almost out of power, I've gotta get out of this thing." He started to disasemble the suit manually. "Did you find Peter?? Is he okay??"
"Not here for food." The man looked up a bit and Tony felt his body tense. "You took all the vials you made?"
“Since I was ‘convinced’ that we should go to Disneyland for my birthday.” Tony picked up a couple of pieces of clothes and handed them to Steve. “I was able to get a look at some of the schedule for certain events, and there’s a reason we haven’t seen any of the Star Wars places yet. Put these on first, and I’ll help with the rest.” Steve raised an eyebrow. “And, they’re made out of a breathable material, with cooling crystals blended in. About the closest I can get to installed AC.”
"-coma! You said you would protect them!" Tony had the phone sitting on the window sill, eyes closed, wrinkles at the corner of his eyes in what Steve recognized as either a bad headache, or a migraine. Tony must have been in more pain than anyone had thought. "I told her to be careful of you, that you would bring nothing but trouble to them! She defended you over and over-" The woman's voice faded out, the sounds of someone taking the phone away from her. Tony's hand was rubbing at his temple a little, head looking down.
"Does that even count?" Tony whined a little as Steve pulled him back over to the table. "We fell asleep on the couch like ten minutes later. We didn't even get to act like a couple of horny teenagers on their first make out session. We fell asleep while kissing, Steve. While. Kissing." Steve smiled when Tony used his first name. It had been happening more often, usually in private, but Steve still smiled every time it happened.
"I bet you're as disappointing in bed as you are in pers-" He gasped all the air was suddenly pushed from his lungs when Steve moved forward, punching George in the gut. Tony turned his head, looking shocked.
After a while, Steve pulled Tony closer, his fingers running through Tony’s hair. “How do you do it?” Tony asked in a whisper. Steve hummed back in question. “How do you not go crazy with how everything has changed? I mean, I can barely sleep now and I was born in this modern time.” He was easing back into a normal breathing rhythm, and now his thoughts were bouncing around, to distract him from his nightmare.
"Colonel Rhodes is approaching, Sir," Jarvis intoned, and Tony pulled the elemental demonstration away and onto the computer, hiding it.
"Tony?" Tony looked up and over at Mary's soft voice. Some of life came rushing back at Tony as he focused on her. He was in a jet, his own private jet. They were flying back to New York from Monaco, after someone had tried to kill Tony. Once the jet landed, life was going to catch up with Tony.
"Better than brain damage," Tony muttered to himself. He flipped through some vitals, turning his head a little when he heard a knock on his door. The door opened and Steve walked in with a food tray.
“Anyone else?” Tony questioned, but Steve just shook his head. A couple minutes later a new cup of coffee appeared in front of Tony’s face. He made a weird moaning sound and took the mug, dropping his phone on the couch, and cuddling the mug to his chest. Cooing. “Hello, my one true love.”
I'm gonna pull at your heartstrings a little at the end of this chapter. Also, Steve became a little pain in my butt in the middle of this chapter, so I had to put him in time out. There's going to be a special guest that shows up, and the next chapter will probably be a long one, because I fully intend on following up Chapter 10 with lots of DaddyTony fluff. Enjoy my good people!
There was a map on a grid, most of it crossed out, coordinates written on top. One spot had been circled and colored blue. Steve glanced at the other papers, looking official and typed, and one looking like a letter. "This was the work he did trying to find you," Tony said quietly. "He had been putting together the presentation to get another ship out there to search, saying that he had new tech that could search deeper in the ocean, through the ice. I assume that's probably what SHIELD used to find you..... After nearly fifty years though, the Board would need some convincing to fund the expedition again. He kept searching for you up until the day he died."
"But, Peter knows he's allergic to nuts," Steve said with a little frown, managing to push tony into a walk, out of the garage and back upstairs. "I thought Wade knew that, too."
Jarvis informed him that the new punching bags would be ready shortly after dinner. And when Tony went to his own bedroom to try and get some rest, Tony would suddenly find a reason to put them up.
"Peter, look up, look at that baby," she pointed up, and turned the little boy to the sky. "He didn't do it, that's Daddy up there, right now." Peter hiccuped with little sobs, looking up, wiping his eyes with his arm. Mary was barely aware of Coulson and a couple other agents coming out. They were moving the wounded ones to the cars, Coulson stopping to lean down by them and Pepper. "Daddy's still alive, he came back to protect you."
"Wade," Peter said, smiling. Tony had heard this name before, heard it form both Peter and Mary, he was one of Peter's best friends in school. Tony remembered him from the time that Peter said he got in a fight with a kid who said that Peter was too short.
"You're obviously Episode Four Luke Skywalker," Wade responded, and Peter nodded. They both suddenly dropped back down on the bed, flopping on their stomachs, out of breath.
“Speaking of things that look good on me,” Tony said, sitting up a little. “What do you think about glasses? Not sunglasses, but actual prescription glasses?”
“Tony’s going to call you every horrible nick-name every if she ever adds in the missing sounds,” Steve informed him, bouncing Jamie in his arms. “You thought Buckster was bad?”
"Talk to me, Tony." Four simple words from someone that he had wanted to talk to for nearly six weeks, and he was nearly in tears again.
“Well, it wasn’t exactly hard to put together,” Pepper said, having snapped out of her stupor, not sure she ever would have seen Tony Stark acting like a father. “Specially after what happened last month.”
"It's what he does," Coulson told him. "I also think it's a way for him to cope with the wedding in general." Steve hummed a little.
"You know for all the differences we have, I am a sucker for your apple cake," Tony told her seriously.
"Nice save," Mary pushed his shoulder a little, moving him off the dance floor as the song ended. "Because we both know there are some paper journalists wandering around here."
"It was the longest they kept me out of Cryo, and out of the Chair." Bucky had stated it like it was fact, but Steve didn't miss the little crinkle of distaste of his nose. "AIM was too engrossed in their work that they didn't follow instructions. I started to break away, break the conditioning. Just enough."
“That would explain why things kept coming out of nowhere to slam into the Tower, and then disappearing just as fast.”
Steve’s chest was burning, he was in need of air, but he needed to get to Tony more. His gloved, frozen, fingers were grasping one of Tony’s wrists and then Tony’s other hand was shooting out and wrapped around Steve’s neck, and started squeezing. “Is there no one you save?” Tony’s eyes narrowed at him, blue eyes flashing, and his hand tightened. Steve was suddenly gasping for breath, eyes widening as ice water was pouring into his mouth and down his throat. He was drowning again, in that damned plane, and he had failed everyone, had failed to save anyone.
"Widow might not have been far off," Bucky said quietly. "About a conditioned response." Steve frowned in confusion for a second. "She doesn't remember snapping at the Black Widow. Any luck tracking down her Aunt?"
"I can take a hint," Tony chuckled a little. And if he didn't have to explain to Pepper later why one of his outfits had chocolate cake remains when she picked up his dry cleaning, then he wasn't complaining.
Steve pulled out the chair to the desk, sat down and reached for the first file on top, and opened it. 'Howard Stark'. There were a few pictures under a paperclip, and he pulled them out. On top there was a picture of the Howard Stark that he had met, young, cocky, and so confident about everything he did. Underneath was a picture of him with Peggy, the founding of SHIELD. And under that was a picture of him with another woman; flipping the picture over someone had printed 'Howard & Maria '68.'
“Iron Man!” Tony jerked and his eyes unfocused off the screens of the HUD and looked at Steve, no Captain America, looking at him expectantly. He had his shield in his hand, and everyone else had moved around the room.
"You hear me?" Tony grunted a little, trying to get up. "You have a missile headed straight for the city."
"I have a plan for that," Tony corrected him. Mary rolled her eyes a little, and pat Tony's knee with her hand.
“Well, of course.” Steve blinked at Peggy’s answer, how she was so casual about it. “Steven, you don’t think that he stole her from you, do you?” By the way Steve had wrinkled his nose a little, she had her answer. Vee trilled a little sadly, sitting down between Peggy and Steve, pressing her head stubbornly against Steve’s knee. “He’s too stubborn to tell Steve the truth isn’t he?” Vee chirped in the affirmative.
"But I'm really pushing how much I need to drink." Tony and Jarvis had raised the dose again last week, but Tony was starting to get more headaches, and getting dizzy again. "Jarvis, bring up the work we've already done. Show Bruce the elemental test we've already done."
Tony jumped back as the man cut through the burning car, pushing him closer to the fence. "Pepper gave me this!" Mary shouted again, pulling up a red suitcase. Bless Pepper and Happy. Tony jumped up on the fence, climbing up as far and as quickly as he could. Mary tossed the suitcase, Tony reached out for the handle, and the fence was suddenly falling backwards as a whip sliced through the links.
"He scares the hell out of me," Tony admitted quietly, looking down at the floor. "Scares me cause, well, I like it. Damned fool makes me happy, like, really happy."
"Steve's a big boy who can last a little longer than you can," Tony told her, Jarvis trailing the call through the speakers as he ran to one of his suits. "J, can you get into the cameras where she's at?"
"I'm not cranky," she mumbled under her breath. She turned and picked up the mug that held the coffee, and held it in offering. Tony eyed the mug carefully, then started to inch forward before he was in front of her. He took a sniff and accepted the mug, making a pleased sound at the first drink. "I'm sorry your boyfriend didn't tell you I was pregnant."
The room was painted a soft red color, the bed was large, and Mary looked peaceful with her head on the pillows. If you ignored the large bruises on her face that were purple and starting to yellow, showing that they were starting to heal. Her nose had been set, Steve remembering that he read that she had broken her nose. There was some dark circles under her eyes, and her arm was in a sling as well. He could see that one of her legs was propped up underneath the blankets, but she at least looked peaceful as she slept.
Tony watched him for a second, and then Peter went out to the kitchen to Help Steve with the rest of dinner. He let out a near silent sigh, wanting to keep Peter at this age, not wanting him to grow up, to keep him small, and wrap him up in his arms and hide him from the world. He watched him with Steve and felt a little tug in his chest. They worked so well together, and Steve was smiling, clearly enjoying having Peter around, and helping. Steve just looked, right, like helping with Peter was where he belonged.
' in his playlist as soon as he crossed the state lines into Alabama," Tony said, leaning his head down on the counter. "Then made sure that all song by the band Alabama were played exclusively."
"There's s'posed ta be a storm coming," Peter said to him, taking Tony's hand. "Loooots of snow!" Steve carefully held a breath, releasing it slowly at the mention of the snow. Tony hummed, rubbing at his beard a little with his fingers.
“Don’t.” Tony heard Meg’s strained voice, then turned to the other side. He frowned when he saw Mary pushing her to the ground, a knee in the middle of her back, pulling both arms behind her. “Don’t let me go.”
“Oh, we have,” he nodded. He watched as Danielle just watched him. “Okay, so yes, it’s a weak excuse.” She continued to watch him, not saying anything, letting Tony open up to her. His nose twitched for a second. “I may have a touch of a problem.”
"I'm taking a hit for the team! The team of America, the team of Earth." Tony smiled at Steve. "And you should be honored to date me. I'm a billionaire, consistently on every important list of Sexiest Human of the year. Do you know how many people would kill to be in your position?"
"They'd take the children, use them, train them," Bucky argued. "She really could have picked anyone better to date." Steve snorted softly, nodding.
"S'full ovyurself." Tony jumped up when he heard the soft response. He turned to look at Mary and saw her eyes cracked open, looking in his direction. "Ego."
“Well, Jarvis got a hit on Meg’s Aunt.” Steve tilted his head a little. “I had my suspicions that Hilda was back in the US, but still had Jarvis running a lot of checks over in Europe, too. Took a while, but back in April she came back to the States. Jarvis hasn’t been able to get a hit since then.”
Tony took a breath, bobbing his head back and forth in thought. "Well, I mean,...." He paused, really thinking about what he was about to say, and possibly do. "I have a house in New York." Mary raised an eyebrow at him. "Well, okay, so it's a mansion, Stark Manor. Howard named it, not my idea."
“Welp,” Tony popped the last letter of the word, drawing Jamie’s attention briefly. “My contacts are no longer good, as in, I need a different script. Somehow, Steve has never seen me actually putting in my contacts-“
"Oh, this is going to be fun," Steve said under his breath with a smile. Steve stomped the snow off of his boots before slipping his shoes off and jacket, Tony following suit when he felt the heat from the house. Tony started to sniff the air, and Steve smiled, because there was indeed coffee scent. Meg was in the kitchen, her back to them at the coffee machine.
"Are you attached to this city?" Tony asked suddenly. "Anything particularly keeping you here? Anyplace you've ever thought about living in before?"
"No, you've got Agent for that." Tony turned his head to look at Mary. "Is everything alright? Do you need me to take Peter to school?"
Steve had fallen asleep on the couch, Vee on his stomach, Amethyst up by his head next to Morgan. Citrine, Emerald, and Aquamarine were curled up around, and over, Steve’s feet, while Jet and Topaz were on the floor against the couch. Arc was behind the couch, but he was large enough that if he opened an eye he could keep an eye on all of them at any given time. Brave was perched on the back of the couch at the end, head tucked under a wing as he slept peacefully.
"-that's gong to make everyone happy." Tony walked over to one of the cases, pressed his hand to the glass, and Rhodey heard the hiss of something unsealing. The glass in front of Tony's Mark II started to rise up. "I introduce to you, the Mark II."
"Where am I supposed to take them?" Steve asked. He wasn't sure that many pools would be open for at least a couple more days.
Tony waved away another set of voicemails from talk shows, reporters, and journalists. He rubbed the spot between his eyes and plopped down on the couch. There were still lots of papers to go through, trying to sort out Obidiah's mess with the company. They were still going through employees, cleaning out those who had been loyal to Stane, and who had willingly helped him with the weapons, and the plot to have Tony killed.
“We’ve decided that Jamie is still too young to work on a set,” Steve said behind him. “So she’s going to have to wait a couple of years.” Tony flashed a smile back at him, before turning back to what Peter was looking at.
Tony put the briefcase down, furthest away from Loki, and he and Steve followed Natasha off to the side. Thor was looking over quizzically as well. "You took the whole hospital bed?" Steve looked at the red-head as Tony went about checking Coulson's chart. Tucked into the corner and strapped down was Phil Coulson, asleep and unconscious in the hospital bed, with minimal equipment surrounding him. The sounds of the engines had drown out the sound of beeping machines.
"I'm sorry, but Sir cut communications." The accented voice answered Mary and Steve looked at her again. "He seems to be much better, his heart rate is back to normal, and his brain activity has settled considerably. I thank you Miss Parker, and...."
"No way! I'm a young Obi-Wan, and I have the blue lightsaber. Mr Steve gets the green lightsaber," Peter said with complete seriousness. Steve glanced at Tony, starting to get lost, but wondering just how in depth this went.
"Still sore, but I didn't bump it while I was sleeping this time," he stated, watching Steve go through his morning ritual. He combed his hair through first, then started to brush his teeth. Tony still felt a little rush of giddiness when he saw Steve's toothbrush next to his own, and vice-versa down in Steve's bathroom. "Took a pain killer, non-narcotic," he added when Steve side-glanced him. "I should be good to go for the rest of the day."
"Steve was there," Mary interrupted him, and he snapped his mouth closed. "Steve was at the same battle you were. He's not a delicate flower, someone whose innocence needs to be preserved. He fought through a good chunk of the Second World War, and battled against things that no other soldier had too, or should have had too."
"Give me two minutes, then you can shout it from the balcony." Peter giggled a little and the two boys ran back over to Tony. "Except, don't go shouting form the balcony, at least not without me there, or permission."
"I didn't point out the angels specifically, but I find Cas endearing, to a point," Tony admitted. "But no, I mean, what if Hunters are out there, taking care of the stuff that we don't." Steve watched Tony for a second, mulling over the thought. Tony pulled out two bottles of carbonated water. "Think about it, though. We fight supervillains, some not so super, and sometimes we fight ugly abominations that really have no rhyme or reason to exist, right?" Steve nodded, taking a glass from Tony as he filled it up. "So what's to say that there aren't others out there, like the Winchesters, or Bobby, fighting quietly behind the scenes what doesn't fall onto our scope as Avengers?"
Steve closed his eyes for a second, then looked at Tony, letting out a soft sigh. "Alright, I'll do it. But if I look stupid doing it, it's all on you!"
“Don’t worry,” Peter called out to Steve. “We’ll make Daddy do the same!” Tony shot a little glare down at the boy as Steve laughed, almost cackled really, at the thought.
Steve leaned against the counter watching the man. "Is this the same hot chocolate that is a secret recipe?"
“Bribing,” Bucky muttered under his breath. The front door opened with a bang, a quiet curse, and was shut and what sounded like a herd of elephants was running into the living room, Peter and Wade stopping with wide eyes and looking between Bucky and Steve.
"I'll walk out with her," Tony said suddenly, standing up from his chair, pocketing the paper. Pepper looked at him, raising an eyebrow. "I was going home after this anyway." He grabbed his jacket, sunglasses still on, and slipped it on as a silent Mary blinked, picking up the diaper bag and car seat. He gave a little wave to Pepper, holding the door open for Mary, (he wasn't that much of an ass to not get the door for the new mother), and left walking next to her, hands in his pockets.
Tony groaned a little, wobbled his head, then pushed himself up from the chair. He grabbed his tablet and Bruce waved to him as he headed for the elevator. Tony checked on Steve's playlist as Jarvis took him down one floor.
"I didn't my research, and I found a Marriott," Steve said, sounding proud of himself. "It's only about four miles away."
Steve looked at Tony, blinked once, then nodded. "Alright, you know what, I've got a mission. Thanks again for the harness, Tony. I'll let you know how it works out." Tony gave him a little salute.
“Dr Banner gave me some pain medication not too long ago, and I think it just kind of fuels my imagination.” She preened a bit, batting her eyes at him. “Oh what am I doing? That does nothing for you. Need to get some guy with amazing lashes in here.”
“I think that you should have gotten this thing to go,” Tony murmured, twirling the knotted stem between his fingers.
She was being very specific to not say something. Tony didn't like that. Star Spangled Man, that was obviously Steve. "Is Steve in trouble?" Was she being very obvious with the songs?
He wasn’t entirely sure, but he was sure that his eyes watered a little, and he pulled Peter into a tight hug. “Yeah, yeah of course you can. I mean,” Steve drew in a deep breath, and knew that he was probably smiling like a crazy person, “I’d really like that Peter.” Peter wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck as he hugged him back. “I’d really like that.” Steve had practically pulled Peter into his lap, and hadn’t realized it until he felt Peter trying to adjust himself without slipping. Steve lifted him easily and sat him down in his lap. “So, I think, together, we should pick out the food for everyone.” Peter smiled up at him and nodded. Steve bit his lip, trying to bring down the smile that was starting to hurt his cheeks, and ruffled Peter’s hair a little.
Wade grinned and nodded his head eagerly. “Yeah, sure, whatever. Awesome! Wouldn’t be the first time we’ve gotten in trouble.”
"When we had this conversation, I was expecting a lot more blushing coming from you, Cap." Steve raised an eyebrow at Tony. "I thought I was going to be dealing with a lot of Forties morality, and all that.
"Sorry," Steve said, slipping his hands in his pockets. He needed to grab some clothes from his apartment. "I didn't want to interrupt anything." He motioned towards the door.
"And believe it or not, that actually helps, Tony," Rhodey assured him. "Specially for growing kids, who need their social-"
"The Serum is stable," Bruce said, moving to the next topic. "But, in a dormant stage, like your own." Tony nodded a little.
“Um,” he ran his eyes through the papers before answering. “Tony, call me Tony. Mr Stark was my Dad, Anthony was what my mom called me.” He signed the papers he needed too before slipping the papers back over to her. “You’re willing to take me on as a client?” Danielle looked up, and interested look on her face. “I’m Tony Stark. I have a whole slew of problems, and those are the ones that don’t touch the reasons on why I’m Iron Man. And I am Iron Man, I’m an Avenger, and I get call outs often.”
"Well, I am already." She waved a hand at Steve. "Here's your time to shine, strong man, show him the marble."
"Kate," Tony said, pointing to one of the ladies in the front. She was from the same station that had interviewed George.
"Stark, you know that's a one-way trip." Did Steve sound sad? Probably because of Peter. Tony felt bad that Rogers was going to have to be the one to tell Peter, but there would be no Peter if Tony didn't do this. There was no one else who could do it in less than a minute.
