"Did he ask you anything?"
The rest of the evening passed in a haze. John eventually came into his room and asked permission to sleep there. He let him and eventually drifted off himself. Only the ring of his mobile awakened him.
In a minute he heard from behind the door, "You can come back in," and John entered the room again.  The pajamas had joined the blankets on the floor and the bed had been stripped of its sheets.  John picked up the bundle without saying anything and headed downstairs.  Sherlock and Hamish followed.
“You thought his letting kids over was suspicious?”
“They got bribed first?”  Mycroft merely shook his head, and it took John another minute to realize what he meant.  “They knew her already.  They were both…” He couldn’t make himself say “pedophiles.”
"But is he your friend?" she persisted.
"Of course you can.  If something isn't right there I'd want to know about it.  I'll take you boys in."  The woman led them through the door and towards the door of the ground floor flat.  She selected one of a ring of keys and opened the door.  "Hello?" she called as she stepped through the door.  "It's the landlady, Mrs. Murray."  No one responded, but neither John nor Sherlock seemed surprised by this.  They walked in after her.
"Why did you keep it?"
"Has she said anything yet?" John dared to ask.
"Why did you think you were going there?"
"No, your honor," Lou said.
Even Graham was no longer smiling.  "Christine first," said the man in the long coat.  "She's the oldest."
"It's still not about the sex.  The sexual thoughts and desires he does have are through the distorted lens she's given him.  The fact that their relationship is such an important thing to him makes him think that."
"Tell me about what she's brought up."
"If he did I don't remember that part.  I stayed with friends the whole time, the Forresters.  For most of the time he was away it seemed just like any other trip.  We had chatted online the whole time he was there and he seemed fine for most of it.  Then at the last week of it he said that he might not be in touch with me until he got back.  And he wasn't.  When he got back he had changed.  Very drastically.  Not just physically, although he was thinner, but mentally.  Jumpy, I'd say.  A constant state of alert.  I'd find him up at night sitting in a chair looking out from the curtains."
"My father died when I was small."
"It's - it was - oh God."  Even in the weak light he visibly flushed.  "Go.  No.  Not again."
"A, um.  It was something bad."
"When did you next meet with the police?"
"Yes. My wife, Nora, passed away three years ago." Mr. Aherne looked like he could say a great deal more on the subject, but did not.
"How long did this go on for?"
As soon as John reassured him, "No, you don't," his body sagged in relief. John quickly said, "And just so you know, a relationship with me doesn't have to involve sex."
"Yes I do, young man, but those won't be much help if you're looking for this Dana Lester.  All starter checks.  You boys don't really remember when everyone had to write checks, but the bank would always give you a few of them without a name or address on them to get you started.  No store would take them, but you could still use them for individual people.  And the numbers are always different after about eight of them or so.  Whoever Dana Lester may be, they make sure to cover their tracks."  She nodded sagely.  "I sometimes wonder if all that isn't on the up and up, but there's nothing in the flat that would tell you that."
"Oh, yes.  Hello.  Are you going to be at the hearing on Monday?"
"I know what that's like.  Drinking and not drugs, but still..." Mari shook her head.
When the music stopped, he expected some sort of recorded message, but what happened next could only be called bizarre.  A voice cried “Atchung!” and another voice began.  It sounded like a child, spitting out a string of numbers in rapid-fire German.  John stayed confused for several seconds more before a memory of Harry’s one-time craze for shortwave radio.
"She apparently found a position in a clinic for the homeless she liked more."  Every word Sarah said was measured, and John wondered if she was thinking of her earlier confession to him about her suspicions.
"And you grew up in the Yorkshire area?"
"That's good, though," Mr. Rodgers said with a smile.  "He's finally learning how real friendship works.  I want to make sure they stay in contact."
"She wanted a girl just like her," John guessed.
“If you can’t decide what to do, we can always start with the Hugless Douglas books!  He’s that bear on the front and he’s looking for a big hug!”  He picked up the book and let it sit on his lap.
"I'll come up with you."  Just like before, he offered his good shoulder and Sherlock draped an arm over it.  As they both made for the stairs, John unfortunately spoke before he thought about what he was going to say.  "What was in all those bags of rubbish you've gotten rid of over the past few days?"  He wasn't sure why he said it; he'd wondered about it for a while but knew better than to think he'd ever find out.  The effect was immediate.  Sherlock froze in place and if he didn't have an arm around John's shoulder he probably would have fallen.  "No, forget I said that," John quickly added, and that was enough to get them moving again.  They both walked up the stairs and into Sherlock's room.  Sherlock didn't let go of his shoulder until they stood next to his bed.  Only then did he allow himself to fall limply on to the sheets.  "Do you want me to get you anything?" John said anxiously.  "I'm not going to try any drugs until you've at least tried to sleep, but if there's anything else you want?"
“No. No, I won't do it. I say no on principal, count me out.” She stuck her nose in the air petulantly.
“Of course, how silly of me to think so. The perfect doctor Watson having his wicked way with perfectly willing bridesmaids...”
“She's pressed for time. It's a short engagement.” John sounded like he had said this many many times to himself in his own head to justify all he was doing for Harry. He moved to another shelf as he read from the list and found what he was searching for. John took his scanner and registered a couple of pots.
“It's... not what people normally say.” Sherlock said as he walked through.
“Okay, but John, in all seriousness, how much time do you spend doing all these things for other people? What about yourself? Don't you have needs?”
“the guy who not only hosted my bachelor party and helped my wife design the invitations. He also went with us to the caterer,” Mike had said,
Dorian grins cheekily, “What? You two
Before Sherlock realizes what’s happening, John has pulled Sherlock into himself, running his hands up from Sherlock’s hips to his sides, then back down. He steps forward, leading Sherlock and then pulls him back. The dance is slightly clumsy, but Sherlock feels entirely dominated by the pressure of John's hands against him. He stops and John presses his whole body in against him – his hands crawl up towards Sherlock’s back to hold the detective close. With a powerful grip, he twists Sherlock around in his arms. He skims a hand sensually up from Sherlock’s abdomen to his chest. He uses the same hand to push down on Sherlock’s chest until Sherlock is leaning his head back on John’s shoulder. Sherlock pants involuntarily. His knees suddenly feel weak. He grins. This is what Sherlock had been seeking on the dance floor earlier – to force John to release this part of himself. John moves the hand on Sherlock’s chest up to his neck and strokes just beneath his jaw before groping his way back down. Sherlock, by some miracle, regains strength in his limbs. He pushes a hand up behind him to hold John’s head and pull it down towards himself, entangling his fingers into the short silky strands. He shivers as John breathes against his neck. The position is awkward and Sherlock can’t do much but feel John’s hands on him but God, this feels good. His mind has never been more blank than it is right now. It’s so freeing.
Josh gives a little nervous half-laugh-half-noise of assent.
“I should like to know you,” Henry tells her suggestively, his voice pitched low and seductive.
“Me? Excuse me, what about you? You ran off into the night with a serial killer. You were about to take a fucking poisoned pill.”
As per usual, very little editing, no beta and not brit-picking happened.
Sherlock tilted his head sideways and sat up a little straighter as John walked closer to the bed and sat at his side. Sherlock smiled at him and took his hand. John squeezed it and smiled back.
“For... for um...” John clears his throat, “sex?”
It hadn’t exactly snuck up on him-the feeling had been following him around all day, whether he liked it or not-but John wasn’t prepared for it when he was standing all alone in the dark outside his house. All of his muscles were wired, twitching to reach out and grab someone, well not just anyone.
“Mr. McCarthy’s boots,” John supplied helpfully. “The one’s he was wearing when he died.”
The lock slid back with a resounding clank. John’s eyes flew open.
John’s step faltered but a quick look at Sherlock told him the other man didn’t know the real reason he was staring so much.
“Sherlock.” John scolded quietly, but he was smiling. After a few minutes of silence, he spoke up. “So we’re just leaving?”
"No, finished."
“I’d like to travel with the wife.” Lestrade said quickly, picking up the conversation. “We’ve had a bit of couples therapy. I think we’re ready to try again. She says she’s ready to settle down now.”
Lestrade and John walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while he watched his friend with the interest, knowing that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.
John used to scream and rush forward but he wasn’t fast enough. Sometimes he would stay on the line and talk Sherlock off the ledge. Sometimes he would catch him.
Now John was back at his flat. He couldn’t bring himself to call it home. A week had passed and those hands were still holding him back. There was something on telly but John had lost track of it hours ago. Every now and then Mary would laugh a little and it would snap his attention back to the present but it refused to stay there.
The heat was seeping around his body. It was in his blood. It reached up and clamped the muscles in his stomach sharply, making his rhythm stutter.
“No. It was followed by claims of innocence.”
The rest of the trip was passed in silence. John tried to read the dime-rack mystery novel he had found under his seat. The plot of the story was so thin, compared to any of the mysteries Sherlock had solved. His attention strayed to his traveling companion.
Sherlock jumped up just as suddenly as he’d gone to his knees.
. So John shouldn’t still feel the heat of a man’s body on the sensitive skin of his wrist. But he does. And he feels the short, sharp puffs of breath on his face.
The place was barren without him.
She sprawled forward on the mattress. It was obvious and she wasn’t going to argue right then. He climbed over her, kissing the back of her neck, reaching around to touch her until she was trembling.
Mary wanted to strangle him more than anything then. He didn’t even know why he was refusing, even though it was obvious to everyone else on the planet. That made the rejection even more bitter. He didn’t even see it.
I hope you enjoyed.
John walked for almost an hour before his aching feet and his conscience told him to turn back. She hadn’t done anything wrong. Well, nothing new. But he couldn’t stand the feeling of her hand squeezing his leg. He had felt that hand before.
It really was a great neck, one John found himself watching even when he wasn’t looking for a pulse.
It wasn’t his ego that made him dream it up. It was just that he knew how it felt to watch his world spinning out toward the pavement and he was holding onto the tiny spark of hope he’d seen earlier that day on the case that maybe, just maybe, John was as important to Sherlock as Sherlock was to him.
“Okay.” Lestrade said with a heavy sigh, calling after Sherlock. “Let’s say you’re right and it wasn’t James McCarthy. How would you find the murderer?”
“What’s that then?” Greg asked, trying to take back the conversation before anyone got too seriously upset.
He had to think of the case. The crime scene had been fruitful, providing samples of ash and sediment, even the murder weapon.
He’d said too much on the way back to the train from the crime scene. He’d shown his hand when they arrived back in London. Driven the other man away because he couldn’t keep his own damnable feeling to himself.
John tore his gaze from the wall and met her eyes with a reassuring smile. “Fine.”
The hands on his biceps slipped a little, cupping his elbows lightly then moving to circle his wrists.
“It’s a small neighborhood.” Sherlock said, then, “Are you coming John?”
"And leave the case unfinished?” John interjected.
Sherlock was silent.
“And the son’s boots!” Sherlock called loudly up the stairs after her. There were some murmurs behind his back that he pretended not to hear. He knew John had heard by the way his back went ramrod straight and his fists clenched at his sides.
I’ve got a homicide but it’s pretty open and shut. I solved it all by myself if you can believe it. GL
John was just as surprised as Greg but he smiled and silently urged the other man to stop making such a big deal about it. But he kept gawking, and just as John suspected, Sherlock rolled his eyes and threw himself into the open seat beside john mumbling something about never getting the idiot anything again.
But tonight it was different. He could see Sherlock’s outstretched hand, his own aching to reach it. He heard the other man’s trembling voice through the phones cradled against his ear. But John was the one looking down on the world. He was the one teetering on the edge with Sherlock begging him to stay.
His eyes flicked to John to gauge his reaction but John hadn’t heard. He was watching Sherlock with a mix of fascination and fondness.
Sherlock was used to John smiling at him but it was usually when he was mildly annoyed or majorly pissed off. A genuine smile with nothing but joy was rare for John Watson, but this, the way his eyes glowed and crinkled ever so slightly, Sherlock had never seen it before.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock snorted and earned several narrow-eyed glares and one quick smile from john that earned him a dirty look from his date.
Sherlock’s knuckles had brushed against his hips unknowingly, or maybe he did know. Did he know that John would still be able to feel the ghost of that pressure? Did he know the thought of that touch brushing just under the hem of his shirt would make a sharp shiver chase down his spine?
Lestrade was waiting for them when the train pulled into the station and the three of them took a cab straight to the home of the late Mr. McCarthy.
“What was that?” She asked. He could tell by her tone that she already knew. So instead of explaining he said, “I love you.”
John had managed to take over and fill up all the empty places in Sherlock’s life so he was left with a gaping wound when he was ripped away. He thought coming back would be the easiest thing of all. To return to the one thing that kept him alive all that time but John had moved on. He found Mary.
“Isn’t that a confession?” John asked, looking between Greg and Sherlock who both looked smug for two very different reasons. John didn’t understand Sherlock’s reason until he continued.
It sounded hollow.
Sherlock stood in the middle of the sitting room, as the light outside the windows faded. He had been trapped this way for hours (days?) studying the remnants of John Watson scattered around the flat. A clock was ticking somewhere in the flat but all Sherlock could hear was the slow repetitive tapping as John attempted to type a blog entry. A few abandoned medical texts left on the shelves next to Sherlock’s books, a chipped mug sitting lonely on the kitchen counter, and most of all the armchair. It was red once, but now it just looked worn, broken down, and so empty.
“Then how do you know this is the murder weapon?” John asks, knowing better than to doubt him.
“You’ve figured out the motive then? What is it?”
She reached out and circles her fingers around his wrist lightly, holding his hand where it was against her hip. The touch shoved all the breath from his lungs in a rush that was almost a whimper.
The same kind of wordless conversation they often had before. There were words just for the two of them floating in the thin air between them, surrounding them. Deductions, questions, promises.
He won’t have to clear away a chemistry set from every available surface in the kitchen and that won’t make him homesick. And when he opens the fridge, he definitely will
“We were going to go out for dinner, but if you’re not up to it…” She let her words trail off, the question clear. His response was slow and slurred as if he was just waking up but his words made some of the tension in her shoulders dissipate. “No, not really. But I’ll make something.”
“A statement like that is suspicious. Especially considering all the circumstantial evidence.” Lestrade spoke up. He didn’t seem too concerned with Sherlock picking apart his case. More like he was just waiting with uncharacteristic surety for Sherlock to come to the same conclusion he came to.
“John.” His quiet voice rattled John’s chest. All at once voicing those deductions and questions and promises but John pretended not to understand.
The maid let them all into the house and at Sherlock’s prompting, began to tell them about the day of the murder.
“Right.” John gave a brief nod and settled back into his chair. He swirled the scotch Sherlock insisted he drink a few times before downing it. When he looked back up and met the room again, there was a small widening of his eyes like he had forgotten they existed and his smile dimmed. But it never really disappeared.
It was sometime around three in the morning, now. John would be in bed by now. With Mary.
Lestrade laughed. "We have got to the deductions and the inferences. I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without your deductions. You’re going to have to explain all of that if it’ll hold up.”
She shoved off his lap and stormed away, nearly knocking the coat rack over as she tugged hers on. Looking back, she gave him one last chance. He was still staring straight ahead, unseeing. With a huff, she pounded down the stairs out the door muttering something that sounded a lot like ‘I knew it’.
He tossed the shoes aside when he had taken the proper measurements and charged outside. John followed close behind but Lestrade and the local officer whose name sherlock hadn’t bothered to learn stayed behind, stunned by his sudden change of direction and possibly the shoes flying through the air.
“I know you well enough. You shave every morning in characteristic military neatness.You were awake far earlier than you normally are, if the dark circles under your eyes are anything to go by, and didn’t want to risk waking Mary so you shaved by sunlight. Your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side. It’s clear that that side is less illuminated than the other. I can’t imagine you’d be satisfied with your work if you saw it in equal light. I see everything and it is just possible that I may be of some service in this investigation. That is why we’re here, John. Because there are two seemingly minor details that have been overlooked by Lestrade’s incompetent staff that are worth more consideration than they’ve been given.”
He held on and just watched John with the same noiseless intensity he’d had for the last hour. John couldn’t hide from those eyes now. They were face to face. And those faces were only inches apart. He saw Sherlock’s shoulder’s shift in his peripheral but his eyes were stuck on swirling blue and grey and green.
All at once, he surged forward and pulled her into a crushing kiss. One had was in her hair, the other on her back, his mouth moving frantically against hers.
“If you wouldn’t mind.” Lestrade prompted and she nodded and left to fetch the boot. Sherlock’s smile faded when Lestrade turned to him.
Sherlock was looking up now, studying each of their faces, his eyes narrowing more with each passing second. “Oh for god’s sake.” He said suddenly, then sprang from his seat in a burst of motion no one saw coming. John watched him walk to the window and expected him to stare broodily out into the dark like he usually did. Instead, he threw the window open, letting in a gust of freezing air.
Mary spilled over a heartbeat later, her body shaking in his arms. When they had both come down, he slid off of her, careful with his weight, and plopped on the mattress beside her.
John swallowed and shook his head as the cab pulled up to the curb, trying to dispel the images that were taking over his mind. It didn’t work.
The cabbie looked in the rearview mirror and grunted, “It’s not on.”
“I…” He began, then after a moment of strained silence, he snapped his mouth closed again. She could see the gears turning in his head behind his eerily still face and rolled her eyes. He always was easier to read than he thought.
“Of course I do.” Sherlock answered, ignoring Mrs. Hudson altogether.
“It’s good.” He mumbled, bringing the glass to his lips, pretending to drink. A round of nods, forced smiles and raised glasses passed and the room settled into stillness once more.
Breakfast with Mary was tense. The couple spent most of it in silence. It only got worse when a text from Sherlock made John’s phone light up and buzz on the table.
"I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. But how the hell-“ Lestrade was cut off.
Every now and then, Sherlock’s arm would brush against John’s causing a spark of heat that flared along his entire left side. Every nerve standing at attention where their bodies made contact, and tingling when his arm slid away. And he couldn’t stop turning Sherlock’s confession over in his mind.
The whole car stuttered and slammed to a halt, and John’s face smashed right into that spot on Sherlock’s coat, the part that covered the shirt that covered the prominent collar bones that had definitely
What would John have done if he could go back?
The world was shades of white and rich blue. One spot of vivid red on the pavement around his body.
“Apiology is a perfectly respectable hobby.” Sherlock sniffed. His whole body shifted from that intense stillness. He was back to lazily peering through his microscope, scratching absentminded notes on the paper beside him. Though his words had a sharp edge, no one missed that faint twist of his lip. That little bit of smile he couldn’t hold back.
He tried not to feel like a bastard for thinking it. He had a wife and a child on the way here but all he wanted to do was close his eyes for a little while.
She rolled over to face him but his eyes were locked on the ceiling. He couldn’t look at her, not when he was washed in all the guilt he deserved but had been holding back for the last few weeks.
He woke before he fell. John’s world was always the one to tip first, even when Sherlock was falling. Sometime it was enough to jar him awake and he wouldn’t have to see the splash of red in the crystal blue and white world. But that’s not what woke him this time. The word that woke him cut through sleep, barely above a whisper, cracking but with so much strength.
“I have skills that you are neither capable of employing nor understanding. Take John, for example. I can tell that the window in your bathroom is on the right hand side. Tell me, Lestrade, did you notice something so conspicuous?”
Once the initial annoyance wore off, she decided to take advantage of it. They had settled back on the couch to finish their film and before his mind could wander, she placed a hand on his thigh.
Sherlock glanced around for his phone at the small chirp that pierced the silence. He had been waiting for Lestrade’s response for nearly six hours after the DI sent him a rather lengthy and disgruntled message listing all the reasons one shouldn’t text someone at four in the morning looking for a case.
“Doesn’t mean I’m not looking forward to it.” Greg smiled, sipping at his eggnog. The stuff was beyond disgusting. He just wished he had the guts to go in the kitchen and get something else.
Conversation flowed easily for the most part and common ground was found easily as John told the lot about his and Sherlock’s last case he hadn’t written up for the blog yet.
He slipped into the room a few minutes later, two small paper cups in hand. He gave the first to John, who took it diplomatically with a small “ta” and placed it untouched on the edge of Lestrade’s desk. He knew better than to accept coffee from Sherlock. The other was placed roughly between Lestrade and his telephone, sloshing menacingly. Greg froze mid-dial and gawked at the cup, then at Sherlock, then back at the cup.
“We’ll interview him tomorrow.” Sherlock assured. He settled into his seat, hands steepled under his chin and John knew the conversation was over.
“John, Is that you?” Mary asked, pulling open the door. There was a long moment where he stood just staring at her. He would’ve blushed in embarrassment if he wasn’t already flushed with heat. He was still as he remembered their disagreement from this morning but she seemed to have moved on.
Everyone stared as he slammed the window shut so hard the glass rattled. Anderson’s mouth was actually hanging open.
“And that it what makes the police useless.”
He felt the soft curve of her hips and the swell of her breasts. But he saw long solid lean muscle, tasted salt on pale skin. The body he saw in his mind was so long, so tall, too tall for him to wrap himself completely around but he wanted to try.
“John-” She said wearily but he threw a hand up to stop her.
She shoved at his coat and he pulled at her shirt and they had to break apart for a second, panting, to discard them.
Sherlock closed his eyes and John indulged himself. He glanced over him from head to toe, his gaze resting on the pulse in Sherlock’s neck.
The room froze. No one could even pull in a shocked gasp at Sherlock’s revelation. Even Sherlock, who sounded so sure just a moment before froze, his shoulders going tense as he realized what he had just said. His hand curled around the wheel on his microscope but it didn’t move.
He lent in to recapture the kiss but he caught his jaw between her hands to stop him. He could see the question in her eyes but she was quiet.
“He’s the father's feet as he paced. What is this, then? The butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening.”
Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I can’t go around the whole countryside looking for a left-handed man with a game-leg. I’d become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard.”
Curiosity demanded Sherlock stand back and observe but he didn’t want John to get arrested for assaulting an officer in defense of Sherlock’s honor. Again. So he brushed his shoulder against the other man’s and offered him a smile when he looked up. John seemed to relax as he smiled back but the maid returned before Sherlock could say anything.
“Retirement then?” Mrs. Hudson said, her voice a bit too loud in the sudden tense silence. “My husband promised we would travel when he retired. That was before all that nasty business in Florida.”
The train pulled into the station and John let out a long silent sigh. He’d spent the entire trip staring out the window, refusing to meet Sherlock’s eye and refusing to give into the almost painful urge to reach out and smooth the crease between the other man’s eyes with his fingertips.
“Sherlock.” John replied, the only response there would ever be. Saying so much with so little breath.
Now all eyes were firmly fixed on John. Waiting to see what he would say or do, or if he would go chasing after his girl. He didn’t.
In John’s absence, the flat was missing something vital. Something like light, or warmth. Or Oxygen.
"You work your own method, and I’ll work mine. John and I will return to London by the evening train.” He answered calmly.
John’s hand twitched toward his phone but he pulled it back.
Lestrade shot Sherlock a glare and ushered John inside. “Um, Thanks.” John said, taking a seat. Lestrade sat behind his desk and started shuffling through the files on his desk.
“Oh.” She cooed, shoving a glass of eggnog into his hands. “You’re not even forty yet.”
“Why did you go into the pond?” he asked.
“Have you heard about the case?” Sherlock asked from his position against the wall by the door.
He seemed to be talking to himself but every now and then he would look up at John to see if he was following along.
Mrs. Hudson stood up and started shuffling around the room, uneasy at the mounting tension. “Sherlock probably won’t live to see retirement the way he lives. Guns and criminals and making people angry so much.”
Sherlock said, “I’ll tell you about it on the way” at the same time Lestrade said, “A man was killed by blunt force trauma” offering John the file he had found in the mess. “We’ve got two witnesses who saw him arguing with his son just minutes before his death. It’s pretty common.
Lestrade showed them the exact spot where the body had been found, and John could still plainly see the traces left by the corpse. Sherlock inspected the ground closely and stood, returning suddenly to the aloof genius.
Sucking in a huge breath, he came back to reality, meeting the eyes of every person gathered around in tense anticipation. It was like he was preparing to make a huge announcement and he wanted everyone’s attention. But in the end, he just twisted in his chair so he could see Sherlock at the table and said, “Bees? Really?”
“You can’t get rid of us that easily, boss.” Sally smiled, tipping her glass at him. She took a swig and cringed but managed not to spit it back into her glass.
To make matters worse, Sherlock spent the whole trip staring at John, most likely seeing through every attempt at nonchalance. His gaze was like a heavy hand brushing over John’s face and along his neck. It was warm and both unwelcome and craved.
John’s eyes followed her hand, trailing slowing up his leg, while the rest of his body went rigid and still. He jumped up just before her hand reached its destination and Mary sighed.
“You’d have to be an imbecile to not realize all the evidence against you. I would’ve been more suspicious if he had acted surprised or feigned indignation. His frank acceptance of the situation is a sign of his innocence.”
Lestrade watched Sherlock with narrowed eyes for a long minute, before he shook his head and sat heavily in his desk chair. “What details?”
“If it’s already solved, what are we doing here?” John asked but Sherlock was scowling at Lestrade and continued as if he hadn’t spoken. “Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to solve. Lestrade is the perfect example of this. Aren’t you, Gerald?”
Anderson and Donovan were huddled together on the couch, trying to contain their laughter. It was only a matter of time now before John corrected Sherlock. Before Sherlock had his feelings and his business dragged out in front of everyone. He deserved to be humiliated every once in a while.
He stayed there for a long time, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but the bark of the tree as far as he could reach.
"And the murderer?’' Lestrade asked skeptically.
“I believe the motive of this particular murder to be worthy of my empathy.”
“He didn’t confess.” Sherlock corrected, “He said he wasn’t surprised they were arresting him.”
“You?” John asked, then chastised himself for sounding so surprised.
John’s date, was it Ashley?, leaned forward on his lap to see his face. She had one perfectly manicured eyebrow arched, waiting for John to correct him. All he had to do was laugh it off. Yeah, Him and the skull. That’s all he had to say to get Ashley to settle back in, to ease the tension in the room, and let everyone forget that this little horror show had never happened. But he wasn’t saying anything.
So hearing that Moriarty was back was more than worth watching Sherlock come back from certain death. Again. But after several long minutes of heated debate with Mycroft, Sherlock only gave John a small smirk before getting into a black car and being whisked away by his brother’s henchmen. John was left reeling. Mary’s hands were wrapped tightly around his arm, keeping him grounded and he was glad for her presence. But looking back, he had to wonder if those hands weren’t keeping him steady, but holding him back. From what? He tried not to let his mind wander there.
There was a lull in the conversation where everyone just settled into the comfortable silence, listening to the soft holiday music. Greg watched John sniff at the drink, but he didn’t even bother to try it so when his date burst suddenly, “How does everyone like the eggnog? I made it myself.” He had to choke back his laughter. There was a tense silence where eyes met and glanced away before they finally decided it was John’s responsibility to break it to her.
It wasn’t fair to Mary that he was ignoring her or that he hadn’t really been mentally present in days. John meant what he said on christmas day. He had forgiven her, moved back in. He was going to enjoy the domesticity. Bracing himself, John stood from the couch and marched into the kitchen. He would be with her here now. For the rest of the night at least. He won’t lie awake and think about Sherlock like he had the last few nights. He would chat about his day and listen about hers. He would cook his wife dinner and he won’t hear Sherlock’s voice in his head telling him how he was doing it wrong.
“You should go.” Mary said glaring into her coffee. John watched her for a moment before returning his gaze to the phone. “I don’t know. I have to work later.”
He had considered texting John. Gone to the brink of it so many times but he pulled back every time. He had made his decision very clear when he moved back in with Mary. After months of sleeping on Sherlock’s couch because he refused to admit he was doing anything more than just crashing for the night, John packed up all the things that had accumulated and left. Sherlock should’ve seen it coming. He even caught John practicing forgiving Mary in the bathroom mirror. But he didn’t want to see it. So he deleted all the evidence and let himself be shocked and pained when the door closed behind John for the last time.
He waited until he was tucked away in the back of the cab on his way home before he let his panic loose. John was on his way home to
"The grass was growing under it. It had only been there for a few days. It corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon."
Sherlock smiled slightly, and turned back to the maid, who was still being dense.
“Undoubtably.” Sherlock pushed off the wall and began to pace the small space. It was a familiar sight, natural to watch Sherlock’s body thrumming with the speed of his thought, unable to stay still any longer. It was easy to fall back into this small comfort. Then the other man’s mouth took off, pouring out his swirling thoughts with dizzying speed. Even that made John smile. “There is nothing more deceptive than obvious fact. Besides, a look of the case we’ll find some other
“Like you have a better idea.” Donovan snapped.
John was strangely chatty at dinner but Mary saw right through it. John was never a particularly talkative man and he had spent the whole afternoon glaring into space. He was trying too hard to act like everything was normal.
"That McCarthy senior was killed by his son and that all theories to the contrary are just speculation."
"Who was the criminal, then?"
“It's solved.”
“Maybe I empathize with James McCarthy.”
Every time Sherlock would shift restlessly in his seat, John’s eyes were drawn to him only to be snapped back to the novel when Sherlock looked up.
There were three drafts of the message he sent to John, each getting more and more brief as Sherlock got annoyed with himself. Sherlock shrugged on his coat and hit send before shoving the phone deep into his pocket. He hated that he couldn’t deny it anymore. His mind was as sharp as it had ever been, capable of solving any mystery put before it. It wasn’t a matter of whether or not Sherlock could solve the case without John. It was that he didn’t want to.
John took one step inside and looked around the sitting room. It was just as he’d left it.
“So Lestrade’s been kind enough to let us see the crime scene and interview the witnesses.” Sherlock plowed on, ignoring John’s questions.
When they’d made it through the yard and the wood behind it, they came into a large clearing with a small pond on the boundary between Hatherly farm and Turner’s private estate.
“You’re doing it on purpose now.” Lestrade grumbled.
“It’s not a theory.” Lestrade protested but didn’t get any further than that.
The neighbor is obviously connected. Sherlock had leaned forward and John had run away. He’d been so stupid, letting his emotions get the best of him. He had been on the edge of losing him forever but by some twist of fate he got a second, well third, chance and he was wasting it. He could have John the way he had him before. But it wasn’t enough for him anymore. Sherlock wanted more it was going to drive John away if it hadn’t already.
“Okay, but still.” John rolled his eyes. “It’s suspicious.”
"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder lost sight of them. Patience Moran, the daughter of one of the employees of the estate, was in the woods picking flowers. She said that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy using very strong language to his son, and she saw James nearly hit him. She was scared and ran away and told her mother when she got home that she had left the two McCarthys arguing near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the woods, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was anxious, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were stained with fresh blood. They found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested.”
“Does anyone want to actually tell me about the case?” John snapped, drawing an abashed half smile from Sherlock and an exasperated head shake from Lestrade.
The word rattled around in his head, over and over again. Hushed and questioning in that bone-rattling deep voice, breaking the silence.
Cursing his own starved body, he readjusted himself in his pants and pushed out onto the sidewalk, after the cabbie was paid, hoping the cold would calm him a little. It didn’t.
Maybe Sherlock wasn’t so infallible after all.
“And this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again. Now where did they come from?" He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the area.
He had to have known. That’s why he licked his lips, those fucking perfect lips with a pouty lower lip John just wanted to chew on, and he swallowed, that long pale expanse of throat rippling begging John to run his tongue over it, and he simply said “John.”
“More useless than the papers?” John teased.
He had done this the last time he returned from the dead. When John had thought he’d lost him forever and his entire world ended. Sherlock came back after three years and sometimes John would think he couldn’t possibly be real. He had the intense urge to reach for Sherlock’s wrist and count the beats of his heart to remind himself he was real. He settled for watching the nearly-undetectable steady thrum of his neck.
“I don’t know.” Sherlock said easily as he replaced his gloves. Shoving his hands in his pockets he started the walk back to the Hatherly Farmhouse without looking back.
His hands reached out for her again and pulled her against him, as much as he could. His mouth exploring hers as his foot hooked around the door and slammed it closed.
Even a simple case would be better than the boredom that had consumed him. He tried to begin the search for Moriarty but Mycroft was there at ever turn to shut him out. Sherlock gave up after several days and had been itching for something to occupy his mind ever since. The experiments were tedious, the violin not nearly as cathartic as it used to be, and until that morning Lestrade had been holding out on him.
Sherlock’s bow dangled from his fingertips over the edge of his chair. He’d given up on playing hours ago. He was turning over a case in his mind. It was an interesting case that Lestrade was struggling with whether he wanted to admit it or not.
The train lined up with the platform and Sherlock stood, filling the tiny space with his height and his imposing presence. John focused on his breathing as Sherlock filled up his whole vision. There was a spot on his coat that was very interesting. It looked soft, not like Sherlock’s hair, or his lips. No, it was a nice coat and deserved the attention it-
Offering him a pleasantly neutral smile, She asked, “How was the case?”
“Miss Turner will be at Baker Street tomorrow morning and after we speak with her we’ll return to have a word with James McCarthy and find the murderer.”
“And that’s when he confessed?” John asked, after a minute of absorbing all the new information.
John was on his way ten minutes later, sitting in the back of a cab that was moving much too slow for his taste. Stepping out onto the pavement in front of New Scotland Yard was like a breath of fresh air and finding his way to Sherlock in Lestrade’s office was like coming home.
It was abrupt, but she was ready. She had been waiting for this for months and even though she knew he wasn’t there with her, he was there.
There was so much joy, John couldn’t help but feel it too.
"This may interest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding out the stone he picked up in the woods. "The murder was done with it."
“I know you find this case particularly intriguing.” Sherlock continued.
"But who is he?’’
Sherlock’s breath hitched once as he, with his whole body, started to lean forward. The sharp sound snapped John back to reality and he careened away from Sherlock pulling his hands away in the same motion.
John shrugs, annoyed, “Well I assumed you’d deduced it, somehow, you being an overly observant genius and all that!”
Sherlock performs a Quickstep, the Charleston and a Foxtrot.
“You alright Mary? You seem a bit nervous.” John commented.
John sighed, “Fine,” then, addressing the bartender, “What he's having.” When the bartender turned to pour the scotch John turned to Sherlock, “Just
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yyyyep.” Sherlock answers, popping some chicken from his own meal into his mouth and then feeding one piece to Rosie.
“Seriously?” John pouted a little.
Anyway, enjoy the update. I probably failed my midterms by choosing to write this instead of studying, (update – I only almost failed ONE midterm, which is fine because I totally saw that coming and also I hate that class and I'll recover eventually)so... you're welcome. But also it was my choice and I am very bad at managing my life but no one cares about that anyway so i'll shut up about it.
Sherlock laughs, he types,
Finally John heard the tail end of a sentence: “...Well then, Mr. Holmes,
“John, we are hydroplaning, you must let go of me and regain control of the vehicle!” Sherlock instructed in slight panic.
I liked the part where Mycroft raged at him and then Sherlock hits him in the face. Oh! And i liked the part when John hit Sherlock in the face.
“So you've nothing to fear, yeah?” John said, grasping Sherlock's forearm in a reassuring way.
John gets up almost on instinct and makes his way over to Mary. Irene gives “what-the-fuck?” look in the background. No one notices. John reaches Mary, inspecting both. “This one,” he says, pointing at the simple silver chain with the single champagne jewel hanging off it.
John gave him one of his now common 'confused but fond' expressions, “Please don't.” he requested.
Sherlock reached for the paper but John pulled it back, asking, “What is this?” as he struggled to understand just what he was seeing.
Sherlock smiled wider and got back into the cab. He was still smiling on his way to 221b when he noticed a small black notebook on the seat of the car. He picked it up and stared at it for a second. It must belong to John Watson.
“Alright, John?” Sherlock asks, slightly worried, since John usually texts Sherlock rather than calling him, knowing Sherlock prefers not to have to speak on the phone like some old savage.
Eurus looks at him with pity then and says, “Oh, Sherlock. Always so sentimental.” She picks up her violin, “let me play you a song.” She holds her breath, looks Sherlock dead in the eyes and plays the first of his songs he’d ever played for her - the one he’d written those years ago during Christmas, when John had thought that Sherlock wrote it because he was in love with Irene. The song he’d written when John had said, ‘I’d say he was heartbroken, but then, it’s Sherlock, he does all that anyway,’ correctly deducing Sherlock’s state of mind, but incorrectly deducing for whom his heart was yearning for.
“What?”
“Yes, John, I
Thanks again!
“Mary... about Harriet...” John started.
. Sherlock Holmes is a fucking revelation. He has never had anyone give him a blow job like this. It’s as if Sherlock knows
In my defence I did not remember all this sadness was in the movie before I started writing this shit. I should add angst as a tag. with happy ending though.
Weeks later when he’d gone to see her again (he hadn’t dared see her on days he was still having nightmares about her, she’d have deduced it right away, and he'd been worried about her reaction), she had beamed at him once more.
The room clapped politely at little Archie.
And now… Now he was likely going to see Sherlock do what he had done to unravel John up close. God, he wasn’t sure if it was luck or some kind of curse coming to this party. Isn’t it enough for whoever runs this cruel universe that John had already seen him dancing against this kid earlier tonight? Isn’t it enough that Sherlock had tried to dance with him just now? Fuck, how is John going to survive this?
A waiter arrives at the table then carrying a board with a spread of cheeses and cold cuts, olives, and tomatoes on it. He introduces himself with a polite expression, “Hello, Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson, I’m Tony. Angelo has just sent me over to bring you a couple of appetizers,” he says, laying down the board. He’s also carrying a pitcher of water which he rests next to the platter of food and a pocketful of crayons with some paper which he lays carefully in front of Rosie. The child grins at him in delight and immediately begins to scribble on them.
Mrs. Watson inspected the beautiful diamond set into the classic silver ring now wrapped snuggly around her daughter's finger as Harry sat next to Mary on the sofa, cuddling. “Oh Harriet, it's absolutely lovely! Perfectly gorgeous!” She exclaimed with red-rimmed eyes, “... wait a minute! Harry, dear? Does that mean that you'll be moving back here to London?” Mrs. Watson looked hopeful and overjoyed at the prospect.
Dimock's face paled. “Carter! You think it's Carter?! He's the only one in town who talked to her so much.”
John!” Sherlock continued on his rant.
” Sherlock spins Irene and brings her to him, holding her close, their faces cheek to cheek, they separate and make a wide a flourish then come back into their hold, their feet moving faster this time as they prance to the beat of the song. Their faces seem the very picture of a couple completely infatuated with one another, “
I’m supposed to be doing homework. :D But fuck that shit because it’s boring. I’ll get to it eventually. Listen. I’m a disaster human. (edit: I wrote this Author's note a week before my homework was due - today (the day I posted this) it was due and I forgot and I still wasn't finished and I was working on this fic and then I checked my calendar and I saw my work was due so I finished it but handed it in like two minutes late and skipped both my lectures as a result. I hope I don't fail T_T) Don’t judge me.
“I saw you changing suits in the cab earlier while I was smoking,” Sherlock's eyes glittered. After watching John the whole night he'd figured out what John had been doing and now he
“Hi!” He greeted cheerily.
“Oh, come now, John,” Irene said, coming over and stroking his arm in comfort, “It's not so bad. It's just one measly article... in the front page of the section, with hundreds of photos of you on it... who's upset?”
Sherlock’s eyes grow heated at John’s command and then soft as the exact meaning behind his words sink in. He smiles sadly and opens his arms to pull John towards him. As John comes back to him, pressing forward, Sherlock lies back, pulling the man over him once more. He kisses John’s cheek before answering, “It was years ago. It doesn’t matter now. And as for who... Mycroft probably took care of that for you, one way or another.”
Sherlock looked down at his mobile then back up at John, his expression unreadable.
“That's my girl,” John smiled, and took the hat. He quickly removed the tule and pink flower and rearranged it to look like a boutonniere. He then ripped off one of the pins from the hat and tied it to the back of his little make-shift boutonniere and tapped Len on the arm.
That being said I have/had no idea what I was doing so excuse me if it's lacking in some way.
“Ugh... What?” He asked, annoyed as he was surprised to see Sherlock standing in front of the door, hands in his pockets with that perpetual smirk plastered on his face, “Harry's not here.”
“One, move, make one move, and I swear I will shoot you right in the head. Don't test me,” John (
”Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a gray cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search."
Before he could question it, Sherlock was charging back to the kitchen. He breezed by a moment later, the large bowl of eggnog cradled to his chest. As he passed, he wrenched the glass from John’s hand and tossed it into the big bowl. Some of the liquid sloshed out making a mess of the floor. Then he tossed the bowl and all it’s contents out the window and onto the street below.
Sherlock sprung from the couch and rushed to dress himself. The sooner he got to Scotland Yard the sooner he would have a puzzle to solve. But what then? He would return to his empty flat and…
The crime scene was a two hour train-ride north, so John waited until they were settled into their seats before he asked for more details on the case.
“If anyone’s close to retirement, it’s me.” Greg said, leaning against the desk in the sitting room. Anderson and Donovan were taking up the whole sofa, even if they weren’t he wasn’t going near them when they were in this mood. Drunk on eggnog and exchanging sloppy kisses. Molly and Mrs. Hudson were in the chairs at the desk and he refused to set foot in the kitchen with Sherlock’s experiments littering every available surface. The scientist himself was sitting in his chair, glaring moodily at the floor at John’s feet.
One single “please”.
It was the same dream. The same one he’d been having for almost three years now.
Sherlock would lean forward, the way he did just before John ran away, leaning at the ankles so his entire body crashed into John’s in a way that would
“That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. How simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same feet." He pulled his magnifying class from his coat and crouched down, careful not to let his coat get muddy, to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. "These are young McCarthy's feet. He came through here twice, running once, the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground.”
"You are right," said Sherlock demurely; "you do find it very hard to tackle the facts."
That hand was on his waist on his wedding day. In his hand at Sherlock’s bedside. On his arm as Sherlock’s plane turned around.
“I’m almost too old to go running around London.” John groaned, leaning back in his worn down old arm chair. His date came back from the kitchen with two drinks and plopped unceremoniously on his lap.
He looked away guiltily. The thoughts weren’t exactly new and John had always indulged himself, they were just thoughts after all. But lately, they hadn’t seemed so innocent. His mind no longer reacting to Sherlock with just casual interest. Now his body was reacting and it really couldn’t have come at a worse time.
And his orgasm was ripped from him with a cry.
Which set John off into giggles again. Sherlock on the other hand, wasn’t amused. He pushed up from his leather armchair and stormed into the kitchen. Hunching over his microscope, he pointedly resumed one of his experiments as if to say I have lost all hope in humanity maybe the mold cultures will have more intelligence.
There was a jagged stone lying among the moss, and John watched Sherlock rush to it and kneel carefully to examined it. He had to throw back the edge of his coat to keep it from the dirt, exposing the lush swell of his ass propped high in the air.
"There are none."
break the spell and cast a newer stronger one immediately. One where John could crush their lips together and work his hands over those straining buttons and just touch him everywhere.
Her confusion was obvious as she looked between Lestrade and some of the local officers that were required to be there. All the idiots looked confused or doubtful, one even openly glaring at Sherlock.
"How long did that go on?"
Mr. Aherne obviously knew where this was leading, and his expression grew somber.  "Moira's a shy girl, you understand.  Her brother and sister are much bolder.  We're in a new city, a new country really, and it's nothing like what she's used to.  In March she told me that she still didn't really know any of her classmates at all, that they ignored her.  I asked if she was being bullied and she said no.  I thought all she needed was time.  She did say she still played with Kieran at recess and that put me at ease."
"Don't," Sherlock replied without indicating what he meant.
"You're wrong.  It's She who's right."
"Where's your friend's dad?" said Tammy.
"Tell me what happened after that."
"No," he said quickly before disconnecting. Out of the corner of his eye he could see John moving around in the kitchen. "Is there a computer I can use?" he asked, hoping that John wouldn't ask too many questions.
"Was anyone else in the room with you then?"
"If I get arrested, would you be able to help me?"
"Did you ever find out what happened after that?"
Phillip had to stop to compose himself again, and in that time someone let out a guffaw.  John looked around trying to find the idiot who'd dare laugh at something like that, but whoever it was hadn't moved.  Judge Foster scanned the crowd with narrowed eyes.  "Who was that? Who's daring to disrupt this courtroom?"  Not surprisingly, no one responded.  "Let it be known right now that if anyone disrupts this trial like that again I won't hesitate to hold them in contempt."  After one more intimidating stare, he said:  "The witness may continue."
"Do you provide any sort of specialized care?"
Lou shook his head.  "The poor boy."  He reached into the bag and took out a wrapped sandwich.  "Will you be eating with us, John?"
"It sounds like your children are very important to you."
I was going to make this longer, but decided to just post what I have now.
"It's stupid," he said, looking away.
The man's eyes widened. "I suppose this means you'll be ordering far more fruit trays in the future?"
"But now Skip gets a real paycheck, and everything.  I wish I could tell her that he can eat anywhere he wants now.  That's nice, even if it is sad he got that because Mr. Birling died.  Even if we got it.  It's like one of those movies where someone dies but makes sure everyone they know is happy before that.  So you're happy and sad at the end at the same time."
"Possibly, if I can get work for the branch there.  Otherwise no."  Mr. Aherne kept his voice level.
"Because at least then I'd know what it's like!"
"But why did you call him?"
"Richard Foster.  He's been on the bench for twenty years.  The defense solicitors are Marvin Clark and Rochelle Harvey.  Both of them have gotten some very big acquittals."  An uncomfortable silence fell between them, and after a minute Lestrade called out: "Lou!  Should have known you'd be early!" to a man getting out of a nearby cab.
"Once that woman left Moira saw me a minute later and walked over.  She asked me if Dad had told me to go get her and I asked her who that woman was.  She said it was just a friend of hers.   I said she looked older than our dad.  She said that the woman was still her friend.  Then I asked her why she'd kissed her.  She told me to shut up.  I didn't know what to say then so I just started walking back home.  Right before we went inside Moira told me to not tell anyone about the woman I saw.  So I didn't, until now.  I didn't know it was the same person who hurt her until she was in the lineup."  Like his sister, he seemed to be relieved to be telling someone about it.  She apparently understood that, because she touched his shoulder briefly.  Kieran smiled up at her in appreciation.
"He's probably about as thrilled about child abuse as everyone else is. Or maybe he sees something in the victims that reminds him of himself? Like the Rodgers boy – he remembers being an unhappy kid?"
Sherlock made a sound of dismissal.  "Of course.  Now that K is jailed and Moira knows she is truly safe, she's far more willing to discuss what was going on between the two of them."
"All sorts.  I joined one of the school football teams and made friends there.  I always did well in school and made other friends who were interested in more academic pursuits."
"Did you ever tell Jane and Frank anything at all?"
"One of the victims."  Sherlock used the term as if he wasn't sure if he was allowed to call any of the victims by name.
"So the charges are not in regard to yourself?"
"True."  Peter said it as a fact.  He didn't seem bothered by Dr. Dodson sharing the information.
"Who was that?  The prosecution?" Sherlock asked.  That one question made John realize that his suffering had to be especially terrible if he wasn't able to figure out John wouldn't be asking a prosecutor if they were attending the trial.
"But you like Dr. Martin."  Harvey still looked smug, even though she hadn't gained anything yet.
"So you haven't figured out who the man is by some mark on the girl's shoes or something?" Lestrade snapped. There was a slight pause before he shook his head, looking abashed. "No, I'm sorry, that was uncalled for. Cases like this are always upsetting."
“Correct.”
Phillip looked no better than before, but when Lou nodded at him he began to speak again.  “When She told me to stop She told me not to leave the room.  She picked up the little boy and left.  I could hear Her talking to someone and then I heard the door shut.”
"Lots of people do. He's very famous."
For the next hour, people slowly trickled into the room.  Most wore a press badge on the front of their shirt; some had cameras, video equipment, and tablets of both the electronic and traditional variety.  They conversed with each other as easily as the buffalo did.  Unlike the buffalo, they didn't seem surprised by John's presence.  Other people without press badges came in and sat themselves down.  They clustered together and all seemed to speak in unison; none of them made any attempt to speak quietly, but they couldn't be made out amongst the din anyway.
"I'll be there watching, since I don't have to testify.  You can look at me," John added.
"My brother."
That was apparently the wrong thing to say, as Sherlock rose out of the chair with a look of fury.  "You think it's funny, don't you!"
Then he made the mistake of telling Sherlock about it.
"I wouldn't mind a piece. Thank you, you're very kind." John could now smell the faint scent of the chocolate bar. "You said you had an insect book the last time we talked. Can you show it to me?"
"What was her mood like?" asked Lou.
He opened his eyes.  The ceiling was definitely one of a shabby hotel room.  He looked to the left and saw an electrical outlet with three small holes in a row.  So he was in Germany, then.  He looked to the right and saw a large man with salt and pepper hair sleeping facing the other wall.  There was nothing else to easily see and so Sherlock got out of the bed.  It was then he realized something had happened that was more severe than just being moved.  He was four or five inches shorter than he usually was.  Time to make his way to a mirror, then.
"Two months later she died of a stroke," Sherlock said in his usual way of not quite answering the question. "I should have known better." He took the file and got up to leave the room.
Once John had called out that dinner was on the table, Sherlock knew that he couldn't remain hiding in his room. He made himself come out, although the last thing he wanted to do was eat. Eating was such a horrible activity. You were assaulted by all sorts of smells and tastes and textures, and people expected you to enjoy it. His mother had seemed to think it was a royal insult against her when he couldn't make himself eat whatever the cook had made. "Eat what's on your plate!" she'd cry out. "I never had this trouble with your brother!" He'd end up eating as little as he could, trying not to gag the whole time.
"He's one of the children who was treated at the homeless clinic she worked at.  Once he found out she'd been arrested he disclosed to his parents.  He's got curly brown hair and different-colored eyes - one's brown and one's blue."  He tapped his fingers on the table unconsciously.
"Where was it?"
The woman shook her head.  "Arthur, while I'm sure you find them edible, I'm not sure that it's the best idea to poison the pilot who will fly us back to Fitton." These were indeed his co-workers.  Sherlock made a noncommittal noise.  He would have to tell them eventually if they didn't notice themselves; he was completely incapable of flying a plane to Fitton, wherever that was.
"I wouldn't be surprised.  If Edwin was still here I'd send him the clippings.  He'd want to know there was some justice in the world.  Oh, look at how I go on.  You're going to want to get there early, like the other days, right?"
John wasn’t a coward, but he had seen a fairly small coin with a fairly large bullet hole in it and a fairly smug blond on the other end of the gun.
So when the train began to slow to a stop, John jumped up from his seat and shoved his arms into his coat. He’d had to take it off twenty minutes into the trip because gripping the armrests so tightly was making him sweat. Sherlock watched dutifully, his features carefully arranged in a mask of disinterest.
What had come next was the hard part. Waking up in an abandoned building in the middle of eastern Europe, joints stiff from the cold, without the smell of tea enveloping him or the domestic sounds of john putting around the flat. Chasing a criminal through a back alley without the warmth and reassurance of John’s presence beside him. Looking to his left after making a clever deduction that would’ve astounded any normal person and finding only empty space.
“How-?” John decided it wasn’t worth it to ask. Sherlock would explain before he could even get the question out. Lestrade just glowered.
“Oh, only the assertion that any of you will be fit enough to travel when your already feeble minds have withered to the size of a peanut.”
“Don’t be silly,” Sherlock said, an ornery smile twisting the corner of his lip. “You already are.”
John tried to look away, he really did but it was right there. And John was too busy-fighting back the inexplicably intense urge to lean forward and just bite it-to look away.
He could hear the hostility behind her encouragement and didn’t bother staying at the table any longer. He should’ve insisted on saying no, on staying with Mary and working through the weirdness between them, on staying with Mary and finishing the business she started the night before. But they both knew the truth. He couldn’t have said no if he wanted to.
It was ridiculous. John had lived with the man for almost two years. That hadn’t been the first time John had occupied a small space with his friend. There had been plenty stake-outs, arguments in the narrow staircase, disagreements over the very limited bathroom space. It wasn’t the first time they had ever been so close. Sherlock wasn’t exactly a fan of personal space, not when invading it could be used to manipulate someone. Was he manipulating John? He felt manipulated. Well, he felt something…
He wasn’t sure where he was headed when he closed the front door behind him, but he knew the winter air was so much better than the stifling sitting room. John made a hasty exit after Mary stormed into the bedroom. He wasn’t sure if it was a dismissal or an invitation despite the horrible reception her advance had gotten. He wasn’t willing to find out either way.
With a gun in his hand pointed at a bomb, on the edge of bart’s, on his knees begging for forgiveness from to be the last thing he heard before they both blew up. The barest hints of the ruin John had seen in Sherlock’s eyes as John leaned forward in his dream. None compared to the image John conjured up of Sherlock knowing he was going to have to go on living in a world where John doesn't exist.
He wouldn’t risk a kiss. It might break the spell. But the fierce need to feel the soft skin of Sherlock’s lips would overwhelm him and he would feel them with his fingertips.
“I love you.” He said again, more forcefully, like if he said it hard enough it will be enough. Panting, he covers his face with his hands, pushing in hard to try to keep them from shaking. All he could see was swirling blue and grey and green.
His hips jerked and a groan was ripped from his chest. John rested his forehead against the back of her shoulder and breathed heavily, hips still slamming against hers.
“We?” Lestrade managed to choke out what everyone else was thinking. Poor Molly looked hopeful for the briefest of moments. Eyes were torn between Sherlock who was trying much too hard to appear casual and John, who was stuck in his chair eyes blank like he was seeing something far off.
.” The last statement was directed at Sherlock who was shaking his head before the other man finished speaking.
It was damp, marshy ground, and the ground was covered in foot prints, both on the path and in the short grass on either side. Sometimes he would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made a little detour into the meadow. Then he followed a pathway through the woods until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.
The word wrung in his mind as he lay in the dark. It was so rare to hear Sherlock beg, and even more rare for it to be so genuine. John couldn’t recall what memory that broken sound came from but it was so clearly Sherlock’s voice. John had never heard him sound so shattered. Or seen him so distraught.
“John.” The note was simple. Hushed. Questioning in that bone-rattling deep voice. Pleading. Full of so much want.
“You were watching me gathering data rather closely.”
They met three officers from the local station who would show them around the crime scene. Sherlock blew right by them to inspect the front yard, vaguely aware that John had stayed behind to apologize and shake hands.
He expected John to question his intent but he was silent, watching Sherlock examined the shoes the maid returned with, a small unconscious smile.
“The London press is useless. I looked through all the recent papers this morning for the particulars but they are so full of conjecture I can hardly use any of it as a reliable source. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult.” Sherlock said. Lestrade snorted, shaking his head, but he didn’t look up from his files, “It’s already solved. Not so difficult after all.”
John giggled harder and got a well deserved jab to the ribs. His laughter didn’t die away completely, just became silent, and his chest shook. Her glare made his smile return. “What? He was only saying what everyone else was thinking. I told you he does that.”
Yes, I 100% did add the characters from Oscar Wilde's plays and stories into the fic as cameo celebrities. Why? Because I am lazy and didn't want to research British Celebrities. But also because I've always wanted to write a Dorian Gray into Sherlock's world crossover fic and this was my chance to make him appear and run around being the slutty little asshole he is.

And that makes Sherlock roll his eyes fondly. He reaches a long arm over the back of the sofa, where Sherlock's phone is sitting precariously, and scrolls swiftly through his messages. He pulls up the last one he got from Irene and shows it to John.
John has enough of this video, the fake smiles and cheerful tone of voice coming off as eerie and impersonal to him. He clicks on another link. This one is of the hostess talking and John almost clicks a different link until the woman announces,
“Ah, my dear Doctor Watson...” William greeted John at the pub twenty five minutes later. “So sorry I'm late. I was a bit far from this area. But, now I'm arrived let me ask you, because I'm incredibly curious, why, after so very,
John laughed a little as the man beneath him began to struggle, “Sherlock, you mad bastard, I don't even want to know why you have those.”
?!” He grumbled, checking the clock. “Fuck it.” John tossed back the covers and got back up, turning all the lights on. He paced the living room for a second. Looked down, saw a newspaper, picked it up and pretended to read it.
! Imagine... imagine...! A shiver runs through Sherlock’s spine and he groans as he thinks of what more would feel like. Sex with John Watson, that must be paradise, and Sherlock is overcome with the need to have that,
.” John returned, playing along.
John gives Sherlock one of his signature lop-sided smiles and rolls his eyes at him. Sherlock is such a fucking dork. He nods in agreement and allows Sherlock to pull him into the throng of dancing people with him.
“That's
There was no way in hell he was telling her
“Ah, yes, of course.” Sherlock answers as his partner begins to move behind him again, a sly grin on his face. Sherlock glances at him over his shoulder, slightly annoyed, but not all together displeased. His partner continues as Sherlock hears John continue, completely oblivious to Sherlock’s situation without the ability to see him – “Yeah. Anyway, listen, I was wondering – Ouch! – Hold on,” Sherlock hears John rustling about and tries to concentrate on listening for his return while suppressing a groan at his partner’s deliberate movements behind him. “Rosie,” Sherlock hears John say, “sweetie, don’t pull daddy’s hair.” Sherlock shudders at the combined pleasure of hearing John’s voice, even if it isn’t speaking to him directly, while Sherlock is currently being fucked from behind. “Thank you, darling,” John says to Rosie on his end, then his voice returns, much clearer this time, “Sorry. She’s a little cranky. We’ve had a bit of a rough morning.”
Sherlock hesitated looking down at the sidewalk then brought his eyes back up to John, “You wouldn't answer any of my calls,” he whispered, loud enough for John to hear him.
Again, I feel like the title sort of says it all.
“Ah... noooo. I work Saturday nights, remember? Here,” He tossed a box of chocolates into her hands, “from the bride and groom.”
“But you wrote it.” John said, quietly, “You wrote it and you gave your brother the story anyway. Be a man, and admit it... or don't, but please, please don't pretend that you give a
Mary dismissed Archie as she walked up to Harriet, greeting her shyly, “Hi.”
He heard Mary and Harry saying their thank you's to Mrs. Watson and sighed as he sat against the door, forcing himself not to shed a tear. He stayed there a moment longer, taking his phone out of his pocket to send a text message, (meet me @ Brook-Rich Pub in 20 mins) if only to distract himself from the agony he was feeling. It was like being shot all over again. The pain in his leg was almost as great as the pain in his heart. When he finally felt put together he exited the bathroom and made his excuses to leave.
Sherlock glares daggers at him and with a raised brow he says in a calmly dangerous voice, “Oh,
“What are you doing here?” John asked, confused.
John was speechless. “I'm... so sorry I just... I should have called but I... You forgot your purse.”
________________________________________________
Sherlock raises a brow, “Problem, Doctor?”
“Bye-bye I-ree,” Rosie waves.
The angst begins.
“... Yes, definitely on the dancefloor by now…” Sherlock is saying, apparently having deduced Jack’s location.
“Da! Down!” She fusses.
“I-” John stammered, “I've a lot of mates, alright, and I like to keep them.”
was I supposed to know that if you never told me?” He growls.
“Mary!” Someone shouted from the bar.
Sherlock pets John’s hair and stares up at the ceiling, willing himself not to allow any sort of tears. “It was...” he begins, then swallows, clearing his throat lightly, “It happened while I was away,” he reveals. “Mor-“ and he clears his throat again at the mention of the name of one of the people he most fears, “sorry, Moriarty’s network was... vast and - unpleasant. It wasn’t - look, I’m fine, now., so just don’t-”
Henry sighs. He looks upset as he stands there, wordless for once, balancing his wine glass on the small space between their arms on the balcony. Molly takes the glass and sets it aside on a high table behind her and reaches up to brush a strand of hair out of his face. Henry leans into the touch and she retracts her hand before he can try anything. “I don’t know,” Henry finally admits, “Dorian once asked me if I’d thought he’d been murdered, but I would prefer not to believe such a fate could befall our odd friend.” He turns his face away from Molly, his hair sweeping over his face as he looks down at the people below them. When he finally turns back to Molly he has his usual smile plastered back on his face, but there’s a falseness to it now that Molly hadn’t seen in it before, “Basil was rather dull, you see, and he had a wonderful genius for painting, but he wasn’t ever clever enough to have enemies. If he’d have been murdered it would have at least been some kind of romantic end for him. I much prefer to believe that he fell off an omnibus somewhere and that the conductor hushed up the scandal. It’s a fitting fate for someone of Basil’s character. Or maybe he’s alive somewhere in Paris unhappily married to some comely puritan woman hiding somewhere in the country,” he shrugs, “In any case, I try not to think about him. Dwelling on the past is so… tiresome.”
“Of course, John.” Sherlock replies with a nod, and stepping out of the bedroom, speaks directly to Rosie, “Come on, darling, let’s leave daddy to clean up that mess you made all by himself,” the last bit clearly meant as a tease towards John.
“I'm sorry, could you just give us a tic, Harry?” John requested, “I'm going to bring him over here, for just a second, talk to him – talk about you.” He took Sherlock by the arm and lead him away as Harry nodded her assent.
John pants breathlessly and his eyes cloud over at the thought. “Oh, god, yes.” He replies and begins to remove his shirt.
Testing him John stated: “I refuse to believe you helped people fold serviettes before you met me.”
“–and how do you afford these weddings on your pay and army pension?” Sherlock continued, “The tuxedoes, the air fare, the wine of the month clubs?”
... that I love them the same way I love
William smiled at John as he spoke.
“Oh! This is so tiny and cute,” Harry commented with her trademark grin, “I love it!”
Sherlock, as if sensing that someone is thinking about him, shifts in his sleep and snakes an arm around John’s chest. He somehow pulls himself closer, his head now partially on John’s chest. John shifts a little at the movement, until he can move the previously crushed arm to stretch his tingling fingers.
“My, my Doctor Watson, that's a bit forward isn't it?” Sherlock laughed.
Sherlock made a little moue of discontent at John's implication, “Yes we are and I'm
John clamoured to open his door, “Yeah?” He asked, peeking round the door out at her.
, and that was... it was wrong. How John felt had really nothing to do with it... Because this was about Harry and Harry
“Shut-up, Mycroft.”
it. Ah well, it’s not like there will ever be anyone more interesting than Sherlock out there anyway. God and he’s such a sultry creature, lying there biting his lip, waiting for John to respond to him. “Fuck yes.” John breathes, “but I need you to naked first,” he instructs, slipping back to allow Sherlock to strip. They remove their clothes in record time and collide into each other as soon as they’re both completely unburdened by fabric. They kneel on the bed, pressed chest to chest against each other, running their hands over the other’s naked and heated flesh until John pauses. His hands have run over Sherlock’s naked back and he feels something... strange.
After walking in silence with nothing but the raging storm around them for about an hour and a half they arrived at a little pub on the edge of the small village soaked to the bone. John found the phone on a wall to the left. He found immediately that it wasn't working. He turned to Sherlock with an expression that clearly read, 'Nope, we're fucked.;
“Sure, Harry, whatever you say,” John followed.
“Dance. You're my partner, you look far too conspicuous just sitting there nursing that beer and watching the exit like a hawk, our killer is highly suspicious of you, now come dance.”
Irene taps on John’s name now and brings up his texts. She frowns a little when she sees that it was Sherlock who had texted first. “Have some self-respect,” she mutters to herself as she reads on. By the time she gets to the end, however, she’s feeling a little smug. Sherlock hadn’t once seemed to be blushing this morning, which means that he had handled that innuendo with a very good poker face. She’s so proud of him.
“Oh, Harry cooks?” Sherlock looked surprised to hear it.
Sherlock’s rumbling laugh jostles him a bit as the detective responds, “in your defence, we’ve both been rather stupid. I can’t believe I didn’t realize-“
“Actually, Dimock, I... I think I'm too close to the case. I knew the girl while she was here. Not well, mind you but... it's... it's too sad to see her like that. I don't think I'd be impartial, and now... with Deb implicated.”
_________________________________
“Can you go away, please, I did not invite you.” John requested as Sherlock pointed a registry scanner at an expensive ugly-looking ceramic penguin with metal accents, pulling the little trigger making it beep and successfully registering Harry to receive that as a gift at her wedding.
“Same to you,
“Well, there you have it, you got us all to cry for you Sherlock. Well done. Now go on up and go tell Claudia all about it,” Tess encourages and Sherlock and Irene disappear up some stairs to go talk to another hostess.
Dorian bites his lip and sits back against the settee with Sherlock, “Yes,” he demures, “I hope you don’t mind. It’s just... I’m quite a fan of your work and… well, aside from Strictly dance practices and the two times you came out dancing with us, I’ve not gotten to know you like the others. You could say I’m quite curious about what you do. I mean, everyone else is either a musician, like myself, an actor like Algy or a dancer like Ceci and Jack. You’re different. A mystery, I suppose,” the boy shrugs, “But, also… well what I have gotten to see of you – it’s – I hope you don’t find me too bold in saying… I, well... I quite like you, Mr. Holmes.”
Mary took a long swig of her drink. Harry stared determinedly at the slide show.
John loses any sort of control he has and hears a voice in his head (that sounds a little like Harriet’s if he’s honest), saying, ‘
“Should you, er... really be drinking this much on the job, mate?” The bartender asked
“If you don't start giving me feature stories I swear to you, Mycroft I will quit and go back to illegally chasing murderers in London while doing astounding amounts of cocaine. I hear there are some interesting serial suicides going on right about now, by the way, how's Anderson handling those stories, hmm?”
John shrugs half-heartedly and responds while smiling at the screen and unconsciously leaning forward, “Guess so… wow, look at him go,” Sherlock and Irene perform a particularly difficult looking maneuver in which she slides across a bar to slide into Sherlock’s arms. He catches her, lifts her in a spin and then spins her to curl her back into him. John, without realizing he’s doing it gasps out an “Oh yes, nice one!”
Mary stood from her seat instantly, “That's great. Really, great, Harriet.” She walked away without another word.
Doctor Watson.”
“Shaaaadap” John answered.
“Yes. The best.” Rosie answers, becoming distracted with a loose string on the lapel of John’s robe.
My hand slipped and my evil cliff-hanger is not very effective because I finished this chapter earlier than I thought I would.
“I've been to three.” John stated, grinning as he remembered the Ricoletti wedding, everyone clamouring around in their costumes trying to get sorted in front of the camera while dressed as characters from the animated movie, 'Howl's moving Castle'.
in the nice way and then I'm going to have a few drinks and th–”
, I never reply!” Sherlock argues testily.
Anthea sighed again, and got up from her position leaning against the cubicle desk, “Molly, Greg, John... follow me. This is private Holmes business.”
“‘Too much sentimental twaddle.’ I believe were his exact words.” Sherlock smiles and speaks quietly, “I think Eurus would have hated it too, but back when we sat together with mummi to watch it she was much too young to understand it, or perhaps just too young to feel she could protest.”
John and Rosie visit a sulking Sherlock and John finally says he’s sorry.
Thanks for reading and sharing and, and, and...!!! – for all the LOVE and kudos and COMMENTS (I live for them omg) and support and encouragement and for putting up with my awful grammar and lack of spell checking and run-on sentences. enjoy the chapter. I love you all! Xoxoxo!!
Sherlock gives Lestrade a confused look, “John is one hundred and sixty nine centimeters,”
“Sounds perfect.” John beams.
“Okay, well I don't need to be taken care of, thank you.” John said flatly and began walking away.
“So I just imagined you telling me that you
“Yes! J–” Sherlock breathes, “–just like that. Fuck.”
, Now my baby's dancing, But she's dancing with another man,” the voice wails as the couple in white twists and twirls around the stage. John frowns minutely as he watches them dance. He recognizes right away that this isn’t Sherlock and Irene dancing and looks on at their waltz impassively. He isn’t really interested in seeing them, and their steps don’t seem to match up with the song. He leaves the telly on but switches his attention back to his phone, deciding to have a look through more of Sherlock and Irene’s interviews, trying to see if there is any indication of a reason she might be here or a clue with as to why she’s pretending to be a famous Russian dancer. Instead he finds himself staring at Sherlock’s red-rimmed eyes on the tiny screen while the deep baritone narrates to the camera.
Ps. I edited the title. If anyone recognizes my weeb reference... I’m sorry.
“This one for Molly,” she explains, picking up another crayon, “She’s dancing too.”
An older woman walked up in front of him, blocking his way and startling him on his path (cousin Joseph's mother, it seemed) saying “John! You look so handsome! Good for you! Oh, darling it must be so hard seeing your younger sister get married before you!”
Molly watches the people dancing from above while she’s stood at the balcony by Henry’s side as he waxes poetic about some philosophical point on morality and the beauty of youth. He’s quite charming, really, for someone so narcissistic, but then Molly certainly does have a type. Sherlock has complained (for the past few weeks that Molly has been working with him and Irene to unravel her case) that he has never met more people that love to hear themselves natter on about nothing. Molly finds this quite amusing, as Sherlock himself is sometimes prone to talking like he’s stepped out of some Victorian novel. She smiles sweetly as Henry speaks, waiting until he’s done talking.
Sherlock didn't seem to hear John, or notice his irritation as he continued on his spiel, “Of course you can't tell him because you're
“Yes well, that still leaves the question with as to who the straight bloke you’re pining after is.” John finally remarks.
“Not enough data. We will need to talk to Carter for more.” Sherlock responded.
“I’ve missed you,” he’d said.
John hands Sherlock the keys to his car after Sherlock locks up. It had been Mary’s and John had almost stopped using it, but sometimes, with a baby, it was just easier to keep it. Sherlock looks at him questioningly for a second until he remembers Rosie. Right.
John grins at her, “It’s no worries. Looks entertaining.” Then, because he’s not quite sure what else to say he asks, “So who’s winning?”
“If you’re wondering if he always talks like that, the answer is yes,” someone says behind John.
John picks her up. “Yes, we are at Sherlock’s. He’s sleeping right now though. So shhhhh!” He explains, pressing his fingers to his lips.
“Oof. Ouch.” Mary said, with a fond smile, “That hurts, John.”
But John holds Sherlock back, waiting until his eyes are clear, “Sherlock,” John says again, to get his attention, then asks, as he runs a hand over what feels like some slightly raised flesh similar to some other points he’d felt further in, “What’s this on your back?”
“Sure?” Marry asked.
Irene laughs, “Oh, my sweet Sherlock. It’s like he’s made of honey isn’t it?” She holds onto his arm while Sherlock raises a brow, though his smile is still there.
“Why didn't you tell me?”
as i said, I don't know what the original plan was for this but I have some notes i made after re-reading it about what it can become (yes I said that on purpose ;P) and hopefully I can pull it off. I dunno. We'll see. As I said in my notes for In Pursuit, though, I am starting school soon and life has definitely been a bitch to me recently so I'll see just how much of these tow stories i can manage to type up for you guys properly with like, grammar and descriptions and plots and shit. Hopefully. I dunno I'm an artist, not a writer, scottie.
John attends two weddings at once while catching the attention of a very handsome, but very cynical man attending one of the parties.
Mary smiled and patted his arm, then she got up and boldly took Harry's hand as they began walking away. Harry turned back towards John and mouthed “Thank you!”
“Oh, god yes I know, I mean, even being a vegetarian is a challenge. Every time I do volunteer work I have to struggle to cook myself something meatless before I leave for the day.”
“I thought Greg was the Best Man?” Molly asked.
John looked up from the mail to stare at Sherlock, “Yes, well the rehearsal dinner's not for another month and a half, so calm down.”
Sherlock’s expression is polite when he utters a soft and cordial, “Thank you very much, Angelo.”
Josh grins charmingly, “It’s really fine, Doctor Watson. I’m sure he won’t mind if I tell you, and I don’t mind easing your mind,” and he looks very sincere as he unfolds the piece of paper. On it is written a phone number, but it isn’t Sherlock’s. Above the number is simply a letter – the letter ‘J’. “It’s the phone number of another acquaintance of Sherlock’s,” Josh explains, “He said,” and here he blushes, “– he said he thinks I should call him, and that… and that I would find him to be, and I quote, ‘if not a bit overly sentimental at least a very good lay.’ Oh but –” Josh seems to kick himself mentally, “I probably shouldn’t have told you that last bit.” He laughs nervously, rambling now, “To be fair he also said that this guy and I could be very good together.”
“Yes, I think it goes nicely with the rest of table arrangement.” Sherlock answered, staring at the little opera houses thoughtfully.
John huffs out an amused breath, “It’s really fine,” he comments, “I’m glad you told me. Thank you.”
“Do I have a problem with my b- er - lover adoring my daughter? No.” John bungles the sentence a little almost referring to Sherlock as his ‘boyfriend’. ‘
“I made them do it.”
Dorian had nodded, though he’d given a wistful look in Sherlock’s direction before he’d smiled and excused himself to go sit with Cecily, Jack, and Algy.
"But not now."  He was accusatory.
John took her advice, sort of, and walked up to the front step where the two of them were standing.  "We're not here to see the flat," Sherlock said with authority.  "Are you the landlady?  I'd like to ask you some questions about your tenants."
"Once a week.  It was a bit out of my way but I didn't want to miss a second with her."  Mr. Ogbeide looked away as he spoke; the memory was clearly still painful.  "I'd go to the contact center and we'd visit there."
Guessing that in a roundabout way Sherlock was asking about Phillip, John replied: "Yeah.  She was good on the stand; I'm not sure the defense knew what to do with her."
"Was that all you did?"
Sherlock finally stopped in front of a long walkway leading to a large sprawling house.  The grounds looked well tended, the driveway and the walkway were both in good condition, and the house looked cheerful.  It seemed to be the last place you'd look for a criminal like K.  He looked briefly at the paper in his hands before heading down to the house.  John, after sending one last text that named the street and house number, headed there himself.  Just before he got to the door, Sherlock spun around and stared back at John.  "How long have you been following me?" he asked.
"What for?"
Once again John was impressed with the way Sherlock was handling this.  Normally he'd demand the person get to the point, but now he understood Phillip needed time.  "You can tell me," he said, putting his hand back on his shoulder.
John felt lost for words, so he acted on instinct.  He wrapped his arms around Sherlock and pulled him in for a hug.  At first Sherlock was as stiff as a board, but when John didn’t let go, he began to relax by increment.  Once he had relaxed some, John got another look at his face and realized Sherlock was silently crying.  That he never had expected to see.  He didn’t say anything about it, but pulled him up on to the sofa so Sherlock’s head rested against his shoulder.
"If he really was the one abusing her, why did he bring her here?  You stated yourself it was because of something obscene she said, not because he saw any physical injury."  John wanted to cheer Sherlock on but did not.  Still, he couldn't deny there was a certain pleasure in seeing him savage Dr. Arthur's logic.
"She said we were going to play a game.  She told me to take my clothes off.  Then She started to tickle me."
"Yes, I am, but that doesn't mean I want to go out if you don't."
"And that was that?"
"I hope it goes well," John said.
"He'd been nice to me.  I needed to tell someone about it."
"'Are you sure?  Let me check.'"  That admission seemed to be too much for Moira; she brought Brownie to her face and started to cry.  Several of the people watching had the same problem.  John could hear sobs from several different directions.
"Yes," said Mari, looking sour.
Martin assumed they'd take the bus and was a bit surprised to be bundled in a cab.  He avoided looking at John throughout the short trip, staring out the window instead pretending the city was fascinating to him.  When they arrived at a hospital, John took his hand and led him through several doors before stopping at one that said PATHOLOGY in red letters.  "Don't worry, it's just that the doctor I know works here."  If John was trying to reassure him, it didn't do a very good job, as now all he could think of was the potential worry that might be in there, and he very reluctantly went through the swinging doors.
"It's right here in the book case." There were footsteps. "Here it is. Those are all my scientist books, right next to them."
"There was no evidence of that in the first place.  And no criminal complaint to go on, for that matter.  You can't prosecute someone with only what he said."  Sherlock glared back at her.  He seemed much more like himself then he had been at any point in the last six months, almost like none of it had happened.  Even Hamish had been pushed to one side.  "Even if someone is making that claim now it's interesting they waited that long to say so."
"Yes.  I play for an orchestra.  The oboe and the bassoon."  Mr. Rodgers looked down at the toy in his son's arms.  "You loved to come to work with me and on Sunday I would take you backstage."
"Did your arm get broken by someone else?"
As Phillip was lead out by the usher, Susan came up to the stand.  "The prosecution calls Dr. Sarah Sawyer."  A few seconds later a different usher escorted Sarah to the stand.  She was the first witness so far in the trial that didn't look anxious.  She even managed to smile at Susan.
"If Molly couldn't find anything wrong there isn't anything we can do, is there?"
"And did you do that?"
"I'd rather get up at five in the morning than make my way through the crowd that's going to be here," the man said.  He was tall and round in a way that made John think of Tweedledee.  "Let's go in."  He then turned to look at John.  "Who's this?" he asked.  "I thought I'd already met with all the witnesses.  And you told me Victim Three had black hair."
K opened her mouth and looked like she was about to reply when there was a sound of wheels on gravel.  John turned to see a police car in the driveway.  He walked towards it before any officer had even gotten out, dragging Sherlock with him.  “Did Lestrade from Scotland Yard ring you?” he said to the women who had just gotten out of the car.
"Needle in a haystack."  John knew even Sherlock couldn't work that many different possibilities.
"Yes," Mr. Aherne responded, seemingly relieved to have the subject changed.  "There's a crèche in the courthouse, right?"
"Perhaps you're right."  Sherlock looked back at him.
“No you didn’t,” John said, without addressing any of the other issues in the remark.
"Think I'm going to rob the place and run, then?" Sherlock knew perfectly well he just didn't want a stranger in his home alone, no matter what body that stranger was in, but he threw in the barb anyway.
"Maybe."
“I’ll give you the address and I’ll meet you in front of the building.”  She gave him an address a few miles away, said, “I’ll see you then,” and hung up.
"Tell me about that."
"Yeah," Phillip admitted in a low voice.
"No.  They already had stuff to worry about and I didn't know if they could find another place for me to be seen.  And I thought if my legs really looked bad I did need to see someone, and if it meant She'd leave my brothers and sisters alone I'd put up with it."
"Not like that."  John came back into the room, a woman with long brown hair at his side.  "Sherlock's... not here."
"Your family isn't native to England, are they?"
"Thanks for breakfast," John told them as he left the room and walked down the hall to the other door.  He opened it slowly and saw that a row had already been filled with people.  The way they chatted amongst themselves indicated they all knew each other. This apparently was what the buffalo looked like.  None of them looked at him as he settled himself into one of the middle benches, next to the aisle.  They didn't seem to notice he was there at all until he coughed very audibly.  Only then did they look back at him, then began talking among themselves again.  He heard one say, "Who is he?" but the others were smart enough to not speak loudly.
"And the dog sleeps in her room?"
Donovan put a hand on his shoulder. "The sooner we find out the name of the person who hurt your daughter, the sooner this will be over. I know I explained to you that whoever this man is he's been targeting children in that area for a long time. We just realized that the victims were connected, and if all this goes well your daughter will be the last one."
"Flashbacks?" said Mari.
, he thought with another pang of sadness.  Arthur would be the one person who wouldn't bat an eyelash at all this, but did this Sherlock Holmes think he was endearing or annoying?  Douglas and Carolyn would do what they could to protect him, of course, but that didn't mean whoever was in his body couldn't get in a few digs.
"No."
"So you're the primary caretaker for your children?"
“If you’re going to be in a relationship with me you’ll want sex!  You enjoy it!  If I don’t give it to you you will leave!”
"Cocoa."
"Then let's go."
"What was K actually charged with?"
John took a sudden deep breath.  "He was... his mother..."  He couldn't make himself finish the thought.
"Once you're out of hospital I can come see you at home. I want to meet your Rory." He smiled warmly at her.
Right after Lestrade spoke there was a knock on the door.  He stood to open it.  Five young adults stood there, four clearly related; they all had the same dark blond hair, light brown eyes, and lean build.  The fifth was a woman holding an infant.  "Sorry, we couldn't find a sitter in time," she said in apology as they all stepped into the room.  Her dark hair, almond-colored skin, and high, flat cheekbones were in sharp contrast to the other four.  "I can wait out in the hall if you like.  I'm Gloria Yellowfox, Graham's fiancee."  Even her accent was different, distinctly American.
"Don't be smart with me. You're lucky I don't make you live in the shed with the geese." Douglas turned on his heel and headed into the house without a word.
"Race you," Kieran said to Moira, and they both took off down the pavement.
"Do that."
Sherlock didn't wake up until five in the evening.  As he sat upright one of his sleeves came down and John could see a few obvious track marks.  "You inject?" John asked in surprise.
"And this Dana Lester is the only tenant you've never seen in all that time?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"What did she say to do?"
Yes, John, he did. He knows just how Moira feels and thinks it would help put her at ease. He's right.
K. Even now he couldn't make himself call her anything else. Sherlock, on the few occasions he had mentioned her, simply said She or Her with very obvious capital letters. When he'd been called in to talk to a child patient who the Yard suspected had been sexually abused, way back in February, John had had no idea what he was going to unleash. He just wanted to help the Yard, and no one, not even their entire team of experts, had gotten the girl to even admit to being abused, much less who did it. He had no better luck then they did.
"Were you intentionally touching her breasts?"
John had heard people talk before about silence falling over a room, but until that point he'd never actually seen it happen.  As soon as Sherlock apparently realized what he had said, he took two steps back, his eyes widening as he did so.  He was probably attempting to flee somewhere, but as he turned for the stairs he tripped on the lowest step and fell like a bundle of sticks.  Instead of getting up, he curled into a remarkably compact ball.  For a minute John stood there in stunned silence.  Whatever else he said, Sherlock valued his company and liked having him around.  And despite any sort of bravado he might put on, he was clearly frightened of K.  It wasn't a barb designed to keep John away, either.  Sherlock's response to hearing himself say it was not a calculated one.  Then he remembered Molly saying a long time ago Sherlock seemed to want something he couldn't have, and the gears clicked.  He crouched down next to Sherlock.  John knew better than to touch him, and he couldn't catch his eye when he was curled up like that, so he threw caution to the wind and just said it.  "You loved her.  And you didn't love anyone else after that.  Until you met me.  And you love me."  He knew "in love with me" was probably a better description, but right now was a time to carefully choose his words.  "But you're afraid because you don't want to have sex with me, and it scares you.  And no matter how bad it was with her, you know what it's like already, and that's better than any unknown."  John wasn't really surprised by his feelings at all.  Pretty much every single person who had met both him and Sherlock had noticed those feelings, and had all but hit him over the head with the fact Sherlock Holmes loved him.  If he had to pick a reason why Sherlock never acted on those feelings, though, he wouldn't have come up with this one.
Phillip slumped in his chair more before responding.  "A lot of times.  For the next few years She'd pick me up and take me to the flat a few times a week.  Sometimes we'd meet at the park and sometimes She'd get me from school.  Mum never picked me up there so I had to walk home.  Mum did ask Her once if I was annoying Her and She said I was behaving myself."
"A bumblebee? You had a stuffed bumblebee?" John wasn't sure why this seemed to be the strangest thing he'd heard today, but it was.
"How many other people are going to testify?"
"Not all at once," he said slowly.  "When I look back on it it's all a lot easier to see."
"What were the findings in her case?"
"You two almost ran into Mr. Holmes," scolded Mr. Aherne.  He lagged behind his older children, with Dierdre trotting along next to him.
"He's not reasoning.  It's impossible to reason someone out of something you didn't reason yourself into.  Also, if he makes himself accept that this wasn't a relationship in any real way, he has to accept he wasn't loved.  Would you want to realize something like that?"
"What was it?" she asked when Sherlock didn't elaborate.
"That laptop isn't mine, but go ahead and use it."
That, of all things, was the bit that widened the man's eyes and made him step away. He looked over Martin in the strange man's body one more time and said "My god. You're telling the truth."
"Someone is going to come here to make sure you don't do anything horrible to the place while I'm gone."  Sherlock could hear a waver in the man's voice and realized that the whole of what was going on had to have hit him by now.  He imagined John in the same situation and suddenly felt pity for the other man.  It was enough to make him bite back any sarcastic comments about a babysitter.
"For, um, who?"
"In bed the whole time?" asked Peter.
"And you're a widower?"
"Do you know how long she had worked there before you arrived?"
"You'll feel better if you do."  John fell silent.  He couldn’t think of anything to say that wasn't about the nightmare.
"It's his best friend.  He keeps mentioning how guilty he feels."
"Yes," said Peter. "That was the one."
While this is true, Sherlock said it to bring her mind away from what he just asked.
Dr.  Dodson's voice rang out.  "Her case is a lot different than the others of the people who come here."  He stepped into the office.  "There are other mental health issues."
Sherlock took off the uniform jacket he was wearing and handed it to Douglas without hesitation.  "That would probably be best for everyone involved."
"Can you point her out?"  Kieran pointed without hesitation to the dock where K sat.  "No further questions," Susan said as soon as he was done.
A few minutes later he heard the man say "No, Carolyn, he is not coming to work with me."  Pause.  "I don't want to leave him alone here."  A longer pause.  "That is possibly the worst idea you have ever come up with."  After almost a minute of silence, he spoke again.  "If you must.  But I am warning you if he does anything to upset him I really will make him live in the shed with the geese."
"Not what I meant."  He spoke so quietly John almost didn't hear him.
"No further questions," Clark said with a sigh.  He went back to sit with Harvey.  From the gestures and facial expressions John could see, it was obvious they were arguing about something.  Neither Lou nor Susan went up to the stand; they simply looked on with amusement until the argument ended.
"Yeah."
Clark paused to look at his watch.  "Did you ask him what he meant by being 'one in a hundred'?"
"At first it was just new things She wanted to do.  She started saying if I wanted to keep coming over I'd have to ask for what we were doing.  She really liked it when I said 'Please fuck me,' and sometimes She liked it if I added 'Mummy' to that.  She had things She wanted me to put in her.  Then one day after school She picked me up and said She had a surprise for me.  I had to keep my eyes shut even in the flat until we got to the bedroom.  When I opened my eyes I saw a little boy lying there."
"Not one based in the evidence. It seems he just couldn't imagine a nice old woman like that doing those things."
"On the mouth?"
"Not hungry," said Dominic.
"Possibly.  It's not like we ever see her anyway, but I guess he's thinking about his kid."
"And you went away to school at..."
"She let me sit on the table with the paper on it.  Then She sat down on it too and put me on Her lap."
"Yes, it is," John responded without hesitation.
"Correct."
"You're coming along well," reassured Eli.
"I'm going to leave in a minute."  He picked up his wallet and headed out the door, the clatter the keyboard made echoing behind him.
Lestrade had been writing while this exchange took place, and as soon as Mr. Aherne fell silent he looked up again. "Let's get back on the subject. What did you do after that?"
"Were you at work on January the third?"
Once the family had vanished down the hall, Lestrade looked John in the eye before he spoke.  "John, I hope this won't be a problem, but I would like to speak to Sherlock alone.  Just for a few minutes.  You wouldn't mind waiting in the hall?"
John hadn't expected her to be so direct.  Anything he could think of to object to the ban vanished, and he only managed to say, "Really?"
“Did she say anything to you after that?”
"Yes, we do. The doors are locked when we're at home though."
Martin's stomach turned to ice. "I can't remember it off the top of my head. Fitton Airfield? 42 Adams Lane? Airport FTN?"
"Did they ever ask you about why you went to the hospital that day?"
"Is the kid getting help?" asked Eli.
His face lit up.  "Yeah.  He's going to be one soon.  He's almost walking!"  He seemed as proud as any parent.
She folded her hands on her lap.  "Well, my mother died shortly after I was born, so it's always been just my father and me.  He didn't have any living relatives, so we are - were - really alone in the world.  When I was younger we traveled all over Europe and Asia; we only settled here when I was twelve.  Even then, he would go on these business trips and leave me with friends."  After a pause where she seemed to collect her thoughts, she began again.  "Most of the time these were very short trips.  This one I remember because he told me it was going to be six months.  I had my GSCEs next year and I assumed he'd take me with him.  But he didn't.  He said something about how India wouldn't be very fun to me, even though we'd been there before.  Now that I think about it, he seemed nervous."
Martin finally forced himself to open his eyes. "I rang my boss. The number didn't exist. I rang her home and the person there didn't know who she was. I tried to look up the number in the directory and they said there's no such listing."
Sherlock looked like he was about to comment further, but at that moment his mobile rang.  "Lestrade?" he said as he brought the device to his ear.  "Oh, that's good.  When does he want to meet with us?  Next Friday?  I'm sure that can be arranged."  He hung up.  "Speaking of the man, he got in touch with Lestrade and said he was coming to the Yard next Friday and he's willing to speak with us."
"School isn't always enjoyable."  Sherlock sounded sympathetic.
“All night long?  Really?”  John wondered for a minute if his mother would have noticed him using the phone all night long, and then reminded himself most children his age had their own mobiles.
"He's prepared for almost anything," John said with a faint sense of horror.  If K was really so careful it was going to be hard to catch him.
A nod. "But she's in heaven now with God." Her voice had a tinge of sadness.
"And how was that?" Harvey asked in an exasperated tone.
"There's not much to go over. With any luck we can get through the direct and cross today and move on to our next witness. I think you should get a seat in the courtroom now," Susan told John.  "Near the front."
When they reached Lestrade's office John was surprised to see he was not alone. A familiar boy, one with shaggy black hair that fell into his eyes, was sitting in a chair opposite him. One hazel eye was half visible under the fringe. "John, Sherlock, as you may know this is Phillip Rodgers. He decided he'd rather not go to school today and I told him if he talked to Sherlock he wouldn't be taken in for playing truant." Lestrade sounded very matter-of-fact. "Mr. Aherne will be here soon to listen to the tape the two of you made, and I think it would help if you were there too, John."
The man sat down, on the other side of the woman.  "Is there a reason you're reminiscing about that flight?"
"Yes, we do.  I believe so," he clarified.
"But I thought it was a woman," Rodney suddenly said. Peter gestured to his fingers. Rodney blushed. "Sorry, that was a stupid question." After Dr. Dodson looks at him Rodney adds "Not anything big. Been pretty quiet actually. She's gone to work every day this week."
Around ten, just before John was going to head up to bed, his mobile rang.  "John Watson?  It's Gloria Yellowfox," said the woman on the other end.
"You're not going to lecture me about it?"
"Did you ring Lestrade?"
"Yes, me and my friend Sherlock.  He works for the Yard," John replied.
"Are you going to question any of the children treated there?"  Sherlock seemed all business.  Knowing how much anxiety even mentioning K usually provoked in him, John wasn't sure whether to admire or shake his head about Sherlock's ability to shut off whatever he was feeling.
"By 'use Her fingers,' you mean for penetration, correct?"  Sherlock didn't seem bothered by what he said, but John couldn't help but shiver.
"She said I was a psychopath, but only about sex."  John expected Susan to ask another question, but instead Sherlock went on.  "I asked why She had to take the pictures and She said that if I got too bad She'd have to send them to my brother so he'd know what a problem I was."
John wondered silently.
"What he's trying to say is that She said he was a sexual psychopath."  Both John and Phillip turned towards Sherlock.  "And Phillip, you've already asked me these questions.  Was there a reason you wanted to ask John as well?"  Sherlock looked him in the eye.
"27 78."
"Because you haven't met him?"
"Do you tell him everything?"
"Yes," John said after a moment of silence, not believing he was admitting all this.
"I know that."
He heard the door open. "Sherlock?" an unfamiliar voice said. Seconds later, a strange man stepped into the bathroom. Martin remembered he was only wearing a towel, and he would have been a lot more embarrased if it had been his body. And had the man called him Sherlock? He didn't think that was a name anyone had besides the character.
"Once she was done with that she got on top of me.  Then it's sort of hazy."
"He..." John swallowed the lump in his throat.  "He's said he'd choose her over anyone else.  He'd live with her forever if he could.  That he wished he was still a child so she'd still want him around."  Until he actually said those words, he had no idea how much it had hurt to carry them around.  Being the only one who knew something like that cut to the bone.
"Yeah, and she took me by the arm.  Said I needed a place to lie down before I fell over.  She took me to a car and let me lie down in the back seat."
"But someone must have wanted to adopt her."  Harvey still sounded accusing.
”K brings it.  I give it to him.  He goes to sleep and then K comes in through the window.  Rory sleeps in my room and if I didn’t give him the meatball his throat would get slit.”  John could see Mr. Aherne look visibly shocked, but to his credit he didn’t say anything.
"For a few minutes.  The little girl laughed and said I made it feel nice too.  The whole time She took pictures."  His whole face had gone red.
Martin imagined Douglas making a comment about anyone who put "um" into three consecutive sentences had to be perfectly calm and almost laughed.  Instead he said "Just for a small airdo- line." He hoped he'd at least sort of looked like he had a poker face.  From the way she looked at him, it clearly wasn't working.
His face fell.  "I suppose that wouldn't be very nice for them."  He paused.  "And if Herc thinks it's mean to eat animals I don't think he'd like seeing some butterflies die on his -"
"Yeah.  Sometimes there were other kids there."
John took the cue and went to heat up dinner.  He made two plates and put one down next to Sherlock.  At first he didn't acknowledge it, concentrating on wrapping and boxing up Moira's present.  Only when he was done did he pick up the plate and sit down on the sofa.  They ate in silence and once John was certain that the news wasn't on any more, he turned on the telly.  Sherlock stayed at the other end, leaning on Hamish, pretending he wasn't interested in Top Gear.  John felt somewhat relieved that he didn't appear to be high, but still couldn't find anything to say.  Even when they went up to bed Sherlock merely nodded at him and gestured for him to come in to his bedroom.  But for the first time, even though he still used Hamish as a large shield between him and John, he rested his hand on John's shoulder.  Before he drifted off to sleep, John reminded himself that this was progress, of a sort.  Even with that he couldn't fool himself into thinking that it meant Sherlock was ready to deal with his issues.
"No, she didn't."
"Only if you do as well.  Kissing's not enjoyable for me unless the other person is enjoying it too."  The fact he had to mention this to Sherlock was really the worst part.
"You didn't do anything wrong," John hastened to reassure him. "People like K know how to manipulate a child. He'll be caught, just like Lestrade said. You are a man doing the best you can in a bad situation."
Sherlock sat there for a few seconds looking stunned.  He pulled Hamish back towards him.  "Yes."
Mr. Ogbeide nodded and said: "As far as I know, yes."
"There are a few good places right nearby. Chinese, Indian, fish and chips, sandwiches?" Truthfully, John rarely ate at most of the places in the area, since he usually picked up something on the way home if he hadn't bothered to bring something with him, but all of the places he was thinking of he had eaten at at least once and they were, if not gourmet, far better than cafeteria food.
"But your older daughter has a room by herself.  Don't tell me the other two share a room."
"Did you throw up earlier this morning?" John asked.
"Not all of it."
"If I told you that I had heard another story about how you broke your arm, what would you say?" Harvey asked.
"Are you engaged?" John asked.
While John would never deny that he'd fantasized about this moment, in his fantasies it was a little different than now.  One, in fantasy he was usually the one to start it, and second, in his fantasy Sherlock looked like he was enjoying himself.  He certainly didn't look like that now; his eyes were closed and he looked like he was enduring something unpleasant. Despite being shorter, John was still stronger than Sherlock and it was easy to push him an arm's length away.  "What do you think you're doing?" he said.
"The exact same woman?" Mrs. Hudson didn't seem particularly surprised.  "No wonder he's taking this so personally."
"You said 'the next few years.'  Did you stop seeing her after that?"
"Can we go down to the gift shop again Dad?" Dierdre asked, tossing her red ponytail behind her back.
"Yeah," Moira said softly. "I was sleeping and he woke us all up and said we had to go to the doctor now." She shivered. "Then they saw me and Kieran and Dierdre downstairs and they said I needed stitches and I got a shot and then they stitched them up. Then I came up here."
"I know this is very hard for you. But I need to ask you some more questions. When you said on the intake form you were sexually active, was that the case?"
"Did you know what she was talking about?"
Sherlock spent most of the trip back to wherever the man lived looking out the window. It wasn't normally something he did, but he'd never been in this place before, and he wanted to learn something about it. From what he saw it seemed to be a place based around the airport there; he didn't see anything else that looked like an industry.
"He's actually the child who started our investigation. His name is Phillip Rodgers and he's thirteen years old. Lives with his mother, who works all the time and doesn't appear too involved in his life. Father is out of the picture, whether he's dead or just left isn't known." Lestrade sipped at his tea. "This is very good, John, you have an eye for the nice tea brands. Anyway, he was brought into the clinic here with a broken arm and a black eye. He said he'd been in a fight, but was very reluctant to say anything more. He claimed he'd been wrestling with a friend and his arm got twisted then. There was a spiral fracture on the arm, but it looked a lot more serious than something you'd usually see in playful wrestling. The doctor who saw him – incidentally, that was your friend Sarah, John – was sure there was more to it and did a complete physical examination. There was bruising on the inner thighs, and she was quick enough to realize it was the sort of bruising you'd see in forced sex. He didn't admit to any sexual contact, however. She was smart about it though, and got to talking to him, just asking ordinary questions. When he was off guard enough, she asked if the person who'd broken his arm had hurt anyone else, and he said that he was one of a hundred here."
"What did he say?"
"Other than that, no. The examination had several other nonspecific indications of sexual abuse, but he wouldn't say who'd done it. He did admit his arm was broken because 'someone got angry' but no word about that person." Lestrade sighed. "The mother didn't appear too concerned. She was mostly worried that she'd have to stay home from work. We did manage to talk to a few of his teachers, and they say he's the somber type. No friends and doesn't do well in school. All of that makes him a prime target for a predator who promises he'll be his best friend."
"No.  She'd been taken into care by then."
"But you talked to Mr. Holmes, didn't you?"
"Do you recall what you were doing that day?"  Even Susan appeared to be more relaxed than on previous days.
"Not a problem," John said.  The siblings followed Gloria to the door and left.  "When are you coming tomorrow?" he asked Lou and Susan.
"That's quite a story," John said, not knowing what else to say.
"Did you ever protest to your mother you didn't want to go there?  Did you ever say anything to her about it?"
"Wait.  Didn't you say he walked in on something?  How old was he?" Tammie said.
"I did," Sherlock said after a moment or two.
John did not get drunk.  He read a few chapters of a book and went to bed.  He slept restlessly until early the next morning, when he crept downstairs only to be faced with Mrs. Hudson.  She held up the morning's paper.  K's picture was on the front, with the headline, "Is This A Bird of Prey?" in bold above it.
"Of course.  Hello John, I didn't get a chance to talk to you yesterday."  ,Lou sounded like they just hadn't seen each other.
“Does K come by on certain days of the week?”  He placed his hand next to her on the bed.
"The family contacted us.  Like Jennifer, he saw K on the news one night and told his parents that was the one who hurt him.  His English is quite good now, thankfully."  Lestrade had obviously noticed that Sherlock was still refusing to look him in the eye, and had kept his gaze on John or the paper in front of them.  The three of them silently scanned the document.  Victim Six was Christine Spencer, Victim Seven was Dominic Spencer, Victim Eight was Graham Spencer, Victim Nine Martin Spencer.
"If he dies will someone be allowed to adopt me?"
"But she did talk to the man Sherlock Holmes, right?"
"Goodbye."
"Not what She was charged with."
"What happened then?"
"Not at that point, no.  It's really a place for children to play so I didn't think about an adult going there."
"Who's her?"
Her brother interrupted her.  "Don't ruin the surprise for him.  Dad said you couldn't do that until after we talked to him."
John gets a figurative wake up call and a literal call.
"Phillip Rodgers."
"Did you confront Dr. Martin at all?"
"You seem concerned about who spends time with your children, but you've testified you let your nine year old daughter walk a dog by herself."
"Just so you know, if you wake up feeling that angry again you can tell me about it.  I don't mind being woken up and it seems like a better thing to do than shoot the wall or tear your bedsheets to shreds."  John tried to keep his voice light, so the suggestion could be seen as a joke no matter how serious it was.
"Wonderful to hear.  That sort of cat is called a polydactyl, which means 'extra toes.'  Two eyes of a different color are called heterochromia iridium." Sherlock said, smiling.
"About an hour later."
Then, it happened.  She locked eyes with John.  He felt too shocked to do anything, but she had no such problem; she smiled broadly at him.  It was only for a second and it would have been hard to prove she directed it at him, but John knew it was meant for him.  It meant, "I'm not going to be found guilty."  It meant, "I'm proud of what I did to your little friend."  It meant, "When I get off the charges I'm going to start doing it all over again."  John bit back the urge to start screaming to everyone in the court that you'd know she was guilty from that smile and the look in her eyes.
"For how long did you keep meeting her?"
This comment usually made Sherlock either say something or produce a long list of items, but now he just said, "No, nothing."  With that John headed out the door and grabbed a cab to the courthouse.
"Do you have any idea why his mother's so dead against you seeing him, especially because she let you see him at first?"
"He agreed to that?" John meant "Mycroft."  He had been so eager to see his brother's abuser punished that John thought if Sherlock had tried to get him to intervene in the Phillip matter he'd have demanded K be imprisoned without further trial.
"Nothing new. Still sober. I think I may be able to bring his friend in once. He's wearing down." Mari's husband's best friend had apparently seen him being abused when he was a teenager, and it ate at him tremendously.
"So Dr. Arthur assumed some foreigner had to be responsible, because he's a racist and sexist git," John added.  "Now I know why Sarah had so many horror stories about him."
“Did Jennifer ever talk to you about those things once you got her back?”  Sherlock also sounded flat.
“Alla.  She got it from someone who got it from someone else, and that might not have been the individual who wanted us to have it.”
"Are you going to the trial on Monday?"
"She's an adult and I'm a kid.  He wouldn't have liked it."
"How do you feel afterwards?"
"He got into a car but wasn't able to recreate the path they took because it was too complex."  Sherlock flipped the page.  "The building the flat is in faces west, because he said when he was taken out of the building he could see the sun set.  K - assuming this was K - dropped him off in a park nearby."  He turned to the third page.  "Oh!" he said in a sudden intake of breath.
"When did you hear that Jennifer's mother had been arrested for possession of drugs?"
"In the books he's living in the 1800's. Is he a detective?"
Sherlock slumped a little and moved the bee to his lap.  Seemingly unconsciously, he wrapped his arms around it and pulled it to his chest.  "All right," he said in a childlike whisper.
"She walked out of the store and I realized she still had my drink so I went after her.  I caught up with her on the pavement and she told me that she was sorry, she'd forgotten it wasn't hers, and she'd already opened it.  Then she gave me the open bottle."  John couldn't help but feel a sense of relief that the boy did not use the capital letters the other victims did.
"Just a few months."
"Most likely, yes."
"Yes."  Sherlock suddenly sounded robotic.  "Always.  I'm just a sexual psychopath.  Fuck me.  Sorry, please fuck me.  No, I mean Mummy, please fuck me.  Yes, I will.  Of course I'll tell you.  I always tell you.  That only happened once.  I'm sorry.  I know.  I love you too."
“The one that they thought was abusing her?”  A thought occurred to him.  “If she was treated at Bart’s like the others, I could talk to whoever saw her and whoever decided the father had done it.”
"His teachers said he had no friends and spent most of his time by himself. He couldn't name a single friend when he was asked about them."
"Not at first."  Sherlock fixed his eyes on the ground.  "After a few times She invited me in for a drink and a biscuit."
"The trial's over. As long as they don't name any of the victims or anyone whose identity might identify a victim, they're free to do as they like."
"That too."
Possibly because Lou and Susan appeared to be alternating positions, John expected Clark to step up to the stand.  It came as a surprise that Harvey walked up there instead, looking like she was on a mission.  "Are you ever planning to move back to Ireland?" she asked Mr. Aherne.  Unlike when she had questioned Kieran, she did not attempt to soften her voice or sound anything other than accusing.
"So John has been the only one who's had any big problems this week?" Dr. Dodson looked around at the group.
"He had some questions.  I answered them," was Sherlock's terse response.
Lou crossed his arms across his chest.  "How often were you allowed to see Jennifer?"
"Hello," Mrs. Bena replied.
"The same time as me."
"Fifty-two."
"Where did you come from today to get here?"
“I’m not going to leave,” John said.  Before he could think about it he spoke again.  “I love you.”
John could see Sherlock blink.  He knew that Sherlock and Phillip were a lot alike and had developed a close bond even separate from the case, and he realized that Sherlock had always known his dead father couldn't come to save him like that.  "If he's really spent ten years in court I think he'll be happy to see his son again.  And it won't help his mother's case when Phillip testifies today.  I mean, she knew he spent the night at K's flat."
"Did you tell your daddy?"
Phillip nodded.  “Yeah.  Like those things.  And She wanted me to do more and more before we got to cuddle.  I’d have to lick between Her legs a bunch of times, and not just once.  My jaw hurt from keeping it open so long.  She used to just ask me to put a finger there, or my penis, but She’d make me do more and more.  I had to use both hands, one to rub Her and the other one to stick my fingers in Her.  She liked me to put them in both spots.”
"Tell me about that."
This John had seemed relatively unfazed by most of what had happened up to this point, but this clearly stumped him. "So do you have any idea of what was going on?"
"Five years ago, for a little over a year.  They were the last children she'd fostered, incidentally.  They originally came to the country with their great-aunt, the only surviving member of the family.  She died while they awaited formal refugee status, so the two of them went into care once all the paperwork was done."
“Her mother was arrested?” Sherlock inquired.
Lou then looked at his watch.  John did the same and realized there was only an hour to go before the session ended.  “On Thursday, February 17, you didn’t go to school.”
"He'll wind up like me."  From the way he spoke it was clear Sherlock didn't consider that a compliment.
"But you were afraid of her?"
"Can I bring my pictures with me?" He had started down the hall, but turned to look back.
"No.  I appear to have woken up as someone else."
"You should get some sleep.  You need to sleep.  This isn't going to be over in a few days, anyway," John pointed out.
"It's okay, you don't have to look at me. What did they say next?"
Phillip looked uncomfortable.  After a moment or two he said: "Because nothing changed."
"Well, I don't." Staying on this track would be pointless. "Please don't do anything too drastic now."
"He'll be back, you know." She smiled at him before going down the stairs.
"What did you do then?"
"The brother knew?" Eli said.
"Is there any other reason?"
"But why leave the area?"
While Phillip and Sherlock talked, John just stood there in silence.  He didn't have the slightest clue what to say and at this point everything they were discussing was alien to him.  Even so, a thought occurred to him.  "When you were done with doing those things with her, did you feel good or miserable?"
"Did she ever mention that in her visits with you?"
John headed to the kitchen to make coffee.  Sherlock came in holding Hamish and stood off to the side.  He didn't ask for any, and John didn't offer him any.  Once John had finished his own coffee, he said "Let's go hail a cab.  We should get there as early as possible so we can talk to Lou and Susan."  They both headed out the door.  Before they left Sherlock got both his coat and scarf and put them on.  It was hot already and the temperature was only going to rise, but John decided not to comment on it.  Mrs. Hudson stood out in the hall, but didn't say anything to either of them.
"They said they just wanted to make sure I was okay and I wasn't getting hurt."
"Yes," John replied as he sipped his coffee.
Sherlock blinked. "What?"
“Well, there’s so little going on here that I’m looking up past employment records on two doctors who used to work here.  Both of them were before your time, and they both need some records for a new job.  Dr. Arthur was as horrible as he ever was – remind me to tell you some of the horror stories I have about him – but Dr. Martin and I had a nice chat.  She was always well-liked here.”
"I never went in there after three in the afternoon.  All the repairs are done after that, and it's my job to supervise those."
"When your arm was broken.  You didn't say to the doctor someone broke it deliberately."
He nodded.  “It's – well, it's a very long story.”
"The zoo."  Phillip brought the animal to his chest, looking lost in memory.  "I used to go there..."
"She came to our flat and said She was going to take me out.  Then She took me to Her car and we drove to the hospital with the fucking room."
John glanced back at the dock for the first time in days, and found K sitting there with a look of shock.  Every time he'd seen her before, she looked calm and composed, almost smug.  Now she looked like she was finally concerned about being convicted.
"Why would you then trust him to tell the truth about the subject?"
A sudden cry jolted him out of the recollection. He opened his eyes and John was in front of him. He didn't look angry, which surprised Sherlock most of all.
"Shocked at first.  It seemed so hard to believe - not that it could happen to one of my children, but that it was a secret for so long.  Then Moira told me she didn't know who had done it.  I thought she might be telling the truth, but the officers said that was unlikely."
"Being arrested.  Because of those other kids."
Mr. Rodgers sighed.  "We weren't together long.   Once she got pregnant with Phillip she wanted us to get married.  I refused; I knew a relationship between the two of us wouldn't work out.  Then the ultrasounds showed a girl, and she got excited.  When Phillip was born she was very disappointed."
"The 'no one really loved you' scenario?" guessed Peter.
"Just trying to bring you up to date before next week," Lestrade said as he put piles of paper in front of John and Sherlock.  "We've got to be very careful, make sure all the Is are dotted and the Ts crossed.  Also, Moira Aherne and her family are going to stop by.  She's got some anxiety about the trial and it'd be best to have someone she trusts tell her the details."
"I don't need to be babysat," Sherlock snapped back at him.
He heard the door open. John was home.
"I don't pay attention."
"Edwin's mother was short and dark-haired."  Mrs. Hudson looked up at John to see if he got her meaning.  "When I brought up having children, very early in our marriage, he said he didn't want any children as long as his mother was still alive.  When she died, I was already fifty and past that point."
"They'd ask how she was doing and if she needed anything.  Foster carers have limits on what they can talk about with a parent, so I had to be careful."
"Mummy would leave me there with Her."  The capital letter was back, John noted.  He wasn't particularly surprised by it, either.
He couldn't tell who was calling his name. The voice sounded vaguely familiar, but not enough to identify it.
"Who do you think Bruce Rodgers is?"
"No."
She smiled.  "Mr. Holmes!  You've got to come to my room because I've..."
"That's smart of you to figure that out." Sherlock sounded proud.
"Because I did."
Sherlock read. Phillip never addressed him as anything. "Mr. Holmes" or even "Holmes" seemed too formal, but he also shied away from the informal nature of "Sherlock." Sherlock didn't care; anything that made him more comfortable was a good thing.
"Sandwiches are fine. I don't want something deep-fried and I ate Indian yesterday." He glanced at Sherlock, who had receded into the background. "Are you going to come eat with us?" While Lestrade didn't add, "You never eat when you're on a case, and is this a case, right?" it was fairly obvious that was what he was implying.
Sherlock wants to know if there are other family members who might be threatened, and in the process discovers a more disturbing one.
"Your mother let you spend time with her."
Sherlock reveals some uncomfortable truths.
"I saw him have a flashback.  He was talking to me but didn't seem to know I was really there.  I think he thought I was -" here John almost said K before realizing that she would have no idea who K was - "his abuser."  He thought of something else.  "Intimacy issues, too.  He freezes at contact."
"Egg, bacon, and cheese sandwiches, and your cocoa of course," he said.  "The same room is open today.  Do you know if Victim One is here yet?"
"Which of the woodwinds do you play?" Sherlock sounded the same way he had when he had spoken to Moira Aherne – warm and pleasant.
Harvey made a disbelieving face.  "And what did he say to you?"
Without Sherlock sulking around or otherwise making himself noticed, John was able to have a fairly quiet evening.  He put on one of his jumpers, as the evening was cool, ate a bowl of cereal for supper, and watched a few of those trashy programs Sherlock always made comments about (although he stayed in the room watching them anyway).  Since he didn’t have to go to work or the trial the next day, he lost track of the time.  It was around one in the morning when he heard footsteps.
The part where John assumes. Sherlock notices this and right away starts to think that the problem isn't the hold on them (although there must be a big one) but that everyone else is assuming.  I'll also note here that although fifteen different victims are eventually named in the trial, only three of those are part of the original thirty that started the case.  No one else was able to come forward out of them, and a bunch of different people did. The real number is probably close to hundreds.  Out of them, there's probably three or four long term victims at any given time, those groomed and trained like Sherlock and Phillip.
"Yeah, I can," he said, and related the story he had told Sherlock, without once pausing.
“You think they struggle, do you?  I suppose that's what it's like when you and my little Sherlock are together, but I assure you I never have to make someone do anything.  Believe me, he wanted to do that.  He'd beg and say 'please.'  No force.  The older he was the more he wanted to do.  And he was still so much like he was back then.  So many of them become hairy and lumpy instead of soft and smooth.”  She broke eye contact with him to stare at Sherlock again, who looked like he wanted to evaporate on the spot.  “He didn't just want to sit in my lap and tell me he loved me.  Not by then.  Do you know how tall he was when he was twelve years old?  Look at me, I'm even shorter than you are.  Do you really think I could force him to do anything?”
John goes to the support group.
Tammy shook her head in sympathy.  "Too bad for both of them."
"K was that mother figure they wanted.  She was there and didn't smack them around, so they all figured it was worth the sex."  John knew perfectly well that Sherlock heard the unspoken
Mycroft headed for the door, not looking back.  "I'll be in touch," he said before he disappeared from sight.  Once he was gone, Sherlock slumped down on to the sofa, bee still under one arm.  He breathed heavily, like he had just engaged in vigorous activity.
"If I do they're not aware of me. My mother drank and I was taken into care when I was small. Either no one could take me or no one was able to. Nora was in care because she was abandoned when she was an infant."
By now Lestrade looked decidedly uncomfortable, and he stood, taking the file from the table.  "I just wanted to keep the two of you updated.  I should be going."  He didn't wait for a goodbye; he just walked out the door and down the steps.
"Ten years, I think."
"About a month ago she asked me if I was angry with her.  I said I wasn't and asked her why.  She said that I'd always said to not talk to people she didn't know and she had anyway.  I told her then that she hadn't just walked up to a stranger and started talking to them, she'd just answered when that woman had talked to her.  Then she said that she'd let her do things that she knew were wrong, and wasn't I mad with her for not telling me about it?  I said then that that woman knew what she was doing was wrong too, and she was an adult.  She was the one who's supposed to know better, not a little girl."  John could see Mr. Aherne give an angry glance to the dock.  "That was hard to hear.   After all that's happened she still feels like the one who's done something wrong.  I'd like to say we haven't had a conversation like that since, but there's been several just like that, I'm sorry to say."
John wanted desperately to question him further, to see if he wanted to get the story off his chest. But he knew Sherlock wouldn't respond to something like that. "If you ever want to talk about that, I'll be willing to listen." Figuring that he would want to be alone, John headed to his bedroom. He had only taken a few steps before he heard music. The haunting lament of a violin, sad enough to break your heart.
"Thank you," Phillip said.  He put his things back in the holdall and handed it to his father.  He turned to Sherlock and briefly grabbed him in a hug.
"I assume so.  Even when I was stoned out of my mind I didn't think Mrs. Williams was her real name."
"Yes, thank you," Lestrade responded, still looking at the large stuffed bee that Sherlock had tucked under his arm.  "We've also gotten some leads on some of K's former foster children, especially a family of four that lived with her for almost a year eight years ago.  While we all think it's important for Phillip Rodgers and Moira Aherne look through the photographs, it's probably a good idea if we wait on that.  They've been through enough already."
September 4
"What do you do there?"
"Apparently there was an investigation of a serial child abuser, and Jennifer's case fit into the pattern of them, so they wanted to talk to me.  I told them everything I knew, which wasn't much."
