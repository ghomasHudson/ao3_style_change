Sam looks startled. “Uh — what? I mean — um. Don’t you — you’ve dated people before, right? Dean told me about that girl — Nora, in Idaho.”
That makes her laugh. “Well shit, that makes two of us.” Her smile lingers, thoughtful. “I guess I just keep asking myself if I’m dumb to trust you, and I don’t think I am. I want you to know, if I’m keeping shit off your radar — it’s to make your life easier, not my own.”
Castiel nods, wordless. He can’t stop shaking. He can’t stop crying; every momentary lull gives way to another hiccuping sob, until Charlie just wraps him in her arms and puts her head on his chest and sways with him until he finally, finally cries himself empty.
Cas, wants him badly, and Cas — seems to maybe feel the same about him. He’s not an idiot, either; he could have sex without pitching himself into a tailspin. Probably. Maybe.
“It’s on all the cattle,” Dean explains, already moving away and picking up a heavy saddle and blanket from where they’re propped over a wooden rail. “Lets everyone know they’re ours. There’s a whole legal system around cattle brands — ask Ellen if you want to know more.” He ascends the steps of the bunkhouse, and hesitates. “Listen, I — gotta get ready to ride. You need me to take you back over to the big house, or —?”
“Ellen,” he says next, and for a moment she looks tiny in his bear hug of an embrace. “How’s Joanna?”
He watches the bronc riders take their turns with a growing sense of anticipation. No one turns in a heroic ride in the nineties; it’s one serviceable performance after another, and Dean’s lead is holding, hell, he can ride an 84 and stay comfortable, just a nice solid ride on a nice solid horse, and he’ll be good to go.
Who’s gone?
Castiel sighs. He looks around; the windy truckstop, the lonely halogen lights. He isn’t too far.
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean glimpses a gold shimmer. A stream of sand rises and spires. Another forms itself into a round globe, etched with unfamiliar continents. Jack’s eyes gleam, and the sandcastle is transforming itself: walls, rambling streets, river channels, the surrounding cliffs — it’s the city from
parents?”
Right. Dean fights down the urge to ask something stupid like
Still, he thinks of the northern lights, his first night with Dean, and he can’t help himself; he shakes his head, and he smiles.
“Dean,” she says instead, “what are you doing here?”
“There’s someone,” he says, “who’s a friend.”
Cas looks thoughtful. “There’s a — young woman who I believe shares her interest,” he says eventually. “But they are —” he uses careful air quotes — “‘taking it slow.’”
“Okay.” Castiel disentangles himself from Dean, reluctantly; Dean’s fingers hook around his button before they let him go. Standing back, he regrets the loss of contact between them even more. Dean’s hair is mussed, his mouth swollen, his legs in their clinging jeans bowed wide.
mother back. I asked him if he’d make me hear again.”
“Dean Winchester,” he says, “I have loved you in a thousand crappy motel rooms. And I mean to love you in a thousand more.”
Triple A tells him a tow truck will be there in three hours. Castiel sighs, again, and goes to keep himself warm inside the cab.
They fall asleep spooned together, Castiel’s arm heavy over Dean’s ribs. He wakes a few hours later, three in the morning, to the sensation of Dean arching his ass back into his rapidly re-stiffening cock. They fuck hard and quiet, Castiel’s left hand splayed over Dean’s stomach, Dean twisting his neck to suck the fingers of Castiel’s right hand into his mouth.
Dean nods. “And, uh. Have there — been any? Recent deaths? Like on the retreat, or anything?”
Jack looks at him like he just punched a kitten.
Castiel flinches instinctively, hand flying up as if to shield his face. He stops it belatedly, cheeks burning — he’s always hated being photographed. Jo cackles, thrusts the camera back into his hands, and runs as if he’s going to chase her.
Of course. Castiel remembers that, too; the younger brother headed down a dangerous road. He hasn’t received any further specific information, so it must not be mission-critical. Zachariah always sounded a little bit gleeful when he spoke about it, though. Castiel never understood why.
and he suddenly stills, because that’s — that’s the point of this, isn’t it.
He crosses the room and stands by Dean’s bed. For a moment he just watches him — the way his face twitches, the tremors of misery across his mouth. Then he touches Dean’s cheek.
When he releases Dean, Castiel staggers. He lands on the floor himself, sitting down hard, and his back hits the doorframe. He feels dizzy; with anger, with relief. With weakness, probably, though he’d do it again. He’d do it again.
“I don’t want to presume,” he tells it, primly, out loud.
Since then, Castiel’s sort of come to terms with it — though it took a long time for Charlie to convince him that his history with women didn’t at least make him bi — and come out to exactly no one. He’s learned enough about porn to get himself off on a regular basis, and Charlie’s gentle coaxing to put himself out there has died down to an occasional, half-hearted “You know —” before Castiel cuts her off again.
After breakfast, they go to the bait shop. “Hey, Clarence,” says the guy behind the counter, and Cas tugs Dean closer to his hip and says, “This is the friend I was telling you about. Who inspired me to learn about fishing.” Then, an instant later, he corrects himself: “Boyfriend.”
And he tells Cas his theory. About how plesiosaurs are hardly even a big part of
The one who spoke has a cigarette in one hand. He’s thin, wiry, with a dark, straggling fringe of beard on his chin and an insolence in the way he slouches back against the gate. The other one —
Castiel bottoms out. He stays there for a moment, hands clenched on Dean’s hips for balance, feeling brighter than the sun; then, because Dean asked Castiel to fuck him, he does.
“Oh,” Dean mumbles through a mouthful of tortilla chips — great thing about small-town restaurants, they see no reason not to serve fancy pizza and also tortilla chips. He swallows. “It’s, uh — Swedish furniture store. Giant place. Sell all their stuff like, flat-packed, so you assemble it yourself.”
And there, at the foot of the stairs — he’s a fool. It’s 2003, of course; of course Jimmy Novak is here too.
Castiel
The air outside is humid and warm. The moon is out, nearly full, hanging low in the sky. Dean is moving with purpose, faster, around the back of the building, toward where they parked the Impala. He slips into shadows and out again, and Castiel hurries to keep up, until suddenly — suddenly Dean’s wheeling around, and Castiel nearly stumbles into him.
Maybe he’s reading too much into it. The Dean behind him makes a soft, punched-out sound, and Castiel doesn’t think he’s far off base.
That choice isn’t going to keep him occupied for long. He sighs and sets down the menu.
Sam shouts.
Dean finds leverage, cants up again, and grinds the cleft of his ass against Castiel’s cock. His rim catches at the head, and Castiel groans, can’t help thrusting against it. “Wait,” he breathes, “wait, wait,” and then he’s got slick fingers sliding between their bodies, plunging home.
of this is your fault,” Ellen continues, face stern. “I don’t know what your family shit is like; it’s none of my business, unless you want it to be. But I know I respect your dad well enough as a businessman, and I’d drop my own kid in a tank full of sharks before I’d give her up for him to raise.” She raises her shot glass. “No offense meant.”
“Cas,” Dean croaks,
Cas bites his lip in mild annoyance.
He watches Dean eat. He doesn’t think Dean always had enough to eat, as a child; he knows he didn’t have ice cream. Not unless he earned the money for it himself.
It sounds stupid when she says it like that. It sounds like something Dean might’ve called it. Castiel shrugs, and she chuckles.
He chokes on his coffee. “Dean, I’m
What a night.”
Castiel doesn’t need telling twice. His finger slides deeper as he pulls off and sinks down again, and maybe he doesn’t know what he’s doing, but it doesn’t really seem to matter when Dean’s writhing and cursing and then saying, “Cas, I’m —”

them,
Slowly, out of the murky gloom that used to be — still is, Castiel hopes — the bunker’s library, Dean’s silhouette emerges.
“What if,” says Cas slowly. “What if there’s no pattern at all?”
It’s a long shot; those jobs aren’t easy to get. But.
Dean’s gaze snaps up, uncomfortably grateful. “I’ll come up, too,” he says, “I mean, I’m not saying I won’t, just —”
Dean shakes his head slowly. “No…”
type family. My girlfriends practically had to audition for the part. Their parents, too. My mother would host a dinner party, and if anyone used the wrong fork —”
“All right,” says Castiel, and Dean is gone before he has any time to ponder the question of what, exactly, he just agreed to.
Still later, he adds, “I don’t think Sammy wanted a chihuahua, though.”
Cas said he was, though. Cas said Dean was the most loving person he’d ever met.
Esmeralda’s ears prick, watching them, and she breaks for a few strides into her own jog. Then she seems to remember that she has the inept rider today, and subsides back into a walk.
Cas says, “Take off your boxers.”
” says Dean.
It feels like a loaded question. It feels like a universe worth of possibilities; the phone in Dean’s pocket keeps buzzing sporadically, his father trying to contact him, but he hasn’t moved to answer.
They leave Chuck there, weeping and powerless. In the wreckage of his story. In the beauty of the world he made.
He kisses him by the luggage rack and he kisses him into bed, he kisses his temples and his eyelids and the sturdy beat of his heart, he kisses Dean’s hands and his ribs and his mouth again, always his mouth, and Dean makes small, senseless sounds and flutters his hands over Castiel’s back, his thighs, but Castiel stops him when he tries to go for his belt; just kisses him, and keeps kissing him, until Dean relaxes boneless into him and gives up all his fight.
Dean is looking down at him, and his eyes are dry; he looks in control of himself again. He’s still holding onto Castiel’s hands, though. He looks wrung out, but calm.
Castiel thanks her and returns the last box to its place. He’ll have to return tomorrow; maybe the next day, too. He can’t say he objects to the possibility.
“You, uh.” He clears his throat. “You think I should?”
Inside, the Pizza Palace isn’t quite palatial, but someone clearly put care into the details. There’s a flower in a vase on their table, and a candle that burns with a clear, soft flame. The exposed brick walls are lined with posters, scenes of Italy — Castiel recognizes some of them from long ago. He murmurs to Dean about Rome in the days of Julius Caesar, about Mt. Vesuvius. About the grotto he used to go to to be alone with his thoughts, the thin strand of beach hidden under cliffs on the isle of Capri.
Today in Canadian country songs as source material: Corb Lund,
But the questions are easier this time. Dean’s not sure if that’s how they’re written or he’s just run out of fucks to give; either way, he has no problem answering. He can tell Cas some things he likes about him, no problem. He can tell him he’d like to share his record collection with someone — like to sit and listen, point out the guitar nerd shit and just soak up the words. That he did that a little with Jack, and he’s still not sure where to settle the lump of
he murmurs, and,
“What happened? Are you hurt?” Dean catches one of Castiel’s hands in his, then both, squeezing hard.
It might be to Jack. “We need to ascertain how far this has spread. Is it only America? Only the Midwest? Did it affect monsters, or demons? Are other angels gone? If you can get on the internet, try —”
“Oh. You’re speaking of the watchman at the factory. I assure you, I do not usually leave my vessels in such condition; that was due to the interference of — others. Any further life I grant you — it will be a full life, in possession of all your faculties.”
“Castiel,” says Cas. “Winchester.”
it says,
There are no ghosts or monsters waiting for him, though. Just a simple little cottage, curtains drifting around the open windows. Sunlight falls across the wooden floor. There’s a small kitchen, and what looks like a bedroom, and a staircase leading up to more bedrooms. Outside the windows is an enormous wraparound porch, already outfitted with rocking chairs, and beyond — the shore and the glittering water of the lake.
Castiel struggles to sit up. “Wait.”
He can feel Sam watching him as he scratches out the
Ellen puts down her fork with a sharp
The thing is — the thing is.
He sees Dean’s shoulders tense, even though he’s sure he’s already heard the door. Then Dean says, in a voice that sounds more tired than angry, “Jesus Christ, Cas, it’s not like that. Just come over here.”
“Yes,” says Castiel. “Don’t get a motel room. Come here. To Gabe and Kali’s. Come stay with me.”
The mare’s still wild, still bucking a little as she races a circle around the arena, but Cas gets the sense it’s mostly for the joy of it — almost, that she’s showing off for the crowd. The two other horsemen in the arena move to flank her as they did the first horse, and the rider falls sideways to wrap his arms around the other man’s waist. As his own mount gallops on, he lets go, dropping neatly to the dirt. He grins out at the crowd, waving, and jogs to retrieve his hat.
true. That much he can do.
Dean sounds a little distracted.
Castiel sees Dean’s jaw tighten, the muscle in his cheek work.
Castiel closes his eyes. He stretches out his awareness, on the wings of his grace. Over the city, the surrounding towns; the countryside with its fields of corn. Over the river of cars stretching west on a ribbon of asphalt, and — there.
It’s after noon the next day before Dean stumbles into the kitchen, rumpled and robe-clad and smiling like he can’t help himself. By then, Castiel has already conferenced with Jack and Sam, helped them with the final stages of the plan they started on last night.
“I’m not sure, actually.” Dean tests its weight by tipping it; it won’t be hard to carry out to the Impala. Whatever’s inside is pretty light. He checks the side, and yep: that his name there. Not Cas’s, not Sam’s.
Dean ducks his head as if to hide his smile under his hat. “Thought we might turn out the ponies to graze for a bit. You look around, I’ll cook us up some dinner?”
He’s here in everything that happened to them, really — in the family they built. In the fact that they ever lived to have a place called home.
” He huffs out a breath through his grin, dropping his head back to the pillow. “I mean. It’s just not what I was expecting. You seem pretty — toppy,” he says.
“I am very,” Cas says, in a kind of shell-shocked voice, “glad you did.”
It’s from Dean.
“Gotta start looking for a job.”
He makes up some bullshit about chupacabras. Cas doesn’t call him on it. He lets Dean ramble. He never actually answers for himself.
Castiel wraps a hand around his cock.
Behind Castiel, someone clears his throat loudly.
It looks different than usual. Chunkier. Like he’s carrying something on his hip.
The words keep ringing in his mind. He meant it to come out as a joke, and it was one, but —
Themselves. Not Chuck, not even Dad; Dean tests the idea, like probing a sore tooth.
Castiel swallows. “I’m sorry,” he says, in a low voice. “I’m really sorry. I’m — so used to playing a part for my family’s sake, I — have maybe come to expect the same behavior in others.”
When he reemerges, he lets Castiel order them enough Chinese food for a small army and press him down onto the couch with a beer and a selection of his DVDs. He gripes about the poor representation of westerns, but seems happy enough with Indiana Jones, in the end. Once Cas joins Dean on the couch and Dean pulls him snug to his hip, it’s not like even Harrison Ford can keep their full attention for long.
Castiel moves to follow them, but as he tries to withdraw his hand, Dean’s fingers tighten around it. He hesitates.
And Castiel remembers — a story he’d heard, long ago. That archangel blades are built differently. To kill the angel, and leave the vessel unharmed.
Other times, he thinks that Dean’s buried himself in parenting for most of his life. That it’s what he knows to do when he can’t handle whatever else is going on. That maybe — just maybe — that’s why his eyes keep sliding carefully away from Castiel’s face.
He rolls over when Dean gets up, and grumbles at the sudden absence of a body’s worth of heat. The next he knows, there’s a pair of cold lips pressed to his forehead, and Dean saying, “Stay there. There’ll be coffee in a few.”
“I got a chance, Dean,” John pleads, low and fervent. “A chance to get it right.”
They never talked about a tour of the rest of the ranch. Not really, though when Dean spoke of it with such open love —
The Impala blows a tire about three miles past Topeka.
They lapse into silence, and when Cas slides the new tape into the Impala’s deck, he’s greeted by a lonesome-sounding fiddle, then George Strait crooning:
He’s rewarded by a glance from Dean, startled and then warm, and when they turn a corner and emerge onto the lakeshore again, Dean stops, letting Castiel come up beside him. “Right, well. So this wasn’t too long after Sonny’s — I guess we were in New York for a while that year. Dad didn’t even let me take Sam up to the ranch for the summer, Bobby was pissed, but — anyway.” He swings himself down to sit on a rock by the water, glancing sidelong up at Castiel. “We’d never been to the city, right? Dad had a thing about it, too dirty, too loud, hated the Yankees, but Sammy begged him to go, and he caved — I dunno why. So we do — the whole nine. Ride the subway, see all the sights, eat too much pizza. Get back to the hotel around midnight, and Sam and Dad are zonked, and I figure, screw it. I’m going to CBGB.”
Castiel can tell the moment Dean fully wakes up — the moment it takes Castiel all the strength he has in him not to
The first activity on their agenda for Saturday morning, after breakfast, is listed only as:
It helps, Cas being there, he thinks — when he wakes up in time, he can smooth gentle hands over Dean’s shoulders, his hips, pull him close, and Dean will steady and quiet. Other times, it takes more effort, and Dean doesn’t calm until his eyes fly open, breathing hard. Once, he wakes Castiel up by sitting straight up in bed, in the middle of the night, and declaring, in a deep, sleep-rough voice,
He withdraws his thumb from his mouth and reaches out. Castiel doesn’t have to think about it. He lifts his own hand to catch the tiny, sticky one. Shakes it solemnly.
Castiel pushes this door open slowly. After all, he doesn’t want to hit Dean.
After that I figured —”
They have. Castiel says, “Yes.”
Angel on my shoulder.”
Dean watches the other cars they pass as he drives. Semis in orderly convoys and families on their way home from vacation, frazzled parents bent over steering wheels. The occasional lonely drifter, like he used to be, with no one to sit in their passenger seat.
He’s not sure if he says something, with his stance or his eyes or the muscles at the corner of his mouth, but a breath gusts out of Dean, sudden, and he’s moving close. “Hey,” he says, with his hand between Castiel’s shoulderblades, and then, “Hey,” again, and kisses his cheekbone, his hairline. “Thanks for being here.”
It quickly becomes obvious that that’s exactly what John means.
“Sleep or whatever, yada yada, okay tough guy. Stare at the ceiling all night for all I care. But the bed’s plenty big enough for two.”
Dean lowers his hands slowly. He glances around, looking spooked. “I thought — you were just gonna lock me in that room or something.”
“But —” Castiel starts.
He can hear a pen moving across paper, faintly. Then Mia asks, “And was that what prompted you to speak to him about your feelings?”
“No?”
Castiel feels blindingly angry.
no.” Dean chokes out an incredulous laugh, but he’s smiling as he twines his fingers with Castiel’s, pulling him closer. “Shit, sweetheart. It’s a good thing. It’s
Dean’s just taking a breath — to say something dumb.
“Thank you,” answers Cas, trying not to sound choked up, but trembling with relief. “God, I — I’m sorry, I’m not usually like this.”
There are swans on the sloughs, in places. Chattering flocks of dull-plumaged shorebirds wheeling like dry leaves.
“Okay,” he adds quickly. “Yes.”
When they reach the pulloff, they stop and unload the horses. “Cas,” Ellen calls casually as she adjusts a buckle, “you want Daphne, or Es?”
And he thinks about it, as Dean drives them across town, as Dean holds the door for him at the diner; about the things Dean’s layers of clothing conceal. The shape of his body, maybe, and the fragility of it; the gun tucked into his waistband and the knife in his boot and the fears he carries like weapons in his belly. Today, those fears seem distant. Today, Dean’s clothes are hiding the handprint on his shoulder where Castiel marked him. The tenderness between his legs where Castiel fucked him. They do nothing to hide the way Dean’s eyes always turn to Castiel; the giddy hunger on his face.
Jo poses and smiles for the camera. Bobby stares directly into it, straight-faced, when Castiel asks, like it’s a painful duty to be discharged. He’s almost too terrified to ask Ellen, but Jo does it before he can stop her, and Ellen looks up briefly like she’s going to kick both their asses before her face thaws into a — one part awkward, three parts heart-stoppingly lovely — smile.
“Hurts,” Dean gasps through a spasm, breath stuttering. “Laughing — fuckin’ broken ribs.” His face is taut now, humor gone.
“I’m riding next weekend,” says Dean, curtly. “The one after? Two weeks from now?”
There’s not much of the gory details that Cas missed, Dean thinks, when he raised him from hell. Took Dean’s soul in his hands and pieced it back together. It’s not the sort of thing they bring up.
“There is nothing for you to be sorry for.” Castiel smiles at him, helpless; he loves looking at Dean. He loves the spark of embarrassed hope in Dean’s eyes, the way his mouth curves when he looks up at Castiel.
Cas isn’t in the kitchen, though evidence of him is. His suit jacket and trenchcoat hanging off the back of the chair, as if maybe trudging around all day in the Arizona heat finally got to him a little; Dean’s own t-shirt is stuck to his body with sweat. There’s a handful of unused ziploc bags lying on the table, and the back door is open.
Right now, though? Right now, he’s gonna make Cas a cheeseburger.
Dean holds his gaze and calls his bluff. “If that’s what you want, Cas.”
The ghost town is nearly in Mexico.
It’s a discovery, this process. What it’s like to have a human sleeping in bed with him — what it’s like for a human to
At dinner, Dean looks increasingly nervous. His foot is jittering on the floor; he casts an anxious glance at Castiel, once, almost pleading, as if to say,
There’s a cake on the table, along with two pies.
dude. You scared the shit out of me.”
“Thought you were gonna say my hand there for a sec,” Dean mutters, but he’s still smiling. “A ball in the hand is worth two in the bush. Cas — can I tell you something dumb?”
Floss orbits them in long arcs, vanishing for lengthy stretches and reappearing, panting happily, atop the next hill. After half an hour of riding, a long gray cloud obscures the sun, casting the prairie in a denser, closer green. Even when Castiel looks down at Esmeralda’s feet, uncomfortable with his seat on an unexpected descent, he finds golden prairie pea blooming in the dust among her hooves, their path fringed by heavy clusters of shadbush flowers that perch on their shrubby branches like clumps of snow. The chorus of birdsong is constant, parting around them in an envelope of silence as they pass, but everywhere else bubbling from the land like the prairie’s own living breath.
“About — how people like to use me. And, and discard me. I think that’s what you said.”
The first thing the next morning, they’ve got visitors looking for birds.
“It’s honestly really boring,” Castiel apologizes, unlocking the lab building and holding the door for Dean to follow him in. “Just — code. It doesn’t even really mean anything, yet.”
“Right — yeah.” Dean blinks. He’s never really thought about that. He struggles for a moment to catch up; then he realizes they’ve lapsed into silence. Is he supposed to be the one saying something? “So, uh — how does this work?”
But he lets Sam help him out of the room.
She’s right, is the fucking thing.
“It’s not a flunkie, it’s his son,” the woman interrupts sharply, “and I expect you to be civil to him.”
Then there’s a choking sound from the doorway, and Sam says, “I —”
first date you’ll kiss, but. Really those sorts of codified expectations do more harm than good, you should go at whatever pace you and she both feel comfortable at, and —
“Ma’am?” the cowboy — Dean — asks quietly, stopping a few paces shy of the porch.
She stops. She looks profoundly awkward. Dean has the distinct impression that Greta doesn’t much like dealing with people, never mind startling trenchcoated blue-eyed gay partners of caretakers she’s hired sight-unseen.
Dean after he hangs up the phone is vacant. His eyes are calm; he drives like a demon is after them, but his hands don’t clench on the wheel. His shoulders are settled, his movements are sure.
Because it’s shocked, but it’s also heated; because Cas’s voice just dropped a full goddamn octave. Because Cas just walked into Dean’s bedroom and saw him touching himself and stopped dead — and didn’t turn around.
Castiel has an idea. He doesn’t like it, though. “Will you let me try something?” He remembers what Dean said about consent; “I’ll need to touch your wrist. You may feel a slight tingling.”
Castiel doesn’t know what to say to that.
It vibrates against his palm, and he drops it reflexively, pushing himself back against the wall. The toe of his boot knocks it away. It clatters halfway across the room and lands in one point of the Devil’s Trap, then sits there, buzzing,
He remembers telling Cas to back off. Setting him up with a girl two nights later. Trying to deal with it without dealing with it. The Dean Winchester way.
Dean shifts again, and it only gets worse.
The forks and knives jump and judder on the tablecloth. A pepper shaker is beginning to tip back and forth on its base. Laura looks shocked, her frizzy hair even frizzier than usual — only, Dean realizes after an instant, that’s because it’s being plucked from its pins by a sudden cold wind. He exhales, and he can see his breath.
say you will —”
“And?” Charlie presses, clearly intrigued.
“Dean. Did you feel — before you learned of Chuck’s manipulations, did you feel you had been able to act freely? Have you always felt safe in the belief that your life was your own?”
able to give you?”
“Not,” he says quickly, “not that I just — want you for, I mean, I —”
He says as much to Dean, and Dean turns shy and a little tentative before he asks, “You know. We’re not that far from the Minnesota one, if you still wanted to go — I know you’ve already been to see it, but —”
and break that programming — who’s seen Dean at his absolute fucking worst in the Pit, touched him and raised him and made him whole — up and leaving because things are a little awkward. Hell, Cas is already awkward; he’s always been awkward. It’s one of the many things that make Dean want to kiss him stupid.
Castiel thumbs Dean’s pulse; it flutters under the skin of his wrist. “And you’re afraid that if we have sex tonight, you’ll start worrying again.”
But the voices downstairs are familiar ones.
“Yeah,” says Dean. His mouth curves upward a fraction. “You said.”
Castiel moves past Missouri, pulls Dean to his feet, and hugs him.
“Good.” Castiel doesn’t quite know how to say,
But Sam comes to the rescue.
happy. He told me so.”
Your mouth, especially. Your hands.”
“I’m not someone you cry for,” Dean says roughly. “I’m serious. Lock it down, or I’m done.” And he turns and leaves, the door banging loudly behind him.
Cas looks
He wonders if Mom ever got annoyed at him. She must have. It’s dumb to imagine she didn’t.
Dean’s heart beats a little faster.
The pamphlet they were given has bright photographs of birds. Scarlet tanagers and black-and-white warblers and hermit thrushes, which look drab and brown but the pamphlet says
“Hey,” he says breathlessly, pressing the phone to his ear. His skin is still damp and flushed from the shower, hair in wet curls that brush against the plastic, but through the mist on the mirror, he can see himself smiling so wide it almost hurts.
Dean swallows. “Mia says that sometimes we need to be kind to our inner child,” he offers. “Like, give ourselves what we didn’t get when we were kids. Maybe Jack is… maybe Jack’s doing that literally.”
Dean swears softly under his breath. “Cas, don’t be an idiot. I’m just trying to get to know them, like Claire asked, right?” And — he doesn’t know why he does it, really, it’s just that there’s a small table between them, and candlelight, and they’re supposed to be acting like a couple, and Cas’s hand is right there — and Dean reaches out to take it.
Dean’s looking down. “It was dumb. The risk — I should’ve —”
As Clayton thunders out something about “a rare double appearance from tonight’s bareback bronc champion, and boy was that a pretty ride,” Castiel leans toward Ellen and asks, “Why is he riding again? Isn’t he better at bareback?”
If he says that, Sam will ask him what he means. If Sam asks him what he means, Dean will have to answer, and he can’t answer — not without explaining everything that happened. Cas saying,
Castiel doesn’t. He stares at John Winchester instead, unblinking. Something’s rattled him. Castiel can’t read him, though; can’t bring himself to focus, to truly want to know what’s in John’s heart. Not when Dean is struggling to swallow beside him. Not when Dean’s battling down nausea and worry and resentment and pure, surging fear.
He has his shirtsleeves rolled up to his elbows, knees in the dirt. He’s got more bags out here, each of them full of little seeds, and Dean’s reminded suddenly, powerfully, of the time Cas helped him organize the bunker’s storage room; of his handwriting on the labels, messier than you’d expect, and the way he’d roll his eyes at Dean’s choice of categories, then write them down anyway. Of how he could touch things that might be dangerous and know what they were. Of the time he yanked Dean away from a cursed box so fast they wound up sprawled on the floor together, chest to chest.
He sees Rachel’s stare following him, frozen in shock, all the way out the door.
“Why are you asking?” he says instead.
“Hey,” Dean says, a few hours later. They’ve packed a picnic lunch and hiked halfway around the lake; they’re sitting on adjacent rocks now, fishing lines floating lazily on the water. “Can I ask — why’d you want to bring me here? Like, here, specifically?”
Now Castiel’s given him the means. He’s given him the opportunity. He shouldn’t expect anything different.
The anticipation slams a shudder through Castiel’s body; Dean’s going to kiss him again. Dean’s eyes are on his mouth, and Dean’s going to kiss him again; Dean’s fingers are curling under his shirt collar, brushing his skin.
He can feel how Dean stretches to take it. He looks down to watch one knuckle disappearing, then the next, and imagines his dick doing this — how wide Dean will need to stretch, how tight it will feel. He pulls Dean’s ass cheek open wider with one thumb and watches his fingers pump in, out; when he releases it, the mark of his thumb remains, white and then flushing pink. Fascinated, Castiel does it again, palming Dean’s whole ass cheek this time and squeezing; he can see his handprint, briefly, when he lets go.
Castiel drinks more tea. Time passes; fifteen minutes. Twenty. The bar door swings open again, and it’s John Winchester, alone. He climbs into his truck and drives away.
Sam’s surprise lasts only half a second. Then he says, “Yeah. Yeah, we should.”
That’s what Uriel said, and raised his eyebrows, like it was a scandalous thing — to be spoken about only in the lowest of murmurs, in the darkest corners of Heaven.
Then there are more birds surrounding them, black and white and brown and tern-like, calling in high voices. They have teeth, too. One of them swoops low to the water and catches a small fish. It gulps it down on the wing.
, which is neither Canadian nor country but was excellent editing music for this chapter.
A swoosh, and a splash. Jack’s completely distracted. Castiel fills their bucket quickly with water and upends his catch into it. “Look what we got! How many tadpoles? One, two —”
Dean hesitates.
“Not because of me,” Cas agrees softly, and his eyes are on Dean’s face, and they’re casting heat.
“That explains it,” Dean mutters, and cracks another peanut, and orders another beer.
“You know there are no roads to the place Garth told you about,” Cas mentions one day, flipping through a magazine. “You’d have to fly. By bush plane, I assume.”
He thinks of objecting, and then thinks better of it.
The plesiosaur isn’t doing very much.
is what this thing is.”
That goes out the window. He doesn’t want distance. He wants to be as close as they can possibly be. “Cas,” he croaks out, “will you — kiss me?”
“I’m facing a — similar problem,” he says finally. “I wish I could offer you the wisdom of experience, but I think perhaps — perhaps you should try telling them anyway.”
“Come on then, sweetheart,” Dean tells the calf, and starts calmly up the hillside, letting out another, more complex whistle as he does.
“Because —” Dean takes a big bite of food, chews for a moment, then sighs, revealing half-masticated eggs. “Because he’ll kill you, that’s why. Or
“Of course, the food was very different then,” he adds, as he opens his menu. “They didn’t have tomatoes.”
Castiel hears his throat make a sound. He thinks his grace stutter-stops; it doesn’t shatter any lights this time. It feels like it’s pulled inside him, instead — all concentrated down to that one point of attention, of
“Cas,” says Dean again, and then he’s sitting up between Castiel’s legs, hips in his hands, kissing his chest, his throat. Castiel moans his encouragement, and Dean kisses him harder, stubble scraping his collarbone. He curls one hand over Castiel’s cock, then down around his balls, murmuring, “I got you, babe, I got you —”
“Just so I’m clear,” he says after a moment, “you are
“Who you here for?”
“That’s good,” Chuck murmurs again, as if to himself. He’s wearing a half-smile of satisfaction, eyes gleaming, but the look on his face is scornful. Almost bored.
“And everything else we’ve done isn’t?” Castiel inquires, but Dean is grinning as he flips him off and lets himself out of the bathroom, a cloud of steam hounding him as he goes.
— even though Cas is pretty sure there are no turkeys in this part of Alberta and would not for the life of him have characterized the gentle swell of land they just crossed as a ridge.
And that’s because he couldn’t have. He, Castiel, angel of the Lord, with all his vast and ageless knowledge of mankind, could not have imagined this secret: these fingers flexed around a steering wheel, the laughter at the corners of these eyes.
“You should — you could have some. If you want.”
“It’s been nice, thank you.”
Castiel hesitates. “I — don’t actually eat much. Or, at all. I could — if it would make you more comfortable for me to watch over you from here —”
Dean blinks. Sounds excruciating. “And that’s good news?”
It doesn’t make him feel any better when it’s Dean’s turn to ride.
achingly hard; he reaches down to palm his dick.
The later ones are written in Ellen’s — a tradition carried on.
“I —” Castiel intends to politely refuse, but his stomach protests painfully; it’s operating on coffee and very little else, and his whole body feels shaky and chilled. “Thank you,” he says instead, taking the hash brown. The first bite is greasy, starchy heaven.
For a moment, Charlie just looks surprised. Then she scrunches up her face and says, slowly, “
when they win.
He’s spending the day at the Geological Survey of Canada’s core storage facility, selecting rock samples for the project he hopes will be the final chapter of his Ph.D. His goal is to compare paleoenvironments across a latitudinal gradient along the Canadian Rocky Mountain front, but selecting the right cores to analyze will be critical. They’ll all be made up of sediments from an ancient ocean, but he needs ones deposited in deep enough water to constitute a continuous record and shallow enough to reflect environmental variability; ideally, someone will have already worked on them, acquiring baseline data and benchmarking the record with dates.
And he’s right to, because this — this is even fucking better. Dean falls back against the door, and Cas is with him, chests pressed together, hands on hips; fire ignites everywhere they touch. His heart is racing, soaring. Cas is touching him all over, making quick work of buttons, intent on his task, and Dean has to grab his hands to stop him before his own system shorts out.
He sees Dean crack an eyelid open. “You gonna sit watch over there all night?”
John can’t see him; he’s hidden behind the armchair. But Michael must sense Castiel’s wave of relief, or Dean’s motion, or hear the sound of a thumb on a hammer; he turns. His body looks momentarily awkward, pivoting — the gawky teenage form that it is.
“Yeah,” he murmurs a moment later, when they break free. “Yeah, tha’sme. Handsy.” He tweaks both Dean’s nipples with his thumbs as he says it, and smiles, pleased with himself, when Dean sucks in a sharp breath. “Whatcha gonna do about it?”
” and when Cas presses inward, lets out a sound that can only be described as a whine.
Under the warm spray, Castiel lets Dean apply soap to his body. He could clean himself up in a blink of his grace, but he doesn’t say that; he watches as Dean traces fingers over the plane of his belly, tangles them in the hair at the base of his dick.
loudly again, which Castiel is sure he should object to on grounds of laying low, but — he doesn’t know what to do. He doesn’t know how to respond to mockery. He’s never faced it before; not from a mere human.
Eileen’s there when they get back to the bunker. She takes one look at them, walking in the door, and holds out a hand to Sam. “Pay up.”
“I had hoped that the paradox would destroy you.” Michael nicks his skin, deliberate, enough for some grace to seep out; Castiel feels nauseous, closes his eyes. “But perhaps this is a blessing — this time, I can kill you slow.”
“No. You do not have —
“Yes,” he agrees. “I’m coming home.”
“Nah.” Gabriel’s smile only widens. “We talked it over, and we felt like the institution of marriage is an oppressive regime designed to reinforce women’s place in the home and —”
Castiel feels an indescribable calm settle over him.
So does the blackness. Castiel can feel his limbs again. He touches his mouth, and his fingers come away clean.
She glances over at him, and whatever she sees makes her smile. “Not often,” she says. “Every once in a while someone might catch a kick when they’re unlucky, but these boys know how to fall. And the horses won’t go after a rider — bulls will, that’s why we have the bullfighters in to distract them, but the horses just want to buck.”
“But me especially,” Dean says. “I was especially fucked up.”
“I’m sorry.”
he thinks once, in the midst of another interrogation on whether there are any nice girls in his life, how Hannah’s doing —
It’s a new one for him. It throws him for loops, sometimes; it throws him for loops every damn day. The first one comes when Jack says he isn’t coming home. That he’ll be in the rain or whatever. That it’s just gonna be Sam and Dean.
His first instinct is to fire back,
“Oh.” Dean’s not sure what else he has to say to that.
He hasn’t realized, until this moment, that deciding is the name for the task at hand. It’s reassuring to understand that much, at least.
That comes later that night. They’re lying next to each other, drowsy and sated, fingers intertwined; Castiel’s mind humming pleasantly on the edge of sleep. Dean’s grip tightens on his and he says, in a slow, sleepy, armorless voice, “I don’t want to see him.”
Castiel blinks. “I see.”
Dean shivers again.
The woman’s voice is low and dangerous. “The last thing Bill wanted,” she says, “was to lose this place. And you know as well as I do, Bobby, that we are
Jack is leaning forward, engrossed in the story. Dean bites back another snarky comment.
Great. So that’s Cas’s association with Dean and motel rooms — literal shit. Good for him to know.
Sleep is elusive. He makes it to about five thirty in the morning before he goes to Sam for help.
For a moment, the three of them just stare at each other.
You guys. I'm so sorry I haven't had time to reply to every one of your comments on chapter one; please know that they've had me positively chewing my fist grinning. Thank you so much.
says the neon sign reflected in a puddle. A couple comes out of their room to smoke in the plastic chairs outside their door, then goes inside again. A pair of people across the parking lot have an angry, murmured conversation, and one gives the other money.
The next day, they drive to the end of the plains, and into rumpled folds of green mountains. The highway cuts through the rock in long tunnels and breaks free again, and Castiel tells Dean about his own life, a little; about the making of things. About the angels in his garrison and his battles in the time mankind was young. Dean listens in soft fascination, and later, when Castiel asks him about the music he plays, he launches into his own tales of mythic glory — of Led Zeppelin, of Jimi Hendrix, of the Rolling Stones.
“But,” Mia continues, “I know that you have a date coming up this weekend. I think that for the rest of this session, we should focus specifically on what it is you need to feel equipped for that. Can you explain for me what, exactly, is making you nervous? How you feel these topics are connected?”
He doesn’t stop until he’s miles from home, up past the university. He gives the bike path one last, longing look. He could keep following it all the way out into the country, if he really wanted to — up onto bluffs and down through bristling subdivisions and up again, until there’s no Tyvek in sight, until it’s just old water stations on the train tracks and the river and the sky —
Gonna do a little
Cas would be so fucking good at this. He’s got the right kind of confidence; equal parts earned and unschooled. He’d go by instinct, Dean’s sure he would. And he’d be fucking incredible.
The statement takes Castiel aback briefly, then makes him bristle. “If you think I don’t feel the same about him —”
Castiel finds it after a moment’s searching. “Your taste in music seems well suited to road songs,” he observes, and waits for the Zeppelin song to finish before changing out the tapes.
It’s not really a sore subject between them, not anymore. Jack seems happy with his new role presiding over Heaven. But Dean still feels — he doesn’t know. He’s got a lot to make up for with Cas about that. More than he ever really can.
She looks up at him fondly, eyes a little unfocused. “You’re a good son,” she says.
John laughs, too. He pulls a knife from his pocket and slices it, carelessly, across his arm; blood drips onto the tabletop. Next, he produces a flask, offering it to Dean to inspect. When Dean nods, he splashes its contents on the wound. “Satisfied?”
There’s dried blood on the shoulder of Dean’s jacket. On the back of the door.
Floss has her puppies on August 23rd, eight of them, black and white and brown and gold, with closed eyes and mewling little voices and eight pieces of Castiel’s heart. One is a runt, and sickly, and Cas and Dean sit together on the floor of Dean’s room around its nest of blankets and take turns feeding it Imodium-spiked formula from a bottle.
he said also, weight on the word that encapsulated all of Castiel’s failings.
“A crude device, but effective.” The point of the blade seems to dig harder under Castiel’s chin; Michael’s watching him, his face still. “Like you, it seems. When my counterpart sent you here in an effort to frustrate my designs, I thought he’d gone senile. I suppose he knew something, after all.”
Dean’s eyes slip to him.
Dean doesn’t see him. Castiel is invisible, still, a spot of silence on a bench that no one quite decides to sit on; he lets the crowd flow around him. When he sees Dean, he rises, stretches out a hand — but he hesitates before he lets it land on Dean’s shoulder.
“Some of these people have been screwed over by oil companies,” murmurs Ellen. “Lied to. Their lands polluted. Some of them have never touched the stuff, and swear they never will. Not many are in a position like mine.”
He doesn’t want to. He doesn’t want to, he doesn’t want to.
and let him figure it out,” Dean mutters.
“Okay,” he agrees.
They’re flags, Castiel realizes, with horror dawning in his chest.
It’s remarkable that Sam’s face can turn an even stranger color. “I, uh — yes, I guess. One-night things.”
They haven’t done that yet. It doesn’t matter. “Anything,” Cas whispers, into his lips. “Anything you want, I —”
He looks up. The girl with her hand on his arm is pretty in an anonymously blonde sort of way, and it takes him a minute to place her as Jo Harvelle.
It’s not gonna get any better, though. Not if he doesn’t do anything about it.
He hears Dean’s sharp intake of breath. “
Castiel nods his agreement, hitching his coat closer around his ears.
That makes Dean smile; a hint of a laugh tugs at the corner of his mouth. “Don’t worry. You’re always awkward.”
“Okay, says Claire loudly. She’s rising in her seat, leveling an accusing finger at Dean. “So what, you’re screwing some floozy? And you’re letting him?”
When the dust is fading behind her tires, Dean turns and quirks his eyebrows at Cas. “Well, that was awkward.”
He swallows the anxious questions that threaten to pour from his mouth:
when he unbuckles his belt and splits open his fly and works his jeans down over his hips and slips his fingers into the dense curls surrounding Castiel’s cock.
He looks oddly young like this, avoiding eye contact with his reflected self. Castiel watches him covertly as the floors tick by, and frets and tries to keep himself from fretting. It’s too much. It’s too different. Dean will want to leave.
He makes an undignified squawk when Dean pulls him off the counter, legs still locked around his back, but Dean’s bracing him, carrying him, and Castiel holds on for dear life. “Directions?” Dean asks politely, swaying just a little at the center of his entryway, and Castiel manages, “Straight back, second door on the left, don’t
“Okay, next question. Whose blood is that?”
Jack puts a hand on his shoulder.
He follows her, down through the corridors and into the garage. Baby gleams there, no longer half-boat — when Dean saw that Jack’s magic had affected her too, he made a noise Sam said sounded like a dying baby crow — but Mrs. Butters walks right past her. She indicates a staircase that Dean’s never noticed before.
Dean blinks.
“Hey, not like he wasn’t drinking way younger than this. Honestly, if you think about it —”
He doesn’t want to pressure Cas or anything; he doesn’t want to assume. So he lingers by the door when they walk in, watching Cas move across the room. He unknots his tie, skating it smoothly between two fingers, and Dean watches, helpless. He’s pretty sure he shouldn’t be this spellbound by the play of fabric in Cas’s hands, by the way it brushes the inside of his wrist.
His life has been a long one. It would be an interesting exercise, Castiel thinks, to see what pieces of it his consciousness might choose to present in these circumstances. Would he walk the streets of Babylon again? Would he watch that first wriggling fish crawl out onto land?
This one’s different.
“Yeah,” says Dean, still shaky. “It’s — a nice one, Cas.” After a moment, he continues, “I’m at the spot I took you that first day, on the hill. The river’s down a little. Can see everything from here.”
He transcribes one of Rowena’s monologues for Dean, doing his best to mimic her Scottish pronunciation. He clambers among the ice floes building up at his corner of the Bow and takes photos of the ones with the weirdest shapes. He sees a mink one day at dusk, like a large dark weasel, clambering among boulders at the river’s edge. He laughs when he looks at his photo of it later; the flash glaring off its eyes has turned it demonic, a small furry cryptid with dark water swirling at its back.
Maybe, just maybe, he’ll get to watch him from the other side of the Impala’s hood.
“Dean,” says Castiel again. Dean’s eyes are red.
“I suppose,” says Cas, and that’s a hint of wonder in his voice; “I suppose — your answer holds for me as well. But I do wish it hadn’t taken so many — iterations.”
“Dean,” he says, when he’s an arm length away. He’s surprised by how deep his voice comes out, how calm. “I’m sorry.”
the saddle, which he’s proud not to struggle with — it’s easier than it was at age six — though a small part of his brain notes Dean standing at the ready, should he need help, and feels tempted to falter.
“Shit,” says Dean. “Does that matter?”
it, he wants to —
”  snaps Ellen, voice ringing loud in the night, and Bobby’s rises in counterbalance, indistinct.
— then back to the new stuff,
Afterward, Castiel surges back up to kiss him, letting Dean taste himself in Castiel’s mouth, using his chest to press him against the tiles. He’s hard himself, can feel his dick pressing heavy against Dean’s hip, and Dean gasps into his mouth, “Want you to fuck me, Cas. Want you to fuck me so bad —”
He starts, a little reluctantly, to think about Alaska.
But the gears of his voice — of his thoughts — have ground into motion; the next words are easier. “Death came after us. She was already dying — she told us it wasn’t her, disappearing people. But she was gonna kill us. She, uh. She had us cornered, and Cas —”
“Hang on,” says Castiel desperately. “Don’t — please don’t tell anyone.”
tells you before he pops your arm in.”
Dean’s chest feels warm. He returns his gaze to the road. And he points his wheel toward home.
He can see why Dean likes these places.
“Dad,” starts Dean, “what —”
He says the last part with a hint of force. Castiel remembers that day in the bunker, years ago now, Dean soft with wonder:
“It wasn’t — it shouldn’t have happened. He said it would only happen — when he was happy, when he let the sun shine on his face. He
hot hand right now, Cody Traister, missed the top prize in last year’s CFR by only two points, and a lot of folks are saying he’s the man to beat this time around. We got a dream matchup here with this stallion, this is —” Castiel doesn’t quite catch the name — “earned a score of
Dean flips him off. “Shut up. Want more pancakes?”
It takes them several minutes to come down.
His hands are shaking, clenched into fists.
Dean’s hands slide, as if of their own accord, up Castiel’s thighs. “Kinda want to see you do it, now,” he breathes.
Cas looks at him. “Such as they are.”
Castiel tries to breathe. Is that better than he thought? Worse?
Incredulity flits across Dean’s face, followed by anger, but his expression smooths over almost instantly. “Yes, ma’am.”
Dean’s spun-thin, brittle. Castiel sees it in the hunch of his shoulders when he doesn’t think anyone is watching, in the way his eyes linger on small, meaningless things, cupboard corners, a dark scuff on the floor. At first, he thinks it’s the injury — the little trials of recovery, the pain.
“Christ. Of course I’d like it, Cas, you — are you sure?”
For a moment, the pressure on Castiel’s throat lessens. When he opens his eyes, he glimpses Dean, wrestling with Michael’s arms — his father, behind him, trying to pull him back. “We had a
Castiel frowns. “How did he follow us, though?” He’d thought the plan was a good one, even with the rain; he wouldn’t have proposed it if he thought it would fail. Michael’s hand on the town of Windom is evidence enough of how angels can hide in plain sight; what did Castiel get wrong?
Castiel’s beer suddenly seems less appealing. “I — should get home, thank you. Good luck with —”
the biggest one in the world, when he finished. But Cawker City kept going with theirs even after the guy who started it died, they just invited everyone to help, and — I dunno. They’re just — different.”
He marvels at the way his voice unhitches Dean from gravity, any gravity but Castiel —
Charlie is glancing between them like she’s watching a tennis match. “Well, this is adorable and a little creepy,” she comments. “But hunting’s more than shooting and punching, right? I mean, Sam, your little hunter academy — you’re the one who was always drilling everyone on —
When he sets the pizza boxes — they ordered two — down on the table, he glances awkwardly between them and Castiel.
“Do you love him?”
He’s still debating what to answer when she adds,
She shakes her head. “Asa screwed up his back a few years ago on a bull, and Bobby’s never gone in for that kind of thing, though he’d be a damn fine roper if he wanted to. It’s up to Dean and Jo to represent the ranch.” At Cas’s questioning look, she adds, “Most of the folks you’ve seen around today are just here to help out — takes a village and all that.”
Afterward, once Dean has shed his stained flannel with a good-natured joke about how it’s too warm for it out, anyway, and once Castiel has reclaimed his own shirt because he sort of disagrees, and once Dean has been appropriately shamed for the revelation that he brought bedrolls and blankets in the event they wound up spending the night, they curl up together to watch the fire. They start out side by side, both on their backs, but somehow Dean settles closer, then closer still, and winds up with his head propped half on Castiel’s chest.
“I see,” says Castiel.
“The house is underwater,” Eileen explains. Her hair is dripping; she grimaces and wrings it out. “But the inside is dry. I never expected sharks outside my windows.”
Then she’s straightening, reciting with confidence. “
“Dinner,” Castiel repeats, keeping a mental list. “Dancing. What after the dancing?”
for this chapter! Go check it out and tell them how amazing it is. :D
Cas sits back. He looks a little startled at the question, like he’s never thought about being
If Dean’s attention wanders, he doesn’t show it, just asks, “It’s five years, right? A Ph.D.?”
they can stay on!”
If Jack is right, though, about what he’s becoming — if Sam’s right about what it means — then maybe, soon,
Dean scowls at him. “Make a wish!” Jack commands.
But Castiel just nods. He isn’t going to challenge Dean on this; not today.
Dean — it’s just that, from everything he knows of himself, he should be more likely to spend those eight seconds biting his fingernails with worry; the impulse he suppresses should be to squeeze his eyes tight shut, not to leap from his seat and whoop for the entire stadium to hear. And yet here he is, still flushed and triumphant, blood still buzzing with the exhilarating image of Dean whirling on the back of a wild bay mare, even after hours have passed, and the rest of the evening’s events, and Dean’s watching him with cool amusement from his seat in the hotel room’s only chair.
“Like really fucked up,” Dean adds, “like maybe PTSD fucked up, I dunno, but —” He draws in a deep, spasming breath, and grits out his next words like he’s setting down stones, one at a time, clumsy. “I thought I could keep that away from you, and I
Claire’s in their room when they get back, perched across the armchair with her ankles crossed, flipping through a pamphlet of activities.
he murmurs into Castiel’s skin, and Castiel holds him tighter — doesn’t let go.
— that she never had the chance to see.
Walking back, at the middle of the bridge, he has to stop for a moment and close his eyes. His lungs feel tight; they can’t expand. The river is bright in the sun.
“It can’t take me while you’re not there,” Cas says softly. “My happiness lives where you are.”
He fumbles it out of his pocket without looking. “Hello?”
“That’s gonna be hard,” Dean says, quietly. “They’re gonna — it’ll take a long time to make sense of what happened to them. Probably most of them never will.”
It does, though; McKenzie wouldn’t have lingered there, wouldn’t be defending it if it didn’t. “Would you want me to fix it up?” Dean asks. “Like I’m doing here?”
ICYMI: check out
Cas’s arms tighten again. “If he does,” he says after a moment, “he remembers that you didn’t.”
Castiel lets the words sink in. He can picture it: a teenage Dean scolding a much smaller version of the floppy-haired Sam Winchester to put on his seatbelt.
It doesn’t matter, really. He’s asked since then. He’ll keep asking, as long as Cas lets him — and Cas keeps letting him. It feels like it gets easier every time.
Dean hadn’t realized it was coming this fast. They’ve only got a few hours of retreat left — the final
“Going on a trip?” the sales associate asks brightly. “That’s one of our best travel models, it’s shock- and water-resistant. Great choice.”
Castiel chances a sidelong look as he drives. Dean’s hands are twisting in his lap. “You don’t need to do anything differently,” he says, “you’re perfect,” but Dean only frowns and looks away.
Dean isn’t sure how to process that last part, but Cas is smiling, and so Dean does too. “But, so, like. You know things about me. And I get that. Like, things I didn’t have to tell you — and probably some things I never
His face is lit up with laughing. He’s been drinking; they both have, movements a little loose. Amelia’s in a dress, a strappy, backless one, and when Jimmy leans to kiss her bare shoulder she laughs and squirms away. “Jimmy, we can’t — my mom will be here soon with Claire —”
They talk through everything else they can think of.
“Yeah, well,” Dean interrupts. “You weren’t there to see me when Lucifer killed you.”
He wishes he could stay.
The next word comes out as a muffled grunt of surprise as Dean’s mouth covers his own.
If Castiel had been asked a thousand years ago, two thousand, he wouldn’t have guessed Kansas.
“Fuck,” breathes Castiel, “fuck fuck fuck fuck
and say
And the names from that retreat are infuriatingly generic. Henry Green. John Lewis. Daniel Savoy. They can rule out a few, at least, but most of them could be any of a dozen or more kids in the country.
Jo takes it upon herself to guide him there, though not before Dean finds him in the chaos of the arena exits, claps a hand on his shoulder, thumb brushing Castiel’s hairline and doing strange things to his heart, and shouts, “You’re coming, right?” directly in Castiel’s ear.
“Very well.” Castiel can always go find Dean later; he can always trail them unseen. For now — “Remember. If you need me — pray.”
Whoops and cheers punctuate the round of applause, but the crowd hushes as Clayton continues, voice dropping low. “Let’s set this up for you, folks. Let’s remind you what happened two years ago this weekend, in this arena, on this very horse — when young Dean here took the rodeo world by storm. Posted a ninety-one point five, won the night, and he didn’t stop winning. This young man out of Lawrence, Kansas — but he’s practically a native son by now, Ellen, wouldn’t you say? — hit the finals ranked second in nation. Out of nowhere and straight to the top, a Cinderella story if I ever heard one — but he never made it to the ball.”
Castiel can’t explain the prickle of unease that spreads down his wings; he has heard, vaguely, of Dean Winchester’s father. Also in Hell. Cut from the same cloth — or maybe not
He doesn’t want to die. He wants Cas.
“Yeah,” he says. “Yeah, that’ll work.”
But Castiel doesn’t quite want to reveal all of his abilities. “My directive —”
He turns away to clatter in the drawers, finding the candles, a matchbook. Dean in leans close to Castiel. He asks, in an undertone, “You knew about this?”
Gabriel and Kali have already plated it in individual servings, Castiel knows; they also brought a blowtorch for the “final caramelization.” But since the last time Castiel saw it, something’s happened to the marshmallow meringue.
“Jesus, Cas, calm down. I went at night. No one saw me. Are you — are you all right?”
Castiel hadn’t realized he’d made Dean uncomfortable. “I have a hard time imagining that that was a pleasant experience,” he admits.
It might be the last thing he has of Cas. The last thing — ever. He almost doesn’t dare reach out and fold the knife closed again — tuck it back in the pocket where it belongs.
Michael frowns. He holds out a hand, stopping John Winchester where he stands. He raises the other and looks down at it, considering; then he coughs, once, and spits a bloody bullet into the palm of his hand.
Castiel feels uneasy. He has never questioned an archangel before. But he looks down at the body before him, and what he feels is disgust. Not for the man in his suffering, no; for anyone who would do this, and then leave him to die alone.
“I was worried about my vessel,” Castiel answers, honest. The question feels like a distraction. “It has become evident to me that I feel deeply opposed to the idea of your possession; it was cowardly not to address my own. But when I attempted to return Jimmy’s body to him, he wasn’t there.” He tilts his head. The term
“Where did it happen?” he asks softly, and Dean starts, but then moves without hesitating, his movements jerky.
then presses his finger, in one steady movement, inside.
Then suddenly he looks stricken. He looks over at Castiel. “Not that — I’m ashamed of — or —”
“I’d like you to tell Ellen and Bobby,” he says, slowly, instead.
Dean’s pupils are blown wide. What would he do if Castiel dove two fingers past his lips? Would he open for them, suck on them, beg for more? What would he do if Castiel squeezed the skin at the back of his neck and told him to kneel?
It takes all the resolve Dean has to stay with Thomas and Laura instead of going after Cas.
He barely has a hand on it, yanking it open, before Castiel’s grace catches up; he slams the door shut. Dean wrenches at the knob uselessly. Once, again. “Let me
But Dean’s shaking his head. “I wouldn’t.” His voice comes out rough, but sure. “Not — if it means I don’t wind up where I am. Who I am. I’m pretty okay with me.”
Dean shivers. He never can help himself, with Cas standing this close; with Cas looking at him like that.
For a long moment, Cas doesn’t answer.
and about Cas looking embarrassed and introducing his friend, Dean.
He sort of runs out after that. He’s raised two kids, he guesses, kind of, and he’s stood executioner over both of them; he’s put them both on their knees.
When Castiel pulls into the Walking L the next morning, he’s wearing a brand new pair of work jeans — which is stupid, he already has field pants, he’s a geologist for God’s sake, but Jo psyched him out and nothing he had seemed right — and his favorite blue button-down, the one that’s sturdy and comfortable and a bit too worn from overuse to keep in the workday rotation. It’s eight o’clock on the dot, because while Castiel wavered back and forth on what exactly “early” might mean, once decided, he is nothing if not punctual.
And Castiel is laughing too. Dean’s hand is on his shoulder — “Come on, let’s get out of here, Baby’s in the garage. Before anyone else shows up to ask what the hell we’re doing.” And they’re stumbling, still laughing, down the corridors, making good their escape.
right?”
Dean arches and
She stands quietly as he approaches her, offers a treat bare-handed to feel the whuff of warm air across his palm.
He’s never chosen it before.
He writes,
Dean’s eyes widen. Ellen’s a notoriously angry shopper; Bobby usually drives into Claresholm for whatever they need from the supermarket and the UFA farm supply. Yesterday, though, Ellen’s last pair of her favorite work jeans bit the dust. That means
” and buries his face hot in Castiel’s neck. He kisses his way down his chest, and Castiel looks because he can’t help himself — sees his own skin flushed pink and shining where Dean’s mouth has been, the color high on his cheekbones, his hair dark and messy. He looks
Song for today is
“You know,” he murmurs. “Something we forgot. At IKEA. Another pillow for the bed.”
Then, abruptly, his shoulders go still; after a moment, they sag. When he turns to face Castiel, his eyes are glittering with fury and defeat. “You’re not gonna. Are you.”
Cas frowns without quite meeting his eyes. “Of course. I just — you seemed to wish to talk to those other couples more than me. I’m sorry if I got in the way of that.”
Worry clenches in Castiel’s chest. “Do you like it? I can heal it, if you don’t want —”
Castiel feels, absurdly, that it’s a good thing Dean asked him to wait; that he needs an anchor for this walk across the yard. That a light breeze might blow him away.
to be intact — he and Cas have a separate, modern well for their water — but he figures it’ll look better that way.
Then it’s time for dinner, and one more reunion with Claire. She spends most of the meal glancing between them and cackling wickedly, until Dean finally snaps and demands, “Okay, so, what — you knew this was coming? Because
The simplest solution — as far as Castiel is concerned — is to sit in the Impala’s front seat, invisible. He thinks Dean might not like that, so he doesn’t tell him.
“Dean, if you don’t want me to have to erase the memories of all the other parents —”
Again, Dean shakes his head. “I just — knew.”
He stops again. Castiel kisses his shoulder, the mark there, the heart of his own palm, and Dean shivers. “Maybe,” he concedes, after a while. Then, with a strain on his voice: “You’d come with me?”
“How can the world have four biggest balls of twine?” Castiel frowns. “And why are they all located in the American Midwest?”
He lets his mind wander as he breathes in the caffeine steam.
Cas puts a hand on the wall to catch his balance, and suddenly Dean’s aware of his own body — his hair, mussed and damp, his robe hanging loose at his sides. The way his t-shirt clings to his chest; the heat of the shower steam still rising off his skin.
He looks like he always does, tan trenchcoat, white shirt, blue tie, but for some reason it takes Dean’s breath away. He keeps catching himself reacting to Cas like this, ever since their date; like it’s almost too much to believe he’s
It still looks dirty from Saturday, and he smiles fondly at it for a moment, remembering the plume of dust that followed him down the Walking L’s driveway. Shaking his head, he opens the door, deposits his laptop bag in the passenger seat, and starts the ignition.
“He will do,” he answers carefully, “anything in his power to change your mind. He will do — things that you and I can’t imagine.”
Castiel laughs. “So are you. Guess we’d both better start believing it.”
And then — he’s pretty sure that if he says all that, Sam’s gonna ask him how
“I’ve heard it said that you should not ‘put out’ until the third date. What does that mean?”
Dean guesses the answer is no.
No one’s ever asked Dean to tell them about Cas before.
“Hey,” he says. “You down to ride Esmeralda? Help us round ‘em up? Asa says he thinks you’re good for it.”
Getting Cas back would be worth that. Getting everyone back. Even if Dean wasn’t around to say — to say —
Castiel flips him off stickily, and Dean moves as if to catch his hand in his own. He abruptly aborts the gesture as a voice calls from the other side of the bar, “Hey Winchester, there you are!”
He thinks about his occasional searches of academic job boards. About the life he sometimes lets himself dream about. About having an office at the core storage lab, or down the hall from Rowena; about losing himself in the mysteries of deep time.
“Yes.” Cas answers the question easily, and Dean has to fight down a shiver, fold his fingers carefully over his knees.
Dean squints against the glare off the buildings of the low evening sun. It’s nearly the solstice; the sun doesn’t set here until nearly ten in the evening. “Gonna have to find a place to park.”
being tadpoles. Or pollyfrogs, or whatever it is Jack’s calling them this year. None seem to have sustained any permanent injury from hopping so excitedly they bounced off the walls. There’s a chance Dean might have cracked a rib from laughing, but, well — as tempted as Castiel is to let him suffer for being unhelpful, he won’t. Dean tells him he’s a soft touch.
Dean steps free of his underwear. He’s standing there now, wholly revealed, face flushed bright in the firelight, and Cas almost wants to see how long he’ll wait there for him, how deep a blush will stain his cheeks, but instead he says, “Come here,” and when Dean does, he pulls him down for a kiss.
“I won’t argue with that,” Castiel agrees. “What prompted all this?”
Dean’s saying,
Dean’s hands shake harder. The phone slips out of them and falls to the floor, and he doesn’t retrieve it.
how bad you wanted to see it, but you had this whole thing about dogs.”
When he steps outside, he can hear that it’s running, engine purring low. The windows are open, and out of them thuds the sound of rock music: AC/DC, Castiel thinks.

There’s an ache behind his sternum. It kind of matches the one between his legs.
Dean leaves him a little awkwardly at the rodeo grounds, hesitating for a moment as if he’d like to walk Castiel to his seat, or reach out to touch his hand in farewell. He doesn’t, though, just vanishes to wherever he goes to gear up and get ready to ride, leaving Castiel to his thoughts.
Then something settles in him — some understanding, dropping into place. “He’s a bargaining chip. Right?” His spine is straight, his voice hard. “Adam. Michael nabbed him, and then he gave you a choice.”
Castiel gives him a look. He hopes it conveys equal measures of
Castiel can’t find his voice. He knew Dean was attractive; knew he had swagger and skill and a past and a love of this place. He didn’t know how Dean would look when he reunited a mother cow with her calf. He didn’t know that the sight would make his own soul sigh with gratitude and contentment, whispering something dangerously close to
there. I’d be spending the money anyway to come down to Houston — it’s just the other way around.”
Castiel returns it, a little startled; her arms are warm and firm around his back. “Well,” she says when she draws back. “I can see why he likes you so much. Come in, come in, don’t let the cold in! Dean’s just eating breakfast.”
“I did a little Googling,” he admits, after a moment. His voice is even, suddenly, if scraped hollow. “When you were at work. I took it off your browser history, after. About PTSD.”
“Do you believe that?” Mia asks softly.
Cas shoots him a stern look, then gentles as he turns back to the kid. “Jack. We know that you only wanted to do a good thing. But we need to ask you to put Henry back where you found him.”
“You’ve been here in the past?”
It’s the first time he’s ever said it out loud.
They both jump. And then Dean is laughing; he can’t help himself. He ducks his head to Cas’s shoulder, bumps his cheekbone against the hard nub of Cas’s collarbone, and Cas’s hand rises easily to cup his jaw. His thumb strokes once over Dean’s stubble, idle, and then he says, “The Empty was wrong.”
Castiel glances around. “How did it happen?”
Dean glances around, as if he’s just now taking in his surroundings, recognizing Missouri’s kitchen. “I dunno. I was twelve, maybe? A long time. She, uh — I wouldn’t have bugged her, but she called me. Pastor Jim gave her my number, I guess.”
Castiel’s drawing in breath for a retort, but it catches in his throat, a surprised laugh. “‘Fiddle-de-dee’?”
Were they looking for Dean?
He means to go to bed early, but first he offers Charlie a drink and then she’s explaining the twist in a new game she’s designing and then they’re booting it up on Castiel’s own computer to see. Dean leans comfortably against the back of his chair and finishes his beer and then kisses Castiel’s forehead and murmurs that he’s going to bed, and Castiel feels his whole being flush with happiness, and Charlie’s eyes warm on his face.
He disturbs the covers as little as possible when he goes back to bed. Slides carefully between the sheets, flat on his back, just far enough that he’s not falling off the edge.
