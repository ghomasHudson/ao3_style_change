John leaned over his desk and tried to take in deep, even breaths. Slow and steady. Count in, hold, and out two-three-four. Deep breathing was not going to stop the swell of guilt that covered his body in shivers and coated his stomach in nausea. Guilt because he couldn’t save either of them. Guilt because he knew he would’ve saved Sherlock if he’d been given any kind of choice. Guilt because he was a doctor and a soldier, God dammit, and what was the point of being either if in the end he’d watched two brilliant people be snuffed out right before his eyes. Time was shit. Ella was shit. Life was shit.

John had wandered closer than usual after the concert, looking at the paper near the door to see the next date and time. He glanced up at the man that stood in the doorway.
head if I tried to charge you, anyway, wouldn’t she?”
a lie.
There was an archway that was very easy to miss behind the bar. In fact, it seemed to imply it was for staff only and that no one was meant to be back there. It was beyond this dark archway that Mettie was leading Sigerson, and Henri tutted as they watched him walk away.
The red dot was a burning spike into John’s heart. Moran’s aim had, apparently, improved over the centuries. John winced, but he was more concerned about Sherlock. The idiot was being impossibly calm. Smug, even.
“I just might surprise you,” John said, but he was grinning. He could tell the other man was smiling, too. “I’m John, by the way. John Watson.”
Then he remembered his lack of clothing.
fun. He pushed himself up and headed towards his bedchamber, loosening his cravat and buttons as he went. He paused by the looking glass, with his fingers running thoughtfully and delicately along his jaw. His lips were well and truly stained with wine and he contemplated the pretty red color.
Being shot was strange.
After a brief tour of the house, Bill dragged him out on the back porch with two beers. They settled in a pair of lawn chairs, chatting and catching up.
“I’m sorry?” John asked, brows knitting together. He blinked up at the guy. “Who?”
“We are summoning a
John’s stomach interrupted the awkward silence as he floundered with what to say to this brilliant, talented man. He grinned sheepishly. “I guess I should probably eat something. That sandwich was a long time ago.”
“You won’t be back tomorrow. You work, at a job you don’t particularly care for although,” the man arched an eyebrow as he mysteriously saw something else on John that alerted him to more facts about John’s boring existence, “not as much as you did before the pandemic. Interesting. You enjoy danger. You must have been an excellent soldier.”
“Oh, no, sir. I was just wonderin’ if you’d be needing anything else, sir,” she replied with a sweet smile that definitely implied a familiarity with her employer’s moods. Cheeky little creature.
“Dr. Watson?” the receptionist called tentatively through his office door, rapping on the solid, heavy fiberglass panel. It was an ugly, spotted green color that matched the office’s old early nineties decor. If he’d had his own practice, he’d have updated long ago but being in with a group meant a lot of talking and very little actually getting done about anything.
“No, I bet you’d have been the Mrs. in that equation, going by your blog posts,” Bill said, shoving at John’s shoulder. John’s lips broke into a real smile and he shoved back gently.
Her eyes had rolled back and they were glowing with a yellow light. Her head was pressing down against the back of her shoulders and her mouth gaped, a black hole in the flickering light. Noises escaped her that sounded like choking.
for this today. His cane tapped away as he walked, with every click punctuating a word as he replayed the hideous conversation he’d been subjected to.
“Trudy’s dead, John.”
“But I probably will. I love hearing you play,” John told him, stifling another yawn. Sherlock’s expression went funny, and John couldn’t figure out what he said that pleased the detective so well.
The sender of the last message was a welcome change. Bill Murray. John frowned, staring down at the name before opening the message to read what his old army friend had to say. There had been a time when they’d been as thick as thieves and Bill had even saved John’s life, but that was years ago. Last he’d heard, Bill and his new wife Trudy had settled somewhere in bum-fuck Maryland near one of the bases.

“No, no, no, Violet. No more of this Spiritualist bunk, I beg of you,” John said. He turned from her and picked up his medical bag from where it rested next to the door, sitting it on top of a bench that decorated the front hall. He opened the bag, checking to make sure that all of his supplies were in order.
quite closely to ‘Sigerson’ call him by someone else’s name on more than one occasion.
Sherlock leaned against the door, staring at John with that same intense gaze he’d had at their first meeting. “Dull. I’d much rather know about your dead friend.”
“No. Just no. Go away. I want nothing more to do with you,” John snapped. “You were working for a psychopath who killed my best friend with his bare hands. I watched you bleed out- what was that even for, was that a sniper or why- I just, I just can’t anymore. Go away. I don’t want to talk to you.”
His day was soured by his mood, although he had to admit that the patients themselves were relatively docile and routine. The weather outside had the blasted audacity to be
He picked up the laptop and padded over to the tiny kitchenette and propped Sherlock up on the worktop. He couldn’t remember a time when he had a real kitchen in his home, as he’d been in the army and then here, and he usually didn’t miss having the space but now that he was trying to squeeze a laptop in while he was cooking he realized he could do with a bit more room. Sherlock watched him the entire time, talking about the cold cases he’d been solving. It was a bit domestic, really, and it felt nice. With his beans smothering a perfectly toasted piece of bread, he juggled the laptop and the plate and went back to his bed.
(See the end of the chapter for
John’s lips tilted upwards. As he was alone in his office, he’d slipped the mask off and the air against his skin was nice. Was the violinist flirting with him? It seemed that way. [Looks intimately done. I’ve got patients. I’ll txt you ltr.]
“I’m not- I erm, I don’t know what I am. I haven’t known him long,” John said, feeling awkward. He wondered how the Hell Sherlock even knew where he was. Silver Hair gave him a sympathetic smile and answered his thought, which he’d apparently spoken out loud without realizing it.
“I’ve told you to stop doing that!” barked one of the men working behind the bar. He was a gargantuan blonde man and he was glaring daggers at the back of Mettie’s head. She shrugged.
He wasn’t proud of himself for venturing out the night before. Thankfully, Violet kept a close grip on John’s chequebook as well as their finances and she was used to him being tempted into playing cards when he was in a foul enough temper to lose everything they had. As it was, he had a wretched hangover and he just didn’t have time for a lecture regarding Spiritualism at this hour of the morning.
[If you want to hear how the case ended, you’ll zoom? - SH]
It was soothing and sweet, but it was missing something. That is, until a high soprano voice began singing along with it. Just as John was sure that Sherlock was playing along with a recording, the woman singing leaned against the window, framing her slender body. She wore only a pair of expensive-looking boxer shorts and a misbuttoned, very familiar purple shirt.
Sherlock paused, considering this idea. He turned to look at John, eyes roving from head to toe and back again, reading him like a book. “I suppose that couldn’t hurt.”
“Sherlock,” the man- policeman, probably- was telling him. “He doesn’t call in favors for just anyone. Or are you not Doctor John Watson?”
“Sure,” John agreed easily, ready for the previous conversation to be over. He tipped the remainder of his beer into his mouth, swallowing hard. “Is Trudy coming home soon? Should we wait for her?”
John did feel a bit like a fool.
“John, if I could-” Mary started, twisting in her seat to watch him as he walked away. He held up his hands.
“Damn your circle,” John swore, but the hands gripping his prevented him from moving. “Stop this instant!” He looked down and, with horror, realized the breast pocket of his jacket was glowing with a similar light to Violet’s eyes.
“Just one little favor, John, that’s all I’ll ask in return. And your loyalty to the cause, of course,” James was telling him. It was hard to focus on the angel’s face, but he did.
The cane returned to his hand and the gentleman he’d collided with during his distracted wandering was sent off, unfortunately with a minor curse that would give the next several generations in his line very hairy toes, but honestly, the man deserved it and should’ve been watching out for irrational, irritated demons. Demons whose best friends were stupid angels who couldn’t wrap their bloody brains around the fact that their demon best friend-
Thanks for reading!
“Piss off,” Sherlock chuckled. John grinned. God, Sherlock was like something out of a dream. Like John, he seemed to only have one lamp on, casting him in shadows and mystery, but his pale skin still stood out. John couldn’t make out too many details of the shirt that he was wearing except that it seemed to be a dark, rich purple and it was so perfectly snug it practically screamed sex.
“Who died?” John asked before he could remember social tact and rephrase the question. “You never mentioned anyone being sick, I mean.”
“I was about to come back now. I lost track of time,” John said, feeling embarrassed that he’d ditched his friend for so long. “I’m sorry about earlier. I just- I had a rough night. You know how the nightmares can be.”
The bar where they ended up was a short walk from Bill’s house. It was on a busy main street in the small town, taking up the entirety of a huge, antique building. There were four floors, all home to some aspect of the restaurant, and John pitied their servers just a little bit as they traipsed up and down the steep flights of stairs with their heavy trays of food.
“My love,” she began in a very condescending tone, indeed. It made him almost proud of her. “Spiritualism is a valid system of beliefs that many of the best scholars follow. Have you not been listening during the lectures we’ve attended?”
“I’m glad you came, John,” Bill said, patting him on the back as they hugged goodbye the next morning. “Keep in touch. I’ll email you more, or something.”
“Oh, John!”
“You’ll have to forgive my associate. He is always disagreeable, especially when he is working. I do not mind philosophy or poetry in the least. I’m sure we appreciate any assistance you might be able to give,” Fell said, patting the hand that gripped his arm still. The artist beamed at him.
John’s heart thundered in his chest as he turned to his wife. The voice coming out of her was not Violet’s, not in the least. It was deeper and more harsh, gravelly in tone. “H-Holmes?”
John deleted the message and threw his phone back on the table with a loud clack. He pressed his eyes shut once more, attempting to sleep in the unfamiliar room.
It had been so long since John saw his own fiendish face that he wasn’t sure what it looked like anymore. He only knew his tarnished feathers. “Sherlock- I-”
Life with such a person would probably never be boring, that was for sure. It wouldn’t be beige. It would be ugly wallpaper and bullet holes. It might even be dangerous. John’s brain (and, let’s be honest, several parts of his body) were attracted to that idea. Having a … friend like that. Perhaps not in the way that Bill had been his friend, but
One of my favorite quotes from Holmes is “They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.” As I've moved from Philly to rural MD, where this fic is set, I have to say I agree with Holmes more often than not so I borrowed the sentiment.
“Conspiring with the enemy, are you?” he asked. Miss Addington giggled and started to pull her coat on. Of course, it was probably very unprofessional, indeed, to call his own wife his enemy in front of his surgery staff, but the tensions in the house had been high almost since the moment they’d said ‘I Do’, so poor Miss Addington was used to it by now.
,” Billy continued, putting an emphasis on words that made John uncomfortable. Holmes and he had never been forward with each other while in Baker Street and he didn’t know how Billy had leapt to that particular conclusion.
“Beans it is, then,” John said, laughing when Sherlock appeared to grimace. “You would be a picky eater, wouldn’t you.”
“There are many things about me that would shock you as well, Holmes. And I don’t need you defending my honor, although I do appreciate it. I’m not your damsel, Holmes,” John joked, wondering if he was imagining the shift the conversation was taking. Holmes had abandoned his pipe and he was slipping himself off of the top of the chair to land softly in the seat. He inched forward as well, watching John’s face.
“Aces!” she said, and he winced at her old-fashioned choice of slang. “Drop me in Baltimore on your way up ninety-five. I’ve got a person to see about a werewolf.”
“You wish I’d offended you but secretly you’re impressed,” Sherlock said to him after an awkward moment of silence. “You should really fire your therapist, if she really thought a group would help someone with your temperament. Did you love him?”
Henri continued his monologue as if they were listening, leading them inside a large cabaret that boasted a red windmill over the entrance. Large, colorful posters greeted them as they entered, advertising different performers and acts.
Before he could say something peevish back to her, she was already dancing down the hallway, chattering to herself about plans for the party. John huffed and put on his hat, snatched up his bag, and started out to his office.
“Load of bollocks,” John swore under his breath, causing the lady to his right to gasp. Violet gave his arm a hard yank.
“I would hope not,” Sherlock said. “The wound on your shoulder is quite impressive.”
He was going to need to go grocery shopping.
to listen that night when, under the cover of darkness, Sigerson had wept softly in his room. Of course, Fell had been listening! It was merely sometimes the actual facts of the case became a little muddled when there was so much else to hear.
“Well, well, well, Sebby. You’ve taken down one of their soldiers.” The oily voice belonging to the ex-angel known as James was heard before his body materialized. Dripping upwards from the cloud, a slick black substance formed itself into a humanoid shape before solidifying into the demon himself, pointed horns piercing slick, greasy obsidian hair that was otherwise perfectly coiffed. His eyes were solidly as black as pitch that hadn’t been invented yet. John groaned, wanting to spit at him.
“I know, I know, that’s not- that’s, um. Okay, so I wasn’t thinking about that when I invited him, it just slipped out,” Bill replied. John could hear the sounds of a chair scuffing against the floor and then the familiar ritualistic sounds of coffee being made. Someone was filling the carafe with water from the sink and pouring it into the reservoir. Soon, the inviting scent of coffee was wafting through the house, making John’s mouth water just a little.
On the dim streets of Paris, where heeled boots and carriage wheels echoed and the setting sun cast long shadows where temptations could linger, a tall, thin man in dark clothing walked, accompanied by a stout fellow in white clothes. They were a study in night and day. The shorter of the two men had pale, white-blonde hair and, despite being under orders not to draw attention to himself, he was attired in a pale suit that was several years out of fashion and more than a little shabby. His blonde hair fluffed up like a halo around his round face. As he spoke, his hands were wringing together in a worried frenzy.
Blast!
“Shall we take this conversation somewhere more private, monsieur?” Mettie asked, shifting her shoulders so that her cleavage seemed more appetizing. Henri elbowed Fell, excited by the chemistry forming between Sigerson and the girl.
“Oh, I only had a favor to ask of you. It shan’t be but a moment of your time,” Violet promised.
“Ehm, yes, I’ve been told. Still acts up when I don’t want it to,” John replied, feeling the heat of an embarrassed blush spreading over his cheeks. The man continued to stare at him.
“I can’t. I cannot do this,” John stated firmly, and he stood, forgetting his coffee or even where he was. “You have raised more questions than you’ve answered.”
Siegerson paused, eyeing her warily, vaguely impressed at her guess. “I confess you are correct.”
Wars made it slightly more interesting, at least. Influencing people was easy and if it annoyed his former comrades when he tilted the scales in favor of the less deserving, well, he was a demon after all. Watching the humans kill each other, healing them when they were hurt, it broke up the monotony. He wasn’t great at being evil. There was some kind of moral dilemma where he couldn’t bring himself to do anything truly horrible. Temptations, though. He was a great tempter. And if he got an orgasm out of it, well, that was just icing on the demonic cake.
or on my
“Yes, yes, of course, Saint John,” Violet said, waving her hands at him. She was already lost in the glee of being allowed to have her party. “Best of husbands. Run along, now, Dr. Watson. It wouldn't do to keep your patients waiting!”
“We’ve got something for everyone in Paris, gentlemen. Allow me to introduce myself. I am the painter Henri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec Monfa,” the man said, reaching into his jacket pocket with his free hand, leaning harder on Fell. He could smell the scent of alcohol wafting up and he winced at it. Henri withdrew his card from his pocket and held it aloft for Sigerson to pluck out of his fingers.
Out of tea.
“I’d have thought you’d be ever so glad to see your

Rest and relaxation were all well and good except when they gave John too much time to wish that things had been different. Some ghosts just never really leave.
John took the bag before backing away again to make sure he maintained the six feet between them. Inside were a dozen or so colorful fabric masks, some of which were in the same fabric as Sherlock’s. John grinned. “Thank you. Can I give you some money for them?”
John followed along while Bill prattled on about the best places to buy pho in town, noticing that, at the very least, the man seemed lighter having gotten his secret off of his chest. It still didn’t explain how he’d heard Trudy’s voice earlier that morning, or how that voice had known what he and Bill talked about, but Mary’s reappearance made him want to not examine things too closely. That night, after more food and several more beers and maybe even one naughty cigarette bummed off a townie who was smoking outside of one of the bars that evening, John slept without any nightmares for the first time since his friend’s death.
“Woman, be silent!” John snapped, pulling once more at the stranger holding his right hand. Suddenly, the table stopped it’s infernal wiggling and the flames of the candles leapt high before burning completely out. There were several screams and a few crashing sounds before John heard the sound of the front door opening as their dinner guests scattered.
“Are you off to the office, my love?” she asked, her hand resting sweetly on his arm. John nodded, and lifted her hand from his sleeve so that he could reach for his hat.
Nothing, nothing in all of creation, compared to the moment that James hacked off his wings.
groan and he allowed his eyes to roll upwards in frustration.
“I hope you didn’t want to eat that,” Sherlock said. John grinned, hanging his head for a moment before looking back at Sherlock.
handle a small trip to Mrs. Hudson’s, he was sure of it. Enough time had passed. It was probably even a little healthy for him to visit the old place, come to think of it. It would be a way of… of putting the past to rest, so to speak, and perhaps it might even lessen his grief. Sher-
John considered that for a moment. He’d already come to the conclusion that the man was teleworking or self-employed, given the fact that he had the time in his schedule to put on street concerts whenever he wished, but other than that John had no idea what he did or why he was texting photographs of a corpse to someone he’d only just met. John also had no clue as to what caused the kinky looking marks on the man in the photos. Mid-thirties, dark hair, solidly built but other than that the photos were abysmal. The bruising ran in crossing patterns over his back. They didn’t appear to be the cause of death, however, and John knew that if he gave that answer, it would probably be the end of the conversation. He decided to stall.
“Hey mister, you going my way?” she asked, winking at him. He huffed, but hit the unlock button.
Fell’s heart clenched in his chest, and a quick glance at Sigerson showed that he’d noticed the slight twist of his expression. Oh, but he missed his own red-haired curse.
“The case? I’ve solved it. Now, we wait for the next call. Come on,” Sherlock said, spinning on his heel and leaving John to follow. Which John would. Always.
are you here?”
“Were you ever able to contact your BDSM expert?” he teased around a forkful of beans. He’d propped the laptop against a pillow to give Sherlock some height and he sat with his back against the wall, his legs crossed.
“Behave, brute!” she scolded, but she led Sigerson away with a friendly smile.
Unfortunately for Sherlock, this also meant that the visitor, whose considerably large brain and bulging eyes processed as much as his own, had ample opportunity to leave a little gift behind without him being aware of it. After the item had been placed, Professor Moriarty cleared his throat, alerting Sherlock of his presence and giving the cue to their final battle. Or so it would seem.
“Oh Good Lord,” Fell muttered, and he picked up his own drink. Henri cackled.
John shook himself out of his daydreams, realizing that his young secretary was standing in the doorway to his office, calling his name.
He’d just about drifted off when his eyes snapped open.
[It’s for my Work. - SH]
He was not surprised that Bill’s next sentence was, “Do you want to talk about it?”
Chapter Warnings: Some violence and mentions of whipping a dilly-boy/rent boy (OFF SCREEN). Creepy séance type occult things. Mentions of prostitution, sex work, blood, non-con and homophobia but hopefully I handled it in an appropriate manner. ALSO: Loads of historical inaccuracies, but I’m trying my best.
“Don’t worry, time heals all wounds.” John hissed involuntarily at that one. Would people ever stop saying that?
“A philosopher as well as an artist. How lucky we are,” Sigerson drawled. Fell glared at him before smiling kindly down at Henri, whose handsome face was bathed in red light from the nearby cabaret.
“Neither are women, sir, and it’s good you haven’t had experience with them, for your sake. You’ve got a kind face, sir. I’d love to paint you,” Henri said. An embarrassed but pleased flush crept over Fell’s round cheeks.
“I regret, I have not, however you may be of some use to us,” Sigerson told him. Fell squawked, unwilling to break away from his new friend as he had a strong suspicion the man was entirely drunk and needed the assistance but also not wanting any more distractions from the case. Sigerson smirked at him. “We are seeking a female artist, someone who is very good at copies. Perhaps you know of a few ladies that fit that description, Monsieur Toulouse-Lautrec?”
“Of course not! This is your weekend,” Bill replied amiably, but his eyes wouldn’t meet John’s, leaving the doctor feeling a little suspicious. “I’ll putter around here for a while and we’ll meet back up for lunch, maybe?”
But she wasn’t there. Bill sat at the small kitchen table, blinking at John in surprise. There was no Trudy, no coffee waiting for the slightly hungover doctor, and the room seemed awfully cold. Bill cleared his throat. “Johnny, I didn’t hear you get up. I was waiting to see if you wanted to go for breakfast.”
“No, no. At least, I don’t think so,” John replied. He shrugged. “Although, I’m starting to think that you never really know what’s going to come next with Sherlock Holmes.”
“Does everyone call you Gideon?” he asked sarcastically. Judgement was firm in his tone and the young man could hear it.
“Tsk, tssssk,” James hissed gleefully. He crouched down next to John, solid black eyes gazing at him with interest. The pointed bones where James’ wings had once been stuck out behind him, singed from Hellfire and dark as night. “I could make it all better, John. You just have to say the word.”
Click.
“No, thank you,” he said, accepting the full cup as she handed it over to him after sliding on a paper sleeve.
“I could text you?” John said quickly and then inwardly cringed at how desperate it sounded. He barely knew this man. For all he knew, he was bothering him. “If I weren’t coming over, that is.”
“Sher-”
On the street, in the drizzly gray morning, John glanced back at the house. On the second floor, where their bedrooms were, he was almost sure he could see a woman watching him, but it was for such a fleeting moment that he doubted himself. What he could be sure of was that something was unsettling about Bill’s house and it was very odd that Trudy hadn’t been home the entire time John was visiting, not even to just say hello. It was plausible, he supposed as he walked, that she’d decided to let them visit in private and was staying with a friend or even out of town, but then why not just tell him that? Or were they having marital troubles and just didn’t want to talk about it? He was pretty sure she had a standard nine to five, so she wouldn’t really be at the office on a Saturday morning, would she?
Holmes would have laughed at that. Perhaps he would have made some sort of jibe as to how John Watson had as much stealth as a bull in a shop full of china and crystal, however Holmes was not here and Violet very much was and John just didn’t want to speak to her at this particular moment.
“Wh-What are you-”
John felt some kind of liquid pouring from his mouth as he grunted, trying to focus through the pain.
“Look, John. Just look.” Sherlock motioned for John to spin, very carefully so they weren’t touching. John winced but did as he was instructed. For the first few minutes he just looked like normal John Watson. Sherlock’s eyes in the reflection were disapproving, and so John let the false image fade. Blue eyes darkened until black marbles stared back, blood pooled at the corners of his eyes and from the seam of his mouth. Festering blisters erupted over his face and throat, and behind him, his jet black wings were tucked and folded against his back. Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
send me.”
He gathered up his wallet, keys and his phone, ignoring the well-intentioned text that was waiting for him. He knew that it would be someone from the group wondering if he was okay. No, he was not okay, but talking about it wasn’t going to help him. John started down the stairs and headed out, mask in place. He slid in his earbuds, hoping that music would help soothe his troubled mind.
“I never want to talk about it,” John replied, flashing his best, roguish smile at Bill. It didn’t quite reach his eyes. Bill smiled back, expression full of worry and concern. “There’s not much to say. I watched my best friend tip over the edge of a bridge with a madman and then never even got to see the body. His brother showed me photographs. It doesn’t feel real some days, but it’s hardly the most gruesome death we’ve seen.”
So when he sat in a little cafe being both coldly and awkwardly rejected by this fascinating human with the delightfully perceptive brain, it ruffled his feathers, so to speak. It also made Sherlock all the more delicious. Ever since Adam bit into Eve’s apple, things that were usually out of reach were made all the more delightful once you had them.
He thought about that over the afternoon, in between his scheduled patients. Of course, the answer was yes, he had a responsibility as a health care provider to abide by the rules regarding the pandemic.  He was already pushing his oath by continuing to attend the little street shows, however socially distanced they were. But life in a pandemic was full of grey areas and unknowns.
[I’m a consulting detective. I’ve been asked to look at a few cold cases during the quarantine. -SH]
“Do it now, Boss. He ain’t going no where,” Seb said. James grinned and out of nowhere he held one of the holy flaming swords.
, sir. I told ‘im you were a safe person to come to, you know, ‘cause of how you and Mr. Holmes was.
“Yes,” Holmes purred, his voice dipping into that low octave that caused shivers to dance at the base of John’s spine. He angled his chin upwards. “You’ve always been the most perfect English gentleman. How it must vex you to live with a bohemian such as myself.”
The grin faded just a bit as the music continued on. John wasn’t much of a classical music man, but today’s songs held a different energy or mood than usual. Sherlock paced as he played, but his typical sinuous, graceful were replaced by stilted, stiff steps. The essence of each song felt frenetic or maybe even manic, as though Sherlock was nervous while playing.
“I’ve been great, Maggie. John, this is my neighbor Maggie. She lives across from me, and that’s her husband, also a Jon,” Bill said, giving Maggie a tight smile. “John and I were in the army together.”

Soon John even found himself eschewing the meetings if they happened to get scheduled during the mini concerts. It didn’t matter if he went anymore, anyway. He was sure Ella would be concerned if she heard him say so but he didn’t care.
“This used to be the town hall, before they built the bigger building down the street. This place has been brewing their own beer for over a hundred years or some nonsense. They make all the new servers tell us the story every time we sit down,” Bill explained, rolling his eyes at John. They were perched in a shadowy corner on high-top stools around a small wooden bar table. The overly friendly waitress had taken their order with a few long, lingering glances at John that left him feeling warm. Bill sipped at his pale ale, nodding or waving to locals as they entered or left the establishment. “It’s one of the more quiet places. Some of these townies, they’re still rednecks at heart, and they get a little rowdy after dark.”
“Holmes- Sherlock-”
The group!
“He does not return your affection,” Henri said, patting Fell’s arm.
“Hurt a bit? You picked a fight with someone the size of a lorry. What is it? Small dog syndrome or something?”
Just who did that angel think he was? Crowley had half a mind to-
“You never used to complain about that before,” John teased.
“If you must know, Mrs. Davenport is a spiritual medium and is one of Henrietta’s most trusted confidantes. She has told me that she senses my mother near me and perhaps by contacting her we can bring her spirit closure,” Violet said. Her doe-like eyes were welling up with tears. “You know I long to speak with my mother again, and if I could do so just one more time-”
“She’s- She’s not imaginary. She’s your wife,” John managed, reaching out to grip Bill’s shoulder. He patted it once, until the man turned back to him, and then he dropped his hand. “You told me it’s hard to get over someone you love. That’s true. Sometimes I wish I could- I wish I could do it over. Say good-bye properly, or save him or something. Sometimes I forget he’s gone and I think he’s in the room with me. You’re grieving. There’s nothing imaginary about that.”
“You did this?” John managed to strangle out. Moriarty’s inhuman grin widened.
It paused for a few moments, and Sherlock’s pacing had stopped. The tall shadow of him stood in the middle of the room and after a few moments of wild hand gestures, Sherlock shouted, “Fine!”
* Half-beta'd by MadMags. More comments in the end notes.
“Enjoy your afternoon, Dr. Watson! I hope it’s very
Behind the bar, the large blonde was continuing to glare.
“Mettie, my Queen!” Henri exclaimed. He hopped up onto a bar stool, hanging his cane off the side of the bar. “I have brought you two lost little lambs from your own country.”
“Hang on, what exactly are we doing, Violet? This is starting to resemble witchcraft, if you must know the truth,” John objected in a whisper. Violet’s nails started to dig into his hand in warning.
He couldn’t help but notice the lingering, worried looks that Billy gave Gideon as they maneuvered him onto the examination table. The lad was really very thin and had an almost feminine way of moving. Billy continued his manic chatter as he reached out and assisted his lover in taking off his outer jacket. “But, er, listen, sir. We’re a little short on cash-”
“You will,” Sherlock agreed before retreating into the house once more.
“Ah. I just keep getting them from work,” John said, motioning to his medical mask. He knew they weren’t supposed to be reused but he hadn’t expected to be leaving his house so often. Sherlock’s brows knit together before he called down again.
“The web of crime created by the late Professor Moriarty,” his voice dropped to a whisper as he began his explanation, “was in shambles before I ever left London. There was one piece of the puzzle that was missing and it’s absence makes it dangerous. If anything is left, that means the work of the Professor will never truly end.”
“By not doing so you are both exhibiting those polite manners I was speaking of and proving me correct, which I do enjoy immensely,” Holmes teased. “John Watson, the perfect gentleman.”
“We begin! The veil is thinning between the spirit world and our own, and we have very little time,” the Madame bellowed, in a voice that commanded them to be silent. John’s nostrils flared, and he huffed. How
“Ah,” John replied. It was strange. Usually, he was confident with all sorts of people. In the army he’d had a rather vulgar nickname based on the fact that he’d had a bit of a romantic reputation (well, that was a kind word for it), but something about this man was different. Different from Bill, even. With Sherlock, even simple conversation felt like it had some kind of weight to it, a meaning that hadn’t been there before. Was he flirting? Was he simply trying to make a friend after being bored and quarantined with his old landlady?
to fraternize with?”
“He has told us that you might be able to help me with a little problem I am having,” Sigerson purred, letting his voice drop into an impossibly low octave that had even Fell, who did not usually care for Sigerson, shivering. Mettie’s grin widened, and a flush spread over her… cheeks.
Moriarty, as James was now calling himself, seemed to stay true to their bargain. Whatever favor was needed in return for saving John’s life, he hadn’t asked for it in thousands of years. He did live in slight fear of that moment. Sometimes the curiosity, the wondering of what it might be that Moriarty would ask for, sent shivers up his spine. They barely saw each other, though, with Moriarty preferring to stay close to the inner circle and the power struggles there and John choosing to live among the humans. He hoped that James forgot, but he wasn’t stupid enough to believe he had.
The battle still raged on.
John didn’t know how he was going to handle just sitting back and watching an invisible enemy pick off his friends one by one.
“You’re late,” Sherlock said, his deep voice calling down from the window above. He was wearing a mask again and this time it was a dark floral baroque sort of pattern that reminded John of bad wallpaper.
Sebastian, his once long blond hair shorn into a short cut, sticking up all over, pulled the weapon from John’s shoulder, watching him pant and writhe beneath him. His smirk was mean. “You always were an easy target.”
John dutifully followed Sherlock, protecting him, sometimes even when the detective couldn’t see that he was there. He moved into Baker Street and put up with the toxic experiments and rotting food in the refrigerator (he didn’t need to eat but it was a simple pleasure he enjoyed) because he believed in Sherlock. There were no real such things as guardian angels, but if there had been-
Crowley tossed his cane to the other side of his flat and summoned a drink with a graceful snap of his finger. Several snaps later, Crowley could concede that, perhaps, he might have been a little unreasonable, too, but it took enough wine to kill a human and only within the privacy of his own rooms was he willing to admit it. Perhaps one day in the far future, when he was through feeling sorry for himself (ha! Like that was going to happen), he could try to see it from the angel’s perspective. Sadly, that wasn’t going to be today. Or probably within the next century.
“Sherlock! NO!”
It was all so ridiculous that John could do nothing more than roll his eyes. The shrill voice of the woman carrying on made John wince and he glared resolutely at the table, attempting to make sense of the shapes in the darkness. There were three large candles, made of red wax, and what looked to be a crystal ball. There were a few other gems that glittered in the dim light, but the crystal held John’s attention. It was certainly a trick of the light that had it looking less clear and more murkey. The table began to shake.
“You tell
Like the still and disturbing calm after a large explosion, just before the screaming started.
They exchanged numbers and John smiled at him, although the only evidence of the gesture was the crinkling around his eyes above the mask. “Excellent. I’ll see you.”
“Comte. Raised in the country, spent your childhood between Paris and your Albi, preference for motherly figures. Oh, I see your surprise, monsieur, but I have French relatives in my family as well. You may know of them, the painter Vernet,” Sigerson shot off, flipping the card back and forth between his fingers. Henri adjusted his spectacles and offered a pleased smile.
There. Maybe that would get Sherlock talking about what he did for a living. It was certainly more entertaining than the charts that were going unfinished in front of him, or the half-eaten turkey sandwich that sat by his side. He only had a few more moments of free time before his next telehealth visit. This would be a nice way to pass the time, and if he didn’t get to Sherlock right away, well, then he’d have something to look forward to.
“Of course. I would be happy to oblige you.” She let her hands slide over his body. “In many, many ways.”
His leg twitched painfully as he walked briskly away, not paying attention at all to the direction he was headed in. After a few streets, he was forced to lean against a wall to catch his breath. What was wrong? So Sherlock had a girlfriend. They could still… They could at least be friends, then? Didn’t John need more friends, as his, apparently, kept passing away?
It took him a few counts in his head, to ten and back to one and back to ten again,before he could peel his eyes open. Luckily the threat of rain meant the area was fairly deserted and the people who were walking were staunchly ignoring his panic attack. He pulled his phone out of his pocket. It was another email notification.
[Appalling lack of grammar. -SH]
Sherlock shook his head and wrapped his long fingers around John’s wrist. He tugged at John until he was following Sherlock numbly up the stairs. Something had changed. He couldn’t put his finger on it, but something in his energy felt lighter than it had in eons.
“That wasn’t on purpose,” John said, pulling his pants on, followed by soft pyjama bottoms and a tee shirt. Sherlock only laughed harder.
* This is set during the Hiatus. If you have not read The Aquatic Equation, it may not make sense as it's set in that world.
After a few moments, he was able to open his eyes without tears stinging the back of them. He breathed out in a heavy huff and looked around, trying to ground himself with where he was. Boring bedsit with it’s bland walls and uncomfortable bed. He really should have tried harder to move out, to make a life here, but he never quite recovered from coming back. Then COVID-19 had swept across the globe and the part-time clinic job he’d taken had become a full-time nightmare.
“You might. But you won’t,” he said confidently. He started to go inside.
“Frrraternizing,” Crowley grumbled again, draining the wine glass before sending it hurling into a wall. His anger had long lost it’s fire but when you’re this many sheets to the wind sometimes you just do things for the
“Sir, we all do what it takes to make a living. I don’t ask questions,” Billy told him in a low voice. It was a warning, but also pleading. Please don’t give us away. As if John would ever.
“It’s amazing that you can do what you do even during quarantine,” John told him. Sherlock hummed, contemplating the idea of it.
The downside was that a better angel would not be bleeding out on a cloud right now. He should have faith that he would be healed, but it was hard to believe when a demon-poisoned blade was lodged in your shoulder. He was fairly certain that angels weren’t meant to have heartbeats or blood at all, but war taught so many lessons as it raged on. The betrayal of the Morningstar was rending the Heavens apart and nothing in creation was as it seemed.
So many intelligent souls fell to his charms and were damned for all eternity. The silly reasons people chose to sin- for fame or recognition or fortune- but Sherlock wanted none of that. He merely wanted to solve his puzzles. If the alignments meant anything in reality, he would even go so far as to say that Sherlock was probably a chaotic good. He didn’t let anyone but John see it, but he did many good things. It just wasn’t always lawful.
“Not so perfect, Holmes,” John said with a sigh, unable to enjoy his drink any further. He put it on the table at his side. “I can’t help but feel there is something you’re not telling me.”
“Please do! I shall entertain your friend while Mettie entertains you. It is what she loves to do, after all,” Henri encouraged with a saucy wink, linking his arm again with Fell. Sigerson, who lived to annoy Fell it seemed, agreed to the proposition.
“Oh! I say!” the gentleman gasped.
“See? I know you must be a false agent because Mycroft would never actually care,” Sigerson replied with a triumphant gleam to his eyes.
It made John shiver.

“Bill! Bill, sweetheart,” the woman was saying with gentle slurring in her words. “How’ve you been?”
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” the man asked. He seemed to be smirking. And then he started speaking again, spilling out details about John that he couldn’t possibly know from his military service all the way down to the fact that John was mourning someone.
As he rounded a corner, cutting through Baker Street towards the shops, he stilled as he came upon a strange grouping of people. At first he felt irritation blooming in his chest and across his cheeks as he slowed his pace, staring intently at the statuesque figures. None of the people were moving but all of them stood with their heads bowed as if in prayer. It wasn’t until he neared that he realized that they were adhering to social distancing guidelines, making his first instinct of anger fade. Embarrassment quickly replaced it as he wondered if he was interrupting some sort of memorial. This caused his heart to thud as he wondered if he’d be attending such a gathering soon. Funerals in the time of the Pandemic were going to be an odd, probably live-streamed situation.
John snorted. [Aren’t you sweet.]
- Seriously, SO much stress.
When Jim from IT walked through the door in Bart’s lab, with sweet, silly little Molly already in his thrall, John couldn’t bear it. No.
“I’m having a hard time letting her go,” Bill told him. He looked away from John, tilted to the side and staring up at the sky, or the trees, it was hard to say. “It was quick and very sudden. Sometimes it’s just easier to pretend she’s still here. But I can’t tell you to get over your friend while at the same time having an imaginary wife.”
It wasn’t
“You bled out from your stomach,” John snapped, hand spasming around his cup. He set it down. When he spoke, his voice had turned into a hard growl. “I took your pulse. I’m a doctor, I know what a dead body looks like.”

The lacerations on Gideon’s back were no joking matter. John was a soldier and a surgeon, so his professionalism prevented him from a sympathetic wince as he stitched the poor boy back together. All the two would agree to was that Billy hadn’t been involved in the incident and that Gideon had ‘fallen’.
“Mary,” John whispered, brows drawing together in a frustrated scowl. She waved her mobile phone at him with a wink.
The worst part of grieving someone is that it sometimes hits you when you least expect it. Triggers can be small. Maybe you’re out on a date and the mug your coffee is served in resembles their favorite cup. Maybe you’re walking past an obnoxiously blue bar, now under new ownership, and without realizing it you’re reliving every moment the two of you had together. Maybe you see someone wearing a blue scarf out of the corner of your eye and you turn, expecting them to be there, and it’s a stranger, instead.

Someone was shoving at John’s shoes. “Oi! Wake up!”
be on time. If he were trying to be a good spouse, he would be, but he knew in his heart he didn’t particularly care about being a good husband to Violet anymore. Perhaps he could spare enough time for a quick jaunt back to Bak-to, er, Mrs. Hudson’s house. It had been some time since he had checked on her. Not since he returned from that cursed trip to Sweden.
“That I am, dear,” John agreed. “Were you in need of my assistance before I go?”
Thin lips twisted into a sweet smile and the gentle cadence of an Irish accent replied so sweetly, “Mr. Sherlock Holmes.”
“You are completely bonkers, you know that?” John laughed, enjoying the breeze through the open window and the giggling woman at his side. “Absolutely insane.”
Sigerson.
“You should really try their bacon, egg and cheese,” one of the other customers suggested and John almost dropped his cup at the sight of her.
“Ah! Professor Moriarty!”
“How’s Trudy been?” John asked, looking around at the neglected garden. Most of the plants were half-dead and weeds were growing up between them. Bill snorted.
“Always a physician. I’m in quarantine, I should be allowed some vices to get me through,” Sherlock replied. John considered what that might mean.
“It’s a little hypocritical, telling John to get over his dead friend,” Trudy was saying. John hadn’t seen her in so long and he’d forgotten how friendly and warm her voice was, even when she was scolding her husband. She sounded like she was pretty close to the door where he was standing, actually, but he heard her footsteps as she moved away.

“You’re saving me from a frightfully dull afternoon with my wife and her friends,” John told him with a casual wave. The two boys exchanged a loaded glance at the phrase ‘wife’, but they said nothing on the subject. “No charge today.” John paused, and then he winked at Billy. “Mrs. Hudson would have
Click!
“Yeah, let’s go grab something. Do you like pho? We’ve had like, seven of those places open up in the last year but the best one-”
John paused and took out his earphones and realized that the people on the street were attending a concert. Beautiful, strong classical music was streaming out of the upper window of one of the buildings, washing over them in a bewitching ocean of sound. He started to walk slowly towards the group, positioning himself across the street and far enough away that he could pause and listen.
“Would you like room for cream and sugar?” the kid asked as she filled his cup with a beverage that was more of a prop than anything he was going to consume. John shook his head.
“Ignore him, he’s never had a day of fun in his life. Not to mention I wouldn’t want to deprive anyone the opportunity to view my best side from every vantage point,” Mettie said. She reached out for Siegerson’s hand, stroking it softly with her little fingers. “Has Henri been telling you all sorts of naughty tales about me?”
His phone buzzed with a notification.
Without Sherlock to write about, he’d been slacking off on his blog posts, so most of the comments he was getting were spam bots. There were a few from some woman named Lucy asking to speak with him, but he ignored those as well. An old acquaintance of Sherlock’s, a gossipy young man named Langdale Pike, had forwarded John another article with a supposed sighting from a tabloid. John rolled his eyes, but then closed them, squeezing tightly as the unbidden image of Sherlock going over the railing played out in his mind. He growled and hit delete without reading it.
It was all John could do not to slam the top of his laptop down as the Zoom meeting ended. He closed his eyes and pressed his lips together, forcing back his emotions. A painful lump was building in his throat. God dammit, he was a soldier, but that didn’t make anything easier when it came to losing people.
“You sure you don’t want anything to eat? We make a really good breakfast sandwich,” the kid suggested. John gave her attempt to upsell him a tight smile.
“Have your party, if you must. You act as though I’m a monster, but I have been a good husband to you,” John told her, feeling the strain of their marriage acutely. “I have given you a good home and never abused you, never forced you into anything you didn’t want-”
John leaned forward in his chair, feeling warmth flood his face as he considered what his friend might have kept from him. “Secrets have never been to anyone’s benefit.”
“You understand, Watson, that Moriarty is the greatest criminal that has ever lived,” Holmes said. The way his eyes stared off into the distance, something he did often as he sorted through his brain attic, held a frantic energy that John didn’t trust. He was on the verge of asking Holmes if he relapsed into his love affair with cocaine, however he knew a lack of trust could be detrimental to recovery. Not to mention he couldn’t fathom, with the way they’d been travelling, that Holmes would have snuck out to procure some and John had searched through their luggage during one of the few calm moments they’d had.
That might mean Sherlock wasn’t-
“Of course, Mrs. Watson.” The woman, this ‘Madame’, seemed to be sitting across from John, which left him wondering whose hand he was holding other than his wife’s. “Do not let go of your partners. It is of the essence that we not break this sacred circle.”
“Then why are you melancholy? And in such a beautiful place!” Henri said, gesturing around them. The bartender made his way over, letting Henri order a few drinks to be charged to Sigerson’s tab, and returned his face expectantly to Fell.
“You’ll have a more pleasant conversation with me than you would some old pensioner,” Sherlock told him. “Now, what was your opinion on the bruising patterns that I showed you? You were extremely vague, I can only assume to prolong the conversation.”
“There is always pleasure when you are lucky enough to enjoy your work, as I do,” Sigerson said, but his words held a cold, sarcastic tone. He held out a hand to Henri, covering the man’s smaller one with his own entirely. “I’m Sigerson. That is my associate Fell.”
“Well. That was a thing.”

John thought he knew pain. He was a Heavenly soldier, an overseer of war, and as a healer, he always assumed he had experienced every level of pain and suffering.
“You’re insane,” John laughed. Sherlock shrugged.
John grinned, really smiled, and nodded. “Yeah, that sounds good.”
“Yes, I lost track of time,” John replied, looking up at the gorgeous creature who was leaning out of the window. “I like your mask.”
“I’m surrounded by fools,” Sigerson muttered, but not quietly enough that Fell didn’t hear him.
He could be accused of avoiding Violet’s little soiree, but he couldn’t help but feel as though the seance was leading to something he truly didn’t want to be party to. Luckily for him, as he opened the door to the surgery with ideas of visiting Baker Street in mind, he was greeted by a last minute patient.
“I’m sure. Thanks, though,” he said, turning away from the register.
,” Violet said in her high, sweetly sarcastic voice. John tried to glare at her but it really was awfully dark in the parlor.

was gone. And he was never coming back.
“Spirits!” the Madame’s voice bellowed, causing both of the women who gripped John to tighten their fingers.
If Mary was, and he’d felt her dead body with his own hands- If Mary was here, then did that-
“Touchy,” John said. He pursed his lips. “I don’t think something that would leave those marks but not break the skin would be enough to be the cause of death. Unless the murderer was extremely good at what they were doing. Are there other possibilities?”
“Ah, very good of you. Come, Miss Mettie. Perhaps you
“I’ve seen that bruise pattern in more intimate situations,” John repeated, not knowing if he should elaborate more. Any normal human being would understand what he meant by that.
“It’s- It’s been so long since I- Since I-,” John stopped, at a loss for words. He shrugged. “I don’t know how you can stand to touch me.”
“These, these are my works,” Henri said as they passed them, his grin like that of a proud father showing off his children, shouting to be heard over the raucous laughter and loud music coming from within.
“No!” Sherlock said adamantly. “She’ll make them regardless, if you start giving her money for them you’ll just encourage her. We’ve got dozens of them.”
“Yes, but we’re old now,” Bill snorted.
“You’re never on time, even when I do conspire against you,” Miss Addington replied with a chipper smile. She had a valid point. Violet often pressured her to ‘manage’ John a little better and it didn’t work. John’s unwillingness to be at home always kept him running past his scheduled time. John smiled at her in earnest this time, noting that Miss Addington reminded him quite a bit of Miss Hudson. Even though she was young, she held wisdom that was beyond her years. Her eyes were kind and she had an indulgent sense of humor when it came to her employer.
“Are you well, sir? It was a very busy afternoon,” she asked. He offered her a thin smile.
He’d listened as Sigerson had procured vials of something he claimed would make him work harder, faster, smarter, and he’d let him inject, despite being old enough to know better about the wonders of cocaine. He’d listened quite discreetly when Sigerson had seen the wedding announcement of a certain Doctor John Watson, and when he’d decided
“I had a late patient,” he said as his surprisingly strong wife manhandled him in the direction of the parlor. The normally bright sitting room was almost entirely plunged into shadow, save for a few candles in the center of a table he didn’t remember being there before. He grunted when Violet’s firm hands practically pushed him into a hard wooden chair. He looked around at the shadowy figures and attempted to give them a wincing smile. “Hello. Are we not having dinner first?”
[And I wasn’t actually asking. - SH]
Woman,” Sigerson told him. “She always did enjoy a good trick.”
He was not the best demon in Hell, but he also wasn’t the ugliest, so he could live with that small comfort.
Her touch was so real. This couldn’t possibly be a dream. He shook his head, rubbing both hands over his face before pressing his eyes into his palms to block her out. “No. No, no, no, because if you’re here, that- that does things, Mary. That-”
“Good job,” John approved. In an attempt to look casual, he folded his hands on his desk, trying not to cringe when he forgot the sandwich at his elbow which ended up knocked into the bin.
“Nah, she’ll be alright. I never know her schedule anymore,” Bill said. His words held an evasive, secretive element, but John didn’t push further.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, sir. You as well, sir,” the sweet girl said, giving a gentle bob before leaving the room. As soon as the outside door closed behind her, he sighed, leaning forward on his desk, clenching his eyes closed.
John nodded. He shivered, really starting to feel how cold the room was, and then nodded again at Bill. “Yeah, see you around lunch time.”
- Inspired by a true story I read on Tumblr that I thought was beautiful, I'll try to link at the end. But also a smidge inspired by the Bubble date people.

John tossed his bag into the backseat of his car and started off, not exactly eager to be on his way back to his small Philadelphia studio apartment. It seemed really lonely, but he also felt more optimistic than usual. He felt like everything would be okay for the first time in a long, long time. As he pulled his car onto the main street, cruising one last time down through the historic district, he saw a familiar woman strolling along on the side of the road. He rolled his eyes and pulled over, honking to get Mary’s attention. She grinned and skipped over to the passenger side, leaning down to speak through his open window.
“Johnny!” Bill exclaimed delightedly, meeting John at the door of his quaint old home. It was a green painted brick building in a historic little town that reminded John of Chestnut Hill back home. At one point he was sure the house had probably looked cheerful outside, but now the green paint was dirty and peeling in some places, revealing scars of red underneath, and a few of the shutters were loose and starting to fall. Bare window boxes slashed across the outside of the building, contrasting with the neighbor’s brightly filled boxes.
It took John an entire week to get a handle on his feelings and convince himself to go back to the street once more. He hadn’t been paying attention to the time, and as he was walking up to the little socially conscious group, it was already dissipating. He sighed. He walked closed to the building, his limp agitating him as it had through most of the week, to see if the sign said when the next show was going to be.
