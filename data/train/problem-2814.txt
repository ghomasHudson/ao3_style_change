Dean realizes now how ridiculous it was to think otherwise. But he always assumes the worst. “I just figured … you made that deal and there was no undoing it.”
He looks at Dean’s CDs and cassette tapes. (Dean: the only person in the word to still own cassettes.)
“Will you shut the fuck up?” Crowley said. “Listening to you chucklefucks talk about your persecution complexes makes me want to beg for waterboarding. Or a Mariah Carey Christmas album.”
He appreciates her confidence in his abilities—a stint at Stanford undergrad does not a “big data expert” make—and he should thank her. Honestly. But instead, he decides to take another off-ramp. “Dean,” he says, sitting up in his chair to glance over at his brother. “You finally got it—your reason to learn how to code.”
“The shape-shifter? Because that ended well.” He sighs. It’s clear that Dean isn’t taking “it’s none of your business” for an answer. So he just says it: “Eileen wants kids.”
Cas suspects it’s because of Jack. They’ll want a favor down the road. Or they want to stay in God’s good graces. What better way than sucking up to God’s dad? He should tell them not to waste their time—he’s not someone with any kind of power, and he plans to remain that way. He’s not interested in pettiness or politicking. He’s not a leader. Has zero ability to govern other angels. No, from here on out, he’s happy to be the bumbling, ineffectual dad who Jack visits on the weekends.
A couple people laugh as they turn and walk away. They leave Dean feeling more confused than the day he first set foot in heaven.
, every day.” He imagines waking up with Cas every morning. Making him breakfast. Washing his clothes. Taking him to the beach. All the wonderful things that equal a human life.
“Right, I’m a stupid guy who can’t science. But I understand when you’re catastrophizing, and you are.”
“All right,” Dean said, putting his hand down to push himself from the floor. Cas got up and reached out to help Dean stand, but Dean shrugged off the offer. “I’m okay.” He bent over to gather the beer bottles for the recycling bin. Cas picked up the small stack of photographs.
Dean approaches the car, takes his keys out of his pocket, and then stops. Faces his dad once more. “Cas isn’t just my friend, Dad.”
When he was alive, he dealt with his failure by drinking until he blacked out, or by driving to the middle of nowhere and howling his pain to some forest or empty road. But now that he’s no longer alive, he has no recourse. All he has is time to think about his failures. About the fact that the angel was a gift—a gift he didn’t appreciate.
Crowley stood. “Well that’s touching. But one piece doesn’t fit, and that’s me. I blow your little theory out of the water.” He shrugged. “I don’t experience guilt. Don’t even know the concept. And ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if it doesn’t—”
By then, Sam knew some of the details. Dean hadn’t told him everything—hadn’t told him about how Cas had cried and said
Sometimes Cas thinks that if he’d found one angel with half of Dean’s integrity, with that kind of grit—well, things might have gone differently.
The rest of the evening unfolded predictably. Claire didn’t end up getting in a fight with Jody—instead it was Alex, who for some reason wanted to go for a run even though it was dark outside. “It’s not safe,” Jody said. “It’s Sioux Falls!” Alex replied. And Jody said, “You have to stop this unhealthy obsession with your weight.” And Alex said, “My desire to exercise is anything but unhealthy!”
He’s never worked out what his death must have looked like through Dean’s eyes. In the moment that the Empty took him, Cas was at peace, happy to make the sacrifice. Even when he got to the Empty—to the “snitch ward,” as Metatron called it—he remained at peace. And that peace—coupled with how Dean had taught him to care about the world—allowed him to survive. To care about the angels he was imprisoned with.
“Uhm…” Castiel tried to think of something he’d done today but his head was still trying to adapt to the situation and to Dean, who seemed to have a very intense gaze. “I, uh, I had a very normal day at the university.” He noticed Dean might think he was an older college student, so he added: “I did everything I usually do as a professor of Ancient Languages.”
Castiel knew that Gabriel was only pulling his leg, but this was the first time since they got the mission that he wished someone else could go undercover in his place. He could feel his heart pounding against his ribcage and his breath speeding up just barely. Of course, it could still be that their target subject was straight – it was even the more probable possibility – but now he couldn’t stop thinking about what could happen if not.
“Hey, I know you’re still waiting but maybe you want to order something to drink while you’re waiting for your date?”
“Well, it looks like your date finally arrived.” She winked at Castiel. “What can I get the two of you?”
Dean nodded in approval of Castiel’s choice. “It’s a good movie. And Ariel is hot. Also, Eric. I had a huge childhood crush on him.” He whistled appreciatingly. “But I’ve always been weak for the whole dark-hair-and-blue-eyes look.” He paused, realizing what he’d just said while Castiel blushed again. “I mean, I wasn’t trying- I didn’t mean- I was just speaking like generally. Not that you don’t look good, I mean, you know you’re good-looking. And I did tell you that I think you’re hot, I was just- I better shut up now.”
The waitress smiled, scribbled it onto her pad and told him it would be just a second. Castiel smiled back but as soon as she turned around the smile fell, and he started massaging his temples with his fingertips. He could feel a headache coming on. If Balthazar wasn’t here as soon as he’d finished that coke, he’d leave. He had enough of the other customers staring at him.
Not having much else to do, Castiel wondered what she’d been doing outside. Calling her boyfriend to pick her up as soon as her shift was done? Maybe there was a family emergency and she was checking in? He hoped not. And what kind of family emergency could that be? Maybe someone was sick? Or maybe she had a child waiting at home. She seemed a little young but there were younger girls to have become mothers. He sighed. He should stop imagining the personal life of his waitress out of boredom.
“Castiel,” Dean echoed, trying out the strange name. He wasn’t the first to be confused upon hearing it for the first time, seeing as it wasn’t a very common name. “Even though we’ve known each other for… all this time now, Cas, I get the feeling that I don’t even really know you. Now, I don’t know if that’s because of my constant chattering, which doesn't leave the time to say a single word between to breaths of mine, but since I’m trying to change, I thought, why not lean back and you tell me a little something about yourself.”
Castiel, having lost the thread of their conversation, furrowed his brows in confusion. “What do you mean?”
Now it was Dean’s turn to blush. It was just a tinge of pink on his throat, barely noticeable, while he stoically stared onto the street. Castiel was surprised to see him fumbling like that, after he’d paid his last compliment with so much confidence. But he supposed it was one thing to tell someone you find them attractive and another thing to admit that they look like your fictional childhood crush.
Castiel nodded, trying to save this piece of information about Dean. “You might think so, Dean, but that’s because you value your own skills to little. You might not know how to speak Ancient Greek but I’m barely able to build a shelf or change the oil on my car, let alone do what you are doing.”
“Me? Oh no. God, no. I’m too much of a coward to get into something like that. Always looking behind your shoulder, thinking the police could get you any second? Or maybe even the FBI? No, that’s not for me. I can’t imagine living like that.” He eyed Robert over one last time, trying to search for any kind of reaction that could give him away, but nothing. That was it then. Mission failed.
Dean frowned in confusion as Cas told their audience, “Pretty boy here was sick as a dog with the flu and didn’t have anyone else to take care of him.” Dean flushed heavily when he caught on to what the girls had been thinking.
Dean sighed at these too deep thoughts and leaned back then turned to look at Cas when Cas cursed softly.  “What?” Dean demanded as he wondered what he’d missed.
He opened the front door while Dean made his way slowly up the front steps. Cas smirked, “Looks like you’re the old man now.”
“Cut the ‘gay’ crap, Dean. I’m going to look at your ribs and check them myself or we are going to the ER. Your choice, pretty boy?”
“Is the house really haunted?” Dean verified, swiftly switching to work mode as he walked back out to his car and popped open his baby’s trunk.
He hated how the alcohol had him spilling his guts but, at least, he could blame everything on it later. He hated feeling. He felt way too emotionally vulnerable right now, like the slightest rejection could destroy him.
“Whatever you say, pretty boy.” Then Cas smiled wide and offered with a grin, “Know what? I got an idea.” Cas winked at Dean, causing Dean to groan with dread.
“I really need to shut up now. Not a chick. Not gay, either.” Cas scoffed in amusement at the ridiculous denial considering their current positions. That caused Dean to order tightly, “Shuddup.”
Cas let go of Dean’s arm then offered easily, “After you clean up, if you get bored, you can come hang out at the garage and maybe we can discuss some of the plays for the game tomorrow.”
Cas slammed the gear into park and killed the engine quickly. “That’s Kyle standing beside it, Alfie’s best friend,” he informed Dean as he hurried out of his side of the truck. Dean quickly followed suit, shouldering his duffel.
“It’s not my fault,” Kyle rushed out in a panic. His pale face clearly visible in the full moon light. “I didn’t do it. I told him not to listen to them and he didn’t but his girlfriend, Kelly, went in then . . .” He trailed off with a shudder.
Cas called him before as he started to refill the grave. Dean answered his phone easily, “Hey, man. What’s up?”
He pulled into the driveway, not having the garage door opener, and then let himself into the house. He knew he smelled like smoke, so he headed straight for the washer. He found it out in the garage. He moved his car into it then closed the garage door. He undressed in there and threw his clothes into the washer then started it on cold. He’d pay Cas back for the soap later. He took a long shower then crashed on the couch wearing a t-shirt and jeans while he waited for Cas’s call.
“Who? Me?” Dean answered with a cocky grin. Then he realized they were almost to the vehicles. He told Cas, “Get them loaded up. I have to grab my stuff.” He turned and, as swiftly as his injuries would allow, he gathered up his stuff. He only paused a moment to down some Tylenol and wash it down with a large gulp from his special flask. He met Kyle at his car.
Ol’ Lady Hutchinson delivered this speech directly in front of Alfie which meant Dean would catch him with the blast if he fired now. Dean needed to create a clearer shot so he slowly circled around the room, moving beside the stairs so that they would stay open for escape. As he moved, he taunted aggressively, “Hey, you old bat, don’t you know you’re dead already? What the hell is your problem?”
By then, Kyle had made his way up to the porch, having done the gallows walk on the way. His father turned to him and ordered, “Inside, boy, and you’d better not let your mother catch you smelling like a brewery.” Then he turned back and told them, “Night, Cas. By the way, who’s your friend?”
Dean groaned as his eyelids finally acknowledged the dawning sunlight piercing them. He briefly wondered where the hell he was this time. Since his dad and Sam left, he really hadn’t cared where he’d ended up at night, or if he’d even woke up the next morning. He knew he needed to find a new hunt. Hunting gave him purpose, a mission, until his father decided he was worth something again, which was normally either bait or backup. But, at least, he got to see his dad then.
He first quickly grabbed up his sawed off while the house was quiet. Then he started search it. It took him over hour to find the body using his Walkman turned EMF and then quite a few hours to dig her up, especially with the pain in his ribs. He popped more pills during the process. She only showed up once before he was able to torch her and luckily, he blasted her away before she left. He did, however, promise her that he’d make sure that no one else would ever be in her house again.
“Just don’t feel me up too much, Cassie. I know it’s hard with all my awesomeness displayed here but control yourself,” Dean teased lightly with customary snarkiness.
This time, the porch light was already on. The front room curtain fluttered briefly as Alfie got out. The front door opened and Kelly’s father waited for the couple as Alfie walked Kelly up to the door.
Cas parked in Mel’s parking lot before he turned to look Dean in the eye. He demanded, “Do you think there’s anything to be worried about? Tell the truth, man.”
He stared dully at the blood that welled up after the knife sliced through a thin layer of skin on his wrist. What amazed him most was the fact that he didn’t feel a thing. If it wasn’t for the blood, he wouldn’t have known that his skin had actually been cut. The second cut didn’t hurt, either.
After Cas cleaned up, they went to Mel’s and had another round of pool which led to Cas being more behind in the win column. Both of them ignored the talk about Ol’ Lady Hutchinson’s house and evaded any questions directed at them. They progressed to quite a few rounds of darts and vivid accounts of past escapades. A few ladies form last night had other ideas and started up another kissing contest, for which Dean was initially thankful. However, by the end, there was still no clear victor and Dean was less than satisfied.
Dean, for his part, could count on one hand the number of enjoyable, relaxing evenings he’d had in the past year and would have had fingers left over. Actually, in the past year, the only enjoyable times he’d actually had were with Cas because of Sam’s and his dad’s constant fighting. It had gotten so bad this past year that when his dad wasn’t home, Sam fought with Dean either over defending his father or not defending Sam. Dean had been in a no win situation since he was four years old and the last year had really drilled that into him.
“Where are you?” Cas wondered. “I came by the house to see if you wanted to go to Mel’s with me and share a few.”
Cas flushed slightly then turned to the TV and cursed again. Dean checked out the TV and smiled wide, noticing that a certain type of movie had come on. Glancing back at Cas as he felt him move forward toward the remote control, Dean put a hand on Cas’s outstretched arm to stop him then flashed a glance at Cas’s groin area. Dean was way too blitzed to be subtle. Cas looked over at him when Dean put a hand on him and then fell back when Dean shoved him in the chest with his hand. Both of them started slightly at the electric skin-to-skin contact.
“It was a prank,” Dean interrupted laughingly again. “They so got you guys so good. And it doesn’t matter if you looked. They were probably getting busy. His brother’s here now. Cas will find him because Cas probably taught him how to do this. Am I right? Right?” Dean encouraged with huge clues to catch on. Cas frowned slightly but slowly nodded his head in the end.
“Yeah, cheeseburger, fries and a beer,” Dean ordered then found himself a seat at the end of the bar. His food arrived without much of a wait and he dug in. He’d finished and was on his second beer by the time Cas walked in the door.
After a long moment, Dean shook off his treacherous mind then fixed the sheets and blanket on the couch so that they could sit on it comfortably. Then he set up the coffee table to be able to eat and enjoy without getting up much. He got a beer and drank it while he waited for the pizza, which arrived about ten minutes later.
They quickly ate lunch then headed out to Ol’ Lady Hutchinson’s place. Cas parked on the side of the road then they walked up the driveway past about three pickups. There were about seven men in their late fifties on up milling around.
“Uh,” Dean stumbled slightly then cleared his throat and answered quickly. “Pizza’s here. I have everything set up in the living room. Figured we could watch TV while we ate on the couch, if that’s okay with you.”
Dean’s emotional plea pulled at Cas, making him draw nearer to the strong, yet vulnerable man in front of him. He could tell that Dean definitely needed him for some reason. He remembered Dean’s voice on the phone when he’d called him last Sunday, how broken he’d sounded. He knew that Dean was in bad shape and felt for him. He didn’t know why but Dean struck a nerve in Cas that he couldn’t deny. Cas couldn’t help the driving urge he had to take care of Dean.
Dean leaned back to give the waitress room to put their food down. When she was done, Dean leaned forward and asked, “Why tomorrow?”
“Need someone to what, Dean?” Cas coaxed again, staring into Dean’s vibrant green eyes. Those green eyes showed how lost, desperate and needy his friend inside felt. Cas could no longer resist. He watched Dean’s tongue, gloss over Dean’s lush, too perfect lips and Cas really wanted to do something he’d never had the urge to do before.
Dean knocked one of Cas’s legs off the couch then settled between Cas’s legs so that he could see Cas’s face. He smiled at him tauntingly as he leaned over. With his eyes locked to Cas’s the whole time, he opened his pleasure reddened lips and slowly sucked in the head of Cas’s cock. He smiled around it when he watched Cas’s eyes roll back and felt Cas’s moan while Cas’s hips thrusted up. He quickly pulled up and off Cas’s cock with a taunting smile.
Finally, he leaned back with a sigh, assessing, “Yeah, they appeared to be mainly bruised. Maybe one or two fractures but they’ll heal with bindings. Want them bound tonight?”
McDonald spotted them coming up the drive and moved to greet them. A taller man with a full head of speckled gray and black hair followed him, contrasting McDonald’s mostly bald head with solid gray on the sides. The other man was about half a foot taller than McDonald which put him at about Dean’s height.
He stared down into those molten eyes and offered huskily, “I’m really not gay, Casy, and I’ve never done anything like this before, but I know what I like being done to me and I can try . . .“ He trailed off when he popped open the top of Cas’s jeans.
Dean knew this would be a future conversation for him. He flinched slightly in acknowledgement as the men continued to check his arms all over. He’d never been so conscious of all the scars he had. After that, they check his legs from the top of his boots to his knees then checked his torso and back while he raised his shirt.
“Okay, go,” Dean shouted and felt the noose tighten uncomfortably around his upper ribs. He walked up the wall as much as he could to try to reduce the pressure and maintain his grip on the rope above him. He’d almost lost his breath when he felt hands grab his and pull him out. He flopped back on to the ground while reaching for the rope around his chest. Once again, helping hands assisted him.
Cas paused, staring at the lean lines of the mostly nude body in front of him. Yeah, he’d seen naked guys before. What guy hadn’t between public school showers and football? But, man, Dean was definitely built. There wasn’t an inch of fat on that hard body.
Cas set the bottle down on the rectangular coffee table in front of them while he ordered abruptly, “Take off your shirt.”
“Yeah? Well, as you repeatedly tell me, you don’t know crap about my dreams, pretty boy, so suck it, pussy,” Cas taunted as he shut his bedroom door with his foot, leaving a very stunned Dean with a very vivid image.
“Uh,” Cas cleared his throat as he scrambled through his mind. “Alfie and some of the boys wanted to try a practice game of,” he paused for an instance before he swallowed hard then forced out, “touch, football, that is. We could definitely use you if you’re available. Help prepare us for the big game.”
“Oh, shit,” Dean moaned hotly as his head lolled back and his hips thrusted up into that warm moist cavern. Cas moaned around him and Dean groaned, moving his hips restlessly, under Cas’s mouth and hands. Then Cas started bobbing up and down on top of him and Dean reached out thread his hand into thread it through Cas’s thick wavy locks.
“No,” Cas argued, batting his hands away. He leaned over to kiss him but Dean turned his reddened face away. Cas wasn’t sure if it was from embarrassment or anger. He didn’t really care, either. He knew what Dean needed and what they both wanted.
“Well, it’s getting close to October and Halloween so he’s probably over at Ol’ Lady Hutchinson’s place,” Cas drawled out. “That’s the normal hangout this time of year.”
Dean instinctively charged and threw his body at Cas’s waist, hurling him back to solid ground, as the boards crashed in. Cas felt the breath forced out of him by the body tackle and laid staring up into the blinding sun as more loud cracking sounded in his head. He heard a familiar curse but couldn’t get his breathe back to respond in any way. He felt something pull on his legs and his body start to slide down then abruptly stop as his legs were quickly released.
Dean came with a loud shout of pleasure, shooting long hot ribbons of sperm down Cas’s willing throat. Cas swallowed around him, milking more out of him then Dean thought was possible, until Cas finally let his spent cock fall limply back down to his sweaty abs. Dean’s eyes roll back in his head as his body shuddered with pleasure again then he let out a very sated groan. It had been so long since he’d had an orgasm that good.
They quickly made it up the stairs then Alfie rushed for the door with barely conscious Kelly in tow. At the last minute, Alfie lost his grip as he stumbled through the door. Kelly fell face down on the floor right in front of the door before it slammed shut.
“So, what’s the plan for tomorrow?” He wondered because he knew he needed to change the subject before he got any more weird thoughts in his head. Thoughts of Cas, touching Cas, doing things to Cas. Oh, God, he was so losing it and too drunk to care. He couldn’t even think of leaving Cas now to cool down because he needed this so bad.
Dean sat up slightly, drawing in as deep of a breath as he could. He grabbed the bottle and took a large chug then filled his glass. He heard Cas moving around in the kitchen, so he took the opportunity to lean over and calm his body down.
“Take that, you stupid old hag. PMS much?” he growled irritably. Kelly coughed and gagged then a force slammed into him, hurling him backward into the field a few feet away. His head bounced off of something hard, but Dean used his adrenalin to keep his eye on the dark mass swirling back into the house. “And stay out!” he ordered adamantly before muttering under his breath, “Why you couldn’t just stay dead like normal people is beyond me, you psychotic old hag.”
“I’m not hurt,” Dean argued as he sat up straight as fast as he could physically manage it, ignoring the pain radiating throughout his body because of it. “So believe it.”
“I can check with Gabe and let you know when the next good time would be, if you want. I’ll introduce you,” Cas offered lightly.
“And you never checked?” Cas demanded furiously. Dean put a hand on his arm as a warning to calm down which remarkably worked as he intended, even though no words were said.
Cas answered Dean’s question as he turned back toward him, “Yeah, I stood her up but I didn’t go back because I had already stayed too long. I just headed home so the rest of your rep might still be intact.”
Dean got up not long after Cas left the house since he had a job to do. He got dressed, making sure to wrap up his ribs as tight as possible. He finished off the breakfast and coffee that Cas had left out for him. He cleaned up then he headed to Ol’ Lady H’s.
Cas grimaced, “Only got a hundred back. Still got a hundred to go. So you want to follow me back then you can come back up here if you want. I’m sure Brooke and Marcy will wait for you.” Cas flashed a smile at the ladies hanging on Dean.
“Whatever you like. Help yourself. I’m going to shower.” With that, Cas closed his bathroom door and set Dean’s mind down a path he had a hard time directing it away from.
They pulled into Cas’s parents’ place and Cas got out to walk Alfie to the front door. After Cas got out, he turned and told Dean, “You can move to the front while we’re in there. I won’t be long. You okay?”
There was a pause then Cas replied softly, “Gabe’s good. Getting ready for midterms, you know. Um, Dean, did I just hear a gun cock?”
Dean sighed wearily, knowing that meant he had to search the entire house as well as the field around the house. He asked some more questions about the story but knew what he had to do already. Soon, he changed the subject. “So, what time do you need to be at work in the morning?”
Dean chuckled in response before he advised, “Look, maybe we did found out some things like that but is it going to stop you from hunting some tail, especially when I’m out on the road working?”
He glanced around and wondered briefly what he was doing in Cas’s bed which he now recognized. He had wondered what the bed actually felt like and now he wished he didn’t know. It was a very nice, soft, wonderful bed, like being on a cloud. Sleeping on the couch after this would be difficult. Oh, well, he’d get over it, like he did most things.
Dean smirked before agreeing, “Yeah. Kind of know what that’s like. How about you tell him that we’ll come with? That way you can keep an eye on him.”
“Yeah, and I had no intention of going but, I couldn’t, you know. I just couldn’t leave her if she needed help. I didn’t know I rushed in alone. Then the . . .  Ol’ Lady . . . she was just there and . . . “ Alfie trailed off with a shudder. He closed his eyes tightly then shook his head.
Dean grinned up cockily and admitted, “Obviously. Not so bad yourself. Besides, you started it this time.”
“Want me to stop?” Cas asked as he lifted his head and stared into Dean’s eyes. It surprised Cas how hard it was to stop sucking on Dean. Dean really tasted intoxicating and highly addictive.
Once they were in the driveway, Cas got out while Dean jumped over the other side and walked up the front steps. Cas unlocked the door and let them in. Dean headed straight for the shower but Cas’s hand on his arm stopped him. Dean glanced up into Cas’s eyes before his eyes quickly moved away.
Cas slowly pumped Dean’s cock again, checking out the size. “You’re almost as long as me, De. I’m just thicker, more width.”
“You left them over there ‘cuz they were muddy,” Cas replied as he motioned to the back door. Near the mat were his muddy boots. “Which vehicle do you want to take?” He took in Dean’s glare and sighed, “Why did I even ask?”
Dean swallowed slowly as he stared down the determined father. He didn’t know what to say here. It had been drilled into him from an early age to never talk about what they did. He knew the various reasons why that rule was in effect but he also knew sometimes there was no avoiding it. So, basically, he tried to figure out which situation this was.
Alfie and Kyle smirked while Kelly blushed. McDonald rolled his eyes but Cas flushed slightly, causing Dean to cock his head in question. Cas quickly moved his eyes to Kelly and asked, “Are you grounded? Or is it possible?”
Kyle swallowed hard before he answered hoarsely, “We all heard her scream. Most of them laughed but . . . it’s wasn’t faked. I knew it wasn’t. So did Alfie. He charged in and the door slammed behind him.”
Yeah, Cas and Alfie made him feel needed which did more for him than anything they could have come up with. The only problem was that he knew it was an illusion. They didn’t really need him. No one did. And, in the morning, they would realize it, too.
A hushed silence fell over the group for a long moment. Then Lyle acknowledged softly, “Okay, I get . . . the girls, but why Alfie? He doesn’t remotely . . .”
“Whatever, pretty boy. Keep it up and you’ll be Deanie before you know it,” Cas threatened menancingly.
Cas gave a husky laugh then observed with heated satisfaction, “Automatically assuming the submissive. I like. I really like, De.”
“I meant share a few beers not whiskey bottles,” Cas snapped. “No way would that ever get me drunk. And, once again, you didn’t answer my question.”
“Shit,” Cas growled and kissed Dean again while he tried to clean Dean up. It wasn’t working very well so finally Cas pulled away. He sighed heavily and turned to focus on cleaning their cum off Dean’s hot body. He felt Dean slowly caress his shoulders and run his fingers through his hair.
After a few long moments, Dean pulled away to respond to Alfie’s panicked call. Dean stumbled over to them with Cas, trailing close behind. Alfie and Kyle both had positions on either side of Kelly.
“Don’t you dare go there. You told me that you’d done it and nothing happened. How the hell was I supposed to know the stories were true? Or that she’d . . . she’d . . .”
“Shuddup and move your ass, Winchester,” Cas ordered playfully before lightly shoving Dean to get him moving.
Cas cleared his throat then greeted uncomfortably, “Mornin’. Sleep well?” Cas casually leaned against the kitchen door frame.
Dean forced himself to ignore it while he smirked and countered tauntingly, “Or I can kick your ass, bitch.”
. . . someone to. . .,” He cajoled desperately then he bit his lip, trying to keep his most desperate plea hidden.
“Do over,” several of them yelled which was quickly followed by laughter. Both Cas and Dean laughed at that as well.
Instead, he landed on a small boulder buried in the yard with a pained groan. He heard the crunch and was sure he’d gotten some rib damage this time. His breath left him and he unconsciously released his grip on Kelly.
Dean was relieved when he saw the rundown shack in the distance. It was out in the middle of nowhere surrounded by fields and trees which meant he could do this in the daylight without having to worry about the authorities or nosy neighbors. Now all he had to do was find her bones.
Dean nodded slightly while he sat down gingerly on the couch. “Already took some extra Tylenol but it needs help.”
“Oh, shit,” Dean exclaimed with surprised pleasure and immediately thrusted his hips up to meet that awesome mouth, not caring what changed Cas’s mind. His hands weaved through Cas’s soft hair, caressing his head. Cas moved his head up to pull off but Dean gripped his head and threatened violently, “If you stop again, so help me, Casy, I will kick your ass hard!”
Dean chuckled softly then answered with innuendo, unable to stop teasing Cas because his reactions were so funny but in a nice way, “Yeah, I could go for some, uh,
Dean continued to glare but could tell that Cas wasn’t going to back down from this. Finally, he grumbled with a pout, “Fine, bitch.”
He paused, waiting for Cas’s decision and permission. After a long second, Cas gave a quick nod and Dean quirked a small smile. “Let me know what feels good,” he encouraged softly before he captured Cas’s lips another consuming kiss.
Dean refocused on the house and recounted everything he had done to it to make sure he didn’t miss anything. He paused for a moment as he ran through that morning in his mind. Then he remembered there was something that he’d wanted to check out but had become distracted by the pain of digging up the grave.
“Fine, bossy,” Dean snapped then insulted irritably as he switched his phone over to speaker. “Now what, bitch?”
“Wanted to make sure you got out of that other thing. You know, the bar from Hell. It’s not like you called me after things went to hell in there and, you know, let me know if you made it out,” Cas scolded teasingly.
Dean didn’t look at him as he shook his head and answered with a weak smile, “I’m good. Just tired and itchy.”
He tried to dodge out of the way but she grabbed him and tossed him into the corner beside Alfie. Of course, his head made contact with the wall as usual. He cursed while he cleared his head and struggled to right himself. He’d dropped the flashlight but it gave off enough light to allow him to see the kids. He’d kept the most important thing, his gun.
“No, baby,” Dean panted hoarsely after a few minutes. “Slow down. God, slow down, Casy. I’m gonna . . . shit . . . Oh, God, baby!” Dean exclaimed seconds before his body erupted, spewing long white ribbons of cum all over their torsos. His body fell back weakly with a violent pleasured shudder while he tried to get his breathing back to normal. “Holy crap,” he muttered under his breath.
Dean let her empty the flask before he suggested lightly, “Well, everyone ready to call it a night yet?”
With that, he spun on his heel and headed for the front door, only looking back a couple of times to make sure they were doing what he told them to. He saw them reluctantly head out in the direction he’d indicated and breathed a sigh of relief as he entered the ramshackle house. He paused inside the doorway and grabbed his sawed off from his bag before retrieving his flashlight.
“Damn annoying old bitty,” Dean cursed under his breath before he commanded Alfie, “Move your ass, kid.”
Cas laughed heartily while Dean just shook his head with a huge smile on his face. Cas reiterated, “Not tonight.”
Dean glared and snarled, also with a slurred voice, “You’re just wanting me to throw up, aren’t you? That was uncalled for. And here I thought we were having a good time.”
Something cluttered to the ground while Dean arched and moaned under Cas’s sensual onslaught. Dean’s moans were louder and more erotic than the movie playing on the TV. Each one sent more blood to Casy’s swollen cock. His pants confined it too tightly and he felt the need to take them off. He moaned into Dean’s warm neck and breathed over a dampened sensitive spot, “Dean.”
“If you say so, I’m not taking any bets,” Dean replied with a shrug, laying his head back more with his own legs open wide. Their knees touch but neither one care or move away from the contact. “So, this new chick, what did you say her name was? Anyway, she dumped your ass why again?”
Cas’s lips captured Dean’s lips again and Cas’s tongue quickly returned to its previously conquered ground. He was once again meet with enthusiastic submission and Cas  couldn’t stop drinking in Dean’s addicting taste. He soaked up Dean’s praise from earlier as he moved from Dean’s lips down to his neck. He licked, tasted, sucked and kissed his way down and around Dean’s neck.
“Whatever, Drama King,” Dean responded wearily as he moved into a comfortable position on the couch.
“Oh, shut up already. It’s not like it’s anything to look at anyway. What the hell is wrong with you? ‘Letting go.’ It’s the new fad. Look it up already. Stupid. Freakin’. Spook,” he rasped out until he was out of breath then he shook his head, noticing darker spots in his vision.
Dean felt Cas harden slightly after being very limp seconds before. Dean ground his hips down on Cas’s. Dean’s own cock had been sorely neglected and didn’t want to wait any longer. Cas’s hands immediately moved to the top of Dean’s jeans and he quickly worked them open. Together they slipped them off of Dean’s narrow hips then all the way off his body. Cas pushed him back and over to lean back against the other arm of the couch.
Dean is so used to being Jack’s mama that he almost doesn’t understand why Jack’s best friend’s mom looks so confused to see him on her doorstep.
“This is the first time I’ve ever seen his wings. It’s not the first time I’ve seen him stabbed in the heart, though. Remember April? He thought he was in love with her,” Dean barks out a humorless laugh, aware of the jealousy that tinges his words. Sam is silent.
“Sure thing, kiddo. All you had to do was ask,” Dean says, standing up again. Jack’s eyebrows knit together in the way that means
“You look like you’ve been crying,” Claire says, grabbing hold of Jody’s face. Jody pushes her off her lap with a grunt.
Cas moved up Dean’s body, allowing their flesh to rub against each other, then captured Dean’s lips in a gentle, probing kiss. Like Dean had earlier, Cas made Dean taste himself in Cas’s mouth. Dean moaned softly, not sure what he wanted more right now. Sleep or Cas again, because that had been beyond amazing to him. He figured the emotions involved probably made the sex more intense because, with Cas, Dean had truly felt loved, really loved by someone for a change and he hadn’t had to pretend at all. That made it all the better.
Dean then bravely met Amber’s father’s eyes and told him solemnly, “I’m sorry.” The father’s face drained of all color but Dean continued, anxious to finish this part, “I don’t know for sure but there is a pile of bones in a grave about a hundred feet behind the house. I can show you where. I’m fairly certain the old lady’s bones are in there but there are more than that. You’d have to have a specialist come out and check.” Deep down, though, Dean knew she was dead.
Cas quickly leaned over and kissed Dean again while he placed the wet rag on Dean’s abs. Dean moaned into the kiss but jumped slightly at the touch of the cold rag. Cas pulled away with a shuddering breath. He ran his empty hand through his hair and warned, “Dude, stop getting more . . . sexy or we won’t get any sleep tonight. Damn, De, do you have any idea how hot that was?”
Dean turned around and saw Cas standing there, staring at him. “What?” Dean demanded self-consciously.
“We’ll have to try that again when you’re not wounded,” Cas panted. “Right now, I really think it was a draw.”
A muffled scream sounded from behind the wall about the time he found the hidden latch. He carefully eased the door open, but it creaked anyway. Unfortunately, another scream covered the noise. He crept down the steep steps with the flashlight still on. It was too dark down there to see anything without it.
“Hell yeah,” Kyle and Alfie agreed readily. Kelly nodded weakly so Cas and Dean slowly helped her stand. Cas also kept an arm out for Dean in case he wobbled again, which he did. Alfie reached forward and grabbed Kelly’s arm while Kyle caught the other one.
As much as he hated to admit it, Dean was lonely, very lonely. He knew he could go to any bar and probably leave with someone for the night but it was so empty anymore. Lately, all his one night stands felt so empty. He could pretend that they cared for him while they used each other.
Dean winked conspiratorially then exited the car carefully, holding on to the car door for a moment as the world spun slightly, before he walked over to Cas’s truck. Cas stepped out and opened his back door to let Dean into the backseat of his supercab. Dean heard the house door open behind him and winced again then grinned for Cas. He was so used to hiding his ailments.
Dean smirked self-mockingly but evaded easily, “Rumor has it that I’m not too bright. Thought she was a person. You know how the mentally challenged are.” Cas and Alfie rolled their eyes at the evasion.
His curiosity gained satisfaction with the third cut. He felt that one but not enough to flinch. He stared at the third cut and knew that he probably needed stitches for that one. But, at least now he knew that depth did work for the numbness. He could still feel pain if it went deep enough.
“Home. I’ll text you from my cell if you want to have that, too,” Cas replied easily. “Now, the real reason I called was not only to see if your sorry ass was still alive but also to ask if you’ll be in the area this coming weekend.”
Cas waved it away. “Wanted to.” Then he stopped uncertainly as he ran a hand through his hair. Very soft, silky hair, Dean now knew from experience. “Look, De-?”
“Because I’d rather ride your ass,” Cas growled irritably. “It’s a hell of a lot more fun.” Dean felt his face heat up at the image that popped into his mind and was very thankful for the darkness in the truck but he was even more thankful when Cas took the hint. “What the hell, Alfie? You know better than this.”
Dean would never admit that he actually enjoyed watching both of them sleep while he stayed awake, like the protector he used to be. Back when Sam had needed him, and his father had needed him. Now both of them were past that and made it blatantly clear.
Ten minutes later, Dean and Cas relaxed on the couch in front of the TV and ate their pizza. They both had on a pair of jeans with shirts nearby in case they got cold but Cas had the house temperature at a pleasant level. Dean felt a bruise forming on the left side of his face and Cas sported a black eye on his right side.
“Arms out,” Lyle ordered as the sheriff moved in to assist in the assessment. Dean rolled his eyes but did as he was ordered because it was how he’d been trained from the age of four.
“Technically, she was, about a hundred years ago,” Cas amended then surmised correctly, “You pissed her off to get her focused on you. Just like that bar fight two months ago.”
“No, . . . but someone could have slipped us something. They had to have. There’s no other way . . . no such thing. It was just a bad trip,” she reiterated firmly, desperate to believe that.
“Or it could have been from any one of your exploits. You were damned detailed,” Cas reasoned. “Besides everyone knows that dudes don’t sit around watching pornos with other dudes unless they are gay.”
Dean shrugged as he answered over his shoulder. “I was hoping to scare the bitch. But I made sure I had a clear shot before I did it. And I got them out so why not drop it and move on?”
Cas grabbed his hand and pulled him up. Cas waited until he was steady on his feet before he exploded, “What the hell were you thinking, damn it?”
He just hadn’t been touched enough lately. Not like this. Not by someone who really cared about him. He knew those bar chicks just weren’t the same anymore, especially after . . . her, and them.
Cas got Dean in the shower then spread sheets on the couch and added an extra pillow. Dean came back out of his bedroom where the only shower currently was. He’d thrown on a old gray t-shirt, boxers and some jeans. He walked slightly hunched over, protecting his left side, but his color appeared to be a little better.
Dean arched an eyebrow then gave a drunken smile. “Dude, we are talking about sex, threesomes and bondage. What is there that you can’t tell me?”
“No,” Kyle retorted with more strength and determination. “I went in with a few others but  . . . they . . . Kelly and Alfie . . . they were just gone, man. Footsteps made in the dust ended in the middle of the room then nothing else. There were no other clues. They didn’t answer our calls, either . . . they just vanished.” Kyle ended with a terrified gulp, but Dean had heard enough.
“Shuddup and let go,” Dean snapped angrily, moving up to make Cas let him go. He couldn’t take Cas laughing at him right now. He felt too exposed and emotionally vulnerable to deal with it. In the back of his mind, it definitely creeped him out how much he did enjoy Cas and everything that they were doing to each other.
Dean interrupted quickly because he knew where Lyle was going with this. “Alfie rushed into the house to rescue Kelly when she screamed, according to Kyle. The old lady was already fixed in her past so she saw him as her husband, choosing Kelly once again.”
The sheriff looked down at the mud covered jewelry and nodded solemnly, “Yeah. I can do that. Thanks.” He gave Dean a slap on the back then moved off.
Cas quirked an eyebrow with a slight smile on his face. “Making excuses already? You really that much of a pussy?”
“So he’s staying with us?” Alfie wondered. Cas shook his head and Alfie frowned, “You’re not sending him to the slasher inn?” Cas rolled his eyes in response. Then Alfie paled and exclaimed in horror, “Dude, no way! I told you the Navy would turn you gay! Seamen, dude. Semen. Come on, it was so obvious.”
Dean arched an eyebrow as he argued, “Except for that one over by the oak tree near the treeline.” Dean pointed it out and Cas drove right up to it.
Dean snapped the shotgun closed and grabbed Alfie’s arm then yanked him up and pushed him towards the stairs. “Go! Run!” Dean ordered in a yell as he rushed over to Kelly. He pulled her up with one hand but couldn’t manage totally without dropping his gun which he wouldn’t do.
“Don’t talk to me that way. You brought her here. You will pay. You and your stupid kids. Traipsing in my house. Trespassers. I’ll teach them. It’s my house. Mine!”
Dean busted out with a short laugh. “I know you aren’t. I’m not, either, but you are definitely checking out my abs, Cas.”
Dean knew he couldn’t go into more detail and didn’t want to give them wrong ideas in case they encountered another ghost. “Not really but we still got away.”
It was a slow night since it was during the week but there were still plenty of ladies eager for a chance to vote. Dean drank in between ladies and occasionally one of them would take their turn at pool but, for the most part, Dean watched Cas as he kissed his ladies. It wasn’t a conscious decision because he really didn’t believe that Cas was doing anything against the rules. It was more a compulsion.
“Dean,” Cas cautioned uncertainly. Cas knew something big was happening here, something really big, and he was unsure whether he wanted it to or not. The alcohol in his system clouded things up in his mind but he knew, really knew, that he enjoyed making Dean feel good. Surprisingly, this, touching Dean, made both of them feel good.
Cas reached down and grabbed Dean’s cock while he gave Dean a long penetrating kiss. He firmly caressed Dean’s cock. Dean moaned softly and gently thrust up his hips into Cas’s hand, needing more friction.
Cas smirked, “I’ll have to introduce you two and you can let me know. Bet she could make you like it.” He shifted a little and let his legs fall open subtly since this conversation made his pants feel tight in certain places.
“If I remember correctly, you ended up taking care of me that night which means you stood her up, right?” Dean verified then demanded at Cas’s slow smile. “What?”
Dean ran his eyes up and down Casy in reflex, mentally his drunk mind automatically imagined Cas in his current state of half dress but in handcuffs, while he smirked and teased lightly, “Not the submissive, huh? Well, most alpha types like you aren’t.”
Cas smirked slightly then asked, “Feel up to going out tonight or do you want to get some more sleep?”
Cas rolled his eyes at Dean, hiding his amusement, then Cas patronized him sarcastically, “Yeah, right. That’s it exactly.”
“Whatever you want,” Dean replied easily. “No one will believe you anyway because you were all drinking out there. I smelled booze on all of you. So it doesn’t matter what you say. Although if you don’t want to become social outcasts or shipped off to the nuthouse, you’ll just say it was a really good prank that you all were in on and everyone fell for it, hook, line and sinker.”
“We’re adults. You’re not and we’re almost home so watch your damn language,” Cas snapped authoritatively. He glanced back and saw Dean’s lips twitch in amusement which made him feel better. Cas secretly wondered if Dean might really need a hospital.
Cas groaned at the feeling of Dean’s cock, pulsing and erupting along his which caused Cas to shoot out his orgasm seconds after Dean finished convulsing. Cas strained and rocked out his orgasm before he let out a shuddering breath, causing Dean to gasp and thrust against him. Cas moaned then captured Dean’s lips in a soft kiss. He pulled up slightly before observing drily, “God, De. You’re amazing.” Cas shuddered again with pleasure.
By the time Dean had controlled his pain then slowly sat up, he saw that the three teens from last night were in Cas’s living room staring at him. He frowned and wondered vaguely, “Shouldn’t you guys all be in school or something? Is everyone okay?”
Sure, there had been bar maids and single chicks a plenty at first but soon it all got to be too much for him. Yeah, he could pretend that the chicks liked him, that they cared about him, that they thought he was something, was worth something, or even somebody. But after a while, it just took too much work to pretend anymore and he felt twice as bad afterward. The emptiness of it all threatened to consume him in a dark swirling abyss. It was especially hard when he kept remembering how everyone who was actually supposed to care for him, deserted him every chance they got.
Alfie narrowed his eyes thoughtfully. “That’s why you were delayed. He was sick or something, right?” Cas nodded to which Alfie scoffed. “How could you lose four hundred dollars at pool? You’re better than that and you being rusty is just bullshit.”
She smiled at him again then nodded while Alfie moved to get more water from the case Cas kept in the back for football practices, paintball and other outdoor activities. He gave one to Kelly before drinking one himself. Dean smiled slightly with satisfaction then looked up front. He caught Cas’s eyes in the rearview mirror and smirked at him before leaning back and then stretched out more to find a more comfortable position. Finally, he closed his eyes wearily.
“Don’t look,” the ghost screeched. “She’s mine to kill. She’s mine. You should’ve never replaced me with her.”
Dean smiled and tightened them up for show while he answered lazily, “I have a routine that I do almost daily. I have a physically tough job and my dad was a Marine. If there’s one thing a Marine knows, it’s physical fitness. You have great def, too, Navy Seal.”
Dean listened to the recital, unaffected, but made a mental note to double check the house first thing tomorrow morning. He glanced at Cas who was staring at him, trying to read him. Luckily, Dean was good a hiding stuff.
“Why?” The sheriff repeated absently then pushed his hat further back on his head. “Well, now, I thought that would be obvious. I want to know who did it.” He paused again then stared Dean in the eyes before he added solemnly, “So that I can thank them for getting rid of this death trap.”
Cas nodded in agreement. “Yeah. Makes sense. What about something like that first night we met, when Flo was thinking about it? You know, with the two of us and her, remember? Would you have?” Cas’s voice prodded huskily.
He sucked his fingers in with a slight moan, definitely tasting Cas then what he assumed was him. He heard a sudden intake of breath and looked up to see Cas standing by the bed, staring at him. He licked his fingers clean before he pulled them out of his mouth then prodded, “What?”
He grabbed some short glasses and the Jack then walked back in. He sat on a chair next to the couch and handed a glass over to Dean. He poured them both a bit then watched Dean shoot it down in less than five seconds. He poured Dean a little more and felt better when Dean took his time with the second one.
His eyes watched those amazingly lush lips gliding up and down his entire length. He felt that awesome tongue continue its flicking and whirling. Dean’s warm moist throat muscles contracted around his head then those expressive eyes locked with his and that was the last straw. Cas shot his seed down his best friend’s throat without any warning.
More than an hour later, they had kissed all the ladies at least three times so Cas wondered, “So, what do you ladies say?”
They spent the next few hours having a great time shooting pool and critiquing, or rather, insulting each other. Before long, a couple of girls started hanging around and talking with them. Dean relaxed into the chill atmosphere but it reminded him of when he first met Cas. He wondered curiously, “So did you ever make it up to Flo?”
“I know, Casy,” Dean answered a little softer. “I’m fine. Just another day at the office,” Dean muttered to himself then studied the wet ground under him, remembering what he’d seen from above. He crouched down after checking for more snakes, or snake movements.
“Dude, missed the perfect op for the ‘Talk.’ And you even had the other party here. What were you thinking? You’re giving big brothers everywhere a bad name,” Dean ragged.
The hot water woke him up and sobered him up some. He bandaged his arm and gathered up his stuff. He didn’t care what Cas thought. He’d driven in worse shape than this and he had to leave this town behind along with all the crap that had happened in it before he lost what was left of his mind.
The porch light immediately turned on, signaling an impatient parent waiting. Dean flinched when he turned to Kyle and handed him his keys. Dean turned off and pocketed his phone then offered sympathetically, “Sucks to be you tonight but, hey, at least you’re alive, right?”
Dean gave a raspy laugh and observed sarcastically, “Yeah, that telekinesis crap doesn’t work when you possess a human, bitch. Ain’t death a pain in the ass?”
Another man sidled up to the conversation and interjected, “And I want to know what the hell my baby girl went through.” Dean cocked an eyebrow in question so he added, “I’m Kelly’s father.”
When Dean knew he was nearing the bottom, he pushed away from the wall and tried to land on the balls of his feet like he was taught then rolled back to help distribute the force. It still hurt like hell. Dean cursed then heard the hissing seconds before he saw the strike coming. He jerked back just in time and jumped to his feet, pulling his pearl handled colt. He quickly shot the snakes he could see in the head then fumbled for his flashlight in his pocket. He immediately turned it on and checked for anymore threats. He saw another snake slinking away. He shot that one too.
“Whatever, bitch,” Cas mumbled softly against Dean’s ear, causing a slight shudder to flow down Dean’s body.
Dean smirked crookedly, “I am so not spooning, man. And I’ll never be the little spoon. Got that? Plus, I don’t cuddle.”
A young classic blonde cheerleader type girl, probably Kelly, hung from her hands in the middle of the room suspended by . . .  nothing but the ghost’s presence. Alfie, he assumed, cowered in a corner, facing the wall, like a child in time out. Alfie glanced around to look behind him then flinched as the ghost screeched and a welt rose on his naked back.
“Remember last night when I told you that some people had tried to burn the house before but it didn’t take?” He started then waited for everyone to nod before continuing. “Well, that ain’t exactly accurate. People have burned the house before and watched it burn to the cellar. But, first thing the next morning the house is back, just like it looked the night before it burned. It’s never been gone more than twenty-four hours. So, there’s no way of knowing if it took until tomorrow morning.”
“Oh, baby, I love you so much,” Dean scoops Jack up and holds him tight to his chest, kissing his head for a long moment. “Now let’s get you that juice.”
Sam finds him later, a chair drawn up beside Castiel’s linen-wrapped body, staring blankly at the wall. Sam places a gentle hand on his shoulder. Dean blinks back into awareness, a sharp pang of sadness slicing through him as reality materializes around him.
The first time Jack calls him mama, Dean doesn’t answer. Truthfully, he doesn’t realize that Jack is even talking to him. He and Cas have always been open about Kelly, and Jack—having fully entered his curious toddler phase—has been asking more and more questions recently. Dean assumes that the tiny Nephilim tugging on his pant leg is asking about his biological mother and, well, Dean is a little too busy trying to chop onions
“Please, Cas. I don’t know where you are—if you’re in Heaven, or what—and I don’t know if you can hear me, but please. You came back to me every other you’ve died. I need you to come back to me this time, too. Please. I can’t face this without you, man. I can’t imagine my life without you in it. I used to be hopeless, Cas, but you gave me hope. I need you,” Dean confesses.
“This isn’t the first time I’ve seen him die,” Dean says quietly, his voice alien to his own ears. He can feel the pity rolling off Same in suffocating waves.
Dean is alone in the cabin. Kelly is still in the bed upstairs, so Castiel lies across the kitchen table. Dean mechanically unfolds the spare sheet and drapes it over Castiel’s body. Only after he’s covered does Dean allow himself to feel the full depth of his sorrow. It rises quickly. It consumes him. It is an acute awareness that part of himself is missing. It’s dull ache because he knows he cannot fully recover. Dean feels an urgent need to talk. He doesn’t know if Castiel can hear him anymore.
“We need to find him. Cas would want us to find him,” Sam continues. Dean’s once again focused on the hole in Castiel’s chest. He pushes away from Sam. He stands for the first time in hours. It doesn’t feel right; he feels too far from Castiel.
“I’m just kidding, geez. I love my girls so much. After I lost my son, I really didn’t know what I was supposed to do. There’s nothing worse in this world than losing a child, and I lost my only baby. And then I lost my husband. And I was so alone, except for Bobby. Bobby gave me you two, for better or worse—and I love you boys like my own, I really do—but you weren’t really my kids back then. You were off saving people, hunting things, and skipping town as soon as the job was done. You boys didn’t need me the way kids need their moms and I still had a hole in my heart that only a kid could fill. And then you brought me Alex. She was so difficult at first, but I was so determined. I never got to have any of those teenage firsts with Owen that I got to have with Alex. Of course, I know it would have been different with my own boy—and there will always be a piece of me that died with Owen—but I’m grateful that I get to have the girls. Each of them is so different and it’s such a sharp learning curve with all of them, but it’s so humbling. So. Thank you boys—my ¬boys—for giving me my daughters,” Jody says, voice trembling.
“Yes, I’m Jack’s mama,” Dean says matter-of-factly, leaving no room for further discussion. Mrs. Brown blinks hard.
Dean balances Jack on his hip as he fills the purple sippy cup with diluted apple juice. Jack starts squirming and making grabby hands at the cup before Dean has even located a lid for it, resulting in Dean expending more time trying to maintain his hold on the toddler instead of finding the sippy cup lid. Jack makes displeased noises as Dean looks. He eventually finds one in the Bunker’s antiquated dishwasher, quickly shaking off the excess water pooled under the rim. Finally, Dean hands his wiggly toddler his juice and puts him back on the floor with a ruffle of his blond hair.
“Yes, he did,” Dean says. He can’t quite keep the smile out of his voice. The smile is just as evident in Claire’s voice when she responds.
“Oh. Okay. Uh, help yourself to a hot dog,” she eventually says, apparently deciding that it wasn’t her place to question Dean’s title.
“Jack, we don’t run inside!” Dean calls after his son, who throws a thumb’s up in Dean’s direction, but doesn’t slow down.
“I’m sure he wishes the same thing. And probably so does Cas, if that fantastic eye roll is anything to go by,” Dean says fondly. Claire snorts.
“Claire said the same thing,” Dean answers, picking up his own book from the nightstand. He opens his mouth to say more but Cas cuts him off.
