"I'll... I'll see you soon... Stamford will take care of you. Stay for me, Sherlock. Sherlock? I love you. I should have said it before... Sherlock? I love you."
First of all, if anyone out there is still interested in this story, thank you for being so patient; I've been so ill and even though I left hospital end of March I have been really depressed and struggling to write. This is my longest chapter yet and I wrote it in hospital. My lack of energy means it has taken me nearly two months to actually type up the chapter.
Twenty minutes later John has to admit defeat. He would have to ask Sherlock how he taught a five year old such intriquate techniques. When Jack was ready he would take him fencing. Kid was already an olymic champion compared to him and that was with a wod of tinfoil. To say the least, John's impressed. He wipes sweat off his brow. Jack is a picture of ease.
"J-J-J-J-" although he cannot hear himself, Sherlock is aware something is wrong. John brings his palm up to his mouth and places a gentle kiss.
So sorry for the long delay, thank you so much for being patient. it means a lot. ;)
There are no more responses from Sherlock and John thinks he might have a heart attack before he can even get to Baker Street.
Sherlock was going to remember hearing John say those words for a long time. It pushed him right over the edge. He cried out loudly, clinging to John as he came inside of him.
“You pulled my hair,” Sherlock repeated slowly.
Sherlock's hand was swollen and John insisted on icing it.
Sherlock could barely believe this was happening. His first date! 'We can if that's what you want.'
"I think you've caught a fish!" John hurried over excitedly.
"I must have stayed out too long in the sun," Sherlock told him, shamelessly wanting more of John's sympathy. John needed to forget Mary forever because She was nothing but trouble. "I really don't feel well, John. I think I have heat stroke."
“We’ll have to share this bed,” Sherlock said, stuffing his clothes and belongings into an oak dresser. He was a little nervous now that they had arrived and he couldn’t avoid facing his parents. He hoped his story could hold up even to Mycroft or he’d never be able to live down making up such a silly plan. It would be humiliating. He yearned for a cigarette but couldn’t let his parents catch him smoking. He was trying to make a good impression on them.
Sherlock watched John lick marshmallow off of his fingers.
"Realizing what?"
John finally turned to face him, raising an eyebrow. “You don’t like seeing me anymore? Is that why you were acting so weird? Is it something I did? Maybe this vacation wasn’t…”
He kept his eyes to himself and his back turned to John as they dressed. He checked his cell phone and saw a missed call and voicemail from Lestrade. There had been a new lead in the case. "Hurry, John," he said. He grabbed John's hand, pulling him along.
Before he could really stop and think, he shot off a text:
This was just another of the many intimate little dinner parties Irene held, a group of notables that surely were brought together to loosen information, strengthen a network of acquaintances. Per usual, Sherlock performed as a pretty little ornament, serving each course and dispensing wine and water like an easily-ignored garçon. The work itself was mindless enough, as thoroughly trained as Sherlock was for the task, save for the fact that among the dinner guests, Jim was present.
“It’s all right, John. I know that too.”
Worse, Jim ignored him outright.
“What did you do to her?” Dominique bellowed. He lunged for Sherlock, only to be tackled to the ground by the PCs that had already attempted to allay him. “My
The Belstaff with the silk
Still, Victor’s hand lingering on his shoulder was not unpleasant.
There was something in his tone, something John couldn’t quite place. It bore examination, but since Sherlock didn’t seem like it was a pressing matter, John shelved it for later. Instead he flexed his shoulder absently, trying to ignore the way it ached and twinged.
, Sherlock thought.
Irene’s grin was sharklike. “Good boy.”
in the embassy. I was busy defending him and everyone else from a sodding ex-Cassiline and a lunatic.”
“I realized I forgot to ask--what’s your name, anyhow?” Lestrade’s self-deprecating chuckle did funny things to Sherlock’s chest-region.
and the other traditional texts of Naamah’s trade, Irene had him studying anything and everything from the patterns of an ever-whirling geopolitical climate to the most far-flung languages. Tumbling classes, various martial arts. She insisted that each intellectual pursuit was best matched with a physical one. She tested him after dinner parties on his ability to observe the details of clothing, conversation, and body language her guests offered, and taught him to draw inferences on his findings. She taught him how to tell and how to spot a lie. Though their personalities and natures sometimes clashed, Sherlock found himself genuinely appreciative for all that Irene demanded of him.
John bit his lip, closed his eyes, willed with every fibre of his being for his erection to just  go away. But still, he couldn’t move from that spot near the door.
Sherlock suppressed a little wave of anger. What should he care what his frigid guard thought?
Sherlock gesticulated at her hip. “Not there.
“You’ve never been… not submissive?”
“Sir!” he gasped. “Sir--I’m so close--”
“Irene? You think that’s my concern?” Moriarty shook his head. “I taught her what she knows. I imagine she sees into your head better than you think, Brother Watson. No doubt she’s just as ready to call your superior, should you fail.”
“Just a--thing. What’s--?” Sherlock cleared his throat and lifted the anemone. “I mean. Where did it come from?”
“Of your bloody marquist?” John snapped. “I swear to you, if we get caught--”
“Shut it, you,” he calls back good-naturedly.
Sherlock laced his fingers together and pinned her with a raised brow. “Explains what, exactly?”
Along the left-hand side of the tiny restaurant there were three booth-tables before the seating wrapped around the open kitchen area; Sherlock had picked the middle of the three booths along the window at the far end. Thankfully Sherlock hadn’t caved and lit his own cigarette, but their booth was woefully close to a tiny bar opposite, where an off-duty waitress had recently lit up.
Amelia’s eyes shone bright, righteous vengeance like a banner pinned to her heart. “It doesn’t matter.”
“You’re disappointing me, Sherlock. I thought you were more observant than that!” Jim clucked his tongue, then added, “Though, I suppose the sedative might be to blame.”
--caught his hips, whispered cooing encouragements. The lock on the stocks clicked open, and the top panel lifted.
“Oi!” Greg calls, but good-naturedly.
AGAINST ALL ODDS, it is not a bullet that kills John Watson. It is not old age, or sickness, or his own hand. It is the death of a child that was never his.
Even still, it didn’t dampen Sherlock’s good mood, a loose easiness he’d never quite experienced before. He offered John a wide grin and an enthusiastic, “Good morning, dour pilgrim.”
Sherlock supposed he would have been an attractive fellow, if he actually found people so. Lestrade had a rugged, mischievous sort of smile he’d flashed at Sherlock several times at the bar, peppery hair beginning to silver at the temples. And he was empirically fit, which was more than Sherlock could say for many of his fellow ‘Yarders.
He ignored his mother, staring up into the face of the statue. Some trick of the design or the lighting made it appear to be looking down directly at him. Sherlock swallowed hard, trembling though he couldn't tell why.
He thought of his dreams again, of Cassiel’s stern silence, Elua’s laugh and Anael’s hope. He had failed all of them.
Take-out for dinner and a shower later, he was more than ready for bed--he hadn’t run that hard in some time.
He says it again a few moments later when the cold shock of fresh lubricant dribbles down his cleft, his whole body jolting with it. Distantly he can hear John’s quiet chuckle. Hot fingers slide through the lube, catching it and spreading it over sweat-slick skin before it can drip onto the bed. Another eternal moment, and Sherlock feels the cool, impersonal press of silicon against his over-sensitised skin. For right now John measures its length along the line of Sherlock’s cleft, thrusting gently in a pantomime of frottage.
“If you had your way you’d be sitting at Sherlock’s feet, heeling like a good dog.”
The gleam of John’s skin after his morning routine, the grunts of exertion as he moved from form to form, which sounded so similar to--
Sherlock couldn’t breathe. How had he let his tendency to show off get the better of him so thoroughly he’d destroyed any chance of proving himself worthy of Jim’s time or attention? His mouth gaped, gasping for words, for apologies, but found none.
“What’s this?” John asked, taking in the sight of Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson hugging. “Is everything okay?”
Molly sighs and rests a light hand on John’s green-hosed knee. “It’s hurting him, too. You can’t forget that.”
Sherlock only stared at him. It was the first time John had ever broached the subject of his service to Naamah willingly.
"What better than the dart which pricked you?" Mr. Ames's voice was still soft, his words thoughtful. "We argued over so many designs. But in the end, we found old insignia from the last anguissette--"
kind of reaction, surely.
Mr. Ames only smiled warmly, his bright blue eyes crinkling at the corners, and scratched at his stubble-lined jaw. His mouth, his shoulders said self-deprecation, but his eyes shone with pride.
. Had Mrs. Hudson gotten away?
That was when Sherlock tasted honey on his tongue, felt the bright lady smiling on him. His vision went white. He knew his offering had been acceptable, even as he came.
“Oh, hell--” John hissed as he stripped his blazer off, forced it onto Sherlock. The sleeves were comically short, but the thick wool blend was blazing hot from the heat of John’s body during the fight. The crisp tang of fresh sweat, bitter stink of gunfire, the perfume of sun-sweet apples.
Sherlock swallowed hard, offering him a smile. He had no idea what came next, only that if he could find his way into Lestrade’s bed, maybe the detective would listen on the next case.
come in here and play your freaky little head games. You
John’s throat tightened. Just like that, tears pricked once more at his eyes. “I do.”
“John--” The word was a breath on Sherlock’s lips, his fingers gripping the blanket into a vicious fist.
--that tantalized him as he shaved (which had never been much of a problem anyway--thanks to his meagre D'Angeline heritage, he'd been blessed with a striking sparsity when it came to post-pubescent hair growth).
Luca’s hand trembled, and the gun quivered. Hesitation. Luca wasn’t a killer. He was a healer--he might do it, but every fibre of him would fight it.
“What in Elua’s name are you talking about?” John hissed.
They strolled along in strained silence for some way, Sherlock letting the heartbeat of London pulse around him. Which would he succeed in first--making John smile, or making him punch Sherlock in the teeth? All it would take for the later would be to find the weak spots in his armour and dig in. Getting him to smile felt like a nearly insurmountable challenge--which was just the sort of thing Sherlock went in for.
John would email the Brotherhood as soon as possible. John rarely had a reason to distrust his gut reactions to people, and Jim Moriarty made his skin crawl.
Something twisted in Sherlock’s middle. Jean-Julien Guitreau, a son used as an example for a father tangled up in bad business. Frederique nó Bryony, a twice-spurned lover, approached by a powerful stranger who could twitch the strands of a web, offering him a
“All of them,” Irene replied. “He visits them as whim dictates.”
“I’m fine,” Sherlock answered as he trailed into the kitchen, and then mentally kicked himself for it. Was that a standard part of these encounters, which he'd just rocketed past? His hands were shaking. This wouldn't do at all.
No one’s love was perfect, but they served in the way they were called. Each of them--even Elua himself--was misbegotten. It never stopped them from acting in love.
Sherlock let his confusion show in furrowed brows. For some reason his heart beat faster in his chest, though he didn’t know why.
Seventeen was lifetimes ago, and yet here and now it feels like no time has passed at all.
His breath caught, his hand tightened reflexively as he gave up stroking to thrust into his fist: these admissions were fuelling Sherlock further, and John couldn’t help but oblige.
By the time Sherlock and John were en-route to
He swallowed down the embarrassment of stretching across her lap like an errant child, his whole upper body aflame with it.  Once settled, however, Sherlock found it difficult to keep his balance: his legs were so much longer than Helen’s he had to stretch himself out carefully, perched on the balls of his feet, and his hands were absolutely useless, tied in position as they were to lace his fingers together behind his head.
been drawn into the bad habit of gambling, particularly on horses. It was a monumental debt from gambling, as it transpired, that had brought him home to the City of Elua, Paris herself. And for what it was worth, they both saw the irony in one being a very unfortunate gambler and the other a worker in the pleasure house best-known for the allure of a good wager. But they were working on that--Jean-Julien was getting the help he needed.
came Mycroft’s voice from memory.
And the simple act of protection--it too went beyond the constraints of falling into training, of dispatching with efficiency of motion. Each time he’d interceded for Sherlock, there
White-hot fury flashed in John’s eyes, but Sherlock didn't wait around for it. He turned and stalked off to find Lestrade.
“It’s clear,” she whispered, “but I don’t know if anyone was close enough to hear that noise. Let’s go.”
“Please, don’t let me interrupt. Eat. I only wanted to say a few things before you go.”

Sherlock couldn’t help the way his cheeks burned. Suddenly his little game felt immature, the sort of thing a dull-witted, besotted teen might resort to. He started to reply, but remembered the way in which he’d been instructed to address Jim. It would only make his embarrassment worse.
John buried his face into Sherlock’s chest, his voice shredded. “You’re here, oh Elua, you’re here--”
“You,” Sherlock begged. “Please, John.”
John snorted. “Fine, fine. It was worth a shot, hm?”
Had Sherlock been any sooner in leaving he would’ve run directly into them.
Sherlock knew, was certain it was a behaviour goaded by the spiteful impetus to win the bet, the sort of odd game of chicken played by jocular straight men, daring one another to get closer to something approaching homosexual activity before calling another’s bluff. John had likely done it in school, and surely it was a bonding tool in the army.
There it was again, Sherlock noted. That creeping uncertainty. She may have had the will, the desire to dominate, but Sally lacked the experience, the confidence. Something new spiked through him, and in his muddled state he wasn’t sure what it was--disappointment, or compassion, or something else altogether. He would have the privilege of showing her just how good she could be.
He whimpered at the idea, at the imagined gulf of humiliation of someone else--Regina, possibly, or--and this was a dizzying thought--John discovering him as he was, strapped to a desk, bare to the world. Would it be enough to tempt the Cassiline's celibacy, or disgust him even more?
Their stories--Frédérique’s and Cecily’s--spun in his head. Two people who’d had their entire world tangled up and ripped away. It burned in him like a brand, a truth too immense to ignore.
“Ticklish.” Sherlock chuckled. “Not that one, then.”
He stays the hell away from the water. Refuses to even bathe.
This wasn’t going the way Sherlock had hoped. He’d honestly planned to have Emile wrapped around his little finger by now. Instead he found himself being interrogated. “I don’t see what that has to do--”
Sally’s face went bright red, the fury in her eyes unmistakeable. “Sherlock--”
“Yes.” Sherlock thumbed the ‘end’ button before Irene could ask anything else.
Sherlock thought of his trip to Fleet Street, the week before, to help DS Lestrade. He'd been able to make a few keen observations, but that was a long shot from solving the case himself. A small, proud part of him hoped that maybe with her instruction he might improve on his ability to impress the Yard with his intellect and skill. It could be a useful career, once his time as a servant of Naamah ended. If he ever chose to end it.
This startled a laugh out of Sally. “This doesn’t mean I’m going to go any easier on you at a crime scene.”
Sherlock scowled but didn’t say anything else. Either he was going to come under the same kind of fire from the Temples of Naamah, or else the Prime Minister wanted round him for tea. He wilted just a little, then. What sort of investigation did his actions warrant?
John hates “The Monster Mash.” Almost as much as he hates “Witches’ Brew” and “Purple People Eater.” And yet he’s already heard all three of them tonight, along with a few different renditions of “The Addams Family” theme and “Thriller,” while he’s helped Greg set up for this Halloween party. Wasn’t it possible to just play
When they reached the perimeter of the scene, Lestrade gave them a distracted nod as he carried on with a few of his crew. Beside him, Sally simmered.
between France and Britain, the French Embassy in London oversaw the head temples to each god or goddess.
"Do you suggest I say no?" Sherlock folded his arms across his chest, irritation colouring his tone.
And that hurt, really. Every time he relaxed, he thought maybe he got to see a side of his ward no one else saw, that nasty display came back out. The two were inseparable. It wasn’t a mask he could take off.
His knees buckled just a bit. He found himself shifting desperately, trying to find some sort of relief against the hard edge of the desk that dug into his pelvic bone. The rough scratch of the unfinished underside where his cock slid against it was delicious.
John thought as they rocked together in time to the beat. He kept his hand still, right at Sherlock’s navel, holding him just close enough to feel the swell of Sherlock’s arse against his lower abdomen as they moved. He tried to pretend it was the music, the rush he always felt when he danced this way with someone--but the fact that it was Sherlock, of all people, had his heart hammering in his chest.
And still they moved together, Sherlock's whines and Wilkerson's quiet grunts hanging thick in the air between them, until Sherlock ached from the strain of his position, the tension of shoulders bunched and biceps curled, of abs and thighs working to find purchase for Sherlock's pelvis against Wilkerson. But Wilkerson stayed just beyond reach. With each futile thrust, the weights swung on their chains, jerking the nipple clamps until pain of it felt like Sherlock's nipples would be pulled entirely from his flesh and he could scream from the agony of it. They danced in this fruitless mimicry of penetration until Sherlock's balls drew tight and high against his body, until he was sure he would burst. Occasionally he felt the slick trail of his own precome against Wilkerson's knuckles, only distantly surprised it could slip free from the sound.
“You’re not the only one,” John admitted. “I’ve struggled with it for ages.”
Wilkerson's weight on the bed shifted, and the warmth of flushed skin pressed against Sherlock's thighs. Then a bony ridge of knuckles, the back of Wilkerson's hand, pressed gently against the root of Sherlock's cock right where it met his balls. Then another shudder of the mattress, and Sherlock guessed Wilkerson had dropped to his hands and knees, arse and hand against Sherlock.
(See the end of the chapter for
But then he caught Sherlock’s gaze as his ward came back to the surface long enough to scan his surroundings. He couldn’t quite read what was writ there.
?” she scoffed. “Do you think any of us are stupid to fall for that? We know how you get him to listen--”
“Would you prefer to get on your sleeping clothes first? I could do with a shower.”
In the final few days before Sherlock’s first assignation--the first true test of John’s training--John practised harder than he ever had before. He ran through the Telling of Hours tirelessly each morning, sometimes two or three times, pushing as hard as he could to remember each position, each transfer from one form to the next, arms swinging with the weight of his daggers, with his gun empty and safety on. Being what Sherlock was, John was uncertain of how he might have to intervene. Loathe as he was to think of the very real possibility of interrupting what would no doubt be a completely bewildering display of debauchery should Sherlock give his
John tapped the backspace key, and began again.
John offered only a thoughtful nod, a faint smile softening the expression. “Before that, though. That was something. Didn’t think you could hold your own in a fight like that.”
“If you have a friend that’s wonderful for having a laugh, but terrible at life advice, do you go to that friend when you’re having a rough time?”
Whatever Sherlock had expected, it didn’t look like that admission was it. He didn’t meet John’s eye, but a quiet surprise lifted his eyebrows a hair’s breadth. His head ducked, a single aborted nod, as he absorbed the information.
John studied Sherlock for another long moment, looking for some familiarity, and finally he realised what he searched for. He’d seen Sherlock slide into a--a different sort of personality, a different headspace as he went to his patrons. He would become a doe-eyed treat, a submissive temptation. Relief washed over John when he saw none of that now: Sherlock was only a man, one hand fisted on his knee, as nervous as John.
“It is the custom, but I--”
Helen leaned in the doorway to her bedroom, looking pointedly at the pile still in the floor.
At seventeen, Frédérique had been forced to learn how to move on.
Instead he opted to keep his chin level, his eye-contact unwavering.
And as for this chapter?
“Earn your keep or apply for reassignment,” Sherlock snapped back, finally reaching his surly Cassiline limits. “I assumed you’d enjoy this aspect of my day-to-day life. You're married to your work, in a sense, and so am I. I’m not only useful for Naamah’s business.”
Amelia dropped her key card on the table by the door, and Sherlock could tell by her movements as she headed toward the mini-fridge in the corner that she fought to control her body language. She stooped, produced a bottle of mineral water.
It was easy enough to contact her, to set up the interview. But Sherlock knew the difficult part lay in convincing her to take him on as a student.
Before the thought could get much further, though, a klaxon rang out, merciless and deafening, and Luca jerked back. He flashed fearful eyes at Sherlock before he snatched the walkie-talkie from his belt, which crackled to life.
“Then just what
He also wonders why he’d insisted he and Sherlock come to this party, rather than do what Sherlock had wanted, which was to go exploring the abandoned houses on the outskirts of town.
“The tricky thing about sounding is the risk for infection. So much preparation is needed to keep you safe. But I’m going to take care of you. I will keep you safe. This may sting--”
Sherlock struggled to find his balance, to push himself to stand. He wobbled a bit but found his footing, and took the chance to drink Sally in: her face beaded with sweat so that her makeup smudged, hair a mess. The way her clothes rumpled pleasantly and her strap-on cock jutted free from the fabric was a sight so beautiful it was a wonder artists hadn’t yet rendered it in oils or stone. She pushed her boxer-briefs down until they slipped free and puddled on the floor at her feet. Sherlock wanted to mouth along the trim lines of her thighs, her unshaven calves. He couldn’t explain why, exactly, but even little details like this were intoxicating.
“You,” Sherlock whispered.
“Any tingling? Any numbness?”
“Mr. Trevor said to send you straight up,” she explained.
John shrugged, and Sherlock’s mood did nothing to deter his smile. “More or less. C’mon, Sherlock. You’ve got to unwind sometime. Help me gather some wood.”
“What--who, though?” Irene asked, for once having lost any semblance of her usual smarm and self-poise. Her eyelids fluttered as she ran through the situation mentally. “There are no overt enemies to Terre D’Ange--”
“Sherlock Holmes, the same kid that shows up at my job periodically raising all hell, demanding to help us poor mortals on our cases?”
It had taken every ounce of restraint to neither break Moriarty’s teeth nor throw Sherlock over his shoulder and haul him back to the safety of their house, honestly.
Marcus threw his hands up before him, palms outward in panicked supplication. “You gotta be bloody kiddin’ me! I didn’t sign up for this--”
Lestrade cleared his throat, raising an eyebrow at John’s presence. “She’s the D’Angeline--”
From its spot beside the teacup on the table, Sherlock’s phone vibrated, an unwelcome intrusion. Damn Lestrade.
Sherlock’s abdomen clenched pleasantly; he fought not to shift where he stood and eyed his cordial warily. After a long moment he found the nerve to meet Jim’s eyes, to answer truthfully. “One, not at all. Most, sometimes. You? Always.”
“What’s this?” John leans forward and plucks the photograph from its perch.
Happy September, y'all! Enjoy! It's a bit short, but it's an action-laden chapter, which tends to go faster. I've missed you all, and I love all your faces. Thank you so much for the support, the comments and kudos that keep me alive. Y'all are fucking wonderful. <3
. A third showed a family crest, on which the arrow pattern had been repeated in one corner.
Sherlock twisted his head to frown at him, the
“Elua, what a waste of time you are so far, anguisset. You failed to complete the one small favour I asked of you. What shall we do with you instead?”
Check the bottom for a very minor warning.
With Sherlock pressed shoulder-to-shoulder, they waltz slowly into their twilight years. John finally has the time--and the temerity--to count his blessings, as numerous as blades of grass.
succeeded in bashing his own brains in, only for John to arrive too little too late? He’d only just awoken when the klaxon had heralded John’s arrival.
“The last recorded anguissette--those pricked with Lord Kushiel’s dart--was a courtesan called Phèdre nò Delaunay. She, too, was assigned a Cassiline guard. But he was weak--he fell for her wiles and was condemned anathema.”
I was fucking you instead."
he promised himself. It was the only thing that stopped him from crying out as he tipped over the edge.
“It is no more or less than Naamah’s service for Elua,” he snapped. “Are you implying she devalued herself?”
John let out a hum and then the hot wax spilled once more onto Sherlock’s skin: a long spattering over one shoulder, a molten line along the divot in the muscles over his spine. The heat scalded, the pain of it warping into a sharp pang of arousal with each drop. Then, John shifted again, and the cooler gust of his breath helping cool the wax sent a shiver through Sherlock. Pain, and relief, in gentle measure.
“What you did--there is only one higher sacrifice a Cassiline priest can make.”
The lift ride to Jim’s penthouse flat was interminable. The porter hovered by the buttons and John stood beside him, as silent and stone-faced as he’d been all day. Sherlock still hadn’t the faintest clue why John would be so testy when he didn’t act half this badly on any of Sherlock’s assignations, not in the last several months.
“Ah,” Wilkerson replied. “Yes.” He cleared his throat, clearly scrambling for something else to say.
Silence fell in the suite like a loaded gun dropping; there was no way of telling when it might go off, or who might be injured.
“Come on,” John said, gripping Sherlock by the sleeve.
John sped through the remainder of his statement and bolted for Sherlock’s side.
“You’re a rare creature, Sherlock Holmes,” she said. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you take this much care in your appearance, not even for your
“Give me fifteen minutes, and I’ll text you.”
Then Wilkerson halted abruptly. More shifting on the bed, and with a delicate tug, Wilkerson slid the plug free.
, their shots and shouts like thunder. A moment later their boat broke free of the
John’s blossoming worry softened as he followed Sherlock’s finger. “Ah.”
“Sherlock?” John asked, but didn’t hesitate to comply.
The thought made John’s stomach drop.
“Often enough. Did Irene not tell you I consult for the Yard?”
It’s been so long, so long since that photograph was taken. Ages and eons. They had lived through a lot in the last fifteen or so years--uni and the military dragging them continents apart, serendipity and St. Bart’s bringing them back together before Reichenbach and Mary Morstan almost broke their bond irreparably.
“We have an appointment with Sister Roberts,” his mother answered from behind him, clasping Sherlock by the shoulders as if she thought he might run away.
“All right, you bastard. You win. Now, what do you get to claim as your prize?”
“Well, Christ, if it’s only to get into my office--”
lining of his Belstaff--such a pity the June weather had made the coat’s weight unbearable.
“One more thing,” Jim said. He snapped his fingers, and Sherlock obeyed without thinking. He stepped forward, slid down to one knee.
“Ah, of course,” he replied absentmindedly. He frowned, taking in a minor detail on the back of John’s waistband, revealed be the way his t-shirt had gotten hitched on the edge of it. Two tiny bits of plastic, the sort used in affixing clothing tags.
They didn’t bother drawing rein before the house, instead barreling in through the still-open front door before they drew up short.
That was all it took for Sherlock, who came in the wake of John’s orgasm, riding out the aftershocks.
Another ignorant question lobbed out right when Sherlock needed silence.  John was making a habit of that.
John was content to stand there and wait. He didn’t want to be there, but he wanted to face Sherlock and his fate even less.
: Romani for 'oath-sworn'
The easy smile John had worn while conversing with the receptionist slid away, locked tight again behind his neutral mask as he stood, falling into parade rest. “I think it would be best if we got back home.”
Love you guys! See you soon with 53!
“It’s obvious, you know--you can’t stand me. You want to do--” Moriarty leaned in, and his godawful cologne clogged John’s nose. “--Horrible, violent things to me. Things that might get you kicked out of the Brotherhood, hm?”
“I--what?”
Next to his ear, the sound of a zipper, a quick metallic noise, and Sherlock couldn’t hide the whimper that escaped him. Just as the scent of one man blossomed in his olfactories, the press of velvet-hard flesh against his cheek, the lube-slick fingers of another person--more delicate, a woman--circled his exposed hole at the other end. Without ceremony, without synchronism, he was pierced once, and once more.
Once they were cleared to leave, Sherlock hopped from the back of the ambulance and didn’t even wait for John to catch up as he power-walked away toward Peckham-Rye station. Ever observant, though, John caught up quickly and fell in step beside him.
“Sherlock, erm, got tangled in one of the rose bushes,” John explained in mock-seriousness. “Dreadful business, you know.”
The sex scene up there depicts
In general, Sherlock wasn’t overly fond of blindfolds--he preferred seeing his patron, taking in every last detail they put on display. It left him with no warning as to which direction a scene may take, no way to read ahead in the text. But Wilkerson’s statement didn’t require a response, and Sherlock merely peered at him through his lashes before closing his eyes.
“Hm? Yes, sure.”
Sherlock wanted to give a desperate laugh for the confusion between his mind and body just then--all of his fear and enthusiasm, the conditioning that rendered him ready to show his patrons the depths of his arousal, the emphasis of an erection as undeniable proof of his desire. Instead he drew a ragged breath through his nostrils, his eyes screwed shut beneath the silk blindfold. He tried to block out the tension in his body, to purposefully relax his muscles and even out his breath and heartbeat. It took several long minutes, but eventually he began to feel the fear and arousal recede, a tide ebbing back from the shore. Where before he was a juddering, dizzy mess, he was now collected and merely trembled.
Sherlock rose at once and came to kneel before the pair as per Irene’s expectations, though his gaze rose in challenge to the man’s face.
“He chose you,” Brother Vincent said, his voice catching and crumbling again. “He chose you.”

job done, suddenly we’re wrapped up in red tape!”
“You look beautiful like this,” John murmured, sliding his palm over the now cool wax, the pressure of which was a ghost-like sensation over Sherlock’s spine. “The way the wax slides over your skin. Does it feel good?”
“Didn’t say a word.” John smiled just a little, his bare teeth catching the smallest hint of light from the moon shining through a nearby window. “But I’ll follow you to the ends of the earth.” He looked to Felippa and Lorenzo. “Let’s go.”
couple like the Wilkersons--
Indeed, the generous gift Helen had left as an apology would translate into a knot of embellishment a third of the way up the arrow-shaft. Curiously, she'd left the pre-loaded card with a hastily-scrawled note that only read, “My employer also sends apologies for the interruption.”
The climate change should have been expected, though, he reasoned. Mycroft had convinced Sherlock to take a case in the southeastern United States, which meant Sherlock had spent the days prior to their departure checking weather patterns. John, who had erroneously assumed his button-downs would suffice for whatever the States could throw at them, envied Sherlock now, who sat huddled in his spot for this stake-out in a pair of decent, dark-wash jeans and a thin royal blue v-neck tee. The change in attire for the case and climate made him look about five years younger, and not for the first time, John had noticed he’d been having trouble keeping his eyes off his flatmate.
mistake that got his arse kicked at school--
“I had hoped to give these to you under better circumstances,” she explained, “but I feel that it bears far too much history to keep, either way.”
Sherlock made a soft, noncommittal noise at that. After another eternal silence, the thump of John’s heart and the acute awareness of Sherlock’s hand in his own, Sherlock spoke again. “I’m glad.”
“You don’t have to move, you know.”
After a moment Helen came back to herself, her smile languid though her eyes narrowed again in purpose-driven focus. “It’s an acceptable start. On the bed. Now.”
A pair of dainty knuckles rapped on his doorframe. From the mirror’s reflection, Sherlock could see over his shoulder to where Irene leaned there, a bemused expression writ on her face.
“I don’t even want the files anymore, I just want you to fuck me!” Sherlock clamped his mouth shut, eyes wide in surprise. Had that really come out of his mouth?
Sherlock made a noise, coy and curious.
Sherlock squeezed his injured finger against the others, trying to blot out the sensation, the way it distracted him. He stayed silent a long while, remembering all sorts of myriad minor injuries, tussles in the locker rooms unseen by teachers. “Yes.”
-- For those of you who've read the book, just remember The Osprey & The Cormorant. n.n
The Brotherhood maintained that Cassiel’s devotion and Elua’s love would fill that void--but here John was, bound for life to the impossibility that was Sherlock Holmes and spiritually lacking for it. It didn’t matter that Cassiel did it for love of Elua. John couldn’t find it in him to do the same--not with Sherlock being what he was.
SHERLOCK’S BREATHING FILLS the silence, distant. Near-inaudible gusts, the wind on the sea, on the far end of a phone line. London is miles and years and lifetimes ago. Neither of them knows how to speak anymore. Not to one another, not to anyone. This is more than John can bear. It is more than he deserves, this last grace he’s been given. He is certain it cannot last--nothing ever does, not the way it’s supposed to.
That bastard. That utter, utter bastard.
“Why’s that?” John asked from where he leaned against the closed door, arms crossed over his chest. The edges of his vambraces glinted in the lamplight.
But then Irene and Sherlock ended his respite, entering the kitchen mid-conversation.
“He’s contracting me for a night with--with Amelia?” Sherlock couldn’t hide the confusion and dismay in his voice. “Amelia Chamberlain?”
He sucked in a deep breath, the cleansing air burning his lungs he climbed into the cab after John. He squeezed his phone to keep his hand from shaking. It was easiest to believe it came from the delicious anticipation of the marquist’s needles, that unrelenting burn as his accomplishment was limned indelibly into his skin.
Sherlock felt Naamah’s blessing descend over him once more, and the devilish grin he wore was entirely genuine. “Then you’d both best take advantage of your muse.”
It wasn’t pain-as-pleasure, none of it was; but it was the pain that blazed, proved he was
And John, satisfied, finishes with a few more erratic thrusts, his voice going high and broken.
Jim, he was terrified to move forward.
Oh god, I'm. I'm still shaking. Please forgive me for this one.
Periodically Sherlock glanced at him, but John kept his gaze straight ahead, unwilling to engage him in some petty squabble here at a crime scene.
He knew he had her, then. He went for her clitoris next, swollen and ready as he used his tongue to map its texture, its shape, before using his lips to suck gently, pulling Helen into a rhythm that kept her hips chasing his movement until her hands tightened in his hair and she held his head still, riding against his mouth. He fought for balance, overwhelmed with her blatant pleasure.
He rose then, hauled her to her feet and dragged her stumbling after him as he clambered into the train. An innocuous-looking backpack sat abandoned in the very back. He dashed for it, then dropped to his knees and gingerly opened it. Surely enough, there sat a small digital timer and enough plastic explosives to level a city block.
“You don’t have to be quite literally up my arse to do it,” Sherlock snapped back. “And control your face--you’ll scare my patron off with that scowl of yours.”
He lifted a heavy hand, prodded the tender flesh where his head had met the wall--hair, sticky with something viscous--petroleum jelly?--and gauze. Likely protecting sutures.
Sherlock huffed a gusty breath into the silence. He stared down at his erection, which was still existent, against all probability. He groaned and threw an arm over his eyes. It certainly wouldn’t do to leave the room in such a state.
John smiled ruefully, said nothing. Even here, in the safety of Elua’s heart, he couldn’t reveal his own. His chest ached and his throat throbbed, and there was nothing he could do for it.
“Mycroft found an old story--an epic poem that dates back to about fifteenth-century France.”
“If you’ll excuse me,” he grated.
“Even before he contracted you, I knew he’d been dallying at the Houses far too frequently for someone whose assets were seized when he was investigated years ago. When the officials released them, he burned through it all fairly quickly. He’s always had a weakness for Naamah’s gifts.”
“Come back to my office and we’ll discuss your marque.”
“Move your feet wider, whore.” Victor spat. “If I paid that much for spoiled goods, I’ll just take it out of your flesh.”
The 6th was Sherlock’s birthday. The day he’d debuted.
“Ah, Elua, fuck!” John gasped, his hips jerking up in surprise.
Sherlock eyes the Bride of Frankenstein standing beside him on the stoop. “What do you say, Sally? My usual partner in crime is off
Elua above, if the way he teased himself were anything like what he was walking into tonight, he’d consider Victor’s £5,000 well-spent.
His neglected cock ached, heavy and hard against the restraint of his trousers. Sweat beaded at his back and chest as he fought to keep still. He tried to shift, to rock his hips and find some kind of friction, anything, but his splayed-knee stance made it impossible.
, Sherlock prayed,
Hours later, after the cops were called on Jimmy and Sebastian, after the party had carried on and both John and Sherlock had specifically
Unfortunately, it didn’t make the most picturesque stroll, not in February. The same sort of slush lined Paris’s streets as did London’s. People tucked into layers and hunched til their ears met their shoulders looked the same in any country.
“You want me for yourself?” Sherlock blurted, thinking hazily of the gift box.
His pleas become a litany, a prayer, and that’s his tipping point–John does give him what he wants, until Sherlock’s vision whites out, his body goes rigid.
The torture, the murder cases,
Sister Verreuil nodded thoughtfully, but at this point the Scottish elder, Brother Verdin spoke up.
His heart hammered in his chest and he clung to his Belstaff as they stepped from Jim’s limousine and into the foyer. He forced his hands to unclench from where they grasped the placket when an attendant offered to take their coats. His cheeks, ears, chest all burned, and he’d only made it a metre into the manor. Then all Jim had to do was give him a glance, nothing more than a casual flick of the eye.
“Please, sir, don’t make me make you come just yet?” He kept his tone just this side of weak. “Please, sir. I know this lovely trick--”
John stills beneath him, letting him take what he needs, and Sherlock is wordless in his thanks--his gratitude spilling out in a series of consonant-less noises that echo back at them from the still of the bedroom.
One by one they retreated, after that, until he nearly shivered in the cooling aftermath, but then a firm, wide pair of hands--
Houses.
“And yet you did not apply to any of the thirteen Houses of the Night Court to sponsor your service?” She crossed to a low settee and stretched across it like a lazing Roman emperor. “I found my time there rather useful, when it came to building myself a network.”
She raised her brows in amusement, her face otherwise impassive. “Does your mouth get you into frequent trouble?”
a good beating.
He said nothing, merely raised an inquisitive eyebrow.

for handrails. Greg’s dog bounds down, nearly tripping him as he runs down the stairs.
Elua, but it was annoying.

Sherlock lifted his head to crane over his shoulder. “Your voice was hoarse and I caught the distinct smell of coffee and cigarettes from all the way over here. Now I see your clothes are rumpled, suggesting you either threw them on in a hurry because you ran late this morning or else you’re still wearing yesterday’s clothes. You’re usually an immaculate--if tacky--dresser, but the coffee stain on your sleeve of that hideous shirt indicates that you are indeed wearing last night’s clothes.”
The Cassiline Brotherhood was kind enough to wait another month, until John was discharged from the hospital, before calling him to a joint D’Angeline and London enclave. It didn’t matter that months of physical and mental therapy would be forthcoming, nor that an added gift from the trauma had manifested in his knee, a psychosomatic response that left him cane-bound and aching.
John didn’t bother hiding his surprise--raised eyebrows, a pleased baring of teeth. “That--that was amazing.”
“Too good to speak to Daddy, are we?” The way Jim’s tone slithered between words felt like the opening notes of a pretty little melody, tempting and barbed.
A shiver ran across his skin despite the warm spring air: if this morning had been that good, what did she have planned for the remainder of the weekend, had she not been called away?
Moriarty paid the freeze no mind, strolling with unbroken posture over to the alcove where the shrine had been erected. John was certain it hadn’t been there the last time they’d been stuck in this hellhole, further proof Moriarty had manipulated the situation with a deftness only Irene could rival.
!” came Moriarty’s voice from the within the flat.
Nothing like the guilt of hindsight, Sherlock thought ruefully.
, John thought.
John trembled with rage, understanding exactly were these had come from. “Of course I deny them. Those were forged by Jim Moriarty, a
as hot as it was.
Because that was their relationship in a nutshell, wasn’t it? Their orbits may have been erratic, drawing close and then moving unbelievably far apart, but the cycle always continued. And where their trajectories collided were the best parts of John’s life.
“Mmmh,” Sherlock agreed, lifting his head. Then came the trial test fluttering of sleep-gunked eyes. Elua, his head hurt.
I need a new hobby, lol.
The crime scene wound up being a deserted nook of shore along the Thames, just beyond Potters Fields park. John had been silent the entire trek, though from what Sherlock could tell, it wasn’t the same recalcitrance that he’d wielded back in the hallway of their townhouse. After Sherlock had given him the scant details he’d gotten from Lestrade (merely the address and the contents of the initial text), John had merely nodded and followed where Sherlock led. John’s presence was an iron post Sherlock could tether himself to as his thoughts cast him about.
When Sherlock made a show of groggily opening his eyes and offering his softest, most submissive smile, Victor’s grin turned wicked.
“Pointless. Now tell me.”
Sherlock couldn’t let himself think of the one person who might’ve be mad enough to take on an island of guards just to save him,
“No, of course not. Not even servants of Naamah are as perverted as you make us out to be, John. What a twisted mind you have--”
Emile laughed. “I did tell you I’d explain whenever you weren’t on Naamah’s business, didn’t I?” Then Emile started, his voice dropping into that of a first-rate raconteur, “So the story I heard was that a wise woman with the red spot in her eye was childhood friends with the old
Jim flashed him a small, deceptively gentle smile before grabbing him roughly by the hair to yank his head back. The breath caught in Sherlock’s throat and his eyes went wide, certain that the surge of his desire was written plainly across every part of him.
Sherlock grunted. “We’re close enough to being finished--”
The fingers in his hair loosened, slid in one gentle stroke through his tousled curls. “I knew that mind was sharp.”
“This is how they found the last one, actually,” Sister Roberts replied, gesturing to the pin. “A steel pin with a pearl head. I don’t think that part is necessarily important, but it’s pretty. Priests and priestesses of Kushiel have kept them ever since. Mr. Holmes--”
), so I can only hope my offering is worthy.
Finally, the weight against Sherlock was enough to give him exactly the angle he needed to rut against the bed, desperate as he moaned for her. Sweat built and clung where skin met skin, the buttons of her shirt pressing tiny indentations into his flesh. The wide steel boning of his corset transformed into an unforgiving cage that made each breath a struggle until he saw stars.
Jim’s smile was wide, and for the first time, what Sherlock had always thought before was charm felt like a grinning shark circling, scenting for blood.
. The other bodily wounds were more gruesome: “Slashes with a razor-sharp instrument along each rib, deep slits across the tops and interior of the thighs. Nicked the femorals there and there.” He frowned as he pointed to the lethal wounds on the inside of each thigh.
3.) John was excommunicated from the Cassiline Brotherhood and declared anathema, but then he and Sherlock FINALLY talked about all their special feelings, right under Elua's tree in the center of Paris
trick, why would Kushiel do this--
Sherlock pushed onward, his voice just the right mix of flustered and coquettish. “I do need your help, actually, see--”
“Sherlock?”
, Jim declaring him a true equal. Jim keeping him for a lifetime of intrigue and exquisite use, just like this.
At times, the revelation gave him strength--he would fight to his death to protect others; sometimes, though, it made him wish desperately that he could stop caring about the fate of hundreds of souls long enough to let the sea swallow him whole.
“Lie down, Sherlock. It’s time I rewarded you for all your hard work.”
The "song" is taken (in-universe) from a poem called "An Exile's Lament" by Thelesis de Mornay, the poet laureate from the original
Sherlock rung in at the gate and a calm female voice activated the gate to admit him entry.
After several minutes it became terrifyingly apparent no one was coming for him. He couldn’t even hear the shuffle of movement past his presumably locked door.
The weight of the top panel lowered onto him--just barely against the top of his neck, enough to feel but not enough to impair. Despite the noise in the room, the click of the tumblrs slotting into place within the lock reported like a cannon in his ears.
The other he left beside Sherlock’s sleeping form, there at the breakfast nook, nestled between the oddly-scented vials that surrounded him.
Sherlock did his best to keep his face trained to stony impassivity, but it was likely far too damning that he still hadn’t disentangled himself from John.
“Elua, I love you,” Sherlock whispered, and kissed him again.
“--But it is, that’s the beauty of it. Not just my first time with a man. My first time anything, period. But you’ve already noted that I like rough treatment, didn’t let that dissuade you from the fact that this was my first male encounter--confident in yourself, aware that you’ll not scare me away so easily--”
The other entrance wound up being at the base of an abandoned clock tower, long since converted into a lighthouse and then into the same mouldering disuse as everything else on the island.
“Are you awake enough to be working on
Leave it to Sherlock Holmes, of all people, to be practical.
To his credit, Luca couldn’t completely hide his reaction: there beneath the clinical calm trained into all medical professionals, Sherlock noted the rapid flutter of Luca’s eyes, the twitch of refrained recoil at the corner of his mouth.
Sherlock ducked back into his little cubby right as John’s mentor walked out into the open. Fifties, salt-and-pepper hair, Cassiline uniform and London accent.
long? John took his time, and was more than thrilled to find that Sherlock gave as good as he got, that clever tongue working working its way into John’s mouth before retreating, inviting John into his mouth to suck and nip until John couldn’t stand it any longer.
,” his mother whispered. “I think you should come read it.”
The second is a line from the song he remembered only moments before:
The gala was a disgusting display of exactly the sort of hedonism John had expected from a servant of Naamah--nude statues and paintings on display, nothing but pornographic debauchery. Champagne flowed as the moneyed denizens of London’s upper crust mingled, and John felt just how separate he was from all this.
Confused onlookers had already begun piling out into the street, alarmed at the explosion. In the distance, the wails of sirens from police boats sliced through the night air.
The penny dropped in John’s bank at the same time. “You mean, it was a patron?”
“Now may I have my dessert?” Amelia asked, drink turning the edges of her Parisian lilt coy and amused. A pretty blush rode her high cheekbones, the hollow of her throat above the the low neckline of her dress. She was indeed the ideal of Camellia canon: without fault or flaw, a rare blend of all the opposites that comprised the other houses.
He fought not to groan at his stupidity when it came to the Cassiline; he’d just made the ride home very awkward, yet again.
Beside him, John laughed harder than the rejoinder warranted. Sherlock could only guess he was siphoning off the remaining adrenaline in his system.
“You don’t,” he replied. “You have a choice. You always have a choice.”
Sherlock sat back in his seat, wheels turning quickly in his mind. Victor was receiving money from an unrelated source--Chamberlain--in order to keep up appearances? To continue indulging in everything the Houses had to offer?”
“Are you still okay with this?” she whispered. “You remember what happens next?”
Liliane shook her head. “No, we only teach that it’s a possibility, that we are to stay humble in the face of what we don’t know, and not to suppose one type of love is superior to another. Our brothers and sisters still take the vow of celibacy, as that is a matter of the church at large.”
But then, Irene was infamous for tastes that ran far and wide.
Even still, nighttime in the kitchen was nearly as peaceful as early morning there. John found an unexpected ally in the stillness, in the solitude he chose willingly.
“Valerian,” Sherlock prompted.
“Do the right thing, lad.”
It burned Cecily to think this was likely the same sort of treatment any of her brothers and sisters working outside Naamah's services might receive.
Sherlock closed his eyes, fighting the urge to laugh, and forced himself to scowl instead. “You three are impossible.”
Sherlock accepted it with a smile, and began getting dressed.
John’s face twisted then, and for the second time that day, the tears streaked in white-hot trails over his cheeks. His voice stopped working, so he pushed his next question through as nothing more than a whisper of air. “So you knowingly sent me into damnation?”
Jim’s lips, kiss-slick, stretched into a sharklike grin. “I’ll tell you if you’ll tell me what you know about your little detective case. Later. Must keep up appearances for my guest and all.”
“Have I surprised you yet?” John asked, an uncharacteristic shyness beneath his playful tone.
1.) I do want to note that I do not agree at all with the appraisal of “common” strippers and prostitutes in this story. One of the problems, unfortunately, with privileged D’Angeline society, is thinking like this--that what they do is any different, at its core. Which, you would think they’d understand--one would really hope that anyone in the sex industry in this universe would find Naamah’s joy and/or blessing in the work (or something similar, really, from whatever their higher power). By extension one would hope that any servant would want the same standards of care and safety for all their fellow sex-workers outside the D’Angeline society. Just… trust me when I say that this is a privilege that I hope to examine later on. **nods**
servants. And this, this isn’t a
That stopped him, and he looked at her again.
But it was no use. By the time the water had boiled, the tea had steeped, he was no closer to finding a conclusion as to what he should have done. One thought kept coming back to him, each time he replayed the fear in Sherlock’s wide eyes as that thug pinned him to the brick wall--
“Sherlock, there’s been an incident--”
Her hair, blonde and already greying at the temples, was pulled back into a low ponytail. Sherlock could tell by the way she clasped her hands and pursed her lips she had something rather important to say. Then her eyes fell on the bottle, and she frowned.
On their way to Moriarty’s flat, John could only replay his exchange with Moriarty and the one he’d overheard in the kitchen.
John hates that she doesn’t need to say
The sun had sunk low and John was fighting valiantly not to shiver in the February freeze before a D’Angeline acolyte approached him, tapped him gently on the shoulder.
memories, any of them.
, especially with their relationship being so new. It would be different for Sherlock, too, knowing what he knew now.
that bastard would threaten Frédérique’s family. Just because he hadn’t spoken to them since he’d taken his vow, just because he’d taken the House’s name--it didn’t stop his love, his desire to protect his sister and mother.
, he knew his oath to Cassiel, to Sherlock, depended on his readiness.
"You have the right of it," Irene replied. "It's a rare dye, the making of which is incredibly difficult to find. I had to loan my services to a potentially questionable patron for the name of a remaining dye-maker. The last person to wear this shade was the last anguissette. It's proscribed for any but those marked by Kushiel's dart, according to the old laws."
“Oh, hell,” John breathed.
But John wasn’t budging. “You tell me. What do I want?”
God, John
The only noise is the discordant echo of a piano, bleeding through the thin walls and old lead windows of a warm-windowed house. If John focuses he can make out the shadow of the upright in the window. The sound of it makes him wonder for a moment at the person just on the other side--of the wall, of the piano--who taps one note in a pensive rhythm.
Sister Roberts’s words came to mind, then:
They stayed this way a good while, Lestrade loosening him up with fingers and sheer evil dilligence, until Sherlock came round again to begging.
But what good would that do? How could he look to Anael, or hope to build a new family and nurture it, when he’d dedicated himself to Cassiel? And was that to imply the Brotherhood didn’t serve as family enough?
“This is absurd, John,” Sherlock scowled. “What is the point of this little adventure?”
Speaking of burning in hell, here, have some references:
“I’d ask if you wanted a break--this is quite a bit of ink in one sitting--but I know better than that.” Then, thinking better of that pronouncement, he added, “Unless you need to--well. Salute Naamah in your own way? Were I not a married man, I’d consider offering a hand, darling.”
Sherlock jerked his head away from his mobile, as if it were possible to send his incredulous expression over the line by sheer force of will. “For what, exactly?”
“Sherlock,” John murmured. When Sherlock turned to face him, John jerked his head upward, toward the stairs and the bedrooms.
Wilkerson, at this point, had tucked his head against Sherlock’s chest and traced little shapes on his skin absentmindedly. Sherlock noted he held a certain tension in his spine, his chest and shoulders--one that meant he was preparing to speak, but didn’t know what to say.
“Roll over,” John said. “Get comfortable.”
“Only you,” Sherlock gasps, body clenched tight, the precipice of orgasm barrelling toward him at breakneck speeds despite their slow dance.
Mycroft made a noncommittal noise. “I didn’t ask.”
“Listen, I don’t know what er--William has promised you, but--”
He hadn’t yelled, he hadn’t said anything Sherlock hadn’t already tried, but John had the knack of looking him in the eye, of selling it with every ounce of his former station.
Sherlock tipped forward and crawled across the mattress, maintaining eye contact with her as he paused, hovering right next to the shaft of her jutting cock. Up close, it quivered with each breath Sally took, each minute adjustment to her posture or position. Honestly, Sherlock was torn between reveling in its silicone texture and taste, or pretending her cock was flesh and blood. He had no idea which he’d rather more, only that he wanted to please Sally.
Belgravia at half-three in the morning stretched long and quiet; even on a Saturday night its residents were far too restrained to indulge in raucousness that late. Above him the light pollution stained the night sky purple and hazy; shadows coalesced and pooled in alleys and overhangs, beneath bushes and across stoops shrouded by porticoes.
What a load of bollocks.
“You idiot,” Sherlock hissed, quickly fishing his phone out of his pocket. “When you didn’t say anything, I thought you were okay!”
As he stood face to face with John, Sherlock refrained from reaching out of an irrational fear of shattering the moment.
“Just what?”
The flat was paid for, but not by John. Mycroft Holmes undoubtedly had something to do with it, and John figured it was Mycroft’s way of trying to rid himself of guilt, which John intended to let him. The man deserved to feel guilty, and at least John still had a place to stay because of that.
“Hello, John.”
The sound of John’s voice breaking caused Sherlock’s breath to hitch.
Putting her bags into the cab that was waiting outside, Mrs. Hudson informed him of the food she’d left in the fridge for him. Waving politely at Mrs. Turner, John turned to Mrs. Hudson one last time.
’ and John deleted it with a roll of his eyes.
John sighed, tapping his fingers against his knee. He used to be so patient once, but now... Now time couldn’t move fast enough. He stood up, made tea, rearranged the books on the shelves, looking out the window, only to sit back in his chair again.
Sherlock pulled John closer. John’s arms were wrapped around Sherlock’s neck, and his head were buried in Sherlock’s shoulder. For a while the only sound in the flat was their breathing, as they were silently being thankful to have the other person back in their lives.
“John Watson, not only are you pathetic, but you’re now also talking to yourself.”
"And you'll always be?"
“Harry, how about you call me once you’re sober? I really don’t want to have this conversation with you when you’re drunk,” John answered tightly.
John nodded into Sherlock’s chest, still smiling. He didn’t think he’d ever be able to stop now. Sherlock was back with him now, and it was all John really needed. “Yeah, it is.”
"Let it go. Let me go."
Brett pointed at the book John had looked at. A book on contacting spirits, how to talk to them, and ultimately how to let go and move on. Frowning, John stepped back.
“Excactly. You’re always drunk. You’re not even trying to be sober anymore.”
“A story of misery will always be more attractive,” John said dully. “I suppose people feel better when others suffer.”
“You have fun at your sister’s place. I’ll look after Baker Street for you,” he smiled, accepting a kiss on the cheek from her.
"If I remember correctly, which I do,
John gasped as Sherlock took him in his hand, and continued to kiss John’s neck as he slowly started pumping the doctor. Heat was building, and John rocked into Sherlock’s hand, desperately seeking more friction. Pre-cum was used as lubricant, and the pace of Sherlock’s hand quickened considerably.
It hurt now. Not a lot, but enough so that John panted involuntarily. The alarm in Sherlock’s eyes made John frown. ”Stop looking like that!”
Sherlock’s mouth found John’s again, swallowing the cry John let out as he came to completion under the touch of Sherlock. He was kissed through it, heated kisses turning into languid and soothing ones. Something was murmured, but John didn’t register any words. Just the vibrato of Sherlock’s voice.
John interrupted himself with a small, self-deprecating laugh, “
“What the hell do you mean you’re not coming over for Christmas?” Harry slurred angrily into the phone.
“You’ll miss your train, Mrs. Hudson,” John gently ushered her towards the door.
“I’m always drunk,” she tried to sound proud of it, and John grimaced in disgust and pity for her.
“The Ghost of Christmas past?” John asked, slightly amused of himself. Not that it made any sense.
John weakly huffed a laugh. Right. “And then what?”
, and not
“No more of that nonsense. It’s Christmas, no time for such awful news,” Mrs. Hudson chippered. “Why can’t the news ever focus on the good things? It really is beyond me, doctor Watson, it really is.”
Out of all of them, finally kissing John Watson had been an unforeseen, although long awaited surprise.
Surprisingly, he wept for himself, too. For the things he’d experienced at Jim Moriarty’s hands, the torment of being torn between lust and loathing. He knew there should be no question, there should be no what if, but that was the worst of his curse, and it would always be inside him.
A knock at the door tore Sherlock from his thoughts, and the violin squeaked in protest. John grimaced as he poked his head in the door.
His heart fluttered and the pulse in his ears stuttered like the wings of the dove he’d released in the temple a year before. A small, still centre warmed his core: he was there with Naamah’s blessing.
Scene after gruesome scene becomes apparent rather quickly: countless gardens lay desecrated in flour and toilet paper; very few faux spiderwebs, fake ghosts, or balsa-wood tombstones are left intact. The gory innards of many tasteful pumpkins are splattered on stoops. Innocent jack-o-lanterns lay in pieces, their once-joyful smiles now fragmented and stretched like the death-grins of skulls. One house had been home to a cheerful scarecrow--but the poor thing had been decapitated, removed from its post, and impaled through its abdomen, its head resting atop its body like a grim spoil of war.
Sherlock was too flustered to even try to lie, so he squeezed his eyes shut beneath the blindfold, preparing for whatever may come. “No, sir. I’m--this is my first since I’ve sworn to Naamah but--”
Irene sat back in her chair, looking pleased. “Chamberlain, hm? That explains a good deal.”
She nodded quickly. "Of course. I can tell you anything you need to know."
Sherlock paused. “Yes, maybe that would be good.”
"We're not talking about me," John said, dragging Sherlock back along the trail. "We're talking about you and your odd obsession with bees, despite the fact that you're allergic to them. I swear if any of those little flying death traps come near you I''ll..."
"They caught the killer."
“You turn me on so much. I’ve wanted to do this for a while now but I never knew if you wanted…” John was mumbling between kisses to his neck.
He nodded slowly. "You're right. Molly, I want you to know that I've always trusted you. I know that I can be honest with you. I'm not great, that's the truth."
“You’re lucky, you know. I wouldn’t do this for just anybody.”
That night, Sherlock found himself actually looking forward to going to sleep next to John. It was strange to think about, because the truth was he never wanted to share a bed with any of his other acquaintances or co-workers. But John was different. John was an exception. And having him nearby made Sherlock feel comforted in a way. He slept peacefully, knowing he was safe with John by his side.
It hurt a little, because spit wasn’t really proper lubrication, but he didn’t care. He enjoyed the pain, knowing that what they were doing was wrong and still not wanting to stop.
"Why? Why would I ask you how you felt about me moving in with my wife? That's what people do."
"You... You're asking me out? To be your...boyfriend?"
Mycroft shook his head. "I don't know. He won't talk to me. I thought that maybe you could get through to him."
"Take a break," John suggested. "Try to enjoy this vacation at least a little bit."
John sighed again. “Can I say no?”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, caught off guard by the suggestion. "What?" Perhaps it was a joke and he wasn't understanding the humor. That sometimes happened to him with certain people, though he and John usually did a good job of understanding each other.
Sherlock had always been aware of how handsome John Watson was. They’d known each other and been living together for three months now. For three months, Sherlock had been changing and becoming his truest self. There were the expected changes, voice becoming deeper, a little facial hair sprouting, and the unexpected… John looked hotter to him than ever.
“Do you want to be on top?” John asked.
Sherlock fell asleep with a smile on his face for the first time in his life. He didn't know what would happen with John in the future but for now he was happy.
Mycroft’s eyes widen with realization. He has deduced something about the two men of 221B. “You had sex.”
He pushed John down on the couch, kissing him all over. Every single inch of John was absolutely perfect, scars and all. John’s breath hitched when Sherlock teased his nipples with his tongue. He moaned and it was the sexiest thing Sherlock had ever heard.
“I know,” Sherlock said.
"I know you," John said. "It would be so easy." He leaned in like he planned to kiss him. It was startling, yet he couldn't pull away. Then John leaned back again and laughed.
Sherlock isn’t quite as bothered by his brother’s statement. He makes a face at him and says “Yes, so?”
John pulled him along, pushing him down on the bed. He unbuttoned Sherlock's shirt and kissed one of his perfect pale collarbones. He was so gorgeous.
Sherlock doesn’t know what to expect. He hasn’t been invited to very many weddings. He carefully chooses his best suit and runs his fingers through his curls, checking his reflection in the mirror. What would John think when he saw him? It seemed like it had been ages since they’d last spoken.
Sherlock gasped as the cold water hit him in the face and drenched his clothes. He weakly attempted to shove John away, feeling kind of like he was drowning.
"Did you see him or speak to him the day he went missing? Did he go fishing with your son?"
The text is from Sherlock and John expects something about a case, or an experiment, or a reminder not to forget to pick up milk on the way home. The text message contains none of those things. It's nothing immediately alarming. It simply says 'I am bored to death'- SH'
Sherlock was glad for once to have his brother around. As annoying as Mycroft was, he could be useful in a moment like this. And maybe he wasn’t the worst person in the world, because he did clearly care enough to help his brother and John with this problem called Mary.
"Your shoulder," Sherlock pointed out. "It's hurting you."
"What caused it?"
“The park, not too far from here.”
“Do you want to have sex with me again?”
John can barely believe this is happening. This day has been absolutely insane and it's only getting crazier. He and Sherlock are kissing!
"No, I just want to take a walk around town on my own. I need to clear my head, really focus on this missing person case." He couldn't let this baseball through his fingers like the other. How could he have failed? He couldn't afford any distractions.
“Shit…” John mutters. “Do you…”
"What?" John stopped and turned back to see what he was seeing.
"What does John's family think of you? Do they know about you? You're not nervous, John? Embarrassed by my brother? What do you see in my brother?"
"What?" John seemed startled by the sudden statement.
"I'm close..." John warns, doing his best to hold on.
"Probably keeping them as trophies," Sherlock suggested, just to make John happy.
"John," Sherlock complained.
"No, of course not," Mycroft said slowly, clearly unsure what to believe.
"Strangulation marks on her neck," Sherlock pointed out the bruising inflicted by the killer's hands.
"This is all Mycroft's fault."
"Why were you kissing her?" Sherlock demanded.
She smiled. "I know what you really are, Sherlock Holmes," she said. "You are nothing but a junkie who solves crimes to get high."
He hadn't meant for this to get out of hand. It was all supposed to stay between them and his family. It was never meant to leak out all over the internet.
“I don’t know what you mean,” Sherlock said.
"Yes," Sherlock says breathlessly. "Please John."
Sherlock sighed. As John swam and ducked under the water, Sherlock stripped and hurried to join his friend in the water, realizing that there was no escape. John swam over to him and splashed him playfully. He was grinning and so happy that Sherlock didn't mind having to stop working for a little while. It was worth it to see John this way. Sherlock wanted to stay in this moment forever, alone with John, carefree in the sunshine.
He got on his hands and knees over John, kissing him all over, tracing his muscles and the various battle scars with his fingertips. He pinched one of John’s nipples lightly and John groaned.
John made a sandwich for himself and for Sherlock for lunch, which Sherlock took to be a sort of peace offering. "I've been thinking," he said. "About a lot of things."
"I'm feeling ill," he said, hurrying past John. "The heat is getting to me. I need to lie down."
They joined the girl at a table in the back where she was sipping an iced tea, pausing occasionally to pour in numerous sugar packets.
"I'm in love with you. I have been for a while. But you were so happy to be going out with Jim that I didn't say anything. I just wanted you to be happy."
“I gave him the cash,” she continued. “We smoked some weed. Then I went home.”
There were tears in Sherlock's eyes when he looked up at him. "I'm in love with you."
Mary was a special woman. She was a smart woman. And she was a woman who knew her husband.
He gave her a quick kiss on the lips then grabbed his jacket and headed outside. The car pulled up a few minutes later and took him back to Baker Street. He had no idea what to expect when he stepped inside the familiar apartment. Mycroft greeted him, looking worried.
They hugged goodbye. Sherlock wanted to puke.
“John,” he tried to warn him, quickly becoming overwhelmed by all of the pleasure. It felt so very good. It was building and building and he was going to explode. “John!”
“A little before noon.”
“Have you ever been with anyone?” John questioned.
They walked inside and Mrs. Holmes brought them hot coco and homemade cookies.
He laughed at her defiantly, because he didn’t want to let her win, but inside he felt something breaking.
"No, I could never hate you Sherlock. I love you so much."
Nervous? Shouldn’t he be excited?
"Yes," Sherlock answers. "You are truly amazing John."
John sighed and wiped a hand across his forehead. "It's hot as balls out here."
“We have to hug often and be very happy. That will make us look like we’re boyfriends.”
"How often did you see each other in real life?"
"What does that even mean? Did you ask him to clarify?"
He raised an eyebrow. "Sad?"
John frowned, silent and lost in thought.
"Short dark hair and he was wearing a hunting style jacket."
John kisses him again and retrieves a condom.
“Fuck… Sherlock… “ This feels amazing. John can’t hold back anymore. He fucks Sherlock hard and fast.
John moved quickly, undoing Sherlock’s belt and unzipping his trousers. He pulled Sherlock’s erection free from the constraints of his underwear and stroked him slowly. He studied Sherlock’s perfect pale cock, flushed red with arousal, leaking precome eagerly. He ran his thumb lightly over the tip and Sherlock cried out loudly.
"I'm sorry, Mrs. Holmes, but no one can make Sherlock do anything. Not even me. He's stubborn." John finished off some freshly baked bread, some steamed vegetables, then devoured a piece of chocolate cake for desert.
"Why shouldn't we have sex? You don't want to?"
"You are brilliant," Sherlock told John as they made their way back to their bedroom. John sat on the bed and grinned.
And now Mycroft looked hurt but it felt good to Sherlock. He wanted his brother to feel hurt the same way he'd hurt him.
John hadn’t meant to offend him. He couldn’t deny that he’d thought about having sex with Sherlock. But he never thought Sherlock would actually be interested in doing that with him. He still didn’t really know what all of this meant and if he’d regret it in the morning, but it seemed to make sense currently in his alcohol fogged brain. They were best friends. Sherlock trusted him. He could help him. Why shouldn’t he do it? He couldn’t find a single reason to say no.
This was too much. John wasn't seriously suggesting that he would want to... with Molly? "John, this is ridiculous," he complained.
John was angry because it was Sherlock’s fault Mary was dead. And John was angry at himself because when he should have been enjoying his married life with Mary he was too busy sending late night text messages to Sherlock. Everything was Sherlock’s fault.
"I hate it when you do this," John said without looking at him. "Its a waste of your mental skills. You don't even care that you're ruining yourself for everyone. Sherlock, people need you."
“Are you bothered by that or by what she said?” John asked him.
“You are,” John said, nodding in agreement.
"Trying to keep my mind sharp," Sherlock replied.
"Its complicated," John answered.
What did that even mean? It was a strange thing to say to someone.
What a silly question. “Yes, of course you can.”
John walked over now. "You failed, Sherlock. You're just a joke. You're not a genius. You can't solve any cases. You're not a puzzle solver, you're just a drama queen."
She shrugged. "Everything was normal."
They lay together for a while just catching their breath and processing what had happened.
"I'm not taking his side. He could have handled this situation a lot better. He shouldn't have sent you a text message. But I don't like seeing you so upset."
"You're a good man, Sherlock," John continued. "I'm so proud of you. Your life hasn't been easy, but you always stay true to who you are. That takes a lot of strength."
"You didn't do this because you were bored." It wasn't a question.
This gives John a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach and his heart starts to beat faster. This wasn't like Sherlock at all...
John really was slow.
They couldn't very well sleep in separate rooms when they were pretending to be boyfriends.
"Heading down the dirt road by his house towards the woods."
“We’ll probably have to hold hands,” John said. “And flirt.”
John was outside busy gathering the perfect wood and kindling for building a campfire. "Why are you doing that?" Sherlock questioned him. "We don't need a fire for anything."
"Leave me alone. Go home to Mary. I just need my drugs. Mycroft wouldn't let me call my dealer."
"I chose to live with her because she's my wife. I'm still your friend."
"But you weren't there all this time for that case, were you?"
John laughed, laying next to him, rubbing his thighs which were trembling slightly. “Yeah, it was perfect.”
"Jesus," John said, automatically grabbing his friend by the wrist and pulling him back away from the nest. "Why are you always so fascinated by dangerous things?"
Sherlock caught sight of something on the counter, a lighter. Not cigarettes, he didn't smell nicotine. "What did you talk about?"
John turned and was greeted by his ex-girlfriend. "Mary Morstan? I should be asking you the same question."
"Yes."
“Well, I don’t make much money working at the mall, but whenever I have some extra cash I’d hit up. It was my birthday and I’d gotten some money as a gift so I texted Braden that night.”
"Yes, I did," he shrugged simply. What else was he supposed to do with the fish anyway? It was much too small to eat.
"Let's get you to bed before our parents see you," Mycroft suggested.
"Two months."
"Let's go for a swim," John suggested, suddenly stripping his shirt off and leaving it in the dirt on his way towards the lake.
John smirked. “Yeah, sure. Do you have any lube?”
Suddenly they were at the edge of a waterfall. "You will fall!" Moriarty shouted and he laughed as he pushed John over the edge of the waterfall.
"You've never understood. You never even realized it when it was right in front of your face the whole time."
"John Watson?" a female voice called out. "What are you doing here?"
So Sherlock did it again, using his teeth very lightly to nip at him, wondering how John would react to each new sensation, if he would like being bitten or if it was too rough for him. John didn’t tell him to stop so he kept going, doing the same to the opposite nipple.
When he finally walked to the dining area he found Mycroft there eating lunch. Anger flooded him and he burst. "Why would you do this?" He demanded. "Are you jealous of my happiness? Do you enjoy hurting me? You say you want to protect me but all you do is ruin everything!"
Sherlock moaned. “John, I…”
"The article. Don't tell me you haven't seen it."
"There was a case there," Sherlock insisted like a petulant child.
John was actually a very skilled kisser. He knew what to do and where to touch to get the best response. It was kind of impressive really. John was a doctor and knew the human body well. Or maybe it was just all the practice he had. John had several sexual romantic and sexual partners in his life time where as Sherlock only had one. He had Irene and no one could ever replace her.
Sherlock didn’t have friends, he only had one- John Watson.
Sherlock moved his attention back to John’s nipples, sucking gently on one and flicking his tongue over it.
As he ate with John, the sky above them continued to darken with the approaching storm and Sherlock lost himself in thought.
"This is how I want you to remember me," she continued. "The woman who beat you."
“John… I can’t…”
John smiled and nodded in agreement. “Yeah, it was. Let’s go to bed.” He pulled Sherlock to his bed where he promptly curled up with him, letting Sherlock spoon him.
"Was that okay?" John asks him. "It felt good?"
“I begged you not to be dead.” John was pacing angrily across the living room of the baker street apartment. “I grieved for you. Two years! How could you do this to me?”
John shook his head. "That's not true. You did this because you've angry at me for being with Mary. You don't like her and acted out like a child."
"Oh..." Sherlock breathes. John's a skilled kisser. He's never had a kiss before that made him so very aroused.
"Alright," John said, nodding, resigning himself to the task ahead of him.
Sherlock had been staring at the pictures on his cell phone for over an hour now. When John finally awoke beside him, he immediately asked him "Do you think that Irene ever cheated on me?"
It was all too much for John and he found himself following Sherlock into bliss, coming in his own pants like an eager teenager.
"Maybe, I don't know. I didn't know he had another girlfriend. He never told me that."
Sherlock nodded. “Alright.” He switched positions with John, pulling him down on top of him. He lay on his back and tried to thrust against John. “Hurry.”
He had just woken up and John was already dressed and looking much too perky for it being so early still. "I do not like surprises," he said.
Sherlock smiled a little, unable to help himself. He was feeling much calmer now, trusting John to make this all work out. Things usually did work out when he trusted John. They worked well together on cases and could make this work too.
'I'm thinking of ending my life'-SH'
John was asleep wearing only his boxers and a t-shirt. The more nights they shared a bed, the more comfortable John seemed to become with this arrangement. Sherlock imagined John was used to sharing close quarters with other men after his time in the service, and probably didn't think much of being seen in his underwear. Back home at their apartment, John usually wore a robe and they didn't share a bed.
"I love you too," John told him, giving him a kiss.
If it was Sherlock telling her that they were going off to solve crimes she would have argued more, but she liked John and when he was respectable and polite she couldn't fight him. It was both annoying and amusing.
“I believe you would benefit greatly by seeking out therapy. I can refer you to several good professionals.”
Sherlock couldn’t help but laugh just a little as he leaned in to kiss John, to slide his hand down the length of John’s torso and sweep it around to meet the other at the small of his back. John pulled him closer, let out a gust of breath that went straight to Sherlock’s cock, started nibbling his lower lip. Sherlock’s eyes fluttered closed.

Dominique would risk his own fortune--or embezzle from the Banque Nationale--for one lordling’s son with whom he has no obvious connection.”

The circling stopped beside Sherlock, and deft fingers slid across his scalp. His voice uncurled like a snake in the sun: “Say it, Sherlock.”
interesting…”
Around the second chorus--if indeed it was some sort of pop song--Sherlock twirled back round to face him, still swaying, still bowing till the violin sang its enchantments just for John. But now, now Sherlock gave him a quick smirk, locking eyes with him.
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again."
On another note: some alternate titles for this chapter were:
“I want--” Sherlock panted, “I want you to fuck me the way you would, sir. I’m not here for them, only you. Only you.”
"--and it was that that led us here. We wanted something classic, clean, and a little more masculine for you, but something that still paid homage to your calling and its heritage. What do you think, Mr. Holmes?"
“Hmm?” Sherlock asks, blowing his smoke upward to avoid Billy as much as he can manage.
“Alright?”
As Sherlock came up he attempted to swallow, working throat and jaw as loosely as he dared, until molars brushed against Lestrade’s flesh.
“All right, fine. You’re on, freak.”
Where Victor had been all hard lines and sharp angles before, now his entire demeanor was curves and smooth planes.
Who said he was swooning, anyway? D’Angelines, no matter how thin the traces, appreciated beauty. It was in Sherlock’s blood to find pretty things eye-catching. It was his job, however, to make sure he was the one doing the distracting.
“I said--”
John hunched down, peered in. It was low enough he’d have to crawl on hands and knees, but he’d fit. Up ahead, her torch bounced along the stone walls. Where she’d hidden it before now, he wasn’t really sure.
He pulled the tray away, forced himself to sit up, braced by the wall, and he tucked in. The casserole, bland and greasy, was better than nothing but only barely. What had been in it originally, aside from the faint taste of something that might have been turkey at one point, he couldn’t tell. But it didn’t matter--as he chewed, he thought.
“I’ll be there. Get somewhere safe if you haven’t already.”
“It’s not as if I’ve been your favorite, either, freak.” The term, which had once been an insult Sherlock hated to hear, held a new sentimentality that almost made him smile.
“Such a
-- It's just as fucked up as you'd imagine.
He'd been taught again and again what he must do in situations such as this, but he could not find the prayers to work through to calm himself down. Only the rough warmth of his calloused hand sneaking below the sheet, slipping beneath the waistband of his pants, to grip the base of himself, that part long-denied. Even at that, his toes curled, his breath juddered like the wind was knocked out of him. Ten years, he had gone without this.
Sherlock nodded. He was eager to escape, to be alone with his thoughts, at least for a little while.
The tone in his voice was somewhere between amusement and anger. Panic frayed the edges of Sherlock’s arousal, then, certain he’d just made a grave mistake.
, his nametag read--smiled, bright white teeth against dark-tanned skin. He possessed the kind of brazen quality that bode well for Sherlock’s gamble.
“I didn’t know you wanted anyone else watching?” Sherlock rejoined.
The Good Steward, who promised life and prosperity, the faintest drop of whose blood ran in John's veins. Possibly Anael would show him the way, where Elua stifled a laugh and Cassiel fell silent to his pleas. John could choose to trust The Good Steward to lead him on the correct path, toward life and prosperity, but John still didn't know which way was which yet.
Reality, Elua, this blessing, crashed in upon him then. This was John. His John, alive and here and holding him, come to rescue him from this hell. His John, his John,
He mentally kicked himself for concocting such an asinine idea. He and John would never see eye-to-eye, and any progress towards civility would just be destroyed again the next assignation Sherlock took.
Sherlock rose and retrieved the hairbrush with his mouth, his wrists still secured to his biceps with the rope. The motion tugged at the harness, the bit that extended from his torso to the knots forming his cock ring, the taut length nestled along the cleft of his arse. He fought not to shift against it, to exploit the distracting way it bound him.
Sherlock grinned. He recognised the second half of that oath--swearing by
His words were interrupted by a woman whose pale blonde hair was pulled into a finger-wave bun, sliding over to stand quietly just within periphery. Her body language was moulded, sculpted to be as unobtrusive as possible, an ideal personal assistant. From what little Sherlock could see, she had the stamp of Cereus House all over her.
When she caught sight of him, however, she merely rolled her eyes and remained silent.
John gave himself the luxury of rolling this new truth around in his mind. It had been everything and nothing like what he might have anticipated: in turns tender and frenetic, lighthearted and serious, and every doubt met with love. There was a sense of wholeness, of rightness that John didn’t even know he’d been without. Being with Sherlock had done that.
And still--what, exactly, linked Trevor and the Chamberlains?
Sherlock nodded, and John came forward. Sherlock placed the violin on the desk, then turned to embrace John. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist, held him tightly. His solidity, his warmth, grounded Sherlock.

THE FINAL CHAPTER.
“Happy birthday!”
Without further hesitation, they plunged into the tunnel and Felippa tugged on the cubby-door, sealing them within the tomb-like escape.
If he made excuses, he might come off as too weak, which would defeat the fun of “taming him.” Then again, if he went on the offensive and accused her of this obvious no-win scenario, it was far too literal to maintain the mood, which was key. It didn’t matter that knowing the name of the thing didn’t diminish his enjoyment--the illusion empowered his patron.
--well. I’ve already got a whole slew of damning emails between Sherlock and you. It’ll only dent his reputation, but yours will be
John was thankful the kitchen was abandoned this time of night.
“Oh, you
Sherlock’s gaze bore into John, and with their foreheads touching, there was no escaping it. John understood what it felt like to have his soul stared directly into. Everything receded for a moment, the best kind of background noise as he let his heart be laid bare.
Sherlock hummed, inspected his little glass. The
he typed. Then he tossed the phone away.
“When I began researching Mr. Holmes, the one thing that became most apparent was that this--this whole business with being god-touched… it’s not the same. It’s one thing to feel the influence of Elua and the Blessed Companions, when we dedicate ourselves to their service. It’s another to be anointed before we’re even born.” He lifted a calloused hand, dropped it heavily on John’s shoulder. “I knew if anyone could meet that challenge, it would be you.”
Before Sherlock could cut himself off, he saw the fire, the concern in John’s eyes die until his expression was stone-cold once more.
, after all. “You have personal matters to attend to. I’ll just see myself out.”
He shot a glance at John, who’d been stone-faced since that morning at Jim’s a little over a week before. There was something strained there, and though Sherlock had heard him regularly up at all hours, bumping in his room, the recalcitrance felt like it went beyond physical tiredness.
“Ah, Liu,” Sherlock said, slipping into character as the harried hostess came their way. His shoulders relaxed, his voice warmed, the insincere edges of a smile tinting his words. “My friend and I--we wondered if your back room might be available? I would be happy to pay my compliments to you and your mother. Is she in tonight?” Sherlock palmed a quid from his trouser pocket and held out his hand, which the hostess caught in a polite shake.
Maybe a different pantheon altogether. There were always the tales of Hellenic deities; Jim would make a devastating dark god. Hades, perhaps?
for general coherence and awesomeness. <3 <3 <3
John could guess that he was likely formulating ways in which they could appear completely casual and occupied, but that would still leave him free to watch the crowd. He wondered, though, at a Sherlock who was less than cool and collected and at the helm of his own scheme.
John nodded, unsure of what to say to that. Of course he had. He would honour that last remaining part of his oath until his very last breath.
of unescorted servants come here to mingle. I’ll text you to join me just as soon as I can. Trust me on this.”
After an hour, his lips and cheeks were pricked and bleeding from rose thorns where he’d bent to pick the stems up with his teeth. Every joint ached, every muscle felt the strain of the morning's task. Sweat rose and collected, rolling in tingling little trails from his hairline. The rough wood-grain was hell on his knees, and he'd have rope-burn for a week. He was so hard it hurt--and of course, the wily bitch had anticipated that when she’d rigged up some of the rope as a makeshift cock ring, keeping him desperate.
Each noise, each movement, filtered through golden syrup until time stood infuriatingly still. The white and red lights of nearby traffic, the distant chatter of people, all barely discernible. He craned his neck, looking in each direction along the pavement, trying to discern which route John had taken.
“Lovely girl, aren’t you?” John murmured to the horse as he worked the large hand-sized brush across her spotted flank. “Shame they don’t take you out more.”
Then John tugged the blanket away, until Sherlock was only half-covered. Sherlock scowled. He would be
Sherlock felt the hollowness of the words coming out of his mouth at the end, every fibre of him praying that further investigation led them away from the Houses of the Night Court, away from D’Angeline implication. It was too close on the heels of Frédérique nò Bryony’s implication, to the bombing and D’Arbos’s murder. He prayed his motivation wasn’t as transparent as it felt.
But here in the self-indulgent lap of the city’s most privileged, John couldn’t imagine anything further from that sort of devotion. Not to some scrawny tart who
It would make sense--the servants that went missing after murders connected to them. Frederique nó Bryony, Cecily Noualt... Was he too late to save them?
John had seen a good deal of unpleasant things in his day--he’d opted to take rudimentary emergency medical training during his rearing within the walls of the Brotherhood; he’d pored over the same manuals and anatomical studies as his peers as they dissected what each point of damage resulted in for an assailant, what it might mean for their ward.
Jim let his fingertips trail down farther, until they slipped below his ballocks, delving into the cleft of Sherlock’s arse. “Tell me, how were the De Fhirze twins? I hate that I missed your little show.”
For his part, a knot of anxiety had twisted itself somewhere in Sherlock’s middle as the train had drawn farther from home, as each step led them from the station to the temple doors.
“Hush, you. I’m just trying to get you out of your head. You’ve been unbearable this week.”
Sherlock willed himself not to let the dish in his hand rattle as he stacked it atop its mates, his heart a quicker thud in his chest. So Jim had noticed his attempts.
Sherlock hummed thoughtfully, spinning the little flower between forefinger and thumb. It reminded him of the night before, of allowing himself to indulge in the sentimentality that kept seeping in from the edges of his life. A hug from Victor, a tiny ‘x’ at the end of a text from Sally. An unspoken message from Jim that could only allude to partnership once Sherlock made his
Check your tag updates, kiddos, especially those "Additional" tags! :D :D :D :D : D
Many might think it a vain thing to hang the stars on a modeling career, one launched in a London pleasure-house. But it was a means, and for Cecily it was the only one. She had plans, so many plans, but all of them started right there in Camellia House.
There was no point in lying. Ames had already heard their reasoning, and Sherlock decided it would be more expeditious to enlist Ames’s help rather than his censure.
And still the waves roared on in the dying goddess’s anguish. His own never joined it, or so he hoped.
(Hell, just leaving a comment in general makes my day.)
John made a noise, burying his face in Sherlock’s shoulder to suppress a fit of giggling, which made Sherlock laugh, too. They stayed together like that a moment, clinging together in adrenaline-soaked mirth, and
“The place is a mess, sorry,” came Lestrade’s gruff voice as he closed the door behind them. He flashed Sherlock a smile, studying his guest once more before he chuckled. “You’re sure we haven’t met before? You look familiar...”
For a second Sherlock’s heart stopped. “How could you possibly know that?”
He rose, stiff and muddy, and studied Elua’s stone face as he stretched sore muscles. His shoulder ached from having slept on it in the night, but it didn’t matter. Elua gazed down all the same, his eyes kind and his mouth smiling. Time could not erase what Elua gave so freely.
Sherlock rose from his spot on the sofa, undaunted. He closed the textbook, tucked it under his arm. “Lorraine Carver. Tell me.”
“Some men have such an overblown sense of honour,” Jim said as he poured. Clear liquid so thick it looked the consistency of maple syrup ran from the bottle into the two little glasses. “It must be difficult for those who aren’t Naamah’s service to understand her call. And you’ve got a live-in one. Is he a little bit in love with you, do you think?”
Just on the other side of the wall, music thumped, surely loud and raucous in the suite, but little more than the whisper of a rhythmic bump in the hallway--a true testament to the soundproofing that went into the rooms at The Berkeley. More pressing were the soft footfalls of dress shoes and heels on the plush carpeting, the delighted hush of voices moving to and fro, their owners all in the midst of or anticipating the evening at hand. Occupants entered and exited the other rooms along their hallway, but John stood guard at the main door of the de Fhirze suite after watching Sherlock slip in through the servant’s entry.
“--then look beneath the padding on the bottom of the box.”
He wrestled the thought until eventually he decided it was a fluke, crossed wires and nothing more.
John looked away. Sullen, prone to fits of rage. He’d scared his bunkmates, those first few months. No one wanted to be partnered with him. Not John Watson, who pulled no punches and let all that rage flow through him and right into the flesh of his sparring partners.
Sherlock slipped his jacket from his shoulders, folded it neatly and laid it across the back of a nearby chair. Chin still down, he lifted his eyes to hers as his fingers found the first button of his shirt. One button, then the next, each inch revealing a column of deep plum satin and steel boning. Then his trousers, underneath which hid lacy black panties that hugged his arse
Sally gasped, pushing her hips up to meet him, her cock trapped between their bellies, and soon they found a rhythm, a give-and-take like none they’d found in the two years they’d worked together. Sally clawed at the clasps of his corset, impatient finally with the lack of exposed skin. It was difficult, but she managed, and the relief from Sherlock’s midsection felt like heaven--he didn’t realise how much pressure had been exerted on his ribs, his abdomen, until at last he was free.

. “Patience.”
The memory of wrestling Marcus Smith to the ground, Sherlock opening himself up for potential injury to spur a set of twin daggers into action; the shock of shared laughter in the aftermath, a darkened winter street.
With that she dropped the brush onto the table beside the vase and undid the flies of her trousers, just enough to reveal that she wore nothing beneath but her own skin. A trimmed thatch of dark hair glinted in the sunlight.
It was enough, for now, simply to enjoy it while it lasted.
What if John had found him dead in the cell, a broken heap in a dark room, after having come so far, having fought so hard?
, he told himself. He’d do nothing without John’s input. They were partners. Whatever came next, they’d face it together. All he could do was to trust that Kushiel would keep them safe, and that Elua would light their path.
Lorenzo and Felippa did the same, shedding their coats to give to Cecily and Frédérique, before Lorenzo nodded toward the back, toward a tiny sacristy, the once-ornate door hanging crooked and desolate on rusted hinges in a rotting doorframe.
John rose, and Sherlock fought not to follow him with his eyes. John crossed the cabin, took up the phone installed on the wall there.
ON HIS WAY home he walks past a small chapel, an ancient heap of stone and coloured glass leaning away from the street, banked in the shadow of a massive evergreen. There is a cross on the heavy wooden door.
He blamed

Sherlock clenched his teeth together, only somewhat more sheltered from the wind and cold, and hunched as close to the arch of votives, one for Elua and each Companion. He took warmth from it, strength from it, and bared his soul in prayer.
Sherlock could feel John’s eyes burning into his back, but Jim’s spicy scent muddled his brain.
“Such a simple thing. But it goes deeper, doesn’t it? You wouldn’t have picked it unless the word meant something too precious to forget, too beloved or too painful, efficiently jarring from the sexual identity. Possibly both. The name wasn’t a person, wasn’t a thing. A pet?”
John’s hand hovered over the keyboard, his mind stalled in deliberation. He had not yet confessed the most shameful way in which his feelings toward Sherlock had first manifest. The black little cursor blinked on the screen, as patient as it was judgemental.
“That sounds good,” John murmured. He craned his neck, gave Sherlock a light kiss.
Sister Roberts leaned forward on her desk, raising her laced fingers to touch her thumbs to her lips. “You appear frustrated by this whole situation,” she noted. “Why? Why use it to hide your fear?”
John wasted no time with his daggers, drew his gun instead.
Just then the door leading outside creaked open, and John appeared in the doorway, his skin flushed from exertion.
John and Greg are wrestling a second- and third-year and--
“Am I?” Moriarty leaned back, mild as ever. “I doubt it. I certainly wouldn’t, not a devoted Cassiline intent on keeping his sacred vigil. But it’s only the lesser of two evils, I think, for anyone who’d abandon their post.”
“Good so far?” John asked, smoothing a hand down Sherlock’s spine. Then came the peculiar relief as John’s fingers brushed along his back in random places, picking away bits of thorn that had gotten stuck in the shallows of Sherlock’s skin.
“So you thought you could seduce me, hm? Let me get good and worked up, and then blackmail me into letting you behind the crime tape?” Another blow landed in the same place, and the fire in Sherlock’s veins threatened to immolate him.
Sherlock thought, and easily dismissed it.
“Remember your signale. Three fingers.”
For an excruciating, tempting second Sherlock considered sitting up and returning the touch, but it seemed… far too intimate that way. Instead he rolled over to glare as he grasped John’s wrist and plucked those fingers from his hair  When he looked up to gauge John’s reaction, he was met with neutrality before an impish smile broke across John’s face.
hungry, but still. He didn’t want to be here, surrounded by serene smiles or the stern, judgemental glares of Cassiline guardsmen. He just wanted solitude.
“Now,” Jim said, “I’m curious to see what Kushiel’s servant and Irene Adler’s creature will do on his own. Surprise me.”
“I want to kiss you,” John said, his breath another warm gust of air shared between them. “All you have to do is say yes.”
“Tall, dark, with a red petal in his eye?” The sort of smile Emile offered John now looked just shy of besotted.
In case you've missed it, chapters 22, 24, & 26 are new John chapters since The Great Conjoining (of this story and
“I don’t--”
Jim giggle.
I can’t advise you on Mr. Moriarty. Keep your faith and listen to your instincts, but do not let your prejudice cloud your judgements. I know it must be difficult. Naamah was the most shameless of all the Misbegotten. I will pray for you, my brother.
.” Her words made John look back up at her. “That’s the first tenet, isn’t it? Elua’s first blessing?”
The man leaned up from where he straddled John, drawing back to punch. John bucked, catching him in the groin
to crop up, pardon my pun, in the last several centuries. What proof do you have?”
Once inside, Sherlock pounced.
“Cassiel chose Elua in favour of his own heavenly father, Adonai. He abandoned Heaven to remain on earth, ever at Elua’s side. He chose to damn his own soul to hell by handing his knife to Elua. Who is to say that Cassiel’s love was only that of a protector for a ward?” She breathed deep, her eyes bright with unshed tears. “What I believe--what we teach in Siovale--is that Cassiel’s love was pure because he loved him with his whole heart, with every fibre. We believe that Elua and the other Companions  were not The Misguided, the way Cassilines think. It’s arrogant for us to suppose we know better than the gods.” Her smile was sweet as she said it, gentle. “The other Companions shared their love with any that would share their bed, but Cassiel was content to devote himself only to Elua. All we know for certain is that the nature of that devotion was never commented upon in our holy books.”
“Lorenzo?” she asked.
John hit send before he changed his mind. He stood and stretched, checked the time. He had just enough time to grab a shower before they left for the assignation. And though it still sent tremors of unease through his core, John felt calmer than ever he had in the hours leading up to any of Sherlock’s other assignations. That in itself was a blessing.
John had finally come to his senses, then.
“Feeling better, then?” John asks, voice soft so near his ear still.
Sherlock had an easy way out, he knew. He’d finally win this ridiculous bet and be done with it, but he’d sacrifice this new development, the one where John laid his hands on him in ways that left Sherlock’s ears buzzing. He met John’s eye and didn’t blink.
“Then you’d be correct,” Mycroft shot back. “But I still have no desire to tell you. Let the man explain himself.”
Still, it left Sherlock reeling from the third about face to happen in as many minutes. Jim always found new ways to keep him on his back foot, to retain the lead in this dance of theirs.
Easier said than done when intoxicated, John finds. Has yet to find that familiar bush of black hair or hear that deep voice. Sherlock isn’t in the dining room, the kitchen, sitting room, or any of the toilets. He isn’t even out on the stoop.
Sherlock stood, paced the room.
“Christ, love, you weren’t kidding, were you?” His tone was exasperated but not unkind. Sherlock looked up to see Lestrade staring down at him.
?” With a wink he swung open Amelia’s door and departed.
That night Irene would host a party, a small do with hand-selected guests, and the main event would be auctioning off Sherlock’s debut as a servant of Naamah.
If he could overpower the guards, maybe, he could find a boat, make his escape. But would he regain his strength before then?
About halfway through, Connie reappeared to refill their drinks, and it wasn’t until John was halfway through his fresh coffee that he realised the taste--which was something bordering on amazing; he certainly wouldn’t have expected cheap diner coffee to taste so well-made--was in fact fully caffeinated.
The dagger circled end over end, caught him in the join of his shoulder. He screamed, dropped to his knees.
He’d gone through evening meditation and prayer, and availed himself of this precious free-time to watch the match. Well. The television was on, at least.
“Ma’am, I have questions I must ask him that a mother may not want to hear, nor may he be willing to answer if you are in here.”
John flashed him an impressed grin. “There’s an app for that, too?”
But more important were the time-sensitive nature of the crime scene and the imperative that Sherlock not go out on cases without John to protect him.
“That’s a wide variety,” John whispered. “Which one do you need most?”
“Sherlock.”
... I said
Irene grinned as she tucked her feet in and swiveled to sit up. She propped her elbows on her knees, looking for all the world like a schoolgirl. “Now
door to find the man himself leaning against the darkened doorframe, arms crossed over his broad chest. For half a second Sherlock considered Ames’s bulk, how that
Well, that was somewhat unexpected, but Sherlock couldn’t say he was entirely surprised. Had Jim known already about Amelia’s financial duress? “Ah, not necessary. I’m paid up through my House.”
Eventually Sherlock seemed to find whatever he’d come for--though why it was a sodding textbook John couldn’t fathom. But it was not his place to question, merely to stand guard as Sherlock sat himself as the focal point of the room, intent on reading said book until their unwitting host returned.
Sherlock grumbled in affirmation as he plodded down the stairs.
“Indeed.”
He’d only been fifteen when Sister Roberts named him Kushiel’s Dart, this embodiment of his justice.
Sherlock froze. He knew the practice existed, and the rudiments of it, but it had been largely glossed over as a very rare occurrence, something one patron in a million would be interested in giving or receiving.
“Use your tongue.”
“Sherlock?”
Sister Roberts smiled, serene and thoughtful as she studied the mouthy teen before her. Her deep blue eyes raked over Sherlock until he felt she could peek within the cracks of his personality, suss out every last one of his faults. For a moment Sherlock wondered if this was how other people felt when he shot off deductions about them in the middle of the dining hall at school. When she caught and held his gaze, he couldn’t breathe.
Sherlock blinked hastily and reached for the teapot. He busied himself with the safety of making his cup, and tucked into breakfast rather more earnestly than he had done in quite a while. For a few minutes they ate in silence, and Sherlock spent the time analyzing all the different possible outcomes this particular situation held.
“A gift from Daddy. I’ll make D’Angeline blood pure again, just for you. You know, Daniel L’Envers is making a special trip to London, right on your birthday! I saved the London Embassy for last on purpose. I will topple empires, just for you.” Jim ghosted his lips across the stubble of Sherlock’s cheek, that damned spicy scent flooding his brain, nearly eclipsing the pain, the horror. "Honey, just wait 'til you see me in a crown."
# # # # #
“Of course you would, Sherlock.”
“No, I said. I do not know who this person is, and I won’t if you ask me a hundred more times.” The heat in Victor’s words read like so much frustration. “But if you’re a--consulting detective does that mean you’re investigating it?”
In the waning hour before dawn, the prospect of walking until they found a cab somewhere between Ames’s studio and their home was completely undesirable. John did his best not to knuckle his eyes in exhaustion. If he was worn out, Sherlock was likely to drop at any moment. John kept Sherlock in the corner of his eye, taking note of the bluish smudges beneath bloodshot eyes, the way Sherlock hid himself further and further in his coat, likely cold from his tiredness. As it was, Sherlock had set out on a meandering ramble just to keep himself awake, though whether or not he knew it was that, John wasn’t sure.
When John looked down to the body, he understood why.
He could see their twined futures spooling out before him, from this moment onward: while John himself would remain celibate, dedicated, Sherlock might take a lover, a partner--who knew? But John was certain by means he didn’t quite fathom, that he would come to give that same level of care and dedication to whomever Sherlock chose--provided Elua saw fit to steer them both clear of that bastard Moriarty--to any children should that come along.
Sherlock knew where he wasn’t wanted. He wasn’t going to inflict his presence on John.
He made his exit as the remaining guests murmured to themselves, picking at the remainders of their entrees. Sherlock sprung into action, circling the table to quietly clear the plates away. When his trolley was laden, he rolled it to the kitchen, bent on retrieving the dessert for the evening, a light pear-and-brie tart.
*rolls eyes* Let it also be said I'm foolishly doing final copy-edits while half-asleep and headachey. If you caught any errors, feel free to point them out.
A barrel-full of thanks to the ongoing support you all have shown me. I can't express what it means to me. I am flabbergasted and only hope I can continue to live up to your expectations.
I hate that this chapter is so short, but I absolutely needed to make sure you knew as soon as possible. Think of the last chapter and this one as the last third of TRF. We get the fall, and some of the graveyard scene before the break.
“Say it again,” John intoned. “I love to hear you.”
He knew--could feel in his veins--that this was exactly how to please Jim best, damn any onlookers. His heart beat harder for it, until he could taste desire on his tongue, thick and potent like honey and blood.
Sherlock turned to John then; he looked horrified.
“Language,” Brother Rocaille snapped.
For maybe the first time in his life, Sherlock’s mouth was actually hanging open.
“Brother Watson,” Jim said instead. “I have made absolutely sure you’ll be provided for tonight. I understand it’s custom for you Cassilines to keep Elua’s Vigil?”
“You are--that’s--brilliant. Yes.”
-- And Sherlock uses his signale, but it
Without even removing his daggers, John slid forward, body moving like water as he swung one arm out to catch Ringleader’s inner wrist, knocked the switchblade free. It clattered on the ground beside them. Ringleader let out a grunt of surprise as he scrabbled for his knife--
Bronze drums thundered, and when he blinked his eyes open, his vision swam red. Elua was ready to embrace him in love, but he knew the weight on his soul was best taken to Kushiel.
Sherlock was now completely taken aback. Not even the Kusheline priestess had been sure, before she’d pricked his finger. This complete stranger had gotten it in one go.
Then to John’s horror, Moriarty stepped forward, crowded Sherlock. John fought the urge to pry him free, but Moriarty wrenched Sherlock down and kissed him hard, a reward given as a punishment. Sherlock collapsed against the doorframe, clinging to Moriarty for support.
Once he’d settled in she set about making the coffee, her pleasant chatter filling up the kitchen. When she set the mug in front of him, however, her expression turned concerned.
Sherlock could hardly make his voice work. When he spoke it came out as a hoarse whisper. “No, Daddy. I’m not.”
Beside him, Sally laughs. “This is the most ridiculous--”
Since Sherlock has gone off-script, so can John.
Footsteps echoed on the hardwood floor in the hallway, stopped at his door. A sharp rap against his door sounded seconds later.
Sherlock said nothing, only trembled beneath so much scrutiny.
Had Sherlock failed? One small mistake and all bets were off?
This time there was a pause, papers shuffling. “She’s at the Berkeley. You’re sure?”
He thought of his hand on Sherlock’s arm at the police station, and understood something that had always been beyond his grasp: restraint was a form of protection that had nothing to do with his blades or his anger.
The splashing receded as they scrambled onto land, and they hastily snagged their belongings from the banked fire, Mr. Pritchard yelling still in the distance.
Then Sherlock understood their costumes: there was an old,
He watched as she weaved through the heaped and cluttered maze, moving forward as best he could. At about 20 feet in, she had to duck beneath the legs of a desk turned on its side and a stack of old reference books; it was the only opening in the path she’d taken toward the back.
He never bought it, though. His attentions became soured, his words bitter. She and a few other servants had to lodge formal complaints in order to bar him from Camellia House, after a fashion.
# # # # #
She grabbed the top of his corset, yanking him down to her level. “You’re lucky you’ve got Naamah’s blessing for this. If I caught you on a street corner, I’d have to take you in. Can you imagine what would happen?”
But he is not; he is a veteran and a widower twice, if Mrs. Hudson is to be believed. He is a man who has drank deep from the well of grief, and lived to hate its bitter aftertaste.
Sherlock struggled to keep his eyes open, so strong was his fatigue, until a gush of warm water sluiced over his skin, washing away the blood until it spiraled in dilute whorls and disappeared down the drain.
“I’ll never give you my
That was Sherlock’s signal.
A few minutes later, Sherlock stood abruptly. John slid out of his booth to join him, but Sherlock shook his head. “Just a moment. I’m going to plug my phone into the car and use the toilet. Not quite ready to leave yet.”
# # # # #
Sherlock’s stomach knotted. John had hated him from the outset; did his Cassiline have some sort of sixth sense for this sort of thing, or had it been a coincidence?
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’d call all the officers in. They know what you are, yeah? They know how much of a fucking masochist you are. First we’d cuff you.” She wrenched his arms behind his back, snatched a set of handcuffs from an accent table. Freezing metal clamped tight around his wrists, ratcheted into place. “I’d hold you still while they all took their turns frisking you.”
Apollinare leaned forward with interest lighting his features. “What would you do then, if you were spying on us?”
Even still, the lapping water of the Thames against distant docks, against the gravelly shore beneath their feet, took on a hollow ring like a drumbeat against his ears. Sebastian Wilke’s body flashed red in his vision, and he knew he was on the right path.
Drums. Deep drums, the sound of an ancient heartbeat, Kushiel’s terrible mercy, the wail of the klaxon and the roar of a long-forgotten goddess screaming her sorrows. Sherlock was these, he was nothing, he was pure kinetic energy. He dove forward, equilibrium thankfully pulling him to one side as he swiveled his head away from the line of fire, pivoted and drove his shoulder into Luca’s stomach.
After a little struggling, John worked himself free. He hugged the arm of his bad shoulder to his side, willing the pain to abate. When he finished he found Sherlock regarding him, the gears turning.
John nodded slowly. “Yes, okay, but that doesn’t explain the acorn.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. He wouldn’t be fooled this easily. Of course John would do something as stupid as this, if it meant trying to win the bet. Sherlock sighed and touched John’s shoulder, the one that carried his scar and still clicked loudly in the cold weather. Then he pointed at the blanket on the floor and frowned. Then he gestured between John and the couch, and made sure his face read,
John’s blood beat in his ears, the eerie calm of Cassiel’s mantle settling over him, determination in the wake of tumult. The ring of steel whispered in the back of his mind, and he could have trembled with that blessing, or at least its memory, if he didn’t have something to give himself wholly to. He had allowed himself a prayer on Sherlock’s behalf, and had to trust implicitly it would be heard.
After a minute of expectant silence, Molly rises from the bed. She retreats from the room with little more than, “You should come back downstairs. It won’t be the same without you.”
John’s eyes widened then, realising his mistake in some part. “I--”
“One more week. You’ll make such a
The way Jim strolled in--! Fresh suit, relaxed smile, as if they were meeting for a coffee rather than as prisoner and warden. His hair oil and that spicy cologne he favoured mingled with the decay of the asylum, and even if Jim hadn’t the ability to draw all the air out, all on his own, Sherlock still wouldn’t have been able to breathe for the smell.
If he performed well for both Amelia and Jim,  surely Jim would take him in a private assignation. Elua, he could only hope.
It’s a photo John hasn’t seen in years, one he didn’t even realise Sherlock still had, really. When the sting of tears nearly blinds him, he blinks quickly and prays Sherlock is too busy navigating to notice.
Sally clears her throat. “Is
“It’s nothing,” he said again. He willed John to believe it.
“Our sources believe he may be funding a group of D’Angeline extremists who would see the nation insulated from the rest of the world to preserve its purity--we need you to uncover any ties he might have with the Lies-Beyond organization.”
It was a true credit to the measure of his pain that Sherlock only frowned at him, watched him rise and move toward the cockpit. John returned a moment later, having retrieved a few bundles.
“If you like,” Jim answered. “Sherlock, heel.”
John paused, still holding the corner of the blanket. He dropped it and drew closer, and all the eloquent things Sherlock had planned to say fell right out of his head. Instead he withdrew the box from his pocket and thrust it at John. John accepted it and frowned, and Sherlock could very easily guess why: it was a plain little ring box.
Sherlock couldn’t help but think of Lestrade, then. He’d been rough, sure, but not cruel. And afterward, he’d recognized that Sherlock was more use to him as a brain rather than a fuck.
“It seems your wishful thinking has paid off,” Irene commented when Sherlock and John arrived back to
“I did. Thank you.”
That gave John a proper jolt of surprise. Even Sherlock looked dumbstruck. “You mean, it was a patron?”
John should’ve known something was up when he came home one evening to Sherlock pacing before the windows only to pivot on one heel and pin him with a stare.
The taped edges of the plain brown wrapping paper parted easily with the slide of Sherlock’s fingers to reveal an overstuffed white shirt box, like one might find at Christmas. Sherlock’s breath quivered in his chest. A large box from a mysterious sender--nothing about this felt right.
Sherlock lifted his palm up to face John, and John mirrored the gesture. Sherlock let out a wavering breath. He let his fingertips trace along John’s, a barely-there suggestion of pressure, warm skin leaving a tingling chill in their wake. It coursed electric along each nerve.
Helen glanced to each side, halfway across the room along an outer wall, hugging her arms against the biting damp cold of the cellar, when she stopped before an old armoire. John froze again, intent. She opened the full-length doors, which creaked in echo around the storage space, and stepped inside.
Once he was dressed and settled at a nearby table to eat, a discreet knock at the door heralded Sister Roberts’ entry.
Beside him, Sherlock stiffened. Across from him, the private broke his wall-bound gaze long enough to give him a searching, almost frightened look.
“Unbutton. Unzip. Slowly.”
?” She scoffed. “Do you think any of us are stupid to fall for that? We
“I told you he came highly recommended,” Dianne purred to her twin. Her lips pressed plush and tender against Sherlock’s neck, jaw, shoulder, in numerous wordless thanks.
Sherlock straightened and turned toward Mr. Ames’s
Sherlock cut him off. “You were upset earlier. What happened?”
before thrusting the butt of the remaining dagger into his temple.
Sherlock’s expression softened, and he gave a long blink, forgiveness in the flutter of his eyelids. His grip relaxed on John’s shoulders and he gave another nod, his gloved hands skimming down the layered bulk of John’s upper arms, obscured as they were by his heavy coat. The
poppy. She’s saying this because of the mote in his eye.
Minutes stretch as the afterglow fades, and Sherlock is glad for John’s weight grounding him to the mattress, distracting him from the soreness he’ll inevitably feel when all the endorphins recede from his system. He lets loose a pleased noise, half growl, half purr.
, pet. Just tell me you're mine. Stay with me, and it'll all be fine. You'll be my prince.”
Face burning, praying anew to Anael and Cassiel alike that he hadn’t been overheard, John answered the door. Sherlock, still suited and now wearing an inscrutable expression, stood on the other side.
Cassilines honoured no other holiday; Elua’s vigil was paramount. John had come along tonight on the impetus that there would be no chance to hold the vigil.
Maybe it was the coffee, or the sleep deprivation, or the diner-air rotting his brain, but he let loose a hearty giggle that Sherlock joined in. “Uni was... it was boring. Unbearably boring. I didn’t really come out of my shell until my army days, if you’d believe. I dated around a bit, had one serious relationship, and spent my time studying my arse off.”
But, Elua above, Sherlock loved it.
John turned to direct the impact away from the back of his skull, but caught cheek and ear. The side of his orbital bone and pain exploded in a way he’d not experienced in a long time.
And still, Helen drew him back from the edge of that precipice until he felt grounded, body and brain in synch once more. Helen finished her ministrations and brushed a sweat-damp curl from Sherlock’s forehead.
John turned to watch Sherlock cross the room in a few long-legged strides, wondering what he could possibly need from his suit jacket, which he retrieved from the floor. He pulled out his phone, and a few taps later, a low beat issued forth from the stereo system tucked away on a bookshelf.
Frédérique nodded, his eyes darting to Cecily. It was apparent from the way they leaned away from one another that they weren’t much acquainted, despite their long captivity.
And still, he finds that it’s perfectly fine.
Elua, he was a threat even like this. Sherlock was so distracted by his guard he nearly forgot his train of thought.
The bitter cold cut through that reverie. Sherlock, weak from the night’s demands, trembled violently.
With fumbling fingers, John worked Sherlock’s shirt open, each button a valiant opponent in the battle for Sherlock’s nudity. Impatient, Sherlock stepped back and finished the job himself, a smirk on his face as he tossed it over his shoulder with a flourish before divesting John in a similar fashion. With John newly bared, Sherlock shifted behind him and wrapped one arm across John’s chest, the other across his waist. He plied kisses along the planes of his strong, compact shoulders, along the side of his neck until he found the sweet spot that made John’s knees weak. Good Lord, ever since the day Sherlock had accidentally huffed a breath of laughter against that spot while stooping over John’s shoulder to mock the blog, John had wanted his mouth there.
The earth turned beneath him, and beyond the temple life continued in the city of London. Each and every person chose a hundred times a day, and all Elua asked was that each choice was made with love.
loomed ahead of him, grand and white. Neatly trimmed shrubbery rose high around its facade, decorated the walled perimeter of her compact estate in the posh little district.
Already John could feel the familiar burn blossoming in his cheeks. The tone in Sherlock’s voice, the depth of that dark-as-sin sound emanating from the receiver was unlike anything John had ever heard from his flatmate. And if there was one thing he knew was obvious, it was how much he
“I wonder if sweetness can be just as painful,” John mused.
Something like shame, and something more delightful, churned low in Sherlock’s stomach--
The guards. Luca was telling them to come to the chapel.
When he didn’t answer, she added, “It’s up to you to see this as a blessing or a curse. No one else can decide that for you. I can say this: may you find comfort in his mercy, and don’t ever mistake your ability to yield as a weakness. I have no idea why Kushiel has chosen you, but he has.”
John closed his eyes, willing his turmoil to abate--it was a futile thing, but he tried all the same. Bronze thundered and steel rang with the rush of blood in his ears, honey and apple on his tongue. It was all overwhelming, and at its still centre, John understood the feeling. His love, even Dianne’s, different though it may be. The love of Elua and every last of his Companions.
Sherlock spun on his heel, marching for the hotel’s doors. Such a flair for the dramatic, that one.
Where skin touched soil, a tingling began at the base of his spine, spread outward like ink in water. John wished: that the earth might swallow him whole, that he could bury himself until he became the fertile minerals and decay, that his fingers were roots and his peace blossomed like wildflowers, a riot in the sun.
Blood sang in his ears and his head throbbed with it. Surely the stitches were pulled taut, ready to rip free from his scalp, but none of that mattered, not now. The floor dipped and swayed, and Sherlock fought to keep himself steady as he ran, nearly colliding with the walls as he thundered down the hallway.
She plucked at his garter belt until the clasp hook slid free, and she dragged his panties down just enough to let her shaft slide along the cleft of his arse. Her hold on the handcuffs served as her leverage. Sherlock could just imagine the way it must’ve looked: the length of her darker-toned strap-on nestled between his plump, pale arsecheeks. It felt like a tease, just a warm-up designed to make him needy. With her free hand she drizzled some of the lube where skin met silicone until she could glide through the slick mess, picking up a rhythm.
John looked up to see that the one with tattoos had Sherlock pinned against the alley wall, and before he could accurately assess his hands went for his daggers--
Lestrade hissed, drawing back as his hands tightened reflexively in Sherlock’s hair, yanking the younger man’s head back. He slid from Sherlock’s mouth with a wet pop.
Irene chuckled, shaking her head. “Look at you. Just the thought of it has you trembling.” She cupped Sherlock’s jaw, gave him a soft smile. “No. I’m worried he’ll seduce you so well you’ll not want to come home.”
John’s hands went to the hilts of his daggers, heard them sing as they slid free.
We’ll burn that bridge when we get to it, John thought. Aloud, all he said was, “C’mon.”
“What?” Sherlock asked, and dabbed at his mouth, where he’d just been stuffing the pentultimate bite of his syrup-soaked waffle.
At this Sherlock nearly got a raspberry lodged in his throat, but he managed. “I had heard.”
Sherlock lapped at his cock, only taking the glans into his mouth while looking up through his lashes to catch Victor’s eyes. Victor gave a frustrated grunt, tangling his hands in Sherlock’s hair. “Open that pretty little mouth, whore.”
Sherlock scowled and focused on his own reflection until taking the piss lost its appeal.
“It’s not--what dead mice?” She sighed, shaking her head. “No. It’s about your eye.”
Silence cascaded to settle between them, uncertainty shifting in the fog. John lifted his Scotch, inspected it. The amber liquor sloshed, but wasn’t distracting enough to break the awkwardness. John
“You’re not wrong there,” John conceded. He began pushing himself in.
, counted through the periodic table backward. He sang through entire operas, if only in his mind.
John sighed, squaring his jaw. His lack of argument meant as much in the way of acquiescence as having actually said yes.
“Speak up, love.” Lestrade’s voice rumbled in his ear and
He stared down into his thick white Waffle House mug, shrugged, and let himself smile before he tossed back another gulp.
“What for? We’ve got our man--we’re working on a confession now. As soon as he admits to getting those adepts kill to their targets, we’re ready to lock his arse away.”
“But they have other methods,” Sister Roberts persisted, “ones that don’t have anything to do with ‘belaboring’ the experiences. And maybe you are lucky, maybe you have been blessed enough by Elua and all his Companions, to never need set foot in a professional therapist’s office. Maybe this was it for you. But I need you to know it’s available. I’m saying this as someone who practiced for the better part of a decade before joining the Kusheline priesthood.”
, John thinks.
John swallowed against the lump that formed in his throat, the taste of green and sunlight strange on his tongue. He recalled his dream--the cupped hands of The Good Steward, his own divine ancestor, supporting soil and the fragility of new life.
Cassiline! I wasn’t aware we were hosting your
From Sherlock’s position two steps up, he could see the flex of John’s jaw, the protest a-brew.
Even still, he found he had nothing else he could say. He knew Brother Vincent was awaiting whatever forgiveness or censure John wished to dole out. John was just empty.
"All finished here. Dinner?"
He smiled, just a twitch at the corner of his mouth, but she nodded.
As Lestrade found his rhythm, hitting home again and again against Sherlock’s prostate, Sherlock remembered his promise:
“If she did, why would you be stupid enough to take her bait?” Sherlock snapped.
Sherlock swallowed against the frisson fear that had begun to constrict his throat, ignoring the way it buzzed in his head, at once paralyzing and thrilling. He couldn’t begin to guess where his fear came from, only that the closer they got to Sister Roberts, Kushiel’s head priestess in London, the sharper and sweeter that fear became.
He had no idea what to do with that.
“Yes, it is and you need it too,” Sherlock retorted.
, he thought darkly.
Sherlock’s smile deepened and he lifted the wrist of his free hand for John to catch.
She raked her nails up one thigh. The burn had him pressing his groin against the edge of the bed.
Sherlock couldn’t help how hard he was now--and surprisingly, the plug did nothing to hinder his erection. There it was, just the familiar thrum of arousal wrapped tightly around this little steel rod, only three inches long.
to cool the fire in John’s veins.
“The Terminus,” John murmured.
, he begged to anyone who might be listening.
Luca picked up on that, too, and instead gave him an appraisal of the current situation.
Extraction came in the form of a police boat, sirens wailing. Sherlock, John, and Felippa all surrendered when a stern-faced brunette in plainclothes thundered toward them.
Her smile was sweet, timid, and her stern green eyes softened. Her words dripped like honey.
John refused to meet Sherlock’s eye, steadfastly holding Moriarty’s gaze. He hadn’t behaved this way since the first or second of Sherlock’s assignations. Why the sudden change?
“Now, pet. I’ll stop your waiting. You’ve been mostly behaved, though I’ve had some issue with your little… adventures.”
D’Angeline story, of a dark figure who mastered the birds, who kept a tame osprey. Sherlock’s reflection in the mirror showed his eyes flashing wild and shining behind his mask; he could see why Jim viewed him as a rare creature to hold captive.
He’s pointing at Lestrade.
Was he implying Mary would become violent, if John were to leave?

“I understand, if only in a small portion, what you’re going through. You’ve heard of survivor’s guilt?”
When John draws close to the dock, Sherlock’s curls are plastered to his forehead, longer now than they were back then. Though the years have left their mark on his face, too, John finds him just as stunning as he had at seventeen.
Sherlock did, ignoring the bite of a diamond, pressing sharp and merciless against his kneecap. Just before Jim lifted Sherlock’s arms, Sherlock recalled the room’s layout. Dangling from the centre of the ceiling, a large hook hung on a thick chain, which rattled as Jim tugged it toward Sherlock’s makeshift manacles.
“Proper and complete training in Naamah’s arts in a purely textbook fashion.” Sherlock ground out. He had no idea why she found any of this so funny. “I have no desire to call into question your professionality or the quality of my tutelage, Ms. Adler. I fully intend on making my
“Show me this pond,” Sherlock demanded, eager to put as much distance between himself and the doorway into the kitchen, that proof of a much more innocent version of his murdered friend, for just a little while. “Wait just a moment, though. I need to get something.”
2.) Victor and Sherlock *do* sign a legally binding contractual agreement to the terms and boundaries of this assignation, including a safeword (aka "
John’s soul was--
“So--so long,” Sherlock stammered as Jim pushed him further into the room, spacious and sparse--it was an inner sanctum, indeed.
Sherlock shifted uneasily from foot to foot, all too aware of his muddled judgement, of the way John’s glare bored into the back of his head.
Sherlock frowned at that, but for once in his life, he didn’t have the energy to pursue it.
Sherlock stretched out on the sofa, relaxed and near-dozing as he contemplated a strategy with which he might win the game. It had circled fruitlessly, and he’d abandoned it in favour of trying to suss out a suitable boon he could demand when he won.
Another man spoke, his voice older, a barely-noticeable D’Angeline lilt to his accent.
The hum of tattoo guns in other rooms almost lulled Sherlock to sleep until the door to his room opened with a soft click. Mr. Ames cleared his throat.
As he spoke, Wilkerson grasped the safety ring and slid the plug out and back in, the barest fraction of movement. It felt like leagues and miles to Sherlock, still surrounded by blind-folded darkness and the images his overactive brain couldn’t help but produce. He could almost see in mind's eye the sight of his own cock spread open like an alien eye, speared by this steel bar; he could imagine the gaping pucker of his flesh whenever it slid free, the way precome would dribble freely from the stretched slit. The sensation his brain had originally interpreted as burning exploded in a symphony of bizarre, sweet pleasure that left him crying out around the gag, each noise a plea for more.
“Is this alright?”
But that was silly, of course. He was likely no more able to see John’s secrets than Sherlock or Irene, whom John knew could observe, could infer, but nothing more.
A cut saddle-strap. The rest was out of Frédérique’s hands.
The incongruity of Sherlock’s warm affection and John’s cock at attention right beside his cheekbone made John giggle. “Sherlock Holmes, telling me I’m thinking too much?”
John swallowed the small knot of dread that formed instantly in the back of his throat. J
Indeed, Cecily and Frédérique had already succumbed, slumped together in their seats. Sherlock studied them a second; their own roads home would be painful, difficult, but they would survive.
Helen leaned back to undo her shirt, each button revealing the modest cleft between her breasts, a pale stretch of stomach firm and flat from years of horseback riding. Once free from her button-down, a lacy, nude-coloured bra was all that remained. Then she tilted her head, clasping her braid and working quickly to undo it. Her hair fell in thick waves around her face, curtaining across her shoulders and back.
He focused on Sherlock’s hands, which fidgeted with the cuff of his pyjamas. Sherlock sat in the centre of the overlarge bed, cross-legged and anxious. It made him seem so much younger. This was the Sherlock that John wanted to protect the most.
The blossom traced right along the curving crease between arse and thigh, stilled just against the barest bit of exposed bollocks. Sherlock whined.
At that he could only nod.
“What are you on about?” Sherlock asked, and in his focus he hadn’t bothered with making his tone softer, but Mrs. Hudson only snorted at the sharpness of his words.
Sherlock nodded.
But muscle-memory was a curious thing, and his body remembered what he'd tried so hard to forget: how to grip just so, when to twist his wrist or thrust upward against the tight ring of his fingers, the slick heat as precome leaked and smeared across the head of his cock. Tears stung at his eyes, the pyre of his dignity incinerating under the weight of his dream-memory: Sherlock's skin against his palms, the soft shudder and sigh he offered as John caved to his own weakness.
But Sherlock turns, looks at him, squeezing his hand slightly--as if he is all too aware how fragile this exact moment is. “Hear me out--that would be enough.”
Sherlock had nothing left, either.
Sherlock wanted to kick himself--of course their driver was gone for the night. He wasn’t due to be picked up until the following morning.
Frédérique prayed to Naamah, Elua, and every last of the Companions that Jean-Julien would choose him. His prayers were answered.
“That was when we got Red Beard--my father had a way of offering his affection in the form of service or else gifts.”
