He’s not sure how much time has passed when Sherlock suddenly turns to loom over him, instead of the teacup, causing John to startle and narrowly avoid spilling hot tea on his fingers.
“Tedious,” Sherlock mutters, pushing past John roughly to pace the living room, heedless of his freshly bandaged foot. He kicks the coffee table even further askew on his way past.
Sherlock hangs his head, hair obscuring his face, digging his fingers into his thighs. John runs his fingers over slick hair and muscle, trying to soothe the tenseness that has returned to Sherlock’s body.
John floats for a bit, let’s himself sink into the bliss of it. He drifts, daydreaming of the taste of Sherlock in his mouth, the flashbang sensation each time Sherlock’s sinks down around him, the breathless punched out sounds they are both making.
He peeks around the kitchen door and, sure enough, Sherlock is sprawled across the couch. His face is turned into the cushions, wrapped in nothing but a bed sheet that is also pulled up over his face, his long, bare legs poking out one end and his hair poking out the other.
Sherlock closes his eyes tightly, looking utterly inconvenienced. “It would...seem so.”
John looks away, returning to sweep up shards of glass. Sherlock scoffs meanly.
“Need some help over there?” John asks, leaning against the counter with his teacup.
“Mary loved you Sherlock. I-I love you. I can’t blame her for her choice to keep you safe, I would have done the same. Please stop blaming yourself.”
The next words tumble from John’s lips before he can truly think them through.
Sherlock shifts in the bath, the soft slap of water against the sides bringing John back to the moment. He returns to his seat at the side of the tub and sets about working almost too much conditioner into Sherlock’s hair, slicking it back to his skull. He feels out each knot with his fingers, pulling and pressing carefully to loosen the knot before he sets the comb to it, working in short pieces from the bottom up and holding in a way that doesn’t tug at Sherlock’s scalp.
John doesn't try to muffle his moans in reply that creep up his throat as he sets about cleaning Sherlock’s skin with his mouth.
Sherlock looks over his shoulder at the shattered remains for a moment and then shakes his head, “no, the biggest danger is the glass.”
“Sherlock?” John asks quietly.
comfortable under his hands.
Mrs. Hudson turns and catches John by the face, turning his head this way and that in the light.
When John turns around from bolting the front door behind him, almost an obsession now since Mrs. Hudson was attacked, it’s to find said landlady hovering by the banister looking immensely disapproving.
Sherlock continues to brood over the empty cup, his face unreadable.
“We’re adults,” John says, taking a step back and pulling in several deep breaths. “Either we can talk about this like adults, or we pretend it never happened.”
“Oh, yeah, yeah.”
A breath he coughs out, stuttered and inelegant, when John darts in and licks a long path through his own cum up the long column of Sherlock’s throat.
”We’re all addicts, in our own way.” She finally replies, but she sounds sad. “Feeding his addiction for a little bit of quiet won’t harm him. At least, not irreparably.”
Sherlock’s face twists cruelly, “oh, trying your hand at being a dom now, John?”
Her face was utteraly unreadable and he exchanges a brief glance with Sherlock who is looking both murderous and unsure, a bad combo for John’s desire to simply go to bed.
Sherlock almost seems to start, but composes himself quickly. “Of course. Husband is lying, her bruising is consistent with struggle. No dom worth their salt would let her leave in that state. BDSM play that involves striking should leave bruises that follow the lines of the body, a natural progression.” He points to the purpling on his face that does indeed follow the line of his cheekbone cleanly, almost a blush.
Sherlock lifts his head from the floor, his face full of utter derision.
“Move, it’s my turn.” Sherlock says, shoving at John’s hip.
The next moments are a blur of pulling and pushing. Sherlock gets his bedroom door open but John pushes it closed; toeing his shoes off and stalking Sherlock against the bed until his knees bend and he’s suddenly looking up at John. The room is dim, lit only by the remnants of afternoon sunlight dispersed through the oncoming stormclouds, making the rumpled grey linens of the bed shimmer, casting Sherlock in a halo.
John turns to look over his shoulder and Sherlock is just staring at an empty mug like tea will appear. He notices John watching him and points to the mug.
John pulls himself up so he’s laying on the pillow next to Sherlock, sneaking a hand up over his waist and pulling him in closer.
“Good catch,” Sherlock says between then, with just the same tone as that first night in the parking lot, pride and a hint of something else.
He captures one of Sherlock’s hands in his own and brings it to his mouth, pressing a kiss to the delicate arch at the base of Sherlock’s pointer finger and then down and over, stopping to bite at Sherlock’s pulse, making Sherlock jump in his grip.
Eventually, Sherlock breaks, sighing loudly.
Turns out Sherlock carries only a fractionally deeper understanding of long-term climate change than he does heliocentrism, daily weather being more useful for deductions. Not enough people murdering each other in London over global warming, John supposes; but if the heat hangs on much longer, the first victim might be Sherlock himself.
“W-what?” he manages to get out between breaths.
“Sherlock, get in the bath or I’ll hold you down in it.”
tell him is fucking adorable.
He tries for innocence but somehow the comment veers into wickedness and even Sherlock is looking at him out of the corner of his eye with a shadow of surprise.
“43 seconds, John. Then I’m dropping this sheet and I’ll go ask to borrow sugar from the neighbor.” Sherlock gestures wildly, sheet swirling around his legs.
“-But you’ve never? With someone you fancy?”
“10 seconds, John.”
John kisses him soundly, a wet, sloppy, joyful thing, and pats his hip.
“Then play the violin. Go have tea with Mrs. Hudson. Anything but leaving the building or anything involving fire, please.”
John deliberately and pointedly pins Sherlock to the bed by one broad hand, pressed into the tender skin just under his ribcage, at the top of his stomach. Sherlock sucks a breath in sharply in reply.
John is brushing his teeth in the bathroom and debating the merits of sticking his head under the tap when he hears Sherlock stumbling from his room and down the hall, clipping every available surface on the way by the sound of it. John peeks out just as Sherlock turns the corner into the sitting room, catching a flash of cream which nearly makes him drop his toothbrush.
“I wear it because it’s what
Even shuffling along, Sherlock’s pace outstrips John’s easily. He’s halfway up the stairs to 221B as John bolts the front door behind them against the rain roaring outside, his feet dragging and thumping on every step. A shushing sound fills the hall from where Sherlock leans heavily on the wall in his windbreaker, sliding against the old wallpaper.
Sherlock shrugs dramatically, “I like pear drops too.”
“I’ve decided,” John suddenly says, almost too loud for the quiet of the room and Sherlock’s skin twitches under his touch.
John watches Sherlock stumble and fall his way into the tub, heedless of his nudity and nearly braining himself on the porcelain, sending a wall of water onto the floor. He hisses angrily, pulling his cut foot back out of the bath as soon as he’s seated and dangling it over the edge of the tub, blood and water quietly dripping to the soaked floor.
“Fan,” he snaps from his cocoon and John jumps.
” John asks, in the same tone she uses when she says it.
“That’s never going to happen.”
No matter what darkness may forge on in the world, no matter what mysteries the wealthy or powerful may bring him, no matter what Moriarty may be up to in the shadows -- Sherlock Holmes is a constant the universe can’t touch.
“How’s your face?” John asks quietly.
Sherlock watches him without answer, his mind processing whatever details it picks up, and then he shrugs, sinking back into the pillows with a wiggle and stretch John will never
“Astonishingly,” Sherlock adds, sounding completely normal, as if he can slide from regular thoughts to sweaty and cum-covered in John’s arms and back without a thought, “I find myself enjoying this without the need for further deductions or information. Other than my running list of your surprisingly extensive kinks. Both as much a novelty to me as they are to you, I assure you.”
“Me, an addict with a death wish. You, drowning in a bottle, probably also a death wish. Arguably high on the list of least fit guardians for a child in all of London. Beaten by a morgue registrar.”
Sarah has commented,
John has to fight down a laugh. “You just stepped on a piece of glass, didn’t you?”
John sees them in the morning. Sherlock in a dressing gown falling off his shoulder, John with the newspaper, both with fresh tea. Only this time, John gets to lean over and kiss Sherlock in his chair when he hands over a mug and Sherlock gets to mumble about sentiment, unable to hide a smile anyway. The morning light will filter in the windows and John will drag his chair a little closer to Sherlock’s and Sherlock will stick his cold toes under John’s thigh and pluck at his violin thoughtfully until Mrs. Hudson or a client, or the real world in general butts in as it always does.
John digs his thumbs in and runs them along the top edge of Sherlock’s hip bones, swallowing the taller man’s answering gasp. Kissing has degraded to panting into each other’s mouths, John’s brain trying to decide how to move next and overwhelmed by all the options.
John pushes closer, sliding his fingers higher to frame where their hard lengths are pressed side by side through so little fabric, their sharp inhale almost simultaneous. Glass tinkles under his slippered feet but the view of the floor is interrupted by the sight of Sherlock’s cock, indecently outlined through that thin bedsheet, a sheer patch of pre-cum already spreading from the head. The denim length of John is pressed in tight next to him, a little shorter but leaning toward girth, testing the sharp edges of his zipper.
John can’t help the stupid, goofy grin creeping back into his face so he ducks his head to presses kisses up the inside of Sherlock’s thigh, licking at the bruise he left as he passes, and rests his face on Sherlock’s stomach, sighing contentedly. He almost jumps when Sherlock starts gently petting his hair but quickly loses himself to the sensation, fingers idly tracing a pattern of moles on Sherlock’s hip.
He makes quick work of pulling the small piece of glass there and cleaning the cut. It’s in the soft arch of Sherlock’s foot and is sure to be a bitch to heal, but thankfully not too deep. John is hyper aware of the flex of Sherlock’s foot in his hands, pale and surprisingly soft, the bones and veins of him all shifting under the surface of thin skin and so alive under John’s hands. He pointedly does not look up at Sherlock’s face.
“Well,” Irene shrugs, parroting him mockingly. She tilts her head, assessing, and takes another photo from a new angle. “I told you, you might not want to come in. I’d offer to let you join us, but somehow I don’t think you’d appreciate it the same way.”
This time, it’s John’s turn to step forward. To crowd Sherlock back against the counter and watch the emotions chase themselves across his face, emotions Sherlock claims not to feel but John knows better. Confusion, curiosity, something that flickers like want.
“Sherlock-” John starts, but as if the sound of his name is a red flag, Sherlock surges upward once more. To his surprise, Sherlock goes for the remains of the mirror instead of him, trying to elbow John aside, and John barely has the strength to hold him back.
John tightens his fingers just slightly against the sharp edge of Sherlock’s jaw and swallows the sound Sherlock makes.
Sherlock’s hands dance over John’s kneecaps, slightly ticklish, and then up and up and up. Without warning, Sherlock digs his fingers into John’s thighs viciously and swallows John down all in one move. John would be bucking up off the bed if Sherlock weren’t holding him down in a crushing grip and as it is he jerks sharply anyway, curling over Sherlock’s bobbing head.
Sherlock looks deeply,
Sure enough, there are muttered voices. Two, unless his ears are failing him, but they are too quiet to make out the words. There is a sharp
Sherlock regains composure first, suddenly straightening, a cool look on his face like he’s daring John to mention anything is out of the ordinary.
“Bed,” he says, voice rough.
The third time it happens, there is no excusing, no reasoning it away. Sherlock is sober and John is sober and no one is sick and Sherlock didn’t have to fumigate his room and the flat isn’t on fire and no hazardous chemicals have been spilled.
“And, you didn’t expect you’d like it so much?” And, maybe you overestimated your ability to suppress emotions? An ability, by the way, I still have no idea why you are so bloody proud of.”
Sherlock buries his nose in the thatch of brown curls at the base of John’s cock, breathing deeply. His hands are questing up the back of John’s thighs, pressing and scratching lightly in turns across every secret, soft place on John’s body.
“Of what, John?” Sherlock mocks in a sarcastic voice which somehow makes John grin even harder.
Sherlock mumbles something between their mouths and John says, “shut up, shut up,” and presses in harder. There will be questions later, awkwardness, perhaps even regret, but right now the whole world is reduced to the cool bite of Sherlock’s mouth, followed by a touch of sweetness. Sherlock’s been at the sugar cubes again, he likes the texture, eats them from the bowl when Mrs. Hudson isn’t looking and crunches annoyingly.
Sherlock looks John dubiously up and down, “I’m significantly taller than you.”
Sherlock slides his mouth along John’s temple, pressing himself into John at every point he can. John turns his mouth to the curve of Sherlock’s ear, sliding his hands around to pull him closer.
Before John has consciously made a decision, he’s already turned and headed back, figuring he can get his phone and Sherlock’s breakfast order all in one go and feel marginally less like he wasted a trip. He’s so lost in the daydream of his sandwich and piecing together the rush of the last 3 days that his feet carry him halfway into the flat before he even realizes he’s back.
He’d know that voice anywhere. Alluring, pulling you in with eyes and lips and teeth, a little curved and sharp and wicked at the end like a fishhook.
John steps to Sherlock’s side and Sherlock doesn’t move, only his eyes darting up and away.
“It’s not, Sherlock. I’ve been drinking, you’re still high. We’re going to bed.”
“No really,” John continues when he has his breath back, because this is important damn it! “Thank you. Thank you for being honest, the least I can do is be the same.”
“What?”
“Don’t be rude Sherlock, Molly cares for you even when you treat her like dirt. She deserves better and she happens to be taking care of Rosie who I wouldn’t let within 100 yards of you at the moment.”
She huffs a laugh, drowned out by Sherlock roaring John’s name again and a sound that is definitely Sherlock hurling himself at the door and sliding down to the floor.
John presses a thumb sharply to the bruise on his face and Sherlock sucks in a breath.
“Oh you boys~”
“And apparently it is like that with me? So, why did you ask her then?”
Sherlock tilts his head coyly, smiling up at John from under his lashes, looking damp and mischievous. John can’t help the smile that jumps to his face in reply.
She doesn’t wait for a reply and indeed, John doesn’t have one. She pulls Sherlock’s coat tight around her once more, pocketing the riding crop. “I’ll just see myself out then, shall I?”
“H-how long have you been there?” John asks.
“You’re awake then?” John asks quietly.
John flexes and lifts him easily, reveling in Sherlock safe and whole and trusting in his arms. Sherlock entertains himself by licking at the delicate curves of John’s ear and John has to focus extra hard on avoiding the worst of the glass and not dropping Sherlock.
Sherlock’s head thumps back into the wall, his hands sliding up John’s neck and into his hair, fingers tight and questing.
Sherlock is...peculiar, about him having his phone on him. John might call it worry in anyone else, but with Sherlock it usually bubbles quickly  over into frustrated and exasperated, the wires of his emotions all crossed and tangled like earbuds in a pocket.
It’s Irene Adler.
“And yes, I’m clean in all senses of the word, bar whatever it is Adler so loves stabbing people with, harmless anyway. In case my being a filthy addict is worrying you.” Sherlock snaps at the exact same time John says--
John stands with a sigh and sets about making tea. He fills the kettle and flicks the switch on, reaches past Sherlock to add a second empty mug to the counter and teabags in both cups, slams the silverware drawer into Sherlock’s thigh, and all the while Sherlock doesn’t budge an inch.
John doesn’t realize how long he’s been staring into the space just over the top edge of his newspaper until Sherlock trips over a stack of books trying to get to the bathroom, sprawling roughly out on the living room floor next to John’s chair.
“Do we really?” he says, but without any of his usual snark. A bit tired, a bit recovering from illness, a bit of something delightful dancing across his face. His eyes are glassy but crinkled at the corners, giving him away.
But John is only half listening, focused on licking the taste of himself from Sherlock’s mouth, tongue and lips rasping over Sherlock’s barely-there stubble to chase anything he’s missed. Sherlock is boneless, his head lolling and a wicked, pleased smile pulling at the corner of his mouth as he stretches in John’s arms.
Sherlock, honest to god, sticks his tongue out. The scrunched, petulant face and damp curls in his eyes make him look like an overgrown toddler.
“JOHN!” Sherlock roars, sitting up and briefly losing his grip on his sheet again, flushed all down his bare neck and chest.
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth quirks up despite himself, and John can see him wrestling the smile back down.
“Uh…” is all John can seem to manage.
“Of interested? I don’t know. Donovan thinks you are a necrophiliac by the way, you should probably nip that rumor in the bud.”
She closes her mouth, but her eyes glitter with amusement.
John can’t help the wicked grin that jumps to his face. Perhaps he dislikes her so much because she’s closer to kin than he wants to admit, “Why? Do you want to?”
John had been writing a rambling blog post to fill the time, joking about the heat and explaining their absence from crime solving due to Sherlock’s illness. John had been idly wondering who Sherlock tormented with his illnesses before John had come along and the subsequent comments on his blog prove just what John suspected, which is basically that Sherlock keeps working until he collapses and either Lestrade or Molly force him into Mrs. Hudson’s care.
John has had his hair washed, in intimacy and necessity. A girlfriend when he was younger was the quiet, tactile sort and then later, all those months he couldn’t lift his left arm entirely and his right only barely, kind nurses and ever so rarely, Harry. He knows the comfort of the feeling well, the kind of thing no one asks for but most people need, apparently even Sherlock Holmes.
John stands up and digs his fingers in a little, jerking Sherlock towards him so that just as Sherlock sucks in a startled breath, hands coming up to brace on John’s shoulders, John’s mouth meets his.
Sherlock’s mouth pulls to one side and then the other.
He leans against the counter next to where Sherlock is still staring at his own tea like he hasn’t noticed the cup is full now. John holds his mug in both hands and gently blows on it, feeling calm enough now to let Sherlock come off of whatever wild train of thought he's currently stuck on in his own time.
Irene has some of that sparkle back, a wickedness playing about her that he’d last seen while she was wrapped in that same coat, perched in a window with all of London's sky framing her smile.
Sherlock’s back jumps under his hands, a chuckle. “I’m sure it will be excruciating.”
“I haven’t said anything.”
“You are not allowed to walk naked about the flat.”
Sherlock sinks down into the bath, looking so much like a grumpy turtle that it sends John into a fit of laughs he thinks might actually border on hysterics. Sherlock sinks his whole head underwater, scrubbing his fingers through his hair and pointedly shaking water all over John and the floor when he emerges. He splays a large, damp hand over the curve of John’s shoulder to steady himself as he steps out of the tub, legs wobbly still.
John reaches out, his reflexes always better than anyone ever assumes, even Sherlock, who he grabs tightly by the jaw, tilting his head back slightly. Sherlock swallows under his touch, but does not pull away, his flint eyes screaming of challenge.
“John,” Sherlock says softly.
“Our own beds,” John adds sharply when Sherlock opens his mouth.
“Up, up.” Sherlock growls, shoving at him. John stumbles back off the bed, laughing when Sherlock drops to his knees, aggressively reaching for John’s pants and nearly sending them both to the floor. John has to grab Sherlock by the shoulders and Sherlock has him by the belt loops and they both stare for a moment until balance returns to the world.
“Ice lolly?” John asks with a grin suddenly wildly out of his control.
When John finally pulls back for air, his chest is heaving, Sherlock is blushed red as a tomato, his breath raspy and shallow in answer.
Desperate times call for desperate measures and despite the fact that he probably looks like one of Sherlock’s homeless network, he goes to check if Mrs. Hudson has some coffee cake left. He could smell it last night and she usually brings thems some anyway but, disappointingly, there is no answer at her door.
The soldier in John seems to run his body for the next few minutes. Once it seems like Sherlock is likely to stay still, John moves to turn off the tap, the water dangerously close to spilling over, and fetches a broom. He sweeps the shards of glass on the floor into a pile, and sets about trying to corral the rest into the sink. He’s just assessing if any more pieces are likely to fall from the wall when Sherlock finally speaks.
John drops a piece of glass in the sink with a sharp clatter that makes them both jump.
John has been quietly sinking beneath it for days and weeks, all his skills and senses dull and grey around the edges. Even knowing it’s happening didn’t mean he could stop it, retreating into the shadows of the flat and his own mind. Sherlock had taken to leaving him behind again, something he hadn’t done since he’d come back, but John didn’t have the energy for the chase. Molly, sharper than any of them have ever given her credit for, offers to take Rosie for the week without prompting, her eyes round and knowing.
The world would look at Sherlock now and think him a fragile, translucent thing, but John’s never seen it. From the first, and through all the stitches and grazes and sprains John’s carefully tended since, John has seen the strength in Sherlock, muscles and bones all at sharp, tight wound angles, ready to explode outward.
John refuses to ask what he’s thinking about.
He has to stop on the street corner and laugh so hard it makes him cough and several concerned passersby ask him if he is okay.
Sherlock stands slowly and shuffles past John into the kitchen. He buttons his shirt up as he goes and grabs his dressing gown off the hook. John is momentarily too horrified by the thought of what Mrs. Hudson has seen, to immediately follow.
“And you asked Irene Adler for help?”
“Now,” John continues, gripping the table so he doesn’t leap over it and
“Come on Sherlock, lean back.”
He walks her all the way to the sidewalk and sees her into a cab. He knows that by not taking Sherlock’s coat back, she’ll be back eventually, but a small, bitter part of him acknowledges that maybe Sherlock wants her around.
And it’s going to be
He drops Sherlock from his grasp but he catches John by the wrist before he can step away, “Wait, John. It’s fine.”
“Christ,” John says again, feeling like he’ll never stop.
“That seems likely.” Sherlock mutters, as if unable to help himself getting in the last word.
...at the moment Dr. Watson. Are you sure you wish to come in?” Irene calls out, sounding endlessly amused.
Sherlock’s eyes roam over his face, still a little foggier than usual, but collecting data nonetheless. His grip finally slackens, John sliding from his grasp but not losing an inch of that ready-to-bolt tension about him.
John ignores him. The door isn’t locked, it never is, so apparently Sherlock is beyond operating a doorknob at the moment, a clear and interesting indicator of his current mental state. John turns the handle and shoves the door open in one swift move so that Sherlock sprawls back into 221B, his head thumping onto the wooden floor with enough force that John knows he’ll have a bruise.
He tries and fails for casual, but his voice is unmistakably slurred and John feels the rattling in his head ratchet up another notch.
“Oh, is it?” John feels himself matching the petulant, sarcastic anger Sherlock is giving off in waves.
John closes his mouth with a click, turning on his heel to ascend the stairs to his bedroom, grab his phone, and flee the flat without so much as a word or second look.
“Besides,” John continues, knowing full well Sherlock isn’t listening, “I’m a doctor too, in case you forgot, and I’ve seen you high enough times to know when you are on the come down.”
Sherlock, if possible, moves even closer. John has to look up at him now, but strangely Sherlock is the one who looks small and unsure.
“Is there a reason you're wearing his coat? Did you have to be naked for this particular experiment? Or this one of your things, something you
John has him pressed roughly back into the counter, so that Sherlock’s not quite standing up straight and their heights are more closely matched. He grabs Sherlock by the waist and by the open collar of his shirt, pulling him in, and Sherlock lets out a sharp, surprised breath against his mouth. Sherlock has one hand in a white knuckle grip on the edge of the counter, but the other traces the bones of John’s face, a strange push and sweep as if he’s identifying and testing each one.
John carefully lifts the newspaper until it covers his blushing face, effectively blocking the vision of Sherlock’s disheveled grace behind paper and print.
“Yes, of course, always.” Sherlock replies dryly, turning on the spot like he’s looking for something.
She gestures again, “locked it! And shouted at me when I tried to let myself in! Can you believe the nerve!”
“John, it’s fine,” Sherlock grumbles, trying to bat John’s hands away and missing entirely. “For a case.”
He rounds on her. She opens her mouth but he cuts her off.
“The sheet is a nice look for you, Sherlock,” John says, falling still. “You know, you can wear your pants around the flat if you like, I don’t care. Mrs. Hudson might but, then again, she might enjoy it.”
John feels sobriety hit him like a bucket of ice water over the head. “He what?”
“Sherlock!” John calls, scrambling out of his chair, nearly dumping his entire side table, cup of tea and all, on the floor in his haste.
“We-we need to talk about this.” John stutters out, feeling betrayed by his own mouth. Talking is the last thing he feels like doing.
“Sherlock.” John says, cursing how hoarse he sounds.
Before he knows it...
Sherlock rolls his eyes, “it was for a case John, I’m not lying. She was the logical choice for the data I needed. I let her have her fun, I was able to get my data. If you are trying to ask why I didn’t ask you? Well, I’m sorry, apparently I missed that you were secretly a trained dominant in your spare time and I don’t believe either of us was expecting this particular turn of events tonight.”
She snaps her mouth shut, her eyes tightening around the edges.
There is something about the adrenaline, the rush of power, in that sound that almost collapses John at the knees. Sherlock, who so often has the world around him struck weak-kneed and silent, now panting quietly, open-mouthed, in John’s grip and the grip of his own addictions.
But, as the knots start to slide and loosen in Sherlock’s hair, so do the knots in Sherlock’s body. He fractures and slides under John’s touch, stretching and sinking in the water as far as his long limbs will allow.
“Stop.” John snaps.
“We’re a bit...
Sherlock’s head falls back, his adam's apple bobbing knife sharp under the skin of his neck as he swallows, “John!”
Irene pulls out her cell phone and snaps a photo.
John’s hands still, opening his mouth to ask, but Sherlock abruptly goes tight under his touch, trembling finely, and John finds himself saying “okay, okay” soothingly before he even realizes the unspoken conversation that’s already passed between them.
Sherlock is muttering his name over and over, petting John’s hair mindlessly, his body curled over John tucked between his legs. John takes his time, mapping the labyrinth of Sherlock’s veins up his arm and down his chest. For a moment, John pauses just over Sherlock’s heart, tongue hot against the skin there before he lunges, pressing his teeth tightly into Sherlock’s pale skin, releasing it again to lick at the coming bruise.
“Legs up,” John says, tapping his thigh as he wraps them around John’s hips. “Arms now,” John adds, and Sherlock’s arms snake around his neck, tucking his face into the soft skin behind John’s ear.
“You first, I don’t want to be distracted.” Sherlock leans up to whisper, dragging teeth over John’s ear and making his hips jerk in Sherlock’s lap.
Sherlock still looks a little dubious but something in his eyes glints like a challenge, like he needs to witness for himself this strength in John.
John chokes, coughing. He sets his tea on the counter, bringing an arm over his mouth.
When they first met, Sherlock treated the addiction like a one off, something he was above and beyond, more than human. Sherlock has grown in time, changed, fought battles of emotion and will that would have broken another man. He’s mostly come out the better for it, but a crack in the stone means things can get in now too.
“What are you doing Sherlock?”
“I was under the impression we were about to have sex, but clearly you’ve changed your mind.”
“The tea is lovely, Mrs. Hudson,” John says, not sure how else to reply, “thanks.”
“What was that?” she turns on him sharply.
“What?” John says, not because he didn’t hear but because he doesn’t understand.
“Your thoughts are depressing.” Sherlock mutters into the carpet after a few moments of tense silence.
Sherlock’s hot breath is creating a damp patch in John’s jeans that feels like torture and tease all at once. He makes the mistake of looking down just as Sherlock tilts his gaze up, his mouth and cheek pressed to the shadow of John’s straining erection and looking utterly pleased with himself.
“Oooooh,” a woman’s voice croons, just loud enough for him to make out, “now that’s a guest that could make this a little more interesting.”
, slipping into something curious and soft under his hands.
Sherlock looks wicked, there’s no other word for it. His curls are all pulled loose of whatever product he uses, soft and disorderly. He watches John carefully through hooded eyes, his face catching passing light from outside in slow snatches, striking across the glisten of his mouth and chin.
“I’m not an idiot,” Sherlock grumbles to his back and John fights down a smile.
“I don’t know how to stop,” he whispers back, his voice hoarse.
John is loath to suggest cutting his hair, he’d never admit it but he loves Sherlock’s hair almost as much as Sherlock does. There is something that wouldn’t be quite right about him without that mop of dark curls, somehow softening the edges of him and hardening the sea foam green of his eyes all at once. A simple twist of his face, tilting those curls one way or the other, can turn Sherlock almost into entirely different people.
his eyes seem to say,
and John has to resist hurling the computer at him.
“Is that what you wanted then Sherlock? Sex? You were going to sleep with Irene before I showed up?”
“Well...” is all John can manage.
When John can finally bring himself to look Sherlock in the face, he’s surprised to find that Sherlock almost looks angry.
Sherlock shifts forward and suddenly winces. Their eyes both dart down and Sherlock mutters, “bollocks” under his breath.
Sherlock hums, but doesn’t open his eyes. “It was a smaller dose, she wasn’t trying to incapacitate me like last time.” He sounds a little clearer now, but there is still a softness to the edges of his words that belies his current state.
Mrs. Hudson suddenly yanks John’s mug out of his hand, replacing it with a bag of frozen peas he didn’t know they had, wrapped in a tea towel.
John knows Sherlock is watching him move around the kitchen, and out of the corner of his eye he catches Sherlock trying to take a step forward, only to latch onto the door frame again.
For a moment, John wonders if this is what it is like to be Sherlock. His brain is boiling like a pot with the lid on, shaking and rattling, and he notices a number of details in the space of a few breaths.
But, Sherlock is still Sherlock and nothing keeps him from his goal for long. He shoves John’s trousers and pants to his knees, John’s cock already hard enough to stand proudly between them on its own. Sherlock skims his lips just along the edge, making John’s fingers sink into his hair as he bites back a groan.
John focuses on not being self-conscious, not sucking in ridiculously. He’ll never be thin like Sherlock is thin, and there are still abs there from army days and chasing Sherlock around since; they’ve just tucked back into the softer edges of a body that enjoys life once more, a feat he’s genuinely proud of.
“Sherlock if you are gonna act like a child, I will treat you like a child and that certainly includes my face never coming anywhere near your face again.”
“Of course I knew. It’s quite literally my job - to distract people from their hungers with new hungers. I’m telling you he’s fine, the method of intake isn’t any more triggering than getting a vaccine.”
John sits back from his laptop, wondering if he should get up and grab Sherlock a cold pack and water, but light fingers on his shoulder stop him in his tracks. Sherlock comes in so close that John can feel his breath ghosting over the side of his face, a shadow on the edge of John’s peripheral vision, and rests his chin on John’s shoulder.
“Sherlock, fuck,” John says, head falling.
The silence picks up where it left off. John’s tea has gone cold. Sherlock does actually smell quite bad and it’s starting to make itself known throughout the room. John is more tempted than he’d like to admit to pour the cold tea over Sherlock’s head.
John collapses onto the edge of the bed and Sherlock strips him of the last of his clothes aggressively, sinking to his knees between John’s legs to mirror their position from earlier.
Her smile ticks up a little more and she steps closer, resting the riding crop on John’s chest.
But, even still, John knows that grief and anger come and go unexpectedly. For all the good they’ve accomplished, it still comes whispering out of the woodwork when he leasts expects it, a fog he can’t see the other side of.
It’s the best thing John’s ever seen.
John has a bruising handful of sheet and Sherlock’s skin over one hip, and Sherlock’s jaw in the other, manhandling him up against the kitchen table as it shrieks across the floor. John sends up a silent prayer of thanks that Mrs. Hudson is out because volume is the least of his concerns right now.
“John,” Sherlock says again, tugging on his arms a little bit. “Come here.”
John makes him promise to sit and stay and fetches the first aid kit from below the sink. He sets it to the side, quickly cleaning the glass and spilled tea from the floor before he turns back to Sherlock who is peering at the bottom of his foot, half in anger and half in interest.
John waits patiently until Sherlock’s head rolls back around to look at him, looking cross that John has stopped moving. John is leaning deeply into Sherlock, one hand pressing into the tabletop next to Sherlock’s hip and one arm wrapped around Sherlock’s back tightly, pulling him impossibly closer. He finds he has no ability to control the no doubt shit-eating grin he can feel pulling at his face but it’s worth it when Sherlock smiles tentatively back, running curious fingers over John’s shoulders and arms.
“There you are,” John kisses him sweetly, “just checking. We’ll have to compare lists some time. Is it vain of me to say I like the taste of myself on your skin?”
“We will talk about it when you are sober.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes so hard he’s lucky they don’t pop out and roll across the floor.
He puts a hand over Sherlock’s on his arm, “It’s okay, I’m not leaving. Do you have a comb somewhere here?”
Sherlock’s eyes are otherworldly silver in the dim light, watching him intently for a moment and then darting away. John feels like he’s never going to stop smiling, running a thumb over the shell of Sherlock’s ear as he watches Sherlock determinedly wrestle with button and zip.
“You keep shifting, one of the springs in your chair is squeaky.”
There is no answer.
The next 10 seconds are ranked somewhere in the longest of John’s life. Sherlock doesn’t actually say anything coherent, but John can hear him mumbling, driving John’s blood pressure steadily higher.
Sherlock’s eyes slide from his hands to John’s face, to the cup, and back around again in a circle. He looks wary but hopeful. For all that he complains, he does enjoy being taken care of where it counts. Mrs. Hudson is proof of that.
“Of course it is,” Sherlock says, sounding a little breathless, “don’t stop.”
John comes so hard he thinks he might black out for a second and blinks back to awareness with his forehead pressed to Sherlock’s, both of them breathing like they've chased a suspect halfway across London.
“What do you mean, what?”
Sherlock grumbles into his pillow and turns his face to John, hair foaming wildly into his eyes. “Please, do enlighten us with whatever you’ve just realized.”
Sherlock collapses inward, quiet and still. John has to pause for a moment, his breath heaving in his chest and adrenaline galloping in his veins.
“Very well,” Sherlock says, turning to him fully. “John Watson, either you get over here in the next minute and have sex with me or I will parade around this flat entirely naked.”

Mike stopped in his tracks out front of the local pub and turned on his heel to face John. "Well you need to stop bein' the person you are now and go back to the Watson you once were! The war is over now, John. It's bloody 1919. Wake up and smell the fresh air." The harshness in his voice made John stand up a little taller and narrow his eyes at his friend, "If I wanted to 'smell the fresh air' Mike," he hissed "I would have-"
“You’re gonna get yourself killed, you know” Greg voiced, walking over to an empty seat and plopping the taller boy into it.
Coffee.

The class chatter began to grow and Mrs. Hudson was having a hard time trying to control the noise before the door opened and a wave of silence followed after. It was as if a pin dropped in the room - harsh breathing and over-beating hearts of the other kids being the only sound. Standing at the door in ragged clothing with sandy blond hair all askew, was a short but sturdy built boy. Checking him out further, he had on old ripped up black uniform trousers and an old tattered yellow and black rugby jacket which rested snugly on his shoulders. Sherlock was instantly intrigued, sitting up straighter in his chair to watch as the young man walk into the classroom to an empty seat in the corner, all eyes glued on him.
"John?" She asked, wiping her damp hands on the dish towel tied about her apron, "No, he's upstairs with you is he not?"
The sudden speech from his flatmate woke John from his sleepy state. "What? Go...out?"
“Nothing, dear.” Jake tried to reply cooly and composed to the best of his ability, “Your parents seem uh…very nice. V-very nice indeed.”
“Come in” Johnuin called, as Stamford popped his head through the door with armfuls of clothes and set them neatly on the bed.
Sherlock nodded and sat back into the bench watching as a grand smile appeared on the boys face when he picked up the small mammal. "Does he 'ave a name, sir?"
"Actually I might be the cause of this behaviour to tell the truth."
Sherlock's eyes widened and his head snapped back to the group of miscreants. Jim never
With one hand cupping John's face and gently using his thumb to stroke his cheek, Sherlock turned to the bowl beside him on the nightstand and wrung out the small cloth, the best of his ability with one hand, and carefully began to wipe John's face; the cool water gracing the worn skin with comfort.
"Mr. Watson, may I remind you that it it forbidden by the house to enter through the main doors unless otherwise told."
"Mr. Lestrade!"
Locker.
It was a little miracle that found him after returning back, a little stroke of luck in the dark - and looking over to the man that changed his life forever after just their first meeting, was enough for him. It was more than enough, far too much. John took a moment to take in the lean yet muscular figure, slowly bringing his eyes up to the milky pale skin of a neck - peeking through the collar of a white button up. He finally ventured to stare at the piercing eyes - that captured his whole body like a siren - along the sharp cheekbones, and then the sleeked back dark head of hair that fought to disobey the forced style and return to a mass of curls. John licked his lips, his attention brought back by the deep baritone voice piercing his senses.
Just as fast as the fire hit him, anxiety rooted itself in his mind and he pulled away, earning a gasp from the other man. "What's wrong?" The deep baritone voice cut through his thoughts.
John immediately went to claw at his ears as he felt the heat of newly formed tears run down his cheeks. "You said you would be safe! You lied! You bloody lied to me damnit!"
“Oh…yea. Sure.”
A minute passed by and the deceive remained silent on the line. John looked on with puzzlement and then watched the other man's face remain still - like a mask. He frowned when the telephone was put back in its place and Sherlock began rummaging through papers on the table.
John felt a wave of bewilderment rush over him, "T-take what?"
Upon running into the name this time on the front of the paper was a sight to behold and once Sherlock trudged through the room in a black waistcoat and dress pants, long silk robe draped over both shoulders, John had to hold back throwing the paper in his direction. It was an easy enough deduction for the detective to make on his part when the words, "Finally made it on the front cover, did he?", came from his mouth.
“Ah, Jacob,” John smiled, cocking the slider of his Browning L9A1 and aiming it casually at the frightened young man, “come for tea?”
Sherlock released his hold on the lapels of John's coat and went fishing in his pockets for something. Once he found it, he held up a small square of parchment.
“Lovely to finally meet you, Jacob” the woman said, looking over to Rosie and winking.
Anderson was already at the shed, bag full of dead blooms as his feet, returning his equipment and grabbing shears. John dropped his sacks and patted the other man on the back. "Great job there Anderson."
“He doesn't look like much of a threat.”
His thoughts were disturbed by a soft knocking at the door and he made no fuss to open it. "Oh, Molly, hello!"
"Sorry mate, got held up at the office,"
"About that garden..."
on top. Of course there had been tears shed from both parties as she happily screamed ‘yes’ and charged at Jacob will full force.
"An eviction notice." Greg stated, voice cutting through the blinding silence.
“Lovely to see you again, Mary.” Moriarty smiled, eyes darting around the classroom all while a hint of something Sherlock could not place, lingered in his eyes.
“Oops!” she giggled, trotting over to her desk to finally join the rest of her squad. Sherlock sat in his seat brimming with anger. His fists remained clenched through the whole class and throughout the morning as he was unable to vent to Lestrade who had messaged him earlier; saying he was staying home for the day because of illness.
"Good. Do clean yourself up a bit, the venue we will be attending is dressier than what you have on." Sherlock stopped in the hall and turned back to the doctor, "Ten minutes."
Queen Yela sat up in her bed with tired eyes as she beckoned her little boy into the room, “John, my sweet child, what are you doing up at this hour?”
"So it worked then..."

Sherlock didn't even register the hurt look on Mycroft's face, nor let his brother finish speaking before getting up swiftly from his chair and snatching up his plate. He bolted up the stairs and ran to his room, slamming the door behind him.
"This one seems reasonable."
John was a little gobsmacked at the soft gesture, still not used to the whole ordeal and unsure as to where exactly the two of them stand. "Sherlock" he chuckled, "that was indecent."
A chuckle from the black haired man graced the warm and comforting sitting room of their flat for a second. Then there were more paper shuffles.
“Seriously?” John looked amazed for a split second before reading the coy smile on the other boy's lips, “Tosser."
Yela cleared her throat until her sons head jerked to the two people in front, “Lord Moran and lady Mary, I would like you to meet my son.”
Sherlock padded over to his chair and plopped down, digging into the curry without a word while ignoring the intent stare from his brother. He mentally pleaded that Mycroft keep his big nose out of his personal issues but was instead rewarded with an intake of breath that made him cringe.
John's eyebrows furrowed at the somewhat familiar voice. He grabbed his cane and got up a little too fast, causing him to wince, and walked to the doorframe.
Happy (late in the day) Update Wednesday!
.'" John's face formed 'impressed' as he snuck a glance at Sherlock, who in turn was eyeing him as well. He laughed at the page and gave the man an adoring look. "'
John was absent from class once again and because of that, Sherlock's mind was everywhere but in the classroom. He had flubbed several times on the violin which made Mrs Hudson shoot him some questioning glances. It was when the class was emptying and only Mrs Hudson and Sherlock that remained, when she approached him on the matter. “Sherlock, would you mind staying for a few minutes?” She asked, gently closing the lid of the piano. Sherlock clicked the last clasp of his case closed before turning in her direction.
(See the end of the chapter for
"John. We need to go. Now."
“For how long?”
"Not used to small talk, are you?" John asked, a hint of a grin forming on his lips.
It was then when the figure of Lestrade greeted the other man with a bow of his head and called two other footmen to deal with the luggage. John guessed that there were words between the two men and then realized those two figures were walking in his direction. John quickly went back to picking at a few wildflowers that hugged the fronts of his boots, in an attempt to cover up his intrusion.
"You're John Watson, my gardener and my heart."
“What's this for?”
John could have jumped in excitement but instead pulled Molly in and gave her a big ol' smooch on the cheek. Her face couldn't have turned a darker red at the gesture, and she nodded at him before disappearing up the steps.
“Leave me alone, Sherlock” the blonde called back, still walking toward the exit doors.
“He had it coming for ‘em” Moran piped in, voice growly and barely used.
"Of course, Mr. Watson."
"To the shops, we need some things."
John flushed at the comment and his eyes widened as Holmes' eyes darkened.
“He was drunk that day, just like all the others. Came home from wherever they shipped him off to and he brought it with him. The gun."
Johnuin chuckled, swaying to the music while the man led them around the room, “Quite an observation. Are you master in reading people's thoughts, sir?”
A female voice flitted in through the silence and Jake thanked the maker for the attention change. “Just lovely to be back and around such good people,” Mrs. Hudson chimed, looking fondly at Jake with a wink.
“So you can get this,” Sherlock waved the book in his hand, “…and this” with the other, Sherlock dug into his trouser pocket and pulled out some notes.
"What do people normally say after you spit out their lives in front of their faces?"
“Apologizing!” Sherlock yelled back before opening the doors and heading to where he for sure knew John’s sanctuary was. The library.
Sherlock shook his head, eyes glued to the grass under his shoes. His back was getting sore from leaning against the tree, but he didn't really care. He had to make plans for how to deal with Moriarty and his crew until the year ended.
"...I can do nothing to stop you."
“Well I can still get my food, don't need him to be here to get it.”
"Hey!" Greg called out in irritation.
"Enough of the chit-chat, Braddock," Anderson cut in, "Lord Holmes will be returning tomorrow and these weeds need to be taken care of."
"What are you on about?"
Sherlock's eyes snapped open and his hand went to the back of his head immediately, “What did you do….”
The front of the page was intricately decorated with a vine border holding several musical notes within its foliage. On the top of the page read the local pubs name and an event so posh that caused John to roll his eyes. However, a quite bold and underlined price caught his eyes with great interest and as he stared at the darkened ink of the pen he knew right away what this was. This was yet another job opportunity.
THANK YOU!!
"No! And I don't need to, nor do I even want to."
Once the short boy was at a safe distance, Sherlock let out a breath of relief. He had gotten through another day.
Silence.
Sherlock dabbed the corner of his mouth, before returning it to his lap and looked at John with such seriousness. "Dr. Watson, since you claim to be much more observant then from our first meeting, you should realize that my appetite is slim to none."
"Oh sod off!" John laughed, tackling his husband to the ground and pinning his hands above his head, "Just promise me that experiment testing will be limiting and non-life threatening. At least on me, that is."
"Yes but I need to speak with Mr. Lestrade." John continued down the path, edging closer to the doors. He heard quickly paced footsteps behind, and then paused to turn around with a sigh. "Yes, Anderson?"
Thanks so much for reading!
It seemed that his comment didn't effect only him, and he saw the man readjust himself and open his mouth slightly. "U-um, I- I believe so. Yes."
John's eyes took it all in and a grateful smile formed on his mouth. "This is perfect, Mr. Lestrade, thank you. This is 'bout the best room I've ever stayed - I even have my own window!"
"Very well. Good day, Mr. Watson."
In the front hall with arms crossed over his chest stood his father, Siger Holmes himself. He wore a frown that looked none too pleased and remained silent until his younger son shut the door behind him.
John let out a sarcastic sigh, “Calm down, Cheekbones. How the hell else ya gonna get that shite out?”
"I um....I was wondering....if..."
A small smile played on the gardeners lips at the sight of his Lordship stumbling with words. "Go on."
Bingo.
"See," John set the mug down on the small table beside and leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees, "when you say it like that, it's not very convincing."
Sherlock stayed quiet for a minute, watching him - examining him - before he nodded, "As you wish." he turned around at the door and proceeded to leave.
Johnuin shook his head with a sly grin as he turned to his sister, “Pleasure as always,
John rolled his eyes when he heard another knock at his door. "Come on it!" He called out, ripping a piece of bread and plopping it in his mouth just as Lestrade entered.
“Oh, dear it's just lovely to see you again!” The woman cooed, not even realizing the other body that had taken to stand beside the girl she was engulfing. Jacob awkwardly was holding all of the bags in both hands but refused to interrupt the reunion and took to smiling awkwardly while he stood there……awkwardly.
Sherlock turned his narrowed gaze to Greg, who in turn tried to hide a snicker behind a hand. “It's quite funny actually, seeing you pine over him. Craving his attention.”
"John?"
There was complete silence before the footsteps of his insufferable brother descended the flat stairs and the door shut behind them.
Ten minutes turned to twenty and then thirty. Sherlock had already scribbled notes on two pages of his notebook (double sided) when the taps were turned and a flushed, dripping and steamy John Watson - wrapped up in his stripe dressing gown - padded into the hallway.
John chuckled and Sherlock spoke up, "Which is exactly why we've come, Mrs. Hudson. I would like to book out John's room for several hours."
Sherlock went to help John up but his hands were pushed aside and a desperate look flashed across John’s eyes which caused him to pause.
John just stares at her stonily, not bothering to grace her with a defense or reply.
Every other time Sherlock has swanned off for drugs, it’s been on the coattails of whatever ultimatum or ticking bomb or mad case they were on. Somehow, it was less worrisome when there was a tangible, logical reason behind it. When John couldn’t judge because he succumbed to his addictions just the same, always torn between Sherlock and Mary, Mary and her past, the part of him that wants cozy sweaters and tea and the part of him more at home with a gun than a baby bottle.
“I don’t know what’s so bloody amusing John,” Sherlock mutters, but his tone only makes it all the funnier.
Sherlock sighs, gingerly setting his head back down on the couch cushions, wheezing pathetically.
Sherlock too, seems to be pleased, if the ticklish humming into John’s skin is any indicator. He runs his slender hands around John’s hips and up his back to span his shoulder blades, each individual finger pressing in tightly.
When he can quell the shaking in his hands, he manhandles Sherlock’s tall frame up off the rug and onto the couch. Sherlock keeps sliding boneless from his hands and complaining in a barely intelligible voice the whole way.
Sherlock watches him for an intensely long moment and John ignores him steadily.
“Do you think she knew, when she looked at me, that I was a monster?”
John knew it was coming and still he chokes. “Well, um…”
He’s exhausted, but he knows he won’t be able to sleep in this oppressive heat, nightmares of hot sand and hotter sun inevitably waiting for him. Instead, he picks up his laptop and tries to decide where the coolest place in the flat might be.
Sherlock just manages to level himself up to his elbows, though it takes him a long, uncoordinated moment, John sitting back on his thighs to allow him a little room. Sherlock would almost look cross if he didn’t also look so utterly blissed out.
“Oh yes John, like that’s ever worked.” He truly isn’t drunk enough for the level of sarcasm in her voice right now. “Besides, he’s locked the door.”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock whispers into the skin of his temple. John turns in surprise, Sherlock’s mouth dragging across his cheekbone before they both pull back.
Before he can step back and regain his footing, Sherlock is crowded in his space, looming over John. How he manages to loom so in nothing but a towel and looking like soggy toast, John may never know, but loom Sherlock does.
It occurs to him, rather too late, that he might be more buzzed than he initially realized. She looks him over with an intensity that would put Sherlock to shame and huffs loudly.
“Don’t be ridiculous John,” Sherlock mutters into the tender skin across the plane of John’s hip, making him jerk, “I haven’t done anything yet. You hardly know how good I am at anything.”
Sherlock is very quiet for a moment and then he lifts his head properly, staring with a look John can’t read.
John turns his head just slightly to look up and is surprised to find Sherlock staring down at him, eyes wide. As the standoff holds, Sherlocks features fall and reshape into a hungry look, his eyes going dark and keen.
“Stop, Sherlock, stop!” John repeats, catching Sherlock by the wrists. Sherlock’s feet slip from under him again and John just barely manages to drag him back onto the toilet lid.
Sherlock curls into the back of the couch as John covers him with the throw, still muttering to himself, and John considers him safe for the moment. John stomps past Irene into the kitchen, knowing she will follow.
Sherlock drags his tongue up the column of John’s neck, sliding his teeth and tongue along stubble before he bites down on the line of John’s jaw, drawing out a startled moan. John’s hands flex against the muscle of his thighs, making Sherlock bite harder, a feedback loop of pleasure.
Sherlock is rubbing at his temples, face creasing and smoothing in turns, trying to soothe the violence inside his skull.
“You know, Dr. Watson. The best way to stop an addiction is to find a new one. As I said, business security for me. Perhaps you should consider the merit of...distraction.”
John has single-mindedly marched halfway to a brekkie sandwich and coffee from a pot that Sherlock isn’t growing algae in, when he realizes his phone isn’t in his pocket. He waffles on the sidewalk for a moment, wondering if the hunger or the anxiety will win out.
“Well I’m sure we could fix that,” John says lightly, just an edge to his voice letting Sherlock know he’s not entirely beyond the idea of dragging him back out and tossing him in the river for Lestrade to find properly. “Are you hungry? Perhaps you should change first, you’re dripping on the rug.”
“And keep it down you two,” she calls as she pulls the door closed behind her with a lascivious wink, leaving John and Sherlock trapped in a silence so awkward and deafening, John hopes idly that some criminal will blow up the flat just to make the madness stop.
“All right, all right,” John mutters between them, biting at Sherlock’s mouth in answer.
Sherlock points towards the side table next to his chair on which John’s own laptop is currently sitting open, screen dark. John picks it up and sits heavily in his own armchair, bringing it out of sleep to see what Sherlock had been reading.
John slams into Sherlock, who only just manages to keep his footing, rocking back on his heels, while John pins the sheet precariously to Sherlock’s hip with both hands. It takes a moment for John to fully understand the predicament he’s in.
John looks down at Sherlock’s long, slender fingers wrapped around his wrist and has to mentally stuff this all in a box for morning, the uneasy swooping of his stomach from earlier returning with it’s new friend, a low grade, grinding headache.
John kisses him gently this time, none of the urgency or violence of before.
She leaves the room with a clap to John’s shoulder and a wave.
5 blissfully peaceful minutes later, John realizes something is wrong. The water is running but the sound hasn’t changed to suggest a body in the tub, nor has he heard Sherlock stumbling around to get his clothes off or splashing into the water.
He crowds Sherlock back against the couch so quickly that Sherlock trips over the throw he left on the floor and into the battered loveseat with an oof of surprise, forced to look up at John now who is employing every looming skill he’s ever learned watching Sherlock.
“Sentiment,” he finally says, a note of curiosity to the word.
“An innuendo, “John laughs, “come on, trust me. It’s just a few steps, I promise I won’t throw you on your bed and ravish you like a heroine in a bad romance novel. I’ll put you down in the hall.”
“Yes!” John catches himself yelling and immediately draws back. “Yes. You don’t need to be skulking the alleys of London, high and looking like you got in a streetfight. Put some ice on your face and amuse yourself.”
John tries the handle, somehow still surprised to find it locked even though Mrs. Hudson said it had been. He curses, he should have grabbed a spare key from her! Why would he ever bother carrying his own? It’s not like Sherlock has ever locked this door in his life.
John combs the conditioner through Sherlock’s hair, working gently. The line of Sherlock’s shoulder is tight but he is quiet, his fists clenching and unclenching along the plane of his thighs.  It can’t hurt, John is being unbelievably careful not to pull from the skin, but it’s still probably a lot of stimulation for Sherlock, coming in when his mind is least guarded.
John leans down to press his mouth to Sherlock’s, giving Sherlock plenty of time to pull away, but Sherlock leans into the touch. John wonders at the absolutely wild mess his life has become, at the surprising softness of Sherlock’s mouth, full of sharp teeth and words, at the cool touch of Sherlock’s hand over the bones in his wrist.
Frankly, it doesn’t surprise John in the slightest to find Sherlock in Buckingham Palace wrapped in a sheet. In fact, it’s so on brand for Sherlock, he almost feels relieved at the sight. If Sherlock, who undoubtedly knew where he was going, refuses to put on clothes for Queen and Country, then whatever this is is just another case and Sherlock is still resolutely Sherlock.
“Pretty sure it’s not just me and Mycroft,” John replies, “you don’t exactly portray an aura of…”
From the depths of his own shadows, Sherlock whispers something half to the floor that John only just catches.
Her eyes light up with delight, “Why John Watson! Do you like to be called daddy?!”
John stares and stares, watching the sunset light play over Sherlock’s face, the fan still playfully rustling his hair on each pass. Sherlock, in keeping with John’s estimate of his perfection, doesn’t fidget or quail under the scrutiny; instead, he lets his eyes slide closed, breathing carefully through his mouth and allowing John to look his fill. The blush recedes from his face slowly, his illness and recovery leaving him even paler and thinner than usual, and still John can’t stop looking. When Sherlock finally opens his eyes again, they are soft and dark and a little tired, lit with promise and anticipation.
“Despite what you think, Sherlock Holmes, you can’t read my mind.”
Sherlock ignores him, his hands coming up under his chin, his eye falling shut.
John rubs a hand over his face. “What is this, exactly? Should I leave? Put a sock on the door on the way out?”
John chokes on his tea.
It’s a lot, leaving John feeling a little sore throated and satisfied as he pulls back with a slick pop, the ends trailing over his lips and down his chin. He closes his eyes and breaths hard for a second, trying to catch up with his own racing heart. John feels fingers trace the line of his jaw, drag through the mess of his mouth, and he darts his tongue out to catch. When he opens his eyes,  Sherlock is staring down at him with utter delight, reaching to press his thumb to John’s bottom lip and biting at his own in mirror.
Sherlock shifts.
Sherlock starts wrestling with his jacket and shirt like they are strangling him, pulling desperately at the fabric, trying to pull it all up over his head in one move and only succeeding in getting tangled and tearing a few seams. When John grabs him by the sleeves he falls still and allows John to untangle him from the fabric more gently.
Silence sinks around them.
“God you’re slow,” he mutters.
She looks back and forth between them both, a fond smile on her face.
John gestures wordlessly to Sherlock’s dangling foot and Sherlock only shrugs. The bones of Sherlock’s ankle feel brittle and sharp under John’s hands, but John is thankful to find the cuts there won’t need stitches either. He taps the edge of the tub, motioning for Sherlock’s other foot, which Sherlock finally lifts after a long, agonizing moment. Luckily, this one has escaped unscathed through some miracle and John lets him go gently. Sherlock lets both his pale feet sink to the bottom of the tub once more, hissing at the hot water on his cuts.
John pulls away, Sherlock’s fingers just brushing his arm but not quite catching, and stands quickly, avoiding the look on Sherlock’s face.
A story about a young celebrity who tried to report abuse, her husband claiming she frequents BDSM sex clubs. High profile, probably the husband has got off on charges before or Lestrade wouldn’t have brought it to Sherlock’s attention. It’s a mere 3 at best, the police would have figured it out eventually. The picture has her ducking press on the steps outside a courthouse, her curtain of long dark hair failing to hide her tears or the large bruised scrape across her cheek. Brick wall, John thinks idly, someone pressed her into it and then let her fall.
“I’m not tired,” Sherlock finally says, sounding dangerously close to whinging.
“Now hang on,” John says, following him, feeling a little angry himself now. “Tedious? Talking to me is tedious?”
Mrs. Hudson pats John on the face and lets him go, handing him a cup of tea with lemon, no sugar, no milk. “And you best slow down on the pints with Stamford. At this rate I’ll outlive both of you.”
Displayed proudly - even though slightly out of place - stood a half burned candle. The evidence of its one warm flame still lingered through the dry, melted wax and charred wick. Johnuin took a breath, tentatively touching the cool texture before his mind flooded with memories of that evening, twelve years ago.
Lunch came a lot slower than usual. Sherlock and Greg ended up taking the normal table at the back but void of lunch this time 'round.
The thoughts ceased however when the man in his arms made a sound almost as if attempting to form words but failed. Sherlock looked down at him and noticed that his eyes were still closed and heavy. He subconsciously picked up his speed as his feet lead him in the direction of the dragons. It would be a bad idea, of course. A very very very bad idea. But it's the only plan he has, and Mycroft would have to deal with him before he could even lay a hand on Johnuin.
Sherlock couldn't help but spot the large textbook the boy carried around everywhere, now that it was exposed on the lid of the grand piano. Medical textbook. Interesting, he wants to study medicine. Medicine = Doctor.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Good evening to you as well, brother mine. And such lovely weather we're having today."
“But that's silly, mummy” Johnuin giggled, earning a smile from his mother, “humans can't breathe fire.”
“You know I…I’ve never told anyone about that day…” John whispered, head still bent and eyes downcast.
"Oh John that was the exciting bit! Guess who I'm going with!"
"The musicians banquet! I-I know this! Molly received an invitation as well."
"And you're ashamed?"
John took that as an indication to get up from his seat and limped to the table, reaching for a pen with a sigh, and throwing it over to
_____
“Off to battle.”
It would be the words that eased him, yet the same ones that put doubt and uneasiness in the pit of Sherlock’s stomach.
Jacob took a deep breath at the comment and shut his eyes to say a small prayer for his life. If the parents were one challenge he could only imagine the rest of them. When he had remained silent, Rosie walked over to wrap her arms around him from behind, “Aren't you excited?”
Sherlock's eyes widened and he ran to their bedroom, shuffling through the sheets until they were all nestled in a heap by the door. He rummaged through the dressers simply ignoring the wreck he had caused to his sock index before hearing a small laugh from behind. Kneeling at the side of his bed on the floor, sat John, hand cradling the small golden piece of their bond in his hands before slipping it on and facing his husband with a loving smile.
“He ended up walking off and quitting, and now he expects double tomorrow!”
But that still didn't stop him. The more he fought, the more John wished there was a hole that sank deep beneath the Earth to swallow him up. When Sherlock finished spouting insults and crushing the man's intelligence, he simply turned to the doctor with a thin smile. "Now, before Mr. Anderson rudely interrupted the reasons behind my journey with his appalling face-"
Comments & Kudos are always appreciated <3
Sherlock nodded. What an ordinary name.
“Goodbye, Lestrade.”
He reached for the handle and turned, opening the door slightly, "Mycroft! I demand a new
Another chapter!! Weeee
Mycroft fell silent, eyes still remained bore into John with a hint of disdain. "Dr. Watson, may I remind you that this whole situation is not a
Cute and practically driven to a heart attack, Jacob thought, leaning against his window in shame.
“Bodyguard.”
"Well, now I guess my days planned." John joked and leaned on his cane.
He could tell just by the red ink on the sheet that it was a rent notice form. He had already missed out two payments this month and the landlord was growing short.
“I see our ‘Lockie’s alone today. Did your pet dog abandon you once realizing how sad of a human being you are? Oh sorry, wrong choice of words,” Jim smirked, eyes catching the light and making them look even more reptile-like, “
When he looked up, Mike's eyes were written with concern and pity. "I never said it was. John," he took a breath, "There are people, you know. Who you can talk to."
John deflated instantly, "M-my apologies my Lord! I did not mean.....I spoke out of place....f-forgive me."
There was a small piece of orange, sliver of raw steak and a cube of cheese. All of this was of course accompanied by a small dish of milk. John sniffed it warily.  "Oh for god sakes, John, it's not spoiled!" John had just looked at him and Sherlock could right away image the human equivalent of an sarcastic eyebrow raise.
A gift on my birthday for you lovely people :)
The sun was already starting to make its way slowly to the horizon when John was walking along the dirt path to home. He had secured a good collection of five pairs of working gloves in his person, thanks to the amount that Lestrade had so generously given him. He checked his watch, noting that dinner would normally be served to the house very soon and he took a deep breath. Living in several different houses, and constantly moving around in order to find a good enough place to settle down permanently, was John's end goal. Only being twenty-eight and having no real inspiration or motive to settle down and marry, was not something he thought of regularly. He wanted a sense of security, but at the same time he wanted excitement.
The reply took less than five minutes, and Sherlock beamed once his phone lit up.
"I am sorry, my Lord." John bowed slightly feeling utterly embarrassed. "If only one pursuit is permitted, I will be thankful."
There was a beat of silence. John slouched against the door, head leaning against the window in defeat before the quietest reply came from his shaky voice, “I did...”
"Police don't consult amateurs."
"Mr. Watson! Anderson never mentioned he saw you run here as well! I'm sorry sir, but I only have one jacket."
,” he spat “All my life I've dealt with you're kinda people and look where it got me!” John shoved Sherlock back into the wall and marched to the loo doors. “I want double tomorrow, Cheekbones.
"Jesus, John! What the bloody hell have you done?!" Hoisting his limp friend onto his shoulders, Greg guided John back to the loveseat.
“S-sorry?”
“Hm? Why?”
Sherlock smiled, turning his head to plant a kiss on John's head. "Not so bad yourself."
John's eyes widened and a large smile engrossed his mouth. "Thank you, Mr.Lestrade!"
“Leave him be, Moriarty. He has no quarrels with you.”
Weeks went by with lunches that dragged on and on each time he sat down at his table. Like clockwork, Jim Moriarty and his gang of thugs would corner him, either spitting in his juice or throwing his food half across the room. They threatened for his cash but Sherlock stood to his word, refusing each and every time. On multiple occasions he would end up locked inside a locker or pushed against the bathroom wall to be decked in the stomach and keel over on the dirty ground. Enough was enough and he was losing his patience.
John headed over to the shed and loaded the gloves into a bin before he noticed the sacks of pulled weeds. They were, no doubt left aside to be thrown into the forest out back after they dried up, and John took a peek inside anyway.
John froze, eyes widening and glued to her face. "J-Jim Moriarty?"
"So, what do you think?" Lestrade asked beside him, a hint of a smile wrapping it's way into his voice.
Sherlock ruffled his hair in frustration before leaning in closer so that John's small snout was inches away from his own nose. If he wasn't going to get a plain answer, then he would deduce it.
Sherlock hummed in reply. "M, M, M." he held up a sheet to his face, "Matthew?" A scrunch of his nose, and he tossed the paper over his shoulder.
Thank you so much for the Kudos and for those who have taken the time to read my fic. It is such a motivation when writing to know that people are enjoying it. Thank you again <3
Laughter erupted amongst them and the violin playing from above stopped abruptly. Stomping of footsteps marched across the upper floor, the opening of a door following soon after. "Mrs. Hudson!" A deep voice rang through the stairwell and into their room. "You and your 'guest's' obnoxious and unnecessary laughter is polluting the quiet atmosphere of this studio! If you would like to proceed with such pleasantries I suggest taking it to the streets!"
What did it matter, though? John’s first impression on the man had been a fiasco, and then the way William’d cut right through to the marrow of John’s worst time of his life? The whole thing was a bust.
Sherlock lifts his chin to see the doll. John had faced it away from their bed the other day, but now in the congealing darkness, he can see the glint of glass eyes fixed on them.
That’s shudder-worthy.
“Yeah, yeah.” His mind spun like a tilt-a-whirl.
He waved at her. “No, it’s alright, Bonnie. We all have things.” He tried to keep his cadence even. Normal. She had to know who she was. He had to give the post office his legal name in order to keep his PO boxes here. This was the longest he’d stayed in any one place, and in the early days when he’d dashed in and out, Bonnie had only waved and smiled. With time, they’d started talking. Sometimes they bumped into each other at the supermarket in town. He had the feeling she knew all about him, but went out of her way to be welcoming.
Summarily dismissed. John frowned harder. Bit his lip. Thought about texting. Didn’t.
“Jesus Christ, I don’t mean to be like this.” He raised his eyes to the ceiling as he rubbed one hand over his mouth. The ceiling was a yellowed beige. Not especially pleasant. “I have baggage, and I’d rather…” But he couldn’t bring the words to the surface.
“Nah, I’m having a good time. Aren’t you having a good time?”
He owned a small chain of restaurants in north London. John googled the restaurant’s name and found nothing about it in the news, aside from the opening and some reviews. The reviews were all positive.
William smirked. “John. I couldn’t imagine anyone calling you a wilting flower without getting their nose bloodied.”
I’m happy for you.
John cupped William’s face with his hands. “My room?”
Until he spotted him, and his stomach plummeted in an arching swan dive. Doctor Chowdhury had led him to none other than the man John had ghosted during a fit of insecurity and self-pity.
“As loud as a dinner bell. Which reminds me, what are we having tonight?”
“I ran out of scalpel blades.”
“John, hi. This is Rebecca.” Doctor Rebecca Baker was a supreme professional, and John admired her work ethic. “I’m afraid to inform you that one of the nurses here has tested positive for COVID-19. And what’s more, I’m afraid I need to ask you and your family to self-isolate for two weeks.”
Victor shot him a look. “Wife and child?”
“Mike, I can’t believe we’re talking about this.”
Pebbled nipples seemed to beg for attention. John captured one in his mouth, and sucked and swirled his tongue, drawing a long, strangled moan from William. He dragged his tongue across the stretch of skin from one nipple to the other, nibbling, biting down softly and relishing the reward of William’s whimpers. This tight, muscled body was all John’s for the night, and the thrill of that curled his toes.
He turned around and marched through the trees, back onto his porch, and inside his tiny cabin. Threw himself into the chair and typed out a reply to Mike.
“John,” Sherlock said in his ear. “Am I to deduce that my feelings are somewhat returned?”
Hamish’s buddies had helped. Together, they’d formed the Georgia Liberation Front, a small militia group that believed in the Coming Economic Collapse and the inevitability of a US civil war. Weekend drills and war games kept their instincts sharp and skills unparalleled in ground warfare. It was all John knew for a time; he’d grown up believing it was what all men did. Then he’d entered his teens, and Hamish Murray’s growing belligerence had shoved him away while the internet sprung up and John finally saw how other people lived.
“The doll - er, Rose, I mean. Rosie.”
It was too much.
Anger issues. Trust issues. Same old, same old. It resurfaced now and again in their sessions, but this last time...this last appointment was different. And not just the last appointment, but the last few. The anger was getting old, like a creaky hinge begging for oil. He was tiring of it himself, the constant grating, the sharpness, the heaviness.
“I want you,” he said, staring at William’s flushed face.
William paused. Turned to face him. “Been clean for ten years.” His eyes were serious. Assessing.
So why is he still having these dreams?
John smiled as his chest bloomed with relief. Sherlock was talking to him.
“Yeah,” John said.
“What would you like to drink? I came up with a signature cocktail for tonight if you want to try it,” Molly said. “It’s Pisco with kiwi and lime. I think people are really liking it.”
His phone buzzed in his pocket.
“No! That’s - that’s not true!” His heart hammered, his ears rushed with heat, the ice breaking away with a wave of crackling anger. “I don’t think you’re a machine, I know you’re not, and I’m sorry I ever called you that, but you are definitely an arsehole. You - you can’t know what it’s like. I’m in your shadow, and that’s fine. But I’ve got to know that you - you’re human, sometimes. Sometimes you’re so much bigger than us, and I think -’well, he’s my best friend, I know him the best’ - but the truth is, I really don’t! You’re so bloody secretive about everything, and I hate it!”
Sherlock wakes with a start. Sweat lays cold along his shoulders and in the dips of his clavicles. For a second, he can think only of those dolls: beady-eyed, malicious, dead gazes all. Bisque and China dolls. Plastic dolls and cloth dolls. Joyous, innocent smiles turned eerie and sinister. A roomful of dolls, their sightless eyes settled on him.
The world around Sherlock snaps, broken like a piece of plastic stressed beyond its threshold. He pushes the sense of upheaval aside and lifts his chin. “You don’t remember.”
He used to torture himself with those thoughts. If he hadn’t been so serious about acing his exams, if he’d taken it easy sometimes, if he’d gone home—how many deaths could have been prevented? How many deaths were there in the end?
He undid the zipper, the clicking of its teeth soft and suggestive. William lifted his hips as John yanked the pants off, admired muscular legs that seemed to go on forever, laughed as he had to untie shoelaces to shove off shoes and socks. “What are you even doing with me, when you’re like some Greek statue?” He kissed the inside of William’s thigh, letting his eyes wander over the outline of William’s erection.
“What?” John yanked back to an upright position. “But - you said -”
“Fuck.” John almost fell onto the bed, grabbing the condom and knee-walking his way to William’s body lying in the middle of the mattress. In a moment, he’d removed a condom from its packet, and rolled it down on William’s cock. He followed it with lube, stroking and slicking as William’s head dropped back on the pillow with a loud groan.
Sometime later, his palms clammy and his mind a fog, he swept the shards onto the dustpan and emptied them into the trash. He wouldn’t call anyone. He wouldn’t let anyone know he looked. He would just push it behind him, and never let Mary have the satisfaction of knowing that he looked. That she’d successfully rattled him.
A mother keeps her eyes on the child, like being riveted to the vaulted acts of a tightrope walker. A mother is the net, spread thin and wide, waiting below - and now she’s spread so thin as to be unhelpful. Threads fraying. Snapping. Somehow, she missed him when he fell.
When he was able to open them again, he found himself wracked and worn, slumped over William with a sticky mess between them.
The return address? He glanced at the envelope.
John doesn’t say anything.
Jesus.
Sat in his chair, temple on his fist, facing Sherlock's chair. Whenever the image of his friend’s head and blood on the sidewalk interrupted his thinking, he redirected his thoughts to pathways in the lungs. Breathing involves the diaphragm - it contracts, creates a vacuum, a space, where air can rush in and the lungs expand. To exhale, the diaphragm relaxes and moves upward. Expansion and contraction, like the gentle opening and closing of butterfly wings.
The ceiling vaulted, and several smaller sparkling chandeliers orbited a large one at the center. No windows peered to the outside, yet it remained an open, cavernous space, so much empty air above him compared to where he stood—hemmed in on all sides by white-dressed tables and donors swanning about, wine glasses held aloft in manicured hands.
Energized. Alive
“He didn’t - he didn’t apply too much pressure on you, did he?”
To his surprise, an envelope sat inside the box. Plain white. Handwritten address. A fan, then? Not his editor or his agent. They communicated through email.
He shouldn’t have quit coffee. It was dinnertime, but he was exhausted, and a cup of joe would have hit the spot.
He’d been certain that Sherlock wasn’t the type to date or have sex, and yet, and yet…
William was hung. “Though to be fair, you’re more well endowed than the Greek statues I’ve seen.”
“Can we talk about this at home?” John says in a low whisper.
John let himself into his cabin and tossed the mail onto the kitchen table. The letter still lay crumpled on the floor of the car like the carcass of an animal in the road. He hoped to let it rot there. Maybe it’d get stained with coffee and mud, and become unrecognizable litter in the trashcan of his life.
John found himself shoved from his memories and into the third unexpected hug of the day. “It is so good to see you!” Anita gushed, her voice trilling like a bird’s. “Oh! Oops!” She had to disentangle herself from him as the peacock brooch on her blouse caught one of his buttons.
Jesus Christ. It didn’t matter.
John runs one hand over his face. “I thought the war would kill me, but now I’m thinking it might be you.”
John sucked in his cheeks and swallowed. Stared up at the terrible beige ceiling. He nodded. “Okay. But why didn’t you say you knew who I was? Why did you say you googled me?”
He grabbed his jacket and slid his arms into it. “Text me,” he said.
In the shadows beside him sits Rose with her sickle-shaped smile.
It seems as if John’s come to a realisation. He sucks on his lips. His eyes cast at the floor though he stands straight with his shoulders back. “So, uh, you were in my room?” he says.
“I’m sure he’s just busy. He’s got a case that he can work on from the flat.”
But, still… John chewed his bottom lip, trying to ignore the pang he felt at their comfortable proximity, Molly giggling and tossing back her head, her hand still on the too-gorgeous William’s arm. John ran a scrutinizing eye over the line of William’s figure. Fuck, he had an ass on him—
In his haze, Sherlock dives forward to lick the bit from his chin, and savour that particular flavour of John Watson.
This shit was partly why he’d moved away. He slammed the cabinet door. It echoed through his quiet cabin. “Jesus fucking Christ.” He couldn’t let it happen again. He had to take a stand, sometime. What had his dad said to him? Not that Hamish Murray was the cornerstone of rational behavior, but he’d say,
He drew in a breath. “I grew up in the household of Hamish Murray. He was discharged from the army after an injury prevented him from continuing. He married my mother, Jean. I think he really loved her, but… He was discontent with his lot in life. He listened to a lot of conspiracy theorists and conservative news pundits. Idiots who are all about fear-mongering. He really believed all of it; it was like no conspiracy theory was too out-there for him. I don’t know when he joined the Georgia Liberation Front. I don’t remember a time when he wasn’t part of it.
John almost stumbled over the linoleum in his kitchen. She’d never, in the entire decade since his acquittal, asked him about his holiday plans. “Well, like usual, I’ll be spending them in my home. Maybe this year with William.”
William licked his lips and flattened them against his teeth. His nostrils flared. “John. It’s nothing.”
“Oh, John!” Anita was a chubby, brown-skinned woman with waves of dark hair and a glint of diamond piercing in her nose. She had been well-loved by their study group, what with all the baked goods and coffees she dropped off during study sessions. Once, she threw them a party with a huge, inflatable water slide in the backyard. It had been an idyllic time—a single afternoon in the bright sunshine, adults in their twenties throwing themselves down the slide like children, plummeting into a shallow pool of water at the end, hopping out before the next person came down, dashing back to the ladder to do it again. Margaritas and barbecue for those standing by and watching. Shrieks split the air when a person didn’t hop out in time, and slippery bodies piled up at the slide’s end. Laughter followed like the clanging of bells.
What if it was something incriminating?
Curious, John opened it:
“Like you asked. I put her up here. I just…” He shrugs. “I came up here just for a moment. To think about my parents.”
Oh, wait. No ring on the finger.
Sherlock whips his head around the room, peering into the thick shadows. One strip of light enters through the curtains like the blade of a knife. “A fire,” he says.
William dragged his fingers up the stream of John’s come along his chest.
“I know the basic timeline and the charges. Your background seemed sensationalized. But none of that is the same as sitting here, listening to you. Those articles are not truly about you, as much as they are written for the entertainment of the masses.” He squeezed John’s hand. “I am not the masses.”
“Well, you know how she is. She said ‘things were fine,’ and from her, that’s aces.”
It felt...normal.
John put her on the floor and watched as she ran back down the hallway toward the kitchen. The odour of cooking spices wafted in the air as he hung his coat and removed his shoes, sliding his feet into a pair of comfortable house slippers. A corner of peeling wallpaper caught his eye - the same bit of curl that he’d been meaning to fix for ages. For the umpteenth time, he ignored it, wiping the damp from his neck as he settled into the creature comfort of his evening routine.
“I’m not sure anyone’s interested in meeting me.” John ignored the beer.
“That’s not true,” John said automatically.
“So, got your own ghosts, huh?” Ned stared unrepentantly. His voice reminded John of the burbling noise water makes when sucking at sand as it flows back to sea. If only it would wash all his words away.
“You did! Daddy’s so proud!” He grabbed Rosie and kissed her cheek.
“Hey, I hear you’re doing fantastic work over at the clinic,” Mike said. “Good job.”
“Mostly. Sometimes…” Ned rubbed at his beard. “Things happen. Even when you don’t mean them to.”
John starts forward, but halts. That sudden stop in movement catches Sherlock’s attention. He looks up.
“You make your choices,” John said. “Listen, Spike might be an asshole, but that’s it. Tell him he’s an asshole. No need to bring in his race.”
“Yes, John,” Sherlock says, his cock plumping up as he plans just how he’ll be apologising to John later.
“I’m sorry if I wasn’t very patient. If I...implied things I shouldn’t have implied. I never knew I could feel so deeply about someone the way I do you. It has driven me to distraction. And, apparently, to jealousy.”
John chuckled. TreeMan81 pinged him on a private DM.
Sherlock considers. “This is why you have such a problem with your sister’s drinking. Beyond the usual family concern and inconvenience.”
“What?” John was sure he paled. “No.
“Anything you give me, John, I will be thrilled.”
“Does this mean I can invite you to dinner at mine?”
“What?” John pulls back. “To kill someone?”
“I’m so glad you came. Come in!” She grabbed his arm and pulled him inside. His eyes went wide to see her apartment. Gone were the days of second-hand furniture and cheap prints on the walls gathered from Goodwill. These walls were bright white with framed black and white photos of landscapes. The blacks were deep and dark, like the work of Ansel Adams, but these landscapes were more abstract—the suggestions of peaks and pines rather than the explicit depiction of them. Giant green plants of the jungle variety adorned corners in slate gray pots. Smaller ferns and colorful orchids graced shelves and window ledges. People milled about between a mustard yellow sofa and two Eames chairs upholstered with brown leather. A white shag rug covered the pale hardwood floor in front of a stone fireplace. It was, for lack of a better word, swanky. Modern.
He pauses. The shadows in the room thicken in the corners. The light from the windows dims into a foggy grey. Sherlock waits.
“John?” Sherlock says.
And he should be thinking about that job, about moving and all the particulars that went with that. Not wasting thoughts on this guy who was probably in a thing with Molly, anyway. They might be dating, or on the verge of dating. Flirting with intention, with the promise of fruition. Molly wouldn’t waste her time chasing a gay guy. It just didn’t seem likely. And John’s sense of gaydar wasn’t all that trustworthy, if he was honest with himself. When he’d cheated on Mary, he thought of himself as a straight guy who enjoyed fucking guys. He had a girlfriend, right? Therefore, not gay.
“I—I thought it might be.”
Sherlock points to the doll. “What is she doing here?”
Ella had smiled. “No. You can’t. I suggest you take small steps. You’ve talked about getting out more. Finding a part-time job to supplement your income. That’s one way you can meet people.”
He didn’t even know how to reach her, or if she was still in the state. Alive, even.
“What’s that, love?” she says.
“Great! The bar’s right over here.” She led him past the living space and around the corner to a dining nook. The table was oval with a hammered copper top. Copper-colored bistro-style chairs hemmed it in. They looked hard and unwelcoming. An archway framed the entrance to the kitchen, obscured by a wooden beaded curtain. That particular touch seemed very Molly.
“How did you break away from such a constrictive mental framework?”
Sherlock licks his upper lip. Slowly.
Reynolds leans closer to Sherlock. Sherlock can smell the salt of crisps on the man’s breath as he says, “I don’t normally do this while on the job, but do you think maybe we could head out for coffee or a drink sometime? You can tell me more about how you do what you do.” His eyes sweep over Sherlock’s frame. “I’d be an eager pupil.”
Mike Stamford. Rounder than John remembered, with a cheery glint in his blue eyes and the lightest dusting of pink across fair-skinned jowls. He wore a flannel button down and dress pants, just like he did back when they took classes together. His glasses were thin, silver, rather than the thick black frames of their twenties.
In the hallway, he could take a breath. Feel his heart jumping from his chest. He released a little laugh. What an entrance he’d made into this part of the world. Awkward, fumbling, unable to defend himself.
John rubbed his cheek as if to rub away his blush.
John huffs and shakes his head. But he’s smiling.
He guides John to the bedroom and helps him into bed. After taking off his dressing gown, he slides in beside his lover, his John, and spoons up to him, curls his big body around him, and holds him until John’s breath evens out and the tension melts from the man’s body.
“I told you I’d hire movers for you. Why are we wasting time and our backs like this?”
Mike didn’t respond, but John could feel the weight of his gaze. It was awful. William had said it—let it slip, more like. And John had frozen. Went rigid in place while his mind floundered, flailed like a fish out of water. The moment of kisses and laughter in the kitchen slid away and stole the air in the room with it. Then William had pecked him on the cheek and walked out the door. John went to work. They texted like they normally did. William didn’t say it again.
But in the years since, it was all men in random hookups and online sex chats. For a little while, he’d convinced himself that it was because men were easier than women. Men went looking for casual sex. Women didn’t. That’s why it was all men, all the time.
When he got off and headed for the exit, someone shouted his name. “John! John Watson!”
He shouldn’t open it. He absolutely should not open it.
Hard to believe here John was, years later, looking at the chair of his very much alive friend, though said friend was currently suffering from the cause of the world’s pandemic.
None of his encounters had been like this. They’d been desperate and needy, but quick and mechanical. It’d been about getting off as quickly as possible.
“A horse,” she said, as she smashed the paintbrush in the bruised looking purple and applied it to the white paper.
The morning was glorious. John’d awoken to a sleep-tousled William, all soft smiles and warm skin. They managed to fit both of them in the tiny shower stall, and though they didn’t get much washing done, there was laughter, kissing, and mutual, knee-buckling release. After dressing, John walked William to the door, and kissed him goodbye.
The air stinks of smoke and burning plastic, wood ash and charred flesh.
And like hell it is.
“It’s also why you are particularly affected by domestic cases, and strive for justice for the victim. Not just because justice in action embodies one of your values, but because you are personally affected by it.”
“Can I have a pillow for my knees, then?”
“I’m here with you still.”
William snorted. Then his eyes skittered over John. “Are you alright?”
“I have. The man uses vivid detail when it comes to medical scenarios, which leads me to believe he is a medical doctor. But his protagonist’s deductions and subsequent actions are clumsy and unnecessarily full of male bravado—oh.” He whirled around to face John, his eyes bright with sudden understanding. “You’re James Sholto.”
John felt his stomach drop. “Shit, Ned, you can’t go around saying that. I ought to kick you out for a day, but we don’t have a rule for this kind of thing. I’ll talk to Shawn about instituting one.”
John hit his head against the front of the sofa.
“Did Mary -”
“You have me,” William murmured, his voice low and promising, setting fire to the match inside John. It flamed like a bonfire, danced down his spine in a ripple of heat.
The blood left his face so quickly John thought he might fall over with the dizziness of it. Cold crawled across his neck, crept down his spine in a nervy shiver, formed a fist of ice in his gut.
“Yes, I have deduced things about you. But romance is but one thing in my life, and it was fleeting and distracting and ultimately unfulfilling. Why are you so obsessed with something I’m trying to avoid?”
Sherlock might help with that. He cured the limp, after all.
“That’s some low-hanging fruit and a terrible excuse.” John pulled off his gloves and closed the medkit. “You’re going to have bee-stung lips for a bit. Like Angelina Jolie.”
A woman hurried two wide-eyed kids along, her palms on their shoulders and concerned wariness etched into her features. He waved to her in a useless gesture, and slumped in his seat. His eyes landed on the letter in his lap. Summoning all of his anger, he balled it up in his fist and threw it onto the passenger floor. “Fuck you,” he told it.
Thank you so much to all those who read, dropped kudos, and commented as this went along. I don't expect that it will be reading material for many with these kinds of tags, but like I said, it is special to me. I am very grateful that an audience found it and appreciated it. Thank you.
William only smiled. Like he was waiting.
Two glass eyes, the colour of twilight, gleam in a nest of faux hair.
“You visited Harry?” He seems surprised, and not in a good way.
“Ayup, if that ain’t the truth.” Her gaze settled on him in all its familiar warmth.
“Yeah, would be pretty sticky if we saw other people and brought them home, wouldn’t it?” His voice is back to normal, but his face is tight. His fingers haven’t yielded to Sherlock’s touch.
“But this final family included children.” John crossed his free hand over his chest and squeezed his shoulder. “The only way they knew it was her was because she’d been caught on the youngest child’s nanny cam in the teddy bear. She’d gotten away with it if she’d spotted the cam. She was...she was very good at hiding her tracks.”
Oh god, and those images of the victims. The crime scene. Some fucker had leaked them and splashed them across true crime websites, and even on a subreddit that grossly delighted in the freakish and macabre horizons of human depravity. The elderly people only looked as if they were sleeping. A picture of the person often accompanied these photos when she or he was alive, smiling at the camera in a blessed unawareness of their fate.
“Blackmail, John? Such an ugly word.” The corners of his lips twitched. “It was simply insurance, in exchange for less harassment. In a bid to never have to speak to my father nor brother again, I did everything correctly. I thought of it as part of a game. And I was going to win.
“William.” He smiled weakly and tugged on the lapel of his jacket. The room seemed to fill with hot air as he waited for William to say something. Anything.
As he walked up the steps and the seventh creaked, the voices in the flat paused. Sherlock’s deep rumble started again and was joined by a puff of laughter. John continued up onto the landing and headed to the lounge, where they normally saw clients.
Yes. He’s done well in choosing John Watson.
“Efficient my ass. Help me with these boxes or else.”
I want to take a moment to thank all the WIP readers. Y'all are the unsung heroes of fanfic, and thank you for hanging in there. <3
He’ll learn more about her construction tonight.
John’s mouth went dry. A sense of weightlessness spun out of control below his lungs. He gripped his wine glass so hard it nearly shattered. “Mm. Um, who—who told you?”
He almost ran down the steps and out the door. His heart thumped against its bone cage and his ears were as hot as a sunburn.
“Yes, you do.”
“Funny, he usually responds to your texts quicker than that.”
William looked over his shoulder, not seeming to focus on anything. His features softened as he turned back to John. “There was a point in my life where I could have ended up in a shelter myself, if it weren’t for certain advantages.”
“I know what that is, too.” Hookups. Quick handjobs in shadowy places. The urge to feel something, anything, for a few moments with another person. A warm body.
John is seated in a patch of moonlight on the bed. The scene appears similar to the cover of a book of science fiction. His skin is bleached white from the light and his shoulders pull back while his head tips up toward the ceiling, the slope of his nose pointed to the heavens.
“Yeah. She figured it out. It led to a whole other round of talks about how we had to fix things, how we were going to make it right. She took a job as a part-time receptionist - and god, that must have been killing her. Still killing her. But, I couldn’t bring myself to care, really. We divided our time with Rosie, though she had the lion’s share. I think as a way to do penance, really, so I could go on cases with you. It wasn’t a happy existence, and it wasn’t fair to either of us.”
“I’m not even sure when it changed,” he’d said when she didn’t fill the silence. “It’s...been a while since I’ve gotten any harassment. I’m making an okay income even if my student loans are keeping me poor.” He rubbed at his mouth, eyes drifting to the wall behind her. “I’ve made it work with odd jobs and writing. Mostly. It’s not a guarantee, though. Jesus Christ, this is not how I imagined my life would go, you know?” He was gesticulating with one hand, just letting it dance through the air to make his point. “I thought for sure I’d end up with a family and kids someday, but then it happened. She was pregnant, and I’d had my fun, and now I needed to be an adult and face the music.” He let his hand drop as he locked eyes with her again.
John had so many memories, so many stories. He had spent hours and hours with these wonderful people every week over several years. Working, studying, enjoying each other’s company, entirely ignorant of what Mary had been up to behind their backs.
Especially ten years after his ex-wife’s conviction and his acquittal.
It was a white-hot cleansing, and a burgeoning dawn. Awake and alert to what seemed like a new plane of existence, John placed his fingers at the first button of William’s shirt. He met William’s eyes.
Why though? To what end?
John stands in the center of the lounge, empty-handed. He seems relieved to see Sherlock - his hands press on his stomach and his lips part on a soft exhale. “Hi.” A smile is slow to cross his face. “Will you come in and sit?”
Sherlock laughed, a loud, happy laugh, and John joined in, moving closer, as if he could fuse his body to Sherlock’s.
“Is this an interrogation?” John said.
“Of course not. It’s horrible.”
“I spend a lot of time with my dildos.” John let his head fall back. “Jesus, you’re big.”
“The way you did that, the way you take me so well.” William sounded as though he was in awe.
She hung up before he could respond.
“What really shook us up was him. My fa—Hamish Murray had a drinking problem, and it got worse. He hit my mom, and he hit me. One night, after a hurricane had gone up the coast, he got out his gun, and he was crying… He was saying he should shoot me and her before the government gassed us. I mean,
“You said ‘was’?”
“Yeah.” John tried to think of anything else he could say, any other advice he could impart. Planning for the future wasn’t his strong suit. Not anymore. Not ever, probably. Plan a couple months ahead, sure. Further than that was bonkers. But saying “you can only live in the moment,” sounded either too trite or too New Age-y, and he wasn’t looking to give either impression. “Um, lead a horse to water and all that.”
“If you need to wait—”
A cleansing, and a dawn.
“Was murder.”
Sherlock eyes him as John pulls on his jacket.
“But John. We have a great sex life, don’t we?”
Though it started quickly and star-bright, they slowed it down. John led William to his bedroom. He got out the condoms and the lubricant and peeled William from his clothes. It wasn’t the desperate chase of pleasure. This time was slow and sensuous, like butter melting in a pan. They dissolved onto the bed in a crest of kisses, limbs entangled, mouths pressed together. John touched William everywhere he could, over the dip of his hips, the mounds of his knuckles, the furrows of his ribs. It was as much a baptism by affection as it was making love. When he was ready, John got on his hands and knees. He wanted to feel this glorious body around him, this body that had suffered, that had hurt, that had known grief and estrangement and loss. Entwined in William’s arms and filled by William’s cock, John could feel reborn, seen, and protected. William was his redeemer, and he was William’s.
“So, not far from your clinic. That’s excellent. Let me introduce you to some of your biggest donors.”
“I’m—I’m surprised to see you here,” John said finally. He cleared his throat. “You’re a donor, then?”
John didn’t finish the introduction, knowing his name would be the death knell.
“Hello,” Sherlock says, inhaling the warm scent of cedar. Much more preferable to naphthalene. Perhaps he’ll get vacuum seal bags for some of his items for storage.
“Oh, what do you write? Anything I’ve read?”
Now lying over William, held as if William were a crucible to burn away his sins, John froze. The words of confession pressed against the cage of his teeth, rolled over his tongue in a fury as if trying to flush poison from the body.
William petted his shoulders in a slow stroke. “It’s fine.”
William accepted him without a second thought. Loved him. Would Woody have done the same?
William nodded, one hand slipping into his pocket as the other held the wineglass. “A pleasure to meet you.”
In his chair was none other than Victor Trevor.
“Oh c’mon John, just one more hour. You haven’t met everyone.” Mike tried to hand him a fresh beer from the ice bucket.
“What would make you happy now?”
“How? Because it’s orders? That makes it okay?” Ned snorted.
“I have.”
“You don’t have to tell them what you told me. Let them—”
Cold swirled in John’s belly.
He pushed William against the couch and swung one leg over his thighs to straddle him. William let his head fall back, his mouth ajar and his eyes blown with desire. John followed, smashing their mouths together in a frenzy of want and need. He pulled back long enough to suck on William’s lower lip and an answering whine lifted into the air between them. John mouthed along his jawline and down the side of his neck, savoring every one of William’s small gasps. Erection pressed against erection as hips jerked and thrust.
Sherlock knows which of the steps will creak, so he skips over those as he climbs the stairs, his heart quiet in his chest, his breathing shallow.
“Hey,” John said. “You look, uh, amazing.”
William glanced at him. “I’ve told no one this.”
Jesus Christ.
DC Reynolds appears beside Sherlock. “Another one for the books, eh?” Reynolds is a likeable fellow with deep-set brown eyes and a shock of carrot-orange hair. “Brilliant, as always.”
“John,” Sherlock says, his hands clasping together in front of him as he tries to make John understand. “You came home after that awful row we had, and told me you sold the doll. You said
And Mike said that he hadn’t known William to date anyone at all. Yet, here William was dating John.
“You said you didn’t date.”
With his hands steepled, he pressed them to his brow.
John froze. He knew they’d find out at some point, that word would spread. He’d talked it over with Ella multiple times. With one hand in his hair and the other on his hip, he glanced back at Ned. “They say that, huh?”
John stewed in the lounge, wondering if the tightness in his chest was a symptom of COVID-19 or just a symptom of his mental state. He’d been sitting there inhaling and exhaling, thinking of the path oxygen follows to sustain human life. Lungs are lobed - the right lung has three, and the left has two to make room for the heart. The lungs begin at the bottom of the trachea. Air moves through the mouth and nose to the back of the throat, down the trachea, and into bronchial tubes that lead into each lung. These tubes branch out into bronchioles, like the branches and twigs of a tree, stretching into the lung tissue, carrying the oxygen along. At the end of these tiny - some no thicker than a hair’s width - tubes are grape-like clusters called alveoli. There are some 30,000 alveoli in each lung.
“Sherlock, I swear to god, I’m taking all my things and moving back upstairs if you don’t make more room in that bloody closet and empty one more drawer!”
Of course. He shook Victor’s hand.
“Oh Jesus,” John panted as he collapsed onto the mattress. William giggled and reached for the tissue box by the bed.
Sherlock nods and leads John to the bed. “Sit,” he says.
“Sure. Yeah.”
“And you still texted me?”
Speaking of debt, he still owed Mike bail money. Mike Stamford and Molly Hooper had pooled their cash together to get John out of jail so he could live as normal a life as possible before his trial. Not that living a normal life was possible at that point—his residency was suspended, and showing his face in public was asking for suspicious stares and even outright confrontation. It had been as if he were a wolf walking among sheep, and the sheep knew.
Victor laughed again. “My word, Sherlock, I am glad to know that you have so many to mother you.” He looked back over at John -
“The two of you are so bloody clever, and here’s stupid John Watson, being taken in by the both of you. One who throws himself off a building and cons his best friend into thinking he was dead for two years, and the other a bloody assassin - and how did you not see that, Sherlock? Hm? You see everything don’t you?” He turned away from Sherlock as he balled his fists. Turning around to face him, he pointed a finger and said, “Just once, I would like to have a normal relationship in my life, hm? Not a best friend that will drop me for a case to go gallivanting across the world like a bloody secret agent. Not an assassin wife who shoots my best friend and then my best friend forcing me to forgive her when we all know that marriage was headed for a wreck anyway. And instead of it happening like a derailed train, it just happened in this - “ he brought his fists up to his temples as he squeezed his eyes shut “- slow decay.” Like a shrinking leaf pile in a forgotten corner of the yard. He dropped his hands to his sides as he opened his eyes. “Just once, I’d like something a little normal.”
Adrenaline pumps in his chest and his limbs even as he lets John guide him down to the mattress. “I’m not a child,” he says. In the dream, he’d been not much taller than the brunette doll with the bone-pale skin.
John swatted his shoulder as he barked a laugh. “God, I’m exhausted. But I should probably go to the bathroom and clean up.”
“And what are we doing? Just letting off steam together?” William tugged his hands away.
Sherlock’s face turned predatory as they moved from the sofa to the hallway. He shoved John against the wall and John let him. Sherlock caged him in and kissed him, wild and unleashed. John was so full of euphoria he barely noticed as Sherlock herded him up the stairs. When they reached his door, Sherlock threw it open and pushed John toward the bed.
John snorted. It was almost funny.
Not to mention that with COVID-19 on the rise, he balked at the idea of Sherlock out among the rabble, investigating.
“Yes.”
Sherlock bobs his chin. “I’ll be back soon.”
Sherlock’s face twisted. “Why yours?”
“We have.”
He leans forward and holds out his hand. John takes it, and Sherlock hopes John doesn’t notice the slight tremble of his fingers.
Sherlock hadn’t returned his text. Mary wasn’t exactly right. Sherlock would ignore John’s texts if he was mid-case or asleep, and he slept at odd hours. But an entire day had passed.
“Deplorably so? That’s an endorsement if I ever heard one.”
It’d been two years since the last letter.
Sherlock watches him. He lifts his hand for a taxi. One pulls to the kerb with a rubbery squeal.
And they were supposed to be best friends.
“John,” Sherlock tries to hold his voice steady as fragmented thoughts pummel against the walls of his Mind Palace. “John, you said…” His hands ball into fists.
“We’re painting!” she said. Like any precocious four year old, Rosie had many interests. Dress-up. Gardening with her little seed pots in the windows. Pretending to be a vet at her shelves of stuffed animals, complete with her own little doctor’s kit. Painting at her art table. Looking through her microscope and drawing diagrams in a little notebook that Uncle Sherlock gave her. No one could readily identify her drawings, but she took it very seriously. “I’m doing science, daddy,” she’d tell him in a no-nonsense voice as she donned a little white lab coat that swamped her small frame.
“I. Well, I have some questions to ask you. And I’m afraid to ask them because I think they might...stop this between us. I—” John inhaled. “I need a moment. Jesus. I just...I find it hard to talk sometimes.”
“Marines. I started using drugs. I was discharged.” He sipped his wine again, as if to shrug away the gravity of his pronouncement. “Have a splendid evening, John. I wish you all the best in your new position.” He turned to go.
The other guys chimed in:
John paused in his walk. “You’re serious?”
William’s eyes turned black, shining. “You’re a flirt when you’ve had a bit to drink.”
John makes some kind of strangled shout as he disentangles himself from Sherlock and begins to pace the room. “So, she killed him? Because he told her the doll told him to kill someone? That’s nuts, Sherlock!”
Sherlock slides his left arm beneath John’s armpit and snakes up it over his shoulder to grasp John’s nape with his hand - a half-nelson.
It was heaven to worship at this altar of this man, to hear his lust-addled groans of pleasure.
Ah, of course. Just to top this entire night off. William wasn’t even gay, and Molly was into him. She was single, intelligent, and attractive. No wonder she dressed to the nines; she was dressing to impress, wasn’t she?
“But I like your brand of ridiculous.”
“Mycroft’s emailed me the files.”
. “I am not a hoarder. I collect things of interest and value, and much of what you see was gifted to me for my services.”
“I’ve missed you too, Johnny.” She’d called him when he was young. It’d taken years to get her to call him John, but now, he’d give almost anything to have her call him by the sweet diminutive. Regularly. “I’m so sorry we didn’t invite you out here sooner.”
John sat in his desk chair and gripped the armrests until his knuckles were moon-white. “You can say that.”
“You do?”
“No. No. The tall and short of it is that she and I were both arrested, charged, and put on trial. The bitch—” He screwed his eyes shut and bit down on his tongue until pain flared, abrasive and hot. He sniffed. “The bitch told the cops I put her up to all the killings. That I was angry with her for losing our kid. That I was a sick freak who fucked men on the side. And man, did they buy it. They wanted to. No one could believe a woman would be capable of all that. Not too many female serial killers in history, y’know?
“You asked me to move the doll. So I did. I never said I’d sell her,” John says, as he shakes his head with a little smile. “Did you dream it, maybe? You’ve been having some strange dreams.”
“It’s only been four days,” she said.
“Yes.”
“Yes?”
“You’re actually a lazy person, aren’t you? Here I thought you were this motivated, bigshot international realtor go-getter, but the truth is you'd rather do as little as possible.”
Sherlock had answered.
John held out his hand. “William. You too.”
“So did he help you with the bite?” he asked in an effort to retrieve the spool.
He tapped his foot on the floor as he sat in the chair of his home office. A warm, honey-brown colour stained the cheap imitation wood of his desk. Nothing like the desk that he'd claimed while living at 221B. This was an ersatz office, just a place he went for some peace and quiet. The surgery was more conducive to paperwork. Here, he pretended to work at his laptop on administrative work, when really, he was likely writing blog posts or playing solitaire. A single green fern sat on his desk, along with medical textbooks and random bills and notes from Rosie’s nursery. Mary had managed to keep the fern alive, after taking over for him when he killed several of his other potted plants. She'd insisted on their existence "for a bit of colour."
Except he knows John left his phone on the desk in the lounge.
“Come off it!” William barked so suddenly that John jerked in surprise. “I may have...oddities, John. I—” His eyes stared off into the middle distance. “I know I have morbid interests compared to much of the populace. But if you use your brain at all, you’d see I am...unreasonably smitten with you.” William pressed his lips together in a thin line. “You hold a fire inside you, a fire in the belly that manifests itself as anger, but you...you’re a healer by nature. You like to take care of people, yet the circumstances of your life have stunted you. I see you for what you are—a person fiercely loyal to those around you, who would strive to make the world a better place. But you’ve been sabotaged by monsters and the absolute putrid dredges of society who dare to call themselves human.” William lowered his head. “I didn’t google you, John. I knew of Mary Watson, and I realized who you were that night at the party, right in that moment when I was deducing you.”
Shouts reached his ears. A thump sounded on the other side of the shelter entrance. John threw open the doors to see a knot of men slam into the opposite wall, cracking the new plaster with a resounding rip. Two men pinned a third, while a fourth barreled fists into the belly of the pinned man.
“I can’t believe -” his voice choked, the swelling of saturated earth thick in his throat again.
“He’s fit, innit he?”
“Sherlock, you aren’t taking me seriously. I’m going up to my room to think.”
“And if you ever solve me? Will you suddenly drop me to the side like some old toy?”
Tears heated his eyes. “Yeah.” He swallowed again. “I think I can see it from my mom’s point of view. She married a monster. I look like him, you know. And when I was charged, she couldn’t look at me. It scared her.
John ran his tongue over his teeth, as if he might find words hiding somewhere in the crevices. None were to be found, though his chest grew tight with feeling. Panic sent a cold sweat over the nape of his neck.
Yeah. He could see that.
“Yeah,” John says. He seems a little embarrassed, the way he shifts his stance and sucks in his cheeks.
