“Dammit.“ Nat sat down heavily on her seat in the quinjet and shook her wrist out. The thin blue lines of her Widow’s Bites flickered and died.
Steve didn’t move for a long time then he pushed up to his elbows and slid out of bed. “Sorry,” he muttered without looking Tony’s way. He pulled on a pair of sweatpants straight from the floor and ran his hand back through his hair.
“I put him to bed,” the man gasped, hands opening and closing pitifully at his sides. “I was up late working and - and I heard a noise so I went to his room. I - I think he was eating his halloween candy instead of sleeping. There were wrappers on his floor. But - but -”
“Seems cut and dry.” Tony picked up one of the cardboard sets and turned it upside down, sticking his head inside.
The only thing that didn't fit the smooth, unbroken lines of the space were small, black, glass domes dotting the room at regular intervals. They reminded Tony of security cameras, their smooth, dark surfaces too much like eyes, and he wondered if the thing was filming this. Or if there were more creatures, watching. But watching what?
The thin tendril circled the head of Tony's cock then pressed against his slit again, sinking in a scant few millimeters, but enough to make Tony gasp. The tentacles elsewhere slowed their endless torment of pleasure so all the sensation in his body dialed down until he was focused, laser-tight, on the thin tentacle that was working its way into his dick.
Tony stilled, on his way to the workshop door. “Bucky?” A new layer of adrenaline flushed over the first. He and Bucky hadn’t spent an inordinate amount of time together since he’d moved to the tower, but all the time they had spent in the same room had felt
Tony laughed. “I know. I’m just really grateful, that’s all. So if there’s anything I can do thank you…” He batted his eyelashes up at Steve, and Steve’s palms started sweating on the steering wheel.
“Alright.” But Tony sounded disappointed, and he didn’t seem able to summon a smile. Steve was disappointed too. He wanted to fall asleep in Tony’s arms, feel the rise and fall of his chest, his heartbeat. He liked the soft blue light of the arc reactor as it smoothed off the harsh shadow edges of the room. But if he couldn’t sleep there…
Steve jerked forward, but the alien just pulled him back again. And then a single tentacle curled around his face. Steve sucked in a breath, terrified that he would soon be choking on a tentacle of his own, unable to breathe, but instead, it covered his eyes, squeezing tightly until there was nothing but blackness to see.
"[Portuguese] I don't think I've ever felt this way about someone before, and he's not even alive. Everyone else in my class has a crush on another student, but I have a crush on a lost national icon."
Tony dropped a hand to his shoulder and squeezed lightly as he walked out, leaving the man and his kid in the capable hands of the ER nurses.
Tony let out a long, slow sigh then leaned forward until his forehead hit Steve’s chest. “I can still feel it. I can feel him in my head, whispering in my ear.”
This one is for Ironlawyer, who prompted the Rush Hour Crush ad in the MCU chat and caught me. Thanks! I hope you like it <33333
Steve is playing Azorius and Tony is playing Izzit. You cannot convince Tony didn't play MTG in his early twenties at MIT! And super strategic Steve would be killer at it.
He was just sinking into a nice sort of ice cream haze when a soft thump drew his attention away from his rocky road and through the open kitchen door. From his line of sight, he could catch the stairs doors as they swooshed open.
Greg laughed lightly while Steve scanned the crowd for a particular head of dark hair, and he let out a soft, involuntary sigh when he found it.
Tony’s arms had come up to wrap around Bucky’s back, tugging him down until they were pressed tightly together. They were both a mess of wet clothes and snow, but neither seemed to care, completely absorbed as they were in a rapidly heating makeout session.
Tony panted around the gag that stretched his lips wide and rolled his wrists in the restraints that locked behind his back. Steve’s big, hot hand stroked up the length of Tony’s cock again, and he moaned, spit dribbling freely down his chin.
Steve watched quietly while Tony sat with Thor and walked him through the steps to alter his laptop settings. A few minutes later, Jane’s voice rang out through the speakers, and Thor cheered with pleasure. They immediately fell into conversation.
Tony dipped his face down into Steve’s chest. There was one thing he wanted to say - had to say - but he wasn’t quite ready for Steve to hear it yet. Maybe soon, but for now…
“I know you can, sweetheart,” Steve said, “but you’ve been poking around in there for half an hour and you don’t have to. Because you’re very rich and influential. And even if -”
Subject TS-616 exhibits heightened arousal with presence of additional subject (SR-616). Production of oxytocin and vasopressin have increased as well (see chart IK-3984). Note: both subjects were collected from the same location. Chemical makeup suggests the possibility of a pair bond present already, or in progress. This would skew results.
They stopped when Tony’s phone started blasting its obnoxious, eighties rock ringtone, startling all of them. “Hello?”
At first, he just read the bios and laughed at the pics then swiped left, but as boredom set in, he swiped right on a few, hoping for at least some conversation to help pass the time.
Steve stiffened. “Do you - do you not want to get married? Your parents said you agreed, but if you’re being forced to -”
Steve flickered through several emotions in rapid succession, relief, pain, anger, sadness. He settled on pain. Tony wondered if he would always settle on pain, if given the choice.
JARVIS's subroutines informed him that it was time, once again, to run a complete self-diagnostic. He activated the necessary processes and redirected resources from unnecessary tasks to ensure the self-diagnostic was efficient and complete.
“I think you need to beat the eggs before you add them.” Steve frowned at the back of the box. “It doesn’t say.”
The man seemed too good for a place like The Dollhouse, but Steve supposed if he was there, he wasn't that good at all. As Steve stepped by, the man looked up and their eyes locked for a brief second before he glanced away again.
But when Bucky came out of shower to check on Tony, clean and fresh and beautiful and wearing nothing but a towel… Well, Tony found it in himself to forgive his overinvolved AI.
In the morning, Tony was bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, and so grateful to find Steve in his bed that Steve forgave him for the hard night that wasn’t really his fault.
Tony reached out and tugged Steve’s collar between his fingers. “I forgive you,” he said quietly, and Steve tipped forward and folded him in his arms.
Steve was lured back into kissing him, and the longer he had Tony in his arms, the harder the thought of leaving him here and going up to his own lonely bed was. “I’ll stay.”
Tony grinned, eyes twinkling. “Will you go to prom with me?” Tony took a step back and held his hand out.
Steve twisted his hands together, looking like the nervous kid in the elevator all over again. “I… struggle a bit, sometimes, in the future,” he admitted quietly. “Growing up I had Bucky, and then in the army, the Commandos. We were all really close, touchy. We’d collapse in a big pile at the end of the day and take comfort in one another. You could hug and kiss your friends more easily back then, or maybe I just found it easier to be close friends with people. But I don’t really get touched since I was thawed.”
Tony pushed back to his feet, ignoring the way his legs shook, and lifted his hands again, squaring up to fight.
Tony typed for a moment then turned his laptop around to show Bucky his email. The inbox was flooded with several emails marked urgent, and Bucky's first glance showed several names he recognized. Tony opened one that he'd starred. There was an attached video. "Turns out your meeting wasn't muted after all. Well, your speakers were. Your microphone wasn't." He opened the video and it started to play.
“We do… Happy Garden had the best rice and egg rolls, Ray’s had the best noodles, and Double Dragon had the best stir fry.”
“That’s fine.” Nat sighed then rolled onto her back and stretched. “I think I just want to go to sleep after all. You know how sometimes it all catches up with you at once?”
There’ve been a few, of course - like realizing that he’d woken up in a new century - and many small ones - the realization that his muscle memory for where most light switches would be was suddenly several inches off - but nothing quite like this one.
Tony let out a breath then wriggled backwards towards the centre of the bed, drawing Steve back with him. He stretched out wide then wrapped himself around Steve, arms and legs, stretching up for another kiss, bare skin pressed tantalizingly close.
“Why did you dodge me for three days then? Just to delay the inevitable? Drag this out? For fucks sake, Steve. This has been torturing me.”
“So you said you’re heading somewhere interesting?” Steve asked, when he couldn’t take the silence anymore. “Where do you want me to drop you off?”
But Steve could see he wasn’t really awake yet, blinking too long and too slow, and sucking steadily at the binky. Steve closed the curtain again and tucked Anthony against his chest, slipping out of the room. He was debating taking him to the couch and reading for a while, letting Anthony wake up on his own schedule before facing breakfast when a soft, “Steve…” wafted out of the master bedroom.
Tony leaned back against the door frame and waited for a few minutes, but even though he couldn’t hear, it still gave him the intense feeling of eavesdropping, and that was too uncomfortable. He climbed back into bed and pulled out his tablet again.
Tony barked out a laugh. “There he is.” He brushed his fingertips along the edge of Steve’s hairline. “Let’s make some new memories, huh? Ones for both of us to keep?”
Yumi_Eleven and willidothefandango teamed up to add this awesome prompt to the MCU discord prompt feed (no doubt inspired by RDJ's recent umbrella post), and I needed a ficlet to flex my creative muscles, so I wrote it up for them! Thanks for the prompt <3 I'm not really sure when this is set, I think it works in a couple different ways, so go with whatever you want!
Tony was warm and close and smiling like Steve had just made his day instead of the other way around. “I could make you one,” Tony said, eyes twinkling. “All red, white and blue. Put some glitter on it. Little wings on the helmet.”
And it was fast, Tony knew that, but curled up on Steve’s couch in the dim light of the TV, wound around each other, Steve’s nose buried in his hair, it was so easy to let those three words slip out. He’d never expected Steve to say them back, but he had. Tony had spent the night. He’d never been so happy.
Steve snorted then turned it into a cough, covering his mouth with his other hand. "God, Tony. I mean… me too," Steve added quietly.
"Okay, okay. Thank you." Tony let his eyes fall shut as the sensations covering every inch of his skin became too much to ignore again. "This isn't going to ruin our friendship, is it?" Tony managed with a choking laugh.
“I was coming to find you,” Tony explained sheepishly. “Bed’s awfully big and empty without you. Even if I do have my blankets back.”
Steve danced out of the way, icing bag clutched in his fist, laughing. He made it as far as the living room when Bucky tackled him to the ground. Steve spun in his hold and squeezed the bag, squirting a line of blue icing down the length of Bucky’s nose.
Bucky sighed. "Yeah. Just embarrassed. In some ways, having people know will be easier, but my students are never going to let me live this down."
Steve came fully in the room and shut the door softly behind him. He raked his eyes over Tony and his smile deepened. Tony hoped that meant he liked what he saw. “Oh!” Steve took two hesitant steps across the room and held out a plastic case with a vivid red flower in it. Steve had a matching flower pinned to his chest, next to the somewhat overwhelming array of medals he wore. “This is for you.”
“What? No!” Tony dumped the box in Bucky’s arms and shoved Steve away. He frowned down at the cake which Steve was pretty sure looked better as a smear at the bottom of the trash can than it had assembled. “I wanted to eat your cake.”
He let his eyes slip shut. He was going to wait for Steve to come back to bed, so they could fall asleep together. No matter what, they’d wake up that way, wrapped around each other like a pair of love-struck octopuses, blinking awake to soft morning light and the gurgling of the automatic coffeemaker turning on. But Tony would wait for him…
"Free hugs, huh?" The kid adjusted one of his many bags. He looked equal parts exhausted and incredulous.
Steve takes two steps towards Tony, because now that he’s filled up with this revelation from head to foot, he wants to bask in it. This love is warm and soft and washes over him in waves, like a calm evening ocean lapping at the shore. It’s steadying and right and powerful and,
“Oh no you don’t.” Bucky stood between Tony and the fridge. He lifted the edge of the box then nodded over it at Steve. “It’s perfect.”
Who was he kidding? It’d be extremely creepy to barge into the store and start hitting on one of the employees - it’d have to be the latter.
Bucky shook his head, but let himself be taken away. All in all, it was nice to be out. He wanted the world to know that the two best men in the world belonged to him, wanted to scream from the rooftops how much he loved them both, how grateful he was that they loved him, loved each other, albeit in a different way. It was perfect and beautiful and deserved to be celebrated.
Tony thought about going to Steve’s room to talk to him. The longer they let this fester, the worse it was going to be, and he knew that it was his fault they hadn’t talked about it yet, but that didn’t stop him from hesitating.
“You did,” Bucky said sharply. “Two of them.” His voice softened. “Tony, please don’t go. What’s really wrong?”
Tony eyed the envelope. “What could this be?” He lifted it, turning it over in his hands. It was a bit suspicious, rather unusual, to have something sent to the tower in that manner, but Tony didn’t find any reason to fear. He tore the envelope open and inside was a ticket, decorated with swirls of red and gold, for the opera,
But Steve was still looking at him sadly. He reached out and wound his fingers through Tony’s, tugging him closer. “I don’t think you do…” Steve fitted their bodies lightly together and brushed his lips against Tony’s. “I really, really want it to be a date. There’s no one else on this planet I want to go on a date with more than you. Not even Tabitha Fortis.”
“Alright.” Steve made sure the sleeping bag was tugged tight around their necks. “Are you warming up?”
Saliva: Water. electrolytes, mucopolysaccharides, glycoproteins, thiocyanate, hydrogen peroxide, and secretory immunoglobulin, enzymes, various human cells (note: run DNA analysis), opiorphin (possible uses?), haptocorrin. Trace amounts of an unknown compound. File for further study.
“Start at the beginning.” Tony was starting to feel like the conversation was about to take a sharp left turn off a cliff and he wasn’t looking forward to it.
Steve took three steps towards the bathroom then stopped. He’d been kicked out of his own room. It was as good an excuse as any to knock on Tony’s door. He took one more step then screeched to a halt. The door at the end of the hall was opening.
The sound of a string quartet warming up broke the soft, small bubble that had wrapped around them. “I think they’re ready for us,” Steve said. “But if there’s anything else you’re worried about, I’ll make them wait until you’re one hundred percent sure you want to go out there.”
They sunk down onto the blankets, and Tony stacked pillows up until he could lean back on them, then Steve sat down between his knees and settled himself back against Tony’s chest. Tony tugged the bags of takeout closer. “Okay, so I ordered the same thing from three different places so we could compare and contrast.”
Steve stretched out as far as he could without tipping the ladder, his stomach dropping a bit as his centre of gravity shifted dangerously far out. He scratched his pencil along the wall, tracing the edge of the projection. He could almost reach the far corner…
Tony bristled. He wanted the fight now. He wanted to scream and rage and curse Steve for breaking his armour and breaking his heart and breaking up the fucking team. And for being broken - too broken to hold Tony up when his foundation rattled, too broken to fill in the cracks, too broken to fix this. Steve was supposed to fix him, that was how this worked.
A soft knock on the door startled Tony’s back ramrod straight, and he shoved the case back in his pocket, breath evaporating out of his lungs. A moment later, when he hadn’t managed to say anything, the door creaked open and a face peered around it. “Hi?” the man said.
Tony leaned back against the mirrored wall of the hotel, pressing his flushed forehead to the cool glass. He already had his jacket off, and his shirt was three buttons down, but it wasn’t helping banish the heat that crackled under his skin.
“Thank you so much.” Steve blushed and all but batted his eyelashes. Tony took a long blink to cover up his eye roll.
Tony leaned one elbow on the table and rested his chin on it, turned completely sideways in his chair to face Steve. “Only one way to make someday, sooner, you know.”
He didn’t want to wake Steve, and he didn’t know his apartment well enough to know where he might find another blanket, so Tony curled up under his sad little corner and tried to sleep.
Tony pulled out Rowdy’s leash, eventually caught the bouncing mutt and slid open the back door, disappearing into the dark. Steve added “Call fence guy” and “replace back lightbulb” to his lengthy mental list. He tidied up the containers, dropping some beef and broccoli into Rowdy’s bowl to surprise him when he got back. It took some digging to find pajamas, but there were soft pants and a t-shirt of Tony’s in one of the clothes boxes. He washed his face and brushed his teeth, using a washcloth and the tiny toothpaste from Tony’s workbag. It kind of felt like camping.
Steve remembered what it felt like to die; maybe it wouldn’t be the same for Tony. Maybe he had so much ice in his veins already that he wouldn’t be able to feel this, too deep into unconsciousness to register anything happening on the physical plane. That was probably all for the best.
“Yeah…” Tony tugged at his own pants, which Steve could feel were rapidly becoming a problem. “Lots of time for practice.”
Three months later, Tony and Steve had soundly beaten Natasha and Clint at euchre and Steve had grinned across the table at Tony. “How are you liking me now?”
“Hey! No backing out now.” Tony pulled out a small card table and settled on one side, arm up, hand open.
Steve grinned down at him, then leaned back, tucking his pencil behind his ear. “But I knew you were here to catch me.”
Tony loved this moment. Steve was like a weighted blanket over him, huge and warm and heavy. He managed to wrap himself around Tony, gathering him together, until Tony felt like there wasn’t an inch of him that didn’t belong completely to Steve. The first press of Steve’s cock against his hole felt like coming home, even though he’d been the one waiting here for Steve to return.
Steve and Tony were reading quietly in the library when Bruce shoved through the door, his own personal storm cloud following him.
“We know.” Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist and kissed the tip of his nose. “But it would have just been for our egos. No one was going to enjoy that cake, promise. This is much better.”
Tony didn’t want to watch, he didn’t want that image seared in his brain, but he couldn’t look away as Steve drew the man into a hug and pressed their lips together. A monster even larger and greener than the Hulk reared up in Tony’s chest. It wanted to charge out that door and rip the guy off Steve, punch him right back into the elevator to be dragged down and dispensed into the lobby, never to return.
He walked up the winding path that cut through overgrown grasses and hedges to the front door. The paint was faded, and the whole windmill had the distinct impression of it not having been touched in many years. Nevertheless, he needed help. He knocked on the door.
dinner. Not a date. Just dinner. With Steve. Because somehow he'd asked Steve to dinner, and Steve had said yes.
Steve traced a finger along the edge of Tony’s jaw, reactivating the burn of last night’s bite. “Memorizing you.”
Every time Steve spoke, Hill or Fury or Rumblow would interrupt, and Tony had given up on trying to interject on his behalf, besides, this meeting had gone on way past Tony’s expertise and solidly into military strategy. He wished, not for the first time, that Rhodey were here.
“It’s raining,” Natasha protested, but she let Tony draw her out on the patio. It was raining, but it was light and warm, the fresh, soft rain of spring.
“We need to talk,” Tony said, walking into the room with the pained, false-confident stride of a doomed man on his way to the guillotine. He was dreading this, but it had to be done.
"I'll be fine. It's a mystical poison, not a cold." But Steve leaned in, breathing in the steam from the soup.
“Night.” She disappeared back into her room, and Steve slipped into the bathroom. He drank down two full glasses of cool water then splashed more on his face. This entire night was such a mess. All he wanted was to talk to Tony, to work this out, to make sure they were still okay. And all the world seemed to want was to keep them apart.
A few hundred miles later, Tony had finished stripping off most of his layers, down to just jeans and his soft-looking sweater. He had held his hands in front of the vent for a few minutes, rubbing them together and bouncing slightly, but once the angry red chill had faded from his skin, he snuggled down in his seat, one foot up on the curve of the door, and stared out the window.
The air in the bar was too heavy again, laden with layers of thick scents that Steve could no longer separate into individual sources but were all combining to choke him out. He didn't want to be here anymore, marinating in sin and indulgence.
Steve walked into the kitchen, and Tony started chewing madly, trying to get his huge mouthful of peanut butter toast down his throat before Steve left again. Steve wandered around, pouring juice and selecting a yogurt from the fridge while Tony swallowed desperately, adding a layer off coffee in the hopes it would wash it down. All it did was make a truly disturbing flavour combination. Steve rounded the counter and pressed a kiss to the top of Tony’s head.
In the end, the boy had to grab the dog’s collar and drag her back while she whined and lunged for Tony and Steve. He scolded her gently, and she stopped pulling, trailing along at his heel as he walked away, though she kept shooting looks back at them. Steve hadn’t known that dogs were capable of pouting.
Steve finished tucking in his laces and stood. He rummaged around on the coffee table and came up with a blue-covered book that Tony remembered Bucky reading lately. “Here you go, babe,” Steve said, handing the book to Bucky. He traded it to Bucky for a kiss, then took one for free from Tony. “I’ll see you guys soon.”
He reached the hospital and bolted through the front doors, letting his uniform speak for itself when the shocked security guard flinched in his direction. Tony’s room was on the third floor. He slowed as he pushed through the stairwell door out into Tony’s hallway. It was quiet. His feet didn’t seem to want to carry him any farther but he pushed them on, kept going until -
Tony tipped forward until his forehead hit the mattress. Steve reached out, wanting to feel his hair, know he was real, but right when he made contact, Tony shifted up again, and Steve found himself cupping his cheek.
Steve could save… a different part of him. It was a lie to think that cursing him with living death was the same as saving his life. It was a lie to think that reversing the effects of the frostbite were worth what Tony would lose.
"I didn't think it was really you," Steve explained again, holding up his phone. "I thought it was a fake profile."
“My angel…” Steve’s eyes flicker over Tony’s face like he’s re-memorizing what he looks like, and Tony can feel heat flush up into his own cheeks, hopefully hidden by dirt and blood. Steve takes a deep breath, lets it out. “Tony?”
Steve’s expression softened, something far away and a little sad filling his eyes. “I think a lot is exactly what I need. I’m not always easy to live with either, Tony. But I really want to make this work. It means a lot to me that you agreed to this.”
Tony burst out laughing, his fingers tightening on Steve’s sleeve, and Steve’s fingers curled closer around them. “Okay. Yeah, okay, that sounds really good.”
“Whoa!” Two strong arms caught his hips and settled him back on the creaking ladder. “Move the ladder, Steve. Please don’t christen our brand new house, only seven hours in, with a gaping head wound.”
Their hands were still wound together, but more like an embrace than a challenge. The back of Steve’s hand was pressed to the table, Tony’s lying placidly on top.
Steve pinned Tony with a penetrating stare, but the other man didn’t waver. “Alright… but the money goes to charity. And the loser cooks dinner for the winner.”
“Captain Rogers,” Greg replied, as if Steve’s appearance at his own table was a surprise. “How are you enjoying yourself?”
JARVIS had no cameras in the stalls, but if Tony yelled loud enough, he'd hear him. "JA-" The tentacle snapped across the small space and latched itself over Tony's mouth, cutting off the rest of his shout into a muffled scream.
Steve gave Tony a look. "We've been commanded. Hold on, I'll grab a book. Maybe we can transition this right into bedtime." Steve checked the shelf, but it was too dark to tell what most of the titles were, so Steve grabbed one of the few he could recognize by touch and headed back for the fort. It was a tight fit - two grown men shoved up under the low blanket. Steve's head acted as a centre pole, peaking the middle of the sheet. Anthony clicked on Glow Duck, still working on the last of his goldfish, and Steve opened the book.
Steve covered Tony’s hand with his own where it still rested on his sleeve. “I already like you, Tony. A lot.”
“Yeah.” Steve forced himself to smile. “Those guys are assholes. I don’t know why you keep going to that club when they treat you like they do. I’ll do pretty much anything to show them up.”
He’d always talked in his sleep, but it rarely bothered people, especially since he didn’t usually start until several hours into the night and his bed partners were deeply asleep enough by then that they didn’t notice. But it seemed Steve’s super-hearing had a downside, and this was it.
Tony tried to focus on relaxing his muscles so Steve could work him open faster. The sooner Steve was satisfied that Tony was ready, the sooner he’d be inside him. And either Steve was as eager as he was, or it worked, because only a few minutes later, Steve pulled back, licking his lips in a way that was far too obscene for a national icon, and crawled forward until he was covering Tony over again. He kept working his fingers inside him, adding a third briefly, then pulled away and worked his fly open, propping himself up on one elbow.
“I’ll marry you,” Tony replied tartly. “I’ll marry you the very second you agree that the perfect song for our first dance is Star Spangled Man with A Plan.”
Tony let out a tense breath. “Okay, perfect.” Tony pushed Steve flat on his back and twisted around so he was half on top of Steve, Steve still half in his lap. “Plenty of time to enjoy my last few hours as a spring chicken, yeah?”
"Ah, right. I just remembered. I said I'd help Darce run lines for the hair salon scene tonight. So… maybe another night."
“Yes, yes. It’s me, Steve. Oh, baby, I was so worried. I’m so sorry. I’m so, so sorry.” Captain America - who was apparently not Captain America but Steve - pulled Tony into his lap and pressed a kiss to his temple.
Hot Window Guy smiled. “So… you’re here every night. I can only assume you were waiting for something in particular to go on sale. Can I help you find something?”
Tony hummed. He bent and kissed his way along Steve’s jaw. “Okay, maybe not better, but I’ll take any opportunity to spend sixteen hours with you.”
"I'm no stranger to the small version of you. I'd seen pictures before we even met, and I've seen you like this several times." Tony's fingers brushed gently across Steve's cheek. "I love you. All ways. You have a tendency to pull back when you're like this, and that's fine, I respect your need for space, but please don't do it on my account."
There were butts that inspired even the least creative in the world to suddenly spout sonnets, and this butt was one of them. It was full but firm, perfectly curvy, not too in your face, but obviously formed with great care, time, and a lot of squats.
"So, uh. I came to ask you if you could help me figure this thing out." Steve held up the tablet with a sheepish grin. "Maybe we could grab dinner and you could tell me all about the years I skipped?"
“What? No.” And Steve was such a horrific liar that Tony had to believe him. “I was just wondering, because you seem like the sort of person to have one, and uh -” now he was blushing a little “- I kind of wanted to get you coffee and I didn’t know if you needed to -”
“Do you know what would be amazing?” Steve said, stretching his arm across Tony’s stomach to hook Bucky’s hip.
This is a recording of a live fic reading I did on the PotS server. Thank you to everyone who joined for listening! This is an unedited live read, so apologies for any stumbles or sounds of ratties ticking their water bottle in the background! :D
Steve didn’t relent, slamming into Tony over and over, knocking Tony’s hand up and over the head of his cock with every thrust.
But first he shuffled out of his pants. Then he swapped his shirt for one of Steve’s huge SHIELD hoodies - pilfered from the hamper so it’d smell like him. He managed that way on the couch for a long time, but then, when his back complained, he crawled into bed with his laptop.
He bit back a curse and marched down the hall. This was it. He was done messing around. He knocked on the door, no longer caring if he woke Nat. But it was Bruce who answered the door. He looked past him into the bedroom and saw Nat sitting on a bench in the corner and no sign of Steve.
“I -” Steve starts, then he clears his throat - adorably similar to the way his younger version had less than an hour ago. “I used to daydream about the man in the alley. I think - Sometimes I thought he was my guardian angel or something. The way he just magically disappeared, knew who I was - kinda makes sense, right? Also made sense that my angel would be dumb enough to get into a brawl in an alleyway five minutes after arriving on earth.” He chuckled nervously. “I liked to think that you had come to check up on me. Sometimes I prayed to you. Wow. Seems so dumb now. It was you…”
“You should probably head back, Cap,” Tony said. “I’ve learned the hard way that when you’re first getting used to it, it feels great while you’re in it, but there’s a bit of a hangover if you go too long.”
Steve brightened immediately, his warm smile cutting deep. He led the way to the gym and traded his shield for the lighter, gentler training version. “Ready?”
“I guess not.” Even though warm sunlight pooled on the sheets and Steve’s skin was hot to the touch, Tony was still shivering.
But there would be strong arms waiting for him, at arrivals, strong, open, grasping arms that would tug him in close, suffocate him in affection. Lips that would burrow into his hair, find his forehead and kiss it, over and over. There would be a hand in his, all through the drive home, and, for the first time in five weeks, a chest under his cheek as he fell asleep that night.
Tony looked clearer too, more lucid than Steve had seen him yet, and he offered Steve a small smile. "Hey," he croaked.
Steve squeezed his shoulder once then moved to back off, but Tony’s hand darted up and caught his wrist. His eyes opened. “Thank you.” He reeled Steve in and pressed a soft kiss to his cheek.
"Mmmf!" Tony struggled uselessly, his strength nothing against one of the tentacles, let alone the whole creature. It bound him tighter and tighter, wrapping them into a ball of slick, rubbery mass, covering every inch of Tony's skin. Oh god, it was going to kill him, eat him,
Tony shrugged. “Whatever. I’m having a great time travelling, so it’s all for the best.” His eyes slid over towards Steve again, darkening, and Steve felt his cheeks heating.
“Best birthday ever. All I ever wanted was you two.” He leaned back against Bucky’s chest and Steve leaned down to kiss him silly. Bucky buried his face in Steve’s hair and everything was warm and perfect and
Steve hummed and plucked at the fabric, slipping his fingers under the hem to splay over Tony’s stomach. Shit, he was still wearing the gloves.
“Good boys. Okay. Get to the hospital, give that saint of a girl a super-powered hand to hold on to.” Nat clapped them both on the shoulder. “You’re about to be parents!”
Bucky’s window opened automatically, and Tony cut through, corkscrewing through the air to slam to his feet in the middle of the open plan apartment.
Tony stared at Steve a moment longer then suddenly staggered to the side and sat down hard on the edge of the desk, his hand coming up to scrub over his face.
Their room was cold - they still hadn’t unpacked the heavy blankets. Every night when they got ready for bed, one of them would mention it. The nights were getting longer, the days shorter, and Anthony was outgrowing his sleepers at an astonishing rate. But even though they both knew they’d be chilled in the morning, under nothing but cotton sheets and a light duvet, neither Steve nor Tony seemed able to face hauling the bags and boxes out of the spare room to try and find the big comforter.
A soft footstep startled Steve up from his musings. He spun around and found Tony standing there, his cape balled up in his arms and both shoes missing. His bare feet were wet and covered with grass, his buttons half undone and his hair wild. He was breathing hard like he’d been running, but it was still long before his expected return at midnight.
It made sense, in a sick sort of way. If Steve went soft, he wouldn’t be able to choke Tony and an orgasm was the best way to make that happen. Then any pain would be Steve’s - the sharp shocks of overstimulation - and Steve would vastly prefer that.
Steve opened his arms, and Tony flowed into them, sprawling out across his chest. He chuckled. “You’re so tactile.” He bent and ruffled his nose through Tony’s hair.
A sudden brainwave had him digging around behind a stack of boxes, feet tipping up off the floor as he folded himself over the pile. He heard the sliding door slip open and shut and then a hand landed on his ass where it was sticking up.
Steve searched the apartment, but it seemed Tony wasn’t here. Then he saw the light spilling out of the bedroom door. “Tony?” he tried again, pushing the door open. And there was Tony, laid out on his bed. He was unnaturally still, not curled in a ball like Tony normally slept, but sprawled out on his back, arms folded over his stomach. “Tony!”
Tony slammed backwards into the wall, and even through the Iron Man armour, pain reverberated through his body. He was running out of tricks. The receptionist’s guns had been decommissioned by Deathlok’s power. Tryp and Madrox were long gone. As was so often the case, it was just the two of them left.
in the MCU discord prompts channel and I've been feeling a bit word blocked so I decided to spill it out just to make something happen! Thanks to everyone on the server who explained how Tinder works, gave me ideas, and told me I couldn't do it so I'd have to. *muah*
Chapters 73-96, were written for the Steve Tony Games, and I was on Team Angst. Some of these have happy endings, some do not. They're mostly darker than what I normally write. I will put tags in the notes here on each one, but do be aware that angst was the primary motivation for these (and points :P) so they taste a little different from what I usually put up.
Steve had really been hoping this would be the former; he was looking forward to dinner with Tony. They went to lunch a lot, but there was something cozy, and off-the-clock, and
Tony looked up from where he’d been contemplating ways to drink coffee without opening the suit. “What’s up, Cap?”
“Wow… Tony.” Steve stepped forward, catching Tony around his waist. He nodded, heart burning with so much love it might crack. “It’s worth it, for you.” He ducked down and caught Tony in a passionate kiss, pouring in everything he’d been holding back over the last month. When they parted, Steve caught his wand between his hands. “I love you too,” he said, and he snapped it in half. Tony’s fancy clothes blew away in the wind, leaving his old rags behind and taking Steve’s wings with them.
Steve rolled his eyes in the way only a disgruntled Captain America could. "I told you my vacuum was just fine, Tony. How many things has that damn robot ruined now?"
Both of Steve’s hands were occupied, one braced next to Tony’s hip to keep him from crushing him, the other gripping Tony’s folded leg hard enough to bruise, so Tony shoved his own hand down between their bodies and started jacking himself off roughly in the short, sharp strokes he could manage in the small amount of space.
A new wave of pleasure surged up and peaked, holding, and Tony kicked his hips back and forth harder, chasing it. It didn’t break, building and building this time. “Oh fuck, Steve, yes, god, I’m going to come, please, please
It chimed, and opened, and Tony led Steve down a hallway, muttering, "Just through here." They stepped into an empty office that clearly wasn't Tony's, didn't look like anyone's. Just extra space. Tony closed and locked the door behind them.
“Wait, Tony. Please.” Steve released him when Tony stopped and turned back towards him. “Did you - I mean - Did you mean it when you said you’d go out with me?”
Steve protested, desperate to go but not wanting to ruin Tony’s evening, until Tony picked up his phone and called to order another ticket. To their delight, they were able to get the seat beside Tony’s so they could sit together and watch the show. It was sure to be a wonderful evening.
And it should have sounded cheesy or silly, but Steve was so beautifully earnest that all Tony could feel when that warm, soft praise slipped from his mouth was deeply, perfectly loved, in a way he never had before. It was almost too much.
With the throbbing pain abating, Steve was able to take in his surroundings. Two hundred years… that was what Strucker had set the chamber for, and no one was here to have let him out so it must - it must -
"Ha ha," Tony said, trying to laugh instead of just shoving the sound of his throat. "Great. Good. So that's out on the table."
Tony and Bucky’s relationship hadn’t been simple or straightforward, but after all living together at the compound for the past three years, Steve had seen a shift. Antagonism turned to begrudging acceptance, turned to friendly affection, and finally, now… well, Steve had his suspicions.
Steve struggled his way through the pushed back chairs to the Ultimates’ table, in need of a break from all the people, but when he got there, Tony’s seat next to his was occupied, and not by Tony.
Steve shuffled, his cheeks so brightly pink that they glowed in the soft lights from the sprawling buildings beneath them. “My present, for you. It’s stupid, so I didn’t want to do it in front of everyone.”
Steve swallowed heavily and focused on the road, worried that if he let any more of his brain think about Tony’s tongue stroking along the underside of his cock he’d come right then and there. Steve glanced over to where Tony was twisted on the seat and saw the bulge in his pants that said it wasn’t just Steve who was enjoying this. Tony moaned, the vibration making Steve gasp and kick his hips up, and Steve couldn’t resist dropping a hand to Tony’s hair.
“Good evening, gentlemen!” Tony tries, grinning broadly. He lowers his hands back over his dignity. “Nice night for a stroll.”
“I have spares.” But Tony must have seen something in Steve’s face because he nodded and kissed him on the end of his nose before rolling off. “Meet you back here.”
Steve kept moving, but it was slow going. He was still weak from his fight with the HYDRA goons, the serum having enough to fight against that it was slow going, and he was tired to his bones, heavy from grief and fear.
It was all Steve could do not to burst into tears. He stood there for a long time, staring at the candy, fighting back the way his stomach was trying to crawl up his throat and choke him. He couldn’t do this. Clutching the chocolate, he turned on his heel and made for the stairs.
The voices continued for a moment, then fell silent. Footsteps padded down the hall, and the Bartons’ bedroom door opened and closed. Tony took a steadying breath and darted outside.
“I never thought I would,” Tony said. “Find you, that is. Wow.” He stood and Steve did too, stumbling forward a step. “And you’ve got a kid and - wow.”
Tony swallowed heavily. “There’s a screw right there,” he finally said. He pointed then held out a tiny screwdriver.
“I can’t hear you!” Thor yelled at his laptop screen, startling Steve out of his heavy doze on the couch. Thor sat at the table in the corner, scowling at the StarkTech laptop Tony had given him.
It was a slightly different Steve every time, after that, but Tony still always knew it was Steve. Sometimes, he could sense their teammates in the background, but it was always Steve that touched him, whispered sweet praise in his ear, promised him that he’d be okay. It was always Steve that drew pleasure from his broken body. It was Steve who told him it was okay to let go, that he’d catch him. That he didn’t have to shiver anymore.
"I… I can't. I can't seem to access the comm lines at all. My contact to the outside world has been completely severed."
Tony reached out and snagged Steve’s belt then dragged him backwards out of the stinger zone. “Don’t be stupid. This is amazing. Of course I don’t mind. And, no, I’m not allergic, but I’d still prefer not to get stung. Shouldn’t you have one of those mesh hats?” Tony tapped Steve’s bare forehead then dipped in to steal a kiss before he could answer.
Tony waited until Steve shuffled up to his side then led him into the kitchen. “I ordered breakfast,” he tried again.
“We came to get you.” Steve sounded almost desperate now. “You’re okay. You did such a good job, fighting them. You’re okay, now.”
And that's the end of my SteveTony Games fics! Thanks for playing along :D Back to your regularly scheduled uhhh whatever it is I normally do! (^_^)
And of course, in the dark, all alone, all Tony could think about was Steve. Their argument earlier. The way Steve had looked at him. And how was it that he’d come out of this unscathed? It was a little scary maybe, but mostly upsetting. Steve, the strongest of them, had been whammied by the witch, and all of his anger was only directed at Tony and at Ultron. Maybe the witch hadn’t even shown him anything.
"Oh!" Tony stood up. "We have just the thing. Here." He held Ant out to Steve, who took him and tucked him into the crook of his arm. They walked back into the living room together and Steve found a turtle binky and Ant's new stuffed skunk toy and settled on the couch.
When the bad man arrived at the tower, he found the door locked. That wouldn’t do at all. He used his robot to pick the lock and bypass the AI that didn’t want to let him in. It just didn’t understand that this was about true love! The bad man wouldn’t let anything stand in his way.
Now Tony could never go back to the market where they’d met, didn’t know how he could ever hold someone’s hand again without feeling the dull pain of

Tony shrugged. "Nah. It's - I'm doing three degrees at once," he said with sigh, as if he was tired of explaining it. "There's no time off."
Steve shrugs. “It was so long ago, and you were dirty and covered in blood and bruises -” he reaches out and wipes his sleeve over Tony’s cheek. It comes back stained dark. “It just never occurred to me to make that connection. Over time, I’d blurred my memory of your face.”
He’d just check. If Tony was asleep, he’d go to sleep too and maybe tomorrow they could start fresh.
“Sorry to bother you, but would you mind if my, um, nephew met your dog? If she’s friendly.” He put careful emphasis on “nephew” that made it clear that there weren’t to be any questions raised on that topic.
They were just settling down to a meeting when an ear-splitting hissing noise broke through the calm quiet. Clint leapt to his feet. “No, no, no!” He ran into the kitchen and the others got up to follow him.
All the lights were off except for a small desk lamp, and that included - terrifyingly - the blue of the arc reactor. Tony was wearing one of his tank tops with a circular hole cut in the middle and he was leaning over his desk, a thick wire travelling from the reactor - which was in pieces in front of him - into the empty hole in his chest.
If Tony's eyes wandered down over the curve of Steve's backside in the suit, it was just because it was his responsibility to improve the suit to protect that backside, and not for any deeper, hornier reason. Not that Steve didn't have a perfect backside. He did, obviously. He was Captain America. But they were friends, and it'd be weird to think about or stare at it as long as he had been at this point.
- couldn't see him. Because how could Tony still love him when he was like this? Weak, tiny, useless.
“Thank you.” Tony took the case then fumbled out his own. “Uh - here.” He was supposed to say something nice here, something grateful, thanking Captain Rogers for taking him, but he couldn’t remember the speech his mom had made him practice over and over in front of the mirror. “I can’t remember what I’m supposed to say,” he admitted, then frowned when he realized that was probably worse than saying nothing.
Tony gives himself a careful once over, but it seems that all he’s suffered are some bruises and superficial cuts. There’s blood on his thigh, but it appears to be someone else’s and the rest is mostly dirt. It’s starting to be tiresome, being naked and in the wrong century, and his sympathy for Steve twinges. Steve had gone seventy years forward and for him there would be no going back. He didn’t just have to kill an hour or two in the wrong time (three at the most - come on Bruce), but even after only forty minutes here, Tony’s feeling homesick.
“I think you need to beat the eggs before you add them.” Steve frowned at the back of the box. “It doesn’t say.”
"Course not, come on." Steve picked up two of Tony's bags then wrapped his arm around his shoulders and led him away. They hustled through the drizzle to the student centre and down to the Starbucks at the back. Luckily, it wasn't too busy and they found a quiet booth in the corner. They dumped their stuff then lined up. "What do you want?" Steve asked him.
Steve could feel Anthony’s cheeks split into a smile against his chest, but he stayed quiet until Tony leaned up and kissed the tip of his nose, then he broke into sleepy giggles.
Steve skidded to a halt in front of the first stall where the door was flung open and the water pounded down, still hot even after five hours. Steve reached out and turned it off, more on autopilot than anything. When he stepped inside the stall to reach for the tap, something crunched under his foot, and he looked down to see the tiles around the drain were bent and cracked, the drain cover gone completely. He crouched and ran his fingers over the tiles. They were bent
“Oh my god.” Tony opened the suit and stepped out, laughing so hard he was struggling to draw air in. “I thought someone had released a biological weapon in your apartment,” he squeaked out. “I was one order away from mobilizing the whole team.”
Steve missed his chance. All those lingering glances and soft smiles, flirty banter and half-excused touches - they were all long lost. To Tony, Steve had disappeared, unresolved, maybe, eventually, forgotten. He hoped Tony had lived a good life, but for the second time, Steve couldn’t help but dig in to the sharp clawing pain that ripped at his chest when he wished
Steve turned to look down at Tony and caught the wicked gleam in his eye. “You don’t think I give you special attention?” he shot back.
For all that Tony’s father had insisted that Stark men were iron, Tony never had been. He’d built his iron cage to protect a soft heart, gold instead of iron. He gave the impression of strength, of iron-hard metal, but he was malleable, all too easy to press fingerprints into. What Steve was about to do would leave a mark that time would never erase.
“Thanks. We were - I mean we loved each other, but we weren’t soulmates. We knew. Um. I think… she hoped, once she realized how sick she was… that I would -” He cleared his throat.
There was something in front of the clock and he couldn’t see it well enough to read it, so he half-pushed up and reached over to clear his view. From this vantage, however, he could see that there was something on the floor. His boyfriends’ pillows?
Steve didn’t bother saying goodbye. He pushed away from the table and crossed the room to where Tony was still deep in his story. Steve interrupted, perhaps in the way that only Captain America could, and they all fell silent. “Tony, can I borrow you for a moment? Ultimates’ business.” Tony nodded, and let himself be whisked away. As soon as they were out of earshot, Steve bent to his ear and hissed, “You’re wearing my tie.”
Tony raised both eyebrows, wondering how Steve intended to finish that sentence - toys? - but that made Steve cut off and bite his bottom lip. "It's - it's fine. If you help me upstairs, I can…"
Greg laughed. “Sure you don’t. It’s been a pleasure to watch, really. How clueless my brother was in the beginning. For a self-proclaimed playboy, he really doesn’t have that much game, does he? Anyway, it’s quite nice to have it confirmed.”
A tentacle approached from the side, and Tony caught the gleam of metal. "Shit - Steve. They're going to give you an injection. I bet it's the same stuff they gave me. It's… it's pretty overwhelming. Might not affect you as much, but - but -  fuck, I wish there was something I could do…" Tony rolled his hips and the tentacle in his ass probed deeper, pushing out a moan. "I can't stop, Steve. I need it so badly."
Steve, on the other hand, was completely immune to coffee and entirely susceptible to the king-sized, AirCell™, MemoryLux mattress Tony’d had installed in his room. He was also susceptible to the draw of Wikipedia keeping him up until well past bedtime.
Tony turns, and Steve is standing there, staring at him, wide-eyed. There’s an edge of pink peeking up out of his collar and flushing back behind his ears, and Tony can’t help but smile. He loves that spunky, angry, broken boy from Brooklyn, but this is
Tony drew Nat into a ballroom hold and rocked them back and forth to the soft music that piped from Tony’s phone. She melted into his arms, and stayed light on her toes, letting his chest take her weight with uncharacteristic vulnerability. Tony moved smoothly, making sure to dodge Natasha’s bare feet as he swept her in small circles.
“Hey,” said a soft voice at this shoulder, and Tony turned and stopped breathing. Hot Window Guy was standing beside him, a black jacket with a short collar that framed his sharp jaw layered over his usual flannel.
"Little bit. After all, you were the one who thought it'd be 'distracting' if we told anyone at the school we were poly, and yet you're the one who can't make it through a single semester without booty calling your boyfriend on video tape."
Tony smiled. He dropped his fingers down to Steve’s cuff and toyed with the blue gem that matched his own. “Okay, good.”
“But technically you never married me…” Tony trailed off, and Nat turned back to her book, trying to block out the noises coming from the other side of the room.
Tony flopped back down onto the ground with a groan. His knee hurt. Bucky appeared in his peripheral vision, a hand held out to help him up to his feet.
Steve choked again and pressed both hands over his face. He knew he needed to move, find food and shelter, figure out what state the world was in, hopefully find his way back to whatever was left of his home, but the thought of Tony curled him into a ball against the cryo chamber and drew a hacking, breathless sob out of his chest.
The doors opened and they stumbled out, wrapped around each other, giggling. Tony swiped their keycard to open the door, and Steve caught him around the waist and hauled him into the suite, dodging his kicking legs, and dissolving into uncontrollable laughter. It was a beautiful room, but neither of them was looking at the scenery.
"I almost had you that time," Tony said, panting as he lay sprawled across the gym floor. A hand appeared in his line of sight and he took it.
“Someone has to,” Tony replied with a cheeky smirk of his own. “I’m sure Steve and I can find a way to… pass the time…”
The party raged around them, cheers and shouts making a wall of sound that wrapped them in a private, little bubble.
Steve looked up as the air cleared and saw red and gold armour come into view. Oh god it was - but it couldn’t be. Someone else flew the armour now? Even with Tony surely gone over a hundred years ago, Iron Man still being alive was a small comfort. “What?” Steve gasped out, knowing he had questions to ask but not knowing which ones.
“But he loves him so much that sometimes he thinks he might burst with it, and he’s not sure he can hold it in anymore.”
Nat settled on the floor by his head and set the box next to his shoulder. It rattled as she worked the lid off and a cloud of dust went up.
"Well, the universe would be hard-pressed to produce such a person." Tony gave Bucky a little nod. "Amelia's. Friday."
Tony popped the plastic cap off and slid out a rolled up piece of paper. He stretched it flat and scanned the words written on it. A slow smile bloomed on his face. “You bought me a star.”
“Oof!” Tony startled out of the doze he’d drifted into when a heavy weight landed on his lap. He blinked awake, the book he’d been failing to read slipping from his fingers.
They both watched Ant stack his turtles back on top of the roomba and finish off the pile with his skunk.
Okay! I'm all caught up on my tumblr, so I'm marking this as complete, for now. But I will add new chapters when I add new ficlets. If it gets too unwieldy, I guess I'll start a second one! Thanks for reading <3
"Steve's visiting from L.A. and he promised to cook something with food groups." To Tony's dismay, Bucky's face fell at Steve's name.
Steve turned to go, but Tony slammed his hand against the wall, mere inches from Steve’s head, halting his path. Tony leaned in until he loomed over Steve, caged between his arms. The arc reactor, freshly returned to his chest, ached, but he ignored it, focused entirely on the suddenly smaller man trapped by his body. “Oh no, sweetheart. That’s not it at all.” His voice rumbled, low in his chest. Something new, vibrant and needy was curling to life inside him. Tony’s fingers itched to move, to grab. He pressed closer. He growled. “You, like this… makes me want to
“In here!” Tony winced as Steve’s boots stomped closer. What was he going to say? How was he going to find her?
There would be soft questions, quiet laughter, a thumb smoothing away the creases that travel always bent into the corners of his eyes. He’d get a good chuckle when he tucked the mug he’d bought at the duty free into eager hands. He’d get a firm, claiming kiss when he smirked and told the story of the woman at the ticket desk who’d tried to get his number. He’d get a hug - wrapped whole and tight around him - whenever he wanted, which would be often.
“Huh.” Tony was already setting off for the elevators. The roof… Steve never used to spend time on the roof, but okay, if that was where he was, Tony would go. The doors started to close. “Wait! What’s the B-team?” But Natasha disappeared behind the closing doors before she could answer.
There was an uncharacteristic pause. “Flour particulates in great number can be combustible. Dust fires have a vast and fatal history.”
“That’s oddly specific. Um - first Home Depot run as homeowners… first forgotten date, first - uh - maybe first night as parents?” Pink flushed its way across Tony’s cheeks.
“Well. Isn’t that great.” Tony sucked in a sharp breath through his nose. He needed a drink and some of the good pills, but he couldn’t let that show. Stark men were made of iron; they didn’t break down in public. If the Stark man in question was Tony, however, they did get extremely inebriated in public, and that numbness was looking more and more appealing. “You don’t know who he is?”
"I was supposed to be, but this husband of mine caused a bit of a sensation this afternoon, so I cancelled my plans to deal with it. Sorry to interrupt your date night."
And Steve could see the story playing out in the music, the notes flirting and dancing, spinning around each other as it built and built. The sweet melody from earlier grew stronger and stronger until it overtook all the others, and Steve’s heart swelled with the emotion carried in every note.
Tony barely had time to wonder before the creature who had abducted him advanced again. "No. No. You keep your slimy tentacles to yourself. Put me back. Right now." Tony scrambled backwards until he hit the wall, but the creature didn't seem to care about his movement or his words. It stretched towards him, unhesitating, and curled a tentacle around each of his wrists.
Tony growled in frustration, jerking and writhing and grinding down on Steve’s face. “God, you’re such an asshole,” he whined. “Evil, horrible, terrible person. I’m - oh god, Steve, please, please, please.”
“You made it obvious you didn’t want to talk to me for three days and now it’s just ‘sure’?” Tony picked at a water spot on the side of the glass. “So, now you’re fine with it. You want to break up.”
Bucky laughed. "No corners here, pal, it's a circle. Either that or the whole thing's a corner. Our dark little corner." He winked then disappeared behind one of the curtains and off into the back room.
Tony met Steve’s eyes, and it made Steve’s heart pound, the glint of challenge mixed in with a warmth that Steve was never going to be able to see without feeling weak in the knees. It was getting hard, at this point, for Steve to hide his crush, but if Tony had noticed, he wasn’t bothered. He never said anything and he didn’t pull away, still always there when Steve needed him.
Steve gripped his glass tighter. He wished the alcohol would have an effect on him, but instead it was just making him feel a little dehydrated. If he had to smile at one more damn person and pretend he was alright, he was going to scream.
Steve flushed. “I think it’s really incredible. I can’t believe you built that. I mean, I can, because you’re really incredible, but… um.”
On screen, Tony curled his arm tighter around Jan’s waist and deepened the kiss between them. When they parted, Steve’s fingers flexed, and he realized he’d crushed the walkie-talkie he’d been holding into a mess of broken parts. “Shit,” he huffed to himself.
"Oh fuck," Tony breathed, as he dropped to knees next to Anthony. "What's wrong, baby?" He scooped him up into his lap, and Ant's hand opened, dropping something on the carpet.
One hundred and forty-seven pounds of fur and excited affection flung itself at Steve, and he rocked back against Tony’s chest with an
"Yeah… later…" Steve stumbled them both into the elevator, kicking Tony's clothes out of the way as he moved.
Steve laughed silently, not wanting to wake Tony, but knowing he was shaking the bed. He couldn’t help it, though. There was a petulant sort of softness in Tony’s sleep-voice, and it was too adorable. Steve shifted around under the too-tight covers to pull Tony closer. “Hey, Tony?”
Natasha stretched out on the couch, rolling her ankles. She was getting to the good part in her book, only a few chapters from the end.
Then Tony’s movements started to become more insistent. The tentacles had clearly given him more freedom than they gave Steve and he was rocking back and forth, mouth open and panting around Steve’s cock. His tiny whimpers and gentle writhing shot a jolt of arousal straight south, and Steve bit his lip hard.
Steve’s arms tightened around Tony’s back, and the baby sighed and tipped his chin onto Steve’s shoulder. “We can go back to the park tomorrow. Maybe we’ll see Mike and his dog again, huh?”
Steve reached across the table and gave Tony's chilled hand a squeeze. "Hey, I get it. I used to be really scrawny, really sickly. No one wanted to hang out with me either. It'll get easier, when you're a little older and there's not such a big gap. And hey, I have a few friends who are seventeen - I just turned nineteen, but my friend's sister, Natasha, is your age, and I love hanging out with her. You could come to our parties."
This is a present for the lovely tonystarkier who is very fond of Peanuts. Thanks for being awesome, and I hope this sequel hits the same good buttons!
Bucky laughed and it was like warm tea settling in Tony’s stomach. He turned his face to grin into the pillow. “Alright,” Bucky said. “Anything for you. Happy Birthday.”
"I'm going to take this little monster for a walk." Clint dashed out of the workshop and into the elevator.
For the first time since the drug had hit, Steve felt his head clear and his body breath a heavy sigh of relief. The intense need was still there, but diminished somewhat by his last orgasm. He shifted back a bit, the tentacles allowing them a few inches to breath, and he caught Tony's eye.
His bones creaked as he stood, but the serum was doing its job, and he was only a little dizzy when he stumbled across the lab. The door was locked, but when he tugged hard, one foot braced against the wall, the mortar around the lock crumbled to dust and the door sprung open. An explosion sounded in the distance.
"And I know this is so awkward because our night together was great and then it was over and that was all either of us agreed to."
“Nothing,” Steve said, heart crawling up into his throat. What he was about to do - he wasn’t going to be able to take back. “These jerk-offs were just leaving.” He turned to face Tony, trying to broadcast his intent on the way in. “Thanks for getting me a drink, babe,” he whispered softly. And then he kissed Tony.
Steve was his soulmate. Tony had felt it the second their eyes had met. Surety had surged through him, pulling an intense wave of affection and longing with it. But it hadn’t been the time, with the boy’s life at risk, and now Steve needed to be alone with his son.
“Mr. Stark is home,” JARVIS said pointedly, and Bucky pulled away with a yelp of surprise. They tore around the kitchen, throwing dirty dishes in the sink and wiping icing off the counters. By the time the elevator whirred up to the penthouse, they had the apartment looking halfway decent, and Steve’s chest was hardly heaving as he settled in to stand next to Bucky.
Steve grinned at him then wrapped an arm around his waist, drawing him in close. “That was my last one.”
and overrode the error codes. He reran the diagnostic and all came back clear so he emailed Mr. Stark a copy of the successful diagnostic.
turn around, but that would earn him at least another smack, probably worse, and as much as he loved testing his boundaries until they creaked, his ass was smarting now and he didn’t particularly want another.
Steve collapsed on top of him with a broken-sounding groan then immediately pushed himself back up onto a shaky elbow when that pushed a startled huff out of Tony.
"Okay, wonderful." Tony grinned at him, and Steve grinned back until they were just two naked people sitting on a bathroom floor, holding hands and grinning stupidly and someone was going to have to end this. "Okay. I - I think I'll shower in my own room." He started to push to his feet, but the movement seemed to knock something loose, and he gasped.
The demon shimmered with magic, and a moment later it stilled and nodded. “I’ve cast your spell. You’d better not call me again!” And with a poof it was gone.
“Okay.” Bucky watched him for a moment longer, then nodded to himself. “Okay.” He shuffled off, leaving white footprints across the hardwood.
Where was he? Captain Rogers - that was all Tony knew about him, really, his name - was supposed to arrive ten minutes ago, and surely the first thing he’d want to do was meet Tony, right? Maybe he didn’t care. Maybe this was just a marriage of convenience and he wouldn’t be at all interested in Tony.

Tony takes a sharp hit to the jaw and tumbles backwards until he’s pinned against the wall, but his own knuckles connect more than once, and he’s pleased at how well he’s holding his own. Then he hears a new voice shouting from the end of the alleyway.
But three days later, Mr. Stark still had not looked into it. In fact, he was doing very little in the way of work as nearly all his time was spent with Captain Rogers.
The kid looked startled for a moment then smiled softly, eyes dropping to the ground. "Thank you." He stepped away then paused, turned back. "You too."
They fell into companionable silence, Tony eating his way through the pint and Clint flipping along through his book. Tony was tired, but he knew sleep wouldn’t come. He could just tell. There was no point in working, though; the competent part of his brain had checked out about six hours of sleep deficit ago.
“You’re The Captain, right?” Mr. Stark went on. “Saw your tag on the factory in Brooklyn. I especially liked the one of me but my suit is made out of money. Classy. This one’s good too, though.” Mr. Stark pushed off the wall and walked over to the mural, stepping up close to peer at it, mumbling something else about “red.”
his self-satisfied grin. He loved reducing Tony to swear words, and god help him, Steve was damn good at it. Tony glared at the headboard in front of him, all he could see. Technically, he
“Tony.” Tony flashed his most charming smile. “Hey, Steve, wanna make a local friend? I’ll buy you a drink as an apology for letting my wild animal damage the goods.”
Steve snorted mirthlessly. Of course, Tony would try to play this off as nothing. "Well," Steve drawled. "I'm getting divorced tomorrow, so not that great, really."
Steve felt the back of his neck heating. Hottest? Really? If Tony thought he was hot, why didn’t he want to go to prom for real? But Steve loved him too much to deny him this, knowing that Tony wouldn’t push it, would accept it, but would look like a stomped puppy for a week and a half. “Sure. I guess. What would it entail?”
"No I wasn't. I left before it started." Tony slammed his briefcase down and snapped it open. He pulled out his laptop and opened it. "About ten minutes before it started, actually. You had the meeting open, on mute, getting your notes organized before it started."
Tony cut back across the workshop, ducking under the table when the staff fired again, then dove out and made a grab for the puppy's tail. "Got her!" But he didn't have her. The puppy slipped free and made a beeline for the door.
"Did you ever think about getting tested?" Tony asked, kicking his feet back and forth where they hung off the edge of the table. He stared up at the ceiling.
Steve lay back on the bed and watched Natasha grumble around the room, a rain cloud over her head. It was clear that something was tense and unpleasant between her and Bruce, and he didn’t want to push, but the leader in him was desperate to know. What if this affected the lullaby? What if Bruce was at risk of Hulking out again, and now they had no way of bringing him back down?
"Shh, shh, baby, you're okay," Tony murmured, voice shaking. What if Ant was really hurt? What if he needed stitches and he never trusted them again, or his tiny hand didn't work properly, and all because Tony had set him down for one damn second to ogle his boyfriend? "I'm sorry." He bounced Ant gently on his knee while Steve ran the water warm and made a wad of paper towel. "Steve, I broke the kid." Tony looked up at him pleadingly.
Steve felt himself start to go blissfully limp in Tony’s mouth. Tony moaned with relief and his jaw cracked and popped as he rolled it out. He was still held face down in Steve’s crotch, but without the pressure of Steve’s hard length in his throat, he was able to breathe fully again, sucking in wet sounding breaths sharply around Steve’s dick. The cold air was uncomfortable but no where near as uncomfortable as Tony’s unwilling cockwarming had been.
Steve hadn't figured out who Tony was until the next morning when he woke to delicious, expensive, Italian roast being delivered by room service, and found Tony on the balcony, speaking briskly on the phone in what sounded like very confident, if not perfectly fluent, Mandarin. They'd had breakfast, Tony working, and Steve reading the paper, then shared a kiss, a thank you, and gone their separate ways.
"Hey, sweetheart. Come here." Steve drew Tony into his arms and kissed him soundly, erasing the hundred heartless kisses he'd shared with Bucky that day. But Steve could always tell when something was off with Tony. "You okay?"
An echo of the musty tang of the gym mats from their sparring earlier took Tony back what felt like years. Then the tentacle wrapped around Steve's cock, deep inside Tony, curled its tip against his prostate and all rational thought collapsed in the face of another bone-shattering orgasm.
“Yeah. So. I think it’s best if I go home. You should stay and have a good time, though. Don’t worry about me, okay? I’ll be fine.” Steve turned to go, but Tony’s hand snatched a fistful of his suit jacket.
He turned and pointed to another man who was leaning against the side of a bank just down the street. He had blond hair and shoulders for days and was typing something on his phone. "That's my boyfriend," Tony's wallet rescuer explained.
"If you enter that arena, they'll strip you of your powers," Tony said, heart clenching. He longed to reach out and take Steve's hand.
And, god, if holding Steve's hand hadn't been all Tony wanted for months now. "Fuck," Tony cried, the tentacles ramping up their assault on his body again. He couldn't come all over Steve, he couldn't, but shit that was where he was headed. Steve's body was being worked closer and closer until they were sharing the same air.
"Yes, of course. Come here." Tony held out a hand and Steve scooted across the floor to take it. It felt silly, sitting there on the tile, naked and covered in… everything, really, but Tony wasn't feeling quite ready to stand yet, and Steve didn't seem inclined too either. His hand felt right in Tony's. "Thank you. Honestly… that was obviously terrifying, but might have also been some of the most mind-blowing sex I've ever had."
Steve’s perfect, serum-enhanced memory lets him scroll through those moments and catalogue them. How had he not noticed before?
Steve’s lips twitched up on one side and his eyes softened. He tilted his head to the side. “I think I can take you.”
"Limo service had already dropped me off when they starting murdering flights left and right and I thought I might as well get a room at the hotel here, rather than call the car again only to drive an hour back to yet another identical hotel. But then I thought, why not find some company?"
Bucky groaned. “I’m so sorry, baby. Go back to sleep? I’ll call you in like… six hours and try again.”
Steve's experiment continued all semester. Tony wasn't his only repeat customer, but he was the only one that Steve knew by name, and the only one who sunk into Steve's hugs for a full breath, arms tight around his waist and face pressed into his chest. Tony seemed to
Steve propped himself up on one knee and folded his arms over the back of the seat. "Still want to share my outlet?" He bit his lip and raked his eyes down Tony's body. He really was even hotter in person, and that was saying something.
Steve cupped the back of Tony’s hands then brought them together between his. “Do you know what I can still feel?”
, and we’re still without a bass player, and Bucky’s been playing bass for nine years. I promise he’s good. And I told him it was an audition, not a promise, and he’s cool with that. He just got back from deployment and he misses playing with other people. He’s not like… you know.” Clint shrugged.
Steve hummed thoughtfully then wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist and drove him backwards towards the door to the penthouse. “Maybe later. You can put on the mesh hat. For now… I really missed you.”
He would just have to go to Tony himself and explain why they should be together. This plan was failsafe! He put on his best suit, combed his hair and brushed his teeth, then admired himself in the mirror. Perfect.
All of this was so new, Tony wasn’t quite sure how to categorize it. Steve and Bucky had started dating, but hadn’t told anyone. Tony, as it happened, found out only three days later and the resulting
"Oh." Tony swallowed heavily. "When's tryouts?" fell out of Tony's mouth without permission. The man's eyebrows shot up, and Tony immediately started backtracking. "Shit, sorry. That was so inappropriate."
“Oh, Steve,” Tony said softly. “I’m so sorry. But it’s okay. You didn’t lose us. Just a week, I promise.”
Steve grinned. It was a position he was painfully familiar with, and there was something gratifying about seeing it directed at someone else for once.
Tony led the way back inside, and drew Steve right out onto the dance floor and into his arms. Steve held him tight, afraid that if he let him go, he’d wake up and it would all disappear. He buried his face in Tony’s hair and breathed in, unable to stop grinning, unable to stop tracing the length of Tony’s spine with his fingers. Tony swirled his fingertips through the hair at the nape of Steve’s neck and pressed another kiss to his jawline. “We’re going to use the bet money to go on a really nice date,” he said.
He looked around him as if one of the strangers walking by would stop and back him up. “I wasn’t flirting, Tony. She’s amazing. Her work with oil paint is revolutionary. You should see how she approaches colour. It’s -
Steve swallowed heavily. Tony Stark was hitting on him in an airport in Chicago. That didn't seem like a thing that happened. That couldn't be happening. "This isn't happening," Steve informed him.
Steve climbed fully on the bed, covering Tony completely with his solid warm weight. But there was still something off in his tone, his shoulders.
Steve grabbed his cane from where it leaned against the wall and shuffled down the hallway. He lowered himself to his armchair and settled in. His eyes cut, as they always did, up to the mantle where Tony sat. “Good evening, my love.”
Tony stepped out into the hall to find Steve in his pre-serum body, frowning at the wiggly little dog, who was now trying to lick his face. "I'll take that," Tony said, yanking the staff out of the puppy's mouth.
“I was also thinking, you know, Sam’s a great roommate, but you could probably use some help so I was wondering if… well, I thought maybe I could be your roommate? Just till you feel better?”
fallen for, in one way or another, there does seem to be a trend: brown-haired, gorgeous, sassy, smart.
In the end, Tony put on the suit and flew around the city at bone-shaking speeds until the vertigo made him feel on more solid ground.
Steve took the tool and slotted it carefully into the screw, hyper aware that this wasn’t just a piece of machinery he was working on, it was a piece of Tony.
“Don’t deny me those three weeks, Steven. I intend to make them most of them. Besides, I’m not fifty-one,
Steve shrugs. “It’s fine. I’ve had worse.” He wipes it again, only deteriorating the situation on his face. “You gonna tell me how you wound up naked and in an alley fight?”
“Okay. Okay.” Tony set his champagne down and let Steve slip him out of the party. Steve led them out of the huge double doors on the main gathering hall to a balcony that looked out over the compound grounds, but he didn’t stop there. He wound his way up the spiral stairs to the roof. The wind whipped Tony’s hair up, and he shivered and wrapped his arms around himself, but barely a heartbeat later, he was tucked in the warm leather of Steve’s jacket.
“Okay.” Everything about Tony softened. “Okay. It’s okay, Steve.” He dropped his eyes to the floor then smiled. He rolled his gaze back up, his soft smiling twisting into a cheeky grin. “When you’re ready, though? I don’t think I’ll mind.” He winked then climbed up into the front of the van to talk to Clint and Jan.
Tony next cornered Steve in the gym, his eyes flicking up and down as Steve bounced on the treadmill. “Steve. We need to talk.”
Tony tugged Steve closer in the dark of their shared bedroom, sleep already pulling at his eyelids heavily. “I love you,” he whispered into Steve’s skin.
Tony was sitting on the couch flipping through his emails on a tablet when Steve called out, ”Hey, Tony?” from the kitchen.
The fight went on until they were both pink and panting, covered in snow from head to foot. Tony’s knit hat was soaking wet and drooping down his face, and Bucky’s hair clung to his chin in damp, matted strands. Bucky had shedded two of his layers. Tony had quickly built a ridge of snow as a defensive position, while Bucky kept his spot near the compound wall. Tony used the repulsor in his watch to melt Bucky’s snowballs before they could hit him, but trying to defend his fort and make new snowballs at the same time was splitting his focus, and Steve could see Bucky’s plan taking shape.
Steve nodded. "Yeah. Must be. I mean you're obviously brilliant, and I'm sure you get that a lot, but lots of brilliant people don't do anything with it. To study as hard as you obviously are… that takes a lot of strength."
“I’m trying to think. He might never have had any. He hates the smell of peanut butter so I can’t think when he would have - but maybe with the chocolate -”
the hugs more than anyone else who said, "for exam luck!" and laughed as they quickly pulled Steve in with one arm then released him again, or the shy ones whose friends pushed them towards him. Tony was always in a hurry, always stressed, always had at least three bags - heavy-looking bags - and his smile never reached all the way up to his eyes, at least Steve had never seen it do so, but they were usually covered by dark sunglasses, regardless of the weather.
“Oh, how nice.” Steve’s stomach was all in knots just from being around Tony. “I’ve never been to the opera.”
Then it was releasing him. The tentacles slid away, leaving Tony gasping for breath. "What the -?" He tried to shuffle backwards, moving away from it instinctively, only to realize that he was free-floating, gravity  its usual pull, and his movement only sent him spinning wildly through the air. This wasn’t the locker room shower stall anymore, it wasn't even Avengers Tower. The creature had taken him somewhere completely different.
Tony was twisting around, trying to find a way to get it out without dropping it on the ground and smashing, it when something did smash, but it wasn’t his phone. A loud bang upstairs was followed by frantic footsteps and the sound of wood splintering. Tony tensed, unsure if he should be trying desperately to hide himself or be screaming for help.
“I’ve wanted that for a long time,” Steve admitted when they parted. “I’ve always liked you but I didn’t know how to tell you. You’re so experienced, and - and smooth, I thought you might laugh at me.”
But with Steve, Tony couldn’t bring himself to share his feelings until it was too late to, and this, apparently, was his punishment.
The room fell silent, and Steve burrowed closer. Tony was warm and all around him and Rowdy was breathing steadily at his feet. He felt safe, undeniable safe, and even though the couch cushions were no Tempurpedic, and they hadn’t quite figured out the thermostat so it was a few degrees too cold, and Steve knew he was going to wake up in the night, needing to pee, but not able to find the bathroom in the maze of boxes in the dark, it was perfect.
Steve ran up the front steps to the apartment building, his mail key already in his pocket. He shoved it in the lock and swung the door open, heart pounding.
“Wow, Tony, you’re being so good for me.” Steve’s voice wrapped around Tony like a warm blanket, filled him up and flushed through his veins.
Clint didn’t have a cat did he? Tony had definitely seen the light flicker as if feet were walking past the door. He turned the knob as silently as he could and pulled the door open. The hall was empty. He sighed.
Tony managed to behave himself as they flew back to the tower, then he sprung out of his seat and dragged Steve off towards the penthouse. Steve let himself be dragged, unable to hold back a smile of his own. It was pretty wild to see Tony like this. His features were softer, smoother, his face a little rounder, and his trademark goatee was missing. They’d estimated that Tony had been blasted back to around twenty-three or twenty-four, and it was hard to believe he was around the age Steve had been when he’d joined the army.
He leaned over and flicked off the light, plunging them into darkness. Nat rolled over once, and less than a minute later, he could hear her breathing soften. It seemed one of her many skills was that she could fall asleep instantly anywhere and awaken perfectly between one heartbeat and the next. It was probably necessary, considering all the bizarre places she’d likely had to find her rest.
He didn’t know how much time had passed at this point. The aliens showed no sign of relenting and provided no clue as to what would satisfy them. For all he knew, they would both die here like this.
This kiss went on, shifting hotter and more intense as Tony explored Steve’s mouth with his tongue and Steve’s hands crept up Tony’s back. Tony kissed Steve like he’d find an extension for his finals at the back of Steve’s throat and it was
They sat that way, in the growing dawn, watching the sunrise pierce the gloomy sky with its rays. They heard the birds sing their good mornings, and the shuffle of animals in the barn. They watched the beginning of a new day.
“Hey, man.” Tony walked over to the freezer and dug through the cartons until he found a tub of rocky road.
Steve continued his path around the room, until his gaze settled on yet another table that was situated up on the higher level, but set away a bit from the main press of bodies. There were four men at this table, also dressed more finely than the others, but with an air of propriety about them that had Steve wondering how they were connected to the club. He knew Fury was the manager, though he'd never met him, but Bucky talked about an owner too, frowning every time he did.
“What? No. This is all business. I said I’d save the flirting for later. So… ”’ Tony raised an eyebrow, his voice dropping low. “Wanna spend later with me, hot stuff?”
Steve tried to smile. “Amazing.” He twisted his wand between his fingers. “You’ll catch the prince’s attention, no doubt.”
Tony had been jealous before, but not like this, never like this. It wasn’t bragging to say that if he set his sights on someone, they were usually into it. Sometimes for the wrong reasons, but…
Tony turned to where Steve had taken a gentle hold of his elbow. “What?” He laughed. “They’re about to do the cake and candles and stuff.”
Steve closed his sketchbook and shoved it under his pillow, crawling in after it. He tossed and turned until he heard Bucky come in, several hours later, and even after that, his sleep was fitful at best.
“Oh my god, we’re stuck,” Tony hollered. “We’re going to die here, naked, trapped between two beds. Housekeeping is going to have to rescue us.” He snorted and set off laughing again.

Tony's cue was a loud bang, and he jumped up and fired several blanks from his prop gun. Voices called more effects cues in the background. "It's pretty obvious, Bucky," he whispered sharply. "Why don't you just tell me the truth?"
"I know. And you get to play, and that's wonderful, honest. I didn't mean to be so…" Steve waved a hand dismissively. "I really am sorry. I'm just jealous cause I want to make art as badly as you want to play, but no one wants to pay me to do it."
Tony stepped under the water and let his eyes fall shut, tipping his chin up to wash the sweat from his brow. He squirted some body wash in his palm and rubbed it over his chest. God, if only it were Steve's fingers there, soothing the fingerprint bruises he'd made during their sparring. Tony tipped back under the warm water and let his hand drift south, mind wandering down a path it tread all too often.
digging into his chest. How could he have misread that so badly? How was Steve such a good actor? They’d laughed and joked, held hands, kissed with morning breath. Steve had bought him an
“I don’t even want to know what conversation you managed to fit into the -” Steve checked his watch “- six minutes I was gone that led to this.” He tossed the mail on the table and crossed the room to stand next to Tony’s chair. Bucky winked and stood up again, which left Tony’s lap free, so Steve sat on the arm of the chair and snuggled one hand under the hem of Tony’s shirt.
Tony didn’t quite smile, but he softened, like he’d let out a tense breath and was breathing easily again. Steve slung the blanket around Tony’s shoulders and settled on the bench swing next to him, letting out his own breath when Tony wrapped the blanket around his shoulders too and curled up close beside him. Steve rocked the swing softly, the way Tony had been, and tucked one arm around his waist, pulling him in even closer. He buried his face in Tony’s hair and breathed in. “I’m so sorry.”
Bucky sighed, but whipped his spatula around the bowl vigorously, nearly spraying cake mix across the kitchen counter. Steve yelped and smacked his shoulder, but when Bucky stopped, sure enough, the batter was smooth.
Tony could take rejection, he really could. You didn't make it as far in acting as he did without getting really intimately acquainted with rejection. But Bucky wouldn't reject him. Instead, he kept reeling Tony in closer and closer with soft looks and coy smiles, and then every time Tony tried to take the step to push it into something voiced out loud, Bucky pushed him violently away again.
Laura and Steve’s voices rumbled outside, but they were talking too quietly for Tony to make out the words. Steve was out there, though. This time, he was sure. He stood up and shook out his arms like a boxer getting ready for a fight.
“Whereas look at me? I’m so sleep-deprived I have no idea what day of the week it is, my skincare routine for the past three months has mostly consisted of projectile baby oatmeal, and my husbands are so exhausted, I can’t get a solid roll in the hay to save my life. Not that I have the energy for it.”
As the night went on, blankets came out and they all snuggled down to look at the washed-out stars and talk quietly. Steve got up to get a marshmallow out of the bag someone had brought up and the wild wind drew him towards the railing. He folded his arms over the edge and looked out over the rooftops.
Steve traced the lines of Tony's lean body, catching the way he was twisted towards him, his back to the customer service desk, chest open towards Steve. He still had Steve's profile up on his phone, which he was cradling in his lap, and there was something hesitant and hopeful in his smile.
Steve grabbed his cane from where it leaned against the wall and shuffled down the hallway. He lowered himself to his armchair and settled in. His eyes cut, as they always did, up to the mantle where Tony sat. “Good evening, my love.”
There was a guy, who had apparently been tasked with changing the window display each day. With each new art medium, the guy took down the old display and put up a new one, featuring a selection of art using that medium. Tony hoped he was the artist - each one had the same SR scrawled in the corner - but even if he wasn’t, he was hot as shit, and Tony had struggled to pull his gaze away that first night.
But then Steve dabbed again, and he started to reveal Ant's palm underneath the smeared blood. Tony let out a slow breath of relief. The cut was barely more than a scrape. It had welled up with blood from Ant squeezing and releasing his hand, but the actual injury was hardly anything. Steve dabbed more, folding the paper towel to a clean side, while Tony hushed Ant gently and pressed distracting kisses to his forehead. The kisses turned into raspberries as Ant's sobbing calmed into hitching breaths, and when Tony blew against his temple, he got the barest huff of a giggle.
He shot Clint a withering look then chucked the spoon towards the sink. It ricocheted off the faucet handle with a power that would have impressed Tony if he hadn’t been so pissed off. With a loud “ping” both the spoon and the now broken faucet handle flew into the air, skittering across the counter. Tony glared at it, absolutely done. He turned on his heel and marched away towards the back stairs before Steve could catch him, hearing Clint muttering, “Handling it really well, I see,” behind him.
Tony took his briefcase and left, his feet tapping up the stairs. Steve took his seat. "You okay?" he asked.
“Yes, please.” Tony’s smirk softened into something warmer, and Steve sipped his gingerale to push down the sudden knot in his throat. “You’re hot, you’re talented, you’re smart - assuming those murals are your design. As long as you’re single and interested, I would very much like to go out with you.”
Steve pressed himself to the wall and made his way down the hall towards the sounds of battle. Another explosion rocked the foundation of the castle, and dust poured down from the ceiling. Steve dipped his eyes to the ground and blinked, keeping the showering of brick dust from falling in his eyes.
The man with the star, Steve, watched Tony’s graceful fingers pop the watch box open and flash it in the light. “It’s very beautiful,” he said.
They varied wildly in ages, young men and old men alike, plenty looking like they'd just finished up a hard day's work and stopped in before heading home to the missus. Steve scowled at that. He knew all too well how often men like that didn't make it all the way home.
Steve reached for him, pulling him closer, scanning his face. Was it really him? “Tony is that you?”
It took almost forty-five minutes to decorate the cake. Bucky squeezed out the last crooked flower and they both stood back to examine it.
Steve snorted. Wow. Did this guy really think people were stupid enough to fall for that? He could sort of understand snagging an insta model's pic, but that was
“Just say you’ll do it.” Tony picked the tomatoes off his burger. “Then say you’ll go out to dinner with me.” He set them aside and took a bite. “If you want.”
When Clint came down a few hours later, he pulled out his phone. Steve heard Tony’s voice through the speaker. “Thanks, man!” Clint said.
On the screen, Bucky watched in horror as his face appeared, the sounds of Tony getting ready for work in the background. A student had recorded the meeting, presumably for their own notes. But they'd caught something else instead.
Tony dropped his face in his hands and scrubbed hard. “Fuck, Steve. You can’t - you won’t - I asked you to leave me alone so I could get over you and instead you kiss me and tell me you like me? You can’t do that. You have a boyfriend. I won’t be a homewrecker, okay? Just let me go.”
The three of them lay like that for a while, recovering their strength and their breath, wallowing in the way every touch was magnified by a thousand and the bed sheets smelled like all three of them combined. Then Steve shifted, the first to get antsy, and they all three sat up and rolled out of bed.
Steve never slowed, winding Tony up into madness as his nerves went overboard with sensation. Tony took two handfuls of the front of the Captain America suit, pressed his forehead to Steve’s and hung on for dear life.
“There is someone at the door downstairs, sir,” the AI helpfully informed him. “I was trying something new.”
Tony estinates he has about forty-five minutes before Bruce gets de-Hulked and figures out to cut the other wire. It was a fifty-fifty chance, and he rolled the dice and lost - it happens - but he’d uploaded the reverse engineered schematics to JARVIS before he’d snipped, so if Bruce gets his hands on the bomb, he’ll be able to bring Tony back. Hopefully. Assuming his math is correct.
The bow came off, followed by the paper, and Tony pulled a smaller box out of the bigger box. He snapped the box open and found a shiny, gold watch inside. It was a beautiful watch, ornately decorated with little stars picked out in silver and twinkling precious gems. Tony turned the watch back and forth in his hands, admiring the pretty surface. The stars made him think of someone - someone he thought of often.
Tony pulled back and raked his eyes suggestively down to where Steve’s top button was popped open. “I more meant because then we get this honeymoon, but sure, get all sappy about it.”
The wind whipped rough and biting through the wasteland this ice planet had become, broken ruins of buildings, once magnificent, littered the snow. They were trapped, but the remains of their ship was pumping out just enough heat to keep them alive, and they had two weeks of rations stashed away. It wasn’t going to be pleasant, but it was doable. Tony’s fingers and toes were stiff and tingling, his nose aching. He snuggled down deeper in his jacket, but his eyes cut over to Steve when he shivered again.
Steve skated his palms up Tony’s smooth, slight back. They should probably just wait patiently for the spell to wear off but… Tony nipped at Steve’s bottom lip and Steve flipped him onto the bed with a growl, swallowing down his laughter with a kiss.
The back door opened and Jan appeared, followed soon after by Tony, one hand pressing against her back to boost her into the van. “Did they buy it?” she asked, eyes cutting to the monitor.
"Oh, no. Uh." Tony landed next to Steve and flipped the faceplate up. He dropped to one knee and watched as Steve looked down at himself with dawning horror.
Still, the aliens showed no sign of relenting and provided no clue as to what would satisfy them. For all he knew, they would both die here like this.
“God, it killed me to say those things to you, Tony. I just needed you to leave. And I didn’t want them to see that you could be used as leverage against me. But I guess I’m not as good an actor as I thought. They must have seen something in my face and they sent someone after you. I’m so sorry I put you in danger. I went after you, after they left, to tell you everything, and I found the wine bottle broken on the sidewalk -” Steve’s voice broke.
Steve snuggled down deeper in his squishy armchair, tugging the polar fleece blanket back in place when it slipped off his feet. A fire crackled in the fireplace at his side, warming him from tip to toe, and outside the window, Steve could see nothing but a vast field of white, ending with white-topped evergreen trees that lined the lane to the compound.
Steve saw the stall for what it was. One eyebrow arched up. Fuck, he looked good. His hair was longer, combed back from his face, and he had a beard of all things. A nice one. Tony’s flush deepened, and he all but growled. He wasn’t far along enough yet that he couldn’t kick Steve out right now and that was also frustrating. A part of him wished Steve had come later, when he was crazy, out of his mind with need, and then he wouldn’t have to choose. Then he could hate him more easily afterward.
“Your birthday isn’t for another two weeks,” Steve said, not pulling his eyes away from where Bucky gyrated.
Bucky waited until Tony ducked down behind his makeshift wall and then he bolted. Buck ran at top speed across the snow then twisted around behind Tony’s defenses and let loose with an absolute barrage of snowballs.
“Leave it, Barton,” Steve snapped. He slunk further down in his seat, fierce gaze never leaving the monitor.
“I’ll go if you want me to,” Steve went on softly, “but I know you have no choice, and I don’t want you to go through this alone. Maybe you’ve -” Steve’s voice creaked under pressure “- found someone else to help you, in which case,
This is for my bday prompt party, for anon who wanted Tony travelling back to the 1940s. Naked. Thanks for the prompt anon!
“Why not? I thought this was what you wanted. It’s what you told me you wanted.” Steve’s heart sunk. He’d fallen in love with his charge and hadn’t even successfully made his wish come true.
