A/N: Randomly wanted Benny and Balthazar to get it on and this is what happened :s
But where their first night together they didn’t know how they felt about each other, sure that they didn’t feel the same,
“No, there’s more,” the man replies quietly.
Cas cautiously peeked into his thoughts- he wasn't quite under yet, but he was slipping fast.
Chuck. Wow, now Dean could tell how people got confused when it was him and Cas in the same body.
Cas wrapped his arm around Chuck's and helped to steady him as they began to walk back to the house from the garden. The ex-angel's mind was reeling. What if in
Sam had to smile a little bit. It seemed like Chuck might be starting to get a little used to the idea that the angels he'd been fathering and taking care of since the Fall really were his kids. But all the other stuff he still seemed reluctant to even consider.
They were running, but the incline was impossible as the loose, black sediments kept them slipping down over and over again. "Claire!" It was Cas's voice this time, barking out and coughing on the soot. "Claire,
"Dean..." He murmured.
Nothing. Dean looked at the girl, and could see the floaters in the orange vitreous body of her eyeballs through the not-so-black-after-all openings of her pupils. His head pounded. This was getting even worse.
"There's the Chuck we know." Sam smiled at him. He hated seeing the little guy in such distress. The three of them felt like maybe he wouldn't be that bad of a father, despite being single since high school without any action for the same amount of time.
Dean felt the blood drain from his face. And
"Hey, you're pretty shaken up right now." Sam sprung up and chased after him. "Hold on. Do you need any help?"
about it, but um..." Chuck finally broke eye contact and once again nervously scrubbed the back of his head.
"Mm." Dean simply grunted in acknowledgement before twisting his fingers clean into a thin takeout napkin. "Let's get goin'. Sam says the two of you got work to do."
Cas looked up, confused as he squinted his eyes. Kevin lowered his smartphone. "Sorry. It was just really cute."
"What?" Dean asked.
?" He huffed. "If you haven't noticed, I'm a
"Yeah, well, you didn't. And I'm...I'm damn glad you didn't. I need you here, man." Dean sighed and pressed his palms to his cheeks and rubbed, and Cas could hear the faint scrubbing of his bristles against his callouses, and he finally ventured to look at him again. Dean finally clasped his hands together in his lap and tipped his head back to look at the green lacy canopy of leaves bobbing overhead.
"That's not how it would have worked, and you know it." Cas growled, coming a bit closer. "Believe me, I would have done anything in my power to find him. Like I said, this darkness hinders me. I could not locate him like I did for you." He gripped onto Dean's shirt. "And I could not let you die, Dean. Not like that." That was when Dean felt it- a strong surge of emotion, washing over him like a tide, and the foreignness of it made his head spin. Dean remembered the past few days like he had been in a haze, but he did remember now what Cas had said about the bond.
"Yeah, you said that, but I don't know what the hell that means!" Dean barked back. "I'm not letting a stranger into our house."
Dean sucked in a breath and his eyes fell closed, he fell forward and his chain clinked as it stopped him from falling completely forward as he pressed his palm to the cold concrete floor. "...Cas," He croaked weakly. The angel couldn't help but reach out and steady him with his clean hand on his shoulder. "It's alright, Dean. This is almost over."
Dean chuckled at that, with these dense volumes it was known to happen. "Alright, kid. Enough dead trees for now. Off to bed. Cas is already there to tuck you in."
"Yes." The angel replied. "There is that as well."
Dean caught his own reflection in a piece of glass, he looked ridiculous with all those tan band-aids willy nilly all over his face. Like he'd been playing doctor with a bunch of overexcited five-year-olds with a box of bandaids. Hopefully he'd be able to take them all off soon, but he needed to keep them on for a little while as the open sores healed. He had swatches of purplish underneath his eyes and his eyes had puffy bags underneath them. Holy
In Jack's room, their bodies were in a sleep-like state as Jack's jaw and lips moving in subtle swallows as the glowing white mist flowed from the exact center of Cas's chest.
There was a thump on the wall.
"I didn't know you got alcohol flush." Dean chuckled, taking the tube of neosporin and squeezing a bit out onto his fingers, rolling it around to be warm and spreadable.
Jack padded down the hallway, and stopped in front of Cas and Dean's door. He took in an anxious breath, and he knew Cas would be able to sense him standing outside.
at that?"
Adjusting at first was...interesting.
A man was sleeping by the store's entrance by the cart return, his hand extended with a tin cup with a few quarters and dimes in it. Chuck pressed a five dollar bill into the can, and the man stirred as he felt the can dip slightly. He met Chuck's eyes.
Dean's eyes narrowed in suspicion. "Why would you wear out your whole damn voice and kill your hands like that just to tell me that their
No "angel radio" as Dean had nicknamed it.
"Well...yeah," Leo joked back with a tiny sniffle. "You've got six wings. Put 'em to use and fly me there."
The look in Cas's deep blue eyes almost killed Dean. He'd seen that look before, when Sam was little and would beg to keep the little kittens he'd found.
the wind bit at the apples of cheeks and tips of noses and everyone smelled of body odor and dumpsters but they still pressed tight to each other and pretended they didn't mind.
A second went by when Dean had no idea if his friend was alive or dead. Dean crossed his fingers, even though he knew it was dumb to believe in luck, and muttered under his breath "C'mon, Chuck. Not you too."
"Is that another...family member of yours?" Dean asked, realizing how awkward the question was. How do you politely ask if he's naming another angel after someone he'd killed?
Dean snorted and finally wriggled down into his own sleeping bag. The kid just sounded so much like Cas sometimes.
?! I'm useless now, Cas! I don't have an arm, how the hell am I supposed to help you? I can't shoot a gun, I can't fight, I..." He trailed off, shaking his head. "You should have left me, and looked for him. You should have left me to die in that car, if it meant you could have rescued Sam."
"You need release." The angel snaked his hand around the back of his neck, just the way Dean loved. "In more ways than one."
There was no doubt now, he knew. The Darkness made humans so incredibly ravenous that they'd begin to crave human flesh very, very soon. And Croatoan would rear its ugly head, as prophesied.
"I can't Dean! I really can't!" He exclaimed, frustrated. "That first night, when I went to the roof? I wanted to..to.." He dug his palms into his eyes. "I wanted to smash it. I thought about hurting them."
"Cas, wait-!" Dean yelped as he almost shut the door. "I have a couple sandwiches in the fridge, Cas, I am
"Terrible twos and teenage years all rolled into one." Sam chuckled, slipped in a bookmark, and finally shut his book with a faint snap. "Who would have thought
"You're going to fly again, Leo, I promise." Tobias answered, but he was still uncertain. It showed as his brown eyebrows drew together.
"-And you're not actually the
Cas slipped his arms around Tobias's lower ribcage and flattened his palms on his back. He didn't know what to say for a second. "You're...very tall." Cas mumbled awkwardly.
He nodded, and Dean dipped the cup in the warm water and poured it over his skin. "Okay. Let's get you out and we have to clean those cuts, Cas."
Dean struggled with the door, jerking it hard backward, then throwing his body weight on it. "Let me out of here! So
Dean tucked the paper back into his pocket and didn't move out of Cas's way. He folded his arms.
"Okay, okay." Dean wheeze-laughed. "Cas?"
Chuck was waiting for them at his desk, and Sam, Dean and Kevin where escorted into the room by a few other fallen angels.
Shit, Dean thought. Did Cas find out from one of the angels about Chuck's real identity?
"C'mon, it was
Dean scolded himself, embarassed at his childish thought.
Dean had to pretend he didn't feel a rush of nerves when Cas slipped into bed beside him a moment later and the mattress creaked. He didn't turn to look at him, but rather just reached out to turn off the bedside lamp with a faint click. Cas rustled to try and get comfortable, but at least the two weren't touching. There seemed to be enough space between them so they could just keep to themselves.
"Why the
"How's the..uh..identity crisis?" Dean asked, and Chuck snorted out a laugh.
Dean's eyes widened and he exchanged glances with Sam. His grace, whatever Metatron stole- he had gotten it back.
"Wing anatomy. And some life drawing practice." Sam pushed his thick brown hair out of his forehead and tucked it behind his ear. "This will be really helpful, Jack, because me and Dean can't see them. And once you learn this skill, you can make field sketches of any kind of monster or creature you encounter, and journal it. So you can help other hunters in the future, like your grandpa did with his."
"I don't have a fever." Dean said, looking up at him in confusion. "I feel fine. I really want to get out of this
"I should probably sleep as well, shouldn't I?" Cas ran a hand down his face. "It's been a long day."
"Oh, um..Dean...one more thing." Chuck added as Dean made his way out the doorway of his bedroom. "I think...no, I am..I'm ready for you to tell Cas who I am. I think it's sunk in enough for me to own up to it with him."
“It’s finished.” Cas’s voice yanked Jack from the floatiness of pre-sleep, and Jack squinted and yawned. It was a beautiful sketch, capturing the likeness of Dean so well even without showing his face. Jack traced his fingertips over the flowing lines in awe.
One sense of entertainment was trying to figure out what was going outside the dark, iron walls of this dungeon. I'd only heard tidbits of conversation to let me know that the little fledglings had hatched.
"Rude." Dean chuckled after him, lowering his hand. He looked over to the bed and saw that Cas had fallen asleep again, despite having just downed a cup of coffee. Sam was plucking the babies around him one-by-one to put in the crib, but Cas was curled around the smallest one with the black wings, Leoniel. The baby was wearing a light blue footsie with little clouds on it, his dark and downy wings sprouting from the slits Dean had gone through every pair of clothing and made. He was laying on Cas's tummy, and at first glance it almost could look like the black wings were from Cas.
My guilt was the worst part of this prison. For example, I hadn't thought about when I'd consumed that angel egg since I'd done it. And now I couldn't take my mind off of it.
"Oh, stop that." Tobias laughed as he felt the moisture wicking through his clothes and he rubbed Cas's back, grinning. "You're embarrassing me."
The was a beat of silence. "Dean." His voice was small and muffled behind the door.
The two were quiet as they nodded, and Bobby hesitated before turning around, spreading out all four of his tiny eagle-brown wings before folding them clumsily to rest against his back.
"Hey, "The Darkness" can't tell a joke like that!" Dean surprised himself at how much better he felt when he was smiling. "Cas,
The dark-haired man hesitated before nodding very slightly, and finally moving slowly from the doorpost and down the hall, his dragging footsteps making little shuffling noises.
Chuck pursed his lips. "Ah...small amounts. I'm hoping that it will all come back to me, eventually." He looked past the brothers and smiled, coming up to the baby archangel who was napping sweetly on the floor, a tiny toy car limply held in one of his hands.
, he looked like shit.
"Hey, the Hunting business ain't about looking pretty." Dean replied. "-Just want to keep you safe, Cas."
"Never said I was going to." Calcifer grinned.
happy, Dean." Cas mumbled, looking out the window as the stores went by.
, that was it. Not like he was
"You're a Winchester. I'll be damned." Bobby spoke up before he could finish. "I can tell, it's by the way you're carrying yourself. No doubt about it."
"Uh..that yours?" Dean asked awkwardly, clearing his throat. "You do a little fooling around without a condom?"
, come to an end.
"What an asshole," Dean laughed, as they watched he kissed an older woman on the cheek and got a few crumbled bills.
"I'm okay. Thank you." Chuck reached for his glass of water and took another sip. A silence fell on the four men.
, the angel thought in a panic,
"Dean-" Sam was the one who saw them coming on the security cams and answered the door, immediately snatching some of the grocery's out of Dean's and Jack's grasps. "Seriously? You can take two trips, you know."
"So, I mean, you need more energy, right?" Dean asked as they waited for the woman to finish their checkout, endless monotone beeps as the blue lit number climbed higher and higher.
"Cas. I think first off, you need more sleep." Dean felt bad that he hadn't seen the signs of total fatigue earlier. He had been kept pretty busy. "And now, you need to calm down. I don't know if you're having an anxiety attack or something, or you're fatigued or something but Cas, you have to pull yourself together. Deep breath, Cas.
"Still in heaven, doing door-to-doors, trying to get something together. We didn't intend to meet you here, it was only because Leo got hurt. I'm sorry about that." Tobias sat down and ran a hand through his mousy brown hair, letting out a sigh and stretching out his long legs. "I don't know what we're doing. I don't know if we can do this."
"Where in the classification would you put me?" Cas asked innocently, looking up into Dean's face. "A friend?"
Dean and Cas didn't say anything to each other at dinner. Neither did Kevin as he noticed that the two men were fueding, even though he'd been planning for a long conversation. Dean had his arms crossed, while Cas avoided everyone's gaze and was looking at his plate of food only, the noodles slipping off his fork time after time and flecking red spaghetti sauce everywhere.
"So, I guess... you're the guy then, huh?" Sam cleared his throat and spoke up.
"Yes. I believe that would be helpful." Cas answered drowsily, rubbing his eye sleepily.
"Phantom limb syndrome." Cas explained quietly. "I thought that might happen to you. It was...torn away quite violently."
Cas tipped his head to the side. "Your heartbeat is very fast, Dean. And I'm sensing anxiety. What's wrong?"
"Yeah, tell me about it." Dean chuckled. "Now, you too, Sammy. Time to hit the hay."
The former angel quickly stood up, rushing out the door.
There was something so comforting about him, teaching came so naturally. Jack loved it when he adjusted his reading glasses or swiped his thick brown hair and tucked it behind both ears. He'd tried to call him by Uncle at first, but that just didn't fit. Sam was the one who never gave up on him, even when Dean and Cas did. Sam never had to be convinced that Jack wasn't evil, he'd believed it all along. He knew how hard it was to recoup after being separated from your soul, and was gentle on him when he needed it. These were the things that made Jack realize Sam was yet another one of his fathers.
"It's all yours." Sam seemed happy as Jack tore into it.
Cas slipped on some swim trunks and Dean taught Cas about the bottles as he made sure to really scrub the shampoo deep into his hair to get him all clean.
"Dean." Cas was frowing. "I must..relieve myself."
"I can't lie to you and tell you it's painless," Castiel began in a low rumble. "Of course it is. I say this because you'll have your own scars to bear one day, Jack. You already have many."
The first sore, reddish and irritated skin that had started to peel away in a circle to reveal the tender skin underneath, like a blister that had been torn off. It was on the side of his face just above his left eyebrow.
"Mmm. Vat's Goov." He said with a full mouth, and Dean clapped him on the back. "Keep up the good work, kid."
!" At this point, the babies called everybody daddy.
"Alright. Good enough for me. I'm gonna hit the sack... do what you said. G'night, Sammy."
Cas spoke to him through his newly replenished grace.
"Coming!" Jack blurted, snatched up his journal, and started to sprint over to him.
loved him.
Jack leapt up, happy to be dismissed after a long but rewarding day. Then stopped and looked expectantly at Sam for the magic words.
"Well, that's ominous!" Dean barked. "Is Cas okay, or not?"
"I hope you're not mad that the last angels ever are being raised by, well,
Calcifer looked happy as Io easily snuggled into him, her cheek squished to his shoulder.
Quickly
"Dean, do you really want to leave me alone with your boyfriend?"
Cas had been wondering the same thing. "Probably not. They might be able to conceal them in time, learning to pull them into another dimension unpercieved by humans."
Castiel smeared his hand over the side of the lump of ash, and the silver handle of the car door very dimly shone back at him, covered in grime. The door groaned and then squealed in protest as the angel wrenched it open. Jet black ash broke into several tiny waterfalls from where it had layered about half a foot deep on the roof of the car, streaming down to form tiny mounds on the ground before trickling to a stop.
"You wouldn't have to if you just put Nair in my shampoo again," Sam joked, but his voice was strained. Dean let out a huff of air, a sad excuse for a laugh, and dampened a different rag in a little bowl of water by his bedside, pushing aside those long brown hairs again and dabbing his forehead, clearing away the sweat that was beading on his cheeks and nose and chin.
"I know you a hell of a lot better than you think I would." Tobias spoke up. "In the future, expect me to visit you a lot. I was named after you, you know." The young archangel cleared his throat. "Go back to the roadhouse. Everyone will be there, including me and my siblings. We start planning at oh five hundred."
, really took his time until Dean was fully ready. He was the only person Dean trusted enough to do this.That first time he'd had him inside, Dean knew he could never go back.
Tobias's eyes grew sad. He clasped his hands together on the table. "Do you.." He licked his lips. "Bobby, do you have any idea what happened?"
Dean groaned audibly and curled said hand into a fist and shoved it into his pocket, embarrassed.
Finally, shuffling noises came on and Calcifer was speaking into the phone once again. "Yeah, he's breathing."
"Okay, okay." Dean laughed, and his laughter turned into small wheezes. "I kinda just wanted to see what you'd come up with." He licked his chapped lips and extended his hand, his palm opened, to the end of the bed. Chuck took it and squeezed softly, bringing it to his lips and giving a soft kiss to the back of it. Wait,
Who the hell was he kidding with this?! The makeup clashed with the crows-feet wrinkles near his green eyes, the weathered spots on his skin dotted amongst his freckles. He was an older man, not some teen girl. He felt stupid, and the beauty product seemed to have the opposite effect as he felt even uglier than before. How was that possible? He felt like a fucking faggot, he thought. His teenage self that never got this kind of experimentation resurfaced in a split second.
him?" Cas yelled hoarsely. "He killed infants from my family! He's killed others!
"Uh..the angels here..they're acting a little, hm, I guess
Leo laughed wetly, dabbing at his eye. "I'm not jealous of six. I can barely keep two in check, Bobby."
Dean knew he had a point. But they couldn't just let the guy go, right? What if he reverted to be a full-blooded demon? It was
Castiel pulled away, his one arm on Dean's shoulder and the other carefully on his neck, making sure not to touch the painful wound underneath its wrappings. He simply watched, unblinking, as tears fell from Dean's quickly reddening eyes.
"A bad guy did this to dad?" Leo asked quietly. "A bad guy hurt him?" Cas was still very much silent.
Sam smirked to himself.
Dean saw the egg. He was suddenly struck with a silly comparison to Humpty-Dumpty.
"Out front looks great." Sam pointed out. "I didn't notice all those flowers before."
Chuck ran a hand through his hair. "Uh...I couldn't say no? I just can't turn them away, Dean, I'm sorry."
"Dammit." Dean growled as he gently touched one of the thick scabs, earning a sharp intake of breath from Castiel. He dipped a cup into the bathwater and brought it up to the man's soapy hair. "Close your eyes. Tight, Cas."
"Sorry, little monster. You got white ones, and remember the saying?" Dean prompted, lifting an eyebrow.
The brothers waited on the porch, watching as Cas talked to Chuck sitting at that wrought iron table in the middle of his backyard-turned-garden.
Calcifer played cards with some of the other angels, they were betting with one of the little crafts they'd started; round and polished river stones that they'd painted on, colorful stripes or swirls or little smiling faces or clouds or polka-dots. Calcifer dragged the stones toward him like poker chips and threw the winning cards in the air in triumph. Angels brushed their teeth, knocking elbows with each other (and apologizing), pulled on comfy pajamas and racing to try and earn a spot next to Chuck, leaving the whole downstairs room with wall-to-wall mattresses unoccupied. They were funny like that.
." Dean felt a grip of panic seize him as his prediction had come true. He gingerly pressed the pad of his finger to the sore, and it smarted badly. "No, no, this can't be happening-" He met his panicked green eyes in the reflection. If he expelled Cas, the angel could die. Castiel was still too weak from when his own vessel had been destroyed, he was still gradually reclaiming his abilities. And if he was expelled from Dean's body, he could be brought somewhere very dangerous where the enemy angels in heaven would tear him to shreds. Dean wasn't about to let that happen.
you," Dean huffed irritably. He figured all this pain was factoring into his less-than-pleasant mood: his arm that used to have the Mark still burned, and Dean wondered why Cas had let him have it in such an uncomfortable, twisted position while he slept.
Tobias smiled, shrugging his broad shoulders. "Nope, just a routine visit. I promise."
"I don't mind the walk." He replied quietly, keeping his eyes straight ahead and downcast. Then, he stopped dead in his tracks, his head bowed.
Did I want to eat them? Obviously not (maybe just a little nibble to see if they still had the power like when they'd been unborn, but nothing more than that, really. I was just curious).
He picked his way through the room on any open carpet spots he could, careful not to step on any of the angels fast asleep on the floor. He bit back a sound of surprise as he felt someone's fingers curl around his ankle. He whipped his head back and saw an angel, a man who appeared around eighteen or nineteen, his eyes open and glassy with sleep.
Dean needed reassurance, comfort,
Dean waited with Kevin in the living room. He saw Chuck wander through the house, just in the short distance be confronted by several concerned angels. Chuck moved through the house, finally sitting on the back porch swing. And he was looking out at his, it was true, massively over gardened backyard. He was still sitting there when they had to leave.
Dean frowned a little. "Oh. I guess that's too bad then, huh?" He wished he could help, he felt bad that Cas was so worn out all the time now.
Cas paused for a split milisecond when he heard that title. Castiel Winchester. He remembered on the roof, when Dean said he was family now. He considered putting the silver shard down and letting himself open that door.
Dean looked away and chuckled. "You know what, never mind. Sammy's probably better off teaching you this stuff so you don't wind up a pig like me."
"Fine. I'll bring around your dinner in a few hours." Dean grunted, trying to sound as unsympatheic as possible as he picked up a few plates leftover from other meals. "I'll leave this open a crack, to hear you only if the demons get closer, and that information only, got it? And don't even think about banging your hands again." Dean scowled, trying to sound threatening.
"He will have them come in two seperate times?" Cas aked nervously. "Like Gabriel?"
Dean shrugged. "You know, I thought it be a lot more...I don't know,
"I've been injured." Cas began quietly, hanging his head as if it were something to be ashamed of. "I can't fly anymore. My own healing is slow, and I can barely heal others with my grace. I'm hardly of any use to Sam and Dea-"
"You'll get the hang of it." Dean tried to reassure him. "You'll get the hang of a lot of this- being human stuff."
Dean groaned and ran a hand down his face. It had been close to twenty minutes and they hadn't even gotten halfway through the list. "Babies...can't control their bodies like grown ups can. They wear that so food waste doesn't go everywhere, alright?"
"Well, enough about me." Chuck cleared his throat. "How are the little ones at your house?"
"Why are you so pissed off all the sudden?" Dean demanded. "If you want them to have toys, fine. We'll get them toys. Why are you so angry about it?"
, didn't you?! Oh my..g-aha
"You're nervous?" Dean asked, feeling a little awkward as he poured on a little more pancake batter. He never was very good about talking about stuff like this.
Bobby was pulling the young man into a hug before he could even react. Tobias quickly reciprocated, wrapping his arms around his back and shutting his eyes.
"Dean, please. This position—" The angel's voice was strained. "I dislike it. I want to see you. Look into your eyes."
“Our son,” Cas repeated with such conviction that Dean shivered and gasped quietly. It was a statement that refused to be countered in any way. “Is a boy with immeasurable power. And there is no better person to help him use that power for good, to make sure it doesn’t corrupt him, than you, Dean.”
"Yeah. Like how baby birds have to fight themselves out, or they'd be too weak." Kevin piped up. "At least, I think. I was kind of more of a nose-in-a-book kid anyway."
"Friend, that's not gonna cut it." Dean took a deep breath. "You're the one who pulled me from
It really freaked Dean out that one day he noticed
"Fine." Cas replied bitterly.
Cas hurried back to the car, keeping the camera in the bag but he stuffed the pain pills deep into his pocket. He waited for a few more minutes before Dean came back to the car, and he indicated for him to get out as he waggled his eyebrows.
Cas yawned. "I'm not quite sure about him yet."
Castiel was holding something in his lap, something that Jack had been gifted that very morning. Castiel was drawing Dean's sleeping figure in the same sketchbook that Jack had been using for his lesson.
best that they get his wings checked out.
"Cas says he's really sorry he got puke on your favorite jacket." Dean recognized Chuck's voice immediately. "He also wants to tell you that's he's okay."
," Cas hissed back. "And he would know how to open his soul for the fledglings to consume his energy."
"Get out of here, Cas." Dean groaned. "Just leave me the fuck alone."
Dean wrenched open the car door, wheezing as he lifted (or attempted to lift) Sam into the backseat. Sam coughed and tried to speak up again. "Falling...C-Cas.."
"You lost conciousness. I brought you here." Chuck said, his eyebrows drawing together in concern. "Chuck is also a vessel to a powerful angel whom I won't disclose right now. He took me in. Temporarily."
"You did nothing wrong, remember that. Night, kiddo."
"It's alright, Jack." Cas gave him a gentle smile, folding crow's feet around his kind eyes. "I promise. Focus on your true form, like I've taught you. Instinct will guide the rest."
Bobby pulled away. "Now, don't be callin' me grandpa, boy. I'm in my fourties now." He said gruffly, and he looked Tobias up and down. "How in the hell you get here, anyway? You better not be dead. I'll kill you again right now if you pulled that on your father, whichever one it was."
"Hey!" Dean blinked a few times from the bright flash. "What are you doing?"
His throat was close to being scrubbed raw for screaming his name. His full name, his true name.
"C'mon, Cas. It's almost eleven in the morning. Time to rise and shine." Dean nudged his shoulder again. "I promised I'd clean those cuts today, remember?" This earned an even more annoyed groan, and Dean laughed.
So I at least knew there were two, the redhead and this one.
Dean they're so hungry and its my fault he's so tiny and what am I going to do if he starves to death Dean I don't want my babies to die and I'm killing them I'm hurting them just like my other family and they're starving and I-"
He swallowed back that tight feeling in the back of his throat. His hand slid from his shoulder to gently cup the nape of his neck, and Cas felt a soft warmth in his stomach at the brush of his slightly calloused fingers, resting there so warm on the back of his neck in such an intimate gesture. Cas swallowed and met Dean's eyes, a flutter briefly in his stomach at the way he was looking at him, concerned. Like he cared, really cared.
The phone crackled for a little, and the voice sounded faraway. "...Dean? H-...lo? Is this Dean?"
He wasn't going to be a homeless, broken and depressed human with a heavy burden on him anymore, he didn't need to rely on Dean anymore. He could more than easily handle the little rugrats himself, and haul them all away and back to heaven to raise them there in a moment's notice. He would be able to fly, heal, fight and leave Dean without even a trace. Dean felt anxiety and worry envelop him.
Cas grinned and rubbed the little orange cat's chin, and she pinched her eyes shut and purred louder. "That's because the flowers weren't here before. My angels, well...they like to garden." Chuck said with a tiny smile.
angel, especially the majority of heaven's occupants were involved? He pulled on his coat, kissed Karen goodbye, grabbed his trusty sawed-off and slung it over his back, and made his way to Heaven's roadhouse.
And when Sam ran the rest of the errands with him, the question about a change in ownership just kept itching at the back of his mind.
"NIGHT, JACK." Dean called through the door. Jack just squished his face deeply into his pillow and didn't respond.
"Let go, papa! I want to go play!" Leo whined. "He said he was going to tell me secrets about the future!"
"Wow, you're taking this well." Dean looked confused.
"Hey, no problem." Dean said gruffly. "And I'll go and get you some painkillers, kay?"
"Yeah, Lee. A really bad guy." Dean replied. He locked his jaw, his hands twitching into fists for a second. "His name was Metatron. Remember that name."
Dean was speechless, and he let out a few strangled sounds that were barely words. Frusterated at himself for his inability to say anything, he rushed forward and planted a soft kiss on Cas's lips, taking the sides his face in his palms.
s. Dean thought.
Dean strengthened his stance and kept his arms tightly crossed. "Try me."
While Castiel was gone, Dean noticed there was blood in his mouth after he coughed. There was blood in the toilet water, too, but he couldn't tell from which end. It could have been both. When Dean's stomach finally was settled enough to look in the mirror and splash cool water on his clammy face, that's when he noticed it.
Dean sighed and put his hand on his shoulder. "
"Oh, I'm dead serious." Crowley said back casually. "Us demons haven't consumed an angel egg in eons. Heaven always kept them so far out of reach, so inconvient. Angels are really so powerful, and to consume them while they are nothing but pure energy- makes a demon almost unstoppable."
The egg was basketball-sized, a pure, heavenly white shell that contained something that was possibly the most valuable thing in the universe as of now, the untouched grace of an angel child.
, did you?"
"Come here, Leoniel." Cas beckoned, spreading his arms out wide. "Come crawl."
Cas shook his head slightly. "Not...exactly. My grace is all there, it just feels...strange. It's being repressed." Cas didn't look any less worried. "Dean, some of this Darkness was still within you when I found you. That's why I put you into this room instead of your own bedroom. It's still inside of you, and I..." The angel finally seemed to break, digging his the bottoms of his palms into his eyes as he sat back down into the chair angled next to Dean's bed. "I'm at a loss, Dean. I don't have all the answers. I've

. Just leave me be. Get
They were both like green bananas when they first started this. Dean topping, always giving. Back then, Cas had never had sex before, and Dean was more than happy to take the lead to teach him. But really, Castiel was the one teaching
"Sorry for being a jerk. I don't..." He let out a big, nervous breath. Here came the confession. "I don't really mind, uh, sharing with you."
He was in the pajamas Cas liked the most on him because it matched his eyes, a cerulean footsie with tiny white sailboats, and he was sitting on a soft yellow blanket. The baby stared up at Cas with wide eyes, chewing on his balled up fist absent-mindedly. He was sitting up on his own, but wasn't showing any signs of wanting to crawl, unlike his brothers and sister who had been off like rockets.
"You know, maybe." Sam joked, and Chuck finally lowered his hands completely from his face.
It crossed Dean's mind to kill him. Crowley had killed plenty of the people he cared about. But he just couldn't find it in him to do that.
"These hands are too small to be Cas's," Dean croaked, a small smile making its way onto his face. "But hey, I'll pretend anyway." He mustered a smile at Chuck and Chuck's hand softly curled around his fingers.
?" He broke into a smile. "You
Chuck's eyebrows drew together. "You look faint. Do you need some water?"
"Cas!" Dean exclaimed, jumping up. "Oh my god, you-"
, you know?" He sighed and closed his eyes.
Sam snorted a little and gave Dean a bitch face, finally ducking out of the room to go find the grumpy ex-angel.
You tilted your head and waited for him to continue.
You tried not to focus too much on how foreign it felt to have someone telekinetically rearrange your cells, but it was hard. You tried to not let Cas heal you whenever it could be avoided, but right now it was unlikely he would let you opt out.
“Come, let me fix your back.” Castiel offered, reaching out to him. Dean raised a hand to stop him, and Castiel frowned.
You glanced up at the voice and saw Lucifer standing in the doorway in all his glory. Glory being a worn, light brown jacket with a dirty blue tee-shirt and jeans. You gave him a look and gestured at the computer and piles of books and papers in front of you.
I don't claim to know how head trauma feels, so take this with a grain or 2 of salt.
“Not how I pictured getting between your legs, [Y/N].” He quipped as he followed his orders. You lightly smacked his shoulder.
“Looks great.” He announced.
“[Y/N], hey, can you hear me? Can you feel my hand?” A voice pleaded. It sounded like you were underwater, miles away from the source. You tried to process what they were saying, but you were struggling. You tried to open your eyes, and were met with bright light, and the silhouette of a man above you.
“Wait, hold on. That doesn’t make any sense. I started to see wings after Lucifer and I went on that hunt in New York, when I woke up on a cot back here after I got knocked into a wall. Lucifer wasn’t even in the room when I came to! It was just us, and, no offense, Cas, but I don’t think we’re meant to be.” You argued back.
“These clothes smell like Dean, it’s gross.” He said, grabbing your pillow and burying his head into it.
‘If I have a concussion, I’m gonna be so pissed. If I live.’ You scoffed to yourself. You strained to try and catch a glimpse of Lucifer or the grandson, but nothing seemed to be moving.
Lucifer could handle the ghost, not like it could kill him, anyways.
You ripped back the curtain and knocked the clock to the floor, smashing it open with one hard stomp. You quickly sparked the lighter, and, just before you could drop it into the center of the heirloom, a wall of wind threw you into, and through, the pane of glass behind you.
“Small town. Small house. Small minds. Neighbors were polite, but everyone kept to themselves. Like they were paranoid. Of course, plenty of them were doping, so…I guess they had reason to be.” You looked at him and gauged a reaction. You waited for that sympathetic, watching-an-ASPCA-commercial face. Thankfully, it never came.
The air was heavy with tension. Lucifer looked like he wanted to say something but couldn’t. You sat in the awkwardness, together, for a moment, before he stood up and left. He thanked you for your help, and you nodded back as he closed the door.
He grabbed the remote and switched on the TV, turning the channel until he found the nights football game. The home team was down by 3, but they were only halfway into the game, so there was plenty of time to rectify the score. He settled into his seat and let the day wash out of his mind. The sound of Cas’s game playing softly in the background contrasted the gruff narration of every move and throw on the flatscreen. They hardly noticed the other’s noise, however, as both were too involved in their respective leisure.
You laughed at his answer.
’s from his keyboard as he explored the realm in front of him. Jack smiled from the other side of the phone.
“Hey, uh…” He started, hesitating with his words, “You don’t mind?”
You reached into your pocket and grabbed your wallet. Sam looked at your quizzically as you pulled out a 20$ bill and sat it on the table in front of him.
“I’m sure he told him everything, but you know how Dean is. He probably had the same reaction toward Cas telling him that you did about Lucifer.” He shot you a sly look.
“So? Am I dying?” You asked, only half joking.
You took a second to give his wings a full look, and they seemed much better. Still a bit dusty, but not much could be done about that, outside of a shower. Or a handheld vacuum.
“No! Gross! I meant, like, sit on the floor, facing the wall, crisscross applesauce, so I can help get all the crap out of your wings. You’re so nasty.” You chastised. He was visibly disappointed, but he did what he was told.
“Once again, close, but no cigar. Think bigger.” Lucifer took a few steps forward, filing the space that was emptied.
“What does it mean, that I can see wings? I asked Lucifer, earlier, and he ran away.” You started, “Well. He flew away. But you know what I mean. He was acting weird about it, too. I tried to dig into what it could mean and find out myself but the only information I found is in some localized offshoot of Latin, which, we both know,” He leaned forward, trying to keep up as you nervously rambled, “is already a dead language! And it was only about a paragraph of information, anyways. And it’s freaking me out a bit so you have to tell me or I’ll probably die.”
“Dammit!” You exclaimed, “I owe Sam 20 fucking dollars!”
Sam and Jack thudded down the steps, safely, without falling, and waltzed into the living room, talking and laughing with the other as they did.
Castiel raised his hand and snapped his fingers, disappearing the mess around them. Dean shrugged, satisfied with at least one half of the problem being gone.
“I thought you were getting carryout?” Sam mused as he leaned against the doorframe.
You shifted all your focus on his wings, and it was needed. They were a mess.
He paused for a second, thinking about what you could alluding to. Then, his eyes light up in recognition.
You reached over and pulled the plug on the tub, giving him one final rinse before turning the water off and instructing him to stand up. You handed him the towel and watched as he dried his hair and wrapped the towel around his torso.
“Nah, nothing. I’m guessing you haven’t got anything, either?” You walked past him and flopped down in an office chair that was facing a desk full of books and papers. You pulled one of the books towards you and inspected the cover. It was illustrated with various birds: cardinals, blue jays, doves, hummingbirds, and a few you didn’t recognize. The title read “The Great Fowl of North America.” You pulled one of the drawers open and peered inside. A pair of binoculars, a few more books, a pile of blank printer paper, some tan files, and a stapler. You shut the drawer.
“What’cha doin’, Cas?” He asked genuinely. There was a short list of things on this Earth that Dean truly cared about, and near the top was anything surrounding the trenchcoat angel with the softest brown eyes and the sweetest smile on Heaven, Hell, or otherwise.
The boys all settled into their usual spots as Dean pressed play. Sam and Jack had their own respective recliners, while Dean and Castiel shared the loveseat.
You went into the kitchen and found the entrance to the garage. The door creaked as it opened, and you spied a bottle of WD-40 sitting on the ground only a toss away. You smiled to yourself, and pulled out the device and flicked it on, scanning anything you could think of, anything that might’ve been sentimental.
“The history of cereal is
“Sh sh sh sh sh,” Dean hushed, grabbing the remote and turning up the volume, clutching his beer like a stress ball. Sam sighed and crossed his arms over his chest. He never had gotten into football like Dean had, but, of course, it was another one of the things that he and John had shared in the past, so it made sense. Like his car, Dean held tightly to his Dad’s old favorites, while Sam chose a little more distance.
“What’d you do to your back, man? Cas forget to take it easy on you?” Sam teased, never missing an opportunity to bully his brother.
At the bunker, Castiel returned his phone to one of the many pockets he had in one of the many layers he decorated his vessel with. He was just getting back into his rhythm when the loud, heavy bang of the bunker’s reinforced steel door alerted him to Dean being home. He closed the laptop and sat it on the table in front of him, standing to assist Dean with setting up dinner. He had hardly made it to the front room when he heard Dean yell.
“What? How else am I supposed to get dry?” He asked as you turned to leave.
“How could anyone possibly mess up a sandwich,” He started, but quickly continued as he saw Sam open his mouth to respond. “Don’t answer that.” Sam pursed his lips, looking at the charcoal pizza pointedly.
quite relaxing.” Castiel admitted into his phone, which was cradled in between his cheek and his shoulder. His fingers coaxed out
“Yeah.” He said.
“Maybe it’s the house he’s here for? There were pictures on the staircase, could’ve been a family home.” He pointed out. You raised an eyebrow.
,” he shot you a suggestive look, “and, when you got back, you could.”
“Just trust me, I know what soulmates look like, and, I’m telling you, this is what it looks like.” He insisted, still refusing to look at you.
“It’s a haunted bill and you need me to burn it.”
You took one of his wings in your hand, holding it up above the rest of the wings and splaying out the feathers, double checking for missed debris.
“I think the flower might have the potential to aggravate werewolves. Maybe even some other monsters. I was looking into the lore for what I could find.” You pushed the computer back and pulled forward a dusty green and brown book. The cover was decorated with crude illustrations of various herbs.
You tried again, “I think the only step up from that is a section on the Dr. Phil show.”
The movie hadn’t played more than 20 minutes into the movie before Dean was fast asleep. Cas listened to the man’s heart beating steadily in his chest, breathing in unison with Dean. Feeling the rise and fall of his chest. He looked up at the man. His face was so soft and peaceful when he was asleep.
Sam held out his hand towards Jack, who got the signal and handed Sam the phone.
Lucifer shrugged, reaching behind him to scratch his back. More specifically, his wings. He dug his fingers into the white, thick feathers and relieved the itch that was there. His wings were large, poking out past his shoulders and sides despite being laid in rest against his back. When you had first seen them, you thought there might be something wrong with your eyes, as they appeared to glow. It took a bit of adjustment to get used to the way they seemed to shine. In the outside light, when the sun hit them in certain sections, the white feathers suddenly held specks of color. Pink, red, orange, blue. They were distractingly beautiful. Out of all the ranks of heaven: angels, archangels, nephilim, Lucifer’s wings were your favorite.
“I must admit, this game
“Alright.” You instructed, slamming the car door shut. “Let’s get in, get out, and stay quiet. It looks like the neighbors are home, and I don’t feel like jumping out of a locked window to avoid police. Again.” You darted your eyes, checking for witnesses before speed-walking up the driveway to the front door.
“No, what? You can see wings? Hold on, you can
“How’re you feeling? Can you say something for me?”
“What? Ew, gross.” He screwed up his face in disgust, “Wait, so you’ve been able to see for *months* and you didn’t tell me?”
“You’ve got wings, Cas. Jet black and huge.” You admitted.
boring.” He said, pointedly.
“No, just don’t feel like dealing with anymore humans tonight.” He grumbled under his breath. “Just. Try to take a nap, or something. Save your energy.”
"We should try for just a couple more hours," Dean replied, suddenly realizing how tired he was. "We can both hit the gun range tomorrow morning."
"Shhh." Dean forced him to shut up, pressing a hand hard to his shoulder and cradling the very confused baby in his other arm, Leo reached up and began to play with Dean's earlobe with his sticky palm.
?!" Calcifer yelled over the running water.
“That’s it,” Cas began those signature gentle strokes of his, the ones that Dean wet-dreamed about ever since he’d experienced them. “Let me bring you pleasure— take care of my human.”
"So, he's still not talking?" Dean asked Sam, who shook his head. It was after dinner that same night, the newly human angel hadn't said one word to anybody at all.
"Sorry," Dean mumbled, laughing a little and squeezing his hands back. He raised his eyes and looked into his face.
Kevin looked nervous. "Uh...Cas...it's not much of an egg anymore."
He asked innocently, as if nothing had ever happened, and the veil was completely back to normal.
The most ironic part is I'm the closest to being human as I have been in centuries and they're treating me shittier than I when I was even a demon.
"He is not a stranger. And my babies need his energy, Dean. Please." His eyes were boring into him. "He deserves a home. He is-
"I have been doing a lot of thinking. About how the fledglings must consume energy. And if there is a demon in the house-" He held the redheaded baby just a little tighter and pressed his lips together in a tiny frown.
"Well, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do." Dean huffed and zipped back up.
"I know. Shirts are tricky." Dean tugged a little roughly downward and his dark head of hair popped out of the neckhole, quickly followed by his head. Cas's eyes were downcast, his cheeks tinging with pink. He was embarrased, and he quickly reached and tucked the egg securely into his hands once more, hugging it as if for comfort.
He continued to frown a little. "'Kay." He said quietly, his mouth peeking open just a little. Dean gave him anything he could think of, really. Iron supplements (I mean, he lost quite a lot of blood injecting into Crowley, right?), One-a-day Men's, some painkillers, Vitamin D (who knew what causes scurvy?).
"What's this, Dad?" Tobias asked, his voice gentle. Cas didn't mind the title so much when it came from his lips in such a loving, casual way.
"What makes you so sure there are only three?" Cas asked, lifting an eyebrow.
Dean sighed. "There's no easy way to say this, Cas, but...uh, we found out that Chuck is God. He just didn't know it."
? A friggin'
to protect them. I don't know if there are any more angels out there, and if I fail...maybe there never will be."
Cas stepped out of the car, confused. He tilted his head to the side a little. "What is it?"
Castiel brought him down to the center of his chest, where grace had started to leak from a singular opening, unlike humans, a flawed secondary batch of God's creatures who were created with two.
Calcifer didn't respond. His jaw had dropped and his mouth was hanging slightly open, his face had drained of blood and had gone pale.
Chuck wrote as he'd never written before. He barely had time to smooth over his little ginger cat's fur as she headbutted him once again, begging for attention. Chuck's hands flew across the keyboard.
Dean frowned. "You are
Tobias looked nervous. "What were we supposed to do? There's only five angels in existence right now, and Metatron's one of them." Bobby was surprised when the young man shot out his hand and gripped Bobby's wrist.
Cas already felt the small angels beginning to pull from his energy to feed themselves, seeing earthly food would do nothing for their growth. He was able to manipulate his soul in a way the humans didn't know how, opening it up and letting them take anything they needed without barriers.
Dean narrowed his eyes. "Cas. Look at me." Castiel hesitantly met his jade green eyes.
Dean faced Cas and wore a tiny smile on his lips. "G'night." He said again. "Y'know, I'm probably never going to get tired of that." And with that, his eyes were closed, leaving Cas to count freckles. As the angel waited, he resorted to counting those slightly blonde-tipped eyelashes that would flutter slightly every now and then.
Cas mustered up a painful smile that vanished quickly. "Thank you."
"Yeah." Dean coughed.
?" Calcifer finally was able to get his lips to form a comprehensible word.
Dean blinked. "Well, that escalated quickly.."
Dean didn't say another word, simply got to work. He placed Castiel's limp hand over his shoulder and held it there, slipping in beside him on the armchair. Dean's nose buried into the dark curls just above the angel's ear and he whispered something into it, he snapped his eyes shut as the handprint-shaped brand on his shoulder began to emit the softest glow.
"Boo."
"Here, Cas." Dean was the only one who came into the room this time. He was carrying the egg, which had a collapsed top but a very faint tapping could still be heard. "I...everyone else is eating dinner, but Kev brought you some soup if you want. I can take those little buggers so you can get some sleep."
Dean barely acknowledged that, tilting his ear subtly toward him, not even giving out a grunt like he usually did. He seemed frozen in place— Jack realized he could count on one hand how many times he’d called him that.
Cas bit down on his teeth. "I do not wish to look at him right now." He turned away slightly to protect the egg.
Cas shadowed Dean as he snaked his way through the room, heading down to the demon dungeon where he kept him.
"Chuck?" Cas reached out and helped steady him by the shoulder, as it looked like he were about to fall over.
!" Dean yelped. "We have boundaries, remember?"
"You're so gorgeous," The angel breathed as he finally stood before him, Dean seated at the edge of their bed. Dean looked up the distance and the angel slipped his cheek into his palm, skimming his bottom lip with his thumb. Dean let his plush lips open slowly, teasing the fingertip with a soft amount of wet suction. His lids fluttered shut, a sudden pang of intense shame passed through him. He felt like he was acting exactly like what his dad had always warned him against.
"Yes, yes. They're all dears. I'm sure I'll be fine here, you take care of those little angels and I'll watch over these fallen ones, okay? And if you find any more, you'll know just where to send 'em." Chuck stood up, all five foot eight of him, the blanket still around his shoulders like a little kid huddling up in the cold.
Cas smiled. "I explained to you that your thoughts are very loud sometimes, haven't I?" Dean said nothing. This might be harder than he originally thought.
"I have reason to believe God is not hiding." Cas confessed. "The amulet would only glow hot in the presence of God's grace. But I believe God may not be in possession of his grace currently. My most reasonable explaination was that God, as an angel himself, fell some time ago."
"Not Dean." Castiel said gruffly, leaning heavily on the railing of the steps. "He's unconcious. I brought us-um,
I offered to give them some tips, I mean, I'd had a son back when I was human. I was shut down right when the words left my mouth.
"Don't be sorry, Cas. I get that you were freaked out about him hurting the egg." Dean tightened his fingers on the steering wheel. God, why in the hell was he even defending Crowley? Why couldn't he just throw him back into the world?
"Crap," Sam sucked in a breath and rubbed at his eyes, pushing his hair back and away from his face. "I guess time got away from us."
Dean pressed his lips together in thought. "Well, I don't want to have to redo all that. And the cuts might sting if it has water pressure on it. I'll just run a bath." He decided, and indicated for Cas to hop up off the edge of the tub so he could reach the knobs.
"So you don't believe it?" Kevin was the one who spoke up this time.
Dean scoffed. "Oh, Bah humbug, you goddamn wet blanket. Just put it on."
Cas was silent the whole time Dean dabbed at the lacerations with the peroxide-soaked cotton ball, he could feel it bubbling and tickling under his fingernails, and he didn't even want to imagine how it felt for Cas as white foam suddenly fizzed out from the red. Cas did take a few more swigs from the flask, and Dean smirked as he saw a bit of red in a splotchy pattern beginning to spread on his cheeks and on his temples.
"He didn't crawl he's never going to learn I'm being a horrible father and they're
He just hoped they didn't run into any more hobo angels anytime soon. That had been
"Okay, guys." Dean began to round up the two of them, who let out little 'aww's of protest. "Time to let your brother rest."
He hugged him closer and the kid shuddered in a breath. "Daddy? Is it over?"
"It's just a nickname, Cas. You'll see." Kevin was the one who hopped up this time, leaving Dean and Cas alone.
A double rap came on Jack's door.
"Thanks." Kevin shot out, taking the half of the sandwich with one hand as he still scribbled with the other, his eyes not leaving the papers. He took a large bite, his eyes still scanning the reciept paper, he seemed like he was making sense of the jumbled numbers and codes.
Red very gently hugged Bobby and pulled away. "I tried to make a surprise for you 'cuz I made my wings brown like yours but Daddy made me clean 'em off so they're not brown anymore."'
This was what a blush was? God, whoever thought blushing was cute should see it like
What could possibly go wrong with this situation?
"Well, shit." Dean ran his hands through his hair. He was interrupted from saying more as the door banged open behind him. Calcifer was grinning, wearing nothing but a pair of Sam's plaid boxers that were quite baggy on him. His blonde hair fell in wet curls.
Cas tilted his head to the side. "Commando...?"
from, dada?" Leo ran a tiny finger over Cas's pink and puckered wing-scars, and Cas visibly shivered at the touch.
Dean felt that strange lick of jealousy again and cleared his throat. "Well, Cal, it was nice that you could help us out, but we've got somewhere else for you to go after you're done feeding the kids. A friend named Chuck is taking in angels, he offered to give you a place to stay."
A bee buzzed by Chuck's ear. The man smiled softly and looked at Cas.
"Huh." Dean nodded, a
"I apologize," He said, his voice rumbling grumpily. "But I have to do this."
?" She yelped, climbing off of Dean and cradeling her stinging face. Dean struggled to keep the massive things in check as they flapped drunkenly, he winced as they bumped the bedpost, feeling like hitting a funny bone but even worse.
"He's my
It was a horrible selfie, just the very corner had part of Cas's face, he had this squinty-eyed expression on, as if he were confused. The bright white egg was in its little black carrier, and his arm was obscuring most of the photo. A little arrow was pointing to the tiny bit of Cas in the picture, and it had the title "Father." Then the caption said-"Dean got me this to carry you around easier."
"It was a mistake." Castiel answered. He felt water rush into his tear ducts. "Tobias-" His voice had started to waver. He still kept his head bowed, he felt so ashamed. The archangel quickly stood up.
"We don't need the spare bedroom for the fledglings. I'd rather share a room with them anyway, to keep them safe. Please." His begging eyes bored into Dean. "Dean, he's my brother."
"It can be hard work sometimes, Dean, I'm sorry." Cas explained, and kept his hands cradling Dean's cheeks and before moved them to his shoulders.
"Class dismissed," Sam said. He looked so happy when he said it, Jack didn't ever want to stop asking for the permission.
like to rest in my own bed right about now."
"Cas-" Dean tried to interject.
"Jesus," Dean sighed, covering his eyes with his palm. "And you said Sammy..."
"No." Cas explained. "Humans are blind to their own souls. They always have been. It takes a very long time for human ghosts to learn how to possess and manipulate, and they are purely made from soul substance. To learn in a
Cas tipped the shard to a different angle than the scissors he'd used the other day. His wrist was still purpling and little dotted scabs like tiny garnet gemstones still riddled in horizontal lines, like little equals signs all stacked up on each other.
Dean reasoned.
"Oh." Dean responded, not quite sure what else to say. "...It's a pretty name, Cas."
Cas hiccuped with a sob and didn't speak up for a second. "D-Dean..there's..something I need to.." He didn't finish his sentence before showing Dean. He pulled up the sleeves of the coat he was borrowing, revealing a criss-cross of vertical scabs and slits, blemishing his smooth, pale wrist.
"Don't worry about it, Cas. I used to bathe Sammy all the time when we were little, he was way less cooperative." Dean chuckled a little when he remembered how much Sammy used to splash around and whine and complain.
He listened as she hummed her tone-deaf songs as she cooked breakfast, today it was bacon. Yesterday it had been french toast. Karen really was the greatest cook.
"Please," The young woman begged in a whisper, tears free-falling from her eyes without needing to blink. "Don't kill me." She hugged around herself even tighter. Empty cans and wrappers were piled all around her from food consumed long ago.
"It's okay, Sammy. It's okay. I'm here, I'm gonna take you to the hospital."
"Do you want to..uh, clean up before lunch?"
“Just—“ Dean whispered.
Dean patted the car as he stepped out and closed the door. "Maybe we've just been getting cabin fever."
Dean rolled his eyes. "Fine. Let him finish eating, then throw him back." He led Cas to his room. "I'll lend you some clothes, Cas."
"That's right. That's something old Bobby told me a long time ago." Dean scooped him up and the angel squealed. "Dean! It's scary up here!" He giggled, kicking his legs and punching his arms into Dean's back. "Put me down!"
Cas simply hung his head, resting his chin on top of the egg. "I'm useless." He breathed, hugging the white egg close to his chest.
He ran a hand through his greasy hair. "I'm the only guy who can fix all of this, apparently, and I don't know where to even start. I have to save my children, and..."
"What? You don't like my singing?" Calcifer began to laugh light-heartedly, his hazel-golden eyes crinkling up at the corners. Dean decided maybe he wasn't that bad of a guy. Still, he was beyond relieved that Chuck offered to take the guy in.
"I know." Cas sighed and squeezed his eyes shut. Dean felt his anxiety and cold terror wash over him, and chills swept down his spine. That wasn't something the angel could fake.
Cas waited in the doorway, watching as Dean smiled and talked quietly to the baby angels, pulling the covers up over their shoulders and playfully squeezing their foot-lumps under the blankets, ruffling one boy's hair and kissing another's forehead. He was so good with his little ones, wasn't he? Cas felt such an all-encompassing feeling of
"You've been hungry," Sam kept the lethal smirk on his lips, standing up and towering over her. "Ravenous, even."
The family business.
"How?" Bobby asked simply.
"Cas?" Dean asked as he passed by. The ex-angels features were troubled. "Hey, you okay?"
"You really are, aren't you, holy sh..SAM!" He poked his head back in the house and gripped onto the doorframe as he leaned back into the house. "SAM! GOD'S STANDING ON OUR DOORSTEP!"
?" Sam and Dean said at the same time.
..." How could he have been so selfish? Why did he have to do that all before they were almost here?
! I'm nothing without Sam, he was gone too and you came for
Cas was crying. He wiped the tear with the back of his hand so it smeared on his cheek.
Dean grinned. "As long as you're feeling okay. Hell yeah, who doesn't want to be on a first name basis with the Man himself?"
Dean chuckled and brought the mug to his lips once again, Jack knew it was to hide a smile behind its rim. This dad of his could be funny like that.
"I love that you
Jack's had to hold back from talking much harder than before. He did have to admit he felt guilty not responding when Sam was always so sweet.
He tugged at the material, but only managed to get his arms up to elbows out of the holes. "...Dean?"
“Castiel Winchester.” Dean’s lips nudged the ridge of his ear, the angel’s breath caught beautifully in his throat as he emptied into Dean as the human held the back of his head close, tucked into his shoulder.
on any of my family member's heads, I will
"Sure." Dean turned away. "C'mon, Cas."
"I...thought it was nice." Cas filled in the silence for him, giving him a confused stare.
! Get back here!"
"I'm sorry, Cas. It's just...I've never dealt with an egg like this before." He straightened up and wiped his eyes. "Sorry I laughed at you."
"Dean?" Cas called out uncertainly, and Dean peeked open one eye to see the man hanging by the door, his hand perched on his knob, a dejected slump in his shoulder.
In most ways, they were easier to take care of than regular kids. They didn't cry much, only when things were really wrong. They didn't need diapers or food, which was nice. In some ways, it was harder.
Cas shook his head. "I want to talk with him."
We'd gotten halfway through dinner before I even knew why they'd finally pulled me out of that hellhole.
The angel felt a deep ache in his chest again. He rattled out a breath before he spoke up again. "Tall. Pure white skin, long arms and legs and long fingers. Long black hair and black opal eyes. I had a halo too, you know. And my wings were black."
Castiel dragged himself and Dean's body up the last few steps to the medical cabin, and weakly knocked on the door, clutching at his stomach. A woman opened the door, her dark brown eyes flying wide as she saw him. "Dean-!" She close to yelped.
He looked so peaceful sleeping- his dark hair was getting longer, Dean realized. Had it even grown when he'd been an angel? His hair was a bit wavier now that it was longer, it appeared more tousled. His corneas darted back and forth under the thin skin of his eyelids, his eyelashes fluttered against his cheeks. His curled fist was resting a few inches away from his cheek, and one of his knuckles twitched, something from his dream.
He was met with a blank, blue-eyed expression.
"I don't know if I should bow down or sit down." Dean laughed nervously. Chuck propped his head up with palm cradling his cheek.
"Hey, hon." Dean paused on the last step and halfway slung an arm around the angel, who leaned up for a peck in greeting.
fallen angel we find on the street back home with us." He hissed, his face very close to Cas's, his finger pointing and jabbing his chest lightly.
-week-
I already feel bad enough for myself, stewing in guilt. And what I said before, about deserving it.
Dean watched whilst propped against the doorway, obviously skeptical, but it didn't really seem like that whole thing was just for show. He wasn't even asking Dean to remove his handcuffs to dress his bloodied hands, a trick Dean thought he might try.
, that torturing souls was the only place that you felt
"Go to sleep, Cas." Dean said to the far wall. Sam was out there, and he needed their help. Dean tried to shove that thought aside and get some sleep. His missing arm burned again.
"Dean-!" Cas yelped, throwing an arm out and making the door slam shut telekinetically before he could reach it and escape.
Dean asked in embarrassment. But, there was no sign of him. Suddenly this empty feeling felt a lot less like liberation and more like loneliness.
The ex-angel frowned and pressed his lips together before nodding.
"No." He answered gruffly. "I..." He faded off, he didn't want to say.
"Bobby?" Leo asked groggily. "Hey, did you go and talk to grandpa?"
“It’s beautiful.” Jack whispered, his eyes folding shut, sandy blonde lashes fanning on his cheeks. “It makes me feel... safe.”
Dean groaned and rolled his eyes. "Like you were Mr. Clean a few weeks ago, guru." He retorted.
"Oh my God..you're God!" Dean deducted, a wide smile splitting his face. Chuck shifted his feet in embarrassment, a shy smile on his face.
"What are you talking about? Sorry for what?" Dean closed his eyes and took in a deep breath. The pain in his head was agonizing, throbbing against his temples. He already knew something didn't feel right.
"I got a little something. It's for Eggy." He smiled and took out the box. "Ta da! Want to try it on?"
Chuck carried the little boy and softly lay him onto his bed. The kid barely even stirred as he tucked him under the covers. Chuck lightly pulled on a wing that had flopped in an awkward position, readjusting it to be more comfortable. He sighed, trying to not think about all his children he had lost when he was gone. "They'll learn to conceal them very soon. It's almost a shame. They're so very pretty, aren't they?" Chuck asked distantly, softness in his voice. The brothers were convinced.
" He scanned the area, looking for anything that could signify the presence of the younger Winchester. He dipped his head into the bloody cave of the car, but it was empty. He looked for any human-sized lumps covered in ash, or signs of him getting out of the car and leaving...nothing. Not even a single footprint, unlike the deep trail of footprints the angel had made on his way to the buried vehicle. It was like he'd vanished into thin air. The angel couldn't feel him nearby, either.
"See you later, Chuck." They finally waved and set back home for the second time.
"There's room," Cas mumbled, his word partly obscured by his pillow.
"-It's the end of the world, Cas!" Dean huffed, interrupting him. "And we've been doing this whole 'sharing a body' thing way differently than other vessels and angels, okay, I know that. We've been doing a good job so far, I'll admit, but...
"Because I am one." Tobias answered, and suddenly the room was full of brown, his six stacked wings open and spread wide. Tobias grinned innocently as if to say 'see, grandpa? Nothing to worry about.' Too bad Bobby didn't see his expression. He crumpled to the floor like a puppet whose strings had been cut, in a dead faint.
"Holy shit." Dean breathed, rooted to the spot for a second. Cas looked mortified.
"Leave him alone." Dean shot back acidly, kicking the man's leg under the table. "He's learning."
Sam's lips twitched upward again. "Sorry to burst your bubble, kid." Sam said. His eyes were always so kind when they were on him, but they carried deep pools of hurt in them, always. "We're using something different today."
"Oh, I..sorry." Chuck looked up, snapping out of it. He looked embarrassed to be handling their kid like that without permission. "Do you mind?"
Bobby's face was in disbelief. "His
"Go find the Red Bulls, okay? Grab, like, four packs. You should be able to find it pretty easily." Dean indicated to the other direction. "I'm picking up some coffee beans. I'll be right over there if you need me."
Sam rolled his eyes. "You don't put
That put a warm feeling in Cas's chest. He bent his neck down and kissed the little forehead of one angel and then the other. Dean covered his mouth with his palm and tried to not let any of his very un-manly sounds leak out.
"I...don't know." Cas scrunched his face up in confusion. "I think...I fell asleep. I hit my head when I fell off the stepladder."
Cas looked away, fiddling with his camera nervously. "I do want to talk." He said huskily, his voice rumbling. "I just - I don't know what to say."
I'm going to finally put all of this up after a long break. Sorry to make you all wait so long! I hope you like the rest of this story :)
Bobby sniffled. "But I don't wanna be
Cas stiffened. "I was lost then." He said in a husky voice, clearly very angry he'd brought that up. He looked away and bit his lip, pausing for a second before speaking up again.
"I want you to be strong, Jack." Castiel finally spoke up. "If you let your grace go dormant, if you choose to live like a human... no one will be able to heal Sam and Dean when they need it. Fly them away from danger. Or... help me to heal my wings. So I can fly again."
Dean pressed his lips together. "Okay, Cas." He agreed quietly. "I'll...I'm gonna try."
"I know you don't want to deal with Dean right now. Just... I think checking in on Cas could help you feel better, too. Wait for Dean to fall asleep, it won't take long."
"You're starving,
Castiel rested his forehead in the crook of his arm, pressed to the cold steel of the door as he leaned against it defeatedly.
There was another small pause. "
And this wasn't necessarily the best thing.
She must have been one of the first to fall. Her grace had already dimmed enough from exposure to Earth for him to view it with his new human eyes, only leaving splotches of neon green behind his eyelids when he blinked.
Chuck smiled easily at him. "Of course. Glad you're alright, Dean."
"I'm sure we will." He reached over and squeezed her shoulder reassuringly, and picked up a little off his egg with his fingers and began to eat. He'd had a pretty respected position in heaven, so it wasn't hard to fall into the role of leader here either.
"Yeah, I know." Dean chuckled. And Cas looked.
“Dean?” Jack asked feebly, cracking open an eye to see Dean’s shadow tie something off, then a loud zipping as Dean crouched and came back into the two-person tent to sit by the entrance, and wrangle off his clunky hiking shoes that he called “trusty” and Jack called “stinky”.
Dean was freshly showered and in his comfiest pajama sweats and cotton tee when he padded barefoot into the Library. His brother and Jack both hunched over thick volumes at the long wooden table with green reading lamps. Jack's blonde head bobbed and snapped back up as he fought off his sleepiness. Sam was statuesque, barely even blinking as he robotically flipped a page.
His muddle of emotions was confusing him; he loved him in multiple ways as he respected him as an angel, loved him like a brother but also as something more. He wished he had that clear vision again if it would give him some understanding as to what he was feeling.
"Are you okay?" Red asked, concerned as he pouted out his lower lip.
“Wanna know what’s just as good as burgers?”
"Hey! Hey, Cas, you okay?" Dean rushed up and touched him on the shoulder. "
Jack must have been too excited by that prospect, because he took the largest breath in yet and immediately sensed that something was wrong. He snapped back into his human body, overpowered his instinct and was able to break away, the glowing mist abruptly stopped. Castiel was still in his sleeping state, despite Jack having left the plane.
Cas strode into the bathroom, his breath coming in quick bursts from his throat. He gripped his hair tight on the sides of his head, and saw the reflection in the mirror. His pupils were little pinpricks of black within a sea of terrified blue. His face had grown pale, his expression was tight and each panicked breath flared his nostrils.
"Oh, isn't he a sweet little thing!" Chuck said happily, poking the tiny fat cheeks and laughing at the surprised look on the little one's face. "Please, come in." He opened the door all the way and escorted them to the living room, where four angels had been sitting and talking amongst each other, empty cups of coffee on the dining room table.
It had been almost a month and a half of sharing a body, and that was when the first thing appeared.
Cas leaned over and folded him into a tight hug. Since neither had been raised human, it lingered for as long as both of them wanted. Jack let out a quiet gasp when he could sense it, the way Castiel's grace stirred, welling up closer to the surface for Jack to consume. Feeling it there within reach, his own grace plucked with a pang of hunger and he winced.
Dean smiled. "Yeah, I guess. Chuck, you big teddy bear, taking 'em all in like that."
"C'mere, we'll go to the kitchen. I'll fix you up something to eat." The dark-haired man hesitantly stumbled off the side of the bed and waited, his eyes boring into Dean. Dean felt extremely uncomfortable as he began to make his way to the kitchen, the mute man silently shadowing him.
"Chuck?" Dean rubbed his eye. He felt bandages all over his face, on his forehead and his temples and even one on his cheek just below his eye.
"So, can I go for a stiff drink now, or what?" Dean asked, his hand plopping down with a faint smack onto his thigh. "And maybe put on some actual clothes?"
He just hoped the ritual would still work if one of them were handcuffed.
"Cas, a little warning next time?" Dean huffed as he jogged up to them. He nodded at Calcifer. "This is your brother?"
They continued to struggle up the hill of shifting sand, scrabbling fruitlessly against shifting sands with both their hands and feet, when suddenly their foot caught on something hard and a crunching noise made queasiness stir deep down in their stomach.
There stood a young man, he guessed around nineteen or twenty, and he was just about Sam's height when Sam was his age, close to six foot two. He was wearing a plaid flannel and jeans. He was smiling at Bobby, his eyes were a pale blue and he had brown hair that was pulled in a side-part, some of his bangs flopping onto his forehead in a classic 50s haircut. He was handsome, and even though he didn't physically resemble Sam or Dean, Bobby knew their was a connection somehow. He just couldn't put his finger on it.
"Well, I got around fifteen people here, maybe twenty, and I just saw you guys pick up Calcifer a little while ago, so.." Chuck scratched the back of his head of unruly hair as he heard a porceline crash in the kitchen, followed by a timid 'Mr. Chuck?'
"G'nite, Dean." Sam stood up and met his eyes, and tipped his head to the side curiously. A cold flash passed through Dean.
Tobias helped Leo to his feet, and he hunched over a little and cried out. They were standing at the door of the old bunker. Tobias silently reached out and looped his arm over his baby brother's shoulders, helping him stand up as tall as he could. The blonde kid let out a sharp gasp and a hiss of pain. Maybe it
"Fine, Sam." Dean plopped down on the edge of his bed. "When I found 'im he had this..egg, whatever, and he hasn't left it for a second, even when I gave him a ba-" He cut himself off, quickly, mid-word.
Dean couldn't bring himself to look up from the pancake, which was starting to bubble along the pale edges. "I'm sure you'll do great, Cas. Just don't worry so much about it."
Cas heard Samandriel's voice calling out from the hallway. "
, you bastard!"
Cas told him.
"Cal? Are you feeling alright?" Chuck asked, concerned. Maybe seeing the blood had made him feel faint. Chuck scolded himself for not considering maybe he'd be squeamish.
Cas hovered in the doorway as Dean tucked on the sheets and threw blankets on the bed, smoothing them down and patting the bed, trying to make it seem a little more inviting. "Alright, buddy." Dean smiled half-heartedly at him. "See you in the morning, I guess."
"Where are my fledglings." Cas demanded weakly, more in a moan than he would have liked, his eyelids fluttering as his head lolled to the side. "I need my Hope. Bring me my egg."
he ever talk to Sam about this? "It's good. We're good."
"I promise you I'll repay for the supplies." The ex-angel spoke up after they'd been driving for a while, heading back home with a car full of supplies stuffed in the backseat and the boxed crib stuffed in the trunk.
"I didn't tell you because... I don't want to hurt you again." Jack blurted out. "Take too much again- I felt like a vampire. I just couldn't stop. I don't mind living like a human if it means I don't have to hurt you, father."
"Dean, what if I mix them up? I don't want girl hair." Cas said, genuinely concerned, as he examined the bottle with a critical eye, trying to commit to memory that 'conditioner' was for Sam's use only.
Cas frowned a little. "You don't have to do things like that for me, Dean."
There
"Cas?" Dean felt his breath catch in his throat as he sprinted and crouched to his knees. "Dude! I found you!" He smiled and a pent-up breath he didn't know he was holding. He surged forward and hugged him tightly, then pulled apart and wrinkled his nose.
Dean shrugged. "Eh. It's not too bad. Full-time job, but it's not too bad."
"Put it down. Now."
Crowley turned his back to him and shrugged, slouching and slumping on himself so that Dean almost felt a little bit bad. The chains connected to his cuffs rattled as he reached for the fork.
I asked why he was teething now, if they were less than a month old. I told them usually it happens at three months.
"That's right, bowlegs." Calcifer smirked. "My name's Calcifer of Friday. Angel of the intersection of Grand and 20th." He laughed.
"You seem to need to care for many people here, Dean." Cas commented quietly.
One woman came in and gently touched his back, handing him a glass of water. "Mr. Chuck?"
"How about hell no." Dean all but growled. "Or are you forgetting you're the one who almost killed Sam?"
"Fuckin' finally." Crowley said irritably when he saw Dean had finally come into the dungeon. "I'm starved."
Crowley grinned at the nervous-looking Kevin, a little blood trickling from his split lip.
That was weird.
Cas smiled and looked at the tiny blonde head.
"Hand them over." Dean growled. "You know exactly what I'm talking about."
Dean bit down, his jaw protruding. "You know what it feels like when it's infected, right? You'll let me know?"
It didn't mean he was anywhere used to it yet.
Bobby realized. "You time-traveled here, boy?!" He demanded. "What the
Let me tell you why prisoners are put into solitary confinement. I was all alone in the dark with nothing but my thoughts about everything I've done in the past few years.
"Overwhelmed" would be an understatement. Cas had absolutely no idea what to do. Dean never thought he'd have to explain so many things in his life.
"Thanks, Sam. I hope we can find it." Chuck let the angel in the room wrap his arm around Chuck's shoulder and lead him gently into the next room. "Maybe once I remember I can start to fix all of this."
Thanks for reading!
Dean looked up, confused at how quickly he'd stood up. "Cas, I mean-"
He nodded, just wanting to go back to sleep.
Dean finally got to masturbate for the first time in a long time, and he thought of Cas while he gritted his teeth and felt his release. He made sure to keep that memory hidden, buried deep away from the angel when he came back. Cas offered to do the same thing if he'd like to have another go at banging some girl, but Dean declined. He just wasn't really feeling it anymore, he comforted Cas, who still felt guilty over the last mishap.
"Thank you, dear." He said wearily, placing the water to the side just as a man came in and did the same thing, gently touching his shoulder and extending his hand to drop a few pain relievers into Chuck's palm. "Here, Mr. Chuck."
Cas swallowed and continued. "Because that's all it is, Dean. A vessel." He finally looked up and met Dean's eyes, which were narrowed in concern.
The angels got a lot of shell in the eggs he had leftover from yesterday, and they had to throw all of the soupy yellow with sharp white shards out. Chuck went to get his wallet and keys and go down to the store once more for more supplies. And he bought in bulk at Costco and was still running out much too quickly.
"Hey! No running in the house!" Kevin was calling after them as Red, Io and Leo were tearing through the house, just having come in from outside. Sam groaned when he saw that mud was splattering everywhere and brown footprints were all over the house.
"You are not porcine in anyway I can see, Dean." Cas spoke up quietly, finally slipping the plaid material over his hips, reaching for the folded shirt.
Dean only met his eyes for half a second before looking away, he chuckled half-heartedly and shook his head. Cas frowned and took his hand away again and tucked it into the pocket of his coat.
“Of course.” Castiel interrupted to agree, fingers sure and nimble as they circled Dean’s hole with lube, pressed in with a squish and began to twist and scissor. “If that’s what you want.”
Dean was only half paying attention as he pulled food from the shelves, a can of tea for Sam, some of those sugary candies Kevin liked to munch on while he worked. Some Bisquick for breakfast pancakes for the family-(wait, did he just think
Dean chuckled at that, with these dense volumes it was known to happen. "Alright, kid. Enough dead trees for now. Off to bed. Cas is already there to tuck you in."
"Winchester!" The sort-of-ex-demon was screaming out, banging his fists on the door. "Winchester, god dammit!"
Dean finally let go of his mouth and damn near bellowed. "No, Cas, it's just, you look like a kangaroo or something. Oh, I know! Like that friggin' pink pokémon thing with the egg, the nurse one, bahahaha!" He doubled over with laughter.
"You know, he kinda looks like you, Cas." Dean said quietly. "The black wings and everything."
They gave me two meals a day, a kind of brunch and dinner. Before the babies hatched, Kevin or Sam would come let me out and I could eat dinner with them with my hands loosely cuffed so I could handle a fork. But now, I was never let out.
The wayward angel had his arms spread over his head, an elated smile on his face as grace rocketed into him from every direction, filling him with the power of thousands of angels. The Scribe thought about how stupid Castiel had been for trying to use the Leviathans in the same way. Purgatory's creatures were filthy and their energy unpredictable. But heaven's angels...their energy was pure and clean, and as it filled Metatron to the brim, he felt his power expand to something he hadn't imagined.
"Hey. Six hours of sleep without a baby feeding off your energy. I forgot to add that before." Dean twisted away just a little. "Go to sleep, Cas."
?" Dean asked irritably from the driver's seat.
"Thanks, Dean. And if you ever need more food for those little babies of yours, I've got twenty or so fully charged batteries." Chuck laughed half-heartedly and made his way to his kitchen, where three newly human angels were staring at a broken plate like guilty little kids, not knowing the first thing about how to clean up.
"Have I told you that you're my favorite daughter?" Dean laughed, and Io finally giggled through her tears. "I'm your only daughter, silly."
"I miss you, man. I miss your stupid little head tilts and confused glances and intense stares. I'm sorry for all those times I got mad at you for personal space." Dean perked up as he actually felt Cas's hands slip into his, he felt his calluses scrape against his and his fingers squeezed gently.
"You won't, Cas." Dean quickly replied, but he couldn't help but have a bad feeling in the pit of his stomach.
"Castiel Winchester, you answer me!" Dean hollered agrily, pounding with his fist. "Open this fucking door
Bobby sniffled. " 's okay." He rubbed his nose.
"Alright. Let me take those little buggers so you can get some sleep, okay? I'll set something up for them."
"I would never just..drop you, Cas. Frankly, I don't care if you're an angel or not." His eyebrows quirked upward and he prompted with a curt nod. "Understand?" His thumb briefly swiped at the back of his neck before he drew away again.
Dean chuckled as he massaged the shampoo into Io's black hair, she patiently had her eyes closed and was gripping the edge of the tub, not making a sound. "I thought angel babies would be, you know, angelic." He smiled and pulled her hair into a sudsy mohawk. "This little piggy behaves pretty well." Dean did have a soft spot for the little girl. Io giggled and clung to Cas's side, where she squeezed her eyes shut and poked his shoulder. He smiled and dumped a cup of water over her head.
Cas nodded again, still looking at the ground.
his fingers tugged at the tie around his neck. Once it came undone he pulled at one side and it slipped into his hands. He grimaced as he looped it over Dean's shoulder and tucked it under his armpit, and with a harsh couple of tugs he made it as tight as possible before tying it.
"If it's not him, then who else should do it? Not to sound all sappy, but Cas is the only angel I trust." Dean pressed his lips together. "We'll just have to..really step in and help him."
He missed his
"Yeah." Dean agreed in a quiet hush. "...We are."
Chuck nervously sighed and spoke up again. "Shit, Dean, I saw everything!" He sounded overly concerned at usual. "How's Sam? And Cas? Shit, how are you?"
"It's fine," Dean waved the comment away. "It's good to keep on using this arm and make it stronger, you know?"
"You are not fine, Dean." Cas mumbled back. "You are not yourself, and it's...it's growing."
"But I can still call him Bobby?" Dean's voice was youthful.
"Fine, maybe a little bit of mine, too." Dean teased, somewhat shyly. "What else?"
"Oh, my baby. They get so exhausted for a few weeks after their second set of wings come in." Chuck leaned down and very gently tucked the toddler to his chest, barely disturbing him like he'd done it a thousand times before (which he probably had.) He softly stroked the two pairs of eagle brown wings, which fluttered slightly in his sleep. "I remember when this happened to little Gabriel. He threw such a tantrum." He had a faraway look on his face, his eyes growing weary, absent-mindedly stroking his wings again.
kind of weapon if I can't even write my own fucking name?" Dean shoved Cas's hand away. "Leave me alone. Just let me do this by myself."
"Because..just- ugh, fine!" Dean zipped down his pants and instead intently stared at a water blotch on the ceiling, just working off the sound of it hitting the water in the bowl.
Cas was worried. He had been so small when he hatched.
Dean crossed his arms. "This is what's going to happen." He growled. "Cas is going to carve a twin sigil on you, and one on me. And if you ever come within five miles of us, I'm going to feel it. And if you
anything unless it’s been processed somehow.” You explained, running a finger under the passage you were paraphrasing.
Castiel held a finger to his lips, pointing a finger towards the sleeping Dean. Sam nodded, and tiptoed over to his chair where his phone lay forgotten. As he picked up the device and raised his eyes, he noticed the new movie that was playing in front of them. He quirked a brow, and looked at Cas, then to Dean, then back to Cas.
I mean-“ You rambled, trying to discern whether or not you had overstepped some weird, unspoken angel rule.
, and this is what you do with it?” You cried as you threw your hands in the air dramatically.
“Well, I can see why it’d be reserved for people you’re close to. Like how birds preen each other to flirt.” You pointed out.
“And what happens when they tell you you’re wrong, that your soulmate is the world record holder in murder, the original evil, and the inventor of torture as a concept?” He asked you.
His features started coming into focus, and you could see him furrow his brow.
“Yeah, I doubt the insulation here has been updated since the house was built. And they probably shut off the electric now that the house is empty.” You stood up and pushed the chair back into its previous spot. Lucifer mirrored you, standing up as well. He shrugged off his light jacket and held it out to you. You stared for a moment and shook your head.
“I’ll get us to the nearest payphone and call the bunker, Cas can zap us back. Or you, at least.” He explained, jamming the key into the ignition, and starting the car.
“Yeah, they’re his. No other option, really. Sam’s would be too big, mine are too small, and I doubt Cas has a hidden stash of clothes somewhere.” You came and sat on the bed next to him. “They’ll smell like you eventually.” Lucifer sat up and looked at you.
You cradled the cup into your chest as you turned the doorknob and pushed it open. The room wasn’t how you had left it in the 5 minutes it had taken to get your tea. For example, there was a person in there.
I had, like, half of this drafted already so it was mostly adding and editing but I only have one more chapter drafted and ready to work with so now I've gotta do real thinking about plot and such, pray 4 me. I'm hoping that this new medication I'm on will help me do things I enjoy, like writing, so maybe I'll be updating more? Yeah
“What’cha staring at, psycho?” He joked, his face holding thinly veiled concern. He knew you’d been working all day, as he didn’t sleep, ever, leaving plenty of opportunities to walk by and see who hadn’t left their post.
The voice was low and gravelly, laced with concern and fear.
“…..okay. I won’t.” He said slowly. You took a deep breath, and let everything come tumbling out.
Lucifer leaned against the doorframe, crossing his arms and nodding along with your explanation.
“Yeah, I’m fine. I’m more worried about dinner,” He gestured to the mess around them, “Damn! That’s my favorite pizza place, too.” He huffed.
You breathed a quick huff of amusement from your nose.
He slipped the device into his pocket, making his way to the desk and taking a seat on top of it, facing you.
“So, whatcha been doin’ since 3 in the morning?” You diverted.
Hours passed like minutes, and soon the game was down to the wire, the teams were tied, and Cas was being chased by a creeper. The angel was seriously regretting leaving his cat locked inside his virtual cabin. Unbeknownst to the pair, Sam and Jack were arriving home from long drive. The distracted men both were leaned forward, fully entranced by the screens. The angel was button smashing in a desperate attempt to protect his farm, and Dean, under his breath, pleaded with the TV, “C’mon, c’mon, c’mon, please just a few more yards, c’mon.”
, not the time!” You hissed, freezing in place and the cowboy raised his gun to stomach level.
“No, I’m not. What can I help you with?” He closed the book and placed it on his thigh. You closed the door behind you, and he squinted at you with concern.
“Scoot back a bit, so you’re right up against the side of the bed.”
“Not much else I can do, Luce. They’re dusty but you’ll need a bath for that.” You told him. Even so, you brushed your fingers through feathers as you spoke. He looked back at you with a shit-eating grin.
You nodded, “Brownie points with the admins, good idea.” He ignored you interjection.
“Yes, Sam says sleep is essential for a healthy body.” Jack continued proudly. He beamed as if he had just shared a government guarded secret that no human had ever been told. Castiel and Dean wished him goodnight as he left the two alone to finish the movie.
Sam leaned back in his seat as he digested all you had told him. His eyes had been blown wide the entire time, desperately trying to keep up with all the details.
’ Cas thought, smiling to himself.
He narrowed his eyes, half suspicious.
“Yeah, you wish.” You gave him a light smack on the side of the head, and he turned back to look at the wall.
“I figured you’d say that." You smiled at him, "Anyways, my brain feels like it’s melting. I could seriously use a break, talk to me. What’s up with you, what d’you need?” You asked, closing the computer and pushing the entire pile of work back from the edge of the table. You’d been reading, researching, and working non-stop since that morning, when Bobby had sent the file over. By now, the sun must be setting outside. Not that you would be able to tell. The bunker had no windows, of course, it being underground.
“You’re a good shot, but that’s not going to work on me, Quick Draw.” His voice was low and raspy, and he stared at the man, head tilted.
The seatbelt locks dug into your back, irritating the cuts that decorated your skin. You squirmed uncomfortably.
“You’re no fun, sometimes.” He pouted. He crossed his arms and flexed his wings, flicking water onto you, and the bathroom floor.
Lucifer froze, like a deer in headlights. He slowly leaned forward until you could see every detail of his eyes. There was a dark blue ring surrounding the lighter blue with those steel grey undertones. The colors blurred at the edges, mixing and swirling. Did
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean made a face, never having enjoyed, or, rather, never having tried to enjoy anything but the most violent video games he could get his hands on. Usually, it was either slipped into his coat while the cashier was distracted or given to him as a guilt gift from his father after any particularly bad night.
“Lucifer, what the fuck.” You said, mostly hypothetical, as you sat the clothes on the toilet lid, shielding your eyes.
“Yeah, man, you’re crazy.” You agreed. “We came up here to smoke! We thought the place was abandoned, hasn’t been touched in, like, a week.”
The flannelled man yanked the gun into shooting position and fired twice, hitting your friend right between the eyes both times.
Your lower back connected with the hard ground, and your vision went black for a moment. You drowsily pulled your head back up and looked back at the destroyed window. You drooped again, letting yourself lay against the grass. Your head was throbbing, and there was a ringing that wouldn’t go away. You closed your eyes, and slowly opened them again. There were flames, now, licking and teasing the outside of the house, threatening to engulf the entire structure. You swallowed thickly, trying to focus on staying alert.
“Uh, doesn’t seem like it. You both have wings, both groom to show closeness,” You counted each point on your fingers, “and then there’s the nesting thing.” His eyes went wide.
As the door came into sight, you broke into a jog, and then a run. Your lungs felt like they were full of glass as you breathed in more and more of the cold, morning air. Your cheeks stung and you could feel the flush growing redder on your face with every step. The
Castiel leaned back in the chair, digesting your words. You almost resorted to begging, but he spoke up just before you could finish convincing yourself to begin,
“Cold?” Lucifer asked. You looked back at him.
The southerners’ eyes went wide.
“Did something happen, on that hunt? Did Lucifer do something, or say something that might have…” He trailed off, trying to find the rights words.
The conditioner and shampoo were both the same scent: [FAVORITE SMELL]. You took a deep breath, inhaling the warm scent.

“That’s impossible, [Y/N].”
“No way!” He exclaimed, “He said something about it?”
Your eyes went wide as you began to piece together what he was trying to explain.
His eyes darted around your face, searching for signs of a lie. The man bit his lip for a second and lowered the gun to his hip. He kept his hand in position, though, ready to aim at any time.
You went through Bobby’s case, how Lucifer reacted to your admission of sight, the accidental confession from Castiel, and how Dean almost set the oven on fire trying to make a casserole.
“Don’t mind what? Getting thorns out of your back? Yeah, I don’t mind. Why, does it hurt, or?” You pulled back, afraid of harming him.
“No, no, not forever. It was after we had to work that case together in Albany. The one with the possessed grandfather clock. I woke up the next morning in the medbay and I could see everything. Your wings, Cas’s, everyone’s.” You heaved a sigh, nervously picking at your hands. You popped the joints in your fingers, trying to stay grounded.
“Gross! [Y/N], that’s my brother!”
“Oh my god, Sam, the history of cereal? Your first time back in contact with the real world in

You smacked his leg to get him to look at you again. He cradled his face in his hands, bouncing his foot anxiously. He suddenly looked up from his hands, his brow furrowed, concentrating.
You made your way to the hallway, heading to your room. As you walked, you pulled out your phone and swiped through your music library, quickly finding your favorite playlist. You’d heard these songs a million times before, but it didn’t matter. They only got better with time.
You faced the window and walked closer. 3 red lights. You turned towards the closet and took a few steps. The lights disappeared. Towards the window again, 3 red lights. You looked at Lucifer and jerked your head towards the curtains. He nodded at your signal and began to creep towards you. You reached into our pocket once again and retrieved your keys. On your keychain was a short, sharpened, iron rod. It was small enough to comfortably fit between your fingers and not interfere with driving, but long enough to strike a ghost and steal a few seconds of time, enough time to start a fire.
You leaned over a bit, just enough to peek at his face. His eyes were closed, and he seemed to be enjoying himself. You smiled. It wasn’t often that you saw him so calm and quiet. It was nice.
He looked up at you from the computer and smiled. His eyes were wide, shocked at the loud intrusion.
