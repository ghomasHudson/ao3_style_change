(to long time readers: I will be trying to get other chapters for on-going stories up as fast as I can but my revision comes first so soz!)
...Okay! So maybe he should have been more subtle with his ‘keenness' towards them but he just didn't want them dying in battle or getting seriously bored all the time (they were extremely well known so it wasn't like they could take a walk in the park in peace!).
Now, after days of searching and hours of bloody fighting, they had defeated the others, knocked unconscious, slowly bleeding out or dead. The alternate Avengers hadn't stopped fighting until they were in a sate to not move anymore, moving and fighting like the thing they wanted to do most in the world was kill them in the most gruesome way possible. It was horrifying to see his own dead body, but it had to be done. They just wouldn't go down any other way.
How monstrous can someone be to rescue a thought-dead-friend from HYDRA, only to do the same thing...
Focusing back on Rogers' face, his smirk twisted in cruel delight, Tony glared at the man for all he was worth, making sure his disgust was adamant as he hissed, “What the fuck Rogers? Are you guys seriously so messed up that you think it’s okay to kill kids!”
A renewed hope bloomed about the room, their optimism practically contagious, with a certainty that they
None of them had been at all happy when they heard that Tony had been sucked through a portal, was alive (most likely), but was in a different dimension among millions, which did nothing to relax the furious frowns from their collective faces. The response from Fury was less than satisfactory and had Natasha with a gun to the Master Spy's head and Bucky's metal hand clasped tightly around the man's throat, while Steve stood calmly before him with his arms crossed as he got the information that they needed from the SHIELD Director.
Last chapter guys! Sorry it took so long, this was actually finished in July but I was so busy and had forgotten about it until now!
When the last of the blood was swept up, Banner made sure to bind his arm to his side so that he couldn't move it and rip open the wounds, that had only just started to blood clot, again. And with that, Tony was once again dropped off into the too dark, too hot room. Although, he had to be carried there by Thor, when Tony felt a little too pale from the blood loss and found that his legs were too wobbly to even attempt to walk properly.
Looking at the glass cages and feeling his stomach churn once again, Tony nodded before he slowly walked towards Phil, honey-brown eyes skimming over the key pad with interest, before he completely delved into his engineer mind-set. It had been so long since he'd come across an advanced piece of technology like the one he was in front of now. Rogers and the others had been sure to keep any and all technology far away from his grasp so that he couldn't make a way to escape and kill them in the process. The key pad wasn't an advanced piece of beauty that Tony had wanted to handle, but it was enough to satisfy his mind of a while.
Before the others could start to ask questions, their eyes looked to the container behind Phil's and crippling pain filled their chests...
Tony meant that he could use whatever they wanted him to do to his advantage, like he’d done in the caves when he made the Arc Reactor and his first Iron Man suit. No, they didn’t want anything from him, they wanted him and only
Tony can barely remember exactly how long he’d been in this alternate universe with these dark Avengers but he was starting to feel desperate. Hopeless… Just the beginnings of feeling hopeless sent Tony into desperation, not wanting to this nightmarish situation get the best of him. Though, he knew it was a loosing battle because he could feel himself loosing his hope, bit by bit, everyday.
Subtly, Steve gestured his head, Tony barely noticed it, before two pairs of hands were on him, each holding down and pressing them painfully to the back of the sofa. Tony growled and grunted in pain, his frustration and anger growing to new levels when he felt the familiar biting metal that pinched the scarred skin around his wrists, more clasping around his elbows.
In hindsight, perhaps it was that obsession that had brought him and Tony closer together, as friends rather than reluctant teammates. At first, Steve would gladly spend his time in his room, sketching various poses and renditions of Iron Man for hours on end, giving in to his mind’s desires and staying far away from the inventor. After a month of living at the tower however, it was nigh impossible to still the Captain’s feet from making their way into Tony’s workshop, settling down quietly on the couch as he sketched the suits from a model rather than memory. Tony had pestered him for a while about what exactly he was drawing…
“Don’t think it would be that helpful if it couldn’t, Cap.” Tony retorted, rolling his eyes as he clenched his fist again and the blonde watched in childlike fascination as the gauntlet encased Tony’s hand and forearm once more, every plate fitting perfectly into place. There was something so unbelievably satisfying about watching the armor retract out and in, Steve was sure he could watch Tony do it all day.
The blonde finished his line before glancing up with an inquiring hum. Instead of Iron Man however, he was finishing up a sketch of Tony. The “no watching, no seeking, no day dreaming” thing was harder than anticipated, so if he couldn’t draw Iron Man, he would have to entertain himself with its creator.
Tony bit his lip at Steve’s answer and couldn’t help but lean in to kiss him once more. “Good,” he whispered onto his lips, causing him to shiver, before retreating back to his work.
“Please,” Steve choked out almost inaudibly, praying for that final release. There was a small clatter to his left, and he opened his blue eyes to see what it was, only to get an eyeful of Tony; back resting against the machinery, eyes shut, belt unbuckled, and pants pulled down just enough to reveal what Steve considered to be quite a beautiful package. Tony wrapped a callused hand around his dick and groaned, holding himself tight in an obvious attempt to stave off his orgasm. Steve bit his lip and groaned along with him, the sound low and deep, catching the attention of Tony, causing him to open his eyes. His eyes were searing as he gazed at Steve, and his breath came out in hot pants as he slowly started moving his hand down his shaft. The way that Tony was fucking him with his eyes had the Captain grinding into the table, fighting for his orgasm as he watched Tony jerk himself off.
The Captain gasped as the rock-hard pelvis ground into his hardening dick. He rapidly released one of Tony’s gauntlets and pressed his hand on Iron Man’s sleek abdomen to stop the genius from trying that again.
Steve gazed at the beautiful piece of armor - yes, he was sketching that too, sue him-, then looked back to expressive brown eyes and swallowed thickly, “What is it?” He didn’t really need to be that close to even a piece of Iron Man right now.
“Hey you!” Tony called from across the workshop, garnering the rapt attention of U as Steve continued his sketch. “Not U,” Tony hissed, shooing the whirring robot away. “Steve!”
Seeing the Captain’s struggle, the robot still fucking him placed a hand on Steve’s lower back and pushed down, forcing his hips and diamond hard cock to grind harder into the table. Steve cried out at the overwhelming sensation and gripped the table so hard it cracked beneath his fingers. Tony continued to rapidly jerk himself off, crying out himself as he came like a teenager at the sight of the debauched Captain.
Steve could feel his balls tighten and the heat in his stomach spread like wild fire as he finally reached the top, snapping his hips against the table and moaning unashamedly as he was fucked through his orgasm. His come painted the table and his stomach in volumes of messy ribbon. He didn’t know how long he came, but it felt like hours, every ounce of pleasure being wrung out of him by the Iron Man suit bottoming out inside him. He was shaking, gasping, ears ringing by the time he was thoroughly finished, so he was glad to feel the calming warmth of Tony’s hand against his cheek.
The genius laughed in a light, breathy way, easing the tension and probably expecting Steve to let him up. Unfortunately for him, Steve was suddenly very preoccupied at the moment. The smile on the blonde’s face melted off, replaced by wide eyes and parted lips, both emitting absolute wonder as his blue eyes roamed up and down the titanium suit beneath him. Suddenly, Steve was very aware of the position he had put himself and Tony in, the warmth of the worked up machine radiating in waves against his skin, particularly where his pelvis met Iron Man’s. Steve swallowed dry and shivered as the heat against him reminded him of the burn Iron Man had left against his skin in his dreams.
After that unfortunate incident, the blonde had gone to great lengths to dial down his fixation. No more watching, no more seeking, and now more
A guttural cry tore itself from the blonde’s throat as his orgasm ripped through him like a tidal wave, his toes curling as cum poured over Tony’s gauntlet in rivulets. Steve panted and tried to calm his heart as it beat wildly against his ribcage, because oh my God, Iron Man was still stroking his dick. His member was softening, but it gave a valiant twitch at the feel of the metal rubbing lightly against the sensitive skin.
Tony simply raised an eyebrow at him and casually spun the wrench in his hand, “I thought this was supposed to be
He wasn’t ready, he just wasn’t - not after last night. Steve bit the inside of his cheek and valiantly fought the blush that dared try to creep up his neck, leg bouncing anxiously. He wished he could discard thoughts of his rouge dreams and just focus on what was right in front of him, be able to appreciate the opportunity to spare with his teammate and the privilege of seeing the newest armor in action, up close and personal. But no; instead his mind was plagued with thoughts of Iron Man jacking him off against a brick wall. Steve reflexively slapped his hand over his eyes at the image as if it would make it go away, and Tony’s head snapped up to look at him questioningly.
The steel in his voice was nothing to play around with, and Steve knew logically that Tony Stark did not like to find himself trapped, but he couldn’t bring himself to move. Not when he finally had the whole thing, hot and heavy beneath him, florescent as the repulsor’s light reflected off the red and gold suit like light on a fresh painting.
“Steve,” Tony said his name firmly. When no movement was made by the blonde Tony couldn’t help but roll his eyes at the blatant stubbornness. “Come on Rogers…” He grumbled and bucked his hips again, attempting to throw him off one last time.
Other times, the infatuated Captain would find himself on the roof of the Avengers Tower, gazing up into the night sky with a smile on his lips as he watched Tony take his newest suit out for a spin. Racing, looping and twirling high into the stars, as if he was spreading his wings for the first time. Tony always flew his suits like that, with a flair for the dramatic and love that was palpable, bringing the stunning hunk of metal to life. Perhaps, that is what was making Iron Man come alive in Steve’s sketchbook, because every time he sketched Iron man, he was also sketching a reflection of Tony.
Steve sucked in a breath and straightened his spine, gathering up the moxie to step into the ring. Maybe if he just kept a naked pinup of Furry in mind, he could get through this without embarrassing himself. All heat instantly left the Captains body as the image materialized in his head. He shivered and his semi wilted; yep, that could do the trick.
“Yeah you,” the answer came casually. Tony then clenched his fist and the gauntlet folded back up into a metallic bracelet.   “Saturday night sound good?”
“Your doing so good, Cap,” the genius whispered affectionately, before bending down to press his lips against the blonde’s in a hot kiss. It was slow but intense, wrapping Steve up in a fiery blanket, causing him to moan low in his chest and stretch his neck to push deeper into Tony. The brunette indulged him a minute longer before pulling away. “You’re doing perfect,” he repeated softly, stroking Steve’s jaw one more time. “Hold out just a little longer for me, okay?”
As soon as those words escaped his mouth, Tony leapt into action, going after Steve for all he was worth. Granted, the fight was still a bit lopsided in the Captains favor, but the new suit did give Steve a run for his money. All throughout, the blonde was -
Everything was so hot and suffocating, the hand melting his cock in its heat, despite its metal casing, the air like smog as he breathed it in, the feeling of pleasure tightening in his stomach, burning him alive. The shaking blonde panted heavily and squeezed Iron Man’s wrist for dear life as the gauntlet practically wrung his orgasm out of him, setting every nerve in his body on fire, cum pouring gratuitously over the metal fist. Steve gasped like he was drowning, and his eyes flung open, chest heaving and back arched with the strength of his orgasm. Sweat covered him in a light shimmer and he could feel a distinct, wet warmth in his pajama pants. The Captain groaned raggedly and slapped a hand over his blushing face.
. In answer to his prayers, the Iron Man armor carefully slid almost all nine inches out, before thrusting brutally back into Steve’s ass. His breath caught in his chest as he was suddenly being mercilessly fucked into the work bench. The blonde’s forehead banged against the table as he let his head drop, mouth hanging open and eyes clenched as he screamed silently into the table. All that was heard was the obscene sound of metal hips slapping against Steve’s sweat slicked skin and Steve’s hips hitting the work bench with every thrust.
“Pretty, Cap.” He stated, before reaching up to press the button that opened his faceplate, grabbed a handful of cotton t-shirt and dragging the Captain forwards for a deep, searing kiss. Steve was hesitant but he gradually melted into it, all thoughts floating away as he opened his mouth in a plea for more. He moaned lightly and pushed forwards but was pulled away by the nape of his neck.
An understanding had grown between him and Tony after that, and they learned to just enjoy each other’s company for what it was, the brunette leaving Steve to his own devices.
Tony’s jaw dropped open in absolute shock, his repulsor ready hand going limp as he tried to process what just happened. “Steve...um-?”
Clint swallowed the rest of his rice and pointed his chopsticks accusingly as Steve and then Tony. “Just a spar. Between
On shaky arms, Steve frantically sat up and looked down at the mess he’d made, his blush instantly setting his entire body ablaze. Tony hummed and rubbed his thumb on the reddened skin of his thigh, fingers sneaking under his basketball shorts.
Steve released a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding and relaxed back into the table. When the robotic hands stroked down his spine a shudder ran through his body, and he pushed his hips back into the nine-inch metallic dick behind him. The suit pressed forwards, and the tip of its cock slipped in and out of Steve’s hole. The blonde moaned openly and pushed back again, hoping for more. Finally, Iron Man sank back inside of him, slowly filling him inch by inch. Steve cried out as he felt the entirety of its girth, much bigger than Tony and maybe even bigger than himself. His muscles twitched and clenched around it, trying to relax and accommodate the size, but it seemed futile and Steve was tired of waiting. He dug his hands into the table and pushed back again, practically wailing at the feeling of Tony’s suit stretching him out on the inside.
Steve leaned forward, blindly seeking out that little button on the side of Tony’s faceplate, pressing it as soon as he found it and brining Iron Man’s face into view. He groaned and rested his face against the warm metal.
Steve cringed, knowing that after avoiding Tony all day and now being tardy for their spar, he was definitely behind the eight ball. With a sigh and great reluctance, he closed the book he’d been reading,
“Tony, please.” Steve automatically begged, not caring about how dignified he must look and sound right now, because two hours was a long time edge even a super soldier.
Steve preferred drawing the armor like this, animated and bright, translating on paper more vibrantly than a still model. What he really wished he could do however was sketch Iron Man in action, doing what it does best: saving the world. Oh, but Steve had already gotten in enough trouble over his wandering eyes in the field.
Tony used his freed hand to press the button that lifted his faceplate, and looked at the debauched Captain incredulously, “What the hell is wrong with you?” He then raised his gauntlet until it met Steve’s chest with a glare, repulsor flaring dangerously and bright. “Get off Cap. I mean it.”
A pulse of heat shot straight to the Captain’s dick and he grabbed a fistful of his shorts on his thigh, trying valiantly to reign down his boner. Red filled his face again as he cleared his throat, shaking his head left and right. This had to stop. He was here to spar and that’s what he was going to do, god dammit.
The Captain’s breath caught in his throat and he hesitated before hiding his face in Iron Man’s broad shoulder and grinding his hips down onto the titanium pelvis beneath him. A deep groan ripped past his lips and he did again, letting go of Tony’s other gauntlet in favor of gripping the man’s upper arms, using them as leverage to push himself down harder.
Tony threw a wild left punch, which the Captain instantly caught by the wrist, pulling the genius forward as he lined up and landed a fist to the faceplate. Tony stumbled back dizzily, but not before latching onto Steve, dragging him down with him. As they both hit the floor of the ring, Tony immediately tried his luck at locking down Captain America, attempting desperately to get the super soldier into a compromised position. He even tried to headlock him, but it was a futile effort. Steve took control of the situation quicker than Tony could gather his breath, slamming the genius onto the floor and straddling his waist, while his hands kept a firm hold of the gauntlets, trapping them by Tony’s head.  In all but a second the fight was seemingly over; Tony on his back, as helpless as fish out a of water, breathing haggard and heavy. Steve panted as well with a smile on his face, hot air gathering in the empty space between them.
“…Whatever works, Cap.” The genius eventually replied with a laugh on his lips, only causing the blondes blush to grow hotter in embarrassment.
Once he had the blonde as close as possible, Tony began thrusting up against the soldier faster. Steve’s hips responded immediately, picking up the new pace and grinding himself against the armor for all he was worth, moans filling the room. A light groan could be heard behind the faceplate as Steve rocked into him so hard that he moved the armor against the floor, pushing Tony back and forth with each thrust. The searing coil that wound itself in his stomach was tightening further and further, his balls drawing up and a whine escaping his lips as he neared the edge.
to himself. Although, that feat was made uniquely difficult by one Tony Stark, who felt the need to drag Steve even closer towards his secret obsession today.
Steve groaned and rolled his head till his face met the table – he hated when Tony made him do this. “Please, Tony,” he grumbled before turning his head back to glare at him passionately, “please, would you fuck me already?”
The blonde gasped and shuddered; muscled arms, legs and back trembling from the strain and pleasure. “Please,” He moaned again, begging for something,
The genius graced him with one of his roguish, mischievous smirks, a glint clear in his eye. “We,” he began breathlessly, “are definitely exploring this.”
Tony stayed silent, gripping Steve’s other thigh with his freed hand, helping him grind deep and slow against him.
It was the end of looking at Tony Stark as just a pompous apple that fell from an equally pompous tree - he was an artist, who’s hands could make wondrous, elegant things, of which Steve could fully appreciate (even if he still was a pompous fat-head) However, it was also the beginning of a whole new obsession in Steve’s life: Iron Man.
He couldn’t exactly say no, he was the team Captain after all and needed to understand all upgrades, but he didn’t know how he was, honest to god, supposed to keep his sanity. Every time Iron Man – or even a piece of it - was within arm’s reach, his mind went other places, picking apart each piece of metallic art and sketching it in his mind, over and over until it was imprinted permanently.
Suddenly, the machine behind him stalled it’s pistoning hips and gently pulled out of him; Steve shuddered at the emptiness.
“So,” Tony began, softly stroking his cheek, as his breath still shuddered through him. “What did you think?”
“This is just a taste of a new suit I’m working on.” Tony made a fist with the gauntlet and Steve watched with rapt attention as it seemed to ripple and then seamlessly fold down, drawing away from every one of Tony’s fingers until it was nothing but a wristband. “I’m working on one piece at a time right now, but eventually I should be able to make the entire suit completely compact.” The genius looked up at him excitedly yet smug nonetheless, obviously proud of his creation. Steve shook his head in wonder, mouth hanging open just slightly; Tony’s inventions always amazed him. “That’s…that’s amazing, Tony! Can you make it fold back out?”
Steve groaned low in his chest, he could feel himself tipping over the edge, so ready but needing just one more push.
It was true; two hours ago, Tony had spread him out face down on the work bench, body draped over him and lips whispering, “Stay right there, soldier.” Before leaving to let his suit drive him through the kingdoms of heaven and the circles of hell.
“What’s going on?” Clint asked curiously through a mouthful of Panda Express. Everyone else looked up from that they’d been doing to get the answer as well.
Steve sighed gratefully while the archer pursed his lips in suspicion looking like he had more to say, but Tony was having none of it. The genius quickly swept out of the elevator and grabbed Steve’s wrist so that he could drag him back with him. “Time to go, Cap,” he sang while pressing the button that closed the doors.
“Yes,” Steve replied just as softly. He then circled the repulser before dragging his hand up the gauntlet one final time and reluctantly pulling away. “Thank you, Tony. It’s beautiful.”
– at him before setting down his tool and standing up to casually walk over to Steve, eyes trailing appreciatively up and down his body, as if he was a work of art worth a million dollars. The Captain blushed and looked away but was stopped by a calloused hand on the back of his neck, prompting him to face Tony again. Those rough, warm fingers stroked up his sweat slicked neck and onto his flushed cheeks.
Even now, hours later, Steve is passed out in the car, exhausted, for all that he’d insisted he would be fine until they at least made it to the motel they picked out in their schedule. Usually Tony wouldn’t miss Steve’s DJ-ing, which is almost entirely Disney songs and one-hit wonders, but—it’s past dark now, just a too-bright moon over an open highway, and, well…
“Alright,” Steve allows, and turns that fond grin on Tony. “Did you have a name picked out when you brought her here?”
Steve sits up just long enough to put the soup back on the bedside table, and then curls into Tony’s side again, wrapping an arm around his waist.
She stared at the far wall. “I grew up— I got mad at her, for staying, sometimes. I thought maybe she stayed for my sake. I hated it. But she just loved him. She just didn't want anyone else.”
She gave him a flat look. “It's the Tasha conversation. The one where I beg you to put me out of my misery and ask her to dance. Or dinner. Or just to go ahead and marry you; frankly, I don't care what you two do together as long as it gets her to stop asking me if I think you think she thinks you're wonderful.”
Much to Tony’s chagrin, the sprout did exactly that: it shot up very quickly over the growing season, although it did so with an ugly, spindly vine. Tony often wished that the human would realize the thing was a weed and just pull it already. But horror of horrors— not only did the human not do that, the human deliberately leaned Steve against him and encouraged him to wrap his creepers all over Tony’s gorgeous stems!
He didn’t have his shield, so he launched himself at the doppelganger. “Get away from him!” he snarled.
The video feed of the lobby whisked away, the audio fading out quickly, and was replaced by a feed from the elevator.
“That did not look planned,” Steve said, tapping his fingers on the rim of the popcorn bowl. “Whoever that was trying to steal the Cube originally was headed away from Loki.”
Steve shyly wrapped a creeper around one of Tony’s newest blooms, green curling around red. “I wouldn’t look half as pretty if I weren’t next to you. And that’s the truth.”
Janet dutifully did so. “You know, I was really hoping this would be more fun riddles, less deadly traps,” she complained.
“Yes.” Tony agreed, grinning. He reached out and squeezed Steve’s hand briefly. “But second of all, me? Are you sure you’re not thinking of the Tony that did something really noble and self-sacrificing and died a hero?”
“The arrhythmia’s cleared up, blood pressure and heart rate is normal,” Stark shrugged. “Beyond that, there is only one expert on the arc reactor, and I can do my scans better anywhere but here. Romanoff, you just grab that entire bottle of Aleve they gave you, we’re keeping it. And I’ll take this,” he added, wheeling Banner’s cot out in front of him.
“You’ve always got to be the center of attention, don't you?” Romanoff said, and to Steve’s surprise her voice sounded fond and amused.
She jogged off in the opposite direction. As soon as she turned a corner, Steve heard a faint “Eep! Miles! Guess what?”
He swallows and steps away. “Yeah, no, I actually need— I have to go work. Sorry,” he says, making a face. “It’s just a mess right now, and I need to be on damage control, I have to rush out a prototype—“
The footage started rolling. “I’ll take that drink now,” Loki’s voice said, and Steve cast one last look at Tony’s face, lit from under by the glow of his tablet, before focusing on the task at hand.
“No way,” Steve protests. “This is my electric blanket, you gave it to me, you are never getting it back—“
Tony balks. “The engineers can have a cat when they can manage basic rocket science,” he grouches. “No, we’ll ask around PR—they do the
“Change of plans,” Loki replied in Steve’s voice. “I just got a call from the Secretary. I’m gonna be running point on the scepter.”
“Mark that down as another right turn, Giant Girl,” Storm said, looking unruffled, but slightly singed. That fire pit had been nasty, and Storm’s attempt to catch Janet with her wind had whipped up the flames.
Pepper blinks back at him, utterly unimpressed. “No, actually,” she says, deadpan. “We’ve got about 8,000 things to do and zero time for your attitude. And don’t think you’ve gotten out of talking to me about this.”
“And that’s fine, that’s… your prerogative,” Tony continues, but he looks so pained as he says it that Steve can’t help but consider it a blatant lie. “I’m just… I don’t understand. What you want,” he adds, looking lost.
“My mom would want me to be happy,” she murmured. “I think she was afraid I would end up like her, too.”
“Definitely,” Steve said. “Banner only has to come upstairs, but Nat and Clint are at least a couple hours out. Thor will probably fly from New Mexico.”
She gazed back at him defiantly, face a little pink. “At least now I know I wasn't as obvious as I thought I was.”
Tony twitches involuntarily as Steve digs his thumb into a particularly tender spot, and Steve gentles his movements immediately, soothing at the area and working on it more slowly.
“Tony’s in danger. That’s not me up there, JARVIS. I’m the one who — you’ve got an alert set up to let me know if Tony’s not slept in 72 hours. You found me restaurant recommendations for team night, you — you helped me Google Stonewall and AIDS and gay marriage, JARVIS, take me up!”
“Sure, Jan,” Steve said, and masterfully repressed a smirk as she gave him what he had come to call the “did Cap just make an internet joke?” squint.
“Hulk not see anything,” the Hulk rumbled, “but knock-off Riddler deserved it.” Janet patted his bulging forearm fondly.
Steve’s eyes slide closed and he breathes in, deeply, catching the familiar scent of Tony’s cologne, and skin, and a hint of sweat.
too close. Whatever it was wasn’t bothering him right now, but eventually it would get bigger and its roots would get deeper and then they’d be
He is—curled half in on himself sideways in the seat, bony hand clutching a blanket to his chest. His mouth is just slightly open, drooling a little, and the moonlight has him lit up. It’s a strange effect—his skin looks like it’s glowing, except for where stark black shadows block the light, and his face looks like a fucking painting, all moonglow and pale smooth skin and the dark falls of shadows from his eyelashes and hair.
Iron Man sighed, but didn’t argue, following instead with his right hand resuming its trail on the outer wall. “I’m starting to think Giant Girl might have been right,” he said. “We’re pretty clearly dealing with some kind of magic nut. This maze could be moving without us noticing, or spelled to lead us to a certain spot.”
“They put chopped pecans and shredded chocolate on it, too,” Steve said, sliding a plate in front of Tony. “It was strangely compelling, to be honest. But I had to draw a line somewhere, and it was that or come home one day to find them making candles with it.”
“Oops. Sorry,” Steve hums, and kisses whatever part of Tony is closest. It tastes like his shoulder.
“Not too dire, Ms. Stark; you haven't bled through your bandages.” He smiled at her, smoothing her shirt back down. “But please, call me Steve. Nurse Rogers was my mother.”
“Yeah, you’d better,” Steve said, smiling. “Gosh, Tony, I really thought with a whole seventh of a second in warning you’d be perfectly prepared and positioned to save my life without jarring my shoulder.”
“All right, I’ve gotta cop to it,“ Stark said suddenly. “This one’s on me. My fault. You all had a good effort going there.”
“Can’t believe this,” Natasha muttered again. “Those agents on Loki are getting the reprimanding of their lives. They could have secured the Tesseract if they’d been paying attention, and instead no one even noticed Loki was gone with it until Thor said something.”
“Garbage bags,” Steve replied. “Lots of ‘em. Heavy duty. One for trash, one for recycling, one for donating.”
“I can never decide if you sound more like a drill sergeant or someone’s mother when you use that voice,” Natasha complains.
“Whatever it is— please talk to me, Tony,” Steve says, circling his hand around Tony’s wrist. He smooths his thumb over the bony ridge there. “We can face it together.”
“I wasn’t going to!” Tony says, indignant, and he sounds so awake. “I’ve been bringing it food, because I’m a philanthropist.
“Yeah, I think he liked it,” Tony said, sitting in the armchair across from Steve’s. He peered down at the drawing. “I like it too. You’ve got a real eye for it.”
“I— I've been busy. It's. You know. Crowded.” Steve managed, and valiantly resisted the urge to strangle himself. A young woman in periwinkle giggled.
She said all this with the arch tone of someone who was recalling something exactly, and yet, Steve could only think of the time when he was eleven, and Frank the butcher’s son swore up and down that Vera Martin thought he was cute.
“Please?” Steve asked, coming around the chair. Tony made a displeased sound and picked up a tablet, holding it pointedly in front of his face.
“With me,” Tony clarifies, voice ragged. “Because I can’t— I don’t know. I can’t tell if I’m only seeing what I want to, and it’s making me…” He takes a deep breath, and his face scrunches up, falls into that miserable expression Steve can’t forget. “I can’t do this anymore, Steve. I’m just… I’m tired.”
When he was done he reached for Tasha, resting a hand in her hair, and scooted closer. He kissed the side of her head.
“And I needed to get the scepter from them so that my Avengers could undo something terrible. We really were only borrowing it.”
“Tony,” the other man corrected, shooting Steve a warning glance from under unfairly long eyelashes. Steve’s heart did something flighty in his chest, a feeling like arrhythmia— although of course he didn’t have to worry about that anymore.
Steve nodded. “The only communication from the suspected perpetrator was a riddle signed by ‘The Enigma.’ Twelve minutes ago, a SHIELD team solved it, and gained entrance.”
He stays there, petting the cat’s soft fur and feeling it purr gently, for as long as he can. And a bit longer, apparently, as Pepper calls to angrily brandish paperwork at him over the phone.
“Then we’re good to hang out somewhere less depressing,” Stark said. “You’ll like it. I don’t think there’s even any structural damage there.”
“This is strange,” Steve says, head resting on Tony’s chest. He’s never been in this body with Tony before, never been anything but strong and broad and tall when he’s curled up next to Tony.
Steve joined him with the blankets, kicking off his muddy boots. He was pretty sure they were red, once. “If we had some hot cocoa, this wouldn’t be so bad,” he said, tucking a blanket over the both of them.
Iron Man was looking the other way, staring determinedly at the unchanging wall. As Steve watched, his footsteps slowed slightly until he was now walking behind Steve.
“So is this what you’ve been stewing over all this time?” Steve asks, feeling a swell of hope. “Not that it wasn’t a legitimate reason to be upset, because it was, but I was afraid you secretly had brain cancer.”
He was watching the ice melt in his glass, having just finished nodding and smiling his way through a conversation with the mayor’s son, when Pepper found him again. She put her hand on his arm, and her manicure dug into his suit jacket, a warning in nude pink.
“Yeah. She liked having a little gardening to do, I think. Think she always wanted to grow flowers though. I used to— I would daydream about making enough money somehow to get her a house. Someplace with room to breathe and enough yard for her to plant whatever the hell she wanted.” He stared up at the ceiling, smile fading. “That was always kind of a pipe dream.”
“We’re here,” Steve said, ducking inside the exit to the storm room. He had to bite back a swear when he did. Sure enough, the entry he and Iron Man had come through had not reappeared.
Tony took his hand again and squeezed it in both of his. “I’m sorry,” he said. “I know how to catch people without hurting them, I was just sloppy. I’ll do better.”
Tony leaned into him. “Steve. Look, we have so few days off. You really want to spend the day cleaning a closet?”
‘Boring’ was not how Steve would have described the evening so far. ‘Emotionally agonizing.’ ‘Wracked with indecision,’ maybe.
“Technically I think I warned you about a seventh of a second before I jumped.” Steve said. “How far out is Damage Control?”
“What the hell do we say in our reports to SHIELD on this? Fury’s gonna be expecting us to turn this footage over,” Natasha said. “And if STRIKE is Hydra — do they still think Cap is one of them? They’re gonna want an explanation for him losing the scepter.”
"I guess you were right about one thing," the man started in a soft voice, tone gentle in a way that made Tony tense and crinkle his brow in slight confusion, "Your team did come here to save you. I don't know why I doubted that they would, after all, we tore the whole world apart when you left us. They're here to take you home," relief and hope warmed Tony's chest, the emotions so overwhelming that it felt like a dam had broken and tons of water had crashed over him before he even had the chance to fix the damage. Emotions like that were powerful and crushing in times of captivity, it can drive you forward, or it can completely and utterly ruin you - he would know. Relief flooded the features of his face before he could hide them from the ruthless Captain. Tony knew it was too late to drive the emotions under control again when Rogers swiftly crouched down, making it so they were eye level. Harsh fingers gripped his chin, bruising the flesh on his jaw in an aching and lasting way, as he forced Tony face forward so that they were inches apart. Breathing harshly through his nose, Tony held the blue gaze with his own warm brown, not daring to pull away in case the Captain hurt him even more. Rogers leaned closer, his breath tickling the skin of Tony's neck as the black clad man leaned in ever closer, each inch agonisingly slow, before he whispered tauntingly in Tony's ear, "But they're never going to get the chance."
"Tony, Tony, Tony." Rogers tusked in mock disapproval, as he lead Tony down the hall, his hands a white-knuckled grip in the brunette's short hair, ignoring the genius' cries of pain and yells of protest. Rogers continued undeterred, striding to the living room, the sharp echoes of his shoed feet adding effect to the vicious acts that he was about to commit, Tony's yells and stumbling footsteps behind him adding to Rogers' sadistic pleasure.
Slowly, Tony stepped away from the thick glass, lowering his eyes dejectedly after seeing Phil's returned nod, looking away from the retreating form of his would-have-been saviour that he so desperately wanted to follow after, it was too painful to watch. In a daze, Tony sunk to his knees, beside the unconscious god, his head lowering further until Tony was practically curling in on himself. Silent rivers of tears streamed down his face, hot and quick, the tears washing away the remains of his shattered hope, leaving only misery and terror behind, making him tremble ever so slightly.
At least Tony could walk into the room, knowing that none of them would try to kill him for his escape.
The last thing he heard before succumbing to the darkness was the Captain’s harsh voice giving out strict orders: “Thor, take Tony home. Bruce, Hawkeye and I will destroy the portal and data. Widow, kill Richards.”
Immediately after receiving his orders, Thor left the Baxter Building and the sounds of the blubbering scientist behind, begging for his life like the pitiful thing he is; he took off just as the desperate noises were silenced with a loud crack. He flew fast but at a slower pace than he would without the man in his arms, Thor had the capabilities to travel at neck-breaking speeds for a mere mortal and he didn’t want to risk it now.
Thor could barely keep his tears at bay when his eyes landed on his brother. While he knew that they this Loki was not his own, it still horrified him to no end at the fate which had befallen him. Never in Thor's darkest nightmares had he ever imagined this for his younger brother... Bright green eyes, once full of life and mischief, was now void of all life and awareness. But even worse than that, black thread wove into the skin of pale, scarred lips, past rips of skin from when Loki had inevitably attempted to talk.
“Yeah,” Steve said. Despite the warmth of Tony’s shoulders still brushing his, he suddenly felt a little chilled.
He leaves it there, taking several long strides to the trash can, and fishes the ring box out. He drops it onto a worktable.
Tommy, the blur that’d nearly wiped him out on the first day, was part of the first group, the oldest one. Kamala, Miles, and Nadia were all from the second, newest cohort.
Tony breathes out slowly, pressing his hand tight over his mouth. The ring is— it’s been here for… well over a month, now. Tony’s been sitting on it, trying to find a way to ask Steve if marriage is something he might want with Tony.
Natasha was typing fiercely into her own tablet, fingers flying as she clicked over the keys. “And I’m starting to feel like whatever happened to your arc reactor was no malfunction, Tony.”
“Not a problem,” he responded. “And just so you know, I’m not trying to trash talk Tony Stark or anything. I know he’s your friend. It’s just that he’s a bit of a disaster, romantically.”
Rhodey put out blooms as well, surprisingly small and delicate, considering how big Tony knew they would be eventually. Up by the mailbox, Tony could see the tell-tale yellow blobs that meant Happy was putting his own show on. Everything was green around him except for Steve, limp and brown in the cradle of Tony’s branches.
Steve’s head was spinning, burning. He wanted to demand the other Rogers leave, wanted to force him out, wanted, strongly, to say you can’t have him and give the bastard the boot.
“But it’s a good cat, Pepper,” Tony wheedles. “The best cat. And I don’t want to bring it to a shelter; they have such high kill rates and hardly anyone adopts grown cats.”
“I don’t know what to think,” Steve said, frowning. “You let me gush about you to yourself-- I suppose there wasn’t a good way for you to say no when I didn’t even know it was you-- and, of course, I’ve made you reject me twice,” Steve groaned. “Jeez. I really am sorry, Shellhead.”
Eventually Rogers released Tony and stepped back, just as Steve had been seriously contemplating clearing his throat pointedly or something. Rogers’ hands trailed off Tony’s arms entirely too lingeringly.
Around them, the maze had faded into the air, illusion dissipating without its power source. The Mall of America was slowly reappearing, dazed shoppers wandering out of purple mist.
As quickly as it came, the mist vanished; the shaking subsided. Straight ahead of them, a wall that had been solid was now a massive stone entryway with gruesome twisted lion faces carved on either side. The lion faces, of course, spoke.
Steve grinned and grabbed another cookie to decorate. “Go get the others. Tap out. Take a break.” He slid the cookie over to Tony. “This is a wonderful idea, Tony.”
Her massive blows first cracked, then crumbled, then finally broke through the floor, shaking what felt like the entire labyrinth with each hit. She shook her hand when the first hole appeared, brushing stone dust off her knuckles.
Steve settled into teaching well. He liked it—more than he thought he would, even. The kids were bright—brilliant—and made him laugh most days, which pleased his therapist enormously. He didn’t even mind when they made fun of him for his outdated ways or ignorance of modern references—they were teenagers, so that was the natural way of things. And they were always down to share a video or explain the joke, and they were gratifyingly disgusted when he returned the favor by misusing his new know-how.
The explosion rocked the room, and provided a brief, painful flash of warmth, but faded without any further effect on the wall.
“Only a little,” Natasha said with great dignity. “It was my father’s fault, really. So I had a big stupid crush on you the second I saw on you, and I just kind of— you know, I thought it would go away once I got to know you. I just tried not to make a fool of myself in the meantime.”
“I’m trying, big guy,” Spidey promised, and dropped from the wall with a yelp as Logan came flying at him-- claws out. “Watch it with those things!”
“I’m with GG on this one,” Spider-Man said. “Everyone knows nature isn’t really relaxing without mosquitos.”
“Oh, gosh!” the blur cried, its face resolving into Giant Girl’s. “I’m so sorry, Cap.” She hovered over him, helping him sit up with a hand on his back.
“Do we know what happened to the people who were in the Mall when this happened?” Steve asked, eyeing the labyrinth. It was gray and massive, several stories tall and made out of something that looked like smooth, shiny stone.
It took up three floors’ worth of vertical space. There was a curved, massive balcony at the top closed off with blue glass; clearly for observation. There were several panels of blue glass on the wall to his left, as well, for closer study. What was meant to be studied could be the odd metal panel sticking out of the wall—or the legs and ass hanging sideways out of the opening—but Steve suspected not. Sadly.
Perfectly transparent on all sides. It felt terribly vulnerable but was certainly bulletproof, fireproof… probably proofed against some absurd future problem that Steve was too primitive to even imagine.
“Obviously you’re— you don’t have a cold or anything,” Steve says, inhaling shakily. “What I mean is, are you really sick, bad sick, and keeping it from me because you think—“
He woke up the next morning with Natasha spooning him, her arm over his waist and her face pressed against his spine. He rolled over to return her embrace and resolved, quietly, to spend as many mornings that way as he could.
“I can do that,” Tony said. “While I grab those, you’re in charge of cleaning music. Don’t disappoint me.”
Their motel is ahead, a lone glowing sign below the moon. Tony slows, and pulls into the lot, and stops talking.
“You are so oblivious, it’s almost cute,” Jan said fondly. “Only almost, though. It’s kind of infuriating, too.”
Hulk was a wrecking ball, leaving cracked indents in the wall with every crash and roaring incessantly.
But then he catches Tony’s expression, sometimes, never for more than a second, but— the look on his face is so despairing that it’s ingrained in Steve’s memory.
“I see you have a companion, Sir,” JARVIS says as soon as Tony steps in the elevator. The cat’s ears prick.
“It’s dim, but we’re adjusting,” Storm said. “There’s some kind of ambient light, although there doesn’t seem to be a source.”
It passes, finally, and he draws in breath on a slow, painful wheeze. He droops back into his pillow, every inch of him exhausted and leaden and aching.
“Do you guys want me to sit this one out?” Bruce asked, squinting up at the massive dark entrance of the labyrinth.
But no sooner had his hand touched the door than it flew open off its hinges, an irate Hulk bursting through roaring about the stairs. The man took the Hulk-force door to the face and the suitcase went flying, the Cube scattering across the floor to land squarely at the feet of the worst possible person.
A woman talking to Tasha spotted him and inclined her head his way, saying something smirkingly. Tasha turned to look at him, her face lighting up.
“He did, didn’t he?” Steve said miserably. “Gosh, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to make things awkward. He’s just so… well, wonderful.”
“They’re not gonna be labeling their secret files with a convenient ‘Hydra Eyes Only,’” Natasha said. “What are you even going to be looking for?”
And Tony, finally, looks directly at him. “I heard you say it!” he bites out. “At the charity gala! When you were talking to Senator Guavez’s daughter, and she asked—“
Still, the question did stick with him. In between ordering dizzying amounts of red, orange, and yellow roses and booking about twelve dozen decoy locations, Steve did kind of begin to wonder.
“Steve,” Natasha said. “I— that's what I meant. I've been in love with you since, oh, I don't know. Maybe a month after we met.”
“Hey, stranger,” she replied, smiling. Her lips were very red, and her eyeshadow had been done in shimmery orange and gold like a sunset on her skin. It made the blue of her eyes seem Caribbean clear. “I've hardly seen you all night.” She reached out and grabbed his forearm, squeezing just a little.
do that. Heaven knows I won’t stop you,” Steve drawled. “But if that’s all you’re after, you could also just try asking nicely.”
“Well, you don’t believe in kicking me out of bed. So I still get to sleep next to you. That’s what I really want just now.”
Steve got very droopy after that, and Tony thought guiltily that perhaps he hadn’t needed to be so harsh.
Tony grabbed Steve’s hands and held them up to his chest, staring at Steve with his eyes blue and honest. “Steve,” he said. “You are the love of my life. I would die for you–”
“Steve?” He stopped at the door, turning back, and drew up short, concern swelling at the unexpectedly serious look on her face.
“Excellent.” Stark clapped and stood, shoving Banner’s feet off his lap. “Barton’s got his Neosporin, Cap, you bring your lima beans — Thor, you done bleeding on that bandage?”
Good Lord. The man—Anthony Stark—was movie-star beautiful, with dark hair, expressive eyes, meticulously groomed facial hair, and a winning smile. He held out a hand and Steve clumsily shuffled his portfolio into his other arm to shake it.
He assembled Tony’s sandwich first, using the turkey Jarvis had picked up from a deli. “Tomato and mayonnaise, but no mustard, right?” he asked.
“”No,” Steve snorted. “I just had to hide it from Spider-Man and Giant Girl. I caught them putting it on vanilla ice cream the other day.”
It smelled amazing. Steve’s stomach growled audibly, and Tony leaned over the couch to pass the bowl to him.
“Awkward,” Tony said. He cleared his throat. “What happened? Does this have anything to do with Hydra?”
This wasn’t untrue, Steve supposed, a little uncomfortably. He’d never really considered it before now— was that sexist?
“Tell Pepper I’m sorry I couldn’t survive until the board meeting next month. Tell Rhodey that I wrote him out of my will but his mother can have her pick of my cars. Tell Jarvis–”
She hadn't, but Frank had sure gotten a kick out of watching her politely but awkwardly turn down the three daisies Steve had gotten for her.
“I don’t—“ Tony stops and takes a deep breath, hand pressed tight over his eyes, and he looks— too-thin. Defeated.
Tony quirks a little smile and leans in to kiss Steve. He can be okay. He’ll pawn off the ring and put that silly little dream on the shelf, and he’ll keep Steve for as long as he can.
“Budge over,” he says. “And let me in, you cover hog.” He tosses the extra blanket over to Steve, and then clicks the control attached to it. “Electric blanket,” Tony explains.
The soft mist of sleep stirs just once, when the room has gone dark and the movie has ended. He feels Tony shifting underneath him, scooting down on the bed. Tony settles finally and sighs.
Thor looked down, peeling his borrowed t-shirt up to reveal his abs and also the bandage covering his stab wound. “It is well,” Thor said. “Loki inflicted far deeper wounds than this in jest, many times.”
“Captain. Cap? Steve, come on buddy, breathe for a second,” Stark was touching him, his hands very warm on Steve’s shoulders. His voice sounded very strange in his ears. “Come on, take a breath in. In with me,” Stark urged, inhaling slowly, and it was only when Steve obeyed that he realized he’d been holding his breath.
Pepper holds up a hand. “I’m sure somebody will be happy to give this cat a home, Tony. Why don’t you go pick it up, and see if one of the engineers wants it?”
He found himself leaping to the wall and sticking there before he quite knew what was going on, just as the ledge Bruce and Logan were on slipped away out from under them, dropping them into the sphere.
Pepper raises an eyebrow. “My pug. Socrates. You called him terrifying and then fell asleep with him on your face, remember?”
“I may not understand everything about the modern world,” Steve said. “But that was not a joke or a mistake. That was Hydra. Whatever’s going on here, SHIELD is compromised.”
“Spidey says that you and Shellhead are together. I told him my nose would have noticed if you were.”
A set of dry lips press against Steve’s forehead, lingering sweetly. Tony inhales deeply, his arm tight around Steve’s side, and then, finally, pulls away. “Love you,” he murmurs roughly.
“My mom would be disappointed in me if I messed up loving you,” Steve said at one point, and Natasha opened her eyes and wondered when she’d closed them in the first place. She shifted a little, adjusting her head on Steve’s chest.
“Probably something to do with the way you two are always running off together,” Logan grinned with the smugness of a man proved right.
“I’ve got it,” he said, and three floating discs detached from his armor. They surrounded the infuriated minotaur, which shook its head at them as if they were flies.
“Let’s get going,” Logan said. “I got the feeling this is gonna take a while, and something about this place makes me wanna sneeze.”
“Then she said, ‘Here is your bride, fool. Seal this sacred bond with a kiss,’ and lest any doubt the zeal of the Lady Sif you should all know she let neither goat nor man leave that bed until a kiss had been bestowed. ‘Twas a most bloody kiss,” Thor finished, and they all cackled.
There was also Miles, who was a whiz in Tony’s classes and always teaming up with Kamala to try and convince Steve to do TikTok dances. There was Nadia, who was as gratifyingly culturally ignorant as Steve himself, but much more willing to learn choreography for the internet.
Steve was wide-eyed and wide open, blue eyes as vulnerable as Tony had ever seen them. He felt a little dizzy with it, watching Steve’s eyes flick back and forth between his.
Steve doesn’t want to marry him, but that’s fine. Tony just has to forget he ever thought he could marry Steve, and keep his mouth shut about his stupid hurt feelings.
“I’m sorry I called you a sucker. I didn’t mean it. You’re not hurting me or stealing nutrients, and I don’t mind you that much at all,” he said fervently. “Please get better.”
Tony just barely got ahold of him, both hands digging into his forearm, and although Tony tried to swoop with Steve’s momentum, the catch was far from smooth. Steve’s shoulder jarred so fiercely he could hear it groan. He gritted his teeth against the fiery ache in his shoulder socket even as he strained the muscle to leverage himself closer to Tony.
Steve goes. He pillows his head next to Tony, and curls his arm around Tony’s chest, and closes his eyes in the dark soft stillness of their bedroom. “Goodnight,” he says softly.
When spring came, Tony would simply not bloom. The human would try, adding fertilizers and checking for beetles, but Tony had meant what he said. When he thought now of his petals, he remembered the softness of Steve’s stalks and the curl of his creepers, and the red that he favored seemed dull and lifeless when he compared it to the bright green of Steve wrapped around him.
“That’s perfect. It wouldn’t be a learning experience otherwise,” Tony grinned, looking exactly like he did when he said ‘watch this’ to his class before doing something that made the students shout and laugh. “How does Friday sound?”
“At least put the soup down first,” Tony says, sounding exasperated. “You’re going to spill it, and electrocute us both, and then Peter will be an orphan. Again.”
The last commercial fades out and the movie finally starts playing. Steve doesn’t open his eyes, just listens to the dialogue and the sound of Tony’s breathing. Tony’s hand slides up his back and comes to a rest on the back of his head, stroking gently back and forth through his hair.
The giant purple gem, as it turned out, housed the alleged mastermind of the Maze of America: the Enigma.
For a while, that was all there was to it. Steve's breath on her neck, his arm across her chest, his leg gently sliding against her own. Time felt warm and lazy, and there was nothing to worry about except for being close to Steve and dozing in the early morning.
But the cat doesn’t bolt or try to run, just tucks its paws over the crook of Tony’s elbow and lets him hold it.
“Your turn,” Steve prompted, and Tasha came awake again. She made a small sound against Steve’s chest.
He had scarcely finished speaking when a frigid wind picked up, seeming to slice right through his scale mail. It escalated as quickly as the cold had, building near-instantly to a howling gale. “We need to solve the riddle,” he said, teeth chattering.
On his left, Tony could not have appeared less interested. He was tapping away on his phone with a distant little frown, not sparing a glance for either Steve or the doctor.
“If you are planning on dying,” Steve scowled, “you can tell Jarvis your damn self, and I’ll let him set you straight.”
Pepper smacked him lightly, laughing. “Come on, Captain. If you can't work up the guts to dance with her, you can at least dance with me and make her jealous enough to spit.”
Steve’s ears burned. Obediently, he turned toward where Tasha was holding court, surrounded by an enraptured audience. Her dress was simple: stark white, so that her skin seemed to glow and the few dark tendrils of hair artfully loose from her updo looked dark and lush in contrast. The sleeves were long and off-shoulder, baring tantalizing stretches of smooth tanned skin, and when she turned a little, the low-cut back exposed the toned expanse of her shoulders and lower back.
Janet, although usually a little lackluster in her appreciation of weddings, was all over Steve and Natasha’s.
“I do not have any designs on your blanket,” Tony interrupts loftily. “I’m just trying to cuddle with my sick husband, thank you very much you
Steve blew out a breath. “You guys coulda told me I’m that annoying,” he said, coming to stand next to Tony.
“Do you need help getting somewhere?” she asked. She carried a physics textbook with several comic books stacked on top of it.
Steve set to work quickly, drawing an Iron Man helmet with red and gold icing, then a Black Widow symbol, and then his shield. Tony watched, smiling wearily.
Oh, god. He was going to chicken out again. He was going to miss his chance and spend the night counting specks of dust in the mansion’s library and probably the rest of his life watching Natasha date people who were terrible for her and also
Steve picked up the sketchbook and opened it to a random page—a drawing of Miles hanging by a web from the ceiling of the atrium. “I like to draw,” he said. “I could draw you.”
When they touched down on the landing pad, one of the physicians Tony kept on call for the Avengers was waiting. She pulled out a clipboard while Tony stepped out of the suit.
Not that Tony was afraid of a little competition. His roots were strong and deep. The human watered him just enough and the fertilizer was
But there was nothing for it. Steve didn’t respond and he didn’t get better. His leaves continued to wilt, went brown and crunchy, and eventually, disintegrated. His leafstalks, once green and soft around Tony’s hard stems, turned brittle and brown. Steve was quite dead.
Iron Man kept the line on the way back into the storm room, which Steve was dreading with a crawling sort of tension. The minotaur, although formidable, was certainly not terribly intelligent, and never seemed to figure out Iron Man’s maneuvers.
The claw rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise, then the whole arm swivelled back and forth—a slow, stilted
The other Rogers backed away quickly. “I’m away,” he said defensively, and dropped the scepter on the floor. Slowly, his hands in the air, he kicked it towards Tony.
“Well,” Tony said, and dropped onto the bed next to him. His hand touched Steve’s, very tentatively. “It was less that I wanted to reject you, and more that I didn’t want to lie to you on a date,” he said.
Steve moves a little so that he can kiss Tony’s jaw, feeling the faintest rasp of stubble against his lips. Tony sighs a little, but he hasn’t— he’s still so tense, he hasn’t relaxed at all in Steve’s embrace, and that, honestly, stings.
“Yeah,” Steve says, quirking a stiff little smile. “I said I couldn’t possibly marry you. I wouldn’t even consider it.”
“Me too,” Natasha said, smiling brightly. “And don’t look now, but Janet’s headed this way with a folder full of what I’m sure are pressing wedding planning emergencies, so. Wanna play hooky?”
Natasha didn't dare turn over and risk aggravating her wound, but she wanted so badly to drape herself on top of Steve and smother his wistful expression with kisses. She settled for kissing his fingers where they were twined in her hair.
“Actually… maybe?” Tony said. Steve glared at him. “What, I’m just saying, it is theoretically possible. I bet I could crack time travel.”
Iron Man didn’t let up. The attack increased in pitch and intensity until Storm and Giant Girl also covered their ears, pressed back against the door of the storm room. Finally, blessedly, the noise became so high-pitched that it passed out of the human range of hearing, and the minotaur dissipated with a final spectral roar.
“Never mind,” she said quickly. “Can I get a peach ginger ale, please?” she asked the bartender. “Hey, I'm gonna go talk to Pepper for a bit. You wanna Coke or something, Mack the Knife here’ll hook you up.” She jerked her head at the bartender, whose name tag read “Mack” in thick black letters.
Tony snorts, and Steve cracks a smile despite himself. Tony hands him a little plastic cup filled with a bright red syrup. “Cough medicine,” he says briskly. “It’s cherry flavored,” he adds, and Steve takes it from him.
Tony goes all melty inside. “How do you not have a home?” he laments. “You are so good. You are such a good cat. Come on, let’s meet JARVIS.”
“It is 6:33 AM, sir,” he says, and Tony may just be projecting, but he thinks JARVIS sounds more subdued than normal.
Steve pretended to think about it. “The kids do keep telling me that I don’t have to boil everything I eat now.”
“…Am I supposed to be appreciating your restraint?” Tony asked incredulously. “Because I’m not really impressed.”
Steve curled upwards to press their foreheads together, holding the position just long enough to kiss her, slowly, and exhale against her lips. When he laid back down she followed him, pressing soft little kisses against the edges of his mouth.
She’d pinned Steve to go over 1,002 selections of the best photos of them together from candids, formal events, and paparazzi shots— with the daunting task of selecting his favorites.
“We’ll figure it out. I know a place,” Tony said. “We can start with Tex-Mex. See how you do with jalapeños and chili-lime and work our way up to wasabi.”
“You’re baking?” Steve asked, slipping his phone back into his pocket. When Tony had called him down to help with an emergency, he hadn’t imagined anything like this.
“I imagine it’s the same as it ever was,” Steve answered. His jaw was so tight it felt like it was creaking. “Control and death.”
“And here I was hoping we wouldn’t have to clock in today,” Tony said. “You’d think averting nuclear destruction and fighting off an alien invasion would earn you some vacation time.”
Loki, to Steve’s surprise, actually looked down at the Cube and around at everyone else before snatching up the Cube and vanishing.
When Tony finally gets back, it’s late evening, and he really would just like to just… collapse somewhere. And stop thinking.
“Yeah, we know how to keep the romance alive,” Tony grinned. He dropped Steve’s hands with a kiss to his wedding ring, turning back to face the closet, and immediately grimaced. “Alright, Cap. What’s the strategy?”
“Don't look so worried,” Tasha said, hating the tight, unhappy expression on his face. She popped the pills in her mouth and swallowed them down with the water, then turned to Steve with her most winning smile. “You know I'm just playing it all up to get you to pamper me.”
“Aye, the Lady Sif is always pleased to test her mettle against another warrior of her sex. I do not know when I could arrange such a meeting, however. It may be some time.”
“I really, really need you to introduce me to that woman,” Natasha snickered. “Better yet, she should come stay here awhile.”
“She was the only person who always believed that I would be more. Do more,” he said roughly. “She never got to see it. Even if she hadn't gotten sick, she’d still be long gone by now.”
“Yeah, but I mean—you can get cuisine from anywhere on the globe in this city. I’d be more than happy to broaden your horizons.”
Stepping inside, Spidey realized the room was actually a big sphere-- the floor sloped in perfect match to the ceiling. There was a door on the exact opposite side of the room.
Steve stared into the open, gaping abyss in front of him. At the edges of his vision he saw… objects– strange, lost things, totally unidentifiable in the all-encompassing gloom. He wanted nothing more than to stay far away from it all, but the things forgotten in that murky place couldn’t be allowed to let lie.
“Ignore,” Tony barks. He doesn’t want to talk to Pepper right now. She’ll know immediately that something is wrong. And although their boundaries have always been fuzzy, Tony’s pretty sure that if there’s a line anywhere, it’s right around ‘complaining to your ex about your new lover not wanting to marry you.’
However, it seemed that he didn't cover up his groan as well as he thought as Banner and Thor frowned in concern, Banner's eyes flickering to the still-bleeding injury before he nodded his head in realisation, "I would refrain from moving this arm too much in the coming months, Tony, if you're not careful you could collapse from blood loss." Then, the Doctor stepped away for a second before coming back with a damp wash-cloth and, without further words, he started to clean up the blood from Tony's arm, rubbing between each individual finger and every dip of the slowly depleting muscles of his arms. Tony kept a straight face throughout the whole thing, controlling himself enough to keep the heated blush from rising to his cheeks; for some reason, he felt like he was being sexually harassed by his alternate best friend... He did
“What happened?” Rhodey demands. He sounds combative, which, admittedly, warms Tony somewhat. He almost smiles, even.
“You didn’t hear the way he said no,” Tony says, and it’s hard, it’s hard to talk around this hollow gaping thing in his throat. “He, uh. He really meant it.”
Tony turned in his arms, laughing, to rest his head on Steve’s shoulder. His arms went around Steve’s stomach, still in his uniform. “God, I bet all this wet leather is a crime on you,” he grinned.
It didn’t take long for the first anomaly to show up — down in the lobby, while Secretary Pierce was trying to get Tony to hand over the Tesseract.
Tony wanted that—the warmth and sweetness and comfort—with Steve. Forever. He’d thought, maybe, Steve wanted that with him, too, but it turned out it was just another thing he couldn’t have.
“No.” Tony says fervently, and he laughs, eyes wide and wondering and, maybe, a little wet. “Don’t you dare respond to that, I am wearing sweatpants—“
Steve didn’t startle, but only because he’d heard the gentle shuffle of feet on a carpet beforehand.
CAP AND IRON MAN’S SECRET TRYST— SECRET IDENTITIES, SECRET LOVE, SECRET BABY! JUICY DETAILS FROM AN ASTONISHING SOURCE! PG. 36!
Steve pushes off the doorframe and comes over, gripping Tony on either side of his shoulders and turning him gently so that he can massage Tony’s back. “Sounds fun,” he says, kneading firmly at Tony’s shoulders. “Wanna talk about it?”
“More than I am right now, but less than I will be if this falls through,” Pepper says, heels clicking as she leads him into his office.
“Not if you’re up to it,” Steve said. “If there are going to be more riddles, we could use all the brainpower we’ve got.”
“I wouldn’t be surprised,” Steve said, and sat down across from Tony with his own sandwich. “Say, I was thinking-- would you like to get dinner with me sometime?”
It’s Tony. He has a blanket draped over one arm, a bowl of something steaming, and several bottles of things that probably taste nasty.
The answer to that question was quite a lot, as it happened — including but not limited to footage of the Hulk half-heartedly kicking at a fire hydrant at the same time as he was also filmed enthusiastically using a Chitauri footsoldier as a flail, and JARVIS’ scans of the arc reactor picking up miniscule boot-shaped footprints on the inner mechanisms.
“What? No,” Iron Man denied, but Steve saw the way the joints of the armor had hesitated between steps, a full-body flinch hidden by the armor’s bulk.
“Ascending,” JARVIS said, and Steve’s stomach dropped as the elevator ascended far more rapidly than usual.
“No,” Tony says quickly, because he doesn’t want Steve to get murdered. "No. I just overheard this conversation— someone asked him if we’d considered getting married, and, well. Ha. No. He hadn’t.”
Despite the seriousness in Iron Man’s voice, he refused to speak further until they were back at the Tower, leaving the mood in the Quinjet strange and fraught with tension.
Tony shook with laughter, burying his face in Steve’s neck. “God, I love you,” he grinned– and then froze.
Tony laughed, muffled, into the blanket he was using to dry his hair. “That’s one way to put it, I suppose. My poor armor.”
“Weird. He practically had the shakes about getting the Cube from me,” Tony said absently. “Wait, — you guys saw that, right? No one kicked the case, it just went flying, and…”
“What do you mean?” Natasha looked up at him, smiling a little bemusedly. “I've loved you for years.”
“You need a place to stay, big guy? I’d say you can crash on my couch but I don’t think you’d fit, and also I can do way better with my accommodations than a couch,” Stark said. “You’re all welcome to stay, as a matter of fact. This floor has several guest suites.”
“Assemble!” Storm cried, attacking a tentacle with a blast of lightning. A smell not unlike a fish fry filled the air.
Stark had his hand in his face, rubbing at the bridge of his nose. Steve just tilted his head back, letting the bag of frozen lima beans slip from the cut on his forehead to cover his eyes.
“Now that’s just not fair,” Iron Man said, and shot into the air, blasting it with his repulsors. The ghostly minotaur shook its massive bull head and snarled, focusing its strange dull eyes on everyone’s favorite red-and-gold distraction.
“Do you recognize personal space?” Tony laughs, holding the wrap away from the cat. It follows the movement of his hand with its head.
“Okay, okay, that’s fine,” he soothes, cradling the cat in his arms, and he can feel its heartbeat rapid with alarm underneath his hands.
, maybe,” Tony said waspishly. “Do you know how much they cost? And each time you break one I have to redesign it
Steve reels him in, and Tony lets him, lets Steve tuck his arms around Tony and lean against his shoulder, tilting their heads together.
The fluorescents are harsh, washing everything out, and Tony is hit with a wave of exhaustion. God, he just wants to curl up in a shitty motel bed with Steve and sleep.
“We should call the others back,” Tony said. “Figure out how we’re gonna expose Hydra without, you know, massive amounts of death and betrayal.”
“I’ll keep it back, you guys move,” Iron Man said. He was playing bullfighter in earnest now, goading the beast into attacking and dancing out the way just in time. It really didn’t like the repulsors, for some reason, although they didn’t seem to hurt it either.
Tony pressed a button on his shiny chrome coffee machine and turned around, leaning back against the counter. “Don’t worry, Cap,” he smiled warmly, “no need to fight the Fourth Estate today.”
He pulls the meat out of his wrap, clicking his tongue at the kitty, and still it just stares. It’s not until Tony dangles a slice of turkey over the edge of the bench that the cat pads quickly over and snatches the meat from his hands.
Steve obeys, and the soup feels so good on his sore throat. He hums a little and takes another sip. “This is good,” he says quietly, and drinks again.
Steve tested it, working his jarred shoulder gingerly. “Feels like a sprain,” he grimaced. “Not too bad though.”
“Every day of my life,” Steve said, and exhaled slowly. One hand rested in Tasha’s hair, heavy and warm, and maybe the pain meds were starting to take effect, because she was starting to feel warm and heavy too.
Kamala, from the first day, was a quick study, if overeager to the point of clumsiness. Eventually she stopped squeaking every time he spoke to her.
“Geez, Tony, you look like you’ve been put through the ringer,” he says. Tony looks at Steve, and desperately wants to stretch out all over him and sleep for a year, but, well.
“Hey,” Steve says, trotting into the kitchen, still scrubbing the back of his head with a towel. Natasha waves her spoon at him in greeting, still chewing on a mouthful of Fruit Loops.
He feels the shift as Tony turns his head, and then Tony’s lips press against Steve’s skin, soft, just for a second. “Goodnight,” Tony whispers back.
“This is bullshit,” Steve rasps out loud, mouth twisting bitterly. But talking was probably a bad idea, he realizes, as his breathing quickly dissolves into a painful coughing fit. Each cough racks at his chest, tightening the squeeze on his lungs.
Pain came creeping in. Sharp and unwelcome and intruding on their easy morning, aching fiercely no matter how intent Tasha was on sleeping through it.
Mr. Stark is down that hallway and two doors down on the left it’s a big room you can’t miss it. Sorry bye!”
They were sitting next to each other in barstools, curled toward each other like parentheses. The photographer got Steve in profile, grinning down at Natasha, while Natasha was in three-fourths, mid-laugh with her head tilted up toward Steve.
“She loved me. She sang to me when I was sick. She used to come watch me build things and pretend to be my assistant. I loved her too, but I was always—” she stopped and propped herself up on Steve’s chest, meeting his eyes, solemn and blue. “I was so sure I would end up like her,” she said softly. “In love and unhappy and unwilling to leave.”
“No, we need to get you out of here,” Iron Man snapped. “The temperature in here has just hit the negative double digits. I’m taking Logan’s route,” he said, and fired his repulsors full force at the nearest wall.
Steve still wasn’t sleeping much. His therapist told him not to feel discouraged, but it was hard not to struggle with the contrast between his days, which he had come to enjoy, and the nights, which he inevitably dreaded.
There were other roses. Pepper, on his right, was a very fragrant coral orange rose— Tony had to admit she smelled nicer than him. On his left was Rhodey, a dusky blue rose with a subtler, perfumy fragrance, but his blooms were the biggest in the whole garden. There was also Happy, all the way up by the mailbox, with bright yellow flowers. Of course, Rhodey and Pepper were both a good, proper several feet away, and Happy was so far Tony couldn’t quite tell what variety he was meant to be, and anyway, there was a reason red was a classic.
Tony’s eyebrows shot up. “Ooh, plot twist. Bye now.” His fingers wiggled inside the gauntlet, a wave and a threat.
“It’s your right shoulder, correct?” she asked. Steve nodded. “Mr. Stark, please help him remove the upper part of his costume. I need to have a look.”
“I let Loki distract me,” Steve responded. “You can’t help that your heart device malfunctioned, but I let Loki throw me off with a bunch of lies about—“ He broke off.
Even this brat wilted under Captain America’s disapproval. “Some guy gave it to me. None of your business,” he muttered.
He leaned dangerously from atop his stepladder (found underneath a shoebox of frayed wires– recyclable) to wave the box triumphantly in Steve’s face.
What he did do was supplement Steve’s laborious Google searches with recommended reading materials, links to library books, and YouTube video tutorials.
But his right hand was linked with Steve’s, their fingers intertwined and resting on Steve’s thigh. Tony's thumb stroked quietly against his skin, a small, unconscious sort of movement.
“You could have just ordered some from a bakery,” Steve said. “I’m sure someone would have been willing to do an express order this big.”
“I’d recognize that furrow in your brow anywhere,” a dry voice said. “What are you doing picking up a tabloid, Cap?”
Steve bit back the urge to ask Pepper if she was sure again. He definitely didn't think Pepper was the sort to play mean tricks like that. “I just don't want to mess up what we have,” he said instead, hearing the weakness of the excuse in his voice. “I don't know what I would do if things went wrong and we couldn't be friends anymore, and… things tend to go wrong, for me.”
Stark sighed. “Yeah, alright, I see how it is. You crazy kids are too cool for school. What about you, Captain?”
“With Loki on the loose, it might be a good idea to knock the rough edges off of this teamwork thing,” Barton said.
“Then why’d you’d say that shit about Bucky?” Steve snarled. “I suppose you needed the distraction—”
SHIELD agents began to swarm the Mall, and Logan passed the Enigma off to them. “On that note,” he said, turning to Cap. “Maybe you two can settle something.”
“No. No hitches at all, Mr. Secretary,” Agent Sitwell was saying. The elevator doors opened, and Steve saw himself step on.
She took his hand in hers, lifting it up to press a kiss to his knuckles. “The lingerie helped though.”
Tony drops his bags, kicks off his shoes, and faceplants onto the bed. It smells a little musty, but Tony could not care less. “C’mere,” he says into the blankets, and thumps his arm on the bed beside him.
Steve opened the door with a strangely lightweight feeling in his chest, stepping into a room that was indeed
“And then, aglow with righteous fury, the Lady Sif approached the knave with the goat in tow, and tossed the beast into the man’s bed, which went as well for him as you might imagine—“ Thor stopped to drink something brown and alcoholic, which he downed like it was Gatorade, and to let his audience chuckle.
Steve let the shield loose, aiming it to go through the minotaur with three different ricochets. It stamped its feet each time the shield passed through, but seemed most infuriated by the clang of the vibranium on the labyrinth walls.
“I’m really just saying, that guy was shifty as hell,” Tony said, watching as Pierce grabbed his own forearm. “Aaannnd there I go. Ouch.”
“It’s good to meet you. I’m sorry for being, ah. Early?” Steve’s ears burned. Now he was stammering like Kamala.
“I thought it would be nice if we made it especially for them. You know?” Tony sighed. “I’m starting to realize it would probably be just as special if Captain America and Iron Man bought cookies just for them.”
“Anyway, it just kind of snowballed from there,” Natasha added gloomily. “It was the worst thing. Every time I thought I was getting over it I would find you doing something else utterly unbearable— reading old science fiction in the library, or researching microwaves, or— I don't know, darning your socks. It was all very frustrating.”
Purple mist exploded into the air around them, obscuring anything more than half a foot ahead of their noses. Jan lurched sideways, grabbing Ororo’s hand before she could lose track of her in the commotion.
Tasha shrugged. “Maybe they were before I was born. Maybe when I was little. But he wasn't a very good parent, and they fought about it a lot.
Barton was sitting on the counter of the medical waiting room they were all crowded into, his head ducked slightly to fit underneath the cupboards on the ceiling. Romanoff, the last Steve looked, had been sitting in a battered office chair pulled up next to his thigh, working her way through a cheap-looking wine cooler.
Steve is very nearly asleep when Tony speaks again. “It was a nice cat,” he murmurs, and Steve drifts into sleep.
Steve makes a face at her. “I just mean— I’m not sure what I mean, exactly. But you— as someone who’s spied on him, or just as his friend, maybe—“
“I’ll drink to that,” Tony said, and tipped his fresh mug of coffee in Steve’s direction before taking a long sip. Steve couldn’t help but wince, knowing full well how hot that machine made coffee, but Tony didn’t even flinch. “What’s on your agenda for today, Cap?”
“Yes,” Tony said, looking terribly guilty. “Now you know. Cap, I-- I’m sorry. I never should have kept this from you as long as I did, I just didn’t know what you would think.”
Tony’s face shutters. “I heard you say you couldn’t possibly marry me,” he says flatly. “And then I, uh. Left.”
“Alright,” Steve said, bemused. Still, it wasn’t the first time he’d seen one of the bots just wandering around. Tony said it was fine; that they’d return to the labs once they needed to recharge and that the students bugged him until he let them roam free.
Tony settled the ice pack on Steve’s swollen shoulder. Steve hissed a little at the feeling, at the bite of cold numbing the pain.
Steve had gamely picked out several dozen by the time they got to a rather old one: a sneaky shot of them at a restaurant from nearly five years ago.
Steve tilted his head back up with a sigh, letting the frozen beans fall into his hand. “I don’t think anyone could’ve asked more from you than what you did,“ Steve said, meeting Stark’s eyes. “You were a distraction. But I got my ass thoroughly kicked by Loki because my head wasn’t in the game.”
“I don’t think we’ve seen the floor for at least three years, Steve,” Tony said, eyes flicking around the shadows. “This is clearly a job for professionals.”
“I’m sorry,” he continues, quiet. “I’m really fucking sorry. But hey, maybe I’ll miraculously go into remission and you’ll never have to know anyway, right?” He says, and squeezes the steering wheel. “I should’ve taken you to Aruba,” he blurts. “We could do better than shitty motels, in Aruba. Spend a lot of time naked, probably. I could rent out an entire beach and have anyone who smoked near you shot.”
Iron Man pointed. Steve looked up. Sure enough, about twenty feet down the path there was a low wooden threshold. The middle of the frame had a golden plaque on it, too far away for him to read.
“Nah,” Tony replies. “I haven’t caught a cold in years—there’s too much alcohol in my system. All the germs get drunk and have to call their designated drivers.”
Natasha looked great in it — her hair was longer then, past her shoulders, and she was wearing a maroon blazer that had gotten a sleeve burnt off of it six months later.
“Ghost minotaur,” Storm said. Her white hair billowed around her as she directed a vicious gust at the thing-- the minotaur-- that was barrelling through her winds. “We can’t hit it!”
Tony closes his eyes. “It was a stupid idea anyway,” he says, and slides the ring box into the trash.
When he finally gets settled, the electric blanket tucked up to his neck, he looks up to see Tony staring over at him with an odd expression on his face. He looks… almost transfixed.
Steve watched, bemused, as the hand grew in size to cover the whole bottom half of her face. She caught him staring and whipped the hand behind her back.
“Ignore,” Tony replies, and drags himself to his feet, pulling the blanket with him. Even with it draped over his shoulders, he feels shiveringly cold.
“Android babies are not as cute as Peter,” Steve says, closing his eyes. Tony’s heart thumps steadily under his ear.
There was a bang and a muffled curse. The legs started wriggling as the person attached to them squirmed backwards, and then heaved themself back onto the floor.
“That’s not a thing, is it?” Tony asked, glancing at Natasha. His hands were still rubbing up and down Steve’s shoulders. “I mean, neo-Nazis, you see those, unfortunately, but Hydra was a whole different beast. Nobody’s Hydra anymore.”
“No. Maybe. I don’t know,” Steve frowns, glaring at his bacon. “It’s not that he’s been— he seems a little off, sometimes, but I just… have a feeling.”
He couldn’t quite bring himself to pull away, turning one kiss into two into several, long and drawn-out and unwilling to part. Natasha’s breath fanned out over his face in the brief gaps between kisses, warm and minty.
“Don’t,” he says quietly, tugging his hand away. He knows how he looks right now—all of him skinny and pale, his arms so thin that they’re mostly bone.
Steve sits on the edge of the bed. “Were you going to tell me?” he asks, and Tony, uncomprehending, flips onto his back.
feel like he had to punch something or else the red-hot wounded thing underneath his skin would come tearing its way out of him. That was progress—the nice therapist SHIELD assigned him to said so.
“I love you,” he said again, and there it was, that tender sort of ache in his chest that seemed to lay him totally bare every time Steve so much as looked at him. “Steve, I–” he broke off, eyes closing. His hand cupped Steve’s face. Christ, he wanted to– to crawl under Steve’s skin, to bury himself in Steve’s heartbeat and his strong hands and his quiet smile. He just… “I just love you,” he whispered.
Steve’s ears burned. “I know it’s inappropriate, and, well, obviously unwelcome. I shouldn’t have tried asking him out anyway. God knows he’s out of my league.”
There’s a bottle of whiskey on Tony’s worktable. He really kind of wishes there weren’t, but he put it there, so he supposes this is his fault as well.
“Thank you for coming, Avengers,” a woman in SHIELD gear greeted them, reaching out to shake Storm’s hand, then Cap’s. “As you can see, this is a little beyond SHIELD’s paygrade.”
“I love you too,” he said, pressing a kiss to the corner of her mouth. “Of course I do. Can I stay?”
“Not just us,” Storm said. “Batroc sent a letter apologizing for trying to set you up when you were already in a relationship with, well. With Iron Man. He thought.”
“Strong,” he answered immediately. “I still feel like she's the strongest person I've ever known. Even when she was starving and exhausted and sick I thought... she could do anything.”
“You really want to drag me into this, huh,” Bruce groaned. “Did you miss all the times the U.S. Government has sent tanks after me?”
“Natasha wasn’t in love with me then,” Steve said. “I’ll admit I was carrying a torch, but she had better things to do than mope over me.”
Tony leaned over the table to read the front page, and had a-- a face journey, Peter would call it. First he blinked a lot, his ears going pink, and then his mouth dropped partially open. He glanced up at the ceiling in a god-help-me kind of way, his lips pressed tightly together as if containing laughter, and finally looked down and saw something-- probably the “baby bump”-- and burst into peals of hysterical laughter.
“You’re welcome to try and peel it off of me,” Steve said dryly. “And I don’t even mean that in the sexy way. You’ll probably have to cut me out of it.”
“People are kind of frothing at the mouth right now,” Romanoff pointed out. “It couldn’t hurt to put in some visible volunteer hours, maybe release a statement.”
Tony can keep this. Steve, with him. He just has to quash that foolish unwanted longing and focus on Steve, on making him feel so loved that he’ll stay. He loves Steve enough to marry him— he has to be capable of doing at least that much.
“It wouldn’t be right,” Steve adds softly. “Until marriage equality is granted all across America. It’s not fair that we should have that right because of sheer dumb geographic luck, while this country refuses to recognize other marriages like, uh. Like ours. Would be.”
“That’s okay — trust me,” Loki said. Then he leaned forward as if to whisper, Sitwell ducking toward it. “Hail Hydra.”
“But try and stay back from the fight unless it’s really dire,” Storm advised, taking the lead through the entrance as they all walked into the dark.
“Alright, let’s just… take a break,” Iron Man said, and guided Steve to sit down against the wall. Whatever kind of heater was in the armor, it was cranking out at full force.
Then he picks up the ring, setting it delicately on the worktable at a safe distance from the velvet box.
Logan grunted as his claws dragged along the wall with a nails-on-chalkboard screech, finally managing to dig one in to stop his freefall. Unfortunately, the room continued to spin in such a way that he was sent flapping around like a flag.
Tony started stretching towards the ceiling, so Steve stood quickly to let Tony brace a hand on his shoulder. Light flooded the closet.
“SHIELD is on your side, Bruce,” Natasha said. “That’s not nothing. And Fury wasn’t the only person unimpressed by Ross’ performance on bringing you in.”
—oh heavens, this was a losing battle if he’d ever fought one. He was as famously prone to flushing as any of his Irish ancestors.
It tasted amazing too, and made him feel a little better about the idea of facing the footage of Loki handing him his ass.
“You have all fought valiantly today,” Thor spoke finally. “Loki escaped because such is his talent, perhaps above all else. To bring him to justice was my task, and I have failed it, but without your intervention my failure might have been even graver than what we see now.” He looked around the room, taking time to make eye contact with all of them except Banner, who was snoring faintly. “For that, I thank you.”
And he’s been noticing this for a while, but… Tony is exhausted. All the time. Steve ambushes Tony with multivitamins several times, because he’s so pale he almost looks—
“I’m taking a teaching position,” Steve replied, and had to stop moving as the girl whirled around to stare at him with enormous eyes.
“I love you too, Tony,” Steve says softly, and pulls away. Tony quickly schools his face into something drowsy and neutral, and Steve’s gaze flicks over Tony’s face, scrutinizing.
It was probably a good thing that Steve felt tired, looking out over the borough, instead of bitter or burdened or bereaved.
Tony wants— he just wants to give Steve everything. Worldly possessions, comfort, the broken, disparate parts of himself. All the love he has to offer.
“I wasn’t lying earlier,” the other Rogers said calmly. “I’m here to give you the scepter. I was just going to leave it in the basement with a message, but I wanted to see you.”
“Well, thanks. Thanks for thanking us. You guys hungry? We had a good workout,” Stark said. “If you’re up for shawarma I’ll order in.”
“Yes. Wolverine, you go with Bruce and Spider-Man to the left. Giant Girl, you go with Storm down the middle. Iron Man, you’re with me. Let’s get this done, Avengers.”
Steve stiffened, but held back. It was a tight, warm, hug; Roger’s arms encircled Tony entirely and the front of his head was pressed against the side of Tony’s. Rogers’ eyes were squeezed shut tight. Tony, annoyingly, seemed to melt into it.
“I mean you should try asking your fiancée how long she’s been in love with you for. If the answer’s not approximately forever, I’ll eat my invite to New York Fashion Week.”
Steve catches one of Tony’s flailing hands and pulls it over his heart. “I wouldn’t be averse to a long engagement,” he says, smiling, and Tony loops his arm around Steve’s neck and kisses him hard.
,” Tony urges, and steps close enough that Steve can hear. “And it didn’t want to go in the pet carrier I bought but that’s okay because it let me hold it like this the entire way back and did not complain or anything. And now it’s purring,
He immediately wants to be asleep again. His limbs and head are heavy and numb, and when he sits up it rouses a yawning chasm inside his chest.
“You just punched a triceratops!” Tony emphasized, opening a storage compartment inside the Quinjet to look for blankets. Both of them were soaked to the bone– Steve in his leather and scale mail, Tony in his skin-tight undersuit. Neither of them were looking forward to the Herculean task of getting their wet clothes off.
He sounded so disgruntled that Steve couldn’t help but smile a little. “Let me guess. You hate magic?”
“I don’t like these bags under your eyes,” Steve says, frowning. “And you look… you look sad. Sometimes. I worry—“
“I’ll be the judge of that, I think. Not that it’s not entirely possible,” Rhodey adds, and Tony can hear him grinning, "but you’re not exactly an objective source.”
“Start it up, J,” Tony said. “I’m gonna review the diagnostic for the arc reactor, a little light multitasking.”
The other Rogers’ face shut down, and Steve’s stomach froze. He knew exactly what the other him was about to say.
“Captain?” Storm popped into the kitchen, holding her phone. “We’ve got a situation. Mr. Stark, if you would contact Iron Man?”
The footage of the lobby was still rolling, but the main players were gone: now there were just SHIELD agents, scrambling to set up a perimeter and secure the things they lost.
Natasha had first told him she loved him after a truly rotten day, full of arguments with government officials and reporters and her own employees. By the time she got back to the common floor, she’d been practically vibrating with tension and exhaustion.
It wasn’t until Steve was coming out of his shower, dressed in sweats and a t-shirt, that Iron Man approached him at all.
“Well, it did hit on my boyfriend,” Steve said, pulling the scale mail off over his head and dropping it aside.
Steve gestured helplessly. “Did you buy them in bulk from somewhere? There’s– at least forty blankets here, Tony.”
No sooner had he spoken than enormous tentacles appeared on the walls in a brief flash of mist, immediately lurching towards the nearest Avengers.
Steve smooths the covers back on his side of the bed, staring a bit forlornly at Tony’s side. He knows it’s silly— Tony is busy— but, well, Steve likes waking up next to Tony. He’s made it a personal goal to wake up beside Tony as often as he can, because missing it— missing Tony in the mornings always sends everything a little out of sync.
He switches off the blowtorch. “I can fix this,” he says raggedly, and is surprised by how desperate he sounds. How tightly he’s clutching at the ring he’d been about to destroy.
“Go to sleep,” Steve groans, and rolls over on top of Tony to squish the talkiness out of him. Tony makes an exaggerated wheezing sound, and Steve smiles where his face is smooshed into Tony’s skin.
Tony spent the winter curled inward, hibernating with his grief and refuting the condolences offered by Pepper and Rhodey. They tried to tell him that Steve’s death was nutritional, a soil deficiency, or even that perhaps Steve was simply an annual. But Tony knew the truth: Steve had died of a broken heart, and Tony was determined to follow him.
Distracted from Iron Man, the minotaur turned its attention to the other Avengers-- and began to charge.
Rogers huffed out a laugh. “Right,” he said, raising an eyebrow at Steve, and Steve felt his ears go pink.
“Down it is. Giant Girl, if you wouldn’t mind?” Storm pointed at the floor, beckoning the others back.
“Don’t ask, Cap,” Iron Man said firmly. “And for the love of country don’t Google it either. For the record, G, I’m with you on this one. It gets too close to life in this business.”
“The Secretary, Secretary Pierce. Sitwell was on the phone with him. You said he was shady,” Steve said.
Steve nods, jaw clenched too-tight. “Not really at first,” he says. “But then I heard you—I—“ he cuts off. “How sick are you?” he asks, softly, but so distraught and plaintive he might as well have shouted it.
"Doctor Banner, I have brought our dear friend here, as per your request," he pulled up Tony, lifting him off the floor and making Tony hiss in pain at the thunder god's bruising grip, "Where do you wish him placed?"
Banner pointed at the chair behind him, eyes now distracted by the notes on his clip board, "Just here."
The loss of Antony - pure hearted, good, trustworthy Antony - had taken its toll on Thor, sending him into grieving at the loss of a dear friend he had no idea he’d grown so close too before it was too late. However, with the reaction of the world to Antony’s death, the civilian that had given his life to the people of the world, trying to make up for wrongs that weren’t of his own doing. The man had been shot down into the Ocean by an ambushed attack that SHIELD had sent him into with the planted information. While Lady Pepper and the team grieved, the world sneered. They had taken everything from Antony, his time, his technology, his life, and all they could do was curse him and spit on his resting grounds; they called him incompetent and a villain before synthesising with the rest of the team for having to put up with the man. Thor had never felt more rage…
Rogers grinned back manically, his eyes seeming to take on a more crazed quality at hearing Tony's words. They wont take away his Tony again. Never! Not if he had any say about it! "I've killed all of your little friends before, Tony, I don't mind doing it again." he chuckled like he was remembering a good time drinking with friends on the street than reminiscing about killing past victims. It made Tony feel disgusted at the sight...
“Gah! Get off me!” Tony yelled as he kicked out, trying to manoeuvre himself into a better position so that he could dislodge the female assassin.
Natasha, or Other Natasha, or NotNat (whatever, he’d think of a nickname later!), seemed to snap out of it then, her round shocked eyes going to their normal lazy eyed look that made it seem like she was high, “No.” Came the flat response that held no emotion whatsoever, “In this universe your dead and the public have rejected us, deeming us too dangerous to let roam free. The world turned its back on us when we saved it multiple times… so we turned our backs on the world.”
He only looked up when Rogers stepped up to him, glaring down at him with chilling blue eyes that froze Tony' blood where he stood.
However, as the words processed in Tony's mind, he felt his shocked disbelieving smile fall from his face, his face rapidly draining of colour and dread settled like a cold heavy stone in his stomach.
Tony lunges for him. “You have your inhaler?” he asks, and Steve fumbles for his bag, manages to grab his inhaler, and takes a slow puff from the spacer, his free hand shaking in Tony’s grasp.
