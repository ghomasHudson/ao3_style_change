Okay, so, wow.  It has been a long time for this fic.  To those who have been patiently waiting, thank you so very, very much.  I was writing Celestial Navigation and Catching Lightning in a Bottle along with this one, and three WiPs at once was just too much for me. This one drew the short straw.  But, I never wanted to abandon it.  I'm going to try to work on it much more steadily while I also work on The Prize.
“Dude, I cannot believe you had an Elvis impersonator officiate.  That? Was awesome,” Foggy said. “The shrimp are delicious, by the way.  Matt, you gotta try the shrimp, man, I’m telling you.”
The passenger side door of the SUV opened, and Steve hopped out.  He had one of those soft-sided warming bags in one hand with the name of a local deli in curving golden script on one side.  Tony could hear a low murmur of voices as Steve said something to the SUV’s driver, who put the car in reverse and gunned the engine fast enough to convince Tony the guy’s last mission involved an enchanted Ford Anglia and Hagrid’s questionable friend choices.
“I know,” Tony breathed out with a burst of surprise at the realization, almost a laugh, but too shaky for that.  “Sometimes, it doesn’t seem possible.  But,” he continued, reaching up and pulling at the chain around his neck, drawing out the tags and holding them in his metal-covered hand for a moment before letting them fall to his chest, dangling a few inches above the reactor.  “I do know.”
“I’m always serious about BARF,” Tony corrected.  “As of one minute ago. As of now. Don’t look at me like that, I said I’d work on it.”
“And did you get the best person that way?” Tony asked, his voice quiet.
“Clint is absolutely not tutoring our kids, Tony,” Steve grumbled.  “The kids we are not discussing right now,” Steve reminded him sternly, sounding somewhat indignant.  Perhaps Tony did currently have something of a minor advantage in this conversation.  A good Alpha probably wouldn’t make use of circumstances like this to get his way.  Tony rocked forward, letting his knot brush harder against the cluster of nerves, earning a hiss from Steve.
Steve
“Of course.  You’ll like them, I think.  They’re smart.  Like you.  Or, maybe not like you, but smart,” Steve amended with a quick, rueful look at Tony.  “I just have to meet with Fury.  Won’t take long,” Steve told him.
He picked up the catalog again and let it sit in his lap unopened.  The memory of the day they went shopping, when the salesman tried to talk Tony into a way to show gratitude that involved a bit more in the way of sheer fabric than Tony had thought was strictly necessary, flashed through his mind.  He remembered being embarrassed by the suggestion. By Steve possibly knowing about the suggestion, even though it hadn’t even been Tony’s doing.  Now, he was sitting here in his garage thinking about ways to flirt via Amazon Prime.
“Never thought this whole prostitute thing would end with a dorky artist boyfriend,” Tony said, glancing down the empty hallway.  “More like…chlamydia.”
Steve flinched out of reach without really quite meaning to, but the thought that they weren’t supposed to touch him was too ingrained at this point to do anything else. Don’t let them, not once, Natasha’s words echoed in his head. If they do, walk away, because if you stay, they’re going to take that as permission, so it was half-instinct at this point to jerk away, though by the startled look on Stark’s face, he’d taken it entirely the wrong way. He had kissed the man in the police station, so the confusion was certainly understandable, he could freely admit. That was part of the show, though, and he’d learned to do that. Perform. Slip into a role and tuck himself deep inside it so it didn’t consume him.
“Feeding Arty. Articus. The camel,” Steve said.
“A dangerous combination, no doubt,” Peggy agreed with a smile.  She cast a quick glance at the camera, her eyes going soft and fond for a moment, something private passing there that Steve missed.
Slowly, the not-gel in the cylinder around his cock stirred to life. Tony groaned and turned his head as far as he could towards the alien.  The alien chanted again, almost under his breath, like a whisper against Tony’s skin. He tried to squirm a bit, but then let out a soft, raspy moan as the cylinder expanded and contracted around his cock.  A wave of pleasure hit him, hot and hard, pooling low in his belly.
“Wait, who said what?  No, no, no, that—no.  We have not released an official statement.  You’ll get it at the same time everyone else does, Diane.  I don’t know where that’s coming from.  I mean, I don’t disagree—Mr. Stark is, as you know, very concerned with—yes.  Yes, he is.  I’m not confirming or denying anything right now.  Well—“ Ms. Potts broke off, hands going to her hips as she listened to whatever the other person was saying.  “Well, yes.  I would—in theory, I would agree with those statements, of course, but I can’t—at this time, I can’t give you anything more definitive than that.  Okay.  Fine.  You’ll be the first call, I promise,” she finished, then looked up at the table, gaze darting between Steve and Tony.
“Not because you’d be intruding.  Well. Not exactly.  It’s just…its hard.  To watch, I mean.  I went a couple of times, at the beginning, but, man, it’s depressing as hell.  I mean, me, the rest of the vets there, none of us could ever do this stuff.  See something beautiful, the way Stevie could.  ‘Hold up, Buck, I wanna sketch this real quick for later,’” Barnes quoted from memory, shaking his head.  “We didn’t lose anything, see? This glass thing, it’s fun and neat, and we all sit around joshing about the war and complaining about the VA, but Steve…he wants to be good at this so badly.  Like, in his head, he can see it, just like before.  But he can’t get his body to cooperate.”
Tony just stared at him, mouth working, but no sound coming out.  That couldn’t be right.  Could. Not.  He would have noticed if Steve had been, what?  Asking him out?  That was ridiculous.  They’d been friends, and sure, Steve had spent a lot of time in the workshop or garage, and true, Tony had done a lot of the talking, but they’d done other things, too.  The occasional movie.  The Star Trek marathon.  Sparring.
Talking to tin cans and seriously considering calling astrophysicists for relationship advice?  Not good, Tones.  Not good, Tony hummed to himself in Rhodey’s voice.
Steve pushed open the door and stepped inside, coming to an abrupt halt just past the doorway. There was a black, Shield-issued duffel bag in one hand that spelled out Rogers on the side in yellow letters and a large, leather satchel in the other. He'd forgotten, or chosen not to think about, exactly how much room Steve seemed to take up, all shoulders and arms, impossible angles and curves, like Hephaestus had sculpted him out of the clay left over from Pandora.
“Oh,” Tony managed, craning his neck to look down the driveway.
Definitely was not thinking about how Steve’s hands would feel, rubbing the soft, silky material over Tony’s skin.  How Steve would look at him, eyes dark, hungry, admiring gaze roving over Tony.  How Tony would start to strip the garment off with shaking hands, but Steve would stop him, push Tony’s hands above his head and tell him to keep them there.  How Steve could slide his fingers under the lacy straps and peel them down from Tony’s shoulders.
Clan were smaller than the Stranger, but sturdy and heavily muscled.  Anto thought of the man at the last Gathering who had his nose flattened and two teeth missing.  Tyber’s doing, Anto knew, though not over some Omega, but because Tyber had been angry at missing his chance on the hunt and accused the man of taking his kill, though the man had offered him half, as was custom.  Tyber had signaled Anto that night, he remembered, thinking about downcast eyes and heavy silence that hung in the air as he knelt and presented. They didn’t understand Tyber’s interest any more than Anto did, or why he was different with Anto than with other clan Omegas, but he was Omega and Tyber was Alpha and their leader, and they wouldn’t think to question it.  If anything, Anto, as undesirable as he was, should be grateful for Tyber’s interest. Perhaps the spirits would even grant him a child, if he pleased his Alpha well enough.
“That’s Steve,yeah,” Brock agreed around a laugh. He swiped a hand over his mouth and looked over at Steve with a bit of an apology.  Steve grimaced and did roll his eyes this time.
“Headed to the briefing?” Coulson asked, holding one of those electronic tablets to his chest where he stopped across the hall from Steve.  He could give the folders to Coulson.  Tell Coulson exactly what Fury could do with his little scheme.
“You like that, eh?” Tony surmised.  “Well, you’re gonna love this.”  Tony crooked his fingers, hooking them up and pressing further into Steve’s body, feeling Steve’s inner walls firm and then relax, until he found the tight bundle of nerves and stroked against it with the tips of his fingers.
“Are you—are you sure?” Tony asked, a nauseating hesitancy filling his stomach now that he’d actually gotten what he wanted.  What had possessed him?  This was crazy.  He swallowed down and tasted bile.  Steve was laughing, but this was serious.  Like, the illegal kind of serious.  Steve worked for the government.  They could get in trouble.  Real trouble. The kind that came with records and handcuffs and probably a call to Director Fury’s office for something more than a stern talking to.  “Really, it isn’t a big deal.  I mean.  I can always call Happy.  Like you said.”
“Does it feel like it with him?” Maria asked.
Whatever.
, Tony.  We don’t know that,” Rhodey said, voice going low and quiet. “We just don’t know.”
“Isn’t this about the time you swoop in and do your thing?” Natasha asked, sidling up in the space next to him at the bar.  Tony looked down from the mirror that hung over the back of the bar offering a reflection of the ballroom and peered into the glass of amber liquid that was cupped in his hand, held almost protectively between where his elbows bent on the wood of the bar.  He ran a finger up and down the smooth surface, catching a drop of condensation on his thumb and rhythmically spreading it up and down the frosted glass, leaving clear, wet streaks in its wake.  With more effort than should have been required, he forced the leg that was propped up on the brass railing that traced the bottom of the bar to stop tapping out a tarantella against the metal.
He thought Tony probably understood a lot about him.
Steve shuffled a few things around on the large conference table and beneath the t-shirts and kids’ bedding, there was a stack of mock-up posters, one for each Avenger.  Well, except for him, apparently.  There was no Captain America poster.  Steve frowned a bit, and was on the cusp of asking her why not, though a part of him hesitated because that seemed a tad egotistical, didn’t it?  But then he caught sight of the Iron Man poster and his frown deepened.  It was the suit.  Just the suit.  Glowing eyes, red and gold paint, repulors held up at the ready.  Gorgeous, and the artist had certainly done a good job, Steve had to admit.
“I—thank you,” Steve said, feeling his cheeks heat at the compliment.  He ducked his head, but squeezed Tony’s hand for a moment before releasing it.  “Master Len, he is a good teacher.”
“Steve,” Tony said evenly. Steve pulled his eyes from the table to look over at Tony sitting next to him, though Tony could see the effort it took. “I see you. I will always see you. Sometimes, I know you think you’re all I see, but that’s not it, not really. It’s more…it’s backwards. I don’t know how to explain it either. Everything I see is you. You’re like this filter that I process the world through, and everything just…it’s brighter. Better. I can’t—I can’t—it’s clear. It’s just clear. And that’s you, because it sure as hell isn’t me.”
Steve closed his eyes.  Let the pain of it lift him higher.  He heard Tony curse, and suddenly felt empty as Tony’s fingers left him.  Steve smiled. Breathed.  Went higher.  He turned his head the other way and pinpricks of painful relief burst through one nipple while the other burned hot and taut with the pull of it.  A rustle of clothes, and soon, Steve felt the thick, blunt head of Tony’s cock at his entrance.  It was warm and slick from the oil, but still too big.  It would hurt.  It would feel good. It didn’t matter. He went higher.
“Wakanda,” Steve said.
Steve heard Tony shift on the bed as he rolled over onto his back and let out a long, drawn out sigh. He could almost hear the pause in the air as Tony looked at him. “A traditionalist, huh?” Tony said, trying for wry, probably, but sounding inordinately pleased by the sight of Steve kneeling naked by the bed, cock hard and head bowed, waiting for his Alpha to acknowledge him. Tony sighed again, though Steve could tell it was purely for effect, then Steve felt the weight of Tony’s hand settle on his head, sliding down to cup his jaw and lift his head so he could look Tony in the eye.
God, he couldn’t
“Anyway, I’ll have to file a report.  Just wanted to let you know,” Coulson said.  Steve couldn’t tell if Coulson sounded resigned or excited at the prospect.
A welcoming party greeted them, and ushered them through the building and out the back, where the canyon opened up below a glass walkway that jutted out from the rock in an arc, seeming to float above the steep drop.  There was a table at the center, Steve saw, and several white-coated waitstaff nearby.
“See?  You’re making me a better person already,” Tony said flatly, then huffed out a low laugh and swiped a hand over his mouth.  “It’s really annoying,” he added, then frowned.  “Great.  Great, just great.  Now, I’m thinking of designs for a more efficient toothpaste delivery device.  Don’t you dare laugh.  This is probably going to keep me up tonight,” Tony grumbled, though he had to bite his lip to hold back his smile.
“You don’t love him,” Tony insisted, keeping his eyes trained on the fire crackling in the hearth.
“Anything else?” Tony asked with a flash of annoyance.
He could hear light, quick movements next door. Drawers opening and closing. The closet door sliding back and forth. The springs on the bed squeaking as something heavy was placed on it.
“I am glad you approve,” Tony replied.  “You are free to use it, as you will.  I would have offered it earlier, had I thought of it.  There’s a bailey outside for bow and spear practice, a joust and arena for horsemanship.  Those areas are oft used by the Court or their officers, but this is private, save for myself and Rhodey, here, when he manages to rouse himself from his General’s chair and do some actual training.”
“I—wha—what?” Steve stammered as his hands juddered against the easel for no reason and one knee knocked into the small table next to him with his can of brushes and jars of paints, as if Kirk’s words were some kind of reflex test his body wanted to make sure he passed.   “You—I—we.”
“Huh?” Kirk said, then looked down at himself. “Oh.”
The carriage finally ground to a stop, finally, just in front of the inn, where the crowd of people were parted around a long, gold-trimmed red carpet that had been rolled out across the ground all the way to the door of the inn. Steve could see the top of Tony’s head between the soldiers and others who surrounded him, clamoring for his attention.  A murmur of voices rose up outside.  The crowd was calling for their King. And then…then him.
He could do that.  He could be good for Tony. And then he would be seen, not while he struggled, but when it was done, and he was
“Okay,” Tony said.
Steve shot Tony a wan look, which Tony returned with an even wider grin, and then walked to his workshop.  A moment later, Steve heard the scrape of his chair as Tony must have sat down at his worktable.  He looked over at Cam, who glanced back at him and wrung his hands together, then jerked his head towards the workshop, eyes widening with emphasis.
“Yes, hmmm,” the Lord said and made a sort of tsking sound, as if Steve were a naughty child.  “I see what our good overseer here meant.  Well.  We can’t have that, now can we?” the man asked while Steve glared up at him.  Maybe they would kill him.  He had stopped caring about making out of this alive a long time ago.  Now, he just wanted out.
“I’ll call Coulson,” Steve shrugged.  “Probably going to be some paperwork.”
Had he?  Looking back, Steve wasn’t sure what to think.  Steve had asked, that day a little over a month ago, up in Tony’s workshop.  He remembered his stomach feeling as if it was tied into knots while walking up the familiar winding staircase to the Tower.  Tony had been bent to some task at his work table.  One of those thick leather smithy gloves covered his hand to the elbow while he held some kind of instrument in the other hand, picking delicately at a steaming piece of metal Steve recognized from years of watching Tony work as a gear of some sort.
“Sorry, Professor,” Steve replied, giving Tony a frustrated look.  “Won’t happen again.”
“No,” Tony said quickly.  “No, I—just not that. Everything else is fine.  Better than fine, with you here. Really, Steve, I’m
“I am,” Pepper said, a smile in her voice.  “I’ll be over in a bit and take a look at what we’re dealing with.  I already have JARVIS pulling the property records, so I’ll find out about ownership and take care of that, along with our dear enforcer of justice first thing in the morning.  Legal is already drawing up the removal paperwork on him.  Think he’ll put up a fight?”
Steve walked into Bucky’s room and pulled a navy V-neck off one of the hangers and quickly switched it for the shirt he was wearing.  It shouldn’t matter so much, except that, for whatever reason, he didn’t want Tony to see him in the same clothes over and over.  He chanced a quick look in the small mirror above Bucky’s chest of drawers and smoothed his hair down.
The smaller man who had been with Director Fury at the house two nights ago greeted them at the entrance.  Agent Coulson, Tony learned, repeating the name in his head, though the flunky agents were all pretty much interchangeable, Tony figured.
“No,” Steve replied.  “I think Rhodes is right, but I wouldn’t give Stone the satisfaction.”
He thought he might hate his mother the most.  Her perfect mascara, not even a bit runny.  Dab, don’t wipe, he thought bitterly.  The way she held his hand and told him it was going to be alright, that he would be happy, that it was better this way.  All the things his father said, but didn’t really give two shits if they were true.  When she said those things, though…she actually believed them.  And that, that she really, truly did want this for him, hurt in a way he couldn’t quite comprehend.
“Character witness,” Matt replied.  “Colonel Chester Phillips, Retired.”
If you have not read that fic, I cannot imagine any of this will make a bit of sense.
Tony wasn’t sure why, wasn’t really thinking anything beyond lizard brain functions at the moment, but he shifted his stance slightly, lowering his hips and angling upward, using his knees to nudge Steve’s legs further apart as he did.  A second after he did, his body understood perfectly as the knot swelled, filling Steve even more, and attached, linking them together and keeping his seed in place.  He felt another wave of moist heat engulf his cock as it did, and heard himself emit a long, low moan of absolute pleasure, the feeling of being tethered like this, in some unspeakable, unbreakable way was overwhelming, almost too much to bear.  He was matched by Steve’s low, keening wail, building to some crescendo that only Steve could see.
By the end, though, he had twelve committee-approved notecards with lines that were generically responsive to almost any question he was likely to be asked without giving away any actual information.   He looked down at the new card in his hand.
So, yeah, he thought about it, alright. He would probably be thinking about it for the rest of his life, but if that were the case, and he suspected it was, was that so bad, really?  He had more than what a lot of people ever got. Something extraordinary. Something beautiful. Something
“You think I can’t get around a fucking McAfee firewall?  Fifty thousand dollars says Doyle downloaded the free version and pocketed whatever money was allocated for internet security, the cheap bastard.  Anyway, point being, you really want to talk about admitting things?  Because I’m sure the donkey party serving of narcotics they found in your barracks at Bragg had fuck-all to do with your one and only visitor who just happens to be sans arm and strung out tighter than a—“
“What am I going to do with...with patents and stuff?” Steve said evenly, face scrunching up like he couldn't quite figure out why Tony was gearing up to shake him until his teeth rattled.
“Good,” Zola remarked, sounding pleased.  “I suspect your mouth will be quite too busy tonight to speak out of turn, but should the occasion present itself, I trust you have learned the benefits of controlling your tongue?  What was that?” Zola said, when Steve didn’t answer.
“He is? Uh, it is?” Steve quickly corrected himself.
this guy?  And is now trying to set him up on a blind date?” Steve asked, making a skeptical, whooshing sound.  “That bad, huh?”
“No, no, it’s—it’s…I know it wasn’t real. I know that.  It’s just…it feels real. When it’s happening. It feels so real, Tony.  Maybe I’m going mad,” Steve said with a nervous, shaky huff of air.
“Should you need anything else, you have only to ask.  We are at your disposal,” the chef added with another deferential nod before Stark waved them off and the trio dispersed.
Slowly, Steve took off his shoes and shucked his pants, folding them neatly on the chair. He grabbed for the lube and squirted a copious amount onto his hand again. His gaze didn’t leave the lovely bottom sticking through the wall with its gaping hole dripping with his cum. He ran his hand up and down his cock in a slow, lazy motion that he liked. It wouldn’t be long and he could go again. He wondered if the man on the other side would realize that it was just one person all night. Maybe people did that now, though. There were pills. Tony explained how he once mocked a god about that. Steve smiled at the memory, shaking his head a bit. He stroked himself again, harder this time, pulling at the foreskin just a tad and stared at the waiting hole.
“Then we shall have to ensure that does not happen,” Tony replied.
Carefully, he removed his fingers, washing them thoroughly.   Though he could certainly blame the hot water, he was sure he was blushing furiously.  He had only rarely done that to himself, the shame of the first few attempts before the serum when he was convinced he was probably a bound-for-hell deviant making it a fairly unpleasant bit of experimenting and then, well, he’d just never really felt the desire to…do that.  Until now.  Until Tony.  Jesus, he had to stop this.  This thing with Tony was making him crazy.
“Not bad-strange.  Just…I’m not sure what to think, and my head is full of, I don’t know.  Thoughts,” Steve said quietly, turning back to the workstation.
A beat later, Tony heard the snick of the door closing.  He walked over and picked up the discarded towel, then picked up his wet clothes from earlier and took the pile to the bathroom, tossing them in the direction of the dirty clothes hamper.  The bags of baby supplies were still sitting against the tub, the cups and blocks pooled around the tub drain.  He bent over and started pick them up, drying them off against one of the towels and putting them back into one of the bags.  He’d have someone come get them tomorrow. They could donate them somewhere, he supposed, though the thought was oddly depressing.
The water was warm, almost decadently so, and Steve nearly moaned with pleasure as he sank into the heat.  Tony motioned him over, and he sat on the circular stone bench that ringed the tub, twisting his back to Tony at Tony’s urging.  Tony picked up some kind of tan sponge and dipped it into the water, then took a sliver of precious soap and lathered it over the porous material and started scrubbing it up and down Steve’s back.  Steve’s head dropped down with a soft groan, and he leaned forward, offering up more of his back to Tony’s ministrations.
“Oh, right, sorry. Again.  These little social niceties.  Were we not introduced earlier?  You seem familiar, but I can’t remember everyone tonight. Terrible with faces,” the man said quickly.  “I’m Tiberius Stone. Ty, for short.  Head of Viastone.  I would swear we met inside.  No?” Stone continued, eyebrows raised, then shrugged when Tony shook his head.  “Ah, well.  Hey, you sure this is okay?  I can find somewhere else to grab a smoke. Though, it’s L.A., so easier said than done, but,” he finished with a deprecating laugh, keen eyes on Tony.
Later, Tony was self-aware enough to know, he would probably blame the alcohol.  Too much champagne, coasting on the left over anxiety from a near panic attack, too little beautifully presented food, all combined with generally poor impulse control, and you got decisions eleven out of ten would not recommend, but none of that seemed to matter at the moment.  Tony turned around towards Steve and slipped off the stool, leaving almost no room between where he stood and where Steve leaned over the craps table.  Tony ran one hand up Steve’s arm where it slashed across the front of Tony’s chest and brought his other hand up to cup Steve’s jaw, applying just enough pressure to get Steve to turn to look at him.  Steve’s eyes were bright and incredibly blue, the kind that startles you, because it shouldn’t be real, that color.
“The Clan?” Nasha asked with a frown.
“We’re eating here?” Steve asked, momentarily stunned.  “Seriously?”
“Sounds like,” Steve said dryly, though there wasn’t any mockery in it. “Then it’s settled,” Steve agreed.  “You’ll like Switzerland.  Beautiful country there.  Green mountains, lakes like glass.”
He wasn’t quite sure what he was thanking Tony for. The flower.  The afternoon out. Bringing Bruce here. Trying to understand Steve, trying to help, in his own way.  Trying to protect Steve from whatever moved in the shadows that Steve could only barely see, but Tony saw all too clearly.  All of it, he supposed.
That was awkward, Steve thought, taking a deep breath.
He was leaner than Steve.  But, well-muscled, with tight, corded arms used to holding a hammer or pulling a tension rope.  His skin was the deep golden color of the sandstone mountains that they carved to build his castle. His stomach was flat and covered with a dark trail of fine hairs that spread upwards, over his chest and circled the dark pink nipples.  Steve let his hands roam, exploring.  The pulse point in Tony’s neck leapt, fluttered under the delicate skin there.
,” Steve thought.
“Classy,” Natasha snorted. ““They’ve got a dedicated concierge just for that suite,” she informed him, and he didn’t really need to ask how she knew that. “I’ll drop your bag with them.”
His momentary flash of confidence abandoned him when he walked out of his room and into the kitchen.  Steve was waiting for him, wearing his Army blue dress uniform, the same one that he had been wearing when they first met at SHIELD.  For a second, Tony was back at that meeting, sweaty-palmed and brimming with an anger born of terror, and Steve was the great unknown, too tall, too broad, with too many medals and too many questions.
“It isn’t a farce, Tony,” Steve said, slowly again, but firmly.
“Yeah,” Tony said, squelching his eyes shut and handing his head down for a long moment before forcing his gaze back to Steve’s with a deep sigh. “Yeah.”
Laughter, joyous and free, bubbled out of Tony as he pulled away, shaking his head and grinning dazedly up at Steve.
“Come to me, Steve,” Tony said.  “Come to me. I am here.  You’ve only to
He thought about the strap again. He thought about the slow build of pain and pleasure. That moment when they joined together into a seamless ebb and flow of feeling that sloughed off everything else, dug out his insides, his mind, his thoughts, until he was empty. Weightless.
“You’d better.  He doesn’t need it, Tony.  Not from you,” she said sharply, then turned and pushed the door all the way open.  Cap was sitting up on the bed in one of those God-awful hospital gowns, this one white with small navy diamonds on it, open a bit at the neck where the snaps in the back weren’t quite done right.  Tony could see leads connecting to his skin and the machines keeping time with his pulse and other vitals. His shield rested against the bedframe, within reach, Tony noted, a clear plastic bag sitting in the one chair containing what remained of his uniform.  He was staring out the window when they came in, though his head snapped around whip-fast as soon as the door opened, eyes wide and very, very blue, and for a moment, he looked so young and vulnerable, small in a way that Steve rarely ever was, and Tony’s mind flashed to the stack of faded photographs showing a skinny kid, bones nearly poking through skin, fierce eyes staring defiantly at the camera.
“Hey,” Steve said, tapping his finger against Nat’s arm where she hovered next to him, keeping a watchful eye on Tony.  “Don’t let them pull me out too soon.  Promise me, okay?  Not before Tony’s out.”
Steve looked over at the fountain again, then back at the doors.  He blinked.  There.  Light danced across the opening barely splintering the shadows, but he could see the edges of it.  Light that hadn’t been there just a moment ago.
“I hated hearing that from you.  I knew it was a line.  Something you’re told to say to clients, so they don’t feel guilty about what they’re doing.  I didn’t want to think of myself that way,” Tony went on.
There was a long pause before Tony answered.  “Yes,” Tony finally said, his voice flat and tired. “Yes.  To both of those.”
Where’s the manual on what to do when your Alpha doesn’t want you?  He closed his eyes and slowly turned his head back to face the ceiling.  Steve was probably going to find someone else.  Hell, he’d all but told Steve to, if Steve would just come home to him. Some Omega on the side who didn’t build missiles in his or her garage.  Someone who took care of him the way they were supposed to, not with better drones and stock splits.
“Hey, Steve, what’s—“ Barnes started through the speaker.
“Ready?” Steve called out to Tony.
Tony woke to light. Not unpleasant light, more of just a soft glow at the edges of his vision.  He blinked awake, or tried to. His eyelids felt like they weighed a ton. He was warm and drowsy with sleep, like he was just waking up slowly after a long, restful night.  Something covered him, like a heavy blanket, though that wasn’t quite right. He frowned in confusion, his head hazy and heavy. He concentrated for a moment, waiting, but there was no pain, other than the familiar blistering feel in his veins, but even that was muted, as if someone had turned a dial way down. Nothing seemed wrong with him.
Steve breaths were coming out in hard, labored pants.  His hair was slick with sweat.  But, he smiled, at Tony, soft and gentle and so full of love, it was hard for Tony to look at, even now.  Like looking at the sun, he thought, with a strange sort of feeling of things clicking into place.  Steve’s other hand rubbed up and down Tony’s back in long, soothing strokes.  He wrapped it around Tony’s chest and pulled Tony flush with his own, then let them both fall into a heap on the bed.  He smoothed back Tony’s hair from his forehead where sweat had plastered it in thick, haphazard curls.
A hard expression flickered over Brock’s face, and for a second, Steve thought he was going to argue, but then it was gone, and Brock smiled indulgently at him.  “Yeah,” Brock agreed, glancing up at the waitress. “Real sorry.” He smiled, then rolled his eyes and shook his head at Steve. “What’d he call you last night?  Boy scout, that’s it,” he added with mock accusation.  “He had you pegged from the get-go, that’s for sure. Boy Scout,” he repeated with a pleased laugh. “That’s you, man. That’s definitely you.”
“What is it you are asking of me?” Steve asked.
It doesn’t matter, Tony thought, letting the thought settle over him, feeling it leech throw his skin and soak into his bones. Soulmate or no, it doesn’t matter. He looked up at the door, waiting for Steve to walk in. He would show him, hold up his wrist and tell Steve it didn’t matter, and maybe Steve would show him his and it would be blank or maybe it wouldn’t, but it didn’t matter, because this, this thing between them, it couldn’t be measured against anything and come away the lesser, of that Tony was certain.
Steve clamped his mouth shut and pulled the flat pillow under his knees.  Having nothing else to do, he watched the King as he put the strange parchment down and started making large slash marks across it with a slim piece of charcoal, then picked up a quill and began making other, more careful marks.  Steve looked over at the wheel again, then back at the King.
He didn’t lift the paper, but he knew that underneath it was one of those gossip magazines, not so different from the Brevities his mother used to love to read on the rare occasion she could get an old one from the hospital. Even out of date, the lives of rich and famous had been enthralling at the end of the workweek, with her feet soaking in a tub of warm water and the little blue and white tin of Epsom salt next to her elbow on the table while she read.  A splashy cover trumpeting ‘Iron Man Melt Down’ in bold, black letters with ‘Proposal Stunt Gone Wrong’ in a smaller script underneath.
“I’m fine,” Steve said automatically.
“Thanks,” Steve replied, watching in the gym’s mirror as the door snicked shut behind her.
“Right.  Yes.  I did, I know, I shouldn’t have, but, well,” Steve stuttered, rubbing at the back of his head with his hand.  “Okay.  Obviously, this was crazy.  I don’t know what I was thinking.  I wasn’t thinking.  I was panicking, I guess, but that’s.  I mean, it’s not your problem, or it shouldn’t be, and I’m—I’m sorry, Kirk. Really, I am.  Just, you—you keep the money.  For your trouble.  Coming all the way here, or—or whatever.”
“I’ve got all a bunch of their music on my computer.  You should try it.  Bet you’d like it,” Tony offered.  “I can put a few songs on a play list for you, if you wanted.”
“Hi, I’m Tony Stark.  I’m…older,” Tony said, slowly shaking Steve's hand, and Steve rolled his eyes because he had Googled, after all.  “I run a very successful company, and I hate what it does.  I spend my time coming up with new technologies that I don’t use.  Most days, it is all I can do to get out of bed, breathe in and out and put one foot in front of the other.  I can’t sleep.  I can’t eat.  I just exist.  Or I did.  Then I met this amazing guy at a party and he was funny and sweet and kind, and he made me feel like I could do anything.  He was so convincing of this that I finally decided to change the whole focus of my company into something I could actually believe in.  And I fell in love with him, so completely and totally that I might have…overreacted  a bit…when I thought he loved someone else, but then, amazingly enough, he said he didn’t.  But I told myself he was only with me because he had to be and if I took that away, if I fixed that, he’d leave me, and I was too selfish to let that happen, so I didn’t fix it and let him keep having to worry about it, and I’m afraid that if I tell him that, he’ll hate me and won’t understand how deeply, irrevocably in love with him I am and that I was just terrified that he’d leave me if I didn’t make myself indispensible, because why wouldn’t he?  Everyone does, and he…he could have anyone.”
Steve wondered, for what felt like the millionth time, what Tony was thinking about.  His stars, maybe. His robots.  Not Steve, most likely, though for a moment, Steve let himself indulge the thought that Tony was, in fact, thinking about him.  It was a strange, fleeting pull to this moment, to the right now, to think of Tony thinking of him.  Like he was suddenly more
Tony frowned and pressed his palm to Steve’s brow, then his cheeks, and finally ran a hand through Steve’s hair, clucking his tongue and humming under his breath.
“Oh,” Cam said, voice filled with disappointment, likely at the loss of being able to ring for a bath and direct the other servants with his usual aplomb.
“That says ‘Poison Control Hotline,’” Tony pointed out.
“Yes,” Tony replied, voice hard with a tinge of malice, all the salesmanship from earlier gone.  “I can stop them.”
“I know, I just, I thought it would be cute, maybe, I don’t know. He’s nice.  A nice, normal guy, and it takes me all of, what, fifteen minutes to--wait,” Tony broke off.
“Should I?” Cam asked, holding a small bottle of oil up.
“The group that made it, this was their sigil.  A reminder of where they came from and what they lost.  That their lives were spared, and going on…it was a terrible privilege.  That it had to mean something,” Rhodes was saying, drawing Steve’s attention back to the coin.  “But this…this,” he said, turning the coin over in his hand so that Steve could see the other side. “This was the other side.  That night, this was in the sky.  A portent.  An omen.  A guide. Whatever it was, they took it as a sign, and followed it.  Some say for years, I don’t know, but they kept on, until they came to the desert and the wastes beyond.  The land was inhospitable, empty and desolate.  Stark land, they said, and so it became. Their land. And they kept on, until they found this place.”
Steve gave him an impassive look in reply and dropped his shield down against the ship’s wall with a metallic thud.
“I guess,” Steve agreed with a frown.  “I suppose it makes sense we both have nightmares about each other.”  He watched Tony’s face shift, an odd expression, almost like confusion, crossing it.  “What?” he asked. “Tony, what?”
“Twice his age and three times his size.  He said it was her sauce, but the way he said it, she’d blush and laugh and swat him with her apron,” Steve recalled, keeping up the rhythm with his fingers, spreading them wide, then spearing them together, wide again, until they weren’t enough, and Tony wanted more.  “Delya,” he said again.  Music, Tony thought. “Delya Fiocca.”
Gingerly, with one hand clutching the towel at his waist and as much dignity as someone wearing only a towel, dog tags and toilet paper could muster, he pulled open the door.
“Okay.  Yeah.  That—that sounds good,” Tony replied.  “I’ll just be a minute,” Tony said, nodding towards the hallway.  Steve grunted an assent, watching Tony the whole time.  Whatever it was tightening Steve’s features sloughed off, as suddenly as it had appeared, and he leaned his forehead down against Tony’s and brought his hands to rest on Tony’s shoulders, grounding him somehow.  It always did.
“You missed a hell of an after-party, gorgeous!” Hammer continued as he walked to what was presumably his car.  “I’d say ‘Maybe next time,’ but I’m a bit more particular than Stark there.  Don’t much care for someone else’s leavings, myself,” Hammer crowed delightedly.
“You look nice, too,” Tony told him, craning his neck a bit as he offered the compliment and adjusting his tie, though it didn’t need it.  Steve had the thought that either Tony’s hands or mouth needed to be doing something at any given time, and then felt his cheeks warm at the unintended meaning.
worst and best quality, too.  Not being able to look the other way.  That’s how he ended up on the front lines of a war that split the nation and how he ended up nearly drowning in the middle of a place he barely knew.  It was also, he supposed, how he came to meet Shellhead, so helping when he could got him this far, and he figured him and the universe or God or whatever it was out there were square now, because he wouldn’t trade this for anything, really, strange as that was to think as he floated along, slowly losing hope that he would ever find rescue.
“Why did I marry the one person who pays attention to me?  It’s really annoying,” Tony grumbled.  “Yes, okay, Howard and I, we had our…differences.  I mean, you’d think, he and I, it’d be great, right?  I don’t know, he was busy, I was obnoxious, mom was overwhelmed.  Never really seemed to connect, for whatever reason.  Shipped me off to boarding school as soon as I was old enough, then paid them a lot of money to take me back when I acted like me. Probably for the best, to tell you the truth,” Tony shrugged.  “I did, eventually, grow up, despite what you might have heard.  We even managed the occasional holiday discourse when not studiously ignoring each other right up until he died, like we knew, if we moved past the weather and his golf game, it was mutually assured destruction.  No yelling.  No blow-ups.  Everyone was calm.  Polite.  We had the quietest house you can imagine. Worked great.”
Okay, so he was, in fact, a giant hypocrite, but Hammer could just fuck off, because that last bit was way over the fucking line.
“I should just tell him I love him, huh?  Just like that,” Tony said, voice shaking a bit as he took a bite.
He took it the proffered glass, but just held it without drinking any.  Maria sat down on one of the damask-covered chairs and rearranged a tasseled pillow behind her back, sipping delicately at the sherry.
, and a few others that Steve couldn’t decipher, many of which seemed to be written in strange alphabets that Steve had never seen before.
“Here,” Steve said, opening a compartment in between the two front seats and pulling out a bottle of water.  “Drink this.”  He opened the cap and held the bottle up to Tony’s mouth encouragingly.  Tony obliged, drinking a couple of sips before he realized how fucking good water was.  He grabbed for the bottle and tipped his head back, drinking deeply.  “Slowly,” Steve cautioned, reaching for the bottle and pulling it away long enough for Tony to cough through the spasms that wracked through his body.
“Everyone does. Eventually.  Okay, fine, so Hulk’s pants are a proprietary material formed from unstable molecules. They stretch, basically. If by basically, you mean in a completely new and never been achieved before by science kind of way,” Stark said.
Tony heaved out a sigh, pressed the button to darken his workstation and went to the door.
“I’m sure,” Rhodes said, rolling his eyes and shaking his head.
He stood up then, obviously too quickly, swaying slightly with the motion.  Steve watched him down the last of the contents of the glass, then smack his lips together in satisfaction before setting it down on top of one of the stacks of papers on the desk.  He rounded the desk, hands shoved in his pockets, eyes on Steve, head tilted to the side with an intensely curious look that bordered on…well…appraising was the best Steve could come up with.
Fuck.  Fuckity-fuck-fuck.  His cock was rock hard.  He was dripping a line of slick into his boxers.  Steve was reaching for the wine they had brought as a hostess gift for the dinner they were having at his freaking parents’ house, and their driver just nope’d right out of playing third wheel in Tony’s sick little fantasy.  He was this close to having a repeat of The Event and embarrassing the hell out of himself, not to mention making things incredibly, ground-swallowingly awkward for the rest of the night.
“I guess you do,” Steve replied.  “Listen, Tony, I’m sorry.  About earlier.  I didn’t mean to—to make this uncomfortable than it already is.  For both of us,” Steve rushed out, remembering the way Tony had stiffened at his side when he kissed him.  “I know this whole thing is a distraction from what you’re trying to do. We just…need to get through it.  Make the best of it.  And then…it’ll be over.”
“So,” Tony said, turning back to Steve and ignoring Barnes’ shit-eating grin.
“I loved it, too, actually,” Coulson admitted wryly, turning his gaze to Tony.  “I had them on these little 45s.  Used to play it on my dad’s record player and listen to it all day, one after the other.  It’s good to have heroes, right?  Especially when you’re a kid.”
Steve sighed into the deepening silence while Bucky continued to shirk a disturbing amount of weaponry from his person as he stripped down to his breeches. He knew Bucky didn’t understand. Hell, he didn’t understand it himself. Why was he continuing to linger here? It was hardly the first time he put the question to himself, though Bucky’s frankness made it all the more difficult to push aside under the guise of completing a task that was accomplished but for the calling it so.
. He always loved me. He's hurt and scared, but he came back. Before. He came back for me, or he tried to, and if I'd crawled out of my hole of self-pity long enough, I could have seen that. I could've gone to him. I could've been the brave one. For him, I could've done that.
“Jarvis,” Tony began, then cut himself off and dropped his gaze to the ground, spine stiffening under Jarvis’s watchful eyes.  “It’s just a stupid mug. It’s not a big deal.”
“Maybe the reason is…everything else you’re doing,” Steve said quietly.  “And I’m just…”
“Anyone think the Mets have a shot this year?” Rhodey asked.
It was wonderful agony. His abused hole quivered at the touch of Tony’s tongue and his cock jerked. He pushed his hips back, eager for more, and Tony obliged, darting his tongue into the gaping opening and licking along Steve’s soft inner walls. Steve’s hips canted forward, jerking spasmodically as Tony’s tongue thrust in and out in some kind of obscene mirror of his cock. In and out, flicking the tip against Steve’s rim, then thrusing in deep to taste. Tony took the edge of Steve’s rim between his teeth and nipped, then sucked, stroking the abused flesh with his tongue when he was finished, then licked deep, his fingers digging into Steve’s hips.
“You did not just do that,” Steve said, huffing out a disbelieving laugh.
“No,” Tony said, looking down at his hands.
“Which people what?” Fury repeated, drawing up his brows.
going to get along,” Tony announced with a bemused sort of smile.  “I like him so much,” Tony added, shaking his head and glancing over at Steve.
“Peace in our time,” the Ul repeated, lifting his cup while the gathering repeated his words with a few cheers and the sounds of fists banging on the table to accompany them.
It shouldn’t have been as easy as it was to talk to Tony. That was the thing. They were from entirely different worlds. They shouldn’t have anything in common, really, but the conversation flowed like water, and Steve never found himself feeling awkward or out of step, the way he usually did. Tony even laughed at his occasional lame attempt at humor, and teased him a little, though the barbs, such as they were, were soft and coupled with the warm glint in Tony’s eyes, and made Steve feel more like he was being welcomed into some exclusive club that got to be teased instead of the usual sting that came with feeling like he had screwed up somehow.
, anything, was almost overwhelming.
“Oh, right.  Right.  Yes.  Yes, that.  Of course. Armor maneuverability and enhanced lethality protocols. We were definitely talking about that,” Tony grinned widely.
“Oh!  Sorry!”  Steve said in a startled voice, trying to tuck the drink back towards him so it wouldn’t spill on the stranger.  “I’m…are you…did I?  Sorry.  Did I just cut in front of you?” he stammered, suddenly feeling twelve years old, trying to control a body that no longer fit.
I should have talked to you more, Steve thought.  I’m sorry. I should have listened harder.
“It’s gonna change everything, Steve. You’ll see.  We’ll be set,” Brock smiled widely, shoving a huge bit of eggs and potatoes onto his fork and chewing as he talked through his grin. “I’m telling you. Set for fucking life, my friend,” he stabbed the fork in Steve’s direction. “You’ll see,” he repeated, a bit of giddiness seeping into his voice, which Steve understood--it
“Tony,” Steve choked out.  “You’re—you’re here. You’re alive, you’re—"
Tony’s hand dropped from his cheek and he crouched down in front of Steve, so he could wrap his hand around the pendant hanging in the center of Steve’s chest instead.  He smiled, though there was nothing soft or gentle about it, all wicked heat and hard angles, and tugged, inexorably forward, pulling at the clamps on Steve’s nipples until he had no choice but to lean into it.  Tony’s grin widened for a moment, and then he jerked the pendant just hard enough to send a sizzle of pain stabbing through Steve’s nipples before capturing Steve’s mouth in a wet, searing kiss, tongue pushing in on Steve’s gasp with hard, sweeping strokes that stole Steve’s breath and left him panting when Tony final pulled back.
“The public thing?  Bet that won’t be as much fun as it sounds,” Tony muttered under his breath.  “Sure.  Fine.  Why not?  There isn’t enough cognitive dissonance in my life.  Hell, nothing says relaxing and low-key like day-glow painted, KISS-themed mini-golf,” Tony snarked.  He gave Steve a long, considering look, then threw his hands in the air in apparent defeat.  “But, if we’re doing this, we’re making it interesting.”
“Good,” Tony said, sitting back and admiring his handiwork.  “That’s good, Steve.  You’re so beautiful for me,” he sighed, looking almost wistful.  “I’m going to fuck you now.”
“And you are Steven Grant Rogers, only child of Sara and Joseph Rogers. Owner of a small farmstead in the valley from which you farm produce and a small amount of grain. Friend of James Barnes, he of the newly minted Second Regiment, which you hope to join one day and fight by his side against the scourge that menaces our borders,” Tony continued.  One pale-fingered hand came up to rub at the stone in the center of his necklace as he spoke, as if he knew where Steve’s attention strayed.  Steve watched in fascination for a moment, then Tony’s words sunk in.
Steve pushed the wet rag into Tony’s face, leaving him dripping.  “Good point,” Tony grinned, watching as Steve broke into an answering smile punctuated by more pounding at the water’s surface, this time with the rag clutched in one hand.  “Well articulated.  You should try this in team meetings.  I’d love to see how it goes over with Spider Lady.  Okay, okay, that’s enough.  I know you like it,” Tony said, tugging the cloth from Steve’s fist while Steve made an urgent, brassed-off noise and tried to follow it.
The man was beautiful, even more so out here in the light, without the pall of sickness and pain.  He had broad shoulders and a flat stomach that rippled with muscles as he moved. The amulet Anto had noticed before swung from his neck, and he had shaved his beard off, leaving his face smooth.  He looked younger like that, Anto thought. He was long-limbed and lithe, where Clan were short and stocky, his legs and arms thick with well-defined muscles that Anto could almost feel under his hands as he watched the man move.  Clan were far more burly. Not fat, but thick, like the branches on a tree, but this man was lean, more like Anto, but far more heavily muscled, like one of the big cave lions who sometimes prowled the hunting grounds at night and stole Tyber’s kill.  The Stranger was beautiful, Anto was far past trying to deny that now, and he was leaving, and everything would go back to how it was before.
“What did you tell him?” Steve asked.
Tony handed the cup back to Steve, then finished cleaning Steve’s face and chest, then carefully wiped down Steve’s cock.
“Um…you like to draw down here?” Tony offered, clearly confused. Steve grimaced at Tony’s lack of understanding.  How a man this smart could be this obtuse…
Finally, Tony’s mouth left him with a slow scrape of teeth against the hardened peak of Steve’s nipple.  Steve’s hips canted up, his back arching into it, chasing the feeling.  Steve let out a frustrated whine at the absence, earning a low chuckle from Tony.
“It was the first thing I saw when I came in,” Steve explained with a shrug.
“An artist paints truth?  Did you just say that out loud?” Kirk demanded, shaking his head with a disdainful look.
“Tony
His cock was leaking already, and he had barely even started.  How much longer would Tony be? He strained his head up a bit. Tony was bent over the desk, quill in hand, completely engrossed in reading one of the letters.  Steve’s head dropped back down, staring fixedly at the canopy overhead. Tony wasn’t even watching him. He wasn’t even
“Enjoy fishing, Captain. I hear it’s a very relaxing pastime,” Coulson said as brightly as Coulson probably did anything, nodding his goodbye as Steve finally dropped his hand and let the elevator doors slide shut.  Steve wasn’t sure if Coulson was trying to make a joke or a point.
“I’ve been thinking about that, and I think I have a plan,” Tony said.
Yeah, good fucking luck there, Clyde, Tony thought.
“If he decides to do so, then I have failed to treat him justly, and if he succeeds, then I do not deserve my place at the tip of the spear,” Steve replied.
“Like I said, he probably just lost track of time,” Steve said, glancing away for a moment. “I think he’s excited to meet you,” Steve told him with a small frown. For some reason, the idea of Brock meeting Stark felt wrong somehow.  It was like that feeling he got sometimes right before a seemingly-by-the-book mission went all to shit.  It was ridiculous, but, if he had been able to figure out how to extricate himself from all of this short of jumping off the balcony, he would have done it. As it was, there wasn’t much he could do, since nothing he said would dissuade Brock from coming down to meet Tony Stark, he knew that much.
“Indeed.  I shall return when I have news, my friends.  Until then, I believe our Captain is in good hands,” Thor replied as he grabbed Mjolnir and headed down the jet’s lowered ramp.  Tony followed him, Steve still cupped in his arm, looking down at the loud, clanking steps of the boots on the jet’s ramp in fascination.  Tony held one hand up to shield Steve’s eyes from the brilliant flare of light as the Bifrost opened, taking Thor back to Asgard.  Steve’s small hands reached out, fingers splaying, like he could capture the light if he tried, his lack of joy at their landing seemingly forgotten.
“They’re quite smart.  They train them to speak.  Some speak hundreds of words, and they can live as long as a man. The Atilan court keeps seven, as tradition, since their rulers take a vow of silence.  One of the birds only speaks insults, I’m told. I think I’d like that one best,” Tony grinned.
Okay. Okay, so that answered that question. It wasn't really a surprise, was it? Seemed clear when he thought about it. Rushed bonding, Steve bugging out as soon as possible, suppressants and the decided lack of a knot in his ass were all pretty obvious signs. It was good, though, really. Exactly what he wanted. Awesome. Great. His Alpha didn't want him. No problem. Perfect. He wasn't interested in that, either, so. Right. Match made in Heaven and all that.
“Nothing,” Tony replied.  “Nothing you need worry about. Unexpected news, that’s all.  And unwelcome.”
Tony had done this.  For him.  Taken one of Steve’s nightmares and destroyed it, more fully than Steve would have allowed himself to do, he recognized that much, and there was something humbling in that, this willingness of Tony’s to bear the burden of mercilessness.  All while Steve was wandering the gardens, watching Tony work and looking at maps.  I would have killed Rumlow, Steve mused.  Had I the chance. Honorably.  In a fair fight.  He would have died.  Quickly and easily.  But, I wanted this, even if I refused to give in to that viciousness, and Rumlow would have died, mocking me, with an insult on his lips, taking as much power as he could with him when he did.  Instead, he would die alone, in ignominy, with no way to hurt anyone else, and when Steve thought of Rumlow, if he thought of him, that is how he would remember the man who once tormented him.  Hunched over on his knees and screaming from a throat so parched it burned, with no one hearing him except the wind and the sea birds who floated on the gusts by the shore, searching for fish and answering with their own screams in return.
“Oh, pipe down, Snape, they’re both Aconite,” Tony called out caustically, to a round of sniggers.
that.  You’d find I could be just as generous as Tony under the right conditions.  Once you’ve learned how this kind of thing goes, Steve.  Whatever you think you have with Tony…you could find something far more…satisfying…with someone who understands how all this is supposed to work, who can give you what you really need,” Stane said, his voice low with threat and something else Steve recognized as arousal.  Stane liked this, this power, liked it a lot. He was dangerous, Steve knew.
“Different kings,” Cam replied. He lifted open a box on the desk and perused the contents for a long moment before shutting the lid with a soft snap.
“It’s different,” Steve replied through a sigh.
“Oh?  Oh!  Sure, yes, of course.  Let me just see if she is off her conference call,” Sheila said helpfully.  And ok, so now Steve felt like a total rube.  Tony ditches their dinner plans and he starts playing detective.  It was possible he had been slightly underestimating the impact his feelings for Tony were having on his behavior.  Now, apparently, they had gotten him into a Marketing meeting to look at a bunch of lunchboxes with his face plastered on them.
“Uh-oh, not that again,” Brock said under his breath, then gave Steve a half-smile.
“Tony…” Steve began, then sat his sandwich down on the plate.  “May I draw you?”
Steve knew, now, how much of this journey had been for him, but he thought Bucky and Tony had the right of it. They both needed this, and needed to do this together.  They owed it to each other, and to the ghosts who had stood between them for so long.  Those ghosts were not all buried here, Steve thought, but maybe they should be.  An end and a beginning.  But only if he chose to let it be.  Tony wouldn’t let him go, either way, but they could be something more, something strong, if he allowed it.  He had long thought there was risk in ceasing to hold it so close, and maybe there was, but it was not near so great as what it was doing to Tony, to them, to continue to do so.
What had he missed?
“I’m going to undo these now,” Tony added, nodding now at the clamps still holding Steve’s nipples between their small teeth. “Breathe deep, this will hurt,” he warned with a sympathetic wince. Steve sucked in a breath as Tony undid the clamps on his nipples, both at the same time, and feeling returned with icy, cold stabs of pain that slowly grew until he whined with it.
He wondered if that was awkward for Obie.  Negotiating over Tony.  He hoped it was.  He hoped it was weird and uncomfortable and all the things he’d felt sitting in his mother’s parlor listening to infomercials while she calmly explained that Obie had offered to take him through his first Heat.  A shiver of distaste curled up his spine and settled in his stomach as he remembered the shocked horror he’d felt at hearing that had even been on the table.  Sure, his Heat had been a blindingly unpleasant experience without an Alpha, but, God, Obie?  He’d known the man his whole life.  And he was at least three times Tony’s age.  And he was…he was Obie.  The idea of…well, of doing
“I’ve been trying to get him to stop and eat,” Rhodes said, “but it appears you will have more luck with the request.”
“Hey!  You two there!  What’s going on here?” a uniformed officer demanded, shining his flashlight at where Tony stood next to the remains of the getaway van, in a drizzle of water from the hydrant, with five would-be kidnappers taking cat-naps on the street around them.
“You did not know it, you got lucky,” Rhodey argued.
“Picasso,” Steve recalled with a smile.
Tony gripped the telescope’s arm with one hand and let his head fall into the curve of his outstretched elbow, his cheek pressed against the quilt where it hung over his shoulders as he regarded Steve.
“No, no, he’s fine.  He’s fine.  God, he’s fine, Bruce.  He’s going to be okay, which is great, because I’m going to need to yell at him.  A lot.  You hear that, Rogers?  A fucking lot,” Tony said with a huge grin.
“Oh,” Steve replied.  “Ah. Right. Well, I mean, we don’t have to, if you don’t want to, or—”
“No!” Tony nearly shouted.  A creeping, shaking panic was slowly working its way up his spine.  He knew he was overreacting, but he couldn’t have explained why to save his life.  He just…didn’t want Steve to walk away.  Not right now.  Not yet.  Give me a little more, he thought urgently.  Just a little.  Something.  “I mean.  I mean, I’m not tired.  Kind of keyed up, I guess. With everything.  I was going to—“ his eyes darted over to the deck, landing on his telescope.  “If you want, I could—I have a, a speaker thing for my phone.  I’ve got some music.  I could hook it up.  If you wanted,” Tony offered, then instantly regretted the opening for rejection as soon as he recognized it. “Or—or not.  You’re probably tired. It is late, like you said.  We should just go to bed.  Some other time, right?”
“Anytime,” Rhodey replied. “I’ll get your classwork and find someone with good notes. Talk to the professors.  Don’t worry, okay?”
“I like his dumb jokes,” Tony blurted out, raising his eyes to hers.  “And how much of a complete troll he can be, like some kind of an asshole version of Gomer Pyle because it just doesn’t compute when he’s so—so—you know about everything, and how he does this thing where he listens and notices and cares.  I mean, yes, that’s ridiculously annoying at times, goes without saying,” Tony added, slashing his hand through the air in front of him, before biting his lip and looking out at the vista glittering in front of him.  “It’s just…I like him.  He’s smart and funny and good and--I like him, and my weapons killed his friends, who were, let’s recap, all pinned down in that shithole because they were looking for me.  And somehow, this whole thing—the stripping, the crappy phone, the fucking
Why should he be embarrassed or ashamed because of what those Omegas said?  He shouldn’t, he knew.  They didn’t know. They didn’t know that Steve didn’t want him.  They weren’t mocking him. Well, not for that, anyway.  In his head, he knew that wasn’t what Whitney had been insinuating, but he couldn’t force the idea that they knew something wasn’t right out of his head.
Without any preamble, the alien took Tony’s cock in hand and slipped the open end of the cylinder over it, sheathing it inside the blue metal tube.
“Twenty years and counting, so crawl back to your moms’ basements, you asshats,” the one who must be Lenny replied.  “Can we get some smiles?  Everyone likes a Cinderella story.”
“You almost died. We were in the park. Just the park, just--and then you said we needed to take the fight to him, and I listened, God-damn it, I
And now, here he was, waiting for Steve to get home—back, watching the road from his very own widow’s walk, and he understood why, it made sense.  This life, this thing he’d had a glimpse of, it was far too precious to imagine letting go of it now, and if something happened to Steve, then it all disappeared.
This stunning artwork was done by tsumi-noaru.tumblr.com.  I highly recommend this artist for your commissions!
Tony stood rooted to the spot for a long moment. He wasn't sure what he'd been expecting, but it wasn't this—this dismissal. Just like that. Here's everything you wanted. Stuff like that happened in movies and books, not real life, and certainly not his real life, that was for damn sure.
Tony blinked at Steve, then rolled his eyes, flopped down onto the loveseat and pushed his hands through his hair.  “God, don’t name them.  Then, they’ll belong to us. I’m going to have feelings, and it’s all your fault.”
Tony blasted his way out the door to the observation room and walked down the hall, headed for the elevator that would take him to one Mr. Henry Camp, who was currently three levels up in a recovery room, probably getting ice chips and watching game shows and unaware he was about to have a lesson in gravity. Which would’ve gone perfectly well, except the door to Steve’s quarters was suddenly knocked across the hallway in front of him, landing at an awkward angle in the hallway, blocking his way, and Steve was standing there all beautiful and perfect, and really, he should be in his room because the furniture would be here soon, and probably someone would need to sign for it.
,” Danen added, nodding at Steve.  “Ignore this one.  She thinks she is special because she has served the Lady Christine for years and has forgotten her place when the Lady is away on her travels.”
Mine, Tony thought, remembering his mother’s words.   Two things that had always been beyond his reach, and now they were his, sitting in his garage behind a door he never locked anymore.  But when he closed his eyes and tried to think of them, his robots and his stars, all he saw was the sketch of Maria, trembling with power and energy, her face, a blank metal mask that seemed to be staring through him.
of them.”
Someone had placed four paper bags filled with Thai food outside Tony’s door, so they ate, Steve consuming unholy amounts of food while Tony handed him other things he should try.  There was something absurdly endearing about watching Steve eat.  It filled him with some weird sense of accomplishment.  It was probably some crazy Alpha caveman care-and-feeding-of-your-Omega thing, but he handed Steve the box of spring rolls as hopefully as if it was frankincense and myrrh and just went with it.  He’d never paid any attention to what happened after the whole knotting thing.  That seemed to be the big show, so why bother with anything else.  It would probably be bad form to have JARVIS Google ‘what to do with your Omega post-knotting’ right now.
“Hydra,” Steve said and felt a shudder wrack its way down his spine to settle in his gut like a stone.
worked.  This one time, it had worked.
“Here,” Steve cut in. He was holding a lighter in one hand and a yellow, spiraled candle in the other.  “I was going to…this morning, for your birthday.  Thought I’d put it in a biscuit or something.  That was stupid, I don’t know why I thought that.  I should’ve gotten a cake or, well.  Things got off track, though.  So.  This okay?  Not much of a party, I know…” Steve trailed off, looking around the garage where DUM-E and U hummed and clicked, rolling around happily between Steve and Tony.  “Probably not what you’re used to for your birthday, huh?”
“You’re not what I expected, that’s for sure,” Steve went on, relaxing into the words as the strain seemed to slip off his face. His eyes were bright now, teasing and warm as he regarded Tony.  It made Tony’s stomach do some kind of flip and a pool of heat gather low in his gut.
The woman hummed, low and considering. “Hold on, there’s a note on your file, actually.”
“Steve…” Tony started, as the front door banged open and Bucky came ambling out with a cigarette in one hand and lighter flicking in the other.  He stopped and stared at Steve, heading into the apartment building and Steve knew what his face must look like. He’d never had much of a poker face, and Bucky could read him like a book.
“Well,” Steve drawled, a small smile splitting his face. “I kind of suspect that’s when you’ll come get me.”
“My soldier,” Tony huffed, though it had the tinge of pride to it that made Steve’s stomach swoop low.  “I will be interested to hear what say you of the demonstration in the desert and how you think it would fare against what you have seen. I am fairly proud of this one.  I call it the Jerak’ho.  For the fabled city whose walls fell to the wrath of a vengeful god.  Too ostentatious, do you suppose?” Tony asked with a flash of a grin that said he knew it was.
Hell, on his generous days, Tony had even entertained the thought that Barnes’ initial resistance to his relationship with Steve had been out of some effort to try to warn Tony off.  Ultimately ineffective, of course, though he’d give Barnes credit for trying.  Blaring air horns would’ve been more subtle, at least in the beginning, when they were playing tug-o-Steve.  This…this anger that Barnes directed at him, when Tony had been the dumbass getting taken for a ride, was a bit on the wrong side of overly dramatic, all things considered.
And he didn’t even really want to do that.  Push Tony away.  That was…that was a desperation move, to give himself space to think, to figure out a way to put this behind him, but now he’d managed to accomplish the thing he had been trying to prevent, and hurt Tony in the process with his selfishness.  Which was the last thing he’d wanted to do.  Not to Tony.  And now that he had time to think back on the situation, that was the pallor hanging over Tony down in the workshop. Guilt.  Steve’s gut twisted with remorse.  He’d done that.  He’d made Tony feel that way.  All because of his own inability to control himself and disappointment that Tony didn’t feel the same.  Well, why would he, behaving like this? Steve thought.  He wanted Tony to know how remarkable he was, how amazing and brilliant and brave, how kind he was, not feeling guilty over some non-existent slight.  He needed to figure out a way to make Tony understand that, make him see himself the way Steve saw him.  If he could just show him that, let him see, for just a moment, how incredible he was, then maybe he wouldn’t do this to himself, shut himself off like he did, shut everyone out.   If he could…if he could…he’d show Tony, let him understand, make him feel what Steve felt when he looked at him, listened to him, he could
It wasn’t a particularly long walk back to the field where Steve’s carriage waited to whisk him back to Greenbriar, Lord Ellis’ keep.  He kept up a steady conversation with Josiah and Peran, mostly about how the Greenway reminded Josiah and Steve of their respective homes.  Before they reached the field, Steve asked for a moment of privacy, and walked a distance away behind the cover of a few tall trees, as he had done many times on the journey.  This time, he stayed a bit longer. Next time, he would stray slightly further afield. And the time after that, a quick return. Then, the next time, a little longer again. On the return trip from the desert, they would wind through the Red Mountains along a well-traveled pass.
“Okay, okay, I get it,” Steve said around a laugh, rubbing at the side of his head.  “You liked it, huh?” Shellhead nodded again. “I liked it, too.” Shellhead answered with a soft smile that slowly turned into a low, wet snickering laugh.
.  God, was he really thinking alien, here?  He supposed he was. What else could it be? He supposed it could be some kind of top-secret military craft. Something in deep space that even his satellites missed.  Maybe he had stumbled on some classified mission on his little jaunt through undiscovered country. That was
“Sometimes, people are mean.  You can’t rush down here with your whole Captain Alpha thing every time someone’s a dick.  I could’ve handled it myself,” Tony muttered into the curve of Steve’s shoulder.  He pushed his nose against the soft cotton of Steve’s shirt, inhaling the scent.  Musk and spring and Alpha, some combination that made Tony think of the cabin for some reason.
The carriage jolted over a particularly large bump in the road, and Steve had to bite down on his lip to keep from moaning.  He must have made some sound, because Cam gave him a strange look, then went back to leaning out the window, watching as the city grew smaller as the procession made its way down the road.  Steve leaned his head back against the carriage, trying to adjust his position as best he could for the swaying motion, and closed his eyes, trying to focus on anything other than the sensations wracking his body.
“I did not want this life,” Steve began, voice cracking a bit on the last.  He dropped his eyes for a moment, then raised his gaze back to Tony’s face.  A plea, maybe.  He wasn’t sure.
“And I’m not Prince Charming.  Or a hopeless romantic,” Steve insisted, jaw grinding in frustration.  “You think I don’t get that you have issues?  I know you have issues.  I know this will be hard.  You’re a…whirlwind of, I don’t know, intelligence and personality and, God, so much you-ness, I barely know what to say half the time. I just want to stand there all slack-jawed that you’re giving me the time of day instead of using your taser-watch on me.”
Tony had asked him for something.  A small thrill jolted through Steve.  It wasn’t much, but it was a start. He walked over to the credenza and picked up a bottle of water that was chilling in a silver bucket, then walked around the edge of the table to stand as close as he dared to Tony.  The urge to reach out and touch him was nearly overwhelming. Just to know what he felt like, that would be amazing, Steve thought.
“Hi, Steve,” Clint said, nodding slightly towards the space over Tony’s shoulder.  Tony turned slowly around, looking from his gauntleted hand to the pink and green pieces of fruit covering most of the living room.  He was a genius who miniaturized an arc reactor in a cave using spare parts. He would think of a perfectly logical explanation for this.
“Well, he’s not going to make it easy on you, that’s for damn sure,” Barnes pointed out grimly. “He likes you, though.  See him get all prickly about you?  Gets his back up, that’s how you can tell,” Barnes grinned, and for a moment, Tony could see the young man he must have been before all of this happened.  War.  Bureaucracy.  Pettiness. Life. Tony.  Whatever.   Warmth seeped through his chest at Barnes’ words.  He couldn’t help it.  He knew the roadblock in front of him, but still, hearing it from Barnes, from Steve’s best friend…well, it wasn’t nothing, at least.  “God, you should see your face.  You’re all,” Barnes pantomimed some kind of ridiculously sappy expression, making Tony’s face pull into a frown.   “If you let him go, you’re the world’s biggest idiot, you know that, right?”
that Tony wanted to present.  So to speak.  A frustrated half-whine escaped his lips, and he dropped his hand to his side, sucking in a long, shuddering breath.
Steve told him what he thought of that by reaching for Tony’s cock as it bobbed against Tony’s belly and thumbing the pre-come on the slit over the head.
“Captain, if I may speak candidly?  You come here each week and we sit, quietly, and I send a form to Fury that says you are mission ready, because that’s what Fury needs it to say.  Maybe that’s what we all need it to say, and maybe it’s worth it, in the end, but you are not adjusting.  I’ve seen returning soldiers struggle with being out of a warzone more times than I can count.  You are not getting better.  You are barely getting by,” she said, voice clipped and firm, because she had rehearsed this, but hadn’t given Steve his lines.
Tony pocketed the phone. He tapped a finger at his lip, worrying the edge with his teeth, as he watched Steve move around the suite while Barnes sat on the couch watching what appeared to be a telenovela.  Checking his email and reading through a few of the more salacious takes on his and Steve’s evening of wedded bliss passed the time until he realized Shaggy, Daphne and Fred were probably waiting downstairs for him. Pushing himself up, Tony walked to the French doors that led inside, hesitated a moment, watching the two of them as a smile spread over Steve’s face at something Barnes had said, then went inside.
“That’s terrible.  You should be ashamed.  I'm ashamed on your behalf," Steve intoned evenly.
“Tony,” Steve drawled in a low voice, lips pulling into a half smile at Tony’s obvious indecision. “Get in the shower with me,” he urged, except it sounded all husky and warm and smushed together in the way that New Yorkers sometimes could.  Tony’s mouth fell open. He was fairly sure it was because all of the blood just left his head. At any rate, he couldn’t seem to form actual words.
“Ah.  And now, we come to the crux of the matter,” Tony replied. He reached with one hand into the sleeve of the other arm of his coat and drew out a bit of cloth, somewhat worn now with age, but it looked almost like a handkerchief, though far fancier than Steve was used to seeing.  Tony held the cloth between his fingertips for a long moment, looking down at it, his face unreadable.  Finally, he looked back up at Steve and held out his hand, the cloth cradled in the flat of his palm.  “You remember that night on the road, yes?”
.  I’ve never been exactly what you’d call a normal Omega,” Tony continued, feeling Steve’s gaze slide over to him, gentle and fond, sending a burst of warmth through Tony’s chest.  “But this…this…this is asking too much.  I know it is.  I get it, I do, and I have to do it, Steve.  I have to, but I can’t…the idea of losing you, losing us…I can’t…”
Steve blinked and looked down in momentary shock. The cage fit around the length of his cock, though just barely, and only after Tony shoved it on with enough force to make Steve hiss out a surprised gasp.  The extra weight of it pulled at his cock.  He clicked the golden band around Steve’s balls into place in the lock and stood back to admire his work.  Steve’s cock was already straining against the metal bars, red and bulging.  A large pearl on a golden chain dripped from the end of the cage in what was an obvious reference, and a heavy weight that Steve thought must be solid gold by the feel of it hung from the band that circled his balls, tugging them down until the skin at their base stretched thin and smoothly pink.
“That what this is?” Steve asked, then let his head fall back and hit the tile wall behind him as his arms came up to wrap around Tony’s waist, just below where the shower hit so he caught the mist of the spray flecking off Tony’s back.  “That what we’re doing here? Communicating?”  Steve wasn’t sure, but he thought it might be.
“We do,” Steve said.  He closed the drawer on the items in the cabinet and crossed his arms over the front of the robe.  “I’ll be sure to thank the King for the…changes,” Steve continued, arching his brow.  “They were most welcome.”  Zola pursed his lips into a sneer, then pulled it into a smile that was all teeth.
“No, I—I know that.  You wouldn’t hurt me,” Tony said, realizing that he actually believed it.  How long had it been since Steve had promised him that?  Long enough for it to become truth, Tony supposed.  “I mean, sometimes you get all sort of, like, closed off or something.  You paint those swirly dark things that make me wish you were painting clowns.”
“Steve’s…he’s…nice,” Tony managed.  “Different.”
Belonging. That was the word his mind was searching for.  He had belonged to someone since that night, and someone to him, tethered by an invisible thread. Bound in blood and night, that was what Tony said, Steve recalled with a slight shiver.  And tomorrow...tomorrow, he might not ever feel like that again.  It punched the air out of his chest, the thought of it. His stomach sank, even as his blood thumped through his veins, echoing a primal need he could barely name.

Tony was repeating his name, over and over, seemingly beyond anything more complicated than that, a chorus of Steves filling the room.  Tony’s strokes got sloppier, losing the pace as his body thrummed and cracked as he spilled himself inside Steve.  A few last, shuddering thrusts and Tony collapsed on top of him, slick with sweat and mess, hair sticking every which way and a dazed, but deeply satisfied look on his face.
He could feel his knuckles scrape against the underside of the table, but kept doing it.  It gave him something to focus on, something to ground him, keep him here instead of letting his head run away, like it sometimes needed to when things got to be too overwhelming.
“You’re happy.  I don’t need to know the details,” Steve replied, grinning. “Not sure I’d understand them, even if your repeated…whatever it was you were doing on the whiteboard.  Looked a bit like hieroglyphics.”
“Yeah, no. Not the paperwork,” Tony immediately corrected, then winced and shoved his hands in his pockets, twisting around a bit in place. None of his conversations with Steve ever seemed to go as planned. “I mean, yes, the paperwork—you know what? Can I—can I come in? I'd just as soon not have this conversation with Leaving Las Vegas next door listening in.”
“You should put that in the brochure,” Tony muttered, swiping a hand over his face and ending up leaving his hair haphazard curls, sticking up at all angles.
“I know that,” Steve replied.
The books were a distraction from where his mind wanted to focus, he was well aware.  He let his gaze travel, giving the room one more sweep before settling on the open closet, where lines of clothes still hung in their plastic with a paper bib over the group promising same day service if in by nine.
Steve nodded, finding a foothold on Tony’s boot and wrapping an arm around Tony’s shoulders, grasping one of the arm joints for purchase.  “The rest of the team is meeting us there,” Steve informed him.  Tony tightened his grip around Steve’s waist and lifted off the launching platform into the air.
Steve once told him about waiting in a bunker for the shelling to start.  Forty-six hours.  Sitting there, waiting.  Knowing it was coming, but not when or how bad it would be.  Able to hear the whine of shells as they cut through the air overhead, the explosions rattling around them as they huddled there, pinned down by a heavily armored German line while they waited for reinforcements.  Not being able to do anything to stop it, just having to wait.  Playing (backgammon) cards they made out of the wrappers from their rations to try to pass the time.  How he got to the point of wishing the shells would hit them, even knowing what that meant for everyone in the bunker who wasn’t Steve.  Just to get it over with.  How much self-loathing came with that wish, even as he hadn’t been able to shake it.
“Let’s face it.  You’ve had to say worse.  That time with the strippers, the guy in the wrong half of a donkey costume and the Cabinet member who shall remain forever nameless, though, I like to call him Hee-Haw, if anyone’s wondering, comes to mind,” Tony recalled.
.  Steve, Tony remembered with a wet, shaky breath, was sweet and funny and actually had seemed to enjoy being around Tony, when they did manage to catch more than an evening together.  Hanging out on the sofa watching movies, traipsing around the city, spending hours laying in the sun at the park while Steve drew landscspes of places Tony didn’t know and sketched faces that Tony always thought looked vaguely familiar and Tony drew and erased deigns over and over in his notebook. That had been fun, Tony could admit. Maybe not exciting. But nice.
Tony took another sip of coffee and got up from the table, emptying the remains of his breakfast into the garbage and putting the dishes in the sink.  He turned around and looked over at the pad of paper again.  It was still obstinately blank.  He walked over and picked up the pen, pulled the cap off and stuck it on the end, chewing absently on it while he leaned a hip against the counter and considered his options.
“About fucking time,” Barton grumbled as he swept into the kitchen and grabbed for the bag of sliced bread, plopping a couple of pieces in the toaster, looking back and forth between Tony and Steve like watching a tennis match.  Tony realized he was grinning like a fool and didn’t care, because Steve was smiling back at him, open and guileless and it was like stepping out into the sun after you’ve been cold all day, every part of him warming in response, everything brighter and better somehow.  He could do this.   He could do this and not fuck it up.  So help him, God.
Apologizing profusely nevertheless, Steve offered to reimburse them for the damage, but was quickly waived off and handed a sharpie to sign the damaged sink.  They said they’d auction it off to benefit the DAV.  Sometimes being Captain America had its privileges.
Conference Room Steve scooted down the bed and knelt again between Tony’s thighs.  He got his hands under Tony’s ass and lifted, then leaned down and licked a long stripe up the crease and over Tony’s hole, eliciting a startled gasp from Tony that quickly devolved into sharp, stuttering whimpers as the other Steve’s tongue traced the still-red rim of Tony’s hole.
He supposed he knew that already.
“Please Tony,” he begged.  He wasn’t sure what he was asking for.  To be taken, filled, used up, whatever Tony wanted.  He didn’t need to think about it.  Didn’t need to think about whether he should feel this way or why he shouldn’t. He was chained up. Immobile.  Helpless. There was nothing he could do except let Tony do whatever he wanted. He was Tony’s, like this, but, he thought, looking up at Tony who was watching him with an intensity usually reserved for one of Tony’s machines that was giving him a problem, Tony was his like this, too.  Perhaps never more so than now, when the combined focus of his mind, body and heart were all for Steve.  The realization shook through him, lighting gooseflesh over his skin. It was almost too much.  He wanted it all.  More. This.
“It’s Eau de Steve. No wonder you like it,” Tony replied.
“Simpson?” Steve asked, looking down at the paper again, eyes scanning over the page.
He could feel it now, the low, steady throb of pain in his chest and gut, like relinquishing Tony had opened a valve and let it rush in, all at once.
“Look, I don’t know who you think you are, but you can’t just—” Preston started.
“Wouldn’t know it from the way his tutors complained,” Howard muttered.  He’d been waiting for something, Tony figured.  Some crack in the façade he could worm his way through, throw something in Tony’s face.  Tony imagined one of those workplace signs flipping over with a sharp clicking noise that sounded like teeth.  It has been 0 minutes since our last insult of Tony.
Definitely not jealousy, though.  That would be silly.
Steve in his bed, big body wrapped around Tony, hands molding into Tony's flesh, eyes hard and dark with lust, smiling that same soft, wobbly, crinkle-eyed smile, eyes bright with love. Steve next to him. Steve with him. A them. They could have that, again, or something close enough to it that the rest...well, the rest he could chalk up to life experience and childhood fancy. What was left, it could be enough. More than what most people got, most likely.
Tony withdrew enough to enjoy the sight of his cock coated in Steve’s slick before pushing back in again, long, deep thrusts, gripping Steve’s hips to keep him in place as Tony’s balls slapped against the crack of Steve’s ass, coming away wet.  His rhythm faltered at that, felt himself tighten, stomach clenching.  He reached down as his cock slid out in again, he pressed his index finger in as well, hooking it upwards to press against the cluster of nerves as he thrust, the sensation of Steve’s body stretched around his finger and cock, both ramming forward at different angles almost too much.  Steve was making a low, guttural sound, and well, there went another rent in carpeting, but who cared because Steve was pressing back against him, meeting his thrusts, so he pulled his finger out, keeping his cock pumping in and out, and used the slippery moisture dripping off his finger to reach around and coat Steve’s shaft as it jutted against his stomach.
“Please don’t finish that sentence. I’d like plausible deniability to be a thing,” Rhodey cut him off, then stopped and cocked his head to the side.  “Did—did you hear that?”
Once the clock hit five, he got up and changed into SHIELD sweats, made a quick breakfast of eggs, bacon, toast and coffee for Tony, then hit the road.  The guards at the entry gate saluted smartly, then waved him through.  He knew where he was headed. A night of tumultuous thoughts left him reeling and needing to push those thoughts out the only way he knew how.
“Okay?” Tony repeated.  Rogers pushed the chair back and stood up, pulling at the bottom of his dress uniform jacket, which made the medals shake across his chest.  “So, that’s it.  Just like that.  We’re…you’re…and I’m…”
*************************************************
Tony frowned down at Steve, who seemed happily ensconced against Tony’s side and was currently spending his time trying to reach a chunky hand up to touch Tony’s beard.  A chunky, sticky hand, which was impossible, because he’d been holding the kid—Steve, he amended—since he found him in a pile of rubble and empty uniform trying to gnaw on the edge of the shield with the three teeth he currently had, and there had not been anything sticky around.  And yet, stickiness.
“You were perfect, Steve.  Absolutely breathtaking.  I’m going to use you now.  Fill you up and come inside you,” Tony told him, as if he could see into Steve’s head the way he could see the chessboard.  Steve nodded slowly and dropped his head to the bed as soon as Tony released him.  He thought he might have said please.
“I’m going to fuck your mouth now,” Tony told him, which was all the warning he got before Tony slammed his cock back in again, sliding past Steve’s tongue and down his throat again, momentarily making Steve’s vision blacken before he pulled back and started thrusting in earnest.  Tony’s hands were in his hair, gripping his head now, holding him there, anchoring him, keeping him steady.
She didn’t so much as blink, Steve saw, stomach churning. Behind him, he heard a small sound from Cam, and turned to see the boy biting his lip, eyes wide.
Not, of course, as any of them had intended.
That was crazy. Pepper was an idiot. A complete and utter idiot, and she was putting thoughts into Steve’s head.  Bad thoughts, untrue thoughts and why would she do that? This was pure and true and right, and Steve shouldn’t be concerned about anything remotely like that.  Now Steve was concerned and it was all Pepper’s fault.  And Pepper needed to tell Steve, tell him right now, that she hadn’t meant it, that such a thing wasn’t possible, and that this was pure and true and right, and she really needed to use those words and then stop speaking, except maybe to tell Steve that this was pure and true and right, just in case he wasn’t sure.  Maybe she could send some kind of expert over?  Were there bonding doctors?  Sure there were.  There had to be.  They could tell Steve that this was pure and true and right and Pepper didn’t know what she was talking about and--
“I did,” Steve said curtly.  “It was suggested that he should rethink his position.”
to be with you.  I meant what I said, Steve.  I—I want this.  I do, I swear.  You have to believe that. I wouldn’t—not when you didn’t know.  I was going to tell you.  I just, I wanted a day.  It was stupid, I know, but I wanted a day.  To get it right.  Finally.  To show you I could, I guess, I don’t know.  Maybe you’d give me another chance then or something.  Fuck, I don’t know what I was thinking.  I wasn’t.  I just wanted—I wanted a day, okay?  Which, yeah, obviously did not work out, understatement of the century,” Tony grumbled, scratching at the back of his head, then letting his hand drop to rub against his neck in unconscious mimicry.   “Why would you even think that?” Tony snapped.
“Sometimes it’s better to track than arrest,” Clint pointed out.  “Klaue has moved a lot of his operations to less shady businesses, that’s true, but it’s all a smokescreen for what he’s really involved in.”
“It is important to you, which, I suspect, makes it vastly more important to your Captain than you imagine,” Jarvis replied.  “Now.  I believe an introduction is in order, if you please.”
“Nothing to be sorry about.  You were beautiful.  Perfect,” the King said softly, dropping his hand down to cradle Steve’s chin.  “I don’t usually care,” he added with a slight frown before giving his head a quick shake.  “Let’s get you to bed.  Think you can walk?”
“Nice,” Tony said admiringly.  He found he meant it, a bit to his surprise.  He could see some of the progression of Steve’s efforts as he learned, and this latest one had something the others were trying for, but not quite managing.  “Like the colors.  Little bit of hot rod about that red.  Speaking of, you should let me take you for a drive sometime.  Upstate, maybe.  Get out of the city.  I’ve got a place in the Hamptons.  We could go there for a weekend or something.”
“In my defense, you said she’d like them, and I have an obsessive need to be liked, come on, Steve!  What was I supposed to do?” Tony demanded, pushing his goggles up onto his head and throwing his hands into the air.
Steve followed next to him as they walked back through the Castle grounds with only a couple of guards on their heels.  Servants, slaves and various courtiers jumped aside and bowed or curtsied as Tony passed through the halls, and Steve could feel their gazes sweep over him, fleeting and curious, before quickly moving away, as if they feared being caught staring too long at something that did not belong to them and displeasing the King.
He texted Brock.  It sat on ‘Delivered’ for long enough that Steve gave up and put the phone down.  He turned the TV on to a sports channel just to have some background noise and started packing and cleaning up the room a bit, since they had to check out pretty soon.  Finally, a few minutes before they were due to check out, Steve heard the door open, and turned to find Brock with his phone pressed to his ear talking to someone about what sounded like a game of poker.  He caught Steve’s eye, looking surprised for a moment, then quickly finished his call and pocketed his phone.
“What I get out of it?” Tony bit out.  “I get—“ he broke off, grinding his teeth together in an effort to keep the words in.  What did he get?  He got the devil you know, he supposed with a dull pang that seemed to shake through his whole body.  The one sitting next to him, who had at least made a show of trying.  “It would be an honor to be your Omega, Captain,” Tony said stiffly.
“Oh,” Steve replied.  “You think that’s a good idea? After…before?”
“You got my email,” he said.
“He wasn’t one of Rumlow’s.  Not really. Came in on a raider ship.  They fished him out of the sea, to hear Jasper tell the story.  Half frozen and clinging to part of a ship.  Rumlow just took him off of their hands.  He caused a bit of a ruckus, apparently, and Rumlow got him for a song,” Zola explained.
“Colonel Phillips is here?” Steve asked in shock.  “Why?”
affect us?  Tony, you can’t be serious,” Steve protested.
, he calls them.  Fanciful nonsense, I say.  As if what I provide the Crown isn’t sufficient,” Hammer sneered.
Tony barked out a laugh.  “Sure, with your magic finger whammy thing.  Ghosts of relationships past would very much like a piece of that, let me tell you."
“Almost ready,” Tony said with a quick smile.
“Doesn’t matter,” Stark said, slashing a hand through the air.  “You look like a...practical kind of guy, let’s say, who could probably settle this little philosophical debate Steve and I were having.  What do you say?  Now, no fair siding with Steve here just because you two are together, which you wouldn’t do anyway because you’re not that kind of guy, right?”
Well.  No time like the present, he figured, glaring at the clock, which ticked accusingly onward, and pushed himself out of bed, rubbing both hands over his face with a groan.  He picked up Steve’s dog tags from the bedside table where he’d tossed them last night and put them on, the now-familiar cool weight of them settling in the divot of his chest.
At first, they’d given him some kind of medicine they said would help.  It didn’t, though he did sleep for long enough to dream, and that had ended with eight white-clad SHIELD orderlies trying to calm him down while a doctor pumped some kind of tranquilizer into his arm.  They stopped giving him the medication. So, now, it was short bursts of rest followed by waking abruptly, heart slamming against his ribs, gulping down air and trying not to panic.
, Tony replied.
“My painting sold!” Steve said proudly, reaching out to squeeze Tony’s hand. "The one I just brought back.  Someone called to buy it!"
“Put the boy on the phone,” Rhodey demanded brusquely.

“A life stud--Steve…Steve, exactly who did you use for a model? I’ve seen your place. No way you can afford to hire a nude model—wait. I want my painting. I want my painting right now,” Tony rushed out, grabbing Steve by the shoulder as he shoved him along. Steve was laughing and trying to look away. “And I owe my CEO some stock options, apparently. By the way, when you meet her, please call her Madam Potts. I need this to happen.”
“Welcome back. Room Six, I understand?” the man said. Steve nodded. Steve tapped the box on the empty tablet screen. The man hummed approvingly and pointed towards a hallway.
