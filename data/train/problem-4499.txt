Pulling himself upward, Dean scanned the area. Cas was on the other side of the room crouched over the decapitated body of the man he was struggling to fight. There was another vamp slowing inching her way towards him from behind, metal glinting in her hand.
"Oh. Yeah. Thanks, Cas." Dean grabs the shirt fast enough that it unravels in his hands and he frantically shoves it into a ball cradling it to his chest. "I must have left that here when ... when - "
"Dean, look at me." Dean slowly lifted his gaze to his brother's. His face was smooth, eyes full of sympathy. "You have that time
Sighing long and slow, Dean shifted towards Cas, softening." Come on Cas', are there any specifics you can think of?"
Something was
"You missed me?"
He sighed contently, before dropping his head backwards, settling. He lifted the arm resting on Cas' back to stretch both above his head in a slow growing groan. His movement shifted Cas who froze, scared of Dean's potential response.
Cas wrapped his arm around Dean's back drawing him closer. "I missed you too, Dean."
Dean drew his eyes back to Cas frantically searching for any sign of life, soaking in the beautiful natural blue of his eyes, letting himself drown in their shallow waters desperate to let it wash away the other unnatural blue.
"Cas," Dean stepped forward, forcing himself into Cas' vision, "you're not useless. This isn't hopeless, we'll figure it out."
"What?" Dean chirped, hand wrapped around his ear talking unreasonably loud, like an elderly grandma who refused to turn on her hearing aid. "What was that?"
When the portal opened violently expelling a beige blur Dean's eyes had trouble catching, he almost fell with the weight of his relief. In fact if it wasn't for Sam's arms still clutching him, lest another dumb self-sacrificing decision was made that day, he was certain that he would have landed in a pile on the grass like a collapsible folding chair.
“I um… Well I wanted to tell you that… I” Dean stuttered struggling under the weight of Cas’ gaze.
Rubbing his hand down his face, Dean yawned “What?”
"Coffee?" Dean asked, hesitantly extending a cup to Cas’ chest. Cas nodded, accepting the mug from Dean's hands. His shoulders were tense, the grip on his cup tight.
"No," Dean waved his hand dismissively through the air, "not just... we should hang out more, just us."
Cas started at the gun apprehensively, but grumpily pulled it towards his chest.
It scared Cas to have his core shaken as roughly as a building in an earthquake, foundation crumbling tearing everything down with it. To be left amongst the rumble with nothing but his own hands and a jar of cement to piece something new together.
But Dean freezes hand in mid air, eyes widening “I,” he says slow and disbelieving. Cas takes a deep breath holding his chest in tight apprehension. Dean's never said that before he's said other things, things that Cas knows are Dean's way of trying as close as he can get, but those words came out clear, simple and true.
"Who?" Dean asked hesitantly.
Dean laughed, throwing one arm around Cas' shoulder and drawing him into his side. “Ah see you have nothing to worry about, still the same old Cas. Besides, we're safe right now so at least for the moment you can at least try and relax a little.”
"Man, I haven't been on a Ferris wheel in so long. The view from the top of something like this is beautiful. You can see all the lights stretched out." Dean stopped bouncing on his heels, turning to look at Cas, a support smile growing on his face. "You'll love it."
, you can't just hit a guy with a question like that when he's trying to relax.
Dean shakes his head forcing himself to think of other thoughts, anything, anything other than the heavy slumped weight of Cas' body in his arms. The wing marks, his grace, his true self scorched in the ground forever. Instead he takes several deep breaths and thinks of Sam, he still has Sam and as long as he still has his little brother Sammy no matter how hard or unfulfilling life may seem he'll make it.
Pushing himself to his feet, he struggled, not used to the sudden weight of a body. His limbs felt heavy and stiff.
"Thank you." Cas pulled the box of tapes squinting at their names, struggling to recognise them.
If his gaze drew to Cas’ to insure that the man really was beside him then no one needed to know. At least not at that moment. The time would come and Dean would tell Cas, but in this instant he was content to sit in the silence with nothing but stolen glances ensuring his friend was still by his side.
"I know what I'm doing Dean." Cas' voice rumbled, deep and echoey like an animal snarling in a cave. It reminded Dean of the first time they'd met. A barn in the middle of nowhere, Cas’ assuming strong presence, the flash of his winged silhouette filling the walls. It was weird to think that this was the same person standing in front of him so many years later. Dean knew that Cas still had that strength and righteous furry, the kind that could not be taken or broken, not with his body, not when it was buried deep into his veins. But Dean also knew that conviction led to nothing but death and disaster if it was driven without the power and control needed to keep it.
Dean dragged his eyes upward. It wasn't the three magic words that he had been hoping to say but it was something. A confession of sorts. Cas was smiling and Dean found his heart beat began to slow, maybe he wasn't as bad at this as he thought. Maybe he hadn't made some cheesy love deceleration, but he'd gotten Cas to smile, to really smile and Dean was going to hold on to that image. To the knowledge that he in some form had the power to make Castiel happy.
"Wow, that is
But instead he's stuck in the cold, in the dark, on the hard earth staring at some etchings in the ground. As he runs his fingers around the shape of one of the smaller feathers, he's careful  not to disturb their beautiful outline.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Okay what if I cook you some bacon and promise to pick up something better on the way?”
"Please."
Sam pushed out his chair with a sigh leaning across the back to look at his brother. "I know, I am too. But I don't know if confronting him is the best idea right now."
Cas glares at Dean with practiced sharp eyes. "And I," Dean lifts his hand between them bopping Cas on the nose, "love you
“Coffee." Cas repeated, holding out the cheap paper cup toward Dean.
Shyly Cas pointed to one of the bags that hung along the side of the booth. "Okay pink it is. Good choice."
"Yeah."
“Hey just because I've started to go to bed at night and yelled at you for playing the music too loud, and left that club like a week ago does not make me old.”
“Hey” Dean leaned to the side, torso tilting as he tried to force his face into Cas’ line of sight. “I understand. Take as long as you need.”
" Resting his hand on Cas' shoulder Dean used his weight to turn him sideways so they were sitting face to face. He breathed deeply, before dropping his hand over Cas' where it rested on his thigh. "You're
"Oh."
you'd be willing to put in the work."
Dean knows that tone, and simply grunts in reply. It's the tone of voice he uses when he wants to talk even when he knows Dean doesn’t want to.
"Okay we're here."
Cas' body bolted upwards, before his mind could move. His chest rose and fell as fast as bricks succumbed to tremors. It felt like stones were pouring gratingly along his throat filling his lungs till they were stuck pumping air around them, oxygen wheezing its way through in pants and gasps.
"First things first." Dean announced wrapping his hand around the back of Cas' headrest to look around his chair and carefully pull Baby out of his oh so perfect parking job if he does stay so himself. Pulling his arm back, correcting the wheel and driving out of the bunker Dean turned towards Cas. "Music. Every good road trip needs music. So come on, pull out the box from the glove compartment and hand it here."
"Please Cas come back. I can't lose you not again"
"Dean?" Hand wrapped around the doorknob Dean freezes, thoughts of sleep and his memory foam mattress fleeing. Shoulders drooping, he turns heading towards Cas' voice.
"I'm glad he's doing better." Sam took a long sip of his tea, eyebrow raised. "
"Told him what Sam?"
"Cas!" It took a couple seconds for Dean's eyesight to return, a couple seconds too long. The light was still there though it had already started to dull. Dean could see it flowing out from Cas's mouth, his eyes, even below his skin was glowing.
"I love him, Sammy."
Dean thunks his head back against the wall, using what little strength he can summon to pull Cas closer till there are only several inches between them. “
Standing too quickly Dean swayed side to side. He knew he was being too loud, that he would end up waking Sam or Jack, but he didn't care. He wasn't sure if he really cared about anything anymore
A Soft whimper, like that of an injured animal being bandaged, falls involuntarily from Dean's tight pressed lips.
Sam huffed light air expelling from his mouth. "Yeah, okay. Have fun on your date."
Dean watched from the corner as Cas glared at the coffee pot. He laughed lightly, startling Cas causing him to jump.
"Dean, are you okay?"
"Anyways," Sam waved his hand dismissively through the air," Jody needs help with a case. Thinks her murderer turned out to be a couple of demons. So I'm gonna uhh head out for a few days."
“What do you want?”
He prays to Cas again like he does every night and every day and practically every moment he's awake and he can only get through "Cas, Please", before he passes out from the exhaustion.
"And that's supposed to make me feel better?" Dean slammed the dresser drawer, cringing when he remembered that Cas was on the side of the wall.
"Okay, Cas." Dean stood chair scraping against the tile as he turned, stepping towards his room. Even though Dean's limbs felt heavy and stift and he was still covered in scratch from the last hunt,  he wasn't sure if he could go to sleep, scared that letting go of Cas could lead him to disappearing again. If he couldn't see him, how could he be certain that he was still alive? He had to make sure some way that Cas was alive.
Bored of staring at the same wall for days on end, Dean wanders down the halls of the bunker aimlessly only stopping when he inevitably finds himself outside of what used to be Castiel's room.
Dean raised his arm waving it at Sam "No, don't."
Today was different though, he was so many things that it was hard for him to choose if he was somehow all of them at once or somehow none of them.
His voice is strained as if no sound can make it past the crushing weight on his chest.
"When have you ever known me to want to talk?"
Jack, he may not know the nephilim boy well but the kid needs him and he has to help him. It's what Cas would have wanted. Cas had faith in Jack before they had the chance to meet and Dean needs to have faith in Jack, faith in what Cas believed. And he was starting to think he was right so far Jack had proven to be someone special in his innocence and desire to help everyone, to see the good in the world. A trait that Dean had never had the privilege to know, thrown too fast into the darkest twisted horrors the world of monsters and men had to offer.
Reaching over Dean placed his hand on top of Cas', stilling his fingers. “It’s okay to be afraid. What with everything that's happened to us."
Outstretching his hand forward, Dean gestured to Cas. "Okay hand her here."
"Cas'' He repeated somewhere between concern and a question. His eyebrows furrowed and his lips pulled into a frown. Cas could tell that he was trying to keep his face as natural as possible, but Dean had always felt too much rather than too little.
A quick scope of the area and Dean was certain they had the right spot.
Through gritted teeth Dean said. "You know why not."
Raising his hand, Dean waved over the waitress ordering himself pancakes, a substantial amount of bacon and a coffee for Cas.
Too much.
for this, so either figure
Cas flipped the page in his book fast enough a tear grew across the corner. "Well I wouldn't
“Well, I’m feeling pretty stupid right now.”
Placing his hand over his mouth Dean fails to stifle his yawn.
"Um...", Dean pushed off the wall forcing himself to walk closer to Cas before he ran away in embarrassment. "when you were gone I missed you so I ..."
"Why don't you pick this time, I had to last time."
Cas nodded, wrapping his arms around Dean. "Thank you." Dean startled but wrapped his arm tightly around Cas' waist.
Dean sighed, waving his hands around even when his elbows stayed resting on his knees. "Okay maybe not effortless, but life can be a lot harder than it seems. I'm an adult with my own bed for once and I still can't sleep the recommended eight hours. I'm lucky if I can get five."
Dean turned, smile growing on his face. Wrapping his fingers right around Cas' wrist, he pulled him towards the brightly decorated stalls. "Attempt number one, games. When we were little Sam learned about how carnival games are rigged and we managed to figure out a couple of tricks to actually win them. Come on, let me teach you."
“Cas!!” Dean screamed as he ran, pushing his limbs as fast as he could. Cas looked up. The girl’s eyes were paranoid darting between Dean and Cas as she stepped forward knowing she’d lost the element of surprise. She raised the blade, but before she could swipe downwards, Dean swung putting all his force into his arms, chopping off her head.
"Dean! You're being ridiculous. I know this is hard for you. And I know that this is probably harder for you than it is for me, but that doesn't mean I'm not also struggling. Cas was important to me too. But keeping all your feelings in and pretending there not there is stupid. When has that ever worked for you Dean? I'm just trying to help okay? I just want you to talk to me."
He whipped his head downward bracing for some form of attack, but looking down he saw Cas. Sprawled half on top of Dean with his head resting below Dean’s collar bone, one arm wrapped around Dean’s waist, the other hanging off the edge of the bed.
Dean groaned, turning back to his pan where he removed his burnt pancake placing it on his own pile behind the first that he was not going to give to Cas. Not that he was trying to impress him or anything, it would just be easier to get him to actually like food if it was cooked to Dean's full potential.
Cas lifts his hand, rubbing it gently through the short strands of Dean's hair, watching as his fingers glide through the strands before they fall back to his head. He humms reassuringly.
“Hey,” Dean rested his hands over his chest where his heart is, acting as if he were wounded, “don't give up hope yet. I'm young, I've still got my chance.”
"Have lost my grace?” Cas looked down at his hands, he could see dirt under his fingernails, and thin red scratches left from rocks and brambles. He stared, feeling everything the dull stinging ache, the air around him, the warmth hidden underneath his skin. “It would appear so."
The door swung open, "What is it this-"
I tried writing this chapter in a slightly different style and I really like how it turned out. This chapters my favourite thing I’ve written so far. Please tell me what you think, I love receiving comments.
"Castiel was a good person because he tried to help people?"
Dean smiled the widest he can ever remember smiling. A small disbelieving giddy laugh falls from his lips before he can help it.
Startled by the sound of Sam's voice behind him Dean loosened his hold on Cas, slowly dropping his arms brushing them against Cas' gently as he pulled away.
He was trapped in this seemingly never ending conflicting pain. The heat of the flames as his wings burned around him, the cold of the wind stinging his chest, the crushing weight of his lungs and chest. All he could do was feel, so much at once he wasn’t sure if he truly felt anything at all.
Sam grabbed a plate placing a piece of toast and some scrambled eggs onto it while rolling his eyes. “Thanks.” He muttered somewhere between frustrated and apprehensive.
“Dean” Shoulders slumping, Cas’ looks exhausted.
Cas tilted his head, furrow appearing between his brows. "How is having fun different from pleasant if they're both enjoyable experiences?"
Dean's not sure how long he's been kneeling in the cold wet grass, cas' body pulled to his chest. Leaning over resting his chin onto Cas' soft dark hair, he thought of the all of times he'd wondered what if felt like, if it was soft, what it would be like to drag his fingers leisurely through the strands, he'd wondered, he'd yearned, he'd hoped, but not like this, not like this.
Nodding, Dean tried to move out of Cas' grip to catch a glimpse over the edge.
Dean stares at the grooves in the table, "what makes you think that I want your help?"
But his years of thinking, of wondering surged forward. Normally he pushed these thoughts down, hiding them in the darkest part of his mind, but he lets them stay, let's the force of his desire push him forward.
"It's not like that." Dean rested his elbow on the counter, waving his hand around as he talked. "It's just nice to get to spend some time with him."
“The bacon.” Cas prompted, head tilting towards the pan.
"I tried and almost threw up so … thanks but no I don't think that's gonna work."
"So," Dean drums his fingers against the wheel, "what do you think?"
'' Dean sighed, using the arm he had grabbed Cas shoulder with, to wrap around him leading him forward. "We should do this more often."
“Well then I'll just have to throw more.”
God. He's about to kiss Cas. His best friend Cas. The person he's been secretly in love with for almost a decade. It's almost too much to think about.
"Metallica," Dean drummed his fingers on the steering wheel in time with the song, "good choice."
Cas pulled backwards trying to hide the disappointment in his voice. “You should sleep, it is late and rest is important.”
“Okay.” Cas stepped forward, sliding his hand into Dean’s, a brush of skin on skin.
If it wasn't for Sam's freakishly large arms around his waist, Dean was certain that he would have jumped through the glowing portal. He didn't care if they no longer had the cage or any concrete way to overpower Lucifer he would be leaving with his angel.
“What?” Dean whispered voice light as it drifted through the empty air.
"No,” Dean lifted his hand in a placating gesture, “you
The silence settled amongst the rolling of sand, the crashing of waves, the whipping of the wind and screeching cry of seagulls circling in small circles around their heads. It wasn't completely comfortable, not yet, but they had been through this before, hurtful words and sorrys that couldn't quite patch the bleeding wounds. They would find their way through this with time, the same way the coral that once lined the beachside found themselves scattered amongst the sand in millions of pieces, with repetitive motions and learning to trust that the calming waves would come.
Sam stopped, page halfway in the air, scowl already forming. “Dean.” He reprimanded. “There's not much written on angels, especially on them becoming human. It's going to be a while till we find anything.”
“Well you should.
"You know Dean, talking about how you feel isn't bad. It's actually extremely healthy and something you should try to do more often."
“Dean," Cas's voice is smooth, calming and patient like the stream of a river batting against a rock, "I know you’re not good at saying how you feel, but I understand what you mean.”
"I'll stay." Cas nodded and then nodded again and then again, eyes tracking the pattern of the carpet.
Cas glared at his side order of bacon. "You know eating that much saturated fats will kill you."
"Are you sure?" Bracing his arm on the back of his chair, Dean turned to face Sam. "If Jody's called for help it's gotta be something bad."
However, Sam knew that the scream was important that the literal spawn of Satan could just as likely lead to their doom. With one final glance at his brother, Sam turned running towards the house, knowing Dean would be incapable of anything at the moment.
here. So what do you think that means?”
” he repeats louder, bright, happy. Cas can't help but smile watching as Dean pulls away to stare at him, body completely lax and eyes fond. Cas could never have guessed that Dean would be like this someday, but now that Cas knows, the image of him relaxed and content in his arms is burned into his retinas, something no monster or creature could latch away.
It took several seconds for the world to distinguish itself. When Dean’s eyes adjusted to the soft light filtering through the room, he's struck by a bizarre off center feeling. Everything seemed wrong, not in a way that’s bright and glaring, but in a subtle shift as if the world had titled a few degrees in his sleep. The door seemed to be on the wrong side of the room, the walls had a distinct lack of pictures and band posters.
"How's Jack doing?" God, is that the best you can come with right now, really Dean. Cas isn't good at subtlety; he's never gonna pick up on your feelings. Maybe Sam is right, as horrifying as the thought is that the only way Cas would know would require you to tell him straight, well maybe not straight, out.
"I thought I understood.” Cas’ voice carried wispy as the wind that bounced off the planes of his cheeks and flew feather soft through his hair. “And I did to an extent, but I never truly understood how little agency humans have over their own body."
Cas drew his eyebrows together, rubbing one hand over his stomach.
“I - I” Dean Stares eyes wide, legs shaking, as the walls he built around himself tremble and shake, threatening to crush him in the rubble.
? I should be able to
Cas knew that not everyone had nightmares, that they are not the natural state for humans, but they seemed to follow him everywhere. He knew that Dean had nightmares, whether he admitted it or not. He’d seen several of them when he was still the guardian angel protecting the Winchester’s, back when he was the one protecting them. Now it felt as if their roles had switched.
Dean turned, pulling a rifle from the trunk of the car, "So to stop you from getting pulverised by overconfidence we're having shooting practice."
"But there was one time when I was like five that I threw up on the cop that pulled us over for speeding. Side note if you want to get away with something, carry a toddler around. They always have a good chance of spontaneously combusting on strangers, sure fire way to get you out of practically anything."
Staring down at Cas, Dean couldn’t help but wonder what was going to happen in the future. He wondered about what would change and found for once he wasn’t scared of the possibilities. His first thought wasn’t about doom or pain, but rather about how glad he was to have Cas back by his side. When he thought he’d lost Cas forever he'd been forced to face how much he needed him and now that he was back Dean was determined never to let him go again.
A part of him was certain that this couldn't be real, Cas couldn't possibly be back because Dean Winchester doesn't get second chances, Dean Winchester doesn't get a happy ending. No his life is one fucked up ball of never ending ever growing pain and suffering.
Dean rolled his eyes. "Yes Cas was there with me. We went to the diner at the corner cause I hadn't had breakfast yet and then we went to the store."
Dean grabbed the cotton candy from the vendor exchanging it for the change he had jingling in his pocket. "Man being a kid is the best. I am going to give you the best childhood an adult could ask for."
“Sorry.”
"I believe this is yours." Cas pulls out a plaid shirt from the closet, folding it in his hands and passing it over to Dean.
Cas grunted frustratedly.
Flipping a pancake, Dean placed the beautiful masterpiece onto the small stack next to him. “This is for Cas. He's still not used to food, and you know it's hard to convince him to eat. I mean his stomach grumbled yesterday and he freaked out, had no idea what it meant. He was scared he was gonna die-”
Groaning, Dean pushed himself off the counter. "I'm worried about him. He's not acting like himself."
Watching Cas’ face, Dean waited for a sign, any sign that Cas had heard him. He’s surprised to see a soft smile slowly lift Cas’ face and the tension fall from his shoulders. “I love you too, Dean.”
"Am I not already an angel with a shotgun?"
"You left me," He chuckled humorlessly "You goddamn chose that son of a bitch Lucifer over me."
Dean laughed. "I suppose you are, but the point is for you to use a shotgun. standing there being pretty isn't going to help defeat evil."
It's several more seconds of staring, though its not awkward it stopped being awkward a long time ago, before either of them say anything.
Sam cringed surprised by the anger in his brother's voice "I put Jodi on it"
"Hey"
Dean nodded as if he understood the sentiment.
"I missed you." Deans staring straight ahead, but he can still feel Cas' eyes boring into him. It's silent for several seconds and Dean begins to wonder if Cas even heard him, but when he turned his head Cas was staring at him intently.
"Christ how could have been so stupid?" Dean was pacing now back and forth the sound of his feet echoing almost as loud in the silence as the pounding in his head and his heartbeat in his ears. "What were you thinking getting yourself killed? That nothing would come of it, that you could just disappear and no one would notice. What did you think I wouldn't notice? That I wouldn't care?"
"That's true. We could learn valuable information."
They stepped down and off to the side the way the worker instructed.
Cas eyed the remote sceptically, "You never let me pick."
Cas lays a heavy hand on Dean's shoulder, forcing him into the moment. “You can’t deny that I know you. I have been here for
Delicately like a fallen petal graces the grass, Cas rested his hand on the outside of Dean’s arm, fingers splayed around the crook of his elbow. "Dean, I understand. I get why you did it."
how to fight."
Cas rolled his eyes even as a stupidly fond disbelieving smile pulled at his lips. “For helping me, believing in me. And I am sorry too for overreacting. You were only looking out for me and I let my own insecurities cloud my judgement. I wanted to come to the case to be helpful again. I feel like I am
Sam was staring at him, eyes already red and puffy with a look of frantic desperation, fearing that he may have not only lost Cas but that in some ways he had lost his brother too.
Dean was thinking, a dangerous activity he knew. He wanted to do more to help the angels, to help Cas, but Sam was right that if all the angels were human it would be hard to weed out the normal human crazy delusional shit from the powerless angels.
"Just what?"
Dean froze bile rising in his throat. "Of course I missed you Cas, you're my best friend." Dean rubbed the back of his neck forcing his eyes away from the picture on the bed, Dean's arm around Cas and one of his far to rare laughs. "Besides, it's boring when you're not around and I'm stuck with nothing but my brother and unreasonable piles of research."
A harsh wet chuckle cuts through the heavy air the way a knife cuts through wood, clanky and grating. “Great start there.”
Sam stepped forward past Dean, voice unbearably soft and calming. "Time, research. We'll find something just like we always do."
No matter how hard he tries, he can never keep his mind off of Cas or that night. Downing the rest of his beer, savouring in the burn in his throat, Dean opens his laptop to look for his case. The anger burns inside him below the surface and Dean is scared that he won't be able to hold off his feelings for long and he's scared that once they take control he'll never be free of the pain and the sadness and the longing and desperation again. He needs release, he's hoping for something vicious and violent, something he can hack to bits. Otherwise he's scared that it won't be the monster he'll be aiming his aggression towards.
"You can turn on the radio or choose something from the cassette tapes." Dean leaned over, hand steady on the wheel, to pull down the glove compartment.
Upon seeing Sam’s smirking face Dean gently smacked his brother's arm “Shut up.”
?" There was venom in his voice, heat burning up his throat. "You don't know that my-"
"Whoohoho," slamming one palm on the counter, Sam used his other to gesture at Dean, hand waving side to side, "don't think you can get out of this so easily. I am not returning until you and Cas are on speaking terms. And that does mean you will have to apologise to him."
Dropping his head in his hands, he let out a shaky breath. He just wants it to stop, he needs it to stop. The flashes of memory, the feeling of Cas growing cold and limp in his arms, the sound of the cry in his voice as the blade struck him, the echo of his body hitting the floor, the emptiness in his eyes and the unmoving state of his limbs.
Turning his face away, Dean nodded, profile glowing in the starlight. “I used to drive Sam out to look at the stars when we were younger.”
He spent several seconds staring down at Cas watching, suddenly understanding Cas' unnerving habit of watching him sleep.
"What," Sam turned towards Dean, "started it? First of all Dean, what are you in kindergarten? Stop with this he started it nonsense. Besides you know that's not true, he said those things because you hurt him."
"Casssssssss!?!" He screamed at least he thought he was screaming, he couldn't hear or maybe it was that he couldn't process any sound above the voice screaming in his head "Cas, Cas, Cas is died and it's all your fault you let him die. Cas,Cas,Cas" over and over again.
"Why would that - oh." Cas eyes widened "You're scared of heights."
"Line the end of the gun with the target and pull the trigger. There's gonna be a kick back, but don't worry you're going to be fine."
? Huh?" Dean breathed deeply, trying to keep the mental images flashing in his head tucked away with all the other thoughts he was too scared to sort through. He didn’t want to think of all the things that could go wrong. He didn’t want to think about what it would be like to watch Cas in pain, to get so close
Hesitantly Cas copied Dean. Pulling off his borrowed tennis shoes and sitting on the edge of the blanket, feet sifting through the sand.
"Nope." Dean places his lips against Cas' forehead before turning it into a raspberry,
"Roller coasters, not your thing. I get it. So  we won't go on any big ones again."
"Really, you'll do it?"
Slowly, careful not to jostle Cas, Dean slid his left arm under Cas’ knees and used his other arm to wrap around his shoulders. Cas was a solid mass, but Dean managed to stand up drawing him closer to his chest.
Waking was just as daunting and confusing.
worthless like this."
Cas. He should be
"Hey!" Dean nudged his brother, narrowing his eyes. "I'm trying here. Are you sure there isn't some subtler way I can do this and avoid all the mushy lovey dovey chick-flick moments."
Dean smiled causing his cheeks to ache, he wasn't sure how long it had been since he smiled. "It's Cas, he's alive."
Dean swatted at his brother, earning him a signature Sam bitchface. "What did I just say?"
Dean reached into the seat behind pulling out a cooler of beer, and a couple of sparkles he’d found at a gas station.
"You mostly. I don't like watching you get hurt. I never know what to do when others get hurt and I keep wondering what would have happened if I wasn't there, if I hadn't been able to push you through. I know I wouldn't be able to do that now. What if something happens and you get
"What?" Dean turned his head quickly from side to side. Lifting his hands, Cas used them to turn Dean's head to look at him. "That means we're going to start going back down. Okay. The worst is over."
"Okay cool, I've got a few things to grab, you finish up here, get dressed or whatever you need to do and then meet me by Baby."
Cas shook his head. “You don’t give yourself enough credit. You never do. You're a
Dean thought Cas was beautiful, it wasn’t usually a word he thought of in regards to men, but it suited Cas. He was heart achingly beautiful, in a way that made Dean's chest constrict and his breath to feel like fire. Sometimes Cas’ gaze felt sharp and powerful and Dean felt like if he moved in the wrong way he could get cut in its edges, but sometimes Cas’ gaze was soft and comforting in a way that reminded Dean of lazy morning ocean waves and the summer skies of his long past and rare happy childhood days.
Chuckling, Dean wrapped his hand around the copper knob and swung the door inward.
Cas glared up at Dean, eyes as sharp and dangerous as his angel blades.
"Hey," Sam put his hand on Dean's shoulder. "I've never asked him about that stuff. You probably know more than me."
"Cas." Dean said, voice between pleading and pity. "It'll be okay. We'll figure it out like we always do."
"Cas?"
"Look Cas," Dean used his grip on the edge of baby's trunk to turn himself to face Cas. "Being human fucking sucks. I don't think you fully understand just how weak we humans are."

Cupping his arms around his mouth, uptick to his lips, Sam shouted. "That wasn't a no."
"Dean!" Sam glared at him, before turning voice softening slightly but still edged. "Cas." Stupid playing favourites even if he was right. "Stop. We don't have
Cas glared up at him from where he was struggling not to retch, heavy breathing, as he clutched the sighed of the railing.
Cas stared down at his lap, hands unmoving. Dean leaned over grabbing his plate and dishing up items. "Besides I'm getting sick of Sam's stupid energy Pro green shake fitness nonsense monstrosities he keeps trying to fead me, health and all that. "
Dean turned to face Cas lying beside him. “What does that mean? Did your fancy angel vision block you from seeing somehow?”
Dean had seen Lucifer kill or at least graciously maim enough people near him to know that there was no way this was going to end well. He couldn't lose Cas not now. Not with everything else changing in his life, not that was new everything always seemed to be changing around him. But even though Cas had betrayed them, even though he'd abandoned him and Sam more times then Dean thought he could forgive, he had always been there for Dean when he needed him, one way or another.
Freezing, Dean slowly dropped his arms back to his side, gliding his gaze downward to where Cas was jostled falling off his chest.
"Dean I've existed as you call it for a very long time"
The sky was lit brighter than Cas had ever seen it. At first he thought the orange streaks barrelling through the sky were meteors falling to earth, but they were far too frequent and far too close. When a ball of light fell over the line of the tree's horizon, he realised that the light was his fellow
Dean knows he doesn't deserve this. That he shouldn't be allowed to hold someone’s, certainly not someone as beautiful as Cas, affections. Not when he was so easy to influence and sway. All self-sabotaging worry. But he can't help but
Cas eyed Dean hesitantly. “Bacon.”
Dean blinked his eyes open, groaning low and gravely, air pushing up from the back of his throat. He rolled his shoulder trying to remove the sharp tingles that zapped in waves up and down his side. A small whine of hot air echoed just below his ear. Confused, he slowly tilted his head down to find, dark hair falling across his shoulder brushing against his neck, an arm wrapped loosely around his stomach and legs pressed heavily against his side, thigh to thigh. A small pile of drool collected on his lips. Who knew Cas could be so clingy?
thing."
Through laughter bright and airy, Sam smiled a small rare shine of joy.
"First," exclaimed Dean, grabbing Cas' hand and dragging him over to a bright red stall like a child at a birthday party, "these. Oh man cotton candy. I haven't had this since I was a kid. My dad didn't let us go to places like this. But when I first got Baby, I used to sneak away with Sam, if he didn't have school goody tooshes he is, and take him to places like this."
Dean leaned his weight against the counter, hoping he could use it to push down the nausea clawing at his throat. He had never meant to hurt Cas. To make him feel like a weapon only needed in times of war, placed on a shelf to collect dust until the next conflict arose.
"It's an expression Cas. It means that I'm free whenever you want to come talk. Okay?"
Dean blinked “It's not that.” Upon seeing Cas confused frown, Dean clears his throat. “It's not that I’m not worried about you, because I am. It's just that’s not what I wanted to talk to you about.”
Dean struggled to open his eyes against the brightness. Moving his head, he groaned at the strain in his neck.
"Well not personally no," Cas' voice was calm and steady, casual even, "but he was talked about at the time. And one of my brothers knew him."
..." Dean clasped his hands in front of himself, rocking back onto his heels.
Cas smiled, a small gentle uplifting of his lips. "Okay I’ll keep that in mind."
Sam sighed, "Dean we’re needed here."
Dean smiled gently at Cas and whispered, voice soft and breathy. "Yeah, okay. You've been having a tough time."
"you're dead and you're not coming back, Dammit." Dean looked up screaming as if he could reach up to heaven and drag Cas back if only he was loud enough.
"It's not just purgatory, it's everything. I'm weak with this body. I can't do anything." Cas' voice echoed distortedly loud amongst the silence as his hands waved around him in long broad swipes. "I don't know how to use it, how it works and I still try sometimes to use my power before…" Cas dropped his hands back to his lap, tugging at his lip with his teeth, voice suddenly quiet like the calm steady flow of a river after a flood, "I'm forced to remember"
"Okay that sounds… enjoyable."
It pained him, watching Dean live without Cas, an empty shell of a being.
of people’s time,
"Okay" Dean turned to Cas, voice serious as he pointed the TV remote in front of Cas' face. "A very important part of being human is figuring out what kind of movies you watch. Vital information. "
“What, not exciting enough for you?” Dragging Cas closer, Dean lifted his arm up, pushing Cas in a circle, spinning him in and out. Cas laughed, filling the empty air of the bunker with a lightness. Dean smiled wide and bright. “Come on” His lips softened as undeniable fondness slipped into his voice. Tightening his hold on Cas, he spun them in circles across the kitchen, a crazy whirlwind of haphazard steps.
Cas tilted his head to the side like a curious puppy. “What?”
Sam exhaled loudly from his nose, refusing to look up at his brother.
Sam arched an eyebrow, dubious of his brother’s intentions.
"Because," Sam said slowly as if he was speaking to a small confused child. He pointed at Dean before gesturing vaguely around the kitchen, "I need you and Cas to get over whatever this stupid petty animosity is and I don't think you're gonna do it if I'm here. And if you do genuinely tell him about your feelings I don't really think I want to be here either."
Dean tilted his head to the side in thoughtful ponder. "I’ve never heard many stories from before we met."
He stumbled forward, struggling to move with the new fullness of his legs.
Cas shuffled closer to the water's edge, let the icy crash lap across his toes and up around his ankles. He watched the soft pull of the tide, admired its consistency. Even as the waves changed size, splashing too close to where his jeans had been cuffed around his calf, threatening to soak the material to where it would seep inward sticking to his skin, the waves still drew back and returned to their home. No matter how far they went they always returned home. Always had a home to return to.
“Being human it’s,” Cas glared at the distance, struggling to come up with something that could verbalise his feelings, the worries and struggles that ate at him from within, “
Cas laughs, airy and bright.
"Okay, I'm gonna go set up, you stay right there and don't touch anything."
Dean laughs and Cas can't decide if he wants to stay here forever or if he wants to smoother Dean for being so obnoxiously beautiful. He forces himself to turn onto his side, determined to miss the way Dean throws his head back and the stupid snort falls from his lips.
He exited the impala breathing the open air deeply, letting it refresh his mind. "Nothing like the fresh night air to clear your thoughts.” Cas nodded as if this was important information he was filing away.
Cas tilted his head to the side questioningly. Adorable. But he doesn't look upset, a small disbelieving smile on his face.
"Dean."
“What, it wouldn't leave me alone. Evil little bastards.”
"Dean," Cas huffed arms crossed, wrinkling Dean's old Metallica shirt, "I
Dean nodded, “yeah I know Sammy. And just so you know, I am happy.”
Cas smiled at the ground, a sad sort of smile, the smile one has when looking through memories of long lost friendships. “I know you care and that’s why you do the things you do.” A harsh shaky inhale, and a stuttering of words. “But sometimes it's hard for me to
“Fine.”
After four hours and far too many articles involving food and Floridian deaths, standard crazy Florida shit, he hadn't found anything useful.
Dean laughed, the sound filling the impala with the lightness it had lacked earlier.
But as he looked back over to Cas’ he realized he didn’t have to. Cas understood him in ways few others ever had.
Sam's tried several times since that day to talk to Dean or at least to steal whatever bottle of alcohol he was currently holding. Dean always sees him first however. Scoping out every room before he enters and retreating as fast as possible, Sam’s only managed to corner him once and when all that got him was a broken, "Please don't Sam," he’d given up trying.
"Cas, stop looking out the window. You're gonna get car sick."
There was cackling all around him echoing in the neverending darkness. He could feel nothing but a deep cold and crushing sense of doom. Blinking, he struggled against the sudden bright light glowing all around him somehow crushing in its weight, yet never ending in its expanse. It was blue, a bright unnatural blue crushing him from all sides. As fast as the light came it disappeared and was replaced by long black feathers falling, from where he could not see. He reached his hand out trying to grab one, but when it touched his skin, it crumbled to dust and fell through his fingers.
Sighing, Sam grabbed the box in Dean's hand forcing him to still. "And I'm trying to ask if you've talked to him yet about you know."
Cas shook his head roughly, hair sticking up in all directions swaying around his crown. He struggled to breath lungs heavy as his body shook, sprouting from his spine and down out through waves in his hands.
He turned to see Cas asleep side pressed heavily against his, head resting on his shoulder hair ticking his neck.
He stayed hunched over on the cold forest floor until his eyes had dried and his breaths were slowly and steady.
I'm always scared to write Cas, especially from his point of view, because I have read so many out of character Castiel fics. But I think I'm starting to figure it out. Please tell me what you think.
"Yeah" Dean pumps his first in the air. "Are you ready to admit that I'm right and that they are different experiences?"
"Alright, alright." Dean lifted his hands off the wheel, surrendering under the force of Cas’ gaze.
Settling back into his covers Cas placed the teddy bear next to his pillow, careful to prop it up so that it wouldn't fall to its side.
* * *
Well it's nice to get a break once in a while. And…"
Dean squeezed his way past the other visitors into the museum. The room was large, one side filled with the reconstructed bones of a T-rex, the other lined with glass panels containing crystals and other culturally historical artifacts that were probably stolen.
Chuckling a light puff of air, Dean rolled his eyes. “And you give me so much about it.” He leaned down pulling out a pan. Cas stood awkwardly in the doorway unsure what to do as Dean continued moving, pulling bacon out of the freezer and running the package under cold water.
He closed his eyes fearing the inevitable. As much as the pain ate at his soul he was even scareder of the crash, fearing he would vanish into nothing.
Dean struggles to keep the crack out of his voice, to stop a new set of tears from rolling down his face. "Too damn long"
Cas titled his head to the side. "
His people, they were…
Cas stared out at the waves that lapped up against the shore creating an edge of soapy white bubbles and mirages, dark shadows of where the waves once were rested in wibbly lines spanning from one edge of the beach to the rocks jutting out the other, patches ranging from spun straw gold, honey and maple to hazelnut. Each lap of the sea brought an echoing swoosh on the rocks and a bellow of chilly air that smelled like rock salt and freshly caught fish.
Sighing, Dean waved his hand through the air. “I know. I know.”
"Why am I there in both of these scenarios?"
Dean groaned. "Ugh, can we be done with this mushy shit. I feel like I have spent more time in the last week talking about my feelings than I have in the rest of my life."
Cas glared at Dean, who shrugged, lifting his hands off the wheel. "Hey you had fun so I'm taking it."
Chuckling, Dean sat on the edge of the bed resting his elbows on his knees slumping his chest forward. "Yeah, being human isn't nearly as easy as it looks. I bet I had you fooled all those years making it look effortless."
"Just talk while I'm gone, please. I don't want to have to return back to," Sam rubbed his temples with the pads of his fingers with one hand as he used the other to gesture vaguely between them, "
"Yes." Dean rubbed at his eyes. Staring at Cas in surprise, but it didn't seem to be a bad sort of surprise. He moved to the side, waving Cas into his room.
me before."
It's late well into the morning before Dean finds the energy to leave the bed and it's only because his lack of appetite is starting to cause his stomach to make interesting gurgle noises. Dean had only woken himself up shaking feeling like he was going to throw up three times in the night which he was counting as a success because it was the first night he'd managed to fall back asleep after waking up.
He shouldn't feel this. He shouldn't be hurt at all. He had no major injuries. His wounds, small and superficial. They should have been easy to heal. But when he called on his grace he felt nothing, no rush of pressure, no calming cool, only the continuation of the dull weighty ache.
Slowly, wanting to savour every moment, he dragged his hand along Cas' shoulder and up his slender neck until he was cupping his cheek in his hand. Dean felt the rough scrape off stubble. He could freak out. He could so freak out right now. He is freaking out, not in the I can never take this back kind of way, but more like I can't believe this thing I've been working my whole life towards is finally gonna pay off kind of way. God he thought, I'm about kiss Cas. Cas.
Cas tilted his head to the side in the way that was always so strongly beautifully Cas that Dean often struggled to remember his thoughts. “Did you use to do things like this frequently?”
They were falling because of him, all of them were falling because of him. He felt the wetness return to his eyes.
Dean nodded thankfully spared by the waiter returning with their food.
Cas lifts his middle finger up, waving dangerously close to Dean’s face. "Why don't you get yourself breakfast then. I don't see why I'm- "
"Wow you're getting old. Huh?"
“So?” Sam drawled.
“I love you.” He half shouts, followed by a giddy stupid giggle like a kid huddled under the blankets convinced their parents don't know they're up past their bedtime. He drops his arms back around Cas’ back pulling him closer, he presses a kiss to Cas’ cheek. “I love you.” He whispers before moving up to his eyebrow pressing his lips there lightly. “I love you.”
"What if I'm stuck this way forever?"
Cas tried a small bite of a banana, lips pursed, eyebrows furrowing into a weird face.
Cas laid his hands over where Dean's rested on the handle bars. "Dean, breathe. Okay." Dean nodded, breathing in and out slowly, letting his shoulders drop. "You're going to be okay. We're at the top."
Cas groans pushing him away, Dean laughs, head falling back against the pillow, "oh come on, Cas," Dean leans up onto his elbows, eyebrows raised, "you
Dean laughed short and breathy, shaking his head. "No. No work this time."
Dean turned to see Cas struggling to fight a tall muscular man that had wrapped an arm around Cas from behind. Dean stepped forward, but was stopped by a sudden weight on his back. One of the little fuckers had jumped on his back and was now trying to wrap his hands around his neck. Dean fell letting the added weight drop them both to the floor satisfied by the grunt the vamp below him made. Hopefully the creature had cushioned his fall enough he wouldn’t have to worry about his back tomorrow. He struggled to push himself up, giving the vamp time to grab his arm flipping him onto his back. He leered opening his mouth wide enough that Dean could see all of his teeth. Moving. He was moving forward, thankfully Dean still had his machete. He swung upward closing his eyes and lips tightly waiting for the sound of impact. A loud thud echoed along the wood floor followed by Dea’s  grunting as the body collapsed on top of him. Wiggling, he struggled to roll the full grown man off his chest.
Rubbing his hand up and down the length of Cas' spine, Dean hums understandably. “But I want breakfast.”
Cas' lips tilted upwards in a way no one else would have noticed, but Dean could tell meant he was happy.
"Yeah mental and considering what I have to go through, I think that earns me a little bacon."
"I just…," Dean scratched the hairs at the back of his neck, before bringing his hand forward, steel grip around his mug as he tilted it liquid sloshing towards himself, "I understand now why he feels useless. We only got to know him as an angel for his powers as some sort of," nausea clawed at Dean's throat, "
right
He tried to remember where he was and what had happened, recent memories flashing behind his eyes. He remembered a wisp of wind, and the tumble of sand beneath his fingers, the crushing cold of cobalt waves and the golden hues of sun that fell through a blanket of grey to caress Dean’s face. He remembered the all consuming pull of the ocean, the certainty of its movements, the never ending push and pull. His heart aching jealousy for the waves who always had a home to scurry to. He wanted that surety and he realized that he would never get that sitting in the dark on his rumpled sheets, he had to follow his body’s own pull. And so follow he did, down the bunker’s winding hallways to the door of Dean’s room.
“Okay” sighs, Sam sarcastically.
He tried everything he could think of to distract himself, beer, some personal time with baby, hunting, research trying to talk to and help Jack, he even tried listening and taking Sam's goddamn useless advice. But he was anything but numb, he seemed if anything to increase in emotions, no matter how hard he tried to push them away, to bury them, to burn them, anything so he didn't have to feel so much at once. He couldn't handle it. The pain, the sadness, the anger, the guilt, the resentment even at Cas even if that only led to more guilt.
Dean nodded. "Okay."
Dean squirmed, continuing to move, eyes shifting, before he yawned, stretching his jaw and slowly blinked his eyes open.
“Until then do you maybe want to watch a movie? There’s loads you still need to learn about human culture.”
"He’s made some dumb decisions, but in the end he always tries to do what's right, to try whatever he thinks would help the most people. And I guess in the end that's all that really matters."
He ran, his legs burning, causing him to wonder how humans could survive daily life when every small action seemed to cause so many sensations each so hard to decipher.
"No, not yet." Dean balled the shirt in his hands bringing it to his chest before remembering what he was doing, shaking and refolding it he shoved it into the dresser.
Tentatively he put his hand on Cas' shoulder, familiar territory. Dean has spent years calculating every touch determining what he was and was not allowed to do. Dean let himself cross the barrier, to touch in ways he'd always wanted.
Dean stared at Cas trying and failing to calm the beating of his heart. He’s alive. God Dean rubs his hand down his face; who knew Sam was right it was too early to go back on the case not for Cas, but himself. Was he ever going to be able to get rid of his fear of losing him? Was he ever going to be able to think rationally around the other man? But Dean remembered the pain of the days following Cas’ death and conceded that he was always going to worry about him.
Sam reached forward drawing the angel into a bone crushing hug, startling Cas and earning him several awkward pats on the back.
Cas tilted his head to the side but entered the car anyway.  "Thank you."
Dean lifts his eyebrow, smirk pulling at his lips. "Was it worth the wait?"
Forcing a smile on his lips Dean tried to lighten his voice, a master at acting, deflecting, protecting himself. "Like the car sickness thing. Sounds horrible right?"
It took far too long for Dean to realize he hadn't caught more than a couple of seconds of the show in the last half hour, instead his gaze kept wandering to the angel. He couldn't understand how he was alive, although Dean knew better than to question it.
Sam turned, coffee in hand sliding across the counter to Dean. "You seem happy. How was your time with
Sam leans back into his seat. "Cas! How?"
Cas let himself be pulled down by Dean till he was laying by his side.
Pulling back, Dean leaned his forehead against Cas’, sighing in content.
Sam exhaled slowly trying to remember to be patient with his brother, because he was trying. "Maybe because everytime he tries, you yell at him."
"Yeah maybe she can, unless she ends up dead because you wanted to slip out on her to babysit the antichrist."
"Because we need to stay here.", Sam turned his chair, redirecting to face Dean, "we need to help Jack learn how to handle his powers. Jody can handle this."
Sam glared at Dean "Oh fuck off Dean." he said, voice light and mocking.
“But… But… I’m,” Dean gestured vaguely at his chest as if he could prove his entire existence was worthless.
"What you don't even want to hear about the case?"
Dean knew that he wouldn't be able to sleep, terrified of the nightmares that would accompany him. Instead he sat down in one of the smaller rooms in the bunker.
"What was he like?"
"So what being human is about is seemingly insignificant moments?”
Dean rushed to catch up with Cas who was already out the door.
“That you’re a fool.”
“Yeah. Got to get in the morning cardio. Going for a run.”
Groaning, Cas stretched his back muscles aching from a long night of sleep. His face dragged along something warm and squishy. It took a while for his brain to adjust to his environment. Waking up was disorienting and therefore frightening to Castiel, who had rarely had moments like that. Last night he had gone to Dean and Dean had offered that he could-
When Dean turns back twisting away from him, Cas slipped a small earthy brown coil shell into his pocket. Another trinket to add to his rapidly growing collection of little things to remember the little moments. A token of seemingly insignificant fundamental memories.
Dean forces himself to breathe, a raspy broken inhale. He stares at Cas. Dropping Cas arm it falls lifelessly to his sides. “
Dean breathed deeply hoping to stop the shaking of his hands. He tried to convince himself it was only because he was starting to get well past tipsy, and slowly pushed open the door.
"Fine then.” Dean crossed his arms over his chest, pouting like a disobedient toddler, “I won't tell you."
"Carnival?" Cas repeated as if the word was in some arcic language he didn't understand. "Why would we be going to a carnival? Are there some sort of demonic spirits that attach themselves to carnivals?"
Dean's shoulders lowered, his face slipping. He spoke, voice soft in an unwinchesterly attempt to be comforting. "It's not
Dean used the but of his elbow to nudge Cas' side. "You could chop off my arm, so we could go through this journey of self discovery together."
Resting a hand lightly between Cas’ shoulder blades, Dean leaned down trying to keep the stupid smile from crawling its way across his face. “Come on.”
Dean snorted, taking a long sip of his coffee, before smacking his lips together, looking directly at Sam. "Fuck you."
He had never fallen before.
"You are both grown adults." He groaned, dropping his shoulders and pulling his arm back to his side. "I'm going on a beer run."
"What?" Dean snapped his gaze up from where he was twirling his coffee in hand causing the murky brown liquid to swish along the sides.
Cas could see the frantic concern in the way the light bounced around his eyes as they bore into his skull and realised that not telling him would probably only make him worry more. "I don't know. There are just so many things and I often don't remember the dreams much anyway."
bad."
"I’ll just have the coffee."
Dean stepped backwards, knife waving dangerously through the air.
Sam pats Dean's knee before standing up and stretching, earning him a yawn, and leaves. Dean stares at the bottle still in his hands and chugs another swallow before going back to staring into the darkness.
"No. You're... you're dead." Dean flinched at the words of his brother already forgetting he was even there.
"Was that
"No buts. You are going to apologise to Cas. And you are going to fix this." Sam's voice softened, as he swirled the remaining liquid in his cup where it hit the side in small pitter patters. "Cas needs support not whatever this pretty nonsense is.
"As cliché as it sounds it really is the little things that matter."
He…He was
Cas’ hair tickled Dean’s neck and Dean wondered what it would feel like to drag his fingers through it. So he did, because he didn’t have to feel guilty about his thoughts anymore. His hair was surprisingly thick and soft.
"I'm kidding Cas. But seriously, need anything, come talk to me. My door is always open."
"I can still do things,” Cas' gaze was strong and heavy, his feet planted, but his voice shook wobbling ever slightly, “I'm not
Dean glares over his shoulder. “This is why the food is for Cas and not for you, unappreciative health freak.”
Sam dragged his book closer to himself. "Besides as far as we know all the angel's could have fallen. It'll be nearly impossible to know if we found a real angel if they don't have their powers."
It was going to be fun. It had been forever since Dean has done any kind of target practice, only ever firing in life or death situations. He missed it in an odd melancholy way.
Dean shook his head knowing he was being ridiculous. Pushing aside the various bottles of salt, and satanic symbols, you know average car stuff, no one cleans out their trunks anyway, he grabbed several boxes of ammunition.
Cas nodded listening intently.
Cas laughed, head tilted backwards a small rise to his lips. "Yes there are many things your kind has gotten wrong though you normally figure it out eventually or get as close as human brains are capable of perceiving."
Dean rolled his eyes, a chuckle a single breath long falling into the chilly breeze. "You're seriously bad at this."
"If I agree to think about it, will you let me escape."
"Well what should we do with Cas? He can't exactly come along. He doesn't know how to defend himself yet and I don't want him to accidentally hurt himself. I'm not sure if he's able to take care of himself yet?"
"That seems incredibly dangerous, Dean." Cas said doing what was asked of him anyway.
When Cas says nothing, Dean turns walking as fast as he can back to his room. Once the door is shut and safely looked he turns hitting his head against the wood breathing deeply. Ugh, that was so incredibly akward. Why did I have to be so weird? Why did I have to be such a creep and hang out in his room? I just wanted things to go back to the way they were before , well maybe not that but… He shook his head trying to clear away his thoughts. He needed sleep and a plan to try and tell Cas. He had missed his chance before and he wasn't going to lose it again. But first he needed sleep and he had a feeling that he might actually manage a few hours nightmare free tonight.
Everything was too much and his mind couldn't catch up to the sensations.
"Do you know what you want? I know you don't normally like food but you could still try some of mine, see if there's anything less how’d you put it "moleculey?".
Smiling, Dean used his hand to gesture a meek Castiel into the kitchen. "Sleep well?"
"I can choose? What happened to driver picks the music shotgun shuts his," Cas lifted his hands creating air quotes "piehole."
"Aha" Dean announced, lifting the tape triumphantly into the air." Cas, may I present to you the perfect road trip playlist? Made it myself." Dean pushed the tape into the cassette player.
Nodding, Sam redirected his attention back to his eggs. “Well thanks for the food and good luck.”
“I’ll get you coffee.” He whispered against Cas’ hair as if it were a secret.
Dean knows that Sam is there and that he brought that damn nephilim with him, but he also doesn't seem able to respond to move his mouth and push out words, not sure if he remembers how.
"Oh real mature Cas. Do you know what else is mature?" Lifting his hand up into the air, he raised his middle finger, before letting it drop, slamming down next to Sam’s elbows.
"How long have I been gone?"
Dean stretched leaning on his elbows so he could look up at the stars. He had never had many chances to see the stars when he was young, always on the move with a brother he had to watch at all times.
"While actually I am relatively young for an angel." Cas shrugged off the thought, redirecting his gaze back to Dean. "Gabriel said that these were the coolest things God has ever made. Though he also said that was because when the humans found them it was hilarious to watch how they struggled to put them back together. He also really liked Jurassic park."
He'd spent his whole life avoiding feelings and relying on other people, taught by his father to trust no one. But over time he'd learned to break his father's rules, that sometimes other people and feelings could be as important as survival, because if he didn't have Cas, well he already knew that wasn't a world of living.
Withdrawing his arm from Cas, Dean used it to wave nonchalantly through the air. "Necessary, pshhh I know. I want to, come on. Are you going to tell me this really doesn't beat being stuck in that stuffy bunker reaching the same set of archaic books over and over?"
"I've decided," Dean announced back to Cas, shrugging one arm through his jacket using the other to grab his keys and wallet from the counter, "that if I'm some perfect human role model then I should actually do my job."
"No, but. He knows why you did it. He understands. What he wants you to apologise for is hurting his feelings. Tell him you're sorry and don't give an explanation."
anymore?"
"But you and Sam drive for hours and don't get car sickness." Cas said confused, but he turned to look out the front window anyway.
Cas smiles small, but overwhelmingly real and trusting.
"I should - I
Once he was sure the door was shut and the Winchester's were asleep, Cas shuffled to the edge of his bed, reaching down to pull out a box. It was made of a dark stained Oak covered in ruins of protection spells and wards, something he had picked up on a hunt years ago. He flipped open the lid, staring at the contents within.
“Not bad for a first try.” Cas looks over to Dean who has a small smile on his face. He turns back to the stumps, all the cups are still standing tall, but the post on the left has a bullet embedded in the wood. "You'll be all humaned up in no time."
Thumping on the door as fast as his heart beat, fist as tightly curled as his stomach and as heavy as his heart.
Beginning to feel stir crazy Dean slowly began to venture from the room he still thought of as cas's. It started simple with walks that quickly turned into sprints accompanied by blaring metallic and AC/DC, to driving baby for hours aimlessly till he found somewhere that sold beer and pie. Slowly growing braver Dean began not only leaving the bunker but what he found far scarier exploring within the bunker. Instead of running out of the kitchen as fast as possible once he'd raided whatever he could from the fridge that didn't need to be cooked, he instead cooked himself bacon and if all he cooked himself was a breakfast of bacon who could blame him, progress was still progress.
"Dean," Sam says quietly as if speaking to a particularly startled deer.
He drew his gaze downward to where his fingers clenched and unclenched from their resting places on his raised knees. “I don't understand how you can begin to understand what you need, what is happening around you and how you feel. There’s so much happening, so much to process. I don’t get how you do it. Does it not scare you, the uncertainty of the future of your needs?”
“Dean”
“Right,” Dean dropped their hands, stepping back and whipping his palms along his sweats, “the bacon.” Turning towards the stove, Dean turned off the burner, pulling the pan off to the side.
Cas took small uncertain steps into the room. "I cannot seem to sleep. It doesn't come over me like it has so often been described to me."
"Wait."
Clenching his teeth, Dean exhaled raspily through them creating an odd distorted sigh. "I know. I just don't like watching him in pain."
"Okay." Dean said, smile spreading on his lips as he turned over Baby's engine and listened to her beautiful humm.
Dean sat on the edge of Baby’s hood letting one leg dangle over the edge. He rubbed the hood of the car beside him. “Sit.”
Pushing the door open further, Cas stepped forward, crossing his arms over his chest. "Why can't I come with you?"
Cas voices rung off the tile a mixture of reprimanding and bright joy.
"Okay," Dean spread his arms encompassing the landscape before them. "this is a carnival." They'd driven a couple of hours and two states over to a pier. There was a massive thick colourfully painted boardwalk lined with stalls of games and food, the end filled with several different rides, some hidden under brightly painted circus tents, others tracks of steel and iron that gleamed in the sunlight.
"I should. I'm just scared I'm not used to talking, expressing even acknowledging my feelings, but you're right I know what it's like to live with the regret of never telling him, of never taking that opportunity and it's a feeling I would like to never have to face again." Dean dragged his eyes away from the hideous motel carpet to meet his brother's eyes. "So, if I were to try and say take your advice and tell him about my feelings how should I go about that?"
love?” Cas used his elbows to push himself upwards, torso twisting so that he could glare at Dean.
Voice quiet and uncharacteristically meek, Dean pleaded. "Will you just stay here?"
"The empty road gets boring, besides if I take Sam with he's only going to want to talk research and if I spend any more time thinking about our problems my head will literally explode."
Cas never spent much time with them in the bunker, but Dean still insisted that he should have his own room, that he should decorate it, fill it with his possessions even if he didn't own anything other than what he carried with him. Dean wanted to make sure that Cas knew that he could stay whenever he wanted, for however long. He even practically begged him to stay a couple of times, though if he was asked he would probably say that he simply gave Cas the option if he had wanted. Though it was rare, Dean always enjoyed when Cas stayed with them in the bunker. He enjoyed the angel's company and it was nice to know that if he wanted, Cas was only a couple doors down the hall from him.
“No,” Cas said slowly, voice drifting down to his hands that rested heavy and limp in his lap, “but I suppose I could -
Sleep confused Castiel because even though he understood the science behind it, understood humans need for sleep to replenish their energy, and help store memories. Cas always thought that sleep was an odd way to evolve to fill this need, as it left its participants vulnerable and defenseless.
"Yeah. and?"
Another part of Dean was terrified of Cas learning how much he did mean to him. The poor guy had just become human for chuck’s sake. He already struggled with emotions, he didn’t need Dean’s stacked on top of his. And as greedy and ridiculous as it was Dean wanted Cas to stay, to open up to him, to be his friend. He didn’t think he'd be able to handle it if he lost Cas like he’d lost so many of his other friends.
Dean rolled his eyes, elbowing his brother lightly in the side causing him to start coughing on his tea.
It takes longer than it should, especially with Dean driving, to arrive at the bunker. Dean struggled to drive at all especially after Cas chose to sit in the seat beside him. He kept finding his eyes drifting from the windshield to Cas, it didn't help that every time he looked over Cas was staring at him too.
He was confused as to how exactly Cas was brought back and he was scared that he might not get to stay. That he might not be real. That he could lose him again and now he knew for certain that he couldn't live without him.
He’d come close when he was a sapling angel that lacked the proper training to become a warrior of heaven, but his instinct had always saved him. His wings would sprout from his back and he would swoop, grinding upwards as high as he could go.
“Do you know what I would
Dean wanted Cas to know that he mattered more than he ever would, more than he would ever let himself believe, but he was unsure how to convince him that he didn’t care about how good he was at healing or vaporising demons; all he cared about was how long Cas was going to stay this time.
Sam tapped his shoulder. "Are you sure your okay to drive? If you're tired we can switch places."
Shaking his head as if to realign his thoughts, Dean turned back to his pancakes. “I just,” he shrugged his shoulder hoping to appear casual, “thought that if we found a food he actually did like it might be easier to get him to eat.”
"But now," lifting his other hand, Cas rests it on Dean's left cheek, smearing tears into his skin and framing his face, "because of what you taught me, I know that was wrong, selfish, manipulative. People don’t owe you anything, they have nothing to prove, no greater reason, no one they need to earn the favour of to live for they are already living. And you don’t owe anyone anything either. You deserve love even if you don’t think you do. Especially as you struggle, as you lash out, as you feel broken and destructive, because how else would you learn how to improve without love and support?”
Cas smiles a small sad smile at the ground, before taking a steadying breath and forcing his gaze back up to Dean. "You're the one that taught me that. I used to believe that the words someone had written from my father were absolute, that my brothers and sisters were the only thing that mattered. That people only had value if they lived up to what we the beings with ultimate, access to knowledge they would never know, that had never faced the issues they live daily, determined had value."
Cas eyed the tall metal wheel dubiously.
Cas turned to look back at the sky streaked with his falling brethren. "Isn't it obvious? They're becoming human."
"I know," Dean stared at his shoes as he dragged them across the unique diamond design on the carpet, "Maybe that's another thing I'm scared of."
Dean smiled, bright amongst the darkness. “Sometimes being human fucking sucks and you’ve got to take a step back and find a way to calm down before it takes over and I’ve found the best way to do that is the stars."
“What are you going somewhere?”
Cas gently placed his hand on his shoulder startling Dean. “Dean are you alright?”
Dean knew his brother was right. They should burn Cas' body. He would have liked that Dean thought going out as a hunter, as a Winchester. Reluctantly and unbelievably slowly Dean drew his arms away from Cas. Sam reached forward prepared to help lift his body, but when Sam got within a couple inches of him, Dean growled and wrapped his arm back around him.
Finally, Dean got to pull baby into her prime parking spot, before pulling out the keys and tucking them into his green jacket.
“I… um,” he rubbed the back of his neck hoping that Cas couldn’t see his blush in the dark. “wanted to talk to you.”
"So," Dean drawled, "I'm planning to go on a beer run, maybe get some food. Do you want to come?"
Reaching blindly forward struggling to see through the tears he couldn't seem to stop, Dean wrapped his arms around Cas pulling him closer. Cas yelped in surprise, but when Dean buried his head on his shoulder failing to smother his sobs, Cas lifted his arms pulling him closer content with the warmth it provided. Dean wasn't sure how long he stood in that hallway, he couldn't let go of Cas. He couldn't return to the cold emptiness of his room. He wanted, needed to have Cas hold him. He only began to reluctantly pull away when he had to blink himself awake more than once, feeling guilty for leaning all his weight on Cas, for good damn crying on him. He was glad Sam wasn't there he was sure he would never live down the moment of vulnerability. But when Dean finally lifted his head from Cas shoulder he was surprised to see how red and puffy Cas eyes were. Dean attempted to step back but Cas' grip didn't loosen until Dean mumbled a sleepy confused "Cas?" Startled Cas withdrew his arms unnaturally fast causing Dean to lean forward struggling to regain his balance.
“Say it
"Sorry. It's just I've been worrying about this for years and I can't believe that it was it."
A series of loud footsteps startled Dean causing him to draw Cas inward wrapping his other arm around his side determined even now to defend him. But instead of a monster it's his brother kneeling down beside him a young golden haired boy is following and despite the appearance of his age Dean knows that it's the nephilim, that he's Lucifer's son.
He sighed, opening his mouth before closing it and shaking his head, unsure of what to say. There were so many thoughts rushing through his head, images of the past, the good and the bad between him and Cas. Sam’s words before he left. He wasn’t sure what to say.
"Dean." Blinking, Dean's vision began to refocus. "Are you okay? Your breathing has raised exponentially in the last few seconds."
"Nothing I just ugh…. you've been having a tough go", Sam squeezed Dean's shoulder, "so it's good to see you smile."
"Can I kiss you?" Dean whispered scared of breaking the fragile wall they kept for so many years.
"I'm glad you're back. It was tough without you but you're here now so that's all that matters. Right?"
Pointing forward, Dean waved towards the middle of the field. "See the red cup in the middle of that post there." Cas nodded, "that's where you're aiming."
So, Dean recounted the story surprised he'd never told Sam. Dean remembers that night fondly, it's when he began to see Cas not simply as a solider, but as a person with feelings. A friend. Dean laughs as he hears Sam's horrible impression of what Cas sounded like in one of his own personal tales, it's weird to hear a story of just Sam and Cas one he wasn't around for.
He's shaking using his free hand to balance himself on the counter. He's losing his mind or perhaps he already lost it with everything else that mattered.
Dean flopped backwards on the bed. “We're just a couple of dumbasses, aren’t we?”
"It's not a
He commanded desperately for his wings to extend behind him, but he could feel them crumbling around him, could see the feathers scorched and decayed falling to ash in the air.
"Come on Sammy. I'm not looking for you to write a speech, just any idea you have would be greatly appreciated."
Cas groaned, grabbing his head. He gasped, throat rough. It was hard to think with the pounding in his head and the burning pain in his back.
him about his life."
Pulling back the corner of the covers, Dean gently laid Cas’ down onto his own bed. His eyebrows scrunched together tightly and he groaned rolling onto his side, arm falling off the side of the bed extending as if to reach for Dean’s warmth.
“I know." Cas whispered quietly, head tilted towards Dean.
"So..." Dean drummed his fingers on the table. God this was so awkward. What did he usually say? What did they usually talk about? Well all they normally talked about was hunting, but he didn't want to talk about anything depressing or work related. Would it be weird to ask Cas questions? He's known him for years and yet he still knows very little of his life before they meet. It was weird sometimes when he remembered how old Cas really was. He supposed it was just another one of those things he was going to have to learn to adjust to because of Cas.
"What?" Dean placed one hand over his ear and used the other to point his middle finger at his brother. "Can't hear you".
* * *
"Yeah, well you died and came back I suppose that earns you free pick," Dean narrowed his eyes pointing the remote threateningly at Cas "don't get me wrong, it's only for tonight." Cas nodded, grabbing the remote, brushing Dean's fingers.
He saw Sam in the hallway and he thankfully didn't say anything about finding him walking out of Cas's room, instead nodding to him and telling him that he made eggs that were still in the kitchen if he wanted some.
"So what do you do?"
"You do know what happiness is right Cas? It's impossible to tell with the doom and gloom all over your face all the time."
"I..." Dean rubbed the back of his neck faltering "I may have slept here a couple nights after... well you know."
Cas tries to pull his arm back, but Dean is determined, tightening his grip around Cas' forearm, trench coat wrinkling around his fingers. “Why would?” Cas’ eyebrows furrow, as he struggles to make words form around his downturned lips. “What?”
Worries about Cas. He wanted Cas to be happy, he wanted him to know that he mattered that there was more to him than the supernatural abilities he was born with. That when Dean thought of Castiel, his first image wasn’t a wave of a hand, the brandishing of a sword, the rushing wave of ice he felt whenever Cas used his angelic abilities.
Dean dragged his hand across his face, breathing deeply. "You're right. Fuck, you're right. I'm gonna have to face my feelings eventually. God why did it have to be Cas?" That question seemed to be plaguing him for years, following him everywhere he went. Why did he have to fall for Cas? Oblivious, awkward, dorky, literal angel of the lord, his best friend Castiel and he was stuck staring at him awe struck.
Dean sat on the small couch huddled in the corner of the Dean cave.
"Cas not here?" Sam asked, surveying the kitchen.
I know that you might not think so, but I do. I,” he takes a deep shaky breath,
Dean laughed loudly banging his hand against the steering wheel, smile bright and wide. "You don't know the half of it."
Sam pushed away from the impala, leaning forward, his eyes were wide with some mixture of apprehension and concern. "So you're human now?"
Sighing, Dean ran his hands through the short hairs that had started to fall across his forehead. "Yeah and I'm thinking of taking Cas somewhere. Something to show him that even though lives a shit show of never ending pain, doesn't mean we have to acknowledge it all the time. "
Sam nodded, turning the laptop back towards himself. "It's only a couple hours drive from here. I figure we should check it out. It shouldn't take more than a couple days tops."
"YOU LEFT ME!!!!" Dean threw the now empty beer bottle at the wall that had been mocking him for days. It shattered sending glass raining to the floor.
"So," Dean fumbled with the keys nearly dropping them, he was supposed to be starting the car not awkwardly staring at his best friend. God this was gonna be harder than he thought, "Is there anything you want to listen to."
"Cas," Dean picked the box up with one hand, careful not to disturb the contents, "Can you return this to it's home?"
Tilting his head to the side, Cas asked. "How am I supposed to dance while encapsulated in a moving vehicle?"
He nearly screamed when he felt an arm tighten around his back, yanking his eyes open. It's Cas' arm.
"Huh?"
"Cas!!" Dean awoke legs tangling in the covers, as he struggled to pull his body upwards. He blinked hoping to clear the neverending blue from his mind. He clutched the fabric over his heart struggling to gasp in air. It took his brain several seconds to adjust to where he was. He was in his bed in the bunker.
“Aren't you scared you're going to wake up Sam?”
“Okay.” Cas placed his hand gently over Dean’s. “What did you wish to talk to me about?”
"I just don't know how to tell him. I want to but every time I open my mouth to try, nothing happens."
"Okay to what?"
Clearing his thoughts, Dean slumped forward. "I realized that I don't want to live in a world that you're not in, because you're my best friend, Cas."
The ride jerked forward and Dean leaned forward to grab the handle, suddenly reminded that they were going upward. Dean tightened his grip, squeezed his eyes shut and breathed deeply in and out. This wasn't the same as a plane, it was not going to go very high. He was going to be fine. But with that thought, Dean slowly opened his eyes to see Cas facing him, concern evident in the furrow of his brows and the downturn of his lips.
Cas placed his hand over Dean's, struggling to stop the sides of his lips from rising. “No, don't give them chips with the amount of sodium and fat on them, and their pointy edges and difficult to swallow size you are going to make them choke.”
Sam chuckled shaking his head softly in hope that those two would fucking figure things out.
And he needed Cas. In a way he thought he had always needed him.
Dean looked at Cas skeptically. He was not a role model. He definitely shouldn’t be one for someone as beautiful and influenceable as Cas. “You
Gently as if he was scared that if he touched it would crumble and break, like everything important to him seemed to, he laid his hand on the cool sheet. His heart was beating so loud his ears were ringing. He felt like he didn't belong here. This wasn't his room. This was Cas's and he should be the one here not him. But even when he tells himself that he shouldn't be here, he can't make himself leave. Instead he climbs his way up the bed, Cas' bed and lays on Cas' pillow and if he tries hard enough he can still smell Cas. Tears fall from his eyes onto the pillow and even though he tries to get them to stop, scared that he's contaminating Cas's pillow and it'll stop smelling like him, he can't.
When sleep managed to come for him, it was never bright and happy. Cas wasn’t sure whether it was from a lack of practice and proper understanding of sleep time rituals and etiquette or if it was that the memories his subconscious had to choose from were neither bright, nor happy.
Praying to Castiel was something he'd done far more times in his life than he was ever likely to admit and something he seemed to be doing even more lately. He missed Cas. He prayed to him the first night after and every night and often several times a day since. He prayed simply to talk even if Cas couldn't hear him it was nice in a way to be able to do something so familiar to him. He prayed while crying and hitting his hands on the surface of whatever was closest begging him to return home, to Sam, to Jack and most often selfishly for himself. He prayed angry at the world, Lucifer, his horrible luck and himself.
Cas lowered his arms stepping away from Dean. Dean shivered already missing the warmth. Unsure what he should do with his arms, Dean lifted them, wrapping them around himself before giving up and dropping them altogether. coughing, he takes a couple steps back. “Yeah,” he rubbed the back of his neck, “we should head back to the motel and we can start driving back to the bunker first thing in the morning.”
Cas padded his way down the hall, stepping slow and careful, scared of disturbing the rare silence of the bunker.
Dean sighed, slow and longing. “Talk mostly.” He turned to face Cas letting his shoulders ease. “Sometimes it's nice just to get to talk.”
Croaked Cas.
” Dean sat up, turning to look at Cas below. “No, you're not taking up too much of my time. I’m happy to help. Besides if I'm not going to teach you how to be human, who is? Remember when you got scared by stomach rumbling. If I wasn’t there to help you, you could end up dead.”
"Then why are we here?" Cas extended his arm gesturing towards the empty field Dean had driven them to.
"Well who wouldn't? It's a classic."
Sam nodded towards Cas and Jack, “You and Cas.”
Cas peeled the edges of the label on his beer bottle. “Thank you for showing me. For taking me here. For helping me. This can’t be easy for you either and I’m sorry if I’m taking up too much of your time.”
He was in overwhelming pain and yet somehow he felt like he was floating through a void of neverending nothingness.
Cas turned to Dean watching the way he leaned back elbows in the golden sand, eyes close and extended to the stars, the worry lines that creased in folds across his forehead and down between his brows washed away like the particles of sand when the waves rolled in leaving only smooth shells and butter skin. He turned back to the sea staring at the never ending horizon at where dark hurricane blue met charcoal grey.
"Got used it I guess," Dean shrugged, "driving your whole life acclimitasizes you."
Dean pushed away the stack of large books to drop his face into his hands, groaning. “What's the point of this? I haven’t learned anything."
Staring at his hands, Cas struggled to explain, to find words to verbalise the pictures that flooded through his head; Dean covered in blood blade gripped tightly in his hand, harsh breaths as he swung at the never ending stream of monsters, the face of betrayal and surprise as Dean stared at him when he pushed him through the portal and the images that never were, merely created by his past experiences and his brains imaginitiviy.
Dean nodded, eyes heavy, “come here.”
, but when I’m asleep I'm not aware enough to tell myself that and even when I do wake the fear seems to linger.”
Cas shoulders slump and his arm slackens dropping to his side, even as Dean's hand stays wrapped around it. “I
“I do.”
. “What are you going to do then?"
“I know Dean," Cas tilts his head to the side, tone slow and earnest, "this is a lot for you and it’ll take time, but I’m here and I’m not going anywhere. I love you Dean and I’m going to keep saying that as long as it takes for
“So,” Dean started, clearing his throat, “is there something you know that’s stopping you from sleeping?”
Of course. Why don't you come in?”
Cas continued to glare at him even as he leaned back in his seat, arms crossed.
Dean stared at Cas, eyes wide, before letting himself lean on the other man drawing his own arms around his waist. “I...I…” Dean closed, breathing deeply.  “You were… and she was… and you almost and…” Dean choked off,  burrowing his head into Cas neck.
It hurt and Cas knew that was stupid. The images were not real and he was fine, but his body still shook tremors carrying in cold waves down his spine and out into his fingers that wobbled restlessly through the air.
As much as Dean doesn’t want to admit it, he wants trust, and soft gentle affections. The moments he has never allowed himself to have, all blunt words and harsh punch lines. He wants to be held, he wants those soft fond reassurances, the gentle affections. Even as he knows he doesn’t deserve them.
"No, look at me. Okay?"
Whipping his hand out from under Dean's, Cas waved it through the air violently as if he was trying to swat a fly. "Well what
Careful not to hurt any of the tapes, Cas placed the box back into the glove compartment. "It was one of the only ones I recognised."
"And Cas was there with you?"
"Hello." A deep raspy voice called from the entryway.
Cas stared at Dean for several seconds. "Okay. I'll accompany you."
"I'll do it" Sam nodded and Dean pretended he couldn't see the concern in his brother's eyes. He couldn't let Cas go. He knew he could trust Sam that he wouldn't hurt or be disrespectful to Cas, but he couldn't let him go. He wouldn't not till he had to.
Cas looks back at Dean. “I’m here.”
Cas stared up at him from the top of his book with narrowed eyes. "If you
Silence weighs heavy, pushing on Dean's chest knocking the already wheezy breath from his lungs. His heart is pounding, deafening in his head, but it still isn’t as loud as
“Coffee?” Dean groaned, hands stretching above his face in a desperate attempt to shield himself from the light.
Dean turned away, busying himself with pouring a well deserved refill of coffee. "That night, when he…"  His stilled hands hovered in the air, before dropping heavily onto the counter. "He said he thinks he's useless without his powers and…"
"No but really, I can wake you up if the nightmares come back. Sam used to do that after I um… came back from hell knowing someone's near, well it..." Dean rubbed the back off his neck, awkward chuckle dropping from his lips. "It helped and I get that this whole." Dean waved his hands outward as if trying to expel the negative words out from the air.
"He does have a very specific type of humour, hard to crack"
"Don't. If you want to stay here and mister Miyagi this kid knock yourself out", Dean breathed deeply, attempting to lower his rapidly rising voice, "I didn't sign up for that, so I'm going to go to work.”
Sam rolled his eyes "Anyways have you thought about what we talked about?"
He was
" Dean waved his finger in front of Cas' face in a tsking motion the way a mother might show disappointment at a son for breaking her favourite vase. "You are not a bother. I want you to come talk to me if you're struggling or if you have any questions. As an expert in avoiding my problems until they tackle me and crush me to the floor, I would like to advocate against that, cause trust me when they do catch up it's gonna hurt like a bitch. So what you should work on and probably me too, is trying to fix them before they get big enough to squash you."
Dropping his blade, Dean grabbed the front of his shirt struggling to breath. He looked down at Cas where he was still crouched on the floor. If he was a couple seconds later, Cas could be. Dean’s vision blurred and he struggled not to topple over. Cas could have been. He blinked trying to clear the images frantically appearing in his head. The red that bloomed across Cas’ chest, the crumbling of his limbs as his body fell to the ground, the etching in the earth of his beautiful wings that Dean had always secretly wondered what they looked and now hoped he had never known. And blue. Not the comforting blue of Cas’ eyes that reminded him of warmth and summer, but the unnaturally blue of Cas’ grace as it burned through his eyes and mouth. The blue that glowed luminescent and bright in a way no human thing ever could. The blue that stayed behind Dean’s eyelids as he closed his eyes.
"I know." Dean lifted his head from his hands and dragged his fingers down his face. "It's just that I feel so useless. I want to be out there doing something, anything to help him."
"You could use me.
Cas mutters vague threats that muffle through the cotton and feathers.
Cas. Cas. Cas. He isn't sure how he can be talking to him, how he's alive. And for probably the first time ever he doesn't care about the price. Whatever it is he can handle it if Cas is by his side again.
"Yes, Sam, surprisingly I remember."
Shaking his head, Dean laughed. "Nevermind."
Yawning, Cas stares at Dean a small melodic sadness in the turn of his lips and the droop of his brows.
"And stop thanking me, there's no need. You've looked out for me and Sam for a long time. Maybe," Dean leaned over bopping Cas' on the nose. Cas' stares at his nose, lips scrunched in annoyance as he brings his sleeve up to wipe at the offending surface, "it's finally my time to look after
Cas stared at Dean for several seconds, before mustering the courage to lay down beside him.
Cas had very little knowledge about food and its wonderful majesties. As an angel Cas had tried very few foods as he often considered them “too moleculey?” Dean wasn’t sure what exactly that meant, but hey even if he looked like one he wasn’t the angel here.
Dean hummed in agreement.
"Was he a good person?"
Perched on the edge of the bed, Dean rested a gentle hand on Cas' thigh. “Do you want to talk about it?”
"Yeah but you don't have your powers. What if you get
“Can’t tell you yet, it’s a surprise.”
Reaching forward desperately, Cas locks his fingers, iron grip, around Dean's wrist, holding it between them in the air. “Dean
"What?" Dean blinked eyes refocusing on Cas' concerned face "No I'm fine just thinking about how it's nice to have you back."
“Come on.” Dean goaded.
Dean stared at Cas, wide eyes frozen trying not to jerk back every time he feels the carriage sway with a soft metallic creek. Dean breathed deeply, trying to focus on Cas' and not on the dangerous abyss to the side, on the shouts of joy fulled terror that drifted up through the air and not the rusty grind of metal
“Sam wants me to talk about what happened about you and how ..., you know. It's been days and I still can't bring myself to say it it's stupid really I'm gonna have to say it eventually. I need to stop obsessing to move forward. I can't afford to let my guard down, to get distracted. So here I go, Cas is dead for real this time.”
Cas stared at him apprehensively.
Dean lowered both his hands to the wheel, making sure to place them at ten and two. "Fine, I’ll be more careful."
Dropping his head into his hands, Dean clenched his teeth tightly trying to remember all the reasons he loved his brother and why punching him would be a bad idea. "No, stop whatever thought you have in your head." Dean waved his hands. "Nothing like that okay. He was having nightmares and I felt bad with the whole you know," Dean shrugged his shoulders hoping to appear casual even as he whispered the next words awkwardly through the side of his mouth "turned
"Thank you that's uh... very nice of you. You didn't have to."
Cas shook his head, dark hair swaying along his forehead and out into the air lifted by the wind. Forcing his gaze down to the sand, he muttered. “Nothing.”
Carefully he pulled out the box not wanting to harm anything Cas's found important. Inside he found the mixtape he'd given him, Dean's old AC/DC shirt he'd given him after he fell, a bee keychain that Sam bought him (Dean thought the idea of having a keychain without a key was ridiculous but Cas had of course loved the gift) and a collection of photos, several Dean weren't even aware existed. In one Cas, Sam and Dean were laughing in front of the impala. There was one Cas had clearly amaturely taken of Sam that was fuzzy on the edges. Another two he must have secretly taken of Dean, one was of his profile while he was driving and another of him standing in the kitchen laughing, he wasn't even aware that Cas owned a camera. At the very bottom of the box was another photo this one was framed. It was a photo that Sam insisted they took claiming that there wasn't enough of them, Dean was annoyed at the time though extremely grateful now, because even if he didn't put it on display Cas had a framed photo of Dean with his arm wrapped around Cas, Dean was laughing at whatever Cas had said he couldn't remember now and Cas normally tentative and shy was smiling, a rare and beautiful sight.
Dean smashes his clenched fist over and over into his thigh trying to stop the tears, rocking himself back and forth. Cas is dead and he isn't coming back and there's nothing I can do to change that I'm going to have to learn to live with that, or at least pretend for Sam until I can. Dean whipped the few stray tears from his cheeks and climbed his way up the bed and under the covers. It would be several hours and not until the sun was starting to rise until Dean's eyes drifted close from exhaustion.
Dean laughed. "Man you gotta learn to capitalise on your revival. Try and get as much out of it as you can. I'm not likely to offer again." Although Dean wasn't sure that was true, all his previous rules and thoughts had changed so much because of Cas. He didn't think he'd ever truly be able to say no to anything he asked for, even if was as dumb choosing what music played.
“Dean?” Cas spook his voice quiet and concerned. Dean startled looking down staring in confusion, before releasing that Cas must have stood up. Drawing his eyes upward he saw Cas staring at him. Alive, Dean reminded himself. He’s alive. The images in his head were nothing but pictures. But Dean knew that wasn’t true, they weren’t pictures or baseless fears they were memories, because that was real and it had happened. Dean was certain. He’d never be able to forget the weight of Cas’ body in his arms of the dreary lifelessness in the days that followed.
Normally when Dean found his eyes drifting towards Cas he would force himself to look away, but this time Dean let his eyes wander. Cas’ hair was somehow messier than normal and there was a small and almost indistinguishable smile on his face, but for Cas a smile was something and Dean was amazed that he was the one who had made it appear.  He didn’t think he should be trusted to have power over something as beautiful and complex as Cas’ feelings, but if he had the ability to make Cas happier well he was damn well going to try. Especially if it meant that he could see more of his smiles.
"No I'm fine, it's nothing, don't worry about it."
Dean leaned over the counter and sighed staring at Cas as he talked to Jack. He was so happy, Dean could see how much Jack's view of him mattered.
"Don't worry about me."
"People often get sick in cars if they look out the side windows, something to do with the speed of the view not matching your eyes or ears or something, Sam explained it to me once. Wasn't really paying much attention." Dean shrugged his shoulders, dismissively shaking off his jumbled thoughts. "It's better if you look out through the front window or close your eyes."
"Yeah well just because you and Cas were friends or whatever doesn't mean you know a damn thing about what I'm feeling or what's best for me. Okay? So quit asking."
"Maybe that's why it scares me Sam," Dean dragged his eyes up to meet his brothers, "maybe it's because I seem to hurt everyone around me that matters and maybe I'm scared that I'll hurt Cas too. So what if he feels the same way about me? We both know he could do better."
* * *
Dean froze, grip slack on the handle, hazelnut hair sticking to one side, grass green eyes shifting and unfocused.
Dean pointed down at Cas’ “And before you tell me you’re not a person, you knew what I meant.”
Sam breaths deeply as if holding himself back. "Okay. Maybe you don't want to but I think it would be good for you to talk about what's happening, about how you're feeling. Cas was my friend too."
Breathing was odd, he thought. He was always told that humans did it subconsciously and well he supposed that was true, when something went wrong he could feel each desperate needy inhale as if it was grating his throat with sandpaper.
Staring down at the gun before him, Cas’ eyebrows furrowed and he tilted his head to the side. "Why are there no bullets, If you're teaching him how to fire a gun? I don't see how you expect me to learn how to fire a gun without bullets."
"I’ll come." Dean smiled. It wasn't really the romantic setting he was hoping for, but he was glad that he would get to spend a few days alone with Cas and several vampires, but they didn't really matter anyway.
Dean laughed pounding at his own chest to stop from spluttering his mouth full of beer. “It’s not. I told you Cas, I’m no role model.”
“Well I’m here aren’t I?”
No one said anything as they stared at the flames until they began to die down, no one said anything when they entered baby and Dean slammed off the rock music blaring through the speakers. No one said anything when Dean didn't head to the fridge to pull out a beer but instead opened one of the higher cupboards and pulled out a bottle of cheap scotch uncapping it and drinking straight from the bottle.
Cas shuffled forward awkwardly. "It was adequate. The process is odd and I'm still not quite used to it."
Sam rolled his eyes. “I’m glad, you seem happier, both of you.”
"Neither do I."
"Thank you."
He walked back to Castiel who was standing where he left him holding the rifle awkwardly in his hands.
Dean let's himself melt, head tilting into Cas' sturdy palm.
Dean grabbed the gun, careful not to damage it's beautiful craftsmanship as he slowly placed the bullets into the mechanism. "Now watch carefully. The bullets get fed in here and then," Dean pushed in the chamber with a flourish and spin. "Viola, you have a menacing weapon to beat your enemies." He finished in an overly dramatic voice.
* * *
Cas tried to lift the rifle but struggled under its surprisingly heavy weight. It swung sideways mere inches from Dean's side. "
"Okay." Cas relied quietly, voice bouncing off the walls in an odd distorted echo making it sound as if he was far away.
Dean laughed, banging his hand on the table. "Okay so we know not to give you bananas  in the future. See we're learning, making progress, all that fun jazz."
"Well if that's it I'm going - ", stepping backwards Dean's foot caught causing him to stumble arms swinging barely keeping himself from falling, "to leave and try to get some sleep."
Looking up, Dean elbowed Sam. "No one else is in this house. Who did you think it was, Beyonce?"
* * *
"Yeah, I've known him god, it would be almost nine years. I can't believe it's been that long." Although Dean also couldn't believe he lived so many years before knowing him.
If you're scared all the time, it must be difficult for you to do things. But
…” Dean stared at Cas trying to think of some way to protect him without simultaneously throwing the crushing boulder on him himself. They had made so much progress over the last couple weeks he didn’t want to lose that for something he hadn’t even meant to say. But he couldn’t let Cas come, he couldn’t risk it. He was desperate for Cas to understand, “I don't want you to get hurt."
Freezing cup resting against his lips, Dean stared. He cleared throat loudly. "Hey, Cas."
Cas stumbled down the stairs grip tight on the railing. He struggled to process the movement, the laughter, the light blurs of the people passing around him through the dizziness and nausea.
"But-"
Turning towards Dean, Cas titled his head, furrow in his brow. "I thought you didn't like when people were around when you were asleep."
what I was saying."
“Come
you, Dean.”
“Yeah.” Dean rubbed at the back of his neck feeling heat take over his face.
you do what you need to anyway.
He knew why he had these nightmares. The images that kept returning, he recognised the origins of their twisted images, purgatory, falling. He dreamt of the world of monsters and the human stuck amongst them. He dreamt about the possibilities of what could have been, if Dean was injured, forgotten, dead. He re-lived his fall, the fall of his brothers and sisters, his family, his kind. Even though he knew it was not real, his eyes closed and his mind trapped, he swears the burning on his back and the wind whipping at his skin felt as real as they had that night.
Watching the calm waves of obsidian roll in and out, Cas’ realized that maybe he didn’t have to worry, he may not lead a life of peace, he may never know the feel of white chipped paint from picket fences as they ran along his palm, may never know what it felt like to leave and know when he would return, or what it would feel like to have someone safe and waiting for when he did, but he had forged his own kind of home amongst the Winchester’s. They had always taken him back no matter how big his betrayal, how much sand his feet had stomped and waves he sent spinning. They were always there with waiting arms for when he wandered back. Even when his hands were coated with ash from the burned reminiscence of his wings, when blue grace no longer burrowed through his borrowed veins, when he no longer served his purpose as warrior of heaven. They took him in with relieved smiles and fond words, even when he could only be Cas and nothing more.
"I'm gonna get a beer you want anything?" Cas shakes his head but trails silent after Dean into the kitchen.
Turning on his heels, Sam retreated as fast as he could hoping that maybe, just maybe for once they could sort things out like adults.
the credit.”
He handed one to Cas letting his fingers brush against Cas a second too long.
"Okay." Cas replied hesitantly. Attempting to shyly copy what Dean had told him.
Dean turned away from his brother rummaging through the grocery bags. "My best friend came back from the dead. What am I supposed to do, ignore him?"
He was
No, when Dean thought of Castiel, he thought of his rare smiles, and his even rarer laughs. He thought about Cas’ pouty grumpy face and his sassy remarks. He thought about the way Cas tilted his head as he struggled to follow Dean's ridiculous ramblings, but he always listened to them anyway.
Thankfully when he wandered into the bunker’s kitchen, Sam was already awake leaning against the counter sipping from a mug meaning Sam had already made coffee and all he had to do was pour it into two mugs.
, when he lashed out without thinking, when he kept everything so tightly that he exploded hurting those near him. Cas had stayed and despite all these things, Cas could still look him in the eye and say with startling clarity and conviction that he thought Dean was a
" Cas repeated quietly as if giving himself instructions.
Dean hummed, as he pulled open the closet and began hanging up his plaid shirts.
It's been three days since Dean hasn't said anything more than "Beer?" to his brother or to Jack, three days since Dean told Sam that he's in love with Cas, three days since Dean had to see him die, three days since he had to burn his body. Deans' not even sure how he's running he hasn't slept and when he has it's never for long before the nightmares kick in and he wakes up panting and reaching for the gun under his pillow, (which he's starting to think might cause more pain than good when he's already pointed it at Sam twice in his sleep deprived state). He hasn't really eaten anything just enough to get Sam to leave him alone. He's pretty sure he might actually be sweating alcohol, he's prided himself on not getting a hangover yet but that might just be because he's already started drinking before he's even fully awake. A wide range of alcoholic bottles can be found thrown in different rooms of the bunker scotch, vodka and enough beer bottles to litter a beach in Hawaii.
"I missed you." Dean's not sure why he repeated it, but it's all he can think about. Cas is back and suddenly everything is easier again. Tears began to rise in his eyes and for once Dean doesn't try to stop them instead he turns burying his face into Cas' neck. "I missed you." He mumbled against Cas' skin.
Cas tilted his head a silent question echoing, why.
happy."
"Oh come on," Dean used his elbow to poke Cas in the side. "You enjoy spending time with me, everyone does."
take care of myself."
Wrapping his arms around Cas middle, Dean gathers him in his arms swaying his body side to side. "I love you." He whispers soft and quiet and a little disbelieving, before pushing his lips softly against Cas'. He sighs soft and quiet like a cat receiving a head rub, before he rests his head against Cas' arm burrowing deep into his side.
“Thanks.”
Dean sniffled nose twitching, turning to the side he rubbed his hand across his face hoping to hide the wetness curling around the edge of his lash line. Pulling his hand back to his side, Dean squeezes Cas’ shoulder as one last goodbye. “For what? Finally stopped being a dick.”
Normally Dean would avoid anything that presented itself as educational, especially if it involved reading anything longer than a couple of paragraphs. He got enough of that at the bunker. So these kinds of things were normally a hard pass, but for some unknown reason, Sam and Cas enjoyed places like this. Maybe as a little cherub baby somebody had dropped Cas on his head and he'd been too chubby to flap himself away from a face plant. At least head injuries was what he'd assumed happened to Sam, he had actually been dropped on his head as a baby, so who's to say.
Dean nods his head, scruff dragging across Cas' palms. "That’s... that’s good, because I want you to know.”
Cas relaxed his muscles, letting his hands fall into his lap. "Now what? I don't see how this is going to make much of a difference."
"So," Dean prompted, rubbing the hairs on the back of his neck, "what is it you're scared of?"
"First you have to try to relax a little."
Running back to the car Dean pulled out several wooden stakes that had gotten splinters over the years and a couple of paper cups he'd grabbed from a coffee machine at a gas station. He set up several posts at various heights not too far from where Cas was standing. As depressing as it was, it reminded him of home, of the days when his dad was still around and Dean was too young to understand what the shooting practice meant, assuming it was fun rather than necessity. It was the only real father son bonding moment he remembered.
"I told you I'm working on my role model skills. Come on we talked earlier about the meaning of life blah, blah, blah all that boring stuff and I decide the best way to prove to you it's the small moments that make you forget all," Dean gestured vaguely around the kitchen, "this shit that matter, I decide to selflessly take my day off from oh so exciting research to show you myself."
"I've seen you in a fight okay. I know you have your whole banging badass righteous stabbing thing going on, but I also know that angel blades won't get you through everything. They're a short range weapon and you need to learn how to use a long range weapon in order to stop the bad guys from getting too close. You’ve got no more fancy Voodoo healing magic to prevent you from feeling the full fury of your mistakes and trust me it's gonna hurt like a bitch."
"I'm not going to get hurt, Dean.” Cas' voice was deafeningly loud, steeled with defiance. His gaze despite looking up held the clear impression of staring someone down, of proclaiming I have existed far longer than you, I know more than you could ever conceive and I can survive this and it would be best for you if you didn’t underestimate me. “I
"Of course."
Cas simply stared at Dean.
Cas sat stiffly next to Dean, moving as if he was at a job interview rather than in his friend's room.
Dean clenches his eyes shut tight, but the heavy tears still manage to fall, a warm cascade down the planes of his cheeks. “Say it again.”
Dean couldn't help but snort, even when Sam glared at him, water getting in his eyes. He pounded his chest twice, coughing one final time.
“Cas I
He had a little longer.
"Please come back, please. I need you Cas. I can't live without you, I never got a chance to tell you but I will because you'll come back," Dean's body shook as he struggled to force the words out of his throat, "because you've done it before and you can do it again I know you can if not I'll find a way to bring you back just so that I can be the one to stab for being so stupid, nothing is worth sacrificing yourself over. Not even Lucifer you're too important because I love you. I never got the chance to tell you, but I love you castiel."
Cas huffed loudly, pouring his coffee, back to Dean.
Dean stuck his arm through the doorway flipping off his brother.
Dean sighed long and slow. "
Attempting to take another step forward Dean stopped staring frozen eyes wide, hoping for probably the first time that he'd somehow hit his head and was beginning to suffer from a concussion induced hallucination, but he knew he wasn't that lucky. Lucifer was standing behind Cas, a manic gleam in his eyes and an unnaturally large smile making Dean, who has seen every horrible creature you can think of, shiver at the intent he was hiding behind it.
It's been months of searching, of fighting with Cas to find him and suddenly for the first time he doesn't care. He doesn't care who Jack is, or why he's trailing after his brother, alive, not even whether he was going to kill him. He wasn't sure if he cared about anything.
We didn't take the time to learn what he was like as a
Dean shook his head fondly. "Because watching people as they sleep is weird man. Why do you think Twilight got so much hate? Cause nothing tips off the stoker alert faster than watching someone sleep."
“In a way. As an angel I was capable of sensing, feeling, seeing every particle, but that could be overwhelming at times. Up close it's hard to see the beauty in things and they all begin to blur together, but I understand now why there are so many poems about the stars.”
Cas tilted his head, confusion evident on his features. Rolling his eyes Dean drags Cas closer to his side. “There” He whispered, running his fingers through Cas’ hair. Drifting off to sleep, all Dean can think about is that tomorrow he gets to wake up in Cas’ arms.
"Dean", Sam's shoulders shrug and he takes several small steps closer to where Dean's sitting elbows resting on the table. "Do you want to talk about it?"
Dean sighed, a long huff of stale air. Twiddling his thumbs, he turned his face to the side, golden rays casting bronze shadows along his delicate lashes down around the curves of his cheeks. “It does scare me. It scares most people. I think,” Tucking his knees up to his chest, Dean wrapped his arms around them protectively. He shuffled awkwardly half to the side so that he could face Cas a little clearer, “people are scared of everything all the time. Of not knowing what could happen, what others think of them, the possibility of harm to others they care about.” He dropped his arms letting them fall amongst the scattered sand and breathed in a deep calming breath, exhaling slowly like he was revealing a secret stashed away for far too long.
Dean turns glad even if its only for a couple seconds to spend more time with Cas.
Dean stared at Cas and opened his mouth desperate to say anything, everything. There were so many thoughts in his head he felt like he was drowning in them and if only he could open his mouth, he could free them. He was sick of secrets and lying, pretending through the awkward staring and weird interacting for years, but nothing came out. He stared, shaking his head and tried again and only getting as far as "Cas" before his throat closed up.
He's staring again he realises. Dean shakes his head redirecting his gaze to the floor. It's awkward. No one knows what to say, choosing instead to stare at each other in the dark bunker.
Dean pulled a pan out from the bunker's cupboard. If he was unsure what to do, food was the best answer. Cas was new to eating, heck last week he didn’t even know what hunger was. Dean had to explain what his stomach growling meant if it wasn’t for him he probably would have starved to death by now.
"Dean, we're going to have to burn cas' body. And we're going to have to do it fast, Jack sends out a strong signal that could attract who knows what, maybe even Lucifer."
"Dean," Sam chastised.
"Hey," Dean struggled not to turn and look at Cas, he knew if he started looking at him it would be hard to stop and then he wouldn't be watching the road and Cas would yell at him. And well he wanted today to go well and preferably that included as little grumpy Cas as possible, even if he was kinda cute with his little grumpy pout. "Have you picked a tape yet?"
it is." Sam crossed one arm across his chest, leaning forward teasingly.
Dean sagged. "I'm gonna try to get some sleep",  Raising his arm Dean gripped Cas' shoulder, incredibly grateful that it was sold and real. "It's good having you back, Cas. It's been tough without you." Dean hesitated hand on the doorknob before deciding he couldn't handle to see Cas' face choosing instead to enter his room hopeful for some sleep.
Dean leaned over the table knocking several books to the side. "I'm doing a beer run, I could use some company. Do you want to come?"
Cas cried, staring at him affronted.
Cas lowered his arms to his side and softened his gaze. "I'm glad I'm back too."
"You've been spending a lot of time with him lately."
"So what happened?" Cas tilted his head again and no matter how much Dean didn't want to, he couldn't help but think it was adorable.
Dean struggled to breathe rasping and shaking, if it wasn't for his bodies natural instint to survive he would have already forgotten to breath and joined Cas.
Sleep was something Castiel had never spent long considering, it was never something he needed to know. He had wondered briefly what it was like, how it worked, what dreams really were. When he sat on the edge of the Winchester’s beds protecting them.
The drive was long and filled with the weight of unspoken words. The problem being Dean's inability to start an emotional conversation and Cas' inability to see the need for one.
Cas stuck his tongue out at Dean, scowl lines developing on his forehead.
"Cas, " Dean wrapped his arm around Cas' shoulder pulling him into his side, smirk on his lips as his free arm bobbed and down with his words, "this is why I need to be your guide through humanhood. It's called cotton cause it looks like cotton. It's really spun sugar."
Forcing himself Dean turns to look up at his brother, Sam shows no surprise instead he nods at him. "I know."
"So, what makes you a good person is if you try to help people even if it doesn't work out?"
"I just thought since you're new to food and it no longer is just 'moleculey' that we could try a little of everything to find out what you like. Make things a little easier in the future."
care."
It's been several seconds and Dean still has yet to finish his sentence.
"Well maybe if you talked in a way that made sense like with effort instead of huffing whenever I do something wrong I could figure it out."
They were rushed into a small bench, by a frantic employee, shoulders bumping together.
Cas’ pushed the blanket the rest of the way off his neck, rolling onto his side. He poked his head out from under the bundle.
"When what Dean?"
Upon seeing Dean's pouting face, Sam exhaled loudly. "And what about Cas? We can't just leave him here alone, he has no idea how to function as a human. Let alone how to defend himself without his powers. What if something goes wrong?"
“Because I'm hungry.”
“What did you do?”
"Yeah." Dean whispered as he stared at the skeleton, a mixture of earthy fossil and bright white plaster suspended by string and plastic to a rough approximation. "But I bet you got to see lots of other things. There must be loads of examples of human's failures."
Cas. He's certain it's him. He recognised the deep timber of his voice. The one he remembers so vividly that he can hear it in his head berating him when he does something stupid, in his dreams saying things he's scared to want and in his nightmares screaming. The phone begins to slip through his fingers, he struggles to capture it again before bringing his shaking hand back up to his ear desperate to hear that voice again.
“You’re beautiful.”
"You're
“What?”
do you live if you're in fear?”
That Cas'
Turning his attention back to the sea, Cas watched the waves rush in and out pushing up against him, grasping him with their cold hands before being pulled back home by the others. “I don't understand how you're so strong.”
Leaning forward, Dean braced his hands on the table. "Maybe not."
Dean rolled his eyes. "I'm not a Victorian lady. I don't need no escort."
Cas could make him laugh in the worst of circumstances. Cas was always there when he truly needed him. Cas believed in him even when he was
Dean could see Sam's lips moving but he didn't seem to be processing any of the words. He was staring, it took him several seconds to realise it, but even then he didn't stop. Cas was alive. He never thought he would get to see him again. To see the stupid dirty trench coat, the messy black hair and his blue eyes and most importantly his smile. Cas didn't smile often, Dean was never sure if he was actually unhappy or if he simply didn't know that when he was he was supposed to smile. It had been many years since Dean gave himself the mission to make Cas smile more and even though it had only happened a couple of times laugh. Every time he did smile Dean couldn't help but stare at him at how beautifully adorable he was. Those thoughts used to scare him, but they’re all he thinks about anymore.
Dean drags his eyes away from Cas, damn it he was staring again. Way to be subtle Dean. Although Dean supposed that getting caught staring wasn't the worst thing. He was always finding his eyes drawn to the other, but Cas never said anything and if he did maybe it would be the breakthrough he wanted, a way to get Cas to confront him so that he didn't have to find a way to start the horrifying torturous conversation with emotions and feelings and all the things Dean has spent his entire life avoiding.
are we supposed to do that?"
"That's the thing Dean I don't think he can, even if he wanted to I think he cares about you too much. I get that it's scary, And I might not even get how this feels for you, but I think that it's worth the risk. I see how happy you make Cas. You're the only person that's ever made him laugh, even I can't do that.”
"Hi" Yep, awkward. This was diffenitively awkward.
Carefully as if they were too delicate for human touch, as though he was afraid that they would crumble to ash and fall to nothing in the gaps between he fingers and he would be forced to confront that none of this was real, Cas reached for the items. The paper didn't crumble or tear, his fingers did nothing but graze their surface as he pulled them out one by one. Old newspaper clippings from some of his favourite cases, receipts to pit stop dinners that served greasy bacon burgers and apple pie and a keychain of a little cartoon bee Sam had bought him.
He wasn't sure where he was, the ground was hard and solid underneath his hands and he was surrounded by trees that seemed to tower over him and mock his weakness.
Cas twisted off the cap and took a long swallow of the honey brown liquid, sweeter than the normal beers Dean drank with a hint of apple and cedar. "Thanks."
"What makes you
“Thank you. You don’t have to be helping me like this,” he gestured vaguely with his hand at the space around them, “But I appreciate it.”
Dean reached his hand out, before freezing in mid air, and dropping it back to his lap where it met with his other in an awkward repeated fumble. "Hey if you don't want to go back to your bed, you could stay here."
Dean watched the pan in front of him, frown pulling at his lips, Cas was concerning him. He knew rationally that Cas had every reason to behave differently, that was to be expected, but Dean had never been good at being rational. Instead he let his mind stew in all his worries.
"I know our lives are one never ending shit show. Pick any one of them and it would give normal people nightmares for years."
Cas turned a small lilt to the side of his mouth that let Dean know he had won.
Before, Dean was able to do something, to run at Lucifer, to warn cas, a blue light exploded before his eyes so bright he couldn't make out any shapes all he could see was blinding glowing blue. So blue that it made him think of Cas's eyes when he squints at him annoyed and grouchy about whatever he'd just said, when they crinkle around the edges as he smiled and Dean couldn't help but think that his eyes were clearer than any water, brighter than the sky in the summer somehow both intimidating in their brightness and seemingly never ending expanse and comforting in their familiarity.
Sam wiggled his eyebrows, a small sinister uptick to his lips. "Ohhh so does that mean."
Cas moved the gun. “That's good, except your hands are in the wrong place now.”
?" Sam smirked.
“Dean shouldn’t you be sleeping?” Cas tilted his head to the side and for once Dean didn’t push the thought of how cute he was down, choosing instead to let it echo in his head.
"What was that?"
Cas smiled a small uptick of his lips. "Thanks for the offer Dean, but I believe you need all your appendages. I'm sorry for bothering you."
“No one wants me like that even when I want them so there’s no-"
Dean stared at the glowing red portal in front of him, struggling to regain his breath. How could Cas have been so stupid? Dean was pissed. What could he possibly be thinking trying to take on Lucifer by himself?
It was easier to see what was important from a distance, to see how little differences there truly are between everything. His superiors had never liked his curiosity, his fascination with their father’s favourite creations.
“Throwing food is only going to attract more of them.” Cas gestured to the growing pile of birds bumping into each other even after the chip had been snatched, swallowed in a single heavy gulp.
"Learning real history, yeah there wasn't not much if that in our religious white washing American schools."
Dean and I have seen you at your worst and I’m
Forcing himself to face what he’s been hiding for years, he lifted his gaze back up to Cas’. “I have been for years.”
"Dean, health is important."
"Okay well .." Dean trailed his eyes up to the ceiling. "It's um it's late so we should probably…"
Tilting his head to the side, Cas asked "What's car-sickness?"
Dean knew Cas was dead could feel the stiffness setting in to his body, the coldness of his skin pressed against him, he could see the delicate lines of wings burned on either side of him but, Cas was a Winchester in every way that mattered and the laws of death rarely apply to the Winchester's. In fact one could say they even became good friends of death's in passing but far too annoying to stick around with. Just because he was holding Cas' body as he continued to rock back and forward didn't mean that there wasn't hope. He could be brought back he'd been brought before, he had to be Dean knew that he couldn't live without his angel.
Dean pushed his mug across the counter, where it dragged squeaking along the surface. "Well I didn't mean to and if he left me finish-"
"Well he-"
“Dean.” Cas interrupted, voice light.
Cas mumbled something indistinguishable under his breath, but pushed himself up and moved away from Dean.
His voice broke under the strength of his new found emotions. "My brothers and sisters, my family, they're falling too. Who knows what's going to happen to heaven? And I'm…
Icy tendrils whipped at his skin sending shivers down his spine. They wrapped around his arms and legs burrowing into his veins.
Dean stepped forward swinging, both hands on the knife as he cut through her head. He barely had time to wipe the blood off his forehead, before there was another vamp running at him screaming. Amateur. Never announce your attack if you're hoping for the element of surprise. The vampire grabbed his knife and Dean pulled the arm linking them forward using his strength to elbow him in the ribs successfully pulling his knife back. The vampire took a step back preparing for another strike, but Dean had managed to swing his blade through his neck before he could.
"Dean, Dean" Dean's eyes jump from staring at the burn marks spread on either side of Cas, they were so large and beautiful he would love to have seen them before. Not the glimpses he'd caught of whispy shadows in old barns and battlefields, but what they would have looked like unconfined to a vessel. He couldn't help but wonder what the wings would look like spread wide, moving in action. What they would have felt like? Would they have felt hard and veiny, like a crow's, able to slice at the wrong angle. Or would they have been soft like the stuffing of his pillows? He wishes he could have seen them, felt them to experience some part of Castiel's true form.
"Castiel, I only knew him for a short time and then it was only through what my mother said about him. But, you've know him for a long time haven't you?" Jack tilted his head questioningly to the side heart wrenchingly reminding him of Cas.
He stumbled out of the forest and into a large clearing. Hearing the rush of the wind louder in his ears than ever before, he covered them with his hands, struggling to block out the distressing sounds.
Dean tightened his grip, rocking Cas back and forward, nearly knocking him off balance. "What do you mean the angels are falling?"
Dean turned eyes searching for Cas, “I can’t live without you. Not again.”
After several seconds, Dean yawned, suddenly reminded it's the middle of the night and he hasn’t really slept properly in like a month.
"Cas", Dean drops his head into his hands, "God this feels so stupid. Praying to you when I know you're not here, that you can't hear me and that I won't get a response, but I guess what I'm trying to say is I miss you. Okay?” Dean grabbed the edge of the dresser, struggling to stand on his own.
“I can’t say it. I should be able to, because you're you and you deserve to hear it and how am I supposed to - if I can’t even."
Crossing his arms and turning to look away, Dean huffed, defensive pout pulling at his lips. "I know I just don't want him getting hurt."
Dean raised his machete with one hand and signalled to Cas with the other. Together they slowly inched forward straining their ears for any noises. Dean could hear nothing but his own breath far too steady for someone in his situation. Inching his way to the front door, Dean waved Cas behind him.
Eyes wide, Cas turned to Dean. "Cotton? Why would you eat cotton, wouldn't that be bad for you're-"
Dean stared at the door for several seconds before breathing deeply and moving to sit beside Castiel on the edge of his bed.
I'll teach you.”
Dean shrugged, grabbing the box of cassettes once they got to a long stretch of empty road. One hand gripping the wheel he used the other to flip through the tapes.
Dean chuckled. "The Ferris wheel is really slow, so you'll be fine."
Cas hasn't even been back for a couple of days and Dean's happier than he's been since... well Sam can't remember the last time Dean acted like this. It had certainly been too long. Castiel was good for Dean and Sam knew that Dean was good for Cas too. It was obvious they needed each other, that they care for each other, that they love each other. He wondered how it took so long for either of them to notice and how even after all these years they both were too stubborn to do anything.
