Settling his head back down, the detective lay protectively over the prone form of the army doctor, warming him with his body heat and fur. The Wolf’s verdigris eyes followed his every movement as he checked the human’s vitals, making notes in his file, and changed the bedpan. “I’ll be back in a few hours,” he said, pausing at the door, “Alert me if anything changes or if you need a break.”
He gave a small shrug. “As the biological father, I would say that the task falls to you. However, I am perfectly content to leave our carnal relationship out of the knowledge of our thirteen year old.”
The other man glowered back at him before tipping his head slightly to the right. “Obsessing over something that hasn’t happened yet, or that may not happen at all, is not good for anyone,” the man murmured, his eyes hard but concerned. “Even you, Sherlock.”
bloody mobile! Get it yourself!” John sounded flustered, though the detective had no idea why.

The Wolf, while obviously frightened, gave her a small look that could only be described as reassuring. His tags, wired to Mycroft, hung from his neck, capturing everything. She simply prayed that the eldest Holmes brother wasn’t too late.
“Detective Inspector?”
“It’s fine,” Sherlock’s baritone called after him, “We’re done!”
“Uncle Ford’s going to tell me about being a Pup!” she practically exclaimed, beyond excited at the prospect.
, or wolf,
“Sounds perfect, Sherrinford,” she replied, giving him a wave as he slowly backed through the door and closed it firmly behind him.
“Molly?” Mycroft’s soft voice drew her attention to the top of the stairs, “The midwife’s on her way.” Her husband descended the stairs, taking her hand that had been on the bannister, and wrapping his other arm around her waist. “Let’s get you off the stairs, darling.”
, he added mentally.
He welcomed his anxious wife into his arms, taking Benedict from her as he pulled her close. “You are a wonderful mother, Mol,” he murmured, pressing kisses onto her forehead and into her hair. “This is our first Full Moon. Next time, Sherrinford and maybe even Sherlock will be here for Thomas the whole time. It can only get better from here. I promise.”
The car pulled into the park and Mycroft shut off the engine with a sigh. “Home sweet home,” the statesman murmured, releasing his belt and opening his door. “I’ll come get you, Darling. Wait for me.”
The apartment was, thankfully, in one piece when they arrived, though the detective was pacing enough to wear a track into the wooden floor. His scent had perforated the area, saturating it with his unique essence. He inhaled deeply.
“My pleasure,” he replied, exiting the nursery with his precious cargo and heading down the hallway. Thomas, sensing his closeness, Shifted and snuggled into his chest, his little nose working even as his toothless mouth opened in a wide yawn. The sight brought his own desire for Pups to the fore but he quickly forced it down again. Some things took time and had to wait. Procreation, at a time like this, was one of them.
Ahem. That would be a 'no' as well.
"So, what's the plan here, Sherlock?" John asked, scanning the dance floor from his seat.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
John would like me to take Rosie home. He said he'll stop by my place for her on his way home from work.
They do when they don't want an electronic paper trail. Her body was found bleeding out on an ottoman rug. But something's off. When Nazir and I checked under the rug for clues, there wasn't a second stain on the floor.
NAZIR
For God's sake, why?
(with concern)
Measuring you "victim's" arousal by checking for an elevated pulse--

(chortling)
MYCROFT
It was a bloody disaster the last time it happened, don't you remember? When you faked your death, the two of you were a complete wreck. Then you returned to London only to find him with Mary... and when you and John were thus reunited but NOT permitted to be in the same paddock anymore... Lord, that was somehow even worse!
So, you've told someone 'I love you' before?
Only top twenty?
We've been having a lot of problems with a Peruvian drug ring setting up shop north of London...
Snack!
Thank you, Sherlock. Now, dear brother, it is your turn to air your grievances about your own love life. I believe that may have been your original intention when inquiring about mine... the fact you received an actual heartfelt response came as a complete surprise, no doubt.
John looked up at Sherlock briefly and then back down at his drink, stabbing at a wedge of lime floating in the glass with his straw.
Sherlock looked away sadly, as did John.
I've missed you.
What's that?
"Consider it a forced suicide mission," he said.
(pointing)
CLERK
It's no problem.
SHERLOCK
What?
SHERLOCK
Sherlock sniffs deeply and shakes his head in disappointment.
SHERLOCK
Careful, Rosie, Careful.
MRS HUDSON
Oh GOD!
LESTRADE
John glances at the sex toy bag on the dresser and then back to his hands.
And my landlady Mrs. Hudson thinks I'm already in love and don't know it already, which I find highly improbable.
(turning to Sherlock)
Bye-Bye Dada!
(bellowing)
A cry can be heard over the baby monitor.
Smut alert for last half of chapter.
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SITTING ROOM - THURSDAY
Fine!
I wish you well, too, Sherlock.
John experiments with a pattern of shallow thrusts alternating with deeper ones, and Sherlock gives small cries of pleasure for each new change in the rhythm.
SHERLOCK
I'll just stay and catch up on my charts and reports then.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock nods.
The question is, are you so inclined?
MRS HUDSON
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - KITCHEN - EVENING
Okay maybe you did, a little. But that's not the real reason you wanted to chat.
NAZIR
Shhh, sleeping.
Where was I?
Ooooooo!
But John was in no mood for levity.
But he will now... he'll be seeing Dr. Kessler first thing Monday morning.
What? Is there a problem, John?
(nervously)
"I did do that, didn't I?" Sherlock chuckled back.
Hello? Anyone home? Sherlock?
(scoffing)
SLEEP IN MY ROOM TONIGHT. ONLY SLEEP. PLS.
ready to see them go; her words fairly ushered them out the door.
Some, yes.
I don't recognize them. Are they new?
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
NAZIR
(distracted)
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
(gruffly)
So formal, John.
I was forced to tell my friend 'I love you' so that she would say it back to me. At the time, my sister Eurus --
(straining)
SHERLOCK
Irene faces Sherlock, standing her ground.
I will cut to the chase: my boyfriend is in love with me but I don't reciprocate the feelings.
Two orgasms in one day... within an hour of each other. You should be very proud of yourself, Sherlock.
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SITTING ROOM - THURSDAY EVENING
(painfully)
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SITTING ROOM - AFTERNOON
MYCROFT
You bet. At therapy, on a weekly basis. Show me the texts, Sherlock.
Hmph.
NAZIR
SHERLOCK
Yes, go. Rosie and I have a big, big morning of messes to make and things to do. So, off you go.
Look at me... yes, you can make yourself come, Sherlock.
Great! Bye!
SHERLOCK
Glad to hear it. She's very good. She was my mentor, in fact. I daresay she's brilliant, in a no-nonsense sort of way.
You are going to have to beat the blokes off with a stick wearing that.
(annoyed, snippy)
SHERLOCK
(placating John)
Sherlock...
(embarrassed)
SHERLOCK
The teacher glances at their watch.
It's hot seeing you flustered like this, Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
AUDREY
Sherlock continues to build a Duplo cemetery for Rosie as he talks. Rosie makes ghost noises and other playful sounds.
We'll do all we can to make sure that doesn't have to happen.
(sexily)
SHERLOCK
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
(huskily)
SHERLOCK
John turns quickly to see Rosie precariously climbing onto the kitchen table.
Finish up breakfast, Rosie. We have to leave.
(sighing)
Sherlock again flips through the files.
(reads paper)
(stifling a yawn)
DR HERSCHER
(gasping with delight)
I'm sorry, you aren't on the pick-up list.
(quietly)
Oh really?
(recovering)
It's fine, it's all fine, John. Having you here is all that I need and want. Good night.
Uh, that only means I made your bed for you... doesn't mean I actually slept --
It has been a busy week, Sherlock. A particularly busy week.
(subdued)
And two small dogs.
(tapping notepad)
So, John... How does it feel being a couple?
Fomo?
The perfect position for eye contact... touching... talking... being able to see what's going on. All so important, isn't it, Sherlock?
Jealous. Raging jealousy, Sherlock.
Irene: Is it serious?
Some random woman who happens to smile at you on the bus, probably my long-lost cousin in disguise, or something.
(shrugging)
This. Being tended to.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock!!
You sexy giraffe, you.
Sherlock's phone rings.
You're dating John while in a serious relationship with another man?
MOLLY
Rosie rolls out of downward-facing dog and giggles. Sherlock smiles at her, but is soon distracted by John doing yet more stretching that showcase his backside nicely. Sherlock sighs with longing.
SHERLOCK
Er... sort of take up the whole middle, usually.
John moans again and sways his hips back and forth. Sherlock's breath hitches as he watches one of his partner's favorite body parts in action.
AUDREY
(murmuring darkly)
Rosie giggles.
One of John's mum friends. They're right chums, those two are.
(laughing nervously)
We need to get you back to sleep. What seems to be the problem? You seem to have lost your bee. Where did it go? Let's look... Oh, here it is.
(eying Sherlock disdainfully)
John shoots him a dirty look.
(struggling)
(looking kindly at John)
John lifts his head and looks up at his face, intrigued, wanting Sherlock to continue.
ROSIE
Sherlock begins to rock himself against both John's hands.
Oh my. I'll take that as a yes. Let's see... today you discovered that you get off exploring my bum... sticking one thing after another up my arsehole.
MYCROFT
Sherlock approaches John, gently takes the bag from him, and walks over and puts it high up on the bookshelf where short people can't reach.
SHERLOCK
(interrupting)
John. Really, I'll wait.
It's all Sherlock, I swear! I don't know what's gotten into him today, and frankly it's driving me batty.
(whispering seductively)
(dismissively)
Love is a funny emotion, Sherlock. And not that easy to spot, even for someone, like myself, who has been in my profession for decades... and even a master or deduction like yourself. It's because people are too good at fooling themselves when it comes to love. I can't tell you the number of clients I've had who had thoroughly convinced themselves... and me... that they were very much in love with their partner, only to find out they weren't. Or, others who were so in denial that they couldn't see how deeply they were in love with someone.
Good night, John.
I have a feeling you didn't come here today to tease me about Nazir or help solve a case.
(whispering)
SHERLOCK
IRENE
MOLLY
Eurus only blinks.
Okay.
Rosie flails with glee, knocking her toast on the floor. She looks down at it in dismay, fussing.
(perturbed)
ROSIE (V.O)
Now begone. You have work to do, detective. You too, Dr. Watson.
SHERLOCK
He leaned more John's way and said, "I happen to like all sides of your personality, John."
Sherlock quirks up a smile at her.
What happens on Monday?
I really don't mind, John.
Yes, but this isn't casework. This is different. Like you're contemplating life's biggest mysteries or something.
AUDREY
MOLLY
Isn't it though? Let's get started, shall we?
Your sarcasm is duly noted, brother dear. Need I remind you that you DID ask about my love life. One who asks such things should have the common decency to listen without such rudeness.
What's happening?
What? Why?
Sherlock huffs out a breath and straightens his suit jacket. He smiles at Mrs. Hudson and picks up a biscuit to dunk into his tea.
Molly hustles out the door. Nazir approaches Sherlock, slowly but purposefully.
SHERLOCK
He dares to knock a little louder. The door opens.
Er... Big Dick Holmes. Dick for detective, I assume.
Forensics checked for it.
I insist.
They're Himalayan salt lamps. I had a girlfriend who loved them.
(quietly)
No, I don't think you do. And it's only about looks. You have a magnetism about you.
Oh, Sherlock! That's fantastic!
Oh for...
Well, Rosie Sherlock, if you are going to wear the funny hat, then we'd better be solving a mystery of some kind or another...
(calmly)
SHERLOCK
(sarcastically)
MRS HUDSON
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
"No," Sherlock sneered indignantly, "What's it to you anyway, John?"
SHERLOCK
All right then. No bees. Erm... nations of the world?
SHERLOCK
(huskily)
Sherlock enters carrying Rosie in a hurry.
Oh! Okay...
SHERLOCK
(exasperated)
SHERLOCK
Don't mention it.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Sherlock can only scowl at this. He looks down and pats the violin case affectionately.
We may not even get to this one today. Is that clear?
Hello.
SHERLOCK
Really! But DO stop treating me like I am merely her babysitter--
I'll bring it when I'm good and ready!
Yeah.
I've also fantasized about having sex on your chair, too, Sherlock. You must know how badly I want to ride that giant prick of yours...
Oh, don't be too hard on this Rojas person. I stand by my hunch that this is an accidental framing.
SHERLOCK
So it is.
And his answer's been the same each time: No.
"It was the day you were being banished to Eastern Europe after shooting Magnussen," John began, "Do you remember?"
(quietly, but shocked)
MOLLY
(annoyed but amused)
MYCROFT
I was speaking metaphorically.
MYCROFT
My tailor? Sherlock! No, you didn't.
Okay then. Well done... you know... discussing the relationship, Sherlock. I'm very proud of you for speaking up.
John clapped him on the shoulder. "Let's go."
(whispering)
Sherlock looks a teensy bit hopeful.
Rosie is asleep on the sofa with the bear and bee close by. Sherlock silently and carefully places some chair backs towards the sofa so there’s no chance that Rosie will roll off. Satisfied with his safety measures, he turns to look for John. John isn’t there, so Sherlock noiselessly makes his way to the kitchen.
Sherlock's hand brushes John's crotch, making John jump and his erection grow stronger.
Now, I must investigate the guest bath before John gets antsy and sets off the fire alarm again. It didn't go so well for us last time.
Oh? Well, she sounds very wise.
SHERLOCK
Okay.
NAZIR
INT. 221B BAKER STREET  - FRIDAY NIGHT
John walks over to snap the baby monitor off and exits in a hurry.  Sherlock paces, anxious, as he listens for John's heavy tread on the stairs. He walks over and switches the baby monitor back on and sits on the corner of the bed. Rosie's wails fill the room again.
You've got this, Sherlock. You can do it. That's a good boy.
SHERLOCK
Will you first tell me what triggered your SVT tonight?
But they are clearly too long. Look at them!
How are you, Sherlock?
John scratches his head at Sherlock's enigmatic comment, but gives up.
Sherlock freezes.
Shit!
IRENE
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
John's phone pings. He digs it out of his pocket and reads the message. The text reads:
Right. So, Madame Imelda excuses herself during the middle of the session, claiming she needs some fresh air. When she returns, she finds the clients sprawled out on the floor unconscious. She screams and phones the ambulance. The medics arrive and start working, but they, too, begin to get lightheaded, so they throw open the window.
(with surprise and intense desire)
EXT. BARTS - A FEW MINUTES LATER
I meant what I said. I apologize for blowing up at you in your bedroom the other night. I know I've been pushing you too much. Particularly with the physical stuff, the sex stuff. I'm sorry.
"What, do you think it was dumb luck that I happened to shove that bottle of champagne in your face at that exact moment?"
MRS HUDSON
would have to be the suicide... the killer shooting his victim first and then himself. However...
There's a big part of me that is screaming to slam on the brakes right now... But, my kissing you--
Mycroft takes another sip of tea and makes a mental note to be the one who chooses the coffee shop next time, one without a television.
But --
You could have called me. I could have picked her up so you didn't have to miss work.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
She spotted ya.
Er... yes. I gotta get this laundry folded first.
Now you've done it, Mycroft.
By now, John's groping of Sherlock's ass has gotten serious. Sherlock groans loudly.
I should have brought Nazir instead.
Sherlock lets himself relax as John works.
Sherlock snakes his free hand around John's chest, holding John even closer to him. John gasps.
I do. That's why I can't go running after you into dangerous situations anymore. As much as I want to... and God help me, I really want to... I can't.
"You stay here," Sherlock said. But when John looked at him anxiously as Sherlock began to walk away, he added, "I'll be right back." He returned with flannels for both of them to clean themselves up. The men silently adjusted themselves and their clothing, although Sherlock didn't bother to button up his shirt: there seemed no reason for modesty after the experience they'd just shared together. They sat side by side on the sofa, sated and worn out. John reached over and rested a hand on Sherlock's forearm. It occurred to him that John had insisted on near-constant physical contact with Sherlock ever since they’d started kissing in the dance club booth—as if now
Sherlock stops and looks around the room carefully.
I brought you a veggie lasagna. I had it in the freezer.  All this cheese might not be good for someone with a heart condition though...
You might not remember the details of the day... I sometimes put more significance on events than the average person --
You really know how to sweet-talk a boy, don't you?
You two have my blessing. And it sounds like you are going to need it, too.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
What will we do with this repression of yours?
(nodding)
SHERLOCK
This chapter references the Arthur Conan Doyle short story "The Adventure of the Second Stain".
Some advice, maybe don't show these to John any time soon.
DR HERSCHER
AUDREY
SHERLOCK
ANGELINE
SHERLOCK
As always, thank you for reading.
CLERK
Sherlock glares at him. Mycroft studies him carefully before continuing.
He plops Rosie down on the changing table. He grabs a picture book off her bookshelf and hands it to her.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
By the way, Nazir's very nice, Molly. Your brand of nice, in fact. And, by the way, it was the steroids that put the kibosh on Mr. Lee here.
NAZIR
John reads in bed. Sherlock sweeps into the room and takes off his suit jacket, hanging it on a hanger behind the door. He begins to undo his cufflinks, but John quickly jumps out of the bed and stands in front of Sherlock.
Your sentiments towards her go beyond envy or jealousy or possessiveness, John. And yet, there was a time you were actively pushing me into her arms. Do you remember?
The sound of John exclaiming loudly as he climaxes can be heard through the door, followed by water running. Presently, John exits the bathroom looking contented and sleepy.
NORMAL people.
John cracks eggs into the pan and gets cooking.
MYCROFT
John nods sleepily. Sherlock uses a wipe for John's penis and another for his backside. Once done with the clean-up, Sherlock turns off the light and lies down next to John, snuggling up to him.
You, demanding so much of my attention, John. This part in particular...
It's not the sex, John. I really liked the sex bit. I may not always be able to keep up, but I like it.
"You're right. I did. It was a lovely souvenir." John could feel his eyes hurt, wanting to let out tears. He held them back.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock grunts and heads to the coffee maker. John cleans oatmeal off Rosie's face and hands.
ALDER:  DARLING BELIEVE ME, I TRIED YEARS AGO WITH NO SUCCESS. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'VE INSISTED ON LASHING YOURSELF TO SUCH A STUBBORN MULE ALL THESE YEARS
I see nothing wrong with the apparent imbalance in your relationship, then. Brains and empathy. Head and heart.
No, I changed into them after work. What's it to you, Sherlock?
Me: Yes.
TEACHER
John attempts to hand him the correct item, wrapped in waxed paper.
SHERLOCK
(a bit playfully)
Well, time to see our "dear sister", isn't it?
I'm pissing, what's it to you, Sherlock?
Since it is unlikely we'll ever meet again, I might as well say it now...
Are you as excited as I am to see Lestrade again?
Sherlock presses his cock all the way to the hilt and glories at feeling John squeeze around his whole length. Sherlock lets out a moan and John follows suit.
(confused)
Rosie continues singing as she climbs into her chair. John gets out breakfast items for then.
(enraged, too loudly)
DR HERSCHER
I have a very hard time believing that.
SHERLOCK
MOLLY
MOLLY
John enters through the door and walks to the center of the sitting room.
SHERLOCK
(breathlessly)
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SITTING ROOM - MONDAY EVENING
SHERLOCK
"I'm so sorry, John."
Sherlock sits cross-legged on the floor with Rosie, idly stacking Duplo. He grins up at John.
You're thinking of a seance. And no. None.
MRS HUDSON
She starts crying harder. John tries to clean up her toys while simultaneously comforting her.
ROSIE
Luckily the waistcoat fits perfectly and the jeans don't need anything... so that one, two, three items to be tailored. Usually it takes 7 to 10 business days, but I'll see if we can get them done more quickly.
ROSIE (OFF SCREEN O.S.)
Ms. Adler!
Gladly. Could you give me a hand with the lubricant?
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Oh, of course you will. This day has been bloody fantastic so far.
Are you okay, Lestrade?
(whispering darkly)
I've known you for ten years. I know when you're sad, John Watson. I may not be good at expressing my own emotions but I can certainly recognize them in others with reasonable accuracy.
looks our direction all night."
Now, if I'm keeping track, I owe you an orgasm. And if you permit me, I'd like to ride you, just like this, until you come and come and come, Sherlock.
In the dim light, John peers at his satisfied face in the mirror. He sighs with contentment. Not wishing to make noise, he opens the door to Sherlock's bedroom slowly.
NAZIR
Yes. John. Well. There's a bit of an imbalance in our relationship.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Rosie is very cranky, crying and rubbing her eyes. John picks her up and tries to comfort her. Sherlock watches them from his chair.
NAZIR
Sherlock lets go of John to rub his face in agitation.
John, will you... sleep in my bedroom with me tonight? To help monitor my SVT?
Your red pants happen on Monday.
(with some alarm)
Only if you continue with the... agitation-reducing foot thing.
So, someone who will remain unnamed must have finally let the cat out of the bag. And how is Goldie?
(finally quieter)
More than once?
SHERLOCK
How are you, Rosie girl?
Are you all right?
(quietly, seriously)
John freezes and fixes him with an icy stare.
(less calmly, rolling away from John)
I'd really like to --
For starters, you left my bed neater than I ever do. Hospital corners. It has to be that military training of yours.
Sherlock appears to have sunk into his mind palace and is blocking out all John is saying. John, disgruntled, turns back to the sink full of dishes.
(very faintly)
Mica runs up to Angeline.
"Sherlock, are you all right?"
Jealous because I wanted to be the one to be with you. I never had a claim on you, but that never stopped me from feeling like I was entitled to one. I'm sorry. It's completely irrational, I know.
(slyly, taking a sip of tea)
(hushed, with misgiving)
(with a twinkle in his eye)
SHERLOCK
(sleepily)
SHERLOCK
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SITTING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER
Sherlock?
Ha! Just like we've been dating "for months" now?
John carries a chair over to the bookshelf. He steps on the chair and retrieves Sherlock’s shopping bag full of sex toys from the shelf. He shakes the bag and peers into it. He looks at the clock on the mantle and purses his lips in thought.
CLERK
(bittersweetly)
SHERLOCK
Fu... John! I'm going to come!
Look what you've done to me, John. You and your red pants.
That she is.
(sadly)
(whispering)
Sherlock, relaxing on the bed, hums in agreement. John picks up the large dildo that they didn't use and inspects it.
I know I haven't handled things very well. I've been entirely too pushy. Mucked it up utterly. But Sherlock, I need some direction here. Tell me what you need from me.
John, you've worked so hard, and it will take so long. Perhaps we should give up for tonight.
SHERLOCK
(smiling)
John notices that Sherlock suddenly looks very tired.
Go ahead. I already know what you're going to say. Say it.
What even are those? Rocks? Crystals?
Next time, fewer clothes, if you don't mind.
Lestrade watches Molly go.
ROSIE (V.O.)
SHERLOCK
(sighing)
Sherlock nods in gentle encouragement. John rarely divulges this much about himself at one go, and Sherlock doesn't want to ruin it.
How often does that happen?
A father can't be forgetting a thing like that, John. What if Rosie's nursery should call, hm?
Sherlock closes his eyes to relish in his arousal.
SHERLOCK
Here. Let me help you.
SHERLOCK
A drawer. In your room. For my things.
Does this mean you're finally "getting some" as they say? Hmmm?
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
"Sherlock?" John's hands also
I have a very hard time believing that.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
John lifts his head to look down at him. Sherlock continues to gently stroke John internally, while working steadily on John's cock with his mouth. There's no way John is calling it off now. The pleasure he is receiving on both fronts is too great. John can't remember the last time sex felt this intense. He can feel his orgasm building quickly.
AUDREY
ROSIE
What would you say to having another go?
Sherlock turns his head John's way, contemplates him for a moment, and nods.
John confronts Sherlock about his behavior, with interesting results. Followed by much discussion.
Nazir's squad car is clearly stuck in rush-hour traffic.
SHERLOCK
Happy to oblige.
SHERLOCK
Yes, Sherlock. I believe you.
John wakes up abruptly. Sherlock is still spooning him, profoundly asleep.
"No wait," Sherlock objected, remaining stubbornly seated, "Kiss me one more time… it'll help solidify it in my hard drive."
True.
John turns to look at Sherlock in shock.
Yes, well, she's seems to be the only one who can put up with my quirks... she has the potential to be a halfway decent police inspector if she'd only put her mind to it... and she's the only officer who doesn't mind when I mistakenly call them 'John'.
You're a horrible person, John Watson. Your boyfriend is in the next room recovering from a heart episode, and all you think about is your own carnal needs.
"What about the rest?" Sherlock asked, gesturing towards the box as he helped Mrs. Hudson stack dishes on the tray. John ran a tongue over his lips nervously.
Wha...? Where are you going exactly?
SHERLOCK
Sherlock gives him a stern look and points to the bed. John lies down, pouting.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock rolls away from John again, pouting.
Sherlock looks hurt and puts his hand on his chest.
It's nothing, Sherlock. Just personal problems.
SHERLOCK
(small smile growing on face)
We have other plans.
(looking down in dismay)
SHERLOCK
John Watson, you get me so worked up.
SHERLOCK
Mrs. Hudson approaches the building and is alarmed by the presence of an ambulance parked haphazardly on the pavement.
I gave my umbrella to Rosie.
INT. KITCHEN - 15 MINUTES LATER
it was significantly better, and Sherlock had just commenced an experiment that involved flicking an inquisitive tongue into John's mouth when John let out a wanton moan. Sherlock desperately wanted to find out what else he could do to evoke more wonderful noises from John. He also wondered what it might feel like to touch John's skin under his shirt, and tugged lightly on John's tucked-in top.
What do you mean?
MRS HUDSON
AUDREY
SHERLOCK
Well, it's not my forte either, as some people are wont to remind me.
Yes, anything, Sherlock.
Sherlock's eyes grow wide in alarm. It is apparent that this hasn't crossed his mind.
LESTRADE
(glancing away)
Yes, there was some of that, wasn't there? It was definitely my turn to repay you for previous services rendered.
NOTE: This case is based on the original Arthur Conan Doyle story "The Adventure of the Devil's Foot".
Well, we'll need to discuss things. There'll be loads of discussions, actually.
Obviously.
Sherlock digs his phone out of his pocket and types away hurriedly. His text reads:
Barts?
On Wednesday, Sherlock offered to pick up Rosie from the nursery and bring her to the library, which is where John met them after getting off work. He arrived and discovered that Sherlock had found another single father of a toddler to flirt with. John was all courtesy and pleasant smiles while in the library, but as soon as they stepped out on the pavement with Rosie strapped in the stroller, he became surly and pouty, refusing to speak or even look at Sherlock. Sherlock took it as a very good sign—perhaps there was merit to Irene's hypothesis that Sherlock flirting with others would help John come to his senses. But alas, John's sour mood did not last. Within ten minutes, John had shaken himself out of his funk and was conversing with Sherlock as if nothing had happened.
SHERLOCK
Will you sleep in my bed again tonight?
Ugghh!
Sherlock regards John sourly. John furrows his brow in response.
(trying to speak rationally)
Whenever you like, no rush!
MYCROFT
, Sherlock thought. Occasionally, when Sherlock was feeling low, as he was tonight, he would whine to her about his poor excuse for a love life. And the object of discussion, and of Sherlock's affection, never wavered: Dr. John Watson.
We're having a tea party in our tent.
Just responding to my text… Er, all caps... "NO DON'T COME." So, Audrey's address is --
CLERK
(excitedly)
(winking)
Oh... some undercover work in Eastern Europe.
ROSIE
Wait, Sherlock!
SHERLOCK
Fine. But why don't you help me with --
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
John continues to stroke Sherlock's hair soothingly despite Sherlock looking more and more agitated.
SHERLOCK
John freezes in his work. He turns to Rosie and tries to smile.
(touched)
(pause)
They both drift off to sleep.
You don’t want to live with a baby. Trust me.
(amused)
Is it like that for you, Sherlock? When you do the penetrating?
Please, Sherlock. Are you really okay? Tell me what's wrong.
(sing-songy)
John flashes his eyes angrily at Sherlock. Rosie is wailing like mad, now.
Sherlock chuckles and begins licking and lapping at John's anus. John huffs out breaths of desire.
"One of the remodeling crew told me he found it when they moved the sofa," Sherlock explained, "Apparently, he took it home to give it a read first before bothering to let me know of its existence."
(coming up for air)
Fine. But all the same, it IS easier living here. Seriously. I was a wreck trying to raise Rosie on my own, with Mary gone.
How was sleeping on the sofa?
SHERLOCK
Sherlock enters and makes a beeline for the tea and biscuits.
(gravelly with desire)
John's not listening. He begins to pace.
(chuckling)
Doing what?
Oh God!
"I should probably get to bed." The extreme hesitancy in John's voice set off a sweet twang in Sherlock's chest. Sherlock was struck with an idea.
"Don't."
Rosie got the best of both you, I'd say. Mary's cleverness, and all her father's sweetness. And her head-strongness... from all three of you.
(taken aback)
DR HERSCHER
(from the kitchen)
That's good.
ROSIE
Oh, Sherlock...
An experiment.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock lightly massages the bell-end of John's cock, as he watched John do earlier.
INT. SHERLOCK'S ROOM - LATER SAME NIGHT
SHERLOCK
Great!
Sherlock takes hold of John's available hand and places it over Sherlock's heart. John feels Sherlock's racing heartbeat and looks at his face in alarm.
Sherlock in pajamas reads in bed on his phone. He tilts his head when he hears John's cough and rustling over the baby monitor. He quickly jots off a text to John, it reads:
John gives Sherlock a questioning, appraising look.
John turns his head away and smiles. Sherlock does as well. Sherlock finally, gently releases John's cock.
SHERLOCK
I doubt you'll find much, I clean them meticulously.
The lights are dim, but not off -- Sherlock wants to be able to see everything, after all. John stands in the middle of the room with his arms crossed, while Sherlock circles him slowly, contemplating, with a lusty grin on his lips and in his eyes. John doesn't know what to make of all this.
Sherlock grabs both John's hands with enthusiasm.
(calling after them)
No. And I'm not going to tell you.
AUDREY and ANGELINE, two parents from Rosie's nursery school, watch the children play in the sandpit. Rosie, DORIAN, and MICA (ages 2-3) are having a great time with shovels, pails, and other sand toys. Sherlock and John stand side by side in the background also watching the kids.
Thanks Sherl.
SHERLOCK
John hands Sherlock the shirt. Sherlock, frowning, swipes it out of his hands and puts it on in a huff. John returns to the dresser.
(smiling through tears)
MYCROFT
SHERLOCK
(from stroller)
John has his mouth back on Sherlock's prick in the next instance. Sherlock gasps in response. Sherlock's eyes close as he takes in all these sensations. It builds and builds.
"Yes, that would be fine," responded Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
Me: Yes.
And... MYSTRADE!! Heart emoji!
MYCROFT
There's vodka involved.
INT. COFFEE SHOP - FRIDAY - EARLY MORNING
The signs of three... Increased appetite, change of taste perception, you got sick this morning... Mary, I think you should do a pregnancy test.
The wound was in his brother’s collarbone and was bleeding so profusely, he wondered if his carotid artery had been punctured too.
) footsteps reached his ears along with slightly labored breathing.
______________________________
). The air rushed out of his lungs as the young girl tightened her grip on his neck slightly, her own howl ended.
sorry, John,” the youngest Holmes murmured as the man closed the door behind him and he sat down again.
A loud voice drifted from a seat to his right, causing his ears and wedge-shaped head to swivel in that direction. An older, balding man with white hair and a pot-belly was glaring at him as he spoke. “You claim to be born into the body you’re now inhabiting. I know for a fact that the Turned Wolves are not as comfortable. It’s stated in your very own report, Dr. Holmes. Is not placing them someplace where they can’t harm others while they, shall we say,
You can say that all you’d like but we both know that nothing will be
The new thought was a good one and so he called it out to Mycroft. “Also, make a note that he should come to Baskerville the day after the Moon so we can begin sessions. Same with any Lupus sapiens that see time as Wolves in the field. We want this project to succeed, which includes their mental states.”
“Are the littlest ones keeping you up?” he asked, moving to stand beside the British Government.
Immediately, the young woman’s utensils were placed on her plate with a bit of a clatter. He winced. “Yes!” she exclaimed, standing up and pushing her chair back. “Are we going now!?”
“Why was it bad?” he queried, his nerves rising and he allowed a rather weak sounding rumble resonate through his chest, the little Pup lifted up to his nose to allow him to snuffle his scent glands before settling him over his heart. Thomas, enjoying the attention, quickly quieted even as Benedict continued to mewl and fuss.
“I never said that, John,” he muttered, hurt that the other man had guessed his plan of action. There were moments, like this one, where the other man continued to surprise him - one of the many reasons why he loved him.
The dark-haired man’s nostrils flared, his mouth set in a grim line. “Wolfsbane and rubbish,” he noted into the air, not bothering to look at him. “Though I’m sure Eddington’s been by and told you as much.” He bent, pulling latex gloves over his violinist’s fingers. “Since we already know that he is Ernest Hampsted - Lupus sapiens, turned eight years ago, spends his Moons at Baskerville and has quasi-psychiatric appointments with my younger brother following each Full Moon, family doesn’t know and is species-ist/racist whatever we’re calling the people who view the Wolves as less than human - I’ll just examine the corpse for something beyond the obvious, shall I?”
_ _ _ _ _
There was a significant pause between them, their ears humming with the silence. The wolf broke it, taking a few more steps forward. “I am so sorry. I-I should have told you...”
. He raised his head, making the woman jump a bit at the top of the stairs. “He’s a big beast, isn’t he?” she breathed, walking by him even though her fear skyrocketed. He opened his mouth, panting, and gave his tail a small wag.
They were being reduced to dogs in shelters or common criminals and he loathed it. He suppressed a shudder at the thought of what his brothers would say, fixing his rigid, unfeeling mask in place. The session was called to a close with the promise of continued discussion on Monday. There was nothing he could do until then except gather as much information about the need for Lupus sapiens in British Society with fewer restrictions and an emphasis on their humanity.
_ _ _ _ _
“I-I,” the doctor paused, releasing a shaky breath. “I like your parents, Sherlock. We’re here for you and your comfort. You’d tear Baker Street apart before the night was up and the parks aren’t nearly as safe as a private property.”
“Let’s take a look at the outdoor enclosures,” the older man said, opening the door to the flat. Pouring on his speed, he launched himself past the slow-moving humans and into the hallway beyond. His feet skidded a bit on the linoleum but he caught himself before his rather large lupine nose hit the floor. The air seemed a bit freer out here and his heart slowed to a significantly slower pounding pace than it had been seconds before he gulped pants of ‘clear’ air.
_________________________________________
While his search turned up several interesting men, and one rather peculiar woman, he doubted that any of them were the culprit. None of them seemed to go after anything as peculiar as another human being in a pelt. His frustration dissipated as the sound of trudging steps accompanied by the lighter tread of a lighter soul reached his ears.
He didn’t need to be asked twice, especially not when his favorite niece was in obvious distress. He loped a few strides towards Evelyn and her tear-streaked face, her need palpable. He nuzzled her cheek, encouraging her to release her grip on his elder sibling. Without more than a bleary glance, she released the detective and he took her crumpling bodyweight around his thick neck. His tongue caressed the salty trails from her pink cheeks as he rumbled deep in his chest, trying to comfort the young woman.
“It all depends on what is in your gut, Darling,” he said, sitting across from the girl. “Either way, we’ll still love you, Evy. And that is a promise.” He smiled, lips pressed together firmly. He reached across the worn wood of the table and rubbed the blonde woman’s arm reassuringly. “What would you like for dinner?”
“Pop.” Sherlock rolled the title about in his mouth like a wad of chewing gum. He popped both P’s with relish. “That makes me sound like an old man,” he grumbled.
“Welcome back to the land of the living,” the soft voice of Mycroft Holmes drew his attention, his ears swiveling and pulling on his head. He opened his eyes, displeased to find that his vision was fuzzy.
“Unproductive,” he exhaled, still not a fan of pleasantries, “I hope that you do not have much schoolwork to do. We are needed at Mycroft’s.”
He flushed, not used to the complement. “I can only try.”
. The pressure made her palms sticky. She wiped them on her pants before reaching up to take the brass knocker in her right hand.
The bald man laughed humorlessly. “Nice try, Bud. But the sentiment is nice.”
, for the best?”
He bit back a growl and followed the other man down the stairs, aware that the teen was following him while still allowing him to have his own space.
“I think
The questions were generally innocuous and expected. “How are the patients referred here?”
He sighed, stomping his tired feet up to his flat cursing the third floor location in harsh, muted tones while simultaneously glad of the exercise.
The detective’s eye roll was large and impossible to ignore. “I suppose that it might be necessary-”
Thomas quieted, making Molly breathe and audible sigh of relief. “How did you…? Never mind, never mind…Just keep doing whatever you’re do…” She stopped, gasping as the baby began to quiver.
He could hear his quasi-daughter moving about the apartment upstairs. He wouldn’t have paid her any mind except that her steps were heavy, very uncharacteristic of the soon-to-be fourteen year old. She was usually so light in her tread, like she was floating on clouds, that it gave him pause. Enough pause that he was pulled from his Mind Palace.
“You see,” Molly stated, inclining her head, “There are two perfectly capable babysitters…”
“But that was why they did it!” he hissed, “
“She’s not a Wolf,” Sherlock observed, his heterochromic eyes fixing on his face.
When they arrived at Downing Street and had knocked on the door, he was a bit surprised to find Sherrinford there to meet him, dressed rather shabbily in jeans and an old t-shirt, his feet bare and his hair mussed. The man smiled, tilting his head to the left ever so slightly as he stepped back.
She slipped her wedges on, knowing that they made her legs look longer (
. “I’m assuming that something is bothering you,” he stated, knowing as much.
“BOYS!” Mrs. Hudson shrieked up the stairs, “Stop your racket at once! Connie Prince is on the Telly!”
The statesman nodded, rubbing his face as he sighed heavily again. They both looked back the crime scene, watching the younger Holmes boys traipse through it. Sherrinford’s tail was wagging as Sherlock’s coat fluttered about him like giant wings. It was all rather ridiculous looking, making him glad that the Chief Inspector wasn’t here to see the comedic scene that was playing out before him. If he had been, he’d be finished.
“Okay,” she breathed, her legs shaking a bit with the strain of walking with her off-balance body. “Is the tub ready?”
“Yeah, Mum,” she sighed, trying to steady her racing heartbeat as she watched Sherrinford reveal his true self to the world for the thirty-second time, “It’s everywhere.”
“We’re going out tonight. We won’t be back until the morning, most likely. Just leave some clothes outside and we’ll shower and be on our best human behavior tomorrow.”
“Thank you, Sir,” the man said, turning his back on the table and stripping down to his pants and tags.
The brunette rolled his eyes and released a rather adolescent huff.
With a sharp exhale followed by a violent tug that secured his mobile, he grated out a thank you. Sherrinford didn’t move, reading the text from their elder brother over his shoulder, making him hunch uncomfortably. Gritting his teeth, he turned his focus to the screen before him.
He noted that the other chair opposite the silver-haired man was occupied by a young man. A man whose nostrils were flared wide.
Even after all these years, it still made him smile to find John in awe of his ability to read the situation through the obvious details. Or at least what was obvious to him. He smirked at the other man. “I won’t go out tonight, John, but everything will come to light eventually. I will be compromised sometime, somewhere. Sherrinford will fall, too. But no one will come for you or for Evelyn. You will both be safe.” He sat bolt upright, fixing his Mate in his heterochromic gaze. “I swear to you, John.”
“Sherlock,” Sherrinford’s baritone murmured, “I need to run the final checks on my patients. I’ll meet you back here?”
. And he understood the man’s desire for his own space. After all, he was never pleased to have another Wolf in 221B, including his younger brother. It took so long for the scent to truly leave the flat.
“Wonderful,” he replied, feeling his own cheeks flush with pleasure. “How is 6:30 at Angelo’s?”
His thoughts were interrupted by a ding from his phone, signaling his reception of a text message. Unsure of where his mobile actually was, he yelled, “John!” over his shoulder, knowing that the other man was upstairs cooking bangers and mash for dinner.
Thomas yipped again, his nose working overtime as Sherrinford petted him and helped him to wriggle into his warm side. Evy’s brow furrowed, no doubt noting that the pup’s eyes, blue in human form, were shut and his fur was short and grey flecked with patches of reddish brown and points of black despite his wispy, chestnut head of hair. “He’s blind,” she whispered, a hand stroking the soft, silky fur, making the baby shiver, nose working overtime. Sherrinford nodded, a small hum rumbling in his chest. “Like a real wolf pup.” He nodded again. Thomas shivered back into his human shape with a yawn, settling back into his uncle’s heated chest with a yawn.
“In order to get a good pelt, she’ll need to strangle me somehow. So, I’m going to meet her family for dinner, make an excuse to Shift, and she’ll pretend to kill me. Wire my collar and, as we fake my death, move in. Sherlock or Eddington could find our killer and can put a hate group away for a long time.”
“Fine,” his niece replied quietly, returning her attention to her homework.
Sherlock nods and John leaves the room to head upstairs.
INT. IRENE'S FOYER - A FEW MINUTES LATER
SHERLOCK
I'm waiting.
SHERLOCK
to see Sherlock. It was just that he constantly wrestled with wishing to put more emotional space between himself and his friend, and missing Sherlock so terribly that he grew agitated for days leading up to these visits. He sighed to relieve his agitation as he transferred Rosie to his other hip and knocked on the door.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
MOLLY
(giggling)
(narrowing eyes, anger growing)
Sherlock and John comfort Mrs. Hudson after she has just been attacked and tied up by American agents looking for Irene Adler's phone in 221B Baker Street. However, Mrs. Hudson proves to be cleverer than John anticipated: She has slipped the phone out of the flat without the Americans noticing.
ROSIE
Well, all right, if I can undress you as well.
SHERLOCK
(smiling again)
Er... out? I mean... down?
Bah, apparently Scotland Yard likes to take it easy on the weekends, even if crime never sleeps. There's not much I can do today until Lestrade and Nazir decide to respond to my texts. My many, many, texts. So, it looks like I'm all yours.
John's hips snap up. John's cock thrusts into Sherlock's hand and mouth. Sherlock has to focus to keep the proper positioning of the vibrator on John's prostate as John writhes beneath him.
John, are you going to be okay? Sherlock, what's wrong, luv?
No, nothing new, nothing at all. Look, gotta dash. Nice seeing you all!
SHERLOCK
I happened to see Lestrade this week.
SHERLOCK
This is Sherlock Holmes.
(with soft admonishment)
It just wasn't the right position for you, that's all.
MOLLY
Exactly.
No. That was my way of saying thank you for a lovely evening, John. The wonderful surprise you planned for me.
(mumbling, mostly to self)
I thought you weren't going to tease me anymore.
John fixes him with a disapproving stare.
AUDREY
SHERLOCK
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SITTING ROOM - LATER THURSDAY NIGHT
Sherlock shoots him a wilting look.
Don't say it John.
SHERLOCK
That bloody big brain of yours getting in the way...
(shoveling eggs into his mouth)
Fine. As you are well aware, Gregory and I have been in a relationship for several months. In many ways it is going well...
Well, I'm no walk in the park either, Audrey. With PTSD and anger management issues, I've taken my frustrations out on him a handful of times, quite painfully I'm afraid. I'm not proud of it, but they've happened.
About these tight trousers of yours...
Excuse me, you just bulldozed me off the bed with said arse!
SHERLOCK
Yeah, a bit, actually.
MRS HUDSON
John, dressed, pulls ingredients out of the cupboard and refrigerator. Sherlock, also dressed, enters. Sherlock and John smile at each other coyly, in the manner of two people who have spent the whole day having spicy sex with each other.
I'll do so.
(while reading)
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - KITCHEN - SUNDAY NIGHT
John gazed at Sherlock. John opened his mouth to speak, but then closed it again, as if all his emotional bravery had been used up for the day and he no longer trusted what he might say. He gave Sherlock a closed-lip nod. Sherlock regarded him stoically. John felt a stab of regret in his heart as he turned from Sherlock to join Mrs. Hudson and Rosie.
(waving large dildo)
Good morning, Watsons.
Yes, absolutely. Turns out my afternoon has just opened up.
Things would move a lot faster if you'd put on the damn siren, you know.
Sherlock scoffs. John smiles devilishly at him.
The teacher consults a clipboard.
Sherlock. Look. You are a recovering intravenous drug user who has spent more than enough time in seedy drug dens. And I... well, I have had a million relationships, as you so kindly pointed out. I am afraid it is quite necessary.
(continues reading)
Rosie still whimpers.
Molly enters carrying a tray covered by a towel. Nazir follows close behind.
SHERLOCK
"Na, forget it, " he said, "Flirt with whomever you want, Sherlock. It's your life."
Oh, thank god! I was worried there for a moment.
SHERLOCK
(getting sadder by the moment)
(pulling out phone)
What's the plan today?
Sherlock grins knowingly and returns to looking into the microscope. Molly and Nazir shoot awkward glances at each other. John watches them, as confused as ever.
Fine Audrey, have it your way. Let's go Lestrade.
SHERLOCK
I don't even know anymore with those two.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Oh God, yes.
(severely)
SHERLOCK
Got a lot easier once you and Rosie moved in.
(with a small smile)
SHERLOCK
Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.
I can barely keep up with you, John.
Sherlock nearly swoons at this unexpected praise.
SHERLOCK
John wrinkles his nose; Sherlock is a little ripe.
(to John)
(shocked)
(dismayed)
(between hungry neck kisses)
Potty?
Look at you two little love birds.
Would you be able to watch Rosie for an hour?
Right. You can start a load of towels in the washer.
EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY
I could just talk you through the steps.
LESTRADE
Okay, first of all, that's not what I meant about being sensitive, and secondly, your theory is rubbish.
Sherlock ignores John and opens a bottle in a rush. He sniffs it deeply and smiles.
Sherlock!
(quietly)
So, you're hanging out at Barts on a Saturday just for funsies?
SHERLOCK
Okay, we'd better keep walking before the kids revolt.
Oh! You're up already! How did you...? How long have you been sitting there?
John flushes and licks his lips.
I take it ALL back.
(quietly but admonishingly)
Sherlock complies.
Not to worry, John. Just the embarrassing bits. Angeline, I didn't tell you about the time John got stuck with an ASBO for graffitiing.
SHERLOCK
Yes. Please. Please, John. I want it. I know you'll be gentle.
(still focused on phone)
Understood.
Nooo!
Really, you don't know?
You've avoided me for days... won't even touch me!
I take all my notes on paper.
Can't be done, Sherlock. I didn't realize how late it's getting. I've got a load of things to do before collecting Rosie. Shower, start laundry, get dinner prepped. I hadn't counted on a marathon afternoon sex session, let alone two.
Now look what you've done, John! There, there, Rosie.
(calmly)
MRS HUDSON
Yes, by all means, go. Run. Get in shape. Be healthy.
EXT. NURSERY SCHOOL - THURSDAY - AFTERNOON
(while texting)
John's sentence was left incomplete as Sherlock claimed his mouth with his. Sherlock kissed, and kissed, and kissed him. He only ceased when he felt a hand on his chest, and Sherlock's heart sank thinking John was signaling him to stop. But with half closed eyes, John trailed his hand down Sherlock's front, stopping at the top of his trousers, where he gave a flirty tug to bring Sherlock closer to him. It sent a thrill through Sherlock, and he wondered if there was a way to bring their bodies even closer. He took a step back, John instinctively stepped forward to follow, and Sherlock took several more backwards steps until his backside bumped into the table. There, partly-leaning and partly-sitting on the table, he planted his feet somewhat widely, grabbed John by the waist and pulled him in until their fronts pressed together. His mouth was presently on-level with John's, much more conducive to comfortably kissing.
Well, we're a couple now, so that makes it all right. Or something.
Sherlock responds by giving John another deep kiss, this time sliding his hand over John's shirt and down his belly to join John's busy hands.
What is it, a case?
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Sherlock replaces John's hands on the computer, typing and reading with impressive speed. When finished, Sherlock jumps off the bed and begins pacing.
NAZIR
Thank you. I've worked hard on it. And it reminds me a bit of another relationship you've had...
Like he's going to wear anything else but a suit. So what does it matter?
SHERLOCK
Far from it, dear, but thank you.
MYCROFT
(glances over shoulder at Sherlock)
(giving him a questioning look)
Sherlock flushes and looks away. He reaches up to run a hand along John's neck and chest.
________________________
oversized lapdogs.”
He stiffened. He remembered the Hunters in Germany. One of the reasons he was sent to boarding school was to protect him from them and their twisted, deadly games. His great-uncle, his father really, was a hard man and an even tougher Wolf who had made more enemies than friends. Because of that, he had attracted the attention of Hunters and kept moving, particularly after an incident when he was five. It was the first time he had seen a man die.
He had been scanning CCTV cameras around the dilapidated building for what seemed like hours. Normally, he’d relegate this task to someone lower on the totem pole, below himself and even his assistant, Anthea, but he did not want word of the deceased werewolf getting out. He was also searching feverishly for any history of this man on the internet. What was he involved in? Where did he go when he wasn’t working or shifting?
CAN WE VISIT SOON? I MISS YOU.
His younger brother continued, “Besides, her mother has asked for my pelt. She’ll only attack me when I’m in that form.”
Molly stopped him, absolutely beaming at him. “I’m so
Oddly, as their yowling filled the yard, he missed the added harmony of Sherrinford. The younger man was still a relatively new addition to their Pack, but he helped make it complete. Not that he’d ever tell Sherrinford that.
” He could feel the power in his own words, his long suppressed Alpha nature rushing through him like a shot of adrenaline.
The DI, who had been rather quiet through their exchange, leaned forward in his seat, his hands coming to rest on her desk, an eager look on his face. “We’ll have you tested for mental retention in your Wolf forms, but, I don’t see a problem with it,” Lestrade stated, his eyes fixed on him. “Perhaps the same test that the ‘specialist’ went through? I can present this request to the Chief Inspector and the board, but I think that, due to the success of the current program, I don’t see why they wouldn’t approve of it. And I should hope that
“In more ways than one,” Sherrinford murmured, cradling the Pup into his warm chest with a strange look on his face. His blue eyes shot up to meet those of the doctor. “Would you like to hold him, John? Let him smell you so he can recognize your scent?”
“Yes, well. She will be pleased, I’m sure.” He rose onto his elbows, arching his back in a stretch, his back popping as it only could after he had Shifted. As he stretched, the soldier rubbed his back, a soft grin on his face. The look was one that he had never experienced before and it made him feel warm and fuzzy inside. That feeling of satisfaction was one that he only achieved when he was getting his belly rubbed or his ears scratched.
He sighed.
With a nod to Sherrinford, he stood and moved off into the rest of the apartment, his steps echoed by those of his younger brother, his mind still on the conversation they had just had. John had told him that she had assumed for some time that his younger sibling was a werewolf. Including him shouldn’t be that difficult - after all, he spent nearly every Full Moon with her. She was quite smart and certainly would have noticed that Willie only came to stay on Full Moon nights and that he and Sherlock had never met or interacted.
Mycroft walked to the cribs, fingers brushing chubby cheeks, a soft smile playing at his lips. “I’ve condemned you all. The Law - it was my own idea and I’ve watched my family suffer for it - you’ve been fighting everything that you are to fit within it. And now you’ll end up living your life in a cage. I’m so sorry, Sherrinford.”
He grinned down at her. She was beautiful - by far his favorite niece (though Lucy was so young and he had spent so little time with her, it was difficult to claim otherwise). Her blonde hair had a light curl to it and her eyes matched his, a dancing blue. His brother was lucky to have such a wonderful pup through his connection to his Mate. Maybe, thinking about the woman he had just left behind, he would be lucky too.
Not voicing any of his insecurities as the hair on the back of his neck rose uncomfortably, he gave Imogen a smile and gestured her towards a free table next to the wall. Sherlock, being ridiculous as usual, followed and plopped himself down in the seat beside Imogen, a kind smile on his face. “Well, hello Brother dear,” the older man intoned.
“Not yet,” he muttered, hesitantly shooting Sherrinford an apologetic look. The other man raised an eyebrow at him even as his cheeks flushed with embarrassment, displeased by his reaction. “What are your plans?”
“Why do you do that?” she asked, her hand still covering her cheek and the atrocious ink blot that resided there.
John, hands shaking slightly, handed the computer to him. “Every other request has something to do with ...with Lupus sapiens.”
“Can I ask what makes him special, or does that break Doctor-Patient confidentiality?”
The teen was caught among her plaid sheets, her limbs wrapped uncomfortably in the materials twitching and tugging as she whimpered, “No! Stop! Please!”
“Yes,” he retorted sharply, raising his chin.
Her father turned from his paperwork to look at her. “That’s an interesting conclusion to come to. Why do you ask?”
Sherrinford looked offended at the suggestion while Molly gave him a small, knowing smile. She knew that keeping the secret was hard and the wolfsbane injection was truly awful with very little end gain.
The soldier shook his head infinitesimally, his head shifting slightly on his sternum. “I can’t believe we’re here,” the man’s voice, gruff with sleep stated.
, he noted.
“Not Molly?” John asked, his eyes wide and his brow furrowed, analyzing the situation.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” he muttered, trying to keep his eyes from flickering to his wall. The wall that provided nothing. No insight whatsoever. He wished that he could grab John’s Sig and shoot it again. At least then it would prove useful for something. His Mate, however, knew him too well and had decided to carry it on his person so he couldn’t pick the lock on his safe and shoot the bloody wall.
Hours later, John Watson emerged from the surgery looking exhausted and a bit downtrodden. As one, he and his younger sibling rose, worry coming to a point.
“Where are they?” Lucy squealed quietly, her eyes wide. Nathaniel looked just as excited but he masked it well.
it on her,” he said quietly, diverting his gaze from the Alpha couple of his Pack as his cheeks flushed. “Her scent is so intoxicating, so distracting. I just want it with me. All the time. Everywhere I go. I need it to function to live.” He looked up at the couple across from him, narrowing his eyes. “Surely you understand? Surely you can feel it, growing within yourselves? It’s been getting stronger since the attack. I can sense it, smell it. Can’t you Sherlock?”
The older man gently handed his wriggling parcel over, Thomas’ pink nose flaring and snuffling. “He’s all yours,” John murmured, smiling, “I’ve got to call Evy anyway, let her know that her favorite uncle’s doing just fine.”
“Could I hold him?” the natural born Wolf asked softly, extending his hands, “I haven’t been able to yet.”
The single syllable world hit the man beside her hard, making him flinch, his pride wounded. After a moment of silence, he stammered, “I am sorry that you think that, Sir-”
His final stop was at Sean’s flat. Knocking on the door, he waited for it to open and tipped his head when it did, submitting in another Wolf’s territory. Elizabeth, glowing beautifully with a small, four month bump, greeted him. “Dr. Holmes! How are you?”
A heavy body landed on top of her. “Stay down, Immy!” Frederick hissed, pushing her forcefully into the floor. “Let the trained Hunters deal with the mutt.”
He could almost hear the collective shock. A sharp bark cut over the line (
Gathering his courage, he opened all channels on his walkie. “Calling all units: We have a Code Moonlight. All units, be on the look out for a large, grey Wolf. Brown eyes, flecks of brown in the fur. Very dangerous - containment is our goal but take him out if necessary. Again:
He watched the dark head nod once before the man squatted again, his nose mere inches from the ground. “What is it, Sherlock?”
John’s proud smile greeted his return, mirroring his own grin around the bunny, his tail wagging slowly. “Snack time?” the older man asked, putting the ball back into his pocket and pulling out a granola bar. “Mind if I join you?”
John, please. Behave yourself.
Sherlock frowns and steps away from John. He begins pacing the kitchen.
AUDREY
Yes. I did. I did tell you to go to Irene.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Oh, I highly doubt that. Our dear sister has you beaten by a mile.
IRENE
(hesitantly)
Let's go get some yummy food, Rosie!
It's not arguing, it's discussing. You are so keen on us discussing all aspects of our relationship, remember?
(not paying attention)
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - THURSDAY - DAY
John takes a break from stroking to run his fingertips lightly along the entire length of Sherlock's erection, making Sherlock shiver.
She sets down the files. She looks up at the ceiling in thought for a moment. She takes out her phone and dials. Someone picks up at the other end.
INT. MEDICAL FACILITY - JOHN'S OFFICE - FRIDAY - AFTERNOON
We know our Cambodian student isn't working alone. She carries out the thefts... but someone else is fencing the stolen art ...  but who? The roommate, you say? None of the missing art pieces have surfaced yet, but it's just a matter of time. Somebody is going be too excited by their new acquisition to keep mum. We'll have a leak by the end of the month, I'm sure.
Sherlock smiles at the text. He writes back: YES
I'm barely... Wow, you really are sensitive.
I don't really want to deal with a toddler tantrum in the middle of this store when she doesn't get a T-O-Y, too, all right? Honestly, Sherlock, do you not know how little kids work?
SHERLOCK
Stay. Please.
Yes, Mrs. H seems to have that effect on everyone.
"I'm on it," she said and made her way swiftly off the plane.
Mycroft Holmes problematic? Who could believe that?
Come along.
Oh pish, Sherlock. Never mind me. Why don't you tell me what's eating you?
Someone lets the L word slip. Who could it be?
John experiments by pressing his finger a smidgen deeper into Sherlock's arse. Then a centimeter more.
AUDREY
(excitedly)
Gregory's intellect is not the problem. Gregory himself is not the problem at all. I am the problem.
(looking behind him)
Sherlock freezes in the doorway with his back to the others. His shoulders sag. John's face goes red with embarrassment, rage, and jealousy. Sherlock straightens up and exits, Irene strides after him confidently, and John follows in a huff.
Rifle from the wall...
Let's go.
(with sincerity)
(with growing concern)
John makes haste to the bathroom to clean up and returns with wash cloths. He gives one to Sherlock, who begins cleaning himself up, and Jon uses the other to sop up the spills on the sheet.
(matter-of-factly)
(sharp alarm)
Audrey joins Mrs. Hudson and they cautiously peek over at the sitting room. The medics are packing up. John and Sherlock sit on the sofa, quietly talking together. Something Sherlock says makes John smile and he leans over and gives Sherlock a peck on the cheek. Sherlock looks very pleased.
SHERLOCK
Lestrade walks over to Nazir and Sherlock with a huge grin. Molly, curious, joins the group.
SHERLOCK
Imagining Sherlock peppering the clerks at the sex shop with a bazillion questions while making his purchases makes me giggle.
Nazir picks up a bottle, ready to change the subject.
(steadily)
(snippy)
John first makes sure there is enough lubricant on the glove. While holding Sherlock's cock with his free hand and bathing it with his tongue, John rubs gentle circles around Sherlock's hole with his gloved hand.
John's kisses have made it to Sherlock's navel.
Rosie emerges from the tent.
"I just couldn't bring myself to look at it every day... or even have it packed away somewhere in my home where I could possibly access it, take it out, and be reminded of you. Of losing you. I just couldn't."
Mycroft laughs sardonically.
MRS HUDSON
(laughing angrily)
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Er, what did they say? If you don't mind sharing, that is.
I didn't realize this was part of the plan.
Sorry?
(with head in hands)
Well. A pleasant evening to you, Audrey.
We both know that at soon as she sees you, she'll latch on and there'll be no way I'll coax her back upstairs. I know she's very attached to you, Sherlock. I don't need a hysterical toddler on my hands when she's perfectly happy at the moment.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
John gives the bell-end of Sherlock's erection a little teasing lick. Sherlock closes his eyes with pleasure.
SHERLOCK
Irene waves at it dismissively.
She breaks for more laughing.
SHERLOCK
(waits for response)
You don't think I go around stripping down, bedding, sucking off, and pleading just ANYONE to let me stick - not one, but two - fingers up their arse, do you John? Please, have some more respect for yourself, and me.
(impatiently)
The clerk bends down and cuffs the jeans for John.
AUDREY
When he doesn't get a response, he walks over to open the door to the landing and calls down the steps.
Not helping, Molly!!
(confused)
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Wow, this is harder to say than I expected.
You barely get along with Audrey.
(yelling)
NAZIR
Humph, yes, an appropriate moniker - "tights." Haven't seen you wearing them before, but I suppose I have seen them buried at the bottom of your dresser drawer.
I know! Both of those were mere serendipity!
Sherlock nods. John reaches over and grabs Sherlock's hand and places it firmly on John's bum. Sherlock sighs happily. John grabs the lubricant and generously oils up both hands. With renewed determination, John returns to the task of working over Sherlock's erection with his mouth and both hands. A few moments later, John comes up for air.
“He escaped a holding cell!” His temper was flaring. “Get to the point - who’s he the diversion for?”
Not waiting for anything, he gathered his brother’s considerable mass into his arms, pressing the wounds into his chest. The action only earned him a whimper. The natural born wolf was fading. “Come on, Sherrinford,” he grunted, sliding out of the car and running, as best he was able under the added awkward weight he had cradled against his chest (and dragged along the sidewalk). “Help! We need a doctor! Get Dr. Watson!”
“Inside,” he replied just as tersely, “Sitting Room on the right. It’s a Lupus Sapiens, Sherlock.”
_ _ _ _ _
His brother carried a heaviness about him that was evident as soon as he opened the front door. He could smell the worry, the rank stench of fear, even as Mycroft’s trained steps carried him through the house and up the stairs.
, he snorted, nose pressed to the ground as he traced the trails made by the maids and housekeeper as they had prepared his room.
. “I’ll get the scent description out to the K13s but I’m not sure if we can do anything about it. The input is great, Sherrinford, but I don’t know what else to use-”
“Mr. Holmes! Mr. Holmes! Care to comment?”
His vestigial tail wagged in his trousers, making him flush a bit, his mind flying to his growing closeness with the army doctor. John knew about the tail, of course. He had seen it a few times as he Shifted. The doctor would be surprised by the knot, unless Sherrinford had told him...He doubted it.
“Not yet,” his youngest sibling insisted, sweeping his rounded wife into his arms. “Molly,” he whispered, inhaling again, “You look stunning.”
She hoped that her back looked as good as her front as she rushed to the kitchen. “Make yourself comfortable,” she called over her shoulder. “I’ll only be a minute.” The water rushed from the tap, filling a tall glass with the cool liquid.
), he slipped into the loo, neatly stacked his clothes, and shifted. It was more comfortable to sleep as a Wolf on the carpet than to curl up on the sofa in his lanky human body. With a quick shake, letting his scent fill the bathroom, he nudged the door open and loped into the sitting room. Taking some time to find a comfy spot on the carpet, he curled up and laid his head on his forepaws, drifting into a dreamless sleep.
She laughed, rolling from bed. “I can cook. Just get the coffee on, please.”
“Ah, here we are boys!” Timothy stated cheerfully, “Everything’s as you left it last, Sherlock.” He paused, his own heterochromic eyes, surrounded by wrinkles, flickered between the pair of them. “Don’t have too much fun, now. Dinner’s at seven.”
SHERLOCK
I don't think that's the case. Here, lift your hips.
Very good.
(rolling over to face John)
SHERLOCK
Got off work early today! I was hoping I'd catch up so I could walk home with all of you. Shall we?
Be patient, for a little bit longer. I think he'll come around.
INT. 221 BAKER STREET - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
John begins strolling down the street, very much lost in thought.
Sherlock nods slowly, deep in contemplation at her words.
After all that, I made a vow to myself to give up dangerous things. My addiction to dangerous things. I needed to do it for Rosie's sake. And for my own. I can't let Rosie become an orphan like Mary was. I can't. I want to be a better parent to her than my own were.
Rosie cries harder. Sherlock hears the door shut upstairs. He stands up and turns off the baby monitor and paces slowly as he waits for John to appear.
(fed up)
VIVIENNE
No, it won't be fine.
John cuts off. His brow furrows as he stares at Sherlock's wrist, indeed feeling Sherlock's elevated pulse. John cautiously peaks up at Sherlock's eyes. Sherlock looks frankly scared to death (in the best possible way). John's gaze settles on Sherlock's lips.
It's something all right. He's a nutter.
Sherlock, in response, closes his eyes and moans with pleasure.
ROSIE
Why, John? It's not a bad smell. I like it. It's musky. Very masculine.
SHERLOCK
John starts to protest but Sherlock talks over him.
What is it Sherlock?
John strokes Sherlock with a bit more pressure, as Sherlock writhes below him.
John has the same expression on his face. Sherlock is like a deer in headlights with his head sticking out of the blanket tent. A cheery alarm sounds on Sherlock's mobile. Both men blink hard to clear their own thoughts and turn to look at the phone on the coffee table.
I don't do casework anymore, as it turns out.
MRS HUDSON
Molly, I am confident that I will single-handedly botch up absolutely everything with John without even trying.
I will.
Do you think you could find time in your busy schedule for your boyfriend, John? Huh? I've barely spent any time with you this week.
Sherlock palms the back of John's head while he closes his eyes to better picture the scene in his head.
(sleepily)
John tilts his head to get a better look at it. He dares to touch it lightly again.
CLERK
(yelling after him)
JOHN (V.O.)
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
IRENE
Touching...
John changes to downward-facing dog (as does Rosie). Sherlock checks out John's arse.
Honestly, SOME people would be delighted by it even. Weren't you just remarking on having a free afternoon together?
SHERLOCK
John collapses on his belly and then rolls to his back. John's penis is standing straight up. Sherlock's eyes pop when he sees it.
"Ah!" Sherlock exclaimed, knowing
Ready?
I know all your habits, John Watson.
MYCROFT
Yep! Just finishing up here, AJ.
(trying again)
SHERLOCK
Oh, absolutely.
John looks up at Sherlock fondly.
Sherlock cuts himself off and looks away, embarrassed. Molly's face darkens.
So sorry, John! Let me help you. Oh dear, did you burn your hand?
Please.
SHERLOCK
(chuckling)
SHERLOCK
(hoarsely)
WHAT?! Sorry, did I not hear correctly? Didn't you just say you wanted to take it slow?
(with a cocked eyebrow, glancing at John's crotch)
Ta da! They're jeans!
John and I are off to the lab. We’ll let you know what we find.
She hurries out of the room, Lestrade and Molly watch her go.
(looking down sadly)
John, permit me to frot against your arse. I would very much enjoy that.
(over monitor, soothingly)
I savor the thought of taking you like this, too.
(muffled by the bedding)
MYCROFT
Oh shit!
It's barely a heart condition.
I wonder if I can find your prostate, John. Let me know when I find it.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
How did he notice before me? I'm a bloody doctor!
The symphony. A night of violin concertos, Mrs. Hudson.
(pause)
INT. 221 BAKER STREET - MRS HUDSON'S KITCHEN - MONDAY
I'll go sleep upstairs. You don't want me here. You asked me to move in to your bedroom, but you clearly don't want me here.
And so, when you and Rosie moved in, I changed it.
Mrs. Hudson?!
Oh good, get in bed.
"John, I ..." but Sherlock found himself lost for words.
(gently admonishing)
SHERLOCK
John nods again, earnestly.
Oh, that's better then...
John's phone rings and he looks quickly at the screen. He stops walking.
