They looked at each other for a moment, and then John nodded. “Okay, but...” “It's good you're here.” Sherlock cut him off again, then turning towards the cinnamon rolls, the lost expression all of sudden swept off his face, replaced by the usual smug grin. “So, Mrs Hudson figured out that I'm alive and you didn't notice? Really, don't you observe anything?”
I watch his mouth close in surprise when Daddy wordlessly lifts him, throws him over his shoulder and carries him outside (to give Mummy and Mycroft a break, no doubt). I follow them. The new ferry I'm standing on is slightly different from the one I remember, but somehow that does not disturb the memory.
There is the promise of a summer day in the early morning air. It will be a beautiful day. The perfect day to arrive at an island in the Northern Sea. But there is more in the air. The promise of a new beginning. The promise of my one and only chance to get myself right again.
So the next month, John talks about the dreams. While he talks, he suddenly feels like he completely misunderstood Sherlock's motives for jumping off the roof. He tries to hold on to that thought, tries to make some sense of it, but fails. Again, he feels like he let Sherlock down, only that this time he does not even understand why.
“John,” he said, keeping his tone as neutral as possible. He felt bad whenever he met the good doctor, whose rage at Mycroft limited their encounters drastically. The apology offered to John in the stranger's room of the Diogenes Club had been heart-felt, even though John had had no way of knowing what Mycroft had been apologizing for that day.
It had not been Sherlock's fault, and that was the most unfair part of it. Because let's face it, Sherlock often did things that had the potential to make John angry, to make John regret the first kiss and everything that grew from it. But not today. Today, it has not been Sherlock's fault, and yet here he was, stomping the streets of London, angry with John, far from being as cold and miserable as he should be.
It is a time of remembering to pull the plug of the bath tub after the experiment so John will not stumble into the bathroom and find the tub filled with pigs' blood again. To Sherlock's surprise it is a time of doing things and avoiding doing things for John's sake.
The meal is good, so is the beer. We are both a bit tipsy when we leave for the little club I researched on the Internet. Going to a club is not what we usually do, but John insisted on dancing and I do not see him in a ballroom.
“Maybe he has changed his mind about me,” my inner Mary giggles. “He went to see me this afternoon, didn't he?” Yes, he did. Spent a few hours with her, pretending (?) that there is a slight chance he might forgive her one day. He objected to it, but went because I told him so.
“We are finished with our examination. You might see him now,” the doctor tells him. He says many other things as well, like John's arteries being all right and his brain being basically all right and that they will have to arrange an appointment for occupational therapy soon to fix the harmless harm done to the brain. But all that really matters to Sherlock and what really makes his heart doing a rather artistic stunt is, “You might see him now”.
Sherlock stared transfixed as John rose, kneeling above him. It was easy to see the way John drank in the sight of him, eyes tracing the edges and outlines of Sherlock’s body.
Sherlock couldn't help his strangled growl.
Sherlock stiffened in mortification. This was--he knew shouldn’t have agreed to sleep here. This had been a terrible fucking idea.
His vambraces, polished steel cushioned by worn leather, shone in the watery light.
For his part, Sherlock endured being dragged round by Irene, from group to group to make introductions. Sherlock made sure he played up his submissive qualities: the cant of his head, the slight tension of his shoulders, only glancing at potential patrons through his lashes briefly. He could feel their gazes like a scrape across his skin, and by the end of the night it would leave him raw and wanting.
“I’d ask you to stay for breakfast, but I’m sure you’ve got more important business to attend to,” Jim drawled as his eyes flitted up over Sherlock’s shoulder.
John shook his head. “I can’t accept this. It’s a family heirloom.”
“Why else did you call?” Sherlock asked instead.
Mycroft nodded once, a perfunctory thing, and rose from his seat. “Good. Please forward any pertinent information you can glean to my assistant.” With that Mycroft slid a thin metal business card case from his interior blazer pocket, produced a card for Sherlock. “Good afternoon.”
Irene went all out for Sherlock’s birthday and debut. She’d rented out a private art gallery, its current works’ theme centred around sensuality and sexuality. Paintings and photos lined the walls, colours rendered in warm flesh-tones of all shades, the curve of bodies slotting together. As a setting for any other sort of party, it would’ve been garish, awkward. But to celebrate a servant of Naamah’s debut in service and society, it was rather brilliant: the setting would serve perfectly to build the tension and desire in the atmosphere that Irene would prefer.
Then a lightning-strike moment of clarity; to some extent, this was a scene. More wonderfully, though, was the truth that with John, they were equals. And John would never deny him that or begrudge it. With a pleased growl, Sherlock rolled over and grabbed onto John’s shoulders, tugging him down for a rough kiss. John’s response was immediate, enthusiastic, as he dropped his weight onto Sherlock, pressing him harder against the rose thorns. Sherlock moaned aloud and wrapped his legs around John: one around his waist, the other hooking behind John’s knee. John rocked against him again until they found a rhythm. Each thrust drove the thorns deeper, until Sherlock was delightfully certain his back would be a mess. It was glorious.
“Christ,” Lestrade groaned. “All right. You two be safe, yeah?”
That question, Moriarty’s coy tone, echoed back from a thousand years ago, a scant two weeks ago.
“Let me get dressed, then we’ll talk.”
John, who’d so recently given Sherlock that same hot-and-cold, open-then-not regard, the one that left Sherlock off-balance and unaccountably fighting to win his untouchable good opinion. The one Sherlock had seen the night Marcus Smith had been shot, that had been wiped from his face the night he’d stood outside Sherlock’s door and listened to him play. The one that got stonewalled away anytime John remembered Sherlock’s service to Naamah, or else his appointment from Kushiel.
“That’s right,” she growled. “I want to watch you squirm. We’d all watch you squirm until you were gagging for it. Until you didn’t give a fuck who took you, so long as you could get it.” With that she grabbed a garter strap and snapped it hard against his still-inflamed thigh.
“We do know how to do our job,” Sally chimed in, the scorn plain in her voice. “You haven’t given us anything we couldn’t have worked out for ourselves quite quickly. Must be nice to be favored without any merit.”
Sherlock blinked, thinking over Lestrade’s text once more.
# # # # #
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “You didn’t put it here?”
This was a death.
The hallway stretched to his left just outside his door, dark save for the one golden swathe where it overlooked the sitting room. Conversation rose from the adjoining dining room; Irene’s guests sounded fairly deep into their cups. John ignored it and made for the bathroom.
Sherlock fought back a frown. Was she nervous?
“You should call the cops,” Billy suggests. “But--not
Per your concerns that you did not defend Mr. Holmes adequately, I ask this: did Cassiel keep Elua completely unscathed? He followed where Elua led in faith. Despite what turmoils they faced, he loved Elua too well to do aught else. He offered his dagger, but Elua
Still, the thought was seductive. It was better to be damned for that than for abandoning Sherlock.
, Sister Liliane had said.
!” comes the litany from the smaller one.
John snorted in irritation. “How long?”
Smith halted mid-swing, and Sherlock jerked up to see, eyes wide enough for John to see the brilliant red speck from where he stood. In that moment John felt that crook around his neck so strong it nearly jerked him forward.
“Care for a drink?” Lestrade dropped his keys onto the counter as he entered his pitifully tiny kitchen. “Juice, water, beer?”
I get that this may not be some people's cup of tea, but I wrote it with the idea in mind that not all of Sherlock's patrons are going to be your standard "whips and chains" types, and that there are many facets to the BDSM community, which does its best to shelter kinks and fetishes as long as they fall under the umbrella of Safe, Sane, and Consensual.
He tried to ignore the sharp bite of disappointment: his damned injury spoiled the mood. The stab of pain and the flare of embarrassment doused every last ember of desire in him. If this was Naamah’s way of slowing John down to make sure he didn’t rush anything tonight, she had a sadistic way of going about it.
John drew in a deep breath and glanced over to his best mate. Summer-thick foliage largely obscured the full moon, but every so often a silvery shaft would pierce the canopy. One such caught Sherlock just then in relief, setting his pale skin aglow, his short black curls shining like spun onyx. Then another step forward, and he was once more obscured by heavy shadow. John looked forward again, just barely able to pick out their path, and that only from years of experience.
So he bit back his grin as he arranged the glass exactly onto its sweat-ring on the paper coaster, pushing it away from the edge of the bar. He nudged Sherlock gently with his elbow.
So he busied himself with an ongoing project, tinkering with known aromas and compounds, attempting to design a pheromone-based cologne based on each of the House flowers. He’d just paused to sketch out an equation to account for the chemical composition, an attempt to work out that key ingredient he lacked, when his mobile buzzed on the table beside him.
Several things to address down here.
John wished he could accept them, wished he could find fulfillment in Elua's gifts the way everyone else did. But no, his master was Cassiel, and Cassiel was jealous of his own.
“Second, you were born adventurous. You’re pants at lying.” Now Sherlock added another creamer pack to the base and slid the top one to balance atop the three.
for coherence by a person unfamiliar with the Kushiel universe, and by
Sherlock watched as he brushed the Appaloosa, as John smiled until his body held a loose grace, none of its familiar coiled tension. He’d stripped his customary Cassiline uniform--the dove-grey suit jacket and darker button-down hung folded over a stall door out of harm’s way--left only in a thin white t-shirt and his trousers. The t-shirt shifted and clung to John’s shoulders, the curve of his back as it dipped inward before being tucked in just above the hips.
“No cab?” John asked, his tone gentler than Sherlock had ever heard it.
Sherlock’s lips should’ve been illegal, in that state--flushed and slightly swollen, parted around his surprise.
Sherlock bit off a laugh, opting instead to pause and consider the best route to cut off their suspect. He swerved down a dark alley. “Thought you’d be glad to be rid of me,” he called over his shoulder.
John’s eyes burned, and he wasn’t sure if it was from fatigue or the emotional hornet’s nest in his head. He sniffed once, forced a smile for no one as he rounded a corner, turning onto the avenue that carried him toward a destination he hadn’t quite discerned.
Many thanks to
Sherlock merely nodded, a minute dip of the chin. “What was her name, Mr. Ames? Any information you have--it may be quite important.”
John had only met the man once before, on his last visit to
Lestrade leaned in, eyes locked on Sherlock’s, and drew in a deep nasal breath, scenting him like a bloodhound.
John trailed along in silence through the winding stone corridors, registering none of his surroundings until at last she led him into what he could only guess were her private quarters.
In any event, this seemed far more sentimental than Sherlock was typically prone to. This--this was dangerous. This was tempting a fate John wasn’t sure he was ready to face.
# # # # #
Sherlock beamed.
He let his free hand splay against the wood of Sherlock’s door, let his eyes droop closed while he let himself imagine he wasn’t there, that he wasn’t torn between his god and his heart.
“When?”
So what could he do? He built the story of this goddess he imagined: a bright and beautiful son, struck down by a jealous god, his mother mourned him eternally.
"Don't, don't. Save your manners for your clients. I can appreciate that you're as ready to see it as I'm ready to show you, darling."
“This is
“You’ve got half the Violent Crimes division wanting to get a piece of you--and we would. We’d get you back for every insult, every pompous, jackarsed thing you’ve ever done to us.” Then her voice slipped into a growl, strangely masculine and brusque. “We’d gang up on you.”
“I always forget how tight this thing is,” John huffs, his voice still rough with desire. “Almost as tight as your arse.”
Sherlock offers the weight and warmth of pressing shoulder to shoulder in a late-night diner, all angles and the subtle scent of cedar and lavender. Sherlock offers John the chance to grasp at small smiles crooked in the corners of his own mouth, unaccustomed.
Even the way he handled Sherlock now was distant, nearly robotic. His touch was clinical, his attention divided.
. I nearly turned her away.”
He pushed away the memory of the dream of Sherlock bound in golden chains, of sweat-damp bedsheets twisted in his fist, the hitch in his chest as he listened through the shared wall of their bedrooms--
Only Elua knew, and his laughter had fallen silent.
Six months before his debut nearly a full year ago.
“I wonder what your
The hotel, of course, was the brand of stupidly posh that left even Sherlock--a Belgravian resident and plaything of the wealthy besides--feeling uncomfortable, conspicuous.
Sherlock made a thoughtful noise at that. “
THEY HAD LET him hold her, for just a little while. He held her as tight as he could, her still frame little more than the heft of a bag of sugar. The muscles of his throat clenched around broken glass and he didn’t breathe, he’s certain, the entire time. His eyes burned; the salt of tears and the brine of the ocean are maybe not so different.
John cannot breathe, he does not know how, not when the August air is so thick with heat and water vapour, not when the summer sun collects the breeze and holds it for ransom. As much as he
“This is--”
Sherlock pulled away, rolling his eyes. The sentimentality was embarrassing. “I don’t have time for this.”
“Yes?”
John returned it, laying a hand on his and giving it a squeeze.
“I believe so,” John answered.
Occasionally you'll see
“What is this?” John asked, the sudden foolish feeling that his brain was tricking him--
Sherlock had deduced--?
“You certainly don’t mean to stay here, then, do you? Either way their lives are on your head. So the choice remains--will you stay here in the back of beyond and
Felippa shook her head. “No. In and out. Only you.”
She twitched her head in assent, as if the whole thing were a bother to her. But he saw the way her body went a touch more rigid, even slouched against the doorframe. He’d done well.
He seemed to say at every pass.
He did, and discovered that the food, whatever it had been,
. I will tell Apollinaire. We will stop anyone, if you need it. Just for coming to us you are a precious gift.”
John felt his resolve crumbling viscerally, a dam somewhere in his middle buckling against the strain of floodwaters, Naamah's temptation and Elua's joyous laughter.
The man who joined her was tall, whipcord thin but trim for it, dressed in a bespoke suit that did him all sorts of favours. His curly hair made him appear ten years younger than his baritone voice betrayed him to be, but he looked sheepish for all that, shy in a way no servant of Naamah would ever be. Not even, as John understood, the false modesty of Alyssum House.
I reach for John's hand again, and he presses it. He is getting weaker, I can feel that from his grip. I look at him and this time, I try to really see him too. He is tired, dark circles forming underneath his eyes. Must be in pain. (And for some reason concerned about me.) His eyes are slightly out of focus again. He needs rest.
And this is too much. Because I am missing the violin violently. Because I still hear the sound of the wind rushing by outside the cabin. Because I barely slept since the crash. Because John is still full of happiness and joy of life while I fail to be content. Tears are running down Rosie's face, and that does not mean that much for they also rolled down when she did not get another helping of apple crumble but they hurt me anyway.
John just stares again.  “I’m going to take a wild guess here, but are you a friend of Sherlock Holmes?”
Sherlock frowns, but he is too full of questions to focus on his arm any longer. “Where do you come from?” Sherlock asks eagerly. “How come you’re under a magic spell? Did you meet a witch? Do witches exist? Where do you find them?”
“You could sit at the other table if you want,” John says. “You don’t want to get sick.”
John turns around and he’s there before Sherlock can realize what’s happening. Sherlock’s breath is coming in short, high gasps now, and he distantly realizes he may be having a panic attack. John’s hands are on his shoulders again, and Sherlock closes his eyes, savoring the contact, memorizing it, letting it drift through the open windows of his mind palace and taint every memory and thought inside because nothing in there is as important as John’s hands on his shoulders right now.
“We’re here,” Sherlock says. He’s scowling, and he glares at the house up ahead as if it’s personally wronged him somehow.
Greg takes a seat on a small raised area of the roof, his shoulders hunched in a little bit because of the cold, and grins up at John. “Now that you’ve decided not to fight me, why don’t we sit and I’ll tell you?” he says. He gestures for John to sit near him, so John goes, a half smile on his face. He sits, but leaves a safe distance between them.
John is relieved to see a small smile form on Sherlock’s face. His eyes just barely crinkle, but it’s a start, and John can’t help but smile in return.
“It’s nice to meet you,” Mary says, still smiling. “I’ve heard so much about you from John.”
“That’s a no, then,” John muses. “How’s takeaway? Will you eat Indian? We can order from Bombay. You love their garlic naan.”
Later on, lying in the grass together in what has now become
, you git. I don’t have to get to the bottom of every secret anyone’s ever had,” John says. The words could be harsh, but they don’t feel that way, and Sherlock can’t help but smile.
Sherlock laughs.  “Always so easy to rile up,” he comments.
Mycroft is staring at Mary with a strange expression of disgust on his face.  He steps forward, shoving between John and Sherlock, and stands directly in front of her, meeting her eyes for a moment.
The spirit turns toward John with its wide grin and winks before opening its mouth around the top of the girl’s head. It floats down her body, its wormlike shape surrounding her for a moment, before it disappears, dissolving into her body. John swallows down bile rising in his throat and watches, but nothing changes. The girl looks paler than before, but otherwise, she doesn’t seem to have noticed. “Let’s go home,” she tells her friends, her voice shaky, and John turns and hurries down Baker Street until he’s reached 221B. He pounds on the knocker until Mrs. Hudson opens the door.
; more than any case, any mystery,
“Mary,” Sherlock says. He can’t help it. “You – you’re-”
“Darling, it’s just impossible. It’s like saying two plus two is three. It’s just not true,” she says.
“Good on you,” Billy says.  “Go on, then, open it.”
winces at the ineffectiveness of it, a questioning lilt in his voice rendering the words insincere.
job, one that pays in money and not wishes, and so he goes to an interview the next day for a part time position at a clinic. Frankly, he’s overqualified for the job, but he’ll take what he can get. He doesn’t really want to commit to a full time job, anyway, not with his strange side work with Sherlock.
“On three, we jump in,” Sherlock says. When John nods, he counts. “One, two, three!”
“Get the glasses down?” John asks, looking up at him with an easy smile as he puts the corkscrew into a bottle of wine.
“Of course it was,” John says.  His hand is shaking on Sherlock’s shirt, but he can’t bring himself to let go.
“You’re very lucky, John,” he says. “I haven’t seen Lestrade in ages.”
John’s pulse hasn’t stopped racing since he entered this flat, and his hand, the same hand that had felt the calm of the door to this strange place only moments and yet lifetimes earlier, twitches at his side. He blinks rapidly, staring at Sherlock in confusion.
Sherlock hesitates, then gives a clipped nod, his eyes trained somewhere to the left of John. “Yes,” he says. He sounds defensive.
and opens the door, and pulls Sherlock inside with him, ushering him over to the bench.
“Alright. Let me know,” she says, standing up and gathering the remains of her lunch. “See you later, John!”
Sherlock looks up at him with a hesitant smile, and then looks away, a flush of embarrassment on his cheeks, before turning back and clearing his throat. “When you made your wish, you wished for me to remain at your side until I am grey and old and I die of natural causes.”
“Thank you, John, I’ll endeavor to remember such important information,” Sherlock says dryly. He’s begun impatiently pacing while he waits for John. “Now fulfill your little ritual and pour your coffee and drink it and tell me what happened already.” He waves a flippant hand through the air and occasionally glances at John in impatience.
“Yeah, alright,” John says, resigned, and Redbeard cranes up to peck his cheek with an appreciative kiss. “I’m quite used to him by now, anyway.”
John shrugs. “Don’t have anyone to owl,” he says.
“I’ve never met a witch,” John says. “But I heard there are lots of them in the south woods near my castle.”
The music is soft and soothing. He hasn’t heard anything like it before, but it’s beautiful. He takes another sip of his tea, and then sets the cup on the table beside the couch.
that you were put on earth for me.” Sherlock swallows, and John feels sweat on his palms, feels his heart beating faster. “But I saw your loneliness, and I saw how little you cared to live. I saw you come to me, just like you did a few months ago, but it was different. You walked away from me, from my shop, and it was like the very fabric of the universe ripped. You were – you were different from anyone who had ever walked this earth, John, but you didn’t know it. You left and you gave up, and I had to change that. I couldn’t risk you not understanding how important you are, but I couldn’t grant my own wish, and I was desperate – once I saw you, I knew I couldn’t let anything happen to you. I needed you to live, so I came to Moriarty. He’s the only one who could grant my wish.”
Redbeard is curled around his neck, his little furry body warm and dry. He hadn’t been with John on the roof, but John can’t remember pulling him off before he went or picking him up afterward. John’s window is locked, and he can’t remember coming back inside and locking it. He’d call meeting Greg a dream since he clearly hasn’t left his bed, and yet, there is a small pouch of cigarettes in his hand that had been given to him by one Greg Lestrade, who he can remember as clearly as anyone else he’s met in his life, and not in the hazy way he usually remembers figures from his dreams. He stares at the cigarettes in wonder, and then hears the sounds of Sherlock rummaging around downstairs.
,” Sherlock says vehemently. “Yes, I can fix it. Of course I can. Your magic is… it’s warm, John, it’s very warm, like the sun, and it’s gold. It’s beautiful. It’s - ” He pauses, startled; he hadn’t meant to say that. He clears his throat, uncomfortable, feeling redness creeping into his neck. He doesn't dare look at John. “The curse on your leg is tarnishing your magic, keeping you from using it to your full potential, and obviously affecting your leg. It’s from a Death Eater, right? I can’t think of anyone else who’d use such a dark curse.”
“You have something to inquire about,” the man says. His eyes are sharp, focusing in on John’s own like lasers.
He sees his gran, and observes that she has a pocketful of sweets, and thinks he will have to get to her before Mycroft. He looks around eagerly, enchanted by the warmth of the fairy lights on their tall Christmas tree and the many wreaths and sconces around the ballroom. The hors d’oeuvres are out already, and Sherlock eyes the display with excitement, eager to eat all of the special Christmas food. He continues scanning the room in search of one particular person, but his favorite guest, Uncle Augustus, has not yet arrived.
“John, are you alright?” Mary asks as he’s leaving, looking at him quizzically. The spirit turns towards Mary. It approaches her but then seems to quiver in disgust, its mouth closing and twisting, before rapidly going back to John again, coming even closer and causing John’s body to shudder.
Sherlock blinks, freezing and looking up at John, feeling caught out.
John’s breathing fast, and he groans, deep and guttural, as his hand picks up speed. Sherlock feels sparks deep in his stomach, feels restlessness in his legs, feels his toes start to curl in pleasure. “John,” he says, breathing hitched, feeling desperate. “Don’t – oh god, don’t stop.” He doesn’t recognize his own voice, doesn’t recognize the needy way his hips twist with the movement of John’s hands, doesn’t recognize the strange feeling coursing through his veins.
Sherlock keeps moving his fingers, keeps letting the lights swirl. “I’ve always thought so, too,” he says.
Arthur puts his hand on John’s arm. “I’m sorry,” he says. “It must have been hard growing up without parents. But you know, John, for what it’s worth, I would have been proud to call you my son.”
Sherlock’s eyes focus somewhere to the left of John and his brow furrows as he retreats into his mind palace for a moment, images of John and Mary coming forward quickly. He’s scanning through them for a moment, but he knows he’s missing something obvious. He frowns, rewinding his memories, replaying slowly, focusing on what matters: John. He watches John smile at Mary, watches the slow upturn of his mouth, watches the lines in his face map out something akin to happiness, watches the almost bashful smile he’d never seen directed at himself, watches the restrained smiles, and his frown deepens.
job, right?...Yeah, I know, no problem. Yeah, see you later, Sally. Can’t wait.”
“I’d love to,” John says whole-heartedly, his eyes locked with the little fox’s. The little fox’s face flushes once more, and to John’s surprise, he rushes forward and gives John a hug, which John barely returns with one arm before the fox-boy pulls away, looking shy again, his tail twitching.
“But you had no soul,” John says.  “How is that okay?”
“Hey,” John says after a moment. Sherlock feels the rumble of his voice against his own chest and it’s heavenly.
“John, are you feeling okay?”
“Because I saw an
The door to 221C is unlocked, and the lights are on as he opens the door. It’s the same organized chaos of mysterious items that he remembers from the first time he was down here, the time he’d found Billy. It seems like years ago now, and the time before Sherlock is like a hazy memory, indistinct and unimportant, though in reality, it’s only about a month or so prior.
“It will open for you,” Sherlock says. He must be drunk, he knows, because surely there’s no other reason he’d do something like this. “All you have to say is
“When I say so, you have to grab onto the handle,” Sherlock tells John, pointing towards the lantern-like object on the table. “You absolutely
, John thinks, moisture leaking from his eyes as he pushes forward towards 221B. Trying to get there is like running against a river’s current, and his shirt is soaked with sweat. He moves ahead nonetheless, finally reaching the door, slamming his hand against it and panting with relief as the spirit disappears.
“Interesting,” Mycroft says, and then Sherlock scowls again, glaring at Mycroft and crossing his arms over his chest.
“Right, it’s not so dull for the rest of us, though, who have to pay bills and make a living. Anyway, I got a job
say them, a Gryffindor, an Auror, a Healer, makes Sherlock’s heart clench, makes him feel
John turns away and coughs wetly into his hand. He can’t stop coughing, and it comes faster and faster, so much that he can barely breathe. He gasps to get air, but his lungs feel constricted, and Arthur’s hand is hovering over his shoulder, ready to help, when someone else speaks, voice sharp with authority.
Mary ignores this and continues speaking, leaning forward a bit. “You want to be there whenever there’s a chance John and I will be alone together outside of work, and yet you told John he can’t invite me to your flat. Why is that? Wouldn’t it be easier for me to just visit you, since the two of you live in the same place? Why can’t I come to your flat?”
“And what are we thinking about this morning?” John asks. There is an amused glint in her eyes, and Sherlock flushes.
Sherlock smiles a small, fleeting smile. “I thought I would die,” he says.
section is hushed and tender, and he thinks of John’s hands and John’s smile and John’s body pressed against his as the final note drifts into the quiet of 221B and dissolves into the air, into the fabric of their life together, until the note has disappeared and the quiet of the flat is all that’s left – but this time, it’s the quiet of a promise fulfilled, of new promises waiting.
Sherlock blinks, realizes he’s made John angry. “Oh,” he says. “that was – ”
John sighs, scrubbing a hand over his face in frustration. “Then what is it? I mean, I’m sleeping right now, aren’t I?”
Sherlock nods.  “Yes.  Actually, if you don’t mind, your hair ribbons would be perfect.”
Anticipating the pain helped little to block it out. John felt it running up his entire arm like fire, his stomach revolting against the immense amount of pain hormones rushing though his body. He heard a cry, far away and high pitched and wondered if it had been his. He gasped for air when the pain subsided a little, leaving his finger throbbing. It felt like Moran had broken all three phalanges at once.
The fifth day is nearly identical. I have breakfast. Calculate the bricks in the wall and delete the result. Have lunch. Forecast the weather. Do my workout. Take a shower. Mycroft shows up again. He brings along a Reversi gameboard. We play ten matches. I lose every single time. He leaves. I have dinner. Go to bed. Lie awake until a restless sleep overpowers me. I don't speak a single word, not even in my nightmare.
Sherlock takes a deep breath that somehow gets caught in his chest. He tries again and is slightly annoyed when he fails to breathe out properly.
# # # # #
The next day Sherlock headed for Naamah’s temple first thing, a live dove in a small wicker cage as his offering. Naamah’s priestess stood him before the great stone statue of the goddess, kind and sensual, lips parted in joy and enticing welcome.
Sherlock thought.
His stomach knotted and lurched, and his head, his body--he retched, but nothing came up.
That did
John’s heart was in his throat, suddenly. Could he possibly make his way through it without Sherlock realising just how much truth was about to be behind every word and gesture?
, the murky waters of the Venetian Lagoon lapped at the docks, echoing loudly off the stone walls, scattering the reflection of hastily-installed halogen work-lamps. Sherlock breathed a silent prayer that the stairwell itself was still shrouded in shadow, allowing them to creep down the worn granite steps as silently as they could.
“What the--” John broke off, and then he looked up at Sherlock in surprise. “It’s from Elua’s oak, isn’t it?”
AT THE END of summer, they are curled on the sofa, a movie offering light and noise after a particularly memory-laden day. For the first time in longer than he cares to recall, John does not crave the comfort of a body tangled with his, because it is now a need sated--it is surprising, however, to find this is the case when he wakes the next morning, limbs slotted between Sherlock’s. He’s just shy of falling off the narrow sofa, which clearly was not built for two grown men.
Ill-suppressed excitement had him clasping the appraiser’s hand harder than normal, but it was easily forgivable.
“I’ve still got you for another few hours--and I know exactly how I want to spend it.”
“You, sir, you!” Sherlock almost hated himself for saying it. Hated himself for its being true. It felt like a little betrayal to Lestrade, whom he'd always regard with just a bit of tenderness for being Sherlock's first.
Then the blade pricked a taut nipple and Sherlock bucked so hard he swayed on the chain above, utterly helpless. The flechette whispered against Sherlock’s skin, obscenely sharp, parting it so cleanly Sherlock nearly didn’t feel it.
“Is that it?” John asks, his breath erratic, and Sherlock can tell he’s getting close; he can nearly hear the grind in John’s brain. “I think you can do better than that. I spoil you, don’t I? I take such good care of you like this.”
Sherlock nodded, eyes as bloodshot as John’s own were. John could feel the sting that only abated when he blinked. His muscles were jittery putty, that odd feeling that only happened when he and Sherlock pulled all-nighters for a case. It was nigh unto time for them to get back to the hotel and just crash.
(See the end of the chapter for
The night could not possibly pass quickly enough.
“Shut up and let’s go,” Sherlock snapped, and it got his desired effect.
He understood the jealousy that flared in him. This was a blunt acknowledgement of Sherlock’s experience, of the pleasure Sherlock had taken with others. Still, the knowledge hit him so hard he that he was sure it wasn’t physically possible to be more aroused. He ignored the near-overwhelming urge to conquer and claim, to erase any memory of lovers who’d come before. Fighting the temptation to ruin the game with hasty action was monumental.
after all.
The night grew later, winding from dancing and revelry to the pageant of costumes, and Sherlock took in none of it. He didn’t take in the Eglantine actress costumed as the Old Crone, hobbling forward in rags, propped on her gnarled cane, as she made her way to the dais at the front of the great-hall; he only barely registered the Gentian horologist crying out the seconds, declaring the new hour and the new day, another Eglantine actor dressed as the Sun King entering from the side of the room and bending to kiss the Old Crone. Sherlock knew but didn’t observe, as the Old Crone straightened, a victorious call as she cast off her rags and the mask of age to reveal a young maiden. The beautiful symbolism of a year’s darkness giving way to light was completely lost on him.
I climb up the stairs that take me to the passenger's deck, and a younger version of myself is following, several steps ahead of the rest of the family. He is excited and restless from the long journey, hyperactive and absolutely unable to hold still. Not older than five. His mouth does not stop from babbling, he is bopping up and down while asking one thousand things in a row.
When I am finally done crying (after one hour and thirty-eight minutes), he continues to hold me while I tell him about how it felt to kill (terrible, heart-wrenching, destructive), how I am scared to lose my mind in solitary confinement, how my mind palace betrays me, how much I love him, how I am scared for him and the baby now that he has to face Mary without me, how I do not know what will happen to me and how I missed him. The only thing I do not tell him is that Serbia is really a death sentence, not an escape.
(He had, I would find out much later, but that night I could not tell.)
One day they are standing at a crime scene. Inside a lift. Sherlock is highly claustrophobic, but that is nobody's business and he has never told anyone. Nobody has ever found it out, not even Mycroft.
“Remember, I'm only your trainee who is here to take photos of the excruciating crime scene, so you have to approach the Commissario first. And the longer you can keep him talking, the more time I'll have to do the real investigation,” Sherlock whispered into his ear as they approached the man. As if they hadn't talked about it twice already. He went past Sherlock to introduce them without bothering to answer that.
He nods, more to himself than to me. His voice is soft when he says, “It is too late, Sherlock. I am married. There is a baby on its way. It … it would be WRONG.”
After resigned John who arrived on Amrum yesterday, exhausted John who spent the first evening with me and mean John from this morning, this is the fourth version of him that I have to deal with.
John does not move.
She finds me when I managed to find a quiet spot (in the kitchenette after chasing away two minions by loudly deducing their pitiful sex life). (Her timing surely no coincidence.) Tells me how glad she is that I am allowed to stay in London (for now). Touches my arm to feign sympathy. Pretends to be happy for John and me.
Sherlock needs to rewrite his mental street maps of London. Too many changes, too many new construction sites. While he remodels his mental map, he passes almost every important street on feet. He knows it will take time. Lots of time. If there is a road to rapid recovery, it must be the opposite of the roads he is taking.
“The remover will be here soon,” he goes on and my head snaps up. I cannot help but stare at him. Removers? What do we need removers for? How long is he going to stay away?
Halfway through their first day together they end up having the most awkward conversation about dating John has ever been through.
“And what about point 7? Or 9? Those only show that he is not taking it serious at all,” she continues, and John looks at points 7 and 9 again, even though he already knows them by heart. They still make him giggle, probably not the best thing to do while fighting with your soon-to-be ex-fiancé.
So when I am sure that I will not last much longer I finally give her what she wants. “Stop,” I say, my voice hoarse, “Please stop.”
It has been a lovely spray pattern, by the way. Had I not been there to witness it, I could have told exactly where she had been standing and how close the gun had been and what kind of gun it had been just by looking at the pattern of blood and brain mass on my book shelf.
I don't want to. I want to tell him to stop being that serious. I want to tell him that everything will be all right eventually. I want to hold him and kiss away whatever it is that he intends to tell me now. But I can't and so I simply sit down next to him.
Sometimes Sherlock seems to forget that John exists.
I try to remain motionless, eyes still closed. Best not give away that I am conscious again. I hear only one other person breathing. John? I listen to the rhythm of the breathing for a while. Regular, not in pain, but not relaxed either. Controlled. Definitely John.
I am longing for him to be all right so he can be the reasonable one again.
Tonight's nightmare finds me standing on a well-kept (very English) lawn. The sky above me is blue, the sun shining, birds singing in the trees, the temperature just right. A perfect day. In front of me a tomb stone. I know that I should not look at it, should rather walk away, for as long as do not look at it is not real. But I look, and I read (“John H. Watson” it says, and below “GraceNotEmilia Watson”), and for a moment I forget that it is a dream.
I am so grateful for all the readers, comments, kudos, subscriptions and bookmarks. You guys are brilliant. <3
“Are you sure?” my inner Mary wonders, and so do I.
Something in John's eyes has changed after the call, but I cannot concentrate on that right now. Need to think of Janine and Yasmin, both involved in Mary's imprisonment. Have John text them warnings. Trust Janine to take care of Yasmin. Who else needs to be protected? My parents have been spared. Mary missed the opportunity to kill them (pain in my stomach is back at that thought) when they entered the garden.
When he finally accepted that his brother wouldn't go away any time soon, he sat back in his chair again.
There is no way to put Emmi down or hand her over without making her cry so the two of us stay together until she falls asleep in my arms way too late. In the meantime my parents have put up the travel cot Daddy had brought along, unpacked Emmi's clothes and nappies, gone to the supermarket to buy baby food and built a corner for her to play in the living room.
Then it came back, more exciting now. Sherlock tried hard to understand him but failed. So many defeats. It was exhausting and frustrating, and Sherlock tried to slip back into unconsciousness, but John's voice did not let him go. It was tearing at his mind, holding him in its grip, not allowing him to fade away again.
Usually John was very careful not to look at Sherlock like that. Was that one reason why Sherlock was hit so completely by surprise?
(eyes out of focus for a second, pulse increasing, this is not just about power, but about affection and grief)
“Already called for one, dear,” she answered, and only a little flutter gave away that her feelings were in turmoil, “Using the special number your brother once gave me.”
One day, he gets a surprising email from John. He quickly identifies it as a goodbye letter, as suggested in every better mourning guidebook. It is written without deep feelings, just to please the reader. That being Mary, apparently, not Sherlock. Normally, thinking of Mary leaves Sherlock cantankerous.
He smirks at my erection and grabs my balls. Mirrors what inner Mary did to me once, on the rooftop, but this time it fills me with pleasure and pain and ecstasy. “No cuddling this time, pretty boy,” he hisses into my ear and kisses me again. Then, while one of his hands is still holding a streak of my curls, the other moves down my throat to my chest and pinches one of my nipples. Hard.
Obviously they are bound to return to America, and once they are over the ocean they will be out of Sherlock's reach, for Mycroft's relations to the Oval Office are a bit tense momentarily.
John keeps stroking my hair while I tell him. Then he thinks. Then he strokes my cheek. “Why don't you visit Baker Street in your mind palace tomorrow?” he suggests finally. “That way, Inner Mycroft will see that you are not visiting his grave at all.”
I can feel my cheeks burning with anger. Tell myself to stay calm. Tell myself that it will not happen anyway because John has asked Mycroft to have her arrested right after giving birth. Tell myself that Mary will not be able to take away the baby. Remind myself that I need to breathe.
Sherlock considers taking one of John's jumpers with him once the time comes. Or a pair of his red pants.
He throws a tantrum when they try to separate us and only calms down again when we are placed inside the same ambulance. They will bring us to a nearby hospital to take care of our wounds. No need to stay for long, they say, maybe just one night to be sure.
I only sleep for a short while. I am pressed against John, and Emmi's occasional stirring crawls into my subconsciousness every once in a while. Never realised how much the two of them ground me. How could I have slept without them for so long? (Poorly.)
I am so lost in thoughts that I don't realize that Janine and I are alone in the kitchen all of sudden. She gives me a piercing glance I try to ignore (without success). “Oh Sherl,” she says then, patting my back happily (which gets really annoying), “you and John? Finally!” She gives me a conspiratorial grin and another pat on my cheek. “I mean, really, there is nothing wrong with a little marginal shag with someone else's husband now and then, is there?”
John giggled, the feeling of joy intensifying when he noticed the happy gleam in Sherlock's eyes. They both had missed each other’s company badly.
The door is opened by Rosie who is bouncing around like a mad rubber ball. She is happy to see us, and excited to find the present we brought her, and reluctant to leave because she knows there will be no more chocolate for the rest of the day, and eager to go home with us because she misses all the books she left at home, and hates to come to a stop to put on her shoes, and does not want to put on her jacket, and does not know where Doggy is but she cannot leave without him of course, and wants to know if we missed her, and finally collapses into the children's seat drenched in sweat, singing nursery rhymes for Daddy and me.
It is still perfect when Magnussen explains his chain of pressure points.
I never had a dog. There was nobody left to turn to for peace in my mind palace.
Above the empty chair in front of him there was a black-and-white photograph.
There is so much love in his eyes that it breaks my heart just a little more. He is mourning his son, and Emilia's existence makes me empathise with him far more than I ever thought possible. I think I should say something, but can't find the words.
“So” I sum her case up, “you received texts and letters from your dead brother and want me to ...”
The doctor gives us a half-hearted smile. “Your wife and daughter are both all right, Dr. Watson,” she says (and wilfully ignores us holding hands). “The mid-wife will bring the baby to you as soon as she is cleaned.”
When Sherlock opened his mouth again, most likely to keep discussing the topic, John quickly went on, “There is no way I will forgive her. Do you know what she did to you?”
At working place four there is Elisabeth J. Farnsworth. Congress member with criminal family background kept secret and a few side tracks herself. Should the content of the Blue Book become known, her political career would be over within the second. (That at least I have known before.)
Sherlock excelled and even found himself enjoying his tutelage under Irene’s thumb. Aside from covering
She may have been barely five feet tall, but Helen Belfours filled up a room. She didn’t need to speak: her body language sang at full volume. Each movement, each gesture and expression exemplified her poise, her superiority in any given situation. She was sturdy, her petite frame all angles and curves, with thick brown hair swept back into a braid that fell like a cable between her shoulders. Softeness framed her face but her eyes gave away the lie--eagle-eyed and sharp, Helen Belfours seduced with sweetness before she sank in her claws.
Sherlock didn’t waste a single moment breathing a sigh of relief, he merely took off down the hall once more.
He clutched at Sherlock’s hips, drawing him minutely closer. “So what do you think of my acting skills now, hm?” He thrust, just barely, against Sherlock. Pulled that full, pink bottom lip between his teeth. Loosed a small growl from the back of his throat. “Been perfecting the act, all this time.”
Sherlock took his hand. “If you’re sure.”
The next few days dragged on in a haze of frustration, both at being unable to speak lest he lose this bet, and a constant simmer of sexual frustration he was sure he hadn’t had to endure since the age of seventeen.
“After your Dad agreed to bring you Emmi, I thought I would do it any day now.” (He does not have to say the word. I know what he is talking about.) “I was waiting for the perfect day, you know.” He is shaking a bit but soldiers on. There is no place for retreat now.
Two glasses of red wine have appeared on the table in the living room, and a fire has been lit. The whole room is emanating an air of cosiness and warmth.
I wonder if I should mention that I will give them all Christmas presents. The advantage would be that I could make clear that I am not expecting some in return. That way, they will be able to concentrate on being happy with their presents on Christmas Day and won't have to wonder if I am feeling sad (which I won't but all three of them wonder about stuff like that.)
I deduce (of course) that he is angry because to him it seems like I dealt with the aftermath of the cellar a lot better than him.
Was it unrequited?
“That is how you handle things these days, isn't it?” Mycroft states. (I almost forgot how arrogant he could be.)
"Really?" I ask and she looks at me with surprised delight.
And they fall so easily, never knowing who hit them. Sherlock is all confident and clever, cocking a snook at Moriarty's people.
(John, definitely worrying, enough time to take a look at it, if intruder would have means of opening the hotel door he would be inside already, John is more important than any intruder)
I'm finished in the kitchen. Listen to the noises. Still no need to hurry. As I go to the stairs, I look at the bookshelf again. I spent a week trying to clean it properly. Had to take out each and every book. Made three staples, spared, cleanable, waste. The last one the highest. Remember his face when walking around the staples to sit in his chair. He had tried to be brave for ten days, but failed.
Sherlock nods, but doesn’t move. “Your leg?” He manages once he feels a bit more composed, his voice quiet and muffled against John’s shirt.
“He did,” John said. “I usually eat lunch with Mary; she works at the clinic, too. We have staggered lunches there so we’re not all gone at once, and Mary and I are always on the same schedule. She must’ve been lonely eating by herself.”
“It’s a form of fortune-telling, in a way. Similar to palm reading, if you need something you’ve heard of to compare it to. However, it’s infinitely more accurate, if you know what you’re looking for,” Sherlock says. He reaches beside him and picks up his pipe, taking a long drag.
John crouches down beside him, ignoring his shoulder, and takes the water. Carefully, slowly, he pours it into the urn, watching as the moonlight reflects off of it, sending prisms of light into the air.
, to feel John tremble against him, to feel their skin sliding together. He feels completely incapable of controlling his voice or his body; his hips move of their own volition, he moans over and over, he curls himself around John and gets as close as he can get until he’s coming fast and hard beneath John, dissolving into nothing but a melted pile of skin and bones and
When John is aware of himself again, Sherlock’s fingers are still circled around his wrists, and he almost chokes until Sherlock tightens his grip. John opens his eyes and realizes he’s underwater, staring across from himself at Sherlock, who is grinning as air bubbles drift out his nose.
John frowns. “You – what do you mean, you can’t leave this flat?”
“Of course not,” John repeats, and then laughs. Sherlock can’t help but laugh with him.
“Stop that,” John says gently as he realizes why Sherlock seems concerned. “Does it look like I have any second thoughts?”
Sherlock frowns and feels his magic around him, and he swirls his hand and finds that sharp tug that he knows makes the confetti come, but he tugs a little harder this time, and this time, the confetti glitters in the air, drifts down towards the kitchen table, and stays, sinking into everyone’s breakfast. Sherlock’s lip wobbles and he winces when Mummy hastily charms his confetti away, her magic skittering over his skin and leaving goosebumps in its wake.
,” Sherlock retorts.
“Sherlock,” John says. He stares, clears his throat. Breathes through his nose. “Sherlock,” he says again. His voice is rough. “I’m not good at-” He stops abruptly and takes a deep breath.
“A different
Sherlock turns to John with a smile, his vehemence gone for the moment. “In a way,” he says. “But I also believe in the significance of each moment in this world, and its ability to change what we think must be.”
wish for more.”
Sherlock smiles wickedly and shifts until she’s straddling John. She leans down and kisses her, soft, warm, sweet, full of promise. She strokes her fingers along John’s jaw, presses a tender kiss to the corner of her mouth. “Let me show you,” she says. “You can’t be expected to deduce
Sherlock swallows. The sound is loud in the quiet bedroom, and John presses another soft, chaste kiss against his lips, strokes his cheek, lets their noses brush together. He thinks of the moonlight dancing over Sherlock’s face, of Sherlock smoking his pipe, of Sherlock’s pinky pressed against his around the handle of a lantern.
He goes to his computer and scrolls through his music library. He can’t believe he’s doing this. This can’t be right. And yet, with trembling fingers, he selects a Strauss waltz. He winces at the loud opening chords and shakes his head, quickly turning it off; it won’t do.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “I’m busy,” he says.
“Now put your hands on the urn,” Sherlock says.
“They did,” the girl says.  “They were here before I got here.  You know them.  You’ve met them.”
“No? Hmm,” Sherlock says. “Either way, you went to the trouble of inviting me here today, knowing full well I’d show up regardless. So what
Sherlock’s heart skips a beat at the thought of next time. He can already feel his cock stirring even though he’s only just come, and he trails his fingers up and down John’s spine, imagining all the different things they can do together.
“Right, obviously,” he says, eyes crinkling in the corners. “And why did we come here? Don’t get me wrong; I’m happy to ruin my clothes in a pond, but I
“Yes,” Sherlock says. His voice is choked. “I did.”
Mycroft shakes his head. “No,” he says. “If you go out the front door,
John frowns.  “Right.  Thanks.  Bye, Molly,” he says.  He hangs up and replaces Sherlock’s phone in his pocket.  “She says I have to go to Baker Street,” he tells Mycroft and Billy.
John comes back on a drizzly afternoon. The lackluster rain is unremarkable, as are the grey skies and predictable traffic patterns. To Sherlock, though, it's a day unlike any other: 221B is brimming with promise once more, filled with potential and warmth and something fragile that makes his pulse quicken and his stomach flutter if he allows himself to focus on it for too long.
“You’re upset,” she says.  Her lip quivers.
“It’s beautiful,” John says, eyes wide. “Is this lantern from that tree? It looks the same.”
It suddenly hits John exactly how close to death he’d been, and he covers his hands with his face, Sherlock’s hand falling uselessly from his forearm. He doesn't understand how it happened, doesn’t understand how he got taken in so far. He feels stupid and weak and vulnerable.
“You’re pissed, too,” Sherlock manages, still reveling in the lingering heat where John’s hand had been.
John grins. “I guess it is rarer than I’d like to admit,” he concedes.
John arches a brow.  “And you know him, how?”
When he doesn’t continue, John smiles, a small smile that makes his eyes crinkle and his face turn up brightly towards Sherlock even though signs of anxiety show through in the tightness around his mouth and shoulders. “Yes, me,” he says lightly. He sounds amused despite these signs, and he hasn’t let go of Sherlock’s hand. “And you,” he adds.
The woman says something else, and then Sherlock looks surprised.  He’s paying attention to her now, and he looks calculating for a moment.
“I’m glad he gave him back,” John says. “Was he just living in that pipe in the meantime?” he asks, frowning at the thought.
“She’s fine,” he says, wary of the topic of Mary considering the way Sherlock seems to dislike her. “She went to Brighton for her birthday.”
Sherlock smiles, and John is surprised by its sincerity. “You’ll see,” he says. He seems excited, though it’s clear he’s trying not to show it by the stiffness in his shoulders and the way his mouth keeps reverting to straight line then twitching into a grin. “Actually, it used to belong to me when I was a child.”
to get him back. Please, Zosima. I know how to kill Moriarty. I just have to find him.”
“Honestly,” Sherlock says, looking away from John to glare at Mrs. Hudson. “If you’re just going to provide useless commentary, you can go downstairs.”
Sherlock feels warm and safe and loved and there’s a fluttering deep in his stomach.  He wants to touch, to taste, to feel, to devour; he wants so much, but he doesn’t know where to start.  He starts small: he lets his thumb swoop a little bit higher, just brushing the tip of John’s nipple, hardened in the cool morning air.  John shivers, and Sherlock feels his cock harden and he presses another kiss to John’s chest, shifting his hips, letting John feel him.
“Right,” John says after he’s swallowed the coffee and allowed himself to savor it for a moment. “I went up to the roof. I was wearing my pajamas,
“Mm,” Sherlock says.
“Right,” John says. He clears his throat, squeezes Sherlock’s shoulders. He doesn’t meet Sherlock’s eyes, just gives him a quick once-over, as if to reassure himself that Sherlock is there and whole and safe. He gives Sherlock’s shoulders an awkward pat and then lets his hands fall inelegantly by his side. “You – you’ve nothing to say, then?” John asks. He’s hesitant, unsure, and Sherlock doesn’t know how to respond.
Redbeard looks at him and makes some fast, frantic squeaking sounds, and John holds his hand closer to his face, and when Redbeard leans in and presses a kiss against his cheek, John closes his eyes and is surprised by how nice it feels.
“I can
“Why not?” John asks gently.
John frowns, his brow furrowing. He swallows the food in his mouth and stares at Sherlock, sure he heard that wrong. “Sorry – what?”
“Mary,” Sherlock intones, his face remaining perfectly polite.
“Waited,” John says.
John’s heart flutters. “No,” he murmurs. “
” Sherlock shudders, and when John starts sliding his fingers up and down the back of his head again, he mirrors the movement with his hand, slow and torturous, his breath shaky. When John plays with the curls on the crown of his head, Sherlock swipes his thumb over the head of his cock, moaning as the moisture spreads, his hips bucking up of their own volition as his knees spread open.
Sherlock doesn’t understand. Something is changing, but he can’t bear to let himself hope. He clears his throat. “John, I –”
He’s so focused on her that the world around them ceases to exist, something that often happens when he concentrates so fully, but this time, he’s made aware of it by a sound that has him blinking and coming back to reality to look up and see John.
As soon as he steps onto the roof, though, he stops short. Goosebumps break out over his skin and his eyes widen when he sees that a gray-haired man is standing on his roof smoking a cigarette, staring out over the London night sky as if there’s nothing unusual about his presence on a stranger’s roof. The man turns and seems just as startled to see John as John is to see him, and he hastily tosses his cigarette down, putting it out with the toe of his shoe.
His blush must have deepened, because Ames's eyes widened a fraction in realisation. "Wait, are you--is this to do with your anguisset business?"
At one point, Irene led him to a group by a small bust of a man in orgasm. A tall, blonde man with a strong jaw ignored him, while a softer-set short brunet man with glasses and a blonde woman with what could only be described as a “sweet” face greeted them.
. It became a mantra.
“Sherlock get back in here,” Lestrade called as he came from behind his desk. “You don’t have to--”
“What is this?” he murmured.
Sherlock took the head of her strap-on into his mouth, lavishing it just as thoroughly as any cock he’d had the pleasure of tasting. Simultaneously he slipped his second and third fingers deep into her until he found the soft tissue of her g-spot. He picked up a rhythm, then, bobbing on her cock as he swirled his fingers in relentless circles, until her grunts and cries lost form and coherency, until her back arched and her clawed fingers scrabbled for any sort of hold. Then Sherlock pulled back.
“Hello?” It was a brittle creak. No one would hear him.
Sherlock merely huffed in mild amusement. "Thank you for your time, Mr. Ames."
Irene waved her hand dismissively, though she spared a glance for Sherlock. “If my student doesn’t mind, neither do I.”
Where I stop and I turn
But the noise that came after was worse. Sherlock moaned, a deep and needy sound that twisted John’s stomach even more.
“Now please, please, have your wicked way with me.”
Sherlock jerked his head up, now completely awake. “Where?”
In his entire time in the Cassiline brotherhood, from the age of sixteen ‘til now, John Watson had never come so close to insubordination. Considering he was nearly twenty-six, that was certainly an accomplishment.
Mycroft was trying--maybe poorly, but trying nonetheless--to be kind.
“Please, please--”
He felt naked as he stood before them, leaning heavily on his cane. He’d come in a simple suit, darker grey than the Cassiline wont, sans vambraces or weapons. Those rested on the table, right between Brother Rocaille and Brother Vincent.
Pause.
“Brother Watson?”
to be a cursory hearing to keep the accountability channels open. This is how we’re permitted to keep our arms when we’re outside these temple walls.”
He stepped in quickly, not looking back to an ever-silent John who would stand watch just outside.
Then John glanced up, back to Lestrade. “We’re going to go home now. You know where to find us.”
Alone in his room Sherlock tossed the packet on his cluttered desk, ready to sit and analyze, just as soon as he’d procured some coffee. But fatigue got the better of him as he turned once more for the door, each blink heavier. Waxing strain from staying up all night--and the waning second or fifth wind--dragged him like a millstone now that he was alone in the stillness of his bedroom.
Sherlock retreated and John only barely kept from slamming the door shut. It was a text from Lestrade, and shortly thereafter another from Sherlock.
A chime sounded in her pocket as her mobile slipped free to clatter against the gravel. The screen was bright, the preview of its incoming message plain.
“You poor bastard,” Cecily murmured, interrupting his thoughts. “You’re his pet, aren’t you?”
# # # # #
out of you. I will be your
“One last thing before we move on to the auction. As it is also Sherlock’s birthday, as well as his debut , I felt it only appropriate to present him with a gift tonight that will hopefully be of great use to him in the months to come. Mike, did you--? Oh, lovely. Come on up, then.”
“No!” she shouted. “No, please!”
“So you’ll not come banging down my door, expecting me to risk my job, just because we’ve fucked?” Lestrade asked, and this time his tone was gentler, milder than it had been all night.
Sally’s face went bright red, the fury in her eyes unmistakable. “Sherlock--”
It wasn’t much longer before Burgess’s resolve broke.
“You might want to sit this one out, Mrs. Hudson,” John explained. “It’s a bit of a hike, and I’d hate for you to make your hip worse.”
Luca’s face softened, slipped free of its clinical mask.
They elbowed past civilians, some of whom tried to stop them. Sherlock was fairly certain he broke one larger man’s nose in their escape.
Irene, of course, understood the problem immediately and tried her best to soothe: “You really should pick
“So--fuck--so close,” Sherlock keens, and that is when John leans forward, pushing Sherlock once more back onto hands and knees, never once losing his rhythm. He picks up pace, relentless.
Many apologies for the delay. I've been sitting on this chapter for like a week, but life has been a handful. Anyhow, I do want to give you all a heads-up: I will have to slow down chapter updates for a little while--I've got a few projects coming up that have nasty deadlines. Hopefully I can get back on track in a month or so, but I'm hoping to do at least one update a week. Cross your fingers for me, loves. <3 <3
She took his elbow, her pleased smile better-suited to a schoolgirl. Surely this young woman couldn’t be much older,
“Fine,” she answered. “Just wait until you’ve healed, at least?”
Sherlock stopped, and John let himself be studied, for once. His mirth was infectious, because Sherlock bit his lip to hide a smile. His expression became a pantomime of disapproval. “A man did just die, you know.”
Kushiel’s bronze drums thundered in Sherlock’s ears, deafening him. With grim satisfaction he knew in his bones, his lord was not done with him yet. Not when Jim Moriarty had sent him what had to be an opening move in a brand new game of chess.
When she plunged into the darkness of the cellar’s storage space, John managed to stay just close enough that he could catch the door before it slammed shut, delay it only slightly as he stepped in and to the side, behind a still-assembled Christmas tree, which could’ve easily been six feet or more across, such was its size.
The stranger in grey stepped into the well-lit corner Irene and Sherlock used as their stage, and his face was devoid of the anger Sherlock had seen only moments before. In its place was a bland, polite smile, all deep blue eyes and kind laugh-lines in a face not much older than his own. Dishwater-blond hair, compact shoulders, body held in parade position--
Jim looked over to Irene. “Care if I test him? In intellect only, of course.”
“Shut it,” John said mildly. “I may not be a doctor, but I’m not an idiot. Just let me make sure whatever’s under there doesn’t need tending to.”
Sherlock gave himself a moment to study Apollinaire, curious and carved of shadow. “Yes,” he said eventually, the truth of his words borne in his tone. “Sometimes.”
Jim pushed the mask up roughly, claiming Sherlock with a kiss that felt more like a conquest--fingers knotted harsh in hair, teeth on lips until Sherlock tasted copper.
His breath caught because of the knowledge banked in her gaze, an assessment of his person with the weight and wisdom of her priestesshood, and it made the blood beat in his ears like the rumble of a distant drum.
“The ID on the body is Sebastian Wilkes,” Lestrade offered. “Investment banker from Shad Sanderson. We’re preparing the body to haul back to the morgue for an autopsy and dental record for confirmation.”
the first streaks of grey tinged the London sky, blending with the light pollution so subtly it took looking away and looking back to recognise it.
