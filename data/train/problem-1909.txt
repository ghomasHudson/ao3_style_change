Of course, it wasn't entirely desolate; there were about thirty or so students gathered in a disorganised circle, and in the circle was the tri-wizard cup - its bright blue flame just visible above the crowd of heads. Every so often a student stepped forward, and everyone else would applaud, the loudest cheers being from the student's own school. But the benches had been moved to some place else, giving him an uneasy sense of unfamiliarity. Oddly it was this sight which suddenly induced a jolt of nerves in John.
“It’s true! I’ve been eating so many biscuits lately, and I don’t have rugby practice anymore. It’s a nightmare.”
"Not necessarily." Moriarty looked over at each of the two students. "Rather a coincidence, isn't it? Moran. Morstan. Moriarty. Not that Morstan is her real name. Very complicated business."
“I understand, dear,” Mrs Hudson says soothingly, before raising her voice into baby speak as she addresses Rosie. “Don’t worry. Rosie and I will have a wonderful time. Girls’ night in. We might watch a few Connie Prince reruns together, isn’t that right, lovely?”
"Please, Sherlock," Tiana pleaded, "it's my grandmother's. It's been passed down my family for ages. She'd kill me if she knew I lost it."
John grins, his eyes bright. “Thank you.” He kneels up to kiss Sherlock quickly, grateful and reassuring. "I get that you're nervous, you know. It's a big deal."
A few minutes into his walk he encountered an Acromantula - just a young one, but still much bigger than John, with eight pitch black eyes and pincers readily poised - which he got rid of very easily with an Arania Eximai. Then for a while there was nothing, except a sudden thickness in the air as he turned left, then right, then came to a dead end, and had to turn back. He soon came to realised that he was completely and utterly lost, as no matter where he turned, the hedges suddenly closed off and he was trapped. He got his wand out and was about to say "point me", only for it to suddenly fly out of his hand. He looked over and there was Moran, holding it in his fingertips, a face of cold, hard stone. John sighed.
He opened his eyes with a start, and came to realise he was back in his common room, lying on his bed, flat on his back, the room dark and silent, albeit the gentle snoring of boys next to him and Sherlock's heavy breathing. He looked over at the clock next to him: 11 pm.
“Yup. Just waiter-ing here at the moment - it’s my dad’s business, you see. He’s the only one who seems to be willing to hire someone with a criminal record.” Angelo said lightly. “Anyway, what is it you fellas will be ordering?”
"Really?" John couldn't help his surprise, even though he knew for a fact that he had memorised and followed every instruction word-for-word.
"Oh yes. I have no idea what it is though. Something like a - tournament? With two other schools. I don't know. Dull."
Sherlock stood and turned, his neck to hairline red, probably from the blood rush. Between them stood Sherlock's dribbling cock, the head red and swollen. John stroked his cock, bringing it back to attention. "When we get home we'll have a proper fuck and I will suck that pretty cock of yours, but now is not the time nor place."
John smiled victoriously, sweat beading on his forehead as he increased his tempo and, Sherlock meeting him thrust for thrust and making unintelligible sounds.
John ran his mouth up Sherlock's spine. "Of course I did. I wouldn't lie to you just to get you out of your pants."
He sounded it. Not the type of angry that led to screaming and violence, but the dark, seething type of anger that built up overtime. His voice was quiet.
John felt his cock dribble just from Sherlock's response alone. "You're going to make me soil your sheets. Do you think you're ready?"
John pulled out of Sherlock, eliciting a moan from him, and scooted around Sherlock. He set the lid down to the toilet and sat down (for he hadn't taken off his trousers, only unzipped them.) Sherlock immediately straddled John, waiting for John's signal.
Just when he thought he couldn't take any more his nose bumped Sherlock's scrotum. Thank God, he thought, eyes streaming as he fought his gag reflex.
"You. Have. Me. So. Fucking. Hard. I. Want. To. Fuck. You. So. Fucking. Bad," John breathed into his ear, thrusting his cock against Sherlock's with every word.
Sherlock grinned lazily. "There's an open karaoke at a bar tomorrow night and a suspect is going to be there. In order to get a good look around, I'll need to get onstage. The theme tomorrow is 1990s American Alternative, which is ridiculous, but can't be helped. Nine Inch Nails is a famous alternative band from the nineties and Closer is one of their more famous songs, so the bar will most likely have it on file."
Sherlock Holmes: Ah, it's a political affair. I see. I guess medieval England wasn't very female-friendly.
"Want you to rip off your clothes and jack off. Better yet, I'll rip off your clothes and jack you off. Or, I could give you a prostate orgasm?"
"I would turn away, but it only takes a split second of unsupervision," I affirmed. Half of me wondered why I was being so bloody stubborn about this, but the other half knew perfectly well why.
Amazingly quickly, Sherlock was pressing his lips to John’s. They stumbled backward into an open door which Sherlock closed by kicking. The feeling of Sherlock’s trousers against his bare cock was making him remember his former arousal, and John deepened the kiss. His tongue traced Sherlock’s lower lip, who opened his mouth eagerly to receive him.
John Watson: What? I don't even turn it on! How can you hear the from my room if I haven't turned it on for months?
Then both hands were fumbling with the lube again, and he was pumping the dildo with his hand, getting it nice and wet so it could make an easier entrance. Without hesitation he plunged it into himself and his cock twitched, a small sigh escaping his lips as he pressed the button to turn on the vibrator.
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: Yes it does, I find it interesting. I wonder what type Mr Moriarty is...
John exhaled out his nose as way of a laugh, pushing the rest of his first finger in. Sherlock's mouth opened and his fingers gripped the sheets, but he stayed impressively silent.
Sherlock Holmes: And I'm a world famous consulting detective. You're not the only big shot around here. Did you try rebooting the hydrogen board before you reset the magnetic compensate?
His mouth opened silently, face screwed up as he twisted his wrist again, plunging the toy in and out of himself. He cried out, his legs stiffening as he held it deep inside himself. Obviously he'd found his prostate, and then his hand was flying over his cock, making an obscene sound really, skin on skin and wet, his hand was a blur as his hips lifted off the bed once, twice-
“What- now?” John asked, irritated by his hammering heart and growing arousal. HE LIKED BOOBS, DAMN IT.
Sherlock Holmes: My machine is my brain. Far more impressive, if you ask me. Most of the cases I've solved are government secrets, so I can't give any examples, but I can say I saved Britain from kneeling to a particularly powerful dominatrix.
After staring at me for several seconds, Sherlock smirked, slow and sexy and promising. His tongue dipped out and moistened his Cupid's bow lips, gracefully sinking to his knees.
"He can't leave his dorm. It's going to be okay, though." Molly gave a weak smile. John wasn't sure whether he believed it.
For a moment, John sees an image of Mary as a young girl in primary school, blonde and happy and innocent, before she became whatever she ended up becoming. Or perhaps she was the bully of the playground, willing to shove (or shoot, for that matter) whoever was standing between her and her goals. He's almost tempted to ask her, 'do they have specialist assassin primary schools where you grew up?' but he decides that pissing off a heavily pregnant woman who is trained to handle firearms is a bad idea. Besides, he's meant to have forgiven her, hasn't he? The problems of her past, et cetera, et cetera -
When they got back to the flat and John had made both of them tea, Sherlock immediately sat him down in his chair then retreated to his own. He crossed one leg over the other and steepled his hands over his lips, deep in thought as he stared at John, blue gaze intense. John shuffled awkwardly in his seat, suddenly very sympathetic to clients who had previously sat in this very spot, scrutinised and observed, nothing kept hidden.
"What good have they done since?!The man who stabbed my boyfriend and killed my brother is still at large. They're not even looking for him!" Sherlock shot back, his voice cracking. John's forehead creased in concern and he took Sherlock's hand, stroking his thumb over the back of it. Sherlock took a deep breath to steady himself. "My mental capacities match his, so I should be the one to find him."
For a while they sat in an awkward silence - what would they have to talk about after a separated holidays? Normally, John and Sherlock would talk about... anything, really: cases, experiments, science, school, his deductions. But it perhaps it was the added element of Mary listening making it hard for John to come up with something, anything, to talk about. And then there was the issue of Sherlock and Mary both being, in a way, the Third wheel. Each of them seemed to separate the other from John - Mary being the girlfriend he had essentially spent the last few months with the most, Sherlock being his best-friend-slash-subject-of-mild-unwanted-romantic-feelings. The carriage rattled on noisily, as though it too wanted to fill in the hiatus
“I’m insulted. I’m the world’s only consulting detective, I am the first to perfect observation into an exact science, I have made various important inventions and discoveries in the field of chemical forensics, and I have a bloody mind palace! I think I can name a simple film.”
Flitwick went through a list of 100 students: from 'Abyss, Michael' (ravenclaw- Sherlock didn't respond as enthusiastically as his fellow housemates when the boy sat down at their table), to 'Gregson, Violet' (Hufflepuff), to 'Williams, Daniel,' (slytherin). Eventually the list ended and Professor Mcgonagall - a woman of around eighty- stood up. The noise dimmed.
“She’ll come round eventually.” John retracted his hand. “I’m going to have a shower, try and clean all this soot off me. I’ll leave the door unlocked if you feel like joining me."
“I’m serious. You’re no use to anyone dead. Besides, I doubt you want our reunion to be with you in a body bag, do you?”
He rings Sherlock, who picks it up even at this hour of the  morning. John wonders if he slept at all after the events of last night. “John?”
"But it's not the same killer, right? It's a different person doing the act, same person telling them to do it."
"Yeah. We all say stuff we don't mean when we're drunk. So I just wanted to say that, if it's okay with you, we're okay, still."
"Ssh, it's fine, John," he placates calmly. "I used Lila Madison's phone. My phone number is on the website. I wouldn't want the murderer recognising it."
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: I thought he only kept files on people of use or interest to him?
"Well, what do you think about when you're getting off?" John asked exasperatedly. This was much more of a production than he'd expected.
Sherlock glanced down at his still prominent (and bare) arousal. "I'm up for anything at the moment. I think rational conversation is off the table at the moment."
Sherlock Holmes: I'm from London. 221B Baker Street, to be exact. If you ever find yourself in a rough situation, call on me.
Sherlock was sitting on the couch, looking intensely at John. "So, I know you walked in on me this morning."
Sherlock perched himself on the edge of his bed, flipping the end of his belt out of his trouser loop. "Of course that's the logical assumption. I just got out of the hospital after suffering a self-induced- and may I add again ACCIDENTAL- drug overdose and you're unwilling to let me leave your sight. So, when I request in a moment that you leave my room for nineteen minutes and forty-two seconds, I am reaffirming the fact that I am not going to 'finish the job' and off myself, rather, perform my bi-weekly check and tune up."
I cleared my throat, cock stirring. This was going to be harder than I anticipated. I tried to remind myself that he was mentally unwell, but deep down I knew that this afternoon wasn't really a suicide attempt, just a mistake on his part that had serious repercussions.
Sherlock nodded his understanding, not trusting his suddenly dry mouth. Yesterday had been different, more frantic and raw. They hadn't even bothered to turn on the lights, so it had been rather dark. For a moment Sherlock feared that upon taking off his pants, John would laugh and tell him the whole thing was some big joke. The thought made him queasy so he pushed it away quickly.
He pressed the button again and Sherlock actually let out a growl, thumb pausing against the girl's lip.
"How'd I do? I felt as though I was a little sloppy, I'll need to practice relaxing my gag reflex, and I think my teeth got in the way a few times. Also, I didn't know what to do with my tongue-"
After about five minutes of his gentle, thorough kneading, his hands went to his navel and rested. "No signs of cancer," Sherlock reported, slightly breathless. His impossibly grey eyes met mine; his pupils were dilated. Not that I needed any more proof that he was aroused; his cock was half-hard and he hadn't even touched it.
Sherlock set two steaming cups of coffee down on the kitchen table and sat, indicating for John to do the same. "I suppose we should. It was rather a big deal."
John was nearly positive that he was joking, but it was hard to tell over text, and especially with his professor… well, it was hard to tell if Holmes was yanking your chain while having a face to face conversation with him (or rather his face to a hundred of his students’ faces.) Just before John could reply with something equally biting, the elevator came and opened.
"Ah- what?" I asked, even though it didn't matter because he had taken my testicles into his mouth and Jesus, he was good at this, had he ever done it before?
Sherlock Holmes: Oh, one of THOSE types. *hic* Don't accept themselves so they can't hear about themselves from others.
John was immediately lead up a flight of stairs and into the living room of 221B Baker Street. Holmes passed through the room and the kitchen quickly, hardly giving John a chance to look around.
Sherlock moaned, relaxing his sphincter. John hummed appreciatively and teased his tongue in and out of Sherlock.
"Why would I have condoms?" Sherlock replied, panting. He'd have to see how long he could go without breathing while kissing sometime. Without John knowing, of course.
I didn't get a name for the first girl (she seemed offended by my comment lol) but the Barista can be found on Tumblr under the username snugglingsherlock.
a troll: Well the only thing I believe to be idiotic and tasteless is your "job" that you speak of. Sorry to hear that this is how you view the world, but I guess you won't see the other side of it. That's alright though. You do you.
John looked up in amazement at his professor. “That’s… wow. That’s extremely kind of you, sir.” He took the pen from Holmes and scribbled a few lines for his signature, holding out the pen for him to take back.
After several minutes of this, John pulled back and sighed as if he had just finished a particularly delicious meal. "Your arsehole is so pretty, Sherlock. Especially after I've been fucking it," John said, voice dark and promising.
"Yes," Sherlock replied, surprised by how steady his voice was, considering the hand on his (extremely erect) cock.
Once again, he ran his finger around Sherlock's arsehole. This time it only twitched, but stayed relaxed. John made a sound of approval.
Sherlock Holmes: True. That was extremely enlightening, my experience with him. I'm exceedingly glad he's dead.
John licked a stripe up Sherlock's aching cock, getting a whimper out of the detective that John could feel in his stomach. Slowly, he wrapped his lips around Sherlock's head and sucked once, tasting his salty precum. Jesus, he was big. Not as thick as John was, but a solid 9 inches at least. Slowly, hoping he'd retained some of his military days expertise, he took in Sherlock's cock.
The sound that Sherlock made was enough to make the tip of John's cock weep. Something between a moan and a cry, entirely unwarranted but not unwelcome.
Very, very slowly, his third finger slid into Sherlock. He took in a sharp breath and held it until his face was red, finally puffing it out.
Hiro Hamada: *Huffs, crossing arms and pouting* jerk. Still bet I'm smarter than you. One thing I've got going for me, my head.
Next he put some on his fingers and pet Sherlock's tight arsehole, bringing an almost inhuman moan out of the detective. John stuck his first and middle finger into Sherlock and groaned. "You're so tight, love. Are you sure you're ready?"
"Not your fingers," Sherlock finally managed, sweat beading on his forehead. He uselessly thrust his hips into the air, looking for friction for his straining cock.
Sherlock took in a quick, sharp breath, watching John hungrily. John crawled up onto the bed, leaning down and kissing Sherlock's neck.
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: Hah...Well, I assure you, I am a person of no interest. I'm sure you would say I'm ordinary.
Sherlock Holmes: I just talked to one Regina George, who was in highschool, and she needed my assistance.
For some reason this made John shudder. He’d talked to the Forensics major before, sure, they shared the same class… but something about him made him uneasy and rather frightened, actually. “I know what you mean. Excuse me-” John shuffled around the thin man, noting his tight grey shirt and jeans. Obviously he was trying to impress someone by his appearance. He stepped into the elevator, beyond relieved when the doors closed. He closed his eyes as his pulse slowed into a more steady rhythm.
Sherlock's mouth fell open into an 'O' and his eyes squeezed shut as he came suddenly and violently, great spurts splattering his stomach and chest. He clenched around John's cock, his insides spasming from the pleasure.
"You wouldn't shut up. It was the first thing that came into my head that would both keep you quiet and convey what I have to say. Effective, don't you think?" Sherlock grinned boyishly.
"Wow. Okay, then," He giggles. "Is this my life now? Breaking the law and catching thieves while doing it?"
"No. I'd like it." John's smile widened. Then he continued walking again, "but I hope I have more of a role than just publicity."
"When you said there was a space we could see the stage, I didn't realise you meant a fucking sauna," John hisses.
At this point, he has no reason to continue the conversation with this mysterious stranger; he is at work, after all, with a duty to be professional (though he supposed that went out of the window when he tortured him into saying the name of the drink out loud). Besides, he knew nothing about the man that could possibly be a conversation starter, except his loathing of poor jokes. John exchanges the Espresso Yourself for money, and that's where he expects the conversation to end that evening.
Now for the Hogwarts' champion. Sherlock's breath hitches in his lungs and his fingers drummed anxiously on the table. He glanced over at John, and he was fidgeting with his fingers and biting his bottom lip. Sherlock wanted to place his hand on John's, comfort him, the way Mary would in this situation. Unfortunately the unwritten rules of Acting Around Platonic Straight Friends dictated that this was not allowed.
Sherlock speaks finally, having put down his gun on the table next to him. Open, ready for negotiation. Vulnerable. "Mary, it's not too late, you know. If you're still concerned about your safety, Mycroft can easily arrange a safe house for you and security for your daughter. Moriarty won't be able to lay a finger on you."
"Fine," Sherlock sighed, standing. "Perhaps we'll meet again," Sherlock said to the girl and turned to John. "After you, John."
John stood suddenly, face flaming. "I'm not putting up with this! I let you do whatever you want all the time. Fingers in the microwave, hearts in the sink- remember the time you put a penis in the coffee pot? I'm so patient with you! Not this time."
"Such a good little pet... begging for my cock... taking it like a slut," John groaned, continuing to fuck Sherlock's arsehole.
Sherlock took a step closer to John, shutting and locking the door behind him and pinning John against the door. He leaned in close to John’s ear. “Because that’s why you came here, John. You want me to fuck you. You’re already hardening just from my voice. Can you imagine what it will feel like when I’m pounding your tight little ass? Because I can. And fuck, it feels good.”
Despite my best efforts, my jeans were getting a bit uncomfortable, and my cheeks were a shade pinker than usual. He hadn't even started yet and I was achingly hard; harder than the detective, at any rate.
John admired his work for a moment, eyes steely. His gaze lingered at some places longer than others- his dribbling, straining cock, for example- which only made Sherlock harder. God, he didn't care if he couldn't cum, he needed John to touch him.
Without another word, John popped his prick into his mouth like a lolly, bobbing on just the tip. Swirling his head in his mouth, enjoying Sherlock's moans.
Barista:*laughs harder* Oh lord, I'm sorry that was too funny. But if he is asking for more love and respect you should give it to him. Take him out for a date, buy him flowers, when you guys have sex next time, make it all about him
Holmes’ smile widened. “Yes, a medical doctor. I think it would suit you better. You seemed to excel in the blood typing and autopsy parts of my class.” He stepped closer and closer to John, seemingly unaware of how uncomfortable he was.
"Fuck, that was good," Sherlock moaned, locking gazes with John once again. "Come on, John. Let me see you cum. I want to lick you clean."
Sherlock licked a stripe up my shaft with his hot, wet, wicked tongue, swirling around my swollen head. "Tell me. What do you want?"
“Nothing on the website. And Hopkins is convinced that the suicides are in fact ‘suicides’. Says she doesn’t need my help.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. "I don't know how much you think you know about me, but I'm not the type of person who goes on blind dates to dances."
"Yes, so do I. I could actually get some sleep whenever Lestrade came round." Sherlock waited for the blush to appear on Mycroft's face, but he remained as calm and stoic as ever. "Why are you here, if you're not going to lecture me?"
“It’s Valentine’s day, by the way. I’ve pulled out all the stops - fancy restaurant, card, pair of earrings as a gift. Expensive ones, too. You would have criticised them but they’re actually quite nice. I think. But the reason I’m telling you this is that I think that things are actually getting serious between us. Long term.
"Me too. But I don't think that will happen any time soon." Sherlock wrote his own address on Janine's hand. "I'm sorry you didn't get a chance to win the tournament fairly. A joint win is hardly anyone's ideal scenario."
"Did you know?" Sherlock demanded, staring daggers at his brother. "Did you know his family would be there?"
"And if I hadn't helped my sister she may have ended up worse off than she is now. And I can't bring myself to regret the army."
Sherlock got out his phone and showed it to John. On it read a message John barely remembered sending.
"Well, anyone can say stuff about planets. Go on. How many stars are there? What are they made of? Why do planets go around the sun?" Mr Watson says this with a fierce intensity in his eyes, like a challenge. John watches Sherlock, hoping that whatever answer he gives is one that will satisfy Mr Watson.
Several months later, after Sherlock returns (surprise!), after John and Mary get married, after Sherlock nearly dies (yet again), John finally realises this, and even then, Sherlock hands this vital information to him on a silver platter.
However, British weather being British weather, the climate in uncooperative with Sherlock's plan, and it is chucking it down with rain by the time he arrives at the station. His hair is wet and his curls are plastered to his forehead, his clothes are uncomfortably damp, and his coat and umbrella remain in the cupboard under the stairs.
“Seriously?” Sherlock says finally. “You think it’s ‘good’? You couldn’t even stand it when I put my toenail experiment in the bath.”
Last weekend I went to visit my great aunt and. It was truly awful. As one of the younger cousins, I'm constantly given unwanted attention, bombarded with questions about school and whether I've made any friends yet. She was asking me constantly about you. And kept referring to you as 'she' even when I corrected her. She may still be in denial that she could possibly have a gay great nephew (even though I did tell her a year ago.) Oh, looking back, I realise I neglected to mention this, only that I've never had a boyfriend or girlfriend. I hear that it's important to tell friends these things, but I don't know why. Is it important? You told me (after I deduced it) that you're bisexual, so maybe it is.
First of all, I would like to point out that I am not being dramatic at all. A broken bone is very serious and you still talk about how irritating and inconvenient it is, which proves my point exactly. I am a rational, logical person. I do not do 'dramatic', and I am very offended that you would suggest otherwise, John whatever-your-middle-name-is Watson.
“Yeah. That bullet did a lot of damage to your respiratory system. Incapacitated you for months.” John swallows down his guilt rising in him like nausea, taking a steadying breath as he avoids Sherlock’s gaze. “God, the more I think about it, the more I think… how could I have ever gone back? Even for a little while?”
After being briefed on the (private!) flight over, John now walks down the streets of Salzburg, seeking out the hotel that Sherlock is staying him. He should be nervous; after all, he’s potentially facing a dangerous assassin and as well as that, Sherlock’s wrath when he finds out that he is here - and yet he feels confident, bordering on cocky. He can feel it in his stride, in his posture, in the determined, set look on his face. In fact, with the weight of the gun in his jacket inner pocket and the speaker in his ear, he can’t help but feel a little bit like James Bond. More than that, he feels like a soldier again. Granted, instead of wearing a suitably tailored tux or a neatly kept uniform, he’s still in cheap jeans from Primark and a plaid shirt that still have traces of baby saliva on them after hugging Rosie goodbye at Harry’s doorstep. Even so, a surge of confidence and adrenaline rise through him as he powers through the streets, each one more rough-looking and unfriendly than the last.
They finally get up the stairs into their flat, where Sherlock deposits John onto the sofa, who hisses through his teeth as he sits down. “Trousers off. You’re bleeding through them,” he orders, then turns towards the bathroom to get the emergency medical kit. Bandages, antiseptics, painkillers, all present. Would John need stitches? Unlikely, but then again, he was stabbed.
should.” He may not care much for such a trivial idea, but the man is clearly riled up enough by the insinuation to take a chance.
Sherlock scowls, his bottom lip protruding into a pout but pours some more whiskey into his glass and takes a swig. “It doesn’t even count. It was for the Magnussen case.”
John: Wow. I knew the day would come where you would disown me, but I never thought it would be so soon…
"Not interested." Mary said firmly. "I'm sorry, sir, but no matter what you insist, I do not miss that life."
"With my tenant, Sherlock Holmes. At 221b," she explains, reassuring him that he is at the right building.
"I know." Mary whispered back quickly, before the music started and the dance begun. It was a waltz, played by a live orchestra made up of students and some teachers. John knew, without a doubt, that Sherlock could easily play this tune. "Elementary" he would call this piece. In fact, the only reason Sherlock wasn't currently playing was simply because Sherlock did not work with others. Apart from John. So Sherlock would not play in an orchestra, unless it was an orchestra entirely made up of Johns - clones of himself playing every instrument. What a laughable idea.
Sherlock stands up on legs that ache from being sat down for too long and makes his way into John's hospital room. He's asleep, his chest rising and falling steadily, the heart monitor gently beeping beside him, slow and, paradoxically, comforting and terrifying.
“Now that that’s over and done with,” Irene glares, “we can finally move on to the actual reading of the script. Now, this is to just give you a chance to get a feel for the words and the style. You don’t need acting or drama - “
I hope you’ve been well. It’s been a while since I last heard about what’s been happening in your life, so when you reply please make it about that. Make it interesting. Your letters are always a suitable distraction from everything else.
He watches the plane take off with a hollow weight in his stomach and a lump in his throat. Six months, he reminds himself. Six months and Sherlock can come back if Mycroft's estimation is right. But god, how long that seems. Six months without cases or chases through London. Six months of his daughter's life that Sherlock won't be a part of. How many of the baby's milestones will Sherlock miss? First laugh? First crawl?
Right then, at one in the morning, all the feelings John has been repressing into a backseat for almost half a decade comes rushing back like a tidal wave, so powerful and all-encompassing he can scarcely breathe from the realisation. He sees himself ten, fifteen, twenty years from now, still here, still raising Rosie with him, still on cases -
"Sherlock. Victor punched him, cut his cheek. Need some antibacterial." Though John prided himself on his stamina, built up from those cases running around chasing Sherlock and playing constant football at home, he was still breathing heavily and trying to calm his pulse as he conversed with Greg.
(Also, helping detective? I'm disappointed that could even cross your mind. I had much higher expectations of your intelligence, John Watson.)
“Nothing really. It’s a bit of a crap holiday. Felt in a good mood, though. I suppose with all the pink decorations and adverts on tv all the good cheer has to become contagious at some point.”
Slughorn sniffed the potion tentatively, nodded in approval, then poured it into a glass transparent vial to check the colour. It was dark turquoise, the colour that was stated in the book to be correct, so Slughorn seemed satisfied with that as well. He stirred the potion in the cauldron, testing its texture (thin, watery) and smiled.
“I had to have something to do while I was stuck at Baker Street all those months,” Sherlock shrugs. “Even before I was shot, I started skimming through a couple of books. It was soon after your wedding, even when I started to - doubt my place in your life with your marriage to Mary, I decided that I wanted to be of any use to you that you’d need me for. If you no longer needed me for cases and adventure, then perhaps I could…” He trails off, struggling
“If the second task was anything to go by, any pride or dignity John may have had probably disappeared. No offence, of course.” Mycroft spoke.
"Not really, it's just more of the same. Money troubles, Harry yelling at me for breathing too loud, Mum's taken up watching exercise classes on youtube."
“Sir,” a small voice piped up, and the man turned to face the source of the noise – a young man barely 18 years old with acne and a voice that still cracked on occasion, “Why are we always watching these two if we never actually do anything?”
"Jealous?" Moriarty pouted mockingly, which quickly switched into a smirk. "That would have come in handy in your line of work. 'Consulting detective'," the man said this with an air of curiosity, more intrigued than the patronising way most responded to Sherlock's ambition. "Very handy. It helps me too, you know. In my line of work."
Inside, someone starts counting down already to midnight - sixty, fifty-nine, fifty-eight... Someone else tells them to 'shut the hell up already.'
By the way, nor did I kiss you for an experiment. Or out of curiosity. Well, sort of. It's difficult to explain. I suppose it is curiosity in a way, isn't it? Except one trial run probably isn't enough, as it would be in the event that this was little more than a scientific experiment - it is rather a lot less satiable. It's rather distracting, actually. You're a terribly inconvenient influence on me.
Sherlock shook his head. "Nothing. Nothing I can do. The events will fold out whatever I do. Whoever did this has planned this. They're clever. They know what they're doing and it will happen no matter what. I'll just have to respond appropriately."
John paused. "I would... Invest it. Change some into muggle money. Then it would go towards either training to become a healer or muggle medical school."
“All of it. You tried to keep me away from danger, you kissed me, you shot my wife for me, you sacrificed your scarf - “
Sherlock Holmes: I'm an ISTP. Quiet and reserved, interested in how and why things work. Excellent skills with mechanical things. Risk-takers who they live for the moment. Usually interested in and talented at extreme sports. Uncomplicated in their desires. Loyal to their peers and to their internal value systems, but not overly concerned with respecting laws and rules if they get in the way of getting something done. Detached and analytical, they excel at finding solutions to practical problems.
"Morning! I put on a pot of coffee, do you want-?" Sherlock's bright eyes snapped shut, a brilliant blush creeping up his neck.
"He'll do anything, just for kicks," John added, watching Sherlock out of the corner of his eyes. His hands, neatly clasped behind his back, were turning white from him holding them so tightly. His lips were parted and he was breathing shallowly, struggling to keep his eyes open. A rather pretty pink flush was climbing up his neck.
"I used up all the hot water in the shower twice." thwackthwack. "I left the toothpaste lid off four times." thwackthwackthwackthwack. "I- ah- left a mess in the kitchen two- no, three times." thwackthwackthwack.
"I suppose bondage has always intrigued me... sensory deprivation... punishment, edging, orgasm delay and denial, roleplay, domination..."
I pinched the bridge of my nose. "You downed a dozen tablets then drank an entire pot of coffee. Why would you do that if it wasn't a suicide attempt?"
Sherlock nodded, wriggling his bum to emphasize the point. "Come on, it's uncomfortable like this," he whined.
"Touch-" he managed, voice low and gravelly and Jesus, how could a voice be so arousing, another few words and he'd have John cumming in his pants like a randy teenager; did Sherlock want John to touch him or touch himself, or was it merely a statement, yes John I am touching myself in our shared living space, feel free to start the kettle?
Sherlock whimpered, hips thrusting several times in desperate search for friction. "I need to," Sherlock panted, tossing his head. "John, please, just... Let me..."
Sherlock stepped back. “Good. You may climb into the bathtub and take the doggy position. You are familiar, yes?”
Once he made it to the second digit, John scissored his fingers slightly, twisting them slowly. "God," Sherlock moaned, a long, drawn out sound that went straight to John's throbbing cock.
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: I'm no reporter, sir, we've never met before...But, to answer your question, it is a lot of things about him that I like.
Feeling about three hundred times better, John opened the door. Sherlock was indeed at the end of the hall, reading a book. He looked up. “Everything alright?”
"I could do it. The bondage and stuff. One of my girlfriends was really into that and I got quite good at it," John stated. "We could try it... When you're more comfortable with the whole thing, that is. We'll go nice and slow the first few times."
"Yes. Every other Wednesday, I retreat to my room exactly nineteen minutes earlier than usual to do this. I'm not going to skip this one just because you find it inconvenient. Now leave."
I'm a bloody pervert, John thought with surprisingly little disgust, for not leaving as soon as I realized what was happening.
John knocked hesitantly at his ex-professor’s door. He heard what sounded like an elderly lady call something and a second later footsteps. Only a few seconds later the door was opened and there stood Holmes. He smiled, opening the door wider and allowing John to enter.
John let out a small moan, running his thumb over his already leaking tip. This wouldn't take long at all.
He sauntered back over to John, calm and confident. John wished he could siphon some of his aura and use it as his own.
John sagged. So he knew what he was doing, at least. Not that he thought Sherlock would do this without any expertise. “All men?”
John eagerly licked his cock, lapping up every drop he could reach. It was definitely saltier than he remembered but not unpleasant. He remembered the guys in the army always commenting on how eager he was to swallow. Perhaps it had some truth to it.
He repeated the action a few times until Sherlock seemed comfortable, then he slowly pressed in his finger to the first digit.
"We'll have a- ahhh- fish and chips and- mmm- a OH MY GOD- b-burger," Sherlock stumbled over his words, finally crying out when John turned the vibrator to it's highest intensity. John closed his eyes to refrain from bending him over this counter and having him right here in front of everyone.
John lifted his bum off the bed and pulled off his red pants. "Come on," he smirked. "I believe I said I wouldn't touch you until you touched yourself."
As if reading my mind, one of Sherlock's perfectly sculpted eyebrows went up, but he didn't comment. Instead, he stood and slowly pulled off his trousers, gracelessly kicking them off. They landed in a heap on the floor, and I kept my eyes determined trained on them instead of my now half-naked flatmate.
Sherlock Holmes: Then that's what I'll have. Before I get too drunk, I'll introduce myself: Sherlock Holmes, world famous consulting detective.
The second one came just as swiftly, landing on his other cheek. Prepared this time, Sherlock bit back a moan. It stung a bit, yeah, but more than being painful, it was pleasurable.
"You know what I want," I replied breathlessly, fisting one hand in his long, dark curls. They were just as soft as I had imagined so many nights in my bedroom, alone... "I want you to... kiss me. On not-my-mouth."
He opened his eyes, panting, surprised by the hunger in Sherlock's face as he looked down at the doctor. "Fantastic, John. Absolutely brilliant," he breathed, carding his fingers through the older man's hair. "Stand up so I can clean you up."
Sherlock paused again. “Probably The Lost World by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He was a brilliant writer. You should read his novels. And your favourite?”
"Well. Okay then- right." John cleared his throat, going from collected and professional to completely off kilter. "Well, my question still stands. What do you think you would like in the bedroom?"
John grabbed his coat and stormed out of the flat, not sure if he was more embarrassed or angry. The arrogant cock was just pushing John's buttons and he'd had enough.
"Stall," John commanded, reaching into his pocket. "Trousers down, coat off, bent over the toilet with your forearms on the tank." He clicked the vibrator off and Sherlock gasped, stumbling to the closest stall. He heard the zipper go down and Sherlock's trousers hit the floor.
Hiro Hamada: I...I'm fourteen! *shouts and voice squeaks a bit* I don't know. Well...shut up, I-I don't know.
Well, his denims were getting very uncomfortable now, weren't they. Sherlock probably wouldn't mind if John just... but no. Even with lower brain function than normal he knew that would be crossing a huge line, wanking while watching someone else wanking without their knowledge.
The refrigerator opened, and John was only partly disgusted to find a pickled organ (spleen, maybe?) on the shelf next to the carton of milk. He would need to have another chat with Sherlock to remind him that now that there was a baby in the house, he had to clean up after himself and put his experiments far out of reach.
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: I'm sorry if my interest in Mr. Moriarty offends you.. I would like to be your friend, not become your enemy because of it.
When it finally came out, Sherlock's arse gaped for a moment in the cool air, but immediately the pink bud closed.
Sherlock Holmes: Is Cas a *hic* top or bottom? I'd be either for *hic* you... but don't tell Jawn...
"That was. Um." Sherlock cleared his throat, quite embarrassed. "Sorry if I was a bit rough, I got carried away."
Nearly an hour later, John made his way back to the bedroom. He had hardly been able to concentrate while he worked, kept busy by his half-hard cock and the image of Sherlock tied to the bed, helpless.
John's fingers were still tingly at the 'our relationship is the most important thing to me' bit. "You could've just said... I dunno..."
"But before I do anything, I need to know what you like, and what you don't. I know you're a virgin, and that's perfectly fine, but you have to have some preference. Do you like to do anything when you touch yourself?"
'Confirmed. Walked in on them just now in the bathroom at the cafe. Poor sods won't know what hit them.
It took all of his resolve not to fuck into his own hand, he was so hard. The only thing that kept him from it was knowing how much better Sherlock would be, how much tighter and warmer-
Sherlock moaned in response, his higher  brain functions having abandoned him for the moment. His hips thrust up and into John's hand, bringing him closer and closer to orgasm.
Sherlock placed his hand on John’s abdomen and rubbed gently and slowly, easing some of the discomfort. “Only another five or ten minutes, then I’ll be done injecting the serum.”
He pushed his fingers in further, stilling only when he could go no further. He spread his fingers into a V, getting a muffled cry from Sherlock.
My jaw worked as slowly, the rapid fire words sunk into my brain. "It was half a bottle of paracetamol, Sherlock, what are we supposed to think?"
John slowly, cautiously trailed his tongue along Sherlock's bottom lip, attentive for a sign that he didn't like it. On the contrary, Sherlock sighed gently into his mouth, parting his lips further for easier access.
John woke up with a pounding headache and a faint sense of regret. He laid in his bed, eyes closed, for several seconds before heaving himself up to a sitting position and cracking his eyelids open to the bright morning sun streaming through his window.
“This might feel uncomfortable,” Sherlock mumbled, tracing the puckering hole. The chill of the gel made John shiver. Without another word, one finger was thrust into him.
Sherlock Holmes: If I don't notice you leaving the flat, I'm sure you could say whatever you like without me processing it.
For someone who didn't have much experience in anal sex, it seemed to me like he was moving much too quickly; a third finger was added, and they spread apart and back together, stretching him out enough for his toy. His hand had stilled around his cock, instead letting his hips snap up and into his fist. His head was red and swollen, a steady stream of precum dripping down over the knuckle of his thumb.
They sat in silence for several minutes as the stranger did his business, washed his hands, and finally left.
He opened the kitchen door and ducked in, not bothering to say hello to his flatmate. To be fair, the detective had still been in his room, sleeping, when John had left the first time to take Rosie to Molly Hooper's. (God bless that woman for looking after his daughter so often.)
Hesitating for only a moment, Sherlock nodded, brushing past his Dominant (for that was his role at the moment) to the large bed and bent over at the waist, legs spread.
Finally, John ran his fingertips lightly up the underside of Sherlock's shaft. His index finger caught a bead of pre-cum, spreading it over Sherlock's glans and head.
Hiro Hamada: Yeah, chip. *holds a hand into the air and the small bot flies up and into it* I was just resetting the magnetic compensate for the extra epidermal level, but carbon relay snapped due to the increase in input from the heightened sensors, to the quantum s- and you have no idea what I'm saying, do you?
"Back," John announced, slightly out of breath. Sherlock's eyes snapped open just as John pulled off his trousers eagerly (leaving on his pants.) Next came his jumper and the his t-shirt.
"No you don't," Sherlock replied, looking up at me. His eyes were dark, the pupils nearly eclipsing the light blue irises. "You want to fuck my mouth."
As John tilted his head back in silent relief, he heard a small noise from behind the shower door. It sounded like a whimper- was Sherlock hurt? Had he somehow fallen without John hearing?
His pink bud stood out from his ivory skin, and John looked at his arse for several seconds before finally leaning forward, spreading his cheeks further apart, and licking around Sherlock's arsehole.
Sherlock took a shuddering breath as John rotated his hips, his thumb rubbing over his sensitive head. "I'm your slut, your dirty little slut, and I want your cock up my ass and down my throat and- oh FUCK, right there." His knees nearly gave out as John brushed his prostate. "Oh my God, oh fucking hell, yessss..."
Sherlock Holmes: There is absolutely no shimmer to his eyes. They're cold, black, and dull. A true serial killer.
Just as Sherlock adjusted to having three fingers in him, John was lubing up his arsehole and his own cock and then he was lined up and going in, in, in, fast and deep and merciless.
"Oh." John cleared his throat, quite pleased with himself. "Right. You said you knew I would walk in on you. Why-?"
John felt his cock leaking and he hadn't even touched himself. He hadn't been hard so many times in twenty four hours since he was in college. "Stop. Stop," John growled, pinning the younger man's arms above his head. Sherlock's eyes snapped open, wild and dark. He had been closer than John had thought.
"Do you like being Dominant? Or did you just tolerate it?" Sherlock asked, slightly nervously. John smiled internally at his hesitance. Not often was Sherlock caught in such a position.
‘If I hadn’t known what an enema was before now, I would certainly stay away from you’ John typed in response, smirking at his own wit.
He was surprisingly rough with himself, the small part of John's brain that wasn't in total shutdown mode observed. One long fingered hand was wrapped around his cock, seemingly intent to rip it off himself, and his other hand was occupied with one of his dusky nipples, twisting and pulling harder than John would've ever dared.
"You walked in on me masturbating in the shower. I heard the door open, I heard you urinate, and then you left rather quickly. Did I make you uncomfortable?"
Both men burst into giggles, completely childish and ridiculous as it seemed. Once they had regained their composure, John got to the real question: "Why the hell were you singing that?"
John collapsed sideways, next to Sherlock. "Jesus. Jesus Christ," he painted. "So eager... God. Can't wait to fuck you properly."
Sherlock laughed. “Not until you get to the toilet, no. But you can make your way there. I’ll be in the hallway. Yell if you need anything.”
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: You've got it all wrong sir, I don't just like criminals...It's only him that I like. It doesn't mean I have a type.
"J-ohn," Sherlock groaned, rubbing his cock against John's frantically. "I'm so close. It's... Please... Fuck me-"
He froze, listening. Yes, Sherlock was breathing heavily, John could hear that now. Sherlock sucked in a deep breath and then groaned and that's when John knew.
"It is a sin," John declared, "to have gone this long without letting anyone touch your prick. It's bloody perfect."
Apparently even six glasses aren't enough for him to admit it and his face burns with embarrassment because of it.
“Not necessarily! It’s only the first read through. Maybe once the whole thing is set up you’ll be able to get into the character a bit more.”
“Ha. I’ll talk to you soon, okay? My new roommate will be back in a minute. Probably going to drag me out drinking with some others.”
John exhaled. “It’s back to square one. Drinking every morning while she sits struggling at her typewriter, with a temper that could scare the Queen.”
But what he's most certain of is that gunshot wounds goddamn hurt. The first time in Afghanistan really didn't prepare him for this.
Sherlock never missed home whenever he was at Hogwarts. He never thought about the delicious smells constantly coming from the kitchen, the sofa which he loved to sink into for reading or watching the telly, his bedroom with the periodic table poster and the test tubes and Bunsen burner on his desk ready for an experiment. So normally, when he came home it was Hogwarts that he missed, and the holidays seemed too long a wait. Now, the holiday could not be long enough.
He finishes undoing the ropes and waits a moment to make certain that the guard outside hadn’t been alerted, then puts on the man’s jacket, trousers, and hat, tucking his now overgrown hair inside. He doesn’t much resemble the man, but he has faith that the guard outside won’t bother looking too closely. For good measure, he takes the gun from his newly required jacket and shoots the man in the head. When he walks out of the cell, he doesn’t look back.
“Mmh, do you think you could go for more than 24 hours without slagging off your brother? You spoke about him last night, you know. Something about his failed diet.”
He’d had it planned out, every single detail. He had known that Sherlock would look for the suitcase, contact the dead woman’s phone, would try to arrange a meeting and assume that the passenger would be the serial killer. What would come next that evening was also planned, relying on years of observing Sherlock and John’s behaviour and a gift for divination to account for every possible outcome. So far, everything was running smoothly.
John buries his face in his hands with a groan. "Christ, this is humiliating. You say something now."
"Good morning, John." Sherlock said, standing behind him. John turned to face him and smiled weakly back at him. "I - uh - that's a nice uniform." Sherlock sat down quickly next to him.
John rolls his eyes at the dismay on Greg’s face. “Oh, no, what a tragedy. You’ll be given the lead role in one of Shakespeare’s greatest plays and have multiple love interests.”
"Well, we don't know that they're innocent for certain until I can get there, but yes, I suppose so." Then Sherlock turns to John, mischief burning in his eyes. "Come with me."
"Sherlock," John cuts across him firmly, "leave it. Turn your brain off for one damn second before you hurt yourself, okay? Let's not think about Mary or the baby. Christ knows I've been up to my neck in baby clothes and nappies and bottles lately..."
When Sherlock woke up the next morning after a slightly less troubled than usual sleep, he knew from the warmth of a smaller body next to him and the harsh texture of the plain starched mattress that he was still in John's bed, which surprised him, as he assumed that someone would have ushered him away at this point. Nonetheless, he decided not to question it, and he scooter over closer to John, wrapping himself around him, breathing in his scent, a small smile forming for the first time in days -
"This is a turn-up, isn't it, Sherlock." Sherlock approached him, his hand reaching out. He stood still just before he could get close enough to touch John, something restraining the shaking hand that longed to touch. Perhaps it was the way John was standing - erect and formal, yet like a single puff of wind could send him blowing away, like a house of cards. So instead, Sherlock gazed into John's eyes, a confusing cocktail of emotions ranging somewhere between happiness and pure, unadulterated fear. The latter won when Sherlock's clouded judgement faded and realised that John's midnight-blue eyes had become a pale, almost silver, blue, and unblinking.
However, upon consulting some very informative advice books (mostly for people in heterosexual soulmate relationships, if not entirely, but useful nonetheless.
"What about someone who deduces people for entertainment? John said you could do that. Deducing, I mean."
"So did you buy all these games just for the experiment?" he asks while Sherlock divides the pieces between the two of them. "You don't seem like the type of person to play these things regularly."
The kind that can only come from other gods, as familiar as Sherlock’s own, recognisable by its static tingle in the air, and yet warmer, like sunlight, and slightly fragrant like the flowers outside the shops on the street. Sherlock’s breath catches in his throat, choking him.
Sherlock reluctantly pulled his eyes up from the book to look up at Janine. "Yes. And yes, you can sit down."
"No, it was called for. Besides, it's hardly the first time I've had to be reminded to keep my mouth shut," Sherlock shrugs. John hates how casual he is about it., but before he can open his mouth to protest Sherlock speaks in a rush."I should probably go. My being here any longer than I need to be won't help things, and - "
), they head out of the cafe to go back to Sherlock's house. Sherlock resisted at first, explaining that he had an entire schedule of sightseeing planned - or rather, as much of sightseeing as someone can do in a place that has three churches, two pubs, one park and absolutely no redeeming features of any kind that could entertain the two of them - but John shook his head. "You need your coat. I wouldn't be surprised if you needed a change of clothes." Sherlock rolled his eyes but agreed.
"I don't actually care about when you introduced me to your friends. I don't know what came over me."
"Nonsense, I have the utmost faith in you. Don't worry, I will allow you two hours after your shift before we meet tomorrow."
Sherlock sat up abruptly, rubbing the sleep from his eyes to make sure he wasn't hallucinating, then observed John, who continued to pack with a calm precision with the suitcase and piles of his t-shirts and shorts on the bed. Each time an item of clothing was packed away was like a drop of cold water down Sherlock's neck. “What are you doing?”
"Your accent, too. It's almost undetectable. I does make me wonder," Sherlock regained his cool mask, "whether you are French at all."
I don't mind what we do in London. Try to avoid taking me to sporting events, please. I will probably end up talking over any film you take me to in the cinema. Films these days are so unimaginative and repetitive. I could probably spoil the plot for you within five minutes. Not to mention deducing the private lives of actors. Apparently, people don't like having their idealised images of celebrities 'ruined' for them. Honestly, if you could find a crime scene for me to break into, that would be ideal. A murder would be preferable. If not, sight-seeing will do.
"Terry, do you think you could leave some room for John and his friend?" John can't help but wince at the last word, silently correcting it in his mind: Soulmate, soulmate, soulmate... Mr Watson sits up with an exaggerated groan, but his legs remain obnoxiously spread out.
“But it’s urgent. The truth is, I’ve been thinking about what you said at the end of our last video call session yesterday.”
Then he felt his stomach lurch again, and he barely made it to the bin before he vomited up the alcohol and the one sandwich he ate the day before. After he stopped gagging, he leant back and wiped the perspiration off his face. He felt no better. Actually, it was fair to say he felt like complete shit.
"Careful, John," Sherlock said, amused, "Molly is a Hufflepuff. If it weren't for her, you would be getting 'P's in divination and charms."
None of these people - no matter how relatively interesting the backstory -  can ever make up for the fact that John's life was unbearably, mind-numbingly, excruciatingly dull. He had heard of soldiers struggling to adapt to civilian life, but never of this being due to them missing the war zone, nor did he hear of distressing nightmares that made them feel empty with longing as they stare up at the ceiling of his cheap, run-down flat. All he had these days was this job, his sister's hand-me-down phone, and people watching, and he doesn't even have the comfort of knowing if this is normal.
John eventually catches up with Sherlock's long, determined strides and they walk up to the main road to find a taxi. Sherlock seems normal, like kissing John is a completely normal occurrence, though John supposes that it was nothing more than acting on a whim in the heat of the moment. "So," he says, deciding that he may as well act as though nothing happened too. "Got any theories?"
There was an awkward hiatus, during which Sherlock did not fail to notice the - knowing? - eye contact Molly and Greg made. Then Greg cut in, "so - uh - John? I'm guessing you're still gonna be a healer? Or a... Muggle healer?"
"That's quite brave of them." Mary said, who, apparently, had been watching Victor and Sherlock too.
"Trying to get my attention." Sherlock turned around and instantly John was standing in front of him, his eyes wide and worried, dressed in his trademark jumper and jeans. He looked...scared. Concerned. Sherlock felt his eyes fill with moisture. "I'm so sorry, John."
I'm sorry, I feel like I'm rambling. I don't do well on less than seven hours of sleep and I've been sort of stressed lately.
Sherlock can see the way John is twitching with excitement, the hopeful glitter of his eyes, the high pitch with which he spoke, underneath a facade of mild interest. Sherlock smiles, and adds, “I could use a guide, you know.”
After a dinner that he was forced into eating, he went up to his room under the pretence that he wanted to unpack. Instead, he got his phone from his bag and checked it for messages. Nothing. John always texted him when he got home. Clearly he was avoiding him.
“Ha, and not because you’re touch starved and horny all the time after being in lockdown for nearly two weeks?”
"While we're on the subject of compliments...that last letter, where you explained how you knew all that about me."
A tall man, whom John guessed to be the teacher, strolled out last. He wore a similar belt and fur-lined costume, except black. John couldn't quite see his face from where he was standing, but even at his distance he sensed where the other students gained their arrogance and strength from.
"Ask the victims' relatives about any tattoos or nearby tattoo parlours. If you need us we'll be in the morgue."
By the way, 10/10? That's a rather generous assessment of the picture, but then again Redbeard wouldn't be deserving of any less. And no, of course I'm not wearing a wedding suit to the park. That would be highly impractical. Still, I'm glad your high fashion 'expertise' (Jumpers and plaid shirts? Really?) approves of the outfit in that picture. Perhaps I will make sure to wear it on the 18th.
