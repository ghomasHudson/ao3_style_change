Distantly, a door slammed. Reality reasserted itself, pushing between them, forcing them apart. They stared at each other. Fear was already devouring the happiness within them, disgust soon followed.
The car was parked on the edge of town, the road equally dusty and worn as it had been all those years before, leaving a beige shroud on the Impala’s body. Nobody, it seemed, had bothered to have it paved and why would they? Why would you bother to pave the road that lead to the end of the world.
“I’m glad son,” and he was, John realised. As much as he loved them, as much as he couldn’t lose them, his sons had been so isolated since Mary. They needed to get back into the world. Besides Sam was almost the same age as he’d been when he’d met Mary...
“You,” she whispers eventually, shivering under the weight of his curiosity, unsure of how to act on the end of a gaze that demands nothing of her – that only asks. She feels naked even though she’s still fully clothed. She feels exposed and it scares her – not because Cas is there, but because he might soon be gone. She wants to be seen by him – wants to show him the parts of herself she normally keeps hidden because the thought of hiding them from him scares her more than how he might react to them. Because if she can’t show them to Cas, then she’s not sure anyone else will ever see them. “I want
“Is that what you got into fights about?” he asked, gently.  When all Castiel could do was nod, Dean squeezed his arm in sympathy. “Idiots, that’s all they were.” He assured Cas, “fuck ‘em.”
Sam and Cas scramble to follow him. “Did Dad…hurt you often?” Sam asks, rage tinting the edge of his voice. “Like that?”
He was missing from the house, but that didn’t surprise him. John had done the same when his Mom had died: removing all physical traces of her life, as if pretending she’d never been there would make the pain any more bearable.  All that remained of Mary now were photographs.
Cas reached out to steady him, and felt the tiny shakes Dean was trying to suppress. For the moment, reality faded, leaving them only with each other.
“And I get it, I really do. I grew up in the same crappy towns and drank in the same crappy bars with the same shitty hunters and rednecks you did. I know how they would’ve treated you if you’d been out: and I know how Dad would’ve reacted too,” Dean’s eye twitches, but he remains silent so Sam ploughs on. “So yeah, I get the masculine posturing, the overcompensation and the internalised homophobia but it’s a different world now – and Dad’s
“Because when was the last time all three of us did something or went somewhere without it being the end of the world?”
By this point they’ve reached the motel which is, of course, lined with doors. One of the doors, the one Dean is leading them to, has a date instead of a room number: 02
“Don’t play dumb with me Sammy,” Dean taunts. “I know you’ve noticed, even if you’re trying to tell yourself you haven’t. You’ve been the common thread so far haven’t you?”
Uriel’s smile deepened.  “Really, Dean. You don’t honestly think we’d let you show your face round here anymore?”
“Cas,” Dean’s voice was hoarse with emotion when they finally broke apart. “I didn’t think I’d ever see you again.”
Sleepless nights and empty Sundays. Would he have wasted them if he’d known what was going to happen?  Would he have cherished every moment, with Cas, with John, with Sam, if he’d known they were closer to his last than his first? What had fallen through the cracks?
“An’ I nearly fell right back into this same trap. I bought into his lies, I encouraged Castiel to reach out to him, even though all that tried before him failed. I was gonna stand here today and urge forgiveness. I would’ve let this snake free to try again. I would’ve set him loose on your children.” He gave a visible shudder at the thought. “But I couldn’t do it. Not again.
There is a drawn out, tense, cold second where all sounds except for Dean’s heavy breathing recede. The world around them darkens even further, the entire focus of the memory shrinking to John’s livid face – which remains lit and luridly coloured.
Sam barely hears him over the rushing in his ears. He coughs and feels blood spill down his chin, tears down his cheeks. The world around them is fading – everything is shrinking to the agony in his chest as Dean hacks and slices and carves and…
“It just hurts so much,” Dean lowers his head. “I’m so tired of hurting Sammy,” he breathes, barely audible. “I just need it to stop. I’m sorry; I just can’t be your brother anymore. I can’t be anything anymore.”
Carefully he lifts the flame higher – revealing vague and twisted shapes. He had half expected (even hoped) for the light to prompt some change – to kick start the memory into action . Instead, the eerily empty chains and hooks (the source of the gentle swaying and dripping) continue to swing slowly, peacefully. The light dances off something shiny on the points, and off of unidentifiable puddles congealing on the floor, the only signs that life (or not life) has occurred here. Underneath it all, the drumbeat continues.
Dean stiffened, trying to figure out whether it was worth arguing or not. “I don’t know what you mean Dad,” he said eventually. Dad was going to shout at him whatever, he figured.
Not much had changed in ten years, except that no one seemed to have dusted. He remembered sneaking in on that last day, remembered the dark patches on the wall where photographs of him had once hung. They were gone now: the shadows had faded into nothing in some places while in others new frames obscured them. He stopped in front of a patch of wall where, he thought, there had once been a picture of Mom, holding him in her arms (the photo had been too big to take with him, he wondered what had happened to it.) There was a new photograph now and he leaned in to study it. Two mismatched figures stood in front of the car. Sam – a ridiculously tall 17 year old in a navy suit that was slightly too short with floppy hair that was slightly too long – had his arm clasped awkwardly around the waist of a dark haired girl in a red dress. They were both grinning bashfully towards the camera. Dean smiled back.
A metallic click has them spinning around instantly. “Huh,” Dean (who had definitely not been there before, but has also clearly been here the whole time) says, sitting on the hood of the impala, lighting the cigarette in his mouth. “Your hair’s longer.”
He’d taken everything from him: his past, his present, his mother, his father, his lover, his brother: all for what?
A familiar resentment rose in his throat. He squashed it before the questions could form. It wasn’t Dad’s fault. He was only trying his best. It wasn’t his fault
Castiel opened his mouth to retort, but thought better of it. He knew his father would be furious if he got into a fight on his first day (and with the other Pastor’s son no less) and he also knew it would only make Uriel hate Dean more. He knew all that, but he also knew he’d never wanted to punch someone as badly as he did now. He forced himself to be content with imagining it for now. He hoped it would be enough to see him through the day.
The question haunted Castiel as he tried to sleep. He wanted to forget; maybe it was all just a dream.
Dean’s jaw twitched, though his eyes remained flat and unreadable. “Yeah, I understand,” his voice too was expressionless as he dug in his pockets and pulled out his car keys, chucking them towards Sam without looking at him. Then he turned and walked out the house, slamming the front door behind him.
“It doesn’t matter Sammy, it’s not safe.” Dean was firm. “Me n’ Cas have worked our asses off to make a home away from Him and all this and we ain’t losing that for anything. All it takes is one slip up for the Pastor to find out and he’ll show up, frothing at the mouth no doubt, on our doorstep. I ain’t risking Cas nor Charlie nor my damn diner, Ok?”
“Dad, please, I’ve been nothing but honest.” Cas let his voice quaver, tried to look as confused as possible. He just had to get through a few more hours. “I’m telling the truth I swear.”
“Hey,” Dean shrugs, still watching them with what could pass for humanity in his green eyes, “It’s gonna happen either way and I promise to be quick about it, at least. Well,” he amends, after a second’s thought, “maybe not quick. Quickish. Or maybe not quickish. But, y’know: not slow.”
Dean saw Cas immediately. Their eyes met, and he almost laughed out loud at the “get me the fuck out of here” look in them. He crossed the hall in quick, easy strides. Hael had followed Castiel’s gaze, her face took on a pained look and her grip on his arm tightened noticeably.
Had it really been love, he wondered all this time later. It had certainly felt like love. Or so he assumed. It had felt real, realer than anything he’d ever felt before. But at that age, everything felt real. When he’d first kissed Cas, he sworn nothing could ever feel so good, until the next time they’d kissed.
Sam searches for Dean (the Dean, a Dean, any Dean) but he seems to be lost in the collage of the crowd. Cas, standing at his elbow, frowns.
“Anna!” he caught up to her at the entrance to the gym. Cheesy music drifted out the doors. “What’s wrong?”
“Dean, I’m sorry,” Castiel said quietly, moving his head closer to the other boy’s until they were almost touching. “I’d rather be with you.  They’re the wrong people, not you.” It was clumsy, but Dean felt the words resonate through him none the less.
It’d been a sleepover, he remembered abruptly. Sam’d been invited by his friends (Ruby probably) but he’d refused to go.
“I understand that. But think about it. We’re graduating at the end of the year. You’re smart Cas, book smart, like Sammy. I’ll bet you can get into college, any college. That gives you an out that doesn’t end with you in some alley somewhere. It’ll just take time is all.”
“Dean Winchester?” “Yeah, he’s about your age. You’ll probably be in the same class in school. He’s got a younger brother too, Sam. Great kid” They drove in silence for a few minutes, before pulling in front of a house that looked exactly the same as all the other houses around here. Castiel wondered how they found the right ones in the dark.
“I’m in a bed – which is strange because I don’t sleep – but I’m not injured or sick. I’m comfortable and…and happy. For the first time in a long time, maybe ever, everything is ok. There’s nothing going wrong, no apocalypse to fight or insurmountable odds to overcome. I’m lying in bed and everything is ok,” He can’t look at Dean right now – he focuses on his hands instead.  “And then I turn over and you’re there beside me – and I can reach out and touch you, and hold you, and put my hand through your hair. You’re there and you’re not going to vanish, you’re not going to have to get up and sacrifice yourself for the world again. It’s just you and me, and outside of us there’s peace,” he shakes his head. “And I know that we’ll probably never have peace, but I pray every day to a god I know doesn’t care that I can have you.”
Dad, this place is crawling with kids on vacation. Which,” he adds venomously, “ends next week. You gonna enrol us in school on time this year? Or are you gonna be too busy with some fucking skinwalker like last time?” He smirks again at the look on John’s face. “Anything else you wanna rail me for while you’ve got me here?”
Sam let her pull him into the easy conversation, with Dean occasionally supplying his own titbits from the side. Slowly, under Missouri’s masterful guidance, the flow of conversation eased in the direction of the older Winchester.
Sam opened his mouth to disagree, and then thought better of it, a plan forming in his mind. “Maybe yeah,” he said instead. “I’ll see you soon ok?”
He saw all this, and felt cold. He tried to catch Castiel’s eyes, but they were fixed on his father’s figures, the brows creased in worry.
“Yeah,” Dean goes to check his watch, but the face has melted: the numbers smudged into nothing. Still, the sun looks like it’s in the right position. “Should be right about…now.”
Cas’ head was turned away as Dean approached, he was smiling politely at some well wisher, but he turned and their eyes met.
Castiel had been worried how Dean would react to his new “mission” but the other boy took it in his stride.
“Lucifer lied,” Cas says suddenly, vehemently. The persistent niggling at the back of his mind, ever since he saw that memory, has finally made itself known to him – hatred, a new kind, towards his brother. Not the abstract hatred towards a distant foe, nor the despairing hatred of an undefeatable villain, but an intimate, personal ( human?) hatred that settles in the pit of his stomach and on the palms of his hands.
“I dunno: fire and brimstone? Demons playin’ golden fiddles and makin' human s’mores over an open flame? This just seems like more of what you got going on upstairs.”
“We just want to hear your side of the story boys,” He pushed gently. “Castiel,” he laid a gentle hand on his Son’s shoulder, “I know it must have been an awful surprise for you, what Dean did.”
“I’ll sit in church on Sunday, keep my head bowed the whole time, then afterwards I’ll go tell Pastor Walker I’ve found the light. I’ll even through in some tears if I have to. Then Boom. Repentance, forgiveness and we’re done. We both get left alone, I can be there for Sammy. It’s perfect.”
“I um got in a fight, Mom freaked.” He explained his face turning red as Dean broke into incredulous laughter. Further down the path, Sam turned to look at them suspiciously.
They wander slowly through the stalls: Cas stopping to examine each and every one, picking up the merchandise and talking to the owners. Most of the stuff is the same stall to stall, but Dean enjoys watching Cas enjoy himself.  He hears Sam settle in beside him.
“Castiel you movin’? You’re gonna to be late if you don’t get up soon.” Jim’s voice was muffled through the door.
“Is that what you told him?” Jimmy was on his feet again, striding towards Dean. He grabbed the other boy by the arms and pulled him forward, off the chair. From his corner, John Winchester watched, silent. “Is this the lies you told my Son? Is that how you lead him astray? You liar! People like you can’t love, all you do is take and corrupt and destroy!” Spit was flying from his mouth; his eyes were wide, unfocussed.
Now though, with the barriers removed and permission given, he finds himself drifting into new imaginings that remind him of dreams, though some of them may also be memories. Dean smiling, laughing. Dean kissing him. Fingers brushing over skin, running through hair. The feel of stubble on the palm of his hand, breath on the side of his neck. It’s only the disgruntled cough of the teenager at the till brings him back to reality.
It’s only when he’s finished talking that he realises Dean is breathing very fast – faster than sitting behind the wheel of a car warrants. He’s staring ahead, tears streaming down his unfocused eyes, his hands gripping the wheel so tightly that the car has begun to veer from side to side as his whole body shakes.
Cas hums noncommittally, resting his head briefly on Dean’s shoulder as they walk towards parade. “Most people appear to be with corporations or organisations of some sort,” he says.
There’d been no point in going after him, what could they have said? What could they have done? That hadn’t stopped them from trying, of course.  They’d caught site of his small figure, reuniting with his friends at the last bus. They’d had to watch, helpless as he’d climbed on, and the bus had pulled away. He’d get home first.
“Cas?” it was more a croak than anything, barely heard above the thumping of his own heart, the rush in his ears.
Sam opens his mouth to protest, but Cas beats him to it. “We won’t force you to talk about this or anything else Dean,” he assures him, squinting meaningfully in Sam’s direction. “
“Well, I was thinking we could start in the park: wander round some of the stalls and make sure Harvey’s really gone,” Sam begins and Cas next to him nods in agreement.
“Listen to me!” He was sick of listening to the endless appeals to god, he was sick of ‘paths’ and ‘redemption’.
“You’re gonna have to speak up there champ,” Demon Dean leans closer. “I didn’t catch that last bit.”
Dean straightened, under control. “Yeah, it’s enough.” He smiled as Cas. It was small, and shaky, but it was real. It was enough.
Sam can feel Cas shaking underneath his hand, and he squeezes in what he hopes is a comforting manner, but otherwise says nothing. What can he say? What can he do? For either of them?
“Wh – Oh,” in any other situation, Sam would’ve laughed himself sick at the sight of an angel blushing. Cas quickly turns from the scene, so that both of them are staring at the cream coloured wall, hung with elegant frames populated by faceless people and blurry landscapes that run into each other.
Dean shifted, embarrassed. “She’s annoyed at me for ignoring her all week.” He explained, “can’t say I blame her. I’m a pretty shitty date.”
Dean’s brain seems to have a similar vibe – only it’s not water that flows around them, it’s something that could be oil or could be smoke. A cloudy and viscous substance; constantly shifting in a patchwork of colours – here a murky purple, here a vivid blue, there a bloody red. Occasionally, there are flashes of golden light (like lightning viewed from above). At semi-regular intervals, the light has collected into small pools, flickering at them like tiny suns. Once, Cas reaches out to touch one, but Sam pulls him back before he can reach. He doesn’t want to discover what’s keeping them separated from whatever this all is – doesn’t want to find the cracks in the glass.
Latecomers were crowding the back of the church, willing to stand, it seemed, so that they might hear Jim’s sermon. Before Thursday, Dean had never understood how one person could illicit such adoration. Now he empathised ruefully with the pure happiness radiating from many of the faces. He was no better, enthralled with thoughts of Castiel.
The church erupted into cheers. The congregation, overcome with the emotions they had stifled while the Pastor spoke, seemed incapable of calming down. Jim smiled at his handiwork, still panting slightly. He was too caught up in the jubilant faces of the crowd to pay attention to his son.
Sam and Cas glance at each other. Cas gestures slightly with his head, and they both move to the side – away from Dean (or whatever it is), who watches them with a slight grin on his face but doesn’t try to move any closer.
,” he spits, and Cas (as usual) isn’t sure whether to cheer or groan at his forced bravado in the face of the enemy, his inability to let things lie. “Grown man standing above a teenage boy in swim trunks – nobody’s gonna think
Both behind and in front of them, the tunnel stretches, long and straight. Nothing marks the spot where it began, and nothing ahead of them suggests an ending. There’s no obvious light source, yet they can see everything clearly enough as they edge forwards, trying to find some discernible pattern or meaning in the walls as they move past. Or maybe the walls are moving around them? It’s not like they’re in a physical space right now. Or are they? Have they literally been transformed into electrical impulses moving through Dean’s brain matter, and this is the only way their consciousnesses are able to conceive it, or are they in some magical simulation created by the witch?
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” Castiel burst out. Dean could feel him shaking under his hand. “What I did was wrong; it wasn’t fair to you –”
“Did it right out in the open too,” Missouri was fuming, rifling through the kit angrily. “When I found you there must’ve been five other people lookin the opposite way.”
“I don’t know why you’re trying to deny it,” he spreads his hands in mock confusion.  “You’ve never been shy to admit how bad I’ve been for you, so why do you ignore how bad you’ve been for me?”
“Whatever you make him do, it won’t matter. We win.” There’s a flicker of smugness, even under all this fear, and Sam grabs onto it desperately – trying to project it outwards.
“You,” he wheezes, still looking down. “You ripped my fucking heart out. Bit on the nose, isn’t it?”
There’s a scream, a dramatic puff of sickly green smoke, and a gunshot. A body hits the floor. Sam and Cas freeze in the doorway. Dean Blinks at them. His eyes feel hot – there’s green smoke flickering over them, clouding his vision. He stretches a hand out – trying to warn them away. They don’t listen. They run forward, Sam grabs his shoulder, Cas grabs his wrist. They begin to ask if he’s ok.
“Safer than gettin’ involved. I’m poison now.” Dean told him bitterly, wincing at the sting of the iodine.
Before the lock had clicked into place, Sam had grabbed his father by the shoulders and pulled him round to face him, the phone hitting the ground with a harsh crack. “What the hell is wrong with you?” he demanded. “How could you say something like that to your own son? How d’you think Mom would feel, huh? Seeing her family tear itself apart like this.”
“I understand. I’ll do anything.” He cast about for an escape. “It’s late and, um, this whole thing has been quite tiring...”
They decided to walk to church that morning. The oppressive heat of the previous week had softened into something more bearable, and the Winchesters were joined a steady stream of happy churchgoers all heading towards the church.
Dean smiled wanly. “It’s the only high school around, everybody knows everybody. And they’ll definitely know you.”
Alone outside the school, Dean debated his options. If we went home now he’d have to explain to John why he was dateless, which he very much didn’t want to do. He knew that John would be disappointed, especially if Dean reappeared barely an hour after he’d left, and he didn’t want to face that now.
“Who’s Cas?” he heard Charlie demand eagerly as he left. The door closing cut off most of Dean’s response, but Sam heard him swearing softly and it was enough to make him laugh as he set off down the dark streets.
They were so close now, he could see every detail of Dean’s face. His freckles, the hopeful stubble on his chin, the blush creeping up his cheeks, his lips.
“Right,” he says firmly, “no more serious talk for the night. We’re gonna talk about Star Wars and that’s it.”
“You’re still young Son,” Jim was watching him with a strange expression. “You still think we can save everybody.”
Dean nodded in agreement, “He was home, heard us shouting. He still has no clue what’s going on. Uriel wanted to make sure I hadn’t ‘corrupted’ him,” he laughed bitterly, “I pretty much caved at that point.” He took a deep breath, finally admitting what he’d known for a while. “We have to leave don’t we?”
?” comes a familiar, feminine voice that somehow manages to shock Sam even more than he already is. A woman’s head appears and rests itself on Dean’s shoulder. There are a couple more wrinkles etched into her brown skin than the last time he saw her, but her curly hair is still completely black, her gaze still sharp. “There’s the understatement of the century. You had so many knots in your back I thought you were growing a new spine.”
them right down to my bones. But you, Dean Winchester, you make it worth it,” he cups Dean’s face in his hands. “I know you. I know how you take on guilt, so let me be clear:
It wasn’t the same voice (how could it be?) but he knew (how could he not?)  And spun round so fast he stumbled, clutching a chair for support.
He’d kissed Cas then, not caring how loud they were.  Jim, John and Uriel could’ve walked in at that moment and he wouldn’t of cared. He loved Cas, Cas loved him. That was all that mattered.
“I didn’t raise no fucking queers, you hear me?” John veered dangerously across the road as he said it, his hands tightening on the steering wheel unconsciously. “I don’t know who the fuck you are, but you are not my son. Not anymore. My son is gone.”
If you ignored the bruise on Dean’s face; the sadness in Missouri’s eyes and the fact they were eating in a library, it was a normal night. They kept the conversation light, Missouri gave them book recommendations and museums to check out. It was almost as if they were going on holiday, Cas reflected, rather than leaving forever. He wondered if he’d ever see anybody here again. Aside from Missouri and Dean, he realised, there was nobody for him here. No other friends or family. He hoped that, wherever they ended up, there was family to be made.
“It will be good for you, Castiel.” Uriel told him as he was escorted between classes. “Once you’ve had time away from the Winchester you will see clearly what he’s done to you.” He had assumed the role of Preacher in the absence of their fathers. “Soon you will be back on the right path.”
merging with you and reflecting your emotions. Soon, however, it should begin to manifest more…concretely: try to oppose us more directly. Fortunately, however,” he adds, looking at Dean, “since we’re in here  with you, we should be able to figure out where in your subconscious the exit is located relatively easily.”
Sam doesn’t need to ask who: the whole scenario is achingly familiar to him. He adjusts his hold so that he’s gripping Cas’ forearms, both to comfort him and to hold him back when Dean lets out his own gasp of pain and surprise. “We can’t do anything –” he says, though it kills him to say it, and he knows he’s a hypocrite for saying it. “ – Except try and stay out of the way. Let’s not make it any more painful or confusing than it already was.”
this took forever. I wanted to try a different format for Dean's memories. I'm not happy with how it turned out really, but you never know until you try.
Cautiously, they edge towards it – the light revealing the beginnings of curves and contours, the erratic beating gets louder and faster as they approach, emanating from the structure itself. They must be about ten steps away when Sam can make out the outline of a familiar hand, hanging limply, streaked with filth, blood dripping slowly off the fingers.
“We know that John doesn’t want you here anymore,” Uriel interrupted gleefully. “He doesn’t want some queer like you anywhere near Sam.”
He had finally caught a glimpse of the raven haired boy, descending the church steps alone. The service was long over, but Dean had hung around as the crowd outside the doors slowly depleted. He had drawn some odd looks, he wasn’t exactly known for his piety after all, but no one had asked him what he was doing.
“Don’t be a stranger Sammy,” his voice was slightly muffled as he spoke into Sam’s shoulder. And If there was a slight wetness on Sam’s shirt when they pulled back, Sam ignored it just as Dean was ignoring the glittering in Sam’s eyes, the quaver in his voice.
it inside me, Bobby, crawling through my head, putting itself inside me and I know I have to get it out before it eats me from the inside out. But…” he can’t finish his sentence but he doesn’t need to – he’s talking to himself after all.
The other Harvey has thrown Sam god knows where and Cas headfirst into a giant gravestone with an angel on top (Dean would laugh at the irony if he wasn’t about to die) and currently has his hands in Dean’s chest, cold fingers trying to find his heart.
He had only damned himself. Dean would be fine, as long Castiel didn’t condemn him further.  He would have to stay away. His heart ached at the thought, but it was for Dean.
But of course, Dean wasn’t stupid enough to show up, and Cas was ‘reformed’ so he was supposed to be pleased about that.
“He won’t begrudge you a few days,” Cassie says. “Just tell him you’re with an old friend – it’s not even a lie. Not really.”
Dean doubted he would be able to catch Cas before the service began, but afterwards, when people had begun to disperse, they might get a few moments of privacy.
“Who says I’m all used up?”  Dean’s voice is suddenly clear and strong, and he jerks his head upwards, crashing his forehead into his other nose. The demon falls back, roaring in pain and surprise as blood gushes down his face. Before anyone else has had time to really register exactly what’s going on, Dean’s on his feet, wrenching the axe from his own shoulder and throwing it in a long stead arc over Sam and Cas into his own chest.
“Do you know where the door is?” Sam tries hopefully, “You could take us there before…” he trails off because Dean is ignoring him, looking at Cas like he’s the only thing in the world.
Dean had debated telling John beforehand, thinking it might ease the tension between them. In the end he decided to wait. It would be more believable if his supposed transformation came
Jim seemed to believe him, but the conversation dominated Cas’ mind nevertheless. The day slipped by in a haze of worry and fear as he analysed the exchange. What had started as a faint unease as he boarded the school bus snowballed into full blown worry by lunch time as he agonized his way through the possibilities. By the time the bell rang and he managed to escape Uriel’s gang, fear was consuming his every thought.
Dean yanks his head back quickly, gasping for air. He leans against the wall, not trusting his shaking legs to hold him entirely upright. He blinks at the ground until it stops swimming. He can feel his heart beating fast in his chest, the tunnel rumbles – it seems to be laughing at him.
Cas had balanced an open book upright in front of them,  but that wouldn’t give them the privacy they needed. In the safe darkness under the table, Dean’s hand found his and they clung together, each relishing the paltry contact.
“Oh I don’t know...” she was still talking maddeningly slowly. “I don’t really have anyone go with you see...”
Now it was Dean’s turn to shrug. “S’not much of a story really. Moved from one town to another: worked odd jobs until I had enough to move on. Eventually I made my way here, started saving until I could buy the place.”
Dean shakes his head. “If I get too close I’ll get stuck too.” He glances at something off stage, frowning slightly. “That other me’ll be here soon, you two should go.” He gestures to a tree, the trunk stretching and flattening into a door, which creaks slowly open – revealing an unrevealing darkness.
“You should stay longer sometime, or at least the night,” Cassie smiles slyly. “I know you miss my cooking. And Jonah could use some help with his car – not that he’ll ever admit it. I’m scared to go near the damn thing –it’s ‘bout fit to explode.”
“Sure.” Charlie just shrugged, still smiling. “But who else would walk into his diner and only say ‘It’s complicated?’”
“I had hoped I could kind of just...blend in.” He admitted, flushing slightly. “I don’t really want to be known as the ‘Preacher’s Son.’”  Dean reached out and patted his shoulder. The warmth of his hand spread down Castiel’s arm.
“Shut up,” Dean says, but there’s a small smile on his lips. Sam can’t see in the dimness, but he’s sure Dean is blushing a little too. “He’s better than you were at least. At least he didn’t almost kill some old lady.”
“Dean’s the arrogant one?” Cas had broken in, his voice quivering with a mixture of anger and disbelief at the hypocrisy of it all. “You interrupt us, insult Dean and our friendship but somehow he’s being disrespectful?”
Groaning, Dean rolled out of his bed and stamped across the hall. Technically, he had his own room. He and Sam had been sharing for over a year, however, and neither wanted the situation to change. He pulled some clean clothes out his closet, yawning. He would have to put a wash on tonight. Sam could laugh at his dirty clothes all he liked, but he wasn’t much better. Most of his clothes were too small these days anyway, when was the last time they’d gone shopping? It must have been before Mom died; he was sure he’d never been with Dad.
“Hey hey,” Dean was running to catch up. He spun Cas to face him, and found his words dead in his throat.
“I think you’re doing fine,” Cas reassures him. Then he adds: “Though I’ve also never done this so I’m not exactly in a position to comment on your skills. Frankly, however, I think that we’ve probably been ‘fucking it up’ for years, so at this point anything is an improvement.”
Cas stretches his fingers out towards Dean’s bloody mouth, but Dean jerks back. “Cas,” he chokes out. “Please…”
“You mind looking after stuff for a bit? And tell everyone the kitchen’s closed: I need to talk to Sam here a while.”
“No, because of your jet pack. Course it’s your Dad.” Dean sounded amused, and Castiel was pleasantly surprised to find himself laughing. It wasn’t that the joke was particularly good; there was just something about Dean that made him want to smile. His humour faded as he considered what Dean had said.
“Worse, they ain’t content to keep away from the righteous. Oh no. They hide among us, waiting for any sign of weakness. Ready to pounce. They don’t care who they get, so long as they get their kicks. They was willing defile
Hael had switched her focus back to Castiel. When she started speaking, her words were flat and prepared. “This has gone on long enough, Castiel. We know what you’ve been trying to do with Dean, and we think it’s clear that you’ve failed.”
“It was while you were at Stanford,” enough time has passed that Dean’s only a little embarrassed to admit this. “I was headin’ up that way to, uh, ‘check’ on you when Bobby called and told me about a hunt in L.A. Turned out to be a bust but I stayed on for a couple weeks after to have some fun.”
“Is he in?” the girl snorted. “When’s he not in? Want me to get him? Who should I say is asking?” she was already heading towards the door to the kitchen.
Cas knew he was supposed to go with his father. This time last week, he would’ve, but now he wanted to be as far away as possible from the man. “Yeah sorry, we were going to the library to, um, study.” He tried desperately to keep his tone casual.
“Lord save this sinner!” he called to the sky, a perfect imitation of the Pastor’s self important tone.  “Raise him from Perdition!” He gripped Dean’s shoulder, tightly, as if he really were trying to raise Dean from hell.
“I don’t know,” Dean says in a small voice and suddenly he’s not in front of them anymore – he’s sitting on one of the beds, legs dangling off the side (too short to reach the floor). The gun is clutched tightly across his chest as he stares down the door. “He said that I had to: ‘keep Sammy safe’, ‘keep the door shut tight’ and that if anything ‘cept him tried to come in or out to: ‘shut my eyes and pull the trigger’”
Dean’s eyes are closed, lips drooping lazily. His white chest – already littered with scars and bruises, including a nasty yellow stain spreading over his ribs – rises and falls slowly. One arm dangles idly off the plastic lounger, fingers resting in a loose fist on the ground. A book, the cover and title nothing but a dull smudge of colour, lies next to him, shimmering slightly in heat haze rising from the concrete. The pool and lounger is enclosed by a white ring of plastic fencing, and though there are other chairs, and cars in a distant parking lot, the scene is otherwise empty.
fine. Let’s just get out of here before someone calls the cops.” He could probably walk on his own, but Cas keeps his arms round Dean, supporting him for the short distance to the car and sliding them both into the back seat. Dean fumbles in his pockets for the keys and passes them to Sam, who’s already waiting up front.
He pushes the door all the way open, only to be greeted by a rack of clothes – mostly plaid shirts and dark jeans. Dean glances over his shoulder to Sam and Cas, who look equally nonplussed. After a few confused seconds of standings, they start to carefully push through them, moving through a forest of denim and cotton, until they emerge into a dark, dingy motel bedroom via what turns out to be a closet. The flimsy wicker doors they’ve just come through cast long shadows onto the carpet and up onto the walls as they filter the dirty orange of the streetlight outside, striping the room like a cage.
“Wait, what –” Cassie begins to ask, but Dean’s already put his ear to the receiver and he waves her question off. Jonah, still regarding Dean sadly, vanishes from the scene – as do some of the clothes strewn about the floor.
Dean finally reached the doors. Time seemed to slow as he took a parting glance at the crowd. He saw his father, terrible for the hatred in his eyes.  Uriel and Pastor Walker both wore the same look of pugnacious satisfaction, while Jim practically glowed with vindication. Standing below him, his face the mirror opposite of his father’s, Castiel watched him with unspeakable grief.
“So what are we arguing about, huh? You want to do this, let’s do it!” She starts on the next couple of shirt buttons, but stops again when she sees Cas still isn’t moving. “What now?” she asks, exasperated at this point.
“I always knew there was something wrong with you Winchester.” Gordon was gloating, trying to get a rise out of him. He stared sullenly out the window, doing his best to ignore the older man. “Never would’ve guessed you were a queer though,” The pastor continued. “No, not John Winchester’s boy.”
…everything falls away. The rack, the chains, the knife all vanish. Sam collapses to the ground, clutching at his chest. When he raises a shaking hand to his face, swimming in and out of focus, the fingers are clean and dry. Before he really has time to process anything, something is pulling him roughly to his feet.
“I remember this place,” He says. “Dad dumped us here for a whole summer once. It was probably the only time we were in a motel with a decent pool when the weather was actually good.”
“No, I ain’t gonna just leave it! I ain’t gonna just stand here and watch you rip yourself apart because you’re too stubborn to admit that you’re in the wrong place
hi everyone! sorry for the delay, I've started back at uni now so these past couple weeks (and these next few weeks tbh) have all been a little hectic. hope this chapter was worth the wait.
“No.” Missouri’s firm voice cut across the room, making the both of them jump. Her words were harsh but her tone was kind. “Even if you can somehow convince Sam you ain’t the devil incarnate after everything he’s been taught, even if you can somehow convince the rest of the town of that too it won’t make a damn difference.”
“Oh yeah?” Dean challenged her. “If the universe doesn’t hate me then why did it send me you to deal with?”
Dean laughed. “Well if you’re willing to put up with an over excited redhead with, I’d guess, at least two million intrusive and personal questions, then I can certainly put  you up for the night.”
Dean smiles at him, tears streaming down his face. “Don’t ask questions you don’t want the answer to Sammy.”
“I thought you guys might wanna speed things up – skip straight to the end,” The spell appears next to the demon. He’s still Dean-ish, but it is no longer possible to mistake him for the real thing. His eyes are a glowing, sickly, green and, just as the Dean next to them is fading to nothing at the edges, the spell’s body is dissolving into green smoke, the hands and feet nothing more than insubstantial outlines. He grins a feral grin at the looks on their faces. “What’s the matter? You two don’t like the new look?”
In the corner of the room, also refusing to look at anything but the carpet, John Winchester stood, arms crossed. Cas couldn’t read any emotion on his face, but he shrank from his intensity never the less.
No matter how he acted towards the church, towards his father, Castiel had always believed in God. He needed to, there needed to be Right and Wrong. Otherwise, how would any of them survive?
Missouri kept them talking for hours, letting them go only (reluctantly, and with promises to return that night for dinner) when the sun had reached its highest (and hottest) point in the sky. She caught Sam’s arm as he made to follow Dean out the door, pulling him down to her level so she could whisper. “I know you mean well Sam, really,” she murmured into his ear, “an’ I hope to god he proves me wrong, but I don’t trust your father, and I don’t want to see you or Dean hurt anymore so please, be careful.”
“Well I ain’t gonna be so nice!” he all but shouted. “I’m not afraid to call a spade a spade. They’re perverts, faggots,  inebriates,
Sam opens his mouth to speak, but Dean already knows what he’s going to say. “It’s fine,” he says firmly. “
“I said almost.” A breeze from the lake passes through them. Sam pulls his jacket closer, shivering slightly.
The noise of the real world slowly trickled in. The diner was still busy despite the lack of food. Or maybe
A snort of laughter from Dean had brought emotion back into her voice. “Oh, you may be going to church again but you’re still an arrogant, petulant, disrespectful –”
Dean stands alone in the tunnel by himself –trying to think Bobby back into existence. For all his insistence that he had to do this alone, now that the time has come to actually do it, all he wants is the older man back to snip at him sarcastically from behind. No matter how hard he concentrates, however, Bobby stays gone. No way to go but forward it seems.
“He sure is a screamer, isn’t he? More so in here than out there, I’ll bet. He’s got nothing left to prove down here.”
Pastor Walker turned so he was looking straight into Dean’s eyes. “I’m talking about Hell boy. That’s where you’re both headed. Ain’t you been listening to our sermons? Now you,” he stabbed a thick finger at Dean, “ain’t no shocker. You’ve been a pain in the ass for far too long. Truth be told, we’d all given you up as a lost cause – ‘cept for John of course. But Castiel? He was good, his father’s son through and through. He could’a done the lords work, and done it well, until now. That’s on you Winchester. You ruined that boy’s chance for greater things. He may not see it now, but he will one day. I wonder what he’ll think of you then?”
“Not as far as I’m aware,” Cas says, a little affronted. “And I would appreciate it if you didn’t try to derail the conversation.”
Jimmy was soon back in his spot, a piece of paper crumpled between his hands. “I’m sorry about that folks,” he began. “I had this whole speech prepared, but somethin’ just wasn’t right with it. Now,” he smiled apologetically, “in order for me to explain, I’m gonna have to back up a bit. See, last week or thereabouts, I found a snake in our town.
“Huh?” Sam asks distractedly. They’ve been walking for what feels like hours, and for what feels like miles. But it’s impossible to tell if they’re even moving in the complete blackness. It feels as if their feet are touching something smooth and solid, which Sam hopes fervently, is at least a floor or ground and not just air. Then at least they’d be moving towards (or away) from something. Anything, surely, is better than nothing. “What do you mean?”
“I don’t know. But we can’t stay here.” He’s said, grabbing Castiel’s hand and pulling him away from the school. “We can’t wait for Dad, I don’t think I can be in a car with him.” His voice had cracked at the thought of John, and Sam
“I’ve been told,” he replied perhaps a little too stiffly. He smiled at her, trying to redress the balance. It was hard enough having the surname Novak, being almost a mirror image of his father made it impossible for him to hide.
“Interesting,” Uriel leaned in close so that Sam, who was watching them curiously, couldn’t hear. “He doesn’t seem to know. Or...” his voice turned dangerous. “Or, you’ve already perverted him?”
“I’m sure he’s still hurt,” Cas concedes quickly, wondering if he should reach out to steady Sam’s shaking shoulders. He rests a hand there awkwardly and when nothing bad (or at least worse) seems to happen, he ploughs on. “But just because he’s still upset doesn’t mean that he still blames you. Remember, he never intended you see…all that – it was a vulnerable, private moment where everything was still fresh and raw. The way he saw things then will not be how he sees things now – with the virtue of hindsight and distance,” Cas pauses, and Sam nods, looking a little (though not much) better. Cas hopes it’s an appropriate time to voice his own feelings but he simply cannot ignore them any longer. “I must admit, it was…strange to see Dean like that,” he tries cautiously – and sighs in relief when Sam shoots him a wry smile in understanding.
“I don’t care Dean. I honestly don’t give a shit if you’re sorry or not. I only came with you to get a lift, ok?  Just leave me alone from now on.” She turned and sped into the gym, deliberately not looking back at him.
A gash in the smoke that could be a mouth twists into something that smells vaguely of a smile. “Ah-ha, you must be Sammy – Deano sure does love to scream for you. You know me of course – or you’ve guessed. You were always the smart one.” It steps away and Dean sags in relief, tears streaming from his eyes. He doesn’t say anything, just hangs there panting, heartbeats slowly regaining some form of rhythm.
“He’s too strong,” Cas groans and would fall if not for Dean’s hands keeping him steady and upright.
hand. He’s falling back, scrambling for the exit, he’s chained to the rack and Alistair is smiling fondly down at him – looking vaguely as he did when Sam had killed him, except for the holes in his flesh where black smoke is leaking out, and the white pools he has instead of eyes. He spots the pool of black he came in through, and his fingers reach out to touch it, before Alistair tugs something and his whole body spasms with pain as he fights against his bonds, sprawling on the floor. He tries again and again – and each time Alistair yanks him back to the past. The two realities flicker in and out of each other, but Alistair’s steady hand on his shoulder finally grounds him.
Castiel nodded. Dean felt rather than saw it and pure happiness burst to life inside of him. He felt like he should be glowing in the morning sun.
“Alright then,” John steps back, Mary vanishes, and the sun, sky and pink motel make their eye-watering reappearances. “You’re gonna go find your brother, pack your shit and be ready to leave in half an hour. You got that?”
“What? No you didn’t. I kissed you first.” Castiel couldn’t, wouldn’t let Dean shift the blame onto himself.
Dean breaks first, ducking his head, shoulders shaking. “I can’t bear the idea of you knowing,” he whispers, “if you didn’t know already. And I can’t bear the idea of asking – of knowing if you know.”
“Why d’you care?” he tried to keep his voice calm, flippant. Even to his own ears, he sounded scared.
“That’s the point.” He didn’t understand why Dean wasn’t happy about this. “We won’t know anybody, and they won’t know us. If we go to a city, if we go to New York or California, nobody will care. We’ll just be two kids from Kansas, we’ll blend into the background.”
They edge slowly towards it, both keeping their eyes resolutely trained on the wall in front of them, trying their best to ignore the increasingly loud moans from behind them. Sam’s brain is telling him a lot of important things he doesn’t want to know – like how the song currently playing is one Dean still likes to hum sometimes when he’s been driving for a long time, or that there were too many arms for two people – but he pushes it aside and concentrates on feeling for the curtain with his hand.
Just then, the large float in front of them begins to blast music, lurching ponderously forward. The crowd around them lets out a cheer, as drums and whistles begin to sound. People begin to stream around them: old and young alike grinning wildly and waving flags and banners. Cas pulls him into motion, and they join the throng.
He clung steadfastly his happiness. He didn’t dare move, didn’t dare turn to look at Sam. He couldn’t bear to see his expression, to see fervent hatred that emanated from the man on the podium etched into his brother’s face.
“Naw, I’m just headin’ out of town for the day to do a couple visits,” Jim was pleased at Castiel’s apparent thoughtfulness. “I was going ask you along, but if you and Dean have plans?”
The rustling of clothes, told him the sermon had ended, and he jumped to his feet in relief.  He was nearly at the door when he realised that John was among the small crowd trying to get face to face with Pastor Novak.  He huffed with impatience as he caught up with him and Sam.
“No! He didn’t!” Cas’ indignant cries raised his father’s ire once more. He all but shook his son off the seat as he grabbed him.
“So let me get this straight,” he pointedly ignores Sam’s half smile, “it’s not that there’s a ghost and a pride parade; it’s that there’s a ghost
yay i actually followed through on something for once. score. thanks to everyone who left kudos, it really kept me going.
“Cas!” Dean interrupted again, more forcefully. Castiel came to an abrupt stop, fear clear in his eyes. Dean reached his up to Castiel’s shoulder then, after a moment’s hesitation, stroked his cheek instead, wiping away the tears. “Where’s all this coming from?” He asked gently, “why d’you think I blame you?”
“You can, uh, you can go to my room when we get back. If you want to,” Dean adds hastily. “And rest in ou…my…
“Sammy!” Dean had grabbed his arm, but the sound of his old nickname was enough to silence Sam. “Shut up for a sec ok? I’m not mad.”
The words seemed to stab at Dean, piercing the fragile armour he’d erected that night at the river. He could feel the doubts he’d so far kept at bay creeping in.
Castiel’s ride to the Winchesters was far from silent. His father kept a running commentary all through the ridiculously short drive.
At first, all there is is dark. Slowly, and one by one, his senses creep back in – the way they always had when whoever was in charge that day decided it was time for the fun to start again. Smell first, of course, and not a surprise: sulphur and blood and shit, mixing together into the familiar malaise. Then touch: the air begins to heat his skin, bringing up pinpricks of sweat – creeping in between the layers of his clothes, so that he has to resist the temptation to shrug out of his jacket. The ground begins to texture beneath his feet.
His dread is compounded by the strangled gasp, the involuntary sound of horror, that the Cas next to him lets out as he doubles over, clutching his stomach as if he’s been stabbed. “No,” he moans brokenly, “no.”
Dean pauses in buckling his belt, clearly trying to think of something to say. His silence is answer enough.
“You look like her, y’know?” The words came, echoing cruelly out of the recesses of his memories. They were his father’s, but there was a sadness to them that was eerily out of character for John. He tried to place the memory.
“You don’t think I know that?” Dean can’t keep the frustration from his voice – and it’s not like Bobby doesn’t already know exactly how he’s feeling anyway. “I can
“I guess we won’t ever know,” Dean was feigning nonchalance and Sam let him. The memories were probably painful after all. Besides, there was always later.
In the back row, Sam Winchester’s singing faltered into a series of coughs that continued even as the hymn drew to a close. On his left, Dean’s hands fluttered at his back anxiously while John glared at him pointedly on the right. Sam was still coughing as the congregation took their seats and Pastor Novak took to his stand.
A large circle of well wishers had clustered at the base of the podium yet they parted for him, their faces a mixture of sympathy and curiosity. His father stood at the centre, arm around John Winchester. He cast about for Sam but couldn’t see the youngest Winchester in the crowd.
“Uriel and some friends happened to pass by as you got there.” Jim told him and Cas had to keep himself from snorting. He had no doubt Uriel had been following him.
“I want to kiss you so bad right now,” Dean murmurs – but he doesn’t move so neither does Cas. “But.”
“That’s the Roadhouse, best bar around. Well, it’s the only bar around.” He laughed at his own joke. “And there’s Bobby Singer’s garage, he might have an openin for you, if I ask.”
“There’s an unaffiliated block,” Sam supplies helpfully from the sidelines, “Between Bank of America and Taco Bell. I’ll go find somewhere towards the end to watch and we’ll meet up after ok?”
more alcohol and probably didn’t involve his little brother pretending to be asleep in the background. He pushes the thought (and the morbid curiosity that’s trying to get him to open his eyes) aside as best he can and tries to think himself back to sleep. After a while, it works.
She gave him an odd look at that, but stuck her head into the kitchen nevertheless. Her words were lost in the babble of conversations and cooking so he couldn’t hear exactly what she was saying. A second later, however, she turned back to him. “He wants to know if you’re Lester?”
Sam and Cas, as the door flies off its hinges. It hits the ground with a large metallic clang and then dissipates into nothing, leaving only vaguely scorched grass.
“So much for love thy neighbour... here we go,” Missouri pulled iodine out of the kit, turning towards Dean. “Now this is gonna sting.”
“Well, if you admit to what you did and repent that’ll be it for you. The lord is tolerant of small wrongdoings, so long as you beg his forgiveness.”
haven’t done anything: this is all on your Dean, and it looks like your Dean’s just gotten a little stuck.”
“Yeah I know what you said,” Dean cut him off, perfectly happy not to be reminded of the details. “But you were thirteen: a fucking idiot, like you said. Besides what could you have done? I didn’t want you to go through what I went through: that’s why I left,” he squeezed Sam’s arm, “and you’re here now, that’s the important part.” He waited patiently for Sam to finally meet his eyes again. Sam found them as warm and open as they were in his memories. It was as if a piece of him had been returned: one he hadn’t realised was missing until he had it back. He wondered how he had survived this long without it. He had his big brother again.
Sam spends the first hour sending pointed looks over his shoulder to make Cas check his phone. It takes him half an hour (and Dean nearly swerving off the road) to realise Cas isn’t seeing them because he’s staring at Dean’s eyes in the rear-view mirror (and that Dean is staring back). It takes him another half hour to remember that Cas doesn’t sleep – so his texted plea for privacy is pointless anyway. He doesn’t bother to smother his sigh – it’s going to be a long journey.
3. Americans do not know how to say the word "Abomination". seriously guys, there's an "i" in the middle it's not "A-bomb-nation"
“’K good,” Dean breathes an exaggerated sigh of relief. “’Cos, lemme tell ya, I don’t wanna go through that ag-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g –” his voice catches abruptly, repeating on a rapid loop – as if it’s playing on an old, scratched CD.
Inside was slightly better. The peeling chairs and faded carpet didn’t inspire much confidence, but the shelves were clean and the books well ordered. There were conspicuous gaps in them, he realized as he looked around. The theology shelf was particularly patchy.
“No.” He said firmly, almost before Cas had finished talking. “Besides, it’s not your fault. I’m the one who kissed you.”
The lighter in Sam’s hand flickers out, plunging them back into darkness, allowing them to move again.
“Yes,” Cas says firmly. “You tried to distract us and it didn’t work. Dean, the real Dean, is fighting you even from wherever you think you’ve trapped him.”
“Sit down Castiel. Right in the middle here.” He propelled his protesting son into the ring, standing over him until he sat, glaring at his father.
There’s a soft tapping on the window. “He said that you should wake him,” Cas says, voice slightly muffled by the glass. “He wants to do it now too.”
He’d always pushed it down, pretended nothing had happened. If he ignored it, it’d go away. He’d be normal. That’s all he’d ever wanted. To be normal.
On cue, a hand forces it way out the ground, smeared with mud and blood. Slowly, it’s followed by a gasping, leather-clad figure. Dean watches himself warily as he heaves himself onto the grass and takes his first real breath in 40 years, eyes blinking up at a sun he only dimly remembers. Bobby takes a step forward, but Dean throws a hand out. “Hold on, give me a moment.”
at a normal life, doesn’t know what he’s missed out on’,” Dean takes a deep, shuddering breath. “Well that’s not true, ok? I know how to defend myself and what I love – I wasn’t afraid to stand up to him when it really counted, to stand up for you. And I wasn’t afraid to make my other life – even if it was only in the in-betweens. I just decided one was more important, just like you have,” Dean points at Sam, eyes flashing. “It was
He moved boxes for her as she returned the books deemed ‘unacceptable’ to their places. “Does she do this every time you go away?” he asked as he set the latest crate at her feet.
Pastor Novak slammed his hand against the podium, and Dean jumped, guiltily looking around to make sure his Dad hadn’t seen that he’d been day dreaming again. But John, like the rest of the congregation, had his eyes glued to the Preacher, enraptured.
Sam only smiled, “Yeah,” he said, turning back to Jim. “Today was really great Pastor Jim, thank you.”
Cas was trying not to lose his balance and fall on top of Dean. He was slightly smaller than the blond boy, and had to reach up. It was causing his legs to shake slightly and he didn’t know how long he could keep this up.  He felt Dean pull back, his breath was warm on Cas’ cheek, and the two split apart. Frustrated at their own incompetence, they sat side by side, backs against the wall.
The meal was bad: the chicken was dry, the beans soggy and overdone.  Castiel hoped that John wasn’t the regular cook. He gave up after a few mouthfuls, spreading the rest guiltily across his plate. Dean seemed determined to clean his plate as quickly as possible, and he kept his kept his beautiful eyes pointed downwards.
Uriel and the others were approaching, but Hael remained close to his side. In fact, she was pushed closer as someone, Michael he thought, took the space next to her. Hael was talking animatedly to him already, and Castiel was able to sink into his own thoughts.
“We know you’re real Dean,” Sam breaks in, reaching out to try and touch Dean, who takes another quick step backwards. “We’re real too, ok, we promise.  And we don’t want to hurt you either. We just need to go through that door and – ”
She’d said as much to the angel as she’d dragged him up the stairs – the wood creaking ominously beneath their combined weights – perhaps more than she should’ve because he looks confused and overwhelmed. Still he doesn’t stop her like they both know he could without blinking. He allows himself to be pulled into the old master bedroom – the only room in the house with a bed left. It’s a little rusty, but she’d already had Cas clean the mattress and find her some bedding when they’d gotten here, so she reckons it’ll do.
They both stood in silence, trying to figure out what it all meant, until a car pulled up opposite them.
They’d arrived at church in time to slide into a front pew, on the opposite side of the church from Cas. Dean watched him whenever he thought John wasn’t looking, noting Uriel’s absence and the easy way Jim was ordering his papers at the podium.  Their conversation must have gone well. Now it was Dean’s turn.
Castiel had seen Dean too. He felt a swell of relief at the familiar blond head, a flash of green as Dean had looked around. But then Dean had headed into the school alone, and one of Uriel’s insistent hands was tugging at his sleeve, the other gesturing to some new teenager he had deemed essential to meet.
Wordlessly, Cas embraces him: holding him upright until the worst of the shaking has subsided. Then, he eases Dean gently back onto his feet, guiding him back towards the impala. There isn’t really a question of who can drive – so he deposits Dean on the right hand side before sliding gingerly behind the wheel. “Be gentle with me, and with him,” he murmurs, running his hand along the dashboard like he’s seen Dean do. It’s probably his imagination, but the car seems to rumble something in response.
Dean, no doubt mindful of Sam, has put his head in his hands, leaning forward. His shoulders shake with the force of his suppressed sobs – and Cas places a comforting hand on his knee, squeezing gently. The car hits a pothole, and he sees Sam’s eyes blearily open at the sudden motion. For a moment of gentle confusion, he regards the scene in front of him – his eyes widening ever so slightly when they make it to Dean’s shaking form. Promptly, Sam closes his eyes again, turning around until he’s facing the leather of the seat. Cas feels a small twinge of relief – mostly that Dean hasn’t seemed to notice – as well as a swell of affection for Sam. They ride on in near silence for a little while – though at some point Dean puts his hand on top of Cas’, clasping his fingers tightly in his own.
Cas chuclked, the sound vibrating through both of them. “I wondered when you’d remember. Last week I got a post card with the golden gate bridge on it. It gave me the address of your diner” he said. He disentangled himself from the bed reluctantly, searching through the pockets of his trench coat.
Dean shrugs. “Cas does. All I know is that it feels like the clouds have gone and the sun is out for the first time in years. Maybe they’ll come back, maybe not.”
“Yeah, me too,” Dean nodded. “I’ll go home tomorrow,” he saw Cas’ face, “during the day.” He rushed to reassure him.  “I’m not that dumb. I’ll grab some clothes, some stuff I can sell.”
It’s impossible to know if they’re going in the right direction, but they shuffle dutifully forward, stumbling once or twice over uneven ground (the only real indication that they’re even moving at all). Sounds begin to creep in around them – disturbing for their muffled gentleness and banality. The slow, soft dripping accompanied by the low whine of metal swaying (not unlike a port at night time) is almost serene, and this (more than the screams and wails he was expecting ever could’ve) unnerves Sam. Underneath it all is a distant, scattered drum beat – echoing off the walls around them so that it’s coming from everywhere at once.
Dean’s only answer is to spit in his face. Sam’s breath freezes in his throat and it’s only the distant awareness that this has already happened that stops his fear for Dean overwhelming all sensible thought.  There’s dead silence as the blood-soaked saliva spatters Lucifer’s (Cas’) cheek and begins to ooze slowly down. With a stunned expression that would be comical if it weren’t also so deadly, Lucifer raises his fingers to his face, as if he can’t actually believe what has just happened. Dean takes the opportunity to throw himself to the side, rolling away and managing to spring to his feet with surprising speed and agility. He reaches back and pulls a knife – an angel blade – from his waistband in one smooth movement, breaths heavy but steady. The presence of a weapon, however ineffectual it may turn out to be, between him and Lucifer seems to steady him. Lucifer regards him, a slight smile pulling at his still bloodied lips.
Cas frowned in mild confusion and panic. “A girlfriend I don’t – “ his expression cleared abruptly and he groaned. “Hael,” he explained. “I said I’d go to some dance with her and now she’s acting like we’re married. How did you find out?”
“You know we can’t promise that,” Sam pleads futilely, “but so what? Just because things will change doesn’t mean it’ll be for the worse. We can get through this and things will be better.”
“That’s what this felt like,” Sam takes the lighter but keeps it in his hand for now. “Except the reason I couldn’t see the mountains was because I was
“How is it that you two always know exactly what I need?” Dean asks playfully, leaning back into the man’s touches.
“Uh yeah, I guess.” Shit, now he would have to actually go with her. “I haven’t properly asked her yet though. She might say no.” He entertained the brief hope that she would.
“And to think all it took was getting magically trapped in my own brain and having to stab you in the heart to get out.”
They had shifted even closer, pressing their shoulders together, their heads bent so close they were touching. Neither of them had initiated this. They hadn’t even noticed.
They walk in silence, Sam watches Dean, Cas watches Sam watching Dean and Dean watches the floor. The doors they pass are all the same, except for the dates – which don’t appear to be in any sort of discernible order. Dean obviously knows exactly where they’re going, however, for he never even glances to either side. Cas, more to pass the time than anything else, tries to see if he can match any specific strings of numbers to any particular events or memories, but few are even remotely familiar to him – as an angel he’d never needed to pay much attention to the ridiculously small increments humans bisect their time with, and even now he tends to class the world along the calendars of crisis that defines most of the Winchesters’ existence rather than by days, months or years.
“I’d like that,” he smiles. “Whatever we end up as, as long as it’s with you I’ll be happy,” he hesitates, unwilling to break the peaceful mood, but also unwilling to proceed on uncertainty. “I want to say one more thing, however. It’s not me trying to back out of this – it’s something I want us to be sure of.”
But Alistair only shrugs. “Depends on the game you’re playing. Now, hush for the moment...” He regards Sam critically – tilting his head and squinting at him. “Maybe,” he murmurs to himself, “ it was a little to the left? No, No. But perhaps…” he flicks his fingers, and the rack screeches back a couple of feet, so that Dean is out of reach. Alistair nods in satisfaction. “There. That’s exactly how it was the last time,” he walks to stand next to Dean, but faces away from him, still looking at Sam.
would conspire to keep you two away from anything that might give you insight into my mind and help us escape?”
“Besides,” the spell says, “you guys probably won’t even die for real – Just wake up in the real world without me. Probably” he adds again off-handedly, shrugging.  “Works best for everyone.”
The him in the rack makes a small groan from the back of his throat, eyes squeezing shut. Dean decides this means yes.
“Shut up,” Sam says, but in that tone (the one he shares with Dean) he always uses when someone or something has hit a little too close to home. Dean’s smile only widens.
Hating himself for every word of but knowing he had to he said: “And thank you, for... for...saving me. From myself.”
After school, he’d walked the short distance from his house to Pastor Novak’s. They lived on the other side of town, in a large house next to the church, but it was only a ten minute walk. There wasn’t enough town to make anything far away.
They settle comfortably into the middle of the crowd, and Dean plucks the tie out of Cas’ other hand. “Let me do it,” he says, “you’re hopeless at these things.”
“Huh,” he surveys the scene in front of him, “who knew the inside of my brain was so…ineffable?” He squints slightly, and the tunnel melts into the familiar interior of the bunker: the golden lights dim, flatten, and stretch into doors: each with a long series of numbers on the front. “There,” Dean says, satisfied. “That’s a bit easier to work with conceptually, ain’t it?”
Hester murmured a soft agreement, clearly uncomfortable to be caught up in this. Castiel dithered. The silence dragged out awkwardly as Hael watched him, her face slowly falling as he did not jump immediately to his Father’s defence.  Eventually, mercifully, Dean saved him.
“No,” Alistair’s voice distorts – his human form collapsing them reforming. He tries to pull Dean back – but strong, tan arms encircle him, wrenching him away.
The rest of the drive passes quickly. Sam occasionally looks over at Dean, who’s watching the road. His relaxed posture is a familiar one, especially behind the wheel, but Sam’s sure there’s an ease, a lightness that wasn’t there before. The rest of the time he stares out the window – watching the outlines of mountains roll by.
“Come here Sam,” Missouri pulled the other Winchester down into a hug of his own, “it’s good to see you. How’s Stanford? How’s Jess?”
They left separately, Castiel dawdling to put his book back. He wished Missouri had been there, but they’d see her when she got back. For now, he needed to concentrate on what he would say to his father.
Cas’ hands still and he looks at her sharply. “Is that what you think would happen?” He asks slowly, “Is that why you want to copulate?”
He reached the bank where he, Sam and Cas he skimmed stones. His feet were cold, he’d forgotten his shoes.
“What I did can’t ever be forgiven,” Dean says flatly. “And I stopped trying to forgive myself a long time ago. I know I held out for as long as I could (which was nowhere near long enough) and I know I’ve done some good since I got back…but I still don’t feel any better about it so don’t try to make me.”
“Hey,” Sam harrumphs. That prompts a watery chuckle and weak smile as young Dean nods – old Dean beams back.
He wanted to grab his father, to shake him and rage until John had to acknowledge him, to acknowledge the seventeen years between them.  He took a step forward. John didn’t move. He took a second then a third. By the fourth, he was close enough to touch.
“Just a…spell,” even as he says it, Dean feels the words slipping away. The rack beneath him is solid and familiar, recognizably real. He doesn’t understand what he just said, or why it feels like he just got here. He’d been somewhere before this, it feels like, but it’s all wrong – like a dream. The details don’t make sense. He’d been too old, too alive. Sam had been too tall, the hair too long. And Cas… Who was Cas?
“Oh I dunno, might be worth a try,” He’d chimed in. “We can just go up to Michael on Monday: ‘hey you a queer? Wanna be our friend?’ we’ll have slumber parties, braid each other’s hair, the whole deal.” They had been too busy laughing to take in Missouri’s reaction. Dean often wondered if seeing it would have made the truth of their situation apparent much, much earlier. If it would’ve saved them the pain and grief that was to come.
He realised that the way Hael was looking at him had changed. The placid curiosity had been replaced by something more dynamic, calculating. “Castiel,” she said slowly. “Do you know about the dance on Thursday?”
Dean fell silent, head reeling. It would be so easy to pretend, to fake remorse, to ‘repent’ so that everything could go back to normal. But the very thought of it, of going back to the fake life and the fake feelings made him want to die. He couldn’t live a lie, not again.
“Doesn’t matter: we acted like he was mine. For the first few months, I was so fucking terrified I’d do what Dad did. I couldn’t even tell him to take out the trash without freaking out that I’d been too harsh: that he was only doin’ it because he was scared of me. But I couldn’t explain why, not even to myself. I didn’t even know enough to know that I was scared, I just felt this tension building inside me and I didn’t know when it was going to burst through. Then…” Dean stops again, hands twisting into knots in his lap.  “He and Lisa had a fight about something – I don’t remember what. A school trip maybe.
“I have no idea who he is,” Sam confesses. “I didn’t even know Dean was into uh…this kind of stuff.”
Sammy and Dad...they wanted believe there was somewhere better. But they hadn’t seen the look in Mom’s eyes. He still dreamt about that look. What kind of God would do that to his Mom? She hadn’t deserved the pain, and neither had he.
“Weird, I know, but I needed Sammy to feel comfortable going to this sleepover.” The scene had shifted abruptly. He was outside Cas’ house now. It was dark. Cas was leaning against the door frame, smiling.
Last time he’d spoken to Pastor Walker it hadn’t ended well. Though Dean doubted the man would actually follow through on any of his curses, he didn’t want rekindle the animosity between them, especially in front of Castiel and his Father. That was why he’d left without knocking he told himself. Not because he was scared. He
The Cas in front of Dean just shakes his head. “It’s ok. It doesn’t hurt me anymore,” he pauses. “I don’t expect you to love me back – especially after all that I’ve done. I just wanted to say it in case I don’t–” his voice cuts off as Dean kisses him.
“Don’t worry about me Cas, I’ll cope with whatever they throw at me. If it’s easier you should just push it all on to me.”
Dean was happy to take advantage of the situation too. John was thrilled, he knew, at Castiel’s interest, and home life was relaxing back towards the way it had been. John had even agreed to let Dean drive to the school dance on his own, which saved him from awkward conversation between Anna and his Dad.
Jim ate slowly, as if he were savouring every bite, nodding sagely at Sam and breaking in with his own comments from time to time. He was deliberately ignoring John’s pleading gaze, Castiel thought, wanting to bask in Sam’s admiration for as long as possible. Eventually however, his plate was clean and he sat back with a satisfied smile. Dean’s sigh of relief was deliberately audible as he jumped to his feet, practically smashing the plates together in his hurry to clear the table.
“He’s a weird guy. Now, I’m gonna head home and get some food for me and Dean. Cas, are you staying?”
wants you to go. Now hurry up and leave,” he lies back on the hood of the impala, “I got shit to do.”
Cas could hear the anger in Dean’s voice, or maybe it was projection of his own rage. Either way, he wanted the conversation over before it could start. “Is everything alright Dad?” He was back to his ‘dutiful son’ persona, “do you need anything?”
Dean grimaces as his gaze moves from Sam to Cas’ face. “Yeah,” he grits out. “But in case you’ve forgotten I’m stuck in my own damn head where I can’t fucking lie and
Dean shrugs with a poorly faked nonchalance. “You saw how he raised me, Sam: half son half soldier. He taught me how to shoot when I was five – he left you alone with me when I was six. He started taking me with him when I was
He pulled Castiel’s lips onto his again, deliberately this time. The other boy responded enthusiastically, pressing closer.
He had opened his mouth to retort, still not entirely sure what he was going to say, when the kitchen doors opened.
“Same thing happened to my old server,” he remembered some of the stories that Kevin had told him, fists clenching involuntarily. “I’m sorry.”
The next time he’s semi-conscious, the whole sky is purple and there’s a sheep floating in front of his face, mooing. He thinks he’s probably dreaming. He closes his eyes.
They exchange one of those looks they’ve been exchanging almost as long as they’ve known each other – the ones that always make Sam feel as if he’s watching them from outside of thick a glass box – one that he can see into but they can’t see out of. Normally it exasperates him, to be so removed from the conversation: to remain a helpless, unwanted observer to what has always been blindingly obvious (to him and, it seems, others). Now, however, he finds himself glad to be excluded from this exchange, happy for it to remain non-verbal in his presence.
The rest of drive is peaceful. At some point Dean leans back in the seat, stretching his legs out. “I think I really need to sleep he says,” a little apologetically. “I’m fucking exhausted, and Sam’ll want to talk when we get home.”
Belatedly, it occurs to Dean that maybe this parade isn’t just for him, that maybe it’s for a newly human(ish), newly adrift(ish) Castiel. That maybe Cas needs something more tangible than half-heard I love you’s murmured into his back while they drift off to sleep.
“Of course, where else would he be?” she gestured towards the back room. “He’s sleeping right now, but he won’t mind if you wake him.”
Hael relaxed at that. “Thank you Castiel,” she grabbed his hand, “C’mon, you needn’t be over here by yourself, not anymore.”  She dragged him across the room, depositing him in an empty chair next to Uriel.
Content Warning: non-consensual, kinda gruesome kiss between Dean/Lucifer (as Cas) in this chapter. it starts at 'his voice cuts off' and ends with 'with and pained and garbled cry' tho there is also some p bloody descriptions of wounds in that paragraph if u wanna be careful, xoxo stay safe boobalas.
He sees, out the corner of his eyes, Sam and Cas exchange a look. Maybe it’s not a good idea (it’s probably not a good idea) but the thought of leaving himself here; of knowing this is where he’ll always be…it’s not something he thinks he’ll be able to survive.
Jim’s attention snapped back to his son. “No son, you need to listen. Not to me, not to that Winchester fag but to God. You know what you’re doing is bad, you just ain’t accepted it. And by doin that you ain’t just taking yourself to hell, you’re hinderin my efforts to save others. You think anyone’s gonna listen to a Preacher with a queer for a son?  Stop thinkin of just yourself.”
After what feels like an age, his hand brushes the soft fabric. He turns to face it, pulling the curtain aside, but the window stops after just a few inches of glass – fading back into the wall exactly where the curtain (once free to hang) begins. Through the glass he can see the faint outline of a quiet looking street – nice houses, cheap cars – though it too fades into nothing after half a block or so. “What the hell?”
,” Dean snaps. “And if I look too close I’ll get stuck just like before. You guys need to find me – and not try to have a heart to heart after every little piece of angst. C’mon,” he jerks away from them, walking towards the large pink building.
The church was already crowded when they arrived. There were even more people than last week, no doubt drawn by Jim’s radio broadcast of a few days earlier. Dean caught sight of a familiar dark head near the doorway and his heart leapt. Perhaps they would be able to talk earlier after all.
“Dean, come on.” Sam was exasperated. “I haven’t seen you in ten years and that’s all you can tell me?”
“Well, I’m not really much of an angel anymore,” yet the words don’t fill him with the gloom they normally do. “And after all these years, human is hardly an insult.”
“You did this for me,” Sam ignores Alistair, ignores the first flashes of pain and the warm bursts of blood. All he lets himself be aware of is Dean. Dean’s shaking hand, his clammy skin, his ragged breaths, the black hole in his chest. “For thirty years you’ve been doing this for me. You always do this for me. This time, let me do this for you. We’ll get through it. We always get through it. Ok?” He meets Dean’s eyes and tries to push everything into them from his own.
“Been doin’ ok, Pastor, all things considered,” John said and Dean rolled his eyes. Of course they hadn’t been doing ok, but John Winchester would never admit that.
“I just wanna make sure we aren’t gonna cause Dean actual, y’know, brain damage by stomping through his synapses.”
“Castiel, we would like to talk to you.” She’d informed them. She’d thrown Dean a venomous look. “Alone.”
“We can find another way.  There’s always another way,” Dean insists, ducking his head slightly to meet Cas’ wavering gaze. “You don’t have to do this,” his voice cracks. “I need
sorry this is late, i've been sick and my country fucked itself over so it's not been the best week for me.
Startled, Sam stumbles back, but Dean remains frozen in place: still slumped as if leaning on a shoulder that’s no longer there, mouth opening and shutting with impossible speed. The bar around them is beginning to glitch and crack: the noise cutting to static, arms and tables shrinking, growing, changing colour and bumping into each other.
“Cas don’t look,” Sam says, gripping his shoulder and trying to pull him away. “It’s only going to get worse, don’t look.”
“We have friends. We have family. We have you.” He couldn’t remember now if he’d been joking or not.
Unlike the previous two scenes, a new reality does not immediately impose itself upon them. Instead, Sam and Cas are back to walking through nothing – though a distant, warm light is at least giving them something to aim for. They walk, in silence, both desperate to speak, but waiting for the other to go first. This is Sam’s more than his, Cas knows, yet without his grace suppressing the rawness of his emotions he’s finding it hard to hold everything back – and he can tell Sam wants to speak yet is too muddled to really start. Eventually, Sam figures it out.
“Shut up and bacon sounds nice. Do we have time?”  “We’ve got ages, Dad’s not even up yet.” Dean’s hands seemed to move of their own accord as he talked. Soon the bacon was frying happily on the pan, the smell wafting through the small house.
“Mom died, and I had no one. Eventually I met my husband.” She laughed hollowly. “He needed a cook: I needed noise in the house. I thought if I pretended I was happy, that I was normal, eventually we would be. I don’t think we’ve spoken five words to each other in the past ten years.” She clasped Dean’s hand in hers. “I won’t let you make the same mistakes Dean. Sam’ll survive, you won’t.”
Inwardly, Sam smiled in relief. Life was much easier when John and Dean got along. The conversation faded as they ate, each of them retreating into their own thoughts.
Hael seemed kind at least. She asked questions and even managed to appear mildly interested in his answers. “So why did you move here?” She was asking now. Castiel struggled to remember the answer his dad wanted him to give.
“Dean this is serious. I don’t know what to do, what to think. Everything’s changed. I don’t know we’re going to get back to normal.”
It’s all a bit absurd – Cas is still wearing his trench coat, Dean’s shirt is still bloody. Still, Sam thinks as he drops into a vacant armchair, it’s a Winchester absurdity through and through.
“Castiel wait,” Missouri grabbed his hand, stopping him in his tracks. “You’re right, but if you go to him it’ll only cause trouble.”
closing the kitchen? You. Has hell frozen over?” She was looking at Sam with equal parts awe and suspicion. “Just who is this guy?”
Castiel surveyed the house as he passed. There was a definite absence here. Perhaps it was the empty coat peg by the door; or the pile of unopened mail; or the empty spaces on the bookshelf, but someone had been deliberately removed from the house. Though Mary, he assumed, still beamed at him from photo after photo that adorned every flat surface or wall, her belongings, her life, were conspicuously absent.
“Well I say that’s bull. That’s just their last ditch attempt to hide what they really are which is weak.  Each and every one of us is sent temptation everyday. That lady who smiles at you in the street, your neighbour’s fancy new oven, that feelin’ when you stub your toe and you just want to shout out the Lord’s name,” more laughs.
“I’m not gonna lie to you son, it won’t be easy. You’ll need to do a lot to make up for your transgressions against god”.
“The library seems as good an idea as any,” Dean suggested as they made their way slowly round the church. “We don’t actually have to study though do we?”
“I hope not,” Sam says fervently. “I think I’ve learned more about you in the last day than in the last thirty years combined.”
Dean’s mouth quirks up at that, and he even looks as if he’s considering her suggestion, but then the phone starts up again – its harsh ringtone shattering the gentle atmosphere – and face tightens with worry once more.
“No.” He had answered without thinking, but Castiel knew instantly it was true. “I...” he thought about his father’s sermon, the anger he had felt. “I think... I thought I knew what was right and wrong; I thought I knew what God wanted. But... it all comes from my father, and what he thinks. What we did... when we kissed, it felt right to me. But according to everyone else, it’s wrong.”
The sound of a door slamming snapped Dean out of the half doze the radio had lulled him into. He rose to his feet, at something of a loss over what he was supposed to be doing in the first place. John appeared in the doorway, his face oddly placid.
going down well in many other places) and the small pile of books in the window (which had its blinds pulled mostly down) but otherwise it was a normal diner: tacky, garish and loud yet charming because of these things. The people too looked more or less normal, at least at first. There was an awful lot of leather. Two men (
“There is no understanding a boy like that,” Uriel hissed, as if he were talking about some kind of ghoul instead of a teenager.
“Will take us into the astral plane proper, where I should be able to use my grace to bring us back to the real world.”
“Sorry,” Dean gasped out eventually. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to – it’s just, you don’t exactly look like the fightin’ sort.” He was right, Castiel knew, but it still stung a little and spurred him on further than he’d originally intended. His father didn’t like him talking about this, didn’t want Castiel’s embarrassing past known.
Then he remembered it was only so he could see Cas again, and the guilt had come rushing in. He wondered what they would say, how they would feel, if they knew the truth. He pushed the thought aside. They wouldn’t know. Ever.
She looked at him in disbelief, her mouth open slightly in complete surprise. “What’s wrong?” she asked, dangerously slow. “You need to ask what’s wrong?”
“Is this the end?” Cas’ voice was small. “Of us, I mean.” His mind had raced far ahead of his body: a thousand scenarios of what awaited them ran through his head.
Silhouetted against the wall, a couple groped and pulled at each other in the night air. Castiel turned away from the writing mass and set off towards the grass. Soon they were both sitting, side by side, as the night darkened around them.  They sat in companionable silence, each enjoying the other’s company.
“Alright, you’ve got me interested: What is it?” Dean asks, heart beating with fear and anticipation, excitement and pain.
manage, I won’t even want to come with you anyway, meaning you’ll be stuck in here forever. I’m just here to make things easier. For you and for me,” his voice is almost kind.
He’s young – younger than Sam’s ever remembered him being – and (though his face is clouded with some unintelligible emotion: his eyes unusually bright, shoulders hunched against more than just the cold) there’s a lightness about him (in his posture which, even hunched, seems straighter; in his face, which is smooth and easy – quicker to smile than to frown) that Sam suddenly realises he’s been missing fiercely for years – ever since hell, ever since Dean had the weight of the world put on his shoulders. The years between this now (then) and their now have rarely seemed so heavy to Sam as when he looks at this younger version of his brother, and he can feel them pressing in on all sides – making a part of him just want to lie down and sleep forever. Dean stares at Sam and Sam stares at Dean, until Dean breaks the contact: bringing the cigarette to his lips, tilting his head back to watch the blueish smoke drift across the almost empty sky.
There was nothing else to do either. Everyone was weirdly invested in this dance, even Benny and Meg, who were no doubt sucking face somewhere inside. He would have to take his chances. Maybe, he thought hopefully, Hael had had enough of being ignored too, and had ditched Cas for someone more attentive.
Dean nods and slows to a stop, shooting him a silent thank you, while Cas narrows his eyes in suspicious confusion. Sam makes a great show of fishing his headphones out of a pocket and turning the volume on his phone up loud as Cas takes his space up front.
It wasn’t until the end of the day that he saw Dean again. The final bell had rung, and the hallways were slowly emptying as everyone piled out into evening sun. He was dawdling, trying to catch a few moments of peace and quiet before Hael or Uriel found him, when he spotted Dean. His heart leapt, and he sped towards the other boy, trying to reach him before someone appeared to spirit him away.
“Great,” Dean says sarcastically. “That’s just great. But something tells me that’s the best deal I’m going to get?”
“And be there when John comes back? From church? No fucking way,” Dean cut in, uncomfortable memories of his last Sunday morning with John churning inside him. “Let’s go the library.”
you?” Sam feels his hand tighten involuntarily into a fist. He wishes their father was in front of them so he could punch something softer than the metal of the impala but harder than the air in front of him.
“I don’t know, Castiel. It seems to me like you aren’t as committed to this as you say. You were plenty keen to defend that snake in church and I don’t want you thinkin’ you can have it both ways: you can’t protect him and be saved.” Jimmy placed both hands on Cas’ shoulders. “It’s a terrible sin to lie to your father. It’s a terrible sin to lie to the lord. I can’t afford to have you flakin’ on me the minute it gets hard. The path to salvation is long an’ tortuous. I need you on that path.”
There were too many cars parked on the driveway. Cas tried to remember if Jim had mentioned an interview or meeting for today. It wasn’t the kind of thing his father would neglect to tell him, especially if there were photographers. Still, this would probably make it easier for Castiel: if Jim was entertaining guests he wouldn’t notice that Cas had gone until it was too late.
From the tone of Gordon’s voice, he could tell he was winding down. The crowd, which had murmured somewhat in bewilderment beforehand, broke into applause. It wasn’t the screaming adoration they reserved for Jim, but it was enough that Gordon was justified in his smug smile as he stepped down.
He prowled restlessly through the sleeping house. It only added to the confusion within him. He needed space, he needed air. Still in his pyjamas he crossed the back yard, through the gate and down to the river. It was still dark, the stars burned dispassionately above him, same as they always did.
“Sorry, I forgot until now, but I’m going to Ruby’s house tonight. Her Mom’s gonna pick us up” Sam blushed slightly, “we’re going to, um, study.” Dean snorted in obvious disbelief, causing Sam to redden further.
Dean shushed him, determined to snoop a little first. The walls were covered in pictures, mostly of cities and crowds. He spotted a battered looking camera on the window sill, next to an equally scruffy teddy bear.
“Yeah Dean, course.” He turned to leave, pausing as one last thought occurred to him. “Dean, do you think you’ll ever find Castiel?”
“They’re also the first place you’d look,” Bobby points out. “This spell is smart, and it knows you. Shit, it
“I don’t think that’s possible,” Sam points out. “At least this way, we know we’re somewhere, even if it’s the wrong direction.”
“I know. Trippy – right??” He says casually, seemingly unconcerned by their reactions. “But I think it makes my point.”
“What’s the matter?” He’d asked, unable to help himself. “Need help with a book burning or something?” beside him, Cas had laughed, causing both Hael and Dean’s cheeks to flush. For him, it had been pleasure at the sound. For her, it had been anger.
He’d gone to knock on the door when he’d spotted a familiar tall figure through the front windows. Gordon Walker didn’t look much like his son, apart from the age difference he had a slimmer build than his son, but the perpetual look of pomposity made their relation clear to any outsiders. Dean hesitated, hand still poised to knock.
The girl frowned over her pad. “That it? Sure you don’t want some pancakes or something? They’re the best in the country: believe me,” she smiled wanly, “I’ve had ‘em all over and these are the best.”
In front of them, Dean laughs softly as the man presses in close and whispers something in his ear. Sam catches Cas staring at him out of the corner of his eyes.
I've been working on this for ages and, frankly, it's gotten to the point where it just needs to be posted before it's nitpicked into oblivion. I might reread it again when i'm less tired and make some changes. But i also might fully not.
But instead John just grunted, before turning away and walking back into the house. Sam and Dean exchanged confused glances before following: Sam scrambling to catch up to their father, Dean hesitating in the doorframe, before forcing his feet forward.
But Cas wasn’t coming, he knew that now. He beat ineffectual fists against the ground, wishing the cracks would open and swallow him whole.
“Yes?”  Alistair smiles, widely. For a brief moment, his eyes become human again, shining with triumph. “Yes, what?”
“Put it back,” Cas hisses, trying to free his arms and pick it up, his voice barely audible over Dean’s heaving sobs. “Put it back you vile –”
Even so, he found sleep elusive that night. When he did, eventually, drift off his dreams were fitful, uneasy.
“Humans will always be a mystery to me,” Cas muses, “and your brother is no exception: it turns out. I thought I knew him well, but really I only know a part of him. And such a small part. I had no idea that inside what I’ve seen he was so…big.” That’s not quite the right way to put it – and he gestures hopelessly at the space around him with the vague hope that it will convey the rest – that to be so surrounded by Dean is to somehow be so far from Dean.
“Well then you best start looking boy,” Bobby grunts, “cos the longer they’re in here, the more likely they are to find stuff you don’t want them to see. And the longer that spell has you all twisted up with it, the more control it’ll get.”
Finally, sight. There’s no particular light source, just a dim redness – like light on closed eyelids – that pics out the faint outline of a space that could maybe be a cave, or maybe a dungeon – though the edges are dissolving into smoke. The rack emerges from the darkness in long flowing lines, sketching itself into existence as he moves towards it. He knows it so intimately – every bump and grove, every crack in the leather. Throughout all his memories of hell it was one of the few constants, remaining even as the scenes and figures above or around him had shifted from one horror to another, slamming him back to reality on the rare occasions he was allowed to believe he had escaped. Even now he still dreams of it, and his skin itches against the sensation that he’s back.
John makes a noise of disgust, running a hand through his messy hair and glaring at his eldest son. “I gave you one job Dean,
“The spell said…” Sam hesitates, not wanting to make this worse, but also not wanting to sugarcoat what’s coming. “…It said that the exit was in your ‘dead centre’.”
… Cas’ fingers are gentle as he winds her hair around them, guiding rather than pulling her head so it’s tilted up towards him. He stops after that, close enough that all she has to do is lean forward ever so slightly until their lips are touching. One half of her expects him to yield and the other half is waiting for him to surge forward, so it catches her by surprise when he just waits. Neither pulling away nor pushing forward, but meeting her exactly. She deepens the kiss, bringing her own hands up around the back of his head and pulling him closer. He matches her intensity, leaning in so they’re pressed up against each other.
“…Charlie’ll stay on my sofa for as long as she needs it, I love the kid,” Dean found himself saying, “but there’s no way in hell I’d let her in my diner alone. Besides, it’s not safe for him here anyway.”
“What do want Hael?” Cas had asked wearily. “Whatever you want to ask me, just say it now. I’m sick of playing your games.”
He and Cas had left class as soon as the bell rung, not wanting to be ambushed by Hael again.  They’d hidden around the back of the school, waiting for John to pick them up.
“Now, Missouri Mosley ain’t the kind of person my Son should be associating with at any point, but do you know who Uriel saw leave the library not twenty minutes later?” Cas didn’t reply. “I’ll tell you who he saw: It was Dean Winchester.”
Bobby steps up to the portal, but his hand refuses to pass through. “Looks like I’ve done all I can,” he says sadly, shaking his head. “Is there anything I can say that’ll make you stop?”
Sam shifted in his seat uncomfortably. “Um…Pastor Novak suggested it so that we could watch his broadcasts while he was away. Had a deal worked out with a local supplier so they were cheap.” He tensed at the mention of Castiel’s father, but Dean only chuckled grimly.
Like the streets, the house felt unbearably quiet and empty. He turned the radio on, letting a news broadcast fill the silence. It was typical Sunday nothing, the world was going on same as ever even as his crashed and burned.
She hugged him tightly to her chest, feeling the little resolve he had left crumble as he started to cry. She held him close, until his sobs had subsided into small shakes.
“S’ok. It killed me that I couldn’t do this earlier.” He’d pulled Cas’ face up towards him for a long, drawn out kiss. They’d gotten much better since their first awkward attempts; they’d gotten good at tuning the world around them as well. Too good, it turned out.
Dean felt a chill spread throughout his body. It had never occurred to him that he couldn’t go home. What about Sam? Where were they supposed to go? “And if we don’t agree?” He asked. He had to.
Jim raised his hands, and the crowd stilled almost immediately. “It’s true folks. This snake, in his arrogance, tried to tempt Castiel. He knows how to exploit every weakness, how to slip between the cracks of your faith. Luckily, my Son was too strong for him and was able to resist. But I ask you, do you have the same confidence in your children?” He let them ponder for a few seconds. “I can tell by your faces that some of you ain’t so sure.  An’ that’s because children don’t always have enough strength. That power can be hard to find for some people and it takes awhile for them to build their armour. Now, that ain’t a bad thing folks. God understands how hard it can be – that’s why he gave us parents in the first place. That’s why we forgive those that wrong us - that give in to that temptation.
He needed to start breakfast. Dean was good cook, better than John at any rate. It was worth Sam waking him up early if he could make a proper breakfast.
“Maybe,” Cas says acidly, the fraying ends of his patience clearly audible, “if you two stopped asking pointless meta questions we’d actually be able to make some progress out of here? Instead of just walking in circles?”
“I loved humanity from the moment they were created – but I loved them in the way you love the stars, or the flowers. Beautiful, but worlds away. Most angels do, I think, they just don’t like to admit it. They think it makes them weak.”
,” He hissed. “If you don’t turn around and walk out right now, alone,” he picked up the receiver, “I’m gonna call Pastor Novak and the Walkers and whoever else I can get a hold of and we’ll deal with you once n’for all. You are not to come near me or my family again or I will kill you. You understand me?”
“Yeah,” Dean admits and his voice cracks slightly. Immediately, Jonah embraces him, arms encircling him tightly.   Dean brings his arms up and around, clutching onto Jonah tightly. It’s a moment so tender and intimate, that both Sam and Cas have to look away – even moreso than the earlier sex, watching this moment feels like the ultimate invasion of Dean’s privacy.
Pulling into the bunker’s garage is a little tricky, and he inadvertently wakes Sam up as he does so. Figuring that both brothers will probably find this easier in a place they can’t easily escape, he makes his way into the bunker proper before Sam has a chance to question him. Sure enough, he hears the sound of a car pulling out into the night.
“You always leave when I’m still bleeding,” Dean whispers hoarsely, barely seeming to hear what Cas said. “You only remember the blood.”
Sam was already through the gate but Dean turned to wait for him. “It gets wider further down.” He jerked his head in the direction Sam had gone, “we can wait for them to finish. It’s like a five minute walk.”
“Sammy,” was all he said, but in a voice so laden with emotion that Sam turned back, hopeful, only to see John’s face harden the moment he made eye contact. “What’s right is right, even when it hurts. When you finally see that, I’ll still be here. Family don’t give up on family.”
“I don’t know,” Dean whispers, the shadows start to curve towards him from the corners of the room, twisting into the vague suggestions of claws and teeth. “ But Dad told me what to do, so I can’t let you out. Not unless he says so.”
They brought the books Missouri  had brought them up to her desk. She gave them a strange look as they said goodbye.
Dean spat in his face. Momentarily, Uriel was a contortion of rage. He regained his composure quickly, however, wiping the spit of his face calmly.
They stare at each other, and it’s Dean who breaks first. “I can’t, Bobby,” he whispers, ducking his head. “They’ll see everything. Everything I ever tried to hide or tried to lie about. They’ll know I’m not…they’ll see me for what I really am.”
“I’m...Sorry.” it was all he could think to say. Dean shook his head furiously, rubbing the back of his covered hand across his face.
“Cas, wait!” Dean called hopelessly after him. He didn’t know what we would’ve said or done, but it didn’t matter, for Cas kept running.
“Well if I can’t make you renounce your sins, I’ll find someone who can.” The threat was too naked to be anything but serious. It was offset by a gentle hand on his shoulder. He flinched. “Son,” Jim’s voice was soft, loving. “You’ll make things so much easier if you just admit what Dean’s done to you was wrong. Just think about what’s happened. You’ll soon see the truth”
“Folks,” the Preacher began, “ I’d like to begin by welcoming all the new faces here today. Our church may be a tad small,” a few scattered laughs permeated the silence, “but the folks in it are good, and I can trust them to be welcomin’ and kind.” He smiled as he surveyed the crowd.
Dean shrugs, the movement propelling him into a disembodied and headless torso, spilling it’s drink over a floating hand next to it. “Sorry,” he lurches back. “I dunno where I am, but –” he drops the pool cue and fumbles in his pockets, wrestling car keys from his jeans. “– I’ll help you look for me. Alwayss happy to help. C’mon, let’s get to the car.” He takes a lurching step, and Sam automatically jumps forward to support him – taking the familiar weight on his shoulder as he has a million times before and will do a million times again.
In the back pew, Dean rubbed his hand over Sam’s back gently, knowing he would still be upset. It wasn’t Sam’s fault, and the Pastor had only been joking with him; but he was thirteen and no thirteen year old liked being stared at by that many adults.
“Now these two towns weren’t like this one. They thought they was above God, safe from his judgement. They were immoral, abhorrent, evil sinners. They tried to defile servants of the lord to satisfy their lust And they paid for it.
Jim had been steadily increasing his pace as he talked, and he took a few seconds to catch his breath. “Now folks, I know what some of you will be thinkin’.
“You know – ” he says “ – the first time this happened he didn’t even particularly look like you. He was about the same height, same eye colour. Different hair though, and we didn’t even try to get your face right. Sometimes it’s better not to overdo things or go for photorealism – you have to let the brain do all the hard work itself. We sketched a vague portrait, copied a few basic gestures and that was it. Still, that was more than enough – he’d been here thirty years and his memory wasn’t what it is, he filled in enough of the details to believe it himself. I can’t wait to see what the actual you will do to him.”
“Right,” he said, “let’s swing by the library, pick up Missouri and get the hell outta this ass end town.”
“I’m sorry Dean,” he whispered, head bowed low so the men in front could neither see his tears nor hear his prayer. “I love you, I will find you. Even if it takes me my one and only lifetime I will find you.”
“I don’t know. We need light. Maybe I can –” Cas cuts off as fire bursts to life around them – the walls themselves igniting. A wall of flame shoots up between them and Dean – the force of the heat throwing them backwards.  Smoke collects above them, black and roiling. Thick tendrils ooze down and coil around Dean – twisting around his exposed heart and squeezing gently. Dean makes a soft whimpering sound, before forcing his teeth shut with an audible crack so the smoke can’t get down his throat.
“I have a...friend in the city. He’ll put you up for a while, though he’ll expect you to work in return.” She said, handing Dean a piece of paper with the address on it. “He’s expecting you in the next few days.” She held up a hand, “Don’t thank me. He’s a difficult man, but he’s better than here.”
They’d laughed at that. Even now, the remembered sound could brighten Dean’s mood. He’d wanted to do something, to make it up to Sam. Sam hadn’t known then, he hadn’t known that Dean had already abandoned him. Neither of them knew, yet.
“I just wanted to say I’m sorry. We’re all sorry.” She indicated the group standing awkwardly a little further away.  “We didn’t know what was going on, if we’d realized we would’ve tried to help, but we let you be dragged down by that – ”
He excites her and makes her feel small at the same time. She wants to see him – all of him – the way he can surely see her – all of her. She thinks about how she must appear to him: tiny, flat, and dirty. Almost unconsciously, she brings her arms up around her breasts.
Dean snorted with laughter, and, after a second’s hesitation, Sam joined him. The sound of their laughter was oddly muffled in the heat, lost in the drone of cicadas. “It’s a nice photo,” Dean said when they were finished.
Dean was still on his knees, hands clasped in fake prayer and shaking. His eyes were dancing with an amusement so infectious Castiel had to join in. He shifted into the posture Jim used when conducting sermons, head thrown back, and arms spread wide.
“But we did nothing wrong!” Cas protested indignantly. Dean remained silent through all of this, and Cas was beginning to worry.
For a second, they stand in the whiteness, then Dean feels Cas’ hand on his shoulder, squeezing ever so slightly. “Bend your knees,” is the only warning he gives.
“He’s gone, Dean,” how strange it is to say his own name with such gentleness. He drops down to his knees again so that they’re at eye level once again. “He’s gone and he’s not coming back.”
He barely recognised his friend. Castiel’s face was a hard mask of anger, he suddenly looked much older. His eyes, normally the warm blue of the sky, had hardened into ice. Dean took a step back as that gaze met his. “Cas?” was all he managed.
Dean seems unable to reply – but the beating of his heart picks up again, so fast that Sam would be worried in any other circumstance. Now it barely even registers.
When Lucifer possessed him he had torn people apart with his bare hands. He had watched his fingers close and Cas’ body blow apart. He’d beheaded Gordon with cheese wire; sliced open countless monsters and watched countless more devour or be devoured. Hell, he’s even been to hell, and what little of those memories remain are still enough to have him waking in cold sweats.
Sam had been suspicious. “Who’re you spending the night with then?” His face had brightened suddenly. “Anna?”
But Dean waves away their pain with a casual hand. “I’m not sayin you two haven’t suffered, I’m just sayin’, there’s an imbalance of suffering. And that’s just what’s canon.”
Pain and fear flicker across Dean’s face in equal measure. It’s clear he wants nothing more than to help, but still, he hangs back, hand drifting towards his waistband, eyeing the prostrate figure in front of him suspiciously.
“Anyway,” Dean said firmly, “enough about us and our goddamn family drama. What’s been goin’ on here? Still corruptin’ the local youth?”
“Shit.” It’s as good as place as any to start. But how to get there? The moment he thinks it, the back wall of the theatre collapses into nothingness. Bright light – sunlight, floods the room as grass springs up between the seats – the dew gleaming slightly in the newly crisp air.
“We know,” he calls from the audience, “but tough shit. When has it ever been easy for us? When has hiding ever worked? Let’s just get it over with: rip the band aid off.”
The corner of Dean’s mouth pushed up into a lopsided smile. He didn’t seem angry or sad. If anything, he seemed vaguely amused. “As a matter of fact: I am.”
Ah, so that was it. He didn’t care one bit whether  Castiel knew or cared about cars, this was all part of his Act, his character. Well if that was the role he was destined for so be it. He knew what would be expected of him if he left Mom’s, anything would be better than going back there, tail between his legs.
Sam Winchester had never been in a gay diner before. It looked, he noted with relief tinged with disappointment, more or less like any other diner. There were a few odd touches: the small rainbow flag on the thick doorframe (there was also a deadbolt); the names of the newspapers and magazines left on tables (Sam couldn’t imagine
Cas couldn’t help but snicker, and felt Hael’s anger burn into him. “I think you’re being disrespectful  to the Pastor, Dean,” she said airily. “Don’t you agree, Hester? Castiel?”
“We have to be quiet, My Dad’s home.” Castiel had told him, so in the end they’d just laid together, stretched out on top of the blankets.
“Sam,” john cut in. “Would you go and get a nice cake or something for dessert? Your pick.” Sam looked excitedly at Dean who moved to follow him before John grabbed his arm. “Just a sec son.” Sam was already half way down the aisle.
He snaps his fingers, and Dean gasps – eyes snapping shut, head jerking upwards as guttural moans start emanating from his throat.
Sam looked disappointed but stood to go. Feeling slightly awkward, Castiel followed the brothers out through the kitchen and into their back yard. It was another square of forlorn looking grass, a few balls strewn haphazardly about. A small gate at the bottom led onto a river bank. The water moved sluggishly in the evening heat.
“Thank you Cas,” The nickname was as instinctual as the hand on his shoulder had been. The normal rules of social interaction had been suspended for a few shining seconds and they clung to each other.
have a son like you. As long as you’re alive you will be my son – no matter what fag name you decide to go by – and I cannot afford to have a son that is anything but my own image. If I cannot have that son I will create that son or I will have no son.”  He released Castiel, turning away. “Now take him: don’t bring him back until he knows what’s right.”
Inwardly, Cas groans, though it’s not as if it’s a surprise. If there’s one thing you can count on Winchesters to do, he reflects ruefully, it’s walk straight into a trap.
“I should’ve been there,” Dean’s voice was so soft Sam thought he’d imagined it at first. But when he turned, finally, to look at his brother, he saw that Dean’s face was etched with grief and regret. His eyes were glassy, and he kept them fixed determinedly ahead.
my subconscious Cas,” Dean pants, still straining against the door. “And believe me: I’ve been trying to close this door for ten years. If I could lock it don’t you think I…” he trails off as the door starts to vibrate. “Well that can’t be good,” he mutters. Then, with a cry, he flies back,
“You owe him more than that,” Cas says gently – but firmly. “We owe him more than that – especially after everything he’s seen.”
Dean leans in closer – until their noses are touching. “I want to,” he breathes out – so quietly only Cas could ever hear him. “Every part of me wants to – even the scars.”
“Yes. I found the bus stop, the one outside town. There’s a bus every Wednesday night that goes to the city. From there, we can go anywhere. We can get to the other side of the country if we have to.”
“Make it stop,” Dean is sobbing in now – tears making pink streaks on his bloodied face. “I can’t do this anymore.”
“For talking to me when I know you don’t want to. For being open instead of hiding behind your strength. For telling me the truth.”
considering I’ve spent more or less my entire life constructing a careful façade of strength based on nobody (but
“Come on,” He snapped eventually. “The others’ll be waiting.” He escorted Dean up towards the house. As he did so, Dean saw his father’s car parked on the street. His heart, which had fallen permanently to his stomach hours ago, somehow managed to sink to knees. He’d never felt anything this bad before, even when Mom had died, but something told him it was about to get a whole lot worse.
Dean) into a bear hug. A second later, he feels Cas join them – arms encircling them a little stiffly, but endearingly so.
that I’ve spent most of my adult life avoiding any attempts to talk about or share my feelings and traumas, it’s likely that both the spell
“Dean,” Sam stumbles forward, putting his own hand where Dean’s is. “Can you hear me? Dean, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”
“He might have a point,” Cas warns as they back away. “There’s no telling what destroying a memory – any memory – might do to Dean.”
“Each of those and thousands more are sent to us every day to tempt us. The devil wants us covet, to lust, to abandon Christ the eternal in favour of the material. These faggots are no different. It ain’t natural, it ain’t a choice. They were tempted, and they chose to abandon God’s path in favour of Sin.
He jerks abruptly awake, involuntarily kicking Cas in the shins as he does so. This, of course, causes Cas to wake too, his surprised breath warm across Dean’s face. “Sorry,” Dean murmurs as Cas grumbles, “had that falling dream thingy.” It’s only half a lie, but he can tell Cas isn’t buying it.
“No, she wasn’t.” Cas mused. A thought occurred to him suddenly. “Do you think she’s...y’know? Like us?”
Sam’s alarm pierced Dean’s head like a knife. He groaned, throwing a pillow in the general direction of his younger brother.  He was rewarded by the clock being shoved closer to his ear. Forcing himself upwards he lunged for Sam, who was already across the room, laughing.
“You know I’m not ‘loving it’,” Cas says, unsure of the correct way to proceed. Dean is like a live wire – liable to spark at any moment. “But we need to do this in order to save you – and to get out of here.”
“Yeah. I knew Dad thought there was something wrong with me, but I didn’t really understand what. Until now.”
Immediately, Cas jumps forward – closing the distance between them and Dean, squinting at the side facing away from them. Sam edges forward more cautiously, casting his head around, holding the lighter up higher. The lack of any one (or anything) has him on edge. He’s about five steps away when Cas makes a terrible, bone-chilling, retching sound – the sort of sound that Sam’s always hoped angels couldn’t make, because that would mean there were things in the world so awful that even angels couldn’t comprehend them. Cas’ eyes are wide, his mouth is hanging open, frozen. His angel blade slips from his lax fingers and lands in a red pool at his feet.
“Dad! You’re hurting him,” Cas tried to force his way between the two as Gordon had done earlier, but he lacked the strength.  Nevertheless, the pastor’s grip on Dean was loosened, and he was able to pull away, stumbling as he did so.
“Yeah,” Sam snorts. “You and me both. It’s funny. I’ve spent god knows how long trying to get Dean to talk about himself– to open up even a little bit. And now I’m literally inside his head; and one memory is almost too much for me.”
In the bright sunlight it takes Cas a second to orient himself. Even before his vision has cleared, his nose is inundated with a harsh, chlorinated tang – strong enough to make him cough. In the background, he can hear a faint splashing underneath the sounds of passing cars. As his eyes finally begin to pick out details from the colourful shapes around him, he realises he’s standing in a swimming pool.
