He’s in the quad again, sketching a random tree. It’s barren, so all he needs is a few pencil marks here and there. Branches aren’t hard to draw; leaves can be a little tricky, though. Because it’s easy to make them seem too cartoonish, with too many wayward lines split down the middle. There are already too many eraser bits dusting the paper.
