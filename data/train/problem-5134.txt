The walls of the bedroom were a soft blue, and on the right side of the room spanned a wall of windows. It was lighter and airier than Dean’s sunless room back at the bunker. Castiel had made note of that fact when they had first toured this fixer-upper, and it had been part of the reason he had been so adamant about this house in particular.
“Cute look,” Dean remarked, finally releasing Castiel from where he had him pinned against the counter. He headed over to the stove, under which the pots and pans were stored. Dean bent down and pulled out a frying pan. He deftly spun it around in his hand like he was brandishing a sword and then set it down on the stovetop with a heavy
“Do you wanna—” A pleasant sigh escaped Dean’s lips as Castiel sucked the delicate skin of his neck. “Do you wanna take a shower? You know,” he drawled, “all this hair on you . . .”
Castiel feels a wave of guilt and secondhand pain go through him. Dean never deserved that. And Michael certainly never deserved him. “But that wasn’t you,” Castiel says. “
Castiel fought it, but his reflexes were not as strong as they used to be. His face broke into a begrudging smile. Swiping his hand in front of him, Castiel knocked Dean’s hand out of the way. “I did, actually.”
"It's only a couple of miles; Gabe and I can walk."
"Level three? Out of what?"
The fifth time he said it, Cas had tried to change the course of fate in a desperate attempt to gain enough power to win the war. His alliance with Crowley had still been a secret at the time, but the demon was not having any luck finding the entrance to Purgatory, and Cas had been forced to try something else. He had enlisted Balthazar's aid and unsunk the Titanic, laying claim to the souls that otherwise would have died. It was an ambitious plan, but Fate had other ideas.
Alfie chuckled and turned his head, resting his nose in the crook of Adam's shoulder as he sniffed again. He did smell something citrusy, but he had no idea what it was. "Gabe says I won't be able to scent anyone properly until my heat, but Cas has a pretty good sense of smell already so maybe I will, too."
"It's iridescent white," the Celestial confirmed. "My brothers and I all have unusual colored coats. And yes, my wolf form is rather large for an omega, bigger even than most of the other non-alpha Celestials I know. In general, it seems that Celestials are taller than wolves from other lands, and we have deeper chests to accommodate the greater lung capacity that allows us to breathe in the mountains. Maybe I can teach you two about fighting as wolves if you help me hone my weapon skills."
"Don't you dare say 'yes' to him." Donna, Jody, and Claire followed him in, each brandishing their own stained blades, and Dean could see almost a dozen more hunters in the spacious lobby, all of them slowly filtering into the large room and taking spots along the wall.
Crowley sat down in the den entrance, blocking the only route of escape as a precaution. He offered a small purr, hoping that the omega would recognize him as a friend even without the aid of light. Balthazar jumped, eyes searching for the intruder, holding perfectly still in the hopes that he would be left alone.
Cas couldn't help but think that
"Heh, sorry, Mom. Cas, you ready for some presents?"
“Do they sing rock songs?  Like the ones on your radio?”
Jo, a young blonde with light brown eyes, turned to sniff in Dean's direction, huffing under her breath before turning back to her table. "An omega. Castiel's, then. Someone is trying to buy favor with the Caesar again."
"Yeah, I figured. Well, Gabe and I talked pretty much non-stop on the way here, and he told me all about his childhood and how he felt when his father left, and how he was always expected to look out for his younger siblings. He was kind of the voice of the omegas, taking their fears and concerns to their parents and making sure that they got the attention they needed in a family that big. When Castiel started fighting with Raphael and Michael, Gabriel tried to play peacekeeper but it didn't work. He's the one who went to Anna and asked her to find someone to train them to fight because he was tired of Cas coming to their rooms at night, bleeding and broken."
"Yes. Two of them defecate on command and Dax is almost there. He has a very obvious tell, though, so I think he will learn in time."
needed you. I needed one sibling who didn't hate me or hunt me or try to reprogram me."
The city on the flyer was not far away, only a few hours’ drive, and he reached the fairgrounds before noon. Thankfully, the brothers had left on the first day of the exotic animal and bird show, otherwise Castiel would have had to fabricate an excuse to be gone for the whole day.
“Well, Moose, it seems that Lucifer’s cage has developed a crack.”
"I have conditions first."
Jo and Sam rinsed the wound as best they could, applying the new bandages over a layer of pine pitch salve that would hopefully suck some of the poison out and maybe stop it from spreading. The shoulder wound wasn’t infected, not that Sam had expected it to be, but they checked it quickly before slipping a shaking Gabe back into his pants. The tallest alpha divested himself of his clothing and helped Benny slip his larger pants over Gabe’s, doing the same with his shirt and vest. Benny wrapped the trembling omega in their one blanket, swinging the medical kit and a water skin over his shoulder before nodding at Sam.
"He had all of the public transportation routes memorized when we lived in Illinois," Gabe pointed out. "He knows the train schedule to get to Aunt Amara's house, even from here. If he says that we've missed the easier bus route and the alternate isn't a great option, then I believe him. We can walk, it isn't that far, and I can totally do better than a twenty-minute mile."
“Has he broken free?”
Asa tilted his head, blue-green eyes watching his fellow alpha curiously. "Is my pack in danger from retaliation in relation to this secret, even if we don't know what it is?"
Rowena glanced across the table at Gabriel, tilting her head curiously as she caught the omega's golden eyes. "You want to know what I was talking about when we first met, about the physical feature that Celestial wolves sometimes have."
Dean removed his light veil and placed it carefully on an empty shelf in Cas's clothing chamber, wringing his hands in front of his tunic. "What if . . . what if I said I might have a preference? I've never been with anyone, of course, but I have been attracted to males, especially alphas, more than females. Everything else about being an omega sucks, but being allowed to have sex with a male alpha without society judging or humiliating me is probably the only perk."
"I, uh, had no idea this was going on, of course," Metatron grumbled, glaring at the big alpha still unconscious on the floor, his balding brother groaning his way back to awareness. "These three have been in trouble from time to time, but I'm sure they weren't harassing your friend."
"Nonsense," Dean murmured, tucking Cas's head under his chin. "They're one of the best things ever created, especially for omegas. You shouldn't have to be responsible for the way alphas act around you, especially these damn knotheads who refuse to control themselves. Being a Lure might have its advantages when you're older and have pups, but it's damn inconvenient now. I can't believe your dad doesn't see that."
The older archangel sighed and dropped his head. Part of him was thrilled to have a brother to talk to again, one who wasn't insane and trying to kill him, but being a
"I know that you want to be strong, and you want to be seen as this tough guy, but it's okay to need to be comforted, Gabe. It's okay to let us touch you. I'm getting the feeling that you don't get a lot of physical comfort from your dad."
"Morning, sunshine."
Cas grinned as he reeled in his line, checking the bait before casting out again. "He'll be happy to hear that. My guess is that he would have asked, anyway."
They stared at each other for a few long minutes, the tears that Cas had been trying to hold back leaking out, and he struggled to get a hold of his emotions. Slowly, Dean sat down on the edge of his bed, reaching out to wipe away Cas's tears, his fingers lingering on his cheek. "How long have you been writing Destiel fanfics?"
"The Emperor will stop you," the second scout managed, his young voice breaking on the words. Why was Chuck using
"Shh, honeybee, it's ok. I'm going to get you out of here. I promise."
brother, Balthazar. I'll assume they are all true."
“Can you call anyone? On angel radio?” Dean pushed himself to his feet, wiping the last of the blood from his chin as he examined the bars that Castiel had half-melted. He grabbed one in both hands and started to wiggle it, first pushing then pulling in an attempt to break it free.
"With Dean? Absolutely."
On top of the panda sat a soldier holding out his arm. The man moved somewhat jerkily and it hardly seemed that he had a good hold of the missive at all. "Urgent news from the general!" Metatron glared at the panda, the faintest sneer on his face as he prepared to rebuff the strange soldier. "What's the matter, you never seen a 'black and white' before?" Behind the soldier, hidden from Metatron's view, Kevin held two long bamboo poles attached to the arms, moving them to thrust the rolled message in Metatron's face, Cri-Kee chirping softly from above that the man had finally taken it.
"Bodies," Charlie whispered, closing her eyes as she tried to focus. "I think . . . don't tell them, but I think that he may declare war on the other packs to keep Cas."
"It's one of Dad's favorite places," Adam pointed out, counting his money carefully as he eyed the game board. He was in the middle of the National Parks board, but he was aiming for Star Trek and the open properties there. "What are we watching, Ruby?"
"No. I'd probably be as hung up on you right now as Dean is on Cas."
The omega jumped back to his feet, half-crouched with his hands held in front of him, blade forward and cobalt eyes intense. They weren't boyfriends right now; they were two warriors from opposite sides of the border, and Cas was
Dean smiled and gently pushed on Cas's shoulder, encouraging the alpha to lie back on his bed, giving the omega space to curl up against him. It was weird for the prince; he'd never spent time resting in his bed naked with anyone, but with Dean it felt right. "Sometimes I feel like I've known you my whole life, like when I begged April to let me go to you last week. I knew you needed me, and I'd felt uneasy the whole week before. I'd thought it was because Benny and Gadreel were gone, but they came back and it didn't soothe the ache inside me. I know that I wasn't ready, that my training was taking longer than it should, but I wanted nothing more than to go on campaign with you."
Gabriel waited until they stepped out of the kitchen before teleporting the pair of them to Sam's bedroom. He stopped dead at the sight of the caique in his cage, the bird watching the intruder with one red eye but otherwise quiescent. "When did you get a pet, kiddo?"
Cas chuckled and pulled his hand free, wiping it clean on Dean's already-stained pants. "You know, just learned about babies and alphas' knots. Normal omega stuff."
"Jerk."
Dean sighed and leaned back against the headboard of his bed, glaring at his soaked sheets as he tried to decide if he was willing to walk over to the mini fridge for a sports drink. He tended to stick with water while he was rutting, but the fierce pounding in his head as he reached his fourth day of constant arousal with little relief and no food demanded something stronger, cold, and hopefully blue.
"On purpose?"
Kevin grinned. "He's the heir to Wilderness pack, so John would bring dozens of omegas to meet his son every month, males and females, but Dean rejected every one. I heard that John tried to bring him a young male who was already in heat once, and Dean just straight up ran away, refusing to be coerced. That might have been his first patrol with his current band, come to think of it. He doesn't believe in manipulating anyone, regardless of their subgender, and he resented what his father was trying to do. I'm pretty sure that John stopped that nonsense, but Dean slept around with betas to get back at him, especially male betas."
Gabriel shrugged and stepped forward, embracing the taller seraph. "I faked my death. I tried to kill Lucifer and I failed; I knew that his demons would be after me if I showed my head again. I thought it would be best to lay low until you guys threw him back in his cage."
Metatron sputtered and straightened his suit jacket, glancing at the three brothers before turning back to Sam. The young alpha, sensing the beta's indecision, did what his father had taught him to do in a confrontation with a more powerful figure: use his size to his advantage. Sam took a step toward Metatron, pulling himself to his full height, which was already pretty impressive at fifteen, and glared down his nose at the principal. Gabriel mentally compared himself to the old beta, figuring that he was about five inches taller, and Sam was at least half a head taller than him. The dichotomy between the alpha and beta was obvious, and Metatron could tell that he was losing any authority he might have had.
"There's no way to know for sure, but a half-witch and a messenger should at least have half-witch pups, if not full witch, and you may even have another messenger. Hopefully you have at least one half-witch, since Linda has told me that full witches are not allowed to rule Spellbound pack and Crowley has expressed an interest in having an heir."
Chapter 7: Pack Bonding Rituals
"If I could do something about Cain and his misbegotten brood, know that I would." Crowley glanced over his shoulder at the guard who had led him out of the gates. "Fetch Linda for me. Our guest will need somewhere to stay." He turned back to Balthazar and gestured for the tall blonde to follow him. "How long did my mother say she would be gone?"
Cas looked at Sam with his “I don’t understand that reference” face, but Dean just chuckled and took Cas’s hand.  “Pretty damn good, to be honest.  A little bit like honey.”  He paused for a moment, squeezing the angel’s hand.  “I think I could learn to like cake quite a bit.”  Cas blushed as he finally understood what the hunter was talking about, Dean wrapping one arm around his waist and pulled their chairs together before reaching out to dig into the nachos.  “Was karaoke everything you hoped it would be, babe?”
"I almost didn't, honeybee," Dean whispered, so focused on the angel that he didn't see the amazed look Sam exchanged with Gabriel, or the little cheer dance the three huntresses shared outside the cell. They could see that Dean had finally accepted his feelings for the dark-haired angel during their ordeal as Michael's hostages. "He broke me, and I'm sorry about that. Seeing him holding you by the neck . . . God, Cas, it was too much for me. I thought that accepting Michael was the only way to save you. I had to do something."
Cas snorted. "Sam, you can't really reprimand him after you said 'holy fucking hell'. That's a fanfic line, not something you actually say in real life."
"Yes," Gabriel breathed, holding out his arms and letting Sam close the cold metal around his wrists. He felt an instant change, the majority of his grace pushed down even as he held onto enough to keep his wings in the material plane. A seraph or angel would not be able to keep their wings visible at all while wearing the cuffs, but Gabriel knew that it would be enough to stop his insanely fast healing powers from ruining Sam's handiwork.
They couldn't have been more wrong.
“I work out,” Cas replied cheekily, his eyes sparkling at the joke. Dean chuckled as he looked at the angel’s arms hidden under that dark suit jacket, realizing that he must be quite fit. It had been some time since he had seen the man without a shirt on, but he seemed to remember a pleasing amount of
"He's just not feeling well, Cas. He'll be better next week."
was your brother's solution to the alphas here. Now that I've seen his eyes, I get why he can't have a moment's peace. Sam, make sure you get his class schedule and compare it to our active membership; I want eyes on him at all times."
Cas snorted, waving at the omega on the floor nearby who had stopped rolling around on the floor and had started rubbing against Gadreel, the older omega desperately trying to get the pup into the guest bedroom. "It all smells like him, now. His scent is overpowering yours and Max's today, and I'm honestly surprised that half of the city isn't outside trying to get in."
Uriel bowed his head and turned away, expecting Dean to follow him. The omega had already accepted his position as
It only took Dean seconds to connect the dots. "Cas, are you drunk?"
Dean growled and snapped his teeth at Kevin, smacking the tiny dragon off his arm and into the dirt at his feet. The tiny purple cricket that had followed the dragon to the army camp chirped something snarky, Khan pawing at the ground nearby.
"I know. Also, you and Ruby will be taking positions in the Circle for the Equinox. We're a bit short on witches this year in general, and Mother won't be back in time."
"I'll let Crowley know." Balthazar paused for a moment before touching his tattoo again, a slow grin spreading across his face. "I guess you'll be meeting my brothers sooner than I thought."
Jody spun the angel blade in her hand, grinning as both of her adopted daughters stepped forward to stand with her and Donna. “Well, you know we’re in. Those boys are family, and we’ll do whatever it takes to get them back.”
Dean pulled himself onto the roof, ignoring the gasping and cheers from the crowd below. He did hear someone call, "on the roof!" and a follow up of "look" from a second voice, but he drowned out the rest in order to concentrate on getting rid of Dick Roman for good. He made it to the wide beam at the top of the roof and turned to look at the fireworks pavilion, raising his hands to try to measure the distance. His plan was still kind of half-cocked, but if Kevin could do his part, it would work just fine.
Dean, riding beside Castiel, felt some deep sense of foreboding that he couldn't explain, but Khan could tell that he was uneasy so he kept his ears pricked forward, determined to find the danger before it hurt his rider. Kevin and Cri-Kee had tucked themselves into the familiar safety of his armor, tiny heads peeking out from under his green sash when they were sure no one could see them. Dean listened to the soft whine of the wind and jingling of the horses' tack underlaid by the muffled pounding of their hooves, starting as he finally realized what was making him so uncomfortable.
Sam shrugged, opening his eyes again and letting them meet Gabriel's concerned gold. "No one ever asked me what I want."
"Maybe we can find a way to make that happen," Dean whispered, leaning forward to kiss the omega's forehead. He took a moment to marvel again that this raven-haired man was his height, was as strong as him in human form, and could stand beside him as an equal. It was all he had ever wanted in a mate, even though he had never dared to tell his father that. That thought, and the knowledge that Cas loved the wild as much as he did, sent tingling shocks through his body. He could almost feel something inside him change, some blossoming of emotion and a sudden deep yearning he had never expected to feel. Staring into slightly-confused azure eyes, Dean knew that he wanted to wake up to them for the rest of his life.
Sam couldn’t help but smile at the determination and
"Crowley, you look like hell." Balthazar settled down on the cushion beside Crowley, glad that the alpha preferred low, comfortable seating. "When was the last time you took a break?"
"Benny," Castiel called as he spun quickly on one foot, arrow knocked in his bow. The entire line of soldiers scrambled backwards one step, leaving Benny in the direct line of fire. Castiel turned to the side and loosed his arrow, watching as it soared across the field and planted itself firmly in the top of a thick wooden post that had to be fifty feet high. Dean's eyes widened at how effortlessly the alpha had hit his mark, knowing that his own skills with a bow were sadly lacking. "Thank you for volunteering. Retrieve the arrow."
The Nomad grinned and returned to his steaming tea. "I will show you after dark. We should sleep in Kevin's room tonight; the window is in a better position."
When she reached the entrance to yet another abandoned den, the beta looked over her shoulder at the head alpha, nodding before switching forms. "He's in there."
"Rowena healed him. He's fine." Balthazar grinned and gripped Meg's arms briefly before stepping away from the beta.
"Well met, Meg of Spellbound." Tasha bowed her head and held her hands out, palms up, in a greeting that omegas tended to favor when meeting wolves of other subgenders. Meg grinned and stepped forward, taking Tasha's hands in her own and pulling the taller woman into a fierce embrace, one that her redheaded companion quickly joined. "You guys made good time."
On Gabriel's left side, Tasha pulled a scrap of paper out of her shirt pocket and started to read, chanting a short phrase in Enochian over and over. She couldn't read the language, but Gabriel had given her the phonetic translation and the correct timing. As soon as she repeated her phrase for the third time, she reached out with her left hand and placed it on Asa's shoulder.
Benny glanced down at his robes and tilted his head. "Does this dress make me look fat?"
"Is this really how people see us? The fans, Becky, the publisher, those cosplayer people we met at that convention; do they think of us like this?"
, I promise," Benny added, not bothering to offer his hand to the timid raven-haired teen. He knew better than to push interaction with a new omega, especially one who hadn't figured out his place in the Pack. "Come and meet my fiancé."
Of course, Dean’s warmth could be swift and blazing, too. But standing here in the bathroom, the morning sun streaming in through the window, Castiel’s myriad of ivy plants lining the sill. . . . That kind of incendiary heat wasn’t for mornings like this. This was a slow roll, something cherished and built up. Not the spark and detonation of a pistol.
Sam had called yesterday evening during Dean and Castiel’s weekly movie night while they were watching
But hurting Dean—whether in the crypt, or in a warehouse surrounded by hundreds of other identical corpses—was a dream that persisted all the same.
“I need asters,” Castiel blurts out. The words rip out of him, too loud and earnest. He cringes, but it’s true. He needs asters. He needs them now because if he waits it will be too late. He needs asters.
Castiel suddenly finds himself on a dusty expanse of road, feet straddling the furrow of a wheel. No—multiple wheels. The rut is deep and permanent looking, something only formed after hundreds of wheels have trailed along it, one after the other.
scrawled across its surface in bold print. Dean had found it at some tourist-fodder gas station in Texas and had insisted on buying it. It had been well-loved over the years.
Castiel could feel Dean stiffen behind him for a moment, and then Dean was squeezing his arms tighter around him. Dean’s steady, calloused hands latched onto the pilled fabric of Castiel’s sweater as he buried his nose in the crook of his neck.
After an indeterminate amount of time, there’s a sudden thump against his shoulder. Castiel starts and immediately snaps out of his reverie. Above his shoulder stands Dean, who shrinks away at Castiel’s clear surprise, guilt momentarily crossing his face.
being built. It was always developing, always changing, and always adapting to the times. He might not remember its fall, but he remembered its beginning.
He had dreamt of the crypt last night.
Castiel stopped as the back of Dean’s calves hit the edge of the porcelain tub. Finally removing his mouth from the tender area on Dean’s neck, Castiel nudged his nose against his ear, and Dean’s chin fell forward so his mouth could chase after Castiel’s. They moved together at a languid pace, their lips meeting solidly between them as Castiel slipped his hand up to tug at the neck of Dean’s tee.
Their home was actually fairly close to town, but it was far enough to feel secluded. Castiel liked the privacy, liked the way he could imagine himself being in true Vermont wilderness. Dean liked how they didn’t have to worry about the neighbors being nosy.
Between Dean’s thumb and index finger was a leaf fragment. Red maple.
Castiel looks at him in the dying daylight streaming through the living room windows and tilts his head. “What?”
Slipping his hands beneath the hem of Dean’s threadbare Eagles tee, Castiel trailed his fingertips across his waist and hips. Dean shivered, and Castiel pressed in closer, bumping their foreheads together before dragging his mouth to the hinge of Dean’s cheek and peppering kisses along the side of his face. He moved to Dean’s neck when he heard Dean’s breath hitch. Castiel lightly ran his teeth along the underside of his jaw, near his ear. Dean’s hand came up to cradle the back of his head.
There were research teams pouring over the bunker’s records looking for cures, like the ones Dean and Claire had undergone when they had first been turned; field teams that intercepted cases before other, shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later hunters could make it onto the scene; operations people who worked under the radar to divert the occasional blood bank; and most crucially, there were the networkers—the people on the inside making it all possible.
If he thought the conversation would end, he was wrong. Dean scoots across the couch so he’s nearer to Castiel, and he leans his elbow against the back cushions and rests his head on his propped-up hand. Dean looks like he wants to reach out and touch Castiel, but he’s been antsy about it ever since the incident at the farmers market. Castiel’s heart clenches at the sentiment, that Dean is afraid he might push Castiel away.
It happens unexpectedly.
Castiel still wasn’t always sure he was doing the whole “human” thing correctly. But at least he didn’t have to do it alone this time. He had Dean as a guide—a fond, knowledgeable one at that.
Maybe his answer will be marked correct. (Archaeologists and anthropologists like to butt heads about this topic.) But don’t worry about their academic quarrels, and certainly don’t worry about American late-night gameshow television. The answer is bag.
There were other photographs as well, but Castiel’s mind was already elsewhere. It was amusing to him the way the human mind worked. Very linearly, for starters. It was also quiet, and peaceful. For the first time in his long life, Castiel did not have the buzz and chatter of angel radio hammering dully around him. Even when Heaven had been reduced to only a few angels, and angel radio had been silent, there had still been that perpetual hum.
Castiel had said something about needing to take a shower to get the blood and sweat off of his skin, and Dean had agreed profusely, a ravenous smile on his face. They had fucked beneath one of the showerheads in the Men of Letters’ spacious bathroom, and Castiel could still recall the image of Dean on his knees on the wet concrete floor: the ecstasy-drunk, dazed look in his eyes; the pink, swollen rotunda of his lips; the crazy, soaking wisps of hair that Castiel held onto like a lifeline.
“That smells good,” a voice said from behind.
Castiel tipped Dean’s head backward and let the water wash away the soapsuds. When all the traces of shampoo were gone, Dean leaned into Castiel again. He took Castiel’s mouth in his own and kissed him deeply. Castiel melted into the touch.
____________
Familiar hunters mostly called Dean’s cell directly, but sometimes one of their four landlines would ring, each labeled with a distinct piece of tape:
along the western coast of North America. The staghorn fern and the sequoia, respectively. Castiel preferred the Enochian names more, of course, but he could still hear Dean making an offhand comment once about sequoia trees: “Oh, yeah. The big ones.”
It’s Castiel, of course. He’s the thing that always seems to be wrong.
A vicious and creeping mass forms at the pit of Castiel’s stomach, a mass that is entirely his own and not transposed by the outpour of emotion from the woman. It surges in time with the mounting uproar behind them. With sickening clarity, Castiel puts a label on the feeling:
“Yes, Dean?”
Dean had once said late one evening. Before monsters started forming ranks in preparation for the apocalypse, he meant. Before he picked up Sam from Stanford that one October night. Before Dean had been beaten down by the world—although his past self had certainly been beaten down enough for any one person to handle, even then.
Although he knows almost every story in human existence thanks to Metatron, experiencing them in real time is viscerally different. What Metatron did to him was like reading a synopsis of a film instead of actually watching it. Metatron stamped the words into his brain in one single go, and now Castiel is actively undoing his superficial work, making all the stories stretch out like one long, delicious meal. He may already know the flavors, but savoring something is so much more fulfilling.
As he sets off toward the florist stand, his canvas bag begins the slow process of slipping off his shoulder, the weight of the produce dragging the straps down toward the ground as if the fresh fruit housed inside wants to return to the earth from which it came. Castiel does not dare remove his hands from his pockets to adjust the bag.
Finally, after what feels like forever, Dean says, “She didn’t do anything wrong.”
“I don’t—” And Dean’s voice broke. He pressed his face further into Castiel’s collarbone. “I don’t mean to be like this. I—I’m sorry, this is—”
The irony is not lost on Castiel that the moment he was marked for downfall was when he held a man’s soul in his hands. He remembers it with acute precision: searing energy giving way to blissful illumination, the way its warmth lapped at him, so brilliant and captivating and easy to fall into, so
They soon disentangled themselves to remove their underwear, and then Dean stepped into the tub with Castiel in tow. They pulled the curtain closed behind them and let the water splash over their bodies, both of them still clasped tightly together. It was near scalding, and Castiel quickly fumbled with the handle until the temperature cooled down a bit.
“We all do, a bit,” Castiel admitted. “I’m beginning to realize that that’s just a part of the human experience.”
But it is what happens next that makes Castiel’s gut pitch in a sudden, horrible motion: the tugging of hands, Castiel advancing toward the florist stand, the other hand refusing to budge, a calloused palm digging into soft skin, a grip tight enough to inform the receiver that they are not going anywhere, mostly attributed to the human propensity to be stubborn and not move when looking at something that one does not want to stop looking at quite yet. Dean refuses to move.
Maybe Castiel was never really broken. Maybe he was just a little human.
Recovering quickly, Dean nods and gives Castiel a cue to continue.
The sound of splitting salt echoes across the valley.
Castiel sways before the image of a city destroyed. He takes a deep breath, smells the sharp tang of smoke, and swallows down the beautiful terror.
He is unclean.
It infuriated Castiel.
Dean raises an eyebrow. “Well, you said you were fine earlier today, too.”
Castiel sits cross-legged on their couch with a cracked-open book perched on a pillow laying in his lap. It is a proposed historical account of the naval tragedy depicted in Théodore Gércault’s 1819 painting of the shipwrecked
He does not know what to say.
As Castiel went through the maneuvers of making coffee—setting the filter into place, dumping spoonfuls of coffee grounds on top, pouring water into the reservoir—he felt the ghost of cartilage and bone breaking under the force of his knuckles. The coffee began to stream into the glass carafe below, first a slow drip (—the drip of Dean’s blood onto cold, dusty flagstones—) and then a steady pour as the coffee brewed in full.
It happens faster than Castiel anticipates. He wants to say something.
Castiel leaned forward and pressed his lips against Dean’s. They were soft, though a bit chapped, and Castiel could feel his own scruff tug lightly against Dean’s skin. Castiel drew nearer, nudging his tongue against Dean’s lips until Dean opened for him. He tasted of coffee, and Castiel drank him in slowly, letting the slide of their mouths echo in time with the soft
The tightness in Castiel’s throat threatens to suffocate him. He sucks in an erratic breath, his mind blaring in alarm at the shallowness of the air. The human body should breathe in about 1.5 liters of oxygen per minute; any less, and the side effects of low oxygen consumption start setting in, and when that happens, cognitive function begins to diminish, and the body’s rate of cellular respiration slows, and then not enough adenosine triphosphate is produced, and—
“Yes,” Castiel said hoarsely. He cupped Dean’s neck on the other side to get a better angle, and in response, Dean pushed his fingers through Castiel’s newly cut hair. They stood like that for a bit, neither of them ready to move yet. But soon, the tension became too much, and Castiel pivoted Dean sideways until Dean’s back faced the shower, Castiel’s mouth still on his neck. With one hand on his waist, Castiel walked him backwards.
on his head, right? So Dad—he was out all night—but I went through his things and got his clippers. And I thought to myself, ‘I’ve seen him do this plenty of times. I can totally do it, too.’ So I start on Sammy’s hair—and God, Cas. It was so fucking bad.”
They ate their breakfast at the island table, Dean at his usual corner seat next to Castiel. Their knees would bump, and they would chat, and the morning stretched onward until it finally reached an hour at which it was actually reasonable to be awake. They took turns getting up and picking new records when the ABBA one stopped and static filled the room. Dean selected a Creedence Clearwater Revival album, which they played one side of, and then Castiel picked a Kate Bush album, which he coaxed Dean into letting him play in its entirety.
Castiel knows what Dean is trying to do. But much to Dean’s not-yet-realized chagrin, Castiel does not want to feel better. He can’t. He just—
Fixed in the middle of the road is a clothed pillar of salt. It defaces the natural landscape, a synthetic spire that emerges from the earth like the raised webbing of protruding scar tissue. Each plane of its glittering surface reflects the far-off light of soot-fire and holy power.
Castiel did fall, eventually. But that is a different story. (There was, at least, a place held for him at the family table when it happened.)
The biggest nuisance they had been forced to deal with had taken place just two months after moving here when a demon had possessed one of Dean’s coworkers at the mechanic shop. The two of them had handled it with a call to Rowena, but not before wrecking a few cars beyond repair and making the manager quite irate in the process. But overall, the number of monster attacks had gone down significantly all over the globe. Castiel sent a silent prayer up to Jack. It was his doing.
Now, in the kitchen, Castiel was holding Dean again. They stood like that for a while, their coffee releasing wisps of steam behind Castiel, the small of his back pressed into the counter, his thumb rubbing circles along the curve of Dean’s neck at the base of his skull. Pretty soon, he felt Dean’s shoulders hitch up and his chest swell and collapse in quick succession—and Castiel pulled back immediately, thinking Dean was crying.
Castiel smiled to himself.
This was how their Thursday mornings usually went. Dean didn’t have work down at the mechanic shop on Thursdays, and Castiel only worked part-time at the local Trader Joe’s. He mostly kept himself busy with his garden and his books, and during late summer, he rented out a stand at the farmers market in town and sold the honey he harvested from his beehives.
“Cas?”
Dean presented it as a casual offer, ready to be dropped in an instant if Castiel got tense and didn’t want to delve deeper, but Castiel could tell from the low-pitched resonance of Dean’s voice that he meant it in earnest.
But after a certain point in time, his memories began to get hazy.
But this time around, although it still felt strange—not being able to feel their magnetic pulse, the way they connected his mind to the vaulting chambers beneath the earth and the sharp peaks of mountains that sliced through the atmosphere—he did not miss them. Castiel had everything he needed right here in front of him.
Castiel quickly dried his hands on the same towel Dean had used and then followed him, close enough to hear Dean say, “Gotta make my husband look socially acceptable when I show him off around town on our drive today, huh?”
Dean closed his eyes and leaned into the touch. Castiel remembered the first time they had taken a shower together—it was late one night at the bunker, after a gruesome hunt they had driven seven hours to get back from, and Sam had gone to bed early. This was only a couple of weeks into the start of Castiel and Dean’s relationship; they could barely keep their hands off of each other back then.
This is the point of the bag. The bottle. The sling. They are all receptacles, all holders.
Castiel let go of the leaf and watched it flit to the wooden slats of the porch. He touched the side of his mug—the coffee had long since cooled—and so he picked it up and headed back inside.
The grounding rumble of silent laughter in Dean’s chest makes Castiel want to get closer to him, but they’re practically folded on top of each other already. Castiel makes an executive decision and slides both of his hands across the pillow to take Dean’s hand in his own.
“I did.” Castiel sends him a withering glare. “And I am.”
There were things he remembered with absolute, striking precision: the destruction of Sodom, the look on the face of Lot’s wife before her skin crackled and became chalky, that rough, crystalline texture of salt glinting in the light of daybreak; a group of little boys and girls playing catch on the banks of the Yangtze River, the way the ball, wrapped in yak leather, landed smoothly in Castiel’s hands, the laughter and grins of the children encouraging him to throw it back; a seedling buried in the shallow soil of the Amazonian Basin which he would eventually sit and watch germinate until maturity.
He pulls. She stumbles forward a bit, then plants her feet again. Headstrong, she clenches his hand more firmly, a panicked, wide-eyed desperation on her face. Being this close to a human is enough to pick up tingles of its emotional state, but the skin-to-skin contact of their touching hands makes Castiel dizzy with the flood of stress hormones that seem to drown her. The emotions swirl together too fast and too wild for Castiel to place them, like powdery grains of pigmented spices spilling together: a bewildering mess of color that bleeds into one hue with enough disturbance.
Sometimes Dean got like this—usually late at night or early in the morning when the world was still asleep, when there was no one to perform for and no one to judge. In a place like this, standing in a tub whose curtain concealed them like a safety blanket. Here, Dean would allow Castiel to see a part of himself that he could not bring himself to show anyone else.
“Brother?”
“You know you can—you know—talk to me. About stuff.”
Castiel’s sense of time was rickety, at best. He would admit that to himself.
Not the first time. Probably not the last.
It also wasn’t the first time Castiel had woken up with a jolting Dean next to him, the other man choking out something about
They share the remainder of their meal in comfortable silence, save k. d. lang’s light cords in the background emanating from the record player that sits next to their pair of bookshelves on the far wall. The deep mahogany shelves are filled with books, of course, but many of the bottom ones are also dedicated to DVDs and VHS tapes and old albums. There is a stack of library books on the floor at the base of the left shelf that Castiel put there as a reminder to return them soon. The top book, a Toni Morrison, looks close to tipping over onto where the empty, worn cover of the k. d. lang album leans against the nearby record stand.
His books range from mystery-thrillers to political manifestos to airport romances to poetry anthologies to random illegally downloaded PDFs Sam likes to send him. Occasionally, there is a children's book or a comic book that Dean points out because he has fond memories of them.
Shuffling over to the wide sink and pouring his cold coffee down the drain, he decided to make a fresh batch. He had ground some coffee beans last night—he usually did it at night, so the sound would not be too loud in the morning. Mostly for his own sake, since he normally slept in the latest. But sometimes he just could not sleep, no matter how much he willed his body to do so. This typically translated in him going to bed incredibly late and waking up even later, but sometimes he just stayed up the whole night. He always did his best to lie still and close his eyes, but it was difficult, falling asleep.
Perhaps he
The figure in front of him wrinkles its brow at the disorder, its gaze piercing into Castiel. Castiel swallows. Unconscious of the move, he shifts his weight from knee to knee on the mound of fabric and salt, and a deafening crunch fills up the valley until the air feels so heavy the sky will surely fall.
It wasn’t there now. Castiel had thought he might miss it, or at least find the silence unsettling.
Castiel can corroborate Ursula K. Le Guin's carrier bag theory. (He was there.)
Dean’s fingers raked through Castiel’s hair, and he put his entire focus into the circular rhythm. Everything Dean did, he did to the fullest. Castiel let his head loosely follow the movement of his hands like a buoy floating on the surface of a mild sea.
Castiel’s stomach lists in a dangerous way, and his chest tightens as if it is his lungs being squeezed rather than his hand.
Castiel watched Dean through the mirror as he dove into the story, his hands gesticulating for emphasis while still holding the scissors and comb.
Dean still tasted of spearmint toothpaste.
“Uh-huh,” Dean says, drawing out the sound. “You write your name in them, sure. But you underline shit, too. Fold the pages all weird. Spill coffee on them. Write to-do lists in the margins. Smear the covers with take-out grease. Tear out the pages and roll ‘em.”
He hears the crackling of salt in the back of his mind. He remembers the feeling of sharp crystals beneath his knees. He thinks of the way his brother gazed at him, like it was he who was broken and not the woman.
When Dean pulled the curtain back to step out, the gush of air felt ice-cold on Castiel’s skin. Castiel hunched his shoulders and pulled the towel tighter around himself. Temperature shifts always felt extreme to him, so unused to having to regulate his own body temperature now. Seeing this, Dean dragged his hands up and down Castiel’s arms as if to warm him up.
Castiel brought Dean’s coffee over to him, which he gladly accepted, and then Castiel opened the fridge to look for the milk for his own coffee. Stuck onto the face of the fridge with magnets were the grocery list, a blurry polaroid of Claire and Kaia that they had sent them two years ago, and a holiday card from Sam and Eileen from last winter.
Castiel approached the shelf of records and began to flip through them.
Sometimes, however, Castiel
____________
Castiel considered the hunched body in his arms. “No. You have trauma, but you’re not broken.”
—Dean tugged the towel down and let it drape over Castiel’s shoulders. The material was warm and soft against his skin.
“He is certainly something,” Castiel replied, deadpan.
He did not.
, or whatever. But if Castiel admits this fact, then Dean will know for certain that something is wrong.
Castiel looks down at his own meal, still warm and neatly cut. For Dean’s sake more than his own, he picks up his fork and collects a piece with a little bit of everything on it: some ground beef, some mashed potatoes, some cheese, some of the caramelized onion garnish. When he puts it in his mouth, it warms him up and gives him a physical sensation to latch into. It's in stark contrast to the numbness in his body he has felt since the farmers market. The subtle spices ground him, tugging him back home.
“You need a haircut,” Dean informed him.
And then the conversation slowly digressed into an argument about whether Marty McFly or Captain Kirk would win in a fight—an argument that Dean took both sides of, and about which Castiel had no valuable input to offer.
Castiel watched as Dean let his towel drop to the floor as he retrieved a clean pair of underwear and slipped them on. As Dean began rifling through the drawer that held his t-shirts—which Castiel often commandeered for himself—Castiel let out a small, pleasant sigh.
“Oh—sorry, man. I didn’t mean to . . .” His voice trails off as Castiel waves his hand.
Dean was resolutely focused on the crown of Castiel’s head. His eyes danced across Castiel’s hair, and his tongue poked slightly out of his mouth in concentration.
“Shirt?” Castiel asked. His voice was breathless. Dean nodded while they kissed.
“Cas—” His voice, a bit ragged along the edges, was barely above a whisper, but it cut through the steady thrum of water easily. He still refused to open his eyes.
He was slowly bringing other hunters around to better understand a new way of looking at things, of cohabitation.
It was easier with Dean.
Dean quickly recovered, a self-conscious, lopsided smile forming on his face. “You should be more careful with a guy who has scissors next to your face.”
Dean’s hand felt good at the small of his back, like a grounding force. Castiel wanted to be that same thing for Dean.
He had always been most fond of
“N—nothing. Nothing,” Dean said. His face was turning red with the effort to hold his laughter inside.
Under Dean’s pillow, of course, was his gun. Castiel had a gun in the drawer of his nightstand as well, but he had yet to touch it since being here. His angel blade stayed under the bed for easier accessibility, if it came to that.
Dean had a point, of course. No one in their right mind would trust a group of people who had, until four years ago, made it their life’s mission to kill them. And there were still plenty of hunters out there who were not on board with what Sam and Eileen were doing. The system was not perfect; far from it, in fact. But the two of them kept trying, and Castiel found it admirable.
There was even a smattering of those magnetic word strips which Dean had come home with one afternoon—where Dean had picked them up, Castiel had no idea—but every couple of days they would be rearranged in a different order. Today, Castiel read,
They stood like that for a few minutes, Dean’s head on Castiel’s shoulder and Castiel holding him close. Dean cried—actually allowed himself to cry—and the sound was marginally smothered out by the din of the shower. After some time, the ragged breathing coming from Dean slowly evened out as they swayed under the spray of water. Dean’s hands came up to lay on Castiel’s chest, his right palm gently pressing against the anti-possession tattoo Castiel had gotten soon after becoming human.
Dean let out a shaky laugh at that, and his smile flashed through the steam. His hand moved upwards from its placement on Castiel’s anti-possession tattoo to squeeze his shoulder. “You got that right,” Dean said. His face then sobered, and he opened his mouth again hesitantly. “Thank you. For giving me this.”
Then, he watches as Dean connects that memory to another:
There, by his side, a woman. This body’s hand dwarfs her small one, but her grip is strong and her palms are rough. A vague thought races its way through Castiel’s mind, that she works with her hands. That she lives an active life. But now, she stands still, her body unyielding and her eyes hard and scared and pleading. Has he been tugging her forward this entire time? He must have been. He did not notice. This body isn’t well-adjusted yet.
He goes on to explain the memory, keeping it clean, systematic. He talks about the tugging on his hand. He talks about Sodom, and his brother, and that poor woman. He talks about the ewe, and the cloth sling-bag that held her. He talks about the horrible feeling inside of him when his brother looked down at the mess he had made. He talks about the realization and understanding that there was something very wrong with him. He thinks, aloud, that this was the first time.
“It’s fine, Dean.”
A bright laugh escaped Dean’s lips, and he threw his head back, the corners of his eyes crinkling in that way Castiel liked so much.
He was no exception.
Dragging his eyes away from the clothed pillar, Castiel forces himself to look back as well. There, on the horizon, is Sodom: a smoldering mess razed to the ground, wooden structures incinerated, and mudbrick houses baked and turned to dust. The fields of barley directly encompassing the city are flattened and scorched, a pinwheel of barrenness that radiates off of a desolated focus. A bird in flight would recognize the pinwheel as
They would talk about Castiel’s nightmare later, he decided. But not now. Now it was time for breakfast.
The press of Dean’s hip against Castiel’s groin made his head swirl. “I wouldn’t want your t-shirt to get wet.”
That being said, his money was on Kirk.
. And, sometimes, Castiel would come across a story that he did not know. That was most exciting of all.
Reaching a hand up, Dean lightly brushed his index finger across the bridge of Castiel’s nose.
Castiel thumbed the logbook page and took another long drink of coffee as he listened to Dean talk about the physics behind time travel.
He does not know what to say. In his arms, the ewe lets out a soft bleat. Castiel involuntarily brings his sullied hand up to her shivering chest and slips his fingers beneath the cloth sling-bag to comfort her. A wild heartbeat greets him.
Castiel knew it pained Dean to do so, being a man who felt shame so deeply within himself that the emotion might as well have been a tree whose roots were wrapped in a solid net around his ribs, his lungs, his heart. That tree had grown inside of Dean as a child, and its trunk had helped him keep upright throughout all the years and throughout all the pain. But there was no need for its support anymore.
There was a reason angels had not been allowed to explore Earth independently for thousands of years.
Castiel could always count on Dean to let a painful conversation drop—a gesture that said
Castiel smiled fondly to himself as he picked a record. He slipped the vinyl disk out of its cover and removed the plastic jacket. Flipping it over to the A-side, he set it on the record player, turned the player on, and set the needle down.
Dean and Castiel, although officially retired on paper, still offered their help. Partly it was because there were still a number of divine relics that Castiel felt responsible for, partly it was because Castiel had always liked doing reconnaissance, and partly it was because Dean—despite his insistence that
Castiel had been confused at first. He figured Dean had had shower sex before—lots of times, for that matter. But Dean had corrected him. It was the tenderness that had caught Dean off-guard, the quiet devotion Castiel had offered him.
A small breath slipped past Dean’s parted lips, and the man shut his eyes tighter. Their noses brushed together, and it was only in this small space between them that Castiel was able to tell that Dean was crying, the water dripping down his face as a false front. Just barely crying, and by way of just a few tears. But Castiel knew Dean. He knew the way his shoulders stiffened, the way the muscles of his jaw flexed, how he would shut his eyes, just like this, and pretend that the tears were not there.
Twelve years of tension finally being acknowledged, Castiel supposed.
fall asleep, only to snap awake during the dead of the night with a hushed gasp. Dreaming was something he hadn’t had to deal with since the last time he was human. Sometimes the dreams were pleasant. Most of the time they were not.
“Nah—I just got lots of practice. Who d’ya think always had to cut Sam’s mop of hair when we were little? Man—” Dean let out a chuckle— “there was this one time—Sammy must’ve been seven or eight, maybe—and we’d just started at this new school in Utah. It was our first week—”
It had taken him millions of years to learn, but Castiel finally understood that everyone was just trying to get by in their own beautiful, tangled way.
a few others. They are old, clearly having been dragged to every corner of the United States over many decades. A couple have clear packing tape running up their spines just to hold them together.
“Can’t keep your hands off me, huh?”
Castiel lifts his head to find his brother standing before him. In the distance are three people with animals, each person dutifully facing toward the mountain a long ways off. None of the humans turn around. They know better.
Sometimes, there were too many fruits and vegetables from his garden—like tomatoes, which they both liked to eat but which also seemed to grow everywhere despite Castiel’s best efforts to rein them in, and snow peas, which Castiel enjoyed but Dean found repellent, giving them a plethora extra. Not wanting any of the food to go to waste, Castiel would set up his stand at random intervals throughout the year. He had actually made quite a name for himself over the past four years here. Sometimes the locals would ask him how he got his produce so delicious, especially since he had only started his garden so recently. And Castiel would always give a sheepish, vague answer, not wanting to tell them the truth:
He lurches forward, knees skidding against dirt just in time to catch the wool sling before it can smack against the earth. The ewe wriggles in her cloth cage, and Castiel presses her small body against his chest to keep her from hurting herself.
Still waiting for the coffee to finish brewing, Dean wrapped himself around Castiel, his chest flush with Castiel’s back. His arms hugged Castiel’s torso, and Castiel set the mug down and let his hands drape over Dean’s. Dean then dropped his head to rest on Castiel’s shoulder. The soft hair that lay flat across the side of Dean’s head tickled his neck, and Castiel felt the reverberation in Dean’s throat as he hummed in contentment. Leaning into the touch, Castiel gently bumped his forehead against the other man’s temple.
“Why didn’t you say something?” Dean asks, his voice a bit angry, but mostly just concerned.
Castiel still feels sick from whatever memory relapse he had earlier, but he already skipped lunch today by isolating himself away from Dean all afternoon in the garden to plant the asters they picked up. He chose a spot near his three bee boxes, which Dean refuses to approach.
When Dean had rescued Castiel from the Empty four years ago and professed his feelings in return, it had taken a couple of months for Dean to get used to Castiel’s touch. Touching, in principle, was not the problem; they kissed, and they held each other, and they had sex. But occasionally, when Castiel was slow and gentle with him, Dean would freeze up like he didn’t know what to do with that kind of treatment. Like of all the partners he had ever had, it was a rare occurrence for them to touch him without expecting anything in return.
funny, Cas, come on. On Dean’s side, there was a worn, cracked copy of
It was still playing when they finished eating and Castiel moved to the sink to wash the dishes. Dean cleaned the kitchen counter with a sponge, and when he was done, he snuck behind Castiel to plop the sponge down next to the sink. After only half-drying his hands on a towel, Dean reached up and tugged at the hair at the nape of Castiel’s neck. His hands were damp, and Castiel sucked in a surprised breath.
(Most of these new stories were actually from bizarre, rare movies that Dean made him watch, ones that Dean insisted were cult classics—but as far as Castiel was concerned, they probably did not have any cult following whatsoever. Probably for good reason.)
“Wanna talk about it?” Dean asked. He was referring to the nightmare. That was the only reason Castiel ever got up before Dean.
Castiel liked seeing Dean like this: happy, the weight of the world not visibly on his shoulders. Ever since they had moved out of the bunker and retired, Castiel had noted an unmistakable improvement in Dean’s state of mind. It was reassuring. It made Castiel’s heart swell.
“It’s okay, Dean,” he said again. Another hitching sob. “I’ve got you. I’ve got you.”
Now, though, Castiel realizes he can’t invent a good enough reason to turn down shepherd’s pie; Dean knows it’s one of his favorites. The churning of his stomach mixes with something like anger, and Castiel wants to snap at Dean that he is perfectly aware that Dean is trying to—to—to
He reaches down to take Castiel’s hand, but before he can, Castiel slips his hands in the pockets of his cardigan. He has three other cardigans just like this one at home in different colors because he likes the way they fit and he likes that they have pockets. Years spoiled by a pocket-ridden trench coat will do that to a person.
(Castiel had been training himself to do that recently—to occasionally mimic Dean’s way of showing casual, physical affection. A few years ago, Sam had texted Castiel an article on love languages. Written under the link was a message that read,
Almost everyone had been wary at first. Not just the hunters, but the monsters as well. Castiel had heard plenty of Dean’s voiced anxieties at the beginning of this endeavor:
Dean shrugs sheepishly but accepts the compliment. He’s getting better at that.
Castiel let Dean move him around, either shifting his head or shoulders, but when Dean said, “Okay, look at me,” Castiel turned and planted himself face-to-face with Dean.
Bookshelves lined the main hall and the living room, and all of them were piled high with old paperbacks, DVDs, VHS tapes, CDs, and vinyl records. Just because Castiel already possessed the knowledge of most media produced in the past few millennia thanks to Metatron, there was a difference between
Dean inched his hands up Castiel’s bare chest and then slid them to his back, letting his palms settle flat against Castiel’s shoulder blades where the energy of his wings had once flowed. The pressure felt good. There seemed to be a perpetual ache there, like a sore muscle or a missing limb. Castiel had first felt that discomfort when Metatron had taken his grace years ago. It had been worse during those days, when everything had been so new to him, his lack of wings an everlasting reminder of his failings.
The photographs were some of the first things Dean had put up when they moved in. He had argued that it was for safety, since each photograph covered up a painted sigil, but Castiel had known the real reason.
Castiel placed both hands on either side of Dean’s face and leaned their foreheads together. Dean let out a shuddering exhale like he was trying to force himself to keep his breathing regular, and Castiel pressed their bodies closer together until everything else seemed to disappear—just the two of them, sharing each other's air, and the grounding force of the water overhead. The rest of the world fell away.
And then the woman looks back. Only her head turns. Only her neck cranes. But it is enough.
“Wanna take Baby out for a spin later?” Dean asked over the sound of sizzling and Swedish pop.
Dean had chosen Castiel.
that rips through the air, the pattern aligns itself and stops.
Dean put the scissors and comb back down on the counter and ran a hand over his beaming face.
“No.”
In the places where his troubles had once been, Castiel adopted other things—the swathing presence of the steam, the patter of water at their feet, and the scent of Dean floating all around: warm sheets, old leather, and the faint trace of gasoline. These sensations undulated like honey inside of Castiel. He filled himself up with them until the core of his being felt rosy.
“Alright,” Castiel said. He finished cleaning up the last pan, then set it on the drying rack beside the sink. “Now?”
There was the fall of Rome, of which he had no memories at all, though by what his brothers and sisters used to tell him, it was not really a fall as much as it was a slow trickle.
Castiel then turned back to the counter. Extending an arm above his head, he opened a cabinet and extracted a second cup. It was a corny, chipped mug with
Maybe while you are watching, a statement will pop up on the screen that says, “The first known tool used by mankind.”
Castiel can’t really deny those things, though the successive laundry list from more normal to more depraved makes him smile a bit. “Only if the pages are thin enough,” he replies.
away. He simply swiped a hand over his face and cleared his throat. His eyes were red-rimmed, and he was looking at Castiel earnestly.
“Sweetheart, you okay?” Dean asks again. He keeps his voice low, like he’s speaking to a spooked animal.
A tight, heavy ache bloomed in Castiel’s chest as he thought about the old days when he had been able to enter Dean’s dreams and make them peaceful. Dean didn’t deserve to be plagued by the things of his past. Neither of them did.
“You know . . .” Dean licked his lips nervously. “All this. A life. A chance. A new purpose. You didn’t have to, but you did. You gave up everything for me. And I—I don’t think I would’ve been able to navigate this alone. I really appreciate you.” Dean leveled his eyes with him. “I love you.”
Next to it was a grainy photo of Mary holding a grinning Dean when he was only a toddler, his hair so blonde it was almost platinum. Above that photograph was one with Dean, Sam, and Jack crowded together in the bunker in front of a crudely decorated birthday cake.
Dean smiled as he pulled his lips away. He looked more content than before, the heaviness of his crying having left him. “My turn,” he said. Then he shuffled over to grab the shampoo bottle himself, and he poured a dollop into his hands.
“You couldn’t have stopped it, Cas. She knew what would happen, but she did it anyway, because she was human. Because despite whatever horrible things Heaven was going to destroy that city over—which was shitty, by the way, no offense—she did it anyway because she still cared. That’s just what people do. I think I love her for that, too.”
“I don’t deface them. I personalize them.”
John Winchester had planted a seed within Dean long ago that Castiel would die removing. No matter how much time it required, Castiel would gently pick apart the rotten roots and unlace their woven walls from Dean’s chest until Dean was free. Until Dean could breathe. Until Castiel died of old age and became a pile of ash, if that is what it took.
Just because they were known formally as Dean and Castiel Campbell, it didn’t stop Dean from calling Castiel “Mr. Winchester” over dinner or in bed. And sometimes, when he knew Dean was out of earshot, Castiel would whisper “Cas Winchester” to himself, reveling in the taste of it in his mouth—the proof that he had a family. A home.
“—and Sammy, he came back to the motel in hysterics one afternoon, talking about how the next day was picture day, and I thought, well, shit! I can’t let my kid brother get his stupid photo taken with a goddamn
Dean grinned and slapped him on the shoulder. Without another word, Dean headed out of the kitchen toward the stairs that led up to the second floor, a space that was only half the size of the ground floor since the living room had tall ceilings that extended to the roof. The second floor consisted of a small walkway, from which two doors were visible: their bedroom door and the door to the upstairs bathroom.
That one had kept Dean quiet. So, Sam set off on a mission.
Castiel thought of Lot’s wife again. A bleached pillar of salt. A clean speck standing before fiery, frayed wreckage. The chipped grains of her body crumpling onto red sand, and the way she was carried off by the wind and erased.
Dean lifted his head so his chin rested on his shoulder. His chest rose and fell steadily against Castiel’s back as he breathed in the scent of coffee. It was high end, something organic and fairtrade and imported. Dean always groused about the cost, saying that coffee was coffee whether it came from a Gas-N-Sip or a luxurious café, but Castiel insisted on it. If he was human and needed caffeine to function, it was at least going to taste decent. Besides, Castiel knew Dean liked it better anyway. Not that the man would ever admit it.
Dean smiled in return.
“Thank you. You’re excellent at this, you know.”
Setting the pot back in the coffee machine, Castiel took hold of Dean’s hands and pulled them away from his sides just far enough to allow himself to turn around so they were chest-to-chest. He tugged Dean securely against him and enveloped his arms around his neck.
here?” Dean asked incredulously once)—filling his arms until they overflow with novels from the $1 bins that always seem to be at yard sales, and on, and on, and on. He is best friends with the old ladies at the library.
The point of Ursula K. Le Guin’s essay on Paleolithic bags has less to do with the type of bag itself and more to do with the fact that humans made bags in the first place. After all, how can a rock or a spear be of use to a species before a bag? It is a question of
“Of course.”
by Jonathan Miles. I think it used to belong to a student, if the overly-excessive underlining is anything to go off of.”
Castiel has witnessed instances of smiting sickness before. Never first-hand. Certainly never so close. He thinks, if he were human, he would throw up.
(Castiel might have been a bit biased in that interpretation, though. He rather liked the bustling atmosphere of Constantinople during the Middle Ages, the way it bled into the peaceful, towering space of Hagia Sophia. Although he had not been there in person, per se, he had visited the minds of praying worshipers there enough times over the centuries to keenly know its towering arches and its clerestory windows, as if the features of the building were permanently engraved on the back of his eyelids. He could still feel the bite of tendrilled incense in his nostrils.)
Like her, Castiel also thinks that what makes humans human is that they like to hold things. (This is plainly observable.)
Castiel walked through the living room, past the secondhand couch and coffee table, and by the wall of photographs.
“I think I still have that photo,” Dean said to himself. “I definitely gotta show that to Eileen.”
“Relax, dude. I don’t bite.”
“Dean . . .” Castiel’s voice trailed off as he searched for the right words. How could he even begin to explain how much Dean had given
Castiel looked up, first at Dean, and then at his own translucent reflection in the kitchen window above the sink. He couldn’t make out much of his hair from the warped image, but he didn’t doubt it. It had been at least two months since Dean had given him his last haircut. It was most likely due time for another.
, Castiel had said simply.
Transitioning one hand to Castiel’s back—the place between his shoulder blades that Dean knew ached—Dean led Castiel out of the bathroom, down the walkway that overlooked their living room, and into their bedroom. They would clean up the hair-cutting mess later.
“I’m sorry,” Dean says. Castiel must look perplexed at the apology because Dean clarifies. “When memories resurface, it’s—it’s bad. Sometimes . . .” He shrugs. "Sometimes I remember glimpses of what Michael did.”
Dean’s hands were warm. It was not the same kind of warmth that emanated from his soul but rather the warmth of his body. His soul may have been palatial and intoxicating, but Castiel found this new heat to be just as sublime—thick and unhurried. Like maple syrup, or an August day.
he explain?
Suddenly, Castiel stops. He knows he cannot—should not. But there is something tugging backward . . .
was me. This was on me.”
Dean snorted. He was busy moving some eggs around a pan with a spatula and doing the same with a few strips of bacon on the neighboring burner. The toaster ticked away, the smell of warming bread filling up the kitchen.
Things had been mostly quiet since.
“I took the pears and stuff you got today out of the bag when we got home and put ‘em in the fruit bowl, by the way," Dean murmurs. "You know, 'case you're hungry later."
Castiel blinks. Right. Yes. The florist who is only here every two months, whose presence Castiel marks, without fault, every time, with a star next to the words “Farmers Market” on the National Geographic calendar they keep in the kitchen to distinguish these farmers market trips from the others, even if Dean tells him he doesn’t have to keep putting “Farmers Market” on the calendar in the first place since they go here every Saturday anyway. The florist who probably has asters, which Castiel has been planning to introduce to their backyard garden on account of the popularity of the flower among honeybees. He has to plant them soon before the spring ends or else they won’t be well established enough before their bloom time in late summer.
Castiel stretched his neck up until their faces were even and their noses were nearly touching. They breathed in the same air for a few silent moments. Castiel could feel Dean exhale across his cheek, warm and heavy. Their eyes locked. Castiel admired the way the sunlight streaming in through the bathroom window played off of Dean’s eyelashes.
Castiel had always considered himself a good soldier, until Dean. As far as Castiel was aware, he had been precise and quick in his craft, always making sure to complete whatever he needed to do without fault. But the others had seen through his shiny veneer, seen through the splintered memories and scrambled grace. If he focused hard enough, he could even remember hushed whispers amongst the ranks:
Dean switched on the clippers and got to work. He ran his fingers gently through Castiel’s hair and let it stick up in the path of the clippers so each strand could be cut evenly. Castiel relaxed into Dean’s touch, allowing the buzz of the clippers to wash over him. Starting at the nape of Castiel’s neck, Dean muttered something about a tiny mullet and wiggled his eyebrows. After finishing up that section, he then switched out the shorter guard for a longer one.
Castiel looks over at the cover. “
The interior was a reflection of themselves. Potted plants hugged the window sills, mud-caked boots sat by the door, and a score of jackets and flannels hung on wall hooks in the small foyer. On the side table: a thrifted snuffbox with a small-but-growing postage stamp collection inside. Drilled into the wall: a collage of old license plates that had seen more of the United States than the average American would see in their lifetime. In a drawer: a hollowed-out motel bible with a pair of Enochian brass knuckles tucked safely inside.
He does not know what to say.
“I killed the mood, didn’t I,” he said.
. He had wanted to ask Castiel about the Green Knight’s armor, and although Castiel had never heard of it before, he put it into the logbook anyway.
, the humans call it. A feeling they tell stories about and sing songs in the name of. Castiel has heard many of these narrative tales before, though at the time, he processed the thematic messages as if viewing a scene from a distance. The matter-of-fact realization of Dread—how it fits so easily within him, like it is only natural to be there—is enough to make him stagger. To put a stop to their movement, just for a moment.
“Yes,” Castiel said, and he was already walking from the kitchen to the living room to put a record on.
Castiel looks down at the rut in the road where his knees straddle, the dirt furrow filled with lumps of salt. His palm line and the wheel rut, identical.
When the water began to turn cold, they washed the soap off of their bodies and twisted the shower handle until the water stopped. Reaching beyond the curtain, Dean grabbed a towel off of the rack. He draped it first over Castiel’s head and scrubbed messily over his hair to dry it, and then—before Castiel could grunt a cautionary
Castiel tilted his head a fraction to the side. “Giving you what?”
After a minute of this, Dean broke the silence as he directed Castiel under the stream of water to wash the shampoo away.
It was not a question, and it was not a dig, either. Neither of them seemed to be too broken up about the shift in tone. They were happy enough in each other’s arms and in each other’s presence, and Castiel never wanted Dean to feel like he had to bottle up his emotions around him.
The water was warm against Castiel’s scalp, and he felt the suds trail down his spine and the back of his legs. They disappeared into the drain.
Castiel observed himself in the mirror. His body had aged rapidly over the past four years. It was as if, as an angel, his grace had stretched this body out like a rubber band, keeping it taut and young. But once the grace had left, this body had finally snapped back, catching up on lost years.
“Hello, Dean.”
The water beat down onto their shoulders in a steady stream, and Castiel let his whole body relax, the previous night’s dream dissipating from his mind and the cold air of his morning repose finally leaving his bones. He let his troubles wash down the drain.
It had been years since that night in the crypt—nearly a decade—but that did not mean it hurt any less. Castiel thought about apologizing, again, but knew Dean would not allow it.
—and Castiel would just hold him close, Dean gripping him like he was going to lose him, both of them breathing in rhythm until Dean came off whatever ledge he had found himself on, until they had fallen asleep again.
After Sam and Eileen had decided to turn the bunker into an open safehouse, they had made it their mission to set up an organized system for handling cases—not as hunters, but as rehabilitators. Dean had been bewildered at first, not understanding. After all, the world of hunting was so ensconced in ideas of violence and elimination that an alternative approach seemed ludicrous.
He knows he should not beg. An angel should not beg. But the roaring in his ears and the shuddering of the ground and the way her eyes shine against the luminous glare of grace makes him forget that.
, Castiel wants to insist.
say those things out loud. He forgets that, too.
Still not looking up, Dean spoke. His voice was quiet. “I’m pretty messed up, huh?”
He turns to proceed down the road again. He needs to catch up to his brother and this woman’s husband and her two daughters and explain what happened, why it went wrong, how it is fine, how it will be fine, when his hand catches on rough crystal. A salty mass clasps his palm, wrapping its way around the meaty part of his thumb. His reaction is automatic: to pull away.
“Mmm,” Dean hummed. He crossed his arms in front of his chest and lifted his chin in achievement, apparently pleased. “Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.”
After that, Castiel kissed Dean’s cheek gently. The other man blew out a breath sheepishly as if he was about to laugh, but Castiel drew him back into the moment. Holding the side of Dean’s head in one hand, Castiel placed his lips on Dean’s cheek again and held him there for a long time.
before the whole mass crumbles to the ground.
Positioning both hands on either side of Castiel’s face, Dean inclined his head back and forth as if looking for something. Then his eyes brightened and he pursed his lips. He made a few snips every now and again, still at the same heightened level of focus.
This was hardly the first time Castiel had had this dream. In fact, they had talked about this particular one together before multiple times, as both of them had nightmares often. Things had gotten better over the past four years, the knowledge that they were safe slowly settling into their minds—but the past could only stay away for so long, and time could only smooth out so many wrinkles.
It was different than how Dean would awaken after a nightmare: sweating, on guard, a strangled cry in the back of his throat. In contrast, Castiel usually awoke silently, the only indication of his troubles being tense muscles and heavy breathing through the nose. On those nights, after being reassured by the solid weight of Dean’s back against his chest, Castiel would extricate himself from bed and tread downstairs soundlessly.
Gabriel had once complained. That was right before Castiel’s brother had disappeared.
“If I knew I was gonna be living with the Jolly Green Giant,” Dean mused, dropping the leaf fragment onto the counter, “Maybe I would’ve paid more attention in high school biology. Tunes?”
Castiel hardly believed it was nothing. “What?” he asked again, and this time there was no room for argument. Castiel was not angry or upset. He was just confused.
Now, four years later, Castiel was still on that same mission. Things had gotten more natural over time as they became familiar with each other, not just as best friends, but as lovers. They learned to value each other properly and to forgive each other more easily. They learned to say when something was wrong instead of harboring it inside. They did their best to remember not to retreat into themselves or to push each other away. They put deliberate effort into each other, every day.
Before Castiel had met Dean.
This close, Castiel could see the collection of freckles that brushed across Dean’s nose and cheeks. His stubble caught a few rays of sunlight here and there, and the parts of his irises that most closely surrounded his pupils looked golden against the brilliant green. There was a tiny scar on his left cheekbone, one that Castiel had kissed many times. He automatically reached up to touch it with his thumb.
Dean used his wrist to tilt Castiel’s head to the side to get a better angle. He slid the clippers behind Castiel’s right ear, trying to trim the hair there to a proper length. He had to do it a few times until he was satisfied.
Castiel thought of sitting out on the back porch in the dark, observing the constellations visible at this time of year until the sun rose. “Not too long,” he lied.
Dean looks like he’s about to make a retort but must think better of it. His expression softens. “Dinner’s ready, is all. Shepherd’s pie.”
“But what about Garth?” Sam had countered over a plate of spaghetti during a tense argument in the bunker kitchen. Cas had watched as Dean tried to scramble together a reply. Before he could, Sam continued: “What about Benny?”
“Yup.” Dean popped the
Since Dean was still on a mission to cut his hair, he reached behind Castiel and grabbed a fine-toothed comb from the counter. Running it through the hair at Castiel’s temples—first the right, then the left—Dean brought the hair forward so he could trim it in a neat line, then brush it back.
Definitely not rolling his eyes, Castiel huffed, and he moved closer to stand between Dean and the sink. Dean tapped him in between the shoulder blades.
Castiel reads any language, any time.
Castiel decided it was the latter. And then: “Of course, Dean. I would love to go driving.”
Castiel folded it gingerly and laid it on the corner of the sink next to their toothbrush holder. At the same time, Dean also removed his robe, and he threw it in a sweeping arc out the bathroom door so it caught on the walkway’s balustrade and draped unceremoniously over it. Beyond the railing, music streamed up from their living room down below.
After a while, Dean says, “Hey, Cas?”
Dean, evidently, was not. He had a shit-eating grin plastered across his face and was doing his best not to burst out laughing.
. He picked the book up at a second-hand bookstore in New Haven two months ago and has only now gotten around to reading it, his stack of books accumulating faster than he can get through them. He usually manages two or three per week, but he picks up more, stealing them from Dean, sneaking them into the check-out lane at the grocery store—(“They sell
Dean’s fingers tense up at first, but he soon catches on, looping his thumb through one of Castiel’s and rubbing circles across the skin there. Dean’s hands are calloused, yes, but they are not the sharp edge of salt. Castiel holds his hand closer, his two palms embracing it as if in prayer.
legally dead, and Jimmy Novak had a long-standing position as a missing person that they did not want to mess with.
? Dean had given him freedom. Dean had given him a home. Dean had given him the reassurance that not everything he did was a failure. And how could Castiel, in return, show this man how much he meant to him? How could he tell Dean that he would move worlds for him, that he would rip the fabric of the universe apart one thread at a time if it meant ensuring Dean Winchester’s happiness?
"Well, I'm a bit short for an alpha, so I guess we fit together pretty well." Crowley settled the small, thin saddle in front of Balthazar's shoulders, cinching the wide girth and buckling the chest strap carefully. He had added a heavy buckle on the back of the saddle for another wide strap, a long one that reached down the wolf's spine to his lower back. It attached to a wide belt, a safety mechanism that Rowena had recommended Crowley add.
Cas shook his head. "I don't have any of the signs, but Aunt Amara said maybe in the spring. I spent a long time talking with her over the holidays, and she says that I am still not in complete harmony with my omega. I need to reach that state before I go into heat for the first time."
"They can. I remember that Zach took his own favorite mare to your town fourteen or fifteen years ago to breed with John's horse, producing a big, pure black colt. Some of the Council members were jealous; Zach doesn't share his breeding stock with many people, and they are all fine beasts. Does Khan have any offspring?"
Rowena sighed and leaned back against the wall, glancing at her empty cup and wishing for something stronger. "You know, I had felt some weakening of my bond with my prophet. I thought that it was because of how long she had been gone; after all, no speaker had lived for so long after the death of the prophet. But now I can see that I am losing my link for a completely different an unexpected reason."
"So, how are you feeling, Kevin?"
Charlie sighed and nodded, walking over to settle in the pillows against the wall beside Jo, resting her head on the alpha's shoulder. "I know. I just . . . I
"One of the reasons?"
The guards stopped at the door to Cas's suite, Ishim waiting patiently to escort the trio inside. April was seething but silent, Dean was silent with his eyes on the floor, and Meg was almost bouncing as she entered the room.
"You were always a quiet child, Sam, but if you did fuss only your brother could calm you."
"Just shut up and cook the meat," Samuel replied, nodding as another older beta brought him a beer. "Dean, take your friend out to hang out with the kids in the yard and I'll finish the corn."
"I was just thinking . . . this wing doesn't smell like you."
, he mouthed, falling onto the bed again. He closed his eyes and let his body succumb to the dark, unable to stay awake as the last flicker of his grace struggled within him.
"Yes, they were very expensive."
"Do you have a preference? You've been here over a year, so you've met most of the staff."
"It's changed mine. I wasn't going to be a warrior, and I had no plans to leave my town. I was having issues with matches, but I know that eventually my dad or the Matchmaker would have found me something suitable. I was going to happily settle down with my assigned mate, we would have a few pups, and I would grow old tending our farm and raising them."
"We have a petition from one of the southern farming communities first," Abaddon announced, glancing at Crowley for his permission before waving for the servants to bring in the day's supplicants. Abaddon held court in the mornings, Crowley taking over the serious cases from noon until about two or three, then highly-ranked witches and noble half-witches would spend the rest of the afternoon filtering the next day's requests. It was organized and efficient, two things that Crowley prided himself on.
"Many of you will find that you have a preference for partners, a preference that might be based on gender, subgender, or some other trait that appeals to you. It's normal to have a preference, even if you find that you need a different type of partner during your heats or ruts."
Jo shrugged and waited as Charlie knocked on the door, both women entering a moment later. The sunlight fell across the pale blue blankets wrapped around a slender form in the single bed, Rowena turning her head to acknowledge their presence but not uttering a sound.
Lucifer tucked his carefully-folded tips into his pocket as they headed for the car. "Almost a hundred, but I spent half the time in the kitchen. Ellen said it was busier tonight than she's seen in a while. You served tables most of the time; how did you do?"
This chapter and the next two were all one and therefore way too long, so I decided to cut this one to be more Crowley/Balthy centric (Crowlazar? Balthley? What would their ship name be?), the second to be Destiel, and the third to be more Sabriel with some Destiel and Benny/Gadreel (Bendreel? Nah idk)
"I don't know," Balthazar answered honestly. "We need to talk to Crowley or Rowena about it; they know a lot more than I do. My brothers and I are part of the prophecy, but I don't think you are. I guess you're just the two messengers meant to be born this generation."
"It is imbued with some of the small spells I can perform. If you touch the rune on the head, the eyes will glow with a brilliant light, similar to my witch light spell. One of the runes produces a spell that can temporarily cover your scent, make you completely untraceable. There are other spells, and I can show you how to use all of them."
Mary entered the kitchen looking for her husband, both of them still dressed from the party at the mayor's office. Clearly they had returned only a few minutes before their oldest son. Dean sighed and leaned against the counter, pointing at the celery and not speaking until the omega started eating. "A couple of college alphas spiked the punch a few hours after we arrived and tricked Cas into having a few cups. It wasn't that strong, thankfully, but he did have quite a bit. They convinced him not to tell me about it, but we did and Benny had them thrown out. He doesn't have any of the common symptoms of alcohol poisoning but I was going to watch him overnight just to be sure."
Dean leaned back slightly and helped Cas raise his head, staring deep into the omega's eyes. "I guess I didn't realize how much you'd grown since I met you. How long until your heat?"
Crowley noticed the young omega's actions, nudging Balthazar and nodding toward his sister. The lean beta shook his head and returned to his food, indicating that Crowley should do the same. "
Aurora could totally be a guy's name and you will probably recognize Cas's clothing near the end as related to a recent Misha picture. I regret nothing.
"I had to, Cas. You were going to get hurt. Now that Rowena's done with her call, she can tell us what happened to Balthazar."
Mshindi crouched in front of the younger omega, staring into his white eyes. "Did you smell anything that would help identify this other man? I'm honestly surprised that I have featured in one of your visions, especially given how short our association has been thus far."
The blonde pulled back, shock in his pale blue eyes. "You mean . . . our brothers?"
Dean grunted as he broke the first bar free, switching to the second one and wiggling that one out, also. As soon as he created a large enough gap, the hunter squeezed through into Cas’s cell, crouching down on the mattress beside his angel and casting his eyes across his injured wings.
"Yeah, pretty much. It's why they like us so much."
Sam nodded and cupped Gabriel's cheek in his hand. "I'll be right back, okay? Just stay warm."
There was a long pause, Charlie's green eyes widening in shock as the pack waited to see how the firecracker would respond. Dean broke first though, laughing at the look on his friend's face as he clapped Cas on the chest with his free hand. "Cas, man, don't ever change. I haven't seen anyone silence her in almost three years."
"Yeah. Go ahead and get dressed and we'll head back."
"What about my next one? What's going to happen then?"
“They aren’t,” Cas replied ominously. The three men entered a large clearing as another tremor shook the ground, the wind slowing as darkness fell around them. The angel moved to stand in front of the hunters, his eyes glowing with grace as an ominous shudder passed through him.
You know, after what he did in 13x22, I am finding it very hard to want to heal Michael instead of killing him.
He spotted the guard almost immediately, shifting forms and grabbing his supply bag as the taller man approached. Balthazar recognized him as the dark-haired alpha who was often standing outside Crowley's study in the mornings when he visited. He searched his memories for the frowning man's name, finally remembering it as the alpha stopped in front of him.
Cas was silent for a long time, his blue eyes focused on their path. When he finally spoke, Dean stumbled in shock.
The omega slowly nodded, her purple eyes dark. “Yes, maybe, but there is no guarantee that she will help, even if she can. Rowena is unpredictable—”
Cas made a note of that, too; he hadn't had any sexual urges yet, but he had seen changes in his body that prefaced the arrival of his presentation. He had been curious about them, but there was a whole section in the little booklet that he could read later. He knew that Gabe masturbated, often loudly but always in another room, and he wasn't inclined to talk to his younger brother about what he was feeling. Balth, who had had more sexual partners than both of his older brothers combined, would never talk about his conquests, other than assuring Mike that he was always safe and he always used protection. This class was good, Cas decided; he wanted to know about all of this before he had to face his first heat.
Jo reached out with curled fingers and brushed her knuckles against Charlie's collarbone. In her pack, it was a friendly, open gesture of respect between equals. Startlingly green eyes rose to scrutinize the alpha's face, a slow grin spreading across the young witch's face. "You came, too," Jo murmured. "It couldn't have been easy, putting yourself at the mercy of this pack in the hope that you could help one broken omega find his voice."
find a suitable mate if you fail at this! Sam, if you can't distinguish yourself fighting the Huns, then do yourself a favor and at least die with honor so you don't have to come back and live in disgrace as the
“What if . . .” Sam trailed off, a look of pain darkening his features before he gained control of his emotions. “What if Lucifer helped you?”
Kevin paused in his folding, tilting his head curiously. "I don't understand, Dean. I promised you that I was going to get you into battle, save your honor, and get you home. If you were so relieved when Castiel tried to boot you out, why did you fight so hard to stay?"
"Yeah. We were here last time Mother bred, and it was uncomfortable for all of us. Max and I thought it would be better for everyone if our parents had free run of the house when the female omegas go into heat." She lowered her bow, staring at the engraved wood as she bit her lower lip. "Mother lost her last pup, and she was devastated. Rowena promised her that she would be able to have another, and we want to make sure she has the best chance possible."
Adam reached up to run his fingers through Alfie's hair, smiling as the boy purr-hiccupped in his sleep. "Is this how you feel around Mom? This kinda warm, tingling inside you that makes you want to smile when she's around?"
"You're not the omega I want right now," Dean whispered, digging his fingers into the loamy soil at the edge of the water. Winter was truly fading now, with most of the snow melted and no clouds in the sky. Spring was only a week or so away.
Jo reached out and squeezed Charlie's arm, offering whatever support she could. "Why are you scared? Rowena said that there hasn't been a prophet in five hundred years."
Dean repeated that promise, green eyes watching the black omega intently. He leaned forward and sniffed in the direction of the white and black wolves, his eyes narrowing as he looked over his shoulder at Jo and Benny.
They lapsed into silence and watched the omegas cavorting in the snow and practicing aerial dive-bombs on each other. It took a couple of hours for the wolves to tire of their games, finally sauntering over to the fire and plopping down beside their friends. Dean reached down and ran his fingers through Cas's black fur, grinning as the omega almost purred under his hand. "How are you feeling after that?" Cas growl-barked something back, falling on his side and staring up at the alpha with one blue eye. "That tired, huh?"
"Nope, that's all I know. I knew when the four of you were born, of course, but there was only one surge of power each year. I didn't realize there were four of you until I met Balthazar. I could see the bone structure that indicated a winged Celestial, though no one else alive would know how to accurately identify you."
would be good parents, so talking about it with Max was poking at some wounds he would rather not think about. "A dozen is pushing it, but I think I know why he truly worries. I think that he still has this image in his mind of me, bleeding from the gashes on my leg the first time he saw me. I was half-starved and I could easily have bled out then and there. I would have if Asmodeus has been trying to kill me instead of kidnap me. I have to find a way to convince him that I'm not fragile and that I have healed from that attack."
"Yeah, Sammy, I was just thinking that. I'm pretty sure this is porcupine, but I've never been able to kill one in form."
"I will." Adam clenched his hands against his chest as his oldest brother galloped off into the increasingly violent storm, the rain washing away his tears. He feared that he would never see Dean again.
"Ok," Dean replied uncertainly, turning to face the lean blond with his staff held in a defensive position. Balthazar bowed his head, unconcerned with his injuries from the night before, and swung his staff forward. Dean easily countered the move, grunting as the bamboo snapped back from the force of the impact and moving into the next form they had practiced. Slowly, without the alphas harassing him, tripping him, or ganging up on him, Dean managed to get through the entire exercise, grinning back at Balthazar as the alpha struggled to break through his defenses.
Dean rolled his eyes, glancing over his shoulder at the pack of alphas eagerly trying to tear each others' throats out. He had seen fights like that back home, usually between five or so alphas, and they always ended before blood was spilled or any serious damage was done. It was far too easy to get alphas riled up, and as soon as the fight started no one wanted to be the first to back down. A couple of dominant betas had joined in, but most of them were trying to pull as many combatants out of the fray as they could. "I've never gone for that sort of violence. Fighting with cause is one thing, but there's no reason to give into our animalistic urges."
The omega slipped out of his clothes and dropped them on the floor, turning to face Crowley as he shifted into his wolf form. Eyes never leaving the Spellbound alpha, Balthazar flexed his shoulders and released his wings, opening them as wide as he could, watching as Crowley's eyes widened in shock.
Balthazar looked up and grinned, biting his lower lip in a way that was definitely
"Arranged marriages or not, Gad, Gabe, and Alfie deserve to have compatible mates who will treat them as kindly as Cas, Anna, and I do," Balthazar added. "You want the same thing for your brother, and we can respect that."
Fireworks shot out in all directions, mostly into the sky, and exploded in blue, green, red, and every color in between. Dean reached the edge of the roof moments before the multi-colored explosion reached him, jumping off the building and throwing Kevin free as he used both hands to grab one of the lanterns to ride it toward the ground, even as his friends had used the lantern line to escape earlier. He knew that Kevin would be able to land on his own, both being smaller and more durable than a squishy human, and as a dragon spirit he was virtually indestructible. Dean lost his grip above the palace stairs, falling on Cas who had finally made it out of the palace himself. They both rolled a couple of times, ending up on their backs as Dick's sword, still smoking from the explosion, landed in front of them.
Dean sat up taller. "My car can carry six, though it might be a bit tight. Sam and Adam can sit in the back with Gabe; Balthazar and Cas can sit up front." Cas, still awkwardly wrapped in Dean's arms, grinned to himself, remembering his surety earlier that afternoon that the alpha had a car and was going to offer him a ride. Then, it would have bothered him, would have felt like a threat from an alpha who just wanted in his pants, but now . . . now it felt safe. It felt like Dean was trying to look out for them.
"So, are you going to tell me about these fantasies?"
Mary grinned at Sam's shocked reaction, heading toward the omega wing to gather up the stragglers. "Sam, grab Ash, Kevin, and Ruby from the alpha wing, would you?" She heard an affirmative response as she reached the first closed door in the omega wing, the one that had been assigned to Anna Novak.
During that time, Gabe joined the archery club and had his own schedule on Saturdays, Ruby always giving him a ride when his brothers weren't able to. His after-school hours were devoted to soccer, the diminutive omega shocking everyone when he outperformed and outmaneuvered most of the older and alpha teens. Alfie and Anna had started getting a ride from their school to the High School after class, spending time in whatever clubs Adam and Ash attended that day, quickly taking their places as members of the pack. Anna and Ash were an unlikely couple, the older beta bowing to the firecracker's every whim, but somehow it worked for them.
Rowena grinned and ran her fingers across the tattoo just below her elbow. "Maggie has solved that issue for us, as a matter of fact. She just contacted me to let me know that her spell worked and she was able to imbue the memory magic into a set of scrolls that she will send to us with Balthazar, Ruby, and Meg. Each scroll will allow the holder to memorize the entire ritual after reading it once, then it will fade organically when we are finished. Conveniently, she also placed a time marker on the pages that will let us know when Fergus begins his ritual."
Cas snorted at that, smiling at his young friend. He was warming to the pup a lot faster than he thought he would, especially after Steve's dismal start in the army. "Our own mother doesn't approve of him most of the time. He's going to be a hard one to find a mate for, or so Donna tells me. Friends he has in abundance, and this army training will do him good. I know you were conscripted, but you can always ask for a commission when your service is over. You could stay here, in this life, even if you were assigned a suitable mate. You'd be stationed with our platoon, so you could go home frequently and the army allows time off for heats, births, and harvest season. It's not a bad gig, if you wanted it to be permanent."
Ishim did smile at that, a tiny twitching of his lips, bowing his head slightly. "If that is your wish, Highness, I shall obey." He reached out and helped Inias to his feet, gently leading the beta to the door. He was always so reserved and gentle around the concubine, and Cas wondered why it had taken Dean to show him how much they cared for each other. He smiled as the two headed out.
"Okay," Gabe breathed, pushing back against Sam, "I can do that."
"Which is certainly one of the reasons why I wanted an outdoor party. Think how lovely those pictures are going to look!"
the blue male purred, his mental voice deep and soothing. It was clear that he was the peacemaker among the four.
Dean collapsed on the bench beside Cas, grinning as the alpha patted his shoulder. "This is a bit more walking than you're used to, huh?"
Cas smacked Dean on the shoulder as he realized that the hunter was actually
"Ultimate dishonor," Metatron sneered in Dean's face as he winced away.
"Can't say I understand that. I wasn't much to love back then."
He glanced over at the mahogany wolf strolling beside him.
Zachariah sneered at Anna and Lucifer, stalking out of the throne room and heading back to the wolves who had accompanied him to Michael's palace. Malachi nodded once in acceptance of his Head Alpha's decision, leaving with a great deal less fuss, his three children Azrael, Ezekiel, and Sophia detaching themselves from the wall and following him out. Michael and Raphael left through the side door, a few of the councilors hurrying after them. Anna nodded at Lucifer as her brother headed out to the gardens, the redhead taking Akobel's arm and leading him out of the throne room.
Sam frowned at the book on ancient artifacts he had found, making note of which ones he had seen in the inventory list and which ones they might want to consider tracking down. He was reading about a particularly interesting necklace that was thought to be in Israel somewhere when every lightbulb in the bunker shattered, sparks falling to the floor as a high-pitched keen sounded through the halls before fading. Dax screeched once in concern and then quieted down in his cage.
Dean settled the horses and put out their food, grateful that it wasn't cold enough to freeze their water, giving himself another dose of his scent blockers and boiling a quick cup of tea. Kevin, who had tired of army rations, nibbled on a small fish he'd grabbed out of the river and used his fire breath to blacken, eyes watching Dean as the omega finished his tea. "How are you doing?"
move?
Crowley snorted, watching as Ash's face fell from fury to shock at the girl's request. "It's not really a kid's game, hun."
Gabe groaned as his alpha's erection rubbed against his ass,
“When I’m near you,” Cas whispered, curling up to the hunter again.
“We need your help to stop him from wreaking havoc on Earth.”

"You don't think five is the worst?"
The witch chuckled and hugged Meg, waiting until the beta calmed somewhat before speaking. "Meg, Fergus will understand that I have to go where I am called. Balthazar's family and that Winchester boy's pack need me and Charlie more than they know, and it will take all winter to sort them out. Balthazar needs to spend time with our pack; the fate of all three lands depends on what he does while he is there. I can't always see the future clearly, but I can see his paw prints next to yours and Ruby's in the snow. That
"He clearly doesn't understand his place here. An alpha protects those under his care, and he clearly failed tonight."
"Jo, that's wonderful!" Sam grinned and leaned forward to offer Jo a quick hug, glancing at his brother to gauge his reaction before speaking again. "Why do you have to leave, though? It's not uncommon for the alpha to join her omega's pack, but generally it's the other way around."
"A lot of trees, the mountains to the north, and a desert to the south."
Cas half-turned to Dean, gold still ringing his eyes but no longer dominant. Still some level of drunk, the boy nodded, wavering slightly as his balance started to fail him. John reached out and caught him, carefully leading the boy back to his chair, all anger gone from both of their scents. "Yeah, kid, I think he did say something like that. Look, he's right; you didn't do anything wrong. I guess it's just my instincts as Head Alpha to protect, and I took out my frustration on you. I'm sorry, Dean."
wear too many layers?" Cas roughly jerked the hunter's leather jacket off and tossed it on a nearby chair, slipping him free of his blue flannel over-shirt and gesturing for Dean to take off his gray t-shirt. "Dean, three layers down and you are still clad in a tank top."
"Balthazar." He held out his arms, palms up, and smiled as Crowley reached out to grasp his elbows, leaving behind a trace of his scent. "I'm a son of Chuck and Naomi."
Sam stood there for what felt like an eternity, his breaths steady even as the light of his soul flared with barely-constrained passion and desire. "Do you trust me?"
“Gabriel, are you going into heat?” He kept his voice low enough that even his own brother couldn’t hear, and thankfully the other three omegas were absorbed with formation instructions and didn’t notice.
"My cousin is a Lure. She was hounded mercilessly when she was younger, until a couple of her friends took it upon themselves to beat up most of the alphas in her school. From what I heard about lunch yesterday, it seems that Dean kinda did the same thing for you." Cas nodded, not entirely sure where this girl with the lilting voice was going with her probing. A moment later, though, she broke into a wide grin, leaning forward to offer her hand to the young omega. "If Dean thinks you're worth kicking some ass for, I guess you're alright in my book. I'm Meg."
The guard shook his head, somehow steadier on his feet as glowing crimson eyes rose to meet his muddy brown. "I'm not! I've been loyal to you for decades, fighting by your side against Cain and in the recent Celestial skirmish. Why would I lie?"
Gabriel didn't move, didn't blink, having no way to communicate with this woman. He didn't recognize her accent, but the power pulsing off of her slender form was palpable. Her purple eyes bore into his, and he felt his wolf retreat, his fur and wings fading and just leaving
"It'll be at least a day before they're usable again," Max added, helping the sleepy youngest omega into a sitting position before rising to his feet and stretching. "Alicia may not return for two or three nights, but she generally finds a male beta in town to spend the time with."
"I'm surprised you didn't slap one on me the minute you got me back to the palace."
"Yeah, we will. Dad will be working on Christmas Eve and the night of Christmas Day, but he'll be with us until lunch so we can do the presents/family thing."
“I am not sure, Dean,” the angel growled back, his blade in one hand and his other held out to the side defensively as he tried to stay in front of the hunter. Sam, his gun at the ready and an angel blade in his belt, hovered at the edge of the trees, struggling to see into the gloom. The ground shook again, Dean spreading his legs wider to keep his balance. A bright light filled the clearing and Castiel gasped, reaching back to grab Dean’s arm. “We have to go, now.” For the first time since the angels fell, Cas cursed his burnt wings and weakened powers. Now, more than ever, he needed to be able to send Dean and Sam far away; anywhere would be safer than this clearing.
Despite all the violence in the world, humans still got up every morning, drank their coffee, and searched for compassion. Even when everything was telling them to give up and lie down. Especially then.
“I trust you.”
In the other room, Dean is making dinner. Castiel can smell onions caramelizing in the pan, can hear them sizzling over the rolling sound of k. d. lang’s voice. He chews the inside of his bottom lip and tries to read the words in front of him, but can’t.
And Castiel meant it. He dragged his hand down Dean’s cheek and let it rest on his shoulder.
Castiel’s eyes lock onto those of the woman. They are brown, and damp, and surrounded by wrinkles. Her shawl has slipped down onto her forehead and her mouth twists in anguish. As her wool skirts flutter in the harsh wind—a force that tells them to

she re-shoulders the mass in her arms. It's an ewe. The animal wriggles under the wide segment of cloth that is strapped to her chest.
“At the time . . .” Castiel hunts through his memories, now organized in a non-linear, very human jumble. He searches for the right words. “At the time, I had a suspicion that it wasn’t the first time something like that had happened. Sometimes I find there are blips in my memory—a few hours, a few days. I think that’s why it took me a little while to introduce myself to you, after raising you. Because of the mark I put on you. The accidental claim. I must have been . . . punished.”
Dean stepped backwards to observe his work. Castiel still had his hand on Dean’s shoulder, but he had to extend his arm to reach Dean at this length. Dean’s back rested easily against the towel rack on the opposite wall.
“Okay,” Dean says. “Okay—um.” He looks past Castiel in the direction Castiel was originally facing. “The—uh—the flower stand? Do you—want to go? Or we can go home?”
The first networking group had been Garth and his extended family, getting into contact with as many other lycanthropes as they could, trying to convince them to “go green”, as Dean had put it.
Dean blinks in surprise and freezes. Of course he remembers. One doesn’t exactly forget being beaten within an inch of their life easily.
They hold onto memories, onto heirlooms, and onto beliefs. They hold hands when they are happy and hold one another in their arms when they are sad. They hold each other up. They weave blankets to wrap around their shaking shoulders to hold them tightly when no one else is there to do it. They sew pockets into jackets to hold all of their treasures. They build houses to hold their families. They film movies about brooding men in cowboy hats who like to hold up banks. And, of course, they put all of their ingenuity together a very long time ago and made the bag.
They sit in heavy silence after Castiel ends the story.
Castiel moves on quickly, not wanting Dean to linger on painful memories. “Then there was the time when Sam and Lilith were in that motel room, and I told you about prophets being protected by archangels.”
Cool, dawn air settled softly on the grass, where droplets of dew reflected the pink light of morning. It was early autumn now, and the Earth was just beginning to dip its toes into the season. Beyond the sightline of the small yard was the home garden, where sweet potatoes and butternut squash grew in wooden planter boxes, next to which arugula spread itself across rich loam. Its green leaves blended in with the not-yet mature tips of carrots and an unruly assortment of cranberry bushes. The sundry group of fruits and vegetables hugged the soil around three cedar beehives that seemed to sprout from the ground. And there, at the far edge of the garden, was the treeline.
“You look good, Cas,” Dean said from behind.
Castiel nods stiffly and does not meet Dean’s eyes. “I know.”
“On the side, then.”
The rest of the shower was spent in pleasant quietude, excluding a murmured story told by Castiel about the invention of water pipes and, shortly after, a rather crude joke about pipes cracked by Dean. Castiel rolled his eyes and gently swatted him with a bottle of body wash.
“She didn’t do anything wrong, when she looked back.” Dean rubs his nose with his hand and glances at the ceiling as if reading something that’s written there. He is unhurried with the words, taking care to make sure they are correct. “‘And Lot’s wife, of course, was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been. But she did look back, and I love her for that, because it was so human. She was turned into a pillar of salt. So it goes.’”
, Castiel had once heard it called on a morning talk show. Then, Dean plugged the clippers into the wall outlet. He motioned for Castiel to come closer.
. Less experienced hunters would usually call one of the landlines about a strange object or ask about lore. Occasionally, there was a request for backup. Dean and Castiel had been informed of a haunted rifle at some museum in Boston last month through a contact, and the two of them had driven down to handle it.
In a sudden motion, Castiel jerks backward and wrenches his hand away. His body collides with something behind him, a wooden post connected to a cheese stand, and he flinches at the contact as he staggers forward again. Dean catches him by the shoulders. Concern flashes in his eyes.
He was so fond of this man.
He put the milk back in the fridge and settled himself down on a stool at their small island table. He had a good view of Dean’s back, swathed in the fabric of the Men of Letters’ robe. In spite of Dean’s ABBA aversion, Castiel caught the man’s head bobbing up and down as “When I Kissed The Teacher” faded out into “Dancing Queen.” Castiel smiled into his coffee as he took a long sip.
“Whatcha reading?” Dean asks through a mouthful of shepherd’s pie.
It was almost overwhelming: how beautiful Dean was, how luminous, how breathtaking. And how he was Castiel’s.
At this, Dean’s mouth goes slack. They don’t talk about Hell often.
Maybe a fellow in a mustard button-down who is sweating rather profusely under the stage-lights and even more profusely under the gaze of millions of Americans will press his buzzer and answer, quite confidently, “What is the rock?”
And then there was something big in Western Europe—France? He shut his eyes, trying to concentrate. All he could manage to bring to the front of his mind was a fragmented memory congealed together in gold leaf and blood. He remembered being angry about something. He could not recall what.
After finishing up behind the other ear—the most difficult part of the haircut now behind him—Dean tousled the hair at the crown of Castiel’s head, just careful enough to keep it parted in the correct place. Dean kept the right side shorter than the left, as Castiel liked it, then switched to scissors to handle the mess on the top.
A calloused hand plants itself gently on Castiel’s cheek. Castiel blinks up to find Dean staring at him, the space between his brows dimpled with worry and his mouth half-opened in question. Castiel opens his own to say something—anything—but the words stick in his throat.
Afterward, Castiel had insisted on washing Dean up. It had been quite a change of pace from their escapade a few minutes before, Castiel being as slow and gentle with Dean then as he was being now. Dean had been flustered by the interaction, not expecting Castiel to do such a thing. Later that night, once both of them were warm and clean and lying in bed, Dean confessed that he had never done anything like that before. Not even with Lisa.
“Sweater, off.”
When Dean and Castiel had moved here four years ago, they decided to choose Mary’s maiden name, Campbell, just as Sam and Dean had once done when they were living together in Lebanon. Sam had already adopted Leahy, even though he and Eileen were only engaged.
. That is, of course, if there were any birds left to serve as witness.
Dean faltered, his attention snapping back to Castiel’s eyes. Luckily the scissors had not been close to his head. A flush crept up Dean’s cheeks, and he looked down at the tile where tufts of Castiel’s hair lay.
How long ago had that been? A case in California, before Jack had been born.
“How long you been awake?” Dean asked. He did it with strained nonchalance, as he always did when he was concerned.
“Yo, Cas. Baby—spin?”
So, Castiel reached over to the lip of the tub where a few bottles stood. He plucked one up—the shampoo—and squeezed a bit onto his hand before clicking the top shut and setting it back down. Rubbing the pearly substance between his palms for a few seconds, Castiel then placed his hands on top of Dean’s head and began to scrub. Dean’s hair was short, so it didn’t take long for the shampoo to turn bubbly. He continued to massage his fingers into Dean’s scalp long after his hair was clean.
A red leaf fluttered from the wooded area and settled lightly on the sun-washed, weather-beaten back porch. Castiel bent forward slowly, making sure to not knock over the mug of coffee that sat on the arm of the chair. Taking the stem in between two fingers, he sat back and lifted the leaf to his face, rubbing the front of the leaf clean with his thumb. Castiel adjusted his hands to hold the sleeves of his sweater in his palms to starve away the brisk air.
Castiel watches as Dean’s eyes go up and away, trying to access the memory: the pink backwash of the neon motel sign, the chilly night air, the
According to author Ursula K. Le Guin, the first tool made and used by mankind was the bag. Any vessel counts: a cupped leaf, a hollowed gourd, a braided net, a woven pouch. There is something inherently human about it, to want to hold something close, to want to hold something so close so badly that you use those dexterous fingers you’ve been blessed with to modify your environment, unknowingly propelling your species toward a future of other tools: the hammer, the spear, the knife, the arrow, the sword. The gun. The locomotive. The radio. The television. And, if you are lucky, you will be born on the cosmic timeline during that tiny period—that tiny blip—where you can turn on one of those big, beautiful, human televisions and watch
