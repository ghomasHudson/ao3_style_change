Emmanuel nodded and dean took a bite of his burger.
"I don't know. Something he would like, whatever that might be"
Hours later emmanuel had gone home. Dean lied on his bed and held onto his phone. He was waiting for emmanuel to text him, like he said he would.
"Well you can stay here as long as you need okay?"
Dean: great :D do you want me to pick you up?
"Did you buy him with your girlfriend?"castiel asked
"Hmmm. You should wear a red tie, suits you"dean smiled
Dean and emmanuel stood infront of each other. Dean wasn't dancing so emmanuel grabbed his hands and started swinging them around.
Emmanuel: I do not know what that means dean
"You doing alright?"
-----
"Yes"he smiled
Dean knew that sleeping with emmanuel was wrong because it wasn't cas. Even though he said he was beginning to remember, which was great. He still slept with him whilst he was engaged. Emmanuel was going to break off the wedding but dean had told him not to. He didn't want sam to find out that he was sleeping with emmanuel. he wanted to take it slow and then tell sam and Bobby. Then also emmanuel would leave daphne, before they got married.
"Don't you think he would have remembered something by now"
"What?"dean asked
"This is dean..."
"Dean, could you help me with something first?"emmanuel asked
Emmanuel slowly looked up at dean. He wrapped his arms around Deans neck and hugged him tight. Dean wrapped his around emmanuels waist.
"What about this man?"Castiel pointed to the picture of a young dean and an older man "is he your father?"
"Oh" Dean sighed and looked away. "Do you even want to marry her?"
Dean smiled before slowly and softly pressing his lips to cas'. Dean grabbed a handful of cas' trench coat to pull him as close as possible. Dean slid off the impala hood and pulled cas with him. he stood on the ground as cas stayed sat on the hood. Dean stood between cas' parted legs. They kissed again, this time more rough and passionate. Cas grabbing handfuls of deans hair with both hands. Dean pulling on cas' trenchcoat and gripping the side of his face.
"It's not giving up dean. It's letting him go"
"You are a great friend dean Winchester. I know you are sorry, we were both quite drunk I guess"
"That's a lot of fruit"
"A pigeon hit me"
"Planning his wedding"
"she used a spell to transport herself somewhere else. We have to find her"cas said and walked past dean, sam and danny. All three of them then followed cas back to the car.
"help"dean said to sam and cas.
"Kissed?"
Dean just looked up into those bright blue eyes he knew were so familiar. Dean shook his head.
"Wow"dean whispered
"Saved you?"sam asked
Dean looked back at his phone and continued talking to emmanuel.
"Okay. Me and sam and going to the bar. Leave you and dean to it"bobby said
Sam stood up and grabbed Deans arm turning him back around.
"I'll drive you dean"
It took a long time for castiel to fall asleep after that.
"Goodbye emmanuel"
"was I dead? Did I die?"danny asked
"Are you trying to seduce me?"dean joked and winked at emmanuel
"so what do we do about my shadow?"dean asked
The other man helped him up and then walked him towards a car.
"Morning"dean smiled as he picked up the coffee castiel had made him.
Dean sighed. The witch smiled widely at cas. Cas shook his head and then looked at dean who looked right back at him.
Daphne took a second to wipe her eyes then she stood infront of emmanuel.
"yeah. I remember meeting him. his soul shone brighter than anything I had ever seen. They say anegls true forms are the most beautiful things in the world, but his soul. Oh god his soul. It was enough to make any angel stop and stare considering the pain he endured, it shouldn't have shone as bright as it did when they saw it, but it did, because he was a fighter"
"Hi"dean smiled back "I'm surprised to see you here"
"Wanna dance?"dean asked as he held out his hand towards castiel.
"So why here?"sam asked
"danny?"dean asked
"the witch asked you if you've ever been in love"
After they were done eating cas took out his phone and turned on a familiar song.
"Cause the walls start shaking. The earth was quaking. My mind was acheing. And we were making it and you-"
Dean took a deep breath and then turned back around.
Dean rubbed his face with his hands. he was snapped out of his thaughts when his phone buzzed.
"Not your fault cas"dean said and started walking back towards him.
"Cas, can you hear me?...you probably can't but I'm going to try anyway. Listen cas I don't know what's going on. I don't know if this emmanuel guy I met is you. I hope he is...then maybe..maybe I can get you back. I'm sorry about everything cas. I know why you did what you did. You were trying to do the right thing. I've done some pretty stupid stuff for the same reason. I was a dick to you for it and you didn't deserve that"dean sighed and rubbed his hand over his mouth "I'm probably just talking to no-one right now. I just...I miss you buddy. Maybe I'll see you soon"
Both men shook hands
"Emmanuel?"bobby asked
The man with the big, black, fancy car.
"What is your name?"castiel asked
"woah woah woah. I thaught that was supposed to break the spell?"dean asked
"It's okay"castiel sighed and stood up slowly "you just startled me. I wasn't expecting that"he chuckled softly
Jet barked and ran towards the door. He got there just as dean walked through.
"It's a good day sammy"dean relied smiling
"Cas"dean whispered
"Me too"
There was a woman at the end of the corridor. She had long dark brown hair and light makeup on her face.
"You know me too well"dean smiled and started eating
"Well"the man smiled "I saved your ass from falling off that bridge, I wasn't about to let you freeze to death afterwards"
Dean put his head to cas'.
"thank you cas"dean smiled as he took them
"Yes. This is where I was supposed to go"castiel sighed "I was supposed to meet my boyfriend here. I've never been here before and I don't know where he is in the city"
"You love him?"bobby asked
"Oh yes. It got in through the window and flew into my face"
Both of them laughed and Dean took emmanuel's hand. He led him to the dance floor where there were already a lot of people dancing.
"im sure we will find the witch before anything bad happens dean"
"I could do that yeah, Bobby will sure give you a discount" Dean laughed in reply.
Dean nodded and emmanuel moved slightly closer. Dean would usually be uncomfortable with how close they were but somehow he was okay with it. Maybe because in a way, it's was just cas.
"What the hell are you doing?"
"That looked okay"sam smiled
"Yeah"dean sighed"I was getting the fruit he taught it was for me I told him it was for my brother"
"I had to apologise"
"woah. Tough day for that guy"dean chuckled
Dean ignored him and pulled out what sam could see where their FBI suits.
"he has dark blonde hair. Hes tall but not too tall just more so than me"cas chuckled "his smile could light up the universe, though he doesn't do it much. His eyes are green like it would be described in a book. They were just that bright"
"I'll let you both say your goodbyes I guess. I'll finish talking to the receptionist over there"balthazar said and walked back to the desk
Bobby walked down the stairs and then paused once he saw cas. He smiled and then began to walk slowly towards him.
"Then why are you acting like this?"
"It's still cas. Maybe I can get him to remember"
Castiel looked around and realised they were walking along the bridge where he met dean. Where dean saved his life.
"Let's wait a little longer. Take me back cas" dean asked with tears in his eyes
As they were cleaning the flour and dried cherry juice from the counters. As they were cleaning emmanuel took out his phone and connected it to a speaker.
"I don't know what you mean"
"I'm teaching you well"
"So...what I don't get us, why you are suddenly remembering"
He then quickly knocked on the door. He could hear jets nails clicking on the hardwood flooring. The door opened seconds later and dean was there. He was still wearing the suit from the ball, but the tie was undone and hanging loosely.
He stood up and pulled dean up. "This isn't the kind of song you dance to cas"
*My nights are broken up by the sounds of women I'll never meet*
"Can I smell pie?"dean asked as he sniffed up
"i've yet to ask him"
Emmanuel: this is an emergency. I'm bored. Daphne is asleep.
"I didn't mean to scare you"the man said slowly "I won't hurt you, okay?"
"Urmm. Yeah....yeah I do"dean quickly replied and looked away from emmanuel
Cas looked away uncomfortably. Dean stopped staring and looked down at his hands. His heart was beating in his chest. This was cas, cas was there stood next to him. But he wasn't looking at him like cas does. It's like he's a different person.
Dean was rushing around as if he was drunk. Sam knew he wasn't though, drunk dean wasn't like this. Dean was rushing around as if he was happy. Sam noticed it was Deans cover up. His eyes were red as if he'd been crying.
"Tell me dean. Tell me you want me and I won't marry daphne"
"And what's that?"balthazar asked
Deans face softened and he leaned back again in his chair.
Castiel couldn't believe what he was hearing. Dean liked him. Dean wanted him. About as much as castiel wanted dean.
"Well good. Cas can see the witch even if she's disguised. Should be an easy hunt"
"I'm not. I got nothing worth stealing anyway"dean smiled
"This isn't his life. This is 'emmanuel's' life. Sam I don't even think he loves her. She asked him to marry her and he was just too polite to say no"
"And I am surprised to see you"castiel chuckled
-----
Castiel stopped drying his mug and froze. He took a deep breath.
"how would you know castiel?"the witch asked "have you ever been in love?"
------
"Dean, what are you trying to accomplish my talking to that boy?"
Someone cleared their throat to their left and they both looked over.
"take the curse off of dean or I will kill you"cas threatened
"Try and get him back"
The room was now uncomfortably silent. Dean walked over to emmanuel and stood infront of him. Emmanuel was looking at the ground and crying lightly.
When they got jet from the vets he imedietly jumped on dean and started locking his face. He then sniffed castiel cautiously before licking his hand and then jumping up on him too.
Dean moaned around his fork full of pie "this is incredible. I might just have to keep you here, lock you in my kitchen"dean joked
"Dean I'm sorry"castiel said quietly
Dean struggles to leave Emmanuel alone. Sam tells Dean that he's making a mistake when Dean starts texting Emmanuel. The song towards the end of this chapter is marketed with *. The song is called sorry by Jack garret.
The next morning castiel woke up early. Dean was already awake and in the shower so castiel made them both coffee for when dean was ready.
Emmanuel started walking over.
"Dean"sam said
Let me worry about it
Cas bit his bottom lip and looked up into deans eyes as he realised he'd been staring at Deans bare chest "what?"
Cas stabbed the witch through her heart with his angel blade. She died and her body fell to the ground.
"Be with me now. I can be cas again. I don't need to remember before, we can start from now and Dean and cas, no more emmanuel"
Dean turned to walk out of the room "I wont"
"How long have you known her?"
Cas linked his fingers of both hands in Deans. He put the side of his head to Deans. Then dean released one hand and stroked cas' back with it.
"Well you don't know me, not really anyway. Maybe we can get to know each other now. A fresh start for you"
"Whatever feels right"
"Yeah. None taken..i think"
"My tattoo. Are you wondering what it means?"dean asked whilst smiling slightly
"no"she replied
Castiel sighed and then moved to sit on the sofa. "I'm sorry" Castiel couldn't hold back his tears now
There was a long pause as they both just looked at each other.
"What you think is best"
"I hope so"castiel sighed happily
"Okay"emmanuel smiled widely
"It was nice having you around. Now I won't have anyone to make me coffee and breakfast in the morning"dean chuckled and castiel couldn't help but laugh back
He jogged down the corridor but had no idea where he was going. A door opened and castiel ran right into dean.
"Girlfriend?"
"Yeah"dean smiled and then caught nervously after feeling sam's eye on him "So this your engement party huh?"
"Sam's getting all jealous because I was texting cas"dean replied
She nodded and kissed his cheek.
"To see emmanuel"
"Yeah"emmanuel clearly his throat "I'm sorry for staring. I still can't shake the feeling that I know you"
"No its okay. It's just you have your rule. We have to wait until we are married"
"I have something to show you"
"Yes. I wanted to make you a pie, I don't really know how to bake, so I baught one after many failed attempts"
"Emmanuel's coming"sam said
Dean laughed "thanks for understanding"
"What happened?"
"hey"the man smiled
"Oh really. Did you go to the bar?"bobby asked
Both of them sighed.
Castiel stood up and looked back at dean. Deans eyes were sad, he was looking back but it seemed he was forcing himself to look at castiel and smile.
"What happened last night?"castiel asked
Dean nodded and forced a smile.
"Shut up dean"cas chuckled
Dean took a deep breath "okay...I am sorry about what happened. I shouldn't have done it. I know that. It's just...."
"no no" dean chuckled "that's okay"
"See you tomorrow"
"You can't do this. Daphne is here"emmanuel whispered
"Not good Bobby. 'emmanuel' is engaged to a woman named daphne. The same girl from the supermarket"
In the morning castiel woke up warm and content. He pushed the blanket off of himself and slowly sat up. His stomach muscles still ached because of the tremendous pressure they had been out under after hours of shivering from the cold rain.
Dean nodded and sighed. He then got uncomfortable and left the room.
"Why?"
The next morning Sam and Bobby tiptoed around the house, careful not to wake dean. Dean woke up at around noon. Once he woke up he got a beer and sat in the kitchen. He had one leg tucked to his chest and his chin on his knee as he looked out the window, he watched the rain as it hit the glass heavily. Sam walked into the kitchen and got a beer out of the fridge, he cautiously walked towards dean and gently put a hand on his shoulder.
Dean moved his face back a little more. Their stomachs and hips were pressed flush against each other.
"You can lie down if you'd like"the man said softly
Dean turned sound and looked up at emmanuel.
Emmanuel laughed and wiped his hand with some tissue.
Cas took dean over to the blanket and they both sat down. Cas pulled out burgers from the basket and they both started eating.
"I could hear you" as replied
"I will not ask you again"
Dean moved back and castiel smiled sadly. "Of course"
"Can I ask you guys something?"cas asked leaning forward
Cas?.
"You're not angry with me?"
"No" dean chuckled
They talked about anything they could think of. Both kept apologising to each other.
"Is that a good thing?"Dean asked with raised eyebrows
"What got you in this state boy?"bobby asked
Balthazar obviously didn't believe him but he just nodded. "I'll get your coat"
"Just remember sammy. His name is emmanuel. Not cas"dean warned
Both of them just looked at each other smiling.
"Oh. I'm sorry dean"emmanuel said sympathetically and put his hand on Deans shoulder, right where the handprint cas left on him used to be. Dean smiled and looked at the hand. Emmanuel took it off and dean swore he could see him blush slightly.
"Everything okay?"dean asked
Both of them laughed "yeah. We were"
Dean cleared his throat "no"he sighed "We broke up"
"Cut the bullcrap. I'm your brother dean, I know you better than anyone, anyone except cas, who incase you forgot has amnesia"
"How about you come to my apartment?. I'll wash your clothes. You can stay there and get warm and head out in th morning"
"Daphne"emmanuel stopped her
"It's dean Winchester"
"Me and Bobby were talking. We are going to look for a way to get cas back"sam said
"Yeah"all three of them said together. Emmanuel laughed and everyone joined in.
Maybe after cas died Jimmy took over his vessel again.
Emmanuel: don't be. It's okay
"Oh yeah. It's for my brother. He's a real fitness and fruit kinda guy"
"About a year ago, he was in an accident. He broke some of his ribs and his back leg too"dean sighed "about a week ago he bumped into my table and was breathing strange. I took him to the vets and they said that he'd damaged his ribs again, but not broke then, thankfully. He's been staying there a few days whilst he healed and now he's all good"
"Yeah, cas?"
A couple of minutes later castiel calmed down, thankful that balthazar want angry about the situation.
Cas walked up to the house and couldn't find dean downstairs. He called out his name but there was no answer. Then he went to the back yard and found dean sat on the stairs, he sat next to him.
Once they arrived they walked into the house. Bobby and sam were both in the kitchen leaning on the counter and talking.
"Thank you"dean smiled
"Oh yeah"
"did he feel the same?"dean asked
"I saw you making out in the kitchen. How could you both do something like this?"the other woman asked and then walked out of the room
"Because it was peaceful. I was never like the other angels. All they wanted was to do orders, whereas I wanted to see things. I wanted to live" cas sighed
"no can do handsome"she giggled
"Thank you"castiel smiled after taking a sip.
"Emmanuel"sam corrected him
"Hey"
"It's been almost a month now dean since...well since you know? Cas is dead dean, he's not coming back...I'm sorry"sam said and put his hand on deans shoulder
Dean nodded and sam smiled at him. They pulled up outside of emmanuel's house and began walking to the door when dean stopped.
"Hey cas"
Dean took the impala and drove to a lake nearby. He took a beer from the cooler in the backseat and sat on the hood of the impala. The sun was only just setting so it was quite dark by now. It was quite cold so Dean pulled out a little grey blanket that he always kept in the trunk. He took a drink of his beer and laid back on the windscreen.
Castiel nodded "I hope it's okay. I baked a pie to say thank you"
Castiel nodded and so th man ushered him to the car with a hand on his shoulder.
"I can't believe you just did that to me"dean laughed
"yeah? Want to tell me about her?"
"I mean why did you stop?" dean asked
"You do have to be so kind to me dean"castiel chuckled
Castiel sat down and dean cut them both a slice of the pie. They then started eating.
I can start to feel you
"Thank you"
"can I help you boys?"she asked
Later that night castiel was back dressed in the pyjamas dean had given him the night before. Castiel had just had a shower and put on the pyjamas that dean had given him the night before. He walked into the living room and dean was stood in front of the couch. He was wearing shorts that ended just under his knees and he had no shirt on. Castiel tried not to stare as he walked into the room.
He handed a burger to sam and faced dean.
"We know you must be upset. We know how you feel dean"sam said
Dean looked between both of them and then at his hands on the table "if it is cas maybe we can get him back. That's why we are going to the barbecue, to see if it is him. If not then I'll leave it alone, okay?"
Dean and sam both looked at the laptop. Cas turned around and looked at danny. He was staring at dean with his eyes full of lust. He licked his lips and then rubbed his hands together. Cas sighed and turned away from him.
**'Cause when I'm a bullet shot out of a gun**
Castiel squeezed his eyes shut and then moved a step back. Balthazar walked back over and hooked his arm around castiel's.
Dean nodded.
"Are you alright dean?"emmanuel asked
Emmanuel did a half smile as his eyes focused on dean. Once he reached them, he stopped infront of them all.
"You have some nice friends. Emmanuel, daphne told me all about how she found you. So you really don't remember anything about your life before the lake"
Emmanuel sang along to the lyrics and did hand gestures. All of this made dean laugh. He hadn't laughed like that in a long time.
"Emmanuel"sam corrected him
"Of course not dean" cas replied
Cas sat back at the table with sam. Sam told cas all about their plan to meet with the witch.
"Castiel...my name is castiel"
"alright"
"Why 'baby' and not...I don't know... something like.... susie?"dean shook his head as he laughed
Emmanuel sighed and held onto Deans arm and then made dean look at him "I'm so confused. With you I'm a different person. When I'm with you all I want it to stay with you forever. Then when I'm with her, I'm just this person I've been told to be and I am being told that I'm to marry her"
"Alrighty Bobby, who look for something but we aren't guaranteed something will show up, we don't even know what's happened to cas"
Sam nodded understandingly.
"Do you have any drinks here?"sam asked
"Is he the puppy in the picture?"
" No that's okay"
"Cause the walls started shaking. The earth was quaking. My mind was aching. And we were making it and you-"dean kept singing
When cas just stared at him he stopped. Then cas smiled.
Dean sighed, he could do early tell Emmanuel who he was and how he does know Dean, but how would he ready, would he not ground Dean? Would he never want to see Dean again, he couldn't risk it. So Dean replied  "I don't think you did. Maybe we saw each other around or something and that's why I feel familiar to you"
"Why do I feel like this is goodbye?"
Both of them smiled at each other.
"No come on man! We are here to have fun, not talk about my problems"
Dean: 4pm?
"Okay. That could be good"
"For what?"
"What flavour did you buy?"
Sam put his hand on Deans shoulder to try and comfort him. Dean squeezed his eyes shut to try and stop crying.
Castiel stood up and walked over, he opened the curtains and looked out. He was on the high floor of the building. Looking out he could see another apartment block across from where he was. To his left there were more building and to the right he could see trees and a field quite far out.
"You're wondering what it means?"dean asked
They took jet to a field. There was no one else there, so it was nice and quiet. They spent almost ten minutes in silence. Dean was throwing a ball for jet, then eventually jet got too tired and they headed back to Deans apartment.
Dean sighed as he replied before thinking about it. He should have said something else.
"Hi. I'm glad you came"
Emmanuel: it's okay dean. I like being with you. You're my only friend too (with exception of sam and bobby, I guess) so shut up and come and pick me up
"Just dean"
"Balthazar"castiel chuckled
"cas"sam said "cas? Did you just punch him? What are you doing"
"What?"he asked with mouthful of food
"Bobby you here?!....sammy?!"
Once balthazar got close he hugged castiel tight. His arms wrapped under his ribs and castiel's over balthazar shoulders.
"Listen cas" dean stood up and walked down the steps and then turned to face cas "I'm sorry. I've screwed up your life, you were happy with daphne. You had friends and a good life and i..."
Not long after they pulled up at Bobby's house. They got out and walked towards the door, side by side.
Dean smiled wide and shook his head. Castiel stepped forwards and wrapped his arms over Deans shoulders. One of deans arms came around castiel's shoulders and his hand hooked on the opposite side. The other arm was held around castiel's lower back.
Dean moaned back into emmanuels mouth.
"So what are we going to do?"
dean gasped and faked being offended "dean Winchester is not afraid"
"I'm dean"
"Oh yes, the garage"emmanuel smiled "Do you think..Maybe you and i could be friends dean?"
Castiel was still shaking. His jaw hurt from it shaking so much. His stomach muscles hurt from tensing. His heart hurt from all the extra pressure it was under.
Both of them shook hands. Emmanuel then turned back to dean who was smiling at him.
Is emmanuel and designers wedding day but things don't go entirely to plan.
"Yes you are" emmanuel kissed Dean before they went back to cleaning.
"Do you believe in angels?"emmanuel asked and dean looked him in the eyes and paused. What do I say now? I can't say I do because he'll ask why. I can't say no because I do believe in them.
It was a warm day unlike the last night. The window was open and there was a gentle breeze.
why is cas looking at me like that.
"Had a good night"dean smiled
Dean looked at the hand, then up at castiel.
Emmanuel leaned on the counter next to the pie. Dean walked over and kissed emmanuel.
"Yeah. Sorry"
Dean, sam and cas took danny home. He left pretty quickly and they said their goodbyes. Then they drove back to the motel. It was late so sam and dean went to bed. Cas sat outside on the impala. Dean joined him shortly after. He handed cas a beer and held onto one of his own.
-----
Dean rusted over with a handful of different coloured ties. He held each colour up to Bobby's neck and then sam's. Sam and Bobby gave each other a confused look.
"Hey boy"dean laughed as he stroked the sides of jets face. Dean looked over at cas and smiled, castiel smiled widely back.
"I think Ive found a link"sam said
"That was when he told me to marry daphne"cas sighed
"He said his name was emmanuel?"bobby asked
"Yeah, I hate that" dean smiled and handed a beer to cas
He heard balthazar sigh.
Dean was taken by surprise when emmanuel joined in. Both of them laughed again as they continued to sing and drive to Bobby's house.
"Thank you. They'll like that"Dean replied then stopped and wondered what the hell he was going to tell Sam and Bobby. Dean just realised he was starting right at Emmanuel who was starting back into his soul. Just like case always did.
"I'm not. I want to remember you. When we kissed, all these memories came flooding back to me. I've been waiting for you dean"
"cas can you do something about him please?"dean asked
Sam walked away and sat with daphne. Dean and emmanuel took a seat on the edge of the porch. Dean had a burger on his plate, it had a sesame seed bun and had ketchup and cheese on it. Emmanuel had a burger with lettuce, tomatoes and cheese, dean thaught it was an odd combination, but that was cas after all...or emmanuel, whatever.
"Yeah"dean replied as if it was obvious
"Do you want to do something tomorrow?"
"That's okay. I probably won't watch it"castiel said as he made his way over to the couch.
Dean sam and cas are all working a case of a witch who has been cursing people. Originally she just wanted to have fun with people however some of the curses she put on them have been backfiring. The first curse she did ended up with a man being mauled by dogs because the witch tried to get him to love all animals. The next thing that happened is a woman ended up abandoning her children in a store and killing herself because the witch cursed her. The most recent thing to happen is that she put a curse on a man to make him fall in love with a woman who hates him. He ended up killing her for not loving him back.
Dean: don't think like that, I've just been busy with work.
"Yeah. What the hell happened man?"
Dean got up and started pacing around "I don't know sam but it was him. He was there. Picking fruit with a... girl"dean rubbed his face with his hands.
He was now sat on his knees against the wall and he looked up to see another man. The man was breathing heavy, his eyes were wide and his mouth was hung open.
Bobby sighed and covered a blanket over dean.
**Every now and then I'm right up on the edge
"He died"dean said whilst twisted the bottle in his hand
"Anything" dean smiled
Dean turned to face cas. He looked down at him and smiled "for what cas?"
"I looked everywhere but couldn't find one. Maybe I could go to the store"
"That depends, is it working?"
"What sam?"Dean asked without looking at him
"Yeah. We should really appreciate what we have here" dean chuckled
Cold. Dark. Scary.
Sam sat on the sofa with Bobby.
Castiel removed his hand. "What about your family cas?"dean then asked a little hesitantly
"Hello dean"castiel smiled quickly then looked down at the ground.
"What happened to you?"balthazar asked as he moved back a step
"You do not have to do that for my benefit dean"castiel said
Dean: is that a smiley face?
Emmanuel: I would love that dean.
"I should make dean something. To say thank you"castiel said to jet
Dean smiled and nodded in agreement.
"Are you going to be alright?"sam asked and dean looked up at him
Both of them just looked at each other and then Dean coughed nervously.
Could this day get any weirder right now. Dean facepalmed, sighed and then walked to pay for all the rabbit food.
Dean nodded "mmhmm"
"You look so familiar. When we talked at the store, I felt like I'd known you forever"emmanuel sighed
Dean: I know what you mean.
"Works at the church"
Emmanuel: technically you already did, but yes.
"How?"
"I am glad you like it"castiel smiled and dean smiled back.
"You should go to him castiel"
The dogs ears shot up as he heard the name "You love dean"castiel said and jet wagged his tail "he is a good man. He saved my life, you know. He still is every second he let's me stay here"he sighed sadly "I kind of don't want to leave"
"Cherry"
Dean smiled and nodded "I'd like that"
"Of course"balthazar smiled in answer
-----
"I'm sorry"dean said sympathetically
Sam say with dean for a minute before Dean left the room and walked to his bedroom.
It was nice for castiel to have company. Just being in Deans apartment was nice. Being with dean was nice. It almost felt right.
Dean began driving and he noticed emmanuel staring at him from the passenger seat. Dean looked at him quickly and then back at the Road.
"You told him about me?"sam asked
Emmanuel: I'll talk to you tomorrow dean
"Then tell me something. Something that you've never told anyone else" dean said
"Take your coat off"
"Couldn't say no to wedding cake"bobby laughed
All of them walked into the kitchen and sat at the table. Dean and emmanuel on one side. Sam sat opposite emmanuel and Bobby opposite dean.
"How about we forget it and go back to being friends. Like we were?"
"Who's this?"she asked sharply
"Holy crap"sam sighed
Two hours later castiel and balthazar stepped out of the lift and into the ballroom. There was a long set of stairs leading to the dance floor. On the left of the dance floor there was a raised stage where a band was already playing soft music for the people already dancing.
"So dean tells me you have a case of missing identity?"bobby asked
"Are you hoping we can get cas back?"sam asked
Emmanuel: yeah. That's what you said last night.
"Your car is called 'baby' am I right?"
"So...if you don't know where he is...how will you find him?"dean asked
"Lawrence, kansas?"
Dean let go and the woman, Lisa apparently left the apartment. He heard dean sigh.
"Oh"dean said and pushed castiel up before standing up himself.
*Everything I know
"Yeah. That was his friends name"
"I don't know"bobby replied
"You're sure?"
Dean paused "yeah. Yeah that's where I went, picked up a girl there"he lied
"I don't know how to do that cas"
He turned to face cas and they both just smiled at each other.
"Are we actually on Venus?"dean asked
Then dean walked away and back to the impala. He drove to Bobby's and walked right through the house. Sam and Bobby sat in the couch and watched dean as he barely noticed them to go upstairs.
Castiel nodded and both of them stood up. They walked to the door and castiel hugged balthazar again before walking quickly down the path with a wide smile on his face. Maybe he could be with dean after all.
Dean was snapped out of his thaughts when the man who was technically cas walked up and tapped Deans shoulder.
"I'm going to miss you dean"castiel whispered
"I have not seen everything, though, I have seen a lot" cas replied and smiled a little
Castiel smiled "dean...I understand. You barely know me and I barely know you. I couldn't be anybody. You have a right to be worried leaving a stranger in your home"
"Yeah I remember dean. Do you?"
"Just listen to me cas"dean interrupted
Castiel hooked the mug onto its stand and folded the towel back up. He was aware dean was watching his every move, but he was too scared to meet Deans eye. He'd had so much fun here with dean, he's actually been happier than he's provable ever been in the two days he's sent with dean there.
*The right side of my bed
-----
"What?"he shouted
"Like the sun shines out of Deans as" Bobby finished for Sam
Cas took a drink of his beer as dean watched him.
"Here let me help you"he smirked and walked back to dean
Dean and emmanuel both walked out of the diner and walked to the river which ran behind it. They sat on a bench along the bank.
"Im sorry. I have to let you go cas, I have to"
"Who was that?"daphne asked
"remove your curse"he demanded
Emmanuel sat on the sofa next to daphne and started drinking his coffee.
"It's no problem cas"dean said softly
Castiel smiled as dean now moved one hand to his lower back and the other made its way to castiel's own hand.
"Dean. You can't do that"emmanuel laughed and dragged him off the bed
Their smiles started to fall as they looked deep into each others eyes. They looked more serious as they closed in on each other.
Dean patted cas' shoulder softly.
"Yeah. It's like he did'nt...like he didn't know who he was. I told him my name and he didn't remember me at all"
"Who are you talking to?"sam asked
"Come on cas. You can do this"he whispered to himself
"It's difficult to explain. It's like whenever I see you, there's this voice pulling me towards you"emmanuel sighed and turned away. "I know it sounds cheesy"he turned back to face dean but stood further away "I think I'm starting to remember how I was. I feel like there is someone out there, someone who misses me, someone is waiting for me dean...thats you isn't it?"
Dean turned around and sighed but didn't answer.
"Right"sam sighed "Well we know that it was cas now. He just doesn't remember who he was"
"What's it like? To have seen everything?" dean asked turning his body more towards cas
"What sam?"dean snapped
"How about you come over to Bobby's?"
-----
"You don't know what your saying"
They got to the door and Dean took a deep breath. Sam sighed and then knocked on the door. Shortly after the door opened and daphne answered.
Dean stood up and cas followed.
"Dean. Talk to us"
*Try and give yourself some rest
"I think he does. Has for a long time"dean said quietly
Emmanuel shook his head and then cried into Deans shoulder. "Don't apologise"
Dean and emmanuel looked at each other smiling. Both of them nodded slowly. "Me too"emmanuel smiled
"Dean"cas interrupted putting a hands on deans chest.
"Tell me something cas?"dean asked
Staring at me*
Emmanuel smiled. "You can go in now"
Deans heart began to race as he realised who cas was describing.
"Afraid of what?"
"So what is daphne doing anyway?"dean asked
Emmanuel and Bobby shook hands.
"I think shes going to be at a bar near to the diner. I emailed the owner and they said that shes there every single day. She stays for an hour orders a martini, drinks it in half an hour then leaves. Every day without fail"
Dean kicked a trash can that was at the roadside. He ran his hand through his hair and felt tears falling from his eyes. He wiped them and started walking back to Bobby's
"Why?"
"I don't know. It would be nice, because we could get dean back too"
"Where are you going?"sam asked
Emmanuel moved back away with a huge smiled on his face.
Dean couldn't help but stare into his eyes. It was like an ocean in his eyes, they were beautiful.
"It looks so real" dean smiled
"I can't thank you enough for saving my life"castiel replied
Dean looked at sam and Bobby and then nodded at emmanuel.
"You're such a tease"
Then he looked into Deans eyes and both of them smiled at each other.
*Let me worry about it*
-----
Dean smiled and then picked one up.
"no. he needed to talk to his wife. He needed to ask her what was the problem, they needed to argue, they needed to yell at each other. Then they needed to either get over their problem or separate. That"cas pointed to danny who was stood close behind dean and running his fingers down his arm "that is not love"
"Yes"castiel replied
"I'm glad. I wouldn't want to do any harm to you or her"
"Not a thing no"
"Right"
Bobby gave him some coffee which he gladly drank.
Dean get sure for castiel to follow him. They entered another room which was small and only had a table inside. Dean pulled out a chair for castiel to sit on. Then dean went through another door to what Castiel saw was the kitchen.
"Really"cas nodded
"Bobby!?"dean yelled as as he got into the house
Sam looked to where dean was looking and saw emmanuel walking over. He had his eyes focused on dean who was looking right back. Sam looked between both of them slowly. Emmanuel reached them both and smiled at both of them.
"Hmm. Very"
"Yes"emmanuel smiled and hugged her
Dean put both his hands on the sides of castiel's face, cupping his jaw. They moved forwards slowly and their noses bumped. It was dean who took the last step to connect their lips.
That made dean smile. He had rarely seen cas smile but here he was stood infront of him smiling.
"Thank you dean. Thank you for saving my life, and then keeping me warm. Giving me clothes and feeding me"castiel gestured to his toast.
"Well"cas shrugged
Dean walked away and went back to sam and Bobby. He sat down and took a deep breath.
"Yep"dean sighed
"So this Bobby is your friend?"emmanuel asked
"Are you alright?"sam asked
Castiel turned around and leaned the small of his back on the counter now. He crossed his arms over his chest. Jet looked up at him and pricked his ears up as he wagged his tail.
He put his hand on Deans chest this time and the world returned the same. They were back at the lake stood in front of the impala. The went to move his hand but dean stopped him.
The man whose green eyes sparkle brighter than the stars.
"I thought I saw someone in the water"cas finally said just before his teeth started chattering.
"Lisa come on he had nowhere"
Castiel rested his hands on the wall and looked over. Something was in the water. A lump with water rushing over it. It looked like an animal. He couldn't see properly because the water was moving so fast and everything was so dark. He lifted his left leg up and them pushed himself so he was knelt on the wall. He leaned forward slightly to try and see more but it didn't help.
"I thaught we were going to forget that"
"That's okay. I'd tell you about my life if I knew any of it"emmanuel said and both of them laughed
Dean glared at sam who just chuckled. They both then got out of the impala and started walking to the house.
"You always come when I call" dean replied looking back away from cas
"Well I do. When I was younger, it was probably almost the 1900s, I decided to visit Venus. I watched the sunset from there. It was beautiful, because the sun looked huge, it's far closer to Venus than earth. The sun was just there, glowing bright orange and yellow colours. I felt like I could just reach out and touch it. Then each time the sun set on Venus, I would go and watch it" cas explained to dean
It was soft and slow but it was perfect. Better than castiel had ever expected. Then dean moved his hands to castiel's hips and moved them around slowly so his tail bone was pressed against the tables edge. The kiss got rougher and more frantic. Then dean moved back a little, but their noses were still touching.
"I don't know what that is. I want to just let him go, let him live this life, but I cant...I can't let him go sammy"
Dean held up some for him and emmanuel ate it.
"My place? Bobby and sam aren't home"
"I got you water. Because I figured it would be nice if you drank water once in a while"cas said
"Then what are you going to do?"
Dean walked through the supermarket with a little basket in his left hand. Sam had asked him to go and get some food because Bobby was running low and he was hungry. He specifically asked for pasta, salad and an array of fruits. Sam was still pretty much bed ridden after going through some stuff with lucifer. He had been running around for a while without the soul but now he has it back. Before cas died he succefully got rid of the hallucinations sam was having from his time with lucifer in the cage. Dean sighed as he started to think about cas. After all he and the angel had gone through and he lost him, cas was his best friend and for the long time dean had started to think maybe...Maybe cas was more than that, it was too late to figure any of that out now, his angel was gone for good this time. Dean was looking at some fruits. It was full of colour. Apples, red and green. Pears. Pineapples. Mangos and so many more different fruits. He picked up a Pineapple. "Damn you sammy and your fruit fetishes"dean mumbled to himself
"No. I'm more of a pie or burger...kinda guy"
"Hey. Emmanuel what are you doing here?"sam asked as he stood up
"No we just met today"emmanuel replied
He's not your angel idiot.
Dean put his pie down and layed in his bed. He lied on his back and stared at the ceiling. All he could think about was cas....or emmanuel now as he should get used to calling him. Dean knew he would do anything to try and get castiel back. He just hoped that man was cas.
Dean: oh really. Did you get a good enough view of the inside?
"Dean help!"castiel yelped
Dean: great. I'll see you tomorrow then.
Dean chuckled and cas smiled at him.
Castiel turned to dean and forced a smile.
"alright well lets see if she starts to talk to anyone before we interrupt her"dean said back quietly
"Stay away from me?"she yelled
The song you shook me all night long by AC-DC was playing.
"Yes. Thank you very much"castiel replied, his throat still hurt from all the shaking he'd done because of the rain.
"So what are we going to do?"
Dean looked at danny "really? This guy"
Balthazar hooked castiel arm and they made there was down the stairs. Halfway down he noticed dean on the dance floor. He was dancing with the woman he'd met before at Deans apartment.
Not long later everything was done. It was getting dark outside now. The barn was being lit by the fairy lights hanging on the walls. Bobby said he found then in his 'Christmas things' box.
Emmanuel: yes :) :) here's two of them
"shut up sam hes a true winchester"dean laughed
Sam walked back to the impala as dean knocked on the door. It opened seconds later with emmanuel smiling but his smile fell when he saw that it was dean.
"Me and sam are going to go to this barbecue, see what's going on with this emmanuel/castiel guy"
"Wanna come in?"
"God I've been talking about myself for hours"dean laughed
"I've got that song stuck in my head"emmanuel laughed
"I don't know. He's barely been here lately"
-----
"Dean"emmanuel said, breaking the kiss for just a second.
The song highway to hell by AC-DC started playing.
"What?"Bobby asked shocked
He looked through the cupboards and found a few ingredients. He decided to bake a pie because that's his favourite thing to make. He just hoped dean liked pie.
"Will you at least come to the wedding?"
"I have no idea"dean replied in shock
Dean shot his head up to look at sam "yeah"
"Shook me all night long"both of them sang
"I guess he'll stay with us. He won't leave your side. Once we kill the witch the curse will be removed"
"Yeah. We used to have a friend who we hre with us a lot, you know helping out with the family business. He actually lived somewhere else but he spent most of his time here"
"this is the strangest witch ever"dean sighed
Bobby nodded with shock plastered over his face.
"We know how you feel about cas, dean!"sam yelled
Then there was a loud bang daphne ran into the room. She was wearing her wedding dress but her mascara was smudged on her eyes. As if she'd been crying.
"Kitchen"bobby pointed
Dean walked into the kitchen. Bobby and sam were sat at the table playing a card game. Dean put the bags of food on the counter and sat next to sam. He put his elbows on the table and his head in his hands.
Emmanuel looked at Deans basket and chuckled.
"my names danny"the man said and moved more infront of dean.
Dean: hey emmanuel. Just checking that everything is okay. Haven't spoken to you in a while
"he sounds great"
"Would it be inappropriate of I hugged you?"Castiel asked
"I gotta walk jet so I'll take you down"dean said as he turned to walk out of the room.
"Yes dear" Emmanuel replied to the woman. He then turned back to Dean. "We are new in town and we decided to have a barbecue to meet the neighbors. Do you live around here?"emmanuel asked Dean
"you know I would argue, but you actually braught me pie. Unlike sam who always forgets. So thanks cas"
"His name was castiel"sam replied for dean
"cas?"dean asked
"Why were you so kind to me last night?"castiel asked
Dean stood up angrily "So what? I'm supposed to just give up on getting cas back"
Dean sighed and actually got to walk away this time. He got into the impala and started driving. He drove for ten minutes before pulling up on the side of the road. He then pulled his phone out and texted emmanuel.
**'Cause when I'm a firecracker comin' undone**
-----
Dean: you don't have to if you don't want. I know you barely know me. I guess you're just the only friend I have. But you can say no ill understand.
"I was thinking-there's one more thing I would like to do"Castiel finally answered balthazar
"You could get into trouble"emmanuel smiled as he held Deans hands and pulled him back to the trolley. "Now push the trolley like a good boy"
He spun him around and sat him on the edge of the table whilst they undressed each other.
"why not?"
"Can I take you anywhere?"the man asked as he now stood in front of castiel.
Sam and Bobby both nodded. Dean left the room. He picked a pie up out of one of the bags he braught in after going to the store. He went to his bedroom and turned the TV on. The news was playing. He opened the pie box and started eating it. He sighed and started thinking about the situation.
"Yeah. I mean. I feel like I really know you. Like ive known you for a long time. Like we were close. I just can't place you anywhere. I wish I knew"
"too late"the witch smiled
"yeah I lied, I just thaught It would be funny"the witch smiled
"What did he want?"
Sam nodded and drank his drink. He and dean continued to talk to everyone at the party. All of them were daphnes friends of family. The say the hadn't met emmanuel until that day. Dean didn't like this one bit. He didn't like how daphne acted. She acted as if she did know them, that was strange because dean had never met her. If she did know then, why was she trying to get to cas.
Both of them laughed softly at that.
"Yes. It's a long boring sorry. Do you want some food?"
Castiel couldn't look away from the bright green eyes staring at him. Then he felt that the man still had a tight grip on each of his biceps.
Whilst cas was talking dean had walked into the room and got a beer from the fridge behind cas' back. Cas didn't look up at him or anything, he felt so guilty now he had his memories back.
"In here dean"bobbys voice came from the kitchen
"I guess we were both cowards"
"Yes. You?"castiel asked as he tried not to look at Deans naked chest
"Why not? Are you afraid?"
"Yes. It's like i had a whole other life that I know nothing about. I wish I knew who I was"emmanuel replied"maybe I'm some top secret spy..or maybe I work for the men in black and they took away my memory so I didn't tell anyone about aliens"
Another spin. Castiel was so caught up in dean, he didn't even notice that everyone had moved away and are now dancing around the edges of the dance floor as dean and him moved in the space in the middle.
Dean chuckled "just getting ready for the big day Bobby. Emmanuel and daphne are getting married tomorrow"
"Yeah"
"Hey"bobby said but paused "You don't think he's been seeing emmanuel do you?"
He turned back to the room and walked to the shelves with the pictures on them.
"Where is he?!"she asked yelled towards emmanuel.
Dean thaught. The man turned more so that dean could almost see his face. The man was smiling at something a woman stood next to him had said. Though dean couldn't hear.
"No. Listen cas I hope you don't take this the wrong way. I'm a little worried about leaving you in my apartment...alone"
Dean: then don't laugh so much ;D
Bobby tried his best to soothe dean. Sam came down shortly after having heard some commission. He hugged dean and they stayed like that for a while. Sam then made dean lie down. Both sam and Bobby sat with him until he fell asleep.
Once inside he closed the door and then pushed emmanuels back against it. He kissed him roughly and passionately. Both of their shirts were gone quickly and then dean spun emmanuel around and lied him on the bed. He lied over him and put one leg between emmanuels two legs. Their lips barely parted as they undressed each other.
Dean: have you slept with her?
He didn't stop he pushed his way out of the door. Dean didn't care that everyone in the bar was staring. He chased after cas but he'd already got in a cab and was driving away.
"Maybe I'll see you around sometime"dean said
"Bobby do you have a black tie?"dean asked as he rushed back to the table
Sam sighed and then looked at Bobby. Bobby and sam gave each other a little look which they hoped dean didn't see, but he did.
Emmanuel came closer and put his head next to deans to talk in his ear. Dean felt his heart race. He could feel the man's stubble on his cheek.
"whatever Sammy"
Dean looked into emmanuel's eyes. His blue eyes that were now filled with tears. Like an ocean. Dean grabbed emmanuel's hands and held them.
He saw dean shrug "must like my pretty face"dean turned around and smirked at castiel. Castiel couldn't help but laugh.
"yes"cas replied. He kept looking forwards towards the front of the diner whilst listening to the witch. "he is telling her that his wife is having an affair, with his best friend"
"I'm sorry"dean sighed
"What's wrong dean?"emmanuel asked
"how?"sam asked
"I thought..."Castiel couldn't finish his sentence because he was suddenly shaking again. The man rubbed his hands up and down castiel's arms in an effort to warm him, it didn't help though.
It felt like he was only in there a few seconds when the other man was getting out of the car. Castiel opened his eyes as the man was at his door and opening it for him. He helped castiel get out and then wrapped an arm around his shoulders as they walked into a large building. It looked kindof like a hotel. They got inside the revolving doors and the man let go of him. He kept hold of castiels forearm as he led him down a corridoor and to an elevator. He didn't take much notice of his surroundings. The doors opened and the man once again led him down another corridoor and stopped at the door.
As the music played dean bopped his head whilst biting his bottom lip. He looked at emmanuel and they both laughed.
"Me neither son"
Dean: I'll be ten minutes :)
They reached the door and walked inside. They got to the living room and sam was sat on the sofa.
"Hello dean"
"Oh yeah"dean laughed
------
"What is it sammy?"dean asked still not looking at sam
"Emmanuel"
Emmanuel: how are you?
"You've done that before"castiel stated, he could tell with the way dean handled the situation.
"I'd like that"
Suddenly a pigeon flew in through the window. It hit castiel on the side of the face and continued to fly. Castiel jumped up and ran out of the room.
"I guess this is it then"
"Yeah? That makes two of us"dean smiled back and kissed him again.
"What if you were this big...bad monster hunter?"
Emmanuel: don't tell daphne that. She loves animals, she'll kill you if she knew :D
**Every now and then I get a little lost
He looked around the room. He was sat on a black sofa backed against a white wall. Two other walls were white and then th one with the door on it wa black. In that corner there was a large flat screen TV on the glass stand. A few shelved to the left of that with picture on it. There was a wooden table in the centre of the room, it had an old pie box on it. The window was on the wall opposite the black wall. It was large and covered in black curtains.
"I'm sure he misses you. He's probably in heaven watching you, do you believe in that type of stuff?"
"Oh...ye...yeah"Dean stuttered and rubbed the back of his neck" me and my brother are staying with a friend at the local garage down the street"
"Yeah"dean replied whilst not looking at sam
"Dean"balthazar said and castiel internal winced at hearing deans name "I can see that you like him castiel. It's written all over your face"
"Do you want to see it?"cas asked
"What is this?"the woman asked
Lisa started walking away and dean grabbed her arm lightly. "Get off me dean!"she yelled
"really? That's where you draw you're line. He was practically feeling you up earlier"sam snickered
Emmanuel: sounds wonderful
"im dean Winchester. This is sam and cas. We're here to help you. The woman you went to see before she was trying to kill you, we just saved your life"
"Emmanuel?"dean asked
Dean moved back as emmanuel gently pushed him until he was pressed against the truck. Dean opened the door and pulled emmanuel inside. Emmanuel lied down on the seat and dean hovered over him.
Dean looked at castiel with his brows furrowed. He was clearly confused.
Castiel walked away with balthazar. They walked up the stairs as castiel guessed dean was now dancing with lisa.
"You should play it at your wedding"dean joked
"Like what?"
"Dean. I'm sorry"emmanuel sighed
"cas can you hear them?"sam asked
She saw dean and looked angry as she ran over to him. Once she reached him she started hitting him"I knew there was something happening". Emmanuel pulled daphne away from dean
Almost an hour later castiel was sat in the living room of balthazar's house. He was sat on the windowsill with one leg bent up to his chest, his other holding him steady on the ground. He was biting his thumb nail whilst thinking about dean.
Dean sighed and then looked at Bobby for a second. Bobby smiled sympathetically.
Minutes later jet and dean were ready. Castiel didn't have much, just the clothes he was wearing.
"Wise man"
"Just hear me out...please?"
Dean sighed "Yeah cas. Yeah, she did"
"No"emmanuel sighed "I don't know what to do anymore dean"
Nobody spoke after that. The man stayed in the door. Castiel could tell he was wary, probably worried about scaring him again. Castiel walked around the small coffee table and came to a stop a few feet from the other man. Green eyes looked up at castiel and then then the man faced him.
"No. My brother sam"
Dean: well thank you for those ;) how about a winky face
Cas smiled at dean defending him, he didn't want to do something wrong. He was struggling to hide his annoyance at this man being all over dean. Touching him and standing close to him. lucky cas wasn't in love with dean though right?. Because he totally isn't jealous.
dean chuckled and walked away to tidy his table "They get in here all the time"
"I took him to a bar and stuff happened and he ran out"Dean sighed through years
Dean looked at sam for a second and then Bobby. Both of them were looking at him half with pity, half with disapproval.
The next couple of days dean and sam were working a case. Just a quick salt and burn, nothing difficult, no near deaths. Though dean did end up with a scratch on his wrist leading to his thumb, nothing serious though. He got it after a ghost threw him into a wall where dean caught his hand on a nail in the wall. Luckily sam burned the bones in time before any serious damage was done to dean. The day they returned to Bobby's house they spent resting, eating and sleeping. After four days of not seeing or speaking to emmanuel dean decided to text him.
Emmanuel: I am laughing out loud and almost woke daphne
Emmanuel handed dean a fork and dean tasted the pie. He made a pleased face and emmanuel laughed.
Castiel glanced and dean and smiled "I'm not. I had great parents growing up. Sure they weren't my real parents, but they me who I am, I didn't need my mother or my father"
Dean laughed and shook his head "really?"
"I am not sure"he shakily answered
"shut up"
Dean looked between sam and Bobby.
Emmanuel: of course
Emmanuel looked at dean for a second before turning back to daphne. He didn't respond and daphne cried even more.
Baby you save me**
He had no track of time, so he could have been walking for hours or only minutes, but he didn't know. He now found himself stood in the middle of the bridge, over a river. He looked down to see the dark, murky water rushing under the bridge to the other side. He looked back and could barely see anything. Just the other side of the bridge, then trees behind that. A few large building and skyscrapers way down in the background. The world was so quiet. No cars, no people, no animals. It was like the world had been abandoned an he was th on my one left. Th only real sounds were the sounds of rain hitting the ground near his feet and the water from the river rushing down under the bridge.
"Cool. I think he'll like you"
"You okay?"sam asked
Dean sighed at his thaughts and then went downstairs to drink and eat with Bobby and sam for a while.
"You're so hot"dean kissed emmanuel roughly and then picked him up
"Does dean Winchester always speak in third person?"
"Where are you going?"sam asked
Bobby walked to dean and put a hand on his shoulder.
Balthazar wanted to take castiel to new York but castiel suggested seeing the city a little as he's never seen it before. Of course that was just an excuse, in reality, he didn't want to leave kansas. He wanted to just go back to Deans apartment and sit on the sofa with coffee whilst jet sat on the floor infront of him wagging his tail and lifting his ears up. Then dean walking into the room wearing his loose grey sweatpants and his AC/DC shirt, dean would come and sit next to him and put his feet up over castiel's thighs. Castiel sighed out loud, that would never happen. He couldn't have dean, as much as he wanted him. It was stupid, he'd only known dean for two days and he couldn't get the man out of his head.
"Mind if I cut in"castiel heard lisa ask
"What if he doesn't want to come back. What if he likes this life?"
Shook me all night by AC-DC.
"Wait"bobby said waving his hand at cas "the more time you spend together?"
"Thank you"castiel smiled and started eating.
The green eyed man came back and silently handed castiel some pyjamas.
"Hello dean"
"Is all well with your girlfriend?"castiel asked
The man who was with the witch stoop up. He pushed deans shoulder and looked angry but then his face changed. He looked down at his hand and then up into deans eyes.
"Nothing. Why can't I be his friend?"
"I know. I just wanted to you to know. I didn't run out because you kissed me, I ran out because I was afraid"
"So. When you told us you met a girl from the bar?"sam paused "was that cas?"he asked Dean
Emmanuel: I'll be at the diner
Dean scoffed "of course I'm not jealous. This guy night not even be cas. Even if it was cas why would I be"
Emmanuel: not right now why?
"I can do that"
"you know. All of these curses have reporcutions, none of them worked well. What if something really bad happens here"
Dean nodded and forced a smile.
-----
He couldn't stop shaking. He was shaking so much the muscles in his arms and thighs hurt. His heart felt like it was working extra hard just to keep his body warm. The clothes he was wearing were offering no warmth but instead making it harder to breathe.
Dean couldn't held clench his jaw at that, he didn't know who Daphne was our if she knew who cas was and maybe she was playing him, or maybe she did just fine him and everything Emmanuel had told Dean did happen.
Cas was staring at the witch.
"Yes please"castiel replied
Dean nodded his head. Cas put his hand on the side of Deans face and cupped his cheek. Dean looked back around and suddenly everything was different. He was still sat on the impala but he wasn't by the lake. He was on this huge open space looking at the setting sun.
Dean and sam followed emmanuel to the buffet table. They all picked up paper plates.
"The diner down the road"
Then why is cas stood there right now?
Deans face got so close. So close they could kiss. Was dean going to kiss him.
Castiel looked at dean and smiled at the nickname dean had given him.
Dean walked to the impala and got in. Emmanuel watched until they were pu of sight and then went back into his house.
Dean looked at cas for a few seconds. He thought about just telling cas who he really is, what he did. About heaven, about his life with dean and sam, everything. But he just shook his head.
"Alright the wedding is tomorrow. Now, me and sam can wear out FBI suits. Bobby I found yours. You are coming right?"
"Can you help me...I have an idea?"
"She is isn't she?"
Cas sat up on the hood of the impala with Dean.
Balthazar moved over and hugged him. "Don't be. It's okay castiel"balthazar shushed him softly
After ten more minutes a woman walked over and sat with the witch. They looked like they were talking.
"Why didn't you tell us?"
"Hello dean"dean heart skipped as emmanuel said those words
Emmanuel: goodnight dean. See you tomorrow.
He closed his eyes as the car came to life and the engine purred. He could feel himself getting slightly warmer but his legs, feet, hands and face were still numb from the cold.
Both Bobby and sam smiled. Dean handed out burgers to everyone as he hummed the tune to the song he and emmanuel were singing to.
Dean got into the drivers seat of the impala. Sam in the front passenger seat. Cas was behind sam whilst danny was behind dean. Danny was tracing his fingers along deans neck and cas watched closely. He did not like this man touching dean, because he didn't love dean and dean sure didn't love him back. Its not like cas was jealous or anything, its also not like cas totally loves dean and like dean totally loves him back or anything like that.
"oh come on!"dean groaned
"Running out after you kissed me"
Dean sighed and sam patted his shoulder.
"You are both sat on the front row, left hand side"emmanuel said as sam and Bobby walked into the church.
'this guy seems familiar'
"Cas"dean sighed trying to hold back tears "I've lost him bobby"
"I never knew my mother. I was braught up with foster parents, with my brother Gabriel. I found my father when I was 25 but he didn't want to know me"castiel answered sadly. He didn't know why he was even telling so much about himself in the first place. Well dean had been telling him all lot too, so why not.
Both men took a drink of their beers and then cas leaned his elbows on his knees. Dean sat sideways and just listened to cas.
"You're very happy"sam said
"I got lost in the city. Dean helped me and he's been looking after me ever since"castiel explained
Dean set down a bag of groceries on the table and sat next to cas with a groan.
"Come on, let's go home" cas said
"whats going on?"danny asked
He licked Deans cheek getting all the cherry from there. Then he kept licking it off of him until it was gone.
"Balthazar"castiel smiled
After a few hours dean decided to take emmanuel for a tour of the yard as he hadn't seen it before. As they walked out of the house and over to the garage dean noticed emmanuel was humming the tune that they were both singing to in the car.
"Since we listened to that song in the car. I can't stop listening to all of their songs"emmanuel chuckled
"I was driving over the bridge and I saw you kneeling on the wall. I got out to ask if you were okay, I thought you were trying to kill yourself. I got to you just as you leaned over to far. I pulled you back and you just kind of stared at me for a while, I think you were in shock and just blacked out a little"dean cleared his throat "You nearly gave me a heart attack man"
Dean: hey. Can I ask you something?
"I should have chosen you sooner. I left it too long. I tried to ignore it, but I should have chose you a long time ago"
After half an hour the witch turned up. Dean, sam and cas tried to hide themselves so that she didn't recognise them. once she sat down. All of them got up and dragged her back out of the bar. They took her behind it and cas pushed her against the wall and held her shoulders against it.
"Where did you buy this?"
They got out of the impala and headed towards the crowd. Sam and Bobby shared a look, dean was walking infront of them and looking around, as if looking for someone. Then sam saw emmanuel talking to two men. Dean stopped and turned to look away from emmanuel. He turned to face sam and squeezed his eyes shut.
"She is at work"emmanuel replied
"Is it true?"she asked and glanced at dean "where you sleeping with him behind my back?!"she asked as she pointed at dean.
"what happened?"dean asked
Emmanuel led dean, sam and Bobby into the church behind everyone.
"So its just you three here?"emmanuel asked
"Only when daphne doesn't find out"Emmanuel laughed and Dean smiled at him
Dean looked away for a second then looked back into the oven blue eyes of emmanuel"And what do you want to do?
"I don't know if I want to marry her"
He and dean then walked into one of the other rooms which was full of tables and chairs, dean guessed it was where the party was being held. Emmanuel closed the door behind them and then walked up to dean.
"well not anymore"
"Alright. Let's go"dean smiled
The man who saved his life.
"That's good"
"So lisa this is cas. Cas this is lisa"dean introduced them and castiel shook her hand.
"of course"
"no you were just unconscious"dean replied
It was the day of the wedding. Dean had gotten up early and sat on the sofa for hours just watching the tv. His mood had changed since the last night. He was now moody and sad. He eventually got dressed into his suit and thought about not going to the wedding at all. But then he remembered it was the last time he would see cas and he had to go, he owed him that.
"But what?"castiel asked himself
"How did you ever stop coming here?" dean asked smiling
"that's stupid"
Cas is alive.
"okay so we go there. Wait for her. Kill her. Get rid of romeo over there and go home"dean said
Once they got the dog they took him for a walk in the park.
"Yeah"dean glanced at castiel and smiled "I trust you"
Emmanuel: thinking
------
Castiel smiled widely. He hooked a hand around Deans neck and pulled him down into a new kiss.
Emmanuel walked out of the house and both he and dean stood on the porch.
Well you love him don't you...
"Bobby!"sam yelled
They both in a booth at the far corner of the bar. It was the quietest place and out of sight of most people. The seats were next to each other with a table infront of them. Dean ordered both of them beers and they sat drinking.
"So a pigeon huh?"dean asked
"I'll get you some warm clothes and you can change if you want"the man said a he knelt in front of castiel
An hour later they got to the bar and sat at a booth. Dean and danny sat on one side whilst cas and sam sat on the other. Cas didn't like this, he was usually the one to sit next to dean. Not that he didn't like sam, he of course did, he was like a brother to him. he just enjoyed sitting with dean because that's what hes used to. There is no jealously, hes totally not jealous of danny sitting next to dean.
