Hearing his name falling out of the man’s mouth right at the precipice of pleasure was the perfect thing to end him. Oh what a way to go. His member erupted, shooting up and landing on his thighs. His upper body folded over as all his muscles clenched together in ecstasy.
“Then Dick hit Balt, and something in me just snapped. I really don’t remember that first hit. Balt said I knocked Dick over and I attacked his friends, knocked them out cold. Dick tried to choke me from behind, but Balt grabbed him and he turned on him, punched him in the face. Then next thing I know I’m standing over him, and that’s when you came in.” his voice trailed off towards the end and that’s when Dean’s guilt came to a peak.
“Just tell me where to go.” He spoke while fumbling with the cassette player. “I’m not as old as you may think. I just like the simplicity of tapes.” He commented on Castiel’s staring.
“Or how about you call for that pizza you promised me.” Cas stopped him with arms around his waist and a chin over his shoulder.
“That’s a question I want you to answer. Cause I don’t intend on changing careers for quite some time, and if you can’t ride with that then maybe we should just be fri—”
Dean moved like that for a long while. Both of their orgasms were about to make their grand entrance. Cas went first, spurting while hollering a mix of Dean’s name and other shameless noises. Dean could feel Cas’ entrance fluttering around him as he came, then it squeezed impossibly tight sending Dean well over the edge. He emptied himself inside Castiel then pulled out carefully planted his body right next to the other man. All his muscles were loose and limp. He couldn’t move, refused to move for at least a few moments. Where moans and screams hung in the air they were now replaced with the haggard breaths of two men in total bliss.
Saying good bye’s to his friend he’d gone inside his apartment and texted Dean, asking him to come over. His request was denied though, he discovered after he got out the shower. Dean was apparently busy with family stuff, so it looked like he was on his own tonight.
He turned the slow cooker on super low just to make sure the food stayed warm since it would be awhile before they ate. Wondering what Dean was making for them he took it upon himself to peek in one of the bags, to find a heap of green apples.
“You know you’re the first person to show during my office hours. It gets pretty boring sitting here waiting for someone to show.”
Dean started at the top of his chest, soft looking hands trailing down his torso, completely bypassing his flaccid cock and rubbing at his spread thighs. He did that twice before he stopped to tweak at his nipples. Goodness Castiel wanted to be those hands to bad. As Dean continued pulling and twisting at the reddened nubs his cock began to lift with interest. Once it was at full attention, one hand left his check to begin tugging at it. This was when the noises begun and Castiel lost all hope at not getting aroused. It felt like Dean was simultaneously watching him and the camera. It was at least 100 degrees in the room now.
He was quick in following the man’s instruction, cutting a larger piece than he would ever get for himself. Once he was seated the other man got right back in his spot. His apron was tented even from the way he was sitting.
“Has he never spoken before?” Cas questioned touching Dean’s shoulder obviously seeing through Dean’s façade.
There was a half foot of space between them and he found himself wanting to eliminate it entirely. With it being dark in the room you could barely make out the face of the other person. With his desire fueling him he slid forward until he was as close as possible. All the nerves and anxious energy floated through him like steam as Dean wrapped him in his arms. The man kissed him on the forehead before nuzzling his face in the side of his neck. Warm, even breaths let him know that Dean was comfortable and well on his way to being asleep. It filled Castiel with such tenderness, how gentle Dean was in this moment.  He could feel the man’s heart beating right against his chest and he was happy. Sleep fell over him, and he was content.
Dean plated up heavy portions for the each of them and they went and sat on the couch. Dean put on a movie that Cas had never seen before. Some cowboy flick. Castiel half listened to Dean explaining the premise of the movie. He was too busy staring at his lips and cute little wrinkles that formed around his eyes whenever he smiled. After awhile they watched and ate in silence. Nothing but the sound of the movie and the small noises the baby made. At some point Dean had made a bottle for the little one and he fed him and put him to sleep. There was something beautiful in the way Dean interacted with his nephew. He was very fatherly….or what a father should be. He was gentle yet firm.
“Understandable.” He walked to the fridge and pulled out a beer. “Well you’re welcome to borrow that one for the time being. You know, take it home with you if you don’t spend the night tonight.”
“If you’re so damn tired then why didn’t you come see me for the rest of break huh? You did the last time something happened with my dad. What changed this time?” Dean was starting to get loud and defensive, and that only fueled Castiel’s annoyance. Dean knew he was picking a fight to avoid the real thing. This was his m.o. He was just as bad at letting someone in as he was with coping. Dean was hoping a fight would start, they’d argue for a little, he would take his out, and they’d never have to confront the issue head on.
He was feeling a little light headed, and it wasn’t because of the pain anymore. How anyone could handle being the sole recipient of Castiel’s attention, Dean had no clue. “It’s a lot better, man. Thank you.”
Dean shook his head. “Sorry, sweetie. I really want to show Jack how Baby works. Maybe some other time.”
Cas smiled and nodded. “Please. I need those—” he glanced to Sam quickly and then back at Dean. “—updates. Yes, please text me updates on your wound. I’d love to hear how things are going.”
His brother just shook his head in frustration. “It's your wedding, Cassie. If you want your hair to look like you just flew through a storm, then I’m not going to force you. I suppose it
“You’re so lucky.” Dean poked Cas in the chest once more before turning to the fast-approaching woman. “This is Charlie, she—oof!”
“So, they should have sent him home after they gave him his cast. If they were so worried about the press finding him, he woulda been better off at his castle.”
“That makes sense, then. When Dean found out about the arrangement last month, he tried to look in the records hall, but no one could find anything about you other than a birth announcement.”
She crashed into him, throwing her arms around his neck and pulling him into a tight hug. “I haven’t seen you for weeks, and you didn’t even think to tell me you were going to drop by? I’ve never been so insulted in my life! If you think for one minute—”
but the warmth was exquisite. Lust drunk, it took Cas a moment to realize that Dean was toying with him. Taking his time until he was ready to join in so they could cross that glorious finish line together.
“So, let’s make sure I understand this… You’re not concerned that we have a possible murderer in our library, only that he’s an incompetent one?”
Cas stared at him, head tilted and assessing as he slipped the plastic through the register slot. “Definitely not a Charlie.”
Dean smiled out the window the entire way home. When they finally got to Sam’s apartment, he rushed ahead to fill the bath, and Dean wobbled behind, texting Cas the entire way.
“I thought you were a murderer!” Dean burst into laughter, forcing Cas to defend himself. “The first time you were here you left the browser up and you had looked up how to get away with murder! What was I supposed to think?”
since he last had a trainee bow to him. But Cas? Not only was he now married to the Crown Prince, but he was also the
He bit his lip in order to hold back his displeasure at being compared to Dean. “Well, I’m almost done. Are they meeting us there?”
With a flourish, he pulled it from his vest pocket and handed it to his father. Zachariah didn’t wait a second before he broke the wax seal and unfolded the paper. His face lit up in the most sincere smile he’s ever seen from his father in his entire life. “It’s in the King's own hand.”
Cas bit the shell of his ear and that was it. Dean screamed and shot his load all over the front of Cas’s desk. Cas stroked him through it, his own thrusts stuttering and finally stilling on his deepest thrust yet. He groaned through his orgasm, hips stuttering and cock pulsing as he spilled inside of Dean.
“Naomi…” He could picture his father holding a hand out in surrender, or maybe even touching her shoulder in an attempt to comfort her. “I didn’t know—"
Tears were now overflowing and streaking down his face. “I would have. I swear to you. It’s just a big step, and some men can be—”
it was that the bond spanned over any distance. He hated hearing about how romantic it was to have sightings, how your heart craved your soulmate
The second problem revealed itself the moment they pulled onto the freeway. Jack, who had slept most of the morning, only waking up to be fed, jerked into alertness and immediately began wailing. He didn’t seem to want the pacifier, the soft teddy bear they bought him from the gift shop, or even the tinkling lullabies playing from Cas’s phone. He shushed Jack the entire ride home, hoping that Jack would calm down before Claire could see him, but he cried the entire ride back and through the entire phone call to Sam letting him know it was ok to bring Claire over.
“This is something you should have come to me for at the beginning of the semester. But you didn’t, and that proves to me that you don’t take my class seriously. Why should I help you now?”
Cas hadn’t even realized through this whole exchange that Dean hadn’t put his hands on him. He was so careful with him. It was endearing but at the same time Cas was ashamed he had put Dean in a position where he had to be so weary of what he did. He wanted Dean to be free of worry.
Dean went about calling Gabe and letting him know that they got a location. He’d never heard a man so relieved and scared at the same time as he heard Gabe’s half sobs come through the phone.
He walked in the lingering heat that the day had left behind. Like how being wrapped in a warm blanket after a hot shower are two different sensations. He'd rather the comforts of the evening. The sky above was slathered in oranges and blue hues. The sun was just beginning to set, still giving off its last hurrah. This was his favorite time of day. When the afternoon rush morphs into the evening cool-down. In this town where he'd received so much kindness, he walked without a care. No need to look over his shoulder or worry that every whip of the wind could be a warning to flee. He felt safe here. He had friends here. He had comfort here.
Dean once again was left for no other choices. They were right. They always were there, even when Dean didn’t want them to be. “You know he’s been drinking again?”
He directed them back to his building. It was such a short ride, but it felt like an eternity with the warmth of Dean’s hand sitting on his leg. They got out and went to his floor. Once he unlocked his apartment Dean was right behind him, chest to back.
Goodness that heavy voice could crumble a mountain. It teetered between a growl and a purr, Dean wanted to hear it all day long. He wondered what he sounded like moaning. It would probably be the sexiest thing he’d ever heard.
“I suspected as much. As soon as I read this I called his father’s office, but it went to voicemail every time. I even called his secretary’s personal phone and she didn’t answer.” He paused as a single tear left his eye. “I don’t know what to do Dean.” His voice broke into a sob.
He mentally relived the thoughts of that morning. He had been quite cold to Castiel especially when he went to leave. He couldn’t help it. It was in him to run away from anything emotional, to lock up his mind’s doors when it came to discussing himself. Surface things being exposed didn’t bother him in the slightest, but when you got skin deep he just couldn’t do it. It was even difficult to expose himself to his own brother. Every time he lost something he just buckled down and rolled with the punches. Did it pain him to be like that? Of course, a sensation that constantly racked his core and he’d only let himself crack when he was in the confines of his apartment. To be that vulnerable in front of anyone stirred up sheer panic, just the thought of it happening sped up his breathing and caused that all too familiar tightness in his chest to well up inside him. He had felt just that when Cas decided to ask again what happened between Dean and his father. He quit and he fled. His usual tactics still strong after all these years.
Once class ended all the students quickly filed out of the room and as usual Castiel stayed behind. He locked the door to the classroom then walked up to the desk slowly, not trying to startle Dean who was grading a stack of assignments. He looked so drained, as he rubbed at the stubble on his cheeks. His tired eyes gliding across the page and his hand nervously tapping the pen on the wood.
Once they were inside the level of noise was significantly rising once everyone had realized that Dean had arrived. Hugs were passed between everyone. It was sweet to watch and make Castiel’s heart swell at the sight. His family was never this affectionate towards each other. Any kind of embrace he received from his parents or siblings felt more like a necessary formality than an actual desire for contact, except for Gabriel. He was often times too affectionate for Castiel’s liking. He could tell Dean’s family was the kind of people that loved with their whole hearts, and they loved hard. Out of all the individuals there Castiel only recognized Sam who spotted him still standing by the door and was now approaching him.
Cas stood in the November air with his scarf wrapped around his neck, chest, and half his face. Dean had went home without him, Cas telling him he was meeting up with Charlie for a study session, which was only half a lie. He didn’t like lying to Dean, but he couldn’t exactly share the truth with him since the topic being discussed involved Dean.
John was just about to pounce on Dean, the look of a man with nothing to lose in his eyes. Pure rage and fire radiated from the man and for the first time in Dean’s life, that too familiar look didn’t scare him anymore. Bobby was quick to catch John, using all the strength in him to hold him back, but Dean didn’t budge, he didn’t need to. John couldn’t hurt Dean at this point anymore. He was old and drunk, where Dean was young and sober. All he had left were his hate filled words, and empty threats. And if that’s all he had then Dean would no longer show it affecting him.
“I’m not opposed to that.” He let his tongue drag along Cas’ earlobe and loved the way he shivered in his arms.
Cas looked past the situation that was brewing to Dick’s….date who still remained leaning on the building. He smirked at Castiel and winked at him. A creepy dark feeling welled up inside him and soon it was choking him. He was hot all over and felt cold at the same time. He drew in deep exhales trying to hold onto the little bit of calm that he had left.
His father’s face was weathered and his hair was beginning to gray. All the stress was in fact getting to him. His bright eyes dulled by the lifestyle he lived, always on the go helping those around him. Castiel was grateful that they had sent him home. He clearly needed the rest. Castiel nodded and continued his route to the kitchen in search of food.
“You are truly magnificent Dean.” He observed how the dancing flames reflected off of the man’s skin so well. “I had a conversation with Charlie and your brother, some things were said and it sent me on a very interesting journey. I hope you’re receptive to what I have planned for you tonight.”
Armed with a strong cup of black coffee Dean set out to get all of his work done. He was babysitting tonight and he wanted everything done before little Mark was due to be over. He was determined to grade the daunting stack of essays that littered his desk. He really wanted to complete this task, but then blue eyes flooded his vision every time he really got into it. He sighed and stretched his arms above his head and moved his hips in the office chair trying to get more comfortable.
“Look who’s awake?” he heard a voice he didn’t recognize, but he could gauge it was pretty far away from the sound of it.
“If you haven’t noticed I’m well aware of that. Would you happen to have Dean Winchester’s email address?”
“We also…agreed not to do anything at school.” He placed his hands on Dean’s chest trying to push himself off.
Once dessert was served most of everyone retired to the living room to enjoy the music that now filled the house, and conversations started among them. The only ones to remain at the table were Castiel and Dean. He watched his boyfriend’s mood sink so low he barely even touched his pie. Sam had went to the living room with everyone else since his new girlfriend showed up and he wanted to introduce her to everyone. They talked with her briefly and Castiel hoped they didn’t seem rude by not joining the festivities, his mind was trained on Dean right now. He wanted to speak, say anything that would take him out of this withdrawn state that he was in now.
“You can’t be too mad at him,” He said as Dean walked back towards the truck, “ His education is important and his mother wouldn’t let him keep a job if it interfered with his studies. Plus this is a great opportunity for me to stare at you while you’re hard at work.”
Castiel nods in response and takes a long sip from his beer hoping it’ll help with his nerves. Dean somehow managed to talk his self across the room, he now stood in front of a large, messy desk talking and laughing with his brother. He wanted the comfort of being by Dean’s side, but he did bring him to get to know the people he calls family so he might as well put his best foot forward.
This was new news to Dean and by the look on Sam’s face it was to him as well. Sure they knew his Dad had plenty of benders back in the day, months on end where he’d get some liquor in him and go missing. He had no idea that some of that was Bobby’s doing. Seeing as how Bobby had saved them from a life threatening situation, he couldn’t be mad at him for that. It was a good choice on his part, no matter how much it had hurt them at the time.
The waiter returned with more water and Dean’s beer. They barely gave her a glance but still thanked her as she took their meal orders and fled the table.
The ' bar’ was far brighter inside than it needed to be, but as they got further inside, led by a quiet hostess, the lights seemed to dim. The even was taking place in a large party room, some of the guests were mingling outside and stopped to talk to Dean before they could enter. Smile wide as he introduced Castiel to them. Almost proud in the way he dragged out the word boyfriend.
Gosh why was he so scared to talk to the man. He was just a person after all. A very sexy, slightly famous person, but that should be irrelevant to someone like Castiel. Dean isn’t the first celebrity to meet, just the type of celebrity he was.
“I’m glad you were my first at something.” He tucked his face into the curve of Dean’s neck, where he liked to be the most. “Although I’m upset that I came first.”
“I had to have something to drive back from the airport.” He chuckled shucking his bags on the floor by the couch. “Would’ve ruined the surprise. Though I see I probably should’ve called.”
“I’ve never been very good at following rules Cas.” He gripped Castiel’s ass and brought him even closer than before. “Now you gonna tell me what you want or should I just keep being a tease?”
Castiel took the time to think about what she said. She was right of course. That there was the possibility of Dean just wanting something casual and no strings attached with him. He couldn’t see a man like Dean being tied down to one person. But with Cas’ very failed relationship not too far in the past he probably should want something easy as well, but he could see himself with Dean, in a serious way. Just the two of them against the world, come what may, type of relationship. It was a long way until Saturday and Castiel was going to dread the week ahead.
“You’re right,” Sam chuckled and rose from his seat on the couch. “Well I better get going. I’ve gotta shower and such so I’ll see you tomorrow morning yeah?” he spoke walking towards the door.
Fun little peek behind the curtain: so with this chapter this fic sits at 54k words. Where I'm at beginning the next chapter is at 57k words.....so i just realized I wrote basically 3k words of smut alone.....that's a lot for me. Hint hint, there's a lovely surprise awaiting the next chapter.
Once they’d had their dancing fill they waded their way back to the bar to find Charlie talking intensely to someone. Upon closer inspection of the build and hair he assumed it to be Balthazar.
naked husband. He could see his own come on Dean’s inner thighs from where it had dripped from his hole, cool and tacky. He imagined Dean’s ass, still open and ready for him, and picked up the pace, amused at the glare it earned him.
Cas, despite his initial freakout, hit the ground running. In one expensive Target trip, he came back with a crib, stroller, car seat, pack-n-play, swing, and several months’ worth of diapers. If Dean hadn’t elbowed his way in and insisted on helping, Cas would have put everything together single-handedly. By the time two weeks had passed, Claire’s room had an extra crib, half her closet was cleared out and replaced by gender neutral baby clothes, and the garage was filled with toys and other furniture, all waiting for the new baby. Not to mention the stacks of diapers invading the garage.
“Exta teese!” he parroted, struggling in his father’s arms in an attempt to get back to the presents.
It only took them a few more minutes to reach Dean’s room, but it could have been a lifetime. Cas was already half-hard in anticipation of what was to come, and when Dean paused to push the door open, Cas could see the hard outline of Dean’s cock through the silk of his fall front breeches.
, was a thorn in his side. He came in every morning with a smirk on his face and flirtations on his tongue. No one was safe from his advances. He flirted with every princess, every worker, and even the department manager. When he was in the makeup chair, his wig being glued and his freckles covered with a layer of foundation, every word that left his mouth were covered in a layer of honey.
Dean rolled his eyes and clapped the man on his back. “I grew up with Benny and he’s a good friend.”
Cas glanced at the building and then at his watch. Decision made, he approached Dean, standing only a foot from him. “I would have tried to find you, but I never had anything to go by. When you were young, the sightings would wake me up in the middle of the night. I hated them. When they stopped, I was relieved… Then they never came back. I thought I lost you. If it wasn’t for the strange dreams...”
She made a face. “Fine, but don’t forget to clean up after yourself and don’t forget about the cameras.”
Cas walked to the pick-up counter on wobbly knees and watched the barista get started on his drink. Watching him work was fascinating, although he was alarmed by the pumps of sugar that were going in his drink. He placed the cup on the counter with a straw and stepped back. Hesitantly, he grabbed the drink and took a sip. It was less sweet than he assumed it would be, and altogether not bad, but still, nothing compared to Missouri’s coffee. He took another sip anyway, eying the barista. “Thank you.”
“I’ve been at the war front for the last decade. The only letters I receive are missives from my fellow commanders or summons to the palace. I never got your letter. I would have sent a reply.”
“How would I know? I left early this morning. He’s probably finishing up his supper right now.” Or perhaps eating it directly off of his husband’s abs.
“I’m your soulmate.” He repeated, quieter this time. “That’s why I was trying to get you to pull over. I promise.”
Disneyland came to his rescue like he was a princess in a tower. He was hesitant to even apply, but Charlie was able to shake some sense into him.
“Well, technically we’re still on Disney property—” a sugar packet smacked him in the chest and his head whipped towards Charlie and Gilda, who were still innocently absorbed in conversation. He turned back to Cas and shook his head, mumbling with annoyance. “Just plain Dean.”
To be honest, it was probably the way the 6:30 light lit him up in a golden glow, softening his edges and turning his blue eyes molten like the ocean when the sun hit it. As much as he hated the early hour—who the hell signed up for a 7:30 am class, anyway?—he loved it for these exact moments of quiet before Claire started banging around her room, and Jack started crying for Dean. Before he had to get dressed and feed the kids and get them out the door and
”I just feel like such an ass,” he sighed into Cas’s shoulder. “Do you think Claire was mad at me? Shit… do you think she hates me?”
He could feel his face flush, but he pushed through. “Your tone is really good if you’re trying to emulate his style. He doesn’t seem to try too hard. A lot of authors add flowery symbolism or take themselves too seriously. Too much purple prose. Winchester doesn’t do that. It’s one of the reasons I like him.”
Who knew what would happen in the next year. Naomi would have to find a replacement, obviously, but from the way she spoke about Castiel, it seemed that someone as good as his would be nearly impossible to come by. Thankfully, he was expected home and Hester would have his head if he delayed a moment longer, so he would be able to avoid the immediate fallout. With that thought in mind, he rushed to his room and immediately threw his clothes into his traveling trunks. Within the hour, he was loaded into his carriage and heading home, leaving the palace and the whole mess behind him.
“Cas,” a deep voice grumbled from his left. Cas turned to see his husband staring at him, face flushed red with clear arousal and chest heaving, hardly giving a thought to Balthazar’s presence. “We’re getting the hell out of here.”
The servant cleared his throat nervously, telling Balthazar all he needed to know about his fathers current mood. “Prince Balthazar, Your Majesty.”
“You have to be quiet, sweetie. He’s sleeping.” He brushed her hair out of her face and pointed back to the door. “Take your shoes off. You know the rules.”
got Zachariah’s attention. He glanced up,looking as excited as Balthazar felt, sure that he was about to justify the war he’s been frothing for. “He won't be King for much longer… Now, give it here!”
The man’s lips parted and he looked at Dean in surprise. Clearly, that was the last thing he expected Dean to say. “I must have misheard. What did you say?”
Castiel turned to the room of servants and cleared his throat. They stopped in their tasks, nervously giving him their attention. He took in their reactions, noting their trepidation, and concluded that the angels they’ve dealt with from his kingdom hadn’t been the most gracious. If they had served his father or Michael at any time in the past, that was a guarantee. Well, this was going to be his home if his fiancé didn’t run screaming from the altar, and he was determined to change that impression. “If you’ll excuse us, I’d like to finish the preparations with my brother. Thank you for your help.”
Dean had to admit that Cas being a part of his apartment hunt put a warm feeling in his chest. He sent back an enthusiastic text, and spent the rest of the day texting pictures of all the best and worst things about each apartment. Some had bad kitchen layouts, ugly carpet, and tile counters. While others had cool retro fixtures, gyms and pools in the complex, and even one that had its own garage. They both agreed that the last one was the best. Baby deserved a roof over her head just as much as he did.
“That’s fair, but I promise you, he’s not a murderer. I was the one who issued his library card, and got to talk to him for a bit. He’s completely normal.”
“Venom?” he shrieked, voice higher than he intended. As if in reaction to Dean’s panic, the pain got impossibly worse. “Did you just say ‘
Cas slumped down next to him on the bed, tucking his wings into his side so he could spoon his husband. “That was…”
The man just smiled softly at him, gave him a simple “Have a nice day,” and let the window close behind him. Cas had to physically force himself to accelerate out of the drive-thru and continue on to work.
Their waitress saved them from an awkward silence and took their orders. Charlie and Gilda were turned towards each other, talking loudly and trying to give them as much privacy as you can give two people on a surprise blind date. He appreciated the effort, but he knew for a fact Charlie and Gilda were paying close attention and would be dissecting everything later.
He shut the door and sighed. Surely, by morning word would get out that Castiel was a hideous excuse for an angel, and his fiancé would cancel the whole ordeal. Facing his wedding day was the most stressful thing he’s ever gone through, more stressful than war or even dealing with his own family. With battle, he knew what to expect. There were plans, rules of engagement. But with a man he’s never met, there was only uncertainty, and there was nothing worse than that.
“I know.” He was there when Michael was married, and although he hadn’t been allowed to help, he had watched the process from start to finish, fascinated by the symbolism of it all. He’d asked questions the entire time, sometimes getting an answer, and sometimes told an emphatic ‘I don't know’ and to keep quiet. He’d done his own research afterward. The anointing oil was a blend using pressed olives from the oldest olive tree in the region as its base. The olive oil was meant to cleanse, the myrrh to purify, cinnamon for health, and the cassia oil for emotional well-being and grounding. Its strong scent tickled his nose as he discarded his banyan and rubbed the oil into his bath-softened skin, the cinnamon offering just the slightest tingle.
They took the time to lay out their towels and lather on sunscreen before Dean sat to relax. Sam grabbed his fins and his board before turning to Dean.
“You can’t check these books out, so I’m very familiar with the selection," Cas said, scanning the shelves. "Now, I think notoriety-for-profit would be covered in these…” He pulled two books from the middle shelf and turned, coming face to face with Dean.
Dean gave Cas’s stubbled cheek a light kiss. “Fine, we’ll watch A Christmas Carol, but it’s gotta be the old one.”
Dean laughed at her reaction. “Yeah, any kid of ours is going to have aunts and uncles to spare. I just have a brother, though.”
“It’s a date, then.” He said it out of habit, and immediately regretted it. Dean was just about to open his mouth and awkwardly backtrack, but Cas beat him to it.
at, but he needed the man to pull over now. Once they were face to face, he would be able to explain.
It wasn’t a question, so he just nodded and watched her pour him a cup and add a splash of cream. He was planning on swinging by the Starbucks on his way to work, but Missouri’s coffee was ten times better at half the price. He supposed that just this once, he could skip the drive-thru. “Yes, ma’am.”
crush. He’s a war hero and a prince, Dean. We couldn’t have chosen a better match. We were lucky King Zachariah was even willing to let him go.”
Dean scoffed. "No fucking way. If I stay on the shore, the fishing will be shit. Go big, or go home."
“Refreshing? You don't think he's a has-been? The guy has been writing for years. Isn't he just another washed-up author?”
Michael could have his fake tree and matching ornament set. Cas even stopped caring that they only went to Michael’s parents’ house for Christmas. The one thing he couldn’t have was this. Even when Michael rolled his eyes and called it dumb. Even when Michael played loud music in the kitchen because Castiel refused to pay attention to him when a movie was playing. Even when they were divorced and he cuddled onto the couch with a sleeping Claire in his arms, grateful that he had her in his life. These cheesy movies were his tradition.
The kicks were kind of fun in the beginning, but then he started aiming for where I sprained a rib two years ago, and it really hurts sometimes. I like it when he gets the hiccups, though. They’re pretty cute.”
“I don’t think Adam would forgive David so easily. If you remember, when Adam tried to warn him about the serial killer, David dismissed him, driving a wedge in their friendship and eventually leading to its end. He’d seen the villain’s behavior for what it was and tried to warn him, but David blew him off and forced him to leave..”
me!” Dean took a step closer and lowered his voice. “If you hadn’t fucked me this morning, I’d kick your ass right now.”
The two kingdoms had been allies since the reign of King Chuck, so while Zachariah would rather chop off his own wings than play nice with them, he was forced to keep up a diplomatic front, all the while hoping that Winchester would slip up and he would finally have an excuse to declare war and put them in their place. He didn’t need them, he rationalized. Zachariah could get help from the other angelic kingdoms, and while they were farther away and had demon problems of their own to deal with, he knew they would still come if he called for their aid.
“I want ham!” he yelled breathlessly, fighting to get Jack off his legs without sending him crashing off the couch. “Extra cheese, extra—  Oof!”
By the third day, Dean’s flirting began to grate on his nerves. He had felt special until he remembered that everyone was getting the same treatment. Even Charlie, who everyone knew was as gay as they came, was being flirted with outrageously.
Cas shook his head and checked to see which version was on the DVR. He found a suitably old one in black and white and pressed play. They settled into the cushions and cuddled as the opening credits began to play. By the time the ghost of Jacob Marley was shaking his chains at Scrooge, Cas was fast asleep. Dean only made it a little longer. One second, the Ghost of Christmas Present was showing Scrooge the Cratchit family, and the next, bare feet were slapping on the hardwood floor and Claire’s excited screeching was scaring him out of his slumber. He jerked against Cas, waking the man just as abruptly.
“I’d still like to help with your book, if you were serious about the offer.” Cas mentioned as soon as he got into Dean’s car. The leather seats squeaked under him as he turned his body to face Dean’s.
“Yes, but not everyone is a lesbian. I just think it's disrespectful. You’ve been out and proud since your first day, there’s no way he doesn’t know.”
Two separate articles on how to use pigs to dispose of a body. Cas’s eyebrows shot up. He couldn’t seriously be thinking that pigs would be a good way to get rid of a body. That would take too long, and besides, pigs were messy eaters. Robert Pickton learned that one the hard way. The other tab was about disposing of a body bit by bit, separating it into small pieces and where to put them. That one wasn’t too bad, as long as you were patient enough.
“So, tell me about the military. I’ve only been to the war front before I came of age, so I don’t know much. What exactly do you do?”
It was that realization that turned the tide. How dare he flirt with Charlie, who wore rainbow pins in her hair and spoke often of her girlfriend. How dare he put her in the awkward position of constantly having to be kind in her rebuttal because she would be fired if she let her attitude bleed through. It was wrong and set Castiel on edge. She couldn’t do anything other than smile and listen as he winked and smirked, or else she would lose her job.
He shook his head and glanced around. While they were drawing attention, people were largely going about their day. “This is strange.”
“Calm down, I got this.” Dean walked to his trunk and pulled out his spare pair of coveralls, rolling them into a wedge. “How about you lift the seat up and I’ll tuck this under the base so it's not so forward.”
“The longer we argue about the need to pee on Dean, the longer he will be in pain. How long ago was the sting?”
Dean  groaned and threw his forearm over his eyes. “Babe. You just— We just— I can’t even feel my legs!”
Dean let out a low groan, hands sweeping along every inch of wing they could. “I can’t believe I get to have you.”
She silenced him with a hand on his arm. “You’re working yourself up over nothing. He’s not a murderer.”
“You’re not the first person to tell me I don’t look like an angel,” he quipped, thinking back to his conversation the previous night with Samuel when the young prince had said that exact thing. “I’ve been told I’m unattractive before, and it no longer offends me.”
He led them through the halls in a hurry, eyes focused on the path ahead of him and his hand clasped around Cas’s forearm. They walked for a minute in silence before Dean suddenly stopped and turned to Cas, letting go of his arm like it had burned him. “Oh, uh… Are you ok with— shit. I didn't even ask if you’d want to. Do you?”
After a continental breakfast that consisted of watery oatmeal and dry muffins, Dean was on the road. It was hard to know how far north he should drive before he jumped on the highway, but he eventually settled on fifteen miles to account for the time his soulmate had been stuck in traffic. He was bound to recognize
Zachariah’s distaste of King John and the whole of the human species was notorious within the palace walls. He had been known to say that humans were nothing but vermin scurrying about the earth, sullying everything they touched. According to King Zachariah, the only good trait that humans possessed was the ability to multiply like the rats he often compared them to, which gave them the advantage of numbers. Zachariah would preach to anyone who would listen that angels were stronger and faster than humans on the battlefield, that their senses were better and their minds quicker, but the truth was that he needed them — there just weren’t enough angels to continue battling the demons alone. This only made his anger towards humans grow; in fact, even a mention of King John’s name would send Zachariah’s feathers quivering with anger.
Cas was panting loudly through his orgasm, trying his hardest to stay quiet as Dean sucked him lightly through the aftershocks. Finally, the hands gripping his hair and holding him in place loosened, and Dean took that as his cue to come up for air. He didn’t go far, planting his head in the crease of his clothed thigh and breathing harshly in time with Cas, trying his hardest not to get any fluids on Cas’s slacks.
Just then the waitress appeared with their burgers. Dean prayed internally thanking God that she cut through the rising tension in his chest with food. Dean went in on his burger while Cas picked at his fries. Cas searched Dean’s face for answers, but Dean just ate with his head down to avoid giving answers. Those blue eyes could make him do anything.
“Hey! I’m right here you know.” Chuck gasped. “Dean’s been teaching me a lot of things today. I think I might be getting a hang on this cooking stuff.”
“Wanna grab some burgers together? I know this great spot over on Main street. We can even get it to go if you really wanna get home.”
“It’s not my place to judge you for what you like. And it’s really none of anyone’s business. You aren’t hurting anyone with it so why do they care?”
The child made all sorts of gurgling noises in his attempt at having a conversation with Castiel. He egged him of with ‘is that so’ and ‘tell me more’. After a while Mark reached out for him and Cas was more than happy to hold him. As soon as he had him in his grasp little hands flew to the top of his head swiping at his hair.
Dean made quick work of turning him into a goo puddle of pure arousal. Sucking, licking, slurping, all the sounds that a good rimming entailed. He took a chance as looking behind him to find Dean stroking himself, cock standing straight up, red and leaking at the tip. Suddenly he felt a slicked finger prodding at his entrance. Dean was excited, but he’d never hurt Castiel, he was gentle as he opened him up.
He followed him to the door and swung it open for him. Just as he was about to walk out, he turned with a blaze in his eyes that was similar to the one from the night prior.
“Well think of it this way. Whenever he sees you you’re with Dean. So since he calls Dean Uncle, he figures it’s the right thing to call you as well. If you’d feel better I can correct him and he’ll just call you Cas.”
Dean had spent the night. That was a surprise, but then the man stayed for breakfast the next morning and that was an even bigger surprise. They traded banter over hot mugs of coffee. At first it felt like old friends catching up, something he couldn’t see himself doing with anyone that he’d known before. But then the soft touches began, and it exploded into something much bigger.
Saturday morning—well once he’d looked at his phone it was actually the afternoon. Castiel hadn’t slept that long in a very long time. Again he was reminded that he was getting comfortable here. No dreams had plagued him, no visions of the past, or warnings of the future. He’d just slept. As he rose from his bed to start his morning tea and get ready for the day he realized how good he felt. To just rise with a light heart and empty mind, it was invigorating. He wondered if this was a normal occurrence for the average person, to just awaken every morning in such a lazy fashion. He didn’t have to work, he didn’t need to run from anything. This ease was something he could get used to, even if it wasn’t the best course of action.
“I woke up when I felt you moving. Just didn’t say anything cause I thought you’d go back to sleep.”
Dean let out an all-around belly laugh at that. It was so loud and went on for so long that it would make him pretty annoyed if the other man didn’t look so gorgeous while he lit up like that. Concluding that Dean was clearly laughing at him and not with him, he lightly smacked him on the arm in chastisement.
Closer than close they still were as he came down from his height. Dean’s clean hand in his hair, Castiel’s hands caressing his still damp back. He wanted Dean to stay the night, wrap the other man up in his arms and hold him in his warmth. If only he could get the words out of his mouth. Dean wiped the majority of his cum off on the apron and the rest he licked from his hand.
“Yeah…I don’t know Cas just…he’s really in tune with me sometimes. He can tell when it’s time to drop a subject, or when I don’t want to talk at all. Like after I left Bobby’s and you called him, he…um…came over and stopped me from drinking too much.”
“I didn’t say a word. Just watched you watched me. What’s going on in that pretty little head of yours?”
Cas hummed in response and they returned to eating in silence. Dean picked up the tab. This felt awfully like a date, but he pushed the thought behind a door in his mind. They got into the car and rode to Cas’ house neither of them talking while ACDC played softly in the background. They pulled up to the small house and Dean looked to Cas ready to say his good bye’s.
Making his way through the sea of bodies proved to be quite difficult, he did his best to not bump into anyone, but failed several times. His ass was grabbed a number of times, a few others offering a drink and a dance, but he just kept going to his goal.
“Look I need you to figure this all out right NOW!” he hollered into the phone. “Father was very explicit about—“
“No honey, they give the illusion of being clothed. Imagine Dean strutting around in a pair of these, bending over to grab something, or cooking dinner. Hmm?”
Mark squirmed and fussed in his fathers arms so Sam retreated in the house in search of a bottle. Once Dean finished unloading the several bags and boxes of new stuff for the kid he exchanged good byes and went home to do some grading. He encouraged his students to send him rough drafts of their essays so he could give his comments and they could fix them before handing it in for the final grade. He opened his email to find only Cas and another student named Kevin had submitted drafts. Cas.
He looked up to find Dean much closer than he was before. Those green eyes and that stunning aura enveloping and effectively trapping him in its existence. Overtaken by their proximity, both men met in the middle in a clash of lips and teeth. As harsh as the mutual attack was, the pleasure of it was very much there. Phone forgotten it fell out of his hands and in between the couch cushions. Strong hands wrapped around his side and back, pulling him into Dean’s warm lap. He went willingly, bracing himself on strong shoulders, their chests pressed up against one another.
Dean rolled his eyes again and handed Cas the phone. When Cas cocked his head to the side in confusion he shrugged his shoulders.
He went through his other two classes with half his mind in tact. The other half was filled with his mythology professor. The man had to be part of this history he taught. He was way too beautiful to belong to this time period. Once his third class let out he ran straight to Charlie’s car feeling relief that she was already there waiting for him.
Without another word Dean slowly pushed into him. Heat surrounded him immediately and he entered with little resistance. The pressure felt amazing and he had to take a second so he wouldn’t come instantly.
It was late, 1 am when Sam crept down the stairs of Bobby’s house to find his Dad in the kitchen, huddled over a glass of water with his head in his hands. He could see beads of sweat had formed on the man’s forehead despite it being quite cool in the house. Sam pulled out a chair and John’s head popped up at the sound, fixing his youngest son with a small, gentle smile.
Dean’s tone of voice held enough weight that Castiel felt he meant more then just his office hours. He pulled out his assignments and got right to work. A question nagged at his brain that he’d been wanting to ask Dean since the first second he laid eyes on the man. He decided against it for fear of being to comfortable and ultimately inappropriate.
“You telling me you wouldn’t want to see him in this.” He tugged a random pair of deep blue mesh boxer briefs off the rack.
So for those of you who couldn't read this I promised a summary. And what I promise I shall give. Pretty much Cas is telling Dean what happened between him and Dick and why he shies away from a lot of the physical aspects of their relationship. Dick and Cas were semi-close due to their families but they got closer after Cas' mom dies. Cas develops romantic feelings for him when they start college and he thinks he's in love. Dick takes advantage of Cas' limited knowledge of what a healthy relationship should be like and he basically keeps their relationship a secret. Dick got wild in college experimenting with drugs and alcohol in college. He got pretty wild at a party he dragged Cas to and ended up making out with some other dude. Cas tries to end it but since Dick is a manipulative dick (lol im corny i know) he gets Cas to be with him again. They're at another party and Dick spikes Cas' drink and him and some friends have their non-consented way with Castiel. Cas switches schools after becoming friends with Charlie and....here we are in present day.  The end of the trigger heavy section is marked with 888888 as I said in the note above!
Dean was in no state to drive so Sam had taken the key to the Impala and drove them and Charlie on down to Singer Auto with Mr. Novak and Gabriel following them.
“That’s way too many mouths to feed. I had a hard enough time taking care of Sammy.” Dean was clutching his stomach now he was laughing so hard.
Castiel felt a little silly doing this, but it was also exciting to have just Dean’s voice and his imagination to go off of. He was trying so hard not to make a sound as the fabric ran across his impossibly hard arousal.
“That’s what I came here to apologize about, along with all the other shit I pulled over the years.”
“Gabriel, this is beyond the worst prank you’ve ever pulled on me. You need to reschedule. I can’t do this.” he began packing his belongings.
He was seething and made entirely of impatience by the time he noticed a man in a suite with keys in his hand walking towards the room. Dean squared his shoulders, and strapped on his meanest expression heading towards the door. When it was opened he was more than ready to body slam anyone who touched a hair on Castiel’s head.
“Did I? That feels like it was so long ago.” Dean made his own plate and sat at the island that was placed in the middle of the room.
“You can spin that bullshit for Mom and Dad but I’ve seen the way you look at him. You haven’t looked like that in a long time. Plus I catch you smiling? All the red flags are there Dean.”
Overall it was a pleasant day. Totally risking drowning in embarrassment he looked up the closest place he could find massage oils and other products you would need when having sex with another man. It brought him a sense of excitement as he got off the bus near the adult store he’d found. The building was amidst a strip mall, much like where he worked. This one was much more obvious with bustling life. There was a dog groomer, nail salon, and a party store. It rattled him a little that there were many cars in the parking lot, families going on about there day when he had such debauchery on his mind. The shop itself looked surprisingly welcome for its intended purpose. He thought that adult stores would be tucked in dark corners where not many people went. At least that’s what he had seen in movies and read in books.
Cas smiled at Dean for using the endearing term. “I like pie Dean you don’t have to breakup with me.”
Balthazar, tie askew, stumbled towards him. His suit jacket was missing, probably forever. He wasn’t sloppily drunk, but his intoxication was clear to him.
“That’s kind of what I wanted to talk to you about Cas.” She took her lower lip between her teeth in a sign of nervousness. It was eerie to see so much of Dean in his mother. “See with all the tourists we’re gonna need all the rooms we’ve got. We don’t often get people staying full time.”
“I will have to go home later. Father wanted to have dinner together since one of my other brothers are in town.”
“Well yes. I’m not uh…ready for sexual intercourse, but the bed is quite large so we could fit in it and..” he trailed off.
He slid his arms around his neck and placed a peck on his lips. Dean melted into his arms scooting forward on the stool. He was eager and he didn’t want to tease the other man too much knowing he wasn’t willing to go all the way just yet. He pulled back and stared into those gentle green eyes. Dean looked so beautiful just sitting there like that ready to be devoured. Cas truly couldn’t help himself and he dove in for another kiss. The tang of the citrus drink was ripe on his lips mixed heavenly with a taste that was solely Dean.
Outside of Castiel, but definitely not separate from here, there were large things in motion. He got an urgent message from Charlie to meet up. Once he got to Moondoor he immediately went to her office, while she was busy with a customer. Sitting down in a plushy chair, covered in Death stars, he scrolled through his phone aimlessly waiting for his friend.
“That was pretty cheesy dude.” Dean laughed softly. He placed a kiss on Cas’ lips then leaned his head back to take in the sight of his face. His lips were parted and his cheeks were flush like they had been in the club the other night. Dean took in so much pleasure just staring at the beautiful man in front of him.
They both knew it was a blatant lie, but Dean didn’t know what else to say, and Cas didn’t want to fight about it. Dean shoved all his graded and ungraded assignments into his bag before rising from his desk getting ready to take leave.
While Castiel enjoyed the library a great deal, he didn’t like that he had to return the books. He was a fast reader, but he liked to take his time while diving into a good story. This particular library had such a short and stringent return policy. Though he didn’t have many he’d made sure that the books he really fell for remained in his small collection. With a bookstore so close by he’d need a bookshelf. A bookshelf for his apartment. The chance at giving into to the hope and optimism that kept burrowing itself inside him, was as tempting as ever. He wanted to believe the spirit that visited him. Even though its appearance was quite startling he felt no malice from the being. The question at this point was should he put stock in what it said. If it was true, he wouldn’t mind settling in Lawrence.
“So, Cas,” Charlie had followed behind him. “I like you. You’re adorable and all that. but I gotta tell you, Dean is incredibly important to me.”
They cleaned up and curled under the blankets to take a midmorning nap. These are the moments when Dean let himself be most vulnerable and that was something he valued highly. Intimacy was integral to him, and the fact that he got to experience it with such a wonderful man was astounding.
“What color are they?” Cas asked trying to picture Dean with his legs open and spread across the couch laying with his head on the arm rest, his usual position while watching tv.
Dean didn’t feel good about this at all. Sam must’ve been on the same wave if his side-eye was anything to believe. They didn’t have time to consult with the rest of the group. This was a hear and now decision.
“Well with the summer comes tourist season. People from all over will be coming for vacation and they’ll need a home away from home.”
“If it wasn’t I probably wouldn’t divulge that information.” He took a nervous sip of his beer, giving himself some time away from those friendly, open eyes.
Just as they were about to walk out the door, John comes stumbling down the stairs. Everyone can tell he’s heavily intoxicated. Castiel turns and stands with his shoulders squared in front of Dean.
Dean lowered his head against his better judgement and looked at Cas and the display made just for him. His mouth millimeters from his dick. He moaned just at the sight of it. Cas smiled and closed his eyes, his tongue shooting out licking a line from base to tip. Then he took it all in his mouth again with such friction Dean thought he was going to stroke out right then and there. Cas bobbed relentlessly. Little moans from deep in his throat rang out. Dean shuddered at the vibrations and put his hand to the top of Cas’ head and then he just stopped.
“Yeah he came by the Roadhouse last night. I was just there talking to Ellen and decided to bother Jo for a little bit.”
The rest of the week droned on for Dean. He was happy to have Cas by his side, and since the emotional night they shared they were closer than ever. Cas was opening himself in ways Dean never knew existed. He saw a whole new component to the man’s personality. His smiles came easier, his laughter loud and bright. It was beautiful, Cas was beautiful. Not to mention brave as hell for telling Dean such a painful past. He was downright inspired by his angel, that’s why on Friday afternoon he found himself in his brother’s apartment getting ready to go see his Dad.
“All fine and dandy darling. Wouldn’t want to make your beau jealous.” He reached into his pocket for a business card and handing it over. “The second number is my personal cell. Just text me time if you’re able to make it.”
“Feel good angel?” Dean asked the rhetorical question cause he was feeling bold and amazing. He knew it felt good, he just wanted to hear Cas say it.
He slid up to the other man and stood between his spread legs as strong arms came to wrap around his neck. Bending slightly forward from lips to crotch they connected. Dean yielded to him immediately, a soft whine escaping him as Castiel kissed him deeply. He wanted the man to think about this exact kiss while he was doing whatever he had to do. Though he accepted what Dean did for a living, and was not going to get in the way of that whatsoever, he still felt the sudden need to possess him in this moment.
His hands roamed up and down his arms, along his chest, in his hair. He wanted to feel Dean wherever he could reach. It took him a while to realize Dean wasn’t touching him the same way. He paused their kissing and opened his eyes to see one of Dean’s hands on the mattress holding him up and the other between his legs. Dean was prepping himself. His lust blown eyes were focused on Castiel and his kiss stained lips hung open.
“So good to me.” he resumed kneading into the tight flesh, spreading his cheeks to get a better look. “Take all this off.”
Cas took this at his signal to back away. Gabe always hugged Castiel whenever he had a panic attack and it brought him out.
Dean pointed to the chair and Castiel sat down right away. He could feel the anticipation humming below his skin. The man looked him dead in the eyes and without any fanfare at all he’d stripped off his shirt and pants. His boxers were removed a little slower to reveal that lovely soft looking dick he’s only seen in person one another time, but hundreds on a screen. The small bulge that was in his pants since back at the coffee shop was now full and at attention.
“That would be running away Cas.” He let out a heavy sigh. “To be honest I’m pretty tired of running. Let’s go in there and mingle. That’s what we’re here for.”
They dropped little Mark off. Ellen gushed about the baby getting big and chastised Sam for not combing his hair. Bobby even got a little wound up about the kid. They were now on their way to the bar. Dean had his music up loud to distract himself from the butterflies that went rogue in his stomach. They pulled up to the gravel parking lot and pulled in a spot right at the front. Dean looked around as he got out of the car and spotted Charlie’s red hatchback.
Today it was a college student that was dabbling in unauthorized magick. Whatever they were trying to accomplish was having a bad effect on the people in this dorm building, turning people’s skin blue. The people were physically fine otherwise, but having blue skin had to make every day life a little hard. The task was to stop them and bring them in. Having such a strong connection to magick like this in the first place was rare, Charlie and her girlfriend were gonna take this person under their wing, teach them how to use their natural gifts. Those were their words, not Dean’s. He rolled his eyes at the memory just as he rolled them then. Witches were a handful even when they weren’t killing people.
Dean took the plate from him, gathering a fork full and moving it towards his lips. He opened his mouth and got a taste of the best pie he’d ever tasted. Dean was correct, his pie was far superior to the slices they had at the café.
Dean pocketed his phone and prayed to whoever was listening that Charlie could make it. Dean knew that if it was just the 3 of them everything would go down hill. Sam would make a mess of everything as he always does, and Dean would have to grudgingly clean it up.
“Yeah I did. I actually got back to town a bit before you moved here. Now I’m just looking for a firm willing to take me on.”
Kevin didn’t know what to do, what to feel when the black bag was taken off the figure on the floor to reveal none other than Castiel’s face. He sustained a head would that yielded a single trail of blood making its way down his pale face. He looked like shit, and that wasn’t meant to be insulting because he really did look like he was dragged through hell. Deep dark circles under his eyes were evidence enough that he wasn’t treated well. His eyes were so unfocused he wasn’t sure if he recognized him, much less knew where he was.
“Those some strong words Sammy.” Dean couldn’t help but let out a light chuckle at that. Sam was never vulgar, that was Dean’s thing.
Watching as the man took a fat glob of lube in his hand, he hadn’t even waited for it to warm in his palm before he took his arousal in hand and began to pump it at a tastefully slow pace. Castiel could swore he felt beads of sweat forming on his forehead. The fire of his own lust was getting to him now. His hands gripped his own thighs tightly, the tips of his nails digging in even through his pants. He needed something, anything to take the edge off.
“It’s cool man. Nothing bad is gonna happen. You might get a nice buzz and it’ll loosen you up.” Dean popped the caps on both them, sitting them in the empty pizza box he’d throw away once it was time to go to sleep.
He was shaking from the anger tearing its way through his body. Closing his eyes he hoped the fear wouldn’t make its way to his voice.
“Nice to meet you too Cas.” His smile had the nerve to get brighter. “Well I better get ready. Don’t wanna take up too much of y’all time.”
“Um yeah I am.” He found Dean absolutely adorable when he was flustered. He decided not to hold back anymore. He grabbed at Deans belt loops and pulled him flush to his body.
Castiel has always been a very observant person. He was always very aware of his surroundings, often times weary when things felt out of place. It was like a 6th sense for him. So when Sam dropped him off at Dean’s building, he felt that same weariness, like someone was watching him go in the building. He walked towards the front door quickly, only pausing to throw Sam one last wave before he darted inside.
Castiel followed him and watched as he set up several closed dishes of food. He took a portable griddle out of the box and set it on the stove. When he finished he walked right into Castiel’s space, placing his hands on his hips.
“I know I know, it’s just…well now you can see why I’m so hesitant to believe anything any one says.”
He’d look at any further responses when he was done. For now, it was time to dive into it. Clicking the play button he was rattling with energy. It began with the image of the thumbnail, Dean just spreading and squeezing his cheeks, letting them go and doing it all over again. Castiel was ramrod straight at this point but it was only a 10 minute video so he wanted to draw this out. It wasn’t time yet to touch himself. With a dry finger Dean poked and prodded at the hole, with his headphones on he could pick up all the background noise including Dean’s heavy breathing. It appeared that he was in the bathroom from the lighting and the countertop in front of him. No wonder it looked so good.
“I’m sure you’re aware that what happened between me and my ex was…. far from being ok. I don’t want to share everything right now. There are just some things that I’m sure you’ll want to know before we make this…official.”
“From what I’ve seen of your family with the exception of your father, they’re incredibly accepting and passionate people. If you just let them know that you’re uncomfortable with sharing that then I doubt they’d judge you about it.”
“Beecause Dean will just brush me off with an ‘im fine’ and give no further detail. Look Cas, “he took a beat of silence to let go of a heavy sigh, “I’m not trying to use you to spy on my brother or anything. I’m just really worried about him, and he’s kind of shutting me out.”
“You’re right, he won’t. But I knew he was gonna pull his little stunt—that’s part of the reason I wanted you to come. Plus I gotta show off my hot boyfriend.” He wriggled his brows and smiled.
“I’ll be back in a little while Dad.” He got off the couch and went to through his dinner trash away.
He chuckled at he pulled out and sat on the stool at the island. Dean plated some food and brought it over with a steaming cup of coffee. Once everything was laid out Castiel dug in the smorgasbord that was displayed to him. He loved Dean’s cooking. No matter what he made.
Right then his door swung open and said brother came stomping into the apartment. His shoulders were raised with rage and tension. This was going to get even farther out of hand before it got any better. Sam stood toe to toe with his father now. His head towering over the man. Sam may be a lanky man but he was far from weak and could easily take their father down. Cas left Dean only for a second to grab his phone again in case the police needed to be called this time. Dean fixed Cas with a scrutinizing gaze that could only mean him asking how Sam knew about this. Cas nodded and held up his phone. Dean returned his nod with one of his own and went to Sam’s side pushing him back from his father.
Was Dean as much of a coffee man as he was? Taking in several cups a day like he had been for the last few years wasn’t at all healthy, but tell that to early morning Castiel. That guy would behead the nearest anything that came between him and caffeine at first thing. Coffee would be easy, due to his addiction he was aware of all the good spots within a 10 mile radius of his residence. Wouldn’t be difficult at all to sit over some pastries and past the time with good conversation until the steam stop flowing and their mouths were covered in crumbs.
“Like it? Dean this is the most beautiful thing anyone has ever gotten me.” he surged up and kissed Dean sloppily and filled with heat. Dean tilted his head to the side to deepen the kiss, his tongue reaching out asking Castiel for entrance. He complied instantly and their tongues came together gently shifting the gears of the kiss from heated to passionate.
Dean lying down for a bit turned into Dean being in his room for the rest of the night. Sam went out for a while to retrieve his son from the baby sitter and he returned with the baby and a couple bags in hand. He found Cas sitting in the same spot he left him. Castiel smiled as Sam sat next to him with a very happy Mark pinned to his hip.
Dean tore at his jeans trying to get them down, then he spun Castiel around to get a look for himself. Sure enough tucked in perfectly was a shiny silver butt plug.
“Don’t try to hide the obvious Castiel. I can see it all over you. Went out with Dean last night didn’t you?”
He took a second to get his bearings and then he was off. Tugging on his cock and shoving the toy inside of him like a man on a mission. He threw his head back with a groan, forcing Castiel to move even closer. He focused on where the toy was disappearing into his body before widening the shot and getting Dean’s shaking legs. This, this right here was why Dean was Castiel’s favorite person to watch. Though he was ‘putting on a show’ as his brother put it, the man was clearly actually enjoying himself. That realness was what god Castiel hooked. It was why he was so damn close to coming in his pants right now.
Dean dug Cas’ arousal out of his boxers and began to stroke him. He moved towards Cas’ neck and began kissing and biting every spot he could hit. Cas moaned through each kiss and some point he got his hand on Dean’s erection and stroked him with fever. A little out of rhythm but damn did it feel good. Dean could feel his orgasm coming and he didn’t want it to end. He stopped all movement and pushed Cas on his back.
They left that day with high spirits, confident that they tried their best, and if she didn’t choose them, then at least they knew what to expect with their next interview.
might be the outcome? He wanted to laugh at the absurdity of it all, but the priest was still going. Dean hadn’t stopped the ceremony, and the king was looking down at them with pride.
He shook his head and took a sip of the coffee. Sam could have all the fun he wanted on that thing, but Dean preferred to have his feet on the ground. “Hell, no.”
While he was a little uncomfortable with the attention he was drawing, he recognized it could be worse. He tucked his wings into his back, aware that he was taking up twice as much space as everyone else, and approached the stall, his curiosity winning out over his apprehension of the crowd. After sidestepping a few villagers, he was at his husband's side, and Dean immediately laced their fingers together before introducing him to the woman. She gushed about what a handsome pair they made and immediately started pushing jars of colorful jams into his arms. He took them, a little shocked at the kind gesture, and before he could even think of trying to pay her, she shooed them away.
Kelly looked exhausted but pleased as they entered, and immediately gestured to the baby in the bassinet. “Ta-da!”
They ran into problems immediately. The base was already set up and ready to go, so all they had to do was clip the car seat in and drive away, but as Cas climbed in to sit next to Jack, he made a grunt of annoyance.
The casual insult brought a smile to his face. “Now that I’m officially a part of the Winchester household, I can agree with your statement. He
Dean’s heart stuttered in his chest. A boy. Kelly was having a boy. He had to fight to keep his composure. He hoped Kelly would see the kicking as a sign, because he sure as hell was. “That’s gotta be weird.”
The number was unknown, but that hardly meant anything since Cas constantly forgot to label the numbers, even ones that called often.
He turned to a drooling Jack, Eggo waffle clenched in his fist and scrambled eggs stuck between the strands of his hair. “Isn’t that right, Jack? You’re such a big boy, aren’t you!”
Things only got worse when King John proposed a stronger alliance. His first son, Crown Prince Dean, had just come of age, and since Crown Prince Michael was nearing his thirtieth year still unattached, it made sense to unite their kingdoms in marriage. King Zachariah’s angry ranting could be heard throughout the castle, and the next morning, Michael was engaged to a princess from the nearest angelic kingdom and an apologetic reply was sent to their ally. His other brothers were married off in quick succession before King John could even think to pen another missive.
He smirked. “I’m always right. Now, I need to hop into the shower. I can smell myself right now, and it's not pretty. Wanna join me?”
The moment the man walked out of sight, Cas was striding over. The chair was still warm when he slid onto the lacquered wood and grabbed the mouse. Clicking on the internet icon, he was surprised to see that the page had merely been minimized, and he grinned at his luck. There were multiple tabs open, all researching hotels in the areas, with pictures and lists of amenities. Disappointment bloomed in his gut. It would be just his luck that today the man had been making vacation plans. He went into the history, hoping that there would be something, anything suspicious, but the only other thing he had researched were recipes for strawberry rhubarb pies.
“Horses? That’s a lot of work.” Dean paused to take a breath and a drink of water. “Damn Cas I haven’t laughed like that in years.”
The rest of their time hanging out was fun, but the things Charlie said stayed in the back of his mind. Of course when he got back to his home the first thing he looked up was rimming. He was appalled by the images he saw. Various men and women in different positions, with a partner or multiple people licking in between their cheeks. It was vulgar and obscene, and he didn’t understand why anyone would want to do that. Exiting the browser he locked his phone and left it in his bedroom in search of dinner.
The event itself…wasn’t all bad though, just mostly. He got to see some of the people he didn’t see very often since their schedules conflicted. It could be a good time if it wasn’t for the runner up’s, those who were just below the top. While his group saw it as a hassle, they saw it as an opportunity and everywhere one man in particular would do his best to corner Dean, trying to get him to film with him. He swore off the guy that one time he’d said yes, and dude didn’t know how to take a hint. Now, he hoped, showing up with his boyfriend would ward the guy off. At least a little. His plan was surround himself with his pals and Cas, stay for two or so hours and hightail it out of there.
Castiel was instantly alert as someone was shaking his shoulder gently. His eyes blinked up to the friendly face of the driver. She had an almost sympathetic look on her face, like she could tell he was running. He wondered how many people she had to do this for on a daily basis. He shook the last tendrils of sleep off of himself as the woman stepped back, still smiling down at him.
The next time he comes to he’s in his bed. Like the night prior was just a dream. The sun is shining right on his face and his head is pounding mercilessly. He’s laying on his side in a t-shirt and some sweatpants. He smells soap on himself. He tries to move but everything ached so badly. Everything hurt so badly he could barely move. So he just stopped trying. He just laid there with silent tears rolling down his face and just let everything hurt.
They hopped out of the truck and made their way to the front door shoulder to shoulder. Just Sam being this close was calming Dean’s nerves. He reached out and turned the knob walking inside with his brother not far behind him. Closing the door behind them Sam walked ahead calling for Bobby and his dad. Dean, however, looked around the house. He felt like he hadn’t been there in ages, but everything felt like it was in the same place as last time. Bobby was a creature of habit. To an outsider his living room would look like a pile of dusty chaos, but Dean was family and he knew that everything in the room had its rightful place. On the desk were piles of ancient looking books as usual. Some were open and some were just meant as coasters for his normal glass of whiskey. The house smelled of burning wood and freshly baked bread. The smell was so familiar, took him back to all the summers he spent at this old house. All the late nights when Bobby would let them stay out well past the street lights turning on. Catching fireflies in the back yard with Sammy while not caring about being bitten alive by frisky mosquitos. It was a darker, but much simpler time.
Though he was eternally grateful for Dean’s acceptance of his past it still was jarring to see Dick again and for Dean to almost get into a fight with the man. He shared all the recounts of last night and she listened without one interruption. It was difficult going all over it again. A small piece of him felt like he was reliving it just from talking about it.
Dean was baffled at how this man could possibly a surgeon the way he failed at doing the simplest tasks. Doesn’t he cut into actual people, he thought. Dean and Chuck worked in mainly silence until Castiel arrived with Gabriel. Dean let out an anxious breathe, very happy that he was no longer forced to be alone with his boyfriend’s father. Once said boyfriend walked into the kitchen holding a bag filled with sweet potatoes he shot him a thankful smile and received a nod and a smirk in return.
Currently they were all sitting on the couches, half watching a movie. There wasn’t enough room for everyone, so Charlie and Dean sat on the floor. He wanted another beer, enjoying the lose feeling that it was giving him. The kitchen smelled so strongly of food and seasoning; it was a scent that he didn’t know that he missed from his home.
“Oh Yeah? What’s doing it for you? The B.O before 9am or the possibility of sunburn?” he waggled his eyebrows.
Dean went back to his work. Slightly flushed in his cheeks from his remarks of Castiel’s name. It actually made him smile. To see that he wanted to be polite to the man. They finished up their work shortly after. Dean leaned back in his chair to stretch. His shirt rose just a little and Castiel saw a small strip of his bare skin. He wanted to touch so bad. Luckily the hulking desk was in the way of Castiel making the worst mistake he had in a long time.
“That’s the thing Dean, I’m not really sure if I’m ready for this. I mean I want to, but God do I miss her. I just think it would be ok do integrate myself back into the dating world you know.”
Once Dean was finished only then did he look up and he only looked at Castiel, their eyes meeting in a somber understanding. He felt like one day he’d hear the story behind that song, it certainly wasn’t a tale for tonight. He handed the man back the guitar with a polite smile and a word of thanks as everyone clapped for his performance and began to disperse. Dean walked away with that sad smile still haunting his features, he hadn’t even noticed that Castiel stayed behind, getting a business card from the man of the booth.
He abandoned the soapy, sweet smelling water and crossed right in Dean’s view. His heart on his sleeve and his courage in the palm of his hand he stood in front of Dean and was not moving. Of course this earned him a confused look from his lover.
“I’m not jealous.” He didn’t mean to pout but, if he was perceived as jealous then that meant he thought they were something that they weren’t.
“Well back before I moved here, at my old school, believe it or not I actually had a lot of friends. One of them use to throw these slumber parties when his parents were away. It went much like this, minus the alcohol. But we would play games. You know kiddie party games, until one day they suggested we play spin the bottle. Long story short I got another guy on my spin, we mostly resisted the idea of kissing each other, but we did and I liked it, but when it came to the girls I really just wasn’t feeling it.”
“Well one sideways glance is all it’ll take for me to kick his ass out of here.” Ellen piped up walking in from the kitchen. “He thought he could get away with it last time. Don’t you think for a second Sam didn’t tell us about him busting into your place and disrespecting the two of you.”
Cas rose his hips to meet Dean and his kisses were growing in desperation. Dean groaned as Cas’ erection ground into his own. Castiel growled low in the back of his throat in response. Dean loved every bit of physical contact he had with the man, but his favorite was whenever they kissed. Every slide of their lips sent a wave of emotion through Dean’s body. He felt a soft hand creep up the hem of his t-shirt and when skin touched skin his resolve began to crumble. He pulled away from Cas sitting on his heels and peeled the shirt off slow, hoping Cas would enjoy the little show he was giving. He knew he was right when he heard Cas inhale sharply.
Greetings with another chapter! No warnings or anything with this one. Just happy happenings. Hope you enjoy xoxo
The telltale sound of a cap being opened was loud in his ears and that meant Dean was getting down to business. He rubbed it around the area for a bit and then began pushing that digit in. He let it sit for a moment before he just went to town on it. Pushing in and out, twisting and tugging on the area. Castiel wanted nothing more than to have Dean right in front of him, doing this before his face.
He looked at Cas and with a firm hand on his shoulder, turned him to meet his intense gaze. With that same hand he pressed his calloused palm to Castiel’s stubble. He moved his fingers, softly, hoping the touch would get his point across. They were taking a big step, a giant, heaping step. This was no small task to Dean. He wasn’t sure what it meant to Cas, but this meant a hell of a lot to Dean. His family was his lifeline, the people that kept him going, kept him alive. The fact that he wanted to bring him around such a big piece of him meant that he wanted Castiel to be apart of that lifeline.
“You’ve got my blessing Sam, but really it comes down to who little man likes.” He took a swing from his beer and peered at Mark’s little smiling face looking between his father and Uncle.
“Dean—stop.” His words were barely a whisper, trying to speak through the cloth tied around his head, and took so much energy to say that much. He could feel the stinging of tears well up in his eyes. He just wanted this nightmare to be over.
Castiel loved how protective his friend was over him. She had been with him through the after math of the whole ordeal.  He was grateful for her kindness and every chance he got he had let her know that. For a while after that night Charlie was the only person he had felt comfortable being himself around. That was of course until Dean fell from the sky and swept him away in an ocean of green.
A single nod was all he offered. The cloth was taken off and he was happy to be able to lick his lips. Small blessings and all that.
For years the Hunter’s Initiative and the Men of Letters had been on the hunt for an old magick text. One that contained the location of a pretty large bunkers of theirs. They had the key, that had been passed down through generations of Winchester, it was the site that was the issue. With all the information that this place contained, they could do their jobs much more efficiently, gain much more knowledge to save more lives.
He thought Dean would just give a ‘you’re welcome’, but he’d stood there, clearly waiting for something.
Dean had just came out of the restroom, while he was skipping his Algebra class when he saw a couple of the football players beating on Johnathan. He put a stop to it, beating down all 3 of them at once. It was safe to say that everyone involved were in utter shock at what took place, especially Johnathan.
He glanced at his phone where it sat on the night stand. His tea was too hot to drink and his mind was too wound up to concentrate on reading. With a long sigh he dived into the inevitable and thumbed his phone to attention.
Reluctantly Cas followed his brother’s advice as he received a text from Dean letting him know he was on his way.
“Jealous are we?” he laughed. “You have nothing to worry about I can assure you. It’s just a bunch of college studies trying not to let all the money we’ve spent here go to waste.”
Dean took the last comment towards him as he’d better come for dinner if he knew what was good for him. The man didn’t sound threatening at all, but Dean could admit he would rather be in the good graces of Cas’ family. Gabe clapped Dean on the back and ushered him out the door before Cas could get a hold of him. He even closed the door behind them.
“I guess I only preferred to receive because that was all I’d know. Now I’m not so sure. I believe I enjoy both, especially if it’s with you.”

He hung up and toweled off. Pulling a thick knit sweater on and some jeans he then headed downstairs to see if his father might be home. He wasn’t of course and Castiel rolled his eyes at that not so surprising fact. He practically lived at the hospital nowadays. Even when he was supposed to be off he worked. Saving another soul from the perils of death. Castiel tried not to be negative about it. He loved the fact that his Father was so happy with being a doctor, saving people was important. He felt like a bad person when he felt his jealously towards his Father’s patients.
Dean was doing his best to help Cas’ father make dinner for the night. It was Christmas Eve morning and they’d been slaving in the kitchen for a good 3 hours. Cas had left about an hour ago to do last minute shopping with Gabriel for their father and Dean was left alone with the man. He couldn’t cook to save his life but Dean was trying not to lose his patience. This was Castiel’s father for crying out loud, he couldn’t afford to be disrespectful, but dammit the man was really hopeless. He started him off with veggie chopping and the man sliced a gash through his finger, then he tried having him do the mac and cheese and he somehow messed up the noodle to cheese ratio. Now he wanted him to use the mixer so he could fill some pie shells for his sweet potato pie and he managed to splatter half of it on himself and the other on the wall. He texted Cas begging him to come back as quick as possible and to pick up some extra sweet potatoes.
“I’m only gonna have one of these and then I’ll have what your having and space it out with water. Don’t worry buttercup I remember the plan.”
“This looks amazing Mary. Thank you for inviting me.” he says politely as Sam passes him the dish of mashed potatoes.
Dean turned and handed the bundle back to his father and left his boyfriend and brother to help Ellen set out all the dishes.
*******“You’re sweet but shut up and let me finish. So I’m sure your familiar with the basics of BDSM?” Castiel nodded. “Right, so when something don’t feel right or a line is crossed anyone is able to use a safe word. When filming those kinds of scenes we go over safe words and boundaries, the whole nine to make sure everything is consensual and taken of.” He paused. “I’m down for a lot of things including some swats on the ass. I was very specific about not hitting my face or hands around my neck. Childhood trauma and shit I don’t wanna get into right now. Everyone on set knew my boundaries, including that asshole. My role was supposed to be a bratty sub and receiving punishment. He completely ignored all of that and even when I safe worded he ignored me.”
“What would you do if I fucked you slow and hard right now? Would you completely lose yourself for me?”
He followed Dean’s instructions, the experience downright exploded as it got impossibly better. His hands grasped at Dean’s hips so he could match his rhythm to his. The noises that came out of Dean were flat out obscene, but they sounded like lustful music to Castiel’s ears. His body picked up the pace on its own in search of the inevitable release. Gripping Dean’s hips harder he pushed up into him with all his efforts, until Dean was basically bouncing on top of him.
“No brother, that’s not a story I can tell you. Matter of fact, don’t even mention it to him. I’m just saying he’d really appreciate you being there.”
“Are you smiling?” were the first words out of his brother’s mouth as he opened his front door for him.
Cas: Charlie has a place in mind. She won’t tell me where though. She’s well acquainted with a few club owners.
“I told you my program would work. There were some talks online and some journals posted of people outside our little club. We aren’t the only ones looking for it, but we’re the only ones with a person of my talents.” She snickered.
He dragged himself out of bed careful not to wake the baby and took a quick shower. He toweled off and grabbed some old jeans and a t shirt. He was working with Bobby today like he promised. Once he was finished getting dressed he noticed the little guy was awake and getting fussy.
“I don’t think I would be a very good parent Charlie. I don’t know the first thing about babies. What to do. What not to do. “
Castiel chuckled at the sight in front of him. There was a giant bowl of popcorn in the middle of Dean’s coffee table and two large mugs filled to the brim with hot chocolate. Dean wasn’t kidding when he said he just wanted to cuddle and be warm with Castiel. Once they were seated Dean tossed a large fuzzy, black blanket across both their shoulders and cuddled next to his boyfriend. He let the movie play as Cas grasped one of his hands and intertwined their fingers together. He felt all of his walls slowly crumbling as time went on. He was content he could spend time with someone else like this, just basking in each other’s warmth with no hidden motives.
sooooo you get two chapters this week!!! Life got the best of me and I'm so sorry for not posting!!!! No warnings for this chapter but there may be for the next and you guys know i'll post accordingly!! Either way I hope you enjoy this! happy reading! xoxo
“John you need to calm the hell down!” Bobby turned them so John was farther from Dean and pushed him away from him. John stumbled a bit off this, bracing himself on a wooden chair that sat in the middle of the floor, it had long been vacated by whoever was sitting there.
At least they had that in common. Castiel was done for as soon as he’d heard the man’s voice. To see all that naked skin in 3-d just for him had been amazing. He was truly gorgeous and just exuded this aura of other worldliness that Castiel was hopeless against. From the first video he’d brought of Dean’s he was done for.
Things continued to get more and more out of control. Mark called him by the endearment every time he wanted his attention and Castiel had no other choice but to answer to it. Poor Dean blushed more times than he could count, and Sam laughed harder than he’d ever seen him do.
The man was going insane on his entrance at this point, fingers moving at a quick pace and going quite deep within him. Half bent over at this point, and he was still moving with such an intensity it was insane. Castiel was almost mad himself with pleasure. Mind blank except for whatever Dean was doing. He couldn’t even recall the last time he blinked.
Gosh it’s like he grows five inches every time he sees him. This was a surprise he wasn’t expecting from 100 miles but he was glad to see that floppy head of hair. Time had gotten away from him, the younger man must’ve been on summer vacation from school now. With all the new shoots lined up and getting wrapped up in Cas he hadn’t even noticed that Sam’s trip home was so close.
Dean lifted him up by his ass and sat him on the desk. He parted his legs and he kneeled on the floor looking up at Castiel the whole time. Dean wrapped a hand around his hard arousal and stroked him a few times before wrapping his lips around it. Sure Dean had done this countless times to several individuals, but it was never like this. He never enjoyed it like he did with Cas. All the little whimpers he made, the gasps that left his lips as Dean picked up the speed. The way he leaned back on the deck and tossed his head back as Dean rubbed circles in his thigh. The filthy moans that rang out when Dean took him all the way to the back of his throat. Past partners always came undone when Dean did this, but no one fell apart as beautifully as Castiel did. His fingers carded through Dean’s hair as he moaned his name like a promise. He began to tug letting Dean know he was close, and when the time came for Cas to crash and burn Dean took every drop and swallowed it down like water.
Dean suddenly grabbed him by the wrist and pretty much dragged him away from the shop, with the sound of Jo’s laughter sounding off behind them. Castiel was amused by the exchange more than anything and went along with Dean’s sad excuse for an escape plan. He couldn’t hear what he said with his angry mumbling, but it caused him to laugh a little. Once he deemed them far away from the shop, he stopped tugging, but he didn’t let go of his hand until they reached a little ice cream stand. It was painted red and made to look like a mini barn. Moo Shack was in full swing. There were at least 15 people waiting around for their cold treat. Dean led him over to a picnic table in that same shade of red.
“Charlie.” He rolled his eyes and sighed between chews of his bagel. “Dean and I are way more complicated than what you have going on. Dorothy isn’t your professor in a class you didn’t want to take in the first place.”
Dean frowned at this and knew exactly what the small, smirking man wanted to talk about. Dean had been around his fair share of big brothers to see a threatening conversation from a mile away. Cas quickly came out of the house, but rolled his eyes as he watched Gabe take his boyfriend away from him.
“Dammit.” Dean flinched at the sound of a knock at his front door. “Sammy and his damn giant hands!”
Castiel was a moron, the king of idiots if you will. Somehow, he’s not to clear on exactly how since he’s been wearing rose colored glasses since the moment Dean walked into the room, but the man was now in his apartment. He was sitting on his secondhand couch, drinking his beer, waiting for Chinese food to arrive that he paid for. Back against the cushion behind him, bowlegs spread wide, just as comfortable as if he was sitting on a friends couch. They were not friends, coworkers at best, and Castiel was simply lost on what to do here. After making sure Dean was fine, because he wasn’t totally hopeless as a host, he’d gone to his room under the guise of getting his laptop so that he could calm the hell down. It was a hard task, but he couldn’t just leave the man sitting out there by himself, he wouldn’t have time for another excuse.
Castiel was hard and aching from the man below him. He subtly thrusted at the mattress below him. From his position he couldn’t do much since his shins were hanging off of the bed. It was enough to ease the tension, but definitely left him wanting more. He wanted to drape his entire body over Dean’s, moving around him and inside him, feeling nothing but smooth warm skin, but he wanted to see this thing through. They always had a next time.
Once he got his footing situated the 4 of them made their way out of the bar. Dean and Sam said their good bye’s and marched out behind Charlie.
This was the first thing that he reacted to since the bag had been taken off, moving his head away from Dick’s hand and tossing an icy glare his way. He turned his head and looked at Kevin with pleading eyes. Kevin didn’t know what to do. He knew Castiel didn’t deserve any of this, no one did. He had no clue that they had even been together at one point, all of this information was confusing his usually quick mind. He wanted to help the poor man, but Dick Roman wasn’t one you betrayed. He’d heard things, rumors of Dick’s violent nature. He was the guy who got what he wanted then he wanted it and wasn’t to be defied. But Kevin was a good person, he prided himself on that. He wanted to help people and this was a great opportunity to do just that. He needed to go about this carefully and quietly though. The last thing he wanted was to be on Roman’s shit list.
He hesitated for a few moments before answering. “Not to be rude Sam, but why haven’t you asked Dean this?”

He scratched at his neck then placed his hand on either side of the sink looking at his reflection. His eyes were still red. His lower lids a bit puffy. He ran some water and splashed it on his face. Grabbing a paper towel to wipe down with, he mustered some courage to go back to the office before Cas wonders if he scared Dean off.
Dinner was lovely as usual. Castiel had picked the place for them to eat. They went to a small diner just outside of town. He chose this particular place because he knew Dean would like it. He knew his boyfriend wasn’t one for all the fanciness of places he was used to and to be honest he just wanted a peaceful night out that didn’t require formal attire and wondering if you’re making a good appearance to a bunch of strangers. He also knew this wasn’t the kind of place that Dick would ever step foot in, he was a narcissist who needed constant attention and validation even though he acted like he didn’t need either of those things. He was glad to put all manners aside and just enjoy a nice dinner with one of his favorite people. Again he felt the weight of the simplicity, it swelled within him and took root like he’d never seen before. Dean was full of laughter and quirky, lewd conversation. And forget it when the waitress brought them a freshly baked apple pie, Dean was truly childlike then. After the constant dark clouds that loomed over him over the past few weeks he was more than happy to treat the man to a  night that cause no consequence.
“So I knew you guys were going out for Valentine’s Day, Castiel told me, congrats by the way.” He fumbled with his phone. “I didn’t think anything of it since I trust you and I know you’re safe with him. Then at 2 in the morning I received a picture. It was from a blocked number.”
The instructions had been for him to get close. He’d done that of course, but because of who he was he’d gone the extra mile and got feelings for the guy. Sam had poked fun, reminding Dean of his habit of taking every assignment so seriously. ‘At least this time you’re having fun with it’, his brother had teased. See he wasn’t one for serious relationships. The two times he’d tried had been with women who weren’t in the life, and his other with a hunter man who turned out to be a damn wild card. His track record was soiled, and it’d he his luck he’d eventually fall for someone in his charge. The only one who knows how deep the rabbit hole goes is Sam. After all the brotherly banter, he’d been quite supportive and happy for Dean.
Once he was dismissed from work, he headed back to the Inn, excited about the book he brought before leaving work. His plans were to curl up with a cup of tea and enjoy a night in. Walking back to the Inn he’d recalled the event of this morning. Seeing Dean standing there in all his brightness was shocking, so glad he’d managed to not make a complete fool of himself. It was when he walked in the door and saw Mary’s smiling face that he remembered that he’d been invited to dinner at her home.
Maybe he did break a few traffic laws but he shaved a good 10 minutes off his route thanks to his gps and its random side routes. He burst into his apartment breathing heavy due to him running up the stairs. Whipping his phone out of his pocket he saw that he had a few more texts from Dean. Needing to first set the mood, he sat it on his night stand. He took his lube out of the draw and removed his dress pants, thoughts of the thumbnail alone had him half hard for the last 2 hours. Once his shirt was removed he was ready.
“Yeah I know. I already told her and she threatened to rain down unholy terror on me. Whatever the hell that means.” He laughed. “You know I’m gonna have to give Cas the talk now right?” Sam’s tone went from joyful to insanely serious.
“Honestly I had no idea what to write and then I thought about what you said and it all clicked into place. So far it’s going well.”
At the market, he found all the things he’d need, including a cute mug with little bumblebees on it to use for his tea and coffee. Some small microwavable dinners and small frozen pizzas were probably the bulk of his diet. While not the healthiest it was the most affordable. He made a point to try and offset that with some fruits and packaged salads that would keep for a week. Plus his random walks he’d take when he wasn’t working. It would only benefit him to know where he was, and where he shouldn’t go. He’d kept his purchases light, nothing more than what could fit in his duffel should he have to flee at a moment’s notice.
Taking a glance at Dean once he finished his tale, he found the man to be highly upset. His hands gripped the steering wheel far tighter than was necessary for someone of his driving skill, he had that dangerous look in his eyes again.
Once they were in and settled he silently watched her set up her laptop and all her other techy things.
“Leaving?” He leaned in, dropping his voice to a whisper. “He didn’t change his mind, did he? Because if he did, we—”
, but before he could find the words in his lust-addled mind, Dean was leading the head of his cock to his entrance and bearing down.
Castiel remained silent for a few beats too long, and Dean pulled back with pink cheeks. A frown wormed its way onto Cas’s face, and he could only stare at Dean in confusion. “The Angel of Thursday?”
Balthazar had begun to wonder the same thing. If Metatron knew the part Castiel played in keeping the demons at bay, and
Dean gulped nervously as he pulled the last burger off of the grill. Five in total. Two for him, two for Cas, and one for Claire. He spent a little too much time staring at the beef and imagining having a sixth burger patty on that plate. One for another child, maybe two or three years old. One who could play with Claire, and learn from their big sister. A boy maybe. Cas could dress him up in a sweater vest and take him to his class. The students would love that. Dean could put him in a Led Zeppelin t-shirt and hold him on one hip while they changed Baby’s spark plugs together.
“Cas I gotta pee.” He attempted to whisper but it was quite obvious he had failed by the snickers from the women at the table.
Castiel got up from his chair and helped Dean to the restroom. It took some time to even find it, and when they did he wasn’t surprised that this room was just as expensive looking as the rest of the place. Both of the men did their business, Dean finishing first, and just as Castiel was straightening his pants he was accosted by the man wrapping his arms around him and hooking his head over his shoulder.
He lined himself up, with Castiel’s dick in hand and slowly began sinking down. His expression was twisted in pleasure, his eyes screwed shut, and his mouth hanging open on a silent scream. Once he sunk all the way down Castiel was sure he could die happily in this moment. The tight heat of it all was overwhelming. Dean leaned back, a hand on each of Castiel’s shins before he started rising slowly only to sink back down quickly. A gasp was punched out of Castiel. He didn’t think being inside of another person could feel so good. After that initial thrust Dean kept up a slow and quick pattern as Castiel just laid down enjoying the ride.
Their lips touched and it wasn’t the normal heat and lust dripping interaction that it’d been previously. This kiss contained feelings, pure and intentional. Dean felt he was really taken with this guy. He was truthful when he said he was both the monogamous type and the casual type. The latter had been his game for the last several years after he and Lisa broke it off. The fire wasn’t there between them, and it hadn’t been for a long time, but there was a flicker of one here.
“We are not friends. Not even close!” he turned to stomp away. “Dick let me go!” he tore his arm away from the hand that grabbed him.
He had his game face on as they made their way to Sam’s truck. He kept his features neutral, showing no emotion even though his insides were screaming. He owed it not to his father, but to his self to do this. He would face the man that instilled such awful fear inside him. The man who did all the wrong things for the right reasons. The man who battered even the most basic things within Dean. The way Cas owned his truth that night struck a thick cord within Dean. This was the first step in a true recovery that Dean felt was long overdue.
