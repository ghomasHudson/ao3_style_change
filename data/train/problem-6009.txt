The only other people privy to the situation: Nicholas Fury, Maria Hill, and Jet Black— the woman who had come out of the subway with Steve. They’d found her a few blocks away from his collapsed body and took her in cuffs to a cell deep in the Hub. She didn’t put up a fight, which was unnerving. Silent, she sat in the interrogation room without moving, staring at the one-way glass as though she could see through it. Tony had been down to stare at her a few times.
Steve said inside his own head, not allowing himself to fully indulge the fantasy by speaking aloud to his
Tony slowly started moving again, throwing a tie haphazardly around his neck and stomping on his suitcase to zip it up. He pat his pockets, looking for his wallet. "Okay," he said. "I'll try."
"I understand just fine," he said coldly. He was frozen to the spot. He couldn't decide what to do and his chest felt too tight to even breathe. Half of him needed to book it as far away as possible and hide somewhere dark until the urge to hyperventilate passed. Through that portal was his family grave plot-- woman and boy, one spot left for father. But it was also a world he'd loved and left behind. A life he'd left behind. He could run through the portal faster than Tony could stop him. They may never find him again and the thought tantalized him.
Using samples of unknown metals found in Captain Rogers’ chest wound, attempting to identify substance and properties with the objective of building a device capable of locating the dimension of the substance’s origin by honing in on its structure.
The back of his throat was dry when he opened his eyes. It was raining outside, droplets splattering angrily against the window which remained airtight. He couldn’t tell the directions of the suns because the clouds were so thick.
“Maybe it’s for the best, then,” the child said in his head, “Did you ever consider whether I’d even be happy in a city?”
Bruce came out and attempted to flatten a crumpled dollar bill, jamming it into the slot on the machine. It hissed and spat the thing back out at him.
Steve did not answer. He stared out the window past her head. It was midmorning and cold sunlight illuminated the dust swirling between them. Her practice was housed in an ancient brownstone, furnished with polished mahogany and brass fixtures and uncomfortable leather chairs, floorboards that creaked beneath patterned rugs when you walked across them. It was as foreign to Steve as the desert would be to a fish. After spending over a decade in the other dimension, Earth was unfamiliar and he still wasn’t used to occupying civilized space.
In the end, his fear over overstepping a boundary and making Steve feel uncomfortable won out over his worry, and he showed Steve again where to find clean towels and then left him alone.
“I don’t think it is,” she said, “But I’d like to hear why you think that. What makes your grief exceptional? This is a fine place to start.”
He struggled with the key in the lock because it had been so long since anyone had stayed here. When the door swung open they dropped their bags on the hardwood floor and switched the lights on. It was a sprawling farm house with two stories and a wrap-around porch. Steve was surprised to see that it looked larger on the outside than it felt inside. Finished all in exposed wood, it felt rustic and quaint— not at all like the modern architecture of the Avengers tower an the industrialism of New York.
” Tony said, holding out his phone to show Steve a picture of a house in the woods. “Have you ever been to wine country?”
“No one could fault you, Steve. No one thinks clearly after—” He paused. A loss? Sharon was gone but it was more than that. “After what you’ve gone through. It was stupid for Fury to let you run off like that without checking in. Listen, you should come stay with me. Until you get yourself right, and get a new place. You can stay as long as you want in your space in the tower.”
Tony looked relieved and made dinner. He made fried egg sandwiches with no cheese that they ate on the coffee table. Tony dipped his in ketchup. He turned on the TV and flicked through channels. He let Steve pick what to watch. Steve didn’t miss TV, but now he was glad for the distraction and empty noise it provided. They left their dirty plates on the coffee table and watched baseball on the couch.
“You have a lot to be sad about,” Tony murmured, “I wish you didn’t have to go through what you went through.”
“I’m not,” Bruce reassured, “Trust me. It’s Steve Rogers. If there is any possible way we can help him, we will. He’s priority number one.”
He waited until Tony checks on him for the last time, feigning the even breathing of slumber. Then he slipped down the elevator and reacquainted himself with the streets of his first jungle, like a tourist.
Bruce was gentler. “Tony, take a step back. Did you go through decontamination on your way in?” It seemed he could guess the answer; in Tony’s panicked outrage it seemed unlikely that he would take the time to go through the necessary procedures, and given that this was a complete question mark, they were taking all precautions.
Steve smiled, but it was thin and transparent. It was obvious that he had no intention of calling on Tony unless it was absolutely necessary.
“I thought you said Earth was safer than home. What kind of world is it where you can’t even look at the sun?”
"'Mother' and 'Bastard,'" Steve said. "They had a mythology surrounding the celestial bodies, just like humans."
Tony spent all his time hunched over a work bench with his soldering iron and a tool box, working on the device that had begun to take shape over the course of weeks. Steve didn't know what it was and never thought to ask. It wasn't a weapon-- he might not be the most tech savvy but he wasn't the luddite people like to believe he was, especially when it came to high-tech weaponry. But because it wasn't a weapon, he didn't take much of an interest. He didn't think to be suspicious.
“I’m sorry,” Steve said, sounding miserable. He leaned on the wall, and then leaned on Tony, who brought him to the kitchen and sat him at the island. Steve’s face was flushed and his eyes were red, showing that he’d been crying.
TS: Good, thank you. The good news is, this is going to work. If that virus is really one of a kind, I can use the DNA as a marker to isolate the specific universe it came from. [Pause] The bad news is that I’m going to have to figure out what the hell this virus was doing in Steve and if it did permanent damage.
“I was worried about her. I wanted her to let go of her past and live in the present. She went through an enormous trauma. I encouraged her to talk to me about it, or anyone. But she isn’t a big talker. She pointed out the hypocrisy,” Steve explained in a hollow voice, staring into his milkshake like he was dreaming. “She had a point. Me, living in my shrine to the past. And all that feels so far away, now.”
TS: Alright. So we’re going to acquisition every bit of this stuff SHIELD has, read their research, become an expert in virology overnight, and then just fill in the gaps. Easy. Okay.
Steve didn't move. "It's what you've been keeping from me," he corrected Tony, whose mouth twitched into a frown.
Tony arrived at the scene after the firefighters already quashed the flames. It was good luck that it rained because the blaze could have taken out half the block in this crowdeed neighborhood Steve insisted on renting in. The fire trucks’ lights flashed red, parked all up the block where tenants of neighboring buildings stood in the streets in their nightclothes. Pedestrians gawked and slowed as as they passed by; nobody had put up police tape yet, and a crowd had gathered to brave the weather and stare.
Even with Bruce’s expertise, they were at a loss when it came to the serum. Blood tests showed the serum was still present, thank god, his DNA remained identical to past samples— he was still a super soldier. Yet, it seemed that the effects of his enhancement were somehow impaired. Slowed. Weakened. Above the average man, but definitely not up to par. This deeply troubled Bruce, but aside from noting it in his report, he made no mention of it— least of all to Tony Stark, who had taken it upon himself to haunt the halls like a stray cat, pacing uselessly, while they worked.
Tony thought he was being subtle, Steve imagined. At the end of every corridor he was there, a specter with apologetic shoulders and watchful eyes. At the turn of the hour, nearly every hour, Are you alright? Let’s have a bite to eat. Have you had a shower?
Jet visited, sometimes. She and Steve liked to talk privately, though; Tony was never invited. Steve and Jet reminisced about Dimension Z; the twin suns. The crystal waters. Ghost eels and spider wolves and even the less savory things: he sand monsters. The sand storms. The mutates.
“Do you want me to come in with you?” Like a mother on the first day of school. Steve couldn’t help but smile at that.
(Sharon appeared to save Steve at the very last moment; Ian was brainwashed by Zola. He was going to kill Steve. He was on him with a weapon, Steve was bleeding profusely but he had finally gotten through to Ian-- he had reached his son and things were about to turn around. Steve could see it in his eyes. A father knows. But she hadn't known. She had seen Steve with an enemy holding a gun to his head and she fired without asking questions. She killed his son and then died not an hour later and that was too heavy to unpack.)
Tony hovered, always hovering. Steve wanted to touch him, sometimes. The complicated memory of Sharon hung over him, a cloud of guilt. He loved her, but his love was tainted by the circumstances of her death.
“Thank you.” He crossed the room and resumed his position. She picked up her notepad, pen poised above paper.
“That isn’t possible,” Steve said, expression becoming unreadable. Tony felt out of the loop and sat up leaning back on his elbow, body aching.
And the greater mystery still was how Captain Rogers changes so inexplicably in the short period of time.
Tony cut in, feeling defensive. Was no one concerned with Steve’s mental state? Was it not screamingly obvious that Steve was more than just a bit rattled? They’d all had their own share of traumatic experiences working for SHIELD and the Avengers, but could they not see that something had penetrated Steve's defenses and wounded him at his core? Twelve years wasn’t something Tony could even comprehend. No wonder Steve kept looking around like he didn’t recognize any of them. The gravity of such an experience was impossible to grasp from their perspective.
SHIELD had proven that they would not look after Steve the way he needed, so Tony would do the job and he’d do it with joy. He would not ask for anything from Steve. He would just be there for him and be happy to have the chance.
By the time he returned to the tower, the sky was grey with light. He slipped into bed, leaving the flier folded up
“It’s fine, Steve. It’s okay,” he gasped. He gazed up at Jet, eyes wide with sincerity. “It’s a machine that opens portals between dimensions. I was trying to find a way to find the dimension you came from. For scientific study, that's it. The machine, it doesn’t make anything or put out a signal. It tracks 'signatures'-- in this case, I used particles that came over to Earth with Steve. It just opens the barrier between worlds.”
When his back hit the mattress, something heavy tumbled out of the pocket and bounced across the floor. Tony sat up, puzzled. On his hands and knees, he crawled around until he found it under the dresser. Cool and round in his hand, surprisingly heavy for is size, it was the pocket watch Tony had never given Steve. By now, it was far too late to give as a birthday gift and Tony had convinced himself the premise was stupid, anyways. He laid back in bed, kicking his pants off and holding it in his palm.
“Mhm. As far as you can see. It was a passion project but I got distracted, never really spent much time here,” Tony said. Something about the expansiveness of the landscape reminded Steve of the best parts of Dimension Z. The Phrox were farming people, and some of the happiest days of his life had been spent picking crops with his son under the suns.
“Are you hurt? Does this hurt? There’s a medic over there. Come on, I want them to look at you. I think you must’ve inhaled smoke.”
his face clumsily in Tony’s shirt. The weight of him almost knocked them both off the bar stools they were seated in. Tony grunted and caught them both, wrapping his arms around Steve and righting them.
“Oh. Hey,” Steve said. Hey avoided eye contact. Tony closed his book without marking the place and pushed the glasses up onto his forehead.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Tony said. Steve saw a barely there smile on his lips as he put bread in the toaster, though. He opened the fridge and said, “We’ve got orange juice or apple juice.”
Tony could kiss him. But Steve was drunk and grieving and broken. It would be taking advantage and on some level, they both knew it. He wondered if Steve wanted that. If that was why he was coming so close— too guilty of his loss of Sharon to initiate anything, but craving touch comfort.
“I’d name it The Eye,” Ian said, sitting cross-legged on the bed. “Because it’s so small and white. Like it’s staring all the time. In the pictures you painted, it always looked more yellow.”
“It’s scaring me.” The admission came quietly and then Tony collected himself. “I’m sorry. It isn’t about me.”
And he wanted to ask him what he was thinking every time Steve did something strange, but he knew better. His only choices were to watch helplessly, or to find some way to help. Tony preferred action.
“Nothing to be sorry for. Or embarrassed. You never have to be embarrassed around me, you know. Not after all the times you’ve seen me at my lowest,” he said. Steve’s face was twisted in misery, as though he would never recover from this.
Steve could scream. No, I’m not feeling alright. You don’t understand and you never will. I hope you never do.
shiny new uniform and sent him on his way,” Tony said, jaw tight, barely containing his frustration. “And you know Steve. He won’t submit to something like that voluntarily. He’s always fine, until he isn’t.”
doing everything we can. SHIELD is throwing a lot of money on this, and at least he’s stable. The technology is good, Tony. It’s doing its job. Right now things don’t look pretty, but he’s strong. If anyone could survive injuries like this, it’s Cap.”
Tony brought him home. Steve was deflated like a popped balloon, silent the whole ride there. Privately, Tony was overwhelmed with relief at having Steve under his roof again. It felt sick to celebrate any aspect of this situation— Sharon was dead, and Steve was unwell and not looking to make time with any one else right now. It felt good, anyways. It felt right.
Haggard, bleeding, wearing tatters of his former uniform, footage shows the woman assisting Captain Rogers walk.
Second mistake. It was the perfect recipe for a total meltdown but Steve’s own good reputation damned him. He had a track record of having generally stable mental health and sound decision-making; no one believed Tony that he was just a bomb waiting to detonate, and that giving him Jet and letting him go was potentially triggering enough to light the fuse.
“I carried all of it up to the roof and set it ablaze. It was a way to say goodbye to the past, I guess. It felt… necessary. I thought the rain would keep the flames under control. I guess I wasn’t thinking clearly. I feel foolish. I’m so glad nobody was hurt.” He ran a hand through his hair and then looked mildly startled when it was cropped short. He must have not cut it for a long time.
Steve sat up, clutching the sheet to his waist and frowning. He mouthed, "What is it?" Tony's eyes flickered and then he shook his head and slid out of the sheets, padding barefoot across the floor to the bathroom and disappearing behind a closed door. He emerged a few minutes later and went to the closet.
He did. He wanted to tell his story. To speak it into existence, because for now, it resided in a nebulous unreality. He was the only witness and his memory was really the only record. That scared him. The sooner he got it out of himself, the sooner it wouldn’t have to live there any longer.
Tony looked like he was just waiting for Steve to ask. “Today? Tour of the vineyard. You’ll get to taste the grapes. I’ll show you the distillery. Then, if you’re up for it, there’s a picnic spot up the mountain a bit. We can hike, but I’m told it’s better on horseback.”
TS: Show me. [Pause] Uh, huh. Hm. That’s sure a virus. That’s a weird looking bugger, isn’t it? Enlarge… there. Thank you. Hm. [Pause] Run this against all known viruses in SHIELD’s database, save anything that matches up to ninety percent.
previously undiscovered Bermuda triangle, in a well-trafficked Brooklyn subway station? And where was Sharon?
“Shit,” Steve said under his breath. “Sorry. I didn’t think you’d be up. Was just gonna slip back in and go t’bed.”
As quick as that, Tony recovered. “We’ll see about that, won’t we?” He said as if it was a challenge to exhaust Steve with newly-wed activities.
"I'm going to try and get better," Steve said when he came down for breakfast, the morning after. "There are people who would have wanted me to."
“I didn’t think you could even get— hey, it’s okay. You’re fine. Let’s just get a glass of water in you, first.” Tony shelved his book and walked Steve to the kitchen.
Steve picked the cherry out of his cup and put it in his mouth. He sucked on it until it turned to pulp on his tongue.
“There’s the matter of the girl,” Fury said. “She calls herself a Zola. But you claim that she’s your ally?”
“Not really. I’m just sad.” It was the most Steve had said directly. He set the water glass down and rested his elbows on the table. He held his chin in his hands.
He’d had Steve’s room professionally cleaned overnight while Steve was knocked out on the couch. He’d guiltily crept around checking for potentially triggering objects like a minesweeper. A framed photograph of Sharon gave Tony pause. In the end, he left it, not wanting to move Steve’s things without permission.
Internally, Tony sagged with relief. “No need to thank me. I’m just happy to have you under my roof again. Do you remember how to work the shower?”
“—Got it. Got it.” Sam paused, dumping sugar into his coffee and swirling it around with a spoon. “And now he just wants to get right back to work like nothing happened.”
Satisfied with his own assessment of the situation and the results of the debriefing, Fury not only let Steve go, but sent him off alone with Jet. Go home, go back to normal. Everything is fine.
“I hope pizza’s okay,” Tony said. The hot cardboard box scalded his hands and he placed it on the table at the foot of Steve’s bed, relieved to see Steve alive and well, shirtless with damp hair with a sketchbook open, facedown, on then desk in the corner.
The store clerk wandered close to the window, scrutinizing Steve through thick glasses with a frown. He turned the lock inside the door and flipped the sign off, so the buzzing stopped. Closed. The man glared until Steve kept walking. He must look like a bum.
“If you don’t talk to me, I can’t help you,” she said, not for the first time. This was the fourth session, and Steve was as closed-off now as he had been during their first appointment.
Steve’s skin felt cold. The presence of his son vanished when a knock came at the door. Steve was startled, but didn't move.
He closed him palm around the round body of the watch. The metal was cool in his fist. He leaned against the featureless wall beside a vending machine and shut his eyes. Over the past few hours, he’d developed a blinding headache from the fluorescent bulbs that lit the windowless halls.
“I appreciate that, I believe that. In most cases, I’m sure that’s true. But this is different. I’m sorry. You wouldn’t understand.”
It was hope dressed up as logic. Captain America had that effect on people. Even the most rational scientific minds and the hardest hearts softened in admiration of his legacy, but it was an open secret among the Avengers and associates that Tony Stark’s personal feelings toward the Captain were more than your standard hero worship.
The work was frustrating. He couldn't talk about it with Steve and SHIELD only begrudgingly cooperated with him when he needed records from their labs. Fury laughed in Tony's face when he showed up with a box at the labs and announced he was here to collect their samples. It took a lot of paperwork and arguing to finally have what he needed shipped over to his Tower. The thing was, Tony had worked on projects for SHIELD in the past and he was all too well aware that they were comfortable cutting corners when it came to due process and bending the rules when they felt that it was justified. They were being a pain in his ass on purpose. If it wasn't this-- if it wasn't a project that would prove to be meaningful to Steve-- Tony probably would have told them just where to shove it by now, accompanied with a rude gesture.
"No one," Tony said. He threw a balled up pair of underwear at Steve, "Get dressed, the plane leaves in an hour." Steve didn't try to catch the flying undergarments so they landed on the floor a few feet short of the bed in a pile.
“Sorry. I know it’s confusing,” Tony said, putting a pitcher of milk and a tureen of sugar on the table, “The portal collapsed just after Steve made it through. Sharon collapsed it, to prevent Zola from—”
It was obviously a joke, but Steve felt a twinge of regret when Tony’s expression flickered. Then Steve wondered how Tony had this all planned and out together so quickly. What if it had been, at one point in the planning stages, a honeymoon? Steve didn’t flatter himself to think that Tony would have ever proposed to him, but Tony constantly surprised him.
Steve decided to kill himself and she made his bed with military corners and the snuck up to the roof at four in the morning on a hot night. He stood there for a long time looking at the sky. He stepped onto the edge and swayed in the breeze, a sneeze away from death. For the first time, his mind was totally quiet.
He finally stopped and Steve felt his stomach churn. It was clear what Tony was afraid of. The implication touched a bare nerve and he couldn’t speak. Blood rushed in his ears and he picked at a hang nail. Finally, he said, “Nothing’s going to happen. But I don’t mind you staying up, if it makes you feel better.”
“No, I’ll be with Sam,” Steve found himself saying without thinking, a lie which could easily be found out. He knew that Tony had gotten into the habit of touching base with Steve’s friends to check in on him. He wasn’t as subtle as he wished, but Steve appreciated the kindness and it was easier to pretend not to know.
Tony didn't recognize the language, but it rolled off Steve's tongue. Tony came to sit beside him on the bed, hoping to subtly encourage more talking-- for his own curiosity, or Steve's own good, he was not entirely sure.
“I really think he should talk to someone. Has anyone offered to set him up with a therapist or a grief counselor or something? I’d be happy to find someone through the VA, if it’s any help. Hell, I feel like I have to talk to someone myself after hearing about what happened to Sharon.”
On Earth, no time was lost— this threw him off. Internally, he divides his life into thirds: before and during the war, after the ice, and then Dimension Z. The world doesn’t operate on the same calendar.
“Jet! Stop this!” Steve said, lurching toward them in a defensive position. She didn't attack him, and he didn't attack her. Tony heard a loud ringing in his ears and then felt blinding pain as he hit the concrete lab wall when she threw him into it. The world spun and he tasted metal.
“I’m glad you did. Gave me time to get a head start. Eat up, I’ve got lots planned for today.” As Steve sat down at the kitchen island, Tony slid a pile of fried eggs onto a plate and put it in front of him. “Toast? Fruit? Want some coffee?”
She towered over him and hissed, “What unnatural thing have you done? How have you cloned his life signature, Stark? How does your machine make me feel this way?”
“Good, this giant hole in his chest isn’t as bad as it looks. Bio-circuitry everywhere— needs the synaptic welders to close it off cleanly.”
“Mmhm.” Tony was antsy to let him rest. He seemed so tired. “Give or take. It was hard to measure time. The stars were— it was all strange. Things moved differently.”
It didn’t take much to deceive him. Tony knew Steve well, so Steve knew just how to act to make him believe what he wanted to.
“Sorry. I didn’t want to wake you coming back in. I was just, doing stuff. ‘M just going to get to bed.”
“I’m trying to understand. I can see that you’re in pain,” she prompted, “You’ve experienced a trauma. Would it help you to know that studies show that talking through a traumatic experience reduces the risk and severity of post traumatic stress symptoms?”
“What even is a pawn shop?” the child said. Steve stuffed his hands into his pockets and watched his feet while he hiked up a hill. He shadow grew before him, a streetlight to his back. He was getting further and further from the heart of the city, from home, and the neighborhood was quieter out here. The scream of sirens in the distance was ubiquitous, but he was the only person on this side street and half the street lamps were dead. The stores out here weren’t open past eleven, and half the houses had dark windows and weeds in the tiny yards.
“Does he have any secret birth marks or weird moles down there you could use to identify him, Stark?” Hank joked. Somehow, Tony managed to glower through the Iron Man faceplate.
"Shut it down for the night," he said to the computer, and the lights went out one by one until the lab was lit just in the blue glow of sleeping machines. He grabbed a jacket off the back of a chair that he'd left there at some previous work-binge. He wore it around his shoulders like a robe as he left the lab and took the elevator to his room, collapsing on the bed with a deep sigh.
"Okay," Steve said. He didn't feel relieved. He felt miserable. His skin broke out in goosebumps when a gust of cool air blew in through the open window, ruffling the curtains. He sat back on the bed. Tony stepped between his legs with his suitcase in hand and leaned down to peck Steve on the lips. "I'm really sorry. I hate to leave. Will you be okay here without me? You can call me. Or your doctor, or Sam or anyone, if you start feeling bad again."
Sam came over on Tony’s invitation and visits Steve. Tony explained the situation but Sam didn't truly get it until after he and Steve went out together in their uniforms to run off some steam.
“Mm,” Steve made an affirming noise, biting into his pizza and chewing absently. He was far away, remembering something, “‘Twin suns,’ the Phrox called them.
Steve’s room had a double bed made up in fresh sheets. There was a walk-in closet stocked with fresh uniforms, gym clothes, formal wear, sleep wear, and jeans. Tony stood anxiously just inside the doorway as Steve wandered through the room, drifting from place to place, touching the bed. Looking inside the closet. Trying to open a window.
When he got home, Tony lingered. “I was thinking maybe we could do Chinese tonight? I’ve been meaning to try the place on the corner, the pork wonton soup has rave reviews.”
Steve dropped his jacket on the floor and went to the window and opened it wide. Earth food was an adjustment, too. In the early years, eating had been a constant struggle in the other dimension— finding food, and choking it down. But, under the care of the Phrox, he’d learned which plants were edible, which could be used as seasoning. How to skin and debone a spider wolf properly so not to taint the meat. How to cook burrow squid to perfection. On the Phrox’s farm, he’d grown to love their cuisine. Of course he had missed his favorite Earth foods, but they felt wrong in his mouth, now, like dreaming of eating and waking up chewing on a pillow.
Tony just smiled. He perched himself on the arm of Steve’s chair. “Not to worry. I’ve had my staff go through the house and take the bottles back down to the cellar. All that’s left to drink above ground is sparkling juice. Though, of course, it’s Napa. If you want wine, it can be arranged.”
Tony unzipped his suitcase and started stuffing clothes into it as he got dressed, an uncoordinated dance. He wiggled into a pair of underwear and crumpled up a silk shirt in a way that would make Janet Van Dyne cry to see. He jammed his spare shoes in, loose with the clothing. He put on slacks and a shirt. In his hurry, he skipped a button. It was totally unlike him.
“How was it?” he asked as Steve slid into the passenger seat. He shrugged, waiting for Tony to pull into the street and bring him home. The engine purred. Steve looked at Tony, who smiled sheepishly and said, “Your seatbelt.”
FR: According to SHIELD’s lab reports on their own research on the samples, they ran scans looking for living microorganisms, isolating and ignoring Captain Rogers’ own microbiome, and hey found nothing. This means one of three things: your samples are the only ones containing virus, the virus actually originated on Earth after the sample came back from the other dimension, or that their scans did not pick up on the virus because it is inactive—
“But then again, the last time I got soup in this neighborhood, I got food poisoning. So maybe that’s a sign,” he said, opening Steve’s fridge and taking stock of its meager contents. “I could whip up some… Omelettes? Fried egg sandwich? Oh, no cheese. Remind me to have some groceries sent over. Aren’t you supposed to be putting on weight?”
Then, the smell hit Tony. He wrinkled his nose and the realization came after a delay. His eyes widened. “Are you… drunk?”
For now, though, he wasn't doing anyone any good. He was burnt out. Exhausted and cold, he shivered and saved his work for the night. He had finished studying the samples and moved on to building the machine meant to use the samples as a scent to track down Dimension Z so his workbench was strewn with small parts and tools and bits of wire.
“Got everything you need? How’re you feeling?” he asked. He might have been more anxious than Steve. It was kind but off-putting. He was feeding off of Tony's nervous energy and he was already exhausted.
Steve looked down, shame so palpable that it might as well have been dripping off of him. “Not. Not really.”
Tony made eggs in a cast iron skillet the next morning, awake before Steve. For the first time in a while, he slept like the dead.
Steve explained that he found himself in a hostile other world which followed no predictable laws of physics, inhabited with hordes of monsters and other genetic experiments gone wrong. Steve had escaped the laboratory where he’d been held and survived in the wilderness thanks to the generosity of a people called the Phrox. Zola had hatched a plan to invade Earth, but it was over, now, thwarted by himself and the allies he’d made in the other dimension.
Tony was there for the whole story. After giving a thorough examination and concussion test, the medical technicians were barred from the room. Fury and Hill appeared forgoing sympathy for professional brusqueness. They wanted to know what happened— everyone did, but Tony thought they might be pushing too hard too fast.
He walked until his feet hurt and then he walked further. A neon sign hummed and flickered, as he walked past a pawn shop with stolen watches in the window: DROP YOUR ANTIQUES HERE. A taxi sped through a puddle, spraying rank city water onto the leg of his pants.
, Steve. When her turned on his machine I felt him, his heart beat and his brain waves, his scent and his voice. His signature, like he was alive somewhere in the cosmos. I have not felt it since—”
Tony stirred his milkshake with the straw. “So you burned your apartment down? I’m still missing something, I think.”
They were seated in a corner booth, tucked far away from the few other diners where they had privacy. Steve kept checking over his shoulder as though they were in a jungle.
And Steve was on with Sharon lately, but he and Tony still shared that bond. Amicable and bizarrely close, Hank had a hard time understanding how their relationship worked. Then again, most people did.
Tony drove him every morning and he was overly chipper in the car. He whistled along with the radio and pointed out birds and dogs as they drove past the park. He parked at the curb and the engine idled.
"If they do," Sam said, carefully and emphatically, "We have to look out for Steve. He's the only one who knows what it's like in there. They'll want to use him. I think, at least for now, that's not going to be good. I think that could be--" He searched for the word, "-- Catastrophic, for his recovery. The guy's suffering from some pretty serious PTSD, I'd bet my bird. And SHIELD doesn't give a shit about if it'll trigger him. They just see him as an asset, and I'm worried about that."
“We have to consider every possible explanation for what happened until we have answers,” he said, “One potential explanation being that the real Steve went into that subway and was somehow replaced by an imposter.”
Steve covered his ears with his hands and rolled over. “Stop this,” he murmured to himself. He wrapped his arms around his chest and squeezed as though he could physically hold himself together.
"Nothing," Tony repeated in a strained voice. His expression was surly, like he was annoyed at Steve for making him lie.
Arnim Zola and his underlings had opened a portal to another dimension— Dimension Z, named for its ruler— inside the subway. They’d taken Steve alone in the first subway car, claiming that it was too full to accommodate them both, leaving Sharon waiting to catch the next train across town to the restaurant where the couple had intended to enjoy Steve’s birthday dinner.
“Genetic testing and carbon dating verify your story, Captain. And you were right on with your estimate. About twelve years, give or take. I’m sorry. I can’t imagine going through that,” Hill said.
Tony stood there for a moment with his hands in his pockets. "I'm going to go down to the lab, then. I'll be there, if you need me. Or anything."
"Tell me," Steve demanded. He got to his feet and felt ridiculous, standing there naked with such a serious face. There was a burning feeling in the pit of his stomach like he was going to be sick. He had Tony hadn't fought in so long-- at least in his perception of time-- and it was starting to feel like a fight.
Jet appeared as though summoned. She came in through the open skylight window, silent as a shadow. She dropped to the floor like a spider and she grabbed Tony by the throat before Steve even registered her presence in the lab, or how the hell she got in.
The first few appointments, Steve barely spoke a word. He just locked up. His throat closed. Time passed quicker, he zoned out. The woman was very professional, but it must have frustrated her.
Steve Rogers descended into the subway tunnel on fifty-first street with Sharon Carter around six PM the evening of his birthday according to CCTV footage, confirmed by the timestamp on their subway cards. They wore evening attire.
Jet stared at him without blinking. The portal hummed, a low vibration they could all feel in their bones. She slowly tilted her chin up, tearing her eyes away from Tony's feeble form to look into the portal. She closed her eyes and reached out with her omni-sense, which Tony could only assume was some kind of enhanced awareness. Her eyes flew open, reflecting the cool light emanating from the portal.
"Don't thank me yet," Bruce said, "You can't have them until Fury's done with them, and he's probably going to give you a shit list of conditions. I'd say it's worth it, given the circumstances, but I'm sure he'll find some way to make it hurt."
And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king. And the king, divide the living child in two, and give half to one, and half to the other.
His journal lived in a locked drawer, with the photograph of Sharon which he couldn’t stand to look at yet, and a sketchbook he’d taken to drawing in since coming back. From memory he tried to draw more of Ian, from every angle, from every scene, while it was all still fresh enough. The terror of losing him again to time and age scared Steve terribly in the first few weeks.
She put her foot on his shin and applied enough force to make a promising threat to break his tibia. “Tell me what that machine does. And do not try to lie to me. My omni-sense misses nothing. I can hear your heart. I can smell your fear. I can sense the signature of every life, like a scent, and I’ll never forget yours. If you lie to me, I will hunt you to the ends of the universe and you will never find a place to be safe again. Look into my eyes and know my word is true.”
“He might not wake up,” he said in a flat voice with all the despair in the world as it truly dawned on him. “No. He has to. You make it your job that he does.”
The doctors busied themselves with work, studying the samples taken from Steve’s chest in the meanwhile. They were scientists more than medical doctors, and despite the anxiety of the situation, they were highly interested in the strange samples.
Tony got there just in time. He yanked him backwards by the back of his shirt and expected Steve to be pissed. Instead, Steve sobbed wordlessly in his arms until the sky turned light and he ran out of tears, staring blankly at the ground with empty eyes.
Iron Man remained motionless for a half second. He stepped backward two small steps, looking at his traitorous hands as though he could see them teeming with bacteria.
Bruce tore into the foil wrapped of the Twix bar. “They’ll find her. When they do, she’ll be able to shed some light.”
TS: [Pause] Not yet. I need to think about what to do with this. I’m going to phone a friend for this one, I think. Send the images of the virus to Doctor Banner and Doctor Pym, encrypt the shit out of them, though. Last thing we need is the blueprint to an alien virus falling into the wrong hands. [Inaudible] … need to lay out the DNA [Inaudible] … read up on microbiology and [Inaudible].
Steve tucked his sketchbook into his carry-on. He left a message for Jet on a piece of yellow paper on his pillow; they didn’t call ahead to coordinate visits, she just tended to appear from time to time and he didn’t want her to feel abandoned.
The scary thing was that there was no ostensible reason for Steve to remain unconscious. He was, by all measures, well enough to awaken. His healing seemed slower, but he
“I’m fine,” Steve said reflexively, and Fury, the smug bastard, looked pleased to hear it. “I just want to do anything I can to help.”
The two blips representing Steve and Sharon descended a level into the station, standing stationary for a few moments. With a swiping gesture, Tony sped up the playback. “Look. He gets on the train, Sharon stays there. Then she gets on one. Then the trains move but their signals get— well, look.”
They both had their love lives, public and private— Tony more than Steve, who was on and off with Sharon and tended not to date many women— but they’d been on and off with each other, as well. The details weren’t openly shared, but they made little effort to hide the fact that they shared an unusual bond that went beyond brothers-in-arms. When they fought, they looked like a couple going through divorce. When they worked together, they were seamless.
“And Jet can help, when she’s cleared to leave,” Steve said. Fury looked skeptical that would happen at all. “I’m going down to the holding cell to help straighten things out. She’s a good girl, she’s just been through a lot. She lost her family, when things fell apart.”
They stayed in Napa for a month and Steve got a suntan and gained a healthy amount of weight eating pasta and cheese and grapes. Tony's body still fit Steve like a glove. Though Steve tortured himself with guilt when he had a quiet moment, it never felt wrong during the act. Tony loved him with his mouth and hands. He licked up sweat and tears and he knew how to touch Steve to make him see white.
“The food, for one thing. Which is just funny, I guess, because it was so horrible. Especially at first. But it became home, you know? Familiar. And the sunsets. There were two suns.They didn’t set together, except once in a blue moon. When they did, it was... indescribable. The light and colors. It was special.”
?” she said when Steve finished talking. He seemed to delft when he was done, his posture loosening. It was as though he’d found the strength just to get his story out and now that he had, he didn’t have much left to keep going on.
Steve pursed his lips. He kept looking down the dark side of the street as though searching for someone. Tony looked too but no one was there.
“I’m going out tonight,” he said at dinner, breaking the silence. They were seated across from each other at a long kitchen table, an open two-liter bottle of Coke going flat with the cap off. Tony had ordered Italian delivery from a place he claimed Steve used to love. Apparently, the tiramisu had been his favorite. Steve didn't remember. Steve poked at a pile of pasta without eating anything while Tony very conspicuously pretended not to count his every bite.
“Why isn’t he waking up?” he demanded. “Did I miss a memo? He looks like a castaway from the savage lands. I saw him just this morning. Someone explain this to me.”
Steve wasn't there; he'd gone to bed early tonight after having a particularly rough day in therapy. The lab felt cavernous and empty without Steve perched in the corner scratching away with a pencil in his sketchpad. Tony rubbed his eyes with his hands. They were dry and heavy from exhaustion. He would not admit it, but between hovering over Steve in the daytime and working on this machine at night, trying to make the damn thing work, he wasn't sleeping much and the pressure was starting to get to him. Steve was damaged. It was hard to watch. Tony wanted to fix him and that was his first mistake, probably; he knew that he couldn't fix a person and that complex trauma didn't go away overnight, but every time Steve flinched at a mundane sound, or stumbled over his own feet trying to avoid some invisible trap in the ground that wasn't really there, constantly checking over his shoulder like he expected someone to be there following close behind, it broke Tony.
injuries they encountered. Steve shouldn’t have ‘old’ injuries, let alone evidence of injuries years ago that, according to medical records, never happened.
Tony seemed to consider this for a moment. “It would be possible, though, that the Steve who entered the subway could have just as well have been the imposter, then, and that this one is the real one.”
“I couldn’t, not before,” Steve explained, “But they did s’thing to me in Zola’s lab. Affected the, uh. The serum. It’ll get better. But I’m closer to human.”
Then he saw, posted on a bulletin board under the roof of the front step of the church, a flier advertising a support group run by the church. There were spare fliers tacked to the cork; Steve took one for himself. It was for parents who had lost children. A chill rushed through him. His mom would call it God’s hand at work.
Tony was lying on the ground, rubbing his throat and gasping. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, but I didn’t clone any kind of signature. I don't know who you're even talking about. That’s not what this thing does,” he rasped, holding his hands above his face defensively.
Tony scrolled to another picture, an aerial image taken from a drone or plane. “It’s my vineyard home. I don’t spend much time there now that I’m sober, and it practically runs itself. But it’s a beautiful place to retreat to. Quiet. Sunny.”
Bruce continued, “Anything’s possible, at this point. And you know what they say. Sometimes, reality is stranger than fiction. We’re just going to have to wait and see.”
His heart started pounding the longer he stood there in his boxers and socks, entertaining the forbidden thought.
Steve was formally discharged from the medical bay without so much as a psych evaluation. First mistake.
The reminder of Tony’s sobriety being sometimes fragile made Steve shrivel internally with guilt at his behavior a few weeks ago when he turned up drunk and cried in Tony’s arms. “Are you sure that’s a good idea?” He asked, hoping he didn’t sound accusatory.
Jet had been the daughter of Zola, apparently, though Steve was hesitant to speak more on that particular point for some reason. After killing Zola, and after Sharon died, they both made it through the portal home— this much, at least, Tony already knew. But Jet convinced Steve that his war memorabilia and other relics of his first life were holding him in the past.
The machines purred and beeped steadily and displayed Steve’s vitals, a sea of numbers and meters and dials. His face was lax and still, but even in his comatose state, his mouth seemed to turn down at the edges. There was pain in his expression. How could his appearance have changed so much in just half an hour? Was was the mysterious metal in his chest cavity? How could this bizarre occurrence be explained? Some sort of
“You’re here now,” he said. Steve’s breath was hot and humid on Tony’s chest and his chest was heaving with the effort of breathing. Heat poured off of him like a furnace.
Tony was facing away from Steve and froze for a moment. "You can stay, if you'd like. But I'm going. And I'd really like it if you came back with me."
Tony poured Sam a cup of coffee. “SHIELD is looking into it. They debriefed Steve and they’re trying to find her body but—”
“Yes, of course. And you know where to find me. I’m only a few steps away. And if you just ask the computer to get me, I’ll come.”
It hadn’t even occurred to Tony. He hadn’t thought much of what Steve had been eating, and he was suddenly overwhelmed with curiosity about the ecosystems and terrain of the other place. It was entirely the wrong time to ask, so he held his tongue.
Tony turned around, finally acknowledging Steve. Realization flashed in his eyes as it dawned on him that he would have to explain himself. In the glow of the portal, he looked every bit as secretive as heh had been acting and Steve felt a flash of anger.
“Do you want a glass of water? You can rest, you don’t have to talk right away,” Tony said, to Fury’s dismay.
“You should be right here,” he said, though he wasn’t unfamiliar with the feeling. “I know it feels wrong. You lost someone close to you. It’s natural to feel like you’d rather trade places. But you lived.”
Tony knew where Sharon was taking him because he had suggested the place to her himself. (“It’s his favorite. Trust me. He’ll thank you afterward. The tiramisu makes him wild.”)
"Dimension Z," Tony said, remembering that was what Steve had called it, "I'm not sure. There's infinite dimensions. And I don't know what good it would do. But they're sure trying their damndest."
“Need a hand?” Tony said. He ironed the bill flat on the edge of the vending machine and fed it into the slot. The buttons lit up and Tony smiled tiredly. “I highly recommend the salt and vinegar chips. Pairs nicely with chocolate milk.”
“Hey, champ,” Tony said, voice scratchy with sleep. He reached out to carefully squeeze Steve’s hand, avoiding the IV. “You gave us all a scare.”
A church appeared behind a gnarled tree and a dumpster. There was a light on outside, shining on the small sign in the shape of a crucifix. The windows were black. He sat on the curb in the shadow of the cross. He hadn’t noticed how exhausted he was until he stopped moving. His body was constantly surprising him. He was still weak despite having made a total recovery from his external injuries.
Steve guiltily shifted his weight. He was dressed in casual clothes, jeans and a button down shirt with a visored hat that kept his face in shadow. Over the course of the past few weeks, he’d seemingly made an attempt to keep up shaving, but he always went too long between remembering, so there was always a layer of stubble on his jaw and cheeks. It was the way Steve dressed when he was trying not to be noticed.
It was the first he’d called it by any particular name. Tony made a note to remember that. “Like what?”
After begrudgingly letting Jet go, they released Steve too. His word carried a lot of weight and he insisted that the daughter of Zola had become a friend once she realized the evil of her father’s tyranny and joined the side of the angels, but no one at HIELD seemed happy with this.
“Oh,” he said, “They’re going to try and find Sharon. The portal collapsed around us when she detonated Zola's ship, so she... I don’t think there’ll be anything left to find but.”
FR: [Pause] I was mistaken. I was detecting virus particles. However, they have become inert. They pose no threat.
“Nobody lasts forever, Papa,” Ian said. Steve didn't look at him. He shut his eyes. Rain pelted the window pane and Steve willed the white noise to swallow him. There was no rain in Dimension Z; water rose in thick fog to a higher altitude where it collected in distant mountains and found its way back down to the ground through rock springs and the crystal river.
“What? I don't get it, what did you feel? Is it Zola, is he alive, what is it?” he asked. Jet slowly shook her head, and her dark mouth curled up into a smile. She started laughing. Tears were running down her cheeks. Steve was still frozen. Wordless, staring at the blue light.
Steve was sleeping, but sometimes Tony stayed up like this and listened for any sign of a nightmare. Shouting, or muffled sobs, the sound of the alarm clock knocked to the floor by a fit of thrashing.
his drawings which had been in the pockets of his uniform when he fell through the portal alive. The true face may fade from his mind over time but he had dozens of drawings to look at, and that paper version of his child would always exist. It was an empty comfort.
Now, Steve noticed the picture placed on the nightstand. He stopped moving. Then he turned over his shoulder and said, “Thank you, Tony. Everything is just as I remember. I appreciate this.”
” Tony produced a projection displaying tracking data on active Avengers, using their cellphones and chips in their equipment. There was a blue, multi-level map of New York, pulling from GPS signals and zoning records. Small white dots represented Avengers, glowing and moving about the city. “Look. I’ll play back this evening. Here’s six o’clock, he and Sharon go down into the subway.”
For his birthday, Tony bought him a custom engraved brass pocket watch. The weight of it in his pocket, now, was like a cement block tied around his ankle. The engraving was innocent, a map of the world with a handful of countries etched a slightly darker color. Only Steve would get the inside joke: Tony had subtly pinpointed every location they’d had sex in.
He had visited Steve this morning to give him a birthday gift, but the lost his nerve when the bathroom door opened and Sharon stepped out of a cloud of steam with a towel around her body. She was a beautiful, witty, wonderful woman. She and Steve made each other happy, and she was there for him when Tony couldn’t be. He couldn’t resent her for loving him, and there was some mutual respect between he and Sharon, because in a way, they shared Steve’s heart Half of him was better than none of them, and he was too much of a gentleman to love them both at the same time, but that love
"I'm sorry," Tony said again. Then he said that he wasn't coming at all, and he was sending a plane to collect Steve before the servants came to close down the vineyard house to sit vacant again. "We'll go again, I promise. We'll do everything you want," Tony said. He sounded like an absent father placating a child with promises never intended to be kept. Steve felt pathetic for being so glum about it. Ian died in a wasteland without ever having truly lived, and Steve was sad about his vacation being cut off.
“Can we get these people back? Can we get some space please?” Tony said, polite but authoritative. Rain plastered his hair to his forehead as he pushed through the crowd, anxiously scanning the scene looking for Steve. He came as soon as he heard, criminally speeding because he didn’t have the armor with him and he was close enough that he hadn’t wanted to turn around and get it. His car was parked askew in the street.
It couldn't last forever. Tony's phone rang one day when they were tangled up in each other on an unmade bed, and when he answered it all the muscled in his body tensed up.
Perched on the edge of the leather chair with his arms sense at his sides, Steve looked ready to bolt at the drop of a hat. His psychologist sighed, crossing her ankles and setting her notepad in her lap.
The first night, after they got home from the diner, Steve crashed on the couch in Tony’s own apartment when Tony stepped out of the room to bring him a set of clothes and a towel for the shower.
"Calibrating," FRIDAY said. Then, the haze shifted and became more concentrated, like turning the dial on a microscope and bringing a blurry slide into sharp focus. It became a circle, about six feet high, floating in the center of the lab, projected from that small device on the work table.
Bruce crumpled his wrapped and stuffed it in the trash. “I got clearance to send you samples. I pulled a favor with Maria,” he said.
“She’s tough as nails,” Tony agreed, but he had a bad feeling. It felt like bad luck to speak his doubt aloud, but if Steve was in critical condition, how could Sharon fare much better? He had to hope it was just luck.
to offer and he stood by his window, a thinner and gruffer man, and he hears his mother’s voice in his head, Your father gave away his goodness to a bad world. He was a good man but he changed.
That night in bed, Tony thought things over. It hit him that the picture of Sharon had been nowhere to be seen in the bedroom when he brought Steve dinner and he rolled over, closing his eyes and with guilt sitting on his chest like a pile of bricks.
It had clearly not been opened in years. The lock has been painted over by a careless worked. He forced it open and sucked in the fresh air.
Steve shrugged. The dream was tainted now; there would always be an empty space where his son should be. He said, “Some things work out better as fantasies.”
Tony felt clumsy comforting Steve; so often, their positions had been swapped. Watching Steve implode was like watching God die. It was terrifying, but he swallowed his panic. He rubbed Steve’s back, without thinking. When they were lovers they exchanged comforting gestures like pair-bonded birds preening each others’ feathers. It came so naturally that he didn’t think to ask permission.
“You don’t know how hard I’m trying, Steve, to be what you need right now. But I don’t know where the boundaries are. I don’t know how to pretend you’re just—”
As reluctant as Steve was to allow himself to enjoy it, the vacation was a breath of fresh air. Tony kept him so busy that he hardly had time to think during the long days, and the seclusion of the vineyard from the rest of the world gave Steve the respite he didn’t realize he so gravely needed from the noise of civilization. In a way, it was like coming out of the ice all over again. And just like when he’d awoken in this century, it was Tony by his side showing him all the light the world had to offer, coaxing him out of his darkness.
Tony opened his mouth and blood and drool dribbled down his chin. He was definitely concussed. Nothing she was saying was making any sense to him.
California was warm and dry when they landed despite the sun being down. It was jarring coming from New York which had been damp and cool with rain when they boarded the plane. The private plane touched down on a runway in a yellow field. They shuttled to the house through the valley in a Jeep driven by a mustached man in a starched white shirt.
Whisked away to a lab deep inside SHIELD’s Hub, Doctor Pym and Doctor Banner inspected him absolutely baffled. Nano fluid flowed from the needle into the chest cavity, which looked like hamburger meat, destroying the remnants of foreign material inside his body. Hank leaned in close as though he could see the microscopic bots.
The next few days weren't the best, but they weren't the worst. The vacation was clearly over; Tony was deeply in work-mode, living off of coffee and wearing all his clothes too loose form missed meals. The awkwardness between them wore off though, thankfully. It had been one of those bumpy patches that any friends or lovers inevitably went through when spending too much time alone together. At least, that was how Steve justified it to himself. Deep down, he was still bothered that Tony was keeping something from him but he tried to trust that he wouldn't unless it was necessary, and that he would tell the ruth eventually. It didn't make it easy to be around him constantly without doubts popping into his head, but it was still much better than being alone.
Pym pointed a handheld light at the incision site, prodding the carnage of Steve’s pectoral muscle like he was a cadaver at medical school, not a human— their friend. Bruce swatted his hand.
How terribly confident. Now the he’d missed his chance, he was relieved he hadn’t given the gift. He couldn’t even remember what he had been thinking, giving that to Steve now. Things between he and Sharon had seemed so serious lately and it wasn’t easy for Tony to watch, but he accepted that they would probably end up together permanently in some capacity. Married, even.
But did he know? It was impossible to read Steve. Tony felt a pang of loss, even though he knew it was unfair. He’d blinked and lost his best friend for a decade without having a chance to stop it. A decade of distance between them, Steve growing and changing as anyone would over time, exacerbated by the extreme and traumatic nature of his experience. They’d know each other anywhere, in life or death, but it was almost like sitting across the table from a stranger. An old friend, awkwardly trying to figure out where to start catching up. It was formal in a way that defied the intimacy they used to share.
A pause, and then Tony's voice flat and apologetic, "No. I'm sorry. I got held up. It's a work thing."
His own bedroom grew stale with disuse because he was spending all day out in the countryside and all night in Tony's bed, and they didn't talk about what it meant between them or try to put a label on it again which Steve appreciated. He still felt too much like a widower to try and put words to his feelings. That didn't mean he wanted to be lonely. He wasn't a man of words when it came to his own feelings. He wasn't good at talking to the therapist. He wasn't good at differentiating anger from fear from sorrow. They let their bodies talk instead. When Steve would think of California in the future, he knew he would always think of the taste of grapes, fresh off the vine at the peak of harvest in August and September, and the feeling of Tony's body smashed against his own.
The first floor was fairly open; the kitchen connected to the living area, divided by a marble topped island and wooden stools. The kitchen, though clean and a touch dusty, looked like a nice place to cook and host. Steve admired the basin style sink and the wooden slab cutting board cut into the shape of the state of California, hanging from a peg on the wall. There were dozens of windows which looked out over the even rows of the vineyard and the mountains in the distance.
His mother told him to always stand back up. He told his son the same thing. Lying on a blanket spread out a cross the floor, it began to truly sink in: Ian would never stand up again. Steve failed.
The anger grew; he already knew where that portal would lead-- it was all blindingly obvious now. The secrecy, the constant work, the pushing Steve to see a psychologist, probably to get him ready to jump back into work. And the vacation-- rest and recreation? A little R&R? Let the boys frolic with dolphins and drink beers before sending them to their deaths on the beaches of Normandy, that was the way to do it, a distraction. Steve felt sick to his stomach. He felt dizzy with betrayal.
Tony stayed awake for just about forty-eight hours before he finally lost momentum. All the will power and anxiety and caffeine in the world was no match for sheer exhaustion. Sharon remained missing. Steve slumbered. With the watch still curled in his hand, Tony nodded off in a fold-up metal chair beside the hospital bed, to which Steve was handcuffed.
didn’t just vanish when they weren’t together. And she and Tony out gave him different things. It was easier to accept that it was messy but worked than to change.
. Her signal? Gone. That shouldn’t be possible. Even if something happened, those microchips are designed to continue broadcasting.”
Steve didn’t answer. He closed his eyes. The doorknob clicked and footsteps, timid and even, approached. The scent of bacon and eggs— once a favorite, now nauseating, filled the room. The mattress creaked beneath Tony’s weight as he sat down. Steve opened his eyes a crack and peaked through his eyelashes at Tony’s feet. He was wearing polished shoes and Steve could see himself in their gleaming reflection.
“Nobody,” he said. There was the faintest stubble starting to come in along his jaw and up his cheeks, Tony noticed. Steve looked so out of place. Tony hadn’t seen him this way since they first met what felt like a lifetime ago. That fateful day in a submarine when they found him adrift in the sea and fished him out. And when he thawed, he'd looked just like this, lost in the eyes but too humble or too proud to ask for help-- adrift, though no longer in the sea. Tony hadn’t been able to resist that look; he’d taken Steve under his wing as quickly as possible and bent over backwards to make him smile. Their midnight trip to the Smithsonian was still one of Tony's favorite memories.
Steve held his bag in his lap as the car bounced over the uneven dirt road. Tony looked radiant in the light of the rising moon. His skin shone and he couldn’t stop smiling. They turned onto a different dirt road with a private sign, and they drove through miles of grapes, plump on the twisted vines.
The kindness was suffocating. Love felt like salt rubbed in the wound of loss. Steve let righteous anger fill him, a hotter burning fire than grief. For a while, it worked. He justified his trysts and sneakiness and secrecy by telling himself that it was not Tony’s business— Steve never asked anyone else to shoulder his burden.
Even when they weren’t lovers, they were best friends. And when they weren’t friends, they were still something. They shared a bond that had not often been given years to cool, and Tony felt a pang of fear. What if after twelve years alone Steve had outgrown Tony?
"I'll stay here. And you can take a plane back from New York, when you're done with--" Steve floundered and his face became flushed with heat like it always did when he was anxious and upset, "When you're done keeping secrets from me. And then you can tell me when you're done. Won't you?" And he prayed Tony would just say 'yes'; it was a white flag.
