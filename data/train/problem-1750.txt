plague," the Doctor said vaguely, his eyes sliding from the skeletons to Sherlock, who stared back. "No-one's actually died of that plague, I don't suppose the news will have come back to you yet out here." Kirsty and Hannah exchanged bewildered looks; the Doctor breathed in sharply and stepped away from the skeletons. "No, I don't think this was done by a machine."
Did I really say all that? God, no wonder he stormed out. Or did I shout at him to leave?
John just beams.
Sherlock's Ganymede seemed to speak with his entire body, pacing and gesticulating in a smugly animated sort of way, buoyant with his own wit. John smiled in amusement that was not entirely fake.
John waved him away airily.
The article was on page three of the paper, a small article with a head-and-shoulders shot of the boy –

he called out, throwing his head back against the bed, "harder, please,
him, was willing to hand over responsibility to John to take care of their pleasure, to make sure they were happy in their relationship. His friend's show of subconscious letting go played exactly into John's desires, drove him incrementally higher until his hands shook with it against the bare skin of Sherlock's hips.
She looked uncertain. "I think so," she said. "I can facilitate your mind to reach out to his, but… he has to be aware enough to know you're trying before he can let you in even if he wants to."
Sherlock shrugs John off like the duvet and stands up, his fingers flying to join in front of his lips. "He cut his finger, did you say?"
"That was fantastic," John sighed after another moment.
Miracle grinned boyishly, as though he did not believe it. "Perhaps. Of the Lady Brackenstall I had no such spectacular notions. She had neither the beauty nor the talent of Lady Carfax. A distinctly shy and oppressed woman."
or went to all manner of places looking for people who knew the man who was apparently not Raymond Slessinger. Sherlock had initiated or suggested at least half of their interactions outside of the theatre; surely that meant he wanted to spend time with John?
The next day is windy and clouded, and standing on the beach beside the space where Elle Walker's body still lies – I wonder if Hutchinson actually
"So that's it?" John asks blankly, looking up at Sherlock as the detective's eyes follow the patrol car around the corner. "It was some long-lost Bertha Rochester and that's it?"

He considered this for a moment. "Yet," he corrected. "You might, later this evening. Depending on how this study goes."
in obnoxiously large writing; Sherlock made his way towards it, still shaken and too tired to summon his German for the exchange. "Peter Guillam," he said curtly to the young man at the counter. "I'd like to withdraw the contents of my safe-deposit box."
One can almost see the facts and figures dancing in Sherlock's grey irises. John realises his mouth is open and shuts it before he starts drooling; Sherlock, of course, notices and smirks. "Oh, and I meant to tell you before, I could only get a double room – I probably won't sleep, but I'm sure you won't mind sharing a bed if I do."
he demanded.
, that's not the point." John hid a smirk at his friend's cavalier attitude to his popularity. "It was a good performance, well put-together. That's not the point either - the point was, their Bel-imperia absolutely blew me away."
Be all my sins remember'd."
John clapped him on the shoulder. "I don't think so - I can't imagine Sherlock enjoying himself in the
grin but Montgomery's, the one he had had last night right before he had leaned forward and taken Sherlock's breath away. Sherlock huffed in a sharp breath before pushing that memory out of his mind and adopting the sly, predatory smile he had taken on as the killer's. "Where would you like to start?" John growled.

(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock's POV again; more angst, I'm afraid.
Seriously, it happens all the time. The pair can barely meet anyone who's heard of them prior to the meeting without sitting through a story of
"Touch me and I will have you arrested," Peters replied coldly.
As he tapped out his message to the Detective Inspector on their case, he cast a quick glance at John Watson. "Afghanistan or Iraq?" he asked.
Sherlock is a marvellous thing to behold – even before this whole seduction thing kicked off, John had caught himself more than once sitting in his armchair and staring at his best friend's face, nestled in the arms of Morpheus and looking as though he hadn't a care in the world.
John stood to answer him, his arms open and welcoming.
," he said firmly, "I'll know it's time to leave the stage for good."
He sighed and crumpled the tissue into the overflowing wastepaper bin by the bed, listening to the groaning of the pipes as the shower started up overhead, and pulled a pillow close to curl up against instead.
The tall brunette stares at us for a few more seconds, nodding absently, biting her lip and fighting back tears. Just as I'm flinching, preparing myself for when she bursts into accusations and starts shouting in that high, shrill voice I've heard far too much of, she turns without a word and runs down the stairs. John flinches at the sound of the front door slamming.
John shuffled forwards slightly on his knees, throwing his arms wide in surrender.
interesting – the things you know are amazing.
bedroom. He wonders if the detective is just ignorant of the fact that the word choice implies that they share the bedroom. Sherlock lifts an eyebrow, noticing his blush. "It's a bit warm in here, isn't it?" he comments idly, even though it isn't. "Shall we open a window?"
. Now remembering which things John insisted were
he repeated. Sherlock slowly turned around and reached for him, but Molly locked their hands together, pulling the detective's long fingers against his chest for a moment before releasing them and reeling backwards as if in shock.
There was silence as John stared incredulously at Bill, trying not to laugh. After a moment, he gave up. "Yeah, all right," he relented. "Come on, or we'll be late for General McAuliffe."
?" he asked.
So he walked off, the tips of his fingers buzzing pleasantly, his lips still twinging with the imagined pressure of another pair of lips against them, to find Bill and Jim.
Sherlock sighed in that manner that told John he had stopped listening when John first started speaking. John tried not to throw his arms in the air like a despairing housewife and watched instead as his flatmate shifted in his chair, fiddling with the shoes and looking up at John, his expression almost shy.
The detective gives a little smirk that says that this is exactly what he was expecting. "Has he? Well, then, I think we should help him out."
His flatmate stares at him for a while. Then he shrugs. "I'm not," he says, pushing abruptly away from the table as though the smell of the pasta is making him ill. "If I am, I'll let you know. I have to think." He starts pacing frenetically, his shiny black dress-shoes tapping a sharp, staccato rhythm on the lino of the kitchen floor.
? You have no idea, because there are so many. I could never have the strength to do that."
The door to the castle proper stood opposite him, and since the courtyard was achingly empty, John made for it. He knocked out of some kind of sense of politeness, but the door swung open even as his knuckles touched it, inviting him into the cavernous corridor beyond.
"After," John explains. Sherlock doesn't stop frowning; John's never been particularly garrulous, but arousal seems to strip his verbal skills away completely – much like Sherlock's physical co-ordination, it seems. "You just focus on you first, okay, and then when you're done we'll deal with me," he tries to explain.
Sherlock smiled warily, dropping his arms.
When she leaves, Lestrade sighs and downs the rest of his coffee – evidently not the first of the day. It's been a long night for the detective. "That was cruel, Sherlock," he says roughly. "To give her hope like that. The evidence against McCarthy is absolute, there's no way it wasn't him."
Sherlock sat up, stretching out the cricks in his neck from where the sofa wasn't quite long enough, and grinned at the skull on the mantelpiece.
"Careful," the detective murmured unapologetically, reaching out a hand to help steady him. "John, I just wanted to... thank you, for what you said before," he said, as though the words almost hurt on their way out.
he said seriously, almost tenderly, "
Suddenly there's a revolver involved, pressing against the soft part under Milverton's chin. John can't stop the sharp intake of breath as Milverton is forced to take a step back, but both he and his assailant are too occupied to notice it. The blackmailer's sweating profusely now. "H-hang on, love. No need for violence. C-can't we just work this-"
Julien stood up as Sherlock moved to sit down on the bed, quickly and unceremoniously shucking his trousers before leaning over him in only a neatly-fitting pair of black cotton pants tented around his erection. Sherlock sucked in a sharp breath. "Better?" the boy asked, his voice low and silky-smooth against his ear, his fringe tickling Sherlock's shoulder.
Sherlock frowned. "Bless you," he suggested slightly incredulously.
The eyebrows rose further, a twist of amusement taking over his mouth. "Sidetracked doing what?" he asked wryly.
Sherlock frowned. "Negotiated? So they can talk, they can reason?"
"We all knew it wouldn't last, Will," the jester stated bluntly.
Does it really matter so much what your brother thinks?
"Sherlock," John provided, mostly because it sounded weird hearing the pale creature referred to as 'this guy'.
Sherlock bit his lip and cringed a little in embarrassment. "I need to get back inside Peters' house," he admitted.
"Master Holmes!"
"I told you," Charlotte sighed, looking back at the photograph, "he wasn't very nice."
Hannah smiles in delight. "The teppanyaki restaurant on the Parade," she says. "It'd be so nice if you could come. What a stroke of luck, running into you on the street – are you two on holiday?"
: Yes, the locket-ring is a real thing. It's speculated – but not confirmed – that the bottom portrait is in fact Anne Boleyn.
it means Sherlock still wants him?
He turned around quickly; the girl bore an expression of extreme distaste that was so carefully arranged as to be a cover-up for some other emotion, probably jealousy. He smirked. "At least I know the answers. When he gets angry at you, you'll just look stupid."
was really rather an apt description of Sherlock, John mused, even as he winced at Bill's threatening tone. The only reason he hadn't considered the fact that Bill seemed to treat Sophie as a younger sister when he had solidified his relationship with her was that it really hadn't crossed his mind that he could hurt her like this. He hadn't ever planned for a situation where something – or someone - would be so much more important to him that it wouldn't even register in his mind that he shouldn't be doing what he was. But then,
he'd wanted someone," he moaned. Bradley and Matt shot alarmed glances at each other. "His
Then he strode forwards. "Take it back," he said, and his voice echoed boldly through the street. "Take it back this instant."
Tobias pushed his hands away from the wig. "I don't," he snapped. "You can't help everyone, John."
Sherlock affected a sarcastic laugh. "Oh, naturally. Still stupid enough to get himself murdered, though."
That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt:
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
and the Great and Powerful Sherlock hadn't noticed?
films, nonplussed.
he replied calmly.
Sherlock's fingers brush against his stomach as the detective reaches around him; in an instant, John is aware that a sharp hipbone is also gently touching the side of his belt and that if he moved his face an inch to the right his cheek would bump against his flatmate's. Sherlock seems to inspect the contents of the fridge for a moment before snaking his fingers out and snatching the last slice of Mrs Hudson's boysenberry cheesecake. John retrieves the milk and turns indignantly to watch the detective retreat to the kitchen table with the plate. "Oi."
He raised an eyebrow coolly, making John chuckle. "Oh, no objections from me," he agreed. "I just wasn't expecting you to be so affectionate. This is the most fun I've ever had in this theatre."
And indeed, it didn't look good. The blond teacher sat back and shook out his arms tiredly, biting his bottom lip. Mr O'Doherty leaned forwards, his hand over Carl's mouth to check if he was breathing. Slowly he, too, sat back. And then he shook his head.
Sighing heavily, feeling as though every step carried him through treacle, he set off down the street towards the centre of Frankfurt. It was not where he had pictured spending so much of his time, but Mycroft had recommended it to him as a base for safekeeping. The bank – the
body? You were wanking in
Jim scowled up at him from the ground. "I'm going to the loo," he said boredly, collecting himself onto his feet and making to stalk off.
"Ah," the Doctor proclaimed, joining Sherlock at the door. He shifted as the tweed of the Timelord's jacket brushed against his shoulder. "A library."
With that, Sherlock stands up and pours himself coffee; when he returns, he slides a porcelain cup of tea into John's hands as well. John stares at him. Sherlock smiles tentatively.
Sherlock tried to smile unaffectedly. "Quite understandable, John," he said lightly. "The situation was… affecting."
Sherlock – I spent twelve years dating men who looked like you without knowing why. I came back from Afghanistan because I remembered you and I wanted to find you, just to see if you still remembered, and then when I got here I chickened out because how

"Do I look like I frequented clubs as a teenager?" he replied sarcastically, trying to lean his head back against John's shoulder but not managing because of the difference in their heights.
to hate her, and even though you were scared of her sometimes you still knew that if it was serious, she'd support you." He draws a line beside the next footprint, shooting upwards like a tree-branch. "You had a good time at school. Well-liked, good grades. Head boy in your last year of college. Then you joined the military." Another line, rocketing up towards where John still stands. "You joined because they'd pay your way through medical school, didn't think you'd actually be called to serve, but you didn't think you'd mind if you were; you're strong, and you love adventure and excitement. You completed your doctorate with good grades and got a job as a surgeon, where you saved lives every day. Hundreds of people are indebted to you, are alive because of you. Already, John, you'd made a mark."
John blinked a few times. "Morning, Sherlock," he answered, trying a politely inquisitive smile to remind the detective that he was unexpected, but not imply that he was unwelcome. "How did you know where I live?"
Sherlock Holmes shifted uncomfortably, then moved to sit down next to where John was standing and pat the bench beside him, inviting John to do the same. John did so. "I saw the article in the paper this morning about Carl Powers," he said, his deep voice matter-of-fact. "The article mentioned that his clothes were in his locker but it didn't say anything about the shoes. I came to see whether they'd just forgotten about them, but it doesn't look like they have."
Henzell coughed awkwardly. "One of my regulars just walked in. She's blonde, but I hadn't seen her in a while so I didn't think to mention her. She has bruises all over her face, just like you said – and, now I think about it, I'm pretty sure last time I saw her she was with one of those men you showed me."
John caught Bill's eye behind his back and supressed a smirk at the

hands, you might not want mine anymore."
"He doesn't usually act, does he?" Sherlock commented quietly from beside him, one hand reaching out a little to bump against John's in what could only have been a deliberate gesture of affection.
Sherlock scoffs. "Your men really don't notice anything, do they? He
" he continued. Though he started soft, John could hear him working himself back into his previous frenzy.
He wanted to find out more about the man, needed more information to pursue the recollections hiding at the edges of his subconscious, like chasing someone's heels around the corners of a labyrinth.
"I can't! I don't know who you are, you could be in league with them –"
was he still there? Was it holding still that was working, confusing the swarm somehow? Or was it something in his body that they didn't like - or something in his attitude? Kirsty had been terrified, had looked to the Doctor for help. Sherlock had smiled a grim smile at the fact that she had been so skeptical of their usefulness in solving the murders until it was
The portrait was indeed of the instructor, in the slightly uncomfortable, too-honest style that self-portraits always seemed to take. John raised an eyebrow. "But apart from being how they met, there wasn't anything worth investigating about the class," he pointed out.
"Perhaps you should try it for yourself," Julien suggested, shrugging. Sherlock's grin intensified.
He waved at the four young actors until he caught their attention and gestured towards the stage. None of them had done much yet, all at the beginnings of their careers. Actually, John was the most experienced actor on the stage this afternoon, and he was trying to fight the people who were claiming that this meant he was on his way out, stepping down from lead roles for good.
"Oh, sorry, is it interrupting your program?" John quips, but of course he reaches for the phone – an arm's length away from him – as he says it, so the detective doesn't reply. "Sherlock's phone," John answers it resignedly. Sherlock turns back to the television. John smirks.
Than music from the spheres."
Marchbanks led them down a few corridors, then stopped and turned to Hannah. "What's going on that you need access to the forest water supply, Professor?" he asked. Hannah looked at Sherlock uncertainly.
John chuckled ruefully and looked the kid up and down. He was wearing a dark button-down shirt and black jeans, dressed more sharply than the rest of the students. He was handsome in a sophisticated sort of way, brooding features and rather piercing dark eyes. "So, you're from Ireland?"
he agreed.
But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
"I just don't think he

Grinning, John nodded in a drill-sergeant kind of way. Everyone laughed; as much as the two of them looked like they were kidding, even Jim could probably tell that when they headed upstairs, Bill would be handing over the packet of instant coffee and John would not be giving it back.
John smirked at him. "

Hannah coughed nervously. "Sir, they were here about the murders. There's been another one – Kirsty Harding's dead." Her voice broke a tiny bit on the last word, but she lifted her chin firmly. "These men know what did it, they say we're all in danger."
Sherlock lifted a disdainful eyebrow. "I'm certain you

The boy frowned. "But not

That little outburst had to be the result of something else.
A low, helpless noise bubbled out of Julien's throat and his hands shifted from Sherlock's chest round to his back, clutching him closer. Sherlock felt the thrill of success and sucked harder at the same point, but Julien grabbed his shoulders and pushed him away.
Sherlock's mouth twisted in a smile. "Just because I've never done one of Shakespeare's plays before doesn't mean I've never wanted to. Before I went abroad I used to use Shakespeare as an audition repertoire on the rare occasion I had to audition for parts."
"First thing in the morning. I tried to get you in tonight to see the bodies, but the morgue clams up tighter than an accountant's arsehole when it comes to strangers, especially after hours."
The Cuxton boy gaped at him. "Oh, John," he whispered as though he could not help himself. And then they were kissing again; this time John wrestled for control of the kiss, and Sherlock gave it up with surprising ease.
make a man important if that didn't. "Still, though," he said, finally putting down Ophelia's cue-script, somewhat crumpled from being twisted in his hands. "Lady Brackenstall wasn't Lady Brackenstall."
Sherlock gave him a dirty look. "That would be most efficient," he agreed. "Contact me when you have found him."
John couldn't stop himself from freezing for a moment before he forced himself to relax and look unconcerned. "It doesn't unnerve me," he said truthfully. "We spend so much time together it would probably be stranger if you

Sherlock finally managed to get the bedsheets up to his chest, smearing the almost-dry come under his hands with a wince. "Never mind, John," he tried to say, his voice coming out embarrassingly high-pitched. "Don't worry about it." He cleared his throat desperately.
The man snorted. "Of course," he confirmed. "Or I would not be showing you that I have it."
"So we were right," Sherlock said as soon as they were back on the street, the door of the studio swinging shut behind them. "Lady Brackenstall and Lady Carfax knew each other well. Their disappearances are tightly linked."
"But you must know
whenever their eyes met? And if he did…

Sherlock's phone shouts a quick warning and the detective's eyes snap away from him quickly. John breathes out; for some reason, when his friend is looking at him, it's difficult to remember how to do ordinary things like respiration. "John," Sherlock says, making no attempt to locate the source of the trill. "John, phone."
He wasn't as surprised as he ought to have been when Donovan interrupted them with a panicked look and a phone at her ear to tell them there had been another murder.
Sherlock jumped off the bed, gesturing for John to get up, and jerked open a drawer of his dresser to look for a clean pair of pants. "Can you keep her talking for twenty minutes while I get the police?"
"Tell you what," he said, moving back to his own computer, where the Old Atraxi coding box was still on the screen, "we could make it really hard for them. Trigger the door to close every time they open it."
that make him? And how was he supposed to tell her he was from the twenty-first century and, apparently, a name that she would recognise?
He led them across the room to a table set behind a beam so that you could barely see the rest of the inn from the table, bleakly lit with candles hung across the beams. Sherlock gave him a rather pointed and almost annoyed look. "Thank you, Angelo," he said, shaking out his shirtsleeves and moving his chair to get the best view of the rest of the room. John smiled at the two of them, sitting in the other chair exactly where it had sat when they arrived.
The two looked at each other, frowning almost identical frowns. Then Mycroft took an abrupt breath in. "I expect you to give this matter your full attention, Sherlock," he said sternly. "Theatre or no theatre. A woman's life may be in jeopardy."
Elizabeth's grin softened into a fond sort of smile. "He's in the kitchen."
John's hair stands on end at the nape of his neck at the image of waking up to find a consulting detective draped all over him like an extra blanket. A
Kemp shrugged unconcernedly, apparently having missed the unspoken exchange between the other two. "He's never missed one yet," he replied.
He manoeuvres the blankets up, holding a space for his friend which Sherlock is quick to take, carefully climbing off his chest and into bed. When he's settled down, the detective leans forward and places a gentle, chaste kiss on his lips. "I love you, John," he says seriously, wrapping his arms around him and sighing.
The young fairy seemed to shrink under the force of John's

were talking about it, actually. I don't remember having much constructive input in the conversation." Sherlock's chuckle starts up again. "I think you should just say what you have to say and then leave before you do something you'll regret."
He knew that the bite wouldn't actually mark him, but the fact that
"We're closed," came a muffled voice from behind it. Sherlock frowned and knocked again, not wanting to let them know who it was before they opened the door so that he could tell if they didn't want to talk to him. The voice grew louder. "I said we're - Sherlock!"
The doctor leaned around his hands and placed a chaste kiss on Sherlock's cheek. "Then don't," he replied simply.
John sits up straighter, the woman from the day before floating back into his head. Mycroft's eyebrows shoot up into his hair.
That didn't explain what he was doing in John's house. Sherlock was always the first one out of the Ministry at the end of the day, and even though John had tried to invite him to various study groups or Leaky Cauldron quiz nights he had always refused. Now, though, he had put the box of confectionary down on top of the Post-War Defence textbook and was fidgeting restlessly with his hands.
The second man had undressed slightly further than the first, and therefore looked a little less dignified in death, his torso bare and his purposefully-ripped jeans shoved down around his thighs. He was younger, too, obviously less personally successful than Montgomery. Rich parents, Sherlock guessed. Those were £200 jeans he'd bought ripped like that, and actual diamonds gleaming in three places on his left ear. They weren't the only examples of careless wealth flaunted about his person, and the bedroom itself was even worse. The degree to which the man displayed the wealth that he had inherited suggested huge levels of arrogance – he imagined a youth entirely used to female attention. Dominance would probably be more than natural to him, and it was completely possible he could get carried away more than once. Sherlock allowed one corner of his mouth to quirk upwards humourlessly.
I can't help but feel slightly guilty. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness
It had been a while since John had tried to conjure lube in quite this state, and he overdid the spell a little, squirting the clear fluid across Sherlock's abdomen rather more copiously than he'd intended. The brunet chuckled. "Shut up," John growled, kissing him again. "It worked, didn't it?"
. Josh had been shorter than John, but even so, he was right; they'd all had unruly dark curls falling across their thin, pale faces. He'd never noticed before – it was something that just sort of happened like that. "One almost starts to think that you're trying to replace a long-lost love with those features. That there was just
John sighed. "All right. So what does it mean, then? If Crocker and Lady Carfax are trying to play games with you, does that tell us something about what's happened to them?"

how willing Sherlock was to pass over his work for him - a sign, perhaps, that he was not the only one whom the strength of this friendship had taken by surprise.
There is silence for a few moments as the consultant considers this. "How many times have you been in love, John?"
He gave a crude approximation of a bright smile, feigning indifference. John Watson looked taken aback, and he felt his smile slide into something real at the knowledge that he'd surprised and even impressed the bold army doctor. John Watson looked accusingly over at Stamford. "You told him about me."
What I'm doing instead, apparently, is proving that I can't. That some part of me doesn't want to. That I am now deliberately starving myself to see what point John will let me get to before he steps in and forces me to eat again.

"None taken, that looked like quite the experience. Are you still using the copier?" John reclaimed his notes and stepped away from the machine. "Ooh. That looks complicated," she said, biting her lip as she examined it. "Is it a printer as well?"
The other boy's smile widened. "That is not what I meant – I care not for your Carl Powers. You have, I think…" he frowned the frown that Sherlock had come to associate with the translation of a particular turn of phrase, one delicate hand reaching out to thumb a lock of Sherlock's hair from his face. "
It wasn't lost on him, however, that there was a different tone about Demetrius' declaration of love for Helena this afternoon than the young man had played it in the past: an element of the feverish, obsessive note that always made John delightfully uneasy in the fairy wood remained in it, and it wasn't lost on Helena either, the same uneasy note in her returning line:

John frowned at the ice coating Olivia's words. "

"I'm… having trouble with some of the spells for the test," he said finally, his eyes firmly on his shoes. "I thought… well, I've seen you do all of the spells, but the theory doesn't come easily to you. I understand all of the theory, but I need help with the spells. I thought we could help each other."
Milverton clicks on the light and John can't help but flinch at the sudden influx of light. Sherlock clutches reflexively at his hand and gives it a reassuring little shake that serves to do nothing for John's nerves.
"Oh, John," he said through the grin. "I
There was a shocked silence in which Sherlock debated the relative embarrassment of crossing the dormitory completely starkers in order to find his wand and hex himself into oblivion. He hadn't meant to say anything like that. Now John
"I've been thinking," John admitted finally, pausing to allow the detective to raise the expected incredulous eyebrow without comment. "It seems a bit pointless that Lady Carfax is spending all this time trying to get

John should have known, however, that Bill had accepted his decision too easily.
him, not something he wanted to define him; that Sherlock was a mistake that he should try to forget about.
John's face would colour and he would make to leave, stammering some excuse about being caught by surprise and not thinking that Sherlock did this kind of thing. Sherlock would have to cut him off to stop him from leaving. "No – I don't mean
The two of them stood like that, listening to the flowing verse in the detective's smooth baritone rumble. He hadn't even considered what Shakespeare's language would sound like in Sherlock's mouth, too caught up in the emotion of his acting, but he was quickly realising his mistake: the two worked wonderfully together, with the detective fluctuating easily between anger and misery in his tirade until he turned back to John and Ben for his final accusation:
An hour and a bit later the car pulled up outside Cuxton Grammar School. Tom threw another backwards glance at Sherlock, who smiled wistfully. "Have a good year, Master Holmes," he said after a pause. Outside the car, they could hear the screams and yells of teenagers reuniting.
He looked up through his eyelashes at John and smirked as best he could, taking his cock as deeply into his throat as he could and swallowing around it. He had a feeling John wouldn't mind indulging this particular pleasure more often.
"I'm delighted to hear it." The three of them turned at the sound of the playwright's voice; Will stood behind them leaning against the wall, grinning broadly. "Welcome aboard, Master Holmes."
"That's fine," Sherlock said quickly, wriggling his bottom into a cushion. "I like the sound of your voice."
Sherlock protested in perfect rhythm. John wanted to laugh at the styling of the lines, a comic couplet of such destructive power.
Slowly, Lady Trelawney-Hope sinks into the armchair that I sat in last time we were here. "Where is your proof?" she asks.
He hummed approval at the pressure against his scalp and finally let his face trail closer to John's groin, nosing at his balls and breathing in the earthy, base scent there. He smelt like semen and musk and arousal and

He chuckled. "Yes, thank you, Doctor." At the Doctor's affirming movement, Sherlock stepped into the Martian library. "I'm surprised
John volunteered the obvious answer anyway. "To sell," he suggested.
"I thought he was being
He looks at John like he's waiting for the answer, so the army doctor coughs, sits up straighter, collects the last facts the detective laid in front of him, lines them up like a buffet-train, and fits them into the conclusion that Sherlock probably reached hours ago. "He could've done it himself after he got his head bashed in. Convulsions caused by the brain injury."
"Tobias?" he said quietly.
might Jim be doing at the place where the boy who'd made his life hell had died?
Lord Trelawney-Hope casts his eyes downwards. "War, Mr Holmes," he says, his lips tight and pale.
Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
But the consulting detective forces a smile that looks more like a grimace and shrugs.
John had never heard the song before and the lyrics were not included in the cue script Will had given him; he had expected a sweet ballad of love won, and the woeful tones of hopeless despair took him by such surprise that he stopped their dance. Sherlock paused with him, clearly almost as taken aback himself. They stared at each other while Kemp sung on, their right palms pressed together between their shoulders.
The doctor looked decidedly uncomfortable. "I have to… I'm sorry, but if I keep going then I'll…" he gestured to his groin.
"It was a cataract knife," he replies immediately, realising the point as he says it. "Which wouldn't have just been lying on the kitchen table," he finishes, nodding. Sherlock's nodding too, looking positively gleeful.
The Doctor unfolded his arms and stood up from where he had been leaning against a dusty workbench. "Oh, I'd say it wouldn't have taken more than a few
"I have a theory," Sherlock exaggerated briskly, striding into the kitchen and filling the kettle. "But it relies on Charlotte knowing the latest victim. If she didn't, it's more likely that her knowing the others was just coincidence. While we wait for Lestrade to call it would be beneficial to go over the latest murder, perhaps get an idea of what it was that made her strangle him early."
"Sherlock, I still need to know exactly what's going on, here," the Constable said wearily, sounding as though he was expecting a rejection.
The detective ignored the dig and answered the question instead, still smirking smugly. "
Helena is here at hand," he explained.
- there are far nastier criminals you should be focussing on catching."
His hand made its way between his legs and pushed restlessly at his erection, meaning to only stroke once in the hopes that it would calm down, but that one stroke set off a burst of relieved pleasure and he could not refrain from rubbing himself again, and then again, the pleasure building until he threw his head back hard enough to bruise it against the wall and came with a bitten-off moan.
"But now Lady Carfax is missing too," John interjected.
John rolled his eyes. Apparently Bill had managed to offend Mr O'Doherty already. "Oh, come on." Bill's red mop bounced cheerfully around the corner. "I don't know why she got so – I was
Sherlock is sitting in the dark on the settee, staring into space blankly. John can see the ruins where tears have trekked down his cheeks and feels even more wrecked than before.
The science officer turned away, resting his head against the wall behind him. "You didn't stay until the end," he stated quietly.
in case we finished here early," he said, fishing the tight roll of paper from an inside pocket of his coat. "We could - oh, never mind."
Sherlock growled in frustration. "Fine. Give me access to the computer."
the bed,
The detective looked as though he hadn't considered this point. He nodded slowly. "I can understand that," he admitted. "But the offer is there, should you ever wish to look at the place. I'd like it if you considered it once the season is over."
When I said I'd take ages to update, this isn't really what I meant. I'm sorry. Also, last time I was vague as to where in DW canon this was - I think I'll firmly place it between The Angels Take Manhattan and The Snowmen now. And I've had this planned out for almost a year now and I've always planned to include Jack, Rose and the copy of Ten in various chapters.
A door slams in the house and John panics. "
had to listen to his little observations about crime scenes, surely. Maybe his name would come up somewhere and John would recognise it.
Kemp, who had entered on the cue that John had for Sir Toby a few lines back, cleared his throat. "It doesn't look like the Duke has a conversation with Toby, unless it's in your script and not mine? Could we have one of them 'speak' from offstage?"
To undertake the death of all the world
John thought about it. "But if it's not him, then we lose his inside knowledge of Her Majesty's inner circle until we decide to let him know."
His friend shrugged. "He was denying his sexuality to himself. I saw the challenge."
Sherlock shifted out of range of John's elbows, looking uncomfortable.
," he managed to choke out, quieter and more subdued than he had intended.
"All right," he said finally. "Thank you."
John was less convinced, but he set himself to rubbing Sophia's arms to try and get some warmth back into them, and ignored the suspicions running through his mind until he could load Sophia onto a bus for the unnaturally hushed ride back to Islington.
Sherlock laughed. "Quite right, too," he assessed.
" John said hurriedly, patting his lover's shoulder to distract him.
"So," John engaged as they skirted around the kitchen table, back to the bar and John's lukewarm half-cup of tea. "You must not come here very often."
The detective has stiffened against him, his every nerve ending suddenly tense and ready. "Say that again," he says, his voice a low growl that causes an involuntary, confused stirring in John's abdomen.
Sherlock took his time leaving the stage, pausing at the door to look back at his Lord, opening his mouth as though to say something before thinking better of it and closing the stage door behind him. John, too, lingered for a moment to share a deeply confused look with his audience before following him.
It had always amused John how the comic relief in Will's writing often made the most poignant points; Kemp had made a mastery out of wordplay in the years they had worked together. John knew for a fact that when each new cue-script was released he would sit with the playwright and explore every possible meaning of each line just so that the double-entendres made it across to the audience. He wasn't sure he quite managed to look impatient and frustrated with the constant diversions while he was so impressed by the fact that nothing that the other boy was saying was straightforward.
her from the feet upwards. Her knees buckled; for the barest of instants, her body gleamed wetly red with exposed blood and muscle before it crumpled to the ground, stripped completely bare like the skeletons ironically-placed in the cupboard, her clothes reduced to shreds of striped fabric. The grotesque jaws of her surreally-white skull made a terrible
Sherlock froze for a moment as though Orlando had caught him out, but then he slid his back across the desk with a polite smile and jumped back into his fluid, active speech.
"Right," John agreed instead, nodding briskly. "Yeah, leaving. I'm just – ow! Is that – Sherlock, there's
"We weren't going to," Sherlock said, slightly sharply with a glance in Lestrade's direction. He'd seen plenty of interviews of sexual abuse victims handled absolutely terribly by the police; a few times he'd even thrown the officers out of the room and conducted the interview himself, apologising profusely to the victims. It was a sorry state of affairs, he'd remarked to John afterwards, when he was more sensitive and polite than the police. He didn't think that Lestrade would make the same mistakes, but this was
they had been a part of for so long; this was the Lord Chamberlain's Men in all their glory, drunk on each other's presence and the joy of something new, and if Sherlock's energy had had such an impact on the young troupe of the former it was nothing compared to the inspiration he was now. The company were good without him on the stage, but everything seemed
The young Vulcan straightened up and looked at John uncertainly. "I… I could know more about how we can help him if I could get into his mind," she suggested hesitantly. "I mean, if I melded with him."
"Um…"
"This is an old friend of mine, John Watson," Stamford introduced finally as Sherlock started to weave his way and accept the phone from the doctor.
Bill, typically, waited a grand total of five seconds after the teacher's back was turned before he started talking again. "Hey, John," he said, with a tone of voice that suggested he was about to say something monumentally hilarious. "Didn't your girlfriend get back today?"
the jewellery?" he argued, looking back at the butler for confirmation. "You said 'a few pieces'."
More teen experimenting. AKA, explicit adult content.
Sherlock tutted in irritation.
John quirked the tinest of smiles.
He reels, gaping, staring from the photo to me to John. "How… how did you…"

I have a new lead on that stock-market scam in April."
have company walking across London, so much the better."
Aware that he was probably pulling Sherlock's hair half out of his scalp, John attempted to loosen his grip, tried to regain some semblance of restraint before he injured one of them with the sheer need roaring in his ears, but the detective made a piteous whimpering sound as John's fingers moved against his scalp and somehow all he succeeded in doing was turning them around so that it was
Sherlock evidently can't see enough from his position with just his nose pressing against John, so he tilts his face up until his open lips are pressing against hot skin and his warm breath is playing havoc with John's nervous system. John retracts his sudden belief in a generous higher being. This is just unfair.
"Oh!" Sherlock corrected himself, realising that John had been attempting to initiate the expected role-play. Something in his stomach that he hadn't even realised was clenching relaxed. "No, of course. Thank you, John." He reached out a hand timidly for the tea his friend was still holding out to him. "And I'm… fine." He schooled his voice into a quieter, softer tone and hunched over slightly, like someone attempting to drown their sorrows in a bar, shooting an entirely false smile at the doctor.
For a moment there is silence except for the soft drumming of Sherlock's long fingers on the leather arm of his chair. "In Southwark," John repeats slowly. Mrs St. Claire turns her huge blue eyes on him.
, when John returned the favour, guiding Sherlock out of his tight black pants and stroking him gently. John touched a finger to his lush lips, pressing a kiss to his prominent cheekbone. "Shh," he whispered. "The policeman outside might hear."
"There shouldn't be any pause onstage," John countered, straightening his shirt sleeves a little. "Sebastian has a few lines, I should be able to creep back on before I'm needed." He grinned flippantly at them. The actor had indeed begun to speak onstage, so John patted his friend on the arm and followed him on, looking back and frowning as though he had passed himself once more.
you to come. You can stop if you don't like it."
She swallows. "That man – Lucas – he somehow got hold of a photograph of… well, it would have ruined my marriage. I adore Robert. He wouldn't have understood. Lucas told me that he would give the photo to Robert unless I got him that letter. I don't understand politics, Mr Holmes. Lucas told me that Robert wouldn't miss the envelope, but I knew that the photo I swapped it for would have ruined us. So I swapped them. I went to Lucas' house, gave him the envelope, and he gave me the photo. Then… there was a noise in the hall, and he ripped up the carpet and hid the letter under a loose floorboard, right before this woman burst in. She was shouting something in French. When she tried to hit him I ran – I didn't find out that she killed him until the next morning."
Grieg nodded amiably. "Of course. Is Julien… not available?"
a criminal," John retorts. "This isn't the first flat I've helped you break into."
John lifted an eyebrow at him as he stood, already putting his book aside in preparation for getting up and leaving. "Already?" he asked eagerly.
about anyone else before is helplessly arousing. "All right. Shh, now." He squirts a generous helping of lube over one hand and affixes it to Sherlock's erection.

circumstances I would have had something forced into my mouth by John. But I yelled at him, and he promised he would trust me to know when I need food, and he's trying as hard as he can not to push me.
John nods. "Too much. I'm sorry."
John smiled resignedly. "Are you going to tell me what your theory is, then?" he asked, rather densely in Sherlock's opinion.
For a moment, John watched the strangely intimate red light playing across the detective's chin. Then it clicked: Angelo was trying to give them a romantic dinner together. The way he'd winked at Sherlock when he sat them down, he should have guessed it then - Angelo thought Sherlock was
The woman's shuddering breaths calmed down slightly. "Yes. Of course, I'll… take you to the Faculty Manager."
Either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead,
John watched Sherlock set the scene for them with mounting apprehension, but he wasn't the only person with script in hand when he waddled back on the stage, assuming weight and drunkenness with the first step of the swagger.
For a long moment she stood like that, while John tried not to hold his breath in anticipation, unsure what to expect. Then, just as he began to get nervous, the young alien let out her breath in a huff and opened her eyes. "He won't let me in," she said quietly, looking up at John in defeat. "I tried everything I know - he's shut his mind so tightly to them that he won't let me in either."
One more year, he told himself. Then I can be free of this farce of society and learn how to start living.
"I can't," he repeated helplessly. "I'm just not ready for someone like him."
John clung to Sherlock through the kiss until he could actually feel the awkwardness coming from Molly and Tom onstage with them, and then finally allowed them to break apart. Sherlock glanced at the other two and laughed, a clear and joyful sound like the first peal of a wedding bell.
Sherlock quirked a smile. Even John had known that the Queen was sick; there were rumours that she was unlikely to recover from this illness, but there were always rumours, and John had discounted them. Perhaps they had more truth in them this time. "Tell me about this missing woman, then," the detective demanded, as though he had already forgotten the vehemence with which he had previously insisted he didn't want to know.
The detective takes a step back to match John's step forward. "No. John, stop."
Mycroft nodded slowly. "Keep me informed on any progress you make," he ordered silkily. Sherlock lifted a noncommittal eyebrow, and Mycroft - to John's surprise - turned to him instead. "You will make sure my brother stays on track, won't you, John?"
And then there were hands on Sherlock's face, gripping and shifting it, patting his cheeks gently as though he had passed out. He opened his eyes to find that he was looking up at the Doctor from the floor. The hand on his heart had gone.
The Lady hesitated for a moment, bringing a tiny crease between Sherlock's eyes as he tried not to frown. Then she smiled in an attempt to cover up the pause. "Of course, Master Holmes." She held his firm eye contact for the barest of moments before turning around and lowering herself and her voluminous black skirts into an armchair. Her handmaid moved demurely to stand behind the chair, keeping one hand where the Lady could see it as though she was afraid the other woman would forget she was there. "Teresa can help, can't you, Teresa, you were awake."
Julien de Richelieu made the cursory glance down at the lever-arch binder on his desk, and smiled. "Of course. You're very observant." Sherlock shrugged again. "Would you sit down with me?"
The Lady almost falls out of the armchair. "Ten minutes?" I repeat clearly for her benefit. "Fine."
There were traces of dried semen around the tip. The killer had definitely taken satisfaction from the man
Sherlock stepped right in close, until John could feel his measured breath on his face, and looked him up and down.
The pause this time was laden with something John wasn't sure he wanted to identify; Sherlock was looking at him as though he were the most incredible thing in the world and he thought he might actually be
I should have planned for it, I suppose, come up with a reasonable and logical answer that wasn't just 'I don't want it'. I can't really blame him for not believing that one, but I wasn't expecting him to get so violent and I panicked.
The detective stopped for breath, not having taken one during the entire sentence, his long-fingered hands darting every which way to reflect the hotchpotch of emotions his speech described. John raised an eyebrow. Sherlock darted forwards and grabbed John's hands, clearly caught in the passion of his speech.
," he said, as though
Sherlock tried to scowl, but lost it in another giggle. "Well, it doesn't get tickled very often," he defended, circling his hips firmly against John's to try and distract him. It worked in a way; John's grin turned into a rich groan, but his fingernails dug into Sherlock's arse instead of grazing across it, which was just as ticklish. Sherlock huffed and bit at his lower lip, earning another groan, and then to change the subject entirely he rocked forwards and rolled them over so that he was on his hands and knees over the doctor and could bend his neck easily to bite the soft hollow underneath his chin, or sit back and survey the entirety of his body from a different angle.
"I see," Sherlock said uncomfortably. Now that the analytic mindset that had been necessary while he was strangling John had faded his erection had returned to the fore; though the strangulation had calmed it down somewhat, he could still tell that it wouldn't be going anywhere without help. He shifted awkwardly, one hand drifting automatically towards the waistline of his trousers.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "Complicated?" he tried to clarify.
much about giving you pleasure, but he was never short of lovers, so he must have done
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "I'll make a few calls, John and I will investigate a few other angles so that we can find her more easily," he said briskly, avoiding John's eyes again. Lestrade looked suspiciously from one to the other nonetheless before apparently deciding he didn't want to know and giving up.
stay in the same room as Sherlock. "I'll… I'll see you in the morning?"
"Sherlock," the elder Holmes returned. "Master Watson. Please, have a seat."
and John follows suit, kneeling in front of his flatmate and placing reverent kisses along his collarbone, down his sternum, thumbs tracing delicate shapes across his areole and feeling the thump of Sherlock's heartbeat increase.
Powers leered unpleasantly. "I saw you cozying up to that Irish freak in there."
John almost laughed at the expression on the other man's face. "Given his dissatisfaction with the end of
In the sweet pangs of it remember me:
Apparently satisfied, Sherlock returned to her, still frowning intently. "There was a man in front of the window. He struck me across the face and I lost consciousness, and when I regained it he had pulled down the curtains and was using the fringes to tie me to this chair."
The burly young officer looks to Dimmock for confirmation, then slumps off. Sherlock jitters around for a moment.
They repeated last night's ritual of donning their coats by the door and then doubling back to Sherlock's bedroom, John slamming him against the inside wall so hard Sherlock's ears rang and taking his mouth again, one hand sliding up his thigh as though lifting the hem of a dress. Sherlock leaned his head against the wall and panted as John's mouth slid wetly down his jaw and fixed on his still-sensitive neck while his hand travelled still further upwards until it rested over his pectoral muscle the way one might cup a woman's breast.
wouldn't be fair on him either.
Slightly baffled, John frowned at the statement. "
The doctor slapped him, hard. Sherlock recoiled in shock, his hand automatically flying to his cheek as it reddened. John softened immediately, crouching to look. "I'm sorry!" he cried out, lifting a hand to attempt to pry Sherlock's away from the hot and stinging space on his cheek. "I should have warned you I might do that. I just thought he'd be the type to use physical force, given that he hit her instead of trying to stop her from strangling him –"
"Right. Good. Where are we going?"
"Not relevant to this," Sherlock dismissed offhandedly, turning away from John and back to the wall. John nodded acceptance. "So," the detective repeated. He picked an unframed portrait up from the ground and pinned it in the middle of the existing two. "The link between the two ladies is their drawing class, held by Christopher Miracle."
. The Doctor grinned at him, running his fingers over the sign, before dashing up the stairs.
- I honestly believed back then that if he died, I would die too. And then I joined the army, and when I came back from Ireland he was married." Sherlock raised an eyebrow, as though he was aiming for sympathy and not quite reaching it. John frowned.
since he'd first met Julien in high school – when John Watson called him back. He sounded annoyed. "Is that it?" he said loudly. Sherlock stopped, forcing himself to breathe normally.
John's smile widened into something slightly dark, reminiscent of some kind of massive predator. "Oh, I'm
He flicked the laces nonchalantly out of the way and put the shoe down again. John knew this was where he was supposed to compliment him, but the childish part of him refused to give his flatmate the satisfaction. "Twenty years?"
Sherlock had grown up a lot since John had left school, and he'd be lying if he said he hadn't noticed. The gangly thirteen-year-old had broadened into a confident and talented young wizard, and John had caught himself more than once admiring the way his chest had filled out into robes that actually fit, until he'd finally admitted to himself that he was a little bit besotted. Which probably wasn't healthy, considering he'd never seen Sherlock look at
"Then my business started doing better. I met Mrs Hudson. She… cared. I hardly knew her, and she force-fed me homemade muffins until I threw up and collapsed on her sofa." Sherlock's face has dropped its carefully closed expression in favour of a warm smile. "We came back to London together. I was carefully building myself a proper family, a proper
John shrugs as he flicks on the kettle. "We could go to Tesco. That might be fun." He can't deliver the line without smiling, and it's probably lucky he can't see Sherlock's face.
John put a comforting hand on Sherlock's thigh, which only served to completely distract his attention from the case. Another murder meant that they could role-play again. But there were so many things that he could be doing instead that would be more useful to the case, and he had just made up his mind to
"The biggest one happened when I was twenty," John supplied without preamble. Sherlock stroked one finger down the faded white mark that travelled from the second knuckle of his index finger to just below where the life-line crossed the side of his palm, one eyebrow raised to check that this was the scar John meant. "I was very drunk at a friend's twenty-first - Bill Murray's, actually. I walked through a glass door."
She didn't try to reinforce how much she'd liked him, how upset she'd been to hear that he was dead. That was the most common mistake people made, pretending to be too upset about the death of someone they'd killed.
John staggered upon seeing him as if struck, darting his gaze between Tom and Sherlock until all the other players on the stage turned to stare at him. He allowed this for a moment before delivering his next line.
he answered reluctantly.
to make connections with other human beings. But you, you're too terrified of failure to even
John surveyed the dining hall. A few people waved or smiled at them; most people at Islington High knew Bill and, by extension, John. Then he caught sight of the Irish boy from earlier, sitting alone at a table in the corner, and stopped. Even though the younger boy was the picture of composition, staring coolly around at his fellow students and picking lazily at a Thai beef salad, John still felt a twinge of pity in his stomach at the new kid having to sit alone.
to express at the way Sherlock uses the people who are attracted to him. The consulting detective raises an innocuous eyebrow as though daring the good doctor to tell him off. "Why?"
the man insult his own brother like that? No
"So…" John tries tentatively, still carefully watching Sherlock's face for any reaction. "We're okay, then? You and me?"
, he read from Lestrade's case summary.
It started – unsurprisingly, I suppose – with the over-the-top big red First-Aid kit. I've always been something of a magnet for scrapes and bruises, probably something to do with the amount of time I spend running through alleys and jumping off buildings, but John being the beautifully fastidious army doctor that he is would always insist on treating and bandaging each new hurt the moment we stepped through the door. Gradually, perhaps, although I didn't pay much attention to it until I noticed that it had happened, the First-Aid box made its way over to the fireplace, where we usually stood or sat to patch each other up, lying haphazardly on top of some other piece of junk.
"Well, you've definitely got the hang of that advanced defence," he said, rubbing the small of his back where the precautionary cushions had failed to protect him. "I think that's enough practice."
He made as if to look away, but then something – something in the way the newcomer moved, held himself, gazed around the laboratory with steely, determined hazel eyes – twigged in his memory.
from as long as they've got one?"
Bill stared. "God," he invoked, sending John a feverish
"Sherlock," he panted, "our clothes – we're going to –"
She beamed at him. "Thank you, sir. You ought to rest, both of you. We'll have someone clean up what's left of those creatures and eject it just in case."
The woman watches him for a moment, frowning. "I promise I'll delete it after I've shown it to her," Sherlock reassures.
Actually, he'd never bothered to find out much of anything about Carl. One tends not to care so much about the person who's trying to force your head through the bannisters on the stair-rail. "That's still no excuse. I mean, my dad isn't a basket of roses, but I don't push people around."
"This isn't a sex fantasy," he stated softly, not looking at Sherlock.
John cried, but apparently they listened to him no more than they did to Ophelia.
Well, that had gone wonderfully.
He'd gone back down to his office and started up routine scans for life on the surface, and that was where the oddities had started. His scanners had seemed unable to decide whether there was life on the planet or not: though respiration was apparently absent, the levels of psychic activity were high and some of the machines were adamant that they could detect heartbeats.
"Your friends are very insistent," I concur soothingly. "I think you did well keeping moderate coherency." He snorts. "And it's probably lucky for you. This way you'll sleep like a rock and won't hear me bumbling about all night."
before giving up. Sherlock was never sure whether he should be pleased that the doctor seemed to think better of his protests or upset that he still attempted to make them.
"You said something about the April stock crashes?" Dimmock prompts impatiently. Sherlock, visibly buzzing with excitement, nods quickly.
He couldn't quite stop the thrill from racing up his spine, irrational as the things the Doctor was saying was. He rolled his eyes to counteract the effect. "Nothing
fantastic," Molly agreed, his cheeks flushed with excitement.
Sherlock pointedly avoids looking at him or getting too close to him as they unload their bags from the train; he resumes his staring out the window in the cab and leaves John to attempt to persuade the extraordinarily garrulous cabbie that this isn't really the time to complain about everything from David Cameron to West Ham Football Club to the weather and try to make inane conversation.
of the ritual. Sherlock notices her with eyes full of glee. "Ah, Donovan. As always, you've missed everything of importance."
John returned the laugh, rolling his hips up to meet the not-quite-rhythmic thrusts of Sherlock's and employing his mouth in one of these better things. The younger boy was grinding down with little whimpering noises, and if John were to hazard a guess he would say that Sherlock wasn't quite aware that he was doing it. He gently gripped the curly-haired brunet's hips and guided his movements into a sustainable rhythm, brushing their lips together and then sliding his mouth down to the irresistibly flawless skin of his neck. Sherlock's moan was almost startlingly loud. "Godric," John whispered hungrily against his skin. "Look at you." He sat back for a moment, not stopping their hips rocking together, to take in the sight of Sherlock's flushed face above him. "You are Eros incarnate."
?" he asked before he could stop himself.
The Randall gang had been in the periodicals; John remembered reading about their string of violent robberies. He looked at Sherlock for his reaction to the woman's shockingly rude behaviour to her superior, but the detective's expression hadn't changed. "Then perhaps there is evidence in the scene that may assist us in capturing them," he suggested calmly. "I was asked to come all the way here, Miss Donovan, do not think I am leaving without at least looking at the room. And I would like to speak to Lady Brackenstall."
John groaned immediately, caving in around Sherlock's head but being careful not to tug on his hair. Understanding the desperate, urgent arousal John must be feeling, he set up a quick, firm rhythm with his mouth and smiled at the verbal response that tumbled out of the doctor's mouth. "Fuck," John cursed, taking one hand out of Sherlock's hair and bracing himself against the wall. "Oh, Sherlock, fuckfuckfuckfuck
"Sally! You're… there's a… personal space… Sally, please." He turned back quickly to turn the page on the book again; how many more pages were there? Why did he have to take so many notes?
"Good deduction," John congratulates. Then he remembers that he isn't. "No, I'm not," he objects loudly. "Not really. I only had two. Three. Four, at most. I'm just tired, mostly. I'm off to bed."
The Doctor smiled sadly. "No, it's not," he said offhandedly. "I tried to write it once, but the manuscript wouldn't fit into a publisher's envelope.
. "Sherlock! I'd only just got to sleep!"
The ex-army doctor who had so grotesquely convoluted Sherlock's heart stared at him incredulously. Julien sat back, his careful, serene smile fixed on his face, and watched the cogs grinding painfully behind Doctor Watson's blue eyes with some amusement. Naturally the good doctor was suspicious; Julien had made no attempt to hide the fact that he had an ulterior motive for Doctor Watson having the journal. Slowly, though, the stocky man wove his way to the conclusion that there was no real harmful effect of Sherlock having the journal, and that he
Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:
, he reasoned to himself, yanking the door open violently. "What'd you forget?" he asked the knocker before the door was fully open.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him, but he was still smirking. "Only two people were drinking the wine, but they poured the dregs from both of their glasses into the third to make it appear as though all three had been used."
"That one." The range attendant hooks the stuffed animal off the shelf and hands it over; it's a floppy St Bernard, the red medical cross stark on its collar. John knows Sherlock's probably trying to make a joke, but he feels touched anyway. "Thank you, John," the detective says as they walk away.
John couldn't hold back the snort; he was joined by at least half the class. McAuliffe idly turned to face the two of them while John frantically tried to make his face co-operate with him to force the smile off itself. Bill, however, smiled back innocently until the teacher grunted slightly and turned away. "Right. Seventh-form statistics and modelling. Our plan for the year starts with a refresher of some very basic algebra…"
"A young man. Bad-tempered. Detective Inspector Dimmock, have you heard of him?"
John looked at the young Vulcan in surprise. "I think some sort of promotion might be in order, Captain," he suggested. "It sounds as though T'Penya has saved all of our lives."
It was barely twenty minutes before the other boy was knocking on his door and entering without ceremony. Sherlock tried to face him with a vaguely cheerful expression as he sat down on the bed. Julien wasn't fooled.
. I rushed him into something he wasn't ready for."
The secretary tossed him the flashlight – Sherlock caught it out of sheer luck, not expecting the throw – and crossed to the intercom speakers, quickly locating a keypad and typing in an extension number.
Lestrade raised an eyebrow, surprised to have been spoken to so sweetly. "It's my job," he said roughly, and John thought that he saw a slight red tint to the man's unshaven cheeks. "Glad I could help."
Mycroft made a disapproving noise, but left the bedroom. The moment the door shut behind him, Sherlock flopped back onto his bed.
John shifted closer to him on the sofa until their knees were pressing together, looking hesitant. "You've done an admirable job of hiding it, but… I don't think any amount of makeup could cover those bruises."
John frowned at Tobias, who was indeed tripping over the hem of his costume as the stagehand struggled to fasten the back of the dress. "We'd better go all together," he said, sharing a resigned look with the boy nonetheless. "Let the lovers go first, though."
An ironic noise issued from the speaker. "In a manner of speaking. The Vashta Nerada killed a number of people who were in spacesuits, and they managed to hold the spacesuits up and use them to move, and use the ghosting communicators to speak. These ones won't be able to do that."

Sherlock's nostrils flared.
steal his heart, whether he likes it or not. Just give me time."
Sherlock frowned. "But it's only going to take them twenty minutes to get in?"
The searching eyes widened in surprise, the slight smile tugging wider. "Have they been talking about me already?" he asked. Sherlock looked around at his classmates; he should have guessed that they would try to warn the new kid away from him. He shrugged contemptuously.

John laughed, but it sounded forced. "You just… don't seem to be interested in sex at all," he said, shrugging lightly. He rested his chin on the sensitive spot just beneath the head of Sherlock's penis, grinning as Sherlock made a strangled noise and shifted his hips restlessly.
, who looked over this chapter as a historical consultant.
At once the little man went from grovelling to disdainful. "Do you have proof?" he asked stubbornly.
John sits on his armchair by the fire and watches, feeling his eyelids strain downwards. He just needs fifteen minutes of sleep and he'll be good to go. But of course, every time he's just about to drift off Sherlock starts up again.
"Ireland, of course," Matt interrupted. "Sorry. I was trying to place your accent." Jim smiled shallowly at him. "So you're going to be a lawyer, then?"
They were greeted with another hearty cheer and round of applause as they entered the pub, a fair portion of their audience having apparently beaten them there. Sherlock smiled awkwardly as half the packed pub patted him on the back and praised his performance with lascivious looks until Will took pity on him and dragged him to the bar, bellowing at the crowd to leave his actors alone.
John felt his stomach sink slightly and tried not to let his disappointment show on his face. "Ah," he said instead. He paused to allow the man to offer his own name; when he didn't, John rocked uncomfortably on the balls of his feet. "Right. Well. That was all you needed, wasn't it, Sherlock?" he distracted lamely.
Sherlock made him wait for the response, slowly crossing to the chair and perching on the edge with his chin on his hands.

Whew. Next chapter probably won't be as long, smutty, or fast, but I still think I've proved that I can write quickly when I'm inspired.
The playwright tipped his head to one side, considering John thoughtfully. "I was told he was a loner," he said after a moment's thought. "And yet since you two met, you've barely spent a moment apart. You rehearse together, you're solving this crime thing together, and even when you were performing and he wasn't he would stop whatever he was doing to watch. I think he'll be game."

expression, which Sherlock didn't believe a word of after his earlier confession.
Sherlock smiled back without looking away from the window. "Remember what?" he asked. "That I met you at that swimming pool the day after Carl Powers died, and I kissed you and we…" John blinked. Sherlock smirked.
He sighed contentedly and stretched out his sated muscles, wincing as a trickle of come ran down his side at the movement and wiping it with his fingers before it reached the bed. He would clean up afterwards, of course, but he didn't have the energy quite yet and he didn't want to be lying in a pool of his own spunk until he did –
John gaped at Sherlock as the detective swept off, his black coat billowing dramatically as he turned abruptly on the spot with another call of, "Come on, John!"
in it, but it's a fool's excuse," the detective said scathingly. "Coincidence can only be the answer when you have eliminated every other possibility, and you two haven't done that. It's far more likely that Lady Carfax's
John blinked. "Um. I guess," he said blankly. He'd been in Sally's class last year, but they'd never talked or anything, and Sally didn't strike him as shy. "Aren't there people she's… you know… closer to who could do it? I mean, I don't mind doing it or anything, it's just… unexpected."
John grimaces. "Well. He heard that. I think he took it a little bit too literally." The DI raises a sceptical eyebrow and so John tells him everything, from Brighton Beach to the argument when they got home to the completely failed attempt at intimacy, to Sherlock wanting to sleep with him to refusing to make him eat until he passed out to this morning at Mycroft's thank-you ceremony. Lestrade's dark eyes leak sympathy as he listens, tutting and sighing every now and then in all the right places. "I just have no idea what to do," he finishes quietly. "Every time I think maybe we're settling out again, getting back to normal, something happens and one of us freaks out and moves away again."
John would do this time that he had not last time, another element to kissing to which Sherlock had been hitherto unexposed? He tried opening his own mouth further, inviting John's tongue into him, but the doctor did not take the bait, remaining resolutely tight-lipped.
He wanted to say something to Sherlock, to comment on the newcomer's choice of attire or the way Molly's eyes were wide and soft like a dog gazing upon its master, but as soon as the detective had sat down beside him John was on his feet again as the hopeless Toby Belch, and that scene ran so smoothly into the next he wasn't quite sure how he would even have a chance to change costume between his last line as Belch and his first as Duke Orsino.

"So," John tried once they had closed his front door behind them. "You said 'where you're staying' - are you not living there permanently?"
She shifted in her seat, her blue eyes darting from Sherlock to the bloodstain on the carpet. The detective continued to watch her as she lifted a hand to shoo away her maid and her sleeve slipped back to reveal three red welts on her forearm. Sherlock made an exclamation, crowding in closer. The maid, too, took a deep breath in as though she had not noticed the marks before. "But my Lady," Sherlock exclaimed, reaching for the offending forearm and being slapped away. "You have other injuries!"
– well, John was watching
. Sherlock
he shouted angrily,
The DI frowned awkwardly. "Mainly the lack of the tape that was on the last one."
"Of course you didn't," Sherlock said, a little more sharply than John had expected. "I know that me spending time with Molly is a soft spot for you."
," he pressed. "If you'd come to find me I might not have looked in that room at all."
he relented finally, letting out his breath with forced composure,
They finished the rest of the packet of Cauldrons and another cup of tea each before Sherlock finally got up and held his wand at the ready. John smiled fondly at the expression of desperate concentration on his face. The thought briefly crossed John's mind that he'd like to hold him close and kiss him until he calmed down before he pushed it violently away. From the throwaway comments Sherlock had given him throughout their association it sounded as though he was the first friend the younger student had tried to make in a very long time. He couldn't ruin that friendship, especially not so soon after Sherlock had admitted it existed. He watched instead as Sherlock brandished his wand and cried,
Slightly startled, Sherlock nodded briskly. "Exactly. So." He looked at the Doctor expectantly. "What kind of extra-terrestrial item would someone want to hide in a place like this?"
"It'll die down once they get used to school again," he replied. "Though I'd keep your sexuality under wraps, if I were you."
"There are so many different ways a script could showcase your chemistry and skill together, choosing just one for this play was difficult. I hope you'll let me write more for the two of you."
Sherlock had spent a fair bit of time in the Restricted Section since having the idea, and he'd read stories about how foul drinking Polyjuice potion was. He'd been ready to pinch his nose and force himself to swallow a terrifically nasty-looking and –smelling concoction, but once he had dropped one of John's hairs into it, the little bottle turned the sandy yellow-blond colour of the hair and gave off a smell like peanut-butter and petrichor. It was very

Miracle's eyebrows lifted. "She attended the same drawing class as Lady Brackenstall," he told them, sounding genuinely surprised. "I had no idea she was missing - she didn't attend every class as it was."
"Shh," John cut him off, placing a finger over his lips. They parted underneath it as Sherlock made an odd noise, the words stopping dead in his throat. "I don't think we're supposed to," he told the taller boy.

Sherlock smiled thinly. "My first night at Hogwarts. The moment that it sank in that I was somewhere safe, that Professor McMillian
The detective smiled politely, clasping demure hands in front of his chest.
John insisted that he help clean up after they had eaten, which devolved rapidly into a rather childish battle of John splashing him with the dishwater and Sherlock flicking him with the tea-towel in response, and so it was in amiable, slightly giggly quiet that they collapsed on the sofa, John reaching automatically for the television remote and then realising that the coffee table was on the other side of the room. He sighed. "Sherlock, can we…"
The Irish boy shrugged. "I have to go. It's not like he's somebody I
Sherlock shrugged idly. "You mentioned living close to where we met. I came back to where that happened and asked someone if they knew where you lived. I knew you'd been here long enough for your neighbours to know you." He gave a sudden, almost cursory smile as John processed the information, then waved the scripts in the air. "Shakespeare came to the place I'm staying in at the moment and gave me my first act's cue-scripts, I just wanted to talk them over with you. If you're not busy," he added, though the expression on his face made it quite clear that he already knew John wasn't.
My phone goes off from the table. I flinch at the noise, and Mrs Hudson jumps; to cover up her reaction, she giggles sheepishly and then gets up to check it. "You don't mind, dear, do you? It might be John."
"I thought you two were getting
Sherlock ignores him, picking up his violin again. John bites out a soft 'Mycroft' in reply and tries to convince himself he's imagining the knowing smirk on the elder Holmes' face. He grits his teeth, preparing himself for the slaughtering of the elm-wood instrument that invariably chases Mycroft out the door. When, after a few moments, neither brother makes any noise at all, John sighs and breaks the silence. "Did you come here for a reason, or do you just like our company?"
Thanks to
Naturally, John's eyes followed it. "Did you… er… need a hand with that?"
He thought he'd rather like being attracted to Holmes as a man. Then his mind sat back and admired the singularity of that sentence for a moment. He only just managed not to snigger childishly to himself.
He couldn't keep his hands away from his – John's – skin, the feel of it on his fingers, the way they were
He asked if I would help him pack up his things and I said,
Sherlock bowed his head ashamedly, hoping that John would leave it at that, but apparently he had exhausted his supply of luck for the afternoon, because John smelt the remnants of the potion once more and his frown intensified. "Hang on," he said slowly. "Peanut butter – doesn't the Polyjuice potion smell like something that reminds the drinker of the person they're – whose hair did you have access to who eats peanut butter every morning, except for…"
John frowned; that didn't seem particularly wise. If he had to leave the theatre unexpectedly to pursue a case, the worst that could happen was that they would have to cancel the play. If he had to leave a case un-solved to perform in a play, it was possible that people's lives may hang in the balance; in this case, the life of a lady so highly thought-of that the Queen was invested in finding her. He directed the frown towards Sherlock, who gave him a reassuring grin. "Send Constable Lestrade and his assistant to Sussex," the detective suggested. "I expect we'll find more through the maid than we would from the inn, but the Constable can make inquiries there for us, perhaps take a look around her rooms, though I suspect they've tidied them already. Any evidence that might once have been found there will have been cleaned away in preparation for the inn's next guest."
Sherlock looked up in surprise at the question; he hadn't thought that he looked out of sorts. When he caught John's eyes, though, they were wide with concern. He smiled bewilderedly. "Of course, John," he assured him.
that the younger boy was struggling with some of the practical work, but Sherlock hadn't commented so he'd ignored it out of respect for his pride. Sherlock was the smartest person John had ever met and he knew it. He recognised how much courage it would have taken to admit his weakness to anyone.
John, as usual, struggles to keep up as the detective races out the door, pressing the phone to his ear and almost tripping over the last step and landing on his face.
The detective's face brightened considerably. "Chislehurst," he supplied. "The Abbey Grange."
He shook his head. "I hated myself for not going. The moment I realised it was too late to change my mind I knew I should have gone. I was the first person you'd ever wanted, you said, and when you trusted me I stood you up."
John laughed. "Yes, you do," he said, and there was a strange note to his voice. Sherlock watched him curiously as a black cab pulled up beside them. "Well, you fixed my leg the first time we met. Must have seen something you could use in me."
"Yes, I thought there was," John mused. He wondered what had happened to Lestrade and his unusual assistant. "Still, though - he wants to rehearse with you?"
me," she said, her voice breaking. "I thought about it too. Of
The detective grinned. "Usually, no. But I couldn't break in with a Constable right beside me. If he didn't arrest me on the spot then he could be implicated. So they left, and I thought I may as well come back here. We'll go back tomorrow, it looks like there's a class there in the morning. You could join us," he added, flashing John a smile. No doubt Sherlock knew the exact likelihood of John turning that down. "Molly and I are meeting here at noon to look at
John grinned. "Fancy seeing you here," he said brightly, glad to have taken the spotlight away from Sherlock for a moment. "You look good, how's life treating you?"
By the time the two of them stopped dancing around each other Sherlock had a great many ideas as to how that might come about; almost as many, he found out after the fact, as John's online fan community. Though, he consoled himself, Lewis Carroll would have a hard time being more inventive than that group of giggling, lyrical teenage girls.
John smiled weakly. "Thanks," he said. "I, um… I think I'll go upstairs. I'd mostly finished anyway, and I'd like a few minutes away from Bill – I think he's just as shocked as I am."
John rolls his eyes. "Well, I'm sure it won't be a stretch for the World's Only Consulting Detective."
Lestrade's mouth fell open. "Um," he said coherently. "No, none of that."
"John," Sherlock attempts. "This isn't like breaking into Joe Harrison's flat or Soo-Lin Yao's. There is a definite chance I might end up in prison for this one."
The three of them turned towards the newcomer, who took one of each of the two younger actors' hands in both of his own.
She shrugged. "A few people saw you rescue the new kid from Carl Powers. A few other people have their own stories of being rescued." John kept frowning, and so Sophia laughed idly. "Um… if you're… I
To his credit, Lestrade seemed to recover from his embarrassment, merely rolling his eyes at the detective and flapping a dismissive hand. "Fine," he said wearily. "I'll be in touch when I've spoken to your brother again, and I know when I might go to Sussex to see the inn."
" he called, stepping close enough to stroke a finger down his bare arm. Ben seemed to hesitate, clearly looking at the door through which Titania had just left, before he skipped over to John's side. John placed his hand indulgently back on his shoulder, smiling slightly as the boy leaned into the touch. He held him carefully away for the poetic direction of his next monologue.
be cruel and violent, I've shown that, but I wouldn't be, not to her."
"Thank God," Sherlock muttered, sliding elegantly into the seat beside Lestrade and pulling it away from the table so that he could lounge idly in it, looking far less concerned than he really was. Something definitely wasn't right – and yet so much

"Molly is fine," Ben replied, stammering slightly and flushing. "It doesn't matter, really - only most people around here call me Molly."

The doctor grinned as he took the cup of coffee, sipping tentatively and then smiling at the lack of sugar and hallucinogens. "Right," he said cheerfully. "So where are we going?"
Sherlock lifted his eyebrows, his eyes following John's. "Go on, then," he said quietly. "I don't mind. I need to see her strangling him as well, I'll need you here."
John, too, watched the frown lines deepen on the detective's forehead. "I do," he said, turning his frown on the man behind the counter. "You cannot sell it, of course."

John frowned, grinning despite himself. "I'm too
His friend waved a hand to cut him off. "Come with me," he said instead, holding out the hand to help John to his feet and sweeping towards the door.
John forced a smile at his young friend. "I haven't been here long," he assured him. "I just wanted to speak to Sherlock for a moment, then I'll let the two of you get back to it."

John made an embarrassing sort of squeaking noise when Sherlock suddenly grabbed his waist and tugged him over until he was sprawled on the taller boy's lap, a very
John thundered, rising from the stump the moment they had left. Ben fell off the prop and scrambled humbly to his knees.
Sherlock made an affirmative humming noise. "Secondary, but desperately anticipated," he replied.
"No." We stare each other down for a moment, then she reaches for the telephone. I roll my eyes. "Lady Hilda, I'm trying to work
Sherlock's head shifted, his nose twitching into John's underarm and breathing in the surely unpleasant scent there. "Yes," he said quietly, his voice vibrating through John's clothes.

Sorry for the delay. It's the last week of the semester here, which means that I've written three essays in the last two weeks. I finished this while procrastinating from study for the two tests I have on Thursday. The plus side of this is that after Thursday I'm done for the year so nothing to do but update! More sex soon, I promise.
John wasn't sure what to make of the fact that

was going on there. He desperately hoped it was what he thought it was.
Hannah, the petite dark-skinned woman, smiled shyly back at Sherlock. "Kirsty's not in the English or History department," she explained. "She doesn't understand the romanticism of an Old Earth tower library. Surely you must, Mr…"
he called, holding out his arms and delighting a little when the detective obediently trotted over to him.
John returned the laugh, and they walked in quiet down a few streets, before John's curiosity overcame his respect of the other actor's apparent dislike of explaining himself. "Why didn't you become a Justice of the Peace, then? I mean, you're solving crimes now. Clearly you're brilliant at it. Why not do it in an official capacity?"
"What are
she could be simply acting on principle - maybe one rich and arrogant dominant treated her badly and she's getting back at the stereotype without having much knowledge of BDSM herself."
"Damn right, Mr Holmes, sir. He's refused the bath since we picked him up."
The detective frowned at him, his tone defensive.
John's hand sliding down his stomach through the come already pooled there and past his penis as it hardened before his eyes, trailing along his testicles and back. It felt forbidden and just a little voyeuristic, but Sherlock had promised himself he wouldn't think about the questionable ethics of what he was doing until it had finished, so he pushed that thought out of his head and skated his fingers over his perineum instead, forcing a grunt from his throat. He wanted to know every
"He does," John agreed. "I can't help but feel extremely flattered by his attention. I have yet to actually see him act, but this side of his life certainly seems to fit his talent."
He'd had
John murmured through the lump in his throat. He'd always known that Sherlock
had done it when Sherlock had expressly asked him not to made him fight to keep the irritation off his face. Even in a dominant/submissive dynamic – he wouldn't call this any kind of relationship – there were things that one did not do, liberties one did not take, requests that one did not ignore. He completely agreed with John's assumption that Charles Trent wouldn't quite understand the difference between BDSM and sexual abuse, but that didn't mean he liked it. He smiled weakly at John nonetheless when he was set back on his feet, conveying submission as clearly as he could. "
They settled down into a comfortable silence, watching the flames jump cheerfully in the fireplace. "They probably talked for quite a while," Sherlock said finally, leaning back on the sofa and tucking his feet up underneath him. "For Stephens to be comfortable enough with her to treat her the way he would have treated his long-term girlfriend, they would have formed an emotional connection. She probably played along thinking that as soon as he got her on her own he'd turn nasty."
He blinked. "What – you really do want me to tutor you, then?" he asked. She smiled shyly.

Tobias despite his acting and preferred to see him happy.
The youth stopped running, doubling over whatever it was still clutched in his hands, obscuring it from John's view as he gasped for breath. John leaned against a nearby wall, affecting a casual pose but still ready to react if the man tried anything. After a moment of heaving and panting, the dark-haired man pushed off the wall and made to dodge past him.
. If you want to read the whole play, which I am always going to recommend (and not just because this chapter may read better if you do), you can find an online copy
he asked, Orsino's interest piqued despite himself. John tried not to look back at Will, remembering every story of his oldest friend's romantic conquests - eagerly listened to despite the horrible knife of jealousy each word drove into his heart. Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him; John patted his knee as he sat on the chair, as though inviting his companion to sit there. Will Kemp sniggered from the stage door, but John ignored him.
"Celine," she obliged.
- what if I make a mistake? I haven't prepared!"
Sherlock before he could decide how they could handle this.
Sherlock awkwardly took hold of the hand resting on top of his. "I know you do. You've lost someone recently, haven't you? And they're not the first." He frowned as the other man met his eyes. "You've had a long life, us humans just can't keep up. Eventually you have to leave us behind."
John's mouth had fallen slowly open throughout the speech; he closed it. "That's exactly what I thought! You were such a

When everyone cleared out their trays and started out towards the dorm, John found Jim hanging back slightly. "I don't have anything to contribute or anything," he said, shrugging. He sounded slightly hesitant, but not ashamed, just a sort of calm resignation.
speeches that they all start to blend in together even as he listens to the next one. He sits patiently and pretends to listen while the detective rolls his eyes in a decidedly unsympathetic way and Mrs St. Claire runs herself down into a few short bursts of tears. "Sorry," she finishes pathetically.
The look intensifies, becomes something strange. "Never. But it's always been a problem for

The comment earned him a light slap on the arm. "Of course

allowed to be there. He had no official agreement giving him the title of consultant for the police, which made him a civilian. It wasn't one of the Yard's most enforced rules. He merely smiled at the woman and crossed one leg over the other in a casual sort of way.
Molly nodded and reset himself on the stage, taking a deep, calming breath. John snorted helplessly, and the younger boy suppressed a smile with difficulty.
John stands up and measuredly makes his way over to his friend, his heartbeat so violent he can feel it in the pit of his stomach. When he stands in front of him, the man reaches forward and takes his hand. "Feel me," he says, still in the same soft, serious voice, placing the doctor's hand firmly on his neck, cupping his jaw, fingertips against the pulse-point. John takes in a deep breath; Sherlock's pulse is frighteningly fast. The detective moves the hand up to his cheekbone, letting John feel the heat of the blush spread across the bone and pressing his face into the contact, closing his eyes.
When he was gone, Sherlock glanced at his violin. Mrs Hudson had ever-so-subtly gifted him the sheet music for Sarasate's
and out to sabotage his burgeoning relationship with Sherlock was somewhat amusing. He had to admit the look on that weathered face that suggested he would dearly like to throw Julien out of a window for past transgressions left him slightly breathless. "Very well," he conceded. "And which item were you interested in? I am afraid I cannot part with the snuff box for anything contained within the depth of
Watson, what
. These last twenty-four hours, since the explosion and the message from the bomber, had been quite possibly the worst experience that John had had since coming back from Afghanistan, and that included the night before he met Sherlock, when he'd sat for an hour with his eyes travelling between his empty blog and his loaded gun. The challenge of the bomber, with whom Sherlock claimed to have so much in common, had thrown the detective into a new state of sociopathic mania, and every time he made a flippant comment that showed his apparent disregard for the fates of other human beings John couldn't help but think it was his fault.
"Shakespeare," Miracle concluded. John nodded, grinning. "You did
"That's amazing," John said, staring at the thought. Sherlock shifted self-consciously, his mouth twitching into a hesitant smile. "Just think, you could read your favourite book for the first time as often as you liked."
The blonde boy was in the corridor again, this time accompanied by only one girl. Sherlock rolled his eyes. It wasn't even one of the girls from yesterday, but he had her pressed up against the wall between two doors – neither of which were his – and had his tongue half in her mouth, and half lolling grotesquely in the space between their mouths. He wasn't sure how, but she seemed to be enjoying it. Julien raised an eyebrow in distaste.
Julien bent his head further to lick at Sherlock's collarbone, then carefully sank to his knees until his face was level with Sherlock's crotch, his cold fingers still dancing over the cotton of his pants. Sherlock tried to slow his breathing down, but gave it up as a bad job when he started to feel lightheaded.
