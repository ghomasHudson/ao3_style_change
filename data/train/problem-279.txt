He went to bed by himself, utterly wrung out in a way he hadn't been, since he and Sherlock ran through London streets together, chasing criminals and, perhaps, each other.
"It's for us," John told him. "If we manage this, we'll be safe." He could feel Sherlock's breath on his face. He pushed his hand into the curls at Sherlock's temple. Sherlock closed his eyes, and leaned into the touch.
Later that night, back at Baker Street, Sherlock took the stairs one at a time, his arm looped around John's waist, John's thrown over Sherlock's shoulder, the two of them negotiating the climb together. The familiar shapes of their chairs waited for them in the sitting room, where Sherlock lit a fire against the chill of the late winter night. He made buttered noodles with parmesan and oregano, a simple supper, which John ate in silence, wondering what would happen between them. Despite the throbbing ache of his leg, and the syrupy quality of his limbs from his post-dinner painkiller, he couldn't stand the thought of not touching Sherlock, not being with him, in his bed, now that they were finally alone together.
Mark was still hard against John's thigh. He put his hand on the side of John's neck, and squeezed. "Oh, this isn't Jim's game any more. Or at least, the players are different, and the reasons for it have changed, love."
The whole thing had been over before it had even begun. And John had been an absolute fool, believing that Sherlock wanted him, believing that he'd taken John underground in order to seduce him.
He was certainly interested in taking photographs: he had loads of pictures on his phone. There were lots of Bainbridge, and also of Sholto, of his secluded property out in the country, and of the members of his staff, coming and going. He'd done his research, Jonathan Small. He'd planned carefully.
John woke up with the alarm, seven thirty the next morning, with Mark pressed up against his back, Mark's arm slung over his waist. His eyes fluttered open. He was still heavy with sleep, and a dull, aching wish that things had gone differently.
A huge device, four-chambered, like a heart, sat under the floor. John's breath caught. They were in serious trouble. More than he could have wished for.
Mark was breathing like he was running a race, rock hard and leaking in John's hand. "I'll tell you where you're going and what you're doing. Wherever the hell you want. Whatever you want. That's the point of a life like ours. It can all be yours, John. Just, marry me, and the ones who are still in it will trust you enough to get you started. They've been keeping an eye on you. Waiting for you to come over to their way of thinking."
The silence stretched itself out, and John remembered the first awkward, tentative conversation the two of them had had, three weeks previous, a few feet away from where he now sat. He'd had so much hope then. He'd been blinded by it, and he'd gone too far. This was his chance to make it better, to allow Sherlock an out, offer him a place in his life that he could, perhaps, be comfortable with.
"Sorry." John hadn't imagined that, in simply trying to see Sherlock, he would end up dragging Mark into the most dangerous part of his old life. Not this soon, anyway.
John longed to go to Baker Street, and talk, and make plans. Discuss what had happened. Discuss everything.
"Listen to me. Sherlock, please, just listen." He squeezed Sherlock's hand again, and took a step closer.
Sherlock's expression shifted then, transformed by the biggest smile John had ever seen him wear, and he wheezed, as if he couldn't let his laughter out fast enough, and it was choking him.
Sherlock pressed his lips together. If John hadn't been staring, trying to take in every detail he could, he might have missed the way Sherlock's chin seemed to tremble. His eyes were on John, steady, asÂ he spoke. "Oh, nothing so global. Outside world, as in, events outside myself." He fiddled with his fork, turning it so it flashed in the candlelight. "For example, John Watson is getting married. Set aside an evening to celebrate him."
It wasn't anything like John had imagined, the many times he'd pictured this, or dreamed of it. He'd always thought Sherlock would sweep him away in a fit of intense passion, overwhelm him physically. John always pictured disappearing beneath Sherlock, as Sherlock rolled over him like the tide.
He turned to watch the van drive closer, Mark's face, his customary grin, clearly visible through the windscreen. Mark wasn't above killing civilians. John took a step back, and held very still, his hands out at his sides, his grand plan, such as it was, over before it had begun.
His heart squeezed as he waited for Sherlock's reply, wondering if even now, he had figured it out, and was preparing to chase Mark through the streets, hiding his real activities from John again.
John sighed heavily. Stag night would certainly not be happening, although he imagined he might need a drink, or all the drinks, by the time Thursday rolled around. He had to play along, though, even though his patience was wearing thin. And Sherlock's mention of stag night had sparked a question in him.
Sherlock enfolded John's hand in both of his, and the air grew thick and warm around John, as Violet and Sherlock began to discuss tracking devices. Their voices became murmurs, Violet's high pitched, melodious, full of hard American consonants and short vowels, Sherlock's a low, dense river that John found himself wanting to float away on.
John wondered if he should offer assurances. There were, he knew, no guarantees. This was war, the secret war that Sherlock had always fought. "I'll try to be safer."
Evening birdsong filtered down through the trees, a thrush, saying a last late goodnight, as John raised the gun, and thumbed the safety off. He crept forward, moving carefully, as noiselessly as he could, in the direction of the sounds he'd heard. If he and Sherlock could only find each other, they might finally be okay. He hit the edge of the trees, and worked his way slowly between them, advancing a few feet at a time.
Sherlock turned sharply, went over to the window, and stared out through it. Petulant. Or, maybe just embarrassed, like any son of excitable parents.
He thought he was ready, but as he ran a damp mop over the floors in the kitchen and sitting room, he battled with the idea that it was entirely possible that he would not last through two minutes of scrutiny. He wondered if he should have done more research on Mark, while he had the flat to himself. He wondered if it would be wise, or entirely stupid, to go check the security tablet one last time.
John greeted the first day of the new year with grim determination. He moved through the flat, trying to do normal, everyday things, all the while painfully conscious that Mark was coming home soon.
Cath came up to the front desk, a cup of coffee in hand. "Checking to make sure your holiday's all set?" She smiled at John. "I can't believe the two of you get three whole weeks off together."
Meanwhile, John's heart urged him to grasp onto the other thing Mrs. Hudson had said. "He talks about me? He does?"
"Apologise later. Or don't. Perhaps we need to move past apologies, John. We have better things to spend our breath on, don't you think?"
He stared at the words. He'd earned the right to be honest. He didn't owe an explanation to anyone, but he owed himself that clarity. He'd hesitated when he'd written the post last night, he realised, because he'd never said it aloud, or written it in a public venue. He'd never even said it to Sherlock, not even when Sherlock had asked about Mark, not even through the difficult conversation of yesterday. It did matter, though. It was who he was. It was time to own it.
He supposed that act of grace was part of the same track he'd been on since he'd met Sherlock. There had been so many luminous, unforgettable moments along the way: the day they met, and the next day, when they decided to move into 221B together. The first hints of real understanding between them. The cases and the wild solutions and the sense that they'd done something good. The trip to Dartmoor, the bed they'd shared, in the
Sherlock gasped and shuddered and spilled out over John's hand, John's name on his tongue, then half climbed onto John and kissed his lips raw, taking John's breath, and giving it back, speeding his hand as John bucked into it, as John came, burning and alive and full of love for the man who smiled above him, and leaned down to kiss his lips again, tenderly this time, and softly.
He erased those sentences, his heart pounding, regretting typing them instantly, trapped between his own, private truth, and all the resolutions he'd made, to deal with the consequences of his life and choices, one at a time.
Relief flooded through him as the wooden pallets and branches were pulled aside, and sweet, pure, cold night air poured over him. He tried to move; found he couldn't, not yet. It was all right though, because Sherlock's hands gripped him under his shoulders, and dragged him from the fire.
John was still staring at the suitcases when Mark came downstairs. "Don't you dare open those," he said.
John had to wonder what was in it for Mark, standing by John's side all these months, while John mourned for Sherlock, while he failed to sort himself out. It couldn't have been fun. John had never managed to be a good partner. He couldn't imagine what would motivate Mark to stick with him, especially now that Sherlock was back.
Sherlock nodded. "It seems so." He frowned, brow furrowing. "I haven't been able to account for why, but there's been no new activity for a couple of weeks. Whatever was going on seems to have settled down substantially."
"Shall we?" Mark said. "I'd like to chat to you a bit before the dancing starts. Somewhere quiet." He wore the same confident look he always did, as if he were constantly on the verge of saying
Whatever happened next, John was determined to keep the details of his discoveries away from Sherlock. The murder of Baccarin's wife proved to John that Sherlock was in just as much danger as he was. If Mark had set his sights on John as a new partner in crime, then Sherlock could become collateral damage, just like Olivia Baccarin had.
The preliminary details were sorted quickly. Cath, or Agent Violet Smith, rather, had been working with MI6 for the last eight months, trying to identify and, as she put it,
John sat up, and turned on the lamp on his bedside table. Mark squinted against the light, watching John steadily.
When he was almost back home, he deviated from his usual route. He had no reason to be anywhere in particular. He kept riding, as the afternoon gave way to a beautiful evening, the dusky sky crowded with thick clouds that scudded through the deep blue, like so many flat-bottomed boats. Might as well stay out a little while longer.
John's mind fluttered, briefly, over the idea of a far future, in which he and Sherlock might consider retiring to a village like the one George lived in. "Thanks," he said. "Drink? It's, uh, on us."
Whatever had happened in the moments leading up to Baccarin's murder, John understood, from reading his files, that three years ago, he had taken an abrupt turn into criminality. Up until then, he'd led what appeared to be a normal life. He'd been married, no kids. The only anomaly, a gun hobby. Nothing illegal: he'd owned a licensed weapon, and held a membership at a London shooting range.
And then, making John feel a thousand times worse about everything, came a comment from Mark, about thirty from the end:
"Well," John said, his voice coming out strained, as he turned and looked out the cab window. "Everything."
John looked down at his hands. Easier than he thought. Mark had already talked to Sherlock, of course. He'd been expecting the question. He'd prepared himself. "Thanks. Great. That'sâgreat." His knuckles were white.
He climbed into bed, and settled against the pillows, limbs heavy, suddenly more tired than he'd ever been.
An image arose, unbidden, unwanted, of Sherlock's face, pale and miserable, as he told John that John would be happy. John wasn't sure that happiness was something he was seeking any more. Maybe some sort of equilibrium was the best he could hope for, he thought, as he continued digging.
Reading about the case had made him wish he'd been able to help with it, so he could write it up. He missed the blog. He'd even thought of a title:
He could end this tonight, if he was smart. All he needed, all he'd been holding out for, was to understand the shape of the threat against him and Sherlock. Mark had already eliminated much of it. If John could get some sense of who was left in the network, and how invested they were in the plan to destroy Sherlock, they might finally be free.
, he thought. They could enjoy the show, or not. He kissed Mark's lips, and pressed their bodies together, his skin tingling, his heart light.
Sherlock let John go, and took a step back, his hands fluttering in front of him, as if he couldn't decide what to do with them.
Once the cabbie got him back home he thrust a few bills at him through the driver's side window and with unsteady legs headed to the door.
"But I think we should look at that passage again because over the years one word has stood out for me just as it was meant to do. Dubious. Dubious means untrustworthy, suspect, questionable. Now what this tells me is that something I see as a plus, as a bonus, as a gift afforded to people who aren't alcoholics isn't that at all. This "luxury" isn't anything of the sort. Now, the book categorizes us more than once as the opposite of "normal" which I suppose means we're abnormal. I've never really liked that classification but I do find it especially helpful here. Because normal or abnormal we're all human and anger poisons us all the same. I believe the point that we should be understanding is that it poisons
For a while, a few hours, in fact, he was able to lose himself in it all. When one book was no longer cutting it he closed it and switched to another and another, finally settling on the post-rehab text Hanah had loaned him. Grabbing his pad of paper he began to make half-hearted notes, hoping against hope he'd feel the tug of sleep on his eyelids. But it wasn't working. If anything he found himself getting more tuned up, more agitated. He felt itchy, his muscles were twitching and he speculated that maybe his body had gotten used to his early morning exercise. He's missed out on the treadmill today due to having overslept and he figured he was paying for it now.
"Why?" John asked incredulously. "Because it's you. It's always been you. I don't want to be me without you. Not anymore. But I understand if you don't-"
Rosie who was still wailing and struggling in John's arms let out a screech once the door closed and Harry was no longer in sight.
"Your drinking ramped up considerably after your wife's death and then again after the assault in the morgue. Except there was aÂ changeover."
In the bottom right-hand corner was the message âIf you want my help, write to me at 221B Baker Street, London - SHâ
He'd been putting it off as long as possible but he worried his fear had let the situation already edge into rudeness. That wasn't even counting how rude he had been before sending that last email.
What little money remained, of course, went to his daughter. He left the house to Sherlock, trusting him to see it would be sold and whatever funds could be gotten also left to Rosie and Harry for her care. He willed most of his possessions to Sherlock and few to his daughter. She wouldn't grow up knowing him so he saw little reason to leave her impractical junk. No need for sentimentality. No need to feign love for the man who left her.
"They'll translate if you work them. And you're right, there is a bit of the artificial to this place. This level of help and support and the fact that you can't just pop out to a store for a drink, that matters. But I also don't think you're giving yourself enough credit. Did it ever occur to you that you're thinking more clearly now than you have in over a year? That some of the effects of all that alcohol have receded? That's not artificial, that's hard and true science. That matters. And that's what you did for you. That's sobriety and you can take that with you. I swear to you, even if nothing else here is portable,
"I just want to start off today's meeting by telling you all how proud I am of you. Every last one of you. The ones who are just starting their journey, the ones in the middle and the ones leaving us to begin a new chapter. I am proud of you because you showed up. I am proud of you because you came back. And I am proud of you because you are leaving stronger than you arrived. Because The Location like many places runs in cycles, we often have times where a big group is coming in while another group is leaving and that's where we are today. I see a lot of new faces and I see a lot of old faces that I'm going to be saying goodbye to in a short time. We're going to be handing out a few chips today and because of that, I'd like to speak to the new people first. Now we are not only glad for each and every day that you spend sober we're glad for each and every hour. There are likely going to be some days where you have to take it minute by minute and that's ok. I want to make sure you hear me when I say that's ok. Because when we hand out chips I don't want anyone to get the wrong idea that it's only the bulk days that matter. Every day matters. If you go from head-on-pillow to head-on-pillow, day to night, sunrise to sunset without a drink, congratulations, that's a victory. I'm sure you may have heard this saying before but it's no less true; This is a 'One Day at a Time' program. If you are clean and sober today, you are tied for first place in AA. You got that, everyone is this room is in first place. Give yourself a hand. Come on, right now, I know you think it's corny but do it anyway."
I wanted to watch him but it was too much, seeing his mouth on me and his hand stroking me. My hips started bucking and I was tugging on his hair again, ramrod straight and inching closer yet again.
"Can we have another go, John?" Sherlock asked and his voice was filled with such soft sincerity, so free of cheek or wit that John had to pause to swallow over the lump in his throat.
On the cab ride home his mobile began to buzz and removing it from his pocket he saw it was his sister.
"Janine. I mean she seemed happy. And, well, I only really know her through Mary but I know she's a smart, capable, active young woman who could have her pick of guy. All the things she said in the papers about your sex life..."
"We're all talking about this as though it were temporary when it could very well be chronic. This could be a permanent condition and I think we need to accept that as a reality."
"I...I remember...from the book..." He said and John could just see him gripping the sheets with his long fingers.
Sherlock nodded, content to let him do as he pleased. John took out his phone and brought up the web page of the hotel he'd investigated before they'd set out.
"I don't know. After all these years I really have no idea. If I measure it up against what I feel for you, it is dwarfed into insignificance. But then...I don't know. All I do know is that it didn't last. We lost interest in one another but the heroin kept us together after the affection burned out. He was shite at finding a vein and I'd do it for him. We lie on the bed in my room and take our own separate trips. I could sense the end coming though, and I ventured out on my own to make my own contact before he took away my supply. We broke up, I went back to being as solitary as before and sank further into my habit. Mycroft got wind of it after a few months and read me the riot act. My supplier mysteriously packed up and vanished from town and no one else would sell to me. When I was pleading for it, begging, cramped up and sweating my brother threw me into a rehab. All very hush-hush and posh, kept quite secret fromÂ our parents. He tempted me with the promise of cases when I came out and he delivered. He set up a police contact and I was funneled information that I focused on between classes. It kept me straight and it kept me busy. I also took up smoking and that helped a bit too. And so theÂ die was cast and the pattern set. So long as I remained occupied I was able to stay clean. But when my stimulation would dip, I would return to the needle and all its lovely, liquid charms."
They showered and toweled off and John was able to catch a glimpse of the time before they crawled, naked, back into bed. It was only a quarter past midnight. Still so early and so much had happened.
"Come in here right now and sit down. I won't take no for an answer." She said putting her small hand on his elbow. He let her tug him deeper into the flat and he tried to fight against the heaviness of his limbs and the desire to literally drag his feet.
A/N: More than a few of you mentioned that AO3 didn't update you that I posted two chapters last week. So, I hope you get this one! And if you haven't seen something from me in over a week, you might have missed one or two. :)
"Your friend Sholto called me, several times. He said that he'd had a troubling conversation with you that left him worrying about your mental state. But prior to that it was Mycroft." Sherlock said in reply to John's first question. "He's half of the reason I knew you were gone for good. I got a hunch. I was trying to imagine what could make you leave so abruptly in that moment. It wasn't really your style. It was almost as if you'd been triggered like in that film we watched; The Manchurian Candidate."
He pressed a slick finger against my hole and there wasÂ no part of me that seemed eager to allow him in.
"Ok, love, ok." He said opening his eyes and finding his way back to just the two of them. Holding his cock upright heÂ readied it for his partner. "Sink down, slow at first, very slow."
Sherlock ducked his head and smiled. When that didn't calm the blush heÂ hid slightly behind the menu he surely knew by heart.
"I thought we could try some place new. It's lighter fare than we're accustomed to but the pancakes were quite filling."
Sherlock had cleared the table and the room overall was still clinging valiantly to the neat state it had been in when he'd arrived back home.
"You're on hydrocodone and have been since you came back from the dentist. Your habit has been increasing exponentially. Out of fear of offending you or angering you or losing you I have avoided the subject but no more. How many have you had today?"
"I'm sorry, I thought this room was empty. It's on my sheet the occupant was checking out today." The nurse said glancing down at her paperwork.
"I'm proud of you." John opened his mouth to speak but Sherlock continued stopping him. "I know you want to add a caveat or a warning onto that. I know it's difficult for you to simply accept that. But I ask, as a favour to me and yourself, that you do. I am proud of you. Just sit with that for awhile. Or if you must say something, a simple thank you will suffice."
"No...I thought about it but ultimately made the decision it would be unwise. I was of course using prior and during everything that went on with Culverton but I stopped once that busines was concluded."
âI thought about making up something flashy, something dangerous but I froze in the moment and just said âJohn.â That wasnât deemed too offensive and in that way that things sometimes happen smoothly when youâre 17 I was accepted.â
"My pleasure. Most new patients sleep for the majority of their first day. Someone will bring in food a bit later. Your private bath is just there." He said and having taken out a small flashlight he used it as a pointer in the darkness. "Your clothes are in the cupboard there and the bureau there. And if you need anything there's a call button just there. Pleasant dreams, John."
"You going to be ok?" He asked Sherlock looking up at the face that seemed far more pained than it had an hour or so ago.
"You must think you're dealing with someone else, mate. You know how this goes as well as I do." I said evenly.
Sherlock was open and free. Sherlock had no Pandora's box. Sherlock had laid himself bare and while he missed his presence and his touch desperately the idea of being face to face with him, every day, speaking the truth, exposing his fears and pains and wants and needs was terrifying, fiery and terrifying.
I want to go home, I do. But I admit the insulated existence here has its pull. I can't just order something online and have it delivered or go to the nearest Boots and pick up a prescription. There are boundaries and rules and walls here and out there...nothing. It's going to be all up to me...again. And we see how well that worked the last time.
But once they'd parked the car he found something nearly as beautiful as his husband to catch his eye.
He felt that unmistakable adrenaline sweat start to run from his pores and it wasn't long before the collar and armpits of his t-shirt were soaked.
"You say this as if I don't know who you are," John said with a smile. "I know what I'm signing up for. And I'll likely be grouchy and short tempered, and we're going to have arguments about the weekly shop and body parts in the fridge but I'm all in, Sherlock. I've got a lot of fucking baggage but I'm all in if you'll have me."
He wasn't nearly as calm as he sounded. His cock was aching and not in that metaphorical way but truly and genuinely hurting from lack of attention. But this was a sacrifice for what he wanted and needed for both of them in the future. A Sherlock with absolutely no understanding of how his body worked would lead to dismal shagging and even worse lovemaking.
By now Sherlock was just shouting after him as John beat a fast exit out of their bedroom. He made a beeline for the sofa and settled himself in for the night.
"Oh don't be daft, John." She said turning away and walking ahead. He then started to push the shopping trolley after her.
"What did you mean about Sherlock?" He pressed trying to clear his muddied thoughts to remember what it was exactly she'd said. Whatever it was, it unnerved him.
John chuckled and quickly set the alarm on his phone for 30 minutes before he closed his eyes as well.
He thought about teasing Sherlock about the fact that she was only staying for a few hours. But he was far too touched by his boyfriends exuberant dedication to Rosie.
He'd lost the narrative thread to sex somewhere along the way, he knew that now. He knew something was missing. God knows that was what theyÂ toldÂ him in rehab and counseling and groups. Something is missing and you need to get it back. But they can never tell you what it is because it's just uniquely you. Which is as promising as it is insanely frustrating. How did he know what he was searching for when they couldn't tell him and he couldn't remember.
I'm learning in here that that's true. I have forgotten a lot of little things over the course of my life. Both genuinely and not so genuinely. There are so many things in fact that I thought it would be better off if I didn't remember.
When someone breaks a bone sometime the pieces heal together quite nicely, no intervention needed. Sometimes the alignment is off and a doctor will have to reset the fragments to get them back where they belong so as to heal properly. Reset is a pleasant, sterile word when the truth is the bones often have to be rebroken. Pressure has to be applied, manipulation too and then snap! But it's a good break, a healthy and needed restructuring of something that had gone wrong. It was the only way to start to heal.
Sherlock's gaze was almost painful, and a part of him wanted to crawl away from him, to push away from the table. This, this was why he avoided his sister like the plague.
Her mouth was still downturned in a look that nearly broke John's heart but she'd gone slightly still at least willing to see where Sherlock was going with this. Though he still couldn't see John could feel the movement of the toy on his shoulder as his partner's hand made it bound and bounce in a way that now had his daughter rapt. She sniffled and watched and John could hear little gasping noises, exaggerated sounds of surprise as Sherlock, no doubt, reacted to the 'unpredictable' antics of the small bee.
âThatâs men for you.â She said with a shake of her head before adding. âYou know, I always knew you were gay, John." Harry said and he choked slightly on his tea.
"I couldn't sleep. I've been having trouble with that lately and I thought maybe I could tire myself out."
But this was Sherlock. Sherlock was not a tease and he didn't care for games in his private life; that was reserved for business. He was moving at the pace he was most comfortable and unfortunately, that pace was glacial.
"He became increasingly worried and agitated by my behavior. He never has or will consider me to be the reasonable, stable one out of we two but he does have a chart, a level of his own creation that he uses to determine if I am what he considers to be ok. I had fallen far below his markers on that chart. This made him hover almost incessantly, it made him hostile to even the idea of John, unshakeably and revoltingly paternal towards me. And worst of all, it made him offer his assistance on my cases. I could not shake him or his neverending calls and texts."
"Let's not get ahead of ourselves. I mean, I don't know if- ...I don't think Sherlock is the marrying kind."
"I'm far too tired to shower. We'll do it in the morning." Sherlock said throwing an arm across me. "Will you stay with me, John?"
Eventually, John emerged out of the other side of that tunnel and as some of his behavior came back to him he felt the need to apologize.
He went through multiple drafts and even as he sealed the envelope he was unhappy with what he wrote.
It wasn't just paparazzi now, everyone had their phone out, everyone was recording and taking pictures and posting it to Twitter and Facebook Live and Instagram and Youtube and he felt like if he had to stay there one more moment he was going to start screaming or swinging but something, something, something had to stop this.
Mike smiled again, that smile that John used to just think was affable and kind. Now he was starting to view it as also amused and remarkably clever.
It was a very Sherlock sentence but he'd said it in such an agonized and breathy rush. John knew that feeling and knew he was barely holding on and that sort of raw desire made him want to continue.
He didn't have time to process the embrace as it happened. But later he would wonder at how stiff, it wasn't. How awkward, it wasn't. How it was natural and protective and how out of all those who had touched him after Mary had died, this touch was both the least and most painful.
Initially, it sort of panicked him. This part of him should work. It needed to work. It always worked, come hell or high water. He didn't have the nickname Three Continents Watson for nothing. Whether partnered, solo, or that one ill-conceived threesome it always worked. But not then.
"I'll not have anyone speak about my blogger like that." He said as he kissed my ear. I vaguely felt him rubbing slow circle around my hole as I closed my eyes again and went back to the story.
Seething. Seething and full of so much rage I can't even think straight. When she tries to speak I either ignore her or stare at her until she stops talking.
"But I have tried. I have tried harder at this than I have ever tried at anything before. I'm not arrogant enough to believe I am a cure-all for depression or the antidote to your addiction. But I am here. I exist. I had hoped that you might glean comfort from that but I'm not certain that you do. You seem to have one foot in this life and one in the other. I consider myself to be aÂ capable man but even I cannot fight a ghost."
"Yes, sir, just one moment." The clerk said as he typed in their information in the computer. "Sorry, gentlemen, we seem to only have one room. Must have gotten confused with the booking. My apologies. I'll see what else is available. Or maybe we can fit another single in there."
His cock was hard and had been since before his mate had entered the room. He knew the rhythm of it all now, he knew the plan and as Sherlock began to work back up his thigh, back to his arse he felt his climax approaching again.
"No, but he hasn't contacted me and apparently I've been here 30 days." He said holding up the chip.
We talked about Mary today in therapy. Not much, but a bit. It was mostly about Sherlock. As it should be. My issues are with my current relationship, aren't they? I don't think I'm carrying as much shit around about Mary as I was. I think, maybe, I let some of it go over this past year and didn't even know it. We talked about that too. The therapist echoed something Hanah had told me. I have what he called a negative script in my head. I hyper focus on the worst situations, the worst possible outcome. It makes me retreat inside myself as I wait for the other shoe to drop. And when it does it fulfills my own prophecy. That way I'm never exactly wrong and just how wrong I figure things are going to go. That makes sense to me. That sounds like me.
There was a shocked gasp from the newer people and he felt and saw some either lean in or draw back in surprise.
"So, without even thinking about the consequences I replied something like "That was indeed rude of me. Would you like to finish flirting with me over dinner? Tomorrow say eight? Maybe, get it out of your system?" She texted back "That should about do it." And that's how we started."
"I re-learned it. And she's an idiot. Everything she tells Rosie we'll have to erase. She actually said you can't see the moon in the daytime. She spoke those words."
"You...you can't just say next." He protested as he pulled his coat tighter around him. It was getting colder and both the lowering temp and the conversation were working to snap him out of that warm, slow, sad drunken state.
"Fuck..."Â He swore as the warm, wet, talented mouth enveloped him and then he remembered. Like a lightning bolt out of theÂ blue he remembered.
But Sherlock wouldn't be bossed about and instead gently removed John's hand and placed it back where it had been, clutching the blankets. He returned his attention to his lover's cock. Angling his hips Sherlock made certain to come in contact with his prostate again and again until John was begging him, clenching around him pleading for faster, harder, deeper, tighter until his body went rigid as he came.
Sherlock gave himself a few tugs and a squeeze and John couldn't wait any longer. He moved away from his boyfriend's lips and started to kiss his way down his body, pausing to speak between each one.
Any day now I expect to get an automated reply telling me my message is undeliverable. It hasn't happened yet. I suppose it's some glitch in the system. Mycroft came and collected a lot of your papers so I can't even find an old bill to shut it off.
"I worked with our boss so he'd stay in constant communication with them and I worked on my dad. Once I had everything settled I sent you out, did the drop-off and left. I knew if I stayed they'd try for more and I knew they'd hurt you in the process. So I had the word put out on the street that you'd served your purpose and I'd moved on. You were nothing to me. Just some starry-eyed pup who liked to follow me around. It was fun while it lasted but it was over."
John had to keep his lips pressed tightly together to keep the wobble to his chin at a minimum. He had cried more in this past year than he thought possible. He wondered sometimes if it would ever stop.
John just sat there, breathing in and out. It was the best he could do. Just breathe and try not to let himself get swept away by a wave of confusing emotions.
"I always have nightmares." He said casually. John picked up the bottle of water he brought with him and took a long swig.
"My face. My dad had my face. And if this is the part of the conversation where you tell me I need to forgive him so I can move on and get better I think we've hit a wall. I'm not going to forgive him. I'm glad he's dead. Some things you do in life...they're beyond forgiveness."
And so they went on like that. Round and round for hours as they walked round and round the city. He didn't even allow himself that little twinge that indicated heÂ was coming down. Instead, he just took another dose when he felt it might be approaching. As for how many pills it ended up being, well, he lost count. But he realized, as the day drew to a close and their shadows, or rather,
"You like an outside force and outside idea to rage against, to fight against. One of the reasons you're having so many problems right now is because everything is internal. You've never battled that well, John." She said looking at him earnestly. "That's why you pick fights."
âEarlier, during the âargumentâ, your voice was very convincingly elevated...when you demanded that I do something, make a move. I thought I detected real anger there. Was I right?â
Reggie was right, it didn't mean much to him now because he felt they were indeed one in the same and that feeling threatened to drag him down into paralyzation.
"I didn't think you'd be interested in that," Sherlock said looking up from his own computer. "It's rather old-fashioned."
"Yes, I know, Sholto means teal duck in Gaelic, I got that. I didn't realize you went back farther than the army."
"It doesn't matter. Have another drink and you won't recall I said it in the morning. I'm going to have a drink so I don't remember either."
"Splash!" She said and then completed the action sending a bit of water flying up at them. John made an exaggerated face, as he'd learned to do from Sherlock, at being so doused and she cackled with delight. It felt good to make his daughter laugh.
so proud of him. We'd just had our vows renewed, a lovely little ceremony and everything. You know, I'm sure how this can put a strain on a relationship."
"Back already?" She asked opening the door with a smile that soon faded. "John, what happened. You look a fright!"
"I'm being honest. It was going to be the pills, right? That was how you were going to manage it? And right here on my grave no less. How poetic. How very gothic. How positively Shellian. Go on, Doctor. Defend your death!"
No, but being in that room with Sherlock, with a gun in his hand. Having to make that choice. John using all of his will to not burst out with "Pick me. Please, God pick me."
They skipped breakfast and John let his morning exercise slide as he was far more partial to the workout he was currently receiving.
"Yeah, it's John Watson. Yeah, I know. I'm infamous these days. Look, can I dictate something to you?"
There were times when all those dark feelings of sadness andÂ self-doubtÂ rose like a current to carry him away.
"I'm not emotional about this. I realized my same-sex attraction decades ago. It is a point of interest neither propelling nor guiding my life. It is a fact, that is all. Facts are not emotional."
"I don't know. I was toying with the idea of just packing up and leaving the country. I'm not sure."
They'd told Hanah as soon as they could, both of them thrilled with the idea that they didn't just have the wedding news to spring on her but the fact that it was back to working again.
My therapist has encouraged me to be honest. I never thought honesty was all that difficult until people started pressing me on the subject. I believe it is. I believe I lie by omission and silence.
With surprisingly little resistance Sherlock scooted further back on the bed and laid down. The relaxed sigh was audible though he likely hadn't intended it to be.
"I'm a man of my word too. If you can make me believe you would be better off dead then off you pop with my blessing."
What about a change? A total change. What if I packed up and left London. Left England. Left the Western world. Left the planet.
"I don't ever see retirement in my futureÂ if that's what you mean. This keeps me sharp and I expect it will continue to do so well into my dotage."
"I always thought...I thought that if she were alive, she'd take us away from there. She'd gather us up in the middle of the night and spirit us away to somewhere safe." He inhaled sharply. "Yeah, she was good. She was very good."
"Safe travels to you both." She responded before adding. "Oh, John in the chaos of my office I almost forgot. I have a few things for you." She rummaged through a nearby box and came away with several books and more than a dozen photocopied bundles stapled together. "Some
and with the help of people he was still shocked to find around he tried again. He found the missing bits with their help, Sherlock in particular, Sherlock, especially, he started to put himself back together again.
At the moment, Sherlock was on his phone texting with Mycroft and frowning the entire time. Still, he wasn't distracted enough not to answer.
The music throbbed, and seemed to deepen in pitch, as if the stereo were broken. Everyone moved at the same pace they had, but it seemed much too fast, as though John himself were slipping out of time.
"I know." John saw a chance to shift the conversation. He took it. He stood, and forcing himself to relax, he put a hand on the side of Mark's neck. He tried not to grip it too hard. He was certain the hand wasn't shaking. Good. "I should probably be concerned about where that lot's going to take you tonight." He tilted his head toward the clinic lobby, indicating the other nurses.
George laughed, his smile lighting him up from within. "Good man." He asked the bartender for a pint of cider.
He dismounted in a small park, far from home, and wiped sweat from his brow. He checked his watch. He'd been out for two hours. The few remaining dry leaves rustled in the trees overhead, speaking soft goodnight to each other.
He felt a sense of calm, a stillness coming in, the same sense of peace and readiness he always felt, when it was time to fight, when it was time to take action. He would work this through. Now that he had a sense of what had gone on, he could react to it. He could plan.
There was no refrigerator, but the cupboard yielded a box of digestive biscuits and, miraculously, a couple of bananas. He ate the fruit, going as slowly as he could, then washed down a few of the biscuits with as much water as he thought he could drink without being sick. When he was finished, he sighed. His head began to clear.
, a sort of profile of Sherlock, and an interview. It featured a picture of him at Westminster Station, staring down the camera like he was deducing it, hands folded, his coat collar turned up. The interview mostly consisted of statements about how pleased he was to be back in London. The final question and answer had burned John to the core.
"You and me, we've got big plans to make. Worlds to conquer, yeah?" He squeezed Mark, and worked his length for everything he was worth.
The sharp tang of petrol reached him, a splash of it landing on his arm. He needed to move, to shift, to scream.
The lyric repeated, nauseatingly. People shouted along, laughing and moving too much, as if gravity had failed.
When he got home, he put his bike away in the shed, let himself in through the kitchen, then climbed the steps to the second floor, muscles played out, his skin soaked in a layer of good, healthy sweat. He peeled off his clothes, and stood in the shower for longer than he needed to, the hot water turning his skin bright red.
"Sure." If he were honest, he desperately wanted the time alone. More time to think. Or to stop thinking.
"Only if he doesn't like you. I think you'll be pretty safe. You're going to help with a case we're working."
On the Saturday before Christmas, John woke up alone, happy at the prospect of having the flat to himself. It was just after eight in the morning. He got up, and padded down to the kitchen, and wondered what he would do with his day. He sipped coffee and looked out into the back garden as the sun rose, catching a hint of blue sky outside. It was the first day of winter.
"Must have been very frustrating for you, having such a terrifying skill set, and being unable to use it all these months."
John nodded, feeling his world realign. Ella was right. Mark was his anchor, part of the new reality he'd built for himself, in Sherlock's absence.
He was. He wasn't. Mark could see right through him, he was sure. "Yeah, yeah. Me? Fine. I am fine." He gazed at Mark, chewing the inside of his lip, half wanting this part to be over, half wanting it to never end. "Phone call?"
"That's right. That's right," Mark was saying. "In the old place. We'll use it as home base, like last time. I'll bring him to the main house tonight, when he's awake. Hang onâ"
He should never have dropped his guard, never have allowed himself to get so low, after Sherlock died, after he left. He'd thought the game was over. He'd felt so small, a shadow of his former self. He knew now, that feeling had been an illusion. The game was never over. John had become a player when he'd joined Sherlock in the first place, and he always would be, as long as there was still breath in his lungs, and fire in his heart.
Sherlock shook his head. "I thought I saw a pattern there. Some operative in place. CIA, maybe, maybe something dingier, black ops, I don't know. Just when I was getting close, the trail went cold. Could be anyone. Could be no one. Could be you."
Sherlock was watching him, his gaze contemplative, and maybe a bit worried. John waited, certain that everything he felt was shining out through his eyes. If Sherlock needed to speak, he would wait. He would wait all night. For the rest of his life.
And that was Mark all over: steady, secure, always willing to give John as much space as he needed, but there, when John wanted him.
Mark was a professional. He was still working. Still active. Mark's lie, the central lie of his entire life, wasn't small. It was very big, indeed.
Mark wasn't Sherlock. John had to remember that, had to remember that whatever problems might come up in their relationship, they were going to be ordinary, everyday things.
John snorted laughter. Mark made it easy, so easy, to pretend that everything was fine, always. And maybe it was fine. They had their life together. A real, normal life.
"The way he's always on the phone, texting or talking. I mean, who talks on the phone any more? Besides him? We ride him about it all the time at the clinic. Doesn't interfere with his work, but still, every spare minute!" She shook her head.
In the cab, on their way home, after the graveyard, John leaned over and touched Mark's cheek, and planted a kiss there, Mark's quarter inch of beard rough under his lips.
He felt, with a rising sense of panic, and amazement at himself, that he absolutely did not want to die. Not just this way, in pain, while people he didn't know unwittingly murdered him. He wanted, desperately, to live. He had to see Sherlock again, had to talk to him. If he couldn't, if he didn't, it would be a tragedy for both of them, this fire, this burning.
With effort, he managed to open his eyes, although he couldn't focus them. His first impression was of darkness, dark forms crisscrossing around him, caging him in, and beyond that, lights.
The rest of the afternoon was taken up with sorting things out with the police. The assailant, whose name was Jonathan Small, was all too happy to reveal his plan. He'd intended to stab Bainbridge with the skewer, through his uniform belt, an injury that would cause him to bleed out, after Bainbridge took the belt off.
John put his phone on silent mode, then slipped it back into his jacket pocket, wondering how the extra drug had gotten into the man's system. He pictured Mark, wandering into the alley behind the pub, pictured him flirting, offering a drink of something, or palming a needle that he'd discarded elsewhere after using it. No oneâmaybe not even Sherlockâwould be able to prove anything on the basis of one more puncture on a junkie's arm.
Monday, John's first thought upon waking was that Sherlock had drawn that small, black moustache on at the Landmark to make fun of him. He touched his upper lip, running his fingers over the bristles of his own moustache, and laughed up at the bedroom ceiling, while he listened to the gurgle of the coffee maker, the morning sounds of Mark, who always seemed to rise before him, puttering around the kitchen.
John frowned, scrambling to catch up. "It wasn't like that. We neverâ" he realised he'd been pushed into saying more than he should. "Where's this coming from?"
John's gut clenched, but he held himself back from taking a full step forward. He was meant not to care. He looked back at Mark. "See what I mean?"
"I would have loved a postcard." He swallowed hard, and the joke died in his throat. "Or a word. It would have helped, if I'd known you weren'tâ" He cut himself off. It was too much, probably. He couldn't tell Sherlock the truth, that he would have waited for him. Put his life on hold. Tried to find him. Done anything.
"All right." John fought against the impression that everything that had passed between them had somehow been nullified, even as he still felt the phantom of Sherlock's arms around him, his fingers rubbing the back of his neck. He went to the door of the greenhouse, and touched the handle. "Goodnight, then," he said.
Mark hit answer on his phone, and started talking into it. "Hi. Yes. Yes, I'm here. I'm listening. Go ahead." His tone wasn't anything he typically used with his friends. John ran through the possibilities, who it could be, who would call Mark on a Friday evening, about something that sounded so much like business.
There was no way around this, John decided. Pretending that Sherlock hadn't hurt him wasn't right. Pretending that he'd just waited for Sherlock, waited for a miracle he'd never imagined could actually happenâthat wasn't good, either.
He took a deep breath, stood, paced the kitchen, then turned and went back to the table. He sat, and continued typing:
John had grown strong, in those days. Able to hold the truth of what was going on at home, while he continued to go to school and work, to do what he needed to do, until he could leave. He'd made something of himself. More than his father had ever thought he would.
Mark pulled back, gripping John's shoulder. "It's just, there are a lot of careless people out there. Crazy ones, too."
"John!" Sherlock's voice carried a high note of surprise. He stepped onto the coffee table, and down onto the floor, stumbling a bit, as if his knees didn't quite want to support him.
"You. Adrenaline. The war you never left. You know, you're lucky I found you. This is your chance to change to a better supplier. You're not going to believe what I can do for you." Mark's hand traveled up John's shoulder, and caressed the side of his neck, rubbing on the sensitive spot he knew John liked.
John held up the present he'd brought, the book, in its covering of bright paper. "For you." He moved to the desk, and put it down on the corner.
gun, the one he'd left at Baker Street. Proof that Sherlock was here, somewhere nearby. It was heavy and firm, a reassuring presence. He had a chance, if it came down to a standoff.
In the bathroom, he stripped off his clothes, and put them in the laundry hamper. He watched himself in the medicine cabinet mirror as he carefully pulled the bandage off his forehead, revealing a deep scratch, crusted with dried blood. He took out his electric razor, and shaved his face. Once he was done, he rubbed his fingers across his naked upper lip.
"I'm not the oneâ" John closed his eyes. He was losing control of his temper, practically yelling. He lowered his voice, and leaned in. "Look, you know this bothers me. You and him, thick as thieves, going behind my back."
"He's crooked, isn't he? You're getting married for a case. John Watson, you absolute bastard. I've never been prouder of you."
Sherlock had said the killings meant there were factions within the network, some kind of internal dispute. Â John could see that there were two plans at play, two plans that conflicted with each other: one, to torture Sherlock with the fact that John could be eliminated at any time, and to kill him. The other, to marry John to someone else. To break Sherlock's heart in slow, small increments.
Vince stuck his hand out and introduced himself to Harry. Harry elbowed John, then laughed at something Vince said, and suddenly she was the centre of attention, as Bill joined the conversation, and John rubbed at his forehead, and wondered how in the hell he was going to figure out a way to do what he so desperately needed.
He moved to the window at the end of the bed, the one that faced the same direction as the door. He pulled the curtain aside just enough to see out through it, and found nothing but trees, and the low understory that tended to grow in older woods, pale green groundcover and moss. Beside the window stood a rickety porch, with wooden steps leading down to a clearing, where he assumed Mark had been keeping the car. Van, he corrected himself, as he tugged the curtains back into place, remembering that, sometime in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere, they'd traded away the car.
John went to the window. Sherlock's parents moved down the street together, their silver-haired heads tilting toward each other as they spoke, Mrs. Holmes gesticulating grandly. Mr. Holmes turned his head to watch her. They were reminiscent of something, John decided, some ideal he couldn't quite put his finger on.
Instead, he felt a minor note of annoyance at the jokey tone, the pet name banter that Mark seemed to think was hilarious, but which John had never quite taken to. Slowly, gingerly, he put the note back down on the table, stood up, and went upstairs.
Above all, John would be patient. He would be smart about it. He would look after Sherlock, just like Sherlock deserved.
Mark sat up, and nodded. He looked pale, his eyes rimmed with red. "Well, I think I knew that. I mean, I did. I've read the blog."
Slowly, he drifted into a fitful sleep, in which dreams of Sherlock, haunting the doorway of his hospital room, returned again and again, until the sun rose, cheerful and bright over the parking garage outside his window, and a nurse came in, with what would no doubt prove to be a disappointing breakfast.
It was ridiculous. Totally insane. Most definitely a trick, a test. Of course it was. Sherlock was all drama, all big gestures. He always had been.
They climbed down a steep ladder, going deeper and deeper, until they emerged onto a tube platform. The rough concrete floor was covered in a fine layer of silt, the walls untiled. A small pile of rubble occupied a far corner.
John's eyes fluttered shut as an image arose, unbidden, of undoing Sherlock's shirt buttons, softly, easing the fabric down over his shoulders, and exploring, with his fingertips, the raised welts and scars all across his back. There was a story there. A world of stories that John wanted to hear, wanted to draw out of Sherlock, until he was done speaking, and he was known, and understood, and maybe, just maybe, whole again.
"I still think this is going to be stupid," John said, under his breath. "Seriously, what are we doing here?"
"Just trying to do my part. If you're going to save London, the least I can do is save the flat." He slid off of John, his expression sly, and gathered the plates. "Hardly anything here. Won't be five minutes. Why don't you go upstairs and get ready for bed?"
Mark's smile was subtle. "Well, I'm driving later tonight." John watched the floor as Mark put his arm around John's shoulder. The honeymoon plans.
"Ex." John frowned, and broke into a nervous giggle. That wasn't much different. Maybe he meant it. "Besides, maybe I do still have a commander, after a fashion. Maybe I'm not ready to give up the idea of having one yet."
John closed his eyes, as he remembered long evenings spent in Sholto's room, when he'd served under him in Afghanistan. Meetings that turned into drinking sessions. Personal conversations that turned flirtatious. In retrospect, he could probably have kissed Sholto. Probably could have made love to him, in some fumbling, inexpert way. Knowing what John knew now, there had been signs, perhaps. Maybe Sholto had wanted him. Maybe he'd been just as inexperienced as John, just as full of self-loathing, just as closeted.
John's stomach turned. Of course Mark wanted to get him alone, wanted to have John all to himself, to own him. He thought he already did. He'd moved in on John when he was at his weakest. He believed John to be sincere. That was John's public reputation, after all: stalwart, and true, and loyal as any dog. He must have looked like a fool, to Mark. So easy to trick, so easy to take advantage of.
After Sherlock debriefed the bomb squad, a pair of police officers escorted him and John back toward the surface. They moved through the maintenance tunnels in silence, illuminated by the sickly metallic light of the large torches the officers carried. All the magic had fled, from the dark, from the depths.
John tried to imagine Mark being upset enough to shout, the smooth exterior peeling away, to reveal the monster beneath. Tom had gotten to him somehow. Perhaps Mark had tried to persuade Tom to come over to his way of thinking. Perhaps they'd argued about why Mark wouldn't simply kill John, be done with it, and go back to whatever it was he and Tom had been to each other.
him. John was sure of it now, impossible as it was. There was the mole on the right side of his throat. The smattering of smaller moles on the left. His chin, his lips.
John struggled, as he sat with Mark, and the news anchor said something about the decision that had been reached in Parliament, to see something in the way Sherlock had behaved, something that meant John should reach out, text, call, offer to talk. What had happened between them, it hadn't been trivial, even if it was nothing Sherlock wanted.
There was nothing unusual, just the normal stuff you would expect a Londoner to accumulate: receipts from the off-licence, from the occasional lunch purchased at the places nearest work; a small pile of loose change. Mark was totally normal in his habits, completely innocuous. Funny and bright and sexy. Everything about him, calculated to appeal, to entice. To seduce.
As John spoke, his mouth was dry. "You know who I am, who I used to be." From across the park, a bird sang a late night song.
"There. Very good. I'm satisfied that the measurements were just right. Sherlock certainly knows you well. How does it feel? You'll be wearing it all day, on Saturday."
John went upstairs to finish getting ready, brushing his teeth, and sliding an extra shirt into his backpack, to change into, before he took the tube to Baker Street, tonight.
"Thank you," he told her, feeling a thousand different things at once, and wondering how in the hell a tailor was going to make him a suit, when he hadn't been in for a fitting. He would find out, he supposed. An unfamiliar feeling moved through him, a warm, quiet affection for Sherlock, for everything he could do, for the fact that he cared, in his own way.
John wasn't sure if Mark meant the watch, or the gun. He could feel his arms and legs, but he couldn't move them. He concentrated hard, and managed to get his right arm to twitch.
John stopped in the act of putting his coat on, watching Sherlock carefully, as the last vestige of hope, that somehow Sherlock had seen what was going on with Mark, that somehow he knew, died a quiet death. For his part, Sherlock paced, and sent another text, then another.
Sherlock was standing on the sofa, studying an array of photos and notes that covered the wall. He was perched between an older man and woman, who seemed to be taking this behaviour in stride.
John looked at the clock. It was at 1:29 now. He took a step forward, watching Sherlock's pale, devastated face. He waited, until Sherlock broke their locked mutual gaze.
Sherlock sat down at the desk. "The drive, John." He held out his hand, and John took the drive out of his pocket, and gave it to him.
"Are you seriously arguing on behalf of the man who ordered you out of my life knowing you were suicidal?"
"Yeah?" John asked before tilting his head to kiss him. He concluded the action by sucking on his bottom lip.
"Did you bring the files I requested?" Sherlock asked holding out his hand with the assumption the answer was yes.
"I've had my jabs, remember. At your suggestion." She said dismissively. "Have you eaten at all? Let me make you something. A nice English breakfast will do you right up."
to get his bearings. Heâd heard people hallucinated in freezing weather before they died. Was he perhaps in actuality, curled in a snowdrift somewhere? Was his final vision before he died Sherlock coming to see him one last time?
"Perhaps you'd better stay about a little more often. He's happiest when you're here." She said with a smile. "Though I have noticed you haven't been going out that much have you?"
I released the kind of exhausted, frightened shuddering sigh that I made certain to never let him see. I then got up, went to the kitchen and put on the kettle.
"Hey, yeah...yeah it's me. I know..yeah, I know. Mmhmm. Yeah, good to hear your voice too. Listen, I was wondering if you might have some time later on in the week to get together. No, we can go out to dinner or I can make something. Yes, yeah. Alright great. Yeah, bye, Harry."
"You're good." She replied. "They're not rules. But the are suggestions. This doesn't mean I want you to avoid physical contact. But what I just said about exercise and engaging your body in different ways applied here too. You can absolutely explore your sexuality with one another without having sex. It might not be a bad idea to try couples therapy for navigating these early steps. Neither of you hasÂ fully engaged your sexuality as a gay man or a bisexual man. Now that's something I want to encourage you to do both together and on your own. John, for you specifically, you're going to need to rethink your relationship with sex and the connotations you have regarding it."
"I know and it's not as if I think I can manage it all. I'm not going to be able to clear a path down the mountain or anything." He smiled. "Just maybe make it so you can open the front doors come morning if need be."
"I won't. I'll stop, I'll promise. But if he makes that call, I lose my license. I won't ever get it back. Not ever. Please, Molly, please, I am begging you. I'm
Without much ceremony or thought John unscrewed the top and dipped in his finger. The viscous substances pulled out long and amber as he raised his hand. It was more, for lack of a better word, butter than he expected, less drizzly than ordinary honey, a little more like melted caramel. It was room temp warm and immediatelyÂ perfumed the air around them. He popped the finger in his mouth and closed his eyes at the flavor. Honestly, he was surprised. He'd had honey before, of course, but it always came out of a container in the shape of a bear or a little plastic packet. But this...this was something different. This was richer, thicker, it coated his tongue with a sweetness and a slightly acidic burn. He'd splurged on this. It was sort of foolish but he did have three months of pensions checks banked away and what was one small trifle? Still, he'd debated with himself a little about whether it was worth it. Until now. Now he could admit it, there
"We've got a bloke came down the station and said he was roughed up. Pistol whipped as a matter of fact. Says it happened the same night you both were chasing him. Says this is all a part of systematic harassment by law enforcement about the Gomes case."
John spared a glance at Janine who didn't look as confused as one might expect. When she met John's eyes she gave him a wry smile and raised her glass in 'Cheers'.
"I don't know, you're right. And, yes, she very well may." John agreed and at that Sherlock's head jerked in his direction. Finally.
"Sherlock...I am so sorry I never asked. I cannot begin to tell you how sorry I am. It was so, so wrong of me."
"You know it was amazing. You just want to be praised which I am more than happy to do. That was amazing, John."
He didn't know why except he just didn't want to. He'd scanned over it, taken cabs past it, decided to go and then at the last minute changed his mind. In the interim, it had now become this looming thing, this mountain that seemed far larger to attempt to climb now than it had at the start.
Rehab is full of special people. I'm terribly special myself. These halls are full of people, like me, who figure the rules don't apply to them and they should be able to have a little sip of this and a little snort of that and pop just one or two of these. Because we are special. But we're not. I'm not. I have problems that are unique to me but problems that are in no way unique in and of themselves. I had a shitty childhood, people lied to me, I lied to people. I've failed in my relationships, I've been unfaithful. I have seriously contemplated suicide multiple times.
It was good, incredibly good and as John arched back, exposing his neck, Sherlock's mouth was thereÂ lapping at the straining muscles. He was glancing his prostate again and again and again and John found himself panting, trying to catch his breath and just keep up.
John thought for a bit. Trust and Harry had not been two words that typically went together. It was odd to have them linked now.
By this time John was writhing on the bed, twisting the sheets in one hand. Wanting both to retreat and surge forward he was careful not to pull too far away from Sherlock but was undeniably overwhelmed by these sensations. His last sexual encounter that ended in orgasm filled him with embarrassment and shame. Texting the bus girl who turned out to be Eurus. The things he'd said. The flattery he'd so willingly, eagerly and stupidly basked in. The pathetic, middle-aged fantasies he'd played out. Betrayal atop betrayal of the two people who mattered most to him.
"John Watson. New life. Second chance. Don't fuck it up. Please...please don't fuck it up." He whispered.
"John, this isn't going to be easy but it is the next step in your exposure therapy. I want you to start at the beginning, January 15th, 2012."
"Mycroft had every intention of putting me in here, several times. I see he didn't exaggerate its comforts. This is a fine room, John."
"Oh God, no." She laughed. "I was calling to see if you and Sherlock might be able to watch Rosie. The sitter canceled and I'm sort of in a bind."
"You never asked. Though I think I've been fairly clear. Women are not my area, didn't I say that multiple times?"
"Well, that's not going to happen. Of course, I'm going to worry. You need the things that sustain you. Didn't you once tell me your mind atrophies if it's not exercised and invigorated? How invigorating can it be sitting around here babysitting me? It's not fair to you."
"Then what were you going to tell me?" John said leaning forward. He'd replayed that scene over and over in his head, always with what he could have said and done. Now, he wanted to hear Sherlock's version.
I don't know who's reading this or if you're reading this at all. Perhaps it'll just end up in the bin as that's exactly what I deserve. I hope not, though. And I hope it's my best mate who's reading these words right now.
John cleared his throat and stepped closer to the shiny black monument. Widening his stance he adjusted his grip on the handle. Once he found the proper balance he took a deep breath and brought the sledgehammer back over his shoulder before swinging it forward aiming right for the 'K' in SHERLOCK.
." He said shaking his head. In the closet. He didn't know what to do with those words just yet. They didn't feel right. They didn't feel as though they fit. All he did know was that he could say is he felt no inner turmoil about...about loving another man. "I'm not drinking because of Sherlock."
The funny thing was once he got the phone in his hands it paralyzed him. For a good ten minutes, he'd just sat on his bed staring at the device like he didn't trust it.
Tonight it was the opposite, Sherlock was the big spoon, the strong, protective arm, the hand splayed across his chest. It was like a narcotic, the peaceful, easy way this man could cajole him into slumber. It was all the relaxation he'd ever wanted from the bottle and never found.
Early on he stopped telling Sherlock about any appointments he had and was sure to schedule them at a time that would arouse the least suspicion.
He then went to Sherlockâs twitter account. He'd avoided his Twitter specifically, fearing what he might find there. But tonight curiosity got the better of him.
"This isn't a bit of disconnect. I look at her and I know how I'm supposed to feel but I just don't. I don't feel that way about her or anyone anymore. I can't...access anything anymore, Harry."
"No, no really I'm fine. I'm not going to let this curtail my life or my plans. I got clean so I could live and that's what I'm going to do. It's just going to be uncomfortable for awhile, I suppose. I mean, what's the worst that could happen?"
"Ok." He grinned and let his hand slide down Sherlock's body, not stopping until he reached his groin. "Mmmm already so hard for me."
To her this was normal. It was all normal. Their conversation, her children, their lives. Except for a few upsets and inconveniences, this was all perfectly normal.
"You took down "Analysis of Tobacco Ash". After I teased you about it, you deleted the entire blog post. "
"And you do an admirable job. A job that youÂ did, regardless of an order from my overbearing sibling."
John paused, giving Sherlock a moment to breathe and relax. He watched his face, watched it shift, the brow furrow, the lips press together. He leaned forward to kiss those lips, hoping to remind him of the pleasure to come, the intimacy.
How much of his life, he wondered had he spent begging Sherlock Holmes? What would he give to continue to be able to do it? Beg him to wash a dish, make tea, sit in their garden, watch the sunset, listen to the hum of the bees. He'd had so many years with him and all he wanted was more.
"When I first met him I lived a very solitary life. Little contact with the outside world save for my brother or the people I met briefly who came to me for help. I had acquaintances but no real friends. Friends were something other people had and I had certainly made no attempt to make myself friendly or like other people. He changed that."
âIt was real alright. Been holding that spanking trick in your back pocket for awhile, eh? I had no idea.â
"Ok, fair enough. So, I think I have something for you. It's through a friend of a friend. Locum work but it may become permanent."
To be honest, I found this to be a bit of a double problem, AA, I mean. Not only do I spend every day of my life, including today, wishing I had a drink in my hand or both hands."
"That's up to you. I can completely ignore their queries, I've done it before. Or, we could tweet just your picture."
"Not what she did. It didn't take long for me to realize I wouldn't be able to stand the monotony of being a GP. Emergency medicine started to appeal to me so I shifted my focus, kept training, got a few jobs, Bachelors of Surgery, trained in Trauma and Orthopedics. When it was time to reapply again for a new position, that was when I got the letter from Duck. I felt like I'd been moving in slow motion. I was good at what I did. I was a good doctor...I hope I still am. But still I was so unsatisfied, so unhappy. I thought the letter came at the best possible time. A saw a chance to enlist in the Army's surgical training program and I took it."
"I get up, I pick a meeting, I come back to the flat, Sherlock and I have breakfast together, we go over a few cases the majority of which he's been able to solve without leaving home. "
"It seemed like a miracle when Sherlock forgot it all. We thanked our lucky stars, you can believe that. We hoped things might return to normal but then there was the fire and Mycroft's deception."
John swallowed hard as now that Sherlock had put the imagery in his head he couldn't stop picturing it. Though he wasn't fighting very hard against it.
your best friend. We've done a bit of that today and it's to be celebrated and not swept under the rug with more apologies whose time has long passed. Don't you think he deserves to hear it? What the consequences of his actions were? Don't you think he deserves an explanation for your actions?"
And if that was Sherlock's reasoning it didn't explain why he'd said it when they were both sober and John told him goodbye at Baker Street.
John smiled to himself as he ate another mouthful of the pasta. It was good. Good, easy, hot comfort food.
I decided to make Rosie dark haired because everyone makes her blonde. We don't even know what Mary's real hair color is and Martin/John's beard seems to come in ginger though he was like Village of the Damned blonde as a kid. My point is, anything is possible. Anyway, I just liked the idea of Parentlock with a child with John's features but with a hair colour similar to Sherlock's.
âDuck was working a bit more than I was. Taking some jobs he wouldnât let me come on. I didnât get why and at first, I was offended and then pretty hurt. It took me some time to understand he was trying to protect me. He was in a lot deeper than I was.
Still though, he'd missed him. Even in his rage he'd missed the comfort Sherlock could have provided. It was at moments like this when he realized he was almost as isolated as he had been when he'd returned home from Afghanistan. What was his life? Where were his friends? Where was his foundation? His support?
Sensate had been so focused, hyper-focused and he liked that, loved it really. It was this wonderful compartmentalization of eroticism. Slowly disassembling Sherlock piece by piece.
"Also, I heard you come in, then I heard you slam the door to the loo. Mrs. Hudson has never slammed a door in her life." Then quieter and leaning close he asked. "Are you alright?"
"So, my fantasy would always begin with your neck." He said before smearing a shiny, sticky streak across Sherlock's throat, just to the side of his Adam's apple. He licked his lips and leaning in ran his tongue over the substance. It burned the way honey does but it was sweet and rich and he moaned as Sherlock moaned.
"Why do you say that?" He asked quickly. He was still, after all this time protective of his dead wife and the secrets she wanted to keep.
"While I appreciate you coming to see me...more than I can ever really say, you were in no condition to undertake this trip. You're exhausted and I mean that medically, you are suffering from exhaustion. You might also be coming down with something, only time will tell. Lie back, right now."
"Who's James?" Sherlock said apropos of nothing as they lay in bed the next morning. His face was smashed in the pillow, words nearly swallowed up by it in fact. Sherlock had the rather silly habit of looking as though he were dropped from a plane directly onto his bed. He slept compactly, he wasn't a sprawler but he slept hard, body solidly pressed against the mattress.
but negative attention. They started to receive hate mail, threatening calls. Most of these eventually died down except for one. I investigated and found that it was Victor Trevors older sister, Perry. She initially denied it but when I went to see her she confessed. She was furious, heartbroken, as anyone understandably would be. She thought I was aÂ solicitorÂ at first until IÂ introducedÂ myself. Then she said she remembered me a little. She remembered me dashing by, usually running after her brother, always playing pirates."
He went to bed listless. No forest dreams that night. Instead he was back in his childhood home, standing in the kitchen. Facing the stove, his back to the small table where they ate meals. His father was behind him, seething. He wasn't speaking. He didn't have to. John could feel him, boring holes into the back of his head, practically huffing, like a bull pawing at the ground before a charge.
He snapped the shot and then came to kneel just beside her,Â placing an arm around her little shoulders.
"No, I'm in your head and that means I wouldn't bring it up if some part of you wasn't already thinking it."
At the moment Sherlock was in the process of putting his more dangerous experiments away where small hands couldn't possibly reach them.
"You saw me at my lowest and my worst, my most arsehole and my absolute best self-destructive. And no matter what image of me I put before you, you always remembered the John Watson that I was, that I used to be, that I
You once said, when you were quite cross with me, that people, but specifically me, forget lots of "little things".
"I've a bit more time." Sherlock said to him and after setting the alarm on his phone, they collapsed into bed and slept in each other's arms for the next 2 hours.
JohnÂ was still looking at Sherlock and saw the same feelings visible there on his features; joy and contentment.
"Uh no, honeymoon stage, I suppose." He said with a grin. "I just enjoy being here with him and he doesn't seem in any hurry to leave."
matter at all but I was thinking it wouldn't be such a bad idea to get a full screening, physical, maybe even mental and certainly a panel workup. Look, they won't ask, they're legally not allowed to ask but if they seem hesitant you can hit them with reams of paper detailing your clean bill of health."
God, was it? That was a depressing little thought. âYeah, I guess so. It was certainly the first time I had the means and space to put anything into a friendship.â
Invitation received and accepted John started groaning as loud as he'd always wanted to, calling Sherlock's name hoarsely, reverently.
"Look, do you really want to ruin my life over this? Do you? Do you think they'll give you some sort of bloody promotion? They won't. They won't fucking care! It won't matter to them! The only person it will matter to is ME!"
Hanah passed him the box of tissues, a sympathetic look on her face. He knew if he accepted the box he wouldn't be able to stop the tears, all bets would be off."
"Good morning, John." Sherlock said in his ear. John felt his hand slip under his t shirt, moving up to touch his chest, fingers tweaking nipples. They immediately hardened at the contact and John sighed happily at being so possessively and confidently caressed.
It was visceral, his need for him for the entire experience, the feel of his pubic hair against his cheek as he'd kissed all around that glorious cock. The smell of his soap but underneath that the scent that was him, the scent that was just Sherlock, all healthy and virile and musky pheromones.
They'd given him his phone and he'd immediately gone to the Daily Mail to have his worst fears confirmed.
"I've never hit a woman. I never would. Not ever. I was the closestÂ withÂ Mary and I never, ever even considered doing something like that. Never."
I put us both through the trials, I put us through the labours of Hercules and we came out the other side battered and bruised but together. I wanted to stay together with her. I have never taken what she did lightly and it wasn't over, I wasn't...
"John, look at me." He said and only then did he realize he'd been glancing away. He was regretting demanding they Skype. He really didn't want to see Sherlock's face as he did whatever his version of letting someone down easy was. He really didn't want to be seen either. Glancing at his friends face John felt a very real surge of pain in his heart. Oh God but that face, his face. And everything that came with it. The feeling of his body against his, holding his hand, soft, gentle discussion, the same old loving teasing. God, he loved him. How stupid it had been to deny it all this time.
"Yes..., it's me. No, nothing is wrong. Yes, I'm aware that it's late. I said I was aware. If I wanted the exact time I would have called the BT Speaking Clock. Before we go any further you should know something. I am calling you because of John. Because he is a far more generous, decent and forgiving person that I am. I'm calling because he believes what you did you did for my sake. And if he bears you no ill will...how can I? But let me make myself clear, you owe this phone call and any continuation of our relationship to him and only him. Am I quite understood? Good. I'mÂ well and yourself? Good. Yes, thank you. I'll pass on your congratulations to him as well. Yes, I'm happy. I'm very happy..."
"Things that I thought were the opposite of being depressed that book tells me aren't. The impulsivity, the anger...I always thought of depression as something that slowed you down to a near halt. The way I was in the last few days and months before I came here. But if that's not true, if I've been dealing with this my entire life then...my concern is you're going to prescribe a lot of pills. That for me to live anything close to a normal life I'm going to have to spend it drugged up."
"You're proposing that we get back into bed and kiss until it's time to leave so they can prep for the party?" Sherlock said with a disbelieving shake of his head.
"A panic attack. A goddamn panic attack. Right here. of course. Of course right fucking here and right fucking now." He muttered as he sank to the ground next to the toilet.
"Could Dr. Watson leave the room and usher in John, please? I'd much rather speak with him." He asked quietly but firmly.
He didn't question why it seemed like he could almost feel her, why he could almost smell the Claire de la Lune, why he drew such comfort from this, but he did.
Sherlock paused at the bottom of the stairs, his eyes shining, his old devil of a smile back again. "Westminster Station, John. We're going underground."
Violet studied the two of them. For a moment, something like compassion moved over her features. When she spoke, she addressed herself to John.
John balked a bit at the suspenders. "Are you sure about this? It isn't some kind ofâpractical joke?"
He supposed that none of that mattered, now that he knew the relationship was over. He looked forward to moving on with his life, into his future with Sherlock, once everything was settled, once they'd dealt with the conspiracy against them.
He recalled, with a shudder, the things he'd shouted at him, on the last day, right before he died, in the lab at Barts.
Sherlock's ellipsis flared into life, then disappeared again, leaving John to wonder if he'd said too much. He didn't know what Sherlock truly needed, or how much he would accept, or what he wanted, what he would want. How he might like to be treated. How he would like to be handled.
"You invited four of your former army colleagues to the wedding, three of whom have replied to say that they're coming, leaving Major Sholto the odd one out. He lives three hours from London, so he could easily attend, but he never responded to your initial email. No response to the formal invitation, either, according to Anika. You sent a repeat email message four days ago. And you spent a night searching online for an alternative means of reaching him."
He pulled back, slowly, still close, too close, his features blurry in the dim light. John drank in Sherlock's mouth, his chin, his cheekbones, his pale eyes. The faint cool sensation of the place where he'd pressed his lips.
The days had worn on, and the miracle did not manifest, and the tattered, brittle string that tied John to the blinding dazzle of his time with Sherlock grew thinner and thinner. He feared it would snap, one day soon, and he knew that if he didn't find some sort of other life before that happened, there wouldn't be anything left of him. Nothing worth salvaging.
John released himself from hospital the first moment he could, leaving after a quick word with a doctor, and an assurance that he would return if he felt unwell. Outside, he stretched his back, arms raised over his head, and looked up at the grey sky. The morning had come over unseasonably warm for late fall.
For a while, it was all flashing lights, and the nurses cheering while they danced. The distant cousins and the one maiden aunt seemed to hit it off with Mrs. Hudson, Molly, and Greg, forming a little group to themselves in the far corner of the dance floor.
He was careful. He always tried to be careful, but Mark was so open, and his face was flushed with pleasure, as he keened, and his head tilted back, and he said, "Fuck me, you furious whore," which made John laugh.
After an hour of riding, leg muscles burning, feeling better in his body, and certain that no one was following him, John made his way through a series of quiet streets, following his memory of the map he'd looked at in the middle of the night. Finally, he came to a stop outside the open iron gates of the churchyard he'd been seeking. Inside, a mess of faded, frost-blighted greenery grew thick between headstones. The attached church was tiny, named after some obscure saint John had never heard of.
"Mirror's back here," John said, leading Sherlock into the little sitting area. "I'm almost finished getting ready."
Upstairs, he found Sherlock standing at the kitchen table, wearing safety goggles, a blowtorch in one hand, and an eyeball held in a set of tweezers in the other. He applied the flame to the dangling optic nerve. It was a bizarre tableau. Performance art.
John felt the same sensation of his heart expanding, and catching fire, as he had before. That, he was certain, would never change, even if the last month, of separation, of receiving small, considerate favours he didn't deserve, had allowed something new to come in, something softer, and quieter, that he couldn't quite name. He took another step forward. "Bit of a letdown, that."
The vicar led them through a round of blessings, having them kneel, and stand again, then go to the registration table and sign the marriage certificate. John hesitated for a moment before he signed his name, looking sidelong at Mark, and all too aware of Sherlock, who stood as witness, hovering by John's left elbow.
The high-pitched noise that came out of the dignified older woman, with her hair smoothed into an updo, all tidy in her dark coat with its gold brooch, was nothing short of shocking. She stood, and tossed her purse onto the coffee table, and walked toward John with open arms.
. Mark wasn't a great reader. He only ever seemed to manage a page or two each night before he fell asleep, so his bookmark moved forward in tiny increments, and it took him forever to get through a single book, but he insisted on trying.
He stood in the bathroom, looking at his reflection in the mirror, and recalled Sherlock's face, the defeated look he'd worn as he wiped the drawn-on moustache from his upper lip. He sighed, fished around in a drawer, and pulled out a pair of barber's scissors.
A digital display on the bomb read 2:30. John's watch told him it was just past 3 pm. So not a clock. A countdown timer. It wasn't moving. Good. That was good. The bomb wasn't going to go off. Not in the next two and a half minutes, anyway. A call to bomb disposal, and it would be taken care of.
John wasn't fine. He would never be fine again. He had tried, had said what he'd always wanted to say, and it was over.
He straightened his tie, and fidgeted in his chair. Took a deep breath. Blew it out through his mouth.
When she asked him how he felt about it, he shrugged. "Happy I didn't go off and hit him, I suppose."
"What do you mean, don't remove it?" Sherlock spoke softly, but he was shaking. "We'll remove it immediately, and we'll take him to hospital until whatever he's been given wears off. Next steps are still the same." He was on his feet again, practically spitting in Violet's face. "Detain Mark. Interrogate him. Do the best you can with that. If you knew how to do your job, you would have done that already, instead of knowingly exposing this man to danger for all these months."
In the centre of the room, standing on a red Persian rug that was clearly new, was a small, round table with two chairs. There was food, apparently: several takeaway containers with their covers on peeked out from under a folded wool blanket.
A clerk came around the corner nearest to John, and sidled up to him. "Trouble with your girlfriend?"
John was no pawn, no damsel in distress, no matter how some gang of criminals viewed him, no matter how Sherlock saw things. He wouldn't behave like he was.
As John took another step, he recognised an older photo of himself, and one of Mark. The sketch closest to him was a layout plan, familiar because he'd spent the better part of two evenings studying it: the reception hall.
He thumbed open the conversation with Mark. His jaw clenched as he reread Mark's texts from that morning, the apparently light-hearted note telling John to get his readers under control.
Mark took the ring from Cath, and slipped it onto John's finger. He looked into John's eyes, all anticipation.
His eyes fluttered shut, against the dust, against the rising wave of nostalgia and longing, for everything that could have been. He allowed himself a final, irrational prayer:
This man couldn't be Sherlock. He looked so stunned, so utterly confused, and although he had come over to the table with something to say a moment ago, something about the champagne, he'd cut himself off, which was something that Sherlock would never have done.
At that exact moment, Cath came out of the reception hall too, adjusting the bodice of her dress as she went. She winked at Harry as she passed by the bar, on her way over to where the nurses, and Mark, were still talking and laughing together.
He patted her hand, his fingertips brushing lightly against her knuckles, stiff with arthritis, the paper thin skin of her hand. He could feel himself clinging to her advice, knowing it was all up to him, to do his best with an impossible situation.
John made it ten steps before Mark's white van drove out of the trees at the far end of the field. He stared at the beekeeper, mouth open. He couldn't pretend that he hadn't seen him, thatÂ he hadn't come outside. He was in plain view of the van. He wondered, desperately, if he could rush over to the man, say a few words, get a message out, somehow, butâGod, he was in danger. They both were. If the man really was just someone working the estate, John would only draw attention to him, maybe implicate him unfairly in whatever punishment Mark wanted to dole out.
John fought to keep his focus, despite the murderous anger that built in him, hearing Mark talk about casually destroying Sherlock. He was close to the endpoint of Mark's game, so close to finding out the whole truth. John slipped his hand back down between them, and toyed with Mark's flies. "So one idea, to destroy Sherlock. Two ways to do it. One, to kill me, the other, to marry me. The second one was yours."
He stared at her, then drankâit was, indeed, plain water. He put the shot glass down on the bar. "Another," he told the bartender.
Sherlock, he was certain, would still be awake. He could never sleep, after a run through the London streets. He'd always wanted to keep talking, keep John up, all night long: one more topic, one more drink, one more moment, spent together, until the sun rose, and the two of them went off to their solitary beds.
William laughed a little, and flushed even more, his cheeks glowing bright red. "I just meantâmost people who buy that system want to use it to keep tabs on someone. Usually someone close to them."
Mark laughed. "So serious, John. I suppose I always wondered if you'd ever had the chance to find out." He turned, and looked back at the closed door of John's office.
John fought disappointment, even as he recognised that he should have been the one to talk to Mrs. Hudson.
John's shoulders dropped, a bubble of pride filling his chest, his whole body slipping into a familiar feeling, of being Sherlock's second in command, belonging with him. He hadn't forgotten himself. Almost, but not quite. Not entirely.
It was lame, he knew. There was nothing he could say to Harry that would sound any better. He watched his phone as her replies rolled in, accusing him of everything terrible.
She leaned in, her voice a low hiss between them. No one could possibly hear. "You don't love Mark, do you?"
"Was I supposed to do something wrong?" He took a step closer to Mark. He had to show him he wasn't afraid, somehow, to demonstrate that he was still willing to go along.
John came back to consciousness as if surfacing through deep waters he'd been drowning in for a century: slowly, painfully. The first thing that came to him was the smell of the place he was in. Here was dust, and an undertone of damp, and the kind of neglect that came from having the windows closed for too long. The air was cold. He rested on something soft, a bed maybe. There was a blanket draped over him, a lumpy pillow under his head. His mouth was dry.
Mark gasped, and closed his eyes, as John pressed his hand against him. "Originally there was only one plan. I was supposed to watch, and, when the time came, and it was certain that Sherlock still cared about you, to take you out."
One of the nurses, Allie, punched John on the arm. "So? We were just saying how wonderful you two look together. How does it feel to be hitched?"
Across from him, Sherlock sat, looking downcast, pushing the last of his cake across his plate. Cath, who had spent the first course trying to talk to Sherlock, had given up, apparently, and turned her attention on Harry, who was openly flirting, running her finger around the rim of her water glass, eyes bright. John supposed he couldn't blame her. Cath was very pretty, in her lilac dress, with her dark hair spilling down her shoulders in curls.
John watched as Sherlock opened his trousers, and slid them down over his hips, his cock half hard in his silky boxers, which he pushed down as well. He pulled his socks off last, then stood, unclothed, and watched John, head down, eyes coy under his lashes, as if this were his first time. It might well be: John hadn't asked. He hadn't wanted to make things strange between them, and it didn't matter, because it was their first, the most important night of John's life, and the best thing he'd ever done, besides taking a bullet for Sherlock.
On the other side of Mark, Mrs. Hudson was talking, thank Christ. John lifted his gaze to watch her, as Mark's hand slid across his knee, and squeezed. John pressed his palm to it, and held it still.
There was no further account of Baccarin himself, until he'd turned up dead at the beginning of November.
John squinted at him. "You're probably right." He settled back down against Mark's chest, and took Mark's hand, slipping into habit, rather than let his mind wander to all the places it wanted to go. He wondered if he should panic, deny everything. Ask Mark if he'd told anyone about the cabbie. He chose redirection. "What about you, though?"
In saying nothing, Sherlock had answered him, in the kindest way he could. He didn't return John's feelings. Not the ones John had offered.
John walked toward it, and hesitated. "This isn't some kind of Mycroft prank, is it? Because I'm really not eager to see your brother tonight."
John himself had been totally transparent too, apparently, because the network had known to send a man, instead of a woman, to seduce him, to infiltrate his life. It had been obvious to everyone but him. The skew of his attractions. The things that inspired him, moved him.
None of that mattered now. John had the facts of the situation, had almost everything he needed. In another forty-eight hours, he would have his hands on the flash drive, and he and Sherlock would have something concrete they could take to the authorities.
He left the bedroom, and went back down to the kitchen, and grabbed his phone from the table. He picked it up, and swiped to unlock it, and hovered his thumb over his messenger, blood running thick and hot, his heart pounding, as he remembered what he and Sherlock had agreed, that they needed to stay apart for John's safety. John's blog post, and the fact that the two of them had worked together, had triggered the most recent activity in the network.
A dreadful mistake. John had wondered, many times, if he could have simply forced the conversation he'd wanted to have with Sherlock, after Battersea, if he'd put everything out on the table back then, if things would have been different. If Sherlock might have not thrown himself from the roof of Barts.
Trying to go back, then. John's mind leapt on the idea of the watch, the way he'd interpreted it. Maybe Sherlock hadn't meant that he wanted to go back to the old days at all, but to the train carriage, to the moment when John had confessed, and Sherlock had frozen, and seemed to reject him.
Mark grinned. "Although, maybe I should be jealous. Six months of bristly kisses for me, and his nibs comes back to townâ"
"Okay," John said, his voice barely coming out. He couldn't make any matching promises. They would all seem ludicrous, in light of the wedding.
"God, I want to be kissing you right now," he said, as the laptop finally displayed its welcome screen.
"John Watson in need of something to do? Find a case that will interest him." Sherlock's smile had grown lopsided. "Can't do that so much any more, but maybe, at some point, we'll be able to again."
"You're going to have to make it up to them, for both of us," Mark told John. "I think you're obligated to have something. Besides, your sister's already got a good start on you. Why don't you join her?" His gaze slid over toward the bar, set up just outside the reception hall.
He sniffed, and shifted. Sherlock's gravestone sat, a bland listener, with a blank look. It gave him nothing, and it asked for nothing. A very poor substitute for Sherlock.
He imagined getting Sherlock alone somehow, in some private room, some back alley, some small, separate place where he could hold him, and tell him everything that was in his heart. More than ever before, he wanted to take comfort in him, take shelter in whatever it was they might mean to each other.
Mark laughed, sardonic, as if the apology were the greatest outrage. "They're packaging our order for takeaway, John. I explained that there's been a family emergency. If you want to get out of here, we can go home, any time. Or, stay. Talk. I can go, if you want to catch up."
At home, John removed his coat and shoes, and paced the length of the living room, hopes high, heart singing. He hardly knew what to do with himself, now that he was alone. The details of persisting in timeâfood, water, restâseemed completely secondary to the high, sweet notes that played in his blood, the music of everything he felt for Sherlock. It sustained him with hope, and the sure knowledge that soon, the two of them would move forward together.
He paused, thinking about Sherlock, and how best to protect him, how urgent it was for him to preserve the status quo. He returned to the message:
Mark sighed against John's bare upper lip, and ran his tongue across it. His hands roamed, as John opened his mouth to Mark's tongue, and slotted his thigh between Mark's legs.
It all seemed familiar, as familiar as the story of how they met, and how they got together. It was just like the slow, teasing talk that had turned to flirtation, the prelude to their first kiss, offered without words, in the front hallway of John's flat. This was a new seduction, darker, much more dangerous, but John thought he could see in it a continuity with who Mark had always been. Mark had, after all, talked more like a man in love than ever, when he'd returned from his trip. He was still trying to show John who he was. Still revealing himself.
Wednesday went like the first day back at work after a holiday usually did: routines moving like rusty gears; the hitch and grind of patient after patient, each one full of typical post-holiday complaints: indigestion, nervous exhaustion, flu.
John sipped, obediently, managed to swallow, then downed the rest. His head swam. Surely alcohol wouldn't really help, but he would do anything for this to be over, anything to gather the pieces of himself back together, so he could go to Sherlock, stop Sherlock from fading, or leaving, or dying again, right in front of him, or whatever it was he was trying to do.
John imagined Sherlock, alone in his flat, convincing himself that it was better that way. John had thought, he'd believed, that the two of them had been a sort of family, along with Mrs. Hudson, in the old days. He didn't think it had been so bad, for Sherlock, back then. Perhaps he'd been wrong.
The vicar cleared his throat. Beside him, Sherlock was looking at the floor as if it had just done something particularly intriguing. He'd flushed a bit, his eyebrows raised. From her place on the front pew, Harry gave a soft whistle.
John was full of nerves, suddenly, at the prospect of seeing Sherlock again, even though it was all he wanted. He rode through the streets until he ran out of breath, until he was worn out and the muscles of his legs shook. He returned home, half resolved to break through his own resistance, get in touch with Sherlock, and push past all this awkwardness once and for all.
He watched, as Sherlock sat with his head bowed, and he wondered what it was, exactly, that Sherlock had expected to happen. John's heart squeezed, and he pulled himself up onto the hard forward edge of the chair, and teetered there.
"Still, we have to try, don't we? What else can we do?" He put his hand on the back of Sherlock's neck, and ran his fingers through the soft curls at his nape.
"You could. If it would make you uncomfortable. I know you don't usually go in for this sort of thing."
All at once, John understood that he'd missed a great deal. Sherlock was very pale, his skin a clammy white, circles under his eyes. Not sleeping, maybe. He looked as though he hadn't seen the sun for years. John studied the way Sherlock held himself, the way he shuffled from one foot to the other. Discomfort. John had assumed it was impatience, with him, with the conversation. Maybe it was physical. He wondered what other injuries Sherlock was hiding, under his clothes.
Mark's cheeks had grown red, in the cold November air, in the heat of the argument. He grinned. "I suppose not."
John spared a glance at Sherlock, who had allowed a bit of a smile to move across his lips at Mrs. Hudson's story.
It would be Christmas in four days. John thought of Baker Street, and wondered if Sherlock would be putting out the fairy lights they'd used to decorate the flat, their one good Christmas together. He might have to go see for himself. Sherlock had been so funny, over the last three weeks, putting effort into the wedding, looking out for John, even though he hadn't once been in direct contact. It was such a backward way of showing that he cared, but John recognised it for what it was. He thought he did.
And then it was just the two of them, in the quiet room, the light from the lamp glowing warm across their bodies. John's leg throbbed, and his heart swelled, as Sherlock spread himself out beside him, and tugged the blankets up over them.
John looked down at their joined hands, remembering the first time Mark had used those words, before John's aborted proposal at the Landmark. He forced himself to laugh, a harsh bark that met the burst of laughter and catcalls from their gathered friends. He felt his face flush red. He had to keep smiling. It was a joke, after all. The whole thing was.
John slipped down, and ran his fingers under the waistband of Mark's pants. He wondered, briefly, if he should talk, try to explain himself, but Mark was no idiot. He surely knew John had needed the release, needed to relieve some of the tension of the day. Besides, Mark was half hard, and moaning, as John slipped his pants off, pulling them all the way down over his ankles, and dropping them on the floor.
He took twenty quid from his wallet and gave it to her. After she left, he sat at his desk for the fifteen minutes that remained before his next patient, fighting the thin, bright thread of longing that constricted his heart, and would pull him all the way to Baker Street, if he let it.
"I'll just go fetch the coat," Arthur Davies said. He patted John on the shoulder, then returned to the table by the windows, moving slowly, deliberately.
"I'm sorry." John squeezed the hand holding his. It was a lifeline, after all. "I promised myself I wouldn't fall apart. It's just." The sentence ground to a halt.
"You're going to leave in three minutes through the exit by the loos, and go round to the fire door behind the vicar's office, where Sherlock will meet you so you can have a look at that flash drive. Between us and Little Miss Secret Weapon, we figure we can keep
Through the window, he saw that the beekeeper was fussing over the hives near the cottage now. John watched, wanting to bang on the window, draw attention, even as he studied the figure, and recognised that it was almost certainly not Sherlock. The proportions were all off, the shoulders very broad, if stooped, the torso bulky. A man, and probably an old one, given how slowly and methodically he went about his business. Not John's man.
On the dance floor, Mark took Sherlock in his arms, and started to move with him, and John shut his eyes against the sight of it, confused, wanting to do what Mark was doing, wanting none of it.
He typed his response with gritted teeth. If Mark needed him to be besotted, and blind, that's what he would be.
"It's perfectly understandable, John. Two years is a very long time. And the way Sherlock went about it, pretending to die, then coming back. I would expect that might be difficult to forgive."
Saturday morning found John standing in the aisle of an electronics store, under harsh fluorescent light, squinting at the text on the side of a home security kit.
John faked his way through a laugh, even as he realised he might have a lot of explaining to do, when all of this was over. He shot a glance at Sherlock, who was staring at the floor with such an intense focus that he might have burned a hole through it.
When he picked up his phone again, he saw that Sherlock had sent links to three articles about a recent spate of homicides throughout London. John remembered seeing something about them on the news, but he'd been distracted, too far gone on his own personal drama to keep track. He scanned the articles, looking for patterns, for the sort of thing Sherlock would look for.
was the one Sherlock had put a name to, the bearded man who'd been at the bonfire: Thomas Baccarin, found dead in a churchyard close to John and Mark's flat.
"Yeah?" John retreated further into banter. It was easier than facing the implications of the discussion. "What are you going to do about it?"
He needed to be free, he realised, more desperately now. Sherlock was waiting for him. He didn't know it, but their lives, their entire future happiness, depended on what John was going to do next, and how it went.
As he sat at his desk between patients, he folded his hands, and closed his eyes, remembering the feeling of Sherlock's arms around him. He wondered if Sherlock had felt how John did now, when he'd been on his way home from exile, and he'd known he was going to see John again. Optimistic. Hopeful, perhaps foolishly so, that the hole he'd made in their lives could be repaired.
John took him by the wrist, and tugged him close. He put his arms up around Sherlock's shoulders, and drew him down. It was an awkward embrace, Sherlock stiff and half holding back, his hand moving to grasp John's upper arm, but John held on, his chin hooked over Sherlock's shoulder, shock and pain and something much more happy pulsing through his blood.
"Christ, no," he said aloud, to the empty kitchen. He lurched through a memory of Sherlock's faceâtender, vulnerableâas he held out his arms for John. Sherlock's voiceâquiet, tentativeâas he asked,
John put his hand on Mark's hip. He was trying not to shake, trying not to give the game away. He decided to talk. It was the safer option. If he stuttered, well, he'd told Mark enough times that he was no good at sharing what he was feeling.
John felt a bit ridiculous, planning to use a system made to deal with petty theft and break-ins to prevent his own potential kidnapping and murder. He had to admit, however, that he liked the idea of taking things into his own hands. About damn time.
"What is it?" he whispered, one hand still firm on the skin of Sherlock's lower back, the other caressing Sherlock's cheek. Sooner or later, Sherlock would have to confess, about the timer, and the fact that he'd stopped it. John wouldn't break the spell, though, wouldn't say that he'd figured it out.
When he spoke, it was without knowing what he would say. "Two years." The words came out through gritted teeth, through the frantic torrent of emotion that wracked him: pain, and confusion, and a thin, blindingly bright line of fierce joy. Too much to bear. He would die of it, he was certain. "You let me grieve. Hm? I thought you were dead."
John giggled. This was good, just talking. Just being here, in the same room, and joking together. They should just do this, all afternoon. Spend time. Get used to each other again.
"Mark and John are now to enter this way of life. They will each give their consent to the other and make solemn vows, and in token of this they will each give and receive a ring. We pray with them that the Holy Spirit will guide and strengthen them, that they may fulfil God's purposes for the whole of their earthly life together."
He could have this, he decided. One night away from everything he was suffering. It was allowed. It was permissible, because he'd been good, he'd followed his own program, he'd done as well as he could, and made things as safe they could be. In a couple of days, he would face the wedding. Everything would change then, and the real game would begin. He had no idea what it would look like, or whether he would survive it, but until then, he had tonight, and the promise of a moment with Sherlock.
John closed the gap between them. "Stop it," he said. It came out sounding irritated. He didn't mean it. He lowered his voice, spoke more slowly, gingerly. "We'll work together. Finish what you started, together."
Sherlock, who had begun to take his frustration out on the papers littering the battered desk, paused in the act of throwing a crumpled ball of newspaper clippings to the floor. "What?"
"Please, John. For all the hurt that I caused you. For not letting you in on the plan, before I jumped. For letting you think I was dead. For coming back too soon. For whatever's about to happen. All of it. For all of it."
"Here I was thinking the same about you." Sherlock said, his voice wavering in a way John had never heard before.
"John, I never asked her to call me that. I would never presume... I wouldn't..." he protested softly.
âI love you, Mary. And I meant what I said back then when I proposed. Meeting you was the best thing that could have possibly happened.â
It was partially because of Sherlock, though he didn't blame him. Sherlock was a very large cog in an only slightly larger machine. A machine that was breaking down as he broke down.
Maybe this part of his life was done and had been for awhile. Maybe he was just only now realizing that.
"Well, your blood pressure is through the roof, your heartbeat is irregular, your hands are shaking and-" She unceremoniously poked his side and he cried out in pain. "Your liver is tender."
Sherlock's warm thighs on either side of him, Sherlock's hips tilted up towards him, Sherlock's body beneath his, Sherlock's cock pressed firm and hard between them. It was heavenly.
"I'm sorry I worried you. I wound up worrying a lot of people. I felt pretty touch and go there for awhile myself but right now, the ground I'm standing on feels kind of solid."
another part of him was terrified of that outside world, with its temptations and consequences and structureless days. The outside world with all the people he'd hurt and abused and generally fucked over. He shivered at the thought but when he looked around he didn't feel so alone.
Sherlock left the room and returned with his violin and bow and sure enough, she broke into a drowsy smile.
With that, he walked out of the flat, down the stairs and away from Baker Street as fast as his feet would carry him.
"He doesn't think I need to work, I beg to differ. We started bickering about it and it blew up into this whole big thing. I felt very righteous at the time. Very firm in my convictions but my w-...a friend told me that I have a tendency to pick fights. That's it my way of avoiding bigger issues. And now, of course, when I think about it, I don't really believe he meant anything by it. I probably shouldn't have been so offended by his offer to take care of me and my daughter. And...while I didn't really want to admit it at the time..it made me want to run and drink. I wanted to drink that anger away. And um, I'm very glad that I didn't."
It was good and fast and there was no time to breathe and no time to talk about anything, least of all a kiss.
But he had given up. At least a part of him. Since May he'd been feeling better, lighter, more agile, more capable. He'd kept up the diet of good food and a lot less takeaway. He started biking to work and just biking about in general. He'd even gotten a ridiculous little basket he'd fitted the front to carry groceries and such. One of the perks of the particular practice he'd joined was a membership in the health club adjacent to the building and he got back into his Location habit of jogging. He was doing everything he was supposed to do to take care of his body and still his stupid fucking, flaccid fucking, limp, pointless cock was doing nothing in return. No progress made. So yes, a part of him was trying to come to terms with the idea that this might just be life.
"Sherlock...I was wondering...my leg, it's playing up again." He began and he wasn't lying. It felt bloody terrible. "Do you think-"
Actually, craving sounded too mild, too minor, almost charming in its minuscule nature. There was nothing small about this...this roaring need and his inability to satisfy it made him want to climb the walls.
"I can't say I'm overjoyed to be here." He looked around. "Are we in Switzerland? Somewhere near Zurich, maybe?"
"Thank you, Hanah, your words mean a lot. And I have to echo Sherlock. I wouldn't be where I am without you." He glanced over and Sherlock. "We wouldn't be where we are."
"As I suspected, which means your constant apologizing and your unwillingness to let it go, is vanity, John."
"I just thought it was time for a change. You know how people shave their heads when they cross the equator? It's like a fresh start, a new beginning. I guess I just wanted something like that. 30 days and I wanted to start again. Thanks for the clippers, James. I'll see you tomorrow."
Up until that point, Iâd never been so scared. I'd never thought about how badly all this could go. Iâd never considered myself much of a religious person but I was lying there, praying âPlease God, let me live. Please God, let me live.â One of them hit me with the butt of the gun and I was out. I came to and Duck was lying beside me in his own blood. I thought he was dead but a little shove and he groaned. I picked him up and half dragged, half carried him home. I tried to get him to go to the hospital but he was too scared.
After a quick drop by at Harry and Clara's where they both picked up handmade Father's Day cards fromÂ Rosie, they were off. Sherlock slid the cards carefully into the pages of their hardcover bedtime reading. "So they won't get bent." he said.
"So you said and I heard you." Sherlock's eyes were locked with his. "John, I heard you. I accept your apology without reservation and I thank you."
"Do you like eggs? Or are you allergic?" She asked picking up a carton. "So many people are allergic to things nowadays." She said with a head shake.
"You're welcome, dear." John replied. He opened the colouring book and the crayons for her and she didn't need much more direction than that.
"He...improved my work. He centered my thoughts, he sent me down paths I wouldn't have considered. I never thought of myself as needing a partner of any sort and now I find myself quite lost...without my blogger."
He stopped if only to exhale and perhaps catch his breath. He closed his eyes and a moment later felt Sherlock's bare hand on his cheek.
"I just think some sort of dynamic shift at this point in our relationship, in our lives, could be dangerous."
"It's like Dad's isn't it? That's what I told Clara. I'm also constantly pointing out how much she looks like you. It's uncanny."
Since The Location was a mystery he wasn't sure how they'd arrived. He hadn't been too surprised when the limo had arrived at an airport. He slept on the plane ride, exhaustion hitting him like a hammer. A respectful tap on his shoulder what felt like five minutes after he closed his eyes let him know they'd arrived.
As it stood John had been trying to determine that all week. There wasn't a part of him that thought Sherlock was embarrassed with them being seen together. Still, it was strange.
But he cut himself off and just avoided knocking her over as he rushed to her bathroom. He slammed the door behind him, flipped up the toilet lid, sank to his knees and proceeded to vomit up what felt like every meal he'd ever eaten. Waves and wave of nausea and gagging followed as he gripped the porcelain and even when he was certain he was empty he couldn't entirely stop.
"I need..." he began but then restarted. "I wish...there was time to process this. I wish there weren't so many bloody people out there waiting for us to come back. I wish we could just freeze this moment and be in it for awhile, you know?"
"It's ok." He said kissing the top of her head as he stroked her back. She felt small in his arms, fragile and small and he felt a surge of guilt at the idea of how much of this world she'd had to navigate alone.
They'd opted for something more casual, a meal at his house. After all, she wanted to see her niece. Which of course was perfect for his purposes.
She broke down in sobs and John felt the tears start to sting his own eyes. He didn't know what to say exactly. The part of him that was still a doctor wanted to ask questions she likely couldn't answer. He wanted to look at his chart to know what had gone wrong.
"But what? Mary, I know this is a dream, I know it's not real. While it's really comforting I know you're not here, love, not really. Even before all this, you were just a benevolent hallucination, my last scrap of sanity taking a form that I trusted trying to pull me back from the edge. You're not a ghost, you don't have precognition. And if I'm just here interrogating myself then I'd like an answer from me."
The room seemed to suddenly have a lot less air in it than it did moments before. Carelessly he flung the laptop to the side as a wave of nausea overtook him. He swung his legs over the side of the bed but upon contact, the floor felt pliable, like wet sand beneath his feet. He hurried toward the loo, staggering through red trees and ionized particles, unsure as to whether his dinner was going to come back up again.
, John." Sherlock said with exasperation. "I choose to ignore the dreary boredom of everyday life but I am not incapable of dipping a toe in when needed."
"I'll look where I choose," Sherlock said, making sure to add a fake amount of haughtiness to his tone at being told what to do. But it was all in good fun and at John's request, he did indeed look up.
"You said it was some bloke you used to study with. That you snogged on your bed and copped feels off one another. You liked him but it didn't go anywhere."
"Once I open this, in my mind and to the world I'm officially a published author. I've produced something and I'll have to produce something again. This isn't just a one and done. I've committed. I've signed on, re-upped."
John kept his eyes shut until he left the room and didn't open them until the creak of Sherlock's footsteps vanished behind the shutting of the bathroom door.
John gave him a cheerful smack on the arse. To hisÂ amusement, he saw Sherlock drop his head and blush.
"My pleasure, Doctor Watson. Now, I should tell you that most patients with ED report that orgasms achieved via prostate massage are not as intense as those to which they're accustomed. Though some do say just the opposite. Also, this is unlikely to help you achieve an erection, at least not fully, but it can go a ways in getting your sexual health back on track. I'm afraid the only real solution is inside you."
"Hypertrophic scarring." John scanned quickly to see if there were any close to the joint as those were most likely to cause issues regarding mobility. The injuries were localized on the back area though there were areas on his sides, near his ribs that had caught someone's brutal attention. The scars were thick, ropey, skin clearly showing that it tried to heal itself, was broken open again and again before finally coming together. "Signs of...infection. Cured now. Punct-Puncture marks caused by some sort of crude instrument, a nail? Perhaps a board with a nail in it. ClearÂ indication of burn marks flanking each side.Â Various fading unidentifiable abrasions. Evidence of sharp trauma to the dermis, possibly going as deep as the underlying trapezius."
Once in their room he tugged off the towel and slipped under the cool, clean sheets to await his partner. Sherlock appeared not long after and John took great pleasure in watching him disrobe. He left his t shirt on but John didn't mind though he had been making more of an effort into coaxing it off of him. He suspected it likely had to do with the bullet wound scar on his chest. He didn't want to be a distraction or an emotional burden at these intimate times. John needed to make it crystal clear to him that he could never, ever be a burden.
Yes, this was good, this was better than good, better than great and from the noise, Sherlock made when he penetrated him just slightly he agreed.
. He was seeing the woman that had nearly succeeded in killing him. He was seeing her behind his back.
I couldn't imagine being displeased with Sherlock at this point and even the little sounds he made as I sucked him were everything I could have wanted. He had a deep, resonant voice, so as far as I knew he might have bellowed when he came but it was so the opposite. There were soft noise almost always ending with a breathy sigh, a whimper, a word so delicately formed that his voice cracked upon speaking it. I felt flushed with warmth that the word more often than not was my name.
They sat there,Â minute after minute, on the cold ground, holding and hugging each other and crying softly in the dark.
Days had their ups and downs. That didn't change. They still got into arguments, though they tried to keep their voices low when Rosie was about. But they fought, they had rows and disagreements and they debated on the best way to trap a killer and the best preschool for their daughter. Sherlock was Sherlock. Obstinate, stubborn, dismissive, frustrating, oblivious. His work was still his work and he was still just as likely to get lost in it and pull John along with him. But that was what he wanted, what they both wanted. They remained who they were. And everything John feared might change for the worse, didn't. And everything he hoped would change for the better, did.
"Alright, there's your answer. Whether you want to let them have their pride in refusing is up to you. I'll support anything you do. One hundred percent."
John pulled the phone away briefly and stared at the screen. It only said "James" which was of little help.
"Yes, yes that is an absolute yes. I don't know how to thank you. I mean, I will pay you of course."
He could see him now, quite clearly and to prolong both his anticipation and fear, John took a little more time than necessary stomping the snow off his boots in the vestibule.
"I'm a failed soldier, a failed doctor, I'm most certainly not a consulting detective and to top things off, I'm apparently a shit writer. Oh, and like I told you, I...got sacked today. I failed a drug test."
I just want her to stop talking. I'm actually a bit afraid. Afraid of what I might hear, what she might say.
He liked it. He didn't love it. But he liked it and that was a start. This was, for now, a secret passion. It was likely to remain secret truth be told. But for a while now the confines of the blog had felt too confining.
But then again, what did he know about relationships or sex or love? He usually managed to fuck those things up quite royally.
"It is everything. Don't expect too much of yourself, don't expect to leap buildings in a single bound. There is a reason why one of the hallmarks of recovery is one day at a time."
We'd need lube and to the best of my knowledge there wasn't any in the house. I could run out. But I was afraid of shattering the moment. Too much time apart. Too much time to think. That's just what could ruin this.
"I'm not going anywhere." He said before gesturing to the mail piled by the door near where he was still standing. "I'll sitÂ down like a good boy and opened my letters."
The second one, newer, but compelling; create a false bottom and get the person into treatment whether they admit they have a problem or not.
"For God sakes I just accepted the identity of being an alcoholic do I have to-..." He trailed off, not at all liking where he was going with this.
"Glad to hear it." He paused and braced himself to answer a question he'd wondered since the day they'd met. "Sherlock...are you gay?"
"Alright! I wanted to know if you'd consider giving us a go. You and me a proper go. I want to date you... I don't want our nights to end with me going up to my room and you going to yours. I don't want it always up in the air when or where we'll kiss. I want to share my life, such as it is, with you. I don't want to just work with you. I want to make love to you. I want you, Sherlock. Just you. I want you. I want a relationship. I want there to be an us."
"I asked several times if I might come over this evening or if you'd like to join me at Baker Street, like the good old days. Both offer still stand. I realize it may sound a bit sentimental for me but I...I can't bear the thought of you being alone tonight."
He'd counseled new mothers on bonding, walked them through the steps to improve it, explained postnatal depression and tried to alleviate their guilt. Just because it wasn't spoken about didn't mean it wasn't normal or natural. It happened. Bonding took work.
"I didn't marry her because he wasn't there." He said slightly defensively speaking more toward his outstretched legs than her. "That isn't what happened. She wasn't my second choice."
"It was a mistake. It won't ever happen again." He opened his hand and I saw it was filled with six small balloons. As he dropped them into the toilet I realized it was heroin. He couldn't help letting out a regretful sigh as he flushed. He then straightened
On the contrary, John noted he seemed to be enjoying himself immensely. What had started as a simple trip to a shop to pick up a few extra lights to string round the tree had turned into an ornament and stocking extravaganza that kept them quite busy once the tree was delivered.
They'd shared this moment before, of course, and he would never denigrate those times. But this was so different and dare he say it, so much better. There was always something to be said for losing yourself along with your partner but to do it while one of you was inside the other...it was everything he'd been missing and everything he couldn't describe.
Just that question alone brought more thoughts rushing back to him than he thought he could handle. The wave of nausea rose, crested and then, thankfully, calmed.
But she was shaking her head and far faster that he could react she had grabbed it and emptied out the bullets. Vaguely he wondered where she'd learned to do that.
What are they going to do to you? I don't want to burden you with all this not after what you just did for me and Mary. I don't even know how to discuss this with you without running the risk of sounding hysterical. But Christ what are they going to do to you?
"The spirit of the spirits." He chuckled aloud wishing he'd come up with that line at AA. An old woman who had been about to take her blood pressure looked at him warily and decided against it. This unfortunately only made him laugh harder which made the pain shoot through his half numb/half raw mouth.
"I don't understand. This is when I was...when I was truly losing myself. You bought the ring then. You were going to ask
"As much as I do love theater do you think you could truncate this speech and get to your point?" He snapped.
In the end, he'd stepped outside and rather than write a new note he'd just scratched out the second part and written;
"Massage is just the tactile application of pressure and the manipulation of the anatomy, specifically certain muscle groups with alternating focus and pressure."
"After the cleanup, it was unlivable, right? It had absorbed this massive amount of radiation, a deadly amount. The government bulldozed some of the trees and buried them in these trenches and then they covered the trenches with sand. So, now there are these dead trees still standing tall and they're not decaying and they're red because of the radiation. They're dead but they're still standing. And the ground beneath your feet is mushy and uneven because of the sand and the other dead trees. Anyway, recently the forest caught fire. And I mean everything there is dry it's basically just acres of kindling. The fire brigade who went into battle it, they were able to contain it but they came out with these stories. Stories about what it felt like, the heat, this different kind of heat not from the fire but from the trees and the ground. They said they felt itchy and prickly, it made their skin crawl. It set off all these primitive sensations that just made them want to run away. It just screamed danger and the further they went in the worse it got. I read that story in one magazine or another or online or something and I became kind of obsessed with it. What it must have been like and felt like. Then it started to creep into my dreams and my nightmares.
"But they only care about the reindeer onceÂ he's provenÂ useful to them. One of the final lines is Then all the reindeer loved him. They don't love him. They know their lives depend on him so they employ obvious and rather disgusting flattery."
"I think so. And I feel good. I've quit smoking again, divorce finally came through. I think I'm ready to move on."
"You have a way of making genius sound like an insult." He grumbled good-naturedly as he took the instruments.
"Of course he does. It's his sister. Typically he meets us there. We agree on a Saturday and that's that."
âYeah, he wrote me a letter some years later. It made itâs way to where I was staying when I was finishing up my time at Barts. He told me he had joined the army, that that was his only chance to be safe and get away. That he had done as many tours as they let him but overall he felt safer now. Might even consider coming home soon. He inquired about my health, how I was doing. He was surprised Iâd jumped into med school and he hoped maybe Iâd write him back if I wasnât too angry. He apologized again and again.
The room filled quickly and people segregated themselves off, talking in small groups. John decided to do what he always did in these situations; take out his phone and looks terribly busy. He pretended he didn't notice the man who walked over and sat down next to him until he spoke.
It could be from anyone, it could be anything and it didn't necessarily have to be bad. He was existing now in that space between what is and what could be and he was breathing deeply as possible lest the hammer drop any day now.
"You're just sleepy." John teased and his bedmate made a little 'Mmm' sound of assent. "Thanks for taking me to bed."
When he was younger the moans and groans from one conquest after another had beaten it back. Years after that he hurled empty bottle after empty bottle toward it. Of course, it learned how to duck. Nowadays he threw his pills and for awhile they worked. But it still tried to get in. He'd see long fingers prying open windows, creeping under door frames but for the most part, he kept it at bay. But it also meant his world was limited to the environment he could control. He could control Baker Street, for the most part, but outside that door, it glommed onto him and he couldn't shake it. And sometimes, when he came home, it came in with him until he could banish it with another dose, or a case or a call from Rosie or an embrace from Sherlock.
"Spare me, John!" He shouted back. "This flat is far too small to hold you, me and your piety. Don't you DARE pretend there is only one addict at 221 B Baker Street!"
With a pathetic cry he flushed the toilet and for a few moments closed his eyes, resting his face upon the seat. Finally, he forced himself to sit back and he went from rocking on his heels to thumping down on his backside. He looked around her bathroom, trying anything to ignore the roiling of his stomach and the clenched muscles in everyÂ limb. Her rug was frilly, thick and the same sort of olive green as the appliances in her kitchen.
In what was clearly a manifestation of his over-preparedness Sherlock opened the bottle of lube and drizzled a healthy amount into his hand and began to coat his cock with it. John already considered himself well lubed from the fingering session but he kept quiet and only gazed at his husband with a soft smile. He near ready to jump out of his skin with want, but he knew his partner needed to be handled delicately.
The rest of the day was almost guaranteed to have a manic pace but for now, as Sherlock showered John leisurely started on breakfast. Mrs. Hudson had come round for a visit and as he beat a few eggs in a bowl they chatted about their upcoming day.
"I came in here so angry, angry at you. I just had this chyron running through my mind "I'm a Goddamn doctor too. You're not better than me or smarter than me."
... But, would asking him to be, to do any of those things be more or less than what they already shared?
Though he did enjoy preening for awhile, eventually, the attention grew to be too much for Sherlock. Their phones were ringing off the hook, emails seemed to be flooding in nearly every few seconds and there was a gathering gaggle of reporters outside. So, for Sherlock, "eventually" meant around 3 o'clock that afternoon just as John was returning from his meeting. Well, not his meeting. He'd had to go to a different one that was a bit out of the way just to avoid the paparazzi. He had, in a way, willingly given up his anonymity, but it wasn't fair to anyone else in any group he might make use of.
"Thank you, Mother. We'll drop our things in our rooms." He said quickly before heading out of the kitchen.
John exited the bedroom and grabbed the sheet Sherlock had left for him on the kitchen table. It was Friday and it looked like there were several meetings to choose from. Checking his phone it was a little after 8 AM. There was a meeting at 9:15 at a local church, St. Boniface and as it seemed just as good as any other choice he made up his mind. John hurried upstairs to his bedroom and grabbed a set of clothes for the day before heading back down to the shower.
He paused again as Sherlock returned, stuffed bee in hand and came to stand next to him, right at his side. It renewed his confidence and he continued, his voice stronger.
"I mean, you've been hanging about the flat because you're worried about me. You haven't left, not really since I got home. It must be driving you crazy."
You're currently exchanging your phone for a newer model. I've had the same phone since we met. I found that upgrades tend to bring more problems than solutions.
"Who? Sherlock? You think I'm here at the behest of Sherlock Holmes? He's not in a position to send anyone anywhere these days."
"Have you ever felt like nothing mattered anymore? Like, there's a limit on how much of yourself you can put into the world and you've reached it? You've reached your limit? You dig and you search but there's nothing there anymore. Have you ever felt that way?"
"Darling, I didn't know. And for the record, you're not like that anymore. Give yourself a little credit."
They'd started at around 8 in the morning and by noon they were nearly done. As Sherlock was securing everything in the back John took Rosie by the hand and walked her room by room, snapping her picture on his phone in each one. She loved having her picture taken and he liked the idea of his last memories of this home being of her smiling face, little hands on hips in the empty rooms.
This went on and on and on becoming routine for them. Even the slightest pain would somehow need immediate attention and so another session would be initiated. It started to be how they wound down the evening, how they said goodnight to one another. And if John wasn't mistaken he saw as much craving and need in Sherlock's eyes as he himself was feeling.
John folded the letter in half, stuffed it in his other pocket and leaned his head back to rest it on the wall. He couldn't hear what they wereÂ saying in the other room and frankly, he didn't want to. There were few things quite so awful as being forced to listen to yourself being discussed with worried tones and furrowed brows. Glancing around he noticed that Sherlock had his music stand out. That meant he had been planning to play something for them tonight. He could also smell food that didn't seem to be their usual take away fare.
"Even in my admittedly shambolic state, I am still your doctor, hmm? So do as I say and lie back. Now."
"Look, I'm sorry about all this. He's a mate of mine and he's going through a bit of a hard time." John didn't have to look to see what happened next. He heard the snap of the leather as Greg opened the holder to reveal his badge. He didn't even have to say it, he just flashed it and that was enough.
"They're four doctors looking for a GP to join a multidisciplinary practice. Beautiful surgery, quite modern, looking to serve the underserved of the city, young, multicultural, diverse. Great set-up, great blokes, there's even a sign on bonus. I put in a good word for you so with your CV and a great interview I think you're in."
John opened his mouth to say something, a few things actually but the two main ones being; 'Thank you for the compliment' and "You sounds like a proud dad.'.
John lay there, his stomach churning. This was selfish. This was horribly, horribly selfish. He was using him, like some sort of rent boy, like a bed warmer. Did his friend get any pleasure out of this at all? Good God was he just being nice?
know. I must have deleted that." He gave his head a little shake. "The boys I was interested in, if only in passing, weren't interested in me. I found them to be intellectually anesthetizing anyway. I found most people to be that way. It seemed the wisest course of action to pull away on all fronts just to preserve my sanity. This wasn't just about not being able to get a date, John."
After he'd left Nora's office he'd been escorted to his room which he was too tired to even give a once over. As he was getting undressed someone knocked on the door and with irritation he invited them in.
"No, they've been perfect.Â Thanks, I do appreciate it. I'm going away for the weekend and I'd rather make a good impression without having to ask that all my food be porridge." He joked easily.
"You know your stuff." She said with a smile. "Every so often we need to take inventory it really helps to stave off the wallowing. Soaking in your self-obsession only clouds the real issues we haven't reached yet. So, that's your assignment. I'm not giving you a due date other than they need to be completed before you leave rehab. Other than that they'll be finished when they're finished. Ok?"
But...I'm 12 days clean. I haven't been clean since June, almost exactly 4 months ago. A 4-monthÂ slide that I have hopefully stopped. I can't say I feel better, exactly. Relieved, yes. But not better. I've got a therapist in here now and Sherlock must have gotten Hanah to send over some of her notes, likely edited or redacted, because he already has a good grasp of who I am and why I'm here. That's a relief. This is a regular place, by which I mean, no one walking these halls is a spy. But that's alright. I don't think Sherlock's 2-year absence or Moriarty or secret work we've done for the government is likely to come up this time around. I think I can be honest about the present and still sanitize my past for public consumption.
âI didnât ask you to call me that, John. You effectively volunteered. Now, either have the courage of your convictions or keep your mouth shut.â
He didn't talk to Duck much. They exchanged letters now and then but John found a way to write about anything but himself. His friend was the same way. And so, over the years, they exchanged sheets of paper with word after word that said absolutely nothing.
The Vicodin had started out as two every six hours right after the work on his tooth. After the first prescription ran out he'd been given another one but the assigned dosage was lower, just two a day. But he'd liked the 4 per day. The 4 per day had felt right.
They'd been tailing an assailant through the city for the better part of the night. Things had been going well until he'd caught wind of them and they taken off after him on foot.
They continued on like that, John bringing him to theÂ peak then letting them both back down again until Sherlock had had enough or too much depending on how one looked at it.
Thank you...That sounds so shamefully, painfully inadequate but thank you. Thank you for giving Mary her life, our life. But I never wanted you to lose yours in the process, mate.
The doctor had just retaken his seat, with a small grunt, after getting out of shower that had done absolutely nothing for him.
"I'm fine." Sherlock said before he swallowed hard. "I was in bed...sleeping. I believe the knock on the door must have startled me."
"That wasn't you." Sherlock said plainly. "I said I came because of the letter and that was true. I came here to see what exactly was happening to you."
Changing positions John rolled atop him, wanting, needing to have their bodies as close as possible. He thrust both hands into Sherlock's hair, sinking his fingers into the curls and scratching his scalp lightly. Sherlock swore softly thoughÂ it was largely muffled against his mates lips. John felt Sherlock possessively, tightly sling an arm around his waist tugging with that same desperate need for closeness John felt. Eventually, it crawled up his back and into his hair, cradling his head and angling it the way he wanted.
"Alright, darling," John said with a smile. "Truth be told, I'm a bit knackered myself. Wouldn't want to disappoint you if I'm not up to par."
He didn't know why he was still holding on when Sherlock was right here offering to solve it for him.
With a bit of effort as it battled against the packed snow, the SUV pulled up to the building, idling in front. His iPod had abruptly died, due to the temperature or a faulty battery he wasn't sure but as he shoveled John heard the driver get out and circle round to open the door for the passenger in the back.
"Not this time, you taste sweet enough. And one more thing. Don't warn me when you're about to come. Just do it. I want to taste you and swallow you. Iâm not going to pull away. Ok?"
"Ok, I hear you, I'm listening and I want you to feel comfortable. I need you to feel comfortable. But I also need you to know that this is normal. People can attend dozens of AA groups until they hit what they feel is their right one. The one for them, the one that helps them want to stick with it. If you had been successful right out of the box I would have called you the luckiest man alive. As it is, you're just average, like everybody else. So, why not try the one meeting you haven't?"
John followed behind the doctor, the sounds of the hospital too loud, the clanging of bedpans, the ding of lifts arriving at their floors, the moans of patients, the beeping of machines.
"Afternoon everybody. I'm Eric, I'm an alcoholic and I'd like to welcome you to this Closed Discussion meeting of Alcoholic's Anonymous. Before we get going today I want to start by reading from the Big Book. Can you all turn to page 66?"
Well, he was effectively caught now. He supposed he could at least make an attempt at playing it cool.
The hand gripping Johnâs arse loosened once again but the beautiful creature before him, though silent had clearly entered a completely different realm than before. He was squirming beneath him but not with discomfort, it was needy, lusty, trying to figure out what position best suited him, what he wanted.
"Alright, ok, yes, I understand." Duck said in that voice John recognized as the one people used to placate the drunken or the mad.
After trekking back down they found the car waiting as promised. They rode back to The Location and were met with the sight of people already leaving, saying their goodbyes and heading away.
For you new people...people with 2 days, 1 day, 5 hours I know you're looking at me and you're thinking "God, I wish he'd just shut the fuck up and sit down. And don't worry, I'm about to."
"Mycroft. He was here and he told me that if you called to say everything was taken care of even clothes. I didn't know what he meant. Oh, John, are you really getting treatment?"
"We have never been what you might call friends, John. But I have respected you, your limited talents and your place in Sherlock's life. You had value to him and so you had value to me. When you lost your wife and your grip, your value to my brother held steady but for me it began to depreciate. It now sits at zero. I do not care if you choose to take your life. I do care if you choose to take my brother with you. This is your opportunity to right what you have wronged."
"We made something beautiful and perfect and more pure than either of us could ever be when we made her." She said fighting hard to keep the tremor from her voice.
"That bastard always made me smile. When he wasn't making me furious...Shit. I'm going to miss him."
"No, no that's not necessary." He replied and John tried to push down any twinges of hurt. "I was thinking you need your own account. People should be able to contact us both. I have a feeling you might get a different sort of mail than I."
He noted the difference in his treatment now as opposed to The Location. Upon entering that facility he'd been angry, hostile and while clearly terrified ashamed to admit it. He'd bristled at the fact that no one was calling him doctor, no one was treating him with the respect he thought he'd earned and deserved. But he felt so different this time around and the intake nurse at least was treating him differently. Maybe he seemed calmer, more professional. But in any case, there were moments where it felt as if they were both discussing a patient, not him. That distance was for some reason helping him to speak.
They were undeniably a touch clingy with one another even though they'd never admit it and never call the other one on it. John still felt rather sensitive of his feelings being so raw and obvious, at least on certain days. And he knew Sherlock did as well. That didn't stop them from lovingly shadowing the other like puppies. For instance, John liked the solitude of a hot, solitary shower, he always had, but lately, he'd found himself missing Sherlock's company even for that short time.
"Ok, John." He said, leaving the space he'd made himself in the V of John's legs and coming to rest atop him. "If I go to fast or too hard or if anything hurts, tell me and I will stop immediately."
"Also..." Sherlock hesitated. "I...after I would leave you room I would..." He cleared his throat. "Take care of myself as well."
It took barely any time at all for John to return the kiss and soon Sherlock felt eager hands on his waist and hips.
What if he sat down and told Sherlock the truth. He loved him. They loved each other. Maybe they could just talk. Things were after all, better now.
John flopped onto the bed and grabbing hold of his hand tugged Sherlock in after him wanting to start up the kissing they'd taken time for at every stoplight from the reception to the inn.
"A personality test to determine who is and isn't an adrenaline junkie and how much of a junkie they are."
Still chuckling softly John began to kiss Sherlock's bare shoulder. They were both still naked from earlier, neither having bothered to put on pyjamas.
After chores was social hour; everyone either huddling together in groups and disappearing into great clouds of smoke or lining up at the front office to retrieve their cell phones to call home.
"I don't need his help and I don't need his protection. And his thinking nearly resulted in your death. We can remain business associates and nothing more."
No one wants to admit that knowing someone, loving them includes, well, knowing when and how much they piss but it was true. You got into habits when you shared a life with someone and you knew their patterns even when you didn't know you knew. Sherlock getting up more than once didn't fit the mold of what John knew. Being a doctor, of course, only made things worse as he found himself silently cataloging everyone's behaviors and matching them up against a running chart n his head. Any deviations immediately started him cross referencing symptoms and illnesses.Â Sherlock, especially set off alarms because he was the one person who was guaranteed not to mention it if he were sick.
Just then, Sherlock emerged from the reception hall, where the caterers were still rearranging furniture. He held his head high, imperious as he ran his eyes across the room. He scanned the bar, looking at John briefly, before moving toward the dessert table, picking up a plate, and glaring at the fruit bowl.
This man, this funny man with the terrible French accent, like something out of a cartoon, looked just like Sherlock.
John thought, with bitterness, of how weak he'd been, in the time of Sherlock's absence, believing that the game was over. He'd let his guard down, and had made himself into a ripe target. A fool. And Mark had played on that, appearing as if out of nowhere, as if he was a source of hope and goodness, helpful and warm and true. He'd slipped into John's life like a knife into butter, worked John open, worked the fact of his grief, his vulnerability. Found himself a quiet little corner to curl up in, and wait for Sherlock to come back, as efficient as any spider.
He listened, as Mark's footsteps thumped down what sounded like a set of four stairs. A moment later came the sound of an engine starting outside, and a vehicle driving away. John was alone. He offered a silent thanks, yet again, to Harry, for her trick with the water. Mark had probably lowballed the drug dose, to avoid suppressing John's nervous system too much. If John could just find his way back to full awareness, and get himself moving, he could get ready for whatever came next. With an effort, he managed to shift under the blanket, wiggling his fingers, and then his toes. Finally, he opened his eyes.
John looked at the faint, familiar lines at the corner of Mark's eyes, the silver hair at his temples. "That's funny. I feel like you never do anything else."
He was rambling, but he couldn't shut up. He had questions, and he was full of hope, and if there was any chance that he was right about Sherlock's hesitation, well. He would say anything. He would wait as long as it took to get an answer. "Maybe he didn't want anything at all, beyond friendship," he said, because he felt he had to. It was selfish, not to allow for all possibilities. "Maybe it's become awkward somehow. I don't know. I can't speak for him."
"Hmm?" He was aware his voice was dreamy, as he followed the light of Sherlock's torch. He forced himself to focus. Someone had attached small square packets to the sides of the vent, all the way up. John knew what they were. "Demolition charges."
While the coffee was finishing, he went upstairs, showered hastily, and changed into his work clothes. He chose an outfit for the eveningâblue trousers, chequered shirt, blue jumper, brown jacketâfrom his side of the closet, and folded and rolled everything carefully, so it wouldn't crease while it was in his backpack. After work, he would change, then head over to the address Greg had given himâsome pub he'd never heard of.
John stared at him for a moment. He thought to ask questions about how they would get back, about what he could expect to find, but Sherlock had clearly gone to a lot of trouble to set all of this up, and he didn't want to break the spell. He wanted it to never break.
The nurses laughed, and Allie raised her glass, a tumbler filled with ice and something pink. "Cheers to that!" She took a sip. "Hey, married men, I don't see the two of you drinking. What's going on with that?"
Now, George and Vince swept Mark aside, taking turns shouting at him over the music and flirting with him, and the other nurses. Bill danced next to John, sipping from a bottle of lager, then leaned in, and yelled in his ear.
Mark turned on the light by John's bed. He looked worn with care, dark circles under his eyes. "Blood tests normal. They don't think you got too much exposure. Chest x-ray deemed unnecessary, unless you want one, to be certain."
John's entire nervous system was humming, his skin buzzing. He watched as Sherlock fumbled over the device under the floor, his fingers illuminated by its pink and blue light.
John studied Mark's face in profile, as he looked out the window. Neither of them had grown up in good, safe homes. They'd both had their fair share of misery. Mark had responded by developing a highly polished personality, getting by on charisma and charm. John had sought adventure, and danger, to make him feel like he mattered in the world.
"Well, no. That's, um." John watched the lights reflected in Mark's water glass, then looked up to see the same light dancing in Mark's eyes. He pulled the ring box out of his jacket pocket, and held it in his hands, turning it this way and that. This was definitely the right thing, the right time. "So, if youâll have me, Mark, could you see your way, if you could see your way toâ"
The two of them walked toward the edge of some woods, where Gabriel directed John toÂ a narrow path of hard-packed dirt that moved off among the trees. "Follow this, Sir."
During his first two days in hospital, after the surgery to remove the bullet from his leg, John spent most of his time sleeping, the combination of painkillers, and safety, and Sherlock, finally, Sherlock, pulling his body down into a deep, wholesome rest. He woke intermittently, unable to keep his eyes open for more than a few minutes at a time.
Sherlock turned, and went to the fireplace. He ran his hand over the mantel, fingers lingering on the knife handle that he'd driven through what appeared to be a new sheaf of letters, on fine stationery. "He's clever."
A hand slipped into his, and squeezed. He sighed heavily. The body beside him radiated warmth, comfort. Basic human companionship. Whatever good John could still receive from the world was here, standing beside him.
"Oh my God," Mark groaned, as he ran his hands up John's thighs, and palmed his erection through his boxers. "Take these off." He helped John push the boxers down, freeing his cock.
"All right," John said, his mind full of other, deeper things. "Here we are. And some doppelganger of mine is out partying in my place."
He should have known Sherlock would find him, would somehow know about the danger, would come, in the nick of time. He wished he could speak, say something, make a joke. He felt light, inside. It was all okay, somehow, this, now that the danger was over.
"The name of the church, where they were doing the bonfire." Mark smiled, his eyes shining as he looked at John.
John let his head rest against the pillow. He remembered the sense of disappointment he'd felt, seeing Mark at the bonfire.
The moment threatened to fracture, to pull apart, as they sat in silence, Sherlock thinking whatever it was he was thinking, and John fighting to stay on the bench beside him.
"Remember what I told you," Mark said, as he walked away, heading back toward the party. Â "We're going to have to talk about those files, so I'm trusting you not to peek until the honeymoon."
He supposed he'd failed to be careful, although he couldn't understand how. The world grew black around him, and the darkness took him down, into a dreamless place he could not escape.
A fresh stream of guilt poured through John. He'd flirted with Sherlock, propositioned him, before Sherlock was ready. Set him up to expect more, and then pretended he hadn't meant it. He wouldn't blame him for returning to old habits. John would still hold him accountable, still try to help, but he could hardly blame him. "You haven'tâ"
"Ah." John frowned down at his hands. "Right," he added, feeling like he was on shaky ground, wondering if he should ask if Mark was telling the truth. He took a deep breath.
Their eyes met, and for a moment, the whole terrible ordeal they'd been through hung in the air between them, heavy and burdensome. Then it popped, like a bubble.
