had his arm round Peter shoulders pulling him closely into to his side as they spoke between themselves. Peter clung to his Pop’s side, looking up at him as the slowly made their way up the stairs, Tony pushed quickly past Peggy and Coulson to walk briskly towards his family, “Peter!”
Peter and Natasha crouched down beneath the view of the window, Natasha raised her gun, ready to fire, Peter placed his last web-shooter capsule into his wrist holster. Terrified, Peter could felt his heart beating through his chest, Peter took some shallow breaths before sliding down the wall. Natasha, quickly aimed her gun to peak through the window. Peter tried to pull her down when she didn’t hide quickly enough for his liking. “Peter…” Peter switched onto his knees, poking his head up to look out the window.
Tony stood hunched over the desk, hastily, he typed the final line of code into the program, glancing behind his shoulder as Bruce and Clint helped Steve attach the small devices under the armour pieces of Steve’s suit. Steve exposed his neck back ever so slightly, so that Bruce could place a small device on the inside of the neck lining of his suit. Steve looked over and made contact with Tony’s eyes giving him an anxious smile. He nodded slightly, and Tony grinned and nodded back. The screen alerted Tony to the devices connecting to the system Whipping his head back round to accept the start up of the program. “All operational on my end.” Steve rolled his shoulder and neck, he nodded his thanks to Bruce and Clint.
In depths of the forests in the mountains valleys of Montana, you’ll find old Robinson lake, a beautiful rocky shore lake hidden a couple of hours hike from the main trail, the waters surrounded by its shore and fades into giant evergreens that span for miles in every direction. Set quite nicely just a two minute walk from the fresh water lake is Stark HQ, Montana Division as Tony would lovingly call it, Steve called it one of his favourite birthday presents. The cabin had been Tony’s idea of the ultimate drinking weekend when he was 18, one trip up to the cabin with Rhodey and the college mates ended in the agreement that the hike wasn’t worth it in the end.
“What the FUCK?!” Tony called out. “Did he get anything?” Tony ran through to his room to check. Peter shut the window and asked Karen to investigate the crime scene. “Peter, would you be able to put on the Spider-Mask, So I can use your enhanced lenses to scan?” Karen asked. “Oh Yeah!” Peter had totally forgotten he had the suit on him, Pulling out the mask from the compartment, he pulled it on over his head and watched Karen analysis the room for evidence. Tony came in as Peter was completing the scan of the room, he stood staring at Peter. Peter let out a confused, “What, What is it?”
The music grew a slight fraction quieter, enough to give Peter his thoughts back even for a moment. Not enough for anyone else in the building to notice but enough that Peter didn’t care so long as he could try and get Tony to leave. Reminding him of his promise, but Tony was barely awake anymore. With the music slightly quieter, Peter’s super hearing picked up the confident heavy steps heading towards him. He got his wish.
I'm so sorry this Chapter took so long to edit and write! A small week with the flu wiped me out! I hope the story continues to excite and that you enjoyed this new chapter! See you in the next one!
The goggles lit up with a faint white light, “Captain Rogers, It is great to see you again. Systems diagnostics, Battery life at fourteen percent. Suit armour capacity, nil.” Peter rubbed the back of his neck, feeling kind of guilty for the state of the suit. “No connection to Stark servers, update overdue by seven months. Wrist-shooter, left hand, accuracy failing, maintenance required.”Steve ran his hand down the side of the suit laying on the bed. “You two have been through a lot. I never thought that…this wasn’t one of the easier times in my life, I never wanted you to experience anything like this, I’m sorry that I couldn’t protect you both from that.” Peter shook his head vigorously. “Karen and I we were a team and I couldn’t have done it without you, you’ve literally saved my life!” He shuffled his foot around, suddenly interested in the ground, “Don’t get me wrong, i’ve been,” he paused, taking in a calm moment, “very lonely and I wish that, at times, you or dad would magically appear to help me.”
Peter shuffled his body once more, readjusting the ice balancing on his face from his reclined position on the couch. Flipping over the page of Natasha report from the crash, turning over the page, he sighed, the section on his grand parents death had been brutal in detail but the fact the Steve had been led on to believe that he and Tony had died was insane! “How did he take it?” Natasha looked up from her book, rocking back and forth on the dark wooden rocking chair, the familiar grooves missing from the floor.
Uncle Rhodey was close behind, buzzed but nowhere near as far gone as Tony. Tony was slowly sliding down the back of the booth and to the side, enough to lean on Peter’s shoulder. The noise was beginning to irritate his super hearing, he was getting a headache.
conveniently held at his father’s favourite bar just in time for happy hour. Tony wrote a reminder to look into this on his diary, a gentle knock at the door echoed in the quiet office. “Come In.” Tony lifted his head to three men in suits making their way in, quickly standing against the walls, followed by Director Carter. Tony rolled his eyes, breathing in through his nose, raising his eyebrows he leaned back in his office chair, playing with his father’s pen, spinning it round his thumb. “Official visiting hours are every other Monday between four and six.” Peggy sat down and looked over to one of the copy and paste men in suits, nodding to him. They left the room as quickly as they had entered, not a trace of their appearance.
Captain Rogers and his team were currently in Russia, they were due to check in a week or so. Far from the news, far from the headlines that were reporting on where Tony was. Steve had requested it. It suited everybody. It was just hard for Peggy to be placed in the middle, if she told Tony, he would cut her off, if she told Steve, he’d probably kill her. She knew he was lonely, it was made abundantly clear. Steve’s team had been spotted at the public memorial for the Stark family. They didn’t interact with her, but she watched the footage. Steve had sat in the middle of the congregation, he sang with the congregation, he spoke to the ministers about his grief and how to process it all, it wasn’t much help for him.
Steve was pinned under the tent sheet. Three of them holding him to the dirt. He reacted with a jolt. Jumping up, he whipped the tent off of his head, stepping forward he was hit, immediately gripping at his upper chest, he looks down to his suit. A needle sticking out of his chest, he felt a sort of buzz, his body loosening and relaxing, stemming from him chest, he looked up to Clint passed out on the ground. His vision began to blur, he could hear his own pulse in his ear, he closes his eyes, he’s sure he can smell dirt, it doesn’t bother him that much, he can’t really focus on anything right now. He tries to clench his fist, but he can’t feel the sensation. He opens his eyes one last time, Shield badges on the soldier’s arms. He’s going to have some strong words with Peggy next time he sees her….
He pulled out a white box or at least It was white a long time ago, now faded with many years of life protecting its valuable content. He carefully lifted the lid off the top of the box. Pulling away a small tufted of cotton as well. “This was Steve’s pocket watch.” Tony pulled it out, holding it in his palm out towards Peter. “His mom couldn’t afford much at the time, but she saved up for a year for this one.” He flipped it over to show the back, it was engraved, the tarnished silver hadn’t lost its message.
“Peter, please don’t go to Barbados. And please, don’t let me say I hate him… he was always a dick, but I said I hated him the last time I saw him. It’s one of my biggest regrets. If I say nothing… it will be better than I hate him.” His Dad his tears, grabbing an oil rag to his side, wiping his face, Tony stared at the family photo, “I really miss you buddy, we both do, its really quiet here without you. I haven’t been into your study, so I don’t know if you have any hot chocolate mugs stacked up. I should probably give you into trouble for not cleaning them but you’re not here.” Peter could hear the boom of something heavy hitting the floor behind his Dad. Enough for the camera and the entire desk to shake.
had finally moved from the chair on to the bed next to his husband when Peter’s story showed no signs of ending soon. He threw his arm over Tony’s shoulders and shuffled his body closer to his side. Tony chuckled and Steve could feel it through his bones, It settled deep within him, his little family finally back together. “Peter.”
“Oh also!” Tony clapped his hand down on Peter’s shoulder, “Director Stark or Hellish Howard as I call him, has kept up with Roger’s request, so,” Tony mock standing to attention and gave an exaggerated bow to Peter. “You and I are invited out to the Stark Mansion for the Christmas holidays!” Peter smiled, nodding at the thought, “Sounds good? Do you actually want to go, though?”
“Captain and Birdbrain. Landed at 11AM, ahead of Shield transport I made my way to Stark grounds.” Steve raised his head quickly to look at Clint’s letter. “I paid my respects.
“Well aren’t you a little trouble maker after your own dad.” Natasha hissed out through the pain. Peter took a step back, crossing his arms over his chest, frown clear on his face. “Natasha what are you doing here?” Natasha rubbed her ankle and contorted her face in pain. “I was sent to find you and bring you in, two days ago, I found your track before I could even report in, Shield raided my room, orders to bring me in, alive or dead. I don’t know whats going on Peter but it isn’t good.” Peter sighed. He knelt down next to Natasha’s ankle, “So, Cats out of the bag then?” Natasha laughed and squeezed her face in pain. “yeah, want to explain the webs and the sticking to the walls and such?”
Well he was coming to term with that fact of life, it just didn’t make sense, what would change, he wanted to make that decision, not fate. Until then… he just wanted one of his limited friends back. Steve had … abandoned him, Steve was god knows where in the world, ignoring him,
“I think I look pretty good for 47 and your other dad, wasn’t quite how … I imagined them to be, don’t get me wrong, you just don’t really look like him with the dark hair and all that and I never thought I’d let anyone else in my workshop!” Tony tried to lighten the mood with a small chuckle at the end, he was pleasantly surprised that it did cheer Peter up a little. “What?” Peter couldn’t help but laugh, “you mean Uncle Bruce, your close friends since I was born, you’re like total, Science bros! He only gets in your lab if he doesn’t annoy you or steal any of your naan bread when we order takeaway!” Peter smiles at Tony, who almost show his true emotion – relief.
Open his eyes as the air craft lurched forward when it stopped in the hanger. Bouncing his leg twice to test the injury. He stood up to exit out the back ramp. Natasha stood at the same time, Barton stood in front of her, handcuffs extended. She rolled her eyes, “they would take me a minute to break.” Barton shrugged his shoulders with a cheeky grin on his face, “I know, but it’s the rules for a former everything spy when she enters shield.” He clasped them down on her wrists behind her back.  Steve followed the pair off the aircraft.
“Dads? As in plural” Tony asked. He knew the kid would falter but just not that easily but now he knew he was looking for a guy, which narrows it down for him, Tony has been opened minded about being bi for a couple of years now, yeah society isn’t that accepting but he’s a Stark, always the morally contentious route taken.
Steve took the box, with an apprehensive look over his face, Clint shrugged. He opened the box to find a pair of leather finger less gloves, exactly Steve’s size. “Step 2 – get him to put the gloves on.” Steve pulled off his current gloves, the crusted with the mud and blood mixed into them. Clint winced a little as Steve dropped them on to the floor next to him. Steve inspect the tan brown leather gloves as he pulled them on, they fit perfectly. Stretching out his fingers and curling them to work in the leather. He could feel something crinkling over the back of his hand on one of the gloves. Clint began to read aloud the finished letter.
“He wants you to throw it for him.” Tony said, sitting down legs apart, leaning back into the chair with his arms crossed, using his heels to slightly move the chair around. Sat on the black, rolling desk chair by the ancient looking desktop computer, Tony was observing their interactions.
Clint kneeled down next to Steve, taking the photo out of Steve’s hand to look at it, Steve raised his hand out slightly, as if to stop Clint in case he damaged the photo. He quickly stopped. Clint’s eyebrows shot up. “Uh…wow.” Clint took Steve’s wrist in his hand, placing the photo down gently in his palm. Clint moved back to his stool. Resting his elbows on his knees and his chin resting in his hands. Steve cried. His breath hiccupping and stuttering. He let out a low whistle to calm himself down.
day anniversary together.” Tony said with a slight smirk then sighed, “your Pops lost them on his latest mission, your photo totally fine, digital copies on every Stark server, but that old one of your Pops and I was an old shit-fashioned black and white photo copy, so he wants to make another, ergo, a trip down memory lane.” Peter broke into a grin, running over to Steve by jumping feet first over the couch as the last of the boxes were set down on the coffee table.
“Well, that’s kind of you Stane but I’m more interested In everything female but if you have a sister, she’s more than welcome to join us for drinks.” A cheeky smirk appeared on Tony’s face. Stane’s smile dropped and he dropped his arms. “See you next week Anthony, you should appear in more boardroom meetings. I think Howard would like that.” He bumped Tony’s shoulder on the way out of Peter’s room. They heard the front door slam 30 seconds later.
The Avengers stood silently when the time anomaly closed. Steve took Tony’s hand in his and brought him into his chest. Tony gripped onto his husband’s hips and looked up to him and Steve looked at Tony. Natasha turned to Clint, “We need to have a back up to the plan. We need to be prepared to send someone through.” Steve let go of Tony. “I’m going through. No questions, he’s our son and We’ve given them more than enough time to find him. If he isn’t there the next time this opens, I’m going to go get him.” The team nodded back.
Steve followed Peter down the side streets towards the new apartment, taking in the boy’s appearance, he was definitely younger than Tony, which wasn’t strangest part, more that he looked quite like Tony, something about his face was just similar enough that it was uncanny.
Steve felt faint, he hadn’t felt faint since before the serum, his head was spinning, Tony had a son. Peter was Tony’s son. Peter J. Stark. Huh. He didn’t remotely know how to react as Tony watch Steve stare off into the distance, beyond the anomaly. When he broke his stare, he turned directly to Peter, who was staring into the heart of the sparking orb, flinching anytime a spark would make contact with anything in the immediate area as it made a loud pop noise. He could see it clearly now, the uncanny was actually pure genetics. The hair, the nose, the height everything but the eyes were his … best friend Tony Stark.
“Sure, if you can keep up!” Steve leaned back against the wall, “I’ll meet you in the kitchen in 5?” Peter nodded, “Alright you two, I’m officially going back to bed.” Steve let out a snort and Tony wandered back down the hall to the bedroom. He opened and shut the door behind him, inspecting the room before jumping back on the bed. He rolled the grey sheets over his body and sunk in to the mattress, laying directly over the bed, his head sandwiched between Steve’s two pillows.
“FRIDAY, Scan the fancy glove for an radiation markers, then compare to the file we have on Loki’s scepter.” Tony called out, pulling over two stools for himself and peter. “Boss, the gauntlet is letting off no radiation but is transmitting a low level frequency. Scans show the molten liquid is infused with vibrainium dust and another unknown element.” Peter raised his eyebrow. Inspecting the gauntlet for himself Peter noticed the full bar of the unknown substance along the wrist of the gauntlet, incased by what appeared to be glass, with a small button next to the bar. “So, even just with the vibranium involved, this thing is gonna be like, stupidly hard to break open into its components?” Peter asked his Dad, who was tapping the sides of the gauntlet with an electric wire. Tony nodded, signaling Peter to hand him one of the flat head screwdrivers. Tony took the screwdriver from Peter, and attempted to wedge it under one of the wires on the fingers.
called out.
It wasn’t the other scientist, he didn’t end up married to one of his classmates, it was just one of Peter’s many Uncles…phew. “Then where was your other Dad, he said they weren’t resting until you came home? Not to sound lazy but I seem to be doing most of the work! As per Usual!” Tony jumped up to pull a fake exasperated expression. Peter laughed again, the happiest he’d been since this morning. “Pops feeds the team along with Uncle Sam, they were probably running strategy to the problem while probably making pizza for the family, Sam makes pizza when he’s stressed!” Tony was strangely comforted by Peter tone that he should, in some way, actually know this information about his future family members and their stress coping mechanisms.
Steve actually took a proper look at Peggy, she was tired and worried, Steve should have noticed when he got in, but he’d missed it, tired himself he supposed. “I don’t give a damn about Howard, Steve.” Steve sat up in his chair again, clasping his hands together between his thighs. “Howard is my colleague, but he has tricks up his sleeves and hasn’t been seen in the public for months. Anthony… he is alone in a flat, that is in a very public campus with a kid. I have Shield on him, but he knows how to evade them.” Peggy was getting emotional, she quickly turned to look out the car window.
Steve whipped his head away to stare at the grey concrete wall, far more interesting than the looks of pity from Peggy. She left, following on the heels of Pierce, out the door and down the hallway. Steve gave himself a nodded, impressed with his own acting skills. He quick pulled his arms forward and out of the bonds one by one. Kicking his legs, out of the bonds and jumping to the ground. He took a quick step behind the table and rolled his eyes, they just left his shield leaning against one of the table legs. Its like they want to give him all the help they can before he beats the living crap out of them on his way out the door. Picking up the shield and placing it on his forearm, he gave a good shield slam to the wiring under the table, just incase his escape didn’t
felt Tony just let out a long breath, For a while they thought they weren’t going to hear that voice again, that excitement the slight break of a young man’s voice, arms everywhere when telling his story but tonight,
“Rogers?” Steve raised his eyebrows, mild shock and awe at this Tony, “yep, but no telling anyone, that’s between you, me, your minister and our witness.” Tony gave a cheeky wink when Steve rushed forward, wrapping Tony in a tight hug, he’d lost this, this was his only moments left with his dream,
Gosh, his life sucked. He’d never finished art school and he was always on the poverty line since his father’s death. He joined the army and lost his life, so to speak and now he was in the back of a
Peter woke up on the floor, his neck in a slight pain as he got up from the awful sleeping position. He rolled over on to his back and curled up in to the crab position to stretch out his back. Standing up straight from this position, the early morning sun streaming in from the window through the blinds. He could see the individual dust particulars floating in the air. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d slept that well. Peter spotted a set of weights in the corner, not much but enough for Peter to work with. It had been an hour or so before Peter heard a gently knock at the door.
Tony loves the feeling of flying, he’d open the door of the helicopter if his Aunt Peggy wouldn’t just throw him out of it for scaring her. His face was pressed up against the cool glass window, watching as the forest below passed by, the sun filtering through the trees in the spring afternoon, The hum of the rotors drowsed out the noise of his own voice in his mind, he really wanted to jump out rather than see Steve. Steve thinks he’s dead, he's going to have to bite his tongue and not blame Steve for not getting in touch with him, not trying to find him. He can’t fight him on this but… he hurt just as much as Steve did. Then again, he didn’t think that his best friend was actually dead, just … ignoring him, for no real reason when his parents had been murdered.
and Tony both grinned as they said together, “We love you too, Peter.”
Steve stood tall and silent, using his presence to over shadow Howard. “Am I wrong? All but two of the ‘Howling Commandos’ are dead are they not? All that’s left in your life Ste, is us two, I’m just trying to look out for you buddy, look I can set you up with a nice dame, settle down or I can get you posted to a conflict zone, make some new friends on the front line.”
Peter launched himself high up into the air, grabbing at a branch, he swung on the old oak tree, it barely creaked under his light wait. Natasha rolled out of the way, quickly standing at the ready as Peter turned, she boot kicked the side of Peter’s chest, sending him flying back into the tree’s trunk. Peter’s back flexed around the curve of the tree, he cried out in pain as he fell to the ground, splinters rained down on his head. The dirt hugged his face once again. Natasha stood unimpressed nearby. “I
“I think I look like Dad the most in this one!” Peter held the polaroid up to the light, angling it to get a better look at the finer details of the photo. “Dad, what are you wearing?” Tony took the photo, “Your Pop’s painting hoodie, we forgot to pay our heating bill and I literally only owned like seven clean t-shirts. We were miserable in the cold but we wore those hoodies for 3 days solid.” His parents both laughed at the memory.
Peter jumped into the back of the SUV with Tony, whose conversation had moved on to Howard. “He’s not at the compound, is he?” Tony asked politely but with a hit of desperation leaking through. “No, of course not Tony, Howard hasn’t left his office in decades, as if he’s going to actually appear at a local Shield office today. I wouldn’t put you through that.” Peggy honesty allowed Tony to relax and smile a bit, “We just need to confirm some details about Peter and where you are living, then you are free to go home and study, I hope.” She gave a parental look to the two boys across from her. Peter just politely nodded whereas Tony snorted, under his breathe he laughed.
“So,” Clint lead the way through the door and across the hanger catwalk, “ what did they offer you? I got the offer of a ‘family life’ you know, office nine to five, I just laughed. You?” Steve hesitated slightly, obviously a spy would notice. “Memory wipe. So I could forget Howard and Tony. Restart my time in the 90’s…” Clint even stopped. He turned round on the spot. “Wow… thats a lot …” Steve stood tall, he let out a shaky breath. “I said no but it wasn’t easy.”
Steve gently slid Tony off of him and gave one last pat on the back before heading out to grab his meal and head to his room. Demolishing the meal quickly Steve sat with his back leaning against the headboard and legs stretched out straight, leaving the bowl of food on his bedside table. Sliding down under the blanket, Steve let sleep take him, knowing tomorrow, he was going to have to chat to Tony for the first time in almost 6 months and report back to Shield on this Peter kid. He felt a bit shady for doing it but the kid was strange that was for sure, but it bought him time back with Tony so he didn’t really mind.
Tony gave an uninterest shrug. “I don’t give a fuck about seeing Howard, yeah, I’d like to see my mom, make sure she’s ok but I really want you to meet Jarvis and if you’ll let me, tell him who you are?” Tony’s confidence gradually left his body, he seemed nervous to ask Peter to come home with him. “Really?!” Peter grinned ear to ear, his Dad always spoke well of one Edwin Jarvis and his wife, he always said that they practically raised him, apparently, he’d passed away when Peter was younger, well taken care of by the Maria Stark Foundation in his later life, his parents visited him twice a week, Peter was too young to really remember.
Maria broke the silence, “I’m going to go make sure Howard and I are packed, we will leave in an hour or so.” Maria promptly left the room. As soon as they heard the door upstairs shut, signalling that Maria was away, Jarvis and Ana bolted to their room as Tony stepped out, the pair surrounded Tony in a hug. Peter steeped out just behind them, Tony seemed to be avoiding Peter’s eyes, maybe in shame, Peter thought to himself as he titled his head in confusion, it was difficult to see his Dad in distress, he always shut down. Ana and Jarvis lead Tony through to the front room where the piano stood, the gently set him down on the couch, laying him down, Peter grabbed a throw from the other couch and threw it over Tony’s shoulders. Peter had spotted the Santa hat from the night before, he decided to gently place it on top of Tony’s head. Ana patted Peter’s shoulders and guided him out the room.
The glove, however, didn’t really match the man Steve saw through the portal’s crack. The other man in Tony’s lab seemed well dressed, didn’t have a need for a fingerless glove, he didn’t see the man as the one to ride motorbikes or any heavy lifting at all, not that Steve was judging… just didn’t seem like Tony to be someone like the other man. Peter didn’t even really look like the man either, Peter’s hair that was currently flopping out from under Steve’s chin was much lighter than Tony’s hair and that man’s hair was much darker. It couldn’t be him could it? Steve ran a check list through his head, Peter had brown eyes same as Tony, his hair was light brown, not Tony’s and definitely not the man’s, his strength, not natural so not Tony’s but maybe the other man? The kid was shorter than average, same as Tony, the kids smile, not Tony’s.
Maria looked past Tony towards Peter, she looked at him, letting out a breath of a little gasp before smiling at him, she nodded her head and made her way out to the car. Tony and Howard reacted at the same time, side eyeing each other before pulling each other into a tense hug. “Love you Dad, see you Monday.” It was quick and painful to say but Tony felt better for it. Howard nodded at Tony politely, “You too son. I mean, yes, I love you too.” Howard turned around to walk out the door, nodding one more time to Tony and Peter. The pair looked between each other, Peter let out a quiet whistle, and walked with Tony to stand outside to wave them off.
Tony nodded, “Since you are finished, you missed a call from Shield. You’ve to make your way to the complex in New York? I don’t want to know how I found you in the ‘3rd best’ Strip club but get dressed. I’ll make coffee.” Rhodey helped Tony off the floor, placing him on the bed. Tony played with the loose thread protruding from the sheets. “Did they say why?” Rhodey shrugged, “Just said it was time and that you should be there?” Tony’s eyes popped open. Peter was going home!
“BullSHIT !? He’s got a massive bald spot! Jeez 28 I thought he was like 40!?” Tony let out a bellowing laugh, gripping the sides of his hips,  “I know right, Howard’s favourite junior business partner, looks out for me and keeps Howard away from this place,” He gestured around the flat “My place to hid from Stark Industries. Thanks to Steve mostly, but Stane as well. So …breakfast?” Peter nodded enthusiastically! He wrapped his arms around the ends of his blanket and walked towards the kitchen.
her face, Tony shared the pain of a broken relationship.
Tony tapped Peter on the shoulder, Peter understood, and made the journey round the back route towards the East staircase, dropping Tony down by his upper arm. Dropping down after him. Tony was heading up the stairs, hands in his jeans. “Come on, we don’t need them for Christmas, grab a game, I’ll get the Santa hats.” Tony was around the corner before Peter could respond. Peter jogged upstairs to his room, the modern room was decked out in rich cream furniture and fabrics, making his way into the walk in closest, grabbing three of the board games, turning around and making his way to the main hall way, which was shining in the sunlight.
Steve let out a tense sigh, Peter could almost hear the disappointed tone of his Pops coming through from the sigh. “First off Howard, Tony is one of my best friends since I came out the Ice, he isn’t a chore or someone I feel obligated to hang out with. I …like his company,” Peggy didn’t move but looked up quickly to the vent where Tony and Peter were hiding, it was like she was his great Aunt Peggy giving him the sly and funny eyeroll whenever his dads did something sappy.
Peggy hummed thoughtfully, “Sorry Peter but we don’t have a sure way of getting you home, but we are testing some theories at the moment, for now stay with Tony and keep out of trouble. Alright?” Peter nodded with a dejected sigh. He didn’t have much time to dwell on it when he heard his Pop’s voice coming down the hall.
He quickly made his way into Tony’s room, finding a white t-shirt, joggers and some fresh socks. He turned and ran down the stairs, by the time he’d reached the bottom, Howard was gone. He shoulder turned round the corner into the kitchen, Tony was still staring in the distance, Maria petting his hair down as Jarvis tweezed the last piece of glass out. Ana handed him the needle, Tony didn’t even flinch, but Peter had to look away. Maria took the clothes out of his hands, they had cut Tony’s t-shirt earlier, So Maria and Ana helped each other to pull the new white t-shirt over his head and carefully through his arm. Ana carefully handed Tony, the joggers and socks. She guided him towards her room and shut the door behind him. All of them in the kitchen stood quietly, Peter sat down in a chair in the corner, playing with the edge of his jacket.
“Morning, Peter, moving truck is coming in an hour, or at least that’s what Karen keeps saying from your wrist bands.” Tony stood up once the boxes were in place by the door. “I can confirm that Peter.” Karen chimed in from the wristband sitting on the coffee table. Peter took in the 30 or so boxes now stacked up around the front door, Tony had been super busy during the night packing up the rest of his room. Peter jumped up and rubbed his eyes, “How long have you been up? Is there anything I can help with?”
“Peter, god kiddo, your Pops and I were worried sick! Right quickly while this holds, I need to test its stability.” Tony from the future quickly looked frantically round the room for something to send when Uncle Bruce came sliding into frame of the crack’s window to home, “Here, send these! Hello Peter, I need you to step back!”
Howard began to slowly walk around Steve, taking in the face of pure rage before him, “Why are you even mad! It’s true, you think you need to come in here and ‘save’ him! He’s useless Ste! Can’t even face me like a man should, like a Stark should.” Howard stopped beside Steve who was staring at an art deco print on the wall to calm his nerves before he did something he really shouldn’t.
The silence was deafening.
“They’re back…?” Peggy took it from Steve’s hand. Steve solemnly nodded. Peggy swallowed her fear, looking to Barton, “Who were they after?” Barton gestured to Tony. “Steve took the bullet, but it was close.” Tony looked between Steve and his Aunt Peggy, worried about the situation between the two. Peggy stared for a minute into the distance and at the scene in front of her, Tony’s lost look as the ambulance lights flashed red and blue on the immediate area. Peggy sighed, “Peter, Tony. Go to the flat, pack a bag of clothes, personal artefacts and supplies. You are staying in a safe house for the immediate future.”
“Ma’am, Pierce has given out a kill order on the boy, apparently he has agents loyal to his deep devision unit. We can’t call them off, they’ve gone dark.” Peggy stood speechless, her mouth tried to form words, apologies, an order or just something to help. Steve stood back, nodding at the pair, “I’ll beat them to him, Phil can you prepare me any data you have on Peter. They won’t be dark for long.” And just like that Steve leapt over the edge of the railing, dropping down seven floors before landing in the knee bent superhero pose but jumping up to his feet and jogging off towards the hanger. The tiled stone floor, splintered and fractured from the point of impact.
It's been a long time now, at least a year since he last took the trip with his Pops. He missed his family. Making his way up the couple of stairs to the front door. Twisting the handle he pushed the door open slowly and stepped inside. He dropped the heavy bag off his shoulders and down onto the floor by the door. Peter rubbed his shoulder as he made his way through the cabin to check on each of the rooms. The kitchen thankfully fully stocked with rations since the two person team made the trek at the start of each month. Peter’s room was empty beside one bed a far cry from his poster filled room in the 21st century.
Steve had a permeant scowl on his face since he entered the makeshift situation room. This made no sense, the kid appeared through this? Why did Shield bother to bring him back to speak to the kid if they knew this existed?  And his thought ran wild with mentions of time, was this kid from the future or the past like he was? “How would you like to proceed Director?” Before Peggy could answer, Tony cut off the scientist, “We only do what Peter wants, if it’s dangerous or he doesn’t want to be here then that is the end of that.” Tony tone was powerful and protective. Peter’s muscles relaxed knowing he had at least one person on his side about all this.
Tony was the image of a young man in his father’s clothes. It it was her own fault, she could have been here for him, she could have taken some time to check in on him rather than chasing after Peter and Steve. God she’d fucked up. “He’s…” She could do this, tell the truth, “I’ve been keeping his busy… I’m sorry Anthony, he wasn’t ignoring you, i’ve kept him in the dark about most of this. He. He produced the best results for Shield without you in the picture to…distract him.” Tony’s face dropped, his mouth slightly open is shock, his eyes wide, raw emotions that he couldn’t quite understand yet. “I was a part of that Anthony. And I truly am so sorry that I hurt you with that decision, I kept him away from you and that hasn’t been good for either of you to be perfectly honest. I’m sorry it took me this long to realise this.”
“Bit Busy right now with Peter but call back never. All mail is forward addressed to Steve Rogers in the middle of the Atlantic ocean. Captain Rogers is currently fucking off somewhere right now but I’ll be sure to let him collect his shit from the museum after I drop it off!” Tony gasped for air after yelling for so long.
“Why break in, I thought you and the butler were good pals?” Clint focused on driving towards the city, keeping his head down to avoid any suspicion. “Jarvis, probably wouldn’t want to see the fella that failed to save the closest thing he had to a son. Even then Jarvis is an old man, if we get in and out quietly then its less stressful for all of us.” Clint nodded, agreeing with the logic. Steve leaned his head against the cool glass window. Wrapped in the flannel blanket, he let himself sleep for just a little while.
Tony, flabbergasted, jumped out the bed, getting his feet caught up in the sheets, he fell to the floor, face first on to the cream carpet, he groaned in pain and the bruising of his ego. He rolled over on the rug, looking directly up to Rhodey standing over him. “We weren’t like that!?” Tony rolled over again, pushing himself off the floor. “We’re just friends! Best friends! He’s not ! I mean I’m not like that Rhodey. Just… his sheets were clean and I … he just yeah. I couldn’t sleep and his room was warm and-“ Rhodey slapped his hand over Tony’s mouth. Raising his eyebrow. “You done?”
s away one day and you can’t even manage to eat and clip a couple of items to your clothes, that you designed.” Tony let out a sarcastic ‘Ha’. Where as Clint gave a low chuckle, “Sam, you may be newish here but what you need to understand is that
Tony sat down on the edge of the bed, taking in a deep breath to releases the unknown tension off of his shoulders. He began to fiddle with his wedding ring between his finger and thumb, He gave a soft smile to the wall above his desk, while dust floated in the air like fireflies in the night, disturbed when Tony sat down. Peter loved his photography, when Steve brought out his old camera from his war bike, they had thought it would have been a complete wreck, a trinket that was far from salvageable
and Peter returned it with a casual effort. Tony turned back to Steve and held out his hand to shake, “Hi, I’m Tony Rogers. You’ve been taking care of my son, so thanks.”
“Sweet, uh when is that, I’ll need to get it off work just to be sure!” Peter started to pull out vegetables to make his soup with. Tony called out, while he was walking down the hall to get ready for his date, “We will head over for the 14
Steve wrapped his arms around Peter’s shoulder and chest, pulling him into his own. Peter couldn’t look up at his pop’s, he just stared down at the suit, arms by his side, the few possessions he had collected on his travels here. A few hoodies, a pair of boots, some bus tickets, a few hundred dollars and a collection of photos from Tony’s room of his parents. Peter finally looked up to his Pops, who was squeezing him tighter in a hug. “I … you .” He leaned down to press a quick kiss into Peter’s head. “I’m sorry that it's been like this. For you. Let’s get you home fresh clothes and a bath.” Steve sighed. “I’m so proud of you,” Peter laughed at his Pops. He leant forward and picked up the collection of photos. “I’m not going to lie, it’s really threw me when I got here that you and dad were just friends. It's so weird.” Steve laughed inspecting the photos of himself and a very young Tony over Peter’s shoulder. “Yeah? Believe it or not I was my own person before I met your dad. Him and I we were really oblivious around each other for a long time.”
Edwin Jarvis, his, practically in every way but blood, Grandfather. When Jarvis noticed Peter at the bottom of the stairs, he coughed and proceeding to smooth out his waistcoat to make himself presentable for Peter. Peter couldn’t help the childish wonder that showed on his face. “Edwin Jarvis, personal butler to the Stark Family. At your service for any of your needs.” He gave a slight nod with a serious face.
As the car stopped on the kerb side, Steve opened the door for both Peter and Tony. He received a salute from the driver, which he returned in the correct fashion. Tony rolled his eyes and slapped Steve’s shoulder, “Come on solider, DUM_EE’s gonna freak out that you are home!” Peter lead the way up the stairs, with Tony and Steve’s chattering followed closely behind. Tony reached down his shirt to grab the door key, pulling it out he moved to unlock the door, he continued his previous thought with Steve, “As I was saying Rhodey was totally smitten by the female pilot, I think she was air force, but Steve he tripped over the back of the couch, like who does that!”
“I don’t know, it’s been sparking like this for at least 2 minutes, I threw a wrench at it and it did nothing!” Peter took a step back away from the workbench as the purple sparks became more violent, it had left scorch marks on the work bench.  Peter kept his head down and hid behind the cars and workbenches that lead him towards his parents. Steve had the shield braced between himself and the gauntlet, while Tony stood behind with his arm pointing towards the gauntlet. Peter looked between his parents and the gauntlet, a couple of steps and he’d be with them. Steve was retreating with Tony behind him firing his repulsors at the gauntlet.
The black digital clock bounce on top of the table, bumping into the sketchbook, Tony kicked his foot out to slam it on top of the alarm, silencing it. reaching round he pulled the sketch book on to his chest, re-organising his hands he held the sketch book above his head. Picking up where he left off, Tony flicked to the next page, a hastily sketched portrait of a man, the only clue give as to who he was, was the ‘Barnes.” patch on his front shirt. Likely a buddy from the war. A time long forgotten by many but not for the man who only left it behind a couple of years ago. Flipping the page over, Tony was gently hit on the face by a wrapped, specifically, the local vendor that stood outside their apartment every day, Tony pulled the white paper wrapper off his face, inspecting it again, the slightly smudge doodle of himself, his hair flopped over his eyes, taking a oversized bite of the the fully load hotdog, grinning ear to ear the corners of his mouth cover in mustard and relish.
“Peter?! Bruce what’s happening?” Tony turned to the holographic screen next to him, “Shit its closing!” Tony turned to face Peggy and Peter, “Carter, you better take care of my kid till I can get him home! Peter, we are coming for you!” Peggy nodded curtly to Tony with her arms wrapped around Peter’s upper body.
Peter stopped pacing, his 100 watt smile turned towards his Pop’s voice, “Yeah Pops?”
Natasha rolled quickly as Clint fired his stun arrow, caught off guard, Natasha stuck him with one her stun sticks as he dodged the arrow. The soldier fell to the ground unconscious. Clint ran forward kicking his gun away from the assassin, as Natasha searched his body for weapons. Both Steves’ dropped to their knees. Peter’s father fell forward on to his hands, gasping for air, while his younger self just stared at his old friend or what was left of him. His oldest childhood friend, who was killed in combat, off the side of a train. Over a cliff’s edge. Impossible to survive. What was happening to his life?
“Right. Safe flight.”
It was then Peter realised that the arm of the shooter, was made entirely of metal. Right up to the shoulder bone. The shooter crushed the tracker between his fingers. He swung a punch across his chest towards Peter. Peter used his speed to continually dodge the fists. This infuriated the shooter as his face morphed into one of rage. Peter leaped over the shooter to gain some distance between them, but the shooter was quick and grabbed his ankle, lifting him and smashing him back into the ground.
“Yeah, I know Uncle Rhodey.” Peter frozen for a second, Tony pulled his head out of the cupboard, with a beaming grin, “Good to know I got Rhodey to stick around for a while!”
This Was Bad.
Steve looked past Tony to notice his old war tin on the bed side table, half wrapped in one of Tony’s t-shirts. Steve gave a soft smile, he knew Tony wouldn’t donate his stuff, but he was glad to see Tony knew how much it meant to him. Peter had a soft smile on his face watching his dads interact, he could see his parents in their younger selves. Pops would always make sure his Dad would sleep at reasonable times, even if he was sleeping on top of Pops.
“This just appeared in our office, It appeared at 10:12am and has continued to grow to the size it is now. We have no control over it, but it is showing signs of some sort of time dilation, the office clock,” The scientist gestured to a digital black clock that was sat on a desk near the anomaly, it jumped between two times, back and forth between 14:43 and 15:09, “possibly the time on the inside or start of the anomaly.” The scientist reported to the Director and the general audience around her.
“Don’t.” Steve said harshly. A black shield SUV skidded and stopped short of the group, Director Carter stepped out the back and promptly made her way towards the group. Her security close behind her. “Situation Report now Captain.” Peggy was not happy. Her godson was almost shot, and she wanted answers. “Director Carter…” Steve took the patch out of Peter’s hand and showed it to Peggy. Peggy’s hand trembled as she took the patch.
“Tony, come on, bed time it’s three am.” Rhodey was already standing in the hallway towards the bedrooms. “I’ll stay in Peter’s room, come one you need your bed.” Rhodey walked back and took Tony’s arm and pulled him along the hallway into Tony’s room. Tony stood as Rhodey pulled the covers off his bed and gestured for Tony to climb in. He pulled off his shoes and waist coat, pulling off and folding his trousers, the shirt sat well below his hips but he kept it on. Rhodey looked away as Tony climbed in his bed, but once Tony settled in bed, Rhodey quickly jogged over and gave Tony a tight hug. “I don’t know what has been happening but don’t shut me out again buddy. I’m here for you.” Tony nodded into Rhodey’s shoulder. “Thanks Honey-bear.” Rhodey got up to leave, before he turned off the light he turned back to Tony, “Oh and T. Don’t ever call me James again. It’s weird coming from you.” The pair chuckled together. Tony rolled over and Rhodey turned off the lights.
He looked up to Tony, who was admiring the view from Peggy’s office. “Must I remind you Captain that this meeting has Level 10 clearance and also not to keep Director Stark waiting.” Steve face turned to stone, “Sorry Ma’am.” He turned and walked down the hallway, waiting on the elevator.
Checking over his shoulder one last time he held down the button and gently called out. “Shell-head to Wing-head, you there big guy?” Tony rested the device against his lips as his elbow leaned on the arm rest, he waited a minute or so, taking in the view out the aircraft window.
“I’m still angry at him. Aren’t you a bit much for bringing a teenage back to my house?” Tony dropped the glass back down onto the cabinet counter. He turned on the spot to reach for more drink. Natasha stood quickly, quietly making her way up and behind Tony. Reaching around his body, she wrapped her hand around the clear glass neck, ripping it from his grip. She quickly wrapped her hand around his other arm, that had tried to reach out for the bottle. “You have a problem.” Unimpressed by his attitude, she threw the bottle on to the couch across the room. Tony glared back at her. “Where is your kid? Huh? Are you that much of an asshole?”
He flipped the page again, Tony let out a laugh but quickly covered his mouth. A quick, rough sketch of their ratty yellow couch and all of his paper work, dumped onto the couch. He chuckled again, running his fingers over the page. Tony flicked over the page again, half finished, a family photo of Steve and Sarah, Steve dressed in his Sunday best, perched on Sarah’s hips, her dress unfinished. The official photo tapped to the opposite page, next to a photo of Tony and Steve moving the couch into the apartment, well, Steve carried the couch and Tony directed from in front. Tony placed the book back down in its place. He looked towards the door and decides against leaving, pulling out Steve’s military made bed sheets and wrapping himself up in the bed. Determined in the morning to find Steve Rogers again.
--------
Hello Lovelies! Thank you so much for all the support!
Finally, after all this time, it worked! He wanted to jump for joy! But he stopped.
Natasha harrumphed. “Fine.” She chucked the file report on the Winter Solider in Steve’s lap. “Read this.” She was left to her own thoughts for the rest of the journey. Peter was Stark’s kid. But he was also Steve’s. It was so fucking obvious now. The kid got flustered every time Steve was around. The file literally opened up on the screen, when she was at the office (that she broke into...) of Peter basic information that they knew.
Peggy looked up from a report in her hands, gently putting it down on her desk, removing her glasses from her nose. “Captain Rogers, Agent Barton and … Consultant on loan, Miss Romanoff. So, what do I owe the pleasure?” Steve held out his hand to Romanoff who opened the tube, pulling out a large sheet of blueprints. Handing them to Steve, who slammed them down onto the desk. Rolling them on. Peggy didn’t even jump when Steve slammed the print down.
The suit,
“Yeah, pretty much but mine is a secret. Cause you know I’m 17 and your son so it’s just asking for people to come hurt us. You don’t always like it, but I help the average people where as Captain America saves the world, you know?” Peter rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly, a worried look on his face.
Steve chuckled gently to himself, not letting his eyes linger any longer on the sight before him, because … there was nothing for him to see. Just friends, just classic Tony. Steve reached over to take Tony’s notes, tidying the sheets into a pile and setting them on his desk. He made his way to the bathroom to take a shower, deciding to save Tony from himself, Steve took an extra towel and threw it at Tony, who startled awake.
Steve dropped the bags at the edge of the clearings parking bay. Dropping them roughly in the ground before making his way back, to sit next to Peter. Steve landed a bit roughly on the step, bringing his feet up a step to rest his elbows on his thighs, he took a look around the clearing. “hey, Pops?” Steve turned to look at Peter, a smile graced his face, “Yeah bud?” Peter leaned over, resting his head on his father’s shoulder.
“God damn it T, where are you now?” Rhodey asked himself heading back out the flat. Peter dropped from the ceiling on to the floor into a crouched position.  Peter inspected the room and it was covered in blueprints and schematics for various robots and designs. Barely an inch of free space existed on any of the walls. Peter studied each of his dad’s designs, some of them he recognized as old Stark tech that had been further developed, including the Stark Phone designs. Peter decided it was best to try and find himself a clean glass and drink some water, so leaving the room untouched Peter wandered out into the hallway. As he did the door rattled once more, Peter frozen in his place. Tony walked through the door. Peter just stood there as Tony pulled through some bags from the local CVS store and shutting the door behind him, Tony looked about until he saw Peter and smiled, “Hey come on, I’m guessing your hungry time traveler, let’s compare notes shall we?”
But it had been at least two months since Rhodey had last seen Tony or Steve for that matter but it was good to know Tony was at least alive and causing trouble again. Rhodey took the two sides of his jacket and pulled it tight across his body. It was still spring in North America, it was freezing.
Spider-bro crawled along the floor until he reached the end of the hall way. The robot crawled up the side wall, settling quietly in the upper corner of the room, pointing to the kitchen. Peter nodded to himself, happy with the position of the drone. Peter turned on his heals towards the holo-board project out from the mask. “Peter, I managed to connect to Stark Industries Servers when the anomaly was open. I downloaded the footage of your journey here and analysed it. I also downloaded a video from the family’s private file server labelled, ‘In case Karen connects, Peter watch this immediately’. Shall I play it now?”
Steve had wandered into the Barnes family preparing a stew dinner in his apartment, Steve broke down crying in the hallway. Buck scrambling forward to catch him. Begging his friend to let it all out. Now his best friend was still alive, after all this time, just in time for him to come to terms with the fact that he’d lost his best… who was he kidding now, he could say anything he wanted to about Tony, his crush
After four hours Maria Stark held well to her name, owning over 35% of the property in the board. Her son close 2
Steve followed closely, “I was thinking that as well Tony, I can’t figure out why, but Barton will. He’s good.” the hall lead to two bedrooms, they used to be Steve’s parents’ room and his bedroom which Peter had taken up. So that just left the one, but Steve was prepared to offer himself for sleeping on the couch but he … had to try for some alone time with Tony so he pulled a plan he’d used from the old flat. “So, there’s only one room, you comfortable with it like it was when the heating broke?” Steve was a bit nervous about this, they’d shared a sleeping space a couple of times previously. Before he left.
“Rhodey-bear get lost, Peter pack a bag!” Peter nodded, he dusted himself down slightly, he held out his hand to shake Robert’s, “I’m Peter … Peter Parker…” Robert raised a single eyebrow at Peter, what a…polite young boy, Robert was impressed. He took the young boy’s hand and shook it, “Robert Hanson. Personal driver for the Stark family for the last 23 years. I’ll be taking you and Master Stark to the Stark Mansion for Christmas break.” Peter smiled and nodded, “I’ll go get packed quickly.” Robert smiled back and proceed to clear the floor of pizza boxes. Peter felt slightly guilty for the old man cleaning up his mess, so he moves quickly to get packed.
It took the pair a couple of hours until they could get themselves alone. The campsite had to be swept for any listening devices before Clint felt even remotely safe to open the package. He sat in their make shift tent for an hour, before he was confident enough to tell Steve the news. He had to triple check his work, the news was shocking, the instructions were unclear however. Steve paced outside the tent, his boots caked in mud, the red barely visible. He had to distracted himself, he inspects himself in the portable mirror. A shave was in order. He took the blade in his hand, holding his head to one side, he carefully ran it over the side of his head, army short. Uneven and rough but it would do. He gave himself a little more time on the other side. It wasn’t much better. Scissors roughly cut at the top portion.
quickly picked up pace with Peter towards Tony, as the family collided into one large hug. “Dad!? Dad it’s you, it’s really you?!” Peter cried out hysterically in his Dad’s arms, Tony wrapped his arms firmed round the back of peter’s head and shoulders, pulling him into his chest.
Ana just stood with two raised eyebrows and a hand on her hip, “Well aren’t you just surprising, don’t hurt yourself Édesem,I’d feel guilty if you did!” Peter gently put the bag down between them, smoothing out his apron and jumper, she bumped hips playfully with him. The worked quite happily exchange details about their week. “And do you enjoy staying here?” Peter gestured with his potatoes peeler to the house around him, “It is very kind for the Stark’s to let us stay in the house, but I feel Maria just wants someone to be in the house with Tony until… well, she knows who raised Tony so I guess she wanted his family here.”
Steve made his way inside the main entrance, his hoodie and combat trousers adding to his disguise. “Young man, be aware the museum is closing in twenty minutes.” Steve politely nodded in response. Quickly making his way through the back heading under the banner of the Captain American display. Entering the hall Steve slowed down to a crawling walk. The large hanging banner, lit with gentle spot lights, displayed one of the rare group photo of the Howling Commandos. Steve stood to the left side of the photo, arms wrapped around Hogan and Bucky. Steve bowed his head as he passed under the banner. Making his way through the introduction of each member, he stop abruptly when he spotted his display, his mother’s cookbook front and centre. Kids and parents surrounded the display, commenting on his childhood toys, books and sketches. It sent a chill down his spine.
confession. A therapist, someone to talk through his problems with? That sounded …scary. To tell the truth, about everything he saw during the war, his deep reliance on his only friend, an unrequited love.
Peter leaned back against the wall, a soft smile on his face. He looked up to his holo-board, running through the footage of his disappearance from the future. The simulations working through each angle of the security footage of the workshop. “Try to take the data more focused on the compound that hit me.”
Peter looked up to his Uncle, giving a false smile. “Yep.” Thor’s eyes glazed over, lost in the conversation of the future, “Peter, your Dad implores you to head back to the Stark estates, once you are there, I can come back and talk to young Tony. Use my negotiation skills to make sure he doesn’t hurt you again.” Peter sighed, pulling his legs up to his chest he slides his freshly sock covered toes under the coarse blankets and turned over on his shoulder, “He blames me Uncle Thor, I didn’t tell him about his parents’ deaths, it’s my fault!” The tears slowly fell from his eyes. Thor knelt beside his nephew’s bed for the night, he raised his hand, wishing he could smooth down Peter’s hair and care for his godson’s dire situation. “Oh nephew, I wish I could take you home tonight, you have suffered more than my enemies have during battle.” Peter gave a wet chuckle at his Uncle’s analogy. “Miss you too T-hammer.”
Peggy was touched by Peter’s story, it was nice to know that her godson turned out safe and well. That he achieves greatness even after Howard’s constant hatred of everything he does, no matter how much Tony tried to please him, Peggy knew that Howard was no longer the good man she knew during the war. Maria Stark was a woman who knew she had reached her place. A good scientist for Shield a few decades ago, there was no doubt that Tony was going to be genius, but she lost her passion after Howard decided to live the socialist life style.
Steve Rogers is a tall, blonde hair, blued eyed man and his son in comparison, is short, brunette and brown eyed. Not many people could see the family resemblance, and luckily for Peter, the paparazzi couldn’t really either but it was there in his upbringing, Steve instilled the value of standing up for himself and those he cared about, no matter his size. He truly would give anything right now for just one more movie night squished between his parents, his Pops size encasing his family together, he could cocoon himself in his parents arms, a comfortable warmth that he could only ever feel between his parents. He missed his dad fussing over his hair and the state clothes while his Pops would hop over couch to get more snacks.
“Come here Petey, please, it’s late and I want to be awake when I hear it all.” Tony held out his hand for Peter to take. Peter’s grin couldn’t get any bigger, nearly tripping on the oversized pj trousers as he scrambled forward on to the bed, crawling up and between his parents. Tony rolled to jump off the covers,
caught it, whispering, “It’s just me, you’re alright.” Peter frantically whipped his head round, “Pops.” He let out with a sigh, relaxing into his father’s side. “It’s ok Peter, we’re almost home,” gesturing out the window. Peter scrambled over to look out the window to the compound ahead, With a wistful look on his face Peter whispered, “Home.”
“Awesome! Glad he’s alright! Dad will be happy about that,” Peter reached over for some cereal that was in the middle of the white marble island counter, “So, what’s happening with that  gauntlet? Where are my dad’s anyway?”  Peter poured himself a bowl of cereal with milk and turned on the bar stool to face Peggy who had moved to tidy up on the other side of the kitchen. “The alien gauntlet has stopped releasing energy at the compound but the liquid your father describe is missing from the device. We assume it was used to create the electrical energy that was discharging in the lab. As for your fathers, they are taking a walk together around the ground after their … enthusiastic night together…” Peggy hesitated and rolled her eyes, clearly having been disturbed last night. Peter screwed up his face dramatically. “EW, GROSS, nope didn’t need to know that Aunt Peggy thanks for that, I was having breakfast, way to ruin it!” As if on cue Steve and Tony walked in the room. Tony in one of his many suits, this one was a deep navy colour with a black shirt on. Steve was sporting black trousers and a light blue shirt tucked in, with his signature sleeve rolled up to his elbows. Steve was stared at his son while he entered the large kitchen area. Caught off guard by the sheer similarity between his son and Tony in that moment, Steve felt like he was back in ’91 staring at a hungover Tony, the way the hoodie sat crooked on his son’s shoulders and the hair that travelled in every direction and that was long enough to create volume off Peter’s head. Steve had a large grin on his face, thinking back to when Peter was born, he and Tony always argued about whose features Peter would inherit most from, Steve had hoped it would have been Tony’s, and in that moment, Peter was Tony’s spitting image and Steve couldn’t have imagined he would have been any happier to win in an argument with Tony. Tony didn’t even see it. “Hey, watch your breakfast around that hoodie, I want that back free of any gross food drips from you, you hear me kid!” Tony wrapped his arm around Peter’s shoulders and squeezed a hug out of his son. Peter leaned into his Dad as Pops walked round to his other sided, reached for a red apple out of the fruit bowl and took a bite out of it. “Aunt Peggy was just telling me about your loud ass fun last night with Pops,” Peter looked up to his Dad’s face as Peggy stifled a laugh. Steve stopped mid-bite of his apple. Tony turned to meet Peter’s eyes, “Sorry, not sorry kiddo.”
hips slid round the other side of his desk, picking up his phone and sliding it into his suit pocket. Placing his hands on his hips, Tony focused on finishing the food. Clint finally pushed himself up and out of the chair, he got to work preparing the gauntlet for transportation. Sam’s heavy boots clucked their way down the stairs to the workshop, taking in the sight of Tony, half a sandwich stuck in his mouth, clipping the transportation devices on the collar of his shirt, frozen at the appearance of Sam. He sighed, “Should’ve guessed you Starks’ would go all out and treat this like a family adventure, come here, you’ve put it on upside down.”
Steve was determined in that moment that if he made it through those injuries alive, he was going to give every spare minute of time to his family. Peter could barely go the next month or so without seeing the image of his Pop’s convulsing on the table, Steve had asked his husband if they could go away as a family, to clear the air with their son. Tony’s bright idea, which involved him not going technology free for a week, was to let Steve take Peter alone, the first trip had been hard. Peter had barely made eye contact with his Pop’s the entire journey down to the cabin and had practically hid in his room until he couldn’t have his afternoon nap due the rumbling in his stomach. Peaking his head round the door into the hallway, Peter spotted his Pop’s reading in the rocking chair, curiosity got the better of him, grabbing his story book, Peter cautiously made his way down the hallway, bathing in the evening suns glow Steve sat in the wooden rocking chair.
The waiting was agony, every moment of just listening to static, hoping they hadn’t already gotten to her before they could warn them. Clint slammed his fist down on the truck bed, before he could even speak the radio crackled to life. - ALIVE - SENDING CO-ORDINATES - QUICK - YOU WANT TO BE HERE. - Clint scrambled through the small window for a note pad, carefully noting down the co-ordinates. Steve patiently waited as Clint attempted to find the location on a map.
Before Steve couldn’t even say anything, Peter quickly asked for help, “Please help me get him home, he’s letting me stay at the apartment, but I can’t even get him up and I just need help.” Steve was ready to protect Tony from this punk, but he’d quickly realised this kid was way too young to be here, he must have been like 16 and Tony brought him here!?
“Steve, Steve Rogers?” Peter asked short of breath, almost stuttering out his words. Tony furrowed his brow, Tony slightly leaned forward, sliding into the mirror position of Peter.
“Ok, thank you, Peter. That’s very kind of you.” Peter nodded and smiled, “Do you want a hand with the bed sheets, we just got here this morning so not much is ready. Also, do you need some painkillers?”
“kid…I sometimes wish… that I could wake up in 1945 but… I feel better here, I have friends and Tony, to care of me and I take care of them in return. I lost my Ma when I was younger than you and Pops died before I was even born. I don’t have a family like you do, I had Buck, who died during the war … I watched him fall. So, when it came time to make the play, I didn’t know where I was going to end up, but I knew… I know, that no one was going to be waiting for me to come back home. You stayed in the Roger family home last night, you think anyone was taking care of that place while I was on ice?” Steve leaned in the same position next to Peter, staring up at the same fly buzzing around the staircase light.
Steve left the warehouse, walking outside in the early hours of the morning there was a very cold breeze making its way inland. The Shield SUV pulled up next to Steve, the window at the front rolls down. “Hop in Captain,” Natasha says, “Shield just got intel about the ‘Winter Solider’, he’s just attacked a motor cade of Stark Industries file transports 6 miles outside of the city. 5 dead.” Steve opened the door and jumped in, chucking the shield over his shoulder and through the median. “Ow!” Barton cried out from the back seat, “Damn, that thing hurts when it wants too.” Natasha rolled her eyes at Barton’s moans of an injury, driving the car at high speed through the streets of New York city.
Peter cried out in surprised, grinning, he scrambled onto his feet, tripping on the edge of the rug to get to the door. Pulling it open towards him, in his excitement, he tore it off its hinges and allowed it to slam against the wall. It lay splintered on the floor, Sprinting down the stairs and across the open area, elated Peter collided with his Pops chest.
Peter gripped his nose in pain. She took a deep breath and let out the tension of her muscles. “Better, not great. You are certainly more impressive off of the ground but hand to hand is definitely not your style.” Peter let out a howl of pain, “Did you have to break my nose though?!” Natasha smiled again. “Lesson learned for today! Besides, it’ll heal in like twenty minutes.” Patting Peter on the shoulder she turned around and made her back towards the cabin, she gestured her hand as a come hither motion, “Come on, let’s get some ice for that nose.”
Find the radio, cut the lights, break the glass, get out. Simple, hopefully. Steve made his way through the crowd, gently pushing past people, keeping his head down. Finally reaching the technology display, browsing through the display, from Hogan’s ‘happy bombs’ and the blowin’ apart radio that made him and the rest of the 107th walk home for a day or two with the injured. Displayed on the glass shelves above the radio, was the transmitter with the broadcasting abilities over all channels. Perfect for contacting Natasha, where ever she maybe. Hopefully not far and still safe.
Tony sat up, Steve continued to stay laid back, his hand rubbing up and down Tony’s back as a comforting gesture. “You are Captain America, not Tony Stark’s nanny. It’s …selfish of me to want you here all the time, you are the one friend that has stuck around, even when I do something stupid. Which is often. So, don’t be mad if…” Steve’s hand froze. He sat up next to Tony, Staring him in the eye. “I could call aunt Peggy, you could be reassigned to investigate the shooter. Agent Coulson would take over here.”
“You gonna tell him? Since you won’t tell me?” Barton called out with a smirk. Steve immediately turned his head over his shoulder with narrow eyes. He turned his gaze back to Natasha with furrowed brows. “What is he talking about.” Natasha sighed. She kept her arms straight, gripping the steering wheel. She didn’t break under is watchful gaze. “I’m know for not following the rule.” Steve looked forward and pinched the bridge of his nose, “You took off the handcuffs, didn’t you?” Steve’s rhetorical question made Barton bite back a laugh. “For a good reason, I wanted to know more about Peter, so I climbed through the vents—” Barton cut her off with a quick quip, “Girl after my own heart!” Steve crossed his arms, he couldn’t wait to hear what trouble this pair got into.
“So, is Steve Rogers still a dick in your time?” Tony looked up at this point, Peter tried to read the meaning behind his dad’s question, were they still friends. Could he actually tell Tony that he and Steve end up married after that shouting match?! Would the actually still get married now he was here? He’d now been involved in that moment, before Peter arrived Tony might never have picked up the phone, he might have been at class with Rhodey if Tony hadn’t needed to go out to feed Peter. He might have fucked up his own existence in a single phone call.
Howard’s insinuation that he was interested wasn’t wrong, but it did just highlight to Steve how weird it was. He was 26 or in his 70’s and Tony is 21, young and care free. He didn’t want a solider from WW2, he was his friend and protector. He knew Peggy knew about his feelings, he never gets anything past her, but she knows how to manipulate him. Make him Tony’s protector, Tony’s bodyguard and nothing more. He couldn’t face it. Not now. Not with a mission ahead of him, there would always be another mission, he just had to get through this one. Then maybe he could take a day to himself. Maybe.
Peter woke up with his head hanging upside down off the bed. The sun was just peaking in to the room as Peter slowly slipped down off the side of the bed. As he stood up to take in his surroundings he realized that he’d been sleeping in his Dad’s old room when he was growing up. It still had poster, tapes and clothes sitting around. It was tidy but not by his Dad’s doing, definitely a cleaner or two has been through here. Peter switched out his hoodie for one of his Dad’s from the chair of recently clean laundry, it had one of his Dad’s favourite bands on it. He stared into the mirror in the corner of the room and ruffled his hair, he seriously need to get it cut. As his hair flopped in every direction above his head, Peter turned and wandered down the East hallway toward the kitchen. As he turned the corner into the kitchen Peter heard his Aunt Peggy.  “Anthony what are you doing up already?” Peter lifted his head up from the relaxed position to stare at his Aunt. “Sorry Peter, oh how you look so much like you father when he was your age.” Peter walked up to his Aunt and gave her a great big hug, “Good morning, Aunt Peggy! Yeah, yeah, I know I need a haircut.” Peter moved to sit down next to her at the breakfast table. “How are you, I’m guessing my dad’s told you what happened last night at home?” Peggy nodded at her godson. “Hmm. Yes and I’m glad you and your father are safe but you’ll be glad to know that ‘Dum-Ee’ is absolutely fine.” Peter let out a breath that he didn’t know he had been holding.
“Peter, I sense weakness in your muscles, you need to be home and training with your father, as soon as possible, I suggest burning energy through running in this time or I can try and stay a little longer to help in your training youngling!” He took in Peter’s general appearance and cross his arms over his broad chest, “As for your father, he is, as you would say? In rescue mode to get you home, he’s keeping your dad well feed and forcing him to rest to keep him working at his strongest. He tried to keep to himself, away from the family but Natasha kicked some sense into him that you were alive and safe!... We will all be pleased to see you back at home soon.”
Steve crossed his arms in thought. “Very specific target then, so is he usually faster at this plan and attack method? Why is he always spotted before not after?” The trio walked toward a cafeteria table with 6 cheap blue chairs, Steve sat first, Romanoff second with her coffee and Barton third, pulling out another burger that was wrapped from his pocket. “He’s spotted usually due to high police presence at the assassination or after the fact when assessing photos in the newspapers… but it’s like a title passed down generation, same uniform, same physical loss of an arm. It’s very strange for this not to show up in family traits or unit showing weakness, or a lack of participation if it was the same man, he’d be well over 80 years old.”
Steve Rogers was marching his way through the dance floor crowd towards him and Tony. Oh Shit. Peter could tell he was still in his classic uniform, but it was hidden a large zip grey Shield hoodie. He had his ‘Captain America, don’t mess with me face on’ as the crowd parted, giving him dirty looks as he walked through. Peter couldn’t make a mistake here, he had to get his Pop’s to help him with Tony.
Peter had been through some low moments in the last couple of weeks. He had convinced himself once, in a dream that he had made it home, the crushing disappointment when he woke up in the apartment bed was tough. Peter would go running at night, when he couldn’t sleep. He’d almost been mugged twice, the first time he just defends himself easily and left them alone, the second time Peter had felt … less generous. He didn’t hold back the strength of the punches. He’s pretty sure two of the muggers are still in hospital, if the sound of a cracking nose was anything to go by. He destroyed at least five punching bags at the campus gym and began lifting ridiculous weights, he didn’t care too much if people noticed. He was home sick, he needed guidance and family photos weren’t quite enough to keep him going anymore.
He inspected his work in the mirror. It would have to do for now. He couldn’t handle the longer strands blinding his view as he ran. Clint poked his arm out the tent, his hand in a come-hither motion. Steve marched over, bending his head to get into the grey cloth tent. “What the fuck did you do to your head?” Steve glared back at Clint. “Dude let me even out the sides at least. I could’ve done a pretty decent job!” Steve chuckled a little, he quickly stopped himself. He sat in the stool across from Clint. “What did Natasha say?” Clint shrugged his shoulders, shaking his head back and forward a little. “I have instruction and still have to translate the last couple of lines.” He reached under his stool, holding out a white cardboard box to Steve, “Step one- get Steve to open the box.”
Thanks for the feedback! Enjoy!
“I’m glad you know about me being here Aunt Peggy, but I want to go home, to my parents as soon as possible, I’ll do anything to help but I won’t tell you anything about the future.” Peggy was watching the pair closely, she turned and whispered to him, “You may look like Tony, but your determination is all Steve.”
Steve opened his eyes to the sight of Clint tapping on the glass window. Steve opened the door and took the carrier bag from Clint and hopped out of the car. pulling the rest of the suit off of his shoulders, he took out the plan white t-shirt and pulled it over his head. Clint turned away and whistle a gentle tune as Steve changed into the jeans and pulled a pair of boots on. Slipping his wallet into his back pocket and pulling on a navy basic jacket he tapped Clint’s shoulder to signal he was ready. Clint locked the truck and the pair made their way back to the Rogers’ residence. They snuck in the back door and jogged up the inside fire escape staircase. Steve pressed his ear against the front door. Happy that the apartment was empty, he pulled out his key and headed inside.
temporary desk, that had been set up so that he could help Tony with his work, a great support once they’d found out what had happened to Peter, while
Tony showed Peter around campus all morning, pointing out good places to hang out, the science labs, the architecture of the historic buildings. It was a very tiring morning for Peter, as they rounded the corner near the students café, some of Tony’s friend spotted him and called him over, Peter stayed on the corner on the other side of the road just watching the world go by as Tony spoke to his friends. Peter was caught off guard when a strong guy bumped into him, Peter has to usually fake his strength and be moved by the bump because of the super strength ability, he is basically able to keep himself in one spot. But this was different this guy wasn’t built like a football player but he certainly could move him just enough for Peter to notice the shear force as well as the other guy. The stranger threw a look over his shoulder. Sporting a glare that was almost covered by his shoulder length hair hidden under his hoodie. Peter watched as the man quickly man his way to the end of the street at a brutal pace. Peter was broke out of his stares with Tony’s hand on his shoulders. “Lunch Time?”
“Peter can you grab the phone for me? I don’t know just say you’re a friend or something and if Rhodey asks then just say I know you from home, wait you do know Rhodey right?” It was slightly muffled by the cupboard but Peter’s super solider hearing didn’t struggle.
“Someone… tried to shoot me today.” Steve’s fingers tightened their grip. “But you stepped in the way Steve… Why?” Tony didn’t even move, Steve stared at the same point, the small patch of damp from the flat above.
“Director Carter. Mr Stark. Didn’t think you would be joining us after your fall out with Captain America.” Fury titled his head, sarcasm might as well have been tattoo on his forehead. “Fury! Good to see you again! Acting super shady as always.” Tony pushed past him to walk down the ramp, Peggy followed closely, whispering between herself and Fury. Tony rolled his eyes, leading the way towards the compound. The security guard eyed him up and down, eyes wide in surprise, “You’re, you’re Tony Stark!?” He smiled in return, taking the man’s hand quickly to shake it, “and you are…” Tony leaned in to read the man’s name badge, “Stewart! Good to meet you Stewart, keep up the good work, keeping everyone in line.” Tony threw a look over his shoulder towards Fury, who raised his eyebrow in response. “Yes Mr Stark! Of course Mr Stark!”
“I’m going to distract Howard, I’d suggest using your gifts… to even just hide. I can give you a minute or two at most.” Peggy whispered, making her way to the door. Peter didn’t want to find out what the infamous Howard Stark was really like. He quickly walked to Tony, wrapping his arm around his waist, “Hold on!” Tony wrapped his arm around Peter as he jumped to the ceiling and lifted Tony into the air vent, and crawled in after him, with not a second to spare the double doors flew open, Tony and Peter watching through the air vent.
