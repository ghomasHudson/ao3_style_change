Perhaps that was what Sherlock wanted as well. They had reached what appeared to be an ultimatum; either Sherlock died, or everyone he knew did instead.
"I never thought I'd see you lose your cool like this. It's quite interesting. Come away with me, Sherlock."
From what he knew, Lestrade had seen the scene inside. It was an absolutely insane theory to believe, and probably not even true, but really, what other hope did he have?
Sherlock sighed. "... Fine. It's Moriarty, as you know, but his goal is to make me hurt you. I don't want that to happen..."
There was another gunshot, and then Lestrade was practically dragging Sherlock, who seemed fine, inside. Other cops in the Scotland Yard started to file out, preparing to take down the shooter.
"I'm not leaving you." Sherlock whispered into John's ear. "Please, believe me... I'm doing this because I love you..."
Sherlock was now quiet. He kept his eyes averted from John, worried he may be receiving a concerned or even upset gaze from the older man.
"Good grief, Dr. Watson, we were beginning to worry that you would never show up." said a smug, vaguely-Irish voice.
As they walked, Sherlock limping a bit, John remembered how Mycroft had vaguely suggested that Sherlock privately refers to him as something more than a colleague.
"We don't need one." Sherlock muttered. "He's not going to stop us from leaving. He'll have no trouble finding us later on, wherever we are."
"I never said you were right. You gave Sherlock support. Of course... Not even you could stop him from playing right into my plan."
Lestrade nodded and grabbed his radio from his belt. "Get a squad car ready to escort Dr. Watson..." He stammered into it.
"So now... Choose a side, Sherlock. Are you going to be an idiot and stay on the side of the angels, or will you join me? I mean, look at John. He's surrendered. He's given up on you already, Sherlock."
"Well, I feel I should at least reward you for thinking outside of the box, unlike all of these other idiots, but I'm kind of stuck here."
Lestrade let out a heavy sigh, then said, "Sherlock, I'm going to turn my back, and you're going to escape out from under my nose, alright?"
Sherlock opened his eyes, gazing at John curiously. As they were still very close together, John could feel Sherlock's heart rate speed up a tad.
The evil man laughed. "That won't do you any good. Your friend would think you're nuts. I'm not really here~."
Sherlock pulled out the bloody knife he had used to kill Magnussen and looked at it. He considered the consequences of using the knife on John, and decided to instead put it back into his coat pocket.
Sherlock looked through his received messages for a moment, and then with a sigh he put the phone away and resumed shooting the wall.
"That's what people would usually say. Why? Because they feel attachment to the one they love, so they don't want to hurt them. They feel, John, and because of that they throw out their self-preservation strategies to keep safe the one that makes them feel good. If nobody felt, maybe some of the victims of '
"Think of it this way; if I am to die, Sherlock will die first. That's the only way I'll go down. :) - JMx "
Sherlock leaned his head against the window and covered his eyes with his hand as if he was tired. "You deserve better than her, John."
"Just do it already, Sherlock." Moriarty said; Sherlock didn't know it, but he was now saying this aloud. "Why are you hesitating? John left. What he doesn't see won't kill him."
"I had to make bacteria for an experiment." was Sherlock's explanation to the sudden absence of milk.
"Still, I've... made my decision, if he really is going through with this. I just need to figure out how to move this plan of his along."
Sherlock's head twitched suddenly, but the taller man shook it off. "Get some rest, John." He said, faking a smile that was, unintentionally, somewhat unnerving.
"He'd have to be putting a lot of faith in you being distraught, though." The Consulting Detective couldn't seem to fathom anyone, even John, feeling sad about his death.
"Look, I don't know anymore!" Sherlock shouted, mussing up his hair in an uncharacteristic stress. "Maybe it's Magnussen! Maybe it's Moriarty! Hell, maybe it's ME, but does it matter?! We can't solve this case no matter who it is! We need to step back before it's too late!"
"So be it," Lestrade replied. "I'll be waiting at the crime scene." That said, the Detective Inspector left, and Sherlock slowly trailed behind John.
"To brag, really. I mean, I have finally won over Sherlock. He must have been surprised to find out just how intimately he knew my partner, ha ha!"
Sherlock ran out. "On second thought," he barked, "Shoot them all! Go to the hospital and the Diogenes Club while you're at it!"
"I was wondering why you stopped responding to my texts! I've taken Sherlock's cell. Magnussen's having fun with him. Want pictures?" This was followed by a heart emoticon.
"Perhaps they just targeted me randomly. I don't know the truth anymore, I'll admit. But you and I, we're both pretty suspicious, aren't we?"
He saw Sherlock there, swaying somewhat from side to side as he played the violin. He was in a room that John didn't recognize at first, but soon determined was Magnussen's living room.
In spite of him, Moriarty kept chuckling. "You hit like a girl," he sung. "Is that the best you've got?"
Sherlock gulped a bit. He had to admit the good doctor had a point. He took the knife out of his pocket and looked around for someplace to put it.
If Donovan was still standing, did that mean that she'd hurt Sherlock? Or had whoever who "took Sherlock hostage" done so instead?
"I can't think..." Bad sign when coming from Sherlock Holmes. It was possible that he was starting to go into shock from the wound.
"Think about it, John. He didn't have to show up. Maybe he shouldn't have. But he did. He's terrible at it, but I think he might be trying to apologize." She noticed that behind John, Sherlock had turned away and was stepping back into the limo.
Sherlock shuddered. He nearly rejected the action, but immediately forced himself to accept it, believing that something bad would happen if he didn't. He seemed to still be waiting for John to go further.
Sherlock sighed and tried to stand, only to collapse back to the floor. It was at this point that he realized he was bleeding. Perhaps the blood that coated him was his own...?
"If I start caring too much about the victim, then it might cloud my thoughts. I can't let myself care. But not caring is for some reason difficult right now." He confessed. "My actual reason for bringing you along is selfish; I want someone to talk me back to my senses if I seem to slip, even if that someone happens to be another person who knew the victim."
John had a gunshot wound on the left temple of his head and he had the look on his face as if he tried to say '
Sherlock glared at Moriarty, though he looked almost uncertain as to where he stood in his conflict.
Sherlock held him tightly, almost painfully so, burying his slender face into the crook of the doctor's neck.
" He said drastically, and John remembered he'd heard two gunshots, while it looked like Sherlock only had one injury and the guard had never emerged from the Staff Only area.
"I have no control over Magnussen. I couldn't make him stop even if I wanted to. Are you upset yet, Dr. Watson? Why don't you limp your way over here?" Moriarty sent him an address. "Come try to save your damsel in distress. See what happens."
"Inspector, that's not what she just said to me!" yelled John. "She said that Sherlock somehow got the gun away from his attacker and killed him!"
Magnussen smirked and indiscreetly reached out his hand, putting it on top of Sherlock's. He didn't seem too fazed when Sherlock moved his hand away in apparent disgust.
That wasn't so clear. His new wife watched him from the entrance in concern... or was it concern that maybe Magnussen had not gone?
It led him to the kitchen of 221B. Sherlock's microscope was there, as if he'd been using it recently. The kitchen as a whole was still utter chaos due to Sherlock's messy nature.
Thankfully, Sherlock took over the conversation from that point, educating John about the intricacies of a successful bee hive while John took the time to quietly panic. He felt flayed open, heart on display, but he forced his attention on Sherlock’s words as they savored cheese slathered in honey and tender bits of fancy meats on tiny pieces of toast. The food
SURPRISE. I decided to change some things around that threw off my whole update schedule, so I went ahead and posted another today to get everything back on track. SORRY/NOT SORRY. Tomorrow will be another two-chapter day.
He’s changed a lot in these past seven years. We both have. He’s a bit softer, a bit kinder. A lot wiser. More loving. He’s my best friend, the person I trust most, everything I need in this world. Seven years ago we were strangers with an instant connection and a shared craving for danger. Now? We’re a family.
“I want this with you, John,” Sherlock said in a fierce whisper. “I never thought I would, but with you…”
“I’ll give it to him tonight,” John said, cradling the envelope in his hand like a delicate, precious thing.
So she left me there, and I stayed for another hour and a half. I dove straight into the center of the dance floor and let their bodies cage me in, press against me, let them run their hands over me and want me and I teased them and ground my hips into them and pretended all the while that they were him, God, I
They hadn’t been out of the flat much since Sherlock began his recovery, other than their walks around the park when the weather cooperated. Sherlock’s moods had been erratic, and there were days when dragging himself out of bed was almost too much. Healing was ugly and difficult and slow, even for a man as effortlessly beautiful and brilliant as Sherlock. But he
John walked into the office today practically glowing. He came out to Sherlock on Tuesday, which brought him incredible relief, and ever since then he believes they have been dancing around “something”, though he’s hesitant to truly speculate on Sherlock’s feelings for him. He didn't even want to talk about their date tonight, which he is so looking forward to, because he didn’t want to “jinx it”. I praised his mature, controlled decision to wait until after our appointment today to pursue Sherlock, which brought us to the primary item on our agenda: the review of John's case notes from his anger management course.
John was quietly thankful for the tiny kitchens in both 221A and B; It was hard to get away from a gathering in one’s own home, but if Sherlock felt the need to leave Lestrade’s they could get away without much fuss. Memories of Mrs. Hudson’s late husband and the drugs he built his empire upon brought back urges from a darker time in Sherlock’s life, he’d confessed obliquely. He’d been fidgety all evening. Couch. Laptop. Violin. Microscope. Violin again.
“Where are your keys?” he murmured to Sherlock as they reached the door. Sherlock reached a shaking hand into his trouser pocket and withdrew his keyring, the metal clinking faintly with each shiver. John took them from him with gentle fingers, automatically flipping to the correct key and unlocking the front door.
And you somehow managed to balance being way into david bowie and freddie mercury without being utterly flaming. I don’t know how you managed to make that look hetero, but you did.
“You’re the one who wanted me to be your doctor. It’s my responsibility to understand where you’re at so I can choose the right medication and dosage.”
He squeezed Sherlock’s arm one more time, then glanced up and froze. Sherlock followed his gaze to… ah. Some cheeky bastard had tacked a sprig of mistletoe over their doorway where it couldn’t be avoided. Must have done it on their way out after the party. Greg, at Molly’s encouragement, most likely. Sherlock’s face went hot, couldn’t seem to form words. “Um…”
Lestrade and Molly bustled around, placing dish after dish of food onto a table already creaking under the weight of an enormous turkey. Mrs. Hudson’s sister-in-law (“Call me Jane, I’m no one’s missus!”) directed the evening like an air traffic controller. John and Sherlock watched in wide-eyed horror as the dishes accumulated.
They fell silent as Mummy took her seat beside Sherlock, and Father bustled in a moment later with another dish.
John bought himself some time to calm his nerves by getting up to fix a cup of tea, knowing Sherlock wouldn't tell the difference in the passage of time whether it was ten seconds or ten minutes. He took his tea back to his chair, sat, and breathed in the warm, soothing steam for a moment to steady himself for his confession.
“The first batch of papers is to void the marriage on the dual grounds of Mary Morstan’s false identity and criminal background. Typically there is a six week waiting period between the decree nisi and the decree absolute. You'll notice the forms are dated six weeks apart. I’ll be taking these straight to a colleague of mine after we’re done here to have them approved immediately.”
"All right, all right, enough torturing my future husband, arseholes. Pint of the bartender's piss for you apes, and their best scotch on the rocks for you, love," he said, presenting the drink to Sherlock with a flourish. Sherlock accepted it and sipped primly, but John could see the gleam in his eyes. He was obviously enjoying pulling one over on these men and approved of John's quick pick up of the game. John quirked a smile at him and sat, scooting his chair close so their legs pressed together under the table.
But there was something off in his voice, and the deductions lined up with hardly a conscious thought.
Sherlock had been surprisingly okay with the festive preparations up until the morning of December 22nd. Shopping, baking, and decorating had become sources of closeness with John, opportunities to enjoy a sort of domestic warmth he’d thought beyond him, rather than inventive forms of torture. John’s smiles had come so often, so readily over the past few days that it had been easy to sink into it all and get lost in a well of that Christmas spirit the rest of the world seemed so drunk on.
A stack of boxes against the far wall seemed a promising place to start. He tore at the tape sealing the nearest one shut and ripped the flaps of the box open. Clothes, Sherlock’s fine suits folded up and marked for charity in Mycroft’s own handwriting.
Sherlock spotted Lestrade across the room, speaking animatedly to a junior officer who all but fled at Sherlock's approach. Lestrade turned, puzzled, but his expression brightened in an odd way when he spotted Sherlock.
I’ve been in love with you for years, and I’m so sorry that I denied it for so long, but I want to be yours, and god, Sherlock, I want you to be mine. When I move back home, I want to move into your bedroom, not the bedroom upstairs. When I move back in, I want it to be forever. In some ways I feel like we’ve already been together for seven fucked up years and I just want… I just want to be with you. I just want to love you. We’ve worked so hard, made so much progress. Can we please put down the burdens we’re carrying and just be happy? Can we be happy, Sherlock? Even if it’s not romantically, or if it’s romantic but not physical, or however you want. I just want to be happy with you and Rosie.
Your intent to adopt has been filed with our office and a caseworker has been assigned to perform your in-home visitations. Three visits are required over three months. Your assigned dates are:
They broke into ridiculous giggles again, clutching each other even tighter. Sherlock rubbed his cheek against John’s and let his purely contented smile go unchecked, reveling in the marvel that was John Watson in his bed, sated and happy and
, but I thought it was your poorly-concealed attempt at a surprise gift. This is…” His lip curled. “…utterly devious.”
John’s heart flipped in his chest, and he grinned so hard he had to look away. “So sorry to inconvenience you.”
The Officer’s Lounge is a completely made up thing. I have no idea if such a thing exists. I needed a fireplace, so I made one.
Without looking up, Sherlock fumbled in the pocket of his dressing gown for his phone. Perhaps he could guilt John into coming home, thereby solving two problems at once. He pulled his face out of the couch and held his breath against the bacon scent as he typed out a quick text.

“Huh. It’s like looking in a bleeding mirror, it is,” Iain said, looking John over from head to toe. “A very boring, stuffy mirror, but you were right, Sherlock, I do certainly see the resemblance.”
“Amazing,” he said when Sherlock led them through a maze of alleys to the perfect ambush point, navigating the streets without hesitation.
“I forgive you for trying,” Sherlock said, then pulled a foil packet from the pocket of his pyjama bottoms and shoved it into John’s hand.
Sherlock took in a shuddering breath and leaned away from John, bracing his forearm against the window. A topic of conversation, something to distract—
“It’s been excruciating,” Sherlock said with complete naked honestly. “But he still has to say yes, you know. It’s not… automatic.” He risked a glance up at Lestrade, only to find an incredulous expression waiting for him.
John has historically been quite reluctant to open up during our sessions, but this session, as with the past two, was considerably more productive. As soon as I prompted him to describe how he was feeling, he revealed that he’d gotten drunk the night before and broke down over his conflicted feelings regarding his deceased wife. He continues to struggle with deep feelings of self-loathing and guilt, though today he was able to put a finer point on those feelings: He feels that he is not sad enough over her death and judges himself harshly for, on some level, being glad she is gone. The feelings are intensified by his continued fixation on her dying words (as described in session notes from 12/1/2017) and the associated guilt, especially regarding his emotional affair(s?).
The restaurant wasn’t their usual style, and John was painfully aware. The decor of The Dairy was hipster rustic, with simple wood tables, exposed brick, and bare bulb light fixtures with dark metal piping and wire. The menu had strange combinations of flavors and ingredients, as did the drinks, but thankfully Sherlock caught on as soon as he glanced at the tasting menu.
Today will be a two-chapter day! Check back later this afternoon or evening so you don't miss the second update.
John stood there, holding the heavy wooden door open with his good shoulder so he could rub his bare hands together for warmth.
A hand landed on his back, rubbed a comforting circle, then Mummy’s cheek pressed into his shoulder.
[SH lifts his head to find JW shifting his weight from foot to foot, clenching his fists, eyes squeezed shut, his breathing laboured. He scrambles to his feet and sweeps RW into his arms, then fastens her back into her pushchair. She complains for a moment, but settles as soon as a pair of ducks walk into her view. With RW secure, SH steps closer to JW and raises a tentative hand. JW flinches away, deliberately releases his clenched fists, relaxes his shoulders, and takes several deep breaths]
A long moment passed in silence as John’s hand continued its slow pass over Sherlock’s knobby spine, tracing scars as if he could erase them with each pass of his fingers, absorb those ragged lines into the whorls of his fingerprints. A permanent part of his identity. Evidence at a crime scene.
John took a few days to make some baseline observations for his experiment. He’d been a medical student, after all; Despite what Sherlock thought, he did know a thing or two about research. Average physical proximity, with an additional count of significant deviations. Average number of texts per day. Frequency and duration of eye contact. Average number of significant* touches per day.
I’m eternally grateful to everyone who left kudos and comments. You really made this a fun experience. I love you all!
The flush spread to the tips of Sherlock’s ears, and it was all Molly could do to keep from giggling as he nodded silently and requested a second bottle. She sidled up to him at the register and knocked her shoulder against his.
He sipped half-heartedly at his soup while John shoveled risotto into his mouth, scrolling through their Netflix queue until he finally gave up and put on a Bond film they’d both seen at least twice. It was only for distraction anyway.
A small smile curled at the corner of Sherlock’s mouth. “I haven’t been back for New Year’s Eve since I was seventeen, but I imagine we’ll eat too much at supper and drink too much champagne in front of the fire while Mummy murders us all at cards.”
Molly must have picked up on Sherlock’s unusual quiet, too, because she eventually broke into the conversation with a distraction.
“Of course,” Sherlock says, twirling to face him with a dramatic flourish of his coat. “Your victim has recently made his boss very unhappy, through no particular fault of his own. I would check the secretary’s car, and confront the boss in his office. If his office has red carpet, you have your man.”
“Cold. Hot. Nauseated. Everything hurts.” He hesitated. “Cravings. And my brain is… separated. Drifty.”
Sherlock would not be so easily dissuaded, though, so John deployed one of his recently acquired distraction techniques: physical contact.
Sherlock is crouched over a freshly-dead body when Greg first notices it: an elaborately carved gold ring on Sherlock’s left hand, gleaming and new.
[sealed in an envelope marked only with the date, a gold wedding band resting between the folded pages]
While he waited for the kettle to boil, John took out his phone and turned it over in his hand a few times.
My boys, I couldn’t be happier for you. I knew from that first day that you would be together. You were made for each other. I do wish you would keep it down just a bit, though. My television can only drown out so much.
but the constant clamor of need and secrets had finally been excised. He dared a glance up at Sherlock’s face, frozen in an unreadable expression.
“Now,” she continued, “champagne with breakfast, I think. A toast for our boys. What do you say, Father?”
Mary appeared in the open doorway of the flat, a bit out of breath from the climb, but cold and hard all the same. Pregnancy did nothing to diminish the crackle of dangerous energy about her, same as the night in the empty house, as she studied their proximity, their expressions, sharp eyes missing nothing.
Y'all, I might... actually not do a smut chapter? I might skip straight to a parentlock epilogue? Or I might just be done and leave it here? I feel like it could end here. Your input is valued.
John squeezed his eyes shut, tilted his head to the side, breathing through the wave of pain. A good man. Right.

“I was… in a bad place at the time,” Sherlock said, hesitant. “And on a case. And I got shot, a bit.”
John wrenched his eyes away from Sherlock’s body and snatched the baby monitor off the desk, his heart aching. Mrs. Hudson was home, and she was always good for tea and company. Yes. Tea. Good. Safe. He crept down to 221A, careful to avoid the squeaky stair, and knocked gently on Mrs. Hudson’s door. She opened it a moment later with a brilliant smile.
This is the last chapter for today, and the last chapter of the main part of the fic. There will be five long epilogue chapters after this, one per day except Friday, which will have two. We're nearly done. *sniffle*
“I’m sure, Sherlock.” John squeezed Sherlock’s shoulder, then let his hand fall away and rolled out of bed before the conversation could go any further. Too much all at once. Too much in Sherlock’s current state of mind. Get him better. Make him well.
“Don’t go,” Sherlock whispered. He shifted his weight from foot to foot, then reached out and tipped John’s chin up with one bent finger. John was hit with the full force of Sherlock’s focus, his eyes seeming to beg for… something. “It’s all fine, right?”
smell perfect. The perfect companion to this moment, this night, the warm, blooming feeling in the pit of his stomach.
“This is such a bad idea, god,” he said, and trailed off into a groan as he dragged the tip of his cock over Sherlock’s relaxed entrance, smearing the lube around and pushing, pushing until just the head slid inside.
He took a breath, tried in vain to make the words pass from thought to sound, from heart to tongue, and shook his head.
"When we get home," Sherlock rumbled, but never finished, opting to kiss up the side of his neck instead.
Besides, if they left, he'd have to let go of Sherlock. And he thought he might physically crumble to ashes if he had to let go.
defending my honor.” Sherlock tugged lightly on the belt loop between his fingers. “Let’s go, John.”
“What else does he need to do to prove to you that he wants you here? Both of you?” she asked. “Honestly, John, I’m truly asking.”

“Well then. Best get our shoes on and put away the bacon,” Father said, dropping a kiss at his wife’s temple before shuffling off to find socks.
I didn’t mean to. As soon as it happened I had an immediate crisis of ‘I don’t do that anymore, I left that back in Afghanistan, it was just the convenience,’ and so on. I was a bit of a slag in the army, I’m embarrassed to admit. Had something of a reputation for being willing to get on my knees.
“I wanted a do-over of that night,” John said. “I wanted to go back and keep Tess from interrupting us. I wanted to go back and keep…

John smiled despite the nervous hammering of his heart and opened the door behind him. He climbed out into the warm summer evening and held the door for Sherlock, holding out his hand to help him out. Sherlock hesitated for the barest fraction of a second before taking it.
I'm out of town at a work thing/visiting with a dear fandom friend, so posting will be sporadic today.
I’ve given you so much grief about Irene Adler over the years. You were always so dodgy about her, would never give me a straight answer, and I always assumed it was because you had feelings for her but didn’t know how to act on them, or didn’t want anyone to know. I just wanted to support you, if she was what you wanted. Now I know better. I’ll leave it alone. I promise.
Your advice makes sense. I think I have a friend who could go with me, if you want to send me a few addresses. Maybe a bar or club would be good. Not that I need to be around alcohol right now, but at least I know how to handle myself in that kind of environment. I’d be a bit more comfortable there than sitting around in a coffee shop staring at blokes in cardigans or something.
Actually, no. Well, only in a... distant sort of way. I enjoy the puzzle and the thrill of the chase… doing something good.
: Sherlock has made great strides in his lifelong struggle with suicide attempts and ideation. He expresses much healthier attitudes about suicide these days, though he still frames those attitudes around how others will be impacted by his death rather than any great personal value for his own life. He remains preoccupied with the concept, though his healing relationship with his best friend and goddaughter seem to have eliminated any immediate threat. More on this and suggested treatments in the summary of session notes below.
“Ah, you seemed so much younger at the time, though I suppose some of that youthful energy may have been the drugs talking. Good thing you shut Frank’s business down before you indulged in too much of his product, am I right?”
Mrs. Hudson eyed the dish skeptically, but took her place across from it all the same. “This really is quite the production when done at home. Nothing at all like those big catered suppers Frank made us have way back when, don’t you think, Jane?”
John cried out as Sherlock took his cock in again, his fingers tangling in dark curls and pulling a rumbling groan from Sherlock’s throat.
, heavy with significance and implication? And how many times had he been too cowardly to let that gaze catch, let it open him up and reveal?
[Written in black pen on the back of a cheaply-printed pub menu. the handwriting starts sloppy and gets sloppier]
John pressed his forehead into Sherlock's temple and gave a weak chuckle. "I thought I was painfully transparent and you were just exercising discretion for the first time in your life."
I guess in hindsight maybe he wasn’t completely wrong. but I honestly did prefer rugby ovwr football.
Except he knew his mother. And his mother knew his traitorous heart, knew how it would set to dancing at the sight of their joined names.
Sherlock turned onto his stomach and buried his face in the pillow with a groan, then peeked out with one eye.
“Don’t care,” Sherlock grumped. He flopped back on the bed beside John and curled his long form around him. “I want to stay here.”
He held out a hand to Sherlock and hauled him out of his chair, catching him when he wobbled a bit. “And we’ll… talk about some things. Okay?”
“So, why this particular wine?” John asked as he finished his final sip, tracing his tongue along the rim of the glass to catch the final drop. Sherlock followed the motion in a daze, entranced, until he realized he’d been asked a question.
John has refrained from drinking entirely since our last appointment. He continues to lose sleep while processing all the changes in his life and thinking of Sherlock, but nothing out of the ordinary.
Sherlock scowled, but swept his thumb over the back of John’s hand, not yet ready to let go. “Mummy was the mastermind behind this, you know. Meddling is one of our time-honored family traditions, and she’s the worst of the lot. She’s orchestrated all this as a method of prying into my life, so she can interrogate everyone I know and study my interactions with them.”
“So, we’re celebrating?” He leaned back and laid his arm across the low top of the booth, nonchalant, but his eyes were soft and hopeful.
“I should be off too, I suppose. Don’t want Harry to have to pick me up from the tube station too late.”
“John Watson,” Mummy Holmes had snapped, and his spine had automatically straightened to attention. “I know my son. I watched him build that wall he uses to hide his heart as a young man. I know it for what it is. Armor. Protection, John. All he’s waiting for his a sign from you.”
After he filled me in on the details of the case, we spent much of the afternoon tracking down other veterans with local ties to our initial client. Sherlock left the talking to me, fortunately, as my common ground with our victims made it much easier to relate and communicate. A pattern quickly emerged—all our veterans had some tie in their daily routine to a particular neighborhood in Brixton. The rest of our evening was spent sneaking through dirty alleys and staring at shop fronts for endless hours while Sherlock deduced everyone that walked by to keep me entertained. Sherlock was brilliant, as always, uncovering the link between particular shops, something about mud and tyre tread, I don’t know. What I do know is that it was good to be back on a case with him again, and even better that we got to help some of my fellow veterans. I’ve missed this.
Sherlock spun the stem of his wine glass between his thumb and forefinger, watching the wine form a tiny whirlpool inside. He smiled, a tiny, sad quirk of his lips, and shrugged.
I want to be able to care without feeling like I have to react in the way that’s expected of me (total prick, he says)
Sherlock growled in frustration and scrubbed his hands over his curls, but when he spoke he was tired. Defeated. “You would have regretted not going back to her.”
“Oh, come on, now that’s cheating!” John protested. He slid his forearm along the bar so his arm was nearly around Sherlock’s shoulder, sliding closer when the door swung open to admit the icy breeze and flurries. The proximity, the scent of him, the humor and body heat all loosened Sherlock’s tongue more than he would have liked.
John shook his head ruefully, but he laid a hand on Sherlock’s leg and looked at me without any shame or hesitance. “I know it’s fast. But this is what’s right for us.” (“Fast? It’s been
“I wasn’t ready for you then, John, and I’m sorry. I’m ready for you now. I’ve loved you, I love you, and I will love you. John Watson,” he said, as if relishing the feel of John’s name on his tongue. “If you’ll have me.”
“Okay, young man,” Mrs. Hudson said, her tone scolding. “It’s time to share all that wool you’ve been gathering. I know you’re hopeless at these things, so I’ll help you start. Why on Earth haven’t you moved back in yet?”
“When Harry…” he began, then cleared the roughness from his throat. “When Harry came out, my father beat the hell out of her.”
John squeezed Sherlock’s bicep. “I have to at least drop by for a bit at Christmas. She’s the only family I have left.”
“So good to see you, John, truly,” he said, thumping him hard on the back. “I hear my wife has been meddling.”
"That mouth haunts my dreams," Iain said, and tapped two fingers over the business card in Sherlock’s pocket. He stepped back, shoved his hands in his pockets and raised his eyebrows cheekily at John, then tossed a quick wink at Sherlock on his way out the door. His retreating footsteps seemed to carry all the air in the room with him.
A life, sorted and packed. The furniture, huddled like silent ghosts in the bare flat. Every bit of clutter, of life, of
Sherlock, who was running a hand soothingly up and down John's arm and nuzzling his shoulder, providing comfort exactly like a lover should.
Sherlock shifted in his chair and knocked his foot against John's under the table with a pleading expression.
“Come on. Bottom’s up,” John said. He tapped his cup against Sherlock and tipped his entire thing back, drinking deeply.
“No, John,” Sherlock said, opening his eyes and looking straight into John’s. “I’ve never been with a woman and never will. I don’t think I
-- Too much. I lost count, but I think I had maybe 6 glasses of scotch in way too short a time. I read Sherlock’s letter and I started to… I needed to calm down, and then I was emailing with my sister and all this old stuff started coming up and…
All pretense of wellness was gone. The naloxone had helped, had held Sherlock’s facade in place for nearly an hour, but here, between the two of them in the empty shell of their shared home, Sherlock shook and sweated, pleaded with silent, pained eyes. John sat on the edge of the bed, brushed the damp curls off Sherlock’s forehead, and Sherlock curled onto his side, curving around John’s hip and leaning his forehead into John’s thigh with a strangled whisper.
[As JW approaches, RW catches sight of SH and squeals happily. She reaches out for SH with both arms and nearly launches herself out of JW’s hold. Between the two of them, JW and SH keep her from falling. SH gathers her onto his hip with a hand on her bottom while JW holds onto her sides. JW and SH’s eyes meet for a long moment. A really long moment. Eventually Sherlock brings his other hand up to rub over RW’s back, and he places a kiss on her forehead. JW stares, breathing shallowly.]
(* - more than fleeting or accidental contact, a deliberate touch. Though, knowing Sherlock, any “accidental” contact could in fact be deliberate, played off with his superior acting skills.)
“Shockingly, I think you have been a good influence on me. I’m active, I do good for the community, I rarely shoot people, and I’m happy—I’d say that’s an improvement on the 2010 edition of John Watson, for sure.”
: I think it’s absolutely true that many people with mental health issues, including many of our veterans, are looked down upon or dismissed. It’s unfortunate, and I hope this case will shed some light on the need for better support for our returning veterans and better awareness of mental health as a society.
And Sherlock seemed to walk extra close, linger extra near, as they went out the door and climbed into their cab.
John smiled into the kiss and ran a hand through Sherlock’s curls. "This is not how I thought this night would end."
On his third try, John found the box he needed: tea kettle, sugar dish (empty), several of their (Sherlock’s) random mismatched mugs… but John’s RAMC mug was nowhere to be found. He’d never taken it with him to Mary’s, couldn’t bear the thought of it leaving 221B, but it wasn’t in the box with the rest.
“Do that group over there next, over at the corner table,” John murmured, his warm breath ghosting over the shell of Sherlock’s red-tipped, frozen ears. They’d ducked into the pub to warm up after an unlikely afternoon of preparatory Christmas errands, but the trip had quickly morphed to an exercise in self-control. A delicious shiver danced its way down Sherlock’s spine, pooling low in his belly and taking his mind to decidedly inappropriate places. He cleared his throat and gestured with his chin.
to be. It took me bloody years to get it out of him, Sherlock, but he told it to me straight over a year ago. He's in love with you, but he's too afraid of losing you to say anything. Got it into his head that you're not interested in that sort of thing."
The Officer’s Lounge at New Scotland Yard was the perfect spot for a casual office holiday party. A small kitchen for easy food service, a long countertop that made for a perfect impromptu bar, and a crackling fireplace to set the mood. The atmosphere hummed with good cheer and comforting warmth, enough to forgive the loud clash of brightly-colored Christmas jumpers and overly-loud laughter.
He pulled Sherlock down, crushed their mouths together, and felt every stray, broken part of him snap into place.
. John kissed the tip of Sherlock’s nose, his cheekbones, dragged his mouth over Sherlock’s jaw and bit, drawing groans and pleading and
“Boring,” Sherlock said from behind his microscope. “And pointless. They’ll be here in a week. Why send a card with ‘holiday greetings’ when they’ll be here to deliver them in person?”
, on every possible level. He peeked up at Sherlock from the corner of his eye and caught him looking back. Shifted closer.
Okay, we’re very confused John!! Give us a call soon?? Big hugs to you and your beautiful baby!!! Xxxxxxxxx
It took a moment for the pressure of the silence to break through Sherlock’s internal battle. He looked up in alarm to find John staring at the card, his mouth tight and unhappy. Sherlock stood, came to John’s side to look over his shoulder.
The solicitor split off the last form and slipped it into an envelope, then passed it to John. “That one will need Mr. Holmes’ signature.”
“It’s a lot to ask,” he finally said. “Sherlock didn’t sign up to have a baby around all time, nor did you—”
Sherlock pulled John close and sank his mouth into John’s and John whimpered and dug his fingers into Sherlock’s hair and the cliff fell out from under them, rocks breaking apart with a shuddering crack, sending the both of them tumbling towards the churning water below. Adrenaline surged through Sherlock’s body and his heart hammered and his brain screamed and he didn’t let go of John, not for a second. When they hit the water, plunging into the unforgiving waves, it hurt like hell.
John stared at Sherlock’s empty chair and watched it grow blurry before his eyes. Everything inside of John was burning, stinging, sliced open, about to overflow. He could barely breathe, let alone speak.
“Am I bothering you, my being here?” John asked. He was afraid of the answer to this question, but he still needed to ask. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he was making everything worse.
John’s mobile buzzed, and when he saw it was Sherlock he had absolutely no say over the grin that broke out over his face.
“What I’m feeling at the moment,” John said, “is a very strong desire to wring Sherlock’s neck. Not sure you want me feeling that way about you.”
“That was a matter of urgency,” Sherlock said. He leaned closer to John, his voice a rumble. “Once we arrive back at Baker Street, I’ll very much want to take my time.”
There was a sound happening. Something soft and low. Someone’s voice, saying something. Familiar syllables, the sort of sound he had heard over and over before. The voice seemed to be coming from far away. If Sherlock was flying, he would have said the voice came from the earth, too far away to worry over. However, Sherlock had recently come to the conclusion that he was more than likely not flying.
“We’ll do our best,” John said, knowing that any promises of safety were to be a bit empty with Sherlock around. Sherlock made a humming noise, suggesting he hadn’t even been listening.
Sherlock released his arm as a cab pulled up in front of them. “I’m sure I didn’t,” he said. “My calculations for alcohol intake were iron-clad.”
“Well,” Darren said, “guests are due back on the boat in fifteen minutes. What do we do if…” he waved a hand, “whatever you two are expecting to happen doesn’t happen?”
isn’t,” John said, but he gave up the fight nonetheless. Sherlock’s arms rested upon both of his shoulders as he navigated to the blog post in question. He settled his chin on the top of John’s head.
“Christ,” John moaned against him, his lips spreading into a smile. “You really are a bloody genius.”
“It can be real, you know,” Sherlock said, his voice so quiet it was barely sound. “I can make it real.”
the bloody puzzle and he is intent on solving you in a matter of minutes. He flattens his body against yours and he’s hard already but you’ve been hard for ages now and you need this, his body on yours, his erection pressing against your stomach. Movement. Friction. Heat.
“You don’t think that a criminal gang known for murdering their former colleagues murdered Declan?” John asked. “A man we now know was in with them?”
“Your husband was just telling me about Declan,” he said. “He said Declan was a quiet man. Kept to himself.”
John tightened his hands on the wheel. In truth, he had no idea how to answer her question. “Yes,” he said. “We can.” He didn’t even know if it was a lie or not.
Sherlock crawled closer to the blown-open part of the cottage, hugging as close to the remaining bits of wall as he could. “I think I see him,” he whispered. “He’s using a tree for cover.”
John woke the next morning with a terrible crick in his neck and the feeling that, through becoming engaged, he had managed to cock up just about everything in his life. His sleep the night before was restless and disjointed, a part of his brain remaining awake on the off-chance that Sherlock came to bed. He even kept the light on for Sherlock, what he hoped would be a clear invitation that Sherlock was welcome, that John was waiting. When he opened his eyes, the light was still on and the bed was empty. John groaned and closed his eyes again.
John smiled, bent down to frame Sherlock’s face with his thumbs and press a sweet kiss on his lips. His eyes were soft and bright, such a deep blue when viewed so close up, and the mischievous crinkle at their corners stoked the fire in Sherlock’s belly. He lifted his hips and dragged himself over John’s slick cock with an impatient groan.
“I want more delivered to Baker Street within thirty minutes,” John ordered. “Vials, not auto-injectors. Intravenous injection is better.”
“And hungry now, too! If I’d known a good shag would make you so compliant, I would have gotten my courage up a long time ago.”
I always knew in the back of my head that I didn’t really love her enough. She was fine, at first. It was comfortable. It was what I thought I was supposed to want, and it wasn’t anything special, but it was… fine. She met me when I was still a complete mess, a walking shell of a person. I know we don’t talk about that time when you were gone, but I just had no idea who I was without you. I felt like I’d had limbs amputated and my brain couldn’t process the new shape of my body. Maybe that’s too much. I’m saying too much right now. This is a whole other topic. But the point is, I married her for all the wrong reasons, then was horribly unhappy and bitter that I couldn’t have the things I really wanted, that I was trapped in a life I didn’t want, not really, but one that I chose and vowed to keep anyway.
Mummy hummed her assent. “My boy is in love, so much that it’s painful to see.” She paused. “But that happened ages and ages ago. The quiet is new.” She sipped at her drink and waited, her silence filled with expectation. She would wait all night for her answer, Sherlock knew. He closed his eyes and took a silent breath.
I’m sorry you were so unhappy with Mary, and I’m doubly sorry if you feel that I pushed you into going back to her. I truly thought you wanted that life with her, though I’ll admit that my judgment was clouded for reasons I will explain. Eventually.
Somehow, having the wine in the same physical location as John had suddenly made the reality of giving it to him, drinking it
“John, all I said was that I preferred white lights instead of multicolored because of the way the lights clashed with the ornaments. It wasn’t a judgment of your ornaments or a statement of class,” Sherlock argued automatically, though the vast majority of his brain was stuck on repeat, hearing
Sherlock opened his mouth to protest, but Greg and John picked up the thread of the conversation and ran with it, chattering on about preparations for the party, gift buying, and any number of other festive topics. Sherlock was too lost in the feel of John’s strong hand still around his arm to bother resisting again. He smiled, his own small version of the cookies-John-
I can’t believe I’ve been hating myself for this for years, since I was a teenager. I hated myself for loving Sherlock because he was a man. I still hate myself, a little bit, for wanting him because he’s my best friend. Hopefully that last little bit will be gone soon, though. Because I have to tell him.
John, who was practically growling beside him, pacing and clenching his fists, doing the sniff thing that meant his temper was barely in check.
[Written on plain white paper and sealed in an envelope with “For Sherlock” written on the front, then left in Sherlock’s coat pocket]
He huffed into the curve of John’s neck, frustrated. John took pity. He drew a hand slowly over Sherlock’s back in a gentle rhythm and steered the conversation back before Sherlock could withdraw.
Sherlock cut him off by whipping a pen out of his coat pocket and signing with more careful precision than John had ever seen from the man who once tried to endorse a check by stabbing it. He stashed the pen, then blinked down at the papers for several minutes, a tiny smile slowly creeping onto his lips.
"Well, it seems to me that you've been trying to show him through acts of service, but that's apparently not his love language. Perhaps you should try something else."
Mycroft reached into his inside jacket pocket, withdrew another auto-injector, and passed it to John without a word. John pressed the injector against the meat of Sherlock’s thigh and depressed the trigger as soon as they stopped at a red light. Sherlock took a gasping breath and let his head fall back against the seat as the heroin-morphine-oxycontin was violently ejected from his brain’s opioid receptors.
"You promised," Sherlock definitely did not whine, but he did... squeeze John's hand back ever so slightly. John's faintly amused grin deepened into something that bled from his chest and showed everything, he was sure. But he couldn't look away.
Sherlock would need maximum specificity. Had to have all the facts. Couldn't leave anything to assumption or implication. John took a bracing sip of tea and forged ahead.
John grunted his acknowledgement and put on a burst of speed, cutting to the right to make that direction a less appealing option for the suspect. Sure enough, the man wavered for a moment, then disappeared down the alley to the left at full tilt.
It will never happen again. I will never willingly leave you. I will never abandon you and Watson. I will never use again. I will retire from the work before I’ll allow something to take me away from the two of you.
“I meant what I said, John. Figuring it all out… everyone hurts someone in the process. Though you obviously decided it was a phase.” He paused. “Not gay, as you’ve said.”
“You sure you don’t want to wait till midnight?” he murmured teasingly against Sherlock’s mouth. “That star thing was quite sweet.”
Yeah, yeah, you did. Though, to be fair, you knew me in Afghanistan, so you had some insider information.
John forced himself to stand his ground, to resist the urge to retreat. "Lots of people assume we're together anyway, so it won't be much of a stretch for my army mates to believe. We go, we say hello, have a drink, I catch up with the blokes a bit, then we get out of there as soon as possible. I get to see them without getting ribbed all night for Three Continents Watson being nearly 40 and single, nor getting the third degree for showing up with a woman, who would run away screaming when the guys likely revealed way too much about my... habits over there."
John allowed himself a brief minute to breathe in the fresh afternoon air, to let new truths settle into their puzzle piece slots before diving into the busy closing time crowd at Speedy’s. 3:15 PM, just enough time to order fish and chips, some veggie risotto, and a cup of soup in case nothing else sat well on Sherlock’s stomach. He sat down at the frontmost table to wait for his order and was hardly surprised when the tip of an umbrella and a pair of bespoke shoes obscured his view of the floor. A faint rattle accompanied the drop of another prescription bag against the tabletop next to him.
I expressed some concern over the speed at which he seemed to be moving, but his response was swift and definitive. He’s been “obsessing” over his sexuality in the back of his mind for more than half his life, and now that he’s finally pulled everything into the light, he feels anxious to “get the hell on with it” and live truthfully. He pointed out, rightfully so, that much of the pain he’s caused Sherlock over the years has been a direct result of his repression, and he’s eager to do away with anything that might cause Sherlock pain in the future.
They lay there in the dark, their arms wrapped around each other in the bed they now shared, in the home they’d built and destroyed and rebuilt. John poured every ounce of his love into the glide of his hands and mouth, smoothing over the cracks and scars and damning evidence of uncaring use. Through six years of demons and ghosts they’d found each other, and John let the certainty of it settle once and for all into the deepest parts of his heart.
“John, I do hope you’re not planning to take this slow. You realize this time next week we could have a baby?” Sherlock’s hand dropped onto his leg and slid up, up, high on the inside of his thigh. “We need to have as much sex as possible, starting
“You understand how dire the matter is, then,” Sherlock replied, turning his lips to John’s jawline, brow, cheek,
Sherlock hauled John against him and slanted their mouths together, tracing his tongue along John’s bottom lip so he could dip inside, slide his tongue hot and demanding against John’s until they were both hard and gasping. John ground against him and let out a stuttering moan at the feel of their cocks moving together for the first time.
[Sherlock presses his lips together and closes his eyes, then takes a deep breath in through his nose]
It had been quite a task to procure tea, milk, and sugar from Mrs. Hudson without engaging in a drawn out discussion of Sherlock’s fate, but he’d managed with a battery of doctorly excuses and a healthy dose of his trademark prickliness. He filled the kettle and set it to boil, then prepared their two mugs side by side, just like before. It had only been a week, after all. The muscle memory still carried his fingers from task to task, easy as breathing.
Eight years ago today I met a man who charmed me almost despite himself, a man who swept me into a whirlwind of adventure and danger and breathed life back into a broken soldier ready to let go of it all. I loved you then, but I was afraid. I loved you even as my mouth denied it. I loved you as I betrayed you. I loved you and I let you go. I loved you, and loved you, and loved you for years, and it is the greatest happiness of my life to get to share it with you openly now. Our anniversary may be June 16th, but January 29th will always be the day my life changed for good.
Sherlock’s thoughts whirled with all the potential future occasions: first real date, first anniversary, engagement, wedding night,
“Oh, how noble. I could have sworn you were ready to go for it that day I barged in. You looked so sweet, about to confess everything, but I didn’t feel like waiting around for you to break up with me. So sorry.”
I did have one drink just to help loosen up, and it’s not okay and it’s not a good thing, but it helped me relax enough to let go, and once I let go it felt so right that I don’t think I’ll need that relaxing drink ever again. I can’t believe I’ve been drinking this away for years. I feel like a fool, like I’ve missed out on so much… but it’s not too late to have the one thing I truly want.
Molly snagged Sherlock by the crook of his arm and tugged him to a halt. The grumbling, holiday-rushed crowd pressed them against the wall of another glittering shop full of toys and delicate ornaments and a thousand other things Sherlock insisted on studying through the window, rather than meeting Molly’s gaze.
John hummed. Everything left out of the hasty admission hung between them, silent and understood. Their fingers brushed, then tangled, pressed and held.
“You said ‘Sherlock’ is a family name, right?” John asked, shutting the door firmly behind Mr. and Mrs. Holmes. Their visit to 221B had been brief but terribly amusing from John’s perspective; watching Sherlock attempt civility for hours on end was the most entertainment he’d gotten all week.
Sherlock was still looking at John as if the answers to his worries were obvious, plain as the nose on his face. “Clearly, the werewolf isn’t interested in
you.” He wasn’t particularly sure why he chose to argue with his own subconscious about this fact, but he went along with it anyway.
You could stay tonight, you know. There’s a woman at a table with two friends who has been edged out of the conversation. She’s looking sullen and would easily jump for a bit of attention to give her a cheaply-bought sense of worth. There’s a bloke across the room who keeps touching his obviously-straight friend’s arm a little
that popped his eyes open. Something about a wall seemed familiar, the way the brick pressed against his back, scratched against his jacket. There was a feeling that went along with it, something akin to heat and need. He narrowed his eyes. He went after the memory, but it was gone just as quickly as it came.
“What on earth would make you think that you are of any value to me?” Sherlock’s voice was sharp, biting. “Do you really think you contribute in any meaningful way to my work? Do you really think you
” John shouted, but Sherlock was gone, disappearing just beyond the house, heading down the hill and towards the shore after the limping shooter.
“Did you used to?” John asked. “When you came back, that is?” His voice sounded wrong, like he was being strangled.
John woke up alone in his bed and it was bloody cold. He pulled the blankets around him, doing his best to burrow under and save all skin from contact with the outside world, but it was still bloody cold. He found himself aching for the presence of a warm body next to him. A very specific warm body. He shook away the thought.
“Good,” Sherlock said, dropping his voice to a whisper so Darren wouldn’t overhear. “I don’t know if Will is so simple as to return to this island so soon after you nearly caught him, but the chances are high. He’s desperate. And violent. And desperate, violent men are dangerous.” Sherlock’s eyes bored into John’s with intensity. “If you must run towards him, be sure that you are
“Highly likely,” Sherlock said. He was pacing atop the sofa opposite John, his fingers pressed together under his chin.
It takes you a moment to spy the shape, but eventually you see it. It’s on a building in the distance—a kilometer or so away, if you had to judge. The snipers always had better eyes for that sort of thing than you did, but you learned a trick or two while you were abroad. It’s just a shadow against the night sky, and you might’ve said it was just some piece of the building, an oddly-shaped air conditioning unit or something, were it not for the little cloud of smoke billowing around it. The smoke ebbs and flows, coming and going like breathing, and it’s cigarette smoke, you can tell. Somebody about a kilometer away is on the roof of their building, smoking a cigarette and staring out at the robotic city just like you.
You whimper against him and it’s like he cracked you open again, split you in two right down the middle and went swimming about inside. “How are you doing this?” you breathe. You have to know, because it doesn’t seem real. All of this seems too extraordinary to be real.
John was certain he saw the corner of Sherlock’s lip twitch up into a little smile. He was about to ask Sherlock how specifically they were to be involved in these holiday home murders when a tiny knocking sounded at the door, followed by a cheery
John certainly couldn’t stop the smile now, so he covered it with a rub of his hand. “All right,” he said. He took a sip of what was left of his tea. It was cooling, but still felt familiar and warm in his mouth. It tasted of home, of England, of Baker Street with Sherlock. Sherlock took a sip of his tea in kind, his eyes remaining fixed on John, observing. John supposed Sherlock could observe if he wished.
“Not really,” John said. “Sherlock decided to barge in—” He stopped himself, sighing at his own admission.
When the two of you arrive at Lee Street, it is properly dark and the streets are as close to deserted as London can get. Cedars Bank is situated along a row of buildings, closed-up shops at either side and flats overhead. Sherlock has the two of you turn down the next street over and guides you towards the back of the bank, the service exit. His eyes dart around and he pulls a small tool from his pocket. He sets to work on the lock.
Sherlock had to start making predictions about where Mary was heading next, rather than where she just was. Otherwise, he and John would chase her around the globe for an eternity, and John had Rosie to consider. Sherlock was reasonably certain that Mary would be making a move to somewhere in Scandinavia soon. Helsinki seemed like the best option, but he couldn’t rule out Stockholm either. Finland or Sweden. The wrong choice could cost them considerable time, time they didn’t have. John needed to return to Rosie soon. Sherlock put feelers out to the few Scandinavian contacts he had, as well as several of the local ne’er-do-wells in Estonia. So far, nothing.
“He stopped,” Sherlock said. His eyes darted around madly, scanning for footprints. “He stopped. He…” Sherlock dropped to the ground, crawling about on his hands and knees in circles on the path, searching for evidence. John leapt to the side to get out of his way, balancing with a hand against the steep mountain to his side.
John said. He could feel his heart start to sink into his stomach. His fears seemed on the verge of coming true, then—that any moments of affection between the two of them were little more than an impulsive decision for Sherlock, some way for him to express his exuberance over a break in the case. Something they just did now, from time to time. Still, he found himself moving towards Sherlock, a wave drifting towards the shore.
Sherlock looked genuinely offended, but he stood and moved towards the door. “If we were boyfriends,” he said, “this would be a commonplace practice.”
John looked up from the note, not really seeing Sherlock because he wasn’t really there. “It means that you… That whoever left this note…”
221B was dark and silent when they arrived. Mrs. Hudson had long since gone to sleep. She would ask about the explosion in the morning, would fret about the danger in which the two of them put themselves, but Sherlock was done thinking about the matter for the evening. John switched on a single lamp in the sitting room and the two stood in the dim light, watching each other, not saying a word. John was tattered and dirty, debris and plaster clinging to his torn clothes, dust caked into his face. John watched Sherlock as if waiting for his next command.
“I thought I would…” Sherlock gestured vaguely at the bed, his gaze darting back and forth from John’s eyes to anywhere else in the room, “join.”
“It was wrong,” Sherlock said. “I know you don’t… I know you aren’t… I shouldn’t have told you. And I certainly shouldn’t have asked how you felt. It was selfish of me and it caused you discomfort. Forgive me, John.”
For her part, Gilly didn’t seem to take to Sherlock either. Their interactions were brief and terse, and Gilly’s uncharacteristic level of silence when he was around was more than a little telling of her attitudes towards the man. However, John couldn’t say he blamed her; Sherlock was making it easy on no one.
dreams, he would think of them as, and leave it at that. They got particularly bad around the time Irene Adler reared her ridiculously-coiffed head; for a while there, John dreaded going to sleep, knowing he was only to wake up an hour or so later with a confusing erection and a head full of profanity. They always waxed and waned, though. He could manage.
John ruffled Sherlock’s hair, nudging him. “Budge up,” he said. “I’ve got to get her changed and fed.”
Sherlock sighed again, a heavy thing. “If we can quickly skip over the bit where you have some sort of internal conflict about this sort of thing,” he said, “I am quite interested in going back to sleep at some point.”
“I’m square on the first two,” John said, wincing as Sherlock whipped around an already fast-moving car and John’s arm jammed into the armrest, “although I’m not so sure
The corner of his lip slants up into a smile, as if you’ve just challenged him to a very satisfying duel. “You don’t like it here,” he says, “but you don’t like it much of anywhere. You don’t like it at the pub and you don’t like it in your flat and you certainly don’t like it at your humdrum little job at the surgery. Who could blame you, though? Wiping noses and soothing rashes must be the very definition of tiresome for an
Now Sherlock was seated on the bed, perched against some pillows he propped up on the headboard, scrolling through his phone. He had already cleaned his teeth and changed into his pyjamas and was decidedly ready for bed. It was late, a bit later than John usually tried to be in bed on nights that didn’t involve him chasing some criminal with Sherlock, but John found that he was annoyingly wide awake.
It was rough and graceless, Sherlock’s lips clenched tight around him, the occasional scrape of teeth as Sherlock sucked him fervently. His hand wrapped around John’s shaft, the skin where his lips couldn’t quite reach. He stroked and twisted, the speed of his hand, his mouth, near frenetic. It was a lot, it was immediately too much, it had John shaking almost instantaneously. He brought his hands to Sherlock’s hair, needing touch, needing something, but Sherlock slapped him away, never slowing his pace. John dug his fingers into the grass at his sides, fingernails sinking into dirt. He needed something to root him to this world—he felt in danger of being ripped away. With Sherlock on his knees in front of him, nothing shielded John from the angry winds screaming in from the sea, the full fury of the Atlantic racing straight from the Americas without stopping. The wind beat at John’s face and ripped the breath from his lungs, and Sherlock’s frantic pace on his cock kept John from going after it. John’s mouth opened and shut like a fish on land, gaping and gasping and never getting air. Tears formed in his eyes, leaked onto his cheeks, were ripped away by the wind. He was frozen, pinned to the mountain, stuck in place by the wind, by Sherlock’s mouth. He could feel himself being broken down, blown apart, roots ripping from the earth, stripped away to nothing, bare and dead.
Sherlock had them stop in a pub for an early dinner. “Best eat now,” he said. “We might be rather busy later tonight.”
John looked down at his body, at Sherlock’s body. John’s trousers never made it past his knees. He still had a shoe on. His jumper was half-on his body, bunched around a shoulder. Sherlock’s clothes looked ripped open down the center, his shirt torn open but still on his shoulders, his trousers barely past his hips, his cock tugged rudely from his pants. Sherlock had traces of lubricant and semen around his flies and John, of course, had streaks of their come across his stomach and chest. John giggled, shaking his head.
“I won’t press,” Sherlock said. “And whatever your answer is, I will trust you and will say nothing more on the matter. But please tell me honestly, John—is this what you want?”
“There it is, then,” Mary said, allowing a glimmer of something like sadness to creep into her voice. “Honesty at last.” She sighed, her eyes drifting away from John for the first time since she entered the room. “A valid reason to be clobbered, I suppose.”
“If, within the show, the proper course of action varies with each situation and is dictated by the whims of the host himself,” Sherlock said, tossing the pills into his mouth and swallowing them with ease, “I would argue that finding a true solution to the Monty Hall problem is an impossibility.” He seemed back to normal—his voice low and steady, blue eyes twinkling, mad brain already speeding towards the next problem. John loved him so much he couldn’t see straight.
The moonlight shone down on the space where Sherlock stood, casting him in a dim glow. His skin was pale at the best of times, but in the night it seemed other-worldly—glistening under a sheen of sweat and near-porcelain, scars and all. He spun about madly on the path, twisting in all directions, eyes scanning whatever visible parts of the island they could spy, and John could see every part of him flexing, all muscles firm and tense and ready for the attack. The pale light cut shadows into his skin, carving lines along his slender frame. The flash drive swung and bounced across his chest, the only speck of clothing on him, if one could call it that. He still had the gun clutched in one hand, the muscles of his arms tense, ready to draw and fire at a moment’s notice. The head-lamp dangled from the other hand, still lit but useless, the both of their vision having adjusted to the dark. Sherlock’s eyes were black in the night, his curls a wild tangle on his head. He looked the very definition of madness—standing naked in the middle of the field, face a frenzy, ready to pounce on any sort of danger, rabbit or man, that was so daft as to cross in front of him. He looked insane. He looked absolutely insane.
Sherlock rolled his hips forward, feeling the press of John’s erection through his trousers. John gasped against Sherlock’s mouth, momentarily forgetting how to return his kisses. Sherlock moved his lips to John’s neck, sucking and biting at the warm skin as he ground himself harder against John. Their bodies pressed together but not close enough, somehow not close enough.
John tugged at Sherlock’s hair. He lifted Sherlock’s face into his hands, shifting him up his body until the two were eye-to-eye. John’s face was open, loving.
Behind John, the larger man’s head sank to his chest. His eyes closed. His hands relaxed on the gun. His body went still, his breathing shallow, slowing.
John watched Lestrade walk away on his fake phone call, brows still furrowed. That had been a bit odd, now hadn’t it?
Sherlock’s brain made a play at deductions, but its wheels moved slowly, as if through mud. He could see the disparate bits of John’s face floating in front of him—hooded eyes, pupils dilated, labored breathing, pulse pounding and thudding at John’s neck—but couldn’t make very much out of what it all might mean other that what Sherlock wanted it to mean. He found that he wanted it to mean quite a bit at the moment. His mouth suddenly felt dry.
John saw something flicker over Sherlock’s face, a sort of regret. Sherlock nodded his head firmly and stepped free of John’s grasp. He leapt into the boat in one graceful maneuver and then they were off, cutting along the waves and heading for the mainland. Lucy increased her pacing in the boat, displeased by the sudden movement. John just caught another little bleat from her over the roar of the engine. Sherlock turned to look at John as they left, his coat wrapped around him, hands in his pockets, wind tearing at his curls. John watched him until the boat was a dot on the Sound. Then he turned and started back up the hill.
“So since we so clearly feel nothing for the other,” Sherlock said, “it stands to reason that any development in emotional connection developed during this case can be attributed solely to an influx in neurotransmitters rather than genuine connection.”
“I had individuals who were impressed or infatuated with my talents,” Sherlock said. “But I never had anybody who chose to stay around because of
“This leads me to believe that there is much more stalking involved before the actual murder than I originally thought,” Sherlock said. “The killer likely chooses the victims and then studies their movements, their habits. We should be on the lookout for anything amiss in our immediate environment. We can certainly expect the killer to break into the cottage while we’re away to dismantle security measures.”
“Christ,” John said. His voice was soft with astonishment. Seeing a new being spring into life wasn’t an everyday occurrence. It warranted a fair bit of awe.
Mary’s expression didn’t change. Mycroft only looked angrier. Sherlock tilted his head back towards John.
Today, it was the stupid pink octopus smiling up at him, and John found himself incapable of taking his eyes off the thing. He considered that he might have been lucky that he woke up before Sherlock hit the pavement. That sound his body made when he hit, that sound was usually the worst part of the dreams.
John wished that everybody would stop accusing him of panicking this morning, although he had to admit that Gilly had a point. “Not panicking,” he said. “Just...caught a bit off-guard. That is, we haven’t exactly been dating
“Technically,” Sherlock said, “she didn’t say anything inaccurate. Simplistic, maybe, but not inaccurate.”
“Yes I do,” John said, although he said it so softly he barely heard it himself. His heart was hammering so loudly he wondered if it was shaking the bed. He could barely understand his own reaction to this line of inquiry. John had never considered himself to be a coward. He had fought in a
They were waiting outside a restaurant for a table—Sherlock chose a spot for dinner that, again, was based on number of people inside the restaurant—when John heard somebody calling their names. He glanced up and saw Hugh jogging towards them, large smile on his face. Sherlock wrapped his arm around John in preparation for the encounter, nearly knocking the wind out of him.
John pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes and sighed. It felt as if he learned something he was never meant to know, something he could now never forget. What in the hell would he do when this case was solved and he and Sherlock returned to Baker Street, to their separate rooms, to their normal lives where they were decidedly
“You said we should do public displays, right?” John asked. “Do things that couples do out where the killer could see? Make it obvious we’re together?”
“With a hammer,” John said. “I’m going to beat Mycroft’s meddling little rat brain in with a hammer. It’ll feel lovely.”
John was drenched in sweat. The whole of his body felt on fire, throbbing, needing. His fists had white-knuckled grips on the blankets and he was shaking, shaking so hard from the effort of keeping still that he was sure the mattress would start creaking under him soon.
John took a deep, measured breath, the kind his therapist would have been proud of. He felt his teeth grind together. He was thankful he didn’t have the whiskey glass in his hands anymore—he might have shattered it.
“I’m a consulting detective,” he says. “People find their way to my doorstep when they’ve got a puzzle they can’t solve. More often than not, it’s Scotland Yard, but sometimes it’s the general population as well.”
Sherlock’s hand was warm against John’s. He still had a hand around John’s shoulder, but he seemed to be holding him close rather than holding him up. “I wanted to see you,” he said. His eyes flickered to the ground, sheepish. “Today.”
Mary sighed. Her eyes wavered between him and the ground. Her face still held traces of the unfamiliar sharpness John witnessed as she crouched behind the table with her weapon drawn, but she was starting to fade back into the Mary that John had once known—or rather, thought he knew. She allowed a bit of her exterior to crumble. She looked tired. “I imagine you’ll want an explanation,” she said.
John glanced at the beehive, then back to Sherlock. Sherlock’s face was still tipped to the ground. He looked as if he couldn’t bear seeing the tree for a moment longer.
“Okay,” John said. “Here. Man says his dog has been—” John hung his head, not even bothering to finish his sentence. “Fine. You’re right. These are all rubbish.”
Sherlock felt John’s breathing quicken. Last night had been particularly lovely. Rosie had gone down early and the two tumbled into bed shortly after, a mess of hands and mouths. Sherlock had taken his time, running his tongue over every bit of John’s body, working him open with his fingers, ignoring each one of John’s whispered demands to fuck him until he seemed frantic with need. When Sherlock finally slipped inside, John was wild and open and craving, wrapping himself tightly around Sherlock and moving against him with an urgency that seemed a matter of life or death. Sherlock meant to go slowly even then, but John was wrecked and pleading and Sherlock’s self-control could only be expected to stretch so far. He fucked John so hard the both of them forgot how to breathe, and his hand hardly wrapped around John’s cock before John was convulsing underneath him, barely able to keep himself from screaming. Sherlock followed, wrenched into oblivion by John’s shuddering body. They were both slick, sloppy messes after, hair matted with sweat and panting for air, seeing stars.
Sherlock ran a hand across John’s back and kissed him just behind his ear and it seemed as if he understood.
It was alright in the end because, if he was being honest with himself, this wasn’t a half-bad way to go. Off on some adventure. Trying to save the city, do something worthwhile for a change. With Sherlock. That last bit seemed particularly important. John figured that if he could pick a way to die, any way to die at all, he would say it didn’t really matter, so long as it was by Sherlock’s side. In that sense, John figured that being blown to bits by a bomb today was the perfect way to die. He closed his eyes.
The sun had set while they were in the pub, and the town settled into darkness. Stars glittered in the night sky, and the lights from the shops shone in yellows and reds, casting a glow on the pavement. Sherlock’s skin looked nearly golden, dotted with little rainbow specks from the lights. His eyes were dark and his hair was wild and he looked the nearest thing to happy he had all day and John knew that this was as close as the two of them would ever get. John wasn’t meant to have Sherlock, no matter how he wanted him; this little sham of theirs would be all he would ever have of the man and it was ending soon. Their partnership was ending soon as well, for all he knew, and John felt it best to savor the moment.
John found himself to be more than a little thrown off-kilter by the events of the day. He knew it was all pretend, all in the name of luring a serial killer. He reminded himself once more of Sherlock’s assertions about neurochemicals reacting to physical touch and making one believe they are feeling something they really aren’t. He reminded himself of Gilly. None of it, however, seemed to do much for what he was very afraid was starting to stir within himself.
He heaved himself to his feet and hurled himself forward on the boat, letting the hopping momentum of his bound ankles send him flying at the man. He had no plan. Nothing close to a plan. Nothing was in his head except
“I want you in pieces,” Sherlock said, “because of me.” He jerked John forward once more, fingers slipping into the cleft of John’s arse, grazing against his hole. John made a sound he barely recognized. He started moving his hips against Sherlock, Sherlock’s hand guiding him roughly along.
Sherlock pulled back from him but remained close, his hand still resting on John’s cheek. John forced himself to reopen his eyes. With his study in camera angles, Sherlock knew his face was hidden and allowed bits of himself to return to his expression, resulting in a devastating mix of loving-boyfriend and quintessential-Sherlock that was difficult to withstand.
John shifted the acknowledgement of service form to the front of the pile. This form was even simpler. Confirm the identity of the respondent. Indicate whether or not the respondent wishes to defend the case. Sign and date. John found a pen and tapped it against the table. It all seemed remarkably easy.
in John’s response in favor of superficial conversation. John was grateful; Sherlock would never have let that go. “Anyway. How’s the missus?”
“No,” you say. You’re having a bit of a difficult time catching your breath. “It’s not just that. It’s not that simple.”
“No promises,” Sherlock said, emerging from the bedroom. In under a minute, he had managed to transform himself from his between-cases uniform of unwashed pyjamas and mussed hair to a sleek, tailored suit. He looked as if he had been professionally styled just on the off-chance a gaggle of reporters would need to talk to him, and John wondered if he might actually be a superhero. Regardless, John thought, he would have to shag him later.
The door flew open and Sherlock burst inside. “John,” he called, ”we’re going into town immediately.”
John pressed his eyes closed. He sighed. He rubbed at the bridge of his nose. “If Mrs. Hudson knew about this,” he said, “she would bloody faint from joy.”
Sherlock waved away Plan 2. Plan 2 was a fat, black fly whining insistently around his head that he would love to see splattered in the palm of his hand. Unfortunately, he was never quite fast enough to strike it. It droned on, undeterred. It made Plan 17 seem even more appealing.
that’s part relief and part joy, the thrill of figuring out the answer to a riddle that’s stumped you for years, the one you thought didn’t have a solution. The raven and the writing desk.
A corpse had been discovered in a skip that was missing all but one of its organs—its gallbladder, inexplicably, remained—and Sherlock finally decided that the case was worthy of his attention. He managed to locate an abandoned building at the outskirts of town that he claimed was a site out of which the black market surgeon used to operate. He insisted that he and John investigate the building for any leftover clues to the surgeon’s whereabouts. As it turned out, the building was very much still in use by the surgeon. As it turned out, it wasn’t just the one surgeon but rather a whole gang. And as it turned out, the surgical gang was more than a little perturbed to find Sherlock and John poking around their building. There had been a skirmish, a few shots fired, a brief chase, and now Sherlock and John were hiding out in a storage closet.
After a while, she mentioned Sherlock. “The nurses told me you lost someone close to you,” she said. “Said he killed himself in front of you.”
“Christ,” John said. He didn’t yet release his grip on Sherlock’s arm. He was not prepared to let go.
“Okay,” Sherlock said. He didn’t seem to know what to do from that point on. One of the pots behind him started smoking menacingly.
“Sherlock,” John whispered, his voice foreign, and Sherlock pulled back slightly, staring at John with dark, heavy-lidded eyes. Sherlock looked wrecked—flushed and sweating and wanting—and John nearly came in his trousers at the very sight of him. This was real. This had to be real.
See what I did there, John? With the exclamation point? Your readers won’t even know you didn’t author this one.”
Sherlock held himself just above John for a moment longer, his cock still in his hand, panting and flushed as the last drops of come dribbled onto John’s stomach. Then he collapsed at John’s side, nose buried in John’s neck, a leg draped over John’s.
“I get carried away,” Sherlock said. “I get… I know how I get, John. I know how I am. I know how it can be too much.” He wrung his hands together, twiddling with his own fingers. “Most people can’t bear it,” he said. “Not for long. They need a shield. They need to leave.”
“They’re dead,” Sherlock said, lifting his forehead from John’s. He pushed John’s hair away from his face with a hand that was still shaking. “The both of them.”
John rolled his hips again, a bit harder this time. He felt his cock slide along Sherlock’s groin, nudging against Sherlock’s erection through their trousers. Sherlock’s head fell to John’s neck again and John could feel him gasp. John’s heart was thundering in his chest, expecting at any moment for Sherlock to push him away, to tell him he misinterpreted the situation. John would stop then, but at the moment stopping was the absolute last thing he wanted to do. He set a slow, grinding pace against Sherlock, reveling in each hitch he drew from Sherlock’s breath.
He hums. He wraps his arms around you tighter. He’s holding you properly now, just like you wanted. “Perhaps,” he says. “Regardless. Whatever I am, you are as well.”
” he pointed to a picture of the man in a large group of people, seemingly after a football game, “do you see this woman right here?” He pointed to a woman on the other side of the crowd.
John looked down at Sherlock’s supine body. “Wouldn’t it be more productive if you were actually looking at the sheep?”
Sherlock gripped at John’s hair, stilling him, pulling his head back until John’s gaze met his. John’s eyes were glassy. Saliva dripped down his chin.
“Not worried,” Sherlock said, wiping his face free of any emotion. “It’s a matter of convenience, really. If Will does anything to harm my blogger, I’ll be forced to maim him quite viciously. It’s in everyone’s best interest that we avoid that as best we can.”
To his surprise, Sherlock was there. He looked healthy, like he had before any of this had started. He continued to play on the violin, not paying attention to John as he did, as usual.
"Well, slow down there. Don't you want to know what I need help with first?" He paused, then frowned. "I see. Fine."
"You know, John," the Consulting Detective clasped his hands under his chin, "If you know so much about the future that would have occurred if you hadn't blown the case... What became of us?"
"What...?" Lestrade stopped. "N-... No, no, I'm... I'm going out there." Regardless of the comment, the inspector left.
"There is a chance that in court, he might be found not guilty if he can convince them he doesn't remember doing it..."
"I want to go home..." The pathetic way this was said was so un-Sherlock, and yet, there it was, slipping through his lips.
"Whatever helps you sleep better at night. Wish you were here. Sherlock seems to have removed the gag around his mouth somehow, and he's only shouting about you. Where's John this, what did you do you to John that. Yaawn. Maybe I should shut him up."
"I sent Donovan to track him down. In his current state, he can't have gone far yet... but I can't believe it! He picked the lock on his handcuffs and just... left! He's too clever and stubborn for his own good."
"Hey, hey, at least Sherlock isn't dead, right? I'm just forcing him to get his hands dirty for me. Too bad you wouldn't let him kill his older brother. I would've loved to have seen his reaction. - JMx"
The taller man looked rather distressed, and he subconsciously pulled at his dark, curly hair, continuing to moan and groan.
The Consulting Detective again subconsciously tugged at the handcuffs connecting his arm to the bedframe.
Sherlock broke the kiss and stroked John's hair. "Get some rest, John... I won't let anything bad happen to you ever again, I promise..."
It wasn't impossible that Sherlock staged his suicide. Therefore, by his logic, it had to be true... right?
"This whole mess began because you wanted to protect me and look at what happened to you because of it. I'm too weak to even help my greatest friend when he needs me the most."
There was a brief shuffle and a few murmurs, and then Sherlock's voice, cold and distant sounding, said, "Hello?"
Sherlock stopped laughing when he heard John's voice. Slowly, he stepped out of the bathroom with a bloody hand from punching the mirror. "John..."
Over the phone, John could hear a loud explosion. The fact that the call remained unaffected implied that Mycroft was likely uninjured.
Sherlock, not noticing, stood and limped towards a door across the room from John. The limp was not doing any good in helping hide much.
"She means nothing to me. What scares me is that the 'someone' in question could've been you if we hadn't gone to see her."
"Perhaps the cipher says. Give me a minute on this, John; I think I vaguely recognize the cipher." He thought for a minute, before loudly exclaiming "Oh! This character is an S! This is Pigpen Cipher! It says, 'Sh'-..." Sherlock trailed off, his face going blank as he stared at the bloody message on the wall with wide eyes.
She softly whimpered as tears overflowed in her eyes. "Sherlock?!" he heard John yell from behind him; seeing the whole thing.
The Consulting Detective froze for a moment before stepping out of the apartment, quietly closing the door behind himself.
Sherlock pantomimed playing a violin for him, but soon stopped, as he hadn't yet fully remembered his passion for playing the violin.
She was perfect for him; witty, sarcastic, and she gave him a good kick in the rear whenever he needed it. Plus, he thought she was beautiful. For him, she was truly a complete package.
“You’re still concerned with Will?” John asked, eyes widening. “We have an opportunity to bring down the Taibhses.”
“That could have been much more tedious,” he says. “I was excused from having to stick around and give my statement tonight due to my…” he gestures towards his throat, “
“Yeah,” you say. “I suppose I did.” The two of you carry on looking at each other for what feels like the longest moment of your life, and you have no idea how you’ve gotten so lost so quickly.
Sherlock nodded in greeting and Hugh sidled up next to their table, grinning madly. With him was a woman who looked rather like him, just shorter and with a bit more hair. She was grinning madly as well.
John could feel the bed growing hot with Sherlock just behind him, could smell Sherlock as his body took up space in the room—the traces of shampoo and sweat and firewood. He could feel the unsteady puffs of Sherlock’s breaths just tickling at the back of his neck. The mattress shifted once more. There was a rustle of covers. Something warm hovered just over the skin of John’s shoulder blade. A hand—millimeters above skin, shaking but careful. Not touching.
“From what I can tell,” Sherlock said, “Maggie and Lucy’s flat isn’t in the most respectable of neighborhoods, and I’d like to verify that they’ve received the money before we leave.”
Sherlock stumbled forward slightly as John’s hand tugged back into his pockets. He felt a bit like he was being searched by the police. He knew the police. “A best man—“
“Oh,” John said. Now that he was looking around, he could see that there weren’t any other trees on the island. The grass grew fairly well, and there were those little dots of thin flowers, but not another tree to be seen.
Sherlock’s arms were nearly crushing John’s chest. His fingers dug into John’s skin, latched on tight to John’s hand. He was shaking again, the faintest tremble. “I can’t even keep you in my dreams,” he said. “I can’t stop you leaving.”
, that warm scent of garlic and salt that he’d never even realized reminded him of Sherlock until he was practically being punched in the gut with it. He felt a burning start up deep inside him and had a strong urge to flee the place, knocking chairs aside as he darted into the street. He could apologize to Angelo later, likely over a phone call.
