‘I do not know entirely: it is difficult to explain. You may rule out every mention of some wretched young woman who destroys herself because a man has had his way with her and she has found herself with child, for one thing, or any female who is of the impecunious classes. Any man, also, I suppose, although that is harder to determine. There are impecunious men enough of good status, in poverty because of gambling debts, or ill-made business deals. It is not that.’
‘He has been, since the moment we met, kind and genial to me. Not all men would be so welcoming to a bastard half-brother, and for that I revere him beyond expression and will always call myself his debtor. His generosity is also - well, he would share everything with me if I would allow, it, which I will not, of course, since I have no rightful claim on anything belonging to his father. And I will take nothing of my mother’s for she hated me to the end.’
Viennese personalities who are mentioned were all there at the time of Holmes and Watson’s visit. We may find out more about this.
‘A man. Of course.’ Lestrade looked at Watson, and then at me, his gaze coolly assessing. ‘Of course. It was aimed at more than Dr Watson: well, I am not surprised. If you could be made the subject of the common bounce, then Mr Holmes might be – implicated, let us say, since you share rooms.’
It was no surprise to me to learn that the man was the director of a bank: his dress, his demeanour, and the financial papers that had been thrust loosely – again evidence of his unusual perturbation – into his coat pocket, made his occupation quite clear; moreover the mud on his shoes had that peculiarly oleaginous quality that I associated with Threadneedle Street. When he introduced himself as a banker, by name Alexander Holder, I was immediately able to place him as the senior partner of a well known institution of impeccable honesty. His story of the beryl coronet that had been offered to him by a noble family as security for a loan of fifty thousand, taken home for safety, and apparently stolen by his son I found

‘And the doctor? Will you tell him?’
One final, exquisite beat, one thrust of the conductor’s baton, and the music ended softly, plaintive in sated chords, all passion spent. Watson bowed his head, his tears falling. I flicked surreptitiously at my wet eyelids, and gave him my handkerchief. After a moment, I felt his hand steal into mine, press it and I turned my grip to enclose his.
‘I shall reserve judgement until I have seen the young baronet. Tell me, Watson, if I were to remain here to tie up the threads of that young idiot’s diplomatic blunder, would you be prepared to play bodyguard in Devon if I asked you? For I agree with you in one respect: that a gigantic and supernatural hound roams the moors seeking whom it may devour and frightening nervous members of the aristocracy to death is, as you proclaimed it to be, poppycock. The original story, or legend, is I have no doubt, well attested: there will be a kernel of truth in it, with many syncretic addenda according to the superstitions of the native folk. But it is a fact that there was a death, and so when one looks at the facts in the case, one must, as always where there is a death, ask “cui bono”: to whom the benefit. The death is a fact; the inheritance is a fact, and since it is the love of money that is the root of all evil, I have no doubt that where the money is, there is evil also, even if it is by no means supernatural. And the evil that has killed one man may well kill two.’
‘I do.’ He sighed. ‘Sherlock, I would that you would endeavour not to hate my father so much. Or our mother. They died because of what she did, it is true, but she was very ill, and – not herself.’
He had already caught my drift. 'Three to swear against one? That he had followed, and killed?'
‘Oh, you cannot buy me. I am sea-green incorruptible, my dear: I have no price. And besides, you have hindered me in my course, you pursue my myrmidons, and hamper my plans: you are an inconvenience, and it pleases me to thwart you in my turn. Moreover, you cannot buy the Colonel: his hatred of your meek little doctor is inveterate, and sooner or later he will, I fear, slip my choke-chain: he is savage, that one, a wolf-dog of bad breed and bad character as all such miscegenate rogues are. No, you cannot buy me. And besides, I am enjoying our little game too much to want to give it up: I have a hold over you - what an inconvenient thing a heart is, is it not, Mr Holmes - and while you seek to expose me, and to bring down the edifice I have been at pains to construct - and even now you do not know why I construct it, do you? - I will not willingly give up that hold.’
He returned my clasp. ‘Well, we are equals then. I would never seek to master you: I am your soldier, but never your Captain.’
‘But he has not, in fact, put any cases your way?’
I wept in my dreams, for I dreamed you abandoned me. I woke, and wept long and bitterly.
Cumberbatch. At the time when Holmes was recovering from the cholera in Angora, one Henry Arnold Cumberbatch, great grandfather of Benedict, was posted to that legation as the envoy in charge. Yes, really, I promise you that is true: I looked at the Diplomatic List.
'I will try to look after myself as you would have me do.’ I reached up to touch his cheek. 'I do not find this easy to say. I am a selfish man, and you are right, my pride and my fear both resent control. But you are dearer to me than anything on this earth, dearer than any hope, any fortune. My heart is not as great as yours, my Pythias. But such as it is, it is wholly yours, for weal or woe.’
‘You do not like me to take them, John, and you blame yourself so. But I do not believe I could have succeeded without: it was so complex an affair - telegrams here and there, and in three languages – and papers missing and sold, and discovered, and it was so important for the country. For us. For our credit, against Moriarty. So I did not tell you, for fear that you might bid me stop.’
‘I think the work is somewhat derivative, I am sorry to say,’ I glanced at Watson, whose face, for some reason, had become completely expressionless, ‘although admirably performed. But you give me too much credit, Professor: I am no expert at the violin, but a mere amateur. I thank you for the invitation, however, despite your somewhat unorthodox way of delivering it, since it has enabled us to meet. It has been some time since we last encountered each other – also at a concert, I recall. I had no idea that you were a such a follower of the divine Euterpe.’
‘Well – one does not, I believe. Men cannot be beautiful, Watson.’
'No.' He kissed my forehead again. 'It is yourself you feel you fail, never me. And I do not condemn you, because I do not have your demons, Sherlock. Remember Rabbie Burns? I said this to you before, I recall, when we discussed your use of morphine, oh, long ago now. When we were investigating that wretched man, Lamson. "Then gently scan your brother man, still gentler sister woman; tho' they may gang a kennin wrang, to step aside is human . . ." You are human, that is all. Can you go on?'

'Does it make you 'a wife’ to be cherished? We do not play those games, I thought, as Ulrichs and Kertbeny indicate some other Uranians - other inverts - do, taking the male or female rôle.’ His calm acceptance - his naming of himself, and indeed, me, as 'invert' shocked me. I had known myself an invert since my early years, but had named myself so to another, never: he, new come to his desire for a man, was far more able to accept it than I, it seemed. But as usual when a matter of emotion was in play, he saw straight to the heart of it. 'Holmes - Sherlock - I am yours, heart and soul. Our lips have touched, and if your heart beat faster, if your body wanted more, then surely so did mine. If we have gone no further, it is for want of safety, want of opportunity, and because, as I have told you, I will not - share - with you while your mind is clouded by your drugs - ’
‘It does.’ He took both my hands, and moved me so we sat face to face, our fingers entwined. ‘And this is why, my dear Sherlock, any man now who loves another must think carefully about what he will do. About what danger he puts his lover in, and what might come to him if he did. Even with all love and trust, it must be thought on.’
Watson was really quite incorrigible over the dynamite. Sugar of lead is lead acetate, a retardant that stops the gunpowder exploding too fast.
‘Do not delay any further, but give me my coffee and tell me about maggots.’
'You are severe, Watson! Yet I do not think it is so with them, but a partnership of equals, that rare and precious thing. I shall never underestimate a woman again: she, and she only will be the model of her sex for me.'
The arrival of breakfast interrupted us, and I made sure that Watson’s plate was well supplied with kedgeree and his coffee cup filled before I spoke. I wanted him to stay with me – would have paid almost any price for him to stay – but I knew that I had to tread carefully with so proud a man.
‘Yes,’ I agreed. I did not wish to think about childhood. I turned off the burner, and wiped my hands, moved to the corner, picked up my violin. ‘Would you be averse to some music, Watson? I confess I am melancholy today: this endless rain and wind is tedious in the extreme.’
'What other could Miss Doran - Mrs Moulton as we should properly call her -  do when she saw the husband she had thought long dead confronting her in the moment of her contracting a second marriage? She could not, in front of all those people, make a public outcry. Francis Hay Moulton had a prior claim on her: she recognised that. The marriage she had contracted with Lord St Simon was null and void, because it was bigamous, in any case. The only mistake she made was to abscond in secrecy, and I believe she only did that because she could not think what else to do. She was, once I tracked her down, amenable to persuasion that she could not allow St Simon to go in ignorance all his days. At least now he may have that unlucky ceremony annulled and be free to - '
‘Holmes,’ he said, after we had been sitting together an hour or so. He had bound my hand loosely, promising to bathe it again for me later, and his touch had lulled me into such drowsy content that I was happy to rest against him. ‘How long have you been engaged upon this experiment?’
I went on, more cautiously now. ‘Your brother took to drink, as we discussed. He would not have done so had he been happy; therefore he was not happy. Perhaps he disappointed as a son, or was disappointed. Often sons and fathers – there can be problems. He did not go into the army like you, but into business, and he struggled to succeed. You, on the contrary, went into the army. Your father was an army man, in a Northern regiment?’
go?’ he corrected me. ‘If you will be kind enough to accompany me, my dear Holmes, I should like to go this Thursday next, and to return the fortnight following. Will the plan suit you? A day more or less makes no matter if it is not convenient to travel on that one.’
‘Sometimes it is you who need the doctoring,’ I finished for him. ‘I am honoured that it is to me you turn, that I can heal you. The circumstances of your life have taught you to despond: I see that, and I understand why it is so. But the circumstances of mine have taught me to hope, and I say, my dear John, that you must never give up hope. Remember what Monte Cristo said to Maximilien in his despair, and do not give up hope.’
He pursed his lips and nodded, considering. ‘You did well: I see now why you acted thus. I incline to think it is some lunatic who is committing the murders of these wretched women, rather than Professor Moriarty instigating them, but Moriarty is certainly using them. Lestrade is worried: he came to see me.’
‘Return to me,’ he said, his voice soft. ‘I need a charm, Sherlock, to wile you from the abyss into which you fall at times. I shudder, indeed, to see how far you go into its depths, imagining myself calling for you to no avail, and you lost, never to return to me. What chasm, what deep have you plumbed this time?’
I do look forward to Mr H A Cumberbatch arriving at Angora. He will be there in a month or so, as will Holmes.
The Rainham case, and the case of Elizabeth Jackson, were known to the police of the time as “the Thames Torso murders”. The murderer was never discovered. The following year, 1888, would be the year of the Jack the Ripper killings. Although the killings were similar - females, killed and dismembered - the Ripper murderer displayed female reproductive organs in a way the Thames Torso murderer did not, and the police believed that the perpetrators were different. For any person who has ever had a baby, yes, it's that Mr Braxton Hicks, the man who named the contractions of false labour
After my sad revelation, Watson and I went on quietly together for a few months. I endeavoured to diminish my morphia, tapering it off by little and little, but it proved difficult. On my suggestion, Watson began to administer my decreasing nightly dose to me, and then to lock away the drug and the syringe. It was a strangely intimate event: I bared my arm, he wiped my skin with alcohol, drew up the solution and showed me the amount, raised a vein and performed the injection with neat-handed ease. Afterwards, he would wipe my arm again before drawing the sleeve of my shirt or nightgown down and bidding me goodnight. There was an absent-minded affectionateness in his look when he did so; a soft, sure familiarity. I cherished the warmth of him near me, the scent of his skin, the touch of his strong, kind fingers. When he concentrated on the injection I could gaze my fill on him, learning him a piece at a time. The whorls of his ear, the way the muscles corded in his neck, the faint lines at the corner of his eye – they fascinated me to the point of obsession. I would never have enough of him. I needed to breathe him in as I needed air: without him I suffocated, breathless, dying.
‘And what if the thunderbolt never strikes?’
The European Secretary bowed.
Holmes and Watson have been reading (as well as Monte Cristo) the Irish playwright, John Banim’s 1821 play Damon and Pythias, about one of the most celebrated homoerotic couples of Classical history. Their friendship was seen as a model for how two men should support and cherish each other. Despite both, as would have been a matter of course in Ancient Greece, being married, their primary emotional relationships is with each other.
‘And yet – John, is this forbidden? Unnatural?’
I hastened to my desk and scrambled for my pocket book, removing a quantity of sovereigns and pressing them into her hands, for I heard Watson’s step on the stair. ‘Blue, Mrs Hudson,’ I murmured hastily, since it would never do to be caught conspiring with my landlady, ‘I am sure that your late husband’s coat was a very dark blue, was it not? And – forgive me - he dressed above his station, perhaps?’
*****
He smiled, and then grimaced. 'That is all thanks to you, Holmes, and I am grateful. Oh, oh, I know what I want for this leg, and I know what I may not have, too. I shall be laid up all the rest of the day and tomorrow if I can get no relief from the pain.'
He swallowed his coffee in two great draughts, returned the cup, pressed my hand tenderly again and was gone, throwing a parting admonition at Lestrade to 'not tarry, but be brief in explanation: he would be with us again directly.'
you who pretend to understand everything, even the hidden sources of knowledge - and who play, or pretend to play at being Providence, and have no power - railing at him thus for not having saved his beloved – and he tells Morrel in this extremity that he has not only the power but the courage to prevent him from dying, and withal the right . . . It is a bold claim to make to a man so racked with torment. A bold claim. I do not know whether I would dare to make it to one so desperate. And Morrel rejects it: he tells the Count, his friend who has cared for and supported him ‘you are hateful in my eyes.’’
‘He is of modest means, if he is a professor at the University, yet he lives in an extremely well-appointed house in Leicester Square. It is an interesting house, that one, Watson. Are you aware that it once had two doors?’
‘No.’ He looked away. ‘No, there should not be, so close as we are. Holmes . . . Sherlock . . . do you . . . do you mind?’
The rooms in Baker Street were light and airy, with wide windows affording an excellent view of the street. I had wanted him to take the bedchamber on the same level as the drawing room, having watched him halt upstairs, and arrive with his brow tightened with pain. He had refused, mouth shutting like a steel trap.
. ‘You, I perceive, are in rather more promising case. That very elegant signet ring you wear was not father’s I think.’
It was no wonder, I thought as Watson recounted his school days to me, that he, struggling to put himself through Bart's, and make a name for himself in the army, should almost have forgotten the school friend who, his school days behind him, had advanced through Cambridge, then rapidly in rank and favour at the Foreign Office under the benign, but severe, tutelage of his uncle, Lord Holdhurst, until a moment's inattention and a need for coffee had beguiled him to an unlikely ruin.
He crossed the room in a rush, and his grip on my hands was painful in its intensity.
‘Flinches! Are you implying that he beats her, abuses her? Heavens, Watson, why did you say nothing? We cannot leave the girl there if that is so: let us instantly return and rescue her!’
It had taken him some time to find the man's address, Watson explained, and at one point he had had to leave the cab, and prospect the tangled alleys until he found a guide: he did find one, however, in Farrant Street, where a poor woman of the night to whom he had spoken, gave him directions. He had thanked her, and given her money before returning to the cab to collect his patient's spouse..
He turned away, staring out of the window.
‘What would you have me play?’ I asked, to change his painful train of thought.  ‘Shall it be Mendelssohn again?’ He loved the sweet, sympathetic cadences of the Lieder, stroking a picture into his mind of sun- or candle-lit days of long ago. ‘Or something popular perhaps?’ I bowed a bright snatch of music. ‘Poor, wand’ring one, though thou hast surely strayed, take heart of grace.’ I said softly, thinking to coax him into humour with Sullivan’s airs and Gilbert’s lyrics, but he shook his head, and his eyes were over-bright.
He smiled. ‘Indeed I am. But the fever broke last night, in a fine drenching sweat. Doctor Watson said she will do now, if we can get her strength up again. I do not believe he has had his clothes off these eight and forty hours, Mr Holmes, nor has that kind little girl of yours neither. And your Mrs Hudson has been in and out I do not know how many times a day with food for the children, and nourishing soup for poor Annie. I do not know what I have done to be blessed with such kind friends,’ and the tears stood in his eyes as he spoke. ‘I know I shall go a thankful man all my days for it. The children are so young: my oldest, Tom, but thirteen, and little Nan only three: it is no age to lose a mother, and so caring a mother too. Well, that is the second time in these two years my poor wife has miscarried and there will be no more of it. I have my quiverful, as the Good Book has it, but there will be no more: I am not a beast to kill her with more childbearing. Indeed I would have stopped sooner, but she does dearly love her babies, for all that she is sometimes sharp with them. And even that is better now that she has not to worry and fret over poor Polly, and has your Janey’s Jack to help her with the rough work. Why, she has been growing quite young and merry again, quite like the pretty girl I courted those many years ago. I should dearly like to keep her so, now I am let to keep her when I thought I might not.’
I should have known better than to think that Watson would not notice my absences, however. Whatever he lacked as a detective – although he was more observant than many, to give him his due – I could not deceive him in some respects. I arrived home one evening about a week after our evil night to find him dressed, very much the soldier, and sitting at his desk, rather than reclining on the sofa in robe and slippers. I was about to make a hasty excuse, and retreat to my own room, when he raised his head from the letter he was writing and commanded me to remain. I uttered some excuse, feeling unaccountably flustered, but somehow, before I knew where I was, I was sitting in my chair by the fire, and he across from me.
I cast a glance at Watson, wondering how he would respond to this, and he shook his head at me. ‘The army, Holmes. And I’ve seen lads of that ilk in the hospital. They live precarious lives, hard lives. Go on, Johnson.’
‘I have,’ I replied. He thought me temperate and clean, never suspecting how intimately I knew the dependence to which he referred. ‘I am sorry for it, Watson. Do not seclude yourself; it would make me uncomfortable. Rather we must endeavour to use other means to reduce your discomfort. There is – have you heard of, or experienced, the Turkish bath? The heat is powerful to relax tight muscles and relieve pain. I can recommend it, and would be pleased to accompany you.’
– and was used to run, and skip, play ball, or battledore and shuttlecock, and ride her pony to hounds like any other child, There was never any indication of temper, only that as she grew older, she became very shy in company, a little withdrawn.’
'I am sure you wonder why I am here, Mr Holmes.' Nancy Barclay's face was still wan, and there were shadows under her eyes. One could imagine the young girl who had inspired such possessive love in two men, but there were few traces left of her youth as proof of it, for she looked worn and weary, and older than the measure of her years.
I swallowed hard.
‘And will you be?’ Watson asked me, as we walked back in the early hours to the Crown Inn, leaving Miss Stoner with the housekeeper, and her betrothed, Armitage, a rather ineffectual young man who had fretted and fussed around her while she dealt competently with the local police. ‘Pleased to hear of their marriage, Holmes?’
‘And you have cut your hand, give that here to me, and wash yourself: I will find gauze and plaster and bind it for you. You must forgive me in your turn: my jest was ill-timed. This afternoon we will go to the Turkish bath, and have your evil mood sweated and pummelled out of you.’

‘Of course - he did not “tiptoe”, as Dr Mortimer said, but he was running: the weight was on the ball of the foot and the impression in soft ground would be the same.’
‘England would be better leaving Ireland to herself, for one thing. But failing that exceptionally unlikely event coming to pass, given that it is undoubtedly true that Cornwall, and possibly others connected with the English establishment in Ireland have been committing at least what is reprobated as indecency, if not sodomy, with a complete lack of discretion, and also given that there will undoubtedly be evidence to that effect somewhere, it would be far better if any libellous accusations in O’Brien’s scandal sheet were completely ignored. But I daresay they will not be: to ignore the accusation is to assent by silence to its truth. The battle must be fought, even if the cause is lost from the beginning. Once a man’s name is stained by these accusations, it is hard to be seen as spotless. Even if acquitted, something still lingers, and his reputation is never the same again.’
‘Does it not on you? It appeared to me that you shared my distress at the libel trial.’
‘I will not go without Watson; he is quite invaluable to me.’
‘I know,’ he said then, surprising me. ‘I see it in you, Holmes. There were chaps like you in the army, just such restive, nervous types: thoroughbred horses, eager for the race, willing and fiery, but the devil to drive or ride. And then there were chaps like me,’ he went on, rising to his feet, and stretching. ‘We are the workhorses of this world, are we not, steady at the plough? But that,’ he went on, and then he broke off, and strolled to the window. I narrowed my eyes, observing. His nonchalance was affected, a cover for some deep feeling; I was sure of it. ‘But that is not what I wished to say. Yesterday, we spoke of my return to the army.’
'Moriarty! That vile man, that criminal, as famous among crooks as—'
The grog arrived, and I gave it to him. ‘You were out so early, old man,’ I said. I tried for nonchalance, but I am sure my voice shook dreadfully. ‘I was anxious about you in this beastly weather.’ For the stifling heat of a few days previously was breaking, and the wind was rising. ‘It will storm tonight: I did not want you caught out in it.’
‘As ye know, gentlemen, I’m a poor Catholic lad, Dublin born, and bred, unlike me rich friend Mally here. And since me father couldn’t provide for me, I had to do the best I could. An’ that was where me friend Martin came in . . .’
We are approaching the end of the story. There will be a happy ending, don't worry.
‘Thank you, my dear Holmes. I meant to buy tobacco,’ he said, riffling through his pockets and taking his pouch out, ‘this is empty - but the summer rain is so heavy I simply came straight home. No, she is no better. It is tubercular disease of the hip, and that does not cure easily. Poor little girl, it is no wonder she is fretful and peevish: she is worn to a thread-paper with pain from the cold abscesses in the bone, and the hip is beginning to abduct which will add spinal problems to her woes. Lestrade is very patient and gentle with her, but of course he is not home often. I would like to get her into the Alexandra Hospital for hip disease in children, but it is so hard to get a bed. I have spoken with Howard Marsh, the Director – I know him from Barts of course, since he works there also – but they are not flush with money at the moment. A bed’s space might be found with ease, but the endowment for nursing that goes with it is another matter. She might need it for a year or more, and then a convalescent home afterwards for a few months.’
*****
We parted at ten, he with a bright face and buoyant step, and I with an ache in my heart. If I were not a man, my treacherous mind whispered to me . . . if I were not a man, or if he were a man such as I, we might have had all of this and more. I could have smiled with my heart in my eyes, not dipped my gaze lest I betray myself. His hand might have rested on mine, or my head bowed to his kind shoulder as we sat close. Our mouths might have met, gently, caressing, our bodies touched, and then, ah then, were I not a man, there might have been fiercer, sweeter joys, the joys I knew of only from Ovid and Juvenal, and Catullus . . . joys I had never thought to want. Joys I had despised.
‘The approaching season of goodwill appears to have affected even criminals,’ I replied, and saw him raise his eyebrows at my morose tone. ‘Neither Lestrade nor Gregson has been next or nigh me for a se’nnight, I swear. There is a sore dearth of work, and I am weary of idleness. Let us venture further afield today, Watson, and see what we come across. Perhaps we will chance upon a crime, if one does not come by chance to us. Will you come?’
We did not speak much. Once on the hill, he drew breath deep into his lungs, straightened his shoulders, and set off across the grass, leaving me to watch him and wonder. He could not yet walk without a limp (I deduced from the irregularity in his gait that whatever afflicted him must have injured his quadriceps, for he had limited motion in the right knee, exactly as I had observed in the case of the cricketer whom I had cleared of a murder charge on the basis of his irregular footstep) but he went as if his life depended on it. I took a different route, to give him the space he needed, and we met under an oak near the summit. His eyes had been wet, I am sure, but as I joined him, he was smiling.
I managed a laugh. ‘ So you do admit my undoubted powers?’
Snippets of quotes, for those who like to hunt them, from: Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion, Mansfield Park, Midsummer Night's Dream, Bleak House and a paraphrase from Stoppard's 'The Invention of Love', a play about A E Housman's unrequited love for Moses Jackson.
'We can surmise that he seeks power: to be able to control men. Mycroft believes that he aims higher, at the government itself.'
And he was gone, with a brush of his hand over my shoulder, and his halting step on the stair. I sat desolate amid the remains of our dinner.
At this point in the 1893 section, it is autumn, and Holmes is still travelling from Tabreez to his destination in Turkey, the British Legation at Angora. The retrospective covers most of 1887.
I poured for him. 'This and no more, John: I must have you sober. Come, let me hold you, my dear fellow. Any violent murder sears the soul, and this was, by your account, an atrocity: it is no wonder it has turned you sick.'
“The bloody hell I do…I know your face.  Seen it every day for months. He lost his bloody mind over it…over you.  Talks to you all the time, just like your frekin in the room.  Thinks we don’t know.  You're John bloody Watson and this is Sir Sherri Holmes, dead and gone more ‘n twenty years.  That bastard killed me and took…he took…” The man’s eyes rolled back in his head and he said no more.
"It doesn't matter. Nothing matters to me. Not a bloody thing. I have nothing. Nothing to give to anyone. I don't … want anyone. Not even, just to be a meaningless shag. I don't even…"
Molly's eyes are wide and fearful. She has never seen Sherlock act like this. Her own voice is soft and timidly gentle, "So burning the world is what you think he would want? You think it is some sort of justice, for John?"
John read the dosages and the cocktail of substances. It was impossible.  Sherlock couldn’t have possibly gotten ahold of all of this. John couldn’t have gotten ahold of it.  Beyond that, no human could survive this kind of mixture short of long term hospice patients.
"God you are such a child. Can you not see, I risk my position, if not my very life to play this game of subterfuge with these people? All for your fragile little heart, Sherlock. To keep your little toy soldier alive. Whilst both of you act like petulant teen idols bent on destruction. If I had a brain in my head or a single cube of the ice my reputation has garnered, I would pack your little bags and drive you back to that rat trap you wallow in and wavy cheerfully as Althea plans your funerals."
Molly had spent years dropping subtle hints that she would happily accept his advances if he would simply make one. But, having listened to him make fun of any girl who acted forward towards him, she didn't want to make the same error. Over time she'd let him get away with all sorts of atrocious behavior, and had developed a thick skin when he said things like her mouth was too small or her dandruff was caused by her cheap shampoo. He always told her the truth. In a way, that was a form of intimacy. He didn't mean to make her feel insulted. She'd seen him turn that sort of lethally vengeful scrutiny upon almost everyone who annoyed him.
Sherlock did not seem surprised.  " I know, John.  I was not sedated.   I heard what you said.  But, the important thing is that you came back."
"Mycroft, I never meant it to…John just wanted to go with him. So badly. That's all. I don't understand. John should be with Sherlock. He was falling apart. And your brother, too. Sherlock was going off on some stupid nutter plan he wouldn't survive. John just wanted to go with him and help. Greg said they saw John with him, well he didn't know it was him, but he picked up on the similarities. You will have to ask Sherlock why, because I don't think that was John's plan when he left me."
“ I didn’t realize I had ever failed you in that area, despite your ridiculously childish rules.  Tell me, do they come in to play for all your male lovers or do you deny me only?” Ford couldn’t ever remember feeling more anger directed at John.
: The 6th Perdition of John
Mycroft contemplated parallels. There were similarities, though intention must be weighed carefully. Government sought to protect its people and its resources, which was actually the same thing James did for his own people. Molly was certainly never in any danger from Jim Moriarty. Was she in fact protected?
Sherlock rolled his eyes and gave John a look of dismissal,"You are serious? Just like that? Do you really expect me to believe that? This is Mycroft."
John grins but is still firm, “ Mary's taking me home. Because she needs to eat and her ankles are swelling. Bit not good.  We are too close to have you take chances at this stage. “
"How about we start with a kiss and see how we feel then."
He knew Sherlock would be watching, so he’d sent John across town with a puzzle. He was not surprised that John had taken his bait.  He’d followed him in another taxi and then bought coffee as if he’d been awaiting his arrival.
“There is no ghost. You are not a ghost. “ John assures him.
He would fix John, just like he had fixed him before.
John does a double take. "It's official. Weirdest day of my life."
John would have been devastated at his best friend’s second death, but it would have been clean and acceptable. Killed doing what he loved was far better than driven to suicide. John was a soldier; he could have understood that kind of tragedy and moved forward.
"Sherlock would have wanted you to have this. It was our father's. Please accept it as a Christmas gift and know he would have been delighted to see you wear it." Mycroft said handing John an expensive looking box. The watch was beautiful with fine engraving.
"Neither. Didn't get bribed and not saying it just for you. I didn't understand." John chuckles bitterly. He takes a painful deep breath and tries to keep himself alert. His voice is soft, contented and almost peaceful, " He wasn't trying to push me off a bridge when he said I couldn't go with him. He was trying to keep me… from jumping off one," John said with eyes drooping closed.
“Do keep him under wing, Sherri.  He’s yours now.” She had patted his arm and moved on to the other mourners.
Mycroft sighs and is resolved that he has never had any way to control Sherlock and his whims. "I will do what I can, but the rules have changed. I will not endanger good men to bring about the return of your pet soldier gone a bit rabid."
In Silence and Tears Chapter 35/12
“God, I hate you,” John whispered.
I just kept…seeing things…in you. I didn't love every second I was around you. God, you are an arse most of the time. But, when you left that next night…and you went with the killer. I followed, because I knew – I already knew – that you were going to be a full time job. I knew then that you would make every damned moment of my experience worth having. You know, I killed him in cold blood. It wasn't self-defense. He was not threatening your life. You had won. You chose to play anyway, Sherlock."
He’d believed Mary and now she’d proven that she’d known what she was talking about.   Sherlock was safe and here and …where the sodding hell was he?  Dawdling like the King of England on the ruddy plane.  Of course he was, the poncy toff.
“  So, there it is.  Fuck me. Don’t fuck me. I don’t care, but I will save him, no matter what and when I’m done with that and the great Consulting Detective blows me off again and Molly hates me and you take off and I have murdered a man who you think maybe couldn’t murder me out of loyalty.  Don’t bother with any souvenirs, though I guess my skull on Sherlock’s mantle might give you both a laugh.  Just let my sister think all of me remained in the coffin and don’t tell her about your ghoulish collection or Sherlock’s fridge etiquette.  Or hey, already dead, just let me rot where I fall and walk away.”
Mary looks up from his phone, “You've been reading John's blog. The story of how you met.”
His body responded enthusiastically toward Rat’s blatant advances and innuendo.  His mind refused them in no uncertain terms.
“But we knew that in the beginning we were only to target the non-essential branches, gather data without disrupting any major operations.  That has worked. We know more now than we ever dreamed of obtaining,” Grady said with just the beginning of controlled defensiveness in his voice.
"It isn't that simple, John. Yes he did read me…and I read him too. He was ready to make his departure. He lived for his game and he wanted it all to end. You were not there. You didn't see his eyes."
The cabby shrugged, "Could be right. I was thinking you looked like that dead bloke. My mistake."
"It isn't your fault."
_____________________________________________________________
Mrs. Hudson hushes them all, cocking her ear upward. "Well, sounds like they are about finished. You all better push along before he makes one of his comments and upsets me. I'll ring you later."
John saw his chance and pulled the trigger twice, two targets fell.  “You always spoil my fun.”  He said as he reloaded.  “I’m fine.”
John tilts his head and looks confused. "I don't understand. You're here for Sherlock? I thought…never mind. What are you saying? You came to London, because of Sherlock Holmes?"
*You know that is true.-SH*
managed to intimidate someone. His brother could have died due to his meddling in this case. It truly disconcerted him when John had turned to him calmly and inquired about his motives. The man had just shot someone, and cool and innocent as snow, turned and asked a government employee if his inquiries toward Sherlock where what…honorable? At that point, Mycroft was highly intimidated. Doctor Watson had shocked the British Government enough that he'd thought of hiring John himself. The two of them, Sherlock and the doctor, had strolled off laughing and planning dinner as if life could not get any more amusing.
Anoxic Brain Injury caused by barbiturate poisoning
“The assassin was under my orders,” She blurted.
John stood there breathing deeply as his only display of his fury. He is silent. He blinks and shakes his head. John leaned over awkwardly. That won't work and he puts his hand on Sherlock's shoulder. He drops to one knee then brings the other down and kneels in front of Sherlock.
John would roll out his patient dealing-with-Sherlock face and carefully explain that he understood the difficulty of Sherlock admitting he was wrong but wanted a more detailed description of what he was wrong about. John might even prove he isn't dead with some small touch or gesture. A kiss would be Sherlock's wish. He could still taste John and just because he'd said no, did not mean he had not taken in each sensation like light into his secret soul.
Moriarty earned his money by stealing, swindling, threatening, harassing, and was an unpredictable sociopath.
“I want to speak to him,” Sherlock said with a rumbling whisper.
She looked around and shook her head at how perfectly horrible this had become. "Oh, John. John, what happened? I don't even know what happened!" She shrieked to the empty garage.
John explained what he had administered and an IV was started on the way.  The detective regained consciousness just in time for the joy of stinger removal and he did not endure the proceeding with stoic calm but complained loudly the entire time and deduced horrifically embarrassing things about both John and his other attendants despite his eyes swelling shut.
John smiled and his eyes softened and shined with love.  He looked at the face before him...angular but swollen into a blob, one brilliantly red and turquoise eye and one leaking slit where an eye should be.  There were plasters and greasy cream all over him and a catheter bag swinging from the bed, snot running down to his clownishly swollen lips....too skinny....too arrogant...and frankly the most annoying dick on the planet and that was the person John had picked out of all the beautiful women he had ever bedded...this was who his heart could not exist without.
John smirked and then couldn't help but laugh. "Do you really think these little bits will keep me here five minutes past the time I want to be here?"John asked as he held up his restraints.
"I got stiches?"
"No. I tried to be better for you but I only damaged your life for my effort. Not much cop in it for you, this wanting to fix me thing. I won't make the same mistake with Molly. If she hates me, she won't try to end it all for me or because of me or by trying to save me. This has been hard on her. It has made her fragile."
All his rambling about the bride and Moritarty was just window dressing. He had not known of the broadcast when he’d injected and swallowed his list.
“Sorry I could never resist a Gong or a touch of the dramatic.” Sherlock confessed.
“Probably compromised.  He never showed.  Or. Warned.  This was a set up.  I can smell it.  I didn’t know the maestro personally, but I would bet you a million pounds that that was not him.” Rat said as he let his head bob around and eyes scan the surroundings.  “So, other than the bombs and the terrorist attack, what did you think?” Rat asked as he duck walked to the end of a plumbing ventilation bank.
John groans. Sherlock smirks and winks at John, knocks softly on the door and purrs, "Always welcome to join us, my dear? If you're hungry."
They were not wrong. He had every intention of getting away. He knew what Mycroft wanted and he had repeatedly refused point blank. John was a product of his training, but he would never be willing to train more soldiers to be like him. In the first place, the things he imagined they expected him to teach were so evil that they didn't need to be passed on. If he were given one-hundred of Mycroft's finest agents, John could break half of them by the end of the first day. It might take more than one batch of hard-eyed hopefuls before John could actually replicate himself one time and the trail of psychological damage it would require to hand Mycroft another was not worth it.
"The bugs are fine, Sherlock.  Mycroft will take them away if you like?  After this I assume you wont be keen--"
"Wait, no. I want to see you. You're not him. Don't do that to me." She pressed her fingers to his chest backing up her words.
Find me and we will see if it is as fun when you discover, the one you can't beat is the one you didn't notice. Did you find the first clue my love? They will get harder.
Now it was Mycroft's turn to display mirth though on the bespoke clad man of mystery on the other side of the phone, that came across as more snide than joyful.  "I honestly thought you were more clever than you appear.  I abhor being proved wrong.  I would think the answer to that question could be solved, well, by anyone who has spent five minutes in your proximity.  Do try harder, John, that scenario is yet to be completely abandoned, but I do have confidence that you will catch up to the class before I have to implement such measures.  Do ring me if you need anything."
But every time the longing shook me, I remembered how too often now I read of some poor wretch, too fond and confiding, brought to destruction by a man he had thought of as a lover. Every time I waited, hopeless and helpless, for him to say, as I had thought him about to say on the train back from Norfolk, that our friendship was too much, we must be less fond, less free with each other. He did not. He did not, and for that I was thankful, praying humbly that he might continue to be so generous with touch and look, and kind word. I loved him so very dearly, and yet I could see no hope now.
me, not
Sherlock's interest was piqued. "What about her?" he asked.
John's eyes fluttered away and he picked up his coffee. "I reckon so."
John just went on shaking his head and saying, "That damned woman is the work of the devil."
"I…" Sherlock's eyes fluttered down. "–said 'easier on me'," he explained, cautiously looking back up at John. "Me being high, you being drunk or traumatized in some way… it's easier
Sherlock smirked, pulling out his keys and jingling them.
Sherlock shrugged, not wanting to make the subject seem too serious. "I'm curious what you thought of her," he said nonchalantly.
Sherlock shrugged. "Well… no," he admitted. "I don't. But I know enough."
me." He glanced away again. "You were almost right about my priorities." His eyes flickered back momentarily to stress, "
called
"Well, unlock it then," John directed.
"M'not talking about this," he said firmly. "We'll sleep on the streets if we have to."
John's eyes landed on Sherlock's, and they were fierce. "Last night, when we…" He trailed off, but Sherlock ended the sentence shamelessly for him.
"I said didn't say 'for me'," Sherlock interrupted suddenly.
Another tap on his other shoulder and John met Darla's boyfriend, or at least his fist.
John slowly turned to meet Sherlock's eyes, and then he frowned. "Are you… high?"
John's eyes came to life as he sat up straight in the chair and nodded, his eagerness almost overwhelming. Sherlock nodded back and retreated to his room. John paced the floor for a few long minutes before he decided that such was too much action for his state of being. He took off his jacket and tossed it to the floor, kicking off his shoes next. He looked down at his clothes in silent scrutiny. And then, yet again, there was a hand at his shoulder. Except, this time, there were two on either side and there was no ill intent in this touch. No, in fact, it was quite the opposite. John swallowed thickly as his own name caressed his ear in the wave of a hot breath.
John's face crumpled into an expression of frustration. "Look, if you think that I enjoy being a charity case, then you're an absolute–"
Sherlock was silenced as he realized that John was right. He truly had no clue where John's wants and desires fell in line, but John never seemed to be confused about his feelings or what he was doing. Sherlock, on the other hand, was always just along for the ride, not understanding anyone or anything, or at least not when it came to things between him and John. Anyone else was easy enough to crack, but there was this enigmatic part of John that would not be unraveled, and it lay inside Sherlock himself too. Uncrackable codes.
"Last–?" The bartender was already turning his attention to another, equally intoxicated man, but John hollered after him anyway. "Last one? Hey!"
"Wait, what? What's that mean?" John asked.
"I wonder…"
"I'd've made it home just fine without you! You didn't have to come get me. I could've caught a cab on my own," John assured.
Sherlock paused for a short moment, his expression expectant. "Oh, is that all of it then?" he asked. John's eyes rolled. "That's more of an observation than an explanation for your attitude this morning," Sherlock pointed out.
"Hey," a soft voice parroted, and it came paired with a gentle touch on his left shoulder.
Sherlock just continued to smirk, even as John grabbed for the damned keys. Sherlock evaded, smirking even more annoyingly. John made the next connection on his own.
"Two fifty," the bartender said simply, letting go of the bottle and holding his hand out expectantly.
After a long moment of pause, Sherlock felt John grab his hand. He looked over his shoulder at a sleepy-eyed John, who squeezed lightly. There was an askance in his eyes, something Sherlock had seen before. He understood what John was getting at before John outwardly got at it, but he wasn't sure he was willing to oblige this time. Was he, Sherlock Holmes, being emotionally affected? He studied the way his body reacted to John on the inside. For the most part, it was normal and totally predictable. But there were other parts that made no sense, like how it all made him feel in the end. It was an emotion Sherlock was not used to being in close quarters with.
"I never…"
His phone buzzed and tried to walk off the rail from the vibration.  Sherlock rushed to save it and did not notice the tiny screw that snagged onto his trousers.   His focus was on his phone in case it was John.
“Exactly.  Imagine if you had a secret way to bring a about an uncomputerlike reaction by pulsing a sound wave nobody could hear and with this, you could make any computer wake up, relax it’s programs and trust you.  This is the first step toward that and everyone either wants it or wants to stop others from obtaining the possibilities.  The maestro is on the verge of changing the world and he doesn’t even quite know what he holds.  There have been overtures, but he is a difficult man and yet the idea is already in the greedy hearts of the world. Moriarty couldn’t deliver on his promise and his time for producing it was crushing him.  He killed himself because he had no way out.  He had promised something he could not deliver and he wanted out.  The pressure of continued failure came to outweigh his egos ability to admit that his great maniacal vision might just be a pipe dream.   Do you see what would have happened if he let that information be known?”
John continued to defend him. “He couldn’t have taken all of this in the last five minutes.”
Molly had looked in his eyes and studied him, taken aback by his quiet candid speech. "If I did get pregnant and wanted to keep it? You would be okay with that in what way?"
"I am not dead. I am very much alive which I will be forced to prove if you don't put down that syringe. Now, John. Do this for me, then get over here and punch me or yell or throw me out, but I will not have you become lost to me in this way."
“Uncle in Texas.” She lied.
"If I have to lose them, I will find a good home for them. I love them even more now.  I told my sorrows to the bees...and they heard me."
He was high when he got on the plane.
"Short jokes again or…no. What kind of doctor?"
recently married a man of a seemingly kindly disposition, who has now abandoned you for an unsavoury companion of dubious morals”
John looked up then back down at the folders. "A case. Of course. A case. I need a case and this one, I need most of all. Thank you."
On the steps of Appledore, on a perfect Christmas day, Sherlock changed the world for the better in cold blood. “Christ, Sherlock. Oh Christ…” was all John knew to say. He didn’t move to assist the still vibrating and spasming body as it sped through the process of death. All he could see were red lights dancing on Sherlock and tried to figure out how to keep his friend alive.
“Should I call an ambulance? Is he dying?” Mycroft questioned.
John learned why Sherlock had to jump. Mycroft and he worked together and before the week was up, they had begun a friendly sort of alliance. They quietly rid the world of Sherlock's reasons. The Plumber was an exception, because he had proved himself both a small potato and the key to really solving the whole thing.
If they had ever aligned on the same side, good or evil, nothing could have stopped them from changing the world. If James had made his move earlier, what would Sherlock have become? Would he have been happier as some advisor to a monarch less noble than Mycroft's? Were they really that different when you looked at the whole?
Sherlock smiled with sly pleasure, “If you won’t allow me to help you, perhaps you will be your normal meddling self and be so kind as to rescue your poor baby brother? It is your only hobby. Time to choose a side, brother dear.”
"Obviously. I wouldn't be here if it weren't. I have missed my assistant, my colleague, my best friend. I am so glad this brought us together. Like old times, eh John? The game is on and all is well." Sherlock sighed with contentment as John stared at the ceiling.
"You have shown no ability to escape thus far. I visit you."
“I suppose that’s true, but I can’t always do the right thing when it won’t make me happy in the long run. You make me happy. Do you understand that? Is wanting that so wrong?” John tried to justify how he felt.
[Suit yourself. Time marches on. JW]
The unseen clues, his unsaid words. John had seen but not observed. Sherlock had observed but was not able to deduce the impossible. Love is impossible. It killed Sherlock. Did that mean he'd been right all along?
Snipers set about the city.
"Oh, so you're the smart one then. Well that's a relief, I tell you; I thought they were sending the crazy one up to us. Can't stand that one, you know. I'll tell you this, lad, those bleeding-heart Dorchesters won't think it's such a grand thing, letting the cursed gnomes run amuck, once one bites them. Bloody things can rot your arm off, just from a little nip. " He moved his eyebrows as if everyone in the universe with any intelligence would agree with him.
"I know. Soon. Right now I just want to see John. Mad or not, I don't even care. I just want to sit and look at him. I have missed him."
"Impossible, I'm sorry."
“John knows what a nurse is capable of. When did you figure it out?” Mary teased.
Sherlock didn’t want to insult these men. They had been very useful and unperturbed by unforeseen logistic problems.  He looked around the table and nodded. “Please be advised, I am not unhappy with our projects so far, however, you are all capable of far more than I expected.  I assumed that there would be fatigue issues as well as a bit of retraining necessary.  That has not been the case in my opinion.”
"But…That."
"You are a bloody prat, and I'd have to be mad to miss you. So get on with it, you and your superior grin have more you want to say. Go on then, no need to relish it. Spit it out."
“Nice, John. I do think I could have managed it without quite so much—“
The next morning was excruciating.   They were painfully polite and formal and it felt exhausting.  John was cross and Rat was aloof and distant when he wasn’t being critical.  They packed for what Ford called their first order of business and John refused to indulge in demanding to know any of the particulars.
"Thank you. When can he go?"
Character/Relationships: John/Sherlock
“Then you are wrong.” John’s voice remained calm, but there was a hollow rasp in it.  His eyes flitted away as if looking for escape before returning to meet Sherrinford’s with steel determination and a glare of hatred.
Weeks went by and no word was said of Sherlock. John left dozens of messages with Mycroft but got no response. Conflicting stories ran, obviously faked reports of unknown intruders and the murder of the larger than life newspaper billionaire, killed in his home on Christmas. It was eventually reported as indisputably ruled suicide and dozens of supposed employees paraded a marathon of tragic disappointments that supported this fabrication. Still, Sherlock’s fate was unknown.
Sherlock follows and stands uncomfortably between kitchen and parlor in his stiff mannequin stance of observance. Sherlock was taking in data. John always thought of it as if Sherlock was consuming his surroundings. He is like a tornado of mind simply sucking up everything in its path. He should have expected destruction, having stood in the storm's path in awe of its beauty. John Watson knew the squall was a heartless eater of obstacles, yet he had fooled himself into thinking the tempest noticed him.
“Quite so.” Sherlock replied.
"Shall I send her an appointment card, Sir?" came the immediate reply.
She is still shaking her head, not sure she wants to get involved and quite certain he has somehow planned this. He seems earnest, but Molly doesn't quite buy that he showed up here casually. "I could get in a lot of trouble."
"Sherlock. You hear only the bits you want to hear."
People looked right past John here. They took him at face value and nobody suspected that the short, limping doctor might be the sort of man who could walk into hell with a smile and walk out with an army of the devil's minions following him. John had always had a way with people and his specialties were mediation, infiltration, conversion and wet work. Saving lives was always his preference, but John found the Hippocratic Oath did not interfere with his oath to queen and country. He never murdered a good guy and that meant he was preventing the loss of life by treating the disease rather than the symptoms. Sometimes, the cancer could be cut out to prevent its spread. The same was true of people and John had no problem with killing anyone whose existence was a cancer upon the world.
"What do you mean?"
Eloise Wheatley moans, "Oh God, you didn't? Do you know how hard it is to get anyone to come here for dinner? They all want to leave before the sun goes down. You and your blasted foolery, Harper. And recruiting young Sherlock – God knows what will be said now. We'll be haunted next thing you know!"
“You are a bastard.” John said, a tear spilling from his left eye. His face scrunched up in pain for a moment.
The cab driver watched him and finally ventured, "You look like someone."
"Ok. You are done screaming right, because that almost gave me a heart attack," she said carefully.
Sherlock looks away, pointedly ignoring John's gaze. "Not my problem."
Dr. John Watson was considered to be on the market again, now that he had found release from his terrible obligatory friendship with the time consuming freak, was no longer a factor. They were his friends again, though something they couldn't quite admit or express seemed to have taken something out of Dr. John. When mentioned, they all blamed it on the fact that he had to feel a little off, considering he'd watched the man die before his eyes.
They don't sleep afterward, but each dozes with their own thoughts for a time. It was warm against him though the chill of air swirls around them, trying to escort them into compliant wakefulness.
Janine comes to visit and John takes a walk.
The Rat sighs, face blank daring John to complain. "Yes."
Finally, Sherlock stopped. "You will do. You may return and we will see what Mrs. Hudson has to say."
"I am sorry I must look atrocious...but I have it under the good authority of our resident toddler that the kissing of booboos is cutting edge healing technology.  I would be amenable to experimentation for scientific purposes." Sherlock tried to make his one eye look both innocent and lustful, but the actual result still looked like the elephant man on a GQ photoshoot.
John knew it was someone who must have the phone now. He decided to play.
Mary had seen a lot of men beg for everything from their mothers to strange god’s as their life faded. This man rode toward the veil with a bank of staircase humor packed in his pocket. His comments lagged behind their subjects just enough to make him seem a little barmy. She covered her mouth to giggle silently and felt her heart fall deeply and truly in love. She shot two of them and incapacitated another, but John had sprung without warning or question. When he looked at her once it was all sorted, she had expected to see many emotions dabble his face as he decided that she was no longer feminine and cute and ladylike. All she had found there was the door to his passion.
"You think it was over the violin? Mycroft said it…was worth more than you or I will ever make. You think that might be what pushed him? What time was it when you left him?" Greg asks again.
First of all, SPOILERS – SPOILERS If you have not seen the Special – SPOILERS you should not read this at all – SPOILERS you will not understand it anyway.
Sherlock laughs in exasperation. He takes several deep breaths and calms himself as if she had almost fooled him. He paces then stops and picks something up off the floor, examines it and stuffs it in his pocket. He steps back to the van and his face is amused and haughty again.
"You ended your suicide note…with a joke?"
In the evening, Sherlock would sit John in his old chair and Sherlock would read to him, play his violin or sometimes just talk.  In the flickering gold light of the fire, Sherlock could imagine that John and he were just enjoying a quiet evening exactly like before.
"There you are, dear. You remember my dead son don't you, Eloise?" she said peeking up from her tile work. The kitchen table was covered in brightly colored stepping stones, and unfinished ones and bits of tile everywhere.
His friend snorts, "Mycroft. I'd call him a bastard but I happen to know his parents were, in fact, married at the time of his conception. Can you still swim?"
Molly cleared her throat, "He was so happy. He wanted to go. It would have been better. Why didn't you just take him with you? What happened between you?"
We know what was said between Sherlock and John. This is what may have been said on the other end of the plane,
“My father was a great man.  I would very much hate for him to accuse me of taking the path of anodyne progress.  I leave the choice to you.  You have far more experience than I.  Shall we continue our painless little prickles or have we ended our boy’s camp endeavors.   Can you handle more?”
John sighed and closed his eyes. "So that's why you came back. That is what this whole bloody thing has been about. The Woman. She's what made you lower yourself and …dammit."
“Tell me what could be so bad and if you convince me, I will consider helping you. Please, don’t be stupid, you will be impaired or lose consciousness long before anything we have will stop your heart. You know that. You would need a lot and starting an IV on yourself would be the only way to do it. Kind of look like a ponce to die that way and I could make it look accidental. But you have to convince me.” Mary said defiantly standing her ground as if she had just made a reasonable proposition.
Mycroft glares at John, “You have no right—“
Rat's eyes are wide and he is out of breath. "Just relax, I've done this a time or two."
Oh God. “Sherlock.  This could kill you! You could die!” John stated the obvious just as his own heart sputtered and threatened to stop all together.
John murmured, "Eight hundred and eighty seven bees disagree. More actually, have not counted the stingers that got stuck in your clothing and did not make it to you.  I am here...Mycroft sent nine boxes of crap to keep us entertained and I did flirt with him a bit, in case there is torture and death later...I am hoping for some small measures of mercy."
"You couldn't have. John, he was betrayed by his own men."
“He’s coming round. If you want to…try not to upset him?” John informed Mycroft as he stood on the steps of the plane. John ducked back inside and Mycroft followed.
Yes the clue is obvious but John took into account a bit of emotional clog in the mind palace. Please review?
"What the actual fuu...Sherlock? Did you just throw your drinking cup at me?"
He sat by the fire after the afternoon nurse left and before the night shift woman would arrive.  This was the best time of day for Sherlock.
“What is it about?  Who or what has all these people wanting a music conductor?  Doesn’t seem like a particularly dangerous occupation.  Bit on the academic, dull side of life I would imagine.”  John is genuinely confused.  “And why would Moriarty’s bunch want him?”
Sherlock stood in the middle of the road, watching the cabbie watch him in his mirrors. Sherlock waited until the cabbie had to look forward for a second and then quickly hastened into the secret angle cut pass-through of the hedge rows. He waited for a count of three and the satisfying sound of the cab breaking on rewarded his little prank. The car idled for a few seconds and then the driver's window rolled down.
John rolled Sherlock to the side and Mary guided his head as his stomach contents filled the air with a foul odor. Mycroft stepped out for fresh air.
"No. It would drive him insane. He's probably pouting on some heavenly couch at this moment fuming and shrieking that he's bored." Mycroft said softly smiling.
Sherlock didn't bother with saying goodbye. Mycroft's former boss just appeared far below, looking older, but still as grand as a peacock. His attention turned toward his purpose for coming to London.
Molly shakes her head and leans into her crossed arms as if she had a stomach-ache. "Everything hurts. I feel like I'm coming apart from the inside. This is what it was like for him, I guess, but worse. I need to see it." Molly lifts the remote and points it at her telly.
“ You mean how Moriarty did it? Yes. But none of that really happened, it was in your head,” John reminds him.
"Sentiment, Mycroft," Sherlock says with disapproval but his posture is much more relaxed. "Remember to keep your elbow in, stop doing that chicken wing
“Every one of those began with ‘his’. What was he to you?” she prompted.
"You should get busy writing and stop wasting time admiring my arse. Three hours and I have no intention of spending it growing puckered when there are perfectly suitable dry garments in you little shrine back there. He was never dead and I have not blasphemed his sacred belongings. You should change too. You'll end up catching your death. May as well be comfortable." Rat stated as he continued to type on his phone-like object.
"Greg. Umm, sure. I suppose." She stands aside, confused, but tries to give him an apologetic smile as she smooths her hair and wonders what he must think of her, not dressed at half-nine in the morning. "Kind of a late night and I have a shift tonight, so bit of a lie-in. Have a seat. Tea?"
He introduced him to the strangest, most intriguing person he'd ever run across somewhere within the familiar bowels of St. Barts. This tall, blazing person had no boundaries, no rules and his superiority was forceful and had no safety. John was invited to look at a flat on the morrow. John almost thought it would be worth missing his own appointment to keep that one. He had no need to plan a future, but to just be near that something again, to have a chance to analyze it and figure out why he had none of that sort of majesty. He might stay for a bit.
“If one disregards the ghost, it only leaves one suspect. But one aspect doesn’t make sense. Why engage me to prevent a murder you intended to commit?”  Sherlock questions.  “No. Not you. Not you.” Sherlock becomes more agitated.
“Yes. Yes, I know. On my own. No relation, just a client. Have I ever let you down prior to this?” Sherlock said in his bored of this discussion voice. He flapped a hand waving her to go away.
He tosses the keys at her. "I know about you and Jim. I've always known. I knew about John too. You lied to me. You knew it would hurt me and took him to your bed anyway. I tried not to hate you for it. I told myself fairytales. Caring about you blinded me. I will always care, but love and hate grow on the same stem, Molly. Love is a game for fools and I knew better, but it is the same as being a junky, isn't it? It stops feeling good and becomes a burden. It makes us crave and scurry around to keep it. When it stops there are no cures because your brain has rewired. It becomes everything. You gave me everything and then snatched it away. John and Molly loved Sherlock. You can love dangerous things. You always do. But, dangerous things are dangerous. You can love an Adder. Snakes are beautiful creatures, but they still are capable of biting the hand that snatches them to safety from a fall. Hard lesson, but a valuable one."
She nods, "He's been hurt, hasn't he? He's going to be okay, isn't he?"
"But you didn't shoot him until you perceived that I was in danger."
Moriarty had never shown his face before. He had never made himself known to Sherlock. They had no idea that he'd been making small overtures toward Sherlock Homes until the night his brother had deemed it necessary to challenge the wits of that cabbie. Thank heavens John had surreptitiously put a stop to that evening's possible outcome.
Sherlock’s face was beginning to blotch as he swiftly boarded the Citation III . Mary felt slightly sick that she might honestly never see him again. She approached John and took his hand. Johns face was stoic and his posture was stiff. She actually connected the dots and realized he was standing at full military attention, sending his friend off with the highest honor he could bestow.
"Yes, of course. And do retain the footage of his little party trick. One never knows what one may find of use in the future." Mycroft stepped over John and left the room, making certain to not sully his shoes with John's blood.
“Sherlock?” John asked at once.
“I can’t,” he snapped.
“Yes. Read about your…ummm. Expertise, in the tabloids. I don’t think I could ever live up to…urrmm. Right. Any plans to be engaged a little more privately? Any time soon? To someone else, perhaps?” John stammered with discomfort.
"May have miscalculated a little, but it worked out fine. Well, except for you getting hit by a boat. Sorry about that," Rat says as if he's lightly trampled a toe by mistake.
Sherlock on the roof of Saint Bart's.
"I never told a soul. Only realized it myself as I watched the dirt fill in. I knew, but I lied to myself. I love him. Oh God, I love him. I never bothered to tell him and he died not knowing. He died because I was too much of a coward to give him a strand of kindness. I was so angry. I was afraid they were going to kill him and he was taking chances and hiding things from me. How could he do that to me the blasted second he was safe? How could he hate me so? I will never forgive myself. The bastard killed himself and my heart, my soul, everything I was, just stepped off the ledge and ended. I am beyond grief. I sometimes don't even … " John zoned out, his face bland as his eyes focused far away, spilling over with the tears he'd never allowed anyone to view. He'd done so well at keeping his disguise glued in place, but finding someone who could see him so easily, had exposed his secret.
She opened the door for him and stood aside.
“You didn’t leave,” John says, commenting on the words that stood out to him the most.
“Told you…” Lestrade replied once they’d closed the door behind them. “Sticks to his guns though, no matter how hard I push he won’t admit to knowing anything about the card.”
Propping his head back up he looks down at it. Pinched there, between finger and thumb.
Certainly not disagreements over experiments in the fridge, or cold cups of tea or the violin at 3am.
“Yes,” Sherlock looked impressed at John’s guess. “But he was clever,”
The stranger seems to waver, before deciding with a slight tip of his head: “Sherlock Holmes,” He offers,
“You love me.” Sherlock.
John stops, turning to see a man rise from the bench he’s just hobbled past. It seems to take a long time; his long dark frame extenuated by a longer darker coat. Above it a thick black head of hair and a pale face, wide eyes looking down at him expectantly.
They fell into step together.
“Sherlock?” Someone was calling his name.
“We let her go,” Lestrade told him levelly.
“I was looking for someone.”
“It was inevitable that it would be mentioned at some point.”
They paused, contemplating each other.
“Yes,” Lestrade was enjoying himself.
“I’ve been contemplating it a while.”
He looked down at her and motioned to the desk.
A pause.
Sherlock stares back at him, silent.
“Oh, I’m sorry…” John starts, abashed.
“Which is it – Afghanistan or Iraq?” The stranger says again, those eyes boring into John with a singular purpose.
The man’s word seems to hold an ocean of feeling.
“They are my area of expertise.”
“You’re remembering things.” Sherlock tells him.
A pause, then confirmation: “Yes.”
“He would have warned me.”
“Yes.” John acknowledges, cutting him off.
“Probably, if I was aware of it in the first place.”
Sherlock nods once.
“You seemed to imply that knowing… that… before. Might have made things better.”
“You don’t really eat sandwiches in the morgue?” John asked.
Another pause on Sherlock’s part, another nod.
“No.”
John’s eyes cut to her, mouth dropping open a little to ask how she knew, before he stopped. Of course she would have seen him, she worked in the morgue.
A breath, three paces and a turn.
“I believe he may have been more expansive about the nature of our relationship than is necessarily the truth.”
John turns to her.
“But make them tight,” He calls, as the porters and nurses go to work to pin down the patient’s limbs. “And for god’s sake find the brother.” John turns to leave.
“No, I,” Sherlock’s turn to put his hand across his eyes. “I’m not good at this.”
“Would you have? If I hadn’t…?”
“Go away?”
“You’re stalking them?”
“Read people like that,”
“Last week, Monday”.
Sherlock continues to stare.
“Baker Street.”
“He always does,” Said the other, “Just look at Jenny!”
“There was a threat to your life,” Sherlock again. He hasn’t moved. Feet pressed firmly to the ground, standing in the doorway. Alive.
“Some do.”
“So how is… everything?” She obliges with concern and John is cut neatly back out of the conversation.
SHERLOCK
“Yes.”
“I think you and she have differing definitions of important,” John replies, dropping the papers and looking up at Sherlock across the room. He still stands on the threshold, leaning his long frame against the doorway; dark suit and John’s favourite shirt.
“Tried to tell me you were a fraud.”
“…and that it hurts. It hurt. It was hard.” A pause, John levels his gaze at him “I told you that. And you didn’t even blink.”
John finds himself opening the door and stepping out between concrete sky and concrete floor with little idea of how he came to be there.
“That word again.” John sighs. “You have to understand that I’d have questioned it.”
“Yes, that was Mycroft’s doing.” Sherlock’s tone goes bitter on the name.
“Monty Python?”
“And they…?” John asks again, incompletely.
John awakes to the dishwater sunshine of a north London morning falling across his pillow.
“Of course not, we’d been dating for almost a year.”
For an hour he’d sat making small talk with her at her kitchen table. The trials and tribulations of the residents of Baker Street had failed to keep his attention as they had done in the week before, now that he knew a folded leaf of blue paper was waiting for him in the pigeonhole in the hallway.
She made her way carefully in to the room, setting down a tea tray on top of a second box, perched on top a third, which was in turn atop the coffee table.
“To change.” Sherlock called back, almost gone, “Text me the address.”
He’s always doing that.
John’s hair was blonder than it had been before.
“You knew that. It was part of the plan.”
“Yes,” Molly said cheerfully, “This is Greg,” She gestured, then quieter: “And Sherlock,”
And suddenly finds that their positions have been reversed.
“Steve Redcar. They weren’t married.” Lestrade replied deadpan.
“Is Zoe available?” Lestrade asked, exasperated.
“What…” John speaks, finally. That internal world splitting apart silently behind his eyes. All that pain. “What are you doing here?”
“Did you?” Sherlock asks suddenly. Whirling to face him with a desperation that renders John speechless for a moment.
“You’re a soldier?” Angelo asks.
A pause as John contemplates this, realising that this was what he assumed all along.
For a long moment Sherlock contemplates him, from a height. Before he steps back:
John swallows. Nerves suddenly suffocating. For a time they simply regard each other, fingers linked, John’s eyes roaming Sherlock’s face: the familiar eyes, the ridiculous cheekbones.
“Not yet no, but give him a chance, he just confessed to murder.”
“Let me get this straight,” Lestrade said, from behind his desk, addressing Sherlock who paced in front of him. “You tell me the whole thing is obvious…?”
you?” She asks with that motherly concern she does so well.
“Sorry,” John says, cursing his innate Britishness that he feels he must start a sentence with an apology. As much as he is trying not to care about the question however, he has to admit that the stranger has intrigued him, “How did you know…?”
“You’re a doctor.” Sherlock seems to realise.
Seconds tick by.
“You often are.”
As she elaborates John has the bizarrely pleasant sensation of being present only as her obedient sounding board.
“I didn’t remember you.” John states.
The room is in chaos: littered possessions, half unpacked boxes, books and papers and notes. John has to struggle to remember how it looked when he left it: a room half full of remembered objects and the tense expectation of a space waiting to be filled. Well now it is; even the bison has headphones again.
“Yes, it’s here somewhere.” John casts around, before noticing the way the patient is holding himself. “Are you cold?”
“Amazing.” John wonders aloud,
“Yes,”
“You’re awake?” She asks John in astonishment.
Sherlock reached the door and pulled it open, calling back over his shoulder a final:
It strikes John then that he should probably have had some kind of powerful epiphany as he pulled himself from unconsciousness those few minutes before. Perhaps he should have been painfully unaware, ready to face another faceless day without Sherlock in it. Until realisation dawned and he remembered: remembered the figure in the doorway, John’s own name spoken in the voice of a memory, the shouts and the accusations. The smiles and the touches and the words. So many words. More than John feels he’s said in a lifetime.
“You’ve seen her before?”
“That’s,” John’s unsure where to start, “No problem,”
Sherlock doesn’t reply for a long time. They sit looking at each other. John begins to understand what people mean when they say their heart is in their throat. He can feel it pumping there, huge and sickening.
“About my plans?”
But then a particularly well aimed kick from a skinny leg catches John square in the gut and he’s pushed backwards. All sympathy for the man fades with the pain.
This evening he did. The temperature around him rising subtly as he ascended; the stale air of a flat no longer lived in.
Mycroft merely nodded his response.
“Well,” There could be something like a smile on Mycroft’s face as he leans back a little from the word, before he shakes his head fractionally: “I should get the doctor.” He says efficiently, striding from the room.
“Yeah, there’s that.” He paused, “Still can’t afford to live here though,”
“I need your help.”
“You can’t deduce that?”
“I know. But you are. Really.”
“I never asked…” John said confused.
John was silent in response, not wanting to offer the usual platitudes or expressions of surprise, but not really sure what else to say.
This time the pause is awkward.
“Because it’s over.”
They watch each other again.
They escaped.
John smiles.
He’s disappointed to find Sherlock absent from within it. He’d expected to find him pouring over John’s laptop, or dramatically stretched out on the sofa. Already bored.
“No. Not a drug. Something of the same strength. To muddle the mind.”
“I know, you wouldn’t think it now,” She laughed, but John could see that in her.
“His brother brought him in,” The nurse replies,
The waiting may have seemed interminable to John, but it had only been minutes. To Sherlock, it would have been years. Would he? Could he, have waited?
“No.”
“Speaking to her?”
“Yes!” Angelo cried, eager for details. John realised he’d had years to wonder.
“So close you’re about to blow it,” Lestrade hissed back.
John politely decides not to point out that she was so recently eager to set him up with whoever this Sherlock chap is.
“Look is this a joke?” He asks, exasperated. “Did Mike put you up to this? Some elaborate ruse to humiliate the cripple?!”
“Oh,” Mike stood a little straighter, shifting his shoulders, perhaps remembering. “Right,”
“Working with us?” Lestrade frames it as a question,
“You should tell them I’m awake.”
“He died on the rooftop of Bart’s,”
“I have no idea,”
“Oh yeah, I met him a few times. He came to one of these once…” She gestured around herself.
“No,” John leans back to his pint. “Wasn’t doing me any good.”
“Sherlock…?” Lestrade asked in an entirely different tone.
“We?”
“Yes, yes, sorry,” He apologised immediately, dropping his gaze and focussing for a second on the end of his cane on the pavement. “It’s just, I think I picked up some of Sherlock’s post by accident, on my way out, you see…” He was rambling, but held out the note to her in evidence, it had the word ‘Sherlock’ printed very clearly and carefully on the front. “You wouldn’t…?” He faltered, “You wouldn’t see that he gets it?”
“But not the interesting ones…” Sherlock called back over his shoulder.
“Should I recognise you?” John asks once his assessment of the stranger is complete. Model, he thinks idly. Possibly actor.
“Really John, if they insist upon you using it there must be a reason.” Sherlock’s voice is infuriatingly calm.
“No.” She says. “We’ve never met.”
“Yes,” John answers honestly. “We work together all the time.”
“You’ve really thought this through,” John says in admiration, he can’t decide whether or not it is a question.
“Pacing won’t help.” John’s voice.
“You just said I was,” Slowly John can feel himself falling from that delicately balanced knife edge of shock, and into something like hysteria.
“You don’t remember?” She asked and sat down with a flourish, gesturing around them to the empty flowerbeds and bare trees.
“John,” Sherlock repeats, as if testing it out, staring down at John with eyes so sharp and full of power that John partly wishes he would turn around again.
In retrospect it’s unfortunate that he’s holding crockery when Mrs Hudson opens the door. In retrospect it’s unusual that she hasn’t already called out to him from the landing, voice high and sing-song:
“Are you going to tell me what you’re taking?” John asks.
“I was scared.”
“Not exactly.” Lestrade clarifies calmly “He consults,”
“Who are you?” Sherlock demands.
“You’re still in your scrubs,” Sherlock said very quietly, they were so close there was no need to speak any louder.
“A jumper,” One of the nurses had told him as he was wrapping up his shift, “On the roof. Causing a bit of a stir,” she’d added as blue lights had flashed past the window, reflecting tiltingly on the vibrant pink of her hair.
“We’ve been over this before. Of course there is evidence.”
Lestrade, already off the radio, nodded his assent and the surrounding figures scattered to their vehicles. Lestrade went one way, Sherlock another, something Lestrade only realised as they both had one foot in different cars.
He looked down at the note.
“So important, you died?”
It was some time therefore before he was able to test out his new (old) freedoms regarding 221 Baker Street, but choosing a time that he knew Mrs Hudson would be out (Tuesday night bingo night at the local Volunteer pub) he finally let himself back in to the murky hallway.
“I’m the detective.”
“A doctor!” Her sunshine mood seems to step up a notch, “No wonder. I could see that you know, you’re the caring type, I can tell. The way you stepped in when I was in such a fix. And offering to help me home! You really would be a right one to look after my Sherlock. If I was the matchmaking kind… I wonder if he would,”
John looks down at his watch, confirms that it has indeed been two hours.
“It was meant politely.”
“You’re a braver man than me…” She turned to reach for it.
“Oh,” The inspector looks a little put out, “Guess that makes sense. They say Sherlock Holmes is a genius, can’t see him getting on the wrong train,”
“How so?”
“Yes, I’ve been expecting him, but I’ve heard nothing.”
“What made you decide to…” Sherlock started, wavered, decided to go on, inarticulately, “Doctor, out there?”
“I seem?” Sherlock asks,
“Yes well,” Sherlock suppressed the urge to squirm, instead, he smoothed the ends of his scarf against his coat. “I’m turning over a new leaf.”
John gives up: “Nevermind.”
John snorts a little in dark amusement, leaning down to inspect the chart. A series of data. No name.
“Not at all,” Sherlock.
Sherlock peered back at her from the sofa.
“Yes…” Sherlock’s turn.
Sherlock stayed silent and they contemplated each other, warily.
“I’ll send uniforms over there now.” Lestrade tells him.
They paused, contemplating each other.
“Not the word I’d use.”
“Were found unhurt, but with no recollection of what had happened to them.” Lestrade.
Knowing there was no chance of going back to sleep he turned carefully, slipping his legs out from under the duvet and standing. The floorboards were painfully cold beneath his feet.
“And where is she now?” It’s not really Sherlock that John’s asking the question of.
Then he looked up the stairs.
“Yes.” He insists, “I’ve seen you before.”
“And when was this exactly?” Lestrade asked.
“You were there.” He almost yells back at him, as if to explain. “A patient. It was here. I woke up, you asked me if I could hear you. Who are you!? What’s happening!?” John seems to have crested the peak of his panic now.
“You’re here!” He cries as he reaches them, his eyes only for John’s date.
“Yes,”
“Or a model?”
“Oh?”
“Look, no offense, but I’d rather not…”
“Probably because it has,” John replied smiling, “They sent you back to the morgue then?”
A pause. John puts away his phone.
“Of course!” Angelo breaks in.
“No consequences, no,” Lestrade quipped, “He didn’t know she’d been dropped by the publicist. Or he’s a very good liar.”
“No, no,” He said on an out-breath,
“John,” Sherlock says again, but doesn’t. This time his mouth doesn’t move.
John considered him, “No.” He answered finally. “No girlfriend.”
“Oh, here.” John leaps to his aide, “Use mine.”
“So is mine,”” Sherlock is frustratingly calm. “It was necessary that I died, it was necessary that you watched me,”
“You look lovely.” John speaks his mind once they are settled.
“No,” John swallows, “A trauma surgeon.”
“Detective Sergeant Donovan, Sherlock Holmes,” Lestrade introduced her as she got within nodding distance.
“I take your point.” Sherlock nods.
Then suddenly he stops. Staring at her. Blinking in surprise.
“I moved your chair.”
“I think it’s time I retired.” Sherlock says, confirming John’s suspicion.
Sugarbowl.
“Things were more,” Sherlock pauses, searching for the right word. “Complicated.”
“Who the hell is he?” John asks, still watching.
John lowers the phone slowly, looking over at the stranger properly.
“… You saw a body on the pavement. Effect. Blood: supplied. Broken: implied…”
A noise downstairs.
“Oh,” There’s a rush of relief in the man’s voice, he sits forward, half rising from his chair. “I…” He starts.
That room fades away.
Molly, sitting behind a desk at one end of the room, looked up at him in surprise.
“People are idiots.” Sherlock replies succinctly.
Perhaps John hasn’t got the talent for consciousness he previously thought. Could he have fallen asleep? Dreamt? Dreamt of words?
“Naturally I couldn’t.”
“Wouldn’t do to be recognised.” The stranger replies.
Lestrade cleared his throat, leaning forward, “Can I ask where you’ve been?”
Sherlock closed his mouth.
And now there was a reply:
All coat and cheekbones and collar. And no scarf.
“Find the words.”
Not a lot had changed in the two years he’d been away: the same four walls, still the shade of dull mint green that seemed ubiquitous with public buildings, the same rack of monitors, the same bed.
“Look, I know…” She started finally with a sigh, but stopped, as if unable to articulate the rest. “Believe me I know.” She breathed out.
The man sat calmly in Mycroft’s favourite leather wing-backed chair by the fireplace, his legs crossed at the knee. His figure was slight and his suit non-descript, but his eyes shone bright with intelligence.
Sherlock stared back at him.
“How do you feel about the violin?” The deep voice of the man John is beginning to suspect he has been brought here to meet breaks back into John’s thoughts.
John shook his head at the tone, then went back to his notebook.
“Although you already know everything there is to know about me.” John counters,
“I could be,” John said.
“I came up here.”
“Yes.”
“Are you sure you’re ok?” John asks again then, through the tense fug in the room.
“So Harry is your wife’s brother?” Lestrade is trying to follow what they’re saying.
“Your bad leg. You favour one over the other,” The man says confidently. “You have a limp?”
“They are.” Sherlock replies.
“Blonde?” John guesses pathetically when Sherlock seems to offer no further explanation.
“You don’t hear from her for four days and you don’t think to tell anyone?”
“And I’m telling you, brother…” Said brother drawls back.
“Yes,” Sherlock answers the question, “In a way,”
“And well, I guess I am, a little,” John muddles on, “Angry, I mean, deep down.” John’s eyes are back on Sherlock’s, “You died. You threw yourself off a building, in front of me. And it hasn’t exactly been easy. Without you…”
“Thank you, Mrs Hudson,” He swept from the room.
Sherlock had left his mouth open with the interruption, he closed it again with a snap. All eyes turned to the boyfriend.
Sherlock looks at him calmly.
Did all that really happen?
She looked back at him expectantly.
On the screen was a picture of a picture: an old-fashioned Polaroid showing the prone body of a young woman stretched out on a burgundy carpet.
“And no cane?” She asked.
“You came in with your brother?” John asks,
“Yes.” Sherlock nodded.
If John thought there had been an awkward pause before, it has nothing against this one.
There we go!
Another new start for that matter.
“Which is?” John asks.
“Meeting someone,” The man continues in response. “I hope.”
John studies him, standing there, the sight of him across the room reminding him of a scene that never really happened.
“I need to go.” He’d not said anything since she’d said the name, the one John had known she was going to say almost the moment that she’d started speaking about him.
He hasn’t spoken it out loud in what feels like a lifetime. Hasn’t needed to. It’s always there. Balanced on the tip of his proverbial tongue. To others it is always “him” or “he”. When he’s alone: “you”. When he speaks to you. When his memories speak to him and he feels he should reply.
“You waited,” John said in awe as they pulled apart,
“So when was the last time you saw your wife Sir?” She asks, sitting beside him, her voice full of professional concern.
John snatches his hand away suddenly.
“I probably still am.” John points out.
“Who did?” She asks,
“And well… she’s an adult”
“It is something of a skill of mine,”
“Nothing! But for this man, I’d have gone to prison.” Angelo again.
“They only let me see you once you were on the ward.”
“You’ve got a psychosomatic limp – of course you’ve got a therapist.”
“My tiny brain will call you,” Lestrade continued in the huffy silence, “If it finds anything,” He rang off.
“But.” John does a vague double take on Sherlock’s words. “But I did.”
“I should get my train.” Sherlock looks uncomfortable,
“I was surprised you were able to come to that conclusion on your own.”
Slowly, gradually, John finds the strength to step sideways and ease himself back into the chair he vacated a lifetime of eleven minutes ago. In that time before. The time when Sherlock was dead.
“John,” Sherlock seems to have found his voice, he speaks with a resolve that matches the heavy look in his astonishing eyes.
“You’re always glad to prove Mycroft wrong.”
“I do have a life.” Lestrade turned to walk away and Sherlock had to hurry to catch him up.
“Hitchcock?”
“You lasted half an hour longer than I expected you would,” Lestrade said, appearing through the door beside him,
“Farringdon,” Lestrade answered immediately, unfazed. “Turnmill Street. Will you come?”
“That’s spiking.” Three paces.
“The rest?”
“Like death.” The patient responds, his voice a low growl.
“So you’re…?” John asks this time,
Sherlock visibly winces “Yes.”
“I mean, you’re on your own…” The conversation falling back to him, John finds himself floundering again. “I mean. You live alone?” John mangles a cover.
“What are you doing out there?” Mrs Hudson’s voice called from inside her flat, followed almost immediately by her door opening.
She’s leaving her bags and heading straight upstairs to tell him she’s back.
“What do you mean?” John’s words are slow. He’s running through options in his mind and beginning to put together the pieces. Fear blooms faintly in the pit of his stomach, laced with something else; that bitter grip of adrenaline. He wets his lips.
The amplified voice manages to sound both calm and desperate in equal measure.
“Can I help you?” An authoritative male voice said firmly behind him and Sherlock dropped John’s hand as if it burned, spinning to find Mike Stamford standing in the doorway.
“Any post?” He asked instead, mainly to distract her but also because she’d reminded him.
“Don’t forget your scarf,” Mrs Hudson rushed, a little overcome with the goodbyes,
“What do you mean?” Lestrade asks,
“No…” John says, his denial is an agreement.
Of course he could summon those words. Spoken in a voice he’s heard in a dream he won’t admit to having.
“You’ve no idea!” Mike replies in a Geordie accent, John’s words seem to have pleased him.
“Whoever it is doesn’t realise you’ve moved out,” Mrs Hudson was saying calmly, somewhere above his awareness. She was holding them out to him as if they were nothing more than paper. They were nothing more than paper.
“Any time Sherlock.” Angelo replies with feeling. “Anything on the menu, whatever you want, free!”
The room behind it was like stepping back in time. Everything was the same: the chairs, the coffee table, the bison skull on the wall. John wasn’t sure what he’d been expecting: perhaps that cold, empty room he’d seen last year, certainly not this.
“But you don’t know why you’re here,” Sherlock announces.
But the position John has pulled them into can’t be comfortable for Sherlock. He shifts beneath John’s touch, that marble moving, limbs finding a more natural position on the floor.
Sherlock wasn’t looking at him, he was standing looking up at the building they’d just left.
“You need to...” Sherlock started, but she cut him off.
“It’s August.” Sherlock pointed out.
“I’m thinking that that man has all the charisma of a wet tea-towel, no wonder her people didn’t want her associated with him.”
“Your grief made that possible John.”
“You do know?” John’s words are so low he half wonders if he said them aloud, the question only half formed. “You should know. If you don’t, you should.”
“That seems to be the pattern.”
“Visiting hours tend to be ignored for the partners of patients.”
“Spike drinks?”
“I believed in you.” John’s response.
“You’ll…?” The inspector starts to ask,
John’s phone begins to ring in his pocket.
“Well,” Sherlock says moments later as they stand awkwardly facing each other on the platform.
“John,” Sherlock repeats, “Can you hear me?”
John goes back to staring down the abysmal coffee in front of him. The stranger’s attention on the street outside.
“What do they usually say?”
“He told you?” She seems surprised.
“I don’t know.”
“Pointless.”
He crossed to the window and looked down at the street, still light, despite the latening hour.
“It had more to do with the beer.”
“You…” John starts, stops.
“You were home from leave.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know that now! But I couldn’t, couldn’t find…”
“Yes.”
John blinked at it.
“Fewer now.”
“And I know that’s why you’re out here.” Sherlock said gently. “And not in there.” He motioned back to the party without breaking eye contact.
“Why?”
“I guess.”
He’d not been there.
The crime scene was boring. Again. Sherlock had grown tired of it within minutes, the details so horrendously obvious that he was regretting even approaching the body. It showed weakness, he could have solved it from the doorway.
“Yes.”
“Let us just say it’s currently particularly important that I keep a low profile.”
A full minute passed in silence. The paper remained where it was.
John speaks: “Where have you been?”
Sherlock doesn’t reply.
“And that’s why you’re leaving London?”
“Not a lot.” She stopped them in front of a room that looked exactly like every other that they’d passed. “Wanted to speak to him.” The officer nodded in Sherlock’s direction.
“I’m, yes, I didn’t…” John feels dazed all of a sudden. “I thought I heard…”
“…that there has been no obvious evidence of improvement.” Mycroft ignores him.
“Can I ask why?” John asks.
“It seems so.”
“Not yet, but I’ve got someone for us to speak to. The boyfriend,” Lestrade rattled off an address.
“Then…” Sherlock cut in, but was interrupted in turn by Lestrade, who moved forward to stand beside him.
“You said you believed in me.”
“Yes,” John says, closing his eyes. Feeling sleep curl up around them. “Against the rest of the world.”
“Oh Sherlock, are all these yours?” She asked, stepping back and running her eyes over the boxes currently blocking the Baker Street pavement,
Lestrade opened his mouth to respond but was immediately distracted, as was Sherlock, by a skinny, middle-aged man in pink trousers walking very quickly towards them.
Sherlock breaks their kiss suddenly. Lips not moving more than a breath away from John’s.
“Not more than I am,” John chuckles; he’s closed his eyes, savouring Sherlock’s deep voice.
“If a man blogs and there is no one around to read, is he really a blogger?”
“None have been found dead.” Sherlock rescues him, bluntly.
“You were?”
“He’s a director.”
“Free booze,” Molly replied sagely.
“You’re glad to be home?” Sherlock asked when the silence stretched longer than even he was comfortable with.
The lift arrived and they stepped inside. Lestrade pressed the button for the fourth floor. They stood in awkward silence while they ascended.
“What did he look like?” John asked tightly.
They were sitting in the small green space in front of St Bart’s, enjoying a moment of peace with their sandwiches away from the madness of the hospital.
“Yes.” Sherlock replies.
“Global warming,” John agreed, turning to smile at her. Much to John’s surprise they’d become tentative friends since that first day. Her gentle smile was one that never failed to lift his mood; helping to iron out the jagged edges of his bad days and soften the memories when they threatened. She was also refreshingly forthright when it came to asking to spend time with him, which it turned out he needed.
“That you’re not.” John closes his eyes against the pacing again, behind his eyelids it’s as if he can still see the dark undulating against the pale.
“This doesn’t seem like the time to be polite.”
“What was the fight about?”
They meet in a lift.
“I need to go.” John said abruptly,
Another stop, this time a long one. They contemplate each other across the blank concrete space, the two paces between them yawning as large and dangerous as the void at Sherlock’s back.
“You know who we are?” Mycroft’s voice implies he’s managed to get a lid on his astonishment. He doesn’t appear to have changed, John would probably say Mycroft is wearing the same well-tailored suit as the last time he saw him, the same umbrella tucked by the handle over his arm.
The response appeared in exactly the time it took John to pace the length of the hallway and back, as if his correspondent were doing the same.
“No…” Sherlock says in a way that makes it sound he means the opposite.
John stares back at him.
Mrs Hudson, prevented politely from actually accompanying them from the hospital, meets them on the pavement in front as Sherlock helps John from the taxi. Much to John’s chagrin he’s having to use a cane again, leaning heavily on the other leg than before. It’s a sensation that is both alien and familiar in equal measure.
“Pavement. Blood”
“I wanted to believe this would happen.”
John nods to himself a little.
He blinks in the unaccustomed light, objects slowly shifting into focus. He’s awoken propped up on an unfamiliar bed, the beep and hum of the machines by his side echoing the distant dull throb in his head. Hospital then.
“Why do you say that?” He asks.
“You,”
They’re soft. Their press firm and gloriously responsive. This time there is no awkward stillness as Sherlock controls his surprise. This time from the moment their mouths connect they are on fire. They both want this, they’ve both, in different ways, been waiting for it.
“Which is it – Afghanistan or Iraq?”
John hasn’t heard him: “The bed, the duvet. Your scarf and…”
John sighs; deep and heavy.  Sherlock is still looking at him.
“We had a fight.” The man admitted. “She told me she couldn’t stand the sight of me, said she needed to get away for a bit.” The man looked nervously between Lestrade and Sherlock.
“Okay.”
The look Sherlock gives him in response to that laugh is one of pure confusion; it makes John’s grin wider and his grip on Sherlock’s cheek firmer. John holds it there for a moment, just watching, until he uses those anchored fingertips to draw Sherlock closer to him, capturing those ridiculous lips in a kiss.
“Look it wasn’t…”
Today seemed to be a day for remembering. He’d been a long time pouring over the letters, finally rising and making his way back toward ITU when the words started to blur on the page.
“Not that he’ll admit it.”
But once on the platform, John wasn’t difficult to spot.
John coughs back a laugh.
“But you’re not.”
“And in the event that you won’t tell me this.” Moran continues, ignoring him, “I would like you to provide the means for my finding him on my own.”
“Haven’t decided.”
A pause.
“I can’t remember,” John’s eyes are only on Sherlock. “You were there. I met you. You were in the park. With Mrs Hudson. You offered me a seat on the tube.”
“You’re up early,” A brisk voice behind him and Sherlock turned in surprise, a piece of toast gripped between his teeth. Mycroft was standing on the threshold.
“Yes.” The stranger says firmly and shifts slightly.
The stranger offers them nothing but vague disinterest, sitting himself down again with his back turned toward them.
Bright lights under a dark sky, the twinkle of Christmas decorations and the gentle sound of carols bathed in the sweet scent of mulled wine.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock was standing in the middle of a crime scene holding a piece of paper out in front of him. Police officers moved around him like he was a rock in the current.
“Where do I fit in?”
John fidgeted with his cufflinks, a little embarrassed by the effort he’d made. He must have tried almost everything in his wardrobe before he’d settled on what to wear. He regretted the shirt.
“I certainly hope so, Sir” John replied, grunting a little as the bars on the bed took the weight his cane usually bore,
But now he had proof; he’d not told Sherlock what it was that he had left behind on that platform all those years ago. He’d told him nothing of the battered old book and how much the stories inside had kept his spirits up, kept him sane, as he’d passed that strange time between deployments.
“Makes you wonder, doesn’t it?”
“Ah,” Moriarty was the one to break it, still not looking up, “Here we are at last. You and me, Sherlock, and our problem,”
John feels sofa cushions beneath his tired limbs. He hears the noises of Baker Street below him: the traffic washing by, footsteps, the floating sound of voices. And he sees the ghost of memories, crowding into the room around him:
“Oh,” John says in the face of more information than we was expecting. “I’m assuming you don’t mean shooting the walls literally?”
They all laughed. Sherlock, assuming the woman they referred to must be Mike’s wife, silently agreed.
John closes his eyes to rest his mind against the information he’s received. What is real and what isn’t. What happened and what didn’t.
“Yes.” Sherlock admits, “When you were first admitted.”
“And now, now, well you’re alive. And it was ‘
There’s a pause before the man replies.
He looked at his watch. He still had time.
“Yes, you’ve not told me why…” John starts, Sherlock ignores him.
“What does?” Lestrade asked from his seat.
But not the one in Farringdon.
They stared at each other.
“Oh,” John is still dazed. “Oh, right.”
there,” John confirms, “In my dreams. You kept asking me to wake up, to come back.”
“That I what?” Sherlock slowed his pacing and focused his attention on John, trying to deduce an unchanging memory, yet forgetting for an instant that this John could only exude cues Sherlock’s mind created.
Mary was quiet then leaned up and spoke with hesitation, “I have a friend. She might help. She is very close to this and will probably be on our side anyway, but I will put in a good word. Can’t hurt.”
"Short jokes? I am doing this, why, again? Now, to the surviving part. Any actual plans for that or should I just order a bouquet?"
He’d smiled at her, just the way she’d always liked, and replied, “Only his naughty bits, it was your contribution that made him dazzling.”
Story Title: The 5th Perdition of John
"Because you're an idiot. This is not a lock up in the MET, John. These people know what they are doing. I can barely get around."
“You have to forgive her.”
Sherlock and just John.
“ I never said he was alive, I said he was back.”
John kept pace with him and said clearly but in a much lower tone, "But, I also learned that they hide things from you because they don't want to look bad in your eyes. And that leads to a lot of stupid delays and mistakes while everyone rushes around passing blame instead of doing their job. That's stressful for you and you have every right to yell, but it just makes them all act that way more."
Mycroft cleared his throat and attempted polite observation, “Your treatments are going well.  I was quite certain his devotion to you was pointless. Feared how this would all turn out.  Yet here we are and most importantly…here you are.” His eyes danced with amused wonder.  “Welcome back.”
Mycroft, was in some ways, glad that John had not been recovered from the water so far. He dreaded his brother being unable to part with, well,
Rat had never made this information easy, but he hadn’t covered his trail with such impenetrable force that his son could not follow the compass and adjust to true north.  On the day that Sherlock had made his international headlines and Rat had been in cover far too deep to impose upon his own resources to determine the merit of Sherlock’s demise, Rat had experienced such profound grief that he’d blown his operation.
John's past becomes his final problem. Can John face Sherlock knowing that he indeed never was a very nice man, but a wolf in a wooly jumper?
The evidence before him sickened him. Molly Hooper's ancestry spoke volumes. Molly's father was Harold Hooper, a boxer in his youth. He later became a supposed fisherman, who had ties with smugglers in the early seventies. He had appeared on several government watch lists but never been convicted of any crime. His wife's illness had brought about his apparent retirement from his supposed illegal career goals. His final days were spent as the proprietor of a small fish and chip shop. The wife was actually the most solid connection.
"Get the fuck out."
What would have happened if John had simply let himself fall and said let the consequences be damned?  They would not be here right now.  They may have even found themselves shagged out and blissfully feeling pity for the loveless lot.
He knew he had treated her abominably, and he knew she would never forgive him. She would not tell on him either. She would not play the woman scorned and reveal he was alive to anyone ever again. It would probably cross her mind, and if Sherlock were the only thing betrayal would render of consequence, at this point, she might tend her bitter stew long enough to seek revenge.
Lost like him. Lost like Sherlock.
Upstairs thumps and knocks can be heard. Mrs. Hudson glared upward and shook her head in disgust. "Still up there poking around. John was such a private boy. He would have hated this. That man has a screw loose somewhere, and I don't care who he thinks he is," Martha Hudson says in a loud whisper.
Rushing up the stairs he found a swollen gasping creature wearing Sherlock's hair and a suit bedazzled with stingers and alive with bees still struggling with the dismount.  It was something out of a horror movie and just as he thought this, a sodden bee crawled out of Sherlock's mouth.
He gives her a few minutes and then she leans back and dries her tears, numb and shattered. "He went with Sherlock," she said in a very small voice. She covered her mouth and shook her head, realising she shouldn't have let that slip.
Sherlock no longer took cases.  He only had one now.  His experiments revolved around researching how to help his John.  He could not lose this battle.  Technology was infinite and the new puzzle was finding the right combination to spark the activity in John’s brain.  To break through the darkness and bring some part of his friend home was his only goal.
John’s eyes had met his former commanders for a split second and yet he had not shouted for help or made any gesture that said he acknowledged his presence.  His eyes had filled with tears and he’d closed them as he spoke,  “Your sister likes my cock better than any of yours and as soon as you little bastards get done, I’ll be giving her a knock up.”
"I love her very much. I just, loved a dead man more and she really caught on once we were married. I evidently dreamed in embarrassing detail. Out loud."
"We each have to find our own motive."
"He's making me leave in three days. I should be gone now. Every moment I waste here, I am letting someone else down. I have to go. Without you. You will be killed. How is that not the end?"
“What is it? What are you not saying? It’s not all good is it?” John demanded.
Four hours later, Sherlock appeared at Mycroft's desk, smirking. "This should accomplish more than you hoped. They were both arrogant and spoke quite freely. Now where is he? I have yelling to pretend to listen to and I want to get it over as quickly as possible." Sherlock says rolling his neck and rubbing his left shoulder.
“And Magnussen wants him more than ever before?” Sherlock folded his hands and closed his eyes.
Tell everyone, I am a fake, a fraud. Did that really mean… Because if you don't believe in me, I don't care what any of the rest of the world thinks. Let them scourge my name for all time, because you picked what you wanted the most, John. You wanted to blend and be mediocre. You wanted to be with them and not me. So be it.
They read her flash drive as soon as Sherlock was lucid. Of course they read it, they were not idiots. The information was bad, but their imaginations had quickly gone toward far worse places then reality. They trickled information to Mycroft, and he trickled confirmation that the information she’d given was subjectively accurate.
Sherlock’s phone pinged and he smiled, “That’s good enough, Billy. Our Guest has just RSVP’d.”
One song would end and John would open his eyes at once, begging with no words for more. Sherlock acquiesced aloofly the first time. But as the evening moon climbed high, a small smile appeared. There were no words sweeping the room as the two men grew to be friends.
"Please. I need a light. I want to see you," she whispered and it sounded louder than she'd meant it to.
“For this person, at her request, not even for Mary’s safety alone, your wife came out of retirement, for a singular assignment. The operation we interrupted had been planned long before she became involved with you. She was under strict orders to leave no witnesses. She went to great lengths to perform her task without resorting to any extra victims. But, it was unforeseeable that Plan A would be interrupted by plan B and neither knew of the others participation. Multiple simultaneous operations are a standard procedure and on occasion, there is crossfire.”
“There was no code and he’d failed to get my son to help him.  He didn’t make Sherlock fake his death.  He gave him the choice to die with him, which in his mind would be almost as chillingly evocative.  He left behind a mystery.  Why would a man like him end tragically on a roof in London?   With his disgraced, once heroic, adversary?  Was it a lovers spat?  Who killed whom and why?  What would become of his legacy?  Was he Moriarty or Brook?  Don’t you see?  All the attention you so bitterly hate, he craved.  A hundred years from now they would still be dragging it threw the trenches of supposed new details and theories.  My family name would again be forever tied to a mad genius and shamed before the crown.  The Holmes family has survived such attention and sensational tragic rhetoric in the past.”
"Not as far from you mind or your heart as you claim, John. I hoped you still cared enough to help me intervene on his behalf. I did think you would be a bit more of a recruitment challenge considering what it meant. I had all sorts of grand words to talk you into this adventure. Perhaps you missed me more than you care to admit as well."
There was silence for a moment.  “A Rat Bastard. Left me here to die.” The man said with good cheer.
“He was always just like you,” She’d softly murmered as a complaint but truly meant as a compliment.
"No you didn't. I used to think you got off on putting your life in danger. Getting suspicious that it's my life you in fact enjoy testing."
He followed the soldier and quietly directed him to put the nine boxes in the corner.  He gestured for it to be done quietly so as not to disturb Sherlock.  John returned to his chair, not opening a single box. He would deal with them when Sherlock was awake.  Make him deduce what was in them or something to keep him occupied peacefully for a few minutes.
"Say it?" Sherlock demanded.
"Demand 30.  Video is harder to fake so it is worth more.  Bidding war could get 10 more if you try," Sherlock said.
He freezes in a half stance, eyes wide and confidence shattering at this vision before him. He's made an angel cry. John Watson is certain he must be growing fangs and horns, because to have forced tears of sorrow from Sherlock, would take the power of a monster.
John met his eyes, missing nothing yet asking him to explain with a politely curious tilt of his head and the slight narrowing of his eyes as if trying to see Mycroft closer. Mycroft never burst forth in a room. John realized at once that his demeanor was far elevated beyond any point he'd ever seen.
John described Sherlock, "He was a lot like you really, more brilliant, no offence, but that is probably why he and I hit it off so quickly. I never considered the similarities of him and me vs. you and I and I probably should have. Frankly, I think he was a lifeline and his need to be taken care of led me to misunderstand the dynamics of the friendship. I think that it was a one-sided fiasco."
He’d taken chances to implement the measures that had resulted in his son taking the point in the clan of ravens, but Mycroft was an asset to the crown by his own right.  Rat had provided opportunities for Mycroft to achieve, but he’d rarely been disappointed with the boy’s sharp grasp of subtle political games or the art of intimidation.
He had no idea how long he walked after his interesting encounter. The sun was painting long shadows and he was drawn to turn onto Baker Street, the place where it may matter. The music pulled him. It moaned of his own heart, so filled with emptiness and so full of glorified sorrow. He paused below the window as a bloke slammed the door and crumpled a piece of pink paper and threw it on the ground with a comment of, "Stupid git."
"What was…"
Autumn leaves with the grace of John Oh. God. Sherlock. Why.
He needed to find his phone. But, then a sob bubbled from him as he tried to make his mind settle on what was real and what might be just a dream. He thought he was leaving Baker Street, someone had spoiled his plans. He had been dreaming something about Sherlock again. "Sherlock?" he said softly but he was too tired to wait for a response.
"No. Of course not. It was unnecessary. You responded to the…"
Realm: Sherlock
Chapter 2
Sherlock flicked to the last song played.
"No, actually. He's only been reported missing. Foul play is suspected, but I certainly won't be showing up announcing myself with a public funeral for a man who has so many complicated facets."
Sherlock reviewed his notes and yes if there was any form of being that could hear the electrical impulses of his mind, they would have heard a litany of pathetic begging on John Watson’s behalf.  Sherlock had little faith in the sort of nonsense the religions claimed, yet he did believe in something indefinably more and panic had somehow added a sort of wishing well mentality in Sherlock’s mind palace.  It couldn’t be called prayer, but it wasn’t unlike that activity either.
"Oh. Bit slow then, overall?" John deadpans.
Again.
"Sure. You always say, leave them laughing. And the suicide is a joke, hopefully, if my decrepit old wanker of a commanding officer doesn't muck it up too much, so why not," John said with a shrug and a grin that indicated he is resigned to this plan and now he's just going to go into his classic approach of soldier-on-a-lark mode.
John kept secretly hoping that Sherlock would happen to catch his eye again and tried to imagine what Sherlock’s reaction would be, no matter how terrible that would turn out, John still longed to see something on his mad detective’s face even if it were rage, duplicity and shocked arrogance.
The darkness was broken with several great beams of white and all the wounded terrified people nearby naturally began reaching out to the only authority in this darkened hell.  That was when the shots began to drum wild staccato and the tide of mournful shadows reversed as they realized their mistake.  But they didn’t have time to save themselves because those of the light, swept their retching sticks at the mass of human turmoil and the victims danced pirouettes and the rhythms of disjointed butchers song.
“You should have stopped this.”
"I assume you wish for me to see to their removal?" Mycroft stated more than asked.
"Guaranteed to fail," John automatically finishes the vaunting old joke Tiger had always said before contact. It wasn't particularly funny, due to the fact it was somewhat true. John realized he was now on the wrong side of his former brother and his former best-friend was also planning to confront Tiger, which made the joke clang with the tone of a bell on a sunken ship. "Oh God. Sherlock's going to get himself killed. He has no chance against him. He has no idea what Tiger can do. None at all." John leans forward, defeated and his abdominal muscles randomly quake in trepidation for Sherlock.
John took a deep breath and held it.  He sucked half his lip between his teeth and worried at it a moment.  "I am sorry, but I do.  Has to be said.  I am not what the jumpers and tea tin says Sherlock.  I want to be that guy that you think I am and she thought I was...but...the day I beat you for something you did not do, changed that.  Not only did I intend to put you in the hospital...I think I tried to kill you.  I want to deny that, I have run it through my head a million times...but I cannot pretend I would have stopped.
