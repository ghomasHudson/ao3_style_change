"Sorry, sorry, bad idea. Let's just take a shower and get out of here."
The time dragged out and John fidgeted, playing with his fingers and squirming. He wasn't alone. The technical challenges were stressful, and contestants were talking amongst themselves to pass time. Greg wandered over to John's station.
Greg looked into the worried faces of his friends and shook his head. "Not at all."
“John…”
“That’s alright, dear. No bother.” She went back into her flat and John went outside. His anger had fizzled into a rough simmer of annoyance and he paced up the street.
John licked a stripe across his chest back to the left one. Pain and pleasure blazed through Sherlock’s brain and it felt like everything was short circuiting in a wonderful miasma of sparks and grinding gears.
“What are you doing?” He asked.
wasn’t! He didn’t want another crap dom in his life to push him around. To hurt him. To call him names and keep him from doing his cases just because he could. What had Betsy and Mike called it? They had said Seb was manipulative. That was the word they used. When Sherlock told Betsy how Seb would blame him for his bad days at work, or claim that anything that went wrong around the flat was Sherlock’s fault, they said it was manipulation but Sherlock wasn’t sure. Seb was mercurial at best, even on good days…
with joy and confidence. They both did. John’s limp hadn’t bothered him in weeks. Sherlock had mellowed out too and was far less abrasive than he’d been four months ago. John was actually happy for the first time in a long time and it was all because of Sherlock and hopefully,
“Does it,” John cleared his throat. “Sorry, is there a coordinating leash?”
John licked his lips. It had to be him. His signature was decent, but his technical had been meh and his showstopper was crap. Sherlock was beside John, literally on the edge of his seat as Mel spoke.
The phone beeped again. Another text from Mycroft containing an address for a house just up the road. John bit the inside of his cheek and slid his phone into his pocket. He strode out into the foyer and grabbed his jacket.
doing better. He could feel it and see it in the way Ella reacted to his answers. He really only had energy right now for a cold beer on the sofa and a football game. Sherlock at his feet wouldn’t be unwelcome either.
“I love you, John.” He sighed. The doctor froze. Sherlock didn’t say the L-word very much. Not unprompted. He always said it back to John, but it was rare that he’d say so himself first.
“I’m starved.” Mike said once the waiter collected their menus and left. “It was busy today. Midterms are nigh. The kids are terrified.” Mike smirked and put his phone on the table.
“John…” Sherlock licked his lips and ground himself into John’s denim-covered jeans.
“Thank you.” John said sincerely. He opened his bag and Sherlock left the room. He wanted to check his website email, see if anything interesting had come in. He also wanted to make notes in his database. Tonight had been filled with all sorts of new information.
A nod.
“I’d love it.”
“He’s younger than you.” Sherlock continued, glancing at the body.
"Yes. I understand."
“Is your Defense over?” He asked, saving the document and closing it. The doctor had lost the ‘angry badass predator’ look he had going on before, and now he just looked like his normal army doctor, contradictions and light-focusing abilities and all, in a jumper.
John followed his recipe very carefully. He even said the steps out loud to himself as he did them. He added his yeast to the flour and sugar along with the water. He put it all in the mixer and let the dough hook do its thing. He chewed his lip as it mixed, fingers crossed that this would work.
"A rotting toe nail would be a better king than James Moriarty." Sherlock declared.
“Not tonight. Clothes off and kneel.” John instructed. Sherlock pouted but he tossed his gown to the chair in the corner and knelt up on the bed. John unwound each bundle, taking his time to let the varying textures slip through his fingers, soft and sensual and cool and slick like velvet water between his fingers. His cock was interested again, seeing Sherlock nude and feeling the soft ropes in his hands had jerked it stiff and eager again. He loved tying up his submissives—he loved it even more when they were as keen as Sherlock was now. Every sub he’d ever tied up relished it in just a slightly different way. Faster breaths, slower breaths, a deep flush across the neck, fingers dancing in excitement or soft little moans. He had one sub once who could orgasm just from being bound up a certain way. Every experience was unique but familiar and John loved all of it. The multiple types ropes though—that was new. Leave it to Sherlock to turn it into an experiment.
“Come on.” John helped him up and they mutually slipped under the blankets. Sherlock curled into him, wrapping his arms around his ribs and burying his face in his shoulder, sliding his leg between his dom’s knees.
“Get out, Mycroft.” John hissed.
“Did you just call me a
“Hey, love.” He greeted. “Ready to go soon?” They kissed and Sherlock firmly ignored the envelope and his stupid arse old dom.
commenting on how Ramsay was a“mean fuckin’ bastard” before he’d light up. Sherlock drew his coat tighter. He hadn’t had any in ages, but he wasn’t totally clean by any means. He just didn’t use when it suited him. He liked to think he had complete control over his addiction, and anyway, he hadn’t had a case big enough to warrant cocaine in ages. Seb had made him want to use. Seb and his…mannerisms. It had been months since he'd laid eyes on his old dom but he was a slow healer, and the years of Seb's wounding had gone deep. Sherlock remembered the last thing the man had said to him.
“Um, uh…” John looked at the five chain and leather leashes dangling from her hands. One stood out. It was the same grey color, a good length, and studded in the center every eight inches or so with a silver circle. The lining of the adjustable handle was the same silk as the collar lining.
“Thank you.” Sherlock touched the leather and John looked at him adoringly.
"Dammit, Mycroft! What about things I need? Samples for my experiments, what if I need to talk to my contacts in town?"
“I want to keep going.” Sherlock said.
Sherlock sat beside him. “Last night?”
They rode it out and slowed, John giving him a few more languid thrusts before he eased out and settled down on Sherlock’s semen and sweat-soaked belly. Their hard breaths filled the air and the whole room smelled of sweat and sex and musk.
“I know. It’ll come together. It always does.”
Sherlock was behind him, his mouth open in shock and delight. Greg had never seen him so surprised.
No, of course not. You lot never do.”
"Because you're a sub. You shouldn't be forced to top your own stupid dom. Do you, I mean, you don’t know how."
“Obvious.” Sherlock took John’s hand, turning it over to reveal faint rope marks on his wrist. “I’m familiar with these marks myself.” He said. John swallowed. “And the new bottle of pills makes it clear as well.”
“Yes. I think so.”
"Yes!" He said. "I may not be the most affectionate of people but I know that this is different. This is, this is
Sherlock did and John pushed the gown aside and tugged the left side of his sweats and pants down. His bum cheek was bruised but not as purple as his back.
“What do you have planned for me, Captain?” Sherlock asked. John smiled down at his array of items.
“I’m loose enough.” Sherlock said, resting his head happily on his forearms. “There’s already lube there.”
At seven pm they arrived at Mike and Betsy’s flat complex. They were each dressed in jeans and buttoned shirts. Sherlock had wanted to John to stay in the suit, but John had reasoned that not only would a three piece suit be way too formal for dinner at an old friend’s flat, but the suit was covered in both their sweat and needed a wash. Sherlock relented in the face of logic with a small pout.
Mycroft raised a brow at Sherlock. Crumbs were falling off the cake onto the thousand year old oak table. Sherlock chewed, sucked his teeth of jelly, and stared at his King.
“That we did.” Vincent said. He set his whiskey down and moved over until he was sitting beside Sherlock on the sofa. “We had all sorts of fun together.” Vincent said, brushing a few curls behind Sherlock’s ear. “How’d you like a tour of my home?”
John poured fresh water in the kettle and turned it on. His heart quivered when Sherlock wiped some residual dampness from his eyes. He didn’t regret that hiding, but he hated having to discipline his sub. He went to the cabinet and took down the tea box and Sherlock followed, one hand on his waist. The kettle boiled and John took down two mugs from the shelf. Sherlock idly cupped and touched his ribs and bottom. John’s protective dominance swelled as Sherlock touched him and stayed near and he knew they’d be spending the rest of the evening very close together. Fine with him. He chucked a teabag in each mug and poured boiling water over them both. Sherlock watched over his shoulder, stroking his dom’s hip as the bags steeped. He was being very quiet and John took that as a good sign. If he was really having a problem with anything going on John knew he would be hearing about it. Hell, the neighbors and Mrs. Hudson would be hearing about it. He threw the teabags in the sink and added sugar and milk as needed.
Sherlock kept to himself, usually. Any diplomatic duties he did with a sense of obligation and though he excelled in strategy and diplomacy (not as much as his brother, but still), he sought out his own company not because he detested others, despite what he said. She knew that it was because it was too easy for him to care too much. He locked himself away in that fortress inside his head and kept everyone at bay. He never wanted anyone to get too close so he'd never get hurt. He'd allowed Victor to stick his foot in the door. And that stable lad he thought he had been secretive  about…
“Restaurant receipts,” Sherlock continued. He pulled a soaked purple cardboard card out of the wallet and looked at it.
He moved his hand back to the headboard and moaned, clenching his cheeks around John’s fingers.
Switches were obviously different. John wasn’t hard set into one single dynamic the way he was. He hadn’t anticipated that John would possibly want to sub while they were together. And sub for who? Did he have a dom? He didn’t like the thought of that at all. Could he take care of it himself with some self bondage? Sherlock knew all about techniques to indulge one’s dynamic alone. He wondered if he could help John, or give him some pointers.Or even…he could try. He could try domming. Would John accept? Would he get upset Sherlock was even offering? He worried at his lip and carefully got out of bed, leaving and closing the door gently.
"You don't need to be so formal." Sherlock drawled. "I think we've had enough conversation to put us past that tediousness." Sherlock had no real reason to bring John up here other than he wanted the company. He asked, "have you anymore ideas about the arrow? Can you add anything to your list?
“Take away.” Sherlock told her. They grabbed their bags of food a few minutes later and took it upstairs.
John was impressed. “And this?” He touched the hard bit at the very end of his elbow.
John rolled his eyes fondly. “Yes he does.”
"Who's John?" Mike asked carefully.
“Is there another entrance?”
“No.” John’s voice was tired and rough. His leg was still hurting. “Couldn’t. Didn’t want to hurt you again.”
“Let me.” John kissed him and lifted the shirt, mindful of the medical tape. He tossed it aside, then slid his sub’s trousers down. He pulled the socks off and stood before his naked sub, eying the bandages. “He hurt you.” John growled. His hands clenched and his cock stiffened. He growled and the hairs on his neck stood up.
John sounded worried and nearly out of breath.
Ten. Nine.
"I'll be alright, Molly."
“What about clothes pins?” John asked.
saw that. And the sitting room was littered with the crop and the lube and the cuffs. John’s mortification increased before he realized in an instant that actually? He didn’t care if Mycroft saw. So he was sleeping with Sherlock. Nothing wrong with that. And so they liked to be adventurous in the bedroom. John planned on being here for the long run so it was best Mycroft become comfortable with the idea of his little brother getting smacked and cuffed and plugged. John grinned, pulling his pants and jeans on, along with a fresh shirt.
“Oh for God’s sake.” Mycroft opened the other curtain and then went into the kitchen, lifting the shade. Sherlock lay there, listening to him pour something from the tap before he walked back into the room.
“Relax.” John told him, petting broad swipes over his side from hip to shoulder. “Settle.”
“So…?”
She smiled. "But I hope."
John considered, then grabbed his timer and adjusted it down to thirty. He could always leave it in longer, but why would Sherlock try to help him? This was a competition, after all.
“Did they catch the murderer?” John asked.
"Obsessive is good. Paul and Mary like obsessive. Obsessive poppers."
The doctor popped his hand across his arse. “You are acting like a brat.”
He closed his eyes. His brain was buzzing and nausea roiled through his stomach from the adrenaline of the chase and roll down the concrete corners. A cool breeze chilled him and he wished for his Belstaff, hanging in the flat. He didn't anticipate that this venture would take so long. He crouched on the ground, wanting John's warm capable fingers and soothing voice. He pulled out his phone and tapped the button. The screen remained blank. Dead. He swore and shoved it back in his pocket
Sherlock grabbed his hair and pulled, growling when a few strands
Sherlock nodded very fast and turned the page. This held a more detailed illustration of the fungi on the previous pages. “Mum n’ dad say it’s disgusting.” Sherlock said.
"I'm here." He grunted. He got his feet, carefully, and stood. His left thigh was sore from his less-than-perfect landing and his elbow was throbbing. He must have bashed it when he hit the ground. All in all though, no broken bones. No broken head either.
John nodded. She was right. That was good.
Sherlock settled back on his lap, his hard cock jammed on John’s thigh. His bottom was pink and rosy from the pats and petting and John gave him a harder slap, then a harder one, then one harder than that. Sherlock clenched his cheeks and jerked a little bit with each slap.
“Did Jeff work with many other doms?”
you so awful to him?”
She handed two over. “What’s he doing up there?”
“What? No, nothing.”
John paced in his cell. It was tiny. There was a bucket in the corner that stank horribly. A torch in the wall outside the cell flickered and crackled and gave off an oily smell and weak light. His jaw and hands were aching badly and he wished they'd have unbound him before throwing him in here.
“Anthony is gone.”
After that, Sherlock spent more time in the infirmary. He liked to sit in the corner near the crackling brazier, reading the stacks of textbooks in Mike’s library. Between the medical books and the violin lessons he started that year, he was rarely so bored. He did, however, continue to suffer from an overabundance of nerves and anxiety.
Sherlock couldn't stop his mind from straying to the unassuming man, the way the firelight had glinted off his hair, the way he looked so determined yet so sad, his respectful posture, the pitch of his voice. Sherlock's thoughts typically spiraled around former cases and potential experiments but somehow now everything circled back to John. Why? What was different? One of his best things was the ability to ignore other people completely. John though had gotten under his skin, had insinuated himself into Sherlock's mind palace as easily as if he'd been invited inside. Rather than be annoyed, Sherlock found it helplessly maddening. It was like John had put a spell on him.
Sally paused, then asked, "are you well, your Highness?"
“Sherlock.” John snapped. “Why are you on the floor?”
A few moments later Mycroft's footsteps approached the bedside.
“No, I mean it! Oh John!” Sherlock whirled around and kissed him and this John was very amenable to.
“Yes.” He smirked at him. “C’mon, did you think I would kick you out? Break up with you? If you remember, you’re moving in tomorrow.”
“Ah.” Greg nodded. As a dom, he took no offense. He knew Sherlock well enough to let his insults pass right by. “Did you…I mean, was it…him?” Greg winced internally at the broken question. He didn’t know much about what had happened with Sherlock’s past. He knew he had a dom, and that dom wasn’t going to win the “best boyfriend ever” award. He didn’t know exactly how far it went but one day, after a crime scene where Sherlock was being especially persnickety and caustic, Greg had seen the detective speaking with a friendly looking, heavy set man who Sherlock had referred to as Mark or Mike or such. Greg didn’t hear what they said, but Sherlock had seemed slightly more relaxed after their conversation. Good. Whoever he was, Greg liked him. The coffee finished and he poured some into a foam cup.
“Hands behind you. Clasp your fingers.”
“John?” Sherlock’s voice was hesitant.
“Hm.” Sherlock raised an approving brow. “I do a little baritsu.” He said.
“There we are,” Mycroft put the cup down and gave his little brother a fake smile, “back with the living.” He sniffed daintily and grimaced. “You still smell of submissive. You should bathe.”
“Wonderful.” She smiled. “A dom or sub?”
“The attendants will deal with them.” Molly said in a dismissive voice.
“I think cheetah print would look nice on your skin.”
John launched into the mantra they were supposed to tell guests. "His exalted Majesty, King James Moriarty the Third, has graciously allowed me to serve you tonight, my Prince. I am yours to do with as you please." He looked down, the picture of humility.
Bill laughed. “You only got a little wet, Cap. Nothing time won’t dry.”
John grinned and pulled again.
“Ah.” John sighed in relief. God forbid he was ill on top of having been hurt. Or injured because he had been abused. John squeezed his fork. He wanted to hurt that dom, very badly.
"How are my nieces?" He asked.
“Yes, John.”
He looked at John’s hands, instantly noticing the single mug. “Where’s mine?”
Until now. John had slipped into a crack in his mind palace and set up residence and Sherlock couldn't evict him. He wasn't even sure he wanted to. It was exciting and horrendous and made him feel a little bit sick. His feelings were all tangled up and all he could parse was that he did indeed want as much of John as possible.
“Okay, thanks.”
A head shake.
“Get over here.”
are you?” John growled. It was already a weird, borderline creepy situation, but the fact that this stranger had his file was unnerving.
John nodded, sipping and wishing he had more to go on. “How long have you known him?”
"You hate James Moriarty. Oh, don't look at me like that, it's not like I'm going to run and tattle to him. The calluses on your fingers indicate you know your way around weapons. Not really a skill one picks up on a fishing boat or in a royal herana, now is it? Your tone, body language, the way you look me in the eye‒oh stop. I don't mind if you look at me or not. It's refreshing. You have no idea how tedious it gets having everyone bow and grovel every time I darken a doorway. Faces are so expressive, yours especially. Now, your body. You're used to working hard and being physical. The muscles were toned by work and strengthened by hefting guns, nets, bows and arrows, and blades‒likely from the back of a horse. Another obvious tell is that you're here, imprisoned in this castle as a concubine. Jim hates the hughwaymen and you fit the type of a vigilante. So let's review: calluses on your hands, your body type, the ways about you that indicate you hate it, and most telling of all:"
They walked over to the ambulance and Lestrade asked for a submissive medic. A man and woman came forward and helped Sherlock clamber up into the ambulance. He sat stiff on a gurney, his face pinched in discomfort as the medics efficiently peeled his coat and shirt away. One of them closed the door for privacy and Greg stood there waiting with his arms crossed. John was probably in a right state. His husband was hurt and bleeding with potentially broken bones and he wasn't even in the country. Greg thought of John telling him to take charge and keep it and the officer hoped John would have the foresight to take a suppressant before coming into his flat. He hoped Sherlock wasn't too badly hurt.
do, is give you a mild sleeping aid." Mike said, going over to his shelf of bottles. “Valerian will help you sleep. I’ll put in chamomile. Are you anxious?” He glanced over his shoulder.
"Greg, do you notice anything about Sherlock and John?"
“Sherlock…” Greg rubbed his forehead.
Sherlock gulped again. Sparks shot up his cock. What? What was this? John scolding him was turning him on?!
"Your Highness." He said.
“Better than cocaine I suppose. Whatever
“Yes?” John grinned.
John laughed. “Yeah maybe.”
“Sherlock.” John said, closing 221’s door behind. He froze and let out a little sigh, just absorbing the flat’s cozy warmth. The detective swept up the steps, not sparing a moment for John or the welcoming heat. He followed his sub, promising himself a cup of something hot before he did anything else today.
“Have you ever been to The Broads?” Sherlock asked.
"What! For God's sake, what?!"
Inwardly, Sherlock smiled at this. John was the only person Sherlock had ever heard that dropped the F-bomb at least five or six times while simply making tea in the morning. Hearing him get ‘upset’ about swearing was almost enough to make him break the scene with laughing.
He raised the paddle again and laid a series of fast, hard blows.
“I think you need some help staying still, Holmes.” John reached around and grabbed his hard cock and balls in his hand.
He hadn't seriously fantasized about collaring a complete stranger since before he went into the army. He wasn't some naïve novice dom, drooling over the first hot sub he'd ever seen! There were plenty of hot subs out there. John should know, he'd had several while on tour. A few young sub lads in his platoon had given him longing looks and there was an elegant bar owner with long ebony plaited hair he’d subbed for beautifully in Bombay. He smiled at the memory. That was some fun furlough.
He grabbed the ointment and applied it generously, gently wriggling a finger in to check for internal damage. He didn’t feel anything, and he didn’t think there would be. Good. He pulled out and without thinking, he rubbed his thumb across his sub’s balls and his palm up and down his cock. Sherlock gasped and John froze.
"Shut up!"
“How so?”
Mike bustled up to the table, giving a cheery, “hey John!” before he slung his coat over the chair and sat down. The waiter came over with John’s beer once Mike was settled and took their food orders.
, he was a
“Are you feeding me?”
“You’re not in the army anymore.” Sherlock sniffed, sipping.
“I’m right, aren’t I? That’s partly why you’ve been giving me so much space. I was abused, yes, but you worried about yourself too.”
Molly asked John to strip naked, something he wasn't willing to do.
Mike frowned. "Who? King Moriarty?"
"Thank you, John." He said kindly, reaching forward to take the saucer and save John potentially dropping it all.
“Page two of two…” Sherlock gasped and clasped his hands to his mouth as the scattered pieces of the case snapped into place—the lacerations from the knives—the menus in Dixon’s house—Owen’s wealthy doms—the garlic and onion smell. Sherlock grinned and stared at the wall of case notes. Oh how he loved this part. The part when his genius shone out of every window of his palace in glorious light. The thing that linked all the victims was the Michelin star restaurant,
“—do something
John tipped the little bottle into the water and swirled his hands around. A vaguely minty scent filled the air. It wasn't unpleasant and it almost had a menthol-meets-eucalyptus flavor about it. John added another generous dollop of the gel and paddled his hands in the water, creating frothing bubbles.
“John, I’m not really…” he nodded at the cock.
He held the gag under his face. “I’m going to put this on you.” He said. “If you’re in distress at any point, snap your fingers and I’ll take off the gag and help you out, okay?”
The elder Holmes’ phone chimed again.
"I have it under control." Sherlock ground out. "I'm not addicted."
Sometimes Lestrade’s marginal observational skills were annoying. Sherlock scowled. Seb.
“Just, you...”
“Data for what?” He asked.
“Love?” John called up the stairs.
John texted Sherlock once his shift ended, having changed out of his doctor clothes and into a navy blue long sleeved shirt with pearly white buttons and white top-stitching. He was wearing the pair of jeans that did good things for his backside and his usual black jacket and he was standing at his desk in his office, his bag packed in front of him. He sent a quick text.
“Fine. Help me cook. Mike and Betsy are coming over.”
His voice was so worried and broken that John turned to him and kissed him. He never wanted to hear his sub sound like that.
“Tell me, Sherlock, where’s your riding crop?”
“Oh, hello John.” She said.
As John said, “not a very good man.” Sherlock found he was completely fine with the fact that the man in his kitchen pulling a carton of beef lo mein out of the bag had murdered someone not three hours ago. Not just murdered someone, but killed the cabbie to
Sherlock gave the letters back to Mycroft. "Seem content."
“Did you punch Mycroft?” Sherlock asked in a quiet, hopeful voice.
Sherlock wished it was possible to sleep soundly while standing upright.
The doctor made the water lukewarm and grabbed the shampoo. He washed Sherlock, lathering his hair and rinsing. He soaped up his sub's chest and stomach and bits and arse. He carefully smoothed his hands over his sore back. Sherlock winced as the water and soap stung his scrapes.
"Oh, no, I am so sorry!" John said, horrified. "I thought you were someone else. I didn't mean to--"
Sherlock crossed his arms and stared at the wall.
“I just, I was friends with Owen, and he used to talk about you all the time—what a great dom you were and all, and,” fresh tears sprang down his cheeks and Coel’s face softened.
Hello amazing readers. Thank you so, so much to everyone who's stuck with this fic for so long. I'm actually a little nervous about posting this chapter! Eesh. Okay, this chapter is the main reason the fic is tagged with ‘gore’ ‘knives’ ‘blood’ and ‘violence,’ so please be warned. I’d also like to point out that the fic is also tagged ‘happy ending’ as well, haha.
She answered after one ring.
They went quiet and scanned for game, looking for the low, horizontal shapes of deer among the vertical trees. They didn’t see much of anything for a long time.
"This one was…pretty bad."
. A lot. He cared about John and he cared what happened to him. Never ever once had he cared about Seb or anyone the way he cared now about John. At least, not in this capacity. He imagined John being gone—being dead. This whole past few weeks would seem like nothing but a wonderful dream if John had died tonight. He’d wake up again in an empty bed and an empty flat. He’d do coke again and sullenly accept invitations from Mike and Betsy to have dinner. The unassuming doctor had awoken something excited and warm and alive in Sherlock that he never wanted to see extinguished.
“Look at you.” He murmured, reaching down to pet his hair. “Such a good sub, wanting to give me a blow job. I’m very pleased, love.” He petted his dark head and Sherlock sucked harder, kneeling up to get a better angle. “So thoughtful and so good.” John mused. He scratched his scalp and Sherlock whined in his throat, bobbing his head and pressing his tongue along the shaft.
“Thank you.”
“Oh no offense taken at all, dear. I don’t like the taste either!” She shrugged. “It must be a dom thing.” She glanced at Sherlock and made a squeaking sound of delighted joy. “He finally collared you!” She hugged Sherlock so hard that he stumbled into her. “Oh congratulations you two!” She gushed. John smiled and she sidled up to him, taking his arm. “Doesn’t he look
“Safeword.” John mumbled. His eyes were still closed.
in here for God's sake‒his
“Yeah.” He licked his lips and looked at Blair. “Yeah, that’s them.”
"Now what?" Sherlock asked.
"Five minutes, bakers!" Sue was yelling the announcement all too soon and John eyed his golden crust through the oven door. Thirty more seconds and it would be done. Then he just had to sprinkle some powdered sugar and cinnamon on top of the creamy beige tart and it would be ready. He glanced over and saw Molly kneeling by the oven as well, staring at her bake. She glanced at John and smiled. "I told myself I wasn't going to be one of those nuts that got on the floor and stared into their ovens, well…" she gestured over herself and shrugged. "here I am."
"Sherlock," He slid the opened through the paper. "I have lots of things to do before we depart for Hibern and this is taking up entirely too much time."
“Because Seb is an idiot. Look, I’ve been in a lot of, well, a few relationships, and I know how messy things can get. You said yourself we had just started dating when he began to text you and you didn’t want me to leave. Hell, I wouldn’t have told me either if I was in your position.”
"I don't know what's going to happen next." His voice shook with a weird mix of arousal, fear, and confusion. "Will you fuck me? Will you hurt me? Will it be more conversation like before? I don't know." He was completely horrified to realize there were tears in his eyes.
Sherlock blinked a few times, coming back to the present. He leaned down and gave his dom a soft kiss. John was more than fine with this, but he was still unsure about…everything now. Was this an ‘I love you’ kiss? Was it a pitying ‘you fool, what are you thinking?’ kiss? Sherlock pulled up and took John’s hand, then strode to the bedroom with his head held high. John trotted after. Sherlock pushed through the door and kissed John again, then hugged him. His hard cock pushed into John’s thigh and the sub reached around and grabbed his bum, squeezing hard. He widened his legs and inhaled the scent of John’s hair.
Sherlock grinned shyly and John gave him a quick pat on the hip to get him moving. He yipped and fled to the bedroom and John stalked after him. Sherlock tugged his clothes off enroute and left them scattered over the floor before he dropped to the bed, grabbing a pillow and hugging it towards his chest. He sighed into the sheets as John opened the wardrobe and pulled a tube of hand cream off a shelf before he climbed over the sheets. He took a moment to admire Sherlock’s body, marked with the crop and no doubt sore.
“How’s your backside?” John mumbled, his eyes still closed.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “The evening wasn’t a complete waste. Not only did I discover that he’s a randy old bastard, but it seemed Lestrade was right. I don’t think Coel is the killer either. He’s too preoccupied with his work. He didn’t seem to give a toss that his sub was dead. It wasn’t serious between them.”
“Exactly. And did you listen?”
“There you go.” John growled. “Get that bottom up for me.” John reached down and stroked his cock and balls. Sherlock stiffened nearly instantly in John’s hand. “This gets hard for me now.” John said. “My cock.” He squeezed the shaft and Sherlock nodded frantically, grunting when John added a third slick finger and slammed them in and out. It stung a bit, in a good stretchy kind of way. Sherlock moaned into the cushion as his prostate was brushed. It felt so good to have his dom fill him and use him.
“Oh.” Sherlock licked his lips, mildly disappointed. “I understand.”
John leaned forward and kissed him hard.
“You’re deducing how, aren’t you?”
the crop over back, careful to avoid his spine and the bony parts of his shoulders. Sherlock wasn’t sure how much time had passed, but John finished cropping him and the fire’s heat made every tender spot on his body burn and sting. His cock was harder than ever.
“What do you care?”
“We went to that fancy place—Page Two.” Michael looked up at Blair and they smiled. “The food was so good.”
“God,” John panted. “Is kissing you always going to be like that?”
“Look at you. You
"Tandem baking again, you two?" Mel glanced at Sherlock's bowl. The camera was in their faces.
They fell asleep like that, content in each other’s arms.
"All set. Grab some paracetemol. It's going to ache later." John chucked the bloody tissues away and Sherlock reached for his red dressing gown on the back of the door. He got it on his torso by himself and he tied it, moving slowly. He took up his tea with his good arm and sipped some more.
Even with his voice an octave deeper and far angrier than Sherlock had ever heard, he knew it was his dominant. He could really use someone on his side right now. Angry footsteps stomped into the room and Sherlock glanced over his shoulder.
John made a face. “M’not telling you.”
John stared at him, enchanted. He could watch Sherlock play until rapture and never grow tired of it. He didn't know how long he stood there, listening and absorbing, but eventually the piece drew to a close and John licked his lips and blinked as if coming out of a trance. Sherlock smiled at him, warm and genuine and a sudden
“I see.” Sherlock said. “Certainly he wasn’t alive when you pulled him on board.” He looked at Lestrade. “May I?”
“How did it die?” Sherlock asked. He squinted at the writing on the side of the page, mouthing the unfamiliar words.
“We were at a bar,” he began, “nice place, and I got chattin’ with one of the waitresses…”
“Stalker?” Greg asked.
"He's shaken. He's probably hurt‒he fell down like thirty stairs." Silence. "He won't let me. No….I tried. Yeah…no. Okay." Footsteps got closer behind him and then, "Sherlock?" A phone appeared in the detective's line of vision. "John for you."
“No.”
John shook his head. He could never, ever abuse a sub in any way. One of his kinks was giving pleasure, and the thought of abusing a sub that had placed that kind of trust and intimacy in him was so repelling that he had trouble even conceiving of it. The sub in him winced and a protective urge surged through his chest.
"It is, I imagine. I've never actually taken advantage of Sherrinford’s concubines."
this man? "How do you know this?"
"What's wrong?"
“Because you didn’t know this was in there.” John told him. Smack!
“—Mike will check the places he knows of. You don’t both need to be there. We can cover more ground if we’re separate.”
“Whenever you’re ready to talk about it.” John said, squeezing his shoulder.
“What about relatives’ house—family, friends?”
“Not at all.” John came over to him and kissed him. “I’m glad you’re getting cases.”
“No. I’m at my friend’s place. I have been all evening.”
John fumbled the vial and the gloves fell to the floor.
An email alert popped up in the corner of John’s screen. It was from Sherlock. Hm. He glanced up at his sub, who seemed to be holding his breath, and opened the link. He blinked at the webpage. He’d been expecting a medical journal article or some kind of new findings in the exciting world of tobacco ash but what he saw was far more entertaining.
“I thought I would have snapped out of it.” John said in a small voice. “I’m usually okay by now.”
A serial killer, a footrace through the city, and that diabolical chess game with the little white pills. Sherlock was smiling as he slid out of his coat in 221B and hung it on the door. He caught sight of the clock—half eleven. No matter. It wasn’t too late for food. He was starving. He was always hungry post-case and usually he would eat his weight in whatever was laying around the flat before sleeping it off and spending the next day alone in his mind palace. Tonight though, would be different. A new feature was present tonight, and said new feature followed him into the flat, setting the bag of Chinese food on the counter. Sherlock stood there for a moment, listening to the noises in the kitchen and feeling buzzy and happy with the adrenaline rush that always came from solving a case.
"John!" She came over to his pallet and sat on the edge of it. Her hair was damp from being washed and it hung stringy over her shoulders. "Need help?"
“Good.” John let him stay in that position, getting used to it for a few moments. He picked up the crop and absently trailed it over Sherlock’s backside. The detective grunted and leaned forward some more and John grinned. He
"No more." He said, gathering his winnings. "That's all for tonight."
"Sherlock!"
Sherlock was silent and John raised his brows. "Tell me you've seen it."
“Tonight?!” Sherlock blurted.
"Mm."
Sherlock basked in the praise. He loved when John called him gorgeous and told him all the greatest things about him.
“I can’t reach your thighs.” John mumbled.
"Now, Mel, that's enough with the jokes. We knead to get started."
Sebastian took the money pouch and slipped in into his belt. "Much obliged, my liege."
Sherlock smiled. "I'm flattered."
“Do you want to come in?” John asked.
Sherlock closed his eyes and couldn’t help smiling.
“It’s not my right to demand that.” He bit his lip, sipped the tea too fast, and continued. “I don’t
“Why did you pull him on board?” Sherlock said.
Blah, blah. Sherlock looked at the other page, towards the bottom.
“Alright?” John asked.
They dried off and put dressing gowns on. Sherlock picked up his collar, feeling the soft leather and lining. The buckled was cool under his fingers and he glanced up at John, standing at the mirror in the wardrobe and scraping fingers through his wet hair in an attempt to get it to look decent. Sherlock went over to him and held it out. John turned around and smiled, taking it. Sherlock bent his head and John latched it on.
“Taught.”
At John's silence, he bellowed, "speak!" His voice echoed off the stone walls and John barely suppressed a flinch.
John blinked. “Yeah?” His voice was hesitant.
“I can’t lay in that infernal room all day.” Sherlock muttered. He wrapped sheet covered arms around John from behind, knowing that his presence would be soothing to him. The gun stuck in the back of his jeans rubbed Sherlock’s belly.
“Your friend the
John sprinkled sugar on his and Sue moved on to a different contestant.
"Are you hurt?" She knew he wasn't. He was much too pouty and petulant to actually be injured.
John perked at the sound of his sub’s name before the line went dead. He handed the phone back to the sub. “Thanks…”
“Why not treat ourselves?” Sherlock said. John was wearing the black and blue tailored suit he’d worn for their school roleplay scene, and even though it was probably the nicest suit John owned or had ever owned, Sherlock appreciated the subtle reminder that John was very much his dom and Sherlock had come all over John’s hand while getting a spanking for his ‘filthy habits’ while his dom was wearing that suit. He shivered.
Sherlock shook his head quickly, even as his cock grew in his trousers.
“Good lad. We can do more.”
"I am too." John said. "A healer."
They sat towards the back of the restaurant by the tropical fishtank. Sherlock slid into one side of the booth and to John’s surprise, pulled him down on the same side with him, only taking off his coat when John was looking at the menu, acting as a shield between him and the rest of the world. They each ordered miso soup and maki.
“I would very much like you inside of me, Captain.” He breathed.
Mike spoke to him. "This is an old colleague of mine, John Watson. John, Sherlock Holmes."
"This time!" Mycroft stomped up to the foot of his bed. "You could have been mugged, murdered, thrown in the Thames and we'd never know! We’d never know what happened to you!"
The detective was grinning like a loon, his fingers twitching in excitement. “A
“That was ages ago.”
Sherlock lifted his arse hopefully and John rubbed some lube over his hole. The plug tip was narrow and John slipped it inside of him and pushed. He felt his sub relax his muscles and John patted a cheek. “Very good. You’re making it easier for me.” The plug widened and Sherlock shifted and finally the thing popped into place.
John licked his lips. Oh boy, they were going to have sex—penetrative sex. He’d wondered now and then about bringing it up to his sub, but he was honestly happy with where their relationship was now. One day in the future he knew he’d like to fuck his submissive, but the tying and the spanking and the fingering and all the rest of it was pretty great too. He grabbed the lubricant from the side table and clambered onto the bed, leaning over him and delighting in the way Sherlock shivered.
“From what I understand,” John said, “you’ve been smoking on school grounds.”
"You love looking me over like this." Sherlock licked his lips and tilted his head down, looking up at John. He swung his legs back and forth. John raised a brow at him and Sherlock giggled, feeling submissive and playful now despite his aching back. "You love touching me and checking me and being all doctor-y."
Her reply was gratifyingly fast.
“Sherlock can protect himself.” John growled.
"Oh no!" Molly ran off back to her counter to reread the instructions.
"No! It must be John."
"I will not leave. Not until you tell me what has you so upset."
No one had any luck on the hunt and they all returned to the castle well after lunch, hungry and disappointed. Seb herded the guests towards the drawing room for brandy and cigars before tea but Sherlock had had quite enough.
“A case.” He swung off John’s knees, the dom succinctly forgotten, as he texted Lestrade back. John sighed down at his half erect cock. “Not yet, buddy.” He muttered at it.
“You imagined me on my knees?” Sherlock asked. He grinned and John shook his head in amusement. No one naked on their knees should sound that smug. “Go get the clothes pins!” Sherlock declared.
“Yes you do. You’re getting punished and that’s final. Come on, now.” John turned and went back to the box, picking it up and setting it on the desk. He rooted around and took out two cuffs and a short length of chain with a clip on each end. “Get your clothes off. All of them.” John snapped out. Sherlock did, stripping out of his coat. His shirt and trousers followed and he was soon naked. His whole body was flushed and warm with arousal and excitement zinged through his stomach. Surely John could see it and even smell it, but the dom paid it no mind. He patted his thigh and Sherlock came to him, allowing his wrists to be cuffed and clipped together in front. He could barely move them apart.
"That seems too short."
Sherlock didn’t really know what to say, so he just tried to slip into subspace the way he usually did. It didn’t seem so easy this time. He squeezed the bars in the cuffs. John went around him and Sherlock listened to him open the lube and squeeze it onto the plug. His cheeks were parted and then something hard was pressed into him, fast and unyielding.
"Yes, yes. Come in. I need you." Sherlock grabbed him by the arm and tugged him inside. Nerves danced up John's chest. Sherlock slammed the door closed behind them and John glanced him over, assessing quick and careful to see what sort of mood the prince was in. He was wearing his silk dressing gown over loose, comfortable clothing. He wasn't sweating or stiff in his silky soft trousers. His eyes weren't dilated, his skin wasn't flushed. He wasn’t aroused. John took a deep breath and his nerves subsided. It wouldn't happen right away.
Sherlock ducked into the dim alley beside Mike’s building. A lamp on the corner cast the alley in dank light, highlighting the rusty skip and puddles pooling in the uneven concrete. Sherlock glanced around the back of the skip and saw his duffel bag waiting just as promised. A member of his homeless network had come through once again, picking up the duffel from Baker Street and bringing it here. He couldn’t exactly have brought it with himself, as bringing a duffel to a dinner would be odd even for him. He picked it up and pulled out the faded skinny jeans and tight grey Rolling Stones Tshirt—the tongue logo licking right across his chest. He changed in seconds and stuffed his other clothes into the duffel, finally exchanging his expensive shoes for the taped up trainers. He pulled a cheap play collar around his neck and mussed his hair, then carefully swiped some eyeliner on and wrapped a leather cuff around his wrist. He didn’t have a mirror, but he knew what he was doing. He knew what made doms, especially rich wealthy doms like Coel, turn their heads. He stashed everything back in the bag and left a fifty pound note at the top of the pile before zipping it up and hiding it away behind the skip. Someone would come by in an hour or so and take the cash and deliver the bag back to Baker Street. Easy peasy.
Sherlock stared at him, letting the words sink in. Dammit if he didn’t always know what to say to make him feel good.
“That’s not what I said.” John told him.
While glancing through the newspaper, his perusal had been interrupted repeatedly by memories of the light on brunette curls and icy cool eyes and the tantalizing thought of just how sweet the detective would look kneeling naked, all that fair skin bared and flushed pink, wearing a dark collar‒bloody hell! John threw down the paper.
“This Thursday night? I’ll text him now.” Mike picked up his phone and dashed off a text, to John’s delight. “Maybe I can coax him out to a pub or something—oh dammit.” Mike put his phone down, looking dejected.
“Wait, wait.” John came up for air and rested his forehead on Sherlock’s chest. He squeezed his boy’s waist and peered up at him. “If I asked you to undress for me, would you?”
John let out a breath, unsure of what to say. Her soft fingers touched his cheek. She smelled of hand cream and vanilla he looked into her eyes. “He’s tough to live with and can be a stubborn pig headed mule.” She said.
“Do you need help?” One guy broke off from the group and spoke to Sherlock.
"I think they fancy each other." Her voice was a whisper. The driver boarded the bus and cranked the engine on. They pulled out onto the main road to head back to London.
“I was worrying myself sick all while
"Oh!" John sighed when they broke. "What was that for? Not that I'm complaining, mind."
The crop landed across his left thigh.
“Impeccable timing, that one.” Sherlock growled. “One second, Mrs. Hudson!”
“Yes.” He said stiffly. “Sorry again.”
“So fucking gorgeous.” The doctor smoothed his hands over the warm soft skin of his hips and pressed some loud tickling kisses to his neck. Sherlock giggled, actually
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, oh…” Sherlock lifted his arse up higher, arching his back. “God, John.” He clung again. He was sore for sure, but it was the best kind of sore. He had never been fucked like this before. They would both be having trouble walking tomorrow.
“I should have knelt when you offered.” He said.
With a final breath, he knocked on his own door.
Sherlock smiled slyly. “Didn’t you?”
“BDSM provides a certain amount of leeway for someone who would want to abuse. A certain amount of coverage, if you will.”
“It’s better now that I’m here.” John smoothed the cream over the tender skin.
"I'm sure they were good people, John."
“—I’m not done talking with you.”
"Well, I, it was luck." Sherlock said, his ears pinking. John grinned. Sherlock always got so flustered when his intelligence was praised, even after all this time. It was adorable.
Sherlock stopped kicking and glanced over his shoulder, looking at John with wide eyes.
“You’re not an officer, you can’t serve a warrant.” Dimmock got up, smoothing his tie, trying to figure out the best course of action. “I’ll send officers to her house and we’ll check her workplace.”
More laughter filled the air and John got a whiff of something sweetly smoky. Opium, he guessed. It sounded like there were at least three or four people in the room. John listened again, only able to make out the words,
“So do I. We can comfort each other. Let’s go to my bedroom. We can do the things that he enjoyed and remember him together.”
“But I didn’t die.” John pulled back and looked into Sherlock’s eyes. “Alright? I’m right here.”
“Is there paracetemol? You can have some.”
A soft
John relented and sat back down.
” The Headmaster grabbed his arm and turned him, landing a few more swats on his bum. Sherlock shivered and his cock tingled. “Lines, Mister Holmes.” He pointed at the stool. Sherlock made a face and watched him grab a pencil and a piece of lined paper, setting them down in front of the stool. “Fifty times in your best penmanship: I will not smoke.”
Just a common no one.
Greg blinked. “Did he…?” He was going to say some variation of “dump your deducing arse” but refrained.
Lestrade and John flew up a dirt road in Ferndale, lined with nothing but small bushes. John drummed fingers on the plastic door handle and took a deep breath.
“Ow!” Sherlock clenched his arse muscles and grabbed handfuls of the bedsheets. “I’m sorry!” He yelped. The surprise was still laced in his voice. “I’m really, really sorry—I didn’t mean to look at your box!”
"And it never will be again!" Mycroft shouted.
“So who are you then?” John pressed.
"‒I don't need to see a formula, thanks." John held his hand up. "Do you feel like untangling this?"
John looked up at him, skeptical. Sherlock continued quickly.
The tarts came out and each baker carried theirs up to the front of the tent and placed their creations behind their pictures. Some looked good. Others…not so much. An older lady named Elizabeth Hudson placed a beautiful tart that looked prettier than a picture. She was stationed near the front of the tent and John decided she'd be competition. She seemed friendly and warm though, and she reminded John a bit of his grandmother.
Sherlock growled and clenched the phone hard to keep himself from lobbing it at a passing bus. Maybe Lestrade and his merry men had found something.
“Coel still could have been the murderer.” John told him.
Sherlock looked at him.
“Is Sherlock there?” He asked.
“Yes, yes.” He took a deep breath and John smiled.
Mycroft smiled though it didn't reach his eyes. "King James Moriarty the third."
“No one is going to bother us.” Sherlock said. “Where are they keeping Logan?”
“Alicia.” She said, clearing her throat. She poured herself a glass of water and tucked some loose hair behind her ear, curling up on a wooden kitchen chair across from Greg. Sherlock elected to stand, and he glanced around the kitchen. Some photos were on the fridge and he peered at them. Someone’s dog in a park. A man who looked a lot like Alicia with a couple children. A few shots of Alicia smiling with a dark-haired white male partner. He had a collar on his neck and grease under his fingernails in the photo and Sherlock knew instantly that it was Jeff.
“Oh God.” John let Sherlock go as if he’d been scalded. His sub was breathing hard, eyes wide, and John felt his own heart beating like a bass drum. “Sherlock.” He breathed, glancing him over. “I, oh God…I hurt you.”
“About…?”
“Thanks, guys!”
"No shit. Me too." The handsome man with the dark curls took a deep gulp of his beer. John did the same. He was going to pay for these, after all. May as well bloody finish them.
“Very much.” He said. “Get in here with me.”
Sherlock’s smile lit the room.
"I am neither of those things, good sir. I'm simply an honest man playing an honest game." He stubbed out the last of the cigarette as if to punctuate his words. "I bid you farewell."
Sherlock’s face reddened. “No, we, we were—”
Thanks so much to everyone who's reading this story. I can't believe this fic has almost 10,000 hits! I never would have thought any of my stories would get anywhere near 10,000. You guys are awesome :D
Sherlock pushed all the way in and curled his toes and just stood there, enjoying. The heat was tight and sweet around his cock and sweat dribbled down his neck and ribs. Nothing hurt anymore and he grinned.
“My, my, isn’t
Sherlock’s face heated up. He didn’t know why he was embarrassed all of a sudden about being naked in front of John. Something about the doctor just standing there watching him made his face flame red in a giddy, fun kind of way. He stripped everything off, then tossed his socks aside and stood there naked in front of John, grinning shyly.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock. I, went too far.”
helping. A little. Sort of.
Sherlock looked thunderstruck for a moment before bursting out with, "this is
Silence. Sherlock picked up a rough sponge and John watched him rub it up his arm and across his chest, then down…
"Never doing this again." Sherlock said when her mother had herded her away.
He pursed his lips, but didn’t say anything. He took him by the forearm and dragged him towards the corner behind the red armchair.
“Whatever you’re having.” He murmured in his ear.
“I don’t care. I don’t need you worrying about me. Stop contacting me.”
The big day came all too soon and John Watson stepped off the bus with the other contestants, all of whom were eager and happy to be there. The long white tent was pitched in a charming meadow in Dartmoor. Wild ponies grazed on a distant hill and a thin stream flanked by snowdrops wound into a nearby copse of trees. The sun was bright and he took a deep breath of the clean country air. A production assistant appeared and handed them all aprons, saying that they were going to do a bit of filming before beginning the actual baking. John pulled his beige apron over his head and tied the strings. He glanced at the other contestants, sizing up the competition as best he could. Everyone seemed pleasant enough, chatting and introducing themselves. John's eye was continually drawn to the tall bloke with the dark curly hair, standing a bit aside from the rest of the group and staring intensely at the big tent. His silver eyes were quick and intelligent and his cheekbones were sharp as blades. John didn't catch his name as they were all lined up outside the tent to be filmed, and he quite forgot everything as soon as he saw Mel and Sue.
“Do I make myself clear?” John finished.
“The truffle butter is good here.” Sherlock said, putting his napkin primly in his lap.
“Why did you not go into Defense?” Sherlock asked, interrupting what Greg was asking.
“Delicious as always, Sweets.” Mike winked at her.
Jim held up his arm and snapped his fingers.
Sherlock grunted. Mycroft wasn’t wrong. Violet was an interesting enough person but there wasn’t a soul on earth who could make Sherlock actually want to visit Hibern. Mycroft sighed. “You’d have a much more pleasant time if you’d lose this attitude.”
“I just want him gone.” Sherlock said.
“—I think it would be best if you left.” Sherlock said in a cold voice.
, mate.”
"You're welcome. Go," Greg shooed him towards the room.
Sherlock opened his eyes slowly, blinking in the bright sunlight. Instantly the previous night came back to him and the way he’d been so distraught and on edge washed over him like a sickness. He pushed his face into the pillow. He didn’t want to deal the aftermath. He wondered briefly how John was holding up after everything. He peeked up and found the bed empty save for himself. His phone was on the side table. He didn’t remember leaving it there—he’d left it in his pocket in his trousers right before John told him to strip. John must have brought it in. He reached for it, wincing only a little bit as his back scraped the sheets. His clothes that he’d left kicked off to the side by the fireplace were folded neatly on the armchair. John or Mrs. Hudson? Hmm. He pulled up his text conversation with his dom.
“Oh, Sherlock…” He panted. He slowed and went still, clutching Sherlock’s head. “That was great.” He slid back, pulling out of his mouth. “Let me grab a tissue…” He handed one down and Sherlock stared up at him.
“But I could have. I was like an animal!” He growled, angry with himself and angry that he’d lost control.
however, were used to a more eclectic journey. Sherlock had a habit of climbing up to the crow’s nest and firing guns into the sky, usually during bad weather. He also liked to collect seawater samples, which he did by leaning way over the side and dragging pots attached to ropes through the water. Another favorite trick of his was to perch precariously on the bow with his violin, ignoring all the sailors who tried to politely but firmly and respectfully convince the Prince to please get down, your highness, lest you fall into the icy water below.
He trotted to the wardrobe and grabbed a thick cashmere and wool pair of Sherlock’s winter socks, stuffing his feet into the warmth. He dug around for an undershirt that he knew he had left on one of the cleared shelves. Odd. He could have sworn he left it here. He checked the floor and even under the bed. No matter. He grabbed his terry cloth dressing gown and pulled it over chilled shoulders.
“Look at you.” John murmured. Sherlock looked away, a pink flush blooming up his throat. His body was beautiful. He looked like a skinny lanky sod in those suits he wore, but in the flickering firelight John was pleasantly surprised to see there was a fair bit of muscle on him too. He stepped forward and kissed him gently, then grabbed his biceps and pushed him down on the sofa. Sherlock yelped and landed on the pillows, breathing fast, clutching the cushions tight, one leg on the floor and the other bent up on the couch. He stared up at John, his eyes bright and focused and his cock twitching vaguely in interest.
“Hello Freak.”
“Excellent.” Sherlock said, his eyes bright with delight. “We’ll have to practice together, then.”
“The hell I don’t.” John growled. He advanced again, bracing his hands on the counter edge on either side of Sherlock’s body. They were nearly chest to chest and John looked up at him with a feral expression. Sherlock was tense against the counter, looking down into his eyes. Sherlock was the most maddening, ridiculous sub John had ever come across and if he was smart, he’d be storming out of this flat never to return. And yet…he saw the excitement, the hope in Sherlock’s expressive eyes behind the barely concealed masked emotion.
Sherlock glanced at him and looked away. He wanted to make no more decisions tonight. "Yes."
Mrs. Hudson made another happy noise. “Oh John,” She hugged him too, “you’re making him blush.”
John motioned to the bartender. "Another please. Make it two."
"Great." John gave her a smile that didn't reach his eyes. "Thanks, Sadie."
“Seb?” Sherlock asked. “Was that pathetic group of jumbled words supposed to be an inquiry about whether my irritated state was brought on by an appearance of my utter arsehole of a former dom?”
Sherlock kissed him gently on the lips. John kissed back and Sherlock swung his leg over so he was straddling his doctor. They kissed furiously and John was just going for his trousers when—
John rolled his eyes. "Tell me about it. He has it down to an art form."
Thank God for that. John put the phone aside and headed for the loo to shower, glad that he wouldn’t be stuck all day in either his bedsit or Sherlock’s empty flat with nothing to keep him company but a head full of war memories.
“When I bailed you. I said I wouldn’t allow my subs to be so rude, and if you roll your eyes at me again you’re going over my knee.”
“221 Baker Street.” Sherlock muttered.
“Go inside, Sherlock!”
Jeff!”
“I don’t know if he’s still using at all.” Betsy added hastily, “I just know that when we were first dating, Mike would sometimes bring him here to sleep it off safely.”
“What about your car?” John asked carefully.
"Doesn't matter what you want, brother. You're the Prince. You do what you're told."
Sue jumped in, "on your marks,"
Sherlock sighed. “He’s working.”
“We have to change your bandages, love.”
“I’d say too that he was brunette or black-headed, going by the color of his arm and leg hair. As to where the rest of the body is…I have no idea but if I was a murderer, the Thames is an obvious dumping ground.” John looked up at all of them. Lestrade nodded, lost in thought as he looked down at the limbs. Sherlock beamed with delight, his chest puffed up and proud.
"Everything is getting swallowed up. Something has torn me asunder internally and is eating my insides whole!"
She nodded. When he didn't continue she asked, "how did you meet him?"
Moran giggled and John hated him even more.
“Is John here? I brought enough for two.”
Grudgingly, he let his hands fall to the carpet. John stepped away and went to the kitchen to wash his hands. “Is spaghetti and meat sauce okay for dinner?”
"Here." He gave her a little clay tub of yellowish cream. "Dab this on your sore spots. It'll keep it clean and help with the pain." She nodded and took it eagerly. "Apply it after bathing, and morning and night. You can do it yourself or I or one of the girls can help you."
Sherlock scoffed. "Please. I gave them to Mrs. Hudson. She’ll get them into the hands that need them most.”
“You look fantastic on your knees. Even better than I imagined.” John leaned forward and kissed his forehead.
"You did well this weekend." Sherlock's smooth voice interrupted his thoughts and he sat down beside John.
John stared at him a moment longer and for a horrible moment, Sherlock thought he didn’t believe him. His features softened then and he smiled, warm and rumpled and soft.
"I don't want to say too much,” Mike said, “but his dom was, well, an arse."
John laughed, loud and genuine, and Sherlock smiled. John put the boots down. "Tell me more about my shoulder accident."
“Because I’ve seen your methods.”
"...what about him?"
Sherlock snickered again. “And did you?”
“Mudd….” John frowned, the name not sounding at all familiar. “Where is that?”
"Food." He said. "Lots of it. I've not eaten properly all day. I'll need a bath run too."
"They
"I wish I could get some of the rookies at work to obey me so well." He sipped his coffee and looked at Sherlock. He gave Greg a pleased, haughty smile and sipped his coffee. Greg snorted. "Never seen a kneeling sub look so smug."
"Alright." She put her hands up. "I'll leave you to it." She left, thankfully, as a servant rushed around the open door.
“Yes.”
Sherlock hailed a cab, sliding into the leather seat and directing the driver to Baker Street. He pulled out his phone and, against his better judgment, texted Mycroft.
“I have case stuff!” Sherlock yelled.
Sherlock shivered. "Yes, John."
“Fine.” Greg said. “We’re still going to check her out but she’s likely not the killer. She’s about one step away from punching you in the face though.”
“Of course it’s true!” Jim hissed. The faint clink of ice on glass sounded and John realized Jim probably had a drink in his hand. “They knew too much, I had to get rid of them!”
Mycroft eyed the leash and collar. “Go to him.” He said quietly.
"Sherlock, my dough is almost done. I need to go."
curious though. Sherlock was, at best, indifferent to everyone with the exception of Mrs. Hudson. What on earth had this John done to break through all of Sherlock's barriers? And in so short a time? His brother was certainly unhappy to leave Chilgrave and now it made sense why.
“I’ll be fine. Don’t you worry about
sushi. An invitation to a child’s birthday—presumably from the brother—and a coupon for a home cleaning service. A paycheck from the dealership was off to the side, addressed to Dixon.
John smiled and Sherlock's heart ached. Why did he have to leave? Who had dared book him tonight? Sherlock had half a mind to pound on that person's door and declare John his and off-limits.
“I feel like an old man.” John grumbled. He hobbled towards the loo, one hand rubbing his lower back. Sherlock unbuckled the collar and left it on the side table before following his dom. John was in front of the mirror, slowly twisting from side to side to try and loosen up.
Sherlock took a deep breath. He couldn’t die. John was out there and he loved John and he was not going to die at the hands of some lunatic, not while he had any strength left in his body. He grit his teeth and surged upright. His knees were quivering like an excited Chihuahua and he knew he must look a sight painted in rust brown and bright red, the dark slices on his body covered in purple-red scabs.
“We both know last night was something.” John had stopped advancing when Sherlock backed into the counter. Still though, Sherlock couldn’t bring himself to make eye contact. If he was honest, he wanted to fall to his knees and nuzzle John’s palm. No!
“You want to come with?” Sherlock was puzzled.
"Yeah." John sighed. The bakers went to their families and there were happy congratulations all around. John watched Sherlock speak with his parents. The brother/cousin/whatever found John in the crowd and gave him a thin smile. He tapped Sherlock's father's shoulder and said something to him. His father turned and spotted John.
"Sherlock." Sally said. "He's a brill pool player."
him.” Mycroft sneered. There was a barely controlled heat behind his eyes. “I will make the rest of your existence…unpleasant.”
“Why not? Forget your keys?”
He tucked it up under his arm and turned Sherlock out of the corner.
in our bloody flat?”
"Prince Sherlock." The attendant raised a brow. "He was very adamant."
“I think so.” John sipped the tea.
"Please." John said. Sherlock peeled himself out of the warmth and disappeared back into the kitchen. John was certain he'd stay there, tired of the movie and drawn by another experiment, but he returned bearing two big mugs of tea. "What do you think of the film? Cheers." John took an offered mug.
He paced into the kitchen, then paced back into the sitting room, then back into the kitchen.
"Mm-hm." John brought the empty pan to the sink to wash. Sherlock handed over used bowls and utensils. "There's some mild abrading as well. I haven’t seen what's under the bandages yet. We're getting x-rays today."
"That's nice of you to say." John said, sadness tingeing his voice.
“What’d he say?” John asked. He bit back the annoyance in his tone. He didn’t particularly want to go case chasing right now. Not after his therapy session and not after the violent nightmare he’d had. More sex and a nap sounded perfect but there was no way he was going to sit back while Sherlock went off to dangerous crime scenes to investigate.
"He's not out here‒and I don't know what his family looks like!" John glanced around. A tall man in a three-piece suit was watching him carefully and he looked away. He had no idea who that was. Their grandmother and father waved from a picnic table and they waved back.
"In here, please." Betsy called. Sherlock rose, a mutinous look on his face, and slipped the phone into his pocket. "Here,” she said, “you can help me…"
arch enemies?” John raised a brow.
"Hm?"
He glanced around the dark flat. No Sherlock. Probably off doing something for the limb case. He hoped his sub was okay. Yesterday’s punishment had been unusually tense, but maybe Sherlock was just distracted. This case was like a new toy for him and he was excited about it. John made a pot of coffee and drank it hot and black, then turned on the telly. He’d nearly died after getting shot. Even once he was at hospital in Kandahar and the wound was stable, he’d caught an infection that had nearly taken his life. The weeks after getting shot were just a fevered haze of pills and injections and lots of doctors talking above him. He’d almost lost the arm. He flexed his hand and rubbed the muscle around the scar.
.” Sherlock let the name pop out of his mouth. “Recently promoted at Scotland Yard—an idiot, but might be good at his job someday.”
"Okay."
” Betsy asked.
of Rohypnol to contain twenty or thirty milligrams. It’s safe to suggest that Owen was dosed with even more than fifteen milligrams before he was killed. The time in the river and his own metabolism would have degraded the amount found in his body, but why on earth did the murderer give him so much?”
“You go on.” Sherlock whispered. “I’ll look ahead and come back.” She trotted off and Sherlock exhaled. Alone, finally. He let his horse wander the path at its own pace. He didn’t bother looking for game. He didn’t much feel like hunting. The solitude of the woods was a balm after the activity of the trip, the unpacking, the endless servants, seeing Jim’s horrible face, and dealing with Sebastian. He was perfectly content to enjoy his alone time.
"Oh! Seb." Jim reached into a pocket and pulled out a bag that by the sound of the jangling, was filled with coins. "What do I owe you? Johnny and company here had a price on their heads. It was like a jillion florins, right?"
. A light was on in his dealer's flat, the window glowing with the flickering blue of the television. Lotto was probably watching old episodes of
“Yes, okay…” John nodded. “What about bondage?”
A black town car pulled up to the curb behind him. The windows were all tinted.
"Oh. No." John laughed, bitter and honest. "The herana is
(See the end of the chapter for
"No, good God! John! I can't stop thinking about him and it hurts when I think of him. It's like an obsession! Can't you give me a tonic or something to make it stop?"
"Molly, you like to read, right?" He said.
Sherlock glanced down at the man’s hands to confirm his story. The calluses were in the correct places on his index finger and thumb—at least that part was true anyway.
"Just holding it for him." John said. "Mine's mixing."
“We’re just trying to pick the best one.” John said.
“That’s enough then.” He paused. “I should go.”
Sherlock sighed, exasperated. “I think we’ll be fine.”
“No. You broke and entered. You deserve to be in there.”
“Cheeky.” John set the flowers down and watched as Sherlock carefully made his way to the desk, opening up his computer and powering it on. John came over to him and pulled him into the most careful hug he could manage. Sherlock was surprised to feel him trembling slightly.
John gave him a frustrated, “Hm?”
"Excuse me, officers?" Sherlock said in his politest voice. Thrown, they looked at him. He was holding two of the biggest snowballs John had ever seen. They looked at Sherlock, struck dumb, before he flung them at the coppers. They each got a chestful of snow and John threw his head back and laughed. Trust Sherlock to have his back in the end.
“No, no.” John pinched the sensitive skin inside his thigh and Sherlock squeaked. The sudden sharp, unpleasant pain washed away the arousal and John tied his flaccid cock down. “There.” John tied it off. “Walk around, see it if chafes.”
“Alright?” Sherlock asked.
John’s own building arousal vanished in a wisp and his shoulders sagged.
“Today, I suppose. It won’t be easier later.”
"Why not?"
“Oh God…” He breathed.
Sherlock stood there, proud, a fetching twinkle in his eye.
“Love? You okay?” John went up to him and took his hand. Still no response. “Good God, I’ve broken him.” John mumbled, half serious.
An hour later, the credits were rolling on the mold spore documentary and the sun was starting to set. Sherlock was starting to wonder how long John would want to be here. One of them was bound to get hungry soon, or need the toilet. John seemed to be thinking the same thing. He stirred and shifted and lifted his head, taking a moment to acclimate.
“I sure as fuck
"It was in the proving drawer!"
John slowly raised his hands in the air and stamped down his body's desire to quake. Peggy's body was sprawled awkwardly on the dirt at unnatural angles. Her face was turned away and her red hair fanned out behind her head. Two guards grabbed John and wrenched his arms behind him hard. John bit back a groan as his bad shoulder twisted. He gulped and he took a deep breath, his insides jumping around in fear. He couldn't show that he was afraid. His people needed him to be brave.
At that moment, Mike had a burst of inspiration. “Sherlock.” He said. The detective looked at him sharply. “You know how you mentioned to Betsy that an assistant would be useful?”
The sub sighed and stood up, carefully, but he didn’t go to the bedroom. He didn’t know exactly what he was dealing with here. Defense was new territory for him and if he wasn’t so lethargic and bored from these pills, he’d be doing all kinds of experiments on John’s altered mental state. The opportunity that was slipping through his grasp was annoying enough, but all their acquaintances popping ‘round was just infuriating. He came to John’s side and rubbed his hand up and down his dom’s back in a soothing motion. John relaxed slightly and Greg jumped up the first set of steps into view. Instantly John tensed and Sherlock could swear he heard him actually growling low in his throat.
“Yours.” Sherlock kissed his nose.
Sherlock did and Greg stared at his eyes, hard.
“Why?” He gave his cock a couple of loose tugs.
"Oh, do you mind if Greg and I come by? We'll bring some nibbles."
"Of course."
"Were they clean?" John asked. "Did you see warts, sores, anything?"
“This is my flat and I’ll lay on my floor if I want to.” Sherlock flailed his hand back, trying to hit his brother. He succeeded in smacking his shin.
"No." She smiled and held the leaves to her breast as if they were a treasure. "I saw Reena eat this shite when she thought she was with child. It worked." She smiled at him. "She was sicker n' hell though. Thank you much." She left.
“That’s not very nice.” John said.
John was standing beside Molly, his arms folded over his bruised chest. The attendant was reading out the night’s assignments.
“Yes.” Sherlock watched as warm capable fingers rolled his sleeve back some more and cradled his elbow, feeling the joint. “Does this hurt?” John pushed a spot with his thumb.
The Prince was face down on the large bed as if passed out in a drunken stupor. John perked up. Maybe if he was already out cold he wouldn’t force John to do anything. A sleeping host was the best kind of host. John glanced about the room.
John smiled for a second at the brutally honest omission, quickly covering his face with his hand. He schooled his expression after a moment and snapped back at him. “Get up! And get your hand out of your pants!”
"Where the hell is he?" His voice was maybe a little unnecessarily angry, but he didn't care. Sherlock was injured and needed help!
camera?”
Sherlock growled through his teeth, rocking in time with John’s pulls. The doctor grabbed his hip and squeezed and Sherlock threw his head back, his mouth open in ecstasy and he climaxed and hammered into John’s slick hand. John pulled harder and the detective hissed, his face contorting and his hips snapping. The wet heat running over his dick made John climax, Sherlock’s name escaping through clenched teeth. He gave them each a few more pulls, working through it, then slowed and eased his sodden hand off. Good God, his hand, thighs, and the bed sheets were soaked.
Sherlock realized then that he actually kind of
“Once,” John said in a quiet, ragged voice. “I didn’t give her a safeword. She went to hospital.”
She laughed and they returned to the their stations. John opened his oven, expecting the worst, and sighed. His savory appetizers were burnt, and now he didn't have time to make more. He put them aside and hurried to finish the rest of his challenge. He knew he wouldn’t be able to finish it in time, but he'd give it his all.
“If that was nothing, then I can’t wait to see ‘something’.” John smiled.
John didn’t need anymore urging. He gripped Sherlock’s waist and slid inside, both men groaning as he rocked closer and seated himself, thrusting in and out. “You’re my cheeky boy.” John grunted. He reached down and fondled Sherlock’s cock and the detective shuddered.
good.
Outside a bus roared by and the big plastic bins in the alley clanged as someone threw rubbish away. Sherlock snuggled closer to John and they tuned it all out, safe in each other's arms in the sanctuary of home.
“I’m not feeling so well.” He said. “Do you mind going on your own?”
John waved it off and Mike soldiered on up the steps. He really wanted this to work. Sherlock needed a healthy support group, and he wasn’t kidding when he said John was one of the most stand-up men he’d ever known. "He's not terribly social." Mike rambled. "He doesn't get out much but he likes my Betsy's cooking even if he never says so and he takes a while to warm up to new people."
"I will not." She said firmly.
“Almost right.”
"Look up." Sherlock grinned and John glanced up at the little bundle of greenery dangling above the door.
was ready to rejoin it. John already wanted him off this case, and that his sub was choosing to spend time with it rather than him rankled in the worst kind of selfish way. He was willing to accommodate the case, but did what he wanted count for nothing? John was about to speak up and say how much this case was bothering him, when—
They learn more about the case and John remembers some things he wish he could forget.
“Yes, yes, fine.” Sherlock smiled down at the decaying beast.
John sat and Sherlock dropped beside him. “Do you want the leash?” John held up the clip and Sherlock nodded. It was odd to hear him not speak, especially after the manic buzz of the case. The quiet was unusually nice and John knew his soon to be husband was just mellow now that the case was solved and done with. He clipped the leash to the little silver ring on his collar and gulped. This was what he’d fantasized about three months prior when he was alone in his little dark bedsit and imagining the brilliant detective in a collar and leash. He hadn’t thought for a second that Sherlock would be his fiance by now though. He looked even better than John had imagined and his dominance roared happily. He leaned down for a kiss. “You’re amazing, Sherlock. I,” he swallowed. “Thank you.”
“O-oh, yes. Choose a safeword, John.”
“You heard me. Get naked,
Sherlock stood, still feeling small and wrong footed. John was going to punish him for sure. There was no way he wouldn’t.
“Shut up!” Was the first thing he snapped at the doctor. John’s smirk faded instantly, his expression changing to angry steel.
. A normal person would have turned him over to the police, but of all the names Sherlock had been called over the years, ‘normal’ was never on the list. A few more knots were tied in the Gordian Ball of nebulous feelings that was taking shape in his palace.
“Yes, f-fine.”
“Get in the corner.” John deposited him there and stepped back. He scrubbed his hands through is hair. This had been
Sherlock smiled down at him and rubbed his palms up and down his dom’s waist. “I love you too.”
John laughed. “You don’t know that.”
“Why?” John asked Greg. “Why did he do all this? Why kill all those subs?” He glanced at Sherlock. “Did he just…snap?”
“Of course not. Forty thousand cameras and not one picks up Sherlock.”
Sherlock kissed his forehead.
the blowjob and the painfully delicious scolding and paddling. The big cup of coffee had been thoughtful and Sherlock contemplated this as he stared out the window. He’d like to reciprocate, but how? Should he ask the doctor to move in? Was it too soon? They’d only been dating a short time, but everything seemed to be going well. He’d certainly
The detective didn’t answer.
"Me neither."
“Are you working on a case?” John asked.
“Ah, you did!” Seb pointed at him. “You’re doing that thing with your face where you try to hide everything.”
The sharp sound of breaking glass made John wince.
Sherlock pulled back and started undressing. John watched, nearly struck dumb. A sort of giddy horny heat was looping around inside of him as Sherlock got naked before him and tossed his clothes aside. He got on the bed on his front and spread his knees. He grabbed a pillow and looked over his shoulder and bit his lip. “Please, John?”
“Hey, Sherlock? Love?” John appeared in his line of vision and he looked
“Does he?” Sherlock passed over the bag with the ID. “Anything at all about him ring a bell?”
"I'm not done!" The merchant snapped.
everything okay? Rude as hell is typical, but you’re not normally this defensive. Did I piss you off?”
“I want leather.” Sherlock said, staring at the suede. John caught the eye of an employee.
“Yes.” Logan was fiddling with his knives at the dining table near other wall.
Sherlock went to the kitchen, mindful of his stitches and scabs. The bandages were hot and itchy under his clothes and he was looking forward to getting everything off. He swallowed two prescription tablets with water and tiptoed to the loo. John was already in there, fiddling with the tap. Sherlock grabbed the hem of his Tshirt and tried to ease it off without catching it on any gauze—
“No.” He huffed.
“Did you kill him?” He whispered. “Logan?”
“It would be something to tell Mrs. Turner at any rate.”
“It’s near dawn. Come with me."
“Mike.” He said.
“Want you in here.” Sherlock mumbled, grabbing John’s wrist.
“Who is it?”
“Another one? What did you do this time?”
“Does this interest you, Sherlock?” Betsy asked.
“Oh she knows.”
Sherlock grunted.
Sherlock looked the officer in the eye. “No.”
"But you're crying for them, and I can tell that you're a good person. So they must have been good too."
“For you.” John conceded, finishing off his snack.
"But I'd say he won the best prize at the end of it all." Mel said, looking at them fondly.
"The skull." He said, looking at it. "Friend of yours?"
“No cheek. Address me properly.”
“Sherlock.” John grunted. “Ease up.”
.” He leaned back towards the microscope, twisting a knob.
He spot-washed his arm pits and crotch to alleviate the odor of sweaty sex. He dabbed some sweet-smelling oil under his arms and on his neck. He rubbed dried semen off his chest and stomach and he applied medicine on his sore spots, wincing when the irritated flesh stung. He dropped the rag and stretched his tight back. His scarred shoulder twitched in pain. He wasn't fit for another round. Getting used a fourth time in less than twelve hours would wreak havoc on his body. He also knew he couldn't refuse. He had tried to refuse his first guest and the guards had beaten him for his trouble and promised he'd be killed if he refused again. It wasn't an idle threat.
“No, but Mrs. Hudson will.”
The Chilgrave concubines stood in a group, listening as the attendant read out the night's assignments.
“Oh. Uh, sure.”
“I took them!” He shouted. “I took your Hob Nobs!”
"Label this shite!" John growled. "We've talked about this a thousand times."
“He just wants to show off who has the biggest army.”
kind of pain.
“Oh. You’re welcome.”
“Nothing.” John shook out the rope. Sherlock stared at him, his deducing face slipping on.
“Thanks.” He stepped out of the flat and froze. A stranger was clutching Sherlock’s leash. His back was to John but the look of anger and fear on his sub’s face was palpable.
He looked up the trellis and vertigo tilted his vision crazily to the left. He blinked and looked down, staring at a pile of pebbles on the dirt and resting his hand on the wooden slats. His stomach flopped dangerously and he groaned low in his throat. A night of cheap alcohol, opium, and not much food would do this, he reasoned. Scaling the trellis in his current state was unwise. However, knocking on the front door would alert everyone to his presence. It was paramount that Mycroft not discover him in this state. He would lecture and shout and it would be so unbearably tedious.
“Tell him.” John said.
Sherlock obeyed, picking a folded blanket up by the corner and dragging it to the sofa. He curled up, leaning into John's side. They arranged the thick sherpa throw over themselves and John put his arm around Sherlock's shoulders. They watched the various bickering family members and minor disasters and by the time cousin Eddie showed up, Sherlock had snickered three times and nuzzled into John's neck twice.
“Love?” John pushed into the flat with two bulging plastic bags. “I didn’t know what flavor you wanted so I just bought everything they had.” He dumped the bags on the counter.
“What did I say?” John asked.
“I’ll give you a compress.” Molly said confidently. “Something to take the swelling down.”
Sherlock wandered into the sitting room a few days later, his blue dressing gown half off his shoulder and his mouth set firmly in a pout. There hadn’t been a case in ages! The criminal classes seemed to have found their collective morals, much to his chagrin, and it had been tedious and dull for days. Even Lestrade had nothing for him. He angrily threw his dressing gown higher up his body and crossed his arms. John was sitting on the sofa with the paper, ankle on knee, reading. Sherlock dropped to the other end of the sofa like a sack of flour and curled into a ball.
certainly liked the idea. He opened the oil and dribbled some into his hands. A refreshing, masculine cedar and mint scent, sweetened with a tinge of almond filled his nose and he placed both hands on the small of John’s back before sweeping them firmly up either side of his spine.
“The Olecranon Process.”
“Yes. In fact, I very much feel like taking you right down into subspace.”
“I would think a bright boy like you would know better. Not to mention it’s against school rules.”
“Thanks.” He hung up.
"And that makes it okay? What happens when someone finds out?" Mycroft's voice took on an edge and he gave his brother a small, fake smile. "It's only a matter of time, brother. They already call you the "Mad Prince." Don't give them a reason to call you the "Addict Prince" as well."
“Cold?” John asked, taking his arm.
"Good causes are overrated."
“What are you doing in there?” Sherlock was outside the door, yelling and pounding.
“Think it over,” John suggested. “We don’t need to decide today. We’re still feeling each other out, you know? We’ll just…one day at a time.” John scooped up some eggs. They had gone cold, but he ate them anyway.
“When did you go to the pub?” Sherlock asked, taking another drag.
“Yes John.” He sighed.
“Sherlock.” John squeezed his hand and gave him his best ‘I’m smiling but you’re toeing the line’ smile. “Are you terrorizing the staff while I’m not here, sweetheart?”
“She was his sub, not his friend.” Sherlock said.
Sherlock winced.
“You gained two pounds while you were gone.”
“Where did you two go out to eat?” Sherlock asked.
A nod. John took his hand and lead him to the loo.
Sherlock beamed,
"Oh." He scowled. "My brother dragged me along because he's a nosy git who won't stay out of my life."
John froze. His voice was like dark chocolate caramel cake and John's insides withered with lust. The taller man smiled as if he knew exactly what power his voice held.
Sherlock rolled out of bed and grabbed the excellent tea that always magically appeared hot at his bedside when he woke up. He wandered to the window with the fine cup cradled in one hand. His rooms overlooked the orchards and he could see workers already toiling among the apple and cherry trees, chopping through hard, near-frozen ground, laying fertilizer, and preparing for spring's new growth. Sherlock drained his teacup and set it on the mantle for someone to retrieve later. He grabbed a dried licorice root out of the cup of water on the mantle and clamped his teeth down on it. The fibrous interior split and the soft splinters rubbed over his teeth, cleaning them and filling his mouth with a faint sugary fennel taste. He left the stick in his mouth and threw open his wardrobe and regarded his clothes. He prodded the mushy fibers with his tongue as he decided what to wear for this inane breakfast with his brother. He debated about not even going, but Mycroft would send guards and dogs out if need be. Ulgh.
John was different though, hadn’t he come to terms with that an age ago? He bit down on the ball as John moved the flogger down to his arse. He swatted his bare cheeks and Sherlock clenched and grunted after each whack. The pain of it was getting pretty sharp and hot tears filled his eyes. He blinked them away and then suddenly, he couldn’t breathe. He blinked again and reflexively inhaled through his mouth. Nothing got past the gag and the tears spilled out of his eyes.
The chair scraped the floor in the kitchen and Sherlock, decked out in his usual loafing-around-the-flat attire of pajamas and dressing gown, appeared in the room and stared at the screen, brow furrowed as if identifying clues on a case. John rolled his eyes. "C'mere and sit." He patted the sofa cushion. "Grab the blanket and let's cuddle."
“Me neither. Never underestimate Mrs. Hudson.” Sherlock said sagely.
"Sherlock."
“Yes.” Sherlock called. The door opened and John glanced at both of them, his gaze lingering with Sherlock’s, before sitting at his tea again. It had cooled significantly and he sipped it fast while it was still warm. Greg looked at him, sitting with his ankles crossed, gulping from the paper cup and aiming heart eyes at Sherlock, like being away from him for even five minutes had been an eternity. Good Lord they were in love.
"Shift to the right, love, would you?" He asked. She did and he was able to see a bit better in the nearby ray of morning sunlight. He visually examined her vulva.
“The police were here just two days ago talking to me about it.” He said in a sympathetic voice. “It was alarming to have Scotland Yard’s finest show up on my doorstep,”
She pulled some of the herb branches towards herself and began stripping the leaves from the stems and dropping them into a small white marble pestle to be crushed and dried.
“No.” Greg huffed a laugh. “It’s all for show. Sounds like the trip to the coast didn’t go well.”
“A bit.” He said.
Further back in the line, a woman was demonstrating on another woman the best way to pleasure a guest who had particular tastes. A few other men and women watched, clearly aroused. John ignored them. He ignored a lot of what went on in the herana. His nights were filled with guests ordering him about in a variety of creative ways and his days were punctuated by meals, medicine, and sleep, or what he could get of it. He’d not had a good night’s sleep in six months. There herana was never quiet. Even at it’s emptiest he could count on people to be snoring, talking, groaning, coughing, fighting, or having sex. Fights like the one Buck had started with him so long ago occurred daily. Many of the concubines had no qualms about taking stimulants to boost testosterone and arousal to prepare for a guest. Any energy left over after tending the guests found it’s way out in the form of a bloody, bare-knuckle brawl. John and Molly, the two most capable healers, were bandaging cuts and giving out pain-relieving teas, tinctures, poultices, and ointments every day.
John slid the phone in his pocket and noticed Mike glancing at his watch.
it?” Sherlock snarled. He leaned up on an elbow, facing his brother. He wanted to get up, but he was sore and his movements would reflect it. Mycroft could probably deduce everything just by how they were laying, but Sherlock was unwilling to give him extra ammo.
“I don’t give toss about the sheets.” John said, an amused smile on his face (even as he made a mental note not to let Mrs. Hudson near this particular load of laundry). “Answer me.” He squeezed Sherlock’s body.
"Yes, your Highness?" She asked, all eager to please concern.
"Sherlock…" Mike muttered quietly.
“Just thinking about what I’m going to do to you. Give me your hands.”
“And I have a problem with big idiots like you who try to start shit for no reason.” John said. He anticipated the punch but he didn’t anticipate Buck’s mates appearing out of the ether to back him up. After that John’s memory of the ensuing fight was blurry. He remembered punching Buck before getting slammed in the solar plexus. John kneed a groin and a fist pummeled across his eye. Huge armor-clad arms yanking him away from the fray, shouting, swearing A thwack to the left bicep with a club made him yelp.
She laughed, the color high on her cheeks. "No, no. I make this every year. It's my holiday drinky recipe."
“John, what are you doing?”
"Well, there
“Sure!” She waved good bye and kept talking to Lestrade.
"Thank you, darling." He said.
"It's for a good cause." John said. He glanced over Sherlock. He wasn't wrong. The "Santa's elf" costume Sherlock was sporting was a garish blend of bright green, screaming red, and snow white.
"Good policy." She said. "See you around, John."
“Mmm.”
"Well, you have duties here‒"
“That would mean there wasn’t a lot of tree cover if he could see the moon the whole time. The road was dirt.”
Moriarty had a whole group of new visitors come in and John was booked with three people in one day and five people the next.
"You will." Sherlock nodded. "I promise."
“When can I leave?” Sherlock asked. John reluctantly pulled away but his hand lingered in his sub’s.
“It’s part of the vitals.” John said.
"This is how it's going to be." Mycroft said. His voice was marginally calmer. "I care about you too much too see you destroy yourself. Now," He adjusted his shirt. "We will have breakfast tomorrow, as you chose to be selfish today. I don't want to see you until then. We depart the day after tomorrow. Make sure your bags are packed."
Sherlock spared him a glance. "Happens to the best of us."
Bill looked up at John, his dark eyes glowing in the flickering lantern light. "What you think?"
John nodded at the cooler and Sherlock opened it up. There were two pieces of dark brown tissue on ice.
John put the rest of the clothes away, hurrying the basket back to her. He had a shift.
“Please, sir! I’m sorry!” Sherlock shuddered and pleasure pooled in his hips and danced up his spine. He twisted up, sneaking his hand back to try and protect his bum.
"Make a new one. I'll get you more silk." He shrugged.
Sherlock stared at him. “Like what, then? What would you want to do?”
“Say that again.” He pointed at John.
"Better?"
"Come hold this." Sherlock commanded. John went around the counter and held tight to the glass bowl Sherlock dropped in his hands. He attacked the dough with a handheld mixer and a silicone scraper. John staggered under the pressure of Sherlock's violent mixing and adjusted his stance. He held the bowl tighter, hugging it to his belly. The handheld buzzed in the bowl and the whole thing vibrated like a full beehive. John studiously ignored the buzzing going on not more than eight inches above his cock.
“Breaking and entering.”
“That’s not true.” John squeezed his hand.
we do?" John challenged. Sherlock squinted his eyes and looked at John from head to foot.
“Not throwing it off.” Sherlock said quietly. “You can hang your shirts and put your trousers in this drawer. I can move these things to this dresser.” Sherlock indicated a set of drawers on the other side of the room.
“Good. Then I’ll see you later.” He kissed John on the cheek before striding off up the pavement.
“Something weird just happened to me.” John said, stepping into 221B after Sherlock opened the door.
John brought the mug to the table.
“Mike.” John extended his hand to shake, recognition bouncing through his brain. “Yes, sorry, hello.”
"John," Marla said, worried, "he came inside me twice! I can't be shackled to a whelp. Can't you give me something?"
“What?” Sherlock blurted.
John has trouble focusing.
pain.”
“Hello, dear. I heard you were awake and I just wanted to bring this by for John.”
“I’m coming with you.” John said, stepping forward.
Mycroft’s face took on a pained, concerned look and he consulted a gold watch tucked into a pocket. “I’m afraid I don’t know. Now, what about my offer? I can make you wealthy, John.”
He crouched down before his sub, curling his hand in his hair and tilting his head up to look into his eyes. “Does anything feel too tight or uncomfortable?” He asked. Sherlock shook his head.
“You.”
Sherlock’s voice spoke in his head.
John looked up at him. He didn’t want Sherlock to leave. Not at all. He wanted him nearby. He was familiar and safe and John didn’t think of the war so much when he was nearby. For God’s sake, Sherlock had been
"Apologies." Sherlock mumbled. Paul continued to speak as if nothing had happened. "But a nice flavor and texture. The nuttiness really comes through and it has a nice crunch. The icing is a little too gooey, but the honey flavor was a pleasant surprise."
“No.” He glanced around the hospital room, then up at his dom. “I was walking, now I’m here.”
“He was an abusive sod who knew I had regular access to police. He was jealous and an idiot. Did I ever take Seb to crime scenes?”
“See if you can move.” John said. Sherlock shifted, a shy grin on his face. The ropes barely gave and he grunted, failing to shimmy free. He tried to twist around but all he managed was a few half hearted squirms and he looked up at John with something like pure happiness on his face. John stared for a few more moments, committing the image of Sherlock Bound and Happy to his memory.
“What are you printing?”
“This selection is awful.” Sherlock grumped.
Greg nodded.
He put the phone away and drummed his fingers along the armrest, waiting impatiently for Mycroft’s reply. It was a long shot, but it was possible that the killer would be in CCTV footage. If there was a camera near the pub, maybe ‘Jazz’ had walked out with someone, or the murderer could have followed him. It was worth a try at any rate. Footage had broken cases in the past. And any extra work that he could create for Mycroft was always a bonus.
"You have plenty of other dirty business to attend to." Sue winked and Mel hooted and John smiled as he cleaned off the last of the drips.
Sherlock glanced up at Lestrade. He was crouched near Logan—still conscious somehow—two gloved fingers looking for his pulse in his neck. He was speaking into his phone.
“Call him.” Mike suggested.
Sherlock leaned forward and rested his arms on the carpet. John tugged his cock back between his spread legs and tied the taut leather to the lower part of the fire grate where it wasn’t too hot.
He'd had a bad smoke years ago and he remembered throwing up a lot while Mrs. Hudson wiped his brow and looked on disapprovingly. He didn't remember feeling so awful in the aftermath. The ceiling tilted dangerously and Sherlock closed his eyes.
A languid, “hm?” erupted from his throat.
"Dry."
John kissed his nose and Sherlock ran off. He switched on his microscope and opened the utensil drawer, collecting a few scalpels. He grabbed some bottles of chemicals out from under the sink, mumbling to himself all the while about data and hypotheses. John was so delighted he could have exploded. He watched his sub fondly as he threw a pillow over the stool to cushion it and then muttered some more about tissue something or other. John turned away to go back to his book—
Slowly he felt John relax. A soft hand came up to pet his damp hair and then warm lips were pressed to his scalp. John tightened his hold on him and they both fell asleep.
Sherlock took a shaky breath.
"Ah." John nodded. "To answer your question? No.” John clenched his fist and stared Sherlock in the eye. "I don't regret being a highwayman for a second."
“How do you know?”
“I need you stretch out a wing for me.” A bit of feather fluttered under the door.
“Are these the trousers your would-be killer wore?” Sherlock thrust the paper with the image of the checkered clothes at him.
Sherlock closed the door.
Sherlock yanked his service bell.
"Oh, uh, yes." John stepped forward. He took the dripping sponge and gulped when Sherlock leaned forward in the tub, baring his back to John. John stared at the smooth pale skin. His gaze skimmed the muscles of his shoulders and biceps and the long line of his spine. Old bruises on his arm from where he’d been thrown from the horse were fading into yellow. He swallowed and squeezed the sponge in the water. Sherlock was gorgeous but being forced repeatedly to fuck and be fucked had rendered John intimidated  by sex. The mere thought of being intimate with another person made his stomach ache. Best not think about it. He knelt beside the tub and scrubbed the sponge over that lovely back.
John pursed his lips.
He paused, but settled his coat on his shoulders. "I have to go." He looked at Mike, then at John, his gaze lingering on the war vet. John got up and hobbled over.
“Sleepy?” John was amused.
“As long as it takes.” Sherlock shrugged. He was annoyed, John could tell from the set of his shoulders and the quick, jerky movements of his hands. He pulled his coat on and John stood up, coming to him and hugging him. He breathed in the scent of his neck, the smell dizzyingly relaxing. “Be careful.” John whispered.
Sherlock crouched down again and slipped on a blue glove. “I looks like there’s some knife wounds.” He tilted the stiff, spongy head back and eyed the slitted flesh on the neck.
“Why do we need to have a party at all?” Sherlock groused
“Tying yourself up again?” He said. “Goodness you are bored.”
“Oy!” Mike spluttered on his wine and stared at Sherlock’s neck. The detective frowned and reached up to touch—ah, the collar. Already he was as used to it as if it had been there his whole life.
Coel grinned and Sherlock sobered up quickly. “I just can’t believe he’s gone you know? How long were you guys together? It seemed like forever.”
Sherlock shrugged, paused, and nodded.
"Mmm." Sherlock put his mug in the sink and went into the other room and went to find his shoes and suitcoat. It was an odd combination‒loose, used sweats and expensive Italian shoes, but he didn't care. Neither of them had much in the way of belongings. John grabbed his suitcase handle and Greg wished them both a good day.
“Oh I’m so glad to finally meet you!” Mrs. Hudson hugged her and they went into the kitchen, talking a mile a minute about recipes and cooking techniques. John nodded, satisfied. He knew they’d get along.
"Keep telling yourself that."
"They're always grateful for my help, the dolts. Without me, half of London's criminals would still be going free. They couldn't even catch the idiot stealing from their own police force!"
“Hush!”
Mike smiled softly. More pieces of this "illness" were falling into place.
Blair sat down in the visitor’s chair beside the bed, clasping her hand in Jenkins’. The others wisely sat on the opposite side of the room, the three of them stuffed on the little visitor’s sofa.
John smiled. "There's a really simple explanation, mate."
carriage. The guard may as well paint a target on the sides. If safety was an issue, Sherlock thought they’d be better off wearing sackcloths and walking on foot. No one would think to look for the King and Prince meandering in the mud as commoners; he knew that from his experience in the Barrens. He’d once suggested this to Lestrade. His response had been to blink at him owlishly before giving him a firm, “no.”
Please come as soon as possible Mr. Holmes. I have enough money to get you on a six am flight tomorrow morning.
“A tad dry.” Sherlock said.
"Is it about us?" John joked, popping the rest of the snowman into his mouth.
“How was that, love.” John sat beside him, surprised when Sherlock sat up and kissed him, then nuzzled his face into his neck. “That good?”
that he missed the question John asked.
"What are you writing all the time in that notebook?" John asked one afternoon. Sherlock was curled in his chair, his black-covered notebook on his knees as he made a quick note of the color of John's jumper and the fact that he just took a red and green mug from the cabinet.
John fit the wooden box into the suitcase at Sherlock’s insistence, then he unclipped his chain. “Get dressed again.”
Only when the spray turned cold did they regretfully shut the water off and pat themselves down with towels. Sherlock grabbed John’s hand and pulled him back to bed, shoving the ropes to the floor and dragging John down into the sheets with him, snuggling him like he was a plush toy. John grinned at his adorable possessiveness and settled beside him. He had never looked forward to moving house so much in his life.
John stared at him, incredulous.
She hesitated and looked away.
“Why should I? Who is this? Did you just hack this bloke’s phone?”
The judges and hosts came out to more applause. Mary was holding the glass cake stand. Paul and Mel and Sue clutched massive pink and yellow bouquets of flowers. John snuck around towards the edge of the crowd, standing just past Sherlock's family.
John closed his eyes. If Sherlock was going to insist on being an arse to the cops, John was going to need to draw the line somewhere.
John's voice was firm.
He blinked a few times, then straightened. John wiped his thumb across the tears on his face and sat in the red armchair, knees spread.
“Understood.” John said with a fond gleam in his eye.
“Said he was interested in your welfare.”
Sherlock’s eyes fluttered closed and he sank against the wall, leaning his head back as the beautiful heat enveloped his cock.
“Listen,” John said, staring him in the eye. “I don’t want you to be unnecessarily rude. Remember that conversation we had on discipline? Consider this a rule.”
"When I got back from Hibern." Sherlock said.
“Well people are idiots.” John muttered.
“John…” Sherlock’s voice was a low whine.
“Whenever you’re ready.” Greg murmured, turning the machine on. A little red light popped on. “If you need to take a break or anything, just say so.”
“Yeah, sure.” The guy offered his lighter and Sherlock eyed his fingernails and knuckles. Filthy, just like Dixon’s had been.
The concubines were gathered around an attendant, waiting to hear the list of that night’s assignments.
“You know I’d call you if I had anything.”
“Oh that can certainly be arranged…but let’s eat first. I’m famished.”
Sherlock was doing marvelous things with his tongue and John found his hands were getting greedy. He squeezed Sherlock's arse impertinently, making him growl and kiss harder. John nipped his lip and Sherlock startled and they finally pulled apart, mussed and panting.
“Alright.” John soothed, signing the receipt. “We’ll go home and you can settle.”
He hung up his coat and sat on the chair for three seconds before his bottom convinced him to stand. He leaned over the desk with a dreamy little sigh and logged in to his website.
“Sh, relax.” John’s hand was on his nape. “Take deep breaths.” His voice was commanding and gentle and instead of relaxing, Sherlock found he was getting even more keyed up and aroused. They were
Sherlock looked in the mirror, touching it. He shrugged. “It’s nice.”
Sherlock let him go, amused. His libido heated up, tingling and sparkling. His own cock twitched again. His body was slow to catch up, but it would get there eventually. Sherlock rested his hand on John’s left shoulder, just above the rough scar tissue lacing through his flesh. That was different. That was interesting, just like the man himself. John went very still and Sherlock glanced at him. “Can I touch?”
"Why?" Sherlock seemed genuinely surprised.
“I’m thirsty too.” Sherlock said, wondering just how long he could draw this out.
"Yes." John nodded.
“I’m just not interested.” John stared at him and a soft knock on the door interrupted. Anthea stepped inside the room.
“Prove it. Straighten your elbow.” John said, folding his arms and eying the obviously sore limb.
“Not really.” John’s voice was raspy, despite the tea.
"He didn't kill you." Sherlock finished. "Why keep you alive?"
The leather cords smacked across his shoulder and Sherlock yelped around the gag, jerking in the restraints. That flogger packed quite a punch. John must be feeling
“Do you have an arch enemy?” John asked, breaking the kiss. At this, Sherlock’s expression darkened. He stepped back from John and swore aloud.
“Poor loved sub.” John teased him gently and kissed his temple. Sherlock shied away from it. “Stop. You smell all…muffiny.”
“I should have known.”
“Yes.” He nodded.
“I need to get more clothes, then. I keep wearing the same five shirts to work.”
“Why does Owen not have this?” He asked.
cozy?” Mycroft stepped through the doorway and Sherlock groaned into the pillow.
Paul took one bite of John's completed Focaccia. "It's raw in the middle."
"Just go away." He pleaded. He set the violin down on a chair and dropped face-down into his bed.
"Don't worry." Greg told him. "He's asleep and safe."
“No. Now I’m in your flat. I hope you don’t mind me spending the night.” John added.
Sherlock’s phone bleeped. He ignored it.
“If that wasn’t enough,” he said in a haughty tone to Lestrade, “his feet prove my theory.”
John shook his head and grinned grimly. “No. No love, come up here. Take your clothes off.” He tugged on Sherlock’s collar and his sub climbed up into the bed.
“I’m sorry.”
"Oh." John hummed sympathetically, drinking his beer. "I've been there. On both sides."
“Hello Sherlock!” She waved at him when he was on the landing. John was holding a blue cooler and thanking her profusely. He doubted it was lunch in there.
“Doesn’t tell us much.” John murmured.
"Then the rocks and ice will." Molly said, parroting what John had told her months ago. She moved away from Kate, searching the concubines and looking for that familiar face. Tears filled her eyes and she blinked them away. He couldn't have. John wouldn't do that, right? It had gotten worse for him but he seemed to be managing. The concubines relied on him for medical care and he kept himself busy with gathering supplies. He had purpose. She shook her head. Of course, that had all been prior to Jim's awful attack on him. Since then and since Sherlock leaving he hadn't been the same. She thought of John's gaunt face and the way he'd lose focus.
When John had scrubbed and washed every conceivable surface of Sherlock's back, he cleared his throat. "That's clean, then."
Sherlock looked up with a barely suppressed snarl.
He went into the foyer and closed the door behind. He shook the envelope. Nothing. Likely it wasn’t a bomb and it didn’t sound like there was powder or anything else in there. It bent easily and Sherlock opened it up. It wasn’t even sealed. He extracted the piece of A4 inside and blinked in horror at the content of the page. It was a collage. And it was from Sebastian. Photos of Sherlock taken from around the city were pasted onto the paper and little cutouts of hearts were surrounding the images. Seb had taken separate images of himself and put them beside Sherlock so it looked like they were beside each other in the photos.
He wasn’t, but… “A little bit.”
Sherlock lifted his hands, then lowered them again, pained. He had no idea where to put them. Seb’s kisses were never like this, never this gentle. He touched John’s knees, but that felt wrong, so he tried sliding them up his jeans-covered thighs. That just felt awkward, so he let them flop to the sofa and internally rolled his eyes. He had zero data to draw on. Seb had certainly never snogged him like this and before that there, well, really hadn’t been anyone else. Embarrassingly enough. Seb’s stupid drunk friends had, occasionally and against his will, pulled him into sloppy kisses after they came back into his dorm room after a long night drinking, but Sherlock hadn’t enjoyed that. Too…wet. Those were the nights he would sleep in the library. No one had ever been interested in him like John was at this moment…this genuine, curious experimental exploration. Sherlock’s hands twitched on the cushions and he hesitantly put his palms to John’s knees again.
“We need to ask a few questions if you’re up for it, Michael.” Greg told him in a softer tone.
“I’ll go with you.” Sherlock declared. “Then you can come back here and spend the night.”
“Loo?” John asked.
“Breakfast?” John opened the fridge and pulled out eggs and sausages. Sherlock opened two tins of beans and breakfast was prepared in no time. They didn’t even bother with plates, instead each grabbing forks and standing at the hob and eating everything right out of the hot pan. John popped a few pain pills with the food.
"Some got on your shirt, I'm sorry."
Sherlock scowled.
“Go on in.” John gentled his voice. “Your arm must be killing you. Let me look at it inside.”
“I swallowed it.” He looked surprised.
“Yes.” Lestrade said.
"I'm quaking." Sherlock stood, gave him a less-sarcastic bow, threw another wave to Greg, and departed.
“No cane?” She noticed.
They mutually left the rubbish on the table and went to the bathroom and stripped everything off. John eyed his marks again as Sherlock stepped into the tub. His dominance surged at the sight of his hurt, naked sub. "A cool shower." John said. "Heat won't be good for your skin."
distressed and he didn't quite know what to do with that feeling. He wanted to spirit John away from this awful place with its awful people but he knew he couldn't. Jim would never give John up.
The evening ran long and Sherlock didn’t even complain once to John about how bored he was. During dessert Mycroft lead a toast “to the happy couple.”
Sherlock raised a brow. "And then…? You ate it?"
He shrugged. "I'm sorry to be leaving."
“Just do your deductions.” John stood up and went to the DI. “Sorry, Greg. He’s…”
“Look,” Lestrade picked up a pen and tapped it a few times on the desk. He threw it down and stood up to pace. Sherlock watched, amused. “I may be way off here,” Lestrade said.
“Ever married?” John asked.
“Thanks.” He lit up and took a few puffs, handing the lighter back. “I heard what happened to Jeff.” He said, exhaling a cloud of smoke.
John placed the paddle against his bottom, a hint of cool flat rubber. It had the desired effect.
“Don’t.” He growled.
It did get easier. His therapist
"Molly. Christ. There's no way out?"
“I need to go to Belarus.”
Greg frowned, thinking, and wandered off. John glanced over his own recipe. "Bit rude." He mumbled.
“Mmmm.”
"Boys?" Mrs. Hudson was tromping up the steps. "Are you both up? Oh good. Try this." She held out a mug to John and set the other beside Sherlock's notes. John sniffed and drew back as if burned. "What is this? Ethanol?"
“Get the massage oil. Yellow glass bottle. It’s small.” John said. Sherlock rooted past the paddle and some cuffs and pulled out a little bottle of oil. “Yes, perfect, come to me now and kneel so I can tell you your punishment.”
“Yes, well. It’s to be expected. He’s a doctor.” He sipped the tea and Mike hid a knowing smile, excited. He’s got it bad for John! Wait ‘til I tell Betsy! Mike honestly could not think of a more perfect match for the surly detective. John was everything he needed, and it seemed that Sherlock was everything John needed. Ever since Mike had been at Uni, he’d had a knack for getting friends together. A sixth sense. He’d been a best man six times and had eleven godchildren. Filing that bit of information aside, Mike finished his tea with a smile on his face.
"I read about it for a case once." Sherlock said.
“Er, not as such. There’s many poisons that it could be. To be honest, I’m not sure how one would even determine which poison it is.”
“Up on the bed, love. Grab the headboard.” He moved his box to the floor and Sherlock jumped up. He lay carefully on his back in the pillows and put his arms over his head, holding tight to the wooden board. He spread his legs. John tugged off all his clothes and knelt up on the bed between his legs with the rope and some lube. John stared down at his submissive, his eyes warm with love. Sherlock raised an eyebrow and wiggled his hips. “Well, Captain Watson. You have me at your mercy.”
Sherlock shrugged helplessly. "Well, he's awful."
“John?” He called. “Come sit by me.”
“Hm.” John sat up against the headboard. “Come here, I’ll put this on and we can eat something.”
"He's been writing in that notebook for days." She said in a loud whisper.
“Hello again, sir. Did you forget something?”
“What do you think?” John asked, looking at the displayed bands. Nothing really jumped out, but if Sherlock had his heart set on something he’d relent. He would be the one wearing it, after all.
Molly bit her lip. “Er, she did say something about a riding crop...”
They set the large tote box in front of their coffee table and John went back at it. Sherlock put the kettle on.
“Toast?”
John shook his head so fast it left his vision swimming.
“How was Jenkins kidnapped?” John asked. “Did he go to the restaurant too? He had Rohypnol in his system but him and Blair never mentioned eating at
Sherlock nodded. “I, I like it on my throat when I’m, when I’m like this.” His whole body was warm and flushed from the spanking and John replaced the collar. He patted his thigh some more and petted his shoulders.
“Sherlock.” John spoke in his fake pleasant ‘be nice or else’ voice. “It’s a very nice selection. What about something blue or green to bring out your eyes?”
Suddenly, Logan looked up towards the front window, the curtains taped closed. He gripped the knife and lifted the curtain and peeked very carefully out the window, glancing up and down the dark road. Sherlock whimpered, unable to do anything but watch the crimson river slide out of his throbbing forearm. He really hoped the knife hadn’t nicked the radial artery. If it had, there wasn’t much time left. He rested his head back on the tarp, angry and terrified at how helpless he was.
This trusting vulnerability in the concubine made Sherlock's heart do something wobbly and he turned to face the window and the half-open drapes. He looked down into the dark courtyard below. He was finding himself becoming very fond indeed of John Watson.
are. Otherwise I don't take them."
The man gave him a prim smile and opened the file. “‘Wounded in action. Honorable discharge,’ it says here.”
“I did. You saved me.”
With Sherlock’s recruitment, the meal was prepared faster and they were soon seated and eating a fantastic lamb roast. John was beside Mike and across from Sherlock, who was next to Betsy.
.” Sherlock slapped his hand down on the table. “There’s always something….”
"You look nice." John handed him his coat. "Shall we?"
Then another:
John had never punched a woman in the face. When he and Harry were young they would hit each other and wrestle, but never in his adult life had he punched or even wanted to punch a woman in the face until now. His parents had raised him better than that, but at the raw expression of shameful pain on Sherlock’s face, John’s fist almost flew. Almost. The urge to sock Donovanacross the jaw took every fiber and ounce of willpower he had to refuse. He flexed his hand a few times and took a deep breath. His inner dom roared in rage and he grit his teeth.
John stirred beside him. “S’he gone?”
to see him naked, thanks.
They took the Tube to the first shop on Sherlock’s list. It was a small place that specialized in custom ordering and hand made items that unfortunately didn’t carry much in the way of collars. They perused the glass case, looking at the displayed velvet and suede options. John licked his lips. He’d never bought a collar for a sub before. He’d never wanted to. These were nothing like the cheap play collar Sherlock had worn during his punishment. These were expensive and made to last and John was getting nervous and excited just looking at everything. For the first time, what he had with Sherlock was suddenly shifting into long term. Moving in hadn’t inspired this in him much at all. But the collars? John found he didn’t even look at other subs anymore. Even if he did see someone devastatingly attractive, he didn’t even feel the urge to act on the attraction. His time with Sherlock, even though it had been less than six months, had matured him. This was real and, looking at the collars and the longevity they signified, he wanted it. This wasn’t marriage, yet, but it was serious commitment. He was a sappy romantic sod when it came to stuff like this and he wondered what Sherlock would say if he knew.
The palace was abuzz with butlers, footmen, maids, and miscellaneous servants whose jobs and titles he didn't care to know. He saw young workers bustling about with piles of linens and attendants doing whatever tasks they'd been assigned. He walked past the endless parlors and receiving rooms, guest rooms, spare rooms and rooms that had no purpose at all. He came to a hub where two hallways intersected. Turning right would take him to the main library and its high arched ceilings and squashy chairs. If he turned left, he would come across the herana and beyond that, Sherrinford’s huge main kitchen. He kept moving forward in a straight line, dodging maids. He didn't really pay attention to the servants and no one acknowledged him except to pause and incline their heads. They feared him, he suspected. He knew among some circles that he was known as "The Mad Prince."
“Of course, but we need to talk first because your rude habits are apparently going to be causing some issues.”
"A concubine can't displace a prince from his bed. You're royalty."
"It's not too bad." John said. "You'll need a bandage though." He glanced back to the medic's stations. Still gone.
His filthy clothes were gone and he let the blanket hit the ground before he stepped into the tub and sank into the water, letting out a sigh of pleasure. He slid down the copper side of the bath until everything below his nostrils was cradled by hot clean water.  He allowed his mind to drift aimlessly as he took simple pleasure in the feel of the water encasing his body. Once the temperature of the bath had dropped a few degrees, his thoughts came back to the arrow. Who had tried to kill him?
“Alright?” John asked. Sherlock nodded.
“Good. That’s exactly what I was hoping for. Up, now.” John supported his elbow as he rolled to his feet. Sherlock tugged his hands again and bit his lip, feeling very vulnerable and chastened after his dom’s first punishment. “C’mon.” John pulled him to a corner by the closed curtains. “Kneel down.”
he felt. Satisfied. Content.
John cleared his throat and looked down at his sub, so placid and calm on his knees. “That was excellent.” He said.
He answered after two rings.
"You're too slow."
"Need help?" He turned around and glanced hungrily at the food.
Sherlock shrugged. He was silent for a good ten minutes and John let him work through it,simply stroking his neck and shoulders. Eventually he spoke. “Punish me, John. I should have told you. Give me the paddle again.”
The dom sighed and stood up, regarding Sherlock regretfully. “I wish I didn’t have to do this, but you just won’t shut up.”
Twenty minutes later, they were back in their flat. John slipped out of his jacket, weary and eying the sofa eagerly. He didn’t have to work today, and an hour or two to watch telly sounded pretty nice. He didn’t like this case. He didn’t like that Dixon looked like Sherlock. He didn’t like how gruesomely he’d been killed. He pinched the ridge between his eyes and wished that the killer was caught and this ridiculousness was all over. Sherlock’s phone chimed and he grabbed it from his pocket.
"I really don't think anything's broken." Sherlock said mildly. He left the gown on the table and carefully pulled on the Tshirt. "I'm sore as hell but the pain isn't sharp. I know what a broken bone feels like."
John clenched his fist and felt something dominant bloom in his chest. Those texts plus this damned case were just raking him in the wrong way.
A mug of steaming coffee was beside a plate of buttered toast on the counter top. The television was on at a low volume in the other room and John was at the desk, reading the paper. It was a wonderfully domestic, normal thing to wake up to and Sherlock scowled harder, the fight draining out of him somewhat. He didn’t want a dom.
"Mingle. Get some food."
"Hm?"
"Absolutely. Do you do that with everyone?"
“But Inspector—”
John was going out of his way to get him a sling. That was completely unneeded.
He paused, then lifted the mask. No point now if Sherlock knew who he was. “Because you’re going to hurt your dom.”
tw on-screen rape. Thoughts of suicide. This chapter is about as dark as this fic gets.
“I was stabbed in the left calf with a two and a half inch blade. I’m stitched up and packed with gauze and the good drugs. I’m expected to make a full recovery, as are you.”
They laughed until John composed himself, clearing his throat and looking into Sherlock’s eyes.
"You've been naughty too, your Majesty." John said.
"I didn't see either of you helping, thanks very much!" John said. He wasn't really angry. It had been pretty funny.
“Whoa.” He said, swaying a little. “This
“Alim, Georgia, fucking Ridgewell Brimble—all of them are supposed to be fucking dead! Damn that assassin to hell!”
“Sherlock’s welfare of course. Subs can be so difficult to manage, being the weaker dynamic and all.”
To Sherlock's horror, his throat was tightening and his eyes were filling with tears.
"Being a highwayman."
“Answer me.”
“Alright.” She wrote some more and he rubbed his thumb over his bent knuckles.
John put a plate on the table, piled with orange, strawberry, lemon-lime, and blackcurrant tiny cakes. Sherlock selected a strawberry one and bit into it, then eyed the spilling plastic bags in the kitchen. Only forty bazillion more to eat.
“Of course.” Nina left.
John was sitting on the sofa,  a glass of cold eggnog in his hand, a favorite old Christmas jumper keeping him warm. He laughed at the television when hapless buffoon Clark Griswold realized he'd forgotten to bring a saw into the woods to cut down the family tree. His and Sherlock's own little Christmas tree was in front of the window on a small table they'd dragged out from behind Sherlock's chair. Mrs. Hudson had a merry time decorating the little plastic tree with John. They'd had to coax Sherlock to hang even one ornament but John had seen him in the evenings, staring at the glowing, sparkling tree while lost in thought. John was sure he enjoyed it, even if he pretended not to.
of him, but not today. Not yet. He was still trying this out, still trying to earn his trust. John wanted to do it right and not go too fast. He bent one knee, placing it between Sherlock’s warm thighs on the cushion. The sub stiffened and John leaned over his bare back, inhaling the smell of him. He gripped Sherlock’s left forearm, his palm firm on the warm skin, holding him against the sofa. Sherlock’s breaths were fast and steady, every sense attuned to the aroused dom leaning over his back. It was vulnerable as hell for a sub to have a fully clothed, semi-known dom looming over him like this, especially one as horny as John was now. Sherlock didn’t struggle or try to heave him off, and John took that as a good sign.
John sighed and Greg heard the
“I know. I’m sorry.”
"Not as such." Sherlock snapped the notebook closed. His phone vibrated with Mycroft's name across the screen. Sherlock made a face and shoved the phone deep into the chair.
. “It’s fine John. It’s nothing.” His tone still left a lot to be desired.
"It’s the only explanation of all the facts!" Sherlock retorted.
Anthropophagy — eating human flesh
“Thanks, Melissa” John said. “I’ll see if I can get something in him.”
Sherlock turned around and saw his dom with his arms crossed tight, staring up at him with a less-than impressed expression. “I don’t want you to be a paradigm of manners, love. Sally I let slide because she was an arse first, but what you said about Lestrade was bloody uncalled for. Do we need to revisit our conversation about when I rein you in?”
He reached a hand out to touch him. “It’s alrig—”
“Take it outside. I’ll meet you.”
“Hi.” She didn’t look up.
“This is quite a collection.” She said, peering over the charts and photos and copied file pages pinned up above the sofa.
The sound of a lone violin cut through the air and his ears pricked. He smiled and sipped his cup, heading in the direction of the familiar-sounding violin. Sherlock was standing between two berry-and-pinecone-laden shrubs, a vision in his long coat. The honey red violin was tucked under his chin as he played an embellished version of "We Wish You a Merry Christmas." His eyes were closed and his long fingers moved precisely, perfectly, hitting each note and trill. John loved watching him play. He was also glad to see Sherlock had the sense he'd not: he was wearing a beanie‒John's beanie‒and his blue scarf.
“Please, have a seat.” Coel gestured to the sofa and Sherlock sat down, his knees together and his shoulders hunched as he peered around. “Would you like something to drink? Tea or coffee or anything?”
was another part of it. John was giving him control. John had been giving him complete control this whole time. The safeword insistence, the quiet request that he undress that one night. Even when he wanted tea, he
"Brilliant." John glanced at the plate she put down on the table. A dozen brightly decorated biscuits in the shapes of trees and snowmen sat on a gold-edged plates shaped like a star. In the other room, Sherlock was furiously scrawling in the notebook again, glancing up now and then at Mrs. Hudson's apron which was covered in a pattern of Father Christmas and his reindeer.
Silence.
“Oh!” He hurried aside.
“I’d like you to keep it. I’d like you to move in with me.”
“Stop!” John pleaded.
The day after the new year, a link went up on "The Science of Deduction" titled "Measuring the Wonder of the Season."
Sherlock didn’t tell him about all the research he had done earlier. “I have a riding crop.” He said. “I also would be interested in some, what do they call it, sensation play?”
John drummed his fingers on Sherlock’s back. He looked over his shoulder. The cream was just behind him, and really, he could reach Sherlock’s arse the way he was curled up. Was he going to indulge in this ridiculous behavior? Yes, yes he was. He managed to free his arm and grope behind himself until he found the tube.
“Wh-what? Oh!” He blinked up at Sherlock, pushing the cap back off his face. “Yeah, I’ve been practicing for years. I’m going to reach black belt this year. Do you practice too?”
His mount, a flighty, nervous little thing, danced sideways as some dead leaves blew across the dirt path. Sherlock jerked it back to center. Charcoal grey clouds rolled overhead and the misty air was touched with chill damp. The forest was thick with tall pine and ancient oak trees and the air was sweet with sap and heavy with moisture. Moss clung to rough bark and the trees were so thick in places it looked like twilight rather than late morning.
"Really?" Her eye took on a particular gleam that he liked.
“Jesus Christ!” Coel yelped. “He showed up here! I’ve never even met him before tonight!”
“How long ago?”
John squeezed his hand and Lestrade sat back in his chair. “John?” He asked, writing notes, “do you have anything to add?”
It was the longest hour of John’s life. He threw his gear in his office and cleaned up the exam room after the last patient, waving a quick good bye to Sarah before practically running out into traffic at the first cab he saw. It was a cool dusk evening and the asphalt roads were slicked with the remnants of the day’s rain. John drummed his fingertips on the cab’s leather armrest on the door and had his wallet out at the corner of Marylebone and Baker Street, glancing at the meter and pulling out notes before the cab even stopped.
He looked over his shoulder and gave John a devilish smile. "Watch me."
"Almost done." John wiped his fingers on a tea towel and tossed it over his shoulder. He piled sausages and beans and eggs and tomatoes and toast in a plate and put it on the table in front of Greg.
“Comfortable?” John asked.
“Will you sit down?” John told him.
The dom jumped up and headed for the door. Sherlock saw the gun tucked into the back of his jeans and he grabbed his phone off the side table. He recognized that tread. Too heavy for Mrs. Hudson, to measured to be Lestrade. He sent a text to Mycroft:
He folded his arms and stared down his sub on the sofa, his body language and expression conveying exactly how displeased he was with Sherlock’s comments.
“Strip your clothes off!”
“Uh, do you want to sit—”
“I think so.” She vanished and then returned moments later with the three collars in a deep grey color. They followed her to a sort of semi closed off fitting area complete with mirrors and lots of lights. Sherlock picked one up and admired the leather in the bright little spotlights. It was less than an inch wide and solid grey, down to the buckle. He looked at John.
He did a double take and held the lantern closer.
Conversation around John swelled.
Sherlock cinched his gown and opened the door.
“Do you really think now is the best time to give me more cheek and terrible attitude?” John asked. “You’re smarter than that, Sherlock. Much smarter. This…whatever this is, stops now, understand?”
“Oh, I have to, I have to come, John.” He was right. His cock was red and hard as steel.
“Of course.”
. He closed the drawer seconds before Vincent came back in the room with a bottle of water and a tumbler of whiskey.
“Duly noted.” Sherlock said in a dry, pained voice. “Now please leave.”
“They weren’t happy with you being in the will?”
John nodded. "My wife died a year after we wed. Typhoid."
“Hand me my phone.”
“Is he bothering you, love?” He asked Sherlock.
"Too much?" John frowned.
“Fine. Fine…” Sherlock paced into the kitchen, then paced back out with his tea in his hand.
“Mmm.”
"A happy ending with a cherry on top."
"Oh aye, I've heard of it. We don't hang it about though."
“Michael, can you tell us about the night you were attacked?”
"Yeah, I've heard that one's good." He lied. He'd read
“Sherlock,” Mike had asked, “why don’t you behave for mum and dad?”
“Ah what the
“I hate doms.” Sherlock growled.
“It’s nice, isn’t it?” John asked.
Sherlock looked him over and glanced and the name tag on his dark apron that he had clearly personally decorated. His name—Callum—was in big letters, and underneath it was a small sticker bearing an image.
They sat in the silence for a moment, John absently stroking Sherlock’s hip in the dark.
"Uh, of course, John. Are you alright with that?" He scratched the back of his head.
“Eyes forward.”
"No. I had to,” he paused, “dismount quickly." He shoved the doors to his guest suite open and stomped into the room. He immediately went to the service bell and yanked it.
"If you'd like." The female medic said. "Nothing felt broken when we palpated the area, but it's up to you."
Greg roared with laughter as Sherlock picked up the stained ornament and brought it to the sitting room, to their tree decorated with bright lights, caution tape, little skulls, and perfectly ordinary gold, red, and green spheres. He hung the star on a bare branch.
“You’re my favorite muffin.” John said, grinning at the face Sherlock made.
Sherlock did, taking a deep breath. His brain was flying, taking in sensations and emotions, cataloging and remembering for his log.
"Sherlock just caught someone embezzling at Scotland Yard, didn't you?" Betsy said, encouraging him to speak.
"It's because you helped me." Sherlock muttered. "You wouldn’t have burnt them if not for me."
“Yes, yes I am.” He wriggled his arse. “If you want to we could…”
Mycroft snapped the file shut and stepped into John’s space. “But
is. Want some advice? Stay away from Prince Holmes."
"I can't believe you made a bet on who'd win that football game--against his favorite team no less!"
“Yes.”
“Stuff for work. Hush now, you’re still in corner time.”
“And it wouldn’t be enjoyable for me if you were to fuck me now either.”
“They gave us some of the ointment, and we can get the ‘scrip filled soon.”
John stood up fifteen minutes later and closed his computer with a sigh. “Alright. I’ll put you in bondage and then we can go.”
"So did you." John said. "We have rules that‒" A mighty yawn interrupted his thought.
"Sherlock."
"You're hurt." John countered, his face softening. "That's why I'm Defensive. The French shite suppressant wore off an age ago."
“Fuck the rules.” Sherlock growled. A sharp, hard smack landed on his bum and Sherlock gasped.
"Mm, no response? I'll have you making all sorts of noises before the end of the night, my little whore. I've got you for the rest of the evening and I plan to take my revenge."
Sherlock sulked into the sitting room and dropped to the sofa, propping his foot up on the edge of the table. “Will this take long?”
"You charmer, you. You're welcome back here anytime, John Watson."
"What? You've been going on about 'this cute bloke' since week one and now you're not even going to show me?"
Sherlock looked down, clasping his hands behind his back. He rubbed his stinging cheek as John scolded him, feeling genuinely chastened (
John rolled his eyes. “You
The tub in 221B, big enough for two, was full of steamy hot water. Sherlock let his dressing gown slide off his shoulders and into his hand. Naked now, he caught it and hung it on a hook before stepping into the sumptuous bath. He shivered as the hot water encased his calves and he groaned as he crouched and sank back into the heavenly water. He sighed, long and deep, and slid forward until everything below his chin was submerged. He closed his eyes and hummed in pleasure.
"Oh, John." Sherlock pulled him close and held him like he was something precious. He slipped his hand up the back of John's neck and cradled his nape. John was actually trembling in his hands. "I will never do anything you don't want me to do." He said, his words strong with conviction.
John was back at the flat before six and Sherlock was speaking to him before he’d even put his bag down.
"It's just a bunch of retired folks but it's like they're feeding an army."
“Jesus,” he growled. “He’s been sending them to you since we’ve been together!”
"Oh!"
jealous." John muttered.
“A couple other ways too.” John said.
John fighting him for control. It was fun this time because had given him the safeword. He could end it with a single word and John would have to relent.
“But John, he
Sue and Mel laughed at their own silly jokes. Sherlock gave John one more peck on the lips. He giggled.
