Castiel looks up with his eyes wide with realisation.
He feels his toned body under the bodysuit, latex against his gloved fingers. Warmth comes seeping through and drenching his entire body as his heart rattles his chest with warm, fuzzy, stupid feelings.
“Be with you momentarily,” a voice comes from behind the backroom, and in a way Dean’s interests peak up. He feels like he knows this voice, but can’t place it; it sounds different? Or is the setting just not right?
”Who are these people?”
”Her deceit is still in the conversation rectangles,” Castiel explained solemnly before Sam pulled the phone towards himself. ”I asked her to tell Dean I love him, and. She said that. Exactly that. I should have said
”And no, he doesn’t mean he’s a device that blows air,” Dean says and winks. ”He’s just admiring.”
”You’re welcome.”
”Well it doesn’t say much else than that. Let me try something else.”
Admittedly, it’s not so much about house rules and friendship boundaries, as it is about Dean’s jammies suddenly starting to feel like they might get too snug if this continues. He’s kind of blushing, or you know, just a little, or totally not, or whatever.
Dean blinks at the picture a little more, stunned. 1951, and he’s just the same. There he is in his latex and his coat, the mask concealing his eyes. Nobody knew just how blue those eyes really were. Dean just had the privilege of seeing them up close.
”Alright, good talk.” Dean pops the slice into his mouth and dries the grease off his mouth before he rolls his balaclava back down over his chin. ”Look. I just wanted to go over our plans. The shitshow we went through last time doesn’t need a repeat, in my professional opinion.”
It’s another few moments until they pull away that time. Slowly, like they don’t want to; they
”Jesus,” he breathes, falling back against the door. ”You can’t do that, Cas. Seriously, this is just out of bounds for me. I mean I gotta give it to ya,
, he realises when he opens his eyes again. The ceiling light really broke.
“This.” Cas flips the easel to face them both, and a startled choke emerges from Dean’s throat. On the canvas is a portrait of Dean, the colours vibrant as though crawling out from the page. His jaw is tilted upwards slightly, lips parted as his eyes glance towards some object in the sky, lashes long and dark and sultry as they cut the page in half. Light and shadows play against the sharp lines of his face, and his figure exudes an almost heavenly, golden glow – his
Dean nods, although he’s not sure if he could say no to anything with the way Cas is looking at him right now, so open and honest and happy. He’ll do anything he can to make him look that way forever, he realizes. “Yeah, it’s fine. Promise. I love it, Cas. I love you.”
, the voice in his head mocks, the niggling one that only seems to go away in the dead of night with Cas’s arms wrapped around him from behind as he drifts off to sleep.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas replies. He doesn’t seem upset, or frustrated, or anything of the sort – in fact, there’s a gentle grin lighting up his face that strikes through Dean like the sweetest of swords. “Are you feeling better?”
“He does those things because he loves
“So you have problems,” Sam repeats.
“What would your heaven be like, Cas?” Dean inquired casually as they lay without disturbance on the angel’s bed. “If you could have one made for you?”
This particular time, the blood happened to be his own, and the t-shirt happened to be his favourite. No way in hell was he throwing it out.
“It’s not a thing, Cas,” Dean dismisses, turning his back and flicking through the newspaper. In his head, he curses himself out for being a clingy child. Cas is his boyfriend, not his father; he doesn’t need to babysit Dean. Although, he muses, the term boyfriend doesn’t exactly encapsulate all that they are – it never has.
Why does Cas want it to mean something so badly?
“It’s your… your only…” Any train of thought Dean once had is long gone as his boyfriend’s breath fans against his ear. Yet for some reason, he can’t bring himself to tear his eyes from his own picture. “Hhh
He barks out a laugh. “I didn’t exactly say it like that, but yeah, Angel, that’s the gist.”
“Always,” Castiel echoed.
Dean stopped, staring down at his angel. The tightness in his chest returned, but this time it was not unpleasant. He’d begun to think that nothing could be unpleasant anymore. No, this time he knew what it was, and he was overcome, for the first time, with the urge to say it. And, for the first time, he thought that maybe he could.
“Shut
“I’m sure you had a nice rest after-”
Dean scoffs. “Stop worrying over everything, Sammy. It’s not a big deal. I refuse to screw
“Yeah, well Cas rubbed
Dean relaxed back into Cas’s arms, which wrapped around him now without hesitation. Thoughts ran wild in his mind as Cas traced patterns on his skin, but for once, none of them were frightened or apprehensive about his relationship with the angel. No, at that moment, all he was thinking about was their future, which was, without a doubt, together. There was no questioning that anymore.
,” he shouts, already in front of Cas’s room, the one he barely ever used before but uses even less since they got together. Dean only ever finds him there when he wants to be alone, so he tries not to interrupt. Still, this is important. Hesitantly, he knocks on the door, sighing in relief when a muffled ‘
Dean was silent. “I’m sorry.”
comfortable in this- in
Shaking his head, Cas manoeuvred himself around Dean, gathering the shirt in his hands. There was a stain, yes — but it diverged from a hole that could certainly not be patched with a sponge. He winced as he fingered the fraying edges, fighting the flashes of memory that bombarded his mind. No matter how many times he had seen it, the image of a knife piercing Dean’s chest would never cease to break Castiel's heart.
When he next looks over at the angel, he finds him fuming quietly. “All this time we’ve spent getting
,” he attempts, reaching a hand over to place on his boyfriend’s leg, hopefully calmingly. “I don’t think I’m ugly or anything.”
“My whole life has been pain, Cas. You’d think by now I wouldn’t feel it.”
“I intend to paint a picture,” Cas says easily. “That’s what the paints and brushes and canvas are generally used for among humans.”
“I thought we’d established that, Dean,” Cas replied, raising his eyebrows. “But I don’t hear either of us complaining.”
The man’s gaze intensified, and he sat up out of the embrace. “You didn’t lose your home, Cas. This is your home, and you will never lose it. And I don’t mean the bunker, I mean our family. You, me, Sam. Understand?”
He connected their lips again, lazily, and allowed gravity to pull them apart just enough that they could speak but lips still touched. “Cas,” Dean said matter-of-factly. “I fucking love you.”
The first question that pops into his head is
“Cas-”
Dean snorted. “If you were human right now, you’d probably be pretty uncomfortable.” After a beat, he realized how that sounded and his cheeks flushed darker than Cas had ever seen them. “Uh, I just meant, you know, because my head is on your arm, and your arm would probably go numb you know, like from the blood and all that-”
Dean looks up at Castiel, whose hands clutch the wallet Dean got him for their one-year anniversary a few weeks ago. Cas shifts his weight awkwardly from one leg to another, something he hasn’t done in years since becoming more comfortable in his body, since they… worked on it together. Dean tenses in concern.
Cas nodded solemnly. “I couldn’t imagine anything else.”
Cas smiled sadly. “I like to think that by the time you go for good, there will be no pain there anymore. That everything will be fixed and peace will be restored.”
Sam is in the kitchen when Dean wanders in the next morning, robe stretched around his t-shirt from the day before and a pair of sweatpants that could be either his or Cas’s, not that he really cares apart from wanting a concrete reason to wipe that smirk off his brother’s face. He positions himself in front of the coffee pot and starts it half-heartedly.
Dean wants to remember, and he does, and so does the mattress.
“No, we…” Dean pinches the tight skin between his brows. “
“Hell no,” Dean breathed, reaching for his angel. “It’s fucking hot.”
“Yes.”
“Not really,” he muttered. “That can’t be comfortable, man. Just…” He reached behind himself, grabbing Cas’s arm and slinging it over his side. Tentatively, Cas brought his other hand up and placed it on his own chest, fingers inches from Dean’s.
“You don’t
“What is it, Dean?” he asked, tensing himself to move away quickly if needed.
“Do you understand now?” the voice rumbles, so close that he can feel it in his gut. “Do you see yourself how I see you? I am an Angel of the Lord – my hands are skilled, my eyes see clearly. This is what you are, Dean. Perfection.”
“When someone is beautiful, they deserve to be told,” Dean replies. “I’ve always thought so, at least.”
Cas’s bright blue eyes widen. “Are you certain?”
“Are we going to the store again?” Dean jokes, wanting to combat the redness in his face with any kind of humour that can lighten the heavy mood. “We know how well that ended last time.”
Even to Cas it felt like an eternity before they pulled apart — Cas, who had lived for millennia — yet it still wasn’t long enough. He thought that maybe he would never have enough time to explore every inch of Dean’s skin, to hear every sound that Dean could make, to know every way he could know Dean. But that didn’t mean that he wouldn’t try, or that a thought like that upset him, because it didn’t. The angel Castiel was nothing without a mission… and this was his new one.
Cas powers through. “When I rebuilt you after raising you from perdition, I was paralyzed by the beauty of your body and soul. You shone through the torment of hell, when I set my hand upon you and gazed upon your tortured face. It was both the best and worst moment of my life, to put it in human terms. And… I was ashamed to admit it for years, which isn’t long to me but somehow felt like a whole new eternity which began the moment I laid eyes on you, I felt… I felt resentment towards my father for creating such a place that could cause you harm, Dean.”
“Yeah,” he whispered, barely audible, into the angel’s chest. “Because I…” He trailed off naturally, a look of realization crossing his face. Profound.
“I… I haven't decided yet.” The muscles in his back tensed, pronounced by his thin t-shirt. Cas turned away, facing the door and said, genuinely, “You’re welcome for the shirt.”
“Good. Because you’d better as hell join me and Sammy in our heavens.”
“To make sure you’re okay,” he replied straightaway.
He hates seeing him like that. So, damage control it is. “Cas, come on, it’s not like
Cas cut him off with a beautiful, boisterous laugh that shook both Dean’s heart and his body, which was ensconced in the angel’s vibrating arms. He joined in, laughing loudly until they both sounded like maniacs and the burning in his face was more from the strain in his cheek muscles than from the heat of embarrassment. They settled after a few vibrant moments back into their soft silence, revelling in a new familiarity.
. It always hurts
Suddenly he’s in Cas’s arms again, and he’s not complaining, not one bit. Breakfast is long forgotten by now – well, maybe not by Sam, but he snuck out a few minutes ago to give them some privacy, and Dean doesn’t want to think about Sam right now.
Dean took a deep breath, as though steeling himself for the words that were about to come out of his mouth. “I think… I think the most important thing in my heaven wouldn’t be the music, or the fights, or anything. I’d want it to be… somewhere you could be happy. Somewhere we could have a home.”
Sam frowns, closing the book he’s got spread open on the table. “Jesus, Dean. What happened?”
Dean clears his throat and shrugs. “Don’t make it a thing.”
“To the store,” the angel replies, staring at Dean’s face intently with furrowed brows. He lifts up the wallet. “I haven’t used this yet.”
Dean clears his throat before setting the newspaper down and uncrossing his legs. “Sure. I mean, we’re low on groceries anyway, and Sam’s always bitching about me not helping out.”
He took another step closer, and finally the two men were close enough to be one. “I never want to hear that you don’t feel the pain,” Cas confessed, placing a hand on his shoulder. “Because even though I would never want you to feel it, I know that there is only one escape, and that is the last thing I would ever want.”
"Dean, I thought I heard, fuck, what are you doing?!" It's too loud. He can tell that right away but what he doesn't understand is why. The next few moments seem to be broken, more like pictures than a continuous fluid state of mind. Sam was always so caring. It made him nosy, always wanting to be aware for everyone's sake. Dean thought that was an excuse for being a gossiper. Whenever anything involved emotion, he would creep his lanky and awkward self only to poke around, pushing buttons that he hoped would reveal anything about his older brother's emotional state. Unfortunately, his brother was under lock and key. Years of packing on layers and mazes marked him as unreadable as he could be, given his ever inconvenient humanity.
Once they got a bunker, this was no longer an issue, but a new one arrived. Dean's room was small, or big, or massive, he didn't really know, but he smiled every time he walked in, giddy as he laid on his bed. The walls a crooked grey that he desperately wanted to paint over, the semblance to a prison cell was far too overwhelming and wished instead to make it home. The massive military-style door was on both ends of the spectrum. On the one hand, it was cool. It added some aesthetic that Dean believed suited him, or wish it did. On the other hand, it made it quiet. Rusted iron, at least a foot thick and eight feet tall, it loomed over him, taunting him with the silence it forced down his throat.
The man had always been there for them, giving them a taste of what could have been a bare and domestic life where they didn't carry the lives of civilians daily. The man who poured his life and soul into keeping them happy, taking to the park and fighting with John when he was too harsh on fucking children. They were just children. He was the one who kept them safe even when the pair were too scared to say it, scared of the walls carrying their secret to their dad, offering his spare rooms to them and refusing to open the door when John came pounding and threatening to break in. Bobby was a father in more ways than he could explain.
"No, I need to go, Sammy, I have to say I'm-, just I have to go," Dean said, getting up so rapidly Sam stayed on the ground in a stupor before getting up and gently taking hold of his brothers elbow. Taking away the jacket he had picked up, happy to see he hadn't gotten to Baby's keys. It would be a massacre and a half trying to take the keys away from them, and he desperately needed to get his hand checked before it got an infection or something of the sort.
The door had been so loud. It had been more audible than before. He was sure of it. It could be a witch. As if what he did wasn't awful enough, it was the sound that made it resonate that let him know that what he did wouldn't be fixed regardless of what he tried.
¨He's fucking gone, Sam!¨ It wasn't unusual for the angel to leave when the younger sibling thought of it. Most of their relationship was Cas appearing and disappearing. He left for months at a time, and that never made much a difference in the bond they all shared, the genuine and mutual care for one another, but as Dean spoke, exclaimed loud and resounding that their friend had left the tone of finality and resentment didn't go unnoticed. It was final, and as everything went off the rails, Sam couldn't help but think that Cas leaving them was only logical. After all, the Winchesters always seemed to lose those they cared about one way or another.
Dean turned facing him with irritation and desperation, moving to push him but failing as the exhaustion and pain of his injury finally began to catch up to him. How long had it been since he had mutilated his hand? Sam had been in his room last Dean checked. It would've taken him a while to notice. Dean couldn't stomach the thought of looking at the pool of blood he no doubt had formed. Making him waver from where he stood.
Samuel was also mourning. Despite having his brother for support, he couldn't say that he hadn't missed having a mother in his life. Envy for those of his peers that had their mothers, caring and gentle, while Sam went back to whatever cheap motel they had decided to stow away for the week. Not needing his mother as much didn't mean he couldn't miss her and that he didn't mourn her painfully so. Dean didn't understand this, would say he had no right when Sam was tired of seeing his brother degrade the last bit of family they had. His intervention was resisted at every turn, and regretfully, the insults became harsher. He wishes it had stayed like that.
"Here," Sam tries his best to make it seem like he wasn't helping Dean, lifting him up awkwardly so that it seemed like Dean was moving on his own, "Come on." The closer they got to the restroom, the slower they got, his brother putting more weight onto Sam until Sam was mostly dragging him to the bathroom. Only a few grunts made him aware of the injured man's disapproval, but otherwise, nothing was done as they transitioned from cement to tile flooring.
The angel blade was missing, one week after Belphegor's betrayal. He thought nothing of it for the first minute, but the more he pondered, the more concerned he became. It couldn't have been a monster or a demon. The bunkers' alarms would've gone off far before they even had the opportunity to find the closet. That didn't stop him from going to the control room and checking the alarm's history, only growing more concerned when he said that nothing had triggered the alarm. They never carried their weapons in the bunker, especially not now when they had nothing to worry about. Sam and Castiel certainly didn't, never felt the need to, and Dean only carried a pistol. They had never broken from that mold.
He hated loud noise.
His face had been so blank, like the first time they met, but worse because this time he was hiding behind it. Castiel was hiding from Dean. He shouldn't have to. All at once, the angel had become unreadable, not a single physical clue to what he was thinking, but Dean knew he had messed up. The most rational part of himself slammed itself into his mind, desperate in its attempts to get him to say so, and still, he ignorantly resisted. Everyone walked away, he used this as an excuse to justify not letting people close to keep himself distant, but now he only allowed himself to understand why. It was because of him. He was rotten, so utterly gone.
He remembered when he had considered it years ago when everything was no longer spontaneous and instead became the same thing over and over when his brother and father both started becoming more and more alike, and he became alienated from his hopes and aspirations. But he had no place to hide. Even on the rare occasions that John would leave him with Bobby, he had no way of excusing wearing sweaters or long sleeves at all times. A more immense fear was his dad figuring out, grabbing him by the arm and hurling insults and punches, only to blame Bobby. It would be his fault then. He would be the reason the only loving connection they had would be severed. It would be selfish, he would be a monster, and the thought deterred him every time.
It was frustrating for both of them. Sam had been provided the opportunity to blossom emotionally, figure himself out, and be in tune with his emotions. He had been saved of the excruciating lectures and beatings, free from the bone-chilling tremors Dean would feel the second he dared to show emotion even years after John's departure. Sam had a brick for a brother. Dean hated it. He was a brother, he needed emotions to be a good one, yet he couldn't seem to tap into them. He was as much a mystery to others as he was to himself.
"This won't take long, just a cleanup and a few stitches, but that should be about it." They were well stocked in medical supplies. Any good hunter would be, considering the number of times the Winchesters seemed to take a hit for one another, it was a necessity. Dean only nodded numbly without so much as looking at his hand. He knew, however, that it was severe. He couldn't remember most of it, or maybe his mind was already hard at work suppressing his memories, but he could remember the sticky feeling as blood covered his hand, the smell that leeched onto them—an undertone in the otherwise sterile bathroom.
. God's punishment to angels who had a child with a human, a very unplanned one, seemed like God couldn't bother making a good one.
He needed to feel bad. He needed to be punished for the pain he inflicted on others, Jo, Amy, Sam, Lisa, and Ben, just to name a few of the people he'd failed and ruined. Some dead, rotting while he selfishly lived his life and wasted it too, some close enough to it dragged into a war that they didn't choose, and untimely succumbed to it, others forced to stick by him. Twisted into the family, Kevin didn't deserve what had happened to him, nor his mother. Kevin had a family. He didn't need them. Dean needed the pain, so he pushed and pulled against his taller counterpart because Dean deserved something far worse than stitches in his hand, but until the day came, or he gained the courage, this was a close substitute.
"...Your hand, I need to find Cas." Concern and the last seven words of whatever ramble Sam had gone off on were the only things he managed to catch, but it was the angel's name that forced another scream out of him. On instinct, his hand went to punch down on the ground. However, his brother had not let go, and in his weakness, he yelled louder, thrashing and pulling until his brother forced his hands to his chest. He needed to do this. He needed to.
That didn't mean anything changed after that. Castiel continued his abuse, refusing to heal himself from even a paper cut, his penance, or so he called it. Sam saw it for what it was, unhealthy, but selfishly he did nothing. Did nothing even when Dean's insults escalated to a level he thought his brother was incapable of, and even then, he selfishly stayed quiet because if Castiel didn't say anything, why would he. Because they were both adults who should know how to resolve their issues healthily and calmly without resorting to harmful and awful low blows. Without spitting and oozing poison every time, they found it fit to speak.
Cas had left, Castiel to Dean now. Dean didn't deserve to call the angel anything after what he had done, and the guilt, the thick, disgusting guilt that he kept trying to swallow down, echoing through his mind so unbearable loud that he failed to notice his fingers had long stopped moving. Instead, a chill had overtaken him, so cold, so isolated, and rapidly he lounged forward. The chair next to him knocked over as he rushed for the whiskey bottle they kept atop the countertop to the northern wall. At the time, it seemed like the ideal place for it, an homage to their earlier and far more unfortunate days. In the entire bunker, that wall was the most unkept. The bricks, once laid with determination for perfection and uniformity, now cracked and crumbling.
The first glass breaks, he blames it on the glass, the second is more resilient, and he's able to serve himself, the platter unnaturally cold against his skin, and the possibility of having a fever enters his mind. He pushes it aside before downing his drink in a single gulp, and finally, he can breathe, the guilt dissolved with the burn of his alcohol. He allowed himself to close his eyes, the darkness behind his eyelids a reward he didn't deserve, and so he smashed his hand right into the glass shards from a mere few seconds ago. A spontaneous action became repetitive, and in it, he found solace as he tattered his right hand. His left side supported by the counter, the intricate metalwork handles poking into his body.
Bitter over the consistent motel rooms, old and disgusting, that they stayed in sometimes for months when a case just wouldn't let up. Filled with resentment over years of unpacking and packing up just as quick as they moved from city to city and state to state. Despite knowing that it was dangerous, regardless of knowing he wasn't fit to raise them, Frustrated because their father had paraded them around instead of letting them stay with Bobby. Bobby, who had loved them like sons and wanted nothing but the best for the two boys instead, was forced to sit down and see how John ran them into the ground until eventually, they were nothing but strangers with the label; of family smacked crooked on top of them. Dean had needed Bobby and was deprived of it. Dean had needed Mary, and now she too was gone.
anything to him.
Cas approached, resolving to put personal space aside and calm down his friend. “Dean, stop.”
He doesn’t expect to see Cas sitting in front of an easel when he enters. He can’t see the canvas, which he’s not particularly upset about because it means Cas’s face is in clear view in all of its focused glory. And, well, the little strip of green paint across his cheek. Which is absolutely
A horn sounds, and Dean takes a moment after flipping off the driver to collect himself. Driving is sacred, and even Cas’s exquisite…
“Hey there, Angel,” the man greets, closing the door behind him but not stepping any further inside.
A jolt of warmth spreads through him, accompanied by the woosh of flapping wings, and Cas spends the rest of the day showing instead of telling. For the second time that morning, Dean is wrapped in Cas’s bedsheets, and his chest rises and falls quickly with his heavy breaths. The angel traces lazy circles on Dean’s upper arms, and the hunter sighs in complete and utter contentment – no, happiness. He shifts so his head rests on Cas’s chest, the soft patter of hair there tickling his ears, and has only one coherent thought running through his brain.
“Dean,” he whispered, hands hovering so as not to obtrude on the man’s space (despite the fact that, yes, he was half on top of him). “Dean, are you awake?”
Dean’s eyes flickered in the darkness. “Well, all the more reason for you to stay in mine. I think it would definitely have all those things you described. Especially hamburgers.”
’ returns.
Cas shook his head, incredulous. “Dean, you hate gentle music, and bees, and having nothing to fight. You would go crazy. That’s not how your heaven should be.”
The angel opens his mouth for a second before slamming it shut. “Fine.”
“Oh,” Dean whispered, breaking the quiet. Cas nodded, a lightness around him as he let himself start to forget the painful memory. Instead of putting the shirt back on, Dean gently touched his chest, as though feeling for the phantom wound. “It still hurts,” he breathed, vulnerability in his words. “Even now, after all this time.”
now, not your vessel,” Dean corrects almost instinctively. They’ve had this conversation many times, and Cas seems to understand it now as he nods, unprovocative. “Secondly, can you blame me, man? You’re devastatingly handsome.”
“You must have been told many times,” Cas says.
“Can we just drop this, Cas?” Dean grumbles through clenched teeth. His fingers curl around the wheel, grasping it tightly. Discomfort digs underneath his skin like a burrowing mole.
“The paint is still wet,” Cas whispers in his ear, low and growling. “I can’t have you ruin this painting. It’s my favourite.”
“I was a soldier of heaven,” he explains. “I could not understand what I was feeling. I did not understand, in fact, until I learned myself what it was to be human after the fall. But I always felt it, from the first second.”
“Your ability to not stare at my vessel when you think I’m distracted is not improving.”
“That’s what love is, stupid.” Sam leans back in his chair, smiling softly. “You would do the exact same thing for him. Now, if you two get your heads out of your asses and actually talk to each other, maybe no one has to get hurt.”
“Nothing happened,” he says, rolling his eyes. “I just need to be at least tipsy for the conversation Cas and I are about to have.”
“I do not understand why making sexual innuendos about your brother amuses you, Sam,” Cas’s voice interrogates from the doorway. Dean doesn’t look up from his coffee, but his smile triples when the angel comes up behind him and wraps his arm around his waist again. “Good morning, Dean.”
“Yes, that is the ideal location.” Dean spins around to find Cas and Sam lifting something up into the air. They centre it carefully before peeling off the white sheet that covers it, and Dean flushes a deep scarlet. His portrait is displayed on the mantle besides the few photos they’ve had developed and framed over the years: the brothers at Sam’s high school graduation, the three of them spending Christmas together, a candid shot of Dean and Cas in a sweet kiss that Sam must have taken secretly.
“I’ve lost track of how many times you have almost died on my watch, Dean,” cracked their angel roommate in his trademark gravelly tenor. The humorous lilt of his voice was strained, poorly concealing remnants of panic and exhaustion.
“Nothing, really, it’s just…” Dean hesitated, the blush on his cheeks growing darker. “You don’t have to hold your hands in the air like that.” He motioned to Cas’s arms, which hovered as he didn’t know where to put them with a chestful of Dean Winchester.
Together.
The air catches in Dean’s throat, and for a moment he forgets how to breathe. No has ever said anything like what just came out of Cas’s mouth to him before. He expected Cas to scold him for his self-deprecating thoughts in the way Sam would, a slap on the wrist, to be told he was handsome, even, but not a declaration so intense it shattered every logical thought in his mind. “Wh-wh…”
“I didn’t agree to this,” Dean exclaims, cheeks burning ferociously. “Cas, babe, why…”
The man in question groaned quietly, the vibration into his shirt making Cas chuckle. The angel called his name again, and Dean opened his eyes with much effort. “Whadda ya want, Cas?”
Cas grinned against his lips. “I fucking love you, too, Dean.”
So, he was wrong about the last part. That much he’s man enough to admit – or some other descriptor that means the same thing but doesn’t promote internalized misogyny in society’s everyday language, as Charlie would say to him if she was here. Maybe Cas would, too, if he still used his angel mojo to read Dean’s thoughts – although he would say fancier words like ‘perpetuate’ or ‘vernacular,’ just to show off his angel mouth. Dean can think of other ways for him to show off his angel mouth that are more fun.
“Y’know Bobby really rubbed off on you,” Dean grumbles as he heads towards the rooms, rolling his eyes.
“I merely referred to a
upset me,” Cas confirms, picking his brush back up and dragging it neatly along the canvas. His eyes set in a concentrated stare, brows furrowing just a smidge, and from what Dean can see, the movement of his hands is smooth, precise, masterful. Unsurprising.
Castiel blinks at the term of endearment. He always does, but never says anything, so Dean doesn’t stop saying it. “I’m going to go, now.”
“Would you like to come with me to the store?” Cas asks instead, plainly like it is the simplest decision in the world, which it kind of is, when he really thinks about it.
“Hm?” Dean replied incoherently, struggling to compose himself enough to have even a short conversation.
Castiel handed him the shirt without looking him in the eyes. A silent refuse to acknowledge Dean’s anger lingered in the air between them, and Cas pretended not to see the tightness with which Dean held the shirt in his fists. Little sounds expanded to fill the room — the drip of the tap, the distant whirr of the bunker’s power system, the rush of the pipes overhead.
. The angel is already a Winchester, through and through, but Dean can’t help but wonder…
“Huh? You just said-”
Dean pulls into the bunker garage and kills the engine, but Cas is gone before Baby even stops purring. He doesn’t use his mojo, instead electing for the human storm-out of kicking the door open and taking long strides inside before Dean can even see his face. The man sighs and rests his forehead on the steering wheel for a moment, basking in the comfort the car gives him. Eventually he musters up enough energy to follow his boyfriend inside.
Dean’s eyes hardened. “Because I’m human.”
For an angel, Cas’s lips were certainly chapped despite being soft against his. He made a mental note to bring Cas to the grocery store with him so he could pick out a flavour of chapstick he liked, but the note was tossed into some distant corner of his mind as Cas pulled him on top of him, arms wrapped so tightly around his waist that Dean felt like he was melting into the angel’s body. Dean’s lips parted in a groan as Cas’s palms explored his bare back roughly, grasping and smoothening and massaging. He decided that if this was the only fighting he got to do in heaven, he’d have no complaints whatsoever. As long as Cas was with him. As long as they were together.
And Dean believed him. His eyes widened as a startled laugh escaped his lips. “Oh, shit. I corrupted an angel.”
? He knows it shouldn’t be, that he should trust that Cas will always come back to him, especially after all the times the angel has said so quite blatantly to his face, but Dean Winchester has been burned too many times to let his heartbeat stay constant whenever someone he loves walks out the front door for whatever reason. But Cas doesn’t have to know that – fostering trust and all that bullshit – so instead, he asks, “Where are you going?”
“There is always pain.” He sighed. “There always will be.”
“I see you got your head out of your ass,” Sam comments, sipping at what looks like a green smoothie but could just be juiced lettuce, knowing him.
Dean tore himself from the room, abandoning the fixed t-shirt on the cold, tiled floor. Searching the bedroom wing, he opened his door first, then the other one… but Cas wasn’t in the room next to Dean’s, the one he had put his few possessions in but still refused to call his own. Cursing under his breath, Dean slammed the door shut behind him and sat on Castiel’s bed, putting his hands together under his chin.
How is he ever going to walk past the library again without being reminded of Castiel’s… unholier methods of telling Dean he is beautiful?
“Yeah?” he replies, mentally crossing his fingers that Cas won’t try to squeeze a chick-flick moment out of him right now.
They stayed like that for a minute more, or two, three. Cas would have been happy like that forever, but he sensed a hesitancy in Dean, and he was another sign away from setting him down on the other side of the bed and just watching over him as he slept. He would have been content either way, really. He just wanted Dean to be happy, peaceful. Not only safe, but also feeling safe, because those were two very different things.
The hunter rolls his eyes but refuses to admit that he hasn’t been paying attention. “Ha. Your sarcasm is improving, babe.”
Sam holds his hands up in surrender. “Hey, I just like seeing you two happy. Nothing else.”
“No, it’s fine,” Dean decides, taking a deep breath.
“And you’ll be the one to fix it?”
Cas tilts his head curiously. “We’re not going to the grocery store.”
“He does those things because he loves us.”
His smile morphed into a serious expression, eyes heavy and focused on the man in front of him. “I will do everything to make sure that your heaven is ready for you, Dean Winchester.”
“How could you
“I’m sorry.”
“You do,” Cas breathed, intending it as a question but shifting somewhere into acceptance, understanding, complete and utter… everything. There were some things that were hard for Castiel to understand, but this was not one. He felt this in his soul that didn’t exist, in his grace, in whatever part of him had touched Dean and whatever part of Dean had touched him. Profound. “I do, too.”
, or how Cas had once described it to look, but never has he seen it so clearly before him. Is this how Castiel sees him? This man… This wonderful, beautiful, worthy man?
How stupid he was to be afraid that the angel wouldn’t come back.
When his lips met Cas’s, neither with the knowledge of who moved first, the movement had been completed, and all they were left with was the utter perfection it created. And that wasn’t just enough… it was everything.
Dean opened his mouth as if to say something, but held back. Cas just couldn’t have that.
“Morning, Angel,” he murmurs, turning his head to press their lips together. He almost forgets Sam is sitting there, smug, until he turns back and sees it with his own eyes. Dean flips him off. “Find a new hobby, bitch.”
“It’s only been a few hours,” Castiel replied pragmatically. “Even with Angel mojo, it could conceivably still be painful, even if only in the mind.”
“I’m going out.”
have been thinking so lowly of yourself?”
?” Dean is momentarily shocked by the vigour in Castiel’s tone, the merciless disbelief that permeates every molecule of air between them suddenly and ferociously. Cas’s shoulders are tense, and his throat seems constricted from where Dean sits.
“No, Cas, I won’t fucking stop,” he bellowed, stepping close enough that the breath that had just been inside his lungs now brushed against Castiel’s skin. He froze, breath laboured, before jerking away and staring at the ruined cloth, fists clenching. “Damn shirt.”
“Oh,” Cas replied intelligently. He set them down on the mattress on either side of Dean. It felt quite awkward, even for him. “Is that better?”
“Are you comfortable like this, Dean?” Cas asked boldly, although his voice was more full of adoration than any kind of boldness.
“You seemed upset in the car,” Dean explains. “I thought maybe you were angry with me for saying those things about myself. I didn’t mean to upset you, really – it was stupid, anyway. I shouldn’t have burdened you with all my crap.”
up, which is why I’m going to go talk to my boyfriend instead of ignoring our problems.”
“Don’t be.” The angel sets his brush down again with a finality that tells Dean he’s done with whatever he’s making. Curiosity pokes at his brain, but he shoves it back. This is an important conversation that he can’t put off any longer.
Cas fills up the cart in a matter of minutes, his familiar child-like excitement catching like the embers of birthday candles. Dean doesn’t pay much attention to the things he grabs off the shelves – he does, however, watch the way Cas’s fingers trail over the objects, the way his eyes narrow as he scrutinizes something before deciding to take it or leave it behind. Idly, the thought appears in his mind that Castiel has never once looked at him that way. He always choses Dean Winchester without a second thought.
“There’s nothing sudden about that,” Sam states, blinking incredulously at his brother’s confused expression. “Are you serious, Dean? Everything Cas has ever done has been for you. Why the fuck would you even consider that your problems aren’t also his?”
“Feel more connected to my worldly possessions, yes. You explained when you gave it to me.”
going to be fun for him – he knows his boyfriend well enough to realize this fact. Still, he stands, grabs the man’s rough hand and tugs him towards the car, biting his lip to keep from smiling.
Sam is sitting in the library when Dean finally makes it inside, and he looks up at the sound of Dean’s heavy footsteps. “Damn,” his brother remarks immediately. “What did you do to Cas? Poor guy looked like he was about to cry.”
“Hmm?” the angel replies distractedly. The sound is deep and reverberates deep in Dean’s body the way it usually does, and he feels his shoulders inexplicably relax, even when he wasn’t aware there had been any tension in them in the first place.
It took the angel a moment to answer, pondering the question as though he’d never even considered the idea of him having his own heaven, which he probably hadn’t. “I think… I’d like it to be peaceful. Not like the heaven I have known for millennia. Perhaps a long stretch of grass with gentle music, the warm sun on my human skin, nothing to fight, nothing to protect you from. Oh, and bees. And hamburgers.” He stopped. “That’s all I can think of. It seems I hadn’t enjoyed much of the human variety while I had the chance. But it’s all in vain, anyway. I will never have my own heaven.”
The man turned sharply, hurling the sponge at the splotchy wall. It struck, producing an oddly harsh sound for something as soft as itself — a testament to the man’s frustration. A snarl escaped his lips.
After a moment of unanswered silence, he sighed, exhausted. Every part of his body was heavy, his muscles were worn, and his heart was overworked. And he really didn’t mean to, honest, but the soft, white linen of his pillow looked so inviting, like the feathers of a bird, and his head was lolling already, and he could only be so strong for so long…

Cas blinks. ”You meant to say

, the sensation washing over him. Then Cas grabs his tie and pulls him closer; the strain around Dean's throat might just be what does it. ”Come for me." Or maybe it's what he says next. "That’s my good boy.”
”Oh, and he’s so feisty! Never a dull moment.”
”I find it preferable,” Thunderbird replies, studying some very sexy trash on the floor.
He looks so sad it makes Dean’s chest ache. ”Don’t beat yourself down like that, man,” he says weakly.
Fuck, fuck, fucking fuck.
The victimized man in the room starts making strained noises behind Dean, reminding him with a start of his presence. They sound inhuman, whimpering, gurgling. He puts his knives away and runs up just as the man falls to his knees.
”I was curious about how we should proceed with the case.”
Castiel, in turn, looks haunted, though Dean does not know what of. Or what for. ”I don’t remember,” he says quietly. It’s the most honest reply. ”I must have died a long, long time ago.”
”Sure, Stanford boy. No but yeah, really. But now

Still.
Being sour and annoyed was usually how things were exchanged between them, since that day when Sam apparently thought he was being incredibly funny and set them up. Not like they did it
”We can steal babies too,” Castiel assured a speechless Dean, who started to look physically injured in the chest. ”I hope you accept my pebble.”
”Wow,” Sam declared unhelpfully. He shook his long locks and put the phone down. ”I miss simpler times when he just texted you pictures from his recipe book.”

might not provide much for that, though. It’s not really his type of movie.
That was all on Dean. Being buddies. Sharing body heat, because it was kind of cold in the bunker, being underground and all that jazz, and sometimes Cas blew out all the light bulbs in the room when Dean took his hand or kissed his collarbone as a goodnight. Dean kind of had a lot of feelings that maybe sometimes outweighed the self-hatred, is all. Things he’d never felt, or just, never had

again feeling Castiel all around himself, his scent and warmth, spent and panting.
That smile  matches the happiness Dean feels within, a spark. A glimmer of something that unmistakably feels like hope.
Cas shrugs. ”Would you like that?”
Demanding to Dean that they take her out of her glass prison, he had laughed, in a hearty sort of way he does, and Castiel understood he didn’t see the severity of the situation when he instead suggested he could change her to a man, or that she could be in any language that he wanted. Castiel didn’t understand why she should go out of her way like that for him, until Dean explained, pedagogically, it was just a robot. He called it artificial intelligence. Then he showed Castiel he could ask Siri anything, and she would give the answer.
”And you only finished that

”Well, my question still stands,” Cas replies and, fuck. Just, wow. ”Let loose, Dean. For

without looking up from his golden little children sizzling in the pan. It’s all normal procedure when he hears Cas’ sauntering steps over the floor.
Dean still presses the 1 repeatedly before he surrenders.
But he stabbed him.
However:
Castiel’ lips have parted to emit small, ragged breaths when he takes himself out of the front of his own, neatly straightened dress pants, and Dean has to press his own lips together to repress any noise.
”Oh,” comes Castiel’s breathy voice in return, pupils blown wide, lips wet and raw. He slides his hand along his length, slick with precum, and Dean is honestly losing his mind right here.
”Your boyfriend,” Sam confirms, and Dean can tell by his voice he’s grinning, so he resists slapping the back of his head. ”I mean jeez. You like ’em old, huh?”
”Oh,” Cas acknowledges.

”Badabing badaboom,” Dean pipes in, ”it’s an empty goddamn room.”
Precum is all he needs as he tugs on his painfully hard dick and Dean grabs desperately for him, tugging on just the sleeves of his shirt as Cas holds him back against the wall and jerks him off.
to inherit the fortune they gathered. Taa-daa.”
for crying out loud. Dean is just a daytime mechanic who likes to cut up some bad guys in his spare time. He doesn’t mess with übermensch powers. He’ll leave that to the particularly shitty villains, and he’s been dealt a few. (He doesn’t have the name Demonblade without reason. It’s a story for another time. Or not.)
Suddenly there’s a searing pain up his leg, smoke making his eyes tear up as he’s thrown across the floor, and Thunderbird is roaring his name from somewhere behind the ringing in his ears. It feels like he only
well he studied whatever he’d been watching at the time.
And now he’s speaking with the angel, who definitely is an angel and angels aren’t real but here the angel is and he’s a motherfucking
Cas interrupts. ”I’ll see what I can do,” he says, accepting the mission with full seriousness.
Dean keeps his eyes locked at him, feeling like they might just be portraying sadness, or dread. The wind whips at him and maybe it’s the reason he feels like they might just betray him and start tearing up.
Castiel - very contently - tucks him back in his jeans and does his zip up. ”There. Now I’m finished.”
They high-five, Cas nearly missing and Sam nearly dropping his stack of plates.
”Then who’s the
”Maybe I’d like to retract the earlier command,” he breathes abruptly, feeling his cock ache alongside Castiel’s. He feels dazed, so horny it’s as if the bed is just,
In the quiet of the night, the bulb in the lamp post next to Dean suddenly shatters and falls in a glitter around him when the other black-clad vigilante appears, seemingly out of nowhere.
Cas hums, amused. ”Bi people get enough hardships. Erasure, for one.”
”A little birdie called the World Wide Web told me so.”
”Arrived at destination?” Dean murmurs, studying the building from the secluded spot. ”Alright, looks like they could be armed to the teeth, so this should be fun.”
”Well forgive me Father for I have sinned,” Dean breathes bashfully.
Castiel tilts his head like it’s a shrug. His eyes flick up to meet Dean’s again. ”They had very nice cowboy outfits, until they undressed each other and discarded them.” He slides his fingers across the brim of the hat, mimicking what he must have seen the pornstar do. ”I made the decision to bring my own.”

he’d have definitely made different choices, ones that Dean might have appreciated more in an awake-state. “You’re asleep, Dean,” he informs him, quietly as not to wake him. There’s no protocol for this. There’s no clear yes or no answers. “What do you want to do?”
instead.” When Dean’s eyes widened very alarmingly, Castiel shook his head. ”I’ll fix it. Later. But, I think it looks much better this way.”
”Nah, he knew nothing, or so he says. Told the cops he woke up in that building and this guy was just there. What was it, Vampira? Valkyr? Uh, whatever.”
At least he can hide it in humour and a tough exterior.
Warmth floods Dean’s entire body. ”Oh?” He blinks rapidly and his knees wobble, but he’d never admit that out loud. ”Is that so?”
Okay, yeah, that cowboy hat is kind of making his pulse quicken, more than the anger over the
”Hello, Castiel,” Siri answered cheerfully. Dean must have previously informed Siri of his identity, so it didn’t strike him as uncommon. She didn’t sound like she had any ill intent at least and had never shown herself to be hostile towards Cas, so he calmly continued.
“What do you want me to do?” Castiel asks him, voice vibrating against his skin. “There were so many options at this point. All so enthralling. I just couldn’t choose the best plan of action.”
Thunderbird scowls, a last check of his intentions, and Dean’s eyes flicker to his lips. To the hinge of his jaw, the scruffy stubble, back to his icy blue eyes. That stare is so intense, so intent, it almost makes heat rise in his cheeks.
Dean grabs a piece, despite it all; would be a shame to ignore it now. He just witnessed a goddamn miracle. It’s a good distraction, either way.
So that means there’s a pattern, the next of kin to men in Valkyr’s circle way back in the day being hunted and killed. So now it’s just a matter of tracing it. Predicting the next blow.
He leans his own hands against his heaving chest, starts grinding and rocking his hips, riding Cas to a point of bliss. The pleasure all-consuming, in his hands, but given to him by Cas.

a little.”
, studying Thunderbird as he tries to converse with an unknowing reporter. That is, until a photographer shoves them together so suddenly their shoulders bump. He takes their photo as suddenly as he appeared.
Dean swallows down and Cas blurts out incoherent blasphemies. Dean never even heard him curse before, might it be because they’re always in a work environment… but he takes that as a win.
”Car fetish,” he sing-songs quietly as he rolls his eyes.
”I didn’t do anything, I told you.” He put his phone onto the table with the same distaste he deeply felt towards it. ”I put my trust in her and she didn’t comply with my pleas. She’s a very evil genie.” He squinted, pondering. ”Maybe I outdid my wishes. Do you know if there is a limit?”
And here he is, alive and well. Not much different in the yellowed, black and white photograph than he was when Dean saw him right in front of himself.
but I certainly don’t think of Siri in these ways. She could have misinterpreted.”
As soon as he’s out of ear shot, Sam Wesson snorts. ”Will he ever stop riding your ass?” he questions out loud.
But a lot of hunters get married, a little devil on his shoulder whispers into his consciousness all of a sudden. Life like this, you never know if you’ll see the next sunrise; last night on earth and crap like that. Dean already kicked the bucket enough times to know that, got his ass offed thrice or, what comes after that? Frice? A good hundred times if Sam’s memory serves him right? Gist of it is, you take your shot at that point, and you

Maybe it could have been cool, maybe he could have been worthy of a badass entrance playing
Even Sam looks hesitant at that point. Which is like, alright, it has indeed been established several times (after several hand-shaped flour marks slapped onto Cas’ ass) that Dean is both the master chef and star baker of this household. It’s definitely not Cas’ forte, nor one of his celestial superpowers.
Because as far as Dean knows, anyone who he’s ever let in (apart from Sammy, although he’s not sure he ever had to make an actual conscious decision whether or not to do so, since he knew the little shit since Dean was four and baby Sam came into the world hollering like a banshee and Dean decided he loved him to pieces), just ends up stabbing him in the back.
Dean worries his lip with his teeth.
A small gang of maintenance guys meet them, one of them looking at them with a stern face. ”You guys okay?”
Cas flicks his eyes up at him. “There’s also the aloe vera,” he says. “It has sublime
”With Brad Pitt?”
Castiel struggles to take his eyes away. He hums. “Goodnight, Dean. Sleep tight.”
With a skeptical look - and ready to start swinging if this is some sort of sicko prank, if Sam is hiding behind the closet door or some shit, because that would not be

”Fucking hell,” Dean moans, coming out sounding absolutely
”Huh?” Dean throws his arms out, pronouncing each word educationally slow. ”When - are - we -
Cas squints, like Clint Eastwood, but more mischevious. ”Are you flirting with me, Dean Winchester?”
Yeah, well. Baby steps, and all that.
They continue bickering for a while. It ends, as it usually ends, with a well-aimed kick under their small table and another one in return. Okay, so, maybe they got stuck at maturing two decades ago or so, but it still makes them both laugh, and Cas smiles like they’re not just complete idiots. Or, like they’re at least
”I’m clean,” Cas points out. His voice is still so casual, if just a smitch darker. It rumbles down Dean’s spine like a shiver. ”And you have nice hands, too.”
”Uh, yeah, no,” Dean shakes his head, mouth turned down. ”Just said that. Dunno why. Kinda weird.”
”About last time.” Dean clears his throat, trying not to start blushing. He thumbs across the collar, furrows his brow. ”I uh, never got to thank you for that, did I? You saved my ass, hauling me out like that.”
aftermath
Random final side note + self-indulgent recommendation: I tried very hard to not make a reference to Watchmen throughout this because the actor who plays John Winchester is literally The Comedian which is like PERFECT but I’d have gone crazy mixing those universes. THEN I started watching The Boys which was also written by Kripke and I tried so hard to resist Dean from calling Cas by Starlight because Jensen is gonna be on the show!! lol wow but I recommend both this movie and this show if you’re into these things. Byee ♡

The crease in his angel’s forehead deepens. “You
It is the silence, he decides, that is making it so hard to concentrate on the road. Sure, he could turn on the radio, give Baby a little moment of self-expression (because he likes to think she communicates through Zeppelin and Van Halen), but Dean is a simple man who hasn’t heard his boyfriend’s raspy, stomach-tingling voice in almost ten minutes and is suffering from withdrawal symptoms. So instead, he says, “Cas?” in that little inquisitive tone that he tries not to think about too much for fear of what it will reveal and revels in the response he gets.
Cas startles, like the thought had never even crossed his mind. “Worried about me? Why?”
Sam chortles. “Just in time, too, to make room for Cas’s-”
And yes, something inside of Dean snapped into place when Cas whispered those precious words. So he closed his eyes, face still buried into Cas’s shirt, and just… let it happen. Let things change. Let the world — no, their world, the one that they created — take control and make everything right.
off on-”
Dean squeezes his eyes shut and groans. Whatever is about to happen is
“Do you ever want that?” Dean murmured hesitantly. “You know, to be human again?”
The breath stopped in Cas’s lungs and he lay back, stricken. Yes, he knew it. He just didn’t know that he needed to hear it from Dean until now. “I do.”
Understanding seeped into Dean’s sleepy eyes, and a gentle blush spread across his cheeks. He tensed slightly, but didn’t move. “Uh, yeah, man. I’m good. Are you?”
“It’s not-”
Dean almost chokes on nothing. “Jesus, Cas, way to be blunt.”
to use it,” Dean says. “I got it for you so you would-”
“You’ve said that before,” Cas muses critically, but to Dean’s utter and unmistakeable joy, a faint red blush spreads across the angel’s cheeks. It’s not just that his words are able to have that effect on his boyfriend, but that Cas feels connected enough to his physical form to receive such a compliment and have it mean something other than that he is at the moment occupying an attractive shell. All the work they’ve done together must be working.
don’t have problems.
fun. There’s no other way to describe the feeling of watching Castiel promenade through the craft store across from the bakery (where Dean had, inevitably, stopped for a box), his beige trench coat practically floating behind him as he flies down the aisles. For a moment, Dean is struck with the memory, many years back, of when he first told Cas how much fun it is to be around him – the night they both thought he would die, and the only thing that would remove that suffocating, heart-stopping discomfort in his chest was walking side-by-side with Castiel into whatever they were facing, just like they always do.
“Yeah, yeah, whatever.” Flicking on the radio, Dean busies himself then with preparing breakfast, digging the carton of eggs out of the fridge and propping up some onions on a cutting board. He’s so engrossed in his work that he doesn’t even notice when the other two men sneak out of the kitchen – he only realizes once the table is set with food that no one is there to eat it.
“Listen here you winged bastard, you don’t get to do this anymore. Okay? You don't get to run away from me — from us, from home anymore. I swear if you do I’ll unleash my inner soccer mom and file a fucking missing persons report, and I think we all know how that would end.” He ran a hand over his face, rubbing his jaw to release some tension. His voice broke, quiet and muffled as it struggled past his throat. “Fuck, Cas. Just, please…”
The rest of the drive home is silent like the first half, only this time because neither has anything to say to the other. Well, nothing they are willing to say at the very least. Dean watches the road easier this time, knowing that if he looks at Castiel, there are only two possible outcomes: the first being that he would see something there that would force his gaze away so strongly and immediately that it would be rendered useless, and the second that he would never look away. Neither is particularly appealing, the latter if only for the reasoning that he might crash his cherished car.
Hence the sponge.
“Yes, I agree,” Cas says. He gestures to the bed across from his little set-up, and Dean takes a seat on the edge of it, the way he would at a crime scene. Castiel shifts in his chair so he is facing him more directly. “Dean Winchester, you are the most glorious creature I have ever set my gaze upon in my millennia of existence, and it pains me endlessly that you do not see so.”
They'd done it for so long, for each other because they had issues, a statement so obvious, but it had taken them years to admit it and even know Dean only admitted it when he was drunk or crying. They were far too attached for their own good that in the rare chance they got with someone they turned them away for one another. In the sparse times, they had reached a slice of the vanilla and ignorant life they had turned away for one another, they were family, and that was the only thing that made their pathetically miserable life all the bit more tolerable. It had also set them up to fail with others. The list went on and on. They were dependent on one another, but that didn't branch out to others. They could come and go as they pleased, and they did, much more to Dean's amazement.
The first time he noticed it was a week after everything had gone down, it felt much longer than a week, but he hated himself for not seeing it earlier. The broom closet was useless. It shocked them when they found it, a global supernatural fighting force in need of a broom closet was hilarious beyond belief. It was too small to be a room and far too big for them to fill it up and make it wall again, so it stayed as the useless broom closet they would pass by and laugh at. Eventually, they started tossing their clothes after a case, a toxic bacterial manifestation, when they finally realized they needed to wash them. It wasn't long until they began to storing their weapons there, too, the demon blade, angel blade, and a few of their preferred guns.
Winchesters, being a liar, was just a byproduct of the name, as well as a life of never-ending misery and pain, as almost every acquaintance that had the misfortune of crossing paths with them would agree. They became blatantly aware of this as they drove away from their burning home all those years ago, ingrained just as real as their anti-possession tattoos. Sam never wanted to be a liar, he had tried so hard to get away from the life, and in the end, he couldn't safely say if it was the right choice, not then and not now. Seeing his brother still locked into whatever state he was in, he felt inclined to say this wasn't right, lying wasn't straight, lying to themselves saying that they were content with their life wasn't right.
The tapping of his calloused fingers, forged and perfected in their rough design, against the smooth and polished exterior of the wooden table was the only thing keeping him sane. It was a constant, from booking motel rooms on busy streets to always playing music even if on the lowest setting, the methodical and innovative melody of the musicians calming him, lulling him into the peace he was deprived of. The peace he'd learned to associate with sound, careful and brilliantly composed, or sporadic and randomly serene. Regardless he let himself be enveloped in whatever white noise the world provided him.
Sam glanced his way several times, Dean pointedly ignored him. By now, his little brother no doubt had noticed he was soberer, more aware, and slipping into his denial. The information did nothing but stress him out more. Either he would shut down, be a petulant man-baby and not say anything, or he would get angry, rapid and unstoppable, storm away, and do everything himself while yelling about what he did to Cas and adding a few insults along the way for good measure. Neither of these was reassuring, but he only said a silent prayer to no one in particular as he took the tray and set it next to the sink.
He stammered out of the room, his hands gripping onto the old brick that formed the archway, leaving its imprint after only seconds of contact. His hands and face dripping with sweat as he quietly crept into his brother, knowing that he was showering, in frantic urgency, he dug through every drawer and cabinet, searched through every article of clothing both relieved and panicked at the loss of the blade. Only then did he quietly start organizing everything, not that his brother would really notice. The thought, awful and chilling, hit him. It wasn't a new concept to him, but he couldn't help how his eyes burned, blurring his vision as he cried onto his hands and whatever clothing got in its way.
They were both in grief, and one would assume that they would be lost in their own worlds, mourning those who they had loved so much that in there, leave they left them broken. Trapped in the memories of those they had lost, for Castiel, it had rung true, but Dean, ever ignorant to his emotions, chose to find a scapegoat.
Dean remained silent, staring intently at the individual tiles that made up the bathroom floor, afraid to look up and meet his brother's eyesight. He had been weak and pathetic. There was no excuse for that. The atmosphere here was so different that it had assaulted his senses, the coldness of the toilet where the green-eyed man sat and the smell of Windex and bleach sobering him up further. Realization was an awful emotion, he decided. To sit there like a child waiting for their mother to return and whisper comforts into their ear as they solved all their issues with a bandaid wasn't the Winchester way.
He hooks a leg around Castiel and their bodies brush harshly together, erections throbbing and hard beneath the gear. “Fuck, we have to get this off,” Dean grumbles, feeling out of breath already.
When the power went off, the air conditioning did too. And an elevator is not a nice place to be with no fans and one single light beating down on them both, sharing the same air for nearly an hour.
. :~)
Dean blushes hot immediately, eyes large and pleading. ”Don’t even go there, man,” he breathes. ”It’s not good for my heart.”
”I can tell him my love for him is like honey. It can be kept for thousands of years if stored correctly.”
Secondly, though, who dares mess with his porn preferences just like that? A
”Sub?” He furrows his brow in confusion. It’s like he’s being quizzed. ”Well.
Sam and Castiel eventually start to discuss the flavour of the cake and what could have been done differently. They agree on its insufficient nutritional value; Cas’ words. Dean just happily listens at that point, cradling a cup of coffee from the brewer they invested in, watching them go back and forth like a ping pong game. At least they don’t argue, or at least not too badly. They’re a chaotic duo if Dean ever saw one but at least they keep a good tone, at least by his standards.
”Oh. Then I’m not wrong.”
In conclusion, it’s a damn good life when you don’t feel constantly on the run to, or from, trouble. That there’s always a safe place to return to.
Yes, okay, maybe it’s
single night, but whenever they did meet for a hit, it seemed that the present weirdo usually ended up taking the lead like that. And Dean really despises giving up control during missions. Maybe in other situations is a different story - insert appropriately gross winky face - but nonetheless, this guy just kind of
Yeah, whatever. Ghosts aren’t even
It’s 4pm when Dean Smith walks into the office with the cubicles of salespeople, five floors below himself. The chatter from the employees in matching yellow shirts and headsets is loud enough to make him appreciative of the five floor sound barrier.
”I try to be.” Dean smiles at his simple silliness. ”I would like to discuss the next plan of action, now that it’s nighttime once more. Are you decently dressed?”
”I brought you into danger on numerous occasions,” Castiel says to the sky. ”Now we’ve been set back on our lead, which I immediately sought after. I shouldn’t have been impulsive just because I thought I knew.”
”My ass doesn’t need saving.”
”Sure,” Sam shrugs.
feel the frustration bubble over his edges, like a pot left on the stove. ”Wife at home listening in on your conversation with your…
And if Dean could choke again, he would. ”Who taught you that word?” he rasps, fist banging on his chest and trying not to cough up his lungs. ”Who?
It’s just quite the sight for sore eyes, man, and Dean clenches his jaw with determination not to actually get another boner like a damn teenager. Because if his pride is still around , somewhere, someplace, dust in the wind, then that would definitely be the deal-breaker for it to say bye-bye now.

things you wouldn’t understand.”
”And Siri darkside-Superman’d me,” he added, and Dean literally dropped the bags to the floor. ”Yes, I was shocked too. I meant to say I love
A mere 15 minutes later, Dean Smith is too hot in his clothes. And it’s not only because Cas Novak is painfully attractive and achingly close to him.
”Want to talk privately?” Dean asks him in a murmur.
”Fuck,” is all Dean can say, wanting to just rut against him until he comes, all those frustrations and tensions released over him.
Not even his stupid baby brother. Nuh-uh.
“I owe him really badly, don’t I?” Dean supposes, gnawing on his lip as he turns back to Sammy.
Judas Priest sings back at him from the old-fashioned stereo about breaking the law, breaking the law, and consequently he makes it there in time regardless, even if it’s accomplished by speeding. As soon as he jumps out from the Impala in its newfound parking spot and rounds the corner to the street, he feels a force take him through the air, and suddenly he’s on top of the building where they met the nights prior.
Dean clenches his fists in rage. He doesn’t care who this guy is, what he’s doing; he’s letting Cas die on the floor! Dean is sure it was him who put them in that position in the first place, so, is it a set-up? He’s not sure, but fuck everything, because he’s not going to play nicely from this point on until he gets his way and can see if Cas is even still
”Now, you have a promise to fulfill,” Cas finishes, and Dean kind of just wants to, like, sink to his knees and pray for Daddy, and not a priest kind of Father but the one in front of him asking for more respect just with the way he’s looking at him.
He doesn’t know how he knows, but it’s Thunderbird. It’s him. Unmasked. Unsuited.
”What?”
Castiel tilted his head. Could Dean
In short, all his Greatest Hits. Furthermore, in short, being beat up for nothing makes him feel particularly whiny. (This morning had been a game of who could be loudest: Dean cursing and moaning while stretching his taut muscles, or Sam bellowing through the wall for him to shut the bleep up.)
making out.
He exits the manager’s office and walks into the empty Sanford corridor, its emptiness eerie in the quiet and darkness. The heel of his oxfords echoes and is the only sound bouncing against the pristine walls, and he’s about to pull out his headphones for some quality time with a podcast to fill the silence, when he hears the elevator ping and he snaps his head up.
Sam gives him an exasperated look when he lifts his face from his book. “Bite me.”

. Anyway.”
Granted, if Dean was a little less sappy at the moment, he could also make a list containing moments like oh, everytime he looked up at Cas from down on his knees, white shirt unbuttoned over his collarbones and demanding where Dean should put his mouth… Also top notch moments to be alive, to be fucking honest. But yeah. Romance, and stuff. Cas, in short, is just awesome.

”Why do I always end up with the looneys?” he murmurs to himself instead. ”For real, where did you come from?”
”Nah, you ain’t seen what I can do. I’ve broken into worse places. Banks at gunpoint, the lairs of super villains, you know, the usual. I’ve got magic fingers.”
Castiel turns around, and Dean swears he smirks too. He’s such a piece of

His cock is greedily aching against the protective gear and

Dean drops his spoon. It clinks so loudly onto the plate he startles too. ”Goddamn it, Cas,” he murmurs, heat creeping up his neck. ”Shouldn’t be having those kinds of conversations at the kitchen table.”

crisis. He shakes his head vigorously before he grumpily follows.
”How does it feel to be 30, Dean-osaur?” Sam asks him eventually over his plate, sharing the small kitchen table they acquired from Ikea a while ago. Which is kind of crazy, seeing as most of their furniture used to be found on the street, or at various flea markets. Now they’re shopping where normal people go, apparently, and that’s a really, very cool thing.
”I should tell you,” Castiel adds before they reach the fence surrounding the building, ”something is compromising my strength. I guess, weakening me.”
”You know,” Dean started to say, in that murmur that Cas liked so much, almost like a purr, “you kind of text like you’re fixing Heaven. Very,
”I see,” Thunderbird says, still looking at Dean. ”Likewise.”
Castiel squints. ”Who?”
Because Dean Winchester is not Demonblade. Dean Winchester is your friendly neighbour mechanic. He obviously has callouses and scars and bruises and homemade stitches and the stiffest body a 29-year-old could possibly have because he fixes up darling cars for a living. He doesn’t own one himself because it’s expensive, not because the one he does own and adore attracts very much attention like a Batmobile and is secretly stored in a garage specifically for missions. He never has an address because he moves a lot, not because he hasn’t had a stable home since he was 14 and has been moving where crime rates go up since he was eighteen. He lives with his younger brother because times are tough, not because they fight crime together.
”You’re gonna be a

Dean smiles at his chaos, eyes still on Thunderbird. If he didn’t know any better, he thinks he might just be smiling back.

Dean follows Sam’s gaze over his shoulder at Thunderbird being photographed, not by the press, but by another group of girls waiting in line. He chuckles at the sight. Guy looks confused as all hell, blinking at the flash on their mobile phones, hair all disheveled like he just rolled out of bed.

Dean frowns immediately. He remembers his dick is still exposed for the world so he grumpily tucks himself back in. ”What?”
Behind where he’d stood, Thunderbird appears, his switchblade in hand. There’s no blood on it.
That’s like, poetry that’s already been done.” Sam moved his arms as he searched for words. “A mixtape that explains how you feel?”
Dean looks up at Cas, still watching him silently. ”Can my buddy hear this too?”
. But Dean also wouldn’t have a weirdo soldier as the devil on his shoulder or the bane of his existence.
He whistles an impressed tone. ”Damn. Dude got style.”
“Yeah,” Sam snides, “sure, this is our fabulous love-hate relationship.”
”Thank you,” Thunderbird breezes and steps inside.
“Sure.” Dean swallows thickly and hits Sam on the arm. “What about you, loser?”
as it probably should be said, because apparently he’s very bad news.
Perhaps something had tampered with his memory, which would work in Castiel and Sam’s favour, because maybe he’d get a chance to explain the situation for him as it actually was.

”I don’t know a Mickey McDonald,” he says, confused. ”Is he a friend?”

Oh, shit.

”Years of practice,” Dean tells him. Being siblings, it’s kind of obvious. ”I know I give him a lot of shit but, really, that’s my lifeline. He’s really the one to praise about anything I contributed with logically. He’s great at research, brought me out of a lot of sticky situations. Me, I kinda just punch things and hope for the best.”
Dean doesn’t have time to connect the dots. Cold sweat on his back, he diverts his frantic eyes back to the man in his arms.
(Is it really too much to ask if Dean just wants to
”The mixture might be intriguing,” Castiel reasons, seeming to be picturing it. ”Sweet and savoury with the fermented dairy. It was already a little strange as is, so this might just work.”
“No!” Slade bellows, starting to punch after Castiel, but he’s gone.
”Tough crowd,” Dean sighs when the silence has stretched on for too long. He claps his hands together and rubs his palms in anticipation. ”So. Showtime?”
This is when he gets suddenly pinned back to the wall in a different way, as he feels a force push him back by the shoulders, how it tilts his head back slightly as he looks down at Cas with half-lidded eyes. Dean just grins wider as he sees how Cas’ darken with wants and needs, finally taking control while his hands can stay busy elsewhere.
Castiel thought that, if Dean could fly like Cas could, he’d already be in the room to demand an answer. But the Impala was fast. And Dean was fairly reckless sometimes. Cas looked up at the cement wall beside him and imagined the sound of the crash as the headlights would come breaking through.
He’s used to saying
Castiel breathes out sharply, then bites down on his neck, leaving a determined hickey; it aches so fucking good compared to the rest of Dean’s sore body. Like everything hurts except this right here, everything in the world except them.
“Okay, so a strong
”I like this plan,” Castiel tells him against his skin, hips moving rhythmically into his touch and driving Dean crazier and crazier, as if it was even possible to begin with. ”Better than your other ones.”
He turns back around to face him, raising a finger. ”What are you seriously even doing?”
That snaps Dean back to reality.

is, because doesn’t he know Dean loves cowboys and loves them to a point of not even caring they wear nothing but the hat itself? Because doesn’t he know he literally watches porn with them as the main characters whenever he has a moment alone? Doesn’t he know that this will significantly damage his sanity? (Or, you know, what’s left of it and all that jazz.)
“I have a stronger preference for the plants,” Cas tells him sensibly. He walks before Dean up to the section of pots. “Peace Lily,” he suggests. “Clears the air. Easy to take care of.” Cas lets his hands float carefully around its edges, like a caress that doesn’t dare touch. Feeling its energy? Hippie peace and love crap? “I like to watch them grow, how they bring life.”
Dean crosses his arms and sputters. He totally wasn’t caught being a creep. Nobody saw nothing. ”What can I say,” he attempts, “I like me a man in uniform.”
He considers him. ”I don’t think that would be suitable. We have a very businesslike stance as is, and it would be unwise—”
a few days prior without a reason. At least Castiel couldn’t imagine he had. Dean usually had very good explanations for anything. He kind of wished momentarily that he was here, to solve the quarrel.
much more fun up my sleeve.”
”Happy birthday!” Sam hollers. He’s got flour stains all over his red flannel shirt and Cas has a complimentary smear of icing on his cheek.
Vile were the words that he let bubble over, and despite being the catalyst for what had transpired, he couldn't understand why it pained him so. His chest felt claustrophobic, clamped tightly, threatening to steal him of breath and life, and just when he felt like he could take one satisfying deep breath, he choked. His stomach seemed to be in an intangible knot when he recalled how broken the other had seemed, how anger had flashed through the angel's features in a way he'd never seen before, twisting him to appear villainous. He hoped he would say something when his mouth opened a mere centimeter. He let go of the tension and was ready for the scolding, begged for it.
Dean had always been Sam's support, always the one standing for him when he cowered from his father, the one to urge him on when he expressed his wish for an everyday life. He had been forced into a position at so young an age that it was impossible for him to find an outlet. Their father was more of a sergeant and coach than anything. But while Sam could always turn to Dean to be proud of him, Dean needed validation, and unfortunately, his only option was John. Cold and rigid from the life he has been living, unable to see his son for what he was, a child in loss of a mother, and in need of a father. He put up with the worst of it, and all Sam had done was complain and hate him because he was still in the life, not seeing that his brother and almost every hunter had been dragged into the life as well.
¨Where did he go?¨ A question that shined in its simplicity, but Sam had long learned that Dean, someone so emotionally constipated, did better when given a simple question with not too much emotional charge. Truthfully Sam had wanted to as
Unfortunately, he did know one thing, set in stone and true just like God's tablets, the disgraceful and troublesome things that they were. He was aware of how he managed himself the few times emotion did seep through. It was only ever scorching red, vibrant, and radiating as it bubbled over, and he couldn't help but open his mouth and let such horrible foulness escape time. It was always anger, never anything useful like sadness; only the most damaging of emotions could ever escape him. The older sibling harbored it for so long towards himself. He deserved it; he had failed so often that despite wanting to keep count, he found himself unable to. He hated himself, and the moment he could shift the blame, he did. He hated himself because all he could do was hurt people, good and bad, family and not, deserving and undeserving.
"Fuck if I know where he went, but I know I messed up. I messed up. I'm saying it, so why won't he just come back." His brother exclaimed, tugging his hair as his eyes only became more bloodshot, the threat of tears very prominent," I-I didn't mean it. None of it, I'm, just bring him back, tell me you can get him back, Sammy." The blood was now running thick, just like the disgusting goo the leviathans left in their hurt, thick, and Sam panicked.
"You're all patched. Go rest. I'll wake you up for lunch or before then if I find out where he is." He wouldn't look at him, and even though he so desperately wanted to fight, to say that he needed to be there to help but he couldn't. Instead, he picked himself up, if only barely, and made his way to his room now more than ever a prison of his own making, and in his solitude, he let himself say what had been storming in his mind since his youth.
In a more reserved part of himself, he silently hoped Castiel would hear his prayers or pain and come back, even if just to make sure he was okay. That Dean was sixteen years old, fresh-faced, and eyes rimmed red in an abandoned building a few miles from where he and his father had rented. The case was wretched at best, a severe case of seemingly bloodthirsty and sadistic vampires who liked to play with their food before the deed was done. As with almost every case, they had fought, but unlike times before, Dean had run, had let himself feel free, and huddled in the corner of a room with far too many rats and missing boards. Instantly that adrenaline had dwindled and was immediately replaced with fear and self-hatred. His only comfort came in a stupid sentence muttered between his teeth:
He knew of his cruelty, how disgusting he was, how repulsive he remained when his friend, his family, had instead closed his mouth. Looking at him with so much agony, and instead of hurting him, he had kept to himself and let a few tears escape him before he turned and left the bunker. Crying wasn't something angels do. Dean wasn't even sure if they could do it, but he realized it too late, so when he ran up the stairs, tripping him on his way up to prevent him from seeing the other man's leave, in typical fashion, he was too late. On his way down the stairs, they lulled him instead, all the way to the chair closest to him, collapsing and wallowing as he shook with a flurry of emotions that he couldn't quite name.
The gashes were deep, disgusting canyons that gushed a bright white light that, while beautiful, just pained him. Things were the same, evreything quiet. The angel hadn't struggled. When he knocked, he gave no response, and Sam, afraid of the worst, had barged in to find him slouched over the side of the bed. It was so quiet, almost like a clone of Castiel, he just looked up and back down to his gashes. With no care in the world that the younger Winchester was there, he went to make another gash along his left forearm. It was only Saam launching himself over the angel that stopped him from following through.
Rest assured, the brothers had both adapted pretty well given their circumstances, which is to say, after the
Dean freezes with the cheese as a string between his mouth and the pizza slice, sinking downwards in the space in between, comically slow.
Hearing Cas say the word
”You do?”
He falls forward, still grinding, Cas’ hips bucking up to meet him sloppily. But he needs
Castiel pokes his tongue out and licks a stripe up Dean’s spent cock, so that he draws a sharp breath, hips arching up from the chair that creaks miserably beneath him. Dean watches with big eyes as he kisses the head, swallows the cum, just like,
”It wasn’t a good thing?” Thunderbird questions, a concerned wrinkle between his eyebrows as he steps forward.
are you doing this?” Dean chides, trying to keep his voice from shaking with rage or fear.
”I wouldn’t rule it out. Look.” Sam clicks back to the first tab, the article about Valkyr himself. ”Our friend Val was suspected of murdering a businessman - drumroll, please - named Eric freakin’ Jorgenson. Now, taking into consideration the name, time and place…” Sam looks up at Dean for emphasis. ”I think you saved his

of years old.” Dean pats Castiel half-heartedly on the shoulder, opposite him at their small kitchen table. ”No offense, baby.”
I didn't plan to post this on this date but happy 2 week wedding anniversary to Dean and Castiel?! Keep reading if u wanna<3
Dean takes himself out of his boxers while he speaks, and with Cas’ forehead leaned against Dean’s shoulder he can only imagine what his face looks like now. Dean wouldn’t admit to it, but the sounds he makes are definitely going high-strung as Cas does as told, wrapping a large hand around both of them; if the size of his hands were a turn-on before, it gets him a step closer to spontaneously incinerating with what they can fit in them.
“Cas?” mumbles Dean into the pillow, voice muffled, brow furrowed.
“I want to,” Cas confirms with a groan, but can’t seem to stop touching his body, fingers ghosting below his waistband. Like he wants so much but doesn’t know how to get it.
”The Enochian shit?” Dean questions, spinning around towards him on the cold, moon-lit gravel.
“It’s required,” Castiel informs him, very seriously. But then he lights up in a meek smile. “I’d like to know how to.”
That being said, he should clearly have done more research before they met that night about a month ago; at least Sam should have before he tracked him down. But Thunderbird is supposedly quite well known in the business and, what the hell, he deserves to laugh from time to time. Even he can admit that.
So Cas turns around and peeks his head into Dean’s bedroom, thankful the door doesn’t make a noise in the quiet of the night. The lights are off, a dim sheen coming in from the corridor outside where he stands, falling like a slit across the neatly cleaned up floor. “Dean?”
far away. ”This is a pretty good spot too.”
Because Cas doesn’t even know what he looks like. He never saw him fully unmasked.
So then Dean nibbles on his neck, getting a sigh of basically pure desperation in return. He rocks his hips, just to try to tease him, make it harder to unbuckle him. Oh yeah, he thinks he’s being
Now he could play his music without the worry of bothering anyone, without the fear of the silence taking over.
Oriphelji was a bond that angels had to their Nephilim children. It only affected them once one of them died, slowly draining the other's energy and life force until they died. Fortunately for them, two days later, Castiel was back on his feet, better than ever, as if nothing happened. Deciding not to press their luck, they just blamed it on luck. Then Belphegor had been revealed for the snake of a demon that he was, and Castiel had to lose Jack again. But he knew it wasn't Jack, but this abomination had worn his sons face, Dean had allowed it to use a member of their family as another meat suit, and he had to put him down. There was nothing left of him after that. He would walk from one end of the bunker to another, bumping into things and people as he did. If he were a human, they'd be concerned, but instead, they let him be, at least Sam did.
Finds it overwhelming with how it embraces him in its circle of muted noise, its deafening, its madness, and it drives him over the edge. His throat burns, pulses and aches with the need to scream, to holler until he is the one to mute himself. To fill the void that left him feeling so defenseless, so weak. And if there was one thing that Winchester men weren't was weak, his father had been sure of nailing that into his head. Instead, he let his throat itch so unbearably painful that he was sure it was a nightmare. Pain like this couldn't be real.
It was Sam who had started throwing his stuff in there after a particularly nasty skinwalker case. Dean had thrown a fit over ruining Baby's seats with monster blood after he spent hours on a bloodstain no one would take accountability for. Pacing back in forth in the kitchen, muttering about having a bunch of "ungrateful bastards" in the bunker. Sam had mouthed him off, smiling when he caught Cas trying to hide his smile. His quick solution was the broom closet. Without much thought, he had chugged what he could in there. It turned out long term. They had everything organized. They had taken perhaps their only trip to Target ever to get cubbies and labels for everything, and so the broom closet became less useless than they initially thought. He started going there more after Belphegor, dusting, and cleaning the weaponry strangely calmed him.
The one who would drop everything in an instant if it meant being of use to the boys, he had done it more than a dozen times. He was never an acquaintance, they had been introduced as family, eyebrow-raising when John said it, and even if he hadn't, the man had earned his place. The same kind-hearted, scared and broken man who loved so much he'd paid with his life to keep the boys going. Everything was meant to hurt the older man, and the prolonged silence that followed only made the itch behind his eyes waver to the point of being unbearable. Then the backdoor slammed shut, and he rushed in.
"Get away from me." He should have stayed quiet. The older of the two knew it. It seemed everything that managed to leave his mouth only made it worse for him. His voice came out hoarse like scraping rust of a panel. Broken and overwhelmingly sad. Despite that, he only shook his head before resuming his ill attempted escape plan.
Saying that things hadn't gone according to plan was an understatement. In fact, if you looked at it, the transgression, through an outsider's lens, it seemed like that had no plan with how rapidly everything fell apart. In the end, they had all come out losing. They had all fallen for Belphegor's tricks. They had all failed. In the end, they had lost so many, and they all felt the aftermath of their parting.
He hates the quiet.
Then a demon, foul and repulsive, the vain of Castiel's existence had taken his son's body as a vessel, and it nearly broke him. For days he couldn't look up from the ground, and when he did, his eyes were glossed over, and Sam couldn't stand the look of it. Eventually, the glossiness disappeared, but he still wouldn't hold contact with Dean or Belphegor. There was a hole in the wall, right next to the Men of Letters archives of written testimonies. He had been sat adjacent to it when lethargic as a sloth, Castiel had stumbled his way into the main room. He was pale, jittery to the point of concern. After all, he was an angel, any human illness couldn't affect him, so it raised concerns. Dean had been the one to get to him first, panicked hands and concerned eyes quickly morphed into anger when Cas only weakly managed to pull him off and stated coldly that he refused to accept his help.
Right now, it felt unbearable.
It hadn't been gradual. Instead, it was violent and sudden, stunning in its speed. Dean was relentless in his accusations, never letting up on blaming Castiel for their mother's death, and all Castiel would do was take it. A punching bag, and hypocritically, that only made Dean angry. He didn't want to fight. He wanted a snap and a retort to justify his violence towards the other, Castiel, however, would only listen, and it fueled the other's anger. It got to the point where that's all Dean did, wait by the angel's door so the second the other man came out, he could insult him. Then it spread to an issue between the three of them.
The four sentences that had started it all, and in the end, what was it all for? It was the only time the angel had responded to him in full sentences, and it was to throw himself a pity party. Dean had seen red. Now, as he stared at his brother with a needle in hand, ready to fix Dean's stupid mistakes, he cussed himself over. He was but a fuck up. A hypocrite, he had done the same thing for years. He was no one to judge.
His left hand was still raised high with his empty glass as he toasted to whatever was left, to whoever could listen and saying what he had wanted to for years. He felt like a druggie, locked away in rehab. In the corner of a room with lights far too bright, scorching his eyes if he dared to stop squinting, his emotional state long beyond repair, and so cold. Freezing as he let go of his second glass, it felt so lovely to hear it collapse. Sam had bought them on an impulse, and he had dropped two on one as well. The sound of it was crisp, and he laughed as he pummeled his hand into the fresh pile over and over.
