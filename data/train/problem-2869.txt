Cas met Charlie, Benny and Gabe in the cafeteria and informed them about Dean. "Oh my god! That asshole!" Charlie said looking pissed. "Yeah, Dean wants me to come over after swim practice since we can't go on our date." Cas said pushing his potatoes around on his tray. "Good. Someone should go see him." Benny said. Cas didn't know who this Alistair was but he wanted revenge for hurting Dean.
Dean gave a quick knock on the door and went inside. “Dean! Oh it’s good to see you sweetie.” Charlie’s mom said coming up to the two.
"Okay, uh. She should have everything she needs, but you know where the key is." I said once we dropped Mary off at Johns. "Cas, babe, she'll be fine. We're going to be gone 4 1/2 days. Not a month." Dean said tugging on my arm gently. We got in the Impala and Dean headed for the interstate, "oh baby, how I missed you purr!" Dean said patting the dash and I just laughed at him. We arrived at the hotel around 12:30, "whatcha say Cas? Wanna head out and grab something to eat and then tonight we can get room service?" Dean asked. "Sure, let me go to the bathroom first." I said.
“Lay down.” Cas whispered and Dean’s back hit the mattress with in seconds, Cas then kissed down Dean’s chest and stomach nipping here and there until he got down to Dean’s jeans. “Up.” Cas said while tapping Dean’s hips.
Sam came downstairs a few minutes later with sandwiches and bottles of water, "I figured you'd be hungry…" Sam said handing Cas a plate with two sandwiches and a couple bottles of water. "Thanks Sam." Cas said and uncapped one of the waters and handed it to Dean, "thanks." he mumbled and took a drink. Once Henry was burped and changed Dean came back to the living room, "Dean? Can I hold him?" Sam asked and he gently handed his son down, "you can hold him anytime Sammy." Dean said and went to go eat his sandwich.
I woke up to Mary's blue eyes staring at me, "mama? Where's daddy?" Mary whispered and fresh tears started forming. "Daddy'll be home in a few days." I whispered back not knowing if it was the truth or not. I knew my heat was coming up in a few day's and I didn't know what do do, I want to talk to someone, but I don't know who… An hour later I picked up the phone, "Hello Cas, how are you honey?" Missouri's sweet voice calmed me down quickly, "Hi Missouri, I-uh.. Can you come over? I just really need to talk to someone." I said with my voice shaking a little "of course honey, I'll be over in a minute."
"Dean I don't understand why do-" Then it hit him, the sweet smell of Dean's slick but times 10. Dean went into heat, "Cas I'm sorry, I-I I'm not ready for any of this. I just hurry and take me home please." Dean pleaded tears forming in his eyes. "Alright, calm down." Cas soothed and climbed over the seat and tore out of the field.
"He's really home Cas." Dean smiled and leaned into his arms on the couch. "I know. I'm so happy." Cas whispered and kissed the top of Dean's head. "You know, we should probably go to bed… That way we have some sleep in before he wakes up." Dean mentioned and Cas agreed.
"He kissed someone else." I whispered, "well, that's not so much cheating if you ask me." Missouri said softly and my head shot up "what? How is that no cheating? He kissed another woman." I said getting mad, "Cas calm down please, did he sleep with this woman? She asked "I don't know, he said he didn't but I confronted her, and she said that we did." "Well, who do you want to believe?" "Dean." I whispered. "Then you believe Dean. Now, I suggest that you give that boy a call and tell him to get home so you two can talk things out, all the way, no storming out or anything." Missouri said softly and before I could answer I heard the front door open then Mary yelled "Daddy!" "Looks like you get your chance now." Missouri said standing up and giving me a hug.
Gabe found a cute girl by the punch table and that left Dean and Cas to themselves. "Wanna dance?!" Cas shouted and Dean just shrugged and let his boyfriend drag him onto the dance floor next to their friends. Cas and Dean slow danced to 'Thinking Out Loud' by Ed Sheeran and Dean wont tell anyone but it was now one of his new favorite songs.
"Hey, look at me." Mary said and Dean wearily looked over at his mother, "I'm not trying to take the spotlight away, but honey, if I can do this twice, you can do it." she said patting his knee. "UGH!" Dean yelled and pushed some more, "I can see his head Dean, keep going!" Tessa said, Dean couldn't tell what was sweat or what was tears running down his face, quite frankly he didn't give a shit.
“What?!” Cas gasped now wide awake. He slid out of bed and didn’t bother putting his shirt on due to the urgency in Charlie’s voice. He ran down the stairs and saw Amelia standing by the door having a glaring match with Gabe.
At the house Dean was digging through the cabinets trying to find something to make for supper. "Sammy! What sounds good for supper?" he called out. Sam came into the kitchen and sat at the island, "I don't know…" he mumbled, "ugh, you're no help… What about pork chops?" Dean asked, "sure, can you make your garlic mashed potatoes?" Sam asked eyes going big to complete his puppy eyes. The doorbell rang and Dean rolled his eyes, "yeah, go answer the door bitch." "Jerk." Sam huffed and hopped off the stool.
Ellen got out of her jeep to help the boys, "now, I'm sure you're itchin' to get home, so Bobby's there now making some lunch then we'll make some dinner before we leave. Jo really wanted to stay but she needed to head back to school." Ellen said as she helped Dean into the jeep.
Upstairs, Dean was just about to really fall asleep when he heard Cas quietly walk in. “Took you long enough.” he mumbled.
Dean started to calm down and came back into focus but still flinched when Cas went to wipe away tears. “There you are. Let’s get you off the floor.”
“I love you more.” Dean gave him one more kiss before disappearing into the house. He practically ran up the stairs, carefully laid the suit on the bed and went into the bathroom.
“YEAH!” Henry yelled and immediately took her hand so she could lead him to the kitchen. Dean chuckled and headed towards Charlie’s old room. Charlie and her dad were already filling boxes when Dean walked in.
Once he was out the door, I slid down so I was laying on my back only to change my position so I was laying on my side and my eyes drifted shut. I heard John come back into the room but I didn't open my eyes; I felt a hand brush my hair back and then John kissed my forehead and I heard him whisper, "love you Cas, you are my son no matter what." I knew John saw me as one of his sons but hearing it always made me happy and feel better about myself for some reason.
Half an hour later Alexander Ross Novak was born at 2:40 pm weighing 4 pounds 3 ounces. Gabe got to hold him for a moment before they took him to the NICU, "Cassie, did you see him? He's beautiful." Gabe said "he is beautiful Gabe, you did good big brother." I smiled and kissed his forehead and went out to the hall. "Cas! Is he okay?" Dean asked, Anna and Balthazar had shown up along with Amelia, Charlie and Gilda.
By time they got to school their second class was half over, "I'll see you in Bobby's." Cas said kissing Dean's cheek before heading to chemistry, Dean walked into his art class and everyone just stared at him making him feel a little uncomfortable. He shook it off, not wanting to ruin his good day, he silently went and got his sketching and sat down giving Ms. Holt a small smile.
Dean got up and followed Charlie inside and found Cas in the kitchen filling a cup up with water. Smirking, Dean snuck up behind Cas and smacked his ass.
"She said it's fine just take it easy." Dean said and attacked Cas' chest kissing and licking and slowly sunk to his knees, kissing anything he could. Cas could feel himself growing harder as Dean kissed lower on his stomach, the faint smell of Dean's slick was filling the air which caused Cas to moan.
Dean and Cas sent Charlie home hours before they came home. It was now a little after 7 when they pulled into the drive way. Cas carried in a sleeping Henry up the stairs and tucked him in. When he came back downstairs Dean and Charlie were talking quietly. Cas was about to ask if they wanted to oder some food when there was a soft knock on the door.
Once again Dean woke up in the early morning feeling nauseous. At least this time he was on the outside of the bed so when his stumbled out, he didn't knock Cas off the bed as he ran to the bathroom. Cas didn't feel him get out of bed but he did wake up when he heard Dean getting sick. He found his new mate crouched in front of the toilet puking up last night's pizza. "Dean? Is there something you need me to do?" he asked quietly and Dean just shook his head. He slumped back against the wall when the nausea passed and flinched a little when he felt a cold wash cloth be pressed to his forehead. Dean never even heard the faucet run, "thanks Cas." he mumbled keeping his eyes closed as Cas gently wiped his face. "No problem. Do you want to go back to bed?" Cas asked.
Cas decided to ignore them and gave up on waiting for Dean, feeling a little disappointed. He barley focused through Algebra and he couldn't help himself but basically run from his locker to photography once the bell rang. We walked in and Bobby was hunched over his desk with an exhausted look on his face and for some reason, it felt like someone dumped a bucket of ice water down his back.
Like I promised I was home a little before 1:30 with a few goodies from the bakery. I unlocked the front door and came into a quiet house. "Dean?" I called out and set the bag on the island and ventured into the living room, I stopped an smiled at what I found. Dean and Mary were cuddled up in the recliner asleep. Mary was in the crook of Dean's good arm with her head buried in his neck, I took a quick picture on my phone and set it as my background and went upstairs to take a relaxing bath. I was in the tub about 10 minutes before I heard footsteps in our room, I opened my eyes and looked at the door right as Dean snuck in. "Hey, when did you get here?" Dean asked closing the toilet seat so he could sit down.
“Dean. You went through a devastating event. If anyone should be apologizing, it should be me. I should have kept my own hormones in check and toughed it out.”
“Alright.” Dean sighed and sat in the rocking chair in the corner and couldn’t help but take a few pictures of Cas reading to their son and maybe a video or two.
His father said and hung up before Cas could answer. "You are a monster." Dean gasped once he got his phone and was rubbing his ribs lightly only wincing when he hit a tender spot. "Yes, but you love me." Charlie smiled, "that's debatable. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to tell mom Cas is coming over." Dean said and carefully eased himself off the floor.
Mary agreed to let Dean drive the Impala, seeing the smile on his face was the main reason she let him, even thought it brings back memories of her and John. Dean pulled up to the Gas 'N Sip so he could fill up and when he saw Cas through the window, butterflies swarmed in his stomach. Once he was done filling up baby Dean opened his mom's door, "mom do you want anything from inside?" "No thank you sweetie, don't stay in there too long." Mary smiled at him knowing Cas was in there.
Before they even got to the stairs, they heard running from upstairs and the faint sounds of Charlie being sick. “Go on up, I’m going to get her some water.” Dean said.
“A little bit. It was good to talk to Dr. Hansen today and just being near Henry again makes me feel better.”
"Cas, you're 17, you're technically a senior now, go out and party like a normal teenager, so what you knocked up someone." she shrugged, "Amelia, you have exactly 3 seconds to step away from my car." Cas growled. Amelia raised her hands in surrender and backed away from the car, "see you at the party Cas." she winked and walked away.
Dean watched closely and saw the fireman come through the cloud first then Cas, carrying a limp Henry in his arms, with Henry’s back pack over his shoulder.
"Dean, come in! How was your therapy?" She asked. "Fine… Here." He said and handed her the paper and he saw multiple emotions run across his mother's face. Sadness, confusion, shock and more sadness. "Oh Dean, if only I noticed sooner." Mary said and he saw a tear slide down her face. "Mom, it's okay. I did a good job of hiding this." Dean said and got up to pull Mary in for a hug. "Okay, well I can get you these on your way out. But will you tell me about your session?" She asked and Dean sighed.
“Because Cas is up to something and I know you’re in on it. I need to know what is going on.” Dean frowned.
"That was weird." I said and everyone just shrugged. 5 minutes later everyone started singing 'Happy Birthday' softly so they wouldn't wake Mary, my head shot up and Sam and Dean were carrying out a small cake and a few presents. "Guys, you know my birthday is in two weeks." I said smiling and blushing a little but no one could see. "We know, but we also know that you and Dean were wanting to be alone for a few days to celebrate your anniversary too, so we decided to celebrate now." Jess explained and carefully took Mary into her lap so I could blow out the candles and open the few presents I received I thanked everyone and we headed home.
"Really? You're an omega? Huh, I figured beta… Got to hand it to ya, you hide your scent really well." Cas said leaning in a little sniffing the air. "ha uh, well, my mom's a nurse, so she get's the good stuff." Dean said leaning away from Cas. Cas was about to say something but was interrupted by Mr. Singer "alright class quit your yammerin' now, Dean covered everything, but about the whole yearbook thing, it is during this class and this class only. Now if you think you can handle the responsibility of both creating the yearbook and getting your work done for photography, feel free to sign up. But your first assignment, I want you to go home and take pictures of what makes your family, and I want you to make a collage, bring it in Friday, and you have to be in at least two pictures. Oh, and you can call me Bobby, Mr. Singer makes me feel old, so uh, today just get to know each other." Bobby said and went back to his desk.
"You have a Christmas present waiting." Mary said and walked towards the kitchen. "Mom, it's Christmas Eve, there are lots of presents waiting." Dean whined but they followed her. "Hush and follow me." She said and opened the door to the basement; "okay, Cas sweetie take my hand and Dean take Cas' and close your eyes." Mary smiled a little and they just stared at her confused but closed their eyes and allowed Mary to lead them further into the basement.
They found Mary in the living room watching the news, "mom…" Dean said sitting on the couch with Cas following. "Okay, first things first. Are you keeping it or giving it up?" Mary asked shutting the tv off, "keeping it." Dean answered grabbing Cas's hand. "Alright, 2nd thing. I know this is going to be awkward, but Cas needs to claim you as soon as possible." Mary said, "what?! Why?" Dean asked bringing a hand up to his neck, "because, if you are un-mated and are pregnant, even if you do have your partner, it causes a very high risk pregnancy. So many rape victims or people come in with un planned pregnancies and have to stay in the hospital." Mary explained, "well then, Cas bite me." Dean said showing his neck, "Dean it doesn't work that way…" Cas said squeezing his hand.
"Yeah, well Dean's the narrator." Cas said trying to get the attention away from him, "oh that's great! Now all three of my boys are in the play!" Mary smiled and Cas' heart fluttered a little. Sure he already knew Mary considered him as one of her own now but it was still nice to hear. They ate around the island that night, "so when is the play?" Mary asked, "should be April 10th, 11th and the 12th." Dean said refilling his glass of water.
"Hello boys- oh you brought Mary with you! Hi sweetie." Dr. Maddison said coming into the room and Mary hid her face in Dean's shoulder. "Aw, someone's shy… How's she taking to the pregnancy?" Maddison asked, "pretty good so far. She asked Cas if he ate the baby on the way over here." Dean said causing Dr. Maddison to laugh "and why would she think that?" "she asked how the baby got in my tummy." I said already laying on the table.
At school, Cas met everyone in the lunchroom. "Oh. My. God. That snapchat of Henry sleeping melted my heart!" Charlie squealed, "it was pretty cute wasn't it." Cas smiled, "you know Benny, if you get snapchat, you could see totes adorbs pictures of Henry." Charlie said munching on a fry.
"The baby, what about the baby?" Cas asked holding his breath, "well, he or she's definitely a fighter, their heartbeat is lower than what we like, but other than that it's fine. We're monitoring them both." Mary smiled a little. "Mom, i-it's all my fault!" Sam sobbed, "honey, how is this your fault?" Mary asked sitting next to him, wrapping her arm around him. "Because, I w-was mad at him, because my friends can't hang out wi-with me anymore because their parents don't want them around Dean. A-and I snapped, and I called him selfish and that he was the worst!" Sam said.
Dean's breath hitched and he grabbed Cas' hand in a death grip and groaned. Cas noticed Ellen and Mary switch places and Mary began rubbing Dean's lower back, "just breath honey, it'll be over soon." she soothed.
“Here. Take this. You call or text me any time okay?” Dean said and handed her a piece of paper with his number on it. Jessica took the paper and followed her mom out of the station.
"Hey Cas!" Jess greeted giving me a hug, "hello Jess." I replied and kissed her cheek. "Where's Mary?" Sam asked once he escaped Dean's bear hug, "inside with Ellen putting her swimsuit on." I said giving Sam a hug and went to get some drinks from the cooler and I heard the conversation between the three. "What's wrong with Cas? He doesn't seem as happy as he usually is." Sam asked, "it's uh, it's a long story really…" Dean replied "we're trying to have another baby but no luck so far and it's getting to him. He thinks that he wont be able to have another one." "Oh, well that can be hard on someone, I'm sure everything is fine." Jess said and they all put on fake smiles when I came back, I handed Dean a beer and took a sip from mine.
"Bout half an hour ago, you and Mary were asleep and I didn't want to bother you." I said and closed my eyes again. "Oh, well I had a memory… That's why I came up here to find you", my eyes flew open and I sat up a little "you did?! Of what?!" "It's not a big one but it's the weekend we took during Valentine's Day. When you got me those STYX tickets." Dean said quietly.
"Dean, I think you should take his offer, about the job at least." Ms. Barnes said and he snapped out of his daze. "I-I what? What just happened?" Dean asked and he heard Cas chuckle, "you got offered a job with something you love to do and then the man offered you basically $600 for your paintings." Cas said still chuckling. Dean just let out a confused chuckle, "go home and think about it. Congratulations again kid. See you Monday." Dean just nodded and let Cas drag him back outside to the Impala.
"Oh my god, he lives!" Sam teased when Dean came into the kitchen buttoning up his flannel, "shut up Sammy." he snipped "make me, jerk." "bitch." Dean snapped and shoved Sam out of his chair. "Hey! Uncalled for!" "Your face is uncalled for!" "Both of you! Stop fighting and sit down." Mary scolded the two. "Sorry mom." Both boys answered at the same time, "come on Sammy let's go." Dean said grabbing his backpack "it's Sam." He corrected his older brother, "okay Sammy what ever you say." Dean said and walked out to the Impala.
They sat there for a few minutes before Dean spoke again. “How about after Henry wakes up and has a quick snack, we go get your things and bring it in then when Cas gets home we go out on a friends date. We haven’t done that in years.”
“Get some sleep red. I’ll take you to your car when you’re ready. I have my appointment and I’ve got to pick up Henry first though.”
“Mmmm sounds amazing.” Dean grinned and sat in one of the patio chairs. Cas went back inside to get everything ready to throw on the grill so Dean snapped Benny back, set a text to Charlie to see when she’d be home and another text to Ellen to check in on Henry.
Cas' heart was racing, in a few hours time he was going to be a father. Of course he knew it was going to happen, but here he was on his way to the hospital. He didn't even notice the truck stopped moving until Bobby called out his name, Cas snapped out of his thoughts and ran inside, "room 209, 3rd floor!" he heard Bobby call out.
"If that's alright with you of course." Cas chimed in; "what do your parents think of it Cas?" Mary asked, "they're out of town, I called them and informed them of the weekend and they just told me to be safe and to call Gabe if I have problems.. Which is odd, because I'm sure Gabe will be with us." he said. "Alright, as long as you
“Whatever Sam.” Dean huffed and made his way inside and immediately went to the backyard and gasped.
He burst through the door scaring Mary, "Dean! Oh my god you scared me! Wait honey what's wrong?" She asked when Dean just ran by her and up the stairs. She turned around and saw Cas come inside, "Cas honey, what's going on?" Mary asked starting to worry. Cas looked terrified also, "Dean, he uh… We were at our spot in the field and we uh. And he w-went into heat." Cas said blushing a little.
"What's his deal?" Amelia asked when Dean stormed off, "I'm not sure." Cas said and jumped when Charlie kicked him under the table. "I'll find him. I'm pretty sure I know where he went." Charlie said giving Cas the stink eye. "I'll come with you red." Benny said.
"What's up?" Dean asked, "I just wanted to make sure you guys were still planning on coming over tonight." Bobby said, "Oh, um mom said she'll try to make it, uh one of the nurses has something going on and is having trouble finding someone to cover her shift, so mom said she might be working a double. But Sammy and I will be there as long as there's pie." Dean smiled. "You and your pie." Bobby rolled his eyes, "alright get, I'll see you at 6." Bobby said and Dean waved and made his way to the door, only to almost run Castiel over. "Shit Cas, you can't just stand in front of the door!" Dean said catching them both before they fell, "sorry, I just uh, I wanted to wait for you." Cas said and looked down to see both their hands on each other's arms. Dean followed his gaze and let go, "alright, come on, I'm starving."
“Okay sweetie I’m going to show you my sketch. Is this what he’d look like?” Dean asked and showed her the drawing. Jessica’s eyes grew wide and panic set in, she quickly nodded but quickly moved her head away to puke. Acting quickly Dean tossed his things off to the side and grabbed her hair and held it back. “Shh honey, it’s alright.” There was a small knock on the door and Cas’ head popped in.
I obviously don't own the paintings, kuddos to the people who actually painted them, they're beautiful.
Gabe ran up the stairs and burst into his brothers room, "Jesus christ Gabe!" Cas yelled getting his heart rate back to normal. "Sorry, but uh Cassie, Dean's mom is down stairs and she looks a little wigged." Gabe explained and the color drained from Cas's face, "what does she want?" he asked, "I don't know, she just asked for you, she said it's Dean." Gabe explained and before he could say anything else Cas pushed by him and ran down the steps.
They got Henry situated in a room and Dean insisted he laid in the bed with him. Charlie and Mary walked in a little over an hour later.
"What does he mean you can't go back home Cas?" Mary asked, once she and Cas got Dean up and into a chair. "Uh, after we broke the news to my parents, they uh… They weren't happy and they kicked me out. Took my phone and said that I was cut off from the family, I have to be in court Monday so they can do the paperwork and everything." Cas explained. "Oh honey, that's awful. You'll just stay with us." Mary said, "thank you." Cas whispered.
“Coming right up.” Charlie said and kissed his forehead before going to get Cas. “He wants you Cas.”
Once the group at and payed for their meal they headed to the school. They got lucky and found a few spots by the front of the school so they could leave easier and made their way in. Their ears were assaulted with loud beats coming from the gym as they got closer, the louder the music got. "Ugh! I hate this music!" Dean shouted once they walked in, "suck it up Winchester! We're only here for bout an hour anyway!" Charlie yelled back and immediately pulled Dorothy to the dance floor along with Benny and Andrea.
Dean went up to the front desk and saw that Ava was behind the desk. "Hey Ava, do you happen to know where mom is?" "I can look, just give me a second." She said and started typing away, "she should be on break, come on I'll take you to the break room." She said and Dean followed. "There you go sweetie." Ava said and went back up to the front desk, Dean pushed the door open and poked his head in and saw Mary sitting at one of the tables with coffee and reading some flyer. "Mom?" Dean said catching her attention.
"Dean. It's a granola bar. I think I can suffice with out one." Cas winked and walked away before Dean could say anything else. 'Wait, did he really just wink?' Dean thought to himself. He ripped the wrapper off and threw it away as he walked towards History, one of the classes he didn't have with Cas. Which made him kind of sad, he felt comfortable around the guy, which made Dean think more about him. Once again he couldn't focus in class because he was thinking of Cas. 'I really need to do something about this.' Dean thought.
"This one's on ore my my favorite pictures." I said pointing to the one of Dean sleeping, the french doors were open so the sun was casting a soft glow in the room making Dean's tan skin look like it was glowing. The first album ended with Mary's first birthday. "There isn't much in the second album yet, but I do have our wedding video on my laptop if you want to watch it." I said setting the albums on my night stand. I found the video on the computer and hit play, about half way through the video Dean suddenly shut the lap top, "Dean what the hell?" I asked and looked over at him.
They got on the main road and another contraction hit, "oh god!" Dean groaned and held onto his stomach, "uh, jus-just breath Dean, breath through it." Jo said from the front seat, "shut up." he groaned and relaxed when it passed. "Cas, you gotta call Cas." Dean whimpered. "I'll call the school when we get to the hospital Dean, just relax." Ellen said and pulled into the emergency parking lot.
Thanksgiving was a lot easier than yesterday was. My stomach was calm and no dizzy spells. I only had to suffer through the hugs from Charlie and Ellen when we told them about the twins. "Do you know what they are?" Charlie asked, "no, we wont be able to find out till December or January. If we're lucky." I said. The rest of the day was spent with laughs, baby jokes and baby names tossed between all of us.
He put them in and headed to the bedroom, he opened his dresser drawer and reached for a pair of boxers when lacy blue fabric caught his eye. It was the pair of panties he wore what seems like a life time ago, Dean thew the boxers back in and grabbed the panties.
We started dating, we graduated high school, bought a house, got a cat, we got engaged, I started my first and last year of college, and I became the proud owner of one of the best bakeries in Lawrence. Things started getting better, after we spent my first heat together, I got pregnant.
“Cas, you do. Just by being here with me every day and loving me and our son unconditionally.” The two sat in silence for a little bit before Cas asked about Dean’s other appointment.
"Dad, give it back!" Dean yelled but John just ignored him. "What is this?! Who's sonogram is this?!" John bellowed glaring at Mary, but she just slowly shook her head. That's when it clicked in John's head, he turned and saw Dean looking at his feet with this 'Castiel' kid's arm wrapped around his waist. "Dean. Is this yours?" John asked quietly, and when Dean didn't answer John got furious. "DEAN!? IS. THIS. YOURS?!" He yelled, and Dean just nodded. "ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?! YOU'RE 16 YEARS OLD AND YOU GET KNOCKED UP?!" He yelled then turned to Mary, "What kind of mother are you?! Letting some alpha near her son while he's in heat?"
"Hi boys. How'd the appointment go?" John asked when we came into the shop. "Good, do you want to tell him?" I asked Dean. "Sure, it's a boy and a girl!" Dean said with a smile. "Wow, two girls, that boy sure gonna have to be strong." John chuckled "so what brings you by, besides the news of my grandkids." "I want to see baby." Dean said and John froze a little.
He was startled out of his thoughts when there was a knock on the door, "Dean?" He heard his mom call out. "Just a second." He replied and tugged his sweatshirt over his head and unlocked the door. "Yeah?" Dean asked putting his glasses back on. "The hospital just called, they need me to come in for the night, so I wont be home till tomorrow sometime. Can I trust you to get out of bed on time and make it to school?" She teased, "yes mom, I already have my alarm set, and I'm sure Sammy will wake me up if something happens." Dean smiled and gave her a hug "have a good night at work." He said and kissed her cheek before going in his room.
"I'm sorry honey." Mary said looking upset, "it's alright." Cas gave a small smile, "Dean honey why don't you try feeding him again." Mary suggested and he nodded. Cas got up to help him with the gown and this time Henry latched immediately causing Dean to hiss. "Still feels freaking weird." he muttered. "I know it does, but you'll get used to it." Mary chuckled, "look I need to start my rounds, but I'll be back in your room in about an hour so you can check out and change but you can come back up here. I don't know how long they'll let you stay." Mary said and kissed Dean's forehead before leaving.
"When will I be able to get this thing off then?" Dean asked a hint of disappointment in his voice. "Well, if your radius and ulna start healing as fast as your wrist, then I would say towards the end of next month."
“Well she still has the restraining order on her, her daughter could possibly be in Henry’s class so that may be a problem but until we know for sure, try not to worry too much about it.”
Two hours later they got the room painted, the wall with the crib was a dark grey and the rest of the walls were a light blue. "Oh, it looks nice boys. I was wondering what you were doing down here since I haven't seen you all day." Mary said peeking her head in, "thanks. Now we just need everything else." Dean smiled from the rocking chair he was sitting in. "I'm thinking about taking some pictures of him when he's born and then hanging them up too… Is that weird?" Dean asked, "no, I think it'll be cute. Then we can take a little family picture." Cas smiled. "Yeah, but who's gonna take it? I was planning on taking and editing them myself." Dean said. "I'll take it." Mary suggested.
After the last song played Dean and Cas made their way to the bedroom "Dean." Cas whispered and started kissing along his neck, Dean moaned and tilted his head to give his mate better access and started yanking on Cas' shirt. "This needs to come off." Dean whined, "what did Tessa say?" Cas grunted but allowed Dean to take his shirt off.
"You're such a saint for taking in Dean's mate…" the nurse, at the front desk said while her and Mary were talking about the weekend's events. "Well, of course I'm a little upset they're in this situation, but what's done is done." Mary sighed leaning on the counter. It had been a slow day at the hospital so she didn't really have much to do, she was picking at a scratch on the counter when the nurse spoke up. "Um, Mary is-isn't that your son?" she asked and Mary turned around and was frozen at the scene in front of her. Sam was running behind a gurney tears running down his face non stop, and Cas was at the gurney's side also crying and looking down.
He picked up the carseat and headed out to his car when he ran into Amelia. "Oh, sorry!" She apologized, "it's fine." Dean said and moved around her, "Dean." Amelia called out. "What?" Dean sighed and turned back around, "c-can I see him?" she asked, when he just shrugged Amelia smiled and bent over. "Oh he's so precious, he looks just like Castiel." She grinned, "yeah, I should go now." Dean said and went to leave again when Amelia stopped him.
"Thank you so much Missouri, you're a life saver." I said running up the steps with her and Mary in tow. "No need to thank me, I may be a beta but I know how tough heats can be. It's a good thing you got home so quickly, being a beta my senses aren't as strong but I'm starting to smell you. Now tell me what Mary needs for the night and lets get her things ready to go so John can just pick her up at my place." Missouri said heading up the stairs.
All they could do was stand there and wait. Charlie wrapped an arm around Dean and held him close. Suddenly a part of the building collapsed, Benny had gone back to crowd control so it was just Charlie and Dean.
Charlie asked "I don't know, I've always been an early riser…" I shrugged, "besides, as soon as Mary's out, she's out for the night unless there's a storm or she has a bad dream. She just like Dean." I said starting the batter for cupcakes. "Still don't know how you do it. Gilda has to practically shove me out of the bed and dump me in the shower before I get going." Charlie said.
I woke up the next morning with Dean's arm flung around my waist and his face buried in my hair snoring softly. I smiled and gently removed his arm and headed for the bathroom to take a shower. Dean was still asleep by time I got out of the shower so I got dressed and headed downstairs; I started a pot of coffee gave some food to Squirt and got a bowl of cereal. I drank the last of my coffee and Dean still hasn't woke up yet so I pulled on my tennis shoes and walked across the yard to get Mary. I knocked on the door and Missouri answered it with Mary on her hip; "MAMA!" Mary squealed reaching out for me.
Mary walked with Dean outside as soon as Cas pulled up, "alright I'll see you tomorrow." she said and kissed Dean's cheek. Cas got out of his car and helped Dean in. "So Charlie is itching to see you… I told her to give you some time to settle back home but I doubt she listens to me." Cas chuckled. "Wouldn't surprise me." Dean smiled but leaned back in the seat and closed his eyes.
"So Dean… It's been a while since we've met." Dr. Hansen started, "yeah…" Dean mumbled, "well for starters, congrats on your pup." he smiled. Which caused Dean to smile, "thanks… He's still in NICU, he's uh, he's deaf in his left ear." Dean said his smile fading just a little. "Uh huh, but how are you doing, I know some people can become depressed after birth."
"Why haven't I heard about this Jess girl?" Dean asked a little upset, "well, it was when you were still pregnant and already had a scare, so I didn't want to stress you out more. So I talked to Cas about it and asked him to keep it a secret because I wanted to get to know her. And I was afraid her parents were going to be like my other friends and not like her coming over here." Sam rambled.
“WHAT?!” Dean yelled again and turned towards the building that was engulfed in flames. With out even thinking Dean took off towards the building.
"Oh, god! Make it stop!" Dean groaned knocking things off his nightstand trying to shut off his alarm. I just ignored him and went to wake up Mary and I could hear Dean puking from Mary's room. Dean came down the stairs an hour later and I set down toast and coffee in front of Dean. "I smelled bacon, why do I get toast?" Dean asked taking a drink from the coffee. "Yes, Mary and I had some bacon and eggs. There wasn't much bacon to begin with." I said wiping off the counter. "Daddy!" Mary squealed running into the kitchen causing Dean to wince.
Downstairs Mary and Cas were trying to figure out how to get Dean off the floor. "Cas, you're going to have to pick him up bridal style… Do you think you can? If not, I think Benny might be able to." Mary said, "no, I-I can do it." Cas said confused to why there was a rush of anger running through him at the mention of Benny touching Dean. "Dean hold your breath." Cas said quietly and picked Dean up with out struggle.
"What?! Sammy that's crazy. You know that true mates are practically impossible to find." Dean said pulling into the drive way. "Fine. But if I'm right you have to buy me a new book." Sam said shoving open the door, "Sammy if you're right, I'll buy you a freaking library." Dean said and went to his room. He stripped down to his boxers and opted for a t shirt tonight and went back to his sketch book when he glanced at his bed. "shit." Dean groaned, he forgotten to wash his sheets. Dean threw on a sweatshirt and stripped the bed and walked to the washing room which of course was right by his mom's room. "Dean, I thought you said you'd wash those when you got home from school." Mary said sounding a little annoyed.
“Oh, okay. I’ll let you go back to bed, I’m sure you guys had a rough night. We’ll see you around 5. I love you.”
"Well what's the point of a baby sitter if he's going to sleep." Dean grumped, "hush. Knowing from experience he's probably exhausted, Alex was probably being very active. It can wear you out." I said and went to wake him up. "Gabe… Gabriel come on, wake up." I said shaking his shoulder gently, Gabe snorted and his eye jerked open. "Shit! I swear I didn't mean to fall asleep!" Gabe replied and I helped him sit up, "it's okay, we just got home, why don't you stay for dinner. Dean was just going to order pizza since both of us are too tired to cook." I said sitting down next to him and sighed in relief. "My feet are killing me." I groaned "I rub them for you mama!" Mary squealed and ran over.
I stared at the strips for a few seconds when I heard Dean's voice, "Cas? What's it say?" I turned around and hugged him; Dean pushed me back and wiped a few tears from my cheek, "Cas? Tell me please." Dean begged. "It's negative." I whispered, "oh. Uh.." Dean was lost for words. He lifted my head and stared at me, "it's okay Cas, we can try again on your next heat." Dean whispered wiping a few more stray tears. "I know, I just, I started thinking and I got excited. That's all." I said moving forward and rested my head on his shoulder. "I know baby, I got excited too." Dean continued to whisper and rubbed my back with his hand. "Hey, I did say I was going to let you fuck me didn't I?" I said kissing his neck.
20 minutes later a nurse came over to Dean, "Dean? We need to take Henry now for a quick clean up and do a little check up." she smiled. "Okay…" Dean said, he slowly transferred a sleeping pup into the nurse's arms and felt a twinge of sadness about leaving him here again. "He'll be home in no time." the nurse smiled, picking up on Dean's mood, he just nodded and followed the nurse out.
"PUT ME DOWN!" Amelia yelled and Benny set her back on her feet and Cas stepped forward. "Look Amelia, I don't know what you want, but leave us alone. I'm happy with Dean, we have a son who is coming home very soon and I'd like to concentrate on that. So, goodbye." he huffed and walked to his car, not bothering to wait to see if Charlie was okay.
Dean finished his business and found everyone in the dinning room, waiting for him so they could start eating supper. "So how'd it go sweetie?" Mary asked, "good." Dean said digging into the mashed potatoes. "It was more than good Dean. You should tell her." Cas urged scooping green beans onto his plate, Dean sighed, "I got second on the sketch of Lucy, first on the waterfall painting and I got best of show on the mountain landscape painting." Dean said.
"Dean, baby calm down, he's going to be okay." Cas said trying to calm him down but he flinched away, "don't touch me! I need to see my baby." Dean wheezed and tried to get out of the bed, "Dean. It's best if you stay and rest, it's very early." the nurse said pushing him back into the bed. "No, my pup needs me." Dean struggled and the nurse pulled a needle out of her pocket and put it in Dean's iv. "What's that, what're you doing!?" Dean shouted and started loosing consciousness. "Don't worry, it's just a sedative. I'll let Mary know what happened when she gets here." The nurse said quietly to Cas, who just nodded.
Um, well, he's in a coma, but I'm sure you already know that. His arm is broken in three places, along his wrist and a fracture on his ulna and his radius. The doctors think that he'll make a full recovery. You both were very lucky." Sam said, "what happened? I mean I know we were hit, but…" "A drunk driver ran a red light, his name was Alistair Morgan. He was killed on impact." Jess said quietly. We talked for a little bit longer when I finally heard Mary's voice; "Mama!" I looked up instantly and saw her running across the room. Sam picked her up and put her on the bed with me and I buried my nose in her curls. "We'll leave you for now. We'll be back tomorrow." Sam said and they left. "I'm glad you're okay Cas. How's Dean?" Missouri asked and took Jess's vacant seat. "Thank you Missouri, and uh… He's in a coma and he broke his arm in three places apparently. I haven't gotten to see him yet." I said and my voice broke at the end and everything finally crashed down; I hugged Mary tighter and cried which caused Mary to cry also.
Dean pulled off with a gasped and immediately closed his eyes and let Cas finish on his face and chest. “Come Dean.” Cas shuddered. Dean went back to stroking his own dick and came a few strokes in.
“I know I did, but you don’t say it… Why don’t we go play with your toys.” Cas suggested and carried him off to the living room while Sam, Dean and Charlie picked up the cards.
"Mama I get to see baby?" Mary asked from her carseat, "yes sweetie you get to see the pups. Remember there's two?" I said and then focused back on the road. "Cas? Can we stop at the auto shop on the way home?" Dean asked, "sure… Why?" "I uh. I wanna see the Impala." Dean said quietly. "Dean I don't know if that's a good idea… She's in pretty bad shape." I said and reached over to grab Dean's hand. "I know, but hey, maybe I'll remember things." We arrived at the clinic 5 minutes later and we were able to go right back.
"Oh, how is he?" "The swelling has gone down completely but they said they haven't seen any signs of him waking up soon." I said playing with the food on my plate. "He'll be awake soon, just wait and see." Missouri said and started eating. By time everyone ate and dishes were done Gabriel returned, "Cassie, you better have left me some grub. The baby's hungry!" Gabe yelled, "shhh, you idot. There's a plate sitting in the microwave just heat it up." I scolded, Gabe came back into the living room with his food and a giant glass of milk, "I put fresh sheets on the bed down here for you." I said not looking away from the tv.
"Once upon a time, in a far off Kingdom, there lay a village on the edge of the woods." Dean started, "I wish." Gilda sang, "and in this village," "more than anything," "lived a young maiden," "more than life! More than jewels…" "a carefree young lad…" "I wish, more than life!" came in Sam. "And a childless baker," "I wish" Cas and Charlie started, "with his wife." "More than the moon, I wish." they sang.
Panic set in naturally but Dean still held his ground but before he could react the alpha was suddenly on the ground with Sam kneeling on his back.
I said pushing him back a little, "okay, but hurry." Dean said kissing me one more time. "Ah, this is gross." I said pulling the items out of the box. "What?" "I have to pee in a cup and then I have to dip these strips in it and wait 3-5 minutes for results." I read of the box, "that is gross." Dean replied and left the bathroom. I put 3 strips in just to be safe and I waited. I was sitting on the edge of the tub running over situations if I was pregnant when there was a soft knock on the door. "Cas? Can I come in?" I heard Dean's voice come through the door, "yeah." I replied loud enough for him to hear. He sat next to me on the tub and took my hand, "you okay?" Dean asked me, "yeah, just thinking of what room to make the nursery if I am pregnant." I laughed gently, "well, it's been 5 minutes, wanna go see?" Dean whispered, "yeah." I said and let him pull me up; I walked over to the sink and grabbed the box to flip it over so I could see the color codes and looked at the strips.
Dean grabbed the remote and turned the tv on and made sure the volume was low enough not to disturb Henry. He shoved a bite of the sweet and sour chicken into his mouth before sitting against the headboard.
Cas just sat there holding Dean's hand and watching the little monitor screen they had up of the baby, sure there still wasn't much to look at; but it made Cas feel a little better. "Cas, honey, you should come home with Sam and I." Mary said quietly, startling him. "No. I'm not leaving them." Cas said trying not to sound rude, "I know you do honey, believe me; I want to stay too." Mary said, "please. J-just till he wakes up." Cas pleaded his voice shaking a little. "At least come home and eat something and shower. You still have blood on you." Mary suggested and Cas looked down at himself, "okay. Is there anyway I can stay with him overnight?" he asked not looking away from Dean and the baby monitor. "I'm sure I can arrange a few things." Mary said and wrapped her arm around him, ushering him out of the room.
“Charlie, it’s fine. I promise. Come over and hang out with me and Henry. We’ll go swimming or something.” Dean heard her sniffle and mumble an okay before she hung up.
Dean came out of the bathroom just to see Bobby leading Lisa towards what he assumed was the office, he shrugged his shoulders and went back to class. Once he sat down next to Cas he leaned over, "where's Bobby taking Lisa?" he whispered, "office, she said some rather rude things about you." Cas said angrily and Dean could smell the fading scent of anger. Dean just nodded and patted Cas' knee but never removed his hand.
“I’m going to get him home and see if I can’t get him down for another nap. It’s been a long day for both of us.” Dean sighed.
Cas didn't know why but by time lunch was over he was in a foul mood, even Benny and Charlie picked up on it. "Dude what's your problem?" Benny asked and Cas just let out a big sigh, "I don't know, I think Dean's upset with me because he was still sleeping when I left this morning and I didn't wake him up to say goodbye." Cas explained and they just nodded.
"Bedroom, now." Dean hissed and started pushing Cas out of the nursery. They made their way, very clumsily, to their bedroom. Cas could start to smell the thick aroma of apples "oh god." he moaned and almost ripped Dean's shirt off. Once the shirt was gone, Cas started mouthing at the mating mark. "Of fuck." Dean moaned and almost collapsed into Cas' arms, "too many clothes." Dean complained and started yanking Cas' clothes off. "Cas, please." Dean continued to moan "I love it when you beg." Cas moaned and started to push in when Dean stopped him, "wait! Condom." he panted "right." Cas nodded and ripped open the box and grabbed one and slid it on.
A week passed and still to pups, "Dean, find me the spiciest thing you can find at the store." I said one night while we were watching tv. "What? Why?" "Because, I've read that spicy foods sometimes help someone go into labor, I've already walked all over the house twice and around the back yard and that didn't help." I said "alright, I'll be back in 15. I'll have my phone." Dean said and left. 20 minutes later I was sitting in the kitchen with a Habanero Pepper cut up in strips in a bowl and a huge glass of milk. "This was the hottest one they had at the store." Dean said a slightly worried look on his face.
"You two did it didn't you." She grinned even wider looking more like the Cheshire Cat. When Cas looked away and the tips of Dean's ears turning bright red, she got her answer. "Ooohhhh you did! Lucky bastards, I haven't been able to see Dorothy in almost two weeks." she sighed and sat back in her chair.
"Mary? Would you like to go see Daddy?" I asked the two year old, "yes!" Mary squealed and jumped up and down. "Okay, but sweetie, you have to remember, he's asleep and he probably wont wake up. But that mean's you can't talk to him, I'm sure he can hear you." I said and put on her shoes and winter coat. We got to the hospital and found John already in Dean's room, "Grampa!" Mary yelled and ran over to John. "Hi princess. How are you?" John asked scooping Mary onto his lap.
Cas was watching the teenage omega through the two way mirror when another officer told him Dean and Henry had arrived.
“I don’t know why you’re taking me.” Sam grumbled as he threw his bag into the back seat of the Impala.
Cas slowly walked over to his mate and kneeled in-between Dean's legs, "it's going to be okay, can I have the blade?" he asked quietly and his heart broke when he saw Dean look up with scared, watery eyes. Slowly, Dean gave him the blade and Cas noticed Charlie peeking her head around the corner so he just held out the blade for her to take.
"no. Just heartburn." I said and shoved the bowl away from me. "I just want them out!" I cried and Dean pulled me into his arms, "I know baby, I know." I had just calmed down when Missouri knocked on the door and I could hear her and Dean's conversation. "How's he doing?" "Fine I guess. He's ready to have the pups but they aren't ready… We just tested the theory of spicy food and nothing so far." Dean replied.
Once in the car, Cas called their favorite Mexican restaurant and placed an order to be picked up. He made sure to get extra quest for Dean.
“Thank you Sam.” Ellen said and her and Bobby carried dishes to the kitchen. “Can you get the last dish out of the truck?” she asked Sam.
Once Henry was all cleaned up, Dean got him in his car seat and loaded up the Impala. “Thanks again Ellen.”
“His vitals look good, his oxygen is still a little low. I’m going to go get a look at his lungs to see if there’s any damage.” The doctor said.
“Okay well even if Cas and I were up to something, it would still be there no matter what time we got home. Slow down before you kill us.”
MY WIFI IS BACK BABY! It's actually been back for a while and I'm a horrible person, because I can't write worth a shit. Any way, let me know what you think!
There were more sonograms, pictures of the baby shower and of my progression of the pregnancy, then when I turned the page I heard Dean gasp, "oh my god." It was a bunch of pictures of Mary in the hospital after she was born, under the first picture it read 'Mary Elizabeth, born March 14th, 2014 at 6:30 p.m. weighing 5 pounds 9 ounces' "who's that?" Dean asked pointing to a picture of my mom holding Mary and I teared up a little. "That's my mother." I said quietly, "what? she kicked you and Gabe out… I thought she wasn't in your life anymore." Dean said and I could tell he was angry and confused, "Gabe told her about the baby and she found out where I worked at and she said she wanted back in my life, and that she wanted to be apart of Mary's… She uh, she died a few day's after the wedding, she had a heart attack."
“Benny and I aren’t close anymore. We’re still friends but it’s not the same and as for Charlie, she’ll probably be annoyed but she’ll probably end up officiating.”
"Parent's don't want you at prom, they think you'll be a distraction and a bad example for the other students, considering what happened after our last dance." he explained. "You're saying we can't go to prom?" Cas asked also getting angry, "exactly." Crowley said becoming bored with the conversation. "That is total BULL SHIT!" Dean yelled, "Mr. Winchester!" Crowley yelled back.
When Cas woke up again Dean was pressed against his side snoring lightly. He just laid there for a little bit watching Dean sleep, he looked so peaceful when he slept. Sighing, Cas slid out of the bed, careful not to wake his boyfriend and glanced at the alarm clock. '6:30, probably should take a shower' Cas thought to himself quietly opening one of Dean's dresser drawers to grab a pair of boxers and snuck his way to the bathroom.
Dean set a now sleeping Henry in his crib when he felt Cas' arms wrap around him, "you know, he sleeps for about a good hour an half." Cas whispered and started kissing the back and sides of Dean's neck. "Cas." Dean whined and tilted his head to give his mate more access.
I was sitting in my office during lunch trying to go over some paperwork when my phone rang. Looking at the caller id told me that it was the clinic calling so I answered it immediately. "Hello?" "Cas, hi this is Dr. Maddison, you're test results are in, would you like to come in or do you want me to tell you over the phone?" She asked and I quickly decided "over the phone please." I said trying to keep my panic at bay "Your results came back fine, there's nothing to worry about. Like I said at our appointment, it's just a matter of luck. I can give you some medicine to help strengthen the changes of conception if you want."
Dean carried Henry down the stairs and into the kitchen where Cas was forming burger patties. “I see they found you.” Cas grinned.
The next morning everyone was groaning at the light and loud noises as they helped Dorothy pick up the house. Gabe being Gabe saw Dean bending over to pick up a beer bottle so he swung his arm back and smacked Dean's ass making him jump up and his. "What the fuck was that for?!" Dean yelled rubbing his ass slightly and he saw Cas come around the corner. "Oh, ho ho! Cassie did you good!" Gabe snickered and Dean turned bright red, "Gabriel! Fuck off you ass. You're just jealous cause you were the only one who didn't get laid last night." Cas said moving to stand in front of Dean, all of a sudden feeling way more protective of him now. "You okay?" Dean just nodded and buried his nose in Cas's neck finding the comforting smell of alpha. Dean thought it was really weird now that he suddenly had the urge to scent his alpha… Wait, not his, what was he thinking. Dean just sighed and pulled away.
Cas looked up and gave Dean a small smile and patted the spot next to him on the bed. "Yeah, Dean and Henry are here now." Cas said, "tell her I said hi and thank you for the swing." Dean whispered and gently laid Henry on the bed. "Dean says hello and thank you for the swing." Cas relayed, "you're welcome and hello." Cas whispered and started playing with Henry's foot.
“No bud, just you. Aunt Ellen wasn’t special Henry time.” Dean decided to pick Henry up since he was much like his daddy and papa and isn’t a morning person. He carried him to the bathroom and got Henry to go potty before washing his hands and brushing his teeth.
"What the fuck is all the shouting?!" Dean grumbled coming down the stairs thankfully at least in his boxers rubbing his eye. "AW come on! Really! Would it kill you to wear some clothes?" Charlie groaned looking away. "My house, I'll where what I wan red." Dean said sitting down in between me and Charlie and she moved to the chair. "You and Cas may have worked things out but I'm still upset because of what you did Winchester. I will get over it but not today." Charlie said, "how do you know what happened?" Dean asked, "well, Gabriel was watching Mary that night and when I came home I sort of had a break down and told him and his fat mouth told Charlie, so she came over to kick your ass…" I said relaxing back into the couch.
“Oh, it’s okay buddy. I just couldn’t find you and I got scared… You definitely won that round.” Charlie chuckled and kissed the top of his head.
"Wow, are you going to forgive her?" Charlie asked, "I don't know… I mean, yeah it hurts like hell that they kicked me out and that their leaving. But I think what gets me the most is that they wont see Henry grow up." Cas said. The bell rang and the three went to their separate classes and Cas was still stuck on the fact that Henry wont know his grandparents.
By time photography rolled around Dean was excited to see Cas again. He walked in the room and found him sitting at the table already, Dean walked by Bobby's desk and said hello before sitting next to Cas. "Hey." Dean said throwing his bag on the table, "hello Dean." Cas replied with a smile. Before Dean could answer Bobby started talking. "Alright, settle down. Now, if ya'll signed up for the yearbook come over to Dean and Cas's table, the rest of ya, there's a small quiz I want you to take. They're on my desk." Everyone groaned and got up to grab the quiz while two girls and a boy came over and sat at the table.
“I didn’t even realize I did it until it was done. It was like I was on autopilot.” Dean explained. “Also, I don’t know how you’ve slept in here lately. It reeks.”
Cas spaced out for a moment and came back to reality when there was a cup in front of his face, he looked up and saw Ellen holding the cup. "It's coffee, Jo said you liked it black. I figured you need some caffein to get through this." she smiled and Cas accepted the cup, "thank you." he mumbled and took a sip of the hot liquid.
Five minutes later Coach Rufus blew his whistle, "alright ladies! We're done for the day." He called out and everyone grabbed their towels and met the coach in the center of the room. Dean couldn't hear the conversation but he could see everyone nodding every now and then and they were dismissed. Cas walked over to Dean drying his arms in the process. "Hey." he said still a little breathless. "Hey, how was practice?" Dean asked kissing Cas's cheek real quick. "Long. Give me a few minutes and I'll be out." Cas said, "okay, you can shower at my house, so hurry up." Dean winked and Cas just chuckled and walked to the locker room.
“Well that concludes our tour of the campus. Feel free to explore a little bit on your own and we hope you decide to choose us.” The college student giving the tour stated and walked off.
"Oh my god." Charlie whispered, "I-I found him unconscious in the bathroom, Sam called 911 and Mary said if he had been found at least 5 minutes later, we would have lost him." Cas said tears forming in his eyes also. "That's why he wears those bracelets… To hide his scars." Benny said quietly." and Cas just nodded.
"Dean. Dean we need to go get Mary." I said shaking him awake. "Ungh, 5 more minutes." Dean groaned and rolled over, "Dean, come on. It's 10 already, if you get up now, we can take a shower together." I bribed him. It seemed to work, Dean rolled out of bed and walked straight to the bathroom; I laughed at him and followed. A few blow jobs later we were in the Impala heading towards John's; "You know, Mary hasn't seen you since you left for Iowa." I said looking at Dean, "yeah, I know. I miss her like crazy, it's weird not seeing her run around the house singing to Disney." Dean chuckled.
Dean pulled into the driveway and saw a familiar truck in sitting on the side of the road. "Fuck." Dean whispered and got out of the car to try and get Henry inside and lock the door before John could get out of the truck. He got the back door open when Dean heard John's voice, "Dean." he closed his eyes and took a deep breath before turning around, shielding Henry from John's view, "what do you want?" he sighed.
"Dean. Dean wake up." I said and he grunted and buried himself more under the covers, "Dean!" I said louder and contraction hit hard. "Oh god." I groaned "damn it Dean wake up!" I practically shouted and finally Dean woke up, "jesus Cas, it's 1:30, what?!" I couldn't answer right away since I was trying to breath through the contraction, "I need… I need to go to the hospital." I said and then there was a gush of liquid wetting the bed.
"Castiel, sir." Cas introduced, "he's my boyfriend." Dean budged in, "boyfriend?! You don't need a boyfriend, you're already an omega. But I guess that's why this one likes ya… I can already tell he's an alpha." John huffed, "John, that's enough." Mary said firmly. John just rolled his eyes and got up to go to the bathroom, "mom, why is he here? Where's Sam?" Dean asked rushing over to Mary's side.
"Oh, so is it painting? Drawing? What?" Mary asked, "what ever you want. Ms. Barnes wants me to do one of each, I'll start with the painting since that takes longer though." Dean said rolling his sleeves back down. "Oh well, let's go to the mall and we can get you your supplies so you can start." Mary suggested and Dean agreed. "Let me take a shower then we can leave." Dean said and ran up the stairs.
Right as Mary went to help Dean the doorbell rang. "Caaaasssss." Dean moaned and a tear slipped out, "mom, get Cas." he pleaded not knowing why he had the sudden need to have Cas next to him. Mary went to the door quickly, grabbing Lucy on the way to put her outside, as soon as she opened the door, Cas could tell something was wrong.
"Cas, come on we gotta go." Dean said grabbing his elbow, "I don wanna go 'ome." He slurred, "Cas please, you're drunk and Henry wont stop crying." Dean said tugging gently to get him moving. "No not yet." Cas whined. "Ugh, fine. You have exactly one hour left then I'm coming back to get you." Dean said, "kay love youuuuu" Cas grinned and threw his arms around Dean's neck and attempted to kiss him but ended up kissing Dean's chin. "Gross. Love you too." Dean mumbled and wiped off his chin.
"Alright, Anthony. Few house rules. 1. Keep your hands to yourself. 2. Be a perfect gentleman. 3. Have her home by 10 sharp,
"Yeah, let me brush m'teeth first." Dean said and Cas helped him off the floor and flushed away the morning sickness and waited for Dean. Dean crawled back into bed and laid on his back, he felt Cas scoot closer and he flinched a little when Cas pressed a cold hand on his lower abdomen.
"I wont." Dean blushed and jogged inside. Dean stood behind a few people waiting his turn, he felt kinda giddy that Cas hadn't seen him yet. Dean looked around the store after the customer before him left and when he knew it was just him and Cas he leaned up against the counter. Cas had his back turned since he was throwing away receipts, Dean knew this was the time so he pitched his voice as low as he could, "I'd like a pack of menthols and your number sexy." He held his breath trying to keep himself from laughing when he saw Cas stiffen and stand up straight. He carefully reached for the pack of smokes and when he turned around he had a huge blush and looked slightly terrified.
“I’m sure I do, I’ll shower before I get into bed.” Cas set him down and helped Dean get undressed before getting him under the blankets. “I’ll bring you up some water and crackers or something later.” Dean just nodded.
Dean's eyes were wide and he was breathing kinda heavy, "Dean? What's wrong?" I asked getting nervous, "I-I remember. I remember all of the wedding! Every detail." Dean said still breathing heavily. "Oh my god really?! What else?! Do you remember anything else!?" I asked sitting up on my knees and cupped his face with my hands. "No, just the wedding. I remember freaking out so much and then Jess brought in Mary saying you knew I was freaking out and Mary would calm me down. I remember seeing you for the first time when you came dow Bobby's steps. I remember our vows, everything." Dean smiled and I smashed our mouths together and moved to straddle his hips. "Cas, what are you doing?" Dean gasped when we broke apart, "what's it look like?" I said and rolled my hips down causing us both to moan.
"No Cas, that's Star Trek… Okay we're watching Star Wars." Dean said and gently lowered himself to the floor so he could get to the movies. He popped the movie in and sat next to Cas… A lot closer than before but neither of them seemed to notice, or care. "Uh, Dean? Why are we starting with the 4th one? Don't you normally start with 1 when watching a movie series?" Cas asked taking a bite of the pizza.
"So, I was thinking. After dinner we could get out the photo albums and go through them and see if we can't trigger any memories." I said while pulling Missouri's casserole out of the oven. "That sounds like a plan." Dean said not bothering to look up from the puzzle him and Mary were doing on the living room floor. I dished out Mary's plate first and stuck it in the fridge so it would cool off faster and then dished out Dean and I's, "come and eat!" I hollered and Dean carried Mary into the kitchen and put her in the high chair.
They stood there exploring each other's mouths for a while before they moved to the couch. Dean laid down and Cas hovered over him making sure not to touch his side as they made out. They laid there for a while and Dean suddenly pulled away and looked horrified, Cas was confused, did he do something wrong? 'What was going on?' he thought to himself and that's when the smell hit him. Dean was producing slick, "Cas?" Dean croaked, shying away just a little as if he was expecting Cas to jump him; Cas just hid his face in Dean's neck and moaned, "you smell like apples." Cas chuckled and started sucking on Dean's neck making him moan.
10 minutes 3 contractions later, Dr. Maddison finally showed up. "Well, bout time huh? And I'm soooo sorry it took me forever to get here." She said while putting on gloves, "let's see how far you are…. Wow, okay well you're 9 centimeters already. And you got here when?" "Almost half an hour." Dean answered "okay and the contractions are about 5 minutes apart now?" I just nodded too tired to do anything else.
He didn't know how, but he knew something was wrong with Dean. "Hi Cas, um give me just a second, let me put Lucy outside." Mary said and chained Lucy up so she wouldn't run away, "okay follow me. Uh I should tell you, Dean had a small accident. He'll be okay don't worry." Mary reassured him when he saw Cas start to panic, "Lucy just knocked him off his feet and he landed on his bad side, so I need you to help me get him off the floor, he's too heavy for me to get him up and I need you to keep him calm while I check his ribs." Mary said and Cas just nodded and followed her into the house.
Dean slept for almost an hour before Mary came back in with Tessa; "hi Cas." she greeted, "hello." he smiled a little. "Can you do me a favor and wake up Dean? We're going to check to see how far along he is." she said and he nodded. "Dean… Come on baby wake up." he said shaking his shoulder lightly, "hmph." Dean sighed but opened his eyes, "whadda want?" he grumped. "Tessa and your mom are here, they want to check on you." Cas said and sat up with Dean who was rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.
I said sitting down with her. We sat there for almost an hour before Mary came running out of the kitchen, "mama! I made daddy apple pie cuz I know he likes it!" Mary said jumping up and down, "well, I'm sure he'll love it. Now, why don't we go home so we can surprise daddy with the pie and so we can feed Squirt." I said standing up and gave Missouri a hug, "thank you for watching her today." "Oh, honey I'll do it anytime! I love the little bug." She smiled and left "Mary, come here." I said crouching down and whispered something in her ear. She giggled and ran over to Gabe.
Dean put his jacket on and they headed down the stairs. Dean could hear music playing softly outside and he could see that Jo and Ash had shown up and so had Benny. He of course was trying to stay away from Henry so there wouldn’t be a toddler meltdown.
And holy shit, they were good! Cas' voice was deep yet light that gave Dean chills, Sammy's voice was still a little high but it was really good also. He felt proud of his mate and his little brother, he smiled and went back to painting. "Okay, let's go through the opening once or twice then we'll call it a day. Dean come over here please!" Mrs. Rosen called out. "Once upon a time in far off kingdom, there lay a small village at the edge of the woods…" Dean read out. They went through the song once and Mrs. Rosen called everyone out for announcements.
Dean watched the two play for a while and as he watched the more connected he felt to the young omega. It was then, Dean knew what he was going to do with his law suit money.
"Come on, let's get you to the hospital." Dean said starting to stand up, "no! No, just let it pass. We'll keep track of them, if I have anymore in the next hour we'll go." I said easing back into the couch. "Okay, but Cas no hiding it from me either." Dean said and I just nodded. Two hours passed and I had no more contractions, "see, they were just fake." I yawned and to prove my point one of the pups gave a solid kick.
“Sure.” Dean said and got a small piece of pineapple and some rice on the fork and held it out to Henry.
He quickly grabbed his things and ignored all the stares from the other students and made his way to the office. He pushed open the office door, not knowing what was going on, "bout time you got here boy." he heard Bobby's voice so Cas snapped his head up.
“Well then don’t break her heart.” Amelia stated and opened the door. “Claire honey, come on in.” Claire stood up off the front steps and ran in.
A few days had gone by and Dean was feeling much better. Sure he was still upset but he decided to focus on Henry and jump back into searching for a job. He convinced Mary he’d be okay if she went home, so she packed up her things and went home Friday morning after she dropped Henry off at school.
Later that night, after everything was cleaned up, Dean and Cas sat on the couch and were watching a movie when the front door slams open scaring them both.
Dean ripped open the bag, grabbed a few and held it out to Cas who took some. Later in the class Bobby sent Dean down to the office to get more paper for his printer, as he was walking back he almost ran into Alistair. "Why hello Dean." Alistair greeted, "leave me alone." Dean said moving around him and picked up his pace holding the paper closer to him.
Once the washer was started he went downstairs and got on his laptop to look for a job. With no luck Dean groaned and shut the laptop before going upstairs to switch laundry over and go pick up Henry.
They all carefully passed little Henry around when Dean woke up and Mary came in wearing normal clothes. "Alright everyone, time to go home." she said and everyone groaned, "but Charlie and Benny haven't come yet." Cas said, "I know they can visit for a little while but Henry needs to eat." Mary explained and took the baby. Everyone said goodbye and gave both Dean and Cas hugs, "alright Dean, you ready to try and feed him?" Mary asked handing Henry to him. "Yeah, hand me the bottle." Dean said looking up and Mary was just staring at him… "uh honey, it's best, especially since he's a premie, to breast feed." she said and Dean turned bright red.
They got back to Dean's room and Mary and Tessa were waiting. "Ready to go home Dean?" Tessa smiled, "yes and no." Dean mumbled getting out of the wheelchair. "I know you don't want to leave without Henry, but unless something goes wrong, which I highly doubt will, he can go home by the end this week." She said.
“It’s alright we’ll get together some other time.” Benny grinned, said his goodbyes and headed out the door.
"Ohh you do listen to me!" I chuckled, "hey, I listen to you all the time. And when you said earlier about craving them I started craving them, so ta'da!" Dean said and held one up for me. Later on that night Dean and I were on the couch watching some random tv show when a sharp pain rolled through my body, I cried out and hunched forward. "Cas?! Cas what's wrong?!" Dean asked "oh god, I hope these are Braxton hicks!" I moaned and grabbed Dean's arm when another contraction rolled through.
Dean sat there fisting Cas' shirt, and also soaking it with his tears. He took big breaths of Cas' calming scent and he slowly started calming down and he just listened to Cas talk about anything to distract them. "Or think about that time we went to Bobby's for supper, Jo and Ash were there and we pulled that prank on Sam and he screamed and called us all jackasses." That got a watery chuckle out of him and he pulled away from Cas' neck and just stared at him.
He must have fallen back asleep because Cas was shaking his shoulder around 6:30, "why are you on the couch?" he asked quietly, "couldn't sleep, pup was moving too much." Dean yawned and held out his hands for Cas to help him up.
I growled while unbuttoning his jeans. "Fuck." Dean whispered and picked me up so my legs were wrapped around his waist and carried me to the dinning room. Dean put me down once we were in the room and quickly got down to his knees taking all of my length into his mouth; "Fuck!" I yelled gripping Dean's hair as he bobbed his head. Dean stood up and removed his jeans and boxers and pushed me over the table so my ass was facing him, with out any warning he slammed in. "Ah! Fuck. I've missed you." I whimpered, "missed you too Cas." Dean said a little breathlessly.
“No.” Cas growled and grabbed Dean, spun him around and shoved him into the wall and continued to kiss him.
Dean heard rushed whispers coming from backstage so he rounded the corner and stopped in his tracks, Cas had his back to him and he was talking to Amelia. They were whispering about something and they were standing a little too close for Dean's comfort, then Dean's blood ran cold. Amelia swooped in and pressed her lips against Cas' and his hands went to her waist, Dean stormed off and he didn't see Cas push her off him or hear him asking 'what the fuck was her problem and to leave him alone.'
“I love you more.” Dean kissed Henry’s cheek and sent him off with Charlie, who was standing in the door way. She handed Cas the water bottle and took Henry’s hand.
"Damn it Charlie." I sighed and started rubbing the bridge of my nose, "Cassie, please tell me what's going on." Gabe begged. "So much for keeping it secret." I grumbled, "Dean and I have been trying to have another baby and it's not going as well as we planned, so we both have been stressed. I went to the doctor's to see if something was wrong and there wasn't anything wrong and I just hung up with my doctor and she said that there wasn't anything wrong with my blood results. And last night we had a fight and he stormed out and didn't come home." I said slumping back into my chair. "Well Cassie, your heat is coming up soon isn't it?" "Yeah, why?" I asked, "I'm just saying maybe this will be it…" Gabe said quietly and left.
"Cas, Sam. Stay outside the room." Mary said turning back to her son, "but-" "now!" Mary yelled and they both flinched but went outside. 20, very long minutes later, Mary came out of Dean's room. She saw Cas pacing a little down the hall and Sam hand his face hidden in his hands while sitting in a chair. "Cas." she called out and he ran over, "is he okay?" he asked, voice shaking a little. "He's stable. You found him just in time, any longer and we would have lost him." Mary said, her own voice breaking at the end.
He must have lost track of time because the next thing he knew, Sam and Mary were walking through the door. "Dean? Honey shouldn't you be in bed?" Mary asked, "I'm not in heat yet, so I came down here and started painting." Dean said standing up to help his mom with the groceries she brought in, Mary just eyed him suspiciously but let it go. So when Tuesday rolled around and Dean still wasn't in heat, he began to worry a little. 'It's nothing, I'm fine.' he thought to himself and went back downstairs and put in the first Hobbit and snuggled up with Lucy on the couch, he knew his mom had the day off and was spending the day with Ellen, so he knew he had a few hours to himself.
They got back to the living room and talked with Benny and Charlie for a while before Cas started yawning. “I should go.” Benny suggested.
“Love you.” Dean hung up the phone and relayed everything to Cas. He sent a quick text to his mom saying to give him a call when she gets a chance.
When Dean opened the front door he was greeted by Lucy, the 2 year old German Shepherd, "Lucy! How are you girl?" Dean asked grabbing the chord to tie her up outside for a little bit, once inside he threw his bag on the couch and went up to his room. He grabbed his sketch pad and opened to a blank page clear in the back, noting that he'd have to buy a new one soon. He sat in his desk and tried to think of what to draw, before he knew it his hand was flying over the paper, half an hour later he sat back and stared in shock of what he drew.
I said leading her up the stairs. "Okay, these are just some vitamins that I took, and these are the pills to help you with the morning sickness." I said handing her to small boxes. "Thank you, hopefully these work." Amelia said and we headed back downstairs; "there you are, are you ready to go?" Jimmy asked when we walked back to the living room. "Yes, Cas was just giving me some things to help with my morning sickness." She said putting on her jacket, we said our goodbyes and I went back and saw Mary starting to fall asleep on Charlie's lap.
Cas took Henry from Dean and carried Henry up the stairs. Dean sat back down next to Charlie and his phone rang. “Hey Sammy.”
"What's there to talk about? You're starting to ditch your friends, your fucking mate because of some girl." Dean snapped. "That's not true." Cas said offended, "really? Because it seemed like as soon as she sat down, we disappeared Cas." Dean said, eyes becoming wet. "Dean, baby I'm not trying to ignore you guys. I promise… Amelia told me that she really does want to be friends with you and I, all she asks is for a chance." Cas said reaching out to touch Dean's arm but he yanked it away.
"Uh, yeah… I um, I have something to tell you…" Benny started and Cas paused the movie so they could listen. "What did you get Andrea pregnant?" Dean chuckled, and Benny grinned just a little, "no… I um, I'm moving back to Louisiana. Like right after school." Benny said and everyone just stared at him in shock.
“He’s alright. His oxygen is a little low that’s really the only issue, they’re waiting for him to wake up before they look at his lungs.”
"Charlie says good luck and that she loves you… They'll be here after the pup's born." Cas said moving around the bed so he could face Dean. They sat there holding hands when Mary and Tessa came back in, Dean automatically laid back and spread his legs, "oh boy! 8 centimeters! We're almost there!" Tessa grinned and removed her gloves. "I'm assuming the contractions are getting closer together then?" she asked, "oh yeah." Dean sighed and ran a hand over his stomach.
"It's going to be okay, ignore the voice. It's not real, he's gone and I doubt he's going to come back." Cas said still talking quietly, like Dean's therapist told him to, he started rubbing Dean's back; "is the voice gone?" he asked and Dean shook his head and let out a sob.
Cas couldn’t help but feel sorry for his mate as he watched Dean shuffle out of the kitchen. He knows how much his attacks drain him for the rest of the day. Cas put Dean’s container of food in the fridge along with the queso dip. He finished his food as he moved around the kitchen, cleaning up and getting things ready for the pie.
Cas came back out a few minutes later with a tray full of stuff and before they could start a conversation Dean’s phone rang. “Hey Sammy. What’s up?” It was quiet for a few seconds before Dean spoke again, “Sam?”
"Excuse me, Dr. Maddison. Dianna Smith went into labor and she needs an emergency C-section." The nurse said. "Alright, I'll be at the hospital in 10. Cas, I'm sorry, but can we reschedule this to Saturday?" She asked removing her gloves and shutting down the machine. "Yeah, that's fine." I said pulling my shirt down and getting off the table. "Sucks for you Cassie, I got to see my baby boy and you didn't get to see your baby." Gabe gloated on the way to the car. "It's fine Gabriel, really. I know my baby's okay, I don't need an ultra sound to prove it." I said and went to drop Gabe off before heading to the Auto Shop.
"What was that?" She whispered once Dean was back to sleep, "after the accident, he started having really bad nightmares. Nothing would calm him down, until one night Mary came in after a really bad one… Dean was screaming and I couldn't get him to calm down and Mary just started singing it and he instantly calmed down. When I asked her about it she just told me she would sing that to him and Sam when they were little, so now we have the habit of playing it every time we start to sleep and it's helped so far. But every now and then when he has a breakdown the nightmares come back." Cas explained. Charlie just nodded and slowly, glanced over at Benny, surprised he was still snoring and went back to sleep.
I said crouching down to take the towel. Half an hour later we arrived at Bobby's and you could smell the hamburgers and hot dogs cooking on the grill. "Hey boys, hi miss Mary." Ellen greeted us picking Mary up to give her a kiss. "Hi Ellen." Dean and I both said, we followed her to the kitchen to put away the stuff from the store. "Mama?" "Yes Mary?" I asked, "can I swim?" Mary asked giving her attempt at Sam's puppy eyes. "Of course you can sweetie, I got the pool all set up for you." Ellen said grabbing her hand and I handed her the bag with Mary's swimsuit and sunscreen. "Sammy!" I heard Dean yell from outside so I went out to see everyone.
"What is it?" Dean asked starting to worry, "this is going to sound crazy because we've only been dating a month, but I don't know if I can hide it anymore. There's this feeling, that I can't describe, whenever I'm with you, no matter where we are, I feel like I'm home, I'm happy. We-we share a bond, Dean, a bond that I can't explain, and because of that; when we're apart, I miss you, like a lot. And I-I love you Dean." Cas said staring into Dean's now wide eyes.
"New, kid? Tell me bout this new kid Dean." Mary said, "I, um… His name's Cas… He's in my class. We have all but 2 classes together. He's on the swim team, he has an older brother Gabe, he's a senior." Dean said and everyone just stared at him. "What?" Dean asked and tried to shrink into himself, "nothing, you just seem to like this kid." Ellen smiled, "what? Just-just as a friend! He uh, uh…" Dean started panicking and pushed his chair back and ran upstairs into the room him and Sam stay in when they stay the night. 'I knew it! You do like the little guy! And now you're afraid to tell your family because then they'll see how much of a needy little omega you really are.' The voice seemed like it was yelling so Dean put his hands over his ears and curled up in a ball, "shut up! you don't know anything!" Dean said to himself.
Cas stood there wiping away sweat and continued to get his hand crushed, but he didn't care either. He was so proud of Dean at the moment, "keep going baby." he encouraged and they made eye contact, they kept eye contact until there was the smallest, cry Cas had ever heard.
Next monday rolled around and Dean groaned as the stale smell of dried slick filled his nose. He realized that he was still sleeping with Cas's pillow case on his pillow and that he had one of his shirts clutched in his fingers. He tossed the shirt on the ground, grabbed his glasses and made his way to the bathroom. Dean took his glasses off, setting them on the counter ignoring his reflection and got in the shower, he scrubbed his skin with his scent blockers and then scrubbed his hair, erasing all traces of his heat down the drain.
"What is your deal? You've been a real jerk lately. Why?" Dean asked getting tired of Sam's actions. "You want to know why Dean? Because of you." Sam seethed. "W-what?" "My friends, aren't aloud to hang out with me anymore because of you." Sam yelled. "What? Why?" Dean asked, "why do you think?! You're 16 and your pregnant! My friends' parents don't want them hanging out with someone who has a knocked up brother." Sam yelled, "god, how could you be so selfish?! You know Dean there's a thing called a condom, maybe you should learn how to use one." Sam said and stormed off leaving Dean stunned.
“I was silly and fell off the bed. Come here.” Dean said holding out his arms. Henry ran over and fell into Dean’s lap. “I’m sorry I scared you. I just had a really bad dream.
I woke up to the sound of coughing, I sat up and Mary was on her side coughing pretty bad so I pulled her up to a sitting position and started rubbing her back. She quit coughing and snuggled up to me fall back asleep instantly, I looked at the clock and it was 8:30 and Dean was missing. Right as I was about to text him to see where he was he walked through the door with two cups of coffee.
"All right ya idjits." Bobby started and the class quieted down, "I know Christmas break is next week, so since I'm in such a lovable mood, no more assignments until you come back for break, if you're still in the class. Now, for you yearbook people, come over to Dean and Cas' table for the rest of the class." Bobby said and rolled his desk chair over. "Bobby, can I use the bathroom real quick?" Dean asked quietly before everyone came over. "Be quick." Bobby said digging through some files.
Cas woke up to Dean's whispers and slow made his way to the nursery to see if he needed help. Cas stopped in the doorway and felt his heart melt a little at the sight of Dean rocking their pup and nursing him. He stood there for a few minutes just staring before he spoke up. "Dean?" he whispered from the doorway, Dean looked up and smiled, "it's okay Cas. Go back to bed, I've got it." he whispered and Cas watched him turn his attention back to Henry.
Cas was snapped back into attention when Rufus told them to pick a lane and do 5 front stroke laps and 5 back stroke. Cas immediately took the lane closest to Dean, Dean smiled at him and gave a brief wave so Cas winked and dove in beginning his laps. Cas loved swimming, it cleared his mind and challenged him to push his personal best every time.
Once Henry was changed, Dean picked him up and held him in the air, causing him to giggle, "do you like that?" Dean smiled and did it again, "he's going to puke on you if you don't stop." Cas chuckled, "I know." Dean sighed and passed Henry to Cas. "I'm gonna go see if Sammy will watch him for a while." Dean said and kissed Cas real quick before heading upstairs.
“Because I want to. So, shut up and deal with it.” Dean replied. “Do you really not want to spend time with me? Because Mom can still take you.”
Once they were done eating Henry wanted to play outside. “Just for a little bit you still need to take a nap.” Dean told him.
Once Henry was situated in his swing from Cas' mother he found a re-run of Dr. Sexy and kept the volume low and sat close to Cas and started eating. They ate in silence and once they were done, Dean decided to do a little bit of laundry. The only downside of moving to the basement is that he had to carry everything upstairs, he had already washed their sheets and Henry's crib sheets so he gathered his and Cas' clothes and trudged up the stares.
Dean was lost for words, he knew that he loved Cas more than anything, but hearing it, made everything real. "Dean? God, please say something." Cas said and Dean could smell the fear coming from Cas, he lunged forward pressing his lips against Cas's and pulled away. "I love you too." He smiled, "now let's get ready."
Cas walked out of the cafeteria and headed towards Bobby's room, "Cas, wait!" Amelia called out chasing him down the hall, "look I'm sorry, I do want to be friends and I hope Dean can give me a chance." she said quietly, "I'll talk to him, just give us a few days." Cas said and continued walking down the hall.
Dean said and hung up, placing his phone on the table and started laughing. "What's so funny?" Cas asked, "at least my mom has better timing!" Dean choked out and Cas started laughing with him, "yeah she does."
Dean pulled into a spot that was open next to Cas’ suburban and texted him. He shut the impala off and got out when he saw Cas walking up.
Dean wished Cas was with him right now, it was crazy how close they've gotten over the course of just one week. Dean felt like he could tell Cas anything and he felt safe. Sure he had been ashamed when he saw his scars, but Cas didn't shy away, he supported Dean and told him it was going to be okay. And for that, Dean knew that he was falling for the blue eyed boy.
“It’s alright.” Mary chuckled, “you take these. Put the salad in the fridge and the pie on the counter.”
"Cassie." Gabe whimpered. "How did you do this? It fucking hurts!" Gabe said wincing as another contraction rolled through his body. "It'll be worth it once Alex gets here." I said and sat in the chair next to him and Dr. Maddison came in. "Hello Gabe, now, I know you're a month early, but you've had a good pregnancy all through, so I have a good feeling that everything will be fine. Alex will probably have to be in the NICU for a while." She explained and Gabe just nodded. "Let's see how far you are… Well you 9 centimeters already, it shouldn't be too long. I'll go prep and get the rest of the nurses and by time we get back you should be ready to push." Dr. Maddison said and threw away her gloves.
"I got it!" he yelled and walked towards the door and swung it open. "Hey Cas." Dean smiled, and Cas just stared at him, "hi." Cas smiled also, "here, come in." Dean said and moved out of the way. "Thank you." "Uh pizza should be here soon." Dean said and took Cas's jacket to hang up in the closet. "Come on, my mom wants to meet you." Dean said and Cas followed.
"How bad do those hurt?" Sam asked, "ugh, just be glad you'll never have to find out." Dean panted and accepted the cup of ice chips from Jo. The three left an hour later when Mary came back in saying that they should give Dean some time to rest. She checked Dean's iv and the chart, monitoring the pup; "how are you feeling?" she asked after she wrote everything down.
"Now, if we're lucky we might be able to see the gender, do you want to know?" "Yeah." Gabe replied studying the screen. "Congratulations Gabriel, looks like a healthy baby boy." Dr. Maddison smiled and Gabe had tears in his eyes "Cassie, look." A few minutes late Gabe was sitting in the chair with his ultra sound picture and I laid back on the table, Dr. Maddison was about to put the gel on my stomach when there was a knock on the door.
Back at school Cas felt all giddy inside for his date tonight with Dean. So, by time Algebra II rolled around Cas was more than excited to talk to him, but when he got in the room Dean was no where to be found. 'He's probably just late to class…' Cas thought to himself, he just sat there waiting for Dean to walk through the door. He overheard a few people talking behind him, "yeah, I heard that one of the teachers had to take him to the hospital…" one girl said, "yeah, but they were an omega right? Does it really matter?" a guy said and Cas suddenly became very angry and slightly worried, how could that jack ass talk about an omega like they're a pice of trash?
Sam met them in the living room, "what was all the yelling about?" he asked and then gasped when he saw Cas carrying the car seat, "oh wow! He's here!" Sam said, "yeah, we're going to head downstairs, Sammy finish the dishes please." Dean said and followed his mate and son down the stairs.
“Let’s go. I want to stop by the mall real quick and get some paint supplies and a new sketch book.”
"Whyyyy" Charlie goaded, "reasons." Dean said quietly. "Uh uh brother. You started it, you gotta finish it." Benny said and Charlie agreed. "Uh…" Dean started "please tell me you two didn't have sex on the first date!" Charlie said, "no! Charlie, keep it down." Dean said eyes wide and he pushed up his glasses. "We just… kissed." Dean hesitated, "ohh really…" Charlie teased "why'd you hesitate." Benny added. "We made out okay?!" Dean shouted and slapped his hand over his mouth.
'You know what to do Dean, write a little note and tell everyone you're sorry then just end it.' 10 minutes later, Dean was in the bathroom and he placed the note on the sink where it would be easier to see and sat on the floor.
"Cas…" Dean moaned thrusting his hips up lazily, "shh, I got you baby. Just let go." Cas whispered and twisted his wrist at the tip and Dean came with a gasp, "fuck, fuck Cas." he stuttered and Cas helped him through the orgasm. "The water's all gross now." Dean said frowning and Cas laughed, "I know, let's get out and watch that movie." he said getting out first, wrapping a towel around his waist before helping Dean out. "Nah, I'd rather lay on the couch and make out." he grinned and quickly dried off before walking into their room to grab a pair of boxers.
“That’s alright I’m on patrol today I’ll just stop somewhere.” Cas said before disappearing into the bathroom to brush his teeth.
Hey guys, I know this is a short one but I wanted to get something out here for you. I think there's going to be one more chapter left! And I do have lines from the movie that will be in italics! ENJOY! <3
I said putting her down, "okay mama." Mary said and ran off. "Cas? Is something wrong?" Missouri asked looking worried, "no, nothing's wrong." I smiled a little. "Then why did you go a little pale when I asked about your date?" Missouri asked, "okay, I'm going to tell you something that no one else in the family knows…" I said quietly, "okay honey, your secret is safe with me." Missouri said coming over to sit next to me on the couch. I looked up and saw Mary playing with the doll John gave her for her birthday and I got a little teary eyed, "Dean and I are trying to have another baby." I said quietly, "oh sugar, that's wonderful!"
“That went well also. Everything looks okay and we should be in the clear for sex next week. She said to maybe hold off another couple weeks before we start trying again… Which I kind of want to wait until we’re married.” Dean explained.
Mary went to hand Dean the wipe but stopped when she saw her son's eyes clenched shut, "Dean? Are you okay?" She asked and Tessa just handed Mary the picture and left the two, Dean shook his head no and took in a shaky breath. It was real, this was actually happening. 'I'm 16 years old and I'm going to be a parent.' he thought to himself and he felt the first hot tear roll down his cheek. He hated that he was crying so much lately, normally it took a lot for him to break down.
"Gabe, calm down okay. They're probably just Braxton Hicks… I get them all the time. They're just false contractions. But stay in here and we'll monitor them. How long have you been having them?" I asked "uh, I had one about half an hour ago then just now." Gabe said "okay, here go sit in my chair, it's more comfortable." I said and helped him up. Right as Gabe stood he froze, "shit." he whispered and looked down. I followed his gaze and saw that his jeans were now wet, "Gabe, did your water just break?!" I asked.
"How come you can use the bathroom whenever but when I asked the other day I couldn't leave?" Lisa complained, "because you don't have a baby kicking your bladder." Dean scowled and walked out. "Yeah, because I know how to use a condom." she huffed under her breath, and Cas growled "Lisa, Crowley's office. Now." Bobby said sternly, "what? Why?!" She yelled, "because I don't take bullying in this class." Bobby said narrowing his eyes, "yeah, you're just saying that cause he's your nephew." Lisa argued crossing her arms. "I'm not joking, office. Now." Bobby said again standing up to lead her down to Crowley's office.
"Yes. Oh my god Cas! I can't have Alex now! He's a month early!" Gabe said starting to panic and Jimmy just stood there in shock. "Okay, okay. Relax, Jimmy can you take us to the hospital? I can't fit behind the steering wheel." I said and he shook out of his daze, "yes, of course." he said and ran out of the office to pull his car up to the curb. "Cassie! I can't! It's too early!" Gabe said. "I know, everything will be okay just breath." I said and lead him out of my office, luckily no customers were in the bakery at the time so it wasn't too awkward.
"Good, now we can set up the baby shower!" Charlie said clapping her hands together. "How about next Saturday?" She asked, "that's not a lot of time for people to go shopping red." Benny pointed out, "I agree, how about the third saturday of February?" Cas suggested, "I like that idea, that way we can figure out what exactly we need." Dean said.
"Okay Mary, daddy's gonna be gone for awhile. Can you be a good girl for mama?" Dean asked and Mary tilted her head a little "yes daddy." Dean came over to me "I'm really sorry Cas. I'll see you in a few days." Dean said and gave me a quick kiss. Once Dean was out the door I sighed and put my head on my arms. "Mama?" I heard Mary's small voice so I looked up, "your father irritates me." I sighed and took a drink of my coffee, "no mama." Mary giggled.
Dean walked Henry up to his classroom like he did every time, “have a good day at school, I’ll pick you up in a few hours.”
Cas quickly changed and crawled into the bed with Dean, who was on his side staring into the bassinet, "I can't believe that he's really here." Dean whispered, "I know, me neither." Cas whispered back and kissed the back of Dean's neck. "I love you." he heard Dean whisper, "I love you too." Cas whispered back and let his exhaustion take over.
He blew through the living room causing Lucy to bark and chase after him, Dean ignored his mom when she asked where the fire was and bolted down the stairs. "CAS!" Dean said trying to catch his breath. "Dean?! What's wrong?" Cas asked standing up to get closer to Dean, "prom night…." Dan wheezed, "yeah, what about it?" Cas asked getting confused. "W-we had sex for the first time since Henry was born." Dean continued to wheeze, Cas chuckled a little, "yes Dean… We did, and it was great." Cas said, still confused to where this was going.
"Hi honey! Happy Birthday!" Mary said giving Dean a hug and kissed his cheek when they came into the room for the ultra sound. "Thanks mom." "Are you guys going to find out the gender?" Mary asked helping Dean on the table. "Yeah." Cas replied moving to sit on the little stool by the table. Tessa came in and went through the usual routine with Dean, blood pressure, blood sample, temperature measuring his stomach. "Well Dean, you're certainly getting bigger." she smiled and he just looked down at his now bare stomach and smiled.
Dean watched Cas go into the bathroom and winced, not realizing he was scratching his scars and had scratched a little too hard. He threw a shirt on and woke Henry up to get him in a bath and dressed for the day. Deciding to leave the guest bathroom open in case Charlie needed it, he carried Henry into their bathroom. “Water might get funky. I’m going to fill the tub up for Henry.” Dean warned Cas.
People say finding your true mate is like wishing your whole life you'll meet your favorite celebrity. Maybe you'll meet them, but it's more likely that you wont. If you do find your true mate, it'll take years, and when you do, it's in the most unexpected place. For this case, it was practically love at first sight, when green eyes met the bluest eyes, he felt something connect but didn't know quite yet what it meant.
"Hi boys." Tessa smiled coming into the room, "hi." Dean and Cas answered at the same time, "well Dean 3 months in, how do you feel?" she asked. "Good, no more morning sickness, thank god." Dean chuckled, "that's good, are any cravings kicking in?" she asked getting a few things ready. "Oh god yes." Cas said making a face, Tessa started laughing, "I'm assuming you got some pretty weird ones." she said.
"Cas! Help me get the paintings in the Impala so they don't get messed up!" Dean hollered from the study upstairs, he was dressed and ready to go to the art show. It was now 3 and he needed to be there at least by 3:45 so he could find Ms. Barnes and Ms. Holt before the show started at 5.
Right off the living room was a big bathroom with double sinks a walk in glass shower and a separate tub, next to the bathroom was the master bedroom with a king sized bed already in, with two dressers and two separate closets. "Oh my god, this is huge!" Cas said looking around the room, it was painted in a soft dark cream color. Next was a medium sized room, "ooh, this can be the nursery Cas!" Dean said pulling Cas in further into the room. "The crib can go here," Dean said pointing to the wall, "a-and the changing table can go here." he said gesturing to the opposite wall.
"Mom, there's something I wanted to ask you." Dean said quietly and gestured for Cas to come sit by him, "what's that?" Mary asked sitting on the edge of her chair. "Well… You said, that Cas needed to claim me as soon as possible.. And I-we were wondering if we could have the house to ourselves saturday night?" Dean asked a small blush crawling up his cheeks. "Hmm. I suppose that would be alright… I have the night shift saturday and sunday so I'll just crash at Bobby and Ellen's and Sam can stay there also, we can take Lucy." Mary said standing up, "alright, I'm off to work, I'll see you tomorrow Dean, and you too Cas." she smiled and left.
want Cas seeing his scars yet, "I'm sorry honey but yes, it will make things so much easier." She said but leaned in and whispered in his ear, "if this is about your scars, Dean I've seen the way Cas looks at you honey. He's not going to go running for the hills." She pulled away and wiped a few of the tears running down Dean's face and he just sucked in a shaky breath and glanced at Cas before letting Mary help him out of his shirt.
He quickly got dressed for school and found Cas upstairs with Sam. "Hey, happy birthday." Cas said getting up, wrapping his arms around Dean's middle and planted a wet kiss against his lips. "Hey… Thank's for the present and the card… It was awesome." Dean said kissing Cas again. "Okay quit. I'm tryin' to eat over here." Sam groaned, the two split apart and Cas pushed Dean into one of the island chairs and pulled a warm plate out of he oven filled with pancakes bacon and eggs, he then put a big glass of milk in front of him. "Happy Birthday Dean." Sam said, "thank's Sammy."
Dean got in the Impala and headed towards the middle school to pick up Sam. When Dean pulled up to the curb Sam was waiting but didn't get in. Dean leaned over and rolled down the window, "what? Are you waiting for me to get out and open your door for you princess?" he teased. "Not funny Dean. I just wanted to let you now I'm going to Andy's for a while, I called mom and she's fine with it." Sam said, "fine but don't forget we're going to Bobby and Ellen's tonight. I'll pick you up at 5:30." Dean said and drove off, actually kind of glad he was going to be alone.
Dean was cleaning his camera when Cas nudged him with his foot. Dean looked up and pushed his glasses up, "what?" he whispered. "What are you doing friday night?" Cas whispered back. "Nothing. Why?" Dean asked eyebrows squishing together. "Well, I think it's pretty obvious that I like you… And uh, I was wondering if you wanted to hang out… Maybe go grab a burger or something." Cas suggested and rubbed the back of his neck and Dean turned a shade of red, "y-you want to go out wi-with me?" Dean stuttered.
“Something isn’t sitting right with me. Why does Henry have your phone and a bowl of grapes when he should be eating supper?”
Bobby choked on his water and Ellen thumped him on the back while Dean buried his face in his hands.
“I’m okay! Please, just eat the pie so I can give Henry his bath before bed.” Dean pleaded. Everyone left Dean alone in the kitchen and silently moved back to the dining room.
Cas collapsed onto the bed once he was done, his knot still swollen, “give me a second then I’ll get a towel.”
Once the twins were fed all four of us headed upstairs, "Mary go brush your teeth, I'll be in your room in a minute to tuck you in." I said heading towards the nursery. "Mama I'm not tiiirreeeddd! I wanna play with Henry and Lily!" Mary whined. "Mary Elizabeth! It is passed your bed time. Now get in there, brush your teeth and go to bed!" Dean yelled and Mary instantly went quiet and tears filled her eyes and she ran to the bathroom.
They stood in the middle of the kitchen holding each other, not even caring that Sam and Mary could see them. "I'm sorry about the Impala by the way… Do you know who did it?" Cas asked once they broke apart to get pizza. "No. It was already done by time I left the school." Dean said grabbing a glass of water. "What happened to your car honey?" Mary asked, "someone wrote slut on the back window today while I was at the yearbook meeting." Dean explained.
"Well, you could ask Jess on a date, but meet her parents before hand and explain the situation to them." Cas suggested, "then if they don't like it then they can tell you yes or no." he continued, "okay, thanks Cas!" Sam grinned and wrapped his arms around his waist, stunning him a little but returned the hug. "Sam?" "Yeah Cas?" he asked pulling away, "why come to me and not your brother?" he asked, "oh, well… Dean's under a lot of stress lately that he's trying to get rid of… So I just didn't want to bother him with it…" "Oh, well I'm glad that you can trust me enough to come to me with your problems." Cas smiled a little "of course I can Cas, you're my brother now." Sam said and walked away.
"Oh sorry." Sam said and started to turn when he saw blood on the sink, "wait. Dean is that blood?!" Sam asked running over, "it's fine Sam just a paper cut." Dean said moving away from his brother. "On your arm?" Sam asked, damn him for being so observant. "Dean what's going on?" Sam asked and Dean could smell worry and fear filling the room. "Sam, please. Just go back to your room." Dean pleaded.
