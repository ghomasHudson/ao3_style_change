Cas pulls out various cards they exchanged, including the one he drew for Dean their first Christmas together. Every year, they’d pick out ornaments for each other as gifts and every single one was inside: a miniature Chevy Impala, an infinity symbol carved out of wood that Dean hand crafted, an ornament from one of their trips to Mustang Island, another from Arizona when they had gone to Spring Training. There’s around ten ornaments in the box, every one of them lovingly hand wrapped in tissue, kept safe for the last ten years.
, Karamo! Our friends get an outside look at this potential relationship that we could be totally blind to, so it never hurts to ask!” Antoni beams back at him and holds up his cup.
“You are,” Charlie agrees. “You almost had sex on the sidewalk this morning.” She’s laughing again.
Castiel’s not sure which of them sets the pace as they leave the patio, but it’s not fast, almost so they can take their time strolling down the middle of the street. Holding hands.
Sam is already distracted by his phone, his eyes lighting up when Jess answers. He nods and waves Dean away as he leaves the room to talk. Dean uses the ensuite bathroom to wash his face and text Cas to let him know he’s on his way over to the hotel.  All the families are driven back to the band’s hotel after the show so Dean knows Cas is already waiting for him there. His dick gives an interested twitch when Dean takes a few minutes thinking about what they might get up to tonight. It becomes even more interested when Dean remembers the photo he sent Cas before the show.
“Fine. We’ll do it your way.” Sam gives him a wry smile. “Jess will be happy to hear it.”
Dean stacked their empties while she was away so thankfully there’s somewhere she can put the tray down, only spilling all the little shot glasses a little when she does it, finishing her humiliating song with a flourish before she
Dean tugs on his hand. “What did I say? Was it because I mentioned Facebook? I know, I hate it too, but being away from Sam—”
Sure enough, after Castiel’s pulled on his coat and locked the door behind him, Dean’s there waiting when Castiel reaches the bottom of the red wooden staircase, and he’s already leaning down on one knee to greet a very excited piglet who wiggled out of Castiel’s arms before the last few steps, which he mostly jumped down. He’s getting braver about the stairs, as the days pass.
The commercial fades away as Cas goes back to home plate and with the words of his mother echoing in his ears, Dean focuses on his final task.
Cas hasn’t missed one of those since they’ve been together and Dean talks about her sometimes, so it’s not like he doesn’t know Mary, but this is different to Dean.
“Anyone we know?” He asks, gesturing towards the television. After the first pick, twenty-one more teams had to choose players and now that the first round is over, the station is on commercials before round two starts.
kissing his boyfriend so he’s gotta get off the phone.
“Say it again, Cas.”
Castiel ducked, a little smile playing over his lips. He looked up at Dean through his lashes. “I'm named after an angel. The Angel of Thursday. My mom named all of us after different angels, but my name is definitely the weirdest.”
Staring into his beautiful, emerald eyes, Castiel knows he’s ready for anything with Dean by his side. He nods.
Dean goes to his knees and admires the curve of Cas’ ass peeking out of the bottom of the skirt, part of it rucked up from Dean’s hands. He leans in and pushes the skirt up to nip at Cas’ round ass cheek, Cas sucking in a sharp breath above him. His hands drift down Cas’ legs and over the boots, Cas’ calves firm inside them. He kisses the art on Cas’ thighs before he drags down the zipper on the back of each boot, putting a steadying hand on Cas’ hip to help him step out of them.
“Technically they aren’t spaghetti noodles. I’m making tagliatelle.”
“Copies of public records and notices are available at the library,” Sarah said politely. “You can look there.”
Turned around and stopped dead in his tracks, because Cas? Cas was wearing a
The service was on their second day in Kansas. There was a stream of people from Caroline who came to pay their respects. Luc thought it was morbid curiosity about the old lady’s house rather than any genuine caring. Castiel wasn’t so sure, but then he spent most of the time either in the turret room or out in the gazebo rather than interacting, so how would he know? Being around that many strangers wasn’t an option. Gabriel brought him a plate from the food people had brought, some sort of rice and hamburger dish, another with odd cylindrical diced potatoes --
“Sam going to make it up for Christmas?”
“Are you mad?” Castiel exclaimed. “You cannot possibly believe in magic.  It is the stuff of fairytales and the beliefs of uneducated people. We know better now than we did in the dark ages. There is no such thing as magic. There is science, and there is art. But legends are just that… legends, with phenomena that can be explained through logic and science.”
“Many copies,” Cas corrected helpfully, gesturing towards the opened box currently resting in one of the window seats.
“Probably not.”
“Agreed.”
“Some. Not as much as I wish I did right now. Bobby, and now Sam, have made it their life’s work to study dragonkind. To find out the truth, rather than just the carefully cultivated image that Lord Michael presents. I mean, Michael’s rule isn’t really awful, not really. It’s just…” He shrugged helplessly.
there?”
“Yes, Dean. This is very much okay.”
“Cas.” He reached out, managed to catch Cas’ shirt in his fingers but couldn’t get a good grip. They fell away as the other man eased back and stood again.
“Yeah, but that would mean I’d have to learn how to play golf well enough to kick his ass. And also that I’d have to spend more time with him. Do they have target shooting?”
After dinner, the girls eventually settled down again to play in Emma’s room, while Dean and Cas sat with a glass of brandy each in the living room.
Then again, writing wasn’t always easy either. Sometimes he just couldn’t find the right way to say something. He knew what he wanted to accomplish, and where he wanted to go. But sometimes the phrases, the sentences, the paragraphs, were impossible to arrange into meaningful patterns.
It didn’t take long to locate Cas, not when he’d just happened to check the security cameras in the control center to figure out where he was. He walked up to where he was working on some huge thing. What the hell was that, anyhow? It was a wire support that spiraled from the ground up about twenty feet, with strings of lights wound about it, and hundreds of small tubes fastened to the wire grid.
“They really are,” Cas agreed, nodding. “I find it remarkable how they manage to find just the right plants to accomplish the effects they want. Putting rules and limits can really encourage some remarkable feats of creativity.”
It seemed to take forever before he heard the sirens in the distance, but then suddenly Sheriff Mills was there, cuffing the man. Cas stood up, stumbling slightly at stretching his muscles after being so tense.
Dean opened the box more fully, pulling out more books before Cas realized his intention. “Tolkien, George R.R. Martin, Anne Bishop — haven’t read her stuff but I’ve intended to — Steven Emmanuel? Dude! You’ve got awesome taste in books.”
“Not that long,” Dean said. “Didn’t want to interrupt you.”
Dean can’t help but smile against Cas’ mouth, laughing in joy before he lifts his hands from Cas’ knees to wrap one arm around his waist, bringing the other up so that he can curl his palm around Cas’ neck, holding him in place while he deepens the kiss, turning it from a fragile, tender thing into something deeper, fuller, richer.
It didn’t matter.
Maybe, if he was lucky, the whole Bela thing would just go away as though it had never happened.
Dean nods at that. He knows Chuck and Becky fairly well, and he’s at least met all three of Cas’ siblings at some point or another.
Cas sighed, straightened his napkin on his lap before meeting Dean’s gaze. “Policies aren’t about individual cases, Dean. They’re about creating a fair workplace. Whether or not Jerry and Mildred are capable of maintaining a workplace relationship without impacting the organization isn’t the point.”
Castiel studies her face but nods his assent.
“Oh my god, you’re the worst!”
Thundering cheers surround Dean as euphoria and relief overtake him, his arms going up into the air in victory and disbelief, and while every emotion Dean's ever felt goes through him, he looks toward what he knows is real. Cas, throwing off his catcher's mask and running towards him is real and it’s like time slows down to a crawl, and he can only think of one thing.
that are so goddamn nice; his fingers long and pressing and quick to open Dean’s pants when he pushes Dean down onto his bed. The addicting smell of him is headier here, and fuck, Dean’s drunk on him. On Cas.
.・。.・゜✭・.・✫・゜・。.
“It was very nice, thank you,” Castiel cuts Gabriel off. “Did all of the cows survive their emergency?”
Gabriel shakes his head and slides off his barstool. “I need some air.”
Cas still has disbelief all over his face. “You want to drive to Vegas… and get married? To me?”
OMG look at that art! Ok, I really hope you enjoyed this little AU I created for them because I really enjoyed writing it! Please let me know what you thought and come say hi on
“Oh yeah? I have a picture from every single one of your first days of school, what makes you think your first day of college is gonna be any different, boy?” Ellen shot him the
in between kisses and a hug that tweaks his ribs.
So, he has to be confident for both of them.
“Is the room to your liking, Mr. Milton?”
Cas is halfway out the window, horror etched across his face when Mary pulls him back inside and wraps him in her arms. He sobs and she rocks him back and forth as Dean rests his head against Cas’ shoulder. Mary wraps an arm around him too and rubs circles into Dean’s back while she whispers comforting words to both of them.
Castiel hates every minute spent and every single word said. He hates the way Jimmy tries to stay stoic, the way the light leaves his eyes as Castiel tells the story of their parent’s demise, even as his own heart aches. He hates that he has to be the one to do this, hates that this is the way Jimmy has to find out the worst parts of their past.
Dean laughs the loudest when Castiel emerges with the bee shirt on under a black blazer with a pair of tailored pants and a pair of black boots.
There’s no hesitation between them anymore, both sure of the other's body almost as well as they know their own. The hours Dean has spent mapping Cas’s amazing curves are uncountable and he doesn’t hesitate to start the process all over again, any chance he gets.
Draping his arms open, Dean settles and keeps his eyes trained on Cas, raising an eyebrow as Cas makes another show of climbing back on the bed, the strong muscles in his arms flexing, the devilish look back in his dark blue eyes that tells Dean he's about to have his world rocked.
“Can I use my key and come to the door?” Dean nudges Castiel’s cheek with the tip of his nose before brushing a kiss along his jaw, leaving behind sparks, Castiel’s sure of it.
anyone flowers either.
Dean knew he was going to ask, the second he asked the question himself but he still finds himself choking on the reality of the words.
As the night got later, their fight lost steam and the regret started to sink in and it didn’t take long until they both gave in to their exhaustion and the complete sorrow they were both feeling, thinking this was the end. They laid on the floor together next to the flipped coffee table Dean had kicked over in a rage, hours before.
The concern in Cas's bright blue eyes gives way to hunger before he's rolling them away. “At this rate, I'm wondering if we'll ever make it home.”
“You smell like sex.” Another sniff makes Dean side step away from Meg. “Expensive sex.”
“Cas is here and, according to Dean, has no idea you guys are coming to get him today.” She nods at Karamo who holds open the door for them. He loops his arm through Bobby’s as they walk down the hallway of the school, following behind Jo. Their steps and voices echo, all of them dropping lower in the quiet sanctuary. They pass by rows of lockers and various wooden doors, all decorated differently, all welcoming the students back to the new school year.
“What the fuck.”
Dean paces. He’s usually good at making decisions but when he can’t quite decide, he paces. It used to drive Lisa crazy, Sam too, but Dean has found that when he’s idle, his thoughts race and he has trouble focusing.
(See the end of the chapter for
“He’s being unreasonable! First, it was about visiting you in Washington and going to that creative writing workshop at the college, remember?”
Dean nods. “I’ll make a fire.”
“I'm fine, mama. Really.” Dean flattened the box that held his plates and bowls. “Just ready to be done here.”
Castiel greets him with two of the
“Charlie didn’t tell you?”
He hooks two fingers under the band to pull them down, Cas’ thick cock springing free and bobbing between them. Dean licks his lips and Cas moans when Dean presses them to the head of his cock. He looks up to find Cas staring, his chest heaving and his bottom lip clamped between his teeth.
Come say hello on
The disappointment on her face is clear.
It wasn’t until Dean returned to Lawrence that their improved communication skills ended up making them that much better on the field, too, which translated into a lot of attention when it came time for the scouts to come looking for talent. Thanks to the incredible athletics program they were in, scouts knew that KU was going to deliver talent but a well-placed phone call on their behalf brought to town the woman that changed both their lives.
By the time Dean comes out, people are dancing and he makes a
Dean’s been writing songs for their third studio album for a while now. Sam’s right, he wants to start recording but so soon after the tour? Dean’s afraid of burning out. At least that’s his story, and he’s sticking to it. Dean knows a few weeks off won’t kill them. He’ll post some selfies on Instagram and call it a day.
The only thing he needs to do is get these last three outs.
Dean grins and in no time, they’ve killed an hour or two and a few rounds, their booth littered with empty pint glasses and two spent plates of nachos. They’re both tipsy enough to lose at pool but neither of them care when they slide into their seats.
Dean snorts. “Does she look like my girlfriend?”
“Babe? Real quick…” Turning back towards him, Castiel tilts his head in confusion but Dean is all smiles and very quickly, Castiel realizes why.
“She was always there, swapping out books. She used to read to her stomach. It’s no wonder Jack loved reading so much. I’m not sure about these days, though.”
“Don’t go,” Castiel murmurs into his ear. “Take me into your office and fuck me instead.”
Dean climbed into the Impala and headed to the school, picking up a cord of firewood on the way. Cas was waiting outside their dorm, a duffle in one hand, an ice chest in the other, and Dean's guitar case at his feet. As Cas slid all of it into the backseat, Dean jumped out and walked around the car, opening Cas’ door so he could climb in. By the time Dean got back in, Cas was leaning over to kiss him.
“As much as I love your ass in those, I thought I asked you to be naked.”
“Fuck, ow,” Dean groans and rubs the back of his head. “It hurts to laugh.”
The Lasso of Truth hangs from Cas’ hip.
“Hey, Cas, you okay?”
“Of course, Dean,” he answers, taking Dean’s hand again as he stands beside him. Cas stays silent while Dean tells his mom everything, about the draft, about Cas and how they met and how it’s changed him, Cas only sniffling occasionally, or huffing out small laughs that keep Dean going. He thanks her; for the car, for the ring, and for the ability to be himself and know it’s okay, knowing she’d still love him no matter what.
Strong hands roam across his chest, Cas’ long fingers stroking Dean’s skin, skimming over his nipples with an occasional lingering touch. One hand slips under Dean’s arm and curls around his ribs possessively. Eventually they’re just brushing their mouths together for the comfort of each other and Cas is the first to pull away.
“He got it a little dirty after he got down on some roasted sweet potato they had samples of and I took it off him, thinkin’ I could get the stains out.” Dean folds the little onesie and puts it off to one side. “Turns out, sweet potato and white cotton do
possible chores that could be done by a robot and before the day’s done, Jack’s asking Cas when they can visit Dean’s house so he can see Dean’s workshop.
“I think you should tell him to fuck off.” Jo crossed her arms and stared Dean down. Dean clenched his jaw and stared right back.
“Don’t thank us, you’re the one who got us here,” Bobby advises. “You did this for Cas, don’t forget that.”
Their Friday nights bleed into long weekends and neither of them mind. However after this morning class, they won’t see each other much all week until Friday night. Dean looks forward to Friday nights almost as much as he hates Monday mornings and having to watch Castiel leave him.
Castiel chuckles. “She’ll be expecting us to pull out all her hex bags so she can refresh their spells.”
the word
He doesn’t fight his smile at the sight of Cas tucking his phone into his jacket pocket, his head bent down. He’s so handsome—not the teenage boy Dean remembers but a man, all sharp lines and stubble Dean wants to feel on the inside of his thighs.
People keep showing up to help. Castiel’s sure he’s never seen Ash as much as he has recently, the man coming and going at all hours helping Dean with anything he needs. Bobby is in and out a lot, at first just to oversee the construction and then after, to visit with Dean while he painted, under the guise that he was helping. When it comes time to stock the store, Bobby shows up every day to help with alphabetizing and to keep everyone else on task by barking gruff orders at them when he notices them slacking.
“What if I run out of post-its?”
“Does the profile say how long they’ve been married?” Bobby jokes, making the other guys laugh.
She stays silent until she joins him, a towel in her hand to help him dry. It’s not until Castiel passes her the first dripping plate and she puts it on the rack, do the floodgates open.
Dean chuckles and pulls out a pair of white angel wings and Castiel almost drops the cat.
“You love me, Cas,” Dean laughs and kisses the apples of Castiel’s cheeks, making them burn. “I just can’t believe it.”
“To Bobby or to the car?”
“I don't even want to know.” Castiel raised an eyebrow and Dean's stomach flipped over. He put down the book he was reading and scooted to the edge of the bed, holding his arms open and making little grabbing motions with his hands. That got a smile out of Cas, and he crossed the room to straddle Dean's lap.
“Oh yeah?” Dean’s mouth curves into a wide smile. “Cool, thanks, kinda hoped you would.”
“What was that, Dean?” Sam asks, his voice tinny over the speakerphone.
He doesn't want to talk about how long it's been since he got laid, though.
“Hurry up, you guys!”
at Cas across the room.
Sam makes an exasperated noise in the back of his throat as he turns onto a road Dean didn’t even notice. “It's not a cult, Dean, how many times do I have to tell you that?”
“Okay, it’s really two things, but I kept forgetting to make one and then I was waiting for the paint to dry on the other and when I got
“So you think baseball is more important to me than this? More important than
“How are
Dean fists the sheets with one hand while the other stays on Cas’s shoulder as he makes his way down Dean’s body, taking Dean apart and making him forget about all of his problems, including his nerves about tomorrow. Cas makes him forget everything except the soft hair now tangled in his fingers and a warm mouth wrapped around him, Cas’s groans shaking Dean to his core until he’s seeing stars explode behind his closed eyes, Cas’s name falling from his lips.
Knowing he’s powerless to stop her, Castiel holds his hands up in surrender. He even sings along, after he lights the two birthday candles, which the twins both blow out with identical rolls of their blue eyes.
Their call ends and Dean stares at his daughter's picture again. She looks like her mother, in the way daughters do. They share the same nose and chin and Emma got Lydia's laugh. She's blonde too but instead of the stick straight hair Lydia had, Emma has soft waves like her Aunt Donna, the two sisters different in every way. Emma got Dean's green eyes and his cheeky grin and when she's mad or frustrated, the same dimples of discontent.
Fuck.
“I know, you don’t have to say it.” More than once, Cas has had to remind Dean that together,
Which is why most of their walk is spent with Pug being pet and cooed at, his little tail flipping the whole time. It’s a cloudy day, so he’s still wearing his hoodie, adding to his charm. Back home, Pug runs for a quick drink of water, his little feet slipping over the hardwood before he trips snout first into the pillow he’s trying to climb on. Castiel huffs out a laugh when he finally makes it, only to burrow right under his purple blanket, the one covered in rainbows, only his little rump, tail, and hind legs sticking out, exhausted from an influx of cuddles, no doubt.
“Come on, we’re going to the water.”
“You should be ashamed, it's not appropriate and your mother—”
They're both covered in a fine sheen of sweat when Cas scoots away from him, much to Dean's disappointment. He was kinda hoping to make Cas come like this, but before he can coax Cas back to him, his gorgeous fiancé sits up and scoots down Dean's body until he's straddling Dean's hips and sinking down onto Dean’s aching cock.
The Sparrow isn’t the closest bar to Dean’s dorm, but it is the only LGBT friendly bar that won’t blink twice at Dean’s fake ID, which he flashes at the bouncer before holding the door open for his best friend and closest confidant, Donna Hascum. She’s another local like Dean, and they’ve been “besties”, as Donna likes to say, since they were kids, living only a few houses apart and being the same age, bonding over their bikes and a combined annoyance at the existence of younger siblings.
Jimmy is enjoying this, watching Claire and Castiel grow more and more surprised.
Cas rides Dean into oblivion, and he swears he comes so hard he can’t see straight, and it’s Cas’s sweet lips kissing along the curve of his neck that brings Dean back, that grounds him. Sneaking his arms around the man he loves, Dean doesn’t let Cas go until he has to and even then, Cas isn’t gone long, returning with a warm cloth to wipe him down with.
They part ways at the door to the weight room, Dean promising to let Garth know about Friday.
His twin is silent for a long time until he pulls himself away from Castiel with a loud, deep breath. Sighing, he separates them, but keeps a hand on Castiel’s shoulder. “You should have called me when you found these, I could have helped.”
under his breath as he sways them back and forth, careful not to squish Pug.
Against his better judgement (Cas will hate it too), Dean’s eyes flick over to the family box, where he knows Sam is sweating him, correct in his assumption when he sees his little brother on his feet.
“No,” Dean replies, muffled by the pillow his face is buried in. Light purple spikes stiff from sleep disappear when his grouchy fiance pulls the blankets he’s grabbed over his head. He whips them back down just as fast so he can throw a sleep rumpled glare at Castiel over his shoulder. “You like
Clearing his throat, Dean focuses back on the road, cheeks burning. “It’s really green.”
Karamo whoops.
“I understand, Dean, it’s fine. My—my apologies,” he interrupts, shaking his head. “I have an account for similar reasons.”
It was Dean’s first official day as a freshman at the University of Kansas. He worked his ass off to get there, holding the title of the first in his family to attend college. A baseball scholarship got him in the door, and if staying on campus wasn’t a requirement, he’d still be living over at The Roadhouse, sharing a room with Sam and driving to class every day. Dean had slept in a bed next to Sam every night since Dean was four years old, and he was nervous about Sam not being able to sleep without him. At least that’s what he was telling himself.
He scowls into his drink for a moment. Gin always makes him too introspective. Dean never stocks it wherever they stay because he says it makes them both too weepy. Castiel knocks back the rest of the drink and decides to switch to beer.
Groaning at the sight of the crowded bar, Dean decides to wait it out and finds an empty pub table to lean against. He brushes off the maroon and silver confetti before he rests his elbows on the tabletop, phone in hand. A new notification tells him he has a text from Emma.
“Daddy? Can I come in?” Emma’s looking at him, a small, hesitant smile on her face when Dean looks up. She’s been gentle with him since The Date That Shall Not Be Named, doing all her chores and homework without their usual ribbing over it and she’s been making dinner before he gets home every day this week. Tonight she was making tacos when he got home and she holds a plate out for him now.
Dean wonders if someone can die from not being able to come. Maybe if he’s the first, they’ll name the phenomenon after him. That would be awesome.
Fussy pig.
He slides back into Cas in one smooth roll, snapping his hips and Cas groans into the sheets, pushing back for more. Dean holds him tight and fucks Cas fast and dirty, reaching down to pull Cas up by his hair. He remembers all the teasing Cas did this week and his hips move faster, punching out noise after dirty noise from Cas.
The whole drive home, people have been honking from other cars and whistling at him from the street. He probably looks fucking badass driving Baby dressed as Batman, now that he thinks about it. Dean gives out an acceptable amount of winks and finger guns before he gets to the garage.
“Mr. Novak, see me after class, please?” Dean tries to make his voice sound bored as he pretends to click around on his laptop. He notices Novak high five another student—Gabriel something—who’s looking at him with a smirk. Dean loses his hard on after that, fucking pissed that Castiel might have said something stupid about him. About them.
But Castiel soon finds he doesn’t have any trouble either, his thoughts wandering to Dean and their morning as he draws a bath for Pug, tipping a little baby shampoo into the tub to create some bubbles for Pug to play with. He used to hate his baths at first but now, Castiel lays down a towel so he doesn’t slip while he moves around and as long as Castiel keeps the water warm, he’s content to sit and soak while Castiel washes him.
“But with Cas and Claire and Jack, it could be happier for
“Ok, time for y'all to go. I'll walk you out.” He rolled his eyes in Castiel's direction. “Be back in a bit.”
“Come on, don’t wanna miss our reservations.”
“Ugh, it’s a menace! It’s cold,
He pulls Castiel closer for one last kiss. “Friday, Cas.” He grabs a handful of firm ass and Castiel smirks. “We’re on for seven?”
Sam is already lowering the tailgate when Dean reaches the truck. Cas had driven them to Strawberry Hill that morning to pick up the tree he and Dean picked out last week. The seven foot Fraser Fir will look amazing in their living room and Dean can’t wait to decorate it.
Dean is the first to break the silence between them, but Castiel doesn’t mind in the slightest.
Smirking, Dean raises an eyebrow. “Yeah, actually.”
Dean slips the necklace over his head with a small smile. “You don’t need it?”
Dean kissed him.
They reach Jimmy’s closed office before she turns to him and despite not knowing anything, Claire still gives him a soft kiss on the cheek. “Good luck, uncle. And happy birthday.”
going back. Cas fixed it all. He helped me catch up on my classes, tutored me through some. Yelled at me for choosing so many hard classes,” Dean shakes his head. “Got us roomed up together, even though he had scored a single. Cas is just—he’s the best guy I know. Selfless,
Dean is wearing a pair of maroon satin panties, his hard dick creasing the front, the tip of the head peeking out from behind black lace trim and holy shit, Castiel can't wait to get his mouth on Dean.
“Let’s go outside.” Dean holds his hands up and makes a grabbing motion. “Help me up.”
“Didn’t seem right, you not knowing any Queen songs,” Dean says, stepping back into Castiel’s space. His pulse quickens. Pug snuffles the ground between their feet. “See, I put all my favorites.” Dean points at the box and motions with his finger to encourage Castiel to turn back over to the list of songs. There’s a dark silver ring on his finger and two freckles above the curve of his nail and for a man who works with his hands, Dean has incredibly nice cuticles.
Damn her. Dean has no secrets. Donna says she knew them from school but Dean can’t remember knowing her then; she would have been a freshman when they were seniors and he didn’t meet Lydia until a few years after he graduated. Either way, she’d gotten his super secret confession about it after one too many and now, well—this.
(See the end of the chapter for
It fucking sucked, but Dean worked to keep the roof over their head long enough for Sam to graduate (valedictorian even the nerd) and get a full ride to Stanford. After that, Dean sold the house, threw the money in a savings account, and got a tiny apartment down the street from the office, which is where he's been… until he sold most of his earthly possessions to move to Costa Rica.
It’s like everything stops and all there is is him, and Cas, and all that matters is the way they breathe in and out together, their hearts falling in sync, not for the first and certainly, never for the last time. They’re bound together, Dean’s realizing and Cas and their kids and this life are everything Dean will ever want and need.
“See, this is the fun part, yes?” Tan asks. “Let’s dress you up a bit, I kept some of those patterns you liked, added a few more, some fun prints like this one with the little bees embroidered in and kept some smart patterns in there too, depending on what mood you’re going for.” He flicks through the shirts and Castiel already knows the one he wants to wear.
He drags himself to his knees and crawls over to the edge of the mattress, grabbing Cas by the waist. “C’mere, babe,” Dean requests, wanting to feel Cas’ weight on top of him. Cas smirks and slides his hands up Dean’s arms and around the back of his head.
“Are you our little Kit Cat?” He murmurs so as not to startle her and the kitten responds by lurching forward to bump her forehead to Castiel’s with a scratchy meow that melts into a sweet purr and when Castiel raises his eyes to Dean’s, he realizes they’re brimming with tears. “Yes, I believe that’s her name,” he chokes out around his smile. Castiel brings Kit close to his chest. “Thank you for bringing her into our family, Dean.”
Their food comes and Dean digs in so Charlie can talk. “It’s more worship the earth and pray to the moon, less dark spells and sacrifices.” She leans over to pull a paper bag out of her purse. “That reminds me.”
His smile only widens as Dean reveals what he’s hiding, a rather sizeable and beautifully wrapped box, the paper covering it a newspaper print decorated with splashes of red and green paint, its lid decorated with a big red bow.
“So, what are you going to wear on your date? Do you want me to go shopping with you for something nice?”
Castiel looked at him, eyes sparkling in the fading light. “The luckiest.”
He doesn’t waste time getting Dean naked but Cas is still wearing his skirt when he pushes Dean’s legs open to get his mouth around Dean’s cock. It’s skilled and he knows where to lick and suck Dean to make him beg, to turn him shameless and needy. Blue eyes stare up at Dean from between his legs and he doesn’t think he’s gonna last long.
“I've got us covered babe, it's kinda my thing.” Dean winked and came around the bar to take Cas in his arms. “So when I went by your house today, I noticed you hadn't totally unpacked.” He felt Cas pull away a bit and tightened his grip. “I was thinking, to save you time of course, why don't you just bring the boxes to my house.”
She pulled back, shaking her head. “No way. I hate when people assume they know what’s best for someone else. If you’re confident with your decision, I’ll back your play.” She went back to her cheese. “You’re a grown up, you can make grown up decisions. And if it goes to hell, I’ll bring the tequila.”
A year ago he’d never have dreamed he’d be in this place. Wizard Technology had been Charlie’s idea. Apparently she’d been dreaming of it for years, having her own technology consulting firm. After both Dean and Cas quit Sandover, she pitched the idea to them. She was brilliant with the tech, but she knew there were other skills needed that she frankly lacked and had no interest in developing.
Dean groaned again, but went to pop the hood and look at the engine. He pushed and pulled and checked the fluids, how much rust and corrosion there was. And damn, it did look in decent shape. “Could use a bit of a tune-up too.”
On the fourth day his apartment buzzer went off. Repeatedly.
They settled in to discussing more literature as they continued to unpack, the conversation surprisingly lively. Perhaps he shouldn’t be surprised, but Cas wasn’t used to talking to anyone who encouraged him to talk about the odd things he was interested in.
Dean wasn’t safely unavailable.
“Yes, that would be more than okay. Thank you.”
His desk phone rang while he was in the middle of reviewing the monthly sales figures. He glanced up, saw it was Cas, and picked up. “Hey Cas. What’s up?”
There wasn’t an immediate reply. Dean wasn’t exactly surprised, though he was disappointed.
Dean chews, his face going through some contortions.
“And the remaining assets,” Mr. Winchester added.
He shifted, winced as his chest pulled. It didn’t hurt, exactly. More like he thought it should hurt, but there were drugs keeping the pain away. He opened his eyes, blinked twice while a face came down closer to him.
She looks at Cas then with a smile. “You never told me before just how handsome this ‘roommate’ of yours is. Nor that you are romantically involved.”
“I wanted to tell you in person, before the rumor mill hit,” she said, stepping inside and closing the door.
A sense of betrayal rippled through him. What the hell? It shouldn’t feel personal, but it did. He’d liked the guy, dammit. Had he just been lying there in wait, knowing the entire time that Dean was security? Trying to figure out what he could learn?
“Perhaps. You’re unlikely to find them interesting.”
“I believe that I do. I have been performing some research, looking at home plans online. I know at least the general outlines of what I would like, if not how to accomplish it.”
“You really think some of this information will be useful to you?”
“Not an answer.”
“Do you believe there needs to be a ‘spark’ for a relationship to be good?”
“Mr. Singer, is the car functional?”
“He may not be as well-known as Merlin, but I’ve heard the name before. What does it say about him?”
Dean grinned. “You like bees, right?”
Oh. Of course. “That still isn’t a word.”
Gabriel leaned over his shoulder to take a look as well. “Nice. Enough to keep you in the lifestyle to which you would like to be accustomed, and not enough that Mikey and Luc would push it unless it’s just to be assholes about it. Which I won’t put past them, Luc especially. He can be a petty dick.”
“At least he
If this Mr. Roman might advance his career, he supposed he could tolerate meeting with him.
“What, you think I don’t know you guys well enough to know this is what you’d choose? Dorks.” She rolled her eyes affectionately.
Damn. So all of Cas’ training sessions really did have a point to them.
“It was about Mesopotamian symbology and its influences on later civilizations.”
Dean figured that was so that if they turned out awful, he could torture all of them.
“No, of course not. I didn’t continue drinking after you left. Are you? Still tipsy?” he clarified.
“You recall how I told you it mentioned many figures purported to be magicians? Figures who history cannot confirm ever existed? It goes on from there, intermingling notes on those ‘sorcerers’ with experiments in working magic themselves,” Castiel informed him, giving him a flat look. “They even claim some success, recording these spells as though they work. Unless it was intended as a work of fiction, it’s pure garbage. There is no such thing as magic, everyone knows that.”
“No, unlikely. I will want some portions of lawn, though, nearer to the house.”
“Ticket?”
“No, not really. I’m making marinara sauce now. It needs to simmer on low for an hour or so. I thought I’d make some pasta while that’s happening.”
“I know the rules. But don’t you need more than two to play poker?”
He wasn’t supposed to be noticing those things. Sure he might happen to know that Cas was bi, leaning more towards men. Jimmy had been open about it when he found out Dean was briefly dating a guy, wanting to let him know it made no difference at all to him and to their friendship. That relationship hadn’t worked out, but it was nice to know Jimmy was cool with Dean’s sexuality, especially with how active the Novaks were in their church. Dean didn’t always trust church folk when it came to sexuality.
The car door opened, and Gabriel dropped a white waxed bag onto his lap -- an overly stuffed bag. “I thought you were just getting us one thing apiece.”
“Yeah, well, we should do it again. Make it a thing. Doesn’t always have to be poker, though it could be.” He pulled on an extra flannel, deliberately not looking at Cas. He waited on tenterhooks for Cas’ response. He threw it out there casually, but he knew that committing to a standing social engagement would be a big deal for him.
Dean’s eyes widen when he returns. “Dude. You’re wearing actual pajamas. You never wear actual pajamas. You wear boxers and t-shirts with clever environmentalist sayings on them that you love but refuse to wear in public.”
“What do we need to discuss?”
“Analyzing myths and symbols, I remember.” Dean took a sip of his beer. “Maybe next time I come by you’ll loan me one of your books. I’m curious.”
Castiel nodded and gestured towards the table. “Thank you for agreeing to come,” he said. “Please, have a seat.”
More often than not, Cas stayed at Dean’s late enough to share dinner. That was bittersweet. He was growing to enjoy the company far too much. The only other time he’d regularly shared meals with someone, after leaving his childhood home, was with Bartholomew. These dinners were vastly different. Where Bartholomew had insisted on gourmet meals presented on a perfectly set table, Dean was perfectly happy with paper plates and a table that hadn’t been completely cleared from Cas’ work earlier in the day. He was more interested in talking to Cas, discussing how the house had progressed, what they’d done, what was coming up next. He also asked questions about what Cas had done during the day. It was amazing, and satisfying, and sometimes, when he thought about it, utterly terrifying.
Castiel made a non-committal sound in response to that. “Apparently this world has always existed, even if I was unaware of it.” He pushed his hands into the pockets of his coat. “Are we done here? Is it time to go back?”
This would be so much easier if he waited until his kitchen was complete. Then he would be in his own space, with all of the beautiful new appliances installed. He’d have the professional-quality stovetop with six burners, including an indoor grilling surface. The tools he had to work with in Dean’s tiny apartment made everything so much more complicated — but not impossible. He wanted to do it now, though. He didn’t want to wait.
“I’m leaving Sandover,” she said. “Tomorrow is my last day.”
Finally, Anna herself walks down the aisle, escorted by both her parents. Dean’s a little surprised. He would have thought Naomi would be traditional and conservative enough that Zachariah would walk their daughter down the aisle alone, but apparently not. Maybe Anna insisted.
“I asked around a bit, didn’t find anything alarming. I’m okay with it.” He smiled then. “Congratulations, Cassie. You’re about to turn this place into somewhere actually habitable.”
Cas’ gaze narrowed at him. Dean’s collar felt tight. Please buy it, Cas. Please, please, please.
“Good afternoon, sir,” Castiel said.
“Huh.” He tipped his head to the side, considering. Guy was cute, definitely, though he looked a bit rumpled. Sort of like Columbo, in those old TV shows Uncle Bobby liked to watch, even the dark messy hair was similar. He also looked vaguely familiar, though Dean couldn’t easily place him.
Suddenly his cottage felt much smaller and more intimate than it ever had before. Dean had a presence about him that was impossible to ignore. Castiel didn’t want to be aware of Dean the way he was. Until meeting Dean, he’d thought that Alfie was an anomaly. He hadn’t been attracted to anyone, not really, after that youthful romance ended with his voyage across the Atlantic, and Alfie’s subsequent death. He’d noticed that some people were aesthetically pleasing, of course. But that admiration had been strictly intellectual, like looking at a piece of art and finding it beautiful. For all its beauty, it was still an object.
Dean studied his face a moment, then nodded in agreement to let the topic go for the moment. “Very well. What can you tell me of what you saw when you were inside his home? Anything of note, anything that stood out?”
“Okay.” Dean heads over, through the living room to the small adjacent room. It was probably intended to be a formal dining room, but neither Dean nor Cas are formal dining room types of people. They eat at the kitchen table or in the living room with the TV on, plates either balanced on their laps or sitting on the coffee table in front of the sofa.
Now that he had something specific and tangible to look for, Castiel found a great deal of information in the journal. As he’d thought, the ritual to bring Malak’s essence back and transfer it to a new host had to take place at the full moon. More than that, it had to be the full moon with the highest tide, and it needed to be near the sea. That explained why Roman had chosen Havenport.
“Straight up straight? Or leanings in other directions?”
Going back to their regular lives is surreal. It may have been only a handful of days, but being able to openly show how he really felt about Cas had been amazing. Now, back at the house they share, Dean just feels weird.
When they’d finished, they decided to head back to Castiel’s home for further research. Castiel shivered when he stepped outside again. The wind had picked up from the harbor. Perhaps he should have taken his favorite blue wool scarf. Clouds had rolled in as well, so it was dark despite the nearness of the full moon.
“I am.” He got an edge up, and pulled.
More than everything else, he was overwhelmed by feeling heartsick.
“I don’t have a crush on him. Mr. No-workplace-relationships? Remember that?”
They walk from the terrace doors to the path leading towards the garden. There are large urns filled with white and pink flowers, spiky ones and full blooms, tiny ones spilling over the sides in cascades. They’re lovely and smell good, but Dean has no idea what they are. There are roses in there. Those, at least, he’s confident in the label. A string quartet plays soft churchy music, hidden behind a screen.
“Indeed.” He dipped his spoon into his chowder far more fastidiously, chewing and swallowing before speaking again. “You do realize it’s far too soon for me to have completed the translation work.”
“Oh. Mostly errands, I suppose. Large enough to carry a few larger purchases. Reliable enough to take short trips, such as to Topeka. Preferably fuel efficient.”
“It would be difficult to get it moved out of Caroline. It’s estate law, and Kansas has clear jurisdiction. All of the property is in Kansas, and the will was executed in Kansas. I guess I’m not putting it past them to try and have it moved, but I’ve already put things in place to counter the most likely arguments. If they try to file a challenge, it’ll go in front of Judge Turner. Besides, I have something in my back pocket that they won’t be expecting.”
But first they had to get through today.
“No?”
‘House’ seems like a very modest word to use for what he’s seeing. “Holy shit, Cas, is this the place?”
Gabe? That makes a lot more sense.” He’s kidding, mostly. Dean actually likes Gabe and his insane sense of humor – when that wit isn’t aimed at him.
Dean laughed at that, pleased that Cas had remembered his comment about spending a lot of time here when he was young. “Maybe not, but damn was it fun. So many interesting things. Bobby was better at keeping an eye on us than Dad ever was, so there’s that. Come on.” He headed to the house, a two-story farm-style house beside the yard. The place was much simpler in design than Cas’ house. No fancy trim work; simple clapboard siding and a utilitarian porch. It was, however, in excellent repair. Dean made sure of that.
Dean managed a feeble grin. “Happy New Year, guys.”
That gave Cas pause. “If you mean do we have irrefutable evidence, then no. Not that I’m aware of. But certainly there is more than enough circumstantial evidence to point the finger in their direction.”
“You did?”
“Screw dinner. It’s done anyhow. I’ll turn it off, bring it with, okay.”
“It’s a fantasy. You’re allowed to let it turn out nicely rather than disastrously.”
Dean grinned unapologetically. “I help.”
After being seated and placing their orders, Charlie looked at both of them. “So… I considered that this might be a speech-worthy occasion, but then I decided eh, screw it. I’ll keep it down to I’m really glad I know the two of you. Who knew a corporate orientation session would lead to really great friendship?”
Castiel couldn’t convince himself of that.
The hooded figures turned towards Castiel as one, stepping forward. Adrenaline surged through him. It was now or never – and he had never done this before.
There were three people already in the room. “Hi,” one of them said brightly – a young woman with red hair and a friendly smile. “I’m Charlie, nice to meet you!”
Cas blinks and looks at the staircase again with new eyes. It's highly polished wood, and wide enough for five people to walk side by side comfortably. He supposes it is quite something. It's always just been part of his life rather than anything noteworthy.
“Good-bye, Dean.”
But then, he hadn’t cared so much about what was at stake. He took an elbow to his cheekbone, a heel to his kneecap, but he didn’t let go. He didn’t give up. Finally he managed to pin the man under his body, remembering enough of the moves that Lucifer had used on him to get him in some sort of a wrestling hold.
“No,” Gabriel answered. “She and our parents had a bit of a falling out when we were young. Castiel would have been eight or nine at the time.”
Cas reluctantly laughs. “Alright. We have some time before dinner. Let me show you where the bathroom is. We’ll have to share it.”
“Fine. We’ll go up to your room.”
Praying with everything that he had that his education would not fail him now, when it was most important, Castiel reached into his trousers’ pocket and withdrew a small piece of sharp glass, broken from a mirror before he left home.
Cas feels like a petulant child. He doesn’t like the feeling.
She nodded casually, and her gaze flicked quickly over Cas, but she didn’t study him openly.
“Boss?” The voice in his headset was tinny, alarmed. “Boss? You there?”
The server followed her gaze. “Oh, Dean? No worries, he won’t come punch your lights out,” he assured them. “He swings both ways.”
He hadn’t done a whole lot of landscaping work, but he found it wasn’t really all that different from the kinds of handyman work he did on a daily basis. It all came down to sweat equity. He was happy to let Cas be the decision-maker, telling Dean where to dig up the grass and how to mix the different piles of stuff he’d gotten delivered from the garden supply store and where to put the soil mixture. Cas worked just as hard, wielding his spade and shovel and rake awkwardly at first, but quickly figuring out the knack of it.
Harvelle’s Roadhouse was nothing spectacular from the outside, Cas had thought as Dean pulled into a gravel parking lot and stopped the truck. The building was boxy and had few windows, simply a row of high, narrow panes of glass under the eaves. The exterior was a mix of metal and concrete, and there were neon signs for various brands of beer blinking on and off. He thought they would be much more prominent at night, rather than in the bright light of mid afternoon.
That goes a long way with the extended family as well. Some of the others might not approve, but they know better than to be vocal about it. No one wants to incur Grandmother’s wrath. She’s had almost a hundred years to master the art of politely freezing people out, and isn’t afraid to use it on family when they deserve it.
He carefully walked down the slight embankment to the edge of the water, Dean a short distance behind.
“Did I ever tell you my brother’s a lawyer? With a very prestigious law firm that has a really good record with respect to employment law?” He didn’t actually know if that part was true, but if it wasn’t? And he needed it? He had every confidence that Sam knew a kick-ass lawyer.
“Not here, no. My apologies.” He preferred not to keep hard liquor here, not when he was usually alone. If he wanted a drink of something stronger than beer, he would go to a tavern. He pulled the jug out from the lower cupboard, opened it and poured two mugs. He considered a moment, then cut two thick slices of bread and a wedge of cheese to go along with it.
“Well, so far just me and Dean, and hopefully you. The others I asked are thinking they won’t be able to make it, though Kevin isn’t yet an absolute no. Anyone else you’d want to invite? A date or anything?”
“I am.” Cas bounced once on the balls of his feet with nerves.
Castiel cleared space in the center of his desk by the expedience of sweeping the previous contents to the side. He’d been working on his own notes, nothing rare or precious. He set the bundle down in the center of the surface and studied the knots in the rope before expertly untying them. He retrieved a pair of cotton gloves from his desk drawer and quickly pulled them on before unwrapping the protective cover.
“Ah. Yes. Proper salutations. Hello, Dean. Good morning. Were you serious about there being suitable vehicles available at Singer Salvage?”
* * *
“Incoming,” Dean said, then handed her over.
“We should wait for the fire to go out entirely. Nearly time. We should consider that the ghoul was sent after you on purpose.”
“What?” she called back from the living room.
That sounded so simple, but after years with Bartholomew, Cas was only just beginning to not react every time with surprise.
“I would like him to stay.” He turned towards Dean. “Will you be able to let the sheriff perform her questioning without interrupting?”
“I was just noticing the picture on your bookcase. That’s a beautiful car.” She moved to the side and picked it up, using the tip of one perfectly manicured nail to tap at the photo of himself, Sam, and Baby. Bobby had taken it, the summer before Sam left for Stanford. It was one of Dean’s favorite photos. The lighting had been perfect, showing off Baby to her best advantage, and he and Sam looked happy.
“Aw shucks, Sammy.”
He was terrified, he realized. Terrified that telling this to Dean would change things between them.
Whatever her reasons, he was reluctantly grateful.
There are probably more weddings in his future, though, so it would be good to have a suit.
There wouldn’t be any other Novak dragonkind within five hundred miles. It was too risky. There might, possibly, be some of their human Wing.
Two days to go until The Event. The activities were ramping up. Dean had staff at the caterers, at the airport and train depot, monitoring the freeways and secondary roads. He had people watching the palace and watching the nearby cathedral, with checkpoints and security scans of everyone coming and going. Everyone who’d been issued a pass had undergone rigorous security screening.
“You don’t need to say anything. I’m not even entirely certain why I’ve told you this.”
Cas doesn’t know all there is to know about Dean’s childhood, before he escaped to college, but he does know that he and Sam spent too many nights sleeping in places that Cas would have been terrified to stay.
“You tell me. What are you up for?” Dean paused to study him. “You just got sick from looking at it.”
When Cas won his third hand in a row, Dean fastened his green-eyed gaze on him. “You have the best poker face ever. Your expression doesn’t change at all whether you’ve got crap or a great hand.”
“That’s outside the salary range for the position.”
“And almost succeeded in killing you.” Cas’ tone was suddenly fierce.
“Gabriel,” Cas sighed.
Dean snorted. “That’s because I’m not. I’m an investigator. A criminal investigator, privately employed.”
Cas tipped his head to one side, turning to regard Dean thoughtfully. “You have a good nose.”
“Never said that, I would never have said that. You know me better than that. Besides, donuts are half off after noon!”
Sam sat back, a wrinkle between his brows. It smoothed out a moment later. Dean swore he could see all of the gears turning in his brother’s mind. He nodded. “Yeah.”
Now that Cas points it out, it’s hard to miss. It’s a dull white, not as grimy as he’d expect from something up on top of the roof. It’s a female angel with vast feathery wings and a Greco-Roman style toga, holding a book. From here he can’t tell what sort of facial expression it has, or even really see if there’s a halo or not.
“I’ll miss you too.” He stood up, opened his arms, and hugged her.
The elevator doors opened onto the sales floor. Dean looked around, curious. He was going to be spending a lot of time here, after all. “This is the floor,” Zach said. “Elevator bank in the middle, rest rooms too. There’s a small kitchenette down that way, with a coffee machine and vending machine. The main break room is on the third floor. My office is the one in the corner there.” He pointed. “You’re over this way.” There were offices and conference rooms all along the windows. Dean’s, it turned out, was right next to the small conference room in another corner. They must be on the same side of the building as the room they’d met in this morning, because there was the same river view.
“Come say hi to Cas, Peanut.” Dean flew her over to Cas.
Once his heart rate had slowed enough, he moved forward, the tide already surging into the caverns. Please, please let him be right about this. Stories about unfortunate children playing here and drowning in the caves pushed at him, but he resolutely pushed them aside. This was dangerous, yes. Terrifying.
“Zepp… Led Zeppelin? I’ve heard of them.”
Gabriel poured himself a cup of coffee and leaned back against the kitchen cabinets, crossing his feet at the ankles. “So what do you think?”
This was so much more than attraction, than desire. Cas was the most amazing person he’d ever met. Being with him made Dean feel things he hadn’t felt before, a level of contentment and satisfaction that he’d never even dreamed of.
“Cases like these are difficult because they are always the word of one person against another. However… she isn’t without any corroborating evidence.”
“I suppose I hadn’t thought of that.”
Dean dealt everyone in.
Dean smiled crookedly, shrugging one shoulder. “True. I grew up here in good old Caroline, Kansas. Small town, neighbors who were always aware of my business.”
“This is written in ancient Enochian.” Castiel looked up at his visitor, gaze narrowed. “Where did you obtain a book written in ancient Enochian?”
“Oh hell yeah. I think Sam knew before I did, honestly. He says I always talked more about Han Solo than Princess Leia, even after the infamous bikini scene. He actually set me up with Aaron. Aaron of the masculine variety, who is actually a really cool dude even if we decided it wasn’t going to work out long term. We’re still friends, and that’s a bit of a novelty, staying friends with an ex. It’s nice, though.”
Oh no. No, no, no. He couldn’t leave. Dean flipped the deadbolt and flung the door open, standing and staring.
He checked in with the surveillance guys before heading out to do his walk-through. Electronics were good and all, but he didn’t completely trust them. He liked to see things himself. Sometimes there was something out of place, some little thing that just felt off, that no technology was ever going to catch.
One day, around noon, Dean knocked on the doorframe to Cas’ office. “Hey,” he said with a grin.
Cas was a handsome guy, but a good tailor would do wonders for him. His jackets weren’t properly fitted, and don’t get Dean started on the pants. He bought them too big around the waist, probably so that they’d fit around his thighs. Dean hadn’t noticed right away, but about a month ago there had been a casual day – one of those things where you bought stickers that allowed you to wear jeans, with the proceeds going towards charity – and Cas had actually worn jeans. Dean’s eyes had gone wide at the sight.
“You were looking for me?” Bela prompted him, her tone practically a purr.
“Is that the best way I can help?” He was torn between avoiding looking at it and actually studying it. His curiosity had always been as much plague as strength.
“Cheers.” Dean clinked his bottle against hers and Cas’.
“Sounds like him.” He watched as Mariel shifted, then let out a tremendous burp. He chuckled. “She sure makes a lot of noise for such a little peanut.”
It takes him a long time to fall asleep again.
“Dean.” He caught a shaky breath. “There was… there was someone here. He was pouring gas…”
The air caught the sphere and wrapped around it, forming a tiny but powerful vortex, shooting it like a bullet towards the artifact.
Confused and mortified, Cas looked down to his plate again, fixing the placement of his utensils. The fork was too far from the plate, the knife not perfectly perpendicular to the table’s edge.
“Good morning, Mr. Adler. Is that a new tie? It’s flattering.”
Would he perhaps have met Dean, before he met Bartholomew? He caught his breath at that thought as a brilliant flash of possibilities exploded behind his eyes. Childhood memories he’d never experienced. Playing by the creek with Dean, barefoot, mud up to their knees, chasing frogs and laughing when they hopped away, when one or the other of them fell and was coated in the mud, head to toe. Perhaps even having the fortitude to insist on going to college wherever Dean was, building a relationship with him rather than Bart.
“I’ll see you soon.”
grown-up stuff.”
Or if he wanted to get the security force watching for something else as a distraction. No. That was certainly a possibility, but he didn’t believe it. Still, he’d keep an eye out. Just because he didn’t believe Cas was setting up some sort of an elaborate distraction didn’t mean he wouldn’t still be alert and observant about the situation as a whole. He wouldn’t cut off any existing security measures in favor of anything driven by Cas’ warning.
That evening, Dean went over to Sam’s house. It was a small house, and still needed additional work.
He couldn’t help but think about what Cas would say. Cas, with his strong opinions about sexual harassment in the workplace, and the ethical violations involved.
“Yes, I’d like to see if I can make any headway on my office.” He stopped then as a thought occurred to him. “Unless it would be wiser to remain here, to discourage the thieves.”
Dean bumps his shoulder against Cas’, turns towards Gabe.
Tonight Dean returned a little earlier than usual. Cas was making a beef dish, tender and flavorful. “This would be delicious with popovers,” Cas mused as he was chopping vegetables.
He stood. “Get out.”
almost believes that Dean is enamored of him, and he knows better.
Cas follows his gaze, sees at least half a dozen people suddenly turn away and busy themselves with something or another, and his stomach falls.
“I don’t particularly like it either, but I don’t see a hell of a lot of other options. Look, I won’t take all day. I’ll be back here before dinner, and we’ll decide what to do. Oh, and while you’re studying ways to disrupt their ritual, maybe see if you can find some other magic spells that might be useful, hm? We know you can do it, now.”
“They love you in IT,” Dean protested. “You can program circles around most of the people in your department.”
“They use French to sound pretentious. It’s still just meat and potatoes. And salad.”
“Oh, yeah, I have, haven’t I. Is that farther east than this?”
It’s his father, emerging from the terrace door of the house looking healthy and happy. His hair is getting a bit long on top, the beard generously sprinkled salt and pepper. He’s starting to show his age, which is alarming. Parents are supposed to be ageless. He waits for Cas to get out of the car, then envelops him in a warm, welcoming hug. “It’s good to see you, son. It’s been too long.” His arms are comforting. He smells and feels like home, making Cas feel the way he did when he was five and Daddy came back from a business trip.
“All right. Goodbye.” He hung up the phone and looked across the room to Dean.
Was it an emergency booty call? In some ways that would be awesome. Having Cas push him up against the door, crash their mouths together, hands eager and questing, clothes shoved out of the way, hot fast and dirty. The stuff of fantasy.
“Yeah, I get that, but… but it stands. If we do this — and I definitely want to do this — I want to be absolutely certain that you’re into it. Full consent, all that.”
Dean sat back in his chair. Huh. Had he really been working at Sandover for a year already?
“There he is. My adorable little cynic.” Cas reaches out to pat Dean’s cheek affectionately.
“But what if you decide to remodel the kitchen and move the cabinets slightly?”
Cas considered that for a moment. “No, that is unnecessary. You can open them and then tell me or show me what’s inside, and then label the box with where it should go. I truly hope that Gabriel was exaggerating about not having any organization scheme to how he packed — or at the very least, that he didn’t go out of his way to be random about how he packed the boxes, because I had my belongings somewhat organized at the apartment. He would have had to work to combine bathroom items with books. Though I would not put it past him. He has a twisted sense of humor, at times.”
, and gotten enamored of the premise. He didn’t want to work through a Julia Child cookbook, but he did decide to try a new recipe every week. The more elaborate ones he saved for their regular dinners.
After forever, and all too soon, Dean gently backs away, looking into Cas’ eyes. His pupils are wide and dark, his breathing uneven as well. Cas could almost convince himself that Dean is as affected as he is himself.
“We might have met you when we were all younger, if you’d had a chance to be around more.”
Castiel scowled, shoving that memory back into the hidden shadows of his mind, where it belonged.
“Thank you,” he said, sitting very stiffly in his seat.
Castiel tipped his head to one side, then dipped his chin. “In that case, I stand corrected.”
“You seem to have claimed the left. That’s fine with me.”
“Am I supposed to call him Mr. Winchester?”
There was a suspicious glint in Bobby’s eyes, and a twitch at the corner of his mouth. “Sure, son. I mean, needs a bit of work on the exhaust system before she’s ready to go, but that won’t take long. Just need to get ‘er up on the lifts and pull the bad pipes and replace ‘em.”
Dean swore. “There was something in the book about what circumstances could bring him back, right? Malak?”
“What?” Cas’ head is spinning. Dean is close, so close. They’ve been close before. They live together, after all. There have been times they’ve sat together on the couch to watch the television, times that they’ve bumped against each other while trying to assemble the IKEA dining table. Physical contact is nothing new. But somehow? Somehow this feels different.
“I don’t actually have that much. But yes. Some of what I do have is important to me.”
“Same. I didn’t want to deal with it when you weren’t there to make it worthwhile. I feel bad about Billie, though. Hiring her, and now abandoning her to that.”
“Not yet, no.”
Cas didn’t quite roll his eyes, but Dean could tell it was a close call. “He understands that community outreach is a valuable marketing tool. So long as it doesn’t cost much.”
“Okay. Thank you.”
One day that summer, Mildred knocked on his office door. “Hello,” she said with a little smile.
“I think we’re about done with the game,” Dean said. “You go sit on the couch with her while we get cleaned up, yeah?”
“Quite possibly. Are you regretting the trip?”
Dean smiled, cocky at first, then easing into something more fond and gentle. “Tell you what. How about I let you take care of me for a day or two? Make me some chicken soup, prop me up in bed and swaddle me in blankets?”
On the other hand, acquiring rare and valuable books required money, and the ancient texts department at the museum had to compete with the other departments for resources. He’d heard that a collector in Edinburgh was planning to part with some particularly valuable works that Castiel quite frankly wanted. Owning them would increase the museum’s prestige immediately, thus leading to more opportunities and a stronger reputation. He didn’t care that much about reputation and prestige for their own sakes, but as a means to an end. If people knew about them, they’d seek Castiel out as a consultant, and he would be able to study more works.
“Oh please. Enthuse away. It’s kind of charming.” Dean grinned at him. He asked a few more questions about the archives Castiel was responsible for until the fish was done cooking and Castiel served their meal. He washed his hands before sitting down across the small table from Dean.
The only person that knew Steven Emmanuel was actually Castiel Novak was his editor, Hannah.
* * *
Dean nodded. “That tracks with other information I’ve gained.” He tapped his fingers on his knee, then shrugged. “Well. I think at this point we’re best served by eating some dinner. Did you ever even get any lunch?”
“Then there is only one question. Do you still want to kiss me?”
Dean looked back at him, smiled softly. He reached out to straighten Castiel’s hair. “Well. Amazing.” Then he leaned in to press a soft kiss against the corner of his mouth. “As much as I would like to linger here and enjoy, I think we have a few other things to worry about before exploring this more.”
He’d briefly considered not using that account at all, but realized that would make them wonder how he was paying his expenses, which might in turn lead them to Steven Emmanuel, and that? That he wanted very much to avoid.
Gordon Walker was in the antechamber with ‘The Flight’. He was still in human form, shoulders tense with aggression.
“Just last night. Found it out by the docks. I caught a peek at it before the police got there. Young guy, dark hair. I think he was Asian, which oughtta narrow it down, right? Not too many Asians around here.”
Dean simply couldn’t have that. Not Cas. Cas should never be vulnerable or afraid, not if it was in Dean’s power to fix it.
Cas wakes up in the middle of the night with his hand tangled in the fabric of Dean’s sleep shirt, his knuckles pressed against his spine. He carefully loosens his grip, smoothing the fabric down again and forcing himself to flip over and cling to the edge of the bed.
“Maybe. I’ll be in touch.” Dean stood as well, extended his hand.
Cas joined her with verve, meeting Dean’s gaze in challenge.
“And what crimes are you investigating in Havenport?”
He didn’t have a particular destination consciously in mind, but somehow he wasn’t surprised to find himself in the vicinity of the antechamber. Cas had said that the painting, ‘The Flight’, was at the center of all of this. It made sense, then, to check the physical security in the area. Besides, he wanted to look at it again, now that he knew its importance. Assuming Cas was telling the truth about that, but why wouldn’t he be? Everything he’d said put he himself on the ‘watch’ list, and it wouldn’t make sense to do that unless what he was saying was the truth.
“People that the Adlers think they can curry favor with by inviting them to their daughter’s wedding.”
“And take the house away from Cas?” Dean felt a burning anger at the very idea. “Why would they even want it? I mean… it’s a great house, you know I love it, but to someone like Cas’ brothers? Why would they want a slightly shabby old Victorian farmhouse that has nothing to recommend it other than an authentic charm, and a nice property?”
It was late by the time Dean made it back to his apartment. He really should have stayed in the room he was assigned at the palace, but he needed a little distance, a little privacy. He’d been thinking, when he could, about the things Cas had said, specifically about his reference to Enoch River. He knew he’d heard something about that recently, he just couldn’t place it, and a quick Google search didn’t return anything in the way of results.
After a certain amount of introductory material, the lawyer got to the meat of the terms of Great Aunt Hester’s will.
Cas is watching his father for his reaction, so he sees the slight widening of his blue eyes, followed by a pleased smile. “Dean?” Chuck says.
“Good night, Gabriel.”
Dean’s lips twitched, but he managed to keep himself from smiling. The last thing Cas would want is any sense that Dean was mocking him, when he wasn’t. Not at all. It was an affectionate smile, and that was weird, because. Because. How was it possible to find a dragon adorably awkward? He was a dragon, at least sometimes. Powerful, huge, deadly.
He could take the bike, but that didn't leave him as many options. He wouldn’t be able to transport more than a small amount of purchases back with him, if he actually made it into a store. Perhaps even more important, a bike didn’t offer any real shelter if he became overwhelmed and needed to retreat to a place of safety. He didn’t like having to plan for such eventualities, but his self-recriminations over the perceived weakness didn’t hold as much weight as the potential for humiliation if he needed that safety and it wasn’t available.
“Yes, he can be. Even when it makes no sense. If I were to live off of this, I would no longer need to draw down from other familial resources.”
Cas poured some of the awful creamer into his mug, followed by a packet of sugar, stirring it as he turned towards Dean. “Hello, Dean.” He quirked an eyebrow, inviting Dean to continue.
Bringing up a program on her laptop, she pointed at a map. “I’ve been tracking him, as much as I can. Him and all of the Walkers, just like I do all of the Wings that we have conflicts with.”
“The back gardens. As opposed to…?”
“Well.” Cas seemed rather nonplussed by that. “Thank you? I haven’t been called ‘awesome’ before. It’s quite flattering.”
He walked around the security command center, checking on the different stations, reviewing brief reports, watching a bit of activity on the monitors. Everything seemed to be in order. Why, then, did he have this uneasy feeling?
Cas shuddered. That thought hadn’t occurred to him, but it should have. His older brothers weren’t above such things, and the apartment lease was actually in Michael’s name, not Castiel’s own. “Oh. Yes.”
“The douchebags,” Dean says with a nod. He’s heard plenty of stories about Michael and Lucius, though he’s never actually met either of them.
“Maybe a couple things.” He stepped down into the dusty yard. “What are you looking for?”
“You have a crock pot?”
Neither Dean nor Cas spoke much while eating. The burger was too good to be distracted by conversation. When it was finished, however, he wiped his fingers on the napkin and took another sip of beer. “Thank you, Dean. This was well worth the trip.”
Dean swallowed hard. “You’re inviting Cas?”
“Well, that’s true. Also I can safely just call you my favorite brother, because, after all, who’s the competition? Question stands. How are you doing?”
“These are gorgeous.” Sam leaned down to look more closely at the doors. Then he moved on to the showpiece — the vent hood for over the stove. Right now it was just the frame, the shape blocked out and the centerpiece framed. The actual design wasn’t there yet. It was going to be a series of three panels — one of which was on his worktable. Sam moved along to look at it, then looked at Dean with a raised brow.
Dean sighed. “I always miss her the second she’s gone. Sam and Jess too, I suppose, but mostly Mariel.” He smiled crookedly at Cas, glad that he at least was still here.
After his circuit of the courtyard, checking that the placement of the supports all made sense with the plans he’d seen for the elaborate decorations, Dean decided to check the adjacent spaces. Most of the interior was off limits to the event staff, but there were public spaces. There were portable toilets outside for the workers, but portable toilets weren’t even remotely acceptable for the heads of industry, government, and entertainment who were on the guest list for the reception. The catering kitchens were inside as well. Anywhere that guests were permitted was going to be decorated, so the workers had permission to go inside that far, at least.
“Oh no,” Dean groaned.
“The Rusty Anchor is good.”
“It was… uneventful, in the end.”
Cas stole a glance at his laptop, where Book Two of that Alek trilogy was well underway, and pondered the irony.
They’re good stories, but he suspects they’re much better as stories than they are as events to live through.
So. No dating other Sandover employees, even if the only person he’d really wanted to date since he’d first arrived was sitting right across from him.
Cas nods slightly. Lord knows he has no idea how to sell this. Dean, however… Dean is entirely charming and has the glib tongue of a snake oil salesman when he wants to use it. He should have gone into sales rather than becoming a radiology tech. He would have been quite successful, between his extreme good looks and his engaging charm. Cas would certainly buy anything he chose to sell.
“What the hell is that?” He was proud of himself for how little his voice shook.
“Gotta tell you, one of the strangest things? Seeing the new sales associates starting fresh out of college. Was I ever that young?” Dean asked, sitting at Burger Heaven with Cas and Charlie. He dunked a trio of fries into his ketchup.
“Really?”
project the image of a secure, confident manager.
“And boyfriendy stuff. Don’t forget the boyfriendy stuff.”
“Now that I can kick ass at.”
“Yeah,” Claire said. “We’re s’posed to say what we’re thankful for.”
That gave Castiel pause. He considered his brothers, then inclined his head in acknowledgment. “It’s the principle of the matter. Having their expectations foiled. As well as making me continue to pay for my mistakes.”
Dean straightened. He took security seriously. There were a million questions starting with ‘how’ and ‘why’ and ‘when’, but the most important ones started with ‘what’. The others could be dealt with later. He raised a brow, waiting for Cas to continue.
Sam made a noncommittal sound. “Probably not. People need help everywhere. You know I’m not going into law for a high profile career. I want to be able to help people who get into situations they don’t know how to get out of, and need legal help. That’s not limited to the coasts. And… I don’t want to live halfway across the country from the only family I have. I want to be close to you and Bobby. You still like it at Sandover?”
“Been way too long since we’ve eaten here,” Dean commented, holding open the door to Burger Heaven so that Cas and Charlie could enter.
He’d never been so glad to be wrong.
“What are we playing for?” Sam asked, once they were settled around the table and the chips were out.
“Yes.”
The sculpture from Roman’s office rested on a pedestal above Dean’s head. The figure standing there touched it, leaning close, fingers caressing the egg-shaped crystal, chanting at it. As Castiel watched, the crystal began to glow, pulsing like a heartbeat, as did the sigils painted on Dean’s skin.
“Yeah. That’s something for next year, though.” Dean couldn’t help but smile at the idea that Cas was going to be here next year. “What are you doing for dinner tonight?”
“Hey, you know I’m in it for the free drinks and meals. I expect at least one excellent steak out of the deal.” And the kiss. He’s very much looking forward to the kiss.
Castiel methodically worked his way through cleaning up. Mrs. Crombie had offered to help, but he rejected the offer. He didn’t want anyone else handling his books or trying to evaluate the damage.
He turned and nodded greeting. Once he’d filled his mug and retrieved his lunch from the refrigerator, he came over to join them. “Hello, Dean. Charlie.”
“There are barbecue, Swedish, and sweet and sour. Hopefully you will both like at least one of them.” He shrugged out of his coat and hung it up in Charlie’s closet.
“Hey-o Cassie,” Gabriel said cheerfully. “Get your gifts?”
“Nope.” He hadn’t had nearly enough to drink to get into that one.
For Castiel, making the decision to stay in Caroline was easy. Moving his life across state lines without returning to Chicago? That was more difficult.
“Mm. Maybe.” She didn’t say she wished her well. No surprise there.
“You ever going to be able to tell me more about what’s really going on here?”
“Thank you, it is,” he said, his hand reflexively coming up to stroke the tie down the center of his chest. As far as Dean could tell it was an ordinary tie. Zach Adler wasn’t exactly on the cutting edge of fashion. He tended to wear black or dark gray suits with black or dark gray ties. This one was dark gray, but maybe there was some sort of a stripey pattern woven into it, that caught the light differently.
“Stainless steel and concrete, yeah. Modern industrial decor is so not you, baby bro. What are you thinking?”
“Ooookay then, no lollipops for Cassie. So. You going to tell me why you wanted to spend the night here? They’re right about the possibility of the bedding not exactly being up to snuff. Though I suppose I could check on it, maybe run them through the wash. Assuming Great Aunt Hester has a dryer here. I could see her hanging them out on the line to dry, even in the middle of winter. Having to let them thaw before she could tuck them under the mattress.”
Not talons.
Chuck pats him lightly on the back. “He’s a good guy, your Dean. I’m happy for you.”
He was standing near the door, looking in through the glass panel. As Dean watched he reached out to test the door. It was locked. Of course it was locked. There were precious objects in that room. Well, there were precious objects everywhere in the palace, but some of those in the antechamber were more precious than most.
Yeah, so he was a sap. Sue him.
Cas opened the door and sat down behind the wheel. There was something soft about Cas’ expression as he placed his hands at the classic ten and two position, adjusted the rear view mirror, and pulled the seatbelt into place. He turned towards Dean then. “I like it.”
“Castiel,” she says. “Welcome. And who is your guest?” She commands the attention of everyone in the room with an ease that Dean finds both impressive and a little creepy.
Not that there was much chance of that ever happening.
Winchester nodded. “Yeah. Yes. But I figured you might have gotten at least a bit done, right? Enough to get a first take on what it is.” He settled back in the chair with a studied casualness, but a tension in his shoulders belied the posture.
Dean looked across the bar and gave Ellen a thumbs-up. Cas followed his gaze, nodded approvingly and then followed suit.
He had to admit to himself that he was nervous. No, not nervous. Concerned. He couldn’t afford to be nervous. Nerves begat errors, and he was too experienced to succumb to nerves, even if the stakes were higher than they had ever been.
He was so lost in the work that he didn’t hear the knock on the door, or even notice it opening wider, so he was startled when someone spoke, far too close.
“I learned after I moved in with Bartholomew. The condo had a well-equipped kitchen, and I spent a great deal of time there. At first I left for classes and some study time at the campus library, but after I finished my degree there really wasn’t much necessity for me to leave, and… well, Bartholomew subtly discouraged my developing any outside interests. He was the one who suggested I write for niche journals and had various texts I needed delivered. We also had groceries delivered. Bartholomew often had business dinners, so I found myself alone for meals quite often. I got… bored, with boxed meals. So I started ordering some fresh ingredients, and taught myself how to prepare them.”
Dean looks over his shoulder, back towards the pavilion, and smiles.
“You just need to learn. And yeah, I’m sure. Hell, worst case? It’s untreated wood. Works in the fireplace. Not that it’ll come to that. Not with me as your teacher.” And oh fuck. He had to turn away quickly, reaching for the pine boards, in order to hide the flush at the unbidden images that turn of phrase surfaced in his mind. He’d definitely like to be teaching Cas a few things. Or maybe he’d be the student.
And yet he did.
Now that it was over, he was honest to God trembling.
* * *
“So anyhow,” he continued, “I’d like to treat you to lunch to thank you for the connection.” There. He’d done it. “Charlie Bradbury and I… you remember her? She was at my orientation too?”
“No, no, it’s fine. I’ll recruit some of the kids to help. That’s what they’re for, right? Free labor?” He smiles. “Go. Most everyone’s probably in the… what did Naomi call it… the blue sitting room.” He puts on a very snooty accent as he says that. “We didn’t used to have fancy names for it when we were growing up. It was just the front room. You remember where that one is, kiddo? There are too many sitting rooms in this place. It’s ridiculous when you have to distinguish your sitting rooms by color. The blue sitting room, the canary yellow sitting room, the red chinoiserie sitting room. And I say that as someone who actually grew up here.”
The next hours passed in a surreal haze. Castiel found the small wooden cart and took it, feeling a strange mix of guilt and exhilaration. By the time he returned, Dean had wrapped the remains in scraps of canvas he must have found amongst the waste in the alley, and had done his best to remove the blood. If they were fortunate there would be rain tonight. If not, they might need to return with buckets of water and nonchalantly rinse the cobblestones, hoping that no authority figures passed in their direction.
“Cas?”
Great Aunt Hester had been a neat person, but she’d been elderly, and likely just didn’t have the stamina or the eyesight to clean properly any longer.
Bela fixed him with a cold stare for what felt like forever, then finally spun on one perfect stiletto heel and stalked out of the office.
“When I was a child, I liked to come back here,” Cas mused. “We didn’t come here often, and not at all after Great Aunt Hester fell out with my parents. But I do remember coming here. There used to be a lot of frogs. I think there still may be. Sometimes, when I have the windows open and there aren’t the sounds of construction, I can hear them croaking under the birdsong.”
“Fellas.” Dean wants to hear what they think, considering how far they've helped him get.
“I figured out where I know you from!” Charlie bounces in her seat and tugs at Sam’s shoulder. He looks sideways at her. “You said your brother’s name and my brain, it just started
“I love it, I love everything,” Castiel says, his eyes still roaming over the new space.
Yeah, Dean is pretty happy.
”, a song that makes Dean’s heart thump in his chest whenever he catches it on the shop radio. His hands automatically go around Cas’ waist and they step into each other’s personal space until there’s none left, Cas dropping his forehead against Dean’s shoulder as they sway back and forth.
seem the type.
“Just knew I loved you.” Dean shrugs. “Knew I loved them. It felt right, Cas, you’ve always just felt right and it was the next step.”
“You guys can't hang out anymore.”
“Thank you,” Castiel murmurs. He had no idea what kind of life his uncle led or if there were people around town that knew him. He’s happy to know they exist. “I—we’re remodeling the store and eventually re-opening, so I hope it’s okay that you’ll likely be seeing more of us.”
it. Enjoy the feeling of the satin against your legs and the slide of it against your cock. Enjoy it Dean, because when I get back up here, I want you to tell me how it made you feel.”
He knows something shifts inside him, when Cas slips a firm hand behind his head to pull Dean into a real kiss, his lips softer than Dean could have ever dreamed. It makes him bloom, makes something inside Dean uncurl, something that’s been closed tight for a long time. Maybe forever.
“Never do.” Castiel can hear him mutter as they walk away. He glances at Dean with eyebrows raised and Dean laughs. It eases Castiel’s mind at least.
“It’s like, the coolest graphic novel out there; you’d love it Sam!”
“I used to go quite often then,” Cas says, wistful. “I’d stop in at least once a week to pick up new books for my father. That was before he passed.”
“See, that wasn't so bad, was it?”
“Why didn’t you answer my calls earlier? Why are you
Dean is serious. Castiel barks out a laugh. “Sure. Let's go to the ocean, Dean.”
And tonight, Dean’s not done taking chances.
Castiel’s already in love but now he knows this sweet kitten was meant to join their family, the three of them already misfits, the spanners of their families, the ones left to fend for themselves, the ones who found each other regardless and now, a new member to join their ranks.
“That’s Armani, darling,” Balthazar purrs as he breezes past Dean, getting his sniff on in his much more subtle way.
Now Dean's watching Cas' hand slowly slide down his body, pressing again at the softness of his belly. Sure fingers slip into the vee of Dean's hips and there's that sound again and then Cas' mouth is on Dean's neck, but his eyes are still with Dean's in the mirror. Green follows blue to watch Cas slip searching fingers into the thatch of hair around his cock, and fuck, it's like watching his favorite porn because it's Cas' gorgeous hand that wraps around him to stroke his shaft and make him moan.
The seriousness in Dean’s face makes Castiel pause and study him, Castiel noticing that Dean appears nervous, which is out of place during this otherwise festive day. Dean goes on before Castiel can ask what’s wrong.
“Don't worry Cas, she's all bark and no bite.” Dean got up and cleared plates while Ellen got dessert from the oven; a warm cherry pie that had the house smelling like fruit and butter all evening.
Dean brought him a flower. That’s not—Castiel’s never—No one’s ever given him flowers before. It’s such a small thing, a stupid thing really, to think about, but even when he
“Good morning Dean, may I ask what’s wrong?”
Cas rolls his eyes but doesn’t let Dean go. “You look handsome as well, my love. The sun did a number on your freckles today.” Anticipation dances in his blue eyes. “So many new ones to count.”
It’s quiet when the bar door closes behind them, Dean already hitting the
There’s a pair of strappy hiking sandals on the passenger seat of the jeep that’s parked out front… and they’re bright yellow. Obviously worn, but highlighter yellow nonetheless. This is Dean’s option? Walking around looking like he skinned a minion to make his shoes?
and Cas squeezes his hand and shifts close enough for their shoulders to brush together. “One thing we can thank tourism for, I suppose.”
He still tries to get a response in. “Dean, I—”
Sam wandered over and gave Castiel a high five. “I'll give you all the dirt, don't worry. Just so you know, he snores.”
Two days later, Cas walks into the office of the local Army recruiter.
A frustrated sigh escaping Cas’ lips is what caught Dean’s attention. He glanced up to see Cas leaning against the desk, a book held open in his hands, his head tilted, his brow furrowed, his deep blue eyes serious about whatever he was reading. It was like any other day but something in Dean changed in that moment.
“Ok Princess, you’re very pretty.” Charlie rolls her eyes at him and hooks their arms together to drag him outside. “I’ll spill the beans if you buy me waffles.” She pushes open the door of the studio and the sun is bright when they step outside.
You're so helpful!” Dean glared at his little brother who was smirking as he unpacked more books.
“The longer I sit here not able to do that, Dean, the more ways I imagine how I want to have you tonight.”
Castiel loves Dean. He loves Dean with every beat of his heart, and he can’t recall a time before he did. Even when it was broken, his heart belonged to the man singing next to him, the man who wants to marry him and spend their lives side by side.
“I believe I get to be the one to decide what I deserve, Gabriel. And Dean is my friend.” Castiel takes a step between them. “I told you I can handle myself. Now please, mind your own business.”
“Aye, that’s a relief. Your brother is a bit stuffy, all the times he’s come around.” She looks him up and down, appraising, and her gaze drifts above his head as if she’s looking at something hovering above him. Castiel rolls his eyes up, almost expecting to see something floating there.
The cover of
It’s their Google doc with all their date ideas. Cas—the nerd—organized it by area and yeah, they have a Stanford/Palo Alto List.
“Dean, that’s apicide!” Cas hisses back, letting go of his wrist and shooing the bee on his way. Dean’s face is one of confusion. Cas just rolls his eyes. “Bee MURDER, Dean.”
“We’re going to figure this out, I promise.”
“Oh, Dean, I’ve
They situate themselves at the head of the bed, Cas wrapped under Dean’s arm and Sam sitting cross legged, dipping beef jerky into the hummus. Cas is eating the gummy bears, occasionally feeding them to Dean (the red ones are his favorite) and they all smile when
Castiel glances down at his rainbow pin fondly. “You know you didn’t have to go to all that trouble, but it is very appreciated.” He scratches Pug’s exposed belly softly, not wanting to disturb him too much. “Pug will be very thankful when he wakes up.”
The other side of the room is now a lounge; a two person recliner faces a large flat screen next to another bookshelf that hides a dart board. Large, leafy plants spill in from the sunroom and make the new lounge area look cozy, warm twinkle lights woven around the space only adding to the comfortable feel.
Cas chokes back a half sob as he smiles. “All my dreams came true when you gave me this ring, Dean.” He grabs Dean’s hand so they can both hold the chain with the gold band between them. “If anyone ever asked me what about all of the last two days has been real, I know exactly what I’d tell them.” Raising their joined hands, Cas presses a kiss to the back of Dean’s, his eyes shining. “We are, Dean. We’re real.”
Cas whines, his mouth still full of Dean’s pulsing cock, when Dean clenches his fingers in his hair, tugging on the strands with each roll of his hips. One last, long suck up Dean’s cock and Cas pulls off, kissing the tip before coming back up to Dean’s lips so he can lick deep into his mouth.
. He knows every single person they cross paths with, greeting them as if they were old friends, sometimes with hugs or a high five, always with the right inquiring questions to make the other person smile and feel special, even if it’s only for a moment or two.
“Mmm, every night,” Dean kissed him. “Every night for the last six years, pretty sure.”
The twins are just happy to eat their cake until Jimmy wipes his face with a (also provided) napkin and clears his throat. “Claire, since your uncle is here, I think it’s a good time to talk about NYU.”
“Thank you for surprising me this morning.” He smiles at Dean, enjoying when Dean’s blush deepens. Castiel wishes he had time to count all of Dean’s freckles, but he has to settle for saying goodbye, knowing they both have responsibilities waiting. He still wants Dean to know his thoughtful act is appreciated though. “Please feel free to surprise us anytime you might want to.”
“Thank you, Dean. I uh, I like it.”
His cock is throbbing in Castiel’s mouth and he savors the taste and the weight on his tongue. He sends up a quick thought of gratitude at not having a gag reflex when he deep throats Dean, his nose buried in the coarse hair at the base of Dean's dick.
“I knew you would. Now look here,” Jonathan gets Castiel’s attention, ready to show him a few last tips for his morning routine. “I put all the important stuff here in this little basket so all you have to do is pull it out, use what you need, and just tuck it back under the sink here, see,” he demonstrates, pulling open the cabinets and showing Castiel all the space for their toiletries.
Charlie crosses her arms, an exasperated look on her face. “Enough is enough, Winchester.”
Dean makes a note to keep Cas and Charlie out of the comic book store together for a while. “You’re gonna look great in green tights, Robin,” he says with a kiss to Cas’ pout.
Castiel still can’t believe it, and he’s had over twenty-four hours to process it. “It seems like they were close though.” He clears his throat. “I’m envious, if I’m being honest.” If there was ever a time for it, it’s now.
“You guys start
Disbelief takes over both their faces. Cas is the only person Dean ever let read the letter and it's obvious to both of them that this isn't a coincidence and that maybe they’ve got an angel watching over them tonight.
“No.”
“Good, we'll make Baz help us pack since he's here.” Dean wagged his eyebrows, making Cas laugh harder.
“That was my first thought!”
Charlie nods. “Yup. And I don’t know where Cas is, he went off with Meg when we got here.” She points towards the back. “There’s a few bars set up, check those. Bring me back something pink! Oh and Dean!” He pauses and turns back to her. She’s smirking her dangerous smirk. “Cas looks great.”
“Never,” he whispers back, knowing he’d choose Cas every time.
Dean pulls Cas a little closer. “I’m sorry,” he says, just loud enough for Cas to hear him over the falls. “It never gets easy to say goodbye to someone you care about.”
“Would you like to come back to my hotel, have one more drink?”
Castiel leans over, “I thought we were going?”
“I’m fine, I’m fine Cas, I’m
“Your favorite lube is under my pillow,” Cas breathes into Dean’s ear and Dean scrambles for it, helping to pour it in Cas’ waiting hand. He sighs when Cas’ wet cock slides back against his rim and he fidgets while Cas plays, impatient.
“Okay, gross, I don’t wanna know. Forget I asked.” Dean will have to have a serious talk with Sam later, make sure he’s using condoms. He changes the subject because— it’s still gross. “Other than that, did the morning go okay?” Dean can’t outright ask if his dad was a total ass, but Jo knows what he means.
That night is the first of a countless number of dinners that Castiel will have at the Winchester home.
and damn, Dean needs to get to a gym. He gets up, wincing at the mess but finding it easy to ignore because the rest of him feels so damn good. And he loves it when Cas looks over his shoulder to make sure Dean’s coming before he slips into the bathroom. The shower starts and Dean smiles when he sees that Cas left the bathroom door open a crack, hot steam already billowing out.
The tacos here rolled and deep fried, bits of seasoned shredded beef sticking out each end and all of them smothered in cream and shredded lettuce and a bright red sauce drizzled over everything. There’s a few perfectly fried eggs on top of the lot of them too, and Dean’s stomach growls as his mouth waters. Included are a few fish tacos for each of them, sprinkled with mango salsa that Dean thinks he might actually fight someone for, they’re so damn good.
“I’d really like that.” Even if it turns out to be a bigger deal to him in the long run, Dean makes Castiel feel brave.
