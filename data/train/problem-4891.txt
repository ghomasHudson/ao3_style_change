Naomi frowns at the un-alphalike statement, but proceeds. "Well, I've been thinking. Maybe it's a medical issue. We have resources now. I'll take you to a specialist."
Castiel feels a little embarrassed. "I was advised that you probably wouldn't have fun at a high scale restaurant, so I dressed to suit the place we're going."
"Yes. You're here, and you try."
"Huh. Guess I'm hot enough to turn 'em." Dean jokes, although the weirdly vulnerable tone of the note stirs something in him.
"Not until the cage. But now that I think about it, I don't know how you had it even half as together after Hell as you did."
Castiel nodded. "I thought I wouldn't be having pups, and I didn't feel that upset. So I think I'm okay with not having any."
, I have no idea how the investigator I hired obtained this information, and I assume it's all above board." Crowley clarifies with a smirk. "But better safe than sorry, understood?"
Dean googled "
Dean sits there pouting.
"No, of course, I'm not claiming he's solely to blame. But I think he would have a lot to say about our current conversation, and I think it should just be us." Castiel says. "Dean, I want to do this for real or not at all. Will you allow me to court you?"
"...okay. And how much did you drink?"
, huh? Alright, see where that attitude gets you."
"- because he's my true mate." Castiel concludes.
It's a struggle, but things eventually improve. Naomi becomes pregnant, but stays involved with him. She encourages him to keep going to school, saying that isolating him will not help him learn to deal with people, and his psychologist agrees. Instead she sends him to self-defense courses to tide him over and keep him from getting hurt.
"Yes?" he asks, and Naomi raises her eyebrows. "You want me to buy him a
The music is a little muffled through the wall, and so he starts mishearing it, especially when he's not paying attention.
in him.
Castiel wonders if he should read it. He's trying not to think too much about his absent mate, but on the other hand he could gain some insight into Dean.
"-bounty hunting?" Dean finishes. "He knows, but I try to only tell him about the gory details if I have to. Anyway... I'm not that mad at
"In the hospital, second day." Dean says. "Actually it was kinda weird, the radio in the next room was playing a lotta gay songs -"
"You don't know anything about this, you're a beta." Naomi dismisses. "Besides, you don't get a say about my boys. We agreed!"
"...okay."
There's a silence for a long moment, and then the older woman asks "You serious?"
The man looks over to Castiel. "You look a bit too fancy to be in a place like this, causing trouble."
"Balth -"
"Because some of it is sensitive information. Now,
"I'm saying... I don't know. Watch some gay porn or something and see whether you like it."
"But... "
"I know." she smiles smugly. "But I assumed the deal was off after Castiel's coming home party, when you announced that you were -"
Dean eyes him up and down, seeing he's also wearing jeans. "You look
He missed Cas. Last he'd checked, there was no way for humans to get him from the Empty, and Jack had said he'd "work on it".
"I know you reacted well to the baby thing." Dean cuts him off. "And yeah, that was... serious surprising, don't get me wrong. But you're still the guy who brought me here against my will."
Naomi was pushed into it, he remembers. Chuck had wanted a houseful. He'd assumed when she'd mentioned that, that it meant she hadn't wanted as many kids. But maybe she hadn't wanted any? She'd said herself that her omega instincts were troubled. Maybe she'd been like Dean.
dean sets his coffee on the counter, needing both hands to rub his face as he says, "he did, did he." looks like dean is gonna have to break sam's knees now.
speaking of trying things… “hey, do you think we could finally do it in the kitchen?”
Cas tosses his head back and
of going to cas like that, i will break your knees.”
But Cas isn’t listening. The dam's busted open. “I’m supposed to— I used to be an angel. My powers, I could... I could help you, I could help Sam, but now I can’t — I can’t even
"yeah, i think he was trying to give me 'the talk.'" dean can hear the quotation marks jack puts around the words, and while his face is covered, he doesn't need to see to know that jack did the actual gesture, too. if it was any other time, dean would be suppressing a smile at the very cas-like mannerism, but right now, he's not feeling it.
hunter husbands.
“yeah,” sam says. “i understand.”
Cas’s eyes and nose wrinkle, his grin wide and gummy – it’s the first time Dean has ever witnessed Cas like this, and god, he can’t take his eyes off him. Feels his heart stutter or stop or both; it’s warm and fluttery, and only increases in intensity. Cas has such a stupid laugh, and Dean loves everything about it.
“Dean...” Cas starts to shift further away from him, and that won’t do, because he needs to listen, needs to hear what Dean’s telling him, and he won’t if he’s already sinking into himself.
Cas hums, unconvinced. He grabs the damp rag that held the ice, shaking out the remaining pieces. He doesn’t seem to care where the ice landed. "Let me?"
dean picks his coffee back up, giving a lazy salute. "you and me both, kid."
“Be still,” Dean murmurs to Cas when he flinches away again. He’s tried to minimize how much he pokes and digs, knowing what a bitch it is to be on the business end of pliers, but he can’t help that some of the shards are buried deep. He waits patiently as Cas takes a large swallow from the whiskey bottle he’s clutched like a lifeline, then Dean picks out yet another broken glass piece and drops it into the cup next to his hip.
He doesn’t say,
would fucking try that. (what the fuck was up with that, seriously?)
"Yeah, well." Dean clears his throat. "Gotta make up for all the bad shit I've done, right?"
cas sighs. “dean.”
to cas. we have three kids.”
. A lulling melody bleeds through the room from his cassette player, a woman’s voice crooning into the air:
Dean almost says no, he's fine, but something in the way Cas looks at him... "Okay."
“I love you.” The smile Cas gives him is soft and crooked and still sad. Dean’s not stupid; he knows things with Cas are rocky at best, but it’s a start. “Now turn back around so I can get the rest of the junk out, asshole.”
“Cas, man, you gotta know that it’s never been about your powers. You’re not a-a tool, Cas. All I want— It’s just you. I told you, man. I’d rather have you. Nothing’s ever gonna change that.”
"well— not exactly. he talked to me about it, but i came to you on my own."
“good. don’t ever fucking try that shit again with me. and if you so much as
Cas turns his face away. “There’s nothing to talk about.” A beat. Then, “I think you’d be better off hunting with Sam again.”
Dean didn’t bother to make it to his bed. He sits on the floor, tucked away in the shadows, the wall behind him the only reason he’s upright at all. A myriad of empty whiskey bottles litter the space around him, one that’s a measly ¼ full held in his limp fingers. The only light source comes from his bedside lamp, and the glow just barely reaches his feet.
When it seems like Cas isn’t on the verge of bolting, Dean says, “I know there's something about this case that got to you bad — don’t think I didn’t notice, man.” Hunts aren't easy, and unexpected bodies turning up are never something a good hunter takes lightly, but Cas seemed to take each one like a devastating blow. Dean tried to press Cas about it, and he shook off Dean’s worry and pretended that everything was fine. Dean doesn't have to be a good hunter to know Cas was lying. “Why won’t you talk to me?”
"sure. yeah. that sounds about right, give or take a year." he's not being entirely serious — though
Cas sighs. “I don’t deserve
sam huffs a big breath, then approaches the table, sitting across from dean. “we need to talk.”
“oh.” sam gets that deep wrinkle in his forehead when he’s thinking hard.
“dude,” dean says. “i know.”
thing that took me a while."
Dean grips Cas by the sleeve when he’s close enough, stops him from entering the station. “Dude.”
Dean tugs the rag out of Cas' hand. His mind is taking a second to reboot. But he knows — he knows he needs to kiss Cas right now. "C’mere," he mumbles and cups Cas' face between his palms and presses their mouths together. When they separate to breathe, Dean says, “It’s always you, Cas. You know that.”
It happens in the middle of the kitchen, while Dean’s preparing a pot pie for dinner. He makes a joke – tasteful, and fucking clever, in his humble opinion, if someone were to ask – and by now, he knows he’ll only get disdainful looks, but he lets himself hope for a little indulgence from the guys. Dean turns to gauge their reactions from over his shoulder, getting that very look from Sam, who’s sprawled at the table, covering the surface with books and data. Then Dean looks at Cas and wiggles his eyebrows a bit, grinning and hoping for some other response, but not expecting, because it seems that no one in the bunker shares his wit. So he’s wholly unprepared for what follows.
“nothin’,” dean answers, grabbing the full mug and inhaling the bitter aroma. it has just a touch of cream – somehow, cas knew that’s what dean wanted. “mm, you sure do know how to treat a gentleman.”
“yeah.” dean picks up his mug, and before taking a sip, says, “but thanks for noticing.”
"why is that?"
"jesus, kid," dean says. he can't help but laugh a little. "i dunno, i thought i was no good, that i didn't deserve it. pick a reason, i'm sure i had it."
“no, you’re not, you’re–” yet another breath from sam. then, like ripping a band-aid off: “dean, you’re queer.”
dean drops his arm. “excuse me?”
“urgh, fine, the deancave it is.”
15x18 coda.
Dinner is late, and this time Sam is giving his disdainful look to both Dean and Cas, who are rumpled and red-mouthed from a very thorough makeout session. They’re all happy, though, and the pot pie is delicious.
he turns to face jack. "what."
"1989."
“Yeah,” Cas says and reaches up to touch Dean’s reddened face, his smile growing crooked and fond as the blush turns darker, a softness to his eyes that makes Dean’s stomach do summersaults. “I know.”
“m’ bein’ serious.”
a companion piece to the crackfic taken seriously.
for this man, this is the moment he finally makes his move. Dean stops what he’s doing, walks over to Cas, and grabs him by the face, forgetting that his hands are covered in flour and sticky dough. Then he kisses him right on the mouth, right there in the middle of the kitchen while Dean was making dinner. (Dean also forgot about Sam still being there, didn’t even bother to hesitate before making a move. He just went for it, because the love of his life just laughed at his joke and Dean loves him all the more and needed to kiss him.)
sam gives him the puppy-dog eyes, complete with the furrowed brow. dean half-expects him to reach out and rest his hand on dean’s. “you’re queer. you like men, and… you’re in love with cas.”
Cas turns around, winces as he moves too quickly. He touches Dean’s face with gentle, hesitant fingers. There are scrapes and cuts Dean hasn’t taken care of yet, too occupied with making sure Cas doesn’t get a damn infection. Cas’ eyes grow sad; his brow furrows. “I miss— With a touch, I could heal you. I wouldn’t need you to care for me this — this way.”
Cas is shaking him awake. The heavy thing on Dean’s chest is Cas straddling him, pinning his arms down as he jerks from side to side. Cas’ eyes are blazing with cool, living light and Dean gasps with how relieved he is.
Dean gave a noncommittal grunt and tried to hide his smile.
Dean looked at him, lost, before Cas echoed hopefully, “Not it?”

Cas is turning Dean’s jaw back so he can capture Dean’s lips in a sloppy, open-mouthed kiss. His thrusts lose rhythm as he works his tongue into Dean’s mouth, and Dean happily lets him. Dean flicks his tongue against Cas’ and tightens around him and Cas loses it, trembles against Dean’s mouth and lets Dean bite his bottom lip and lap around his tongue while he cums in Dean’s body. Like it was made for him.
Dean stared up unblinking as the light grew brighter. Cas would tell him if he had to close his eyes. Cas’ wings folded around them, and Dean shivered against his lips. The electricity flowed through both of them, and Dean gasped. Cas trembled under his touch, a sheen of sweat covering him. This mixture of angel and man, eyes shining with holy fire, wings spread out but shaking as Dean touched him and moaning, it was perfect. It was Cas. I love you, he thought, not trusting his voice to carry the words.
Sam threw his arms up and did his little mouth shrug thing. “Come on, man, you went through your Elvis phase! You were a fanboy. Don’t even try to deny it,” he said when Dean opened his mouth to protest it. “I was there. I could hear you singing All Shook Up in the shower!”
“Yeah. And you, and Sam, and… uh, my Baby.” He grinned stupidly. “I’m good how I am. And this is a damn fine song, so I’m alright with it being my accidental anthem. Mostly.”
Cas is alive, he knows that much. When Jack had let Amara go and they'd stood in the middle of that suddenly-busy street, she'd cupped Dean's cheek and said, "I brought him back for you." She'd smirked, then said the following words like an inside joke from a foreign language. "Go get him, tiger." Then they'd vanished, gone off to run the afterlife and to mingle with the raindrops or whatever (although Dean had a few suspicions Amara might wind up digging Reno again soon enough).
"Hello, Dean," Cas said. His face was gentle but guarded. He was waiting.
“We’ll learn. We’ll learn how to be different, and better,” Dean promised with a hoarse voice.
“There’s nothing nerdy about it. It’s a butterfly, Dean.” Cas sighed in a way Dean could describe no other way than
His heart beat faster. “No, no, no.” He whispered to himself. “Not gonna freak out.” He walked stiffly down the empty – empty! – halls to the kitchen, where he swiftly swallowed half his stash of anti-hangover pills with a swig of whiskey.
Cas didn’t speak.
“Like this,” Dean eventually said, when he noticed Cas was still staring at the box. He brushed his hands over Cas’, guiding him through ripping the paper at the corner. “Just rip it off, man,” he said, retracting his hands and expecting Cas to follow the example. Instead, Cas gently unfolded the paper, occasionally tearing when it was necessary, but mostly unravelling the whole thing with his fingers like it was a puzzle. Not unlike how he looked at Dean when he was about to take him in his mouth, Dean thought.
Dean nodded his head once and then bobbed up and down, putting a little more pressure on the finger on Cas’ ass-hole. Cas’ head fell back and then he snapped back to attention. He set his jaw and blinked, trying to focus on the target. Dean moaned sinfully around Cas’ dick, and he saw Cas’ eyelids flutter shut.
as all the things he had felt before. It was glorious.
"Hmm," Dean said into Cas' hair. "Love you."
As he it behind him, he heard music start up, soft drums coming through the walls. He started off for the Cassette Room without a second thought. His footsteps echoed on the hallway floor, and a gentle smile spread across his lips in the dim light at the thought maybe Castiel was waiting for him after all. A joking, ‘
"Every word," Cas said, staring at him steadily.
“Vodka, tequila, sarkey.” Dean informed him as he drank. “Figured we gotta fix that. In the process you’re gonna try every kind of alcohol they got, which will probably only get you half drunk.”
Dean rolled his eyes at Cas' pained expression. "It's your super special magical trench coat, I get it. I'll help you find it later. I promise."
Cas cried out, Dean’s name on his lips. Dean nearly screamed as the angel came inside him, fucking him so hard it hurt, hot wet cum inside him.

Dean buried his head against Cas' chest where he plunged a dagger all those years ago and sobbed silently. "You sacrificed yourself for me. And you shouldn't have." Sensing Cas was about to speak from the rise of his chest, Dean thumped his shoulder. "Not because I don't deserve it. You...you showed me I do. An angel of the lord, in love with me, who’da thunk it."

"So have I," I said, high on righteousness and revelations and our sheer proximity. "And I always come back," I said, more to myself than him.
, opening Cas’ belt and unzipping his pants. The front of the black dress-pants fell open, exposing a sliver of Cas’ black boxers. (Dean had insisted that only virgins wore white ones, and that had been the start of a rather odd trip to the mall.)  Dean licked his lips as he saw that Cas was already obscenely hard, a spot of pre-come staining the front of his tented boxers.
He came hard, shooting hot come inside Cas’ ass. Cas cried out and then they were coming together, lost in waves of bliss.
They dropped the confused, slightly angry atheist off at the hospital, and just as they were about to pull out onto the highway, Sam said, “Wait. Drop me off at the bus station.”
“Right.” Sam’s eyes narrowed. “Good talking to you, Cas.” He made his way down the stairs, leaving the angel alone. He was beginning to put a pattern together. It started with eye sex, much as he hated to describe it that way, had some desperate trying to save each other in the middle and now included drinking beer in the bunker and listening to Led Zeppelin. He hadn’t thought anything of it until this morning. Something about the way Cas had talked about Dean ‘teaching him about humanity’ and the weirdly soulful way he sang along to Elvis, along with the familiar way Dean and Cas navigated each other… Sam smirked. He had a feeling a lot more Elvis was gonna be played the next time he was away.
“I understand now!” Cas’ eyes lit up, and the corner of his mouth turned up affectionately as he gazed back at Dean.
“Perfectly all right,” Castiel answered stiffly. His eyes flickered curiously to the soft folk rock crackling from the crappy stereo.
Raising his eyebrows, the young man reluctantly unfolded his arms. “You here for the horror movie?”
The road started to slope down again, and Dean realized it was a loop. A barely warm breeze skimmed his skin from the open window. He sighed, pushing his foot down on the brakes.
"Cas! Man, where are you?" He spun around, then paused, unsure whether to be confused, alarmed, or laugh his head off. "What are you doing?"
in the sparkle of sensations all through him. It stopped feeling like being tentatively invaded by some alien force, and he could sense Cas’ presence, everywhere around him, inside him. It still felt new and strange, but the familiar things were there too, like Cas’ smell of summer rainstorms, dark blue eyes and even some sense of
“How many of those have you had?” Dean asked, turning the words over and over again in his mind.
“No,” Cas said softly. “You-”
They move out of the bunker. It takes its toll on Dean, but he seems to have decided through some inaccessible logic that Cas is his
The Grateful Dead - Ripple
“Goddamnit Cas, how many times do I have to tell you to knock?” Dean muttered, futilely trying to draw the sheets up around him, to hide himself.
Omg I'm so sorry I left you guys with that cliffhanger. Ready for some confessions?! ;)
When they were back in the bunker, they both kicked their shoes off at Dean’s door. From there, it was a matter of moments before their jackets, over-shirts, shirts and t-shirts were flung to the floor and they were locked together in a kiss, bare skin brushing tantalizingly. Cas’ tongue darted into Dean’s mouth, punctuated by shallow thrusts of his hips. They had almost all week, but Dean was more than ready to get this show on the road. He undid Cas’ belt and sank to his knees, unzipping Cas’ fly and drawing Cas’ hardening cock out. He sank all the way down, feeling Cas’ dick stiffen on his tongue. He smirked, and swirled his tongue around the head before bobbing up and down a few more times. Cas’ cock was hot and heavy between his lips, stretching the flesh there wide, and Dean groaned at the feeling. His own cock was twitching and hardening, straining against the confines of his jeans. Dirty little moans were falling from Cas’ lips, and Dean wanted to memorize every sound. He pressed a palm down on himself, desperate for some friction. He watched as he took inch after inch of Cas into his mouth, watched the smooth, red flesh disappear into his mouth until he was struggling not to gag. He remembered Cas’ grace slipping between his lips, filling every inch of his body with their mingling souls. And he pulled off and said all in a rush, “I want you to fuck me.”
Dean was pretty sure Cas slipped up and cut himself once, but a flick of angel mojo later, and it was gone. Dean shook his head. Half an hour later, two sloppily cut pumpkins sat before them. Dean stood back to admire their handiwork. Cas was still by his side. Finally, Dean took out his lighter and two tealights he’d hurriedly crammed into the pocket of his leather jacket. To be honest, he was pretty sure some hippy chick Sam had banged had left them in the car – maybe during the year he didn’t have a soul, but he was trying not to think about that. He handed them to Cas, who cupped them gingerly while Dean lit them. He lowered them down into the pumpkins and heard Cas’ breath hitch behind him.
Dean’s vision whited out and he had the briefest sensation of flying, before he came to, standing in a deserted library. “Uh, Cas?”
No doubt that viewpoint was a childish one, but nevertheless, he never loved her. He loved Ben, of course. (I regretted erasing the child's memories, but he asked it of me, and so deep was I already in betrayal, I could not refuse.)
Dean came upon the angel one Thursday afternoon, sitting against the trunk of a tree. Crying. Dean was transfixed by the sight, so unexpected, so strangely intimate. He swallowed. He was intruding in every way. But how could he leave Cas like this, alone in the cold January air? The angel's arms shook even as he wrapped them around his knees. Tears slid down Castiel's face. His blue eyes stared up at the stark gray sky, as if he was desperately searching for something. Never had he seen Cas look so openly broken.
I drizzled my cock in lube, spreading it until my member was wetter than I could stand. I picked him up and he wrapped himself around me, like he had that first night. I pushed inside him, and he threw his head back, pleasure and pain warring for dominance in his expression.
Jack thinks for a moment. “It’s complicated. And Cas was always different.”
“There’s something else I have to show you,” Dean smirked, and ran a finger over Cas’ cheekbone, tracing down around his jaw before unbuckling his belt. Cas let Dean undress him, though the hunter hadn’t yet kissed him once. Cas wanted Dean, however he was and whatever he wanted. Dean let out a long breath, gaze rolling over Cas’ body. The man was beautiful. Dean pulled his own clothes off, ignoring Cas’ outstretched hands to help, and they stood facing each other, utterly naked. Dean knelt on the cold tiles. His eyes roamed hungrily from the angel’s thighs, covered in dark swirls of hair around his soft cock, up along his leanly muscled chest, pink nipples erect and begging for Dean’s attention, the delicate junction of the muscles of his neck and his collarbone, and those fucking eyes… Dean took the angel’s cock in his mouth, soft as it was, and Cas gasped. He was going to make Cas hard, and watch while he did it.
“Hey Cas,” Dean asked some hours later. “How come you keep comparing me to flowers?”
“Speaking of which, the ship leaves tomorrow. Is there any chance you could, you know, zap me back?” Sam hated to ask. But he also thought Dean should get a chance to stay by the Grand Canyon for a little while longer.
"I'd be taking advantage of you," he said, and I could hear the burn of shame in his voice, but he didn't pull away.
Dean catches sight of the curtain tearing itself apart, and fluttering across the room in tattered shreds. He comes between them, spattering ropes of cum across their chests as he cries out. He can feel his hole spasming around Cas' thick cock, and every thrust is too much, overpowering waves of bliss threatening to shatter him. Cas breathes, "Dean," and then his eyelids flutter shut and he grips Dean tight and loses himself. Dean feels hot cum spilling inside him, and gasps at the sensation.
Now, things were different. “So, you and your girlfriend are going on a demon cruise. How, um, how long?” Dean asked, staring down at the dregs of his beer.
“What does it make you feel now?” Cas asked suddenly. “You said it used to make you feel old.”
“First roses, now daisies?” Dean asked, a little bitterly.
“Yes,” he growled, kissing Cas like a drowning man might gasp for air. “Fucking yes,” he whispered into the space between Cas’ parted lips.
Bad Company - Feel Like Makin' Love
, he thinks dimly.
“If no one who wants to kill me catches up to us, I’m going to live forever. Isn’t that strange? Not once in my millennia of existence have I thought that way. Mortal things, they’re born, and they light up like a fire, and they change and make mistakes and they live and they die. I’ll just be here. Watching the universe until it ends, I guess.” Cas let out a soft laugh. “Strange.”
, and that provided for at least the possibility that letting go could be all right.
here, and they were
Dean’s resolve to trash the cassettes for the second time softened.
“I mean it was more so you didn’t have to be forced to hang out with a schmuck like me,” Dean says lightly, but he means it.
The angel finally looked up, hair rumpled and a steely glint in his eyes. “So touch yourself.”
Cas smiled. “Yes, I suppose so.”
“Dean.” It’s Jack. He’s smiling, but a little more sadly now. Like someone who’s grown up, Dean thinks, his stomach turning. “You don’t need to apologize.”
“Dean, tell me about love.” Jesus, did Cas spend every moment of silence thinking up questions Dean didn’t know how to answer? Dean knew he spent too much of the silence staring at Cas. Anyway, he figured he owed it to the angel to try and answer his impossible questions. But God, this one?
“OK,” Dean announced when there was a visceral pile of pumpkin seeds at their feet. “Now you’re gonna cut a design through the outside. Like this.” He started cutting a pentagram without quite meaning to. “Er, it can be whatever you want.”
There were other words in between too, like
Now, Dean stared at the angel. “Jesus Cas, why didn’t you say something?”
“Come on. We’re not done yet,” Dean growled, and pulled Cas away. Cas was grinning, and Dean made a private vow to try and make that stupid smile pop up as often as he could. Jesus, his life was becoming such a chick flick. They left the pumpkins blazing. The farmer would probably think someone had been summoning Satan in his pumpkin field – Dean smirked.
Sam raised one eyebrow, and Dean shut up. Right. He’d probably have to stop saying that now.
“So what was it? Why you needed me?” Cas’ voice is a thin, precarious thing, unbefitting for an angel.
Instead, he undid Cas’ belt, sliding the angel’s jeans down and throwing them in a heap in the front seat. Cas’ boxers followed, until he could see all of Castiel, spread out before him, from the stupidly ruffled hair to his erect cock. Dean swallowed. He’d never done this before, but that was Cas, and that made it… profound, he guessed.
My love is strong, here there is no wrong
a little on his heels? His brother might tower over him, but just then, he looked like a little kid.
Cas thought for a moment. “No. But I found a different one.” He knelt down, knees brushing the dirt as he righted some plant growing waywardly in the dirt. “A faith in small things; like humanity. I think that’s the point of this temple. To restore faith from the roots up, if you’ll have it.”
Dean stayed silent. Every fibre of him was ready for something bad to happen. “I don’t answer because, well, I want to.” Castiel bit his lip. “I want to answer you, Dean, and that’s the problem.”
"How can
“You think of anyone in specific when you were, uh, singing Can’t Help Falling in Love With You?” Sam’s mouth quirked at his ridiculous question. It wasn’t his fault his brother was an ass and he had to do recon on his behalf. They did have a ‘profound bond’.
He finally spoke, and set the glass down with shaking hands. "I'm sorry."
“Oh, Dean,” Cas moaned, long and low as Dean grasped his cock, which stood between their stomachs. He started jacking it mercilessly, and Cas watched as Dean’s fist glided over every inch of his penis.
“Man, I don’t think I even know how to play,” Dean said then, his mind fumbling through memories. There were only so many places you could hide in a tiny motel room, he guessed. Sometimes Sam would hide from him, under the bed or behind the shower curtain, but it was usually more of a protest to something and less of a game.
“You found your faith again?” He stumbled. He felt almost… what was this churning in his stomach? It was something petty and stupid, he knew that. He’d thought he and Cas had made each other better. Wasn’t some weird enchanted temple-greenhouse the angel hadn’t told him about kind of cheating?
“You’re almost better now,” Cas informed him, voice gravelly with morning.
In the middle of that revelation, an idea struck him. He stopped the car outside a podunk used junk and antique shop, brakes screeching slightly. “Stay in the car. I need to get something and then we’ll stay at the motel down the road.”
Comin' Back To Me, by Jefferson Airplane
He sunk down onto the grass, which smelled just like real grass in summer. He let the earth hold him and the sun warm him and closed his eyes. Bees droned somewhere out of sight.
He shook his head, as if to get rid of the tears, but they were soon replaced. "I really need you," he whispered, "To open your eyes." He felt everything slipping away from him as he said it, his forehead coming to rest on Cas' shoulder. He was begging, holding up his last piece of faith and crying to the wind,
“Dreaming’s part of being human. Come on, what could go wrong?” Dean forced a wide smile. “Meet me in the cassette room in ten.” Gulping, he left the room and rummaged through the storage room for what they’d need. Candles, sage, a nasty looking dagger, pillows and an enchanted cat skull. What was he getting himself into? Somehow, though, he just had to know what Cas would dream about, if he could.
Dean Winchester's never been much of one for surrender. Probably because to him, everything is a do or die situation. Surrender means giving up. And he, well, he fights tooth and nail, every time, even when he doesn't want to. Surrender means adding a handful of sleeping pills to that glass of whiskey before bed. All he's got going for him is being stubborn, when it comes right down to it. It's why he doesn't like Sammy trying to get him to go all touchy-feely with crap and make him talk it out. That'd be like lowering a wall in his head and letting someone else in. Like ceding territory or something, because every day life is a war.
Dean didn’t have to think about it for too long. Cas knew the most intimate secrets of his soul, his vulnerabilities, his broken spots. This wasn’t such a big thing, in the face of all that. “Remember when Zachariah zapped me to the future, the one where Sammy said yes and I didn’t? The one we stopped?” Cas nodded once. “I never told you, did I? You were, ah, you were human. And you were a serious hippy,” Dean tried to laugh, but it came out wrong. “I mean, orgies, drugs, the whole shebang.” He looked away. That explanation could have gone about a hundred times better. “I guess I just didn’t want that to happen to you here.”
seemed like more of a lie every time I tried. Instead, I said, "I chose this. I chose you."
He would leave in an hour's time, I knew. Prepare for the dawn. I stared at the broken guitar in the corner, and thought perhaps it was true. And I fell asleep to his heartbeat, for the last time.
“Right. Okay. Good. Great. Sorry, then, about that.” His voice is clipped, and he’d sworn he was going to be better to Cas, but he couldn’t help it. He felt like he was about to cry.
Cas tried. He really did. Dean could see that, even as he laughed his ass off. Cas glared at him, nursing multiple lacerations on his palms from the fishing hook. “It’s unnecessarily complicated.” Dean, though, was pretty sure Cas did it on purpose when he cast into a nearby tree. Dean had eventually tried manually straightening Cas’ shoulders, positioning his hands the right way on the rod, ignoring how the angel lookedDean sighed. “All right, go sit in one of the chairs, I’m gonna set you up.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean muttered. He spent a few moments searching for the right one. “There you are, baby.” With a click, it slid into the right slot and guitar strings started to ring out. “All right. Go over there, and stand in the sunshine. Just let go.”
Dean considered telling him that if the chair wasn't charcoal right now, Cas would still be in a coma. Instead, he said, "I'll build you another one." How hard could it be?

“Cas?” Dean asked, a little confused.
Cas paused. “You don’t remember me rebuilding you, do you?”

“Of course,” he murmured. “They change color every year. I never thought about it before.”
, sitting in front of him, singing Elvis. It felt just as real as it seemed unbelievable. But no matter how it felt or how it seemed – it just was.
Dean rubbed self-consciously at the hickey on his throat. He could never quite bear to tell Cas not to leave marks. The air was cool on the back of his neck, and thick with the smell of summer. “So, things with Eileen are good, then?”
Except for how he was fucking burning to kiss Cas every time his damn blue eyes lit up. Dean wasn’t very good at this whole love thing, and was pretty sure that sex was the only surefire way he knew how to express it. But Cas was… Cas was an angel, and he wasn’t even sure if Cas felt things that way. He sure as hell didn’t want to make a move if Cas didn’t want him to. Cas had said that he wanted to, and that that was the problem. Which frankly hadn’t made any sense. And then Cas he’d said he fucked up everything good. That he could relate to. He didn’t know what to do, what he even could do. The guitar sang lightly now, high and resonant. Dean sighed and closed his eyes.
"Right," he said, and he looked so defeated that I frowned.
As his head started to spin, as he sank to his knees when his legs were unable to hold him, as he thought there was every chance he could die like this, absorbed in the ecstasy of the moment –
Cas smiled faintly and crossed the room. When he came up to Dean, hesitantly reaching out his arms to encircle Dean, Dean caught him by the shoulders, spun him around and wrapped his arms around the angel instead. He buried his face in Cas’ neck, closing his eyes and planting a single kiss there. A silent, tiny confession.
He turned away, and didn't say anything. I sensed that the moment was slipping away into that magical place Dean likes to keep things he can't think about - denial. I didn't want that. I could let this be forgotten, and have everything go back to as normal as it had ever been, or I could succumb to this magnetic force between us, could say what hit me like a lightning flash.
“What? No!” Dean said, much in the same tone he’d used while insisting ketchup was a vegetable. “I mean, we’re not gonna dress up and go door to door asking for candy.” If he hadn’t known better, he’d have thought Cas looked a little put out at that. “But that’s not what Halloween’s about. Follow me.” He parked the par expertly before stepping out into the cool street. It seemed pretty quite, but then it was a damn small town. The teenagers were probably having dodgy parties and the kids were in bed by now. Cas followed him without question as Dean cut through someone’s back yard, through a row of trees and into a field.
Cas' eyes - Christ, they were so deep, their glimmers like sparks in the ocean blue, he'd almost forgotten they looked like this - flickered with something sad. "Pain," he said. "Freely given." And Dean thought of begging, praying, offering everything he had one last time. That fit the bill, he supposed.
Cas laughed. “We did just do marijuana and have sex in the back seat of your car.”
“I always hear your prayers.” Cas let a half-smile play across his lips.
"I miss you," he said, scarcely realizing he'd spoken. He blinked. Cas remained still, like a rumpled soldier carved out of marble. "Fuck," he said as a tear slid down his nose. He hadn't cried for months and now, this? This day, like any other, was when he chose to lose it?
Reluctantly, he untangled himself from Cas’ embrace, and walked to the cassette desk. “Realized I’d never played you The Rolling Stones,” he muttered. He bit his lip. Was the saddest love song he knew really such a good idea? But somehow, it felt like the right thing. He pressed play. When he turned around, Cas was standing face to face. Dean’s eyes travelled up and down the angel’s naked body. “I was thinking,” he began. “I’ve been teaching you about human stuff. Or trying, anyway.” Cas nodded. “You know what we did last night?”
“Okay.” Cas’ hands fall back to his sides.
“It’s OK,” Dean said. Because it was. He’d take this over a thousand Nicholas Sparks movies with ice cream afterwards. The tear that was running down his cheek: it was OK. This
Dean didn’t know why he couldn’t bear to say it back. God knows he meant it, and wanted to say it, desperately. He’d prayed to Cas, told him a thousand times by now, along with whatever shit he mumbled in his sleep. But whenever he opened his mouth to let the actual
“I’m the man,” he said dumbly, lost in the lyrics. “Asking. Cas, you better be coming back, you sonofabitch…” A sob worked its way into his throat, making his chest ache. “Why didn’t you tell me you were goin’?” He asked, staring at the light beams filtering through the dust of the room, voice almost inaudibly soft.
Well. You can't kill God...but you can teach him what we dream about.
Cas sat down on the bed, and ran a hand over Dean’s forehead. Dean let his eyes flutter closed. “Let me get you some water,” Cas said, and cold air swept in where his hand had rested. Dean sighed. He kept his eyes closed, the brightness of the room too much for him, listening to Cas’ footsteps in the hallway. Cas returned after a few moments, and propped Dean’s neck up under a firm hand, tipping the cold glass to his lips. Dean lapped up the water weakly, and he felt himself falling, falling away no matter how firmly Cas held him.

“You’re supposed to count,” Cas said.
“I think you should drive faster,” Cas suggested. “I’d like to explore the possibility for pleasure at home.” Dean swallowed, trying to ignore the twinge the words sent through his cock, and pushed his foot down on the gas.
“You rehearse this or something?” Dean asked weakly.
“Dean,” he replies, voice low. The confinement of his jeans is night on unbearable, but the denim seam running against his cock feels somehow bad and good at the same time.
Dean took his brother’s meaning to be,
It was close, so close to when it all fell down, when I came to him. I didn't intend to hand him a 'ransom note', as he put it. I didn't mean to drive Crowley's point home. I came to beg him for the trust I deserved. It broke me, standing there in the moonlight of Bobby Singer's living room, that he didn't trust me, after everything. Of course, I was wrong, and should have listened. That's beside the point. I thought, when I shattered, it must have been so apparent it was written all over my face. He was so lost in his own anger and misery he didn't notice. How had we gotten here, I asked myself? I knew, and it was a treacherous road I still couldn't believe led here.
Dean gulps. He can't say a word. They all sound wrong. Cas seems to understand, and Dean reaches for the buttons of his own shirt. Cas' hands knock them away, and the angel fumbles at Dean's buttons, licking his lips when the bare expanse of Dean's chest is revealed. With two fingers, Dean reaches out and slides the trench coat off of Cas' shoulder, watching it crumple to the floor. Cas throws Dean's shirt into some distant corner before doing away with his own. Dean lets his gaze roam over Castiel's leanly muscled torso, and Cas comes back to him, letting their bare skin touch. Dean lets out a low groan, and his jeans are much too tight. Cas pushes him back against the wall, and Dean's eyes fly wide.
It snows and Dean and Castiel enjoy a little Bad Company ;)
He walked up to the Bunker door, and stared for a brief moment at the roses which had sprung up around it. They hadn’t been there this morning. He didn’t pay them much attention then – although in the years to come, he watched Cas water them every morning – because Cas wasn’t waiting for him when he opened the door.
“I don’t like it.” Cas said shortly. He contemplated Dean’s words, eyelashes fluttering as he blinked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8e6VZTDBvs
He let out a low moan and heard Cas sigh in response. Dean now shoved the waiting finger inside of Cas. Cas gasped, and Dean thought it had probably hurt, but he was giving as good as he was getting. He didn’t even get a chance to search for Cas’ sweet spot, because the second he thrust his finger inside Cas, Cas was coming down his throat, salty release spurting inside his mouth. Dean did his best to keep his lips tight, thrusting his finger in and out as Cas thrust into his mouth.
Dean blinked at it. “Did I...pray too hard?”
“Of course, Dean.” Cas answered. His voice was gentle, like ocean waves lapping at the shore.
“And you said my jokes weren’t funny.” Dean lifted it up so Cas could see, a gracefully lethal knife, with a dark mahogany handle carrying the word
Shrugging on his leather jacket, Dean headed up the stairs. He was pretty sure Castiel was on the roof. Cold air bit into his cheeks as he opened the door to see Cas’ back to him. The angel was staring up into the night sky.
It took me a few moments to realize he was saying something. "Sammy... Sammy said yes, Cas. Devil's riding his bones," he managed with a stuttering laugh. I closed my eyes. "I was meant to protect him. Dad always said to." His words were broken, choppy, and I wished more than anything that he would stop talking. "I fucked up. Fucked up bad, Cas."
“What about a spatula?”
And as if the swirling flood wasn’t bad enough, a whirlpool formed in its wake;
“Dean!”
Dean cries packing his stuff (not much) to go to the new house. He jokes about Sam crying like a sissy once he finds out they’re gonna tear out the white picket fence. Sam wants to tell him he was upset on his way to Stanford, too, but that it didn’t make it the wrong choice. Stanford’s still a bit of a sore spot, though, so he doesn’t. Dean cries in the car on the way to the house.
“Right.” There was a click and the other end of the line went dead. Dean put his phone down with a soft sigh. He laced his fingers together and thought for a few moments.
He flicks Cas’ ear, and is rewarded with the unexpected sound of Cas’ laughter. He’s happy. He has a family.
his fingers gripping the angel's tie. Cas had closed his eyes, though. While Dean had carried him over the threshold, they'd fluttered closed and stayed that way.
“Alright,” Cas says, uncomprehending. No doubt thinking it’s an illusion.
Dean fell to his knees in front of Cas and cupped his hands fiercely on either side of the angel’s face, because
"I know." Cas answered. "But you sat in it and read to me, and I wish you hadn't burnt it."
Somewhere in the afternoon, Dean built a fire in the frankly oversized fire-place, and they sat in front of it and watched it blaze. Sam and Dean traded anecdotes, with Cas occasionally chipping in what he could. The life of a divine soldier wasn’t particularly festive.
on it. Dean had said he wanted one months, maybe years back in jest.
“Thanks,” Dean said sardonically. His head spun with Cas’ monologue; beautiful, confusing, increasingly strange and poetic.
Sam had that shit-eating grin again. “Cas was gonna make you breakfast in bed.”
“Good. Now, hold this,” he said handing Cas a blue fishing rod. The angel looked at it like it might explode at any moment.
Nothing Else Matters, by Metallica
before Cas yanked it away and started flipping through the pages.
“Dean, are we going to kill the fish?” Cas asked, nostrils flaring in sudden suspicion.
Cas still was silent, and Dean dropped his hands all of a sudden. He felt exposed, emotions roiling in his stomach. “Fuck,” he said softly. He wanted to curl into a ball and pretend he hadn’t just dumped his guts in front of Cas.
“Don’t be sorry for this, Dean. Never be sorry for this. We’ve changed each other, you and I. And this is a mark that we belong together.”
We stayed still for a moment, treasuring the solid feel of each other. This, I thought, could be the last time I touched him. Life was unpredictable, fleeting. Even as he pulled away to drive, his hand lingering on mine for that last second, we were readying ourselves for the end.
Cas plucked another chocolate out of the bag, testing eagerly to see if it had been a fluke. Dean opened a can of beer and took a swig, closing his eyes. “See, I was reading the other day… and it turns out that Shared States spell we did was a little less of a one time thing and a little more of a bridge.”
what had he said to Castiel in his sleep? “How’d you get to be so good at all that?” He waved a hand minutely. “Y’know. Human stuff. Taking care of people.” He frowned, wishing he hadn’t spoken.
“There’s… there’s one more thing.”
Dean wasn’t sure what sparked the Tom Petty reference, but it seemed to strike a chord with Cas. “Look, man. I can’t claim to know much about… well, anything to do with feelings. But if you like, I can teach you what I know about being human.” Cas’ chin lifted slightly. “I’m not good at it, by any stretch. But maybe it’ll help you figure out… stuff.” He trailed off lamely.
Cas stilled. “Yes. How did you know?” Neither of them dared move for a moment, until Dean sank down onto the bed next to Cas.
Dean yanked his fingers out, desperation over-ruling his previous desire to take things slow. He slicked himself up with lube, groaning at the sensation and struggling not to fuck into his own hand. Cas licked his lips. The guy thought he was getting off the hook. Dean smirked in the near darkness. He had no idea how many times Dean was going to take him to the edge before finally letting him come. He lined himself up and pushed inside Cas in one smooth movement.
The poem is Sunflower Sutra, by Allen Ginsberg. It's wonderful, and I must confess I discovered it only through a variety of other fics who referenced it. Thank you, more literary fanfic authors than I!
Cas pulling him up to a sitting position, straddling the hunter's legs. The pine tree branches pushed into their hair as Cas kissed him, quick and not deeply enough. "Dean," Cas whispered in his ear. "Seeing as this is likely to be our last night alone together-" Dean didn't ask why Cas was so sure Sam would be back in time. "I want to touch you." Cas still hadn't gotten the hang of dirty talk, and Dean made a mental note to fix that sometime. "Want you to make love to me, Dean." The words might be awkward and old fashioned, but damn if they weren't having the desired effect. Dean felt himself growing hard under the angel's thighs. "Want to scream for you." Dean's jaw dropped. Maybe he'd been wrong about the whole dirty talk thing.
Cas closed his eyes against the frustrating pleasure, but did as Dean bid. “My, ah, heart beats faster. I feel... light inside. Boundless. Maybe like my chest might explode.” He let out another broken cry as Dean rutted up against him. Dean was careful to listen to what he was saying, to look him in the eye as he talked. This wasn’t just about sex; how could it be?
Soon after Sam's sacrifice, Dean ran into Lisa Braeden's arms, and all was forgotten. Or so I thought. I often wonder what would have happened if Sam hadn't made him promise to live 'the apple pie life', as they called it. What if I had told him I planned to stay on earth, stay by his side, instead of becoming heaven's new sheriff? Would I have claimed the shotgun seat in the Impala, comforted him through his grief?
“You just need practice,” Dean insisted, remembering that one time Cas had popped up in his fishing dream. Thank God it had only been a fishing dream. When Cas was silent, lips showing only a slight pout, Dean gave in. “Fine, fine. I’ll fish. You go.” Cas smiled and relegated the bemoaned fishing rod to his chair and taking off his shoes.
Sam had left telling him it wasn't a two man job anyway and one of them should stay with Cas. Dean had opened his mouth, not sure what he was about to say, before Sam had cut him off with, "It should be you. That stays, I mean."
“But do you?” He desperately didn’t want Cas to say yes. But maybe the truth of it was that for an angel, a wavelength of celestial intent, nothing felt quite as intimate as the sort of thing Cas had described. It only stood to reason, that physical beings like humans would seek physical intimacy, but maybe for angels it was totally different. He tried to remind himself that Cas wasn’t exactly a regular angel.
Cas laughed a little, and Dean tentatively stroked his wing again. Cas whimpered into his shoulder. “
“It still feels like…” he paused, not wanting to worry Cas. “It feels like part of your grace is still inside me.” He’d realized a few moments ago, slumped against Cas and listening to his heartbeat, that the reason he didn’t feel some tremendous sense of loss was because some spark of Cas’ grace was still firmly lodged in his chest, smoldering gently.
“Stupid sonofabitch,” Dean growled when he found Cas. The angel was standing on the bottom of the lake, water coming up to his neck, still fully clothed. “What the hell, Cas?”
“It’s fine, Cas. I mean, I guess dreaming might be like getting high for you.” He smiled, wondering why Cas looked pretty much like he had back in that brothel. He laid out the candles in a circle, put the pillows on the floor, arranged the other ingredients and shut the door, although they were the only ones in the bunker.
“Oh.” Cas looked almost crestfallen, like he’d been anticipating engaging in some new courtship ritual with Dean.
Dean started to pray. He grit his teeth.
They lay like that together, ignoring the hot, sticky liquid between them, Cas’ wings wrapped firmly around Dean.
“Screw you,” Dean responded, turning away and smothering his face in the blanket. A moment later, a hand alighted on his shoulder,  Cas’ long fingers pressing gently down through the material of his worn black t-shirt.
Cas pulled away, slightly, blue eyes cast towards the floor.
“You should try it sometime,” she’d said lightly, before waving her hand to banish him.
Dean shudders at the phrase, and it’s a lovely thing. Castiel wants to see it again. “I kissed you
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas says, “Dean.”
My trenchcoat was burnt to a cinder by a grenade in a Croat raid gone wrong. After that, I sat on the edge of his bed.
There it was again. The silence that beat like a heart,
The shot rang out and struck once more in the center of the bullseye. Slightly miffed, Dean trailed his hands down and up under Cas’ shirt, tracing over the bare skin of his stomach. He felt the curves of Cas’ lean muscles, up, up, counting each one of his ribs and dipping the pads of his fingers into the hollows between them. Cas’ eyes had half-fallen closed, but they shot open when Dean pinched his right nipple. Dean let out a low laugh and gave the same treatment to the other bud of flesh. Cas set his jaw as Dean touched his nipples, feather-light, teasing. “Shoot,” Dean murmured again, and watched as the bullet made a hole just to the left of center. “Not bad, Cas. But I’m only just getting started,” he said, his voice a low promise.
Oh, oh, break it!
Cas’ brow puckered and he clasped his hands, letting them lie still. “I don’t understand.”
“What?” Dean said with a quirk of his lips, threading the floss through the needle. “You’re gonna wanna drink more of this,” he gestured to the whiskey.
The small word took Dean by surprise. Cas had always been interested in anything Dean said they should do. “What, why?”
That fucking song. Cas isn’t going anywhere, he always had to tell himself when the classic rock rudely awoke him. But maybe it was from all the times Cas had vanished into thin air, leaving Dean to wonder what that pulling sensation in his chest was. It seemed only inevitable that Cas would leave again someday, even if he didn’t want to believe it. He felt like they’d built something with their lazy afternoons at the bunker, showing Cas music and going for drives. Dean swallowed. Maybe he’d fucked that up when they kissed.
Cas slammed their lips together again, and Dean braced himself against the wall of the goddamn Grand Canyon with one hand above Cas’ head, before licking his way inside Cas’ mouth. A wave of fire rolled from the tips of his toes to his ends of his hair, and not some metaphorical fire of lust, a wave of hot, burning, electric
so he has to
He failed. Though he tried, I could feel the pent up emotions in the taut muscles of his back, could see all he didn't want me to see in the shadows of his eyes. Nothing we did could ever be wrong or impure. He tried to hurt me, for all the ways I hurt him. He ground against me too hard, too fast, holding a finger to my lips and ordering me to be quiet. He didn't need to tell me, of course. He didn't want the others to know what we were doing and I didn't want them to know I was here. This moment in the night was our privacy, closeness even through the gulf between us.
“The talking or the drinking?” Cas asked. The angel looked pretty smashed by now. He’d kept ordering more shots of whatever drink he thought was ‘chemically unstable’.
Cas pressed his lips against Dean’s, and god, Dean could
“Dean, if you try to tell me that was purely for educational purposes, I will use the Enochian curse reserved for liars. You don’t want to know what that does.” Cas raised a single eyebrow.
“Hot chocolate,” Dean muttered. He walked to the window. “You’re telling me that’s all that happened.”
Dean blinked. “What the fuck, Cas?!” His wheels were turning on sand, and he slammed on the brakes.
Hearing. The sounds of them breathing, just slightly out of time. But also his heart thumping along, and was that… Cas’ heart. Perfectly in time with his. Blood rushing through their veins in sync. Dean’s eyes widened at the realization.
“Uh, okay. What?” Dean swung his legs over the bed, so he was facing Cas’ back.
Cas cleared his throat. “Is this about your… hook-ups?” The word sounded foreign and horrible on his tongue, and he avoided Dean’s gaze. “Do you want-”
“Terrestrial intimacy?” Dean asked, one eyebrow climbing higher.
"All right. Driving at night... and I mean just driving, not because you're rushing to save the world or just got another cut that needs stitched, not because you pissed some girl off and she chucked you outta the house... Just driving. It helps me think. It's just so damn peaceful. I thought it might be up your alley." The engine was still purring. He realized he was waiting for Cas' acquiescence before he started to drive.
“Fuck,” Dean whined at the loss of Cas’ fingers. He felt so damn empty. God, he could barely stand not being able to see Cas. He couldn’t feel him, either. Dean could have been alone on the bed, sweating and hard. As he heard the lube bottle open again, though, he knew he just had to wait. He pictured Cas sliding a slick hand over his penis, eyelids fluttering shut at the sensation.
Castiel walked the length of the shore, sometimes disappearing behind bends. He’d taken off his trench coat, leaving it folded at Dean’s feet. On any other day, Dean might have felt strange about watching him this intently. But there was something oddly innocent, charmingly human about the way the angel dipped his hand in the water, wind ruffling his hair. Whenever he noticed Dean watching, Cas smiled and Dean waved. Maybe if someone else had been there, he would’ve startled out of the trance, made some comment about what a dork Cas was and drank some more beer. Dean realized with a start that being alone with Cas made him drop his walls. Uncomfortable with the revelation, he took a swig of ice cold beer.
Cas’ eyes opened wide in surprise. “Dean,” he said, voice muffled with chocolate. Dean waited for a few moments while Cas stared at their hands with a small, confused smile. “I can taste it.”
“You’re not driving,” Cas said as authoritatively as he could in his inebriated state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VFBe75ghUg
He thought. Cas had been right. He smiled to himself as he walked along the halls, checking all the rooms on the left side of the corridor first. He’d get the ones on the right side on the way back.
that he couldn’t help but thrust up. Cas was still so unbelievably tight, he thought he might explode there and then.
Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah, yeah, yeah.
“Dean, that’s the truth.” Cas frowned.
Cas pulled out fully before thrusting back in. Dean moaned at the sweet, wet ecstasy of it. One of Cas’ hands came up to rub at Dean’s nipple, and Dean fell apart. “Fuck, Cas, yes. Angel.” Cas nearly purred at the stupid nick-name, and started fucking Dean in earnest. “Fucking love this,” Dean admitted recklessly. And there it was. The final, tattered shred of the elaborate tapestry of denial he’d woven for so man years.
Dean pulled Cas to him, and kissed him roughly. Too many words. Everything was too much. Dean turned so their torsos were pressed together, and Cas drew the hunter into his lap. They kiss hotly, teeth occasionally connecting. After all the things that have been said, Dean wanted to make everything but the present go away. Everything but the here and the now, him and Cas. It wasn’t long before they’re hard and rocking against one another. Dean didn’t question it when Cas snapped his fingers and the music turned off, leaving a pregnant silence.
Cas sighed. “I’m aware of the basic mechanics, Dean.”
Dean took a step closer. “You explained once that angels aren’t hardwired to feel, they’re just meant to be soldiers. And I’ve seen your wings, your grace. You’re full on divine essence of holy fuck, you know? But you… feel things…” he blinked. Those words didn’t come too easily to him either. “More deeply than anyone.”
“Yes.” Cas answered stonily, before his lips gave way to a smirk.
“Just listen. Because nothing is good. Your little hunter, he suffers. And this is all because of you.” Darkly the voice of the empty whispered in his ear. Starring into the darkness he couldn’t pull himself away and listened.
Castiel could feel the empty smile aside of him.
The empties hands laid down on his shoulders. “Why don’t you ask him?”
“You stupid little angel.” Dean whispered.
“Dean…” the angel’s voice soft, longing but still confused. Cas wondered if he really heard what he heard.
Gulping, only slowly the truth came to him. He had been so happy to be able to tell him, to save Dean. He had been calm and his heart had been so full of love, that he hadn’t thought of the rest. Dean might become stronger, knowing who he really was. Knowing that he was worth it, that he deserved to be loved. But humans still feel loss. But still.
Castiel's side.
A sudden sob from behind him, let him turn. But there was nothing than blackness. Then he heard his name. He knew the voice, better than any other.
Tears again started to fill Dean’s eyes. Helpless Dean shook his head again.
“You didn’t think I would let you off the hook easy, did you?”
Trembling he took another deeper breath. His voice only a whisper, spoken into the empty room, without a respond. Hopeful but lost.
“Dean?” He looked around but couldn’t see anybody.
“You left. He is still down there, in the dungeon where you left him.”
“What are you saying?” Even that Dean already suspected what would happen, he didn’t want it to be true.
He never knew what had happened when he died. How should he have known? Sure, he thought that Dean might be sad for a moment. They still were best friends, weren’t they? But Dean had always buried his feelings, never let himself drag down. And only once, years ago, Castiel had seen Dean cry. The world was ending, like it did now. But Dean had become stronger… so why would he cry like this?
Then the sobbing stopped. Castiel turned, to the darkness where the sound had come from.
“Are you really here?” The hunter asked and Castiel nodded. It felt real, he had escaped the empty again. Or didn’t he?
But with the empty, the regret and suffering came back. Slowly his heart began to fill with sorrow and worries he wondered where they even came from.
His fingers stroke through his hair again and he took a deep breath, trying to shove away the heavy weight on his chest. It didn’t move.
And Castiel listened. Tears slowly starting to fill his eyes. He had wanted to save him, to let him know how beautiful he was inside. He had wanted to make him stronger. Why did his good intention always fail to help? Cas had been okay with dying for him. He hadn’t thought it would break Dean that much. And he still couldn’t make out why.
Wrapping his arms around his knees, he pulled his legs closer, trying to comfort himself, hiding behind them from the world. A world that without Cas just felt as empty as the place the angel would be now.
“Is this really true?”
Dean’s voice, so broken.
Another shaking breath went through his body when he wasn’t able to hold back the tears building up again deep down inside him anymore. Letting his head fell on his knees his vision got blurry again.
“What happened? Is he okay?”
“Maybe…” he could hear Dean’s voice. “What if…” The angel’s shoulders fell. Dean’s voice sounded so lost. Hopeless. Broken.
“Listen.” The empty whispered darkly.
The empty’s voice still rang in his ears when he stumbled out of the blackness. Still confused, the angel looked around, being back in the dungeon of the bunker.
Searching for Dean’s eyes, the hunter returned his gaze. Insecure, fearful, but also longing. Dean’s heartbeat rose. He could feel the breath of the other man on his skin. Fighting down the impulse to push the angel away. He had done it before, every time they had hugged, he had broken the connection out of fear. He had pushed him away. But he didn’t want to anymore.
When the black glue started to move around his legs, Castiel laid both hands around his hunter’s face. Moving his head nearer, he could feel the cold running up his body. Soon the empty would have consumed him again.
Dean was crying. This sound alone shattered the angel’s heart.
Words nearly silently came to him. When Dean opened his eyes, Cas was gone.
“How can you just leave me like this?”
Another breath, less deep and more shaken escaped his mouth. The tears just didn’t want to stop, so he let them go.
“What if… I love you too, Cas.”
“What is this?” he asked before he regretted it. Before the empty answered he could have thought that it was only a game she played with him. But he already knew better.
Only his words echoed in Dean’s mind. Could he really be worth it? Had he really done all for love?
“Maybe.” His lips formed toneless words. “What if…”
Clinging more on to his legs, his whole body shook from another sob and for a moment, his thoughts went dark. Lost. Left. Alone.
Still, it broke his heart to hear Dean sobbing again.
“Dean is strong. He will be okay soon.” More trying to convince himself, he tried to shovel down his own feelings. He would never be able to go back to him. And no matter how much he loved him, he would never see him again. But at least, Dean wouldn’t know this kind of pain. He might have lost a friend, but Dean had lost friends before. He would make it through it and at least, he would be alive. He still would have his brother. He won’t be alone.
“Why did you do this?”
“I am sorry, Dean.” He heard Cas’s voice the next moment. Releasing the hug his eyes had got asking again.
He just had him back. He already had taken Cas for granted again. The angel, who was always there when he needed him. The man who had never much complained, no matter how much of his frustration and anger he laid on him. The one who had always listened, who had his back, even if he hadn’t asked for it. How often had he pushed Castiel away, in fear of losing him? How often had Cas kept up with his habits, his flaws and resentment?
Coming closer to Dean, the angel’s eyes where full of questions. Insecure, but hopeful. Had he heard it correctly. Did Dean really return his feelings?
Insecure Dean started to close himself off again. Stepping back a little, he only carefully looked up. His eyes inspecting the angel, as if he wanted to make sure of something. Then he slowly nodded.
Darkness had entwined him. His heart still happy. A soft smile still on his lips.
“I can’t stay.” Cas told him, his eyes lowering to the ground.
She pushed him forward. “You will be back when you got your answer. And then you will stay forever. Knowing, what you really lost.”
“It doesn’t matter.” was all he said. It didn’t matter what she would do. It didn’t matter how much she would let him suffer. Dean was saved and would be okay. He had to be.
“I’ll find a way.” Dean heard Cas’s voice, when the kiss broke. “I’ll come… back… to … you.”
He could feel Dean’s eyes on him before he turned to him and saw them. His eyes, so full of disbelieve and pain, but also filled with so much hope.
For a moment Dean just stood there, stunned in the angel’s arms. Then he wrapped his arms around him, closing his eyes. And for the first time in the last hours, maybe even days, he sighed relived. Being in Cas’s arms, just hugging him, felt like home. Finally, he was where he was meant to be.
“I am worth it.” He tried to convince himself with little success. He must be worth it. Become worth it at least. Because no matter how much he had denied it all these years, the angel’s words had filled his heart. So open, so clear and so truthfully spoken. He wouldn’t even try to shake them away. Dean believed him, that much he had felt every single of Castiel’s words. Only himself he had to convince.
Too many thoughts, confusing and loaded with emotions played ping pong in Dean’s mind. He hadn’t even had a chance to react and now… now Cas was gone. Forever.
“Dean.” Cas sighed. “Things are different. We’re stronger now, together.” When Dean didn’t say anything, Cas prompted. “Tell me I’m wrong.”
begged his fingers as they scrabbled for purchase, for something solid to hang onto, to prove it was real.
"No," I choked out. My hope that I could make him understand with my hands, my lips, left my body in one breath. He wouldn't trust me, and I wouldn't turn back. And yet, I still wanted him.
He drove down the deserted road and was just turning left, towards the bunker and away from the lights of the nearby town, when Sam said, “Hey, uh, could you drop me off at the bar?”
Damn, it was cold.
“You know I’m afraid of heights.”
“You’re safe from her now,” he murmurs in a low voice.
would have happened either. It was a price worth paying.
He was breaking. Just skimming his knuckles over Cas’ skin, staring at the space where his collarbone poked out, just the guitar winding its way up and down, well stitch after stitch, he was breaking. It wasn’t the bone-crunching sort of breaking, or like glass shattering, it was more like when a dam broke, but if the water rushed in slow motion. And if he was breaking just doing this, who knows what would happen if he looked Cas in the eye.
“I… It’s a kind of mind-reading. But I could share your dreams. I never did it before because it would have been an invasion of privacy.” Cas said, his voice muffled against Dean’s skin.
He sat bolt upright. No. He was not thinking about cuddling Cas. No. Sex dreams were one thing. He hadn’t gotten laid in forever, and it was normal. Sort of. Fantasies of cuddling were a whole other deal. Dean sighed. He really wasn’t going to be able to get any sleep tonight. He threw on boxers and clothes, after wiping the cum off himself with a warm washcloth. He’d almost been tempted to get into the shower, but had decided against it. Even if he couldn’t resolve what was going on with him and Cas, there was one question he could answer - what the hell did Cas do at night? His bed was almost always unslept in, used only for reading in the afternoons.
The silence forced him to think about what Cas just said. They were stronger, now. Cas didn’t seem sad, not like he did at Wachitaka. Things were different. There was still a spark of caution in his gut, one that prompts him to growl, “I don’t want you to get hurt.”
He bobbed up and down slowly, letting his gaze roam over me. My hands slid over his tanned, muscular shoulders and through his short brown hair. I was shaking as he claimed me, running his fingertips across my ribs and digging his nails in. He moaned around my cock, such sweet dirty noises. So lost was I in the push and the pull of his lips and tongue, the sinfully hot pleasure they brought me that I barely noticed the aching want coiling in my gut. I never wanted this to end, but my body was desperate for release. Dean reached up to fist the few inches of my cock he couldn't take in his mouth, and I fell apart.
Sam sighed. Cas stared fondly down at his beer for a moment, contemplating it with greater depth than Dean thought it merited. “How come you want a beer, anyway? You can’t taste it, and it’s nowhere near enough to get you drunk.” He made a mental note to get Cas properly drunk again sometime.
“It’s… It’s warm.” Dean glared. “Do you even know how to swim?”
If he was being sensible, maybe he would have called for Sam to bring him some breakfast, a glass of water, some multivitamins or some shit, but he didn’t want to. Instead, he crossed his arms over his chest, pretending like it didn’t make it harder to breathe, and lay there, glaring at the ceiling. The sheets and blankets were tangled uncomfortably around his legs and waist, but he didn’t move. It was as if he thought by sheer force of will, he could become well.
They could’ve stayed like that all night, Cas staring at Dean, and Dean trying to tear his eyes away, Jimi Hendrix travelling across the guitar neck in the background. With every minute, Dean tried to push whatever this was down, to say something normal and leave. But something, something about today had broken that dam, and the water was just rising. It’s common knowledge that Dean Winchester’s never been in love. Which is one explanation why, when confronted with falling face-first into it, his only reaction was to stare.
Cas was gone. “Shit,” Dean exclaimed standing up. “Cas?” He called out tentatively. When the angel had disappeared and not reappeared for over twenty minutes, he’d started walking. “Cas?” He shouted quietly, still trying not to be worried. Cas was an angel. It wasn’t like he could fall into the lake and drown. Right?
“No.” Dean sets his jaw. But a minute later, it comes to him. “Could you give him my grace?”
The smile that spreads across Cas’ face is nothing short of beatific. Dean wonders how many lives he’d give up saving just to make Cas happy.
Sam rolled his eyes. “Yeah. You two have fun.” There was an unfair bit of emphasis on the word
With the realization, another recollection floated back to him. It was fuzzy and whiskey-tinged around the edges, from last night. “
I started to move, thrusting in and out of him in smooth, deep slides. We were lost in pleasure, forgetting everything but the here and the now. "Beautiful, Dean," I said quietly. He groaned, and I knew I had found that secret spot inside him again. I thrust into him harder, gasping at the hot bliss that graced my being. He held onto me tightly, panting into the curve of my neck.
"Cas, buddy..." He let the words trail off and turn into mist, hanging in the air between them.

Cas. Cas in his bed. Cas,
All at once, the engine juddered to a halt, an assembled pile of clothes fell on the floor, and the only sign they’d been in the Impala at all was a slight rumple in the leather. Dean blinked. They were laying in his bed in the bunker. Cas grinned lazily. “Coulda done that later,” Dean muttered, but he started grinning too. Cas was in his bed. Because he had one of those now. A bed, and a home, and someplace to shelter from the storm outside, and Castiel. It was too good to be true, Dean knew that. But he thought after everything he was due a little peace. At least for this afternoon, he told himself.
Cas glared in response. Dean frowned. They’d talked normally in the car. Cas surely couldn’t be mad because he’d gone to blow off a little steam. “You OK?”
Cas’ grace burned inside of him, exploring all his furthest corners, and it was unlike anything he’d ever known. He could feel Cas all around him, in the space between them, could feel everything that was
But when you hold me in your arms, I'll sing it once again.
Cas’ eyes lit up, and he followed Dean down the stairs. Sam was kneeling by the latest attempted victim, saying, “Yes, the Devil is real, but you don’t have to worry about him. Yes, really.”
Dean’s cock is a pretty shade of red. It must hurt. And he’d sucked off Cas without even touching himself. Cas pushes his fingers into Dean, watching Dean’s jaw fall open as he pants.
Their lips met softly, and Dean melted into Cas, drawing them even closer together. Their hands, still held tightly together, were the only thing separating them. They kissed slowly, lips brushing tantalizingly. God, it was good. Better than anything, to tell the truth. Dean licked inside Cas’ mouth gently at first, before flicking the tip of his tongue across Cas’. Cas let out a quiet moan, fingernails digging into the edges of his handprint. Cas’ mouth was hot and wet and tasted of something clean, like the air after it had rained. Dean could almost swear he felt the light touch of feathers on his shoulders. His eyes were closed, but he was mapping every inch of Cas’ body that he could feel. They parted for air only when Dean was reminded by the ache in his chest that he had to breathe. “I…” The single word, with no conclusion waiting, was dragged out of Dean’s lungs.
Dean cocked his head, and asked, “Does it have something to do with a mysterious key you gave me for Christmas?” Dean had been waiting for a week, and Cas had made no mention of it.
Dean had to admit, it had a kind of Cas logic to it, but man, he’d never thought about Cas being into guys before. He swallowed. “So, ah, less one night stands, more dates?”
“Maybe we take our chances.” But Jack didn’t look nervous. “Still, Castiel spoke of...” he chose his words carefully. “A profound bond between him and Dean. It’s possible some degree of symbiosis might make it possible for Dean’s grace to live in him permanently.”
It's been months since they defeated Chuck, since they started taking fewer and fewer hunts. It's been months of Miracle licking his face to wake him up, of padding around the bunker in his robe and feeling at home and empty simultaneously. It's time. It's time to get a grip on all the pain that drives him to the bottle, that sets him off sparking rage at those closest to him. The pain that didn't have blood or scars to demand attention. The kind he's never tried to heal.
The pancakes were burnt, and Cas seemed to have put more blueberries than flour into the batter, but they were
