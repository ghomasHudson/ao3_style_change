It meant that this was his last night. This… hadn’t been expected at all… For a few minutes he couldn’t see or hear anything, his mind was numb, but then, ignoring the eyes, full of shock and sympathy, he got up heavily from where he had been sitting at the water, turned around and started wandering away from the lake, away from all of this. There was nothing that could be done now. He hadn’t even imagined that the night before had been the last one he had spent with John. He would not be able to say good bye. He could physically feel his time running out now.
The music soon became loud and clear, because he was playing it on the violin. No, not the violin… It sounded different, – strange and unfamiliar. It had five strings, rather than the familiar four, it was bigger… A vielle! His deduction was confirmed, as soon as he was able to open his eyes. He frowned, not really enjoying the sound of the instrument for the piece he was currently performing. And how on Earth was he possibly able to play a vielle? He felt extremely disoriented, but his hands kept moving on their own accord, despite the small flaws, caused by the aforementioned confusion, rather than the lack of skill he had trouble believing he had.
He could tell that the swanling was at first very uncomfortable with the idea of dipping his head below the surface. Seeing him struggling with it one day, Sherlock sighed and paddled towards him to explain that they could swallow underwater and that their eyes were not like the eyes of humans. They had a special membrane that allowed them to see very well underwater to locate food without getting their eyes irritated or their vision blurred. It was quite different to what a human would experience and Sherlock recommended Archie to try until he got used to the thought that he could keep his eyes open without trouble. While he was a cygnet and his neck wasn’t that long yet, it was long enough to start feeding underwater. But, even though he was still learning how to do it, he could stick to the plant matter on the surface. Sherlock thought that, as a cygnet, he had been of the same size back when he had become a swan, so he could speak from experience. The only difference between them was that Archie was, more likely than not, a mute swan.
‘So you have just given your heart to Mary Morstan’, the Englishman sighed sombrely. It wasn’t a question. John frowned a little. Why would anyone meddle with his affairs like this? But, perhaps, the man was an interested party and had a relative who had come here in hopes of becoming the future queen of John’s country. It wouldn’t do to waste their time if they still had some empty hopes of changing the situation. He always preferred honesty to polite lies. At least, the man was in no way intimidated by the Prince's rank, though the stranger could very well be a royal person himself. To John he appeared to be more royal than John himself would ever be.
‘It’s fine. There’s nothing to apologise for. I overreacted’. Sherlock turned his head slightly, looking at the guest out of the corner of his eye. John’s posture and his body language, in general, indicated that he was ready to leave any moment and wasn’t planning to stay for long, otherwise, he would’ve made himself comfortable, as he usually had. Sherlock hated that he’d made him feel so unwelcome. In addition, from what he could see, Archie was in front of the entrance, admiring his very own new crossbow, lighter and smaller, obviously given to him in return for John’s forgotten one that was currently hanging against the man’s back on its leather strap. The crossbow had been promised to the boy, but he hadn’t been supposed to get it this soon, therefore, John was assuming that his visit tonight was his last one ever. The lump in Sherlock’s throat felt like he was about to start choking on it.
Next, after a blackout, he found himself in a hazy dream, where he was drowning in freezing waters, no longer hearing the wedding song, even though there still was ringing in his ears and the pieces of his shattered violin were next to him in the water, drowning together with him. He could barely feel cold or pain any more, as his body was already numb. He was incapable of breathing or going back on the surface, his arms and legs were just moving helplessly, weakly and way too slowly for the motions to be in any way productive, so he kept going down. There was Mary’s face above the water watching him, looking down on him ‘You don’t tell John’, he somehow managed to hear her telling him before she disappeared. The water gradually started whirling Sherlock’s body like a partner in a dance, slowly, and he allowed the depth to consume him.
From all of that, it was obvious that they were still a product of magic; Sherlock would have rather expected everyone, including himself, to be naked and rather unkempt after being turned back into what they all were – humans.
Still lying on the floor, he touched his face, and his hand (an actual hand!) met his nose with nostrils, rather than a bill with nares; he had cheeks, chin and lips, as well as smooth, featherless skin. Everything seemed in place. Once he was certain that he wouldn’t forget how to breathe as a human and his dizziness mostly abated, he started getting up gingerly. Standing up felt odd, as his centre of gravity had shifted and a normal body position was entirely different. He looked himself over briefly. Oddly enough, he was wearing clothes: a nice attire with black velvet breeches and snug-fitting jacket with silver buttons and dark-purple embroidery. There was a delicate white shirt underneath, rich lace collar and sleeves visible on the outside, looking a bit spikey, but softer than they seemed. His back was covered with a long, dark-grey cloak, long enough to drag along the floor when he walked. He even had a silver coronet on his head, very similar to the crown he’d had as a swan. Of course, the coronet was way bigger to fit his human curly head. And it was tangible now, as he was examining it in his hands. For now, he put it back onto his head, intending to get rid of it later, once he examined the rest of himself, including his senses, both to remember what it was like to have a human body and to make sure everything worked fine. As always, his natural curiosity was also a motivator.
He was too scared to come out of his hiding place just yet. He was hungry, but too frightened. His body was still very tired and achy and he still couldn’t think clearly, so he decided to give himself some time and just rest.
‘Good boy…’ Sherlock whispered, smiling to himself weakly. The cygnet then got himself under Sherlock’s good wing, only letting his head stick out. ‘Archie… If I die, everything I own is yours. The key… The key is behind the medium-sized, brown piece of limestone… under the second w-window to the right from the entrance’, the crowned swan said with some effort. The boy looked startled at that, but then seemingly calmed down.
Sherlock couldn’t die like this. He couldn’t. It was absolutely impossible. The thought that life had permanently abandoned this body, that it was just a corpse, a cold, empty corpse, as alive as a mannequin, was mind-numbing, no matter how many times John had seen such things before. The experience was never getting old when it came to people he knew in person. A body, an empty, lifeless vessel, void of all the thoughts, personality and emotions that had once occupied it; with all its, once normal and effortless, biological processes no longer taking place. And even the body, not always entirely recognisable, as death always changed some of its features almost immediately, was meant to be taken away, subjected to decomposition that erased the last traces of a human being, once full of life and, perhaps, brilliance... like Sherlock.
Most other drugs, such as oxycodone, just didn’t feel exactly right, but he still used them in combinations with his more preferable ones.
‘Sherlock! Sherlock, wait! I’m sorry!’ he pleaded. Sherlock didn’t stop, didn’t look back. The thought that he should’ve probably left the younger man alone now, at least for a short while, slowed John down a little, but then he regained his pace, too worried to just leave everything like this.
He decided to follow their example and start building a fire inside the chapel, instead of using up those precious few candles he still had. Building a fire would not only give him more light, but more warmth as well. Eventually, he would’ve had to start doing it anyway, because there’d be no more candles left. He brought some stones from the entrance and placed them in a circular shape close enough to the altar to feel the benefits in the form of light and warmth, but not too close to risk damaging anything he owned. He collected some brushwood in the forest, as well as things to be used as tinder, such as old, dry bark, fir tree twigs and other things that were likely to catch sparks quickly. He hated that he had to waste his precious time as a human on anything like that, as well as on building and maintaining fire, but he had no choice. Of course, he could start bringing some light material into the chapel as a swan, not unlike real swans built their nests, but there wouldn’t be much anyway, he would’ve pretty much had to bring every twig separately and that light material would be devoured by the fire very fast. Jeanne-Victoire sometimes helped him with that, and, while she didn’t do it often, it was still better than nothing.
‘Dealing with you as a child is just boring’, Moriarty finally scoffed. ‘By the way, did you like my present?’ he asked, looking excited now. He was waiting for an answer, but, even if Sherlock wasn’t dumbfounded now, he wouldn’t have known what his abductor was talking about, so he wouldn’t have been able to reply anyway. Moriarty made an impatient gesture with his hand, still expecting an answer, but none was given, so he rolled his eyes, sighed and slapped his hands against his thighs in a gesture of mock surrender. ‘I was generous enough to allow you to spend some time with your family’, the man answered for him, looking mockingly scandalised at the necessity of voicing it. ‘I’ve waited long enough, but it’s time for you to start a life of your own, away from the familial nest, and spread your wings’, the man drawled in a sing-song voice. ‘So… Without further ado…’ Moriarty abruptly lost his playful demeanour, his eyes looked like two abysses, his face cold and dangerous. Sherlock managed to get up and started backing away in panic, but his legs felt as if they were leaden, so it was absolutely pointless.
Sherlock spent the entire evening and night sobbing and crying out for his mother pathetically, hiding under the roots of that tree again. A human would have likely only heard pitiful noises of a distressed swanling, but the other swans, apparently, could understand what was going on. However, as soon as any of them approached, he started screaming and driving them away, so they were compelled to stop their attempts to comfort him. He didn’t want them. He wanted to go home to Mummy; to his family, to Redbeard, and he wouldn’t have even complained about that fucking vielle or his brother!
John hadn’t quite expected this many people to arrive. He’d seen some of these people before, for the most part, during some political meetings. He knew that most of them had arrived two days earlier, but he had only seen a few of them in person. In addition, some of them had stopped at one of the duke’s castles nearby. The Bavarian duke was only happy to help with the accommodations of the guests of such importance. There were royals and those who accompanied them from Hungary, Russia, Spain, Naples and Poland (it had taken forever to greet each one of the foreign delegations). But there were also noblewomen from a larger number of countries. While they weren’t royalty, they were held in high regard and had every chance to be chosen. Theoretically, John could choose one of them. And, while it was preferable if he chose a princess, it wasn’t obligatory, and not many would wrinkle their noses if he decided to marry someone slightly less ‘important’ than a princess. Marrying someone from a ducal family, for example, was perfectly acceptable. There was no pressure from Queen Martha here. And, if any of their advisers had anything to say about it, they had already been shut up by her.
Sherlock hated to leave his safe place, but he needed to find out where he was and what was wrong with him. He was also very thirsty and, judging by the faint noise he could hear, there was a body of water somewhere nearby. Eventually, he took a hold of himself and crawled out from under the tree. Why couldn’t he move normally?.. Nothing made sense, apart from the fact that it was already a midday.
Moriarty, however, had his own plans. He hadn’t been visiting for quite some time, so his visit the next evening was unexpected.
Time went fast and Sherlock nearly forgot to remind Archie when it was time for him to return to the lake before he transformed.
‘Oh, Sherley… I’m just playing my role. As are they…’ he nodded towards the flock of swans Sherlock hadn’t noticed before. It was probably one of them who had bothered him earlier. They were not giant, as he’d thought, but rather normal-sized for adult or almost adult swans. They were clearly trying to stay away from Moriarty. Motionless and silent, they were cuddled together, never looking at the sorcerer, obviously unwilling to attract his attention with a movement, a noise or anything else at all. Sherlock, too, wanted to run and hide, but he felt too clumsy and unwilling to turn his back on the sorcerer.
However, what his eyes saw next, on the coffee table, made his heart fall. A spoon, an extinguished tea light, a small, nearly empty package of citric acid powder (to dissolve heroin, of course)… That was enough to realise what was going on. Immediately after that, his eyes found Sherlock lying on the sofa, looking both ethereal and simply deathly pale, and, most likely, unconscious. John was next to him in a moment, trying to shake him awake, which didn’t work. Only being this close, he noticed a glass syringe between Sherlock’s arm and the back of the sofa. The sleeve of his dressing gown was still rolled up and a rubber tourniquet was loose halfway around the man’s upper arm.
But, all of a sudden, after midnight, they started to change. Just as the night before, the process was really unpleasant, and judging by the pained moans and laboured breathing of the members of the flock nearby, it wasn’t unpleasant for him alone. And, just like the night before, there were soon men and women in fine clothes at the lake. Sherlock sighed in relief, because, him being a human again, meant that no opportunities had been lost, contrary to his previous fears.
The bird was a couple of metres away on the ground, watching him, its head tilted. A few moments later, it, unexpectedly, started to change its shape: the feathers were gone, as if pulled back underneath the skin, the wings and talons turned into arms and legs. It had taken mere moments, and now there was a man in a dark attire of a nobleman, looking at Sherlock from above and smirking. The dark eyes and that face… Sherlock knew this man.
‘No! You can’t leave me here! Where are you going?! Come back!’ He was, basically, running after his leaving brother, who wouldn’t even turn his face to him again. His wings felt uncooperative, as he kept running and flapping them uselessly. He did manage to take off, but had no choice but manoeuvre between the trees in the forest and land a few times, just to keep running after the older man ungracefully, falling on his chest several times.
The flight was making him nauseous and he started to get cold soon enough. It took him a lot to finally collect himself and look up at his abductor. It was a dark owl that was probably a bit shorter than an average adult human and strong enough to carry him almost effortlessly. It was ridiculous and insane. How was this even possible?! In sheer panic, Sherlock started thrashing a little. And the bird suddenly let him go, to his absolute horror. Then it calmly followed him down, as he was falling, screaming his head off, and caught him with its talons again. Once it returned to its previous altitude, it dropped him down again and caught him a few long seconds later, after whirling around itself in the air several times, looking playful. It caught and dropped him once more, this time performing a somersault before grabbing him yet again. Sherlock was in such a state by then that he could barely feel a few scratches the sharp claws had left on his body, tearing his clothes slightly. He was barely conscious by the time the bird had stopped playing its cruel game. He threw up a little and went limp.
The big change came when Sherlock was thirty-two. The spring was rather warm after the severe winter and Sherlock found the water pleasant enough to spend more time in it. He had long started accepting that he was going to live the rest of his life as a swan and die as a swan, too. Everything in him lamented and protested against the thought, even after all of those years. He was, in fact, afraid that, one day, he’d just fully accept it and start losing his human personality, mentally becoming more swan than a human. At the same time, he was quite aware that there was no hope for him. What hope could there be after more than twenty years of a life like this, if one could call it life? Sometimes, during his black moods, he contemplated suicide. He wasn’t thinking about it all the time, of course, but he kept this option open. Perhaps, one day he’d do it. Unfortunately, it would, very likely, involve him flying up as high as he could and letting himself fall. He’d calculated how to turn himself in the air to guarantee the deadliness of the fall, as the barrier wouldn’t allow him to gain a sufficient height to make sure he wouldn’t survive and become severely injured instead. He’d probably still die, but it would take days or even weeks. He’d also chosen the place where the ground was rocky.
John believed it wasn’t nearly enough to just bring Sherlock things he could use. He, obviously, wanted to do more, so, one night, he asked if there was anything else he could help the younger man with, even offering to secretly send a messenger with a letter for his family. Sherlock reminded him that his parents believed he was dead and, logically, it was better if they never started doubting it. But the idea of sending a letter to Mycroft had been planted into his mind since that conversation with John. For days, he couldn’t decide on anything. He wouldn’t mind summoning his brother to demand explanations, to demand him to share everything he knew, even though there was likely (or definitely) no hope for Sherlock. Last time they had seen each other, Sherlock had been too emotional and couldn’t talk for a human to understand. If only Mycroft visited again… But he hadn’t, and it spoke for itself. He must have moved on long ago, so was there any point in trying anything that, quite possibly, wouldn’t bring any result at all? It would’ve been inevitable for Sherlock to have a tiny, treacherous hope that would be almost inevitably shattered.
to tell stories about it when they were back at home, singing praises to the Prince; but he wasn’t a flatterer, nor was he a lickspittle. He just genuinely respected John for his abilities and friendship, and always had a lot to tell about their adventures.
It appeared, in any world John and Mary belonged to each other. Did a world where John and Sherlock could be together even exist? Apparently, not. There were always John and Mary; and stupid, stupid Sherlock…
‘Mary’, John called the blond woman, encouraging her to come closer. She looked uncertain and surprised, approaching him, nonetheless.
Lestrade visited once and brought him some more files with cases the consulting detective could help with. Sherlock easily deduced that it was John who had rung the DI and asked him to visit Sherlock and check if he was okay, even though John himself rang him every day.
The flock now occupied the half-ruined building close by every time they turned into humans, that very building Sherlock, just like some other swans, had explored years back. Sometimes their laughter or someone’s singing reached his ears in the chapel. He also knew that, every now and then, they danced there with some of them clapping their hands to create rhythm, which often went with singing as well. It meant that sometimes they could hear him playing the violin, even though he liked to think he was the only one there, playing solely for his own ears.
is incomplete’, Mycroft said pointedly, looking John in the eye for the first time since the beginning of their talk. And he was looking intensely, expectantly, as if these words were the key to everything. John had no time for puzzles and vague explanations, so he ran down the stairs, accidentally stumbling onto Mike, who probably wanted to talk to him in person and congratulate him on his betrothal.
He’d known something like this was coming, but he hadn’t expected that so many things had already been arranged. The plan was for him to choose a wife during the ball. Sometime after that, he was going to be crowned and get married shortly after. He knew it could’ve been worse: his wife could’ve been chosen for him, but Queen Martha wouldn’t have done it to him. John knew she was right. She cared about both him and the kingdom and wanted the best for both.
She believed that their new situation had something to do with the chapel itself being a sacred place and, by entering it, Sherlock had been blessed, and, by proxy, they all had been given some mercy for their sufferings. Sherlock rather thought it had something to do with Mycroft, but he couldn’t find any explanation. He knew that at least two swans from the flock had entered the chapel a long time ago, not to mention
Everything had changed, but he went on as before, waiting for John’s visits impatiently, every time. He was supposed to start preparing himself to letting John go, yet he was imbued with an acute fear of abandonment. When one night the Prince was about an hour late, Sherlock was beside himself, trying his best not to let it show and, likely, failing. He couldn’t put his mind to anything, even in the middle of his current experiment. John had promised to visit tonight, but it was an hour and a half after Sherlock’s transformation, and the much wanted guest still hadn’t appeared.
The flight seemed endless. It was physically very hard for a human, especially a child, to endure it, let alone emotionally. Sherlock felt ill and lost consciousness at least twice more. When he was conscious, he tried his best to disconnect himself from his hurting, yet numb with cold, body, attempting to memorise things he could see from above: forests, rivers, villages, fields… Would it help him in any way to have this fragmentary knowledge of the huge area between his home and the place, whatever it was, at the end of this unwanted journey? It was better than nothing.
He could barely comprehend what was going on around him, which was Pierre with two other swans attacking the hound from the air and beating it with their powerful wings. Of course, it wouldn’t have caused any damage, but it still made the hound unclench its jaws, as it probably wanted to kill more of them when they were so close, or they just irritated it and it wanted to get rid of the nuisance. In any case, its distraction gave Sherlock some time to try and escape, moving towards the safe territory. He tried to fly, too shaken to think clearly, but flying was impossible now, so he tried to run, even though it felt more like crawling to him. He could hear his own heartbeat in his ears. All the other noises were muffled, including the noises the three swans made, in order to taunt the beast and keep distracting it from pursuing its escaping prey. The hound was roaring and growling, but that, too, was muffled for Sherlock. All of a sudden, there were two swans from the flock by his side, rushing him forward to safety. As soon as they were safe, the three swans, who had been distracting the beast, were quick to escape. Pierre was the last one to fly away to give his friends time to escape and the beast’s teeth grazed his back, once he turned to fly away. Fortunately, the injury was superficial.
‘Girls and boys!’ Moriarty called cheerfully. It seemed the birds started pressing themselves against each other even harder now. ‘Meet your Swan King Sherlock!’ he announced solemnly, before turning his attention back to the cygnet. ‘Well, a king should have a retinue, don’t you think? This… All of this is yours now’, he said, his hand pointing at the lake, the forest and the swans that still wouldn’t move. ‘By the way, you’ll be tempted to make an escape attempt. I wouldn’t do that if I were you. Your new underlings can tell you all about it’, Moriarty warned, standing up and straightening his clothes. ‘See you later’, he smirked and turned to leave.
He was shooting up on a regular basis now. It was amazing how quickly, nearly from the very beginning, he’d established his old pattern of drug use and his usual doses that were both enough and not over the top for him. There weren’t any real surprises in that regard. He used different drugs, but, as always, cocaine was more preferable. The problem was that his body no longer reacted well to it, as he’d learned during his two year long mission, it never really had, which wasn’t unusual for many people, but it had become worse. His heart rate, body temperature and blood pressure were becoming so high that he was starting to shake, miserable and confused; headaches contributed to it as well. Sometimes he started panicking, too. Comedowns were more unpleasant than ever. Mixing cocaine with opioids produced a good combination that allowed him to avoid some side effects of the stimulant.
He heard others calling Archie his adoptee, which made him frown a bit. In no way he considered himself a father figure to the boy. Perhaps, he was a bit like an older stepbrother with some things in common with the younger one. He wasn’t comfortable with the fact that he had basically taken responsibility for Archie, but there was no way back now.
Apparently, if you were too close to the ‘fence’, you were a fair game for the hounds. Even if the swans managed to get past the beasts, the ‘fence’ wouldn’t let them pass, even though it did let any other creature in and out without trouble, including the hounds.
2. In the ballet Prince Siegfried has a loyal best friend, named Benno. I decided that Bill Murray makes a perfect 'Benno' for Prince John.
Yes, it was best to get it over with. Once another song ended, he gestured for the musicians to stop playing before he approached the Queen’s throne. She looked excited, trying and failing to keep her face straight. He’d attracted a lot of attention by now, and he did, in fact, manage to look composed.
‘What have you done to me?! Why?!’ the boy-cygnet yelled in both terror and anger, but the noises that escaped him weren’t human. Apparently, Moriarty had no problem understanding him anyway.
The way the members of the flock looked at him now… Somehow, they knew. They knew what was going on. There was no more gossip like there had been before Sherlock’s sudden enlightenment. He never caught a whiff of anybody discussing John or himself again. They knew.
Sherlock wasn’t free from depression, or moments when the unexplainable, bone-deep cold imbued him, or the strange feeling that he was running out of time, for some reason, which made him restless and anxious. There was also an acute awareness that he had lost plenty of time and he’d never have it back, nor would he ever get out of this cursed place; it made him feel almost claustrophobic, which didn’t make sense, as there was plenty of space. And yet, Sherlock wasn’t as deeply depressed and suicidal as before, now that, just for a few hours per night, he could have his body back, his ‘transport’. When the word first surfaced in his thoughts, Sherlock froze for a few moments, not knowing where it had come from and why it sounded so meaningful.
Sherlock wasn’t far away from the chapel and he was close to his nightly transformation when he decided not to waste time and find a sample of moss for his experiment. It was highly unlikely he’d be able to carefully pick it and bring it to the chapel in his swan form, but he was about to change into a human, so he could wait. And, while he was waiting, he could find something that looked like something he could use. His search brought him close to the barrier, and he kept it in his mind, the trauma still rather fresh after getting between one of the hounds’ jaws about three years back, which hadn’t been a good addition to his initial phobia of the creatures.
Things looked a little distorted on the edges, but, other than that, the picture was clear and he could hear all those people in the hall as well. Somehow, he could just concentrate his attention on any of them and hear what those particular people were talking about. They were having a small talk, joking, and they were, obviously, in good spirits, enjoying themselves, even when more serious topics were discussed. Sherlock couldn’t care less and his attention quickly shifted back to John, who, together with the regent, was greeting the guests in person, with some reluctance. It was unlikely they could notice it; Sherlock, however, could easily deduce it from several separate clues.
Pierre, the French Marshal’s son, was highly educated. He could read the stars for directions (not that it was in any way helpful here). Just one moment of looking at the sky could tell him what time it was, no matter if it was day or night. And he counted days, months and years. Sherlock overheard him telling his close friend Friedrich, the former dancer and the son of a street musician and entertainer, that those things helped him to stay sane. That was how the swans always knew when the big days for the rest of the world were. He always knew when it was Christmas, for example, and told others. For them that day was always a quiet one when, in their thoughts, they were with their loved ones. Sherlock wasn’t an exception. Years should have made it easier, but they hadn’t. He hoped that his family were happy and moved on. Were they still thinking about him? Had they tried to find him? He knew they had. But he didn’t want them to suffer any more than they already had, undoubtedly. He imagined that not knowing if your loved one was dead or alive, and whether he or she suffered or not, was so much worse than knowing that he or she was dead.
His thoughts on the subject of his body were interrupted when, unexpectedly, he saw a massive chest to the right of the altar, something that he hadn’t had a chance to discover earlier. He knew, however, that it wasn’t something that had been there until recently. It was relatively new and clear of dust. It had an ornate lock, but there was a key sticking out of the keyhole. Sherlock approached it tentatively, still struggling with his body. His fingers didn’t cooperate at first, so it took time to turn the key and open the chest. It was full of books and various ornate boxes. What he saw inside the one on the top made his breath hitch in his chest and, for a moment, he was afraid he wouldn’t be able to breathe properly again. He made himself calm down and just looked at the violin inside the box. He had to touch it to make sure it weren’t his eyes deceiving him in this barely-illuminated darkness. But, no, it was real; a violin, not that fucking vielle he’d secretly hated, because it had screamed: ‘Wrong!’, but a very real violin… It felt so right in his hands that he wanted to cry. Could he still play? He wasn’t sure. He’d have to wait till his hands felt like his own again. Sherlock put the instrument back into the box and put the box onto the altar to see what else he could find in the chest. There was a box full of candles and two candleholders. It also contained pieces of flint and steel to produce sparks and ignite fire. Sherlock quickly located a few dried leaves on the altar. He collected them to use them as a tinder. It took him about fifteen minutes to ignite the leaves and light a candle. He would really need time to get used to his hands again, even for the easiest of tasks.
Sherlock had long since noticed that, after they had realised they’d be changing back into humans every night, the flock treated him somewhat differently. Not that they’d ever treated him badly as he, more often than not, kept to himself, but now there was something else. As he wasn’t very good when it came to emotions, it took him some time to deduce that they thought it was
He wondered if his message to Mycroft Holmes would make any difference. If not, he was determined to pay him a visit in England, once he left Bavaria. In addition, he started carefully asking around if anybody knew anyone by the name of Moriarty. He made sure to keep his small investigation quiet. In Bavaria, nobody he’d asked was familiar with the name. But his further research revealed that there was a noble family in Ireland with that name. He doubted that that particular Moriarty, sorcerer on not, would fly this far away from home every time he wanted to see his collection of human swans. Wouldn’t it be more convenient to organise something like that a little closer to one’s home? Once this fucking ball was over and done with, and John was back to the British Isles, he’d check that Irish family and everyone related to them, just in case. Still, he had a feeling that, even if the sorcerer was a member of that particular family, he lived somewhere nearby: in Bavaria or in a neighbouring duchy. What if he could be negotiated with? What if John could offer something in return for Sherlock’s freedom? If he managed to find Moriarty, he would try every available option (though killing him was a more preferable one, in John’s opinion). He was going to keep searching.
When the feast was over, the guests were invited back into the great hall where Queen Martha was helped to the throne, so she could enjoy watching young people dancing. She insisted that John absolutely had to dance with someone, at least one dance. He rolled his eyes and asked one of the noblewomen in her thirties to dance with him; his choice was purely random.
After that, the atmosphere itself became more relaxed. John started talking about some world events Sherlock had missed. But he was much more interested in hearing about John’s adventures abroad. At some point, Archie had joined them to listen as well after he’d come back with a bundle of thick sticks and twigs to add into the fire, even though they still had a small supply left. They almost had enough for the next night. Seeing that Sherlock felt more relaxed in the presence of John, the boy seemed more at ease now as well. He seemed quite interested in learning more about John’s killings during his military campaigns, but still wasn’t comfortable enough to voice his demands for that kind of stories from this new person. Sherlock shook off the renewed feeling of déjà vu and focussed on John instead.
When he asked how exactly Sherlock could know all of those things about him, the man replied that he’d simply observed it, because he knew where to look and what to look for. He explained how exactly he’d gathered it all from John’s clothes, his skin, haircut, signet-ring, attitude and many other things (he described them all so quickly that John needed a bit of time to get his head round it all afterwards, because he didn’t want to miss anything). As it turned out, his brocade black with gold design doublet alone had given Sherlock plenty of information. In his life John had seen people that could be characterised as geniuses among military leaders, weaponsmiths, artists, inventors, but this… This was something else.
Some women were too young for his liking, and, since most of the nobility and royalty married early, the percentage of the ‘too young’ women was high. One of them was fourteen! There was no way John would’ve even considered her as a potential wife. In fact, later, he was going to have a word about it with the Queen and find out how much she was involved here and what she had been thinking.
He’d long learned to control this body. He even flew sometimes. It wasn’t that hard, as long as he had enough space to take off. But he hated it. It reminded him of being abducted by Moriarty and falling. He only flew very short distances when he needed to get somewhere quickly, not that he had any real reason to hurry, and he was never too high above the ground; in fact, anything less than four metres was ideal.
After a lavish dinner, John was guided to the chambers, prepared for him, personally. He knew the Queen had decided to give him some time and space, so he hadn’t yet learnt the reason why they were here. He did have his suspicions and wasn’t particularly happy about them, so he hadn’t insisted on discussing anything on the day of his arrival. Despite the mild feeling of uneasiness, John was quick to fall asleep. As a soldier, he was used to sleeping pretty much anywhere, whether the conditions were comfortable and royal or not even remotely such.
All Sherlock could do was wait for his transformation. Maybe then he’d be able to come up with something. For now, he could only rest. His body never stopped shivering and he wasn’t always entirely conscious, which, in fact, was a mercy. And, just as mercifully, nobody bothered him again, even though he could detect some worried looks directed at him. Most swans were busy worrying about the adolescent that was back at the lake now. Sherlock hadn’t seen how they’d managed to get her there, as she still looked unresponsive and empty-eyed, unless she’d had a moment of clarity the others had used to guide her back. Ironically, it was Beatrice who had survived, while her sister Alison, who had done pretty much everything in her power to hold her back and protect her from danger, was dead now. Beatrice had been left to live with that knowledge.
The truth was, he hadn’t had long after being sent to Eastern Europe. He’d seen no point in postponing the inevitable, so he’d planned to commit suicide and to be dead before the plane landed (
‘Archie, it’s fine. Nothing to be concerned about. It’s just… John’, Sherlock explained, or tried to, and nearly buried his warm face in his hands. He was ridiculous. Was it a side-effect of his anti-socialness that a few nice words had a power to affect him in such a manner? It wasn’t like him at all.
‘Mummy… or this version of her, at least, is inconsolable. We’ve spent years searching for you. But it’s time for Mummy and Father to move on. I won’t tell them the truth. They deserve to spend the rest of their days without having futile hopes of ever seeing their youngest’.
John was startled to discover that Sherlock was no longer breathing and there was no pulse or any other signs of life he could find now. It couldn’t have been for more than a few seconds, though, since John’s fingertips barely left the pulse point on his friend’s wrist. He quickly checked the one on the pale neck, then pressed his ear against the still chest. There was nothing. Only a couple of minutes before that, John had started to suspect that the ambulance wasn’t going to make it in time. He hated being right about it. It had been six minutes after he had rung the emergency service. They were supposed to arrive any moment now, but Sherlock didn’t have time. John was his only hope to survive. The army doctor was like well-oiled machine when it came to saving lives.
‘You look like you’ve seen a ghost’, his friend chuckled, and then immediately became concerned, upon taking a good look at John. As the Prince was moving fast to the exit, people were perplexed, seeing him in such a state. He had no time for explanations (and even if he did, he wouldn’t have been able to give any) or apologies. He was making a scene, he knew it, but he couldn’t stay calm now.
was the one who was unwanted; a third wheel. Despite the absolute agony, her words still managed to hurt. She stood up, apparently ready to leave and let him die in peace now. He wasn’t even supposed to be still alive with a wound like this. Perhaps, it was just a matter of time before he drew his last, painful breath. He was rapidly losing consciousness and everything was becoming out-of-focus.
He’d stared using again during his time away. Sometimes he’d been in need of stimulants to keep going, sometimes, but not very often, he’d required painkillers, if things had gone seriously wrong. When he’d started his mission, he’d preferred to see it as an adventure; the Work had always been his motivator, kept him interested and excited. But that wasn’t the same. It had been at first, or at least it had appeared so, but it hadn’t lasted.
‘John…’ The soft crooning noise made the blond man turn, even though he had definitely noticed, or rather heard, the swan earlier.
‘No, thank you’, he declined. ‘And, would you be so kind as to ask Jeanne-Victoire not to come here tonight with her prayers?’ She didn’t come to the chapel most nights, but, with his luck, chances were that tonight she would. He noticed John raising his eyebrow slightly, because Sherlock had answered for him as well, despite the fact that the both of them had been invited. But he had deduced that John wasn’t hungry! Unexpectedly, it made him worried that his typical lack of tact had put the new acquaintance off. The amused twitch of the blond man’s lips made Sherlock inwardly sigh in relief.
The following evening he finally confessed to his friends that he was soon to get married and ascend the throne. The others could tell he wasn’t very happy about it.
He started running out of cocaine soon enough, but he still had enough of heroin, both legally and illegally produced. They were so different, – cocaine and heroin, but he craved both. It was all so easy, so familiar. He felt in control, he felt relaxed, happier. His days were running smoothly, he was his own person, and it was he and he alone who decided what he needed, what he could and couldn’t do. It was such a relief to be on drugs all the time now. As long as he had gear, things would be fine, but once he ran out of it, he would have to think of a way to obtain more. No, he wasn’t going to worry about it just yet.
Humming under his nose and looking very excited, Moriarty approached the water, squatted down and elegantly touched the surface with his index finger before moving away a little to sit down onto a large stone behind the worried swans.
It would take a long time for Sherlock to feel more or less comfortable with leaving his treasures every time he turned back into a swan and had to come back to the lake. He never left the chest unlocked.
Sherlock was happy. He didn’t know why, but he knew, he could feel, that he hadn’t been this happy for a long time. He just wanted to hold onto the feeling, instead of analysing, among other things, why being a child felt odd to him. Maybe it was just normal for a growing person with an above-average intelligence to feel older than they were. And he quickly got used to wearing all those clothes. Nothing indicated that he hadn’t been wearing this type of clothes for years now. Very soon, it felt natural to put them on every morning, as well as to see others wearing somewhat similar attires. The time that, to some extent, had felt wrong at first, was also easy to get accustomed to.
‘Would you mind me seeing you changing?’ the blond man asked and bit his lip slightly. ‘It’s fine if you do mind; I'm not going to insist. It’s all fine’, he added hastily. Sherlock was equally stupefied by another sudden bout of déjà vu at those words and by the request itself. Would he be comfortable with anything like that? He’d feel vulnerable for a few minutes after the transformation, not to mention that he was generally more vulnerable as a swan, no matter how strong those birds could be. But, in the end, he chose to agree. John had already seen him as a swan anyway.
‘You’ve got nothing to worry about’, he finally said, loud enough for others to hear. ‘I promise to love and respect you. I swear to do my best to make you happy. You have my word, you shall not be looked down at. Mary Morstan, will you marry me?’
5. When Sherlock was kidnapped and taken to Bavaria by Moriarty, Bavaria consisted of several parts. Sometime during Sherlock's life as a swan (some years before he met John) the parts were reunited, so now it has one duke. It's not important for the story; I just thought I should mention it for some more realistic world-building.
When Sherlock had met John, he hadn’t been taking drugs for sixty-eight days, and, back then, he’d doubted he was going to remain abstinent for much longer. And yet, from the moment Sherlock had met his flatmate, friend and partner, up to sometime after the Fall, Sherlock hadn’t been using, except for those two cases when he’d been drugged against his will by the taxi driver and The Woman. The cravings, if there at all, had been weak, and Sherlock could easily ignore them.
It wasn’t hard to fool Lestrade. It was even easier to fool Mrs Hudson and Mycroft’s lackey during his brief visits. Oh, yes, he knew how to hide his addiction, indeed. He wouldn’t have been able to fool Mycroft now, though, but the busybody was away in another country (Sherlock must have deleted which) with a diplomatic visit, which was a rare case for him, but it was definitely playing into his little brother’s hands. If he demonstrated any suspicious activity, Mycroft’s underlings would undoubtedly notify him, but Sherlock knew how to be careful.
His Mind Palace Watson, his beloved Victorian era companion, was there for him more often than not, always choosing him over his wife, once the drugs kicked in enough for that world to become Sherlock’s reality. And, if John wasn’t there, it was enough for Sherlock to send someone with a message, for him to arrive within a couple of hours or even sooner than that. At first, Sherlock was moderately content, sometimes even happy and elated, but then, a couple of times, he suddenly broke down and started crying in front of Watson. How embarrassing… It must have had something to do with his choice of drugs in the real world. He wasn’t sure what exactly it was. Watson was worried; he took Sherlock’s hands in his, looked him in the eye and started asking what was wrong. The detective never answered: he tried, he opened his mouth, but nothing came out, and John just stayed there with him. His close proximity and warmth meant the world to Sherlock. It was so cold without his friend, and he wasn’t sure where it was coming from.
A couple of weeks after he’d started spending his whole time as a human in the chapel with his books and the violin, he was approached by Jeanne-Victoire, who was a rather pious person and one of a very few whooper swans in the flock. She offered him help with cleaning the place, in return for the opportunity to pray in the chapel on a regular basis. Throughout the years, he had heard her murmuring prayers at the lake a few times. Some others, who still believed in the same higher powers, despite being deprived of everything they had known and cherished, did it as well, but, to his relief, they didn’t ask Sherlock to let them into the chapel, too. He doubted he wouldn’t have lashed out soon enough if someone else intruded his place. Jeanne-Victoire alone was more than enough for his meagre patience.
‘Sherlock, darling, dinner is served!’ he suddenly heard Mummy’s voice outside his room. He stopped playing abruptly. Something was wrong, as if he wasn’t where he should’ve been, but he couldn’t be certain of it. His eyes roamed over the room, both familiar and unfamiliar, at the same time, and stopped on his own reflection in a large mirror. He was an about eleven years old boy with a typical vielle still resting against his shoulder, the bow lowered. Not only the instrument was bigger, but also Sherlock himself felt smaller; again, he couldn’t grasp why he felt that way. The set of rooms was his, but the feeling that he hadn’t been here for a long time was persistent, as well as the feeling that the furniture and the décor were all wrong. He must have been practising for a long time, ended up daydreaming, and being distracted by Mummy had probably got him confused. What a weak explanation… He decided to shrug it off for now and explore instead.
. She would, though. She already had once, hadn’t she? He couldn’t remember the circumstances, but he knew. Unless, those were false memories, if one could characterise those incoherent scraps as memories.
If you’re not very familiar with the ballet or want to refresh your memory, I recommend you to see this particular filmed version:
Finally, he could see the man better, which had been the plan. Besides, Archie was going to come here soon and Sherlock didn’t want him to stumble upon a stranger in the dark. There were two large stones near the hearth, normally used for sitting, as they were flat at the top (not really comfortable, but beggars couldn’t be choosers). Sherlock invited the man to sit down onto one of them, whilst occupying the other one.
But, apart from their swan noises, there was something else happening in terms of communication. They were talking to each other! He never really approached them, but it was enough for him to move only slightly closer than he usually was to them to be able to ‘hear’ them talking. It wasn’t physical, and it was highly unlikely a human could even imagine any communication like that happening between them, let alone understand them (Moriarty was, likely, an exception). It was more as if they could ‘talk’ to each other telepathically, and it was a complex interaction, with fully-formed, absolutely normal sentences, rather than anything curt or monosyllabic one would expect of a swan or any bird or animal communicating with another one. It didn’t take long for Sherlock to deduce that these swans weren’t actually swans. They were, just like him, humans; abducted and turned into swans. Those were young men and women; mostly women, as he had already established before. Sometimes he observed them from a distance (he always kept the distance). They seemed quite used to this life. As long as there was no Moriarty anywhere close by, they were rather relaxed. They swam in the lake, even played in the water. After their sleep, they enjoyed spreading their wings, preening themselves or grooming each other, gossiping about this or that. It wasn’t often they discussed anything serious. Sometimes one or more of them started to feel homesick and depressed, and it was time when they all kept closer to each other, trying to be comforting. Sherlock grieved on his own, just as he did pretty much everything else.
‘You know what, John’, Mike started after having a sip of ale. ‘You should go hunting. It’ll take your mind off all the worries for now. People say the forest to the south-east from here is full of game. Really, go, you don’t have to brood here while people are starting to get busy with preparations for that ball of yours’.
And then, the familiar footsteps made Sherlock move towards the entrance, his legs moving on their own accord.
He felt as if there was nothing at all left in his life. He knew it was childish and overly dramatic to think that way, and, perhaps, it was his addiction talking, but he was tired of caring about it. Caring was not an advantage; Mycroft knew exactly what he was talking about, and Sherlock knew how much trouble caring had brought to Mycroft himself, probably much more than any good he’d ever seen from Sherlock, shouldering the burden of a junkie brother alone, without involving their parents. He was good at hiding his addiction; Mycroft was right about that as well. John would be too busy to find out. And, if he happened to visit for a moment or two, abandoning his family life for a short while, Sherlock would find a way to tamper with his urine tests. Quite possibly, there would no longer be any other reason for John to visit his bothersome friend. Wasn’t Sherlock dragging him down?
It was hard to believe, but he was getting married and crowned soon. He was going to have to try to be a responsible King and husband, even if not everything about it sat well with him.
His Queen was definitely up to something. Queen Martha and her retinue, most guards and servants had arrived a couple of weeks earlier, but John had been held back by a few political issues, that, thank goodness, had been solved by now!
Soon, all of them were invited to the hall next to the one everyone was currently occupying, because the feast had been prepared and the guests were awaited. The table was lavish, the music nice, the entertainers funny or skilful (or both, depending on what their performances required), so people seemed to be having fun. Even John was a little more relaxed now.
‘Uh-huh. There’s been an arrow stuck deep inside. I thought my arm would have to be amputated, due to infection, but I was lucky to both survive and keep my arm’, the Prince explained. Of course, he’d been shot…
Sherlock didn’t want to end up losing his mind, too. He knew he probably had nothing to live for, and, of course, he
And thus, deep inside, he was torn, despite the fact that everything had already been decided. Perhaps, he’d be able to come to Bavaria every year and see Sherlock. Would those occasional visits be fair to the both of them and their friendship at all? There were so many things separating them. Sherlock, of course, was aware that John would have to leave at some point, but they avoided talking about it. The avoidance of the topic was mutual. Leaving was going to be tremendously hard, but he was determined to do anything in his power to help Sherlock in any way possible, even if it wasn’t going to be much in the end.
It took him at least a week to even start assessing his situation properly. There were sixteen swans living at the lake, not including himself (he didn’t want to include himself, didn’t want to associate himself with swans, these or any others). All of them were older than he, but still rather young. If he was honest with himself, he was a bit afraid of them. Swans were large birds that could look quite threatening even for a human at a close distance. Some people believed that adult swans were slightly bigger than geese, but that was a mistake, – they were much bigger than that. And Sherlock was smaller than they now, even though most of them weren’t fully matured. He wasn’t a tiny cygnet though, definitely nowhere near a hatchling. He was more like a young teen by the swans’ standards. It probably made sense, as he was an eleven years old boy… or had been, as a human. He still had a lot of grey-brown dawn all over him, and it looked a bit unkempt. He did have a very poor brownish feathering on his wings and tail, but that was it. Unlike himself, the other swans here all had feathers of juvenile or adult swans. Somehow, he could tell that most of them were females (pens), but there were a few males (cobs). From what little he knew about swans, he could recognise the majority of them as mute swans, but there were also three whooper swans. Those two species looked a bit different from each other and made rather different noises. Mute swans weren’t actually mute, but they definitely made less noise than other species, and they were a little bigger. Not all of them in this particular flock were adults; most were juvenile that had variegated grey-brown and white plumage that later would change into the wholly white one. Sherlock wondered if he’d survive long enough for that to happen to him. Again, he didn’t want to see himself as one of them.
Feeling absolutely broken, he spent long hours in the forest, roaming aimlessly or stopping and lying down, never caring about the possibility of being attacked by a very few predators that resided in the forest. The hounds couldn’t enter this particular territory. His mind felt overfilled with thoughts, and only a few of them were coherent, due to his still dazed state. After all of the years of having secret, tentative hopes, he hadn’t really been allowing himself to have, in the first place, all of them were finally shattered…
I absolutely had to include all the details of Sherlock’s survival as a swan and I hope you don't find them boring. Sherlock is all about the details, so I cannot imagine not including them. In ballet a good dancer can make you immerse into a story with his or her movements and body language. A writer needs something else for that purpose, and I love Swan Lake ballet so much that just writing a story with dry facts (‘he was turned into a swan, then he met John and they fell in love’) would hardly show my respect. And, of course, a story about Sherlock Holmes and John Watson without complexity is unthinkable. So I really wanted to include some solid world-building. I know what you’re waiting for and, I promise, I’m going to give it to you soon enough. :)
The bird was looking back at him with what he could describe as fear and, possibly, curiosity, not moving at all. But he could be imagining things, since there wasn’t nearly enough light to take a good look for making such unrealistic conclusions. John realised that he was holding his crossbow unconsciously trained at the swan. He started to lower his weapon when, all of a sudden, there was some loud barking growl, and he saw something huge moving very fast in the direction of the swan. The bird jumped in a startled terror and produced a barely audible noise that sounded somewhat like a gasp. John was quick to shoot a bolt into the huge beast. Its howl was so loud it was almost ear-splitting. Everything was happening faster than he could really follow, but he managed to notice that the beast had red, glowing eyes and black, dishevelled fur. He hadn’t seen anything like this before, but it wasn’t the best time to marvel. His skilled hands were already loading the next bolt, which was a great idea, because the wounded beast had turned on him now, forgetting about the swan, who was in the process of escaping, its wings flapping violently in a somewhat disjointed manner.
Some people from the flock were getting curious about his private place and he was quick to make them aware that it was
John could see now why Queen Martha had chosen to come here. Not only it was easier and faster for the foreign royalty and nobility to travel here rather than to the British Isles, since Bavaria was practically at the centre of Europe, but, perhaps, she was also hoping that he’d feel more relaxed here, away from his duties and politics for the time being.
One nasty day brought them a long-lasting, cold downpour that renewed with vigour after quietening down only a little bit. Archie was hiding in the bushes (he normally liked the place and used it to watch everything around him, whilst staying relatively unseen), but it hadn’t made any difference and he was soaked through, not to mention that there was a lot of water beneath him now. While it was natural for them to be in the water, this particular situation was, most definitely, unpleasant, even more so for a cygnet that only had down and barely any plumage at all. It was cold and windy, too. He could’ve gone to the flock nearby and they would’ve taken care of him, but he wouldn’t.
4. You must have noticed that I deliberately refuse to name John and Mrs Hudson's home country, which they rule. At first, I planned it to be Scotland, but, while this story is, basically, a fairy tale and historical accuracy doesn't matter, I still thought that those who are well-versed in Scottish history would find it odd, because Scotland was in an entirely different situation at that time. I didn't want it to get in your way. So, let's pretend there was another country on the British Isles back then. Imagine that some good part of Northumbria still existed independently from England and Scotland in Renaissance period (ridiculous, but passable for a fictional story, I think).
Some days had been unbearable; he’d been so far away from home, from his life, and he could feel it so acutely that no mystery had been able to distract him. He’d hated every place he’d had to stay in, the views behind the windows had always been wrong, everything had been wrong. It had been even worse when his mission had involved waiting and lying low. Returning home ever again had started to seem less and less probable. He’d never thought it would take him so long. There had never been any guarantee that he survived, but he’d silently promised John to come back, even though the doctor couldn’t have known it. And yet, it had started to seem that he would never come back, that he would either die, or the mission would never be completed, since more and more threads had kept revealing themselves in the process and appeared to be endless.
Being a swan for nearly twenty hours per day, had become emotionally harder than before. Sherlock spent his days looking forward to John’s visits. It felt like he was just going through the motions the rest of the time.
And, just as unexpectedly as it had started, it all came to an end when all of them, suddenly, started turning back into swans. At first there was a lot of confusion and slow realisation of what had happened, and then there was panic in the flock. They wondered if they’d had a chance to escape, but missed it due to being absorbed in their amazement and joy, which had made them lose precious time. Sherlock doubted it. Mycroft wouldn’t have had him supplied with all of those things in the chapel if he believed that Sherlock could escape the place. He’d said specifically that Sherlock was trapped (and that, somehow, it was his own fault. But he didn’t want to think about it now that he had a more pressing matter to think of). And, if he wasn’t, wouldn’t have Mycroft waited for the change to happen before taking his younger brother home, if that was possible? Sherlock didn’t want to believe Mycroft would have just left him here either way, whether he could leave the enclosed area or not, even though some traitorous part of him insisted that Mycroft didn’t want to take him home and had got rid of him by not getting him out of here. He knew it was ridiculous and he was simply upset, but he couldn’t help it. He had no choice but wait and see. Maybe the change would occur again if Sherlock entered the chapel ‘when the sun sets’, as Mycroft had said. He couldn’t be sure, but he’d go to the chapel every evening, if necessary. Maybe it were only certain days when it worked. Secretly, he, too, was afraid that he’d lost his chance to do something he should have done, but had failed to discover exactly what, to stay a human and he’d never have another chance.
‘See you, John’, Sherlock said. But he knew John could only hear a soft, melodious sound of a black swan. John nodded, nonetheless, and headed in nearly the same direction he had come from. Hopefully, he’d be able to avoid the hounds and quickly find his way back to his companions. Sherlock himself took off from his usual spot that had enough room for a swan’s take-off run. In passing, he saw John turning and looking at him, obviously attracted by the flapping of wings.
‘I’m the swan you have seen earlier’, Sherlock replied just as straightforwardly. At first John opened his mouth to, very likely, accuse Sherlock of jesting and probably chuckle at that, but then he closed his mouth again, and Sherlock could vividly imagine gears turning in his head. He’d followed the swan into the chapel, but, once he’d entered, the swan had been nowhere to be seen, and still wasn’t; there was a human instead. And, of course, there had been the crown, similar to the coronet the human wore. Sherlock knew he was thinking something along those lines. He could’ve pointed out that there was much more evidence than that, but refrained. It was hardly the best time to show off his skills.
’, Moriarty murmured with a smirk. Sherlock’s heart was about to jump out of his chest at what he was hearing. ‘The Prince marries the liar and the sad swan has got needle tracks hidden underneath his feathers!’ he cackled. Sherlock was starting to hyperventilate, not sure if he had ever been more terrified of Moriarty. ‘Does something like… “Mind Palace” sound familiar to you?’ the sorcerer continued, ignoring Sherlock’s sorry state. He was circling him now, slowly and menacingly. ‘No? Doesn’t ring any bells at all? Oh, but it does, doesn’t it? But you’ve gone far too deep this time, Sherley! Where’s my clever boy?! There isn’t much fun when you’re so confused! Dull! Boring!’ he spat. Sherlock pressed his fingertips against his temples hard and squeezed his eyes shut, trying to make sense of Moriarty’s words. He knew they
On the one hand, the hunter hadn’t seemed evil, but, from the look of his face and steadiness of his hands, Sherlock, despite being in a state of panic back then, could deduce that the man was truly accustomed to violence and murder, and, no, it wasn’t about him hunting animals. Did Sherlock truly want to go and talk to someone like that? He was going to have to go and meet Archie on the way, to make sure the boy got here safely. And, if he moved quietly… He was changing now, so his thoughts were no longer clear for the time being. The transformation was something he hadn’t really got used to, even after all of those years, but he knew how to move and breathe to make the recovering process faster than during that choking, panicked nightmare his first several transformations had been.
‘I need to go’. John had no time to find Mary to excuse himself either, which was why he had no idea that she was no longer in this hall.
‘Moriarty put it on me’, he answered honestly. Archie just made a small noise of understanding and they were silent again, until Sherlock realised that they were going to turn back into swans soon. ‘You should head back to the flock’s place at the lake’, he said.
3. The ballet starts with the Prince's coming of age (in some sources it's his 21st birthday). I decided to make it St John's day in this story, instead, because I wasn't sure John would be in such a great mood about his birthday. Plus, it would've been odd for him to celebrate it with peasants in a foreign country (in the ballet the peasants are Prince Siegfried's own countrymen and he has no problem having a party with them).
Becoming increasingly concerned, Watson was always there for him, believing that his friend was ailing. He barely ever went home to his wife now. When Sherlock started shivering, Watson often covered his lap and feet with a warm chequered afghan, put more wood into the fireplace and asked Mrs Hudson to bring some hot tea or prepared it himself, if she wasn’t available. The good doctor checked his pupils and pulse, touched his forehead to make sure he was, indeed, just cold and not running a fever. The contact always made Sherlock feel a little better and definitely warmer. John kept asking what was wrong and whether it had something to do with his ‘other’ life, because Watson just knew it did, but Sherlock didn’t know how to answer. What was wrong? Everything was. How could he even begin explaining?
‘I’m sorry, John…’, he murmured, loosening the rubber tourniquet and letting the drug do its job. The pleasant feeling of drowsiness filled his entire being. Finally. There was a small piece of paper next to him.
‘Now, let’s see…’ Moriarty murmured, brushing the small, grey annoyance aside with his hand, but, luckily, not hurting him. He then moved to Sherlock’s left side and took the end of the injured wing before straightening it to its full impressive length. The sharp pain made Sherlock cry out, both as a human and as a swan. He started panting and shaking harder. The sorcerer seemed thoughtful for a short while, assessing the damage, but then, all of a sudden, he pulled out a pair of forged steel shears out of a leather pouch, attached to his belt. Sherlock’s heart sank, but he was too weak and in too much pain to get away, so his frightened attempts were unproductive, especially with Moriarty still holding his wing.
‘You’re making it worse, darling’, the sorcerer muttered, unperturbed and rather absorbed in his task. When the dark blades of the shears were brought closer to his wing, Sherlock froze and closed his eyes. He knew that, if a wing of a bird had a fragmented fracture, removing the affected part of said wing, or even the whole wing, was a sensible option, in many cases it was the only possible option. Moriarty was going to cut his wing off… The shears in his hand weren’t small, but it wouldn’t be a quick cut, not to mention that he would have to cut through the bones. Sherlock couldn’t even start imagining the pain. There was no way to brace oneself for anything like that. Shock and heavy bleeding were inevitable, but he wasn’t sure he wouldn’t lose his mind in the process to care about those. And, even if he survived the nightmare, as a human he would no longer have an arm. He was so doomed.
At first, they were having a small talk. The Queen was telling him about the duke and his family’s visit not long after her arrival. But then she started the talk he’d known would follow:
‘What?! You’ve already started the preparations?’ he asked incredulously. She looked at him pleadingly, and his shoulders sagged.
‘If you want us to’, Sherlock replied quietly, never meeting the stormy-blue eyes with his own. It had become a habit, but he wasn’t sure he could trust himself with looking John in the eye without breaking down completely.
‘Of course, not’, Sherlock huffed. Was it not obvious? On the other hand, it probably wasn’t, for a normal person, who didn’t know anything about him and his negative opinion on starting a family of his own, even if his circumstances were entirely different. John just smiled at his reaction.
As soon as she was given permission, Jeanne-Victoire was quick to make a couple of besoms made of twigs, and sweep both the altar and the floor around it, as clean as she could. She also swept as much of small stones, leaves, parts of the dead plants and insects away from that remote part of the chapel as possible. Of course, the necessity would arise again soon, considering the fact that the place was partly open to the elements, but it was better than nothing. Sherlock did take part in the cleaning, it was just… he wasn’t that good at it. But his guest didn’t seem to mind. At least, she was quiet the whole time. During the cleaning, Sherlock allowed himself to inspect the chapel once more and concluded that the walls and the roof would neither collapse any time soon, nor would his belongings suffer from rain and other natural forces that could ruin them (which didn’t mean he’d ever leave anything outside the chest that, on itself, served as a nice barrier for pretty much anything that could damage the things it contained). The place seemed fairly safe. The partially collapsed wall and the entrance were far enough from the altar and his chest. Some holes in the walls and the windows didn’t look like much of a problem either. He didn’t think any major change would happen for at least a decade to come, unless some unexpected interference occurred, of course.
‘Don’t kill me’, he just said softly. It was likely going to be quite enough to at least reveal the stranger’s intentions. From what he had seen before, the man wasn’t evil, but he was a cold, unwavering killer, at the same time, and it, obviously, went far beyond killing a monstrous attacker. It was intriguing.
Not everyone in the group could read and not everyone could read on languages that were foreign to them, even though they all had no problem understanding each other. Sometimes Francesca read the borrowed books aloud by the fire where others gathered to listen.
And, yes, Sherlock had finally started conducting some experiments with what little resources he could get. It felt great to be able to use that glassware and tools. He did it all on the altar that, in fact, made a great table. Thankfully, Jeanne-Victoire never said anything about it, whatever she might think about it. He was too easy to wind up when it came to his space. Probably because of how unwelcome she felt, her visits had gradually become much less frequent.
His old stash was rather impressive, full of various drugs and safely hidden under one of the footsteps (the twelfth, to be precise) that led up to John and his.., no, just his now, flat. After what had happened on the plane, everything he’d had left on him had been confiscated. Next, before allowing him back, Mycroft’s men had searched the flat as thoroughly as was humanely possible. Sherlock’s wardrobe, for example, had been taken apart completely and put back together, as he had easily deduced upon coming back to the seemingly untouched place. His bed and many other items in the flat had gone through the same treatment. They must have found many questionable things in the process. And they
Very pretty and, in many regards, rather interesting, in his opinion, Jeanette, from a ducal family of Spain, turned out to be a bit of a drama queen when she threw a small tantrum to her small retinue, for some reason. John’s Spanish wasn’t very good, but, from what he understood, nobody had told her there were going to be so many people to ‘compete’ with, including the royals, and for this, she’d made such a long way! Well, it looked like they had something in common, because he hadn’t imagined a crowd like this, either (though he would’ve probably known if he had enquired about the ball during the preparations, just once). Jeanette was also indignant, because someone who had packed her luggage had forgotten something she’d planned to take with her. Oh… She’d wanted to be wearing another dress tonight, tailored specifically for this event, but she had to wear ‘rags’, instead. He considered approaching and assuring her that she looked stunning in her beautiful sapphire-coloured gown. Some people nearby were a bit scandalised by her display of moodiness, whereas John found himself secretly enjoying the show. He wasn’t sure if it was making her notable and made it clear that she was just as unenthusiastic about the ball as he was, or if he shouldn’t even consider the possibility of marrying her, and, therefore, shouldn’t give her any special attention, tempting as it was. He had to admit that melodramatic people did have their charm. Sherlock, for example, could be quite melodramatic and outright sulky at times (no, John didn’t mean his sadness lately, that was different), but it had never made the Prince regret their friendship. The thought made his secret smile even wider and not so secret any longer.
Other than that, they didn’t interact much. Sherlock could tell that Archie was seemingly coping better than he had been coping almost twenty-five years back. He still wasn’t sure he was good at it. It would've been unfair to think that the boy wasn’t severely affected by what had happened to him. He just suffered through it inside his own mind, in his own way, whilst, on the outside, he was simply trying to survive in these new, unfamiliar circumstances. Sherlock couldn’t deduce much from him, as he had first met him when Archie had already been turned into a cygnet, most evidence of his life before the abduction erased, but he could deduce that the boy was loved by his mother very much. He, obviously, didn’t want any other women to coddle him; he disliked it, and only his mother had been allowed to be motherly and openly show him love, affection and care. That had been hers and hers alone. What Sherlock could tell, without a doubt, was that there hadn’t been any sort of abuse that could’ve made Archie so taciturn. He was just different. And Sherlock knew and understood what it was like to be different. He couldn’t help feeling related.
‘Oh, my boy, it’s wonderful!’ she chirped quietly so that as few people as possible could hear how excited she was. She got up with ease, uncharacteristically not even paying attention to her hip.
She assured him that the hounds never stepped into the territory of the swans. However, there was a neutral territory for both them and the swans. It turned out, a few months earlier, one of the swans could no longer endure the captivity and being kept away from home. On an impulse, disregarding all warnings, she had decided to escape or die trying. The other swans had failed to talk her out of it. She had snapped at them, called them cowards and left. The magical barrier hadn’t let her through and she hadn’t found any gap. Instead, she had eventually found her death in the jaws of one of the hell hounds. Sometime after hearing her cry far away, Francesca and two other swans, who could fly rather decently, had organised a risky search party and found the failed escapee’s remains, mostly blood and feathers with a couple of gnawed bones.
John managed to get to the camp safely, even though it had taken a bit longer to find than he’d expected, which could be partially blamed on his thoughts, constantly wandering back to all the incredible things that had happened to him in the course of the last few hours. Luckily, he’d still managed to keep himself out of danger, his hands never let go of the crossbow.
‘Nowhere… I just woke up early and decided to take a walk’, he replied. He wasn’t really lying, so he didn’t feel bad. He would have been happy to share what had really happened to him with his friends, but he had a promise to keep. They knew better than to chastise him for wandering away like that. While he was a prince, he was not the kind of prince that needed looking after.
‘I could just invite him to the castle and talk to him in person’, John suggested when Sherlock shared some of his thoughts with him.
Together, they went down to join the other dancers and, as soon as the new song started playing, he took her hand in his and led her to the centre of the hall…
When the dark, oversized owl started to descend, Sherlock’s heartbeat sped up in a new bout of fear. He was scared of the unknown, not having the slightest idea of what was going to happen and whether he’d be able to get himself out of this alive. The area was an ancient woodland and there was nothing helpful Sherlock had managed to spot so far. The bird lowered him onto the ground with surprising care (even that felt like the bird was somehow mocking him again in its own way). The boy’s tired, cold, aching body would not allow him to get up fast and try to run away, and, even if he could, he knew it wouldn’t have done him any good, at any rate.
, his mind prompted quietly, but he could never really hold on to the thought. And yet, he knew it was his home, where he had been born, had grown up (was still growing up, in fact) and where he belonged.
He was getting too thirsty to keep up like this. Even though they brought him plant matter that was soaked and wet, it was still too dry for a swan. He moved slightly away from the place where the flock resided (he didn’t want to consume their floating feathers together with water) and close to the water’s line to always have access to the fresh, clean water. Soon, he started going to the chapel again. Archie made fire, read aloud for him or helped him with experiments when Sherlock started conducting them again. It was much better than nothing. From what he could gather, while both radius and ulna had been broken, it was a relatively clean fracture. Those bones were likely cracked in some other places as well, but he was lucky that there were no other breaks. For an arm it would’ve been bad, but wouldn’t have rendered it completely useless in the future, unless there were some severe complications, whereas for a wing it would’ve been an absolute disaster.
, his frightened mind prompted. He remembered hearing an outlandish rumour about a dark sorcerer with this name, but he couldn’t recall any details, since he had probably dismissed them as something stupid and definitely not real.
At first, he was quite enthusiastic about exploring the place. But, more often than not, when he thought he’d found something interesting, he realised that he’d already seen it before. When he thought he’d found an interesting book in the library, it didn’t take long for him to recognise it as something he’d read before and probably even argued with something that the author of said book tried to pass for a fact. Sherlock had always enjoyed disproving ‘facts’.
interesting and beautiful and, in other circumstances, John would’ve enjoyed the company of some of them quite a lot (too much, perhaps), but he had to choose someone who was going to become his wife, someone he was going to see most days and spend his life with, and, at the moment, he couldn’t even imagine marrying any of them; or marrying at all, for that matter. Maybe the fact that there were so many of them wasn’t that good, since he was a bit overwhelmed by their number alone. He almost wished he had told Queen Martha to simply make the choice for him and arrange a marriage that she thought was better for their country. But he knew she wanted
Sherlock was suddenly stunned. ‘Brilliant’, the man had called him. All of a sudden, it was hard to breathe and he had a strange desire to be closer to the Prince.
make sense. Every time he was about to find answers, he was being pulled back away from them somehow. He was scared and panicked. Moriarty’s words kept ringing in his head over and over again.
‘Are you not enjoying yourself, my Prince?’ someone behind him asked, sometime later. Apparently, he’d been so distracted that he hadn’t noticed the person approaching him, which was a bit unusual for him as a seasoned soldier. He turned his face to the person in question. It was a good-looking, blonde woman, close to his age, wearing a beautiful white gown, decorated with white feathers. Most noblewomen or princesses here wouldn’t have approached him like this on their own, in front of everybody. He didn’t mind at all, though. He hadn’t seen the woman before. She must have arrived later than others.
John couldn’t believe his eyes. He had seen black swans during his travels, but the one currently in front of him wore a silver crown that looked a bit glittery in the moonlight, which was the reason the Prince saw the strange creature, in the first place, because, otherwise, he wouldn’t have noticed it in the dark. He’d lost the trail of something he had been chasing before, but found this magnificent swan instead. A crowned swan… Was it the product of somebody’s odd sense of humour? Or, perhaps, he was dreaming and wasn’t aware of it? In any case, he wasn’t going to shoot the swan, at least not until he found out what kind of marvel it was. Actually, he didn’t think he’d kill it in any case. Why anybody would want to kill a wonder like this? It definitely was something more than a regular swan; or maybe he thought that because of the crown and the fact that the bird was in the forest in the middle of a night, rather than somewhere at the water. He couldn’t see or hear a body of water nearby, unless it was much farther.
The dinner was quite lavish, even for a rich family, apparently due to Mycroft’s return from some important family business. Sherlock hated politics and wrinkled his nose every time they started talking about it. And, of course, Mycroft was as pompous and important as he always had been.
John was reminded yet again why she was so loved by people, even though she wasn’t always a perfect ruler in a traditional sense. A decade earlier, there had been a king from another kingdom, who wanted to question her rule. Things had been so tense that there had been a possibility of war and intrusion. But, when said king had visited, the Queen Regent had been quick to confuse and charm him, both chastising and mothering him, rather than making proper negotiations. Scolded and fussed over, the relatively young man, who had been raised without a mother, had gone home and no war had ever taken place between their kingdoms.
What followed were three days and two nights of absolute misery. Sherlock was despondent and inconsolable. Nothing could give him respite; he barely slept and couldn’t put his mind to anything at all. When nights came, his tired eyes kept wandering towards the entrance of the chapel, while his conscious mind berated him for not seeing that it was for the best if John forgot him. He tried to read one of the books the Prince had brought him, but couldn’t seem to focus and the letters were blurry in front of his eyes. He even caught himself caressing the leather cover lightly, - a sentimental gesture, coming from the unconscious knowledge that John’s warm hands had touched it before. John was warm and Sherlock felt so cold. It was a warm summer night, but he was shivering, sitting in front of a fire, wrapped up into his woollen, dark-grey cloak. It was more than obvious that he wasn’t going to enjoy the time he had been left with as a human and as a person, in spite of accepting his fate.
They always managed to obtain more food than usual during holidays. Around something as widely celebrated as Saint John’s day, also known as summer solstice, (even though they’d celebrated it a couple of nights back), more effort was put into obtaining food. Robert and some other people had long since started making various simple tools, made of wood and stone. But, to catch fish, Robert used baskets that he’d woven from firm twigs. He put bait inside before submerging those fish traps. They were constructed so that the fish could swim into them, but couldn’t escape them. It was rather simple, but efficient; something that people, especially those who lived in villages, that had bodies of water close by, widely used.
John allowed the royal tailor to take his time, making sure the two-months old measurements hadn’t changed, so that he could start the Prince’s new attire for the ball. The tailor asked plenty of questions, such as whether John preferred this type of embroidery or that, showing him the samples, whether he preferred this type of sleeves or that. After a dozen of such questions, John just told the other man that he trusted his taste. There were just a little more than three weeks left before the ball he’d been avoiding thinking about. It meant that he didn’t have much time left in Bavaria, because less than a couple of weeks afterwards he’d be going back home.
She talked, but Sherlock never answered. In fact, he liked to hide his head under his wing, as if preparing for sleep, hoping she’d get the message. But she just sat next to him and told him something about her past. Later she found another pen, whom she befriended, to Sherlock’s relief; maybe he was even a bit glad for her, but he was also glad to have his peace and solitude back.
‘I understand. My shoulder starts playing up sometimes. Just an old wound’, John said sympathetically.
Moriarty snapped the fingers on his right hand, and something started to happen to Sherlock’s body. The ache intensified, he felt his muscles painfully contracting. The world around him was blurry and he couldn’t focus on anything, apart from the fact that everything seemed bigger and the ground was very close now. Had he fallen?
I would like to make it clear that in no way this story is based on films, based on Swan Lake, cartoons (I hate cartoons!) or any modernised version of the Swan Lake ballet (*shudders*). They don’t work for me and I would never find them even remotely inspiring. My inspiration here is the classical ballet, which has always been my most favourite of all.
All too soon, sooner than Sherlock had thought it possible, Mycroft reached the barrier and went through it just before Sherlock collided with it. He started crying and beating against it, and continued until he found himself on the ground, lying on his chest, his wings spread and shaking. There were some of his black and white feathers scattered around him. He wasn’t sure how long he had lain there. Eventually, someone touched his back with their wing, but he tore himself away from the unwanted comfort. Only then, he saw four swans from the flock next to him. He charged at them aggressively, hissing and making them start back before he flew away from them, his wings beating desperately, losing a few more loose feathers in the process.
‘Your Majesty, Queen Martha’, he started, bowing to the regent. ‘I’ve made my choice, as was expected of me’.
‘I couldn’t agree more’, Sherlock shrugged and then got up with a bit of effort. ‘Don’t come closer’, he warned.
‘I’m not good at being a prince, to be honest ’, he replied, leaning his elbows on the stone railing and smiling a little.
‘Hello, boys and girls! I see you’ve had an interesting day today’, Moriarty mocked in his usual sing-song voice. The dead silence was the only answer and he sighed. And then, of course, he turned his attention to Sherlock. ‘Sherly, Sherly, Sherly…’ the sorcerer shook his head with another sigh of disappointment, looming over the injured swan, as he knelt in front of him. ‘As always, you’re absolutely terrible at taking care of yourself’. He reached out to touch the swan’s injured wing, but, suddenly, there was Archie in front of Sherlock after getting out from under his uninjured wing. The cygnet bit Moriarty’s hand, fast and hard, making him yelp. The attack looked more like the one of a venomous snake, rather than of a swan. Archie was good at biting, as some other swans had learned the hard way when they’d first met him.
‘You weren’t expecting a good ending anyway, were you?’ the sorcerer scoffed, ignoring the futile outburst. He pressed himself against a tree, folding his arms on his chest. ‘Do you not know that the original version ends with the Prince and the Swan Queen committing suicide together, because the vow binds the Prince to the liar he promised his heart to? Their suicide causes the power of the spell to backfire and it kills the evil sorcerer himself; his own power. There’s another version, where the sorcerer kills the Prince, and the Swan Queen never turns into a human again, left to mourn her lover, as a swan. Oh, there was another one, where the Prince drags the sorcerer into the lake, where they both die. Too bad the sacrifice doesn’t help the swan one bit. But I think we know how this fairy tale ends for
‘Hello, Sherlock’, he suddenly heard a female voice and froze. He knew this voice. Mary. He turned around just to see her, still in her white gown with white feathers. Only now she was holding a crossbow, more compact than John’s and with only one bolt already loaded into it. She was aiming at him. He lifted his hands in the air in a gesture of surrender, but he knew she would shoot and there was no escape.
Once there was a lit candle in a candleholder placed on the altar, Sherlock continued the examination of the contents of the chest. Among little things one might need for the violin, in another box there was an impressive block of rosin, spare strings for the instrument and hanks of horsehair for the bow. Under this one there was yet another, much bigger, box that contained a lot of tools, such as various types of tweezers, spoons, instruments for making measurements, as well as a pair of balance scales with a set of masses, and many other tools that could be used for experiments, as well as scissors, knives of different sizes and a sharpening stone for them. The box also contained an impressive set of glassware and other equipment for chemical experiments of, at least, small to moderate complexity. In addition, there was a leather pouch with various lenses inside and an elegant sandglass. Another box contained a few other practical things a person might need at some point or another, including quills, a bigger sandglass, a bottle of ink and a stack of paper with each piece having a watermark that indicated what paper mill had produced it. There was one small box in the massive chest Sherlock had almost missed. He fished it out and opened it, just to find a heavy silver locket, a bit too large for wearing (though some wealthy men and women did wear massive jewellery around their necks). When he opened it, he nearly cried out upon seeing the portraits of his parents on the halves of it. The sentimental token made him close his eyes and do his best to control his breathing, whilst trying to swallow down the lump in his throat. When he opened his eyes, he let himself study the images of Mummy and Father. They were older than they had been before Sherlock’s abduction, probably not as old as they were now, but, he believed, the pictures had been painted about six years back. He couldn’t tell for sure (not enough data), but they seemed in good health, apart from the lines on their faces that told him a story of sadness and grief of parents that had lost their child, rather than a story of happy, untroubled ageing. Sherlock let the tears escape his eyes. It was overwhelming. He used one of the boxes to sit down, as his back was getting tired already, and just watched the paintings of the two people he missed terribly and who missed him. Maybe it was really for the best for them to think he was long dead to move on. He hoped they were well.
