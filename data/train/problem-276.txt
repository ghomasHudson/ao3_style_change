Sherlock huffed irritably. "I've booked you an appointment that's to take place in fifteen minutes if we can avoid mid-morning traffic. Your second premolar on the bottom's been chipped and you need it repaired. ASAP."
More pressingly, John's mind caught on the fact that William was presenting himself as John's squire. Something they had not previously discussed at all. Though he supposed it made the most sense, given the circumstances, a nobleman serving as an attendant to a knight, for why else would he be here?
She absolutely beamed when her eyes fell upon Sherlock, despite him physically wilting at the fact that she was not the promised corpse on its way to be ruthlessly examined.
"It's nice to see him acting more friendly towards people again." She went on. "I think you've done a lot of good since you came to live with us. Could you pick me up the large bag of sugar dear? No, sorry, that one. It's there on the bottom shelf. I always seem to run out right in the middle of a recipe. That's a love, thank you.
He felt every moan that pitched its way through John's trachea between his teeth. Biting at the vibrations when they happened. Counter swiping his tongue against the prickling stubble that was just starting to grow out of the flesh across his throat. Sherlock left large evaporating stripes of wetness and reveled in the taste of John's salted skin.
There was a slight groan of the floorboards as Sherlock shifted on his feet and a metallic sound when his hand tightened on the doorknob. But there was no rebuttal. No uppity come back. Just a deep inhale and long exhale and another loaded silence to hang up on the air between them. It seemed that for once in his life, Sherlock Holmes had nothing to say in return. And that was perhaps more devastating.
A look more peculiar than John had ever seen came violently over that long lovely face and with no preamble, warning, or response Sherlock simply stalked forward and held out his hands. He stooped over John's small body with eyes that were raging with starlight and waited for John to release him from his bonds.
Sherlock was quick to answer, looking down at his watch, and then quickly stripping off his autopsy gear. "It depends entirely upon which country it's in and who's receiving it, but the final price is generally between ten thousand and one hundred and sixty thousand quid."
Sherlock tilted his head back upright and fingered his hair, getting it to fall precisely without even having to look in a mirror. With the bandage covered, he looked immaculate as ever sitting straight-backed and proud. "With the lights off and the alarm pulled, it was difficult to tell. Though given the strength of the swing and the height it was at. It's safe to assume that it was one of the men. It was quite helpful that the exits were clearly marked, however, it made it possible to make my escape and return home."
"Oh, for the love of--." Lestrade muttered, fingers pressed into his temples like he was fighting off a headache. His breath fogged strangely out about his head, almost like a halo. "Sherlock. I think we've all had quite enough of your celebrating this..."
He makes sure to look into each of Sherlock's eyes. And says what he says every time they are to be apart now. So that it will never go unsaid between them ever again.
"I'll fix this. Just let me fix this!" She swore and he blinked some more and shifted on his cane as she flew out the door before sitting himself down in that worn sick chair and watched her go. She couldn't fix this with or without the shakes. But the door had stayed open and had left him the perfect view of his new burial ground.
To John's utter surprise, Sherlock drew in closer and delicately wrapped his arms around John's belly, hooking his chin over John's scarred shoulder and finally speaking softly right next to his ear. "You shouldn't trigger Dionaea muscipula without feeding it John, it puts severe strain on the plant." He felt a kiss on his trapezius.

Sherlock took a hard knee to the chest as John's feet slammed down and made his arse arch clear off the bed. Head thrown back with his mouth hanging wide. For a moment he held there as if caught, straining, groaning, quivering as two more lighter strokes in the counter direction sent him over the edge into a roaring silence.
"By edict and mandate of I, High Steward Charles Magnussen, and by the permission given to me by Castle Appledore, we do uphold today the accusations and punishment of the crimes committed by one: Phillip, son of Ander, against the Crown.
John tries to say 'no'. John tries to say 'stop'. 'Wait, I think I'm broken'. 'Wait! Not yet!' But the body he is hugging shifts upward in a horribly limp way and coming unpinned makes his arms loll terribly and the new fire that lights up in his left shoulder burns like a ransacked city.
"D'you want me to take care of this for you?" John asked seductively, keeping his hand poised where it was as he asked, not wanting to assume, but still pulling at Sherlock's bottom lip with gentle suckling kisses. He wanted very much to make Sherlock feel as good and sated as he felt right now. Lying here warm and content, snogging his new found love. He wanted Sherlock to completely understand his willingness to reciprocate.
"Excellent." Sherlock smiled openly and made his way over to the counter to pull on a pair of prophylactic gloves, a large black smock, and safety glasses Molly had laid out for him. He took up the proffered scalpel and waited for Molly and Lestrade to laboriously turn the body back over. "So. I assume we'll be employing the Rokitansky method..."
"I-" John fumbled, feeling stupid, but felt the point important. He had left him in such a state yesterday, he did not want to draw suspicion. "You're makeup...I don't want - if they see..."
John stared at it longingly. "I hope someday you'll play again. I'd very much like to hear it. I bet you play magnificently." John had always been one for music. Especially as it came into his life rarely and infrequently. But every time he heard it, it moved something deep inside him.
"Haven't you something more useful to do than /loom/?" Sherlock asked darkly, startling John from his musings and into the very idea that he could actually do such a thing.
It was only after all this that the King finally dismounted. With his long robe trailing behind him, he seemed to float softly up the steps and took up a position to the side of  the desolate man.
He rewarded himself by stretching out his feet just enough to where the tuberosity of his fifth metatarsal touched John's own tuberosity, clad as it was in ugly green and blue striped socks. He took a long pull and bowled into the last hurdle of John's patient waiting.
He kissed into him harder as John stroked him more fervently. Neither of them making any noise except for the overlapped staccato hisses of their breathing and the soft saliva pop of sticky lips.
The hair on John's arms prickled upright. If it had not been for the armour ensconcing him, John feared the clatter of heart might have been heard outside his body, or perhaps that the infernal organ may have bounced clear out of his chest completely and been trampled by his horse.
And there it was again, another tiny yet monumental shift in their relationship that sent another warm frisson of sentiment licking through John's chest. Sherlock was ceding the floor to him IN FRONT of the Yarders. He was allowing him first crack at the spotlight and treating this partnership as an /actual/ partnership between them. Working as a team.
It was John's turn to stare back now. Like he still couldn't manage to believe this. His eyes nearly filling with tears.
He went to give John a handshake at the same time Sherlock was shoving his jacket at him and pushing the door wide, obviously in a very large rush to leave.
"Drink this." Sherlock says, not allowing any arguments as he practically forces the straw against John's lips. "Please John. The alcohol will counteract the effects of the ethylene glycol I've been putting in your tea. I need you to drink it right now."
A trickle of nervous sweat beaded down the back of John's neck and disappeared into his gorget despite the cool morning as he kept a watchful eye on all the closed doors and windows as they passed out of Umberland Village.
John watched every subtle shift of muscle beneath soft flesh and fabric. The tenuous clench of his abdomen, to the corded roots of his neck. The shoulder-width V set of long and slender feet that allowed him to sway into each stroke, lean into the chords and snap back at the right time. All of it for John.
"/Viruses./ John. Honestly." Sherlock rumbled, inching up the telly's volume a couple bars more. As if to drown out John's indignation.
"Hail fellow." Moran had said with a bit of a chuckle and waited for John to right himself and take in what was truly before him. John had had to blink his eyes back into focus.
"You know of the battle?" John shifted more to get a better look at his Prince, confused as to why a squabble so insignificant as his should reach the ears of Castle Appledore.
Sherlock's chin tipped down and John met him. Mouths pushing, tongues coaxing as they sipped the heady taste of scotch from each other's lips, wrapped up in serendipity. John put one arm around Sherlock's shoulder and couldn't help the groan that escaped him when a long, beautiful hand swiped high and cupped him through his jeans. His whole spine going icy cold while his loins filled with heat. Indecisive goosebumps raising up on his arms. He broke away reluctantly. "But not here. Upstairs. My room."
"Blast!" Sherlock answered, just as a nondescript car parked itself right up against the back of their taxi. John only needed a moment to realize what was going on and why they were caught precisely where they had not wanted to be.
"Oh. Oh, right. Good. Wow. So...you've been in a relationship, then?" Somehow, this seemed to be far more staggering.
He began to move down, extracting himself from Sherlock's hand and encouraging Sherlock to turn onto his back, kissing down the lean, warm spread of his body as he went. He slathered his lips and tongue and teeth all across the breadth of Sherlock's torso. Considering each expanse of skin bared to him to be a sacred thing. A gift to be enjoyed.
Sherlock tucked it back away carefully. "Unlikely. There are two more strands under the collar, I made sure. Telling them so was practically giving it to them on a silver platter. I estimate that it should give us about two hours' head start to interview the murderer before Gregson takes him into custody."
This was it. The moment he had come all this way for. He was about to find out just what sort of a man lived at the very top of a tower in the castle that was the only gateway to the Northern world.
While he'd always taken the time to acknowledge what she said, if only to disregard her, right now he felt inclined to ignore her outright. But he didn't. "I suppose I am." John felt his mouth saying instead. Finally giving her a solid decision on the matter. In any storm, he'd already decided, his compass always pointed towards Sherlock.
The tone was meant to bite, but John was still trying to understand and was staring into the middle distance, his brow held in a perpetual furrow. And that made Sherlock even more edgy. He didn't want John disseminating it. Trying to understand it. God forbid trying to /fix/ it. He just wanted John to accept it and move on.
Charles eyes glinted. "Then you have time still to make the right decision. It is fortunate for me that the war has taken him so far away and with no word as to when he might possibly return. It's quite possible he never shall. There are rumors that the War of the Reichenbach may never end. What would you say to that? Do you truly believe such an unassailable force as Moriarty's Crusade will be forever stalled by an army of your brother?"
John lifts his hands in a token effort of fighting back, but is easily subdued. His hands are pressed back onto the table and the gravity from that alone keeps them there. Somewhere deep inside he's screaming at himself. But his outer body will not move. The lorazepam is overwhelming.
"Lift." Sherlock instructed and pulled his trousers completely off when John's hips floated, dropping them to the floor. "And that, off," he motioned to John's shirt, "and for God's sake John, get those out of my sight." He wafted a whole hand at John's striped socks as though they were an abomination to fashion itself.
Sherlock tucked back his lips, knowing precisely too what it was that would not take form in words between them. And he had only needed John to confirm it.
Sherlock sighed heavily beside him, bored witless. "Meter's running, Sergeant Donovan. May we leave now that the inquisition's over or is it your WANT to be harrassing us into being obstructs into you purported pursuit of 'justice'? Authoritative coersion seems to be one less thing you need to add to your already /brimming/ schedule." His tone was flat and humourless, amalgamating everything he had said. He wanted to go home, his eyes as hard as marbles.
John smiles at him. Large and loopily. Reaching his hand out as though he might be able to touch him from all the way over here.
"Is what you see acceptable to you, Sir John?" Prince Sherlock asked, his voice a low rumble that felt as though it could shake the earth beneath John's feet if he so wanted.
"Of course I do. But apparently not from a credible source. What about after that? Tell me about that. I want to know everything." Sherlock persisted, almost giddy with interest. There was no derision in his voice. No wrath.
"There are a number of rules that I feel need to be made clear to you Captain, if this little arrangement is to continue:
But John's wondrous eyes were now riveted to the apparatus. "What is that?" He asked, almost with a child's sense of wonder. Never having seen its like before.
"So you choose not to expose yourself willingly because when I met you that day at Bart's lab you were so ashamed of the man you had become, didn't even /recognize/ him, that you could not bear it. You did not know who you were anymore, what you were capable of, and to unclothe you would expose this truth and lay you bare in every sense of the word. Correct?"
There it was. The moment in John's life that defined before an after; when time had whittled down to the meeting of man and bullet and divided his life into two epochs. The big bang where fate and circumstance had coalesced to set him on the path towards this ridiculous man.
He had the irrational urge to flee, but there was no where to run. So John simply turned back to the diamond-patched window and tried not to die on the spot.
Unstoppering his bottell, he took a generous swig of ale and wrung a hand down his full beard to clear away any lingering drops. Dark blue eyes scanning the roll of land around him with his heart still heavy but his mind hopeful.
Sherlock was standing when they entered, his violin put away and he bowed deeply when the men entered. And then in the blink of an eye broke into perfectly fluent and perfectly foreign Japanese. If he'd had any forewarning on the matter of today's client, he'd left John completely out of the loop.
"Sherlock inquired earlier tonight about gathering together his medical records. He considers them necessary to give to you." He let his umbrella tilt against the inside of his knee and brought his hands up in the similar pious style Sherlock took when he was roaming through his mind palace. The only difference was that when Mycroft did it, it looked unholy. "So I thought I'd drop them off personally."
"I'm afraid I was premature on my observations. What we have is obligate. We cannot survive without each other."
With Clara at his elbow, John had finally stopped his efforts to press through and lifted his chin. Ready for anything. . .
"Yes." Sherlock said absently, he was stroking his bottom lip with the tips of his forefingers. "How long do you think that deduction took? Saying, perhaps if you had clocked it. How long, do you think?"
Throwing his head even higher back on his neck, giving him one more frigid rasp of his eyes, the King turned his horse wordlessly and rode back into Baker Town.
Lestrade stood outside, holding up a gym bag and a large green thermos. "Thought this might help a bit." He nodded towards the bag, "it's got my work out stuff in there. Might be a little short on 'im but it's about the only thing we've got around here that'll do for now." He craned his neck to see past John's shoulder. "You're just lucky they're clean. They've been in the boot. I haven't made it to the gym yet."  Sherlock mumbled a stuttering, disparaging remark at that, but John just took the proffered items appriciatively. "Ta, very much Greg."
John curled his small body more tightly into the tub, readying himself for dismissal. Naked and ashamed he would be sent away, just like he deserved.
It takes only a moment for Sherlock to deflate, "if you would please, Mrs. Hudson. For both of us." He grits out and she nods briskly, disappearing around the turn looking a lot less ruffled.
"Shut up Sherlock." John muttered half-heartedly and rubbed all the more briskly, avoiding the warmth in his eyes. "Things aren't that dire yet."
John laid a hand gently on the folder, unspun the string from the closure, and fingered the flap open. It would be so easy to know, to learn about all the things that had vexed him regarding the enigma that was Sherlock. His whole history was waiting in that folder...
He nodded to an officer with a familiar face who allowed him to duck under the tape without protest and he half-walked, half-sank his way down the muddy bank to the crime scene below. The closer he got to the Thames, the thicker the sheet of ice crusting over the ground grew and the colder the wind seemed to whip.
He was sprawled over half of John's body. Keeping one of his leg's immobile, with the epsilon axe of John's hip digging up into his guts. Sherlock purposely left his waste touching the side of John's prick. Wanting to keep it desperate for more friction but unable to achieve it as he moved. But the idea was certainly working, if the slight humping of John's pelvis were any indication.
"Of course it concerns me. Everything about you concerns me--oh!" A thought occurred suddenly to Sherlock as he added up the facts. Jumped three steps ahead of the information on hand and came to the correct conclusion. "She's dead. That's why she's in this book. Isn't she?"
It was the third strip of land that he tended to now. And he could already foresee the crop that would sprout from his hand-cast seeds. Come July, the golden stalks of barley would have grown so tall he'd have to take a scythe to it to see the horizon again.
"God I want to touch you. Godfuck. I wish I could touch you." John rambles as he watches Sherlock move. He feels trapped in a straight jacket with his arms all bound up. Which might be a good thing because he thinks he might be losing his mind. "Jesus Christ you're fucking gorgeous. So gorgeous. Ah!" Sherlock's finger slips in and slips deep and John swears he can feel it clear up in his throat.
Smirking, John finished the last of his rye bread and took a final pull from his bottell to wash it down. Then, feeling indulgent, went over to the little red calf and lay down upon her ribs. Her only disturbance being that of a fly that she shook from her ear.
A dark shape circled the sky above him as he bent, blotting out the sun as it grew larger,  closer, spiraling towards the ground. Towards him.
Mycroft slithered through an answer in his usual way. "My brother has denied himself countless things in order to survive in this world, Dr. Watson. But the few things he has chosen to indulge in, he allows to utterly consume him. The violin, his various chemical dependencies, his work. There is no such thing as halfway for him. I feel it pertinent that you should understand this.
William's lip had trembled at that, clearly a sign that John had done something sweet and unexpected and John had had to look away again to keep from collapsing inwards.
Moving quickly, he turned in the halo of Sherlock's stiff arms, coming nose-to-nose with Sherlock's face and a look John couldn't quite decipher. There was a cool, blank expression schooling his long features and not a bit of the sedated pride he'd heard in him from a moment before.
But what would happen to sweet William if John were to point him to the Lord's manor? William was now a consort to the Lord of the Manor. Surely such a precious creature would be snatched up by Moran's men and made an example of. John had heard quite enough about traitor's heads being put on spikes in the larger kingdoms to be wary of such pleasant outcomes.
And Sherlock too was afraid, afraid he might turn into dust beneath John's hands. He needed time to recover from his molestation. For the first time ever it had been done under John's kind eyes and the shame was so acute it felt like it was eating a hole in his chest.
With the sway of a victorious man, Charles exited the screen and took up the tray from the bed. Plucking up his own grape and sliding it seductively into his mouth. John, with his clenched jaw and turned-away eyes, would not deign to look at him.
She looks like she would rather stay and continue to hover, but she's also smart enough to realize that there's something going on between the two of them that needs sorted.
"Yes. It was." Sherlock felt the same, though for entirely different reasons. "I need you to send an e-mail to Mr. Asano."
"There have been two. In fact." Sherlock apparently didn't realize the magnitude of this bombshell he had just dropped. /Two/ relationships? And he'd never even hinted at ANYTHING regarding them? Sherlock finally took offense to John's slackened jaw when it refused to reshut, or perhaps more so to the errant sip still pooled behind John's bottom teeth. "Is that really so surprising?"
Another pulse of that foreign heat tunneled down Sherlock's body. Quick and wicked and never enough. But interesting all the same.
John recalled vaguely when Mr. Asano had thwacked the photo of the fish. "And you took the case...because?" Sherlock was already bent over John's laptop, typing away with both hands, hollowing his cheeks until they made a soft sucking sound. "Sherlock? Since when do you find a /fish/ interesting enough to make a case about it? I know it's not, you even said so, but you're still taking it. Why? You're certainly not doing it for Mycroft."
"I am Detective Inspector Tobias Gregson and I have made it my personal crusade to lead an investigation into the murders of one Mr. Athelny Jones and Mr. Nathan Ollery. Two victims who were both found dead under suspicious circumstances earlier this week. We understand the stranglehold the city's been under concerning these two individuals' deaths and are happy to announce that after an exhausting investigation," he gave a small smile that looked like it strained his face, "certain evidence has come to light which has helped us in bringing in our main suspect."
Sherlock clung to this thought like a drowning man and it was the only thing that made his subsequent abuse almost tolerable.
John's breath comes out shaking when he speaks next. His voice gruff. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry Sherlock. But I have to do this. I have to make this alright. And the only person I am NOT willing to sacrifice is /you/. I just can't. So I'm going to solve this and I'll come back to you and we'll grow old together, alright? But right now I have to fix this. On my own."
But then a warm, solid hand slid across the top of his, and he realized two things; one, was that his hand was gripping the end of armrest like a claw, and two; that he had pinched his eyes shut. When he opened them, Sherlock was tilted over him very closely, becoming everything he saw. It was immediately disarming and his hand released its death hold on the chair.
Upon it, John saw five of the ten devil's foot mushrooms that he had brought back from Baskerville Forest. Their shriveled black and red caps had been pierced through with a long metal hook and they were left to dry in a line, cracking down the middle, creating a cloven hoof shape, just as Sherlock had described.
The look on the detective's face was genuine enough to dispel most of John's anger, because it meant that it /had/ at least affected him in some way, and John sagged like a bag losing air. "Look." He said more gently. "I'm not trying to be an arse here. What happened is already done with, we can't change it. The real point I'm trying to make is that next time, whatever the circumstances, just include me, alright? I would like for us to work together." He made sure to hold Sherlock's eyes, driving home his sincerity. "I am with you. One hundred percent. Alright?"
"What the hell do you think you're doing?" Sherlock turned on him instantly, wriggling out of reach and shouting as if John had just done him a great disservice. "And don't call me Sherlock! God. We're undercover in case it's slipped your mind!"
John felt loose and warm and wholly grateful that this little keyhole peek had even been allowed to take place. It became obvious then, that Sherlock failed to begin relationships simply because they ended up as disappointments, choosing an easier road to avoid them altogether. He made a little motion for Sherlock to stand.
"Expected where? Wha-Sherlock! Where are we going?" Caught up in his wake, John grabbed up his coat, pulling himself into it while simultaneously jamming his feet into his shoes. He was out the door in moments, following the thundering feet that were already halfway down the stairs.
His eyes opened for a momentary glance. One so quick he could barely register the shapes that made his overhead world, but like fate he found those lustrous knife eyes of Sherlock Holmes' looking down on him and with such a look of open hunger that it set John Watson atremble. He could not say the word. Would not.
John was shaking his head, leaning in with his hands clasped behind his back and looking with a more clinical lens. There was only so much he could do for the man now. "It would have been too catastrophic for his body to deal with the loss of both organs at the same time. Both excisions have been professionally cauterized, but it would have been too much trauma on his system. He would have gone into metabolic shock and wound up dead in a short time anyway. It was a bloody miracle he was up and walking as it was."
"These were a gift." Brother Michael went on about the roll as John pulled out a vial that had managed to catch his eye. He held it up to the light of the fire where it seemed to come alive. In it was a viscous golden liquid that was slow to move when he tipped it. It was as though someone had taken the sunshine and melted it down. When he was encouraged to unstopper it and to sniff it, it was heavy with sweetness.
John's voice had risen to a shout, slightly shrill with an undercurrent of desperation and he lowered it to a fierce whisper. "My point is, you engaged an enemy with no forethought. No surveillance. You had no plan. For Christ's sake, you didn't even know what you were walking into. The only thing you did right was to pick a neutral territory, yeah?" He scowled as a smirk began to curl at Sherlock's lips, chasing it away. "No! Even with THAT you couldn't have left out the goddamned theatrics. Instead of going someplace in public, somewhere /safe/, you were too busy being a show off and picked the pool where Carl died and it nearly backfired in your face. In both our faces!"
"I see your new garments fit you well." Sherlock said, pleased, as he gave John a once-over. "Hopefully they are to your liking."
The exchange of trousers wasn't that bad. He had nice legs and didn't hold his horrors there. It was finding himself with all his buttons undone and the placket of his shirt held together in his hands that was the problem. Trying to desperately squash the hot flood of warring emotions pinballing through him. Embarrassment. Shame. Terror. Excitement.
Unable to work his lands alone and therefor unable to pay his debts, the Lady of the Manor reclaimed William's lands and with it, William himself. John had tried to persuade William into moving in with him and his sister and her wife, but William had been afraid of what the Lady of the Manor might do now that he was singled out and sure to be accounted for, and so instead felt that it was in his best interest to marry the Lady of the Manor's son to save himself the grief.
I think that's it. as always, thanks for sticking with me!!! we're almost at the end! can you believe it?
John sighed out of his nose. "Alright. So what about the previous victim? Mr. Jones? Can't we open him up too and see what's missing from him? That could give us some more clues on what precisely he's looking for." He noticed Lestrade and Molly's faces take on a pinched look as he said it.
She had them stop the trolley in the middle of the aisle, giggling. "Or was it crocodiles? I can never remember what those silly things were called. Well, anyway, I'll leave you to it. You come find me by the magazines when you're finished dear. I know I walked into something earlier and I think it's probably a good idea for you two to make up. Alright, love? I'll just be right over here."
"No, I just--" but it really didn't sit well with John, this leaning tower of sickness currently taking space on their dinner table. He couldn't let it pass with silent good humour. He rubbed at the prickle at the back of his neck. "Well, yes. I think I object to bacteria being brought here. Call me crazy, seeing as how I don't mind the other stuff all that much  given the state of our fridge, but just not ...this."
"He already has." William had whispered and John's arms had dropped from around him in stunned shock. Tears finally spilling as he took a step back. Two.
But what would Sherlock be expected to do tonight? The wooden cage around his groin was an absolute hindrance that had to be dealt with, but he had woken up sticky with John's name on his lips enough times to know what it meant and the general idea of what the outcome should be.
"Please." John wheezed again, unable to keep from putting his hands on his knees. He felt like he was going to collapse. His back protested bitterly. "...please..."
By mid-morning, they had reached the most reassuring landmark that they were not far away from Castle Appledore, merely a few more hours ride : the Diogenes Crossing.
He couldn't help the burst of filthy lust that washed over him when he heard the wet /flup!/ of the anal plug leaving Sherlock's orifice. Felt his guts' resistance in letting it go. John just barely registered the noise as it thumped to the floor discarded when he became suddenly too preoccupied with pressing his fingers up against Sherlock's yawning entrance, moaning when he was able to finger the loose muscles of Sherlock's external and internal sphincters immediately. So plied were they, so stretched, that he was able to slip both fingertips up and in side by side (and could have possibly included a third) feeling the peculiar viscosity of old lube coating the anoderm. He felt Sherlock's muscles flutter ineffectually to try and close the gaping hole. Close around his fingers. He would have sold his soul for a mirror right then. He'd always had a thing for dilating muscles. A relieved whimper from Sherlock brought John's lizard brain to heel. "Wha--? How long? How long have you been wearing that?"
John snorted derisively, shaking his head. "Ninety-three? That's it?" He folded his arms across his chest, letting that dangerous smile mold around his face. "That's not good enough Sherlock. Not even close."
All of the stainless steel tables inside were devoid of said corpse, though there was a rolling trolley sidled up next to one of them, laden with tools, as if a body was meant to arrive at any moment.
He would shove Gladstone from his crotch when she got too friendly and asked her if she was going to eat him when he died. They played with sticks from the yard in the morning. Against the crash of the sea. And drank himself into vicious oblivion at night.
Sherlock felt the hatred curl low in his belly at the smear of this reflection in the window. At the man who kept him prisoner here. But steadfastly kept his eyes upon the glass. Finding the morbid display outside to be far less foul to look upon.
"And I see your appetite has begun to improve as well. How fortuitous. I expect the physician will see an improvement in your humours this morning." Sherlock, to the High Steward's delight, swallowed the grape whole.
John stayed silent, not wanting to break the strangely comfortable moment between them with conjecture.
"Perhaps you are one." John raised an eyebrow and licked his lips as he looked back down at Sherlock's mouth. "You've bewitched me."
He didn't understand the hot rushes of frantic air on his neck, simply swiped blindly at his sweat-soaked curls and tried to soothe the jack rabbit pace of Sherlock's heart. The man in his lap was trembling wildly.  He whispered to him soothingly. "Slow down, love. Slow down. Shh. You're going too fast. We don't have to hurry this." How could something that had been so beautiful and intimate mere moments ago turn suddenly into such hysteria in a matter of seconds? "It's alright. I have you. Slow down. Tell me what's wrong."
The back door led to a hallway that stretched on for twenty meters that was pitch black, save for narrow chevrons of yellow lights beckoning them onward towards a shuddering, riotous terminus that looked like an explosion of deafening bass and technicolor neon.
The War of the Reichenbach had been at its beginning when he had made his foolish error. All stemming from a campaign that was massacring its way up from the South called the Crusade of the Burning Heart. Led by the despot King James Moriarty of Westwood, the Crusade claimed to be 'cleansing' the wicked land of its wicked ways through fire and bloodshed, marching under the sigil of a heart wreathed in flame.
"I can't use those. The handles aren't long enough." He replied. Pushing the pin into the foam board. He held up his eventual masterpiece at arm's length, inspecting the spacing.
The three foot long arowana slid methodically through the water, its large black eye watching everything as it circled the limits of its five hundred and seventy liter tank sitting resplendent in the middle of the waiting room. Giving patients a chance to admire it from all sides.
And his method? To simply pull up a chair beside Prince Sherlock's bedside and read to him aloud the entirety of 'De alchimia opuscula complura veterum philosophorum', which was a compendium of work by many noted alchemists of the time that brother Michael knew Sherlock to be a literary student of.
John took what little consolation he could from seeing the man's torso moving with shallow breaths to reassure himself that the man was still alive.
"You've arrived just in time John. Look. Some kind soul had the good decency to die." He stepped aside with an almost reverent bow.
Sherlock removed his hand only long enough to shoot John a withering look, as if what John had just described was something totally beneath his scientific endeavors. He took a large breath to signify he was about to treat John to a thorough lecture and began. "The stomach of all species of Avialae are divided into two pouches, John. If you'd paid attention to ANY nature program we've watched, you'd know this.
John bullied his way in beside Sherlock, getting an appraising look from the bodybuilder before he leant close to address both of them simultaneously. "As I was about to say; if either of you gentlemen care to make your night a LOT more interesting I have just what you're looking for. A tenner will buy you one Mandy, a score'll buy ya two and a spare. Prices go down when the numbers go up and there's nothing like the proper lady to make a gay man see straight. So, what's your damage?" The man was talking loudly, but it was still a struggle to be heard over the din.
Sherlock saw his searching and rolled his eyes, or a close approximation, at least. "I d-d-didn't asp-p-p-perate any water, J-j-john. I'm f-f-f-fine." Sherlock tried his 'don't be an idiot' look, only to abort it halfway through to pinch the Belstaff tighter around his body at an especially hard fit.
John managed to compose an answer for his Prince this time. "Yes your Highness. I did not know if--"
Sherlock's eyes flicked back and forth from the door to the assistant's back. "Your tooth was chipped, it was the perfect opportunity."
Eager to stymie the pain cracking through him, John takes three large pulls, feeling the velvet burn of it as it courses down into his belly.
Sherlock raises his head up and smiles a small smile when he sees John's sincerity. "Yes. Of course I will."
"Yes. We're BIG FANS of your work." Sherlock stepped closer to them, utilizing his uncomfortable proximity to make Dr. Sipe release John's handshake. They were both the same height, and John was witness to a crashing storm of beautifully intense gazes.
John's legs ratcheted up from beneath them automatically, knowing without asking. Strong thighs skittering up lean flanks. Black pupils blooming across blue until they were the only color to be seen under half sunk eyelids. Desperately needy for absolution. "It's not your fault."
John did not understand the smirk that hooked Brother Michael's mouth at this, but only watched as he took a sprig of something from another vial and crushed it in his fingers over the stew before throwing the stick in with it. The smell of it, sharp and deep, overtook John and his stomach growled loudly. "Forgive me for being bold, but isn't the point of being a monk to abstain from indulgences?"
The cow gave another great bellow as they came to a stop and John smiled a crooked smile at her impatience. "She's around here somewhere. Just hold on." He assured her, before cupping his hands and calling out, "heya!" He pressed two fingers against his bottom lip and whistled loudly.
But for all their trouble they had merely brought back a lucid corpse. An empty husk of a man still troubled by the burden of his conscious of all that he had done wrong. By his loneliness. A man still choosing to be closer to death than to life.
A hope that things would be better now. That life would not be so goddamned awful. At least so far as Harriet and Clara had been concerned. If they had only been aware of the burden John still shouldered. . .
Captain Watson boiled to the surface, witnessing a situation getting out of hand and deciding to take control. He risked his arms beneath Sherlock's arse once again, taking a couple slams that felt like they would tear his limbs from his shoulders before he got the mad man to stop.
"Please, John." Sherlock beseeched him and in a gesture of promise, held out his hand. John's eyes went wide. "In order for me to do the things I want to do to you, you must first tell me your own story of how you came to be here. I wish to know you before. . ." he felt his cheeks warm, embarrassment flame through him. "Knowing you."
John took a sharp inhale, as if being sprayed by blood once more and came back to himself with a shock, realizing what he had just confessed. It had been the darkest choice he had ever made and he hadn't even been brave enough to see it through.
"And I want to apologize for your wall. You can take it out of my rent. I don't mind." He adds quickly and with a last genuine smile, zips up his Haversack and leaves.
"Although, on the bright side, I think some did manage to land in Anderson's shoe." Lestrade quipped, and elbowed Molly companionably.
Lestrade read his features and the furrow in his brow deepened. "Yeah well, trust me when I say that he didn't take it very well when you solved that cold case, Sherlock. /Especially/ without being able to provide the murder suspect. He thinks you're holding out on him due to your guys' previous ...history."
The doublet the man wore was pale yellow, embroidered with an intermittent pattern of dark gray flowers, while the pumpkin-shaped breeches surrounding his slim hips were of the opposite contrast; rich charcoal fabric decorated with delicate yellow thread of the same design. The long black robe about his shoulders whispered as it kissed the floor, lined with fur, coming clear down to ankles that were clad in perfect white chausses embellished with golden thread.
He pounded down the stairs, hard left, and back. Not stopping to knock this time. Hand on the doorknob. "Sherlock. I'm coming in."
"You are my type." He tilted his head like a puppy that didn't know what the question it'd just been asked had actually meant. "I'm choosing you because /you/ are what I want."
"No. I can feel you, John. Not yet." He rumbled against the soft flesh beneath John's jaw, then resumed his mouthing. The strong muscles of John's pectinate line dilating around the base of Sherlock's fingers, fighting the buck in his hips. John was too wildly lost to last long enough for that.
"A friend?" John asked, nodding his head towards the object. Sherlock was standing a little ways away from him now, his back towards his room. He had his eyes locked on John's face, dissecting every twitch of his expression, wanting to know desperately what John thought of him and his eccentricities. It had been a very long while since he had willingly let someone into this room whose opinion he truly cared about.
"Oh. Don't tell me you've forgotten him so soon. He'll be so upset. You left quite an impression on him, young man, that's for certain. He hasn't shut up about you since the pool."
She cocks her eyebrow at his cheek. "I'm afraid you're in no position to negotiate, young man. I understand that this must be hard for you, admitting defeat. Having to show your cards with all your bets on the table. A bit of deja vu, is it not?"
The crowd around him suddenly became flash framed in a series of wild, flailing positions. Arms up. Mouths open. Gyrating, twisting, writhing, and grinding, as the lights went on and off as if a hundred paparazzo were flash bulbing the crowd in an effort to catalogue their pleasure.
It was small as fuck and she'd been able to pull it with her '95 Vauxhall Corsa and Jesus if it doesn't look like the prettiest little sunshine yellow coffin he ever could have ever asked for.
John chuckled, reaching for the closest item of clothing, which happened to be his own shirt wrinkled by the headboard, and wiped himself dry. "Current trends dictate that smoking's bad for you. So it's pretty obvious you don't keep up on them at all."
John was able to wait until Charles had turned his back and made it halfway down the hall before he had to throw out an arm to brace himself upright. He was dying. He was sure of it. It was only by his strength of will alone that he did not crumple to his knees.
"You do." William had assured him, squeezing him more tightly. Forcing the air from his lungs as John found his own hands gripping far too tightly into the back of William's tunic and forced himself to let go.
Lestrade prickled slightly at the insinuation. "Now just a minute. He can't /forbid/ me to do anything." Then deflated. "But he was very, very clear about his rules. I'm to consult with him on this case as a sort of partner. We're working together...mostly. It's not the best of circumstances, but there's not much I can do for it; he's mates with the Chief Superintendent y'see. They'd have me sacked if I put up a protest."
"You admitted to me yourself at dinner that you hadn't slept with Sarah yet and at the time I didn't see, but now NOW it's all so clear! It's not as if you weren't given ample opportunity to be invited to her flat; I could tell from her cheek capillaries and continual body proximity to you that she would have been willing to bed you the very night of the Chinese circus. Well, of course, if it hadn't turned out the way it did...
No longer able to help with anything now that John is settled, Sherlock is left standing awkwardly beside him, staring at his feet like he's waiting for a hammer to drop. John opens his mouth to speak, but just then Mrs. Hudson swoops in with her unerring timing and sets two cuppas down on his table before quietly excusing herself.
The Queen Mother purses her lips. "Oh for goodness' sake, I'm fairly certain that Dr. Watson is more of a threat in drowning himself with drool than he is of attacking me. Now go."
Some thirty feet ahead of them, a raised balcony had been built straight into the cliff side, free from any sort of purchase upon the ground and came to an even height to their  horses' shoulders. The platform was hemmed in by a golden balustrade that was only accessible by the two wings of low stairs that curved in on either side.
Its sharp talons took no pause in spearing the tiny thrush in place like an iron maiden. Gathering up its wild feet so that they would not wound, before using its hooked beak to tear the speckled feathers from the creature's small breast. Clearing a spot to feed.
But Sherlock's arms only squeezed more tightly across John's shoulders, pressing them together so firmly that it seemed he too was trying to give John the osmosis he wished for. "So your phobia of medical equipment covering your face stemmed from..." Sherlock began, not finishing as he felt John nod minutely against him. Feeling John's skin break out in a wash of goosebumps. Feeling the smear of wet eyes.
He stops briefly by the Queen Mother, but she waves him off. "Thank you but no. And it doesn't look as though Dr. Watson will be having any tea either. I'm afraid we'll have to move straight on to the savouries."
Sherlock pierced him shallowly now, experimentally. Getting pushed out instantaneously as the muscle constricted. A surprised groan crippled by a half pant emerged from John's mouth as he fought involuntarily against Sherlock's long starfished fingers. His heels skittering on the bedspread.
"Ah! So you DO know what it is. Then you also know that it's caused by a prion that can be present in brain tissue and that its effects on anyone who happens to ingest it are completely incurable.
Sherlock did, meeting John's curled torso that couldn't wait for the time it took him to move. This time, Sherlock let John lead the mission of their mouths. Allowing him full access to the territory that most often had people steering well clear of him and let him take his fill. John needed this.
"I didn't know you had a tattoo." Sherlock said, not fazed in the least. He leaned over to inspect John's arm even more closely. Tracing the fine black lines of the tasteful combination of the Northumberland Fusiliers' and the Royal Army Medical Corps'  insignias tattoo that took up most of his right bicep with fascinated eyes. John quickly shoved the laptop against him and all but pushed him out the door. "Out Sherlock! Out. OUT!"
The ocean surged rhythmically against the bay beneath him. Eating away at the world. It was a miracle and a half he even made it down at all.
There was the sound of mild surprise, followed by a brief conversation. Charles' voice was too soft to understand, but whatever it was that they were speaking about clearly ended in the form of a question. And Sherlock's answer to this was an unmistakable 'no', followed by Charles speaking to him again. Explaining something.
"You're sorry?" John rebuked, the anger blistering inside him made his voice loud. "You're sorry? For what? Sherlock, you have nothing to be sorry for."
After a moment, shaking off his surprise, Prince Sherlock drew himself to his full height and stepped back, tilting just so into the light to put himself on display. He was fully aware of the effect this gave and he preened as though he were a bird, letting John Watson, humble beggar that he was, look his fill.
Sherlock's eyes swam with a note of trepidation at that statement, like a cloud passing in front of the sun. But he didn't allow John enough time to pursue it, instead crushing the doctor's thin mouth beneath his in one single kiss and swirling away towards the door. "Come on."
The assistant held the door for them both. "Oh, absolutely. A calming influence is always welcome. And not to worry, Mr. Sipe's gentle as a lamb when he works. Although we do have the option of sedation dentistry if you should like."
John pursed his lips in consternation, looking down at his socks. "I believe I /did/ just finish telling you about my time in hospital where a bacteria almost /killed me/. So, yeah, it might a bit. But look, I'm not saying you can't do it at all. I'm just saying not here. Alright? Take your bacteria somewhere else."
John took the blanket to Sherlock's hair to cover his oscillations, soaking what would wick away and curling it resignedly about his shoulders to catch the rest.
But when he was asked to sit and William had bent to help him with his boots, John's stomach had given a nervous swoop. Did he look the part that Sherlock clearly wanted him to? Would he live up to all the expectations that would be made of him? What would he be tasked to do? Would he--
Which, apparently, wasn't as angry as he'd assumed because the levity managed to make John crack a small smile, which he quickly schooled into a scowl. He was mad at him. Mad at the lengths he would go and the trouble he would get into simply in pursuit of the Work. But that also meant that he couldn't be mad at all, seeing as how the most crucial ingredient to John's previous rage had been that Sherlock had been alone. And right now, thank god, he wasn't.
He crossed his last T and closed the folder, stripping himself of being a doctor with the finality of unhooking his stethoscope from about his neck and closing it away into his drawer. That facet of him slipped off easily. It had been a welcome shift in mentality. The break he needed. Time away from the enigma that was Sherlock and this hot cold, stop start mess he'd gotten himself into.
So he blinks, then blinks again, clearing the last tendrils of the nightmare from his mind while calmly taking in the fist-sized depression now decorating the wall just below Sherlock's picture frame of flies and larvae. He stands stunned for only a moment when he finds his hands empty.
He was shuffling the tiny boxes, arranging them in a line based on their contents. He tilted his head only fractionally to acknowledge John's entrance, but didn't look up. And despite being fully dressed once again, John suspected he hadn't gone to sleep at all.
But he immediately squashed the buoyed warmth that threatened to wash over him. Sobering just in time for Sherlock to emerge from his room, slipping the last of his buttons into place and tucking the bottom of his favoured plum-coloured shirt into his trousers when they both caught eyes. Neither man able to properly stifle their smiles.
"Hospital. Steady as you can," Mycroft says to the driver and just as John's able to feel the effects of his drink take hold of him and begin to numb the pain, they're being spirited away.
Sherlock did it once more, repositioning himself with his own arse in the air for a better angle, his penis tilting heavily beneath him and this time he did not draw back for a rest, he stayed in the tight little ring, pushing further and further in as it tried to close around him, wriggling it as much as would allow.
"You are a conscientious lover, one who puts other's pleasure above your own. Just as you do your life. You are a student of medicine and therefore have considerable knowledge as to the delicacies of human anatomy. A man with deadly fingers and the familiarity of each and every erogenous zone. Clever combination.
But there was nothing. No response. No comment. No derision. The only indication that he hadn't turned into a bloody statue at the touch of high humidity was that his palms had come up to press together in front of his chin.
"Well, of course, you weren't /actually/ brilliant enough to realize that you had solved it. It took me to correlate the specifics. But you were the catalyst John. Press play."
John thrashed and cried out more loudly as Sherlock did it again, more insistent this time and this time John pressed  back towards him wantonly. "Hhmmmn. Sh'lock...please. Ah!" A sheen of sweat had broken out over his heaving chest. His cock weeping untouched against the soft curve of his clenched belly.
It had been a surprise to them all when John'd finally been well enough to stand and then learned that he'd been too fucked up to accomplish it. MRIs and physical assessments had revealed no cause of the feebling musculature that was crippling him. No physical evidence. It was all invisible. Just like him.
"Oh for god's sake!" The high snipe of investigator Philip Anderson started up like gunfire. "I can't believe you're allowing this! I thought we were waiting for the doctor so the self-proclaimed "sociopath" could LEAVE! Now we've got two bloody people we don't have any need for at what's clearly NOT a crime scene." He gesticulated wildy as he whined, his loose full body forensic suit he was wearing was pierced with the light, giving him the illusion of a flailing insect caught in spider's silk. "This is an accident scene, NOT a murder investigation. Sir! Sir?"
Ever the peacekeeper, John took three steps back and opened the door wide for her, pinning her eyes with a look that he hoped conveyed his want for her to trust him as much as she'd been trying to get him to trust in her. /I'm as safe as I choose to be, Sally. Everything's fine. I don't need minding./
John cleared the thickness from his throat. "Murray was still questioning the prisoner while we walked, trying to get the name of the village he'd come from when the blokes up ahead located an IED half buried in the dirt and we decide to detonate it on spot. There was enough time and it was the safest thing to do.
His voice rolled like thunder now. "Putting aside the fact that you would have to explain the cause of your scar, in effect exposing your life choices to criticism, the only remaining explanation is that it is simply because you don't know if you possess the necessary stamina to fulfill the needs and desires of a lover. You're operating under the false assumption that women will consider you to be an upstanding gentleman by holding back, when in reality you have shamed yourself into thinking that any offering but the absolute best during your first consummation would be considered a failure.
When he had made himself (and the bathroom mirror) once more decent, John reamerged fully dressed to find the flat awaiting him in a comfortable quiet. The television had been turned on in the sitting room, but turned down low, reminding him that there was a bigger, broader world still going on normally outside the walls of 221B despite its enitre axis having shifted irrevocably.
And at this, the monk placed a pudgy hand atop the wooden cross around his neck and the strap of his satchel as if holding his chest together, letting his his laughs peter out into breathy chuckles, still shaking his head. "Heavens no, dear fellow! Quite the opposite in fact. But perhaps we had better take my mission indoors, hm? I have much to explain and would be very grateful if you would join me for a fine evening meal to tide us over on our way back."
"I am." Sherlock said, meeting his eyes. "But it's customary to have a post-coital cigarette. Don't you keep up on current trends?"
"Do not speak to him." Sherlock barked, making his way behind the triptych screen as the woman followed. This was obviously an exercise they had performed many times. "Collect your business and go."
"Don't they? That's highly inconvenient." He said, piercing a flesh fly like he was threading a needle. "And can you pick me up some cheek swabs? I've run out."
"Fudo Myo-o." He muttered. And John blinked up at him, shocked out of his deliberate breathing patterns.
"And someday I will. This I vow to you on my life," his voice had a dark power. "I will kill that man and you will be set free. Free to live happily for the rest of your years as your own man." And to look in his stunning blue eyes was to know that there was never a promise made that could have been more true.
In Afghanistan, he'd been at least one step ahead at all times; clear of his orders and crystal on the objective. Letting circumstances fall as they may. He performed his duties admirably, with diligence and esteem. But back in London again, and embroiled in the capriciousness that was Sherlock Holmes, John felt he was always at least a step behind. Holding on with both hands simply because he had no choice. Shining only in the glaring refraction of the mad man's genius. It took adjusting, he knew. Time and patience.
John reached over and slapped a gloved hand down on Sherlock's bouncing knee, stilling it, before drawing it away. His face turned towards the window. Sherlock took it as the game of chess it was, making his own move to counter.
And all of a sudden the High Steward was pressing out the door, carrying before him a tray laden with a golden plate that overflowed with a myriad of fruits, vegetables, various breads, and three different kinds of meats.
"You have been in pain for some time." Sherlock whispered and it felt like he was speaking of so much more.
Sherlock clicked over to the next slide with more force on the button than necessary and John watched the hidden mechanics of that long pale throat as it swallowed and swallowed. For a moment Sherlock's eyes are shiny with shame, before it's instantly supplanted with resolve.
"No. I liked him, sure, but just as a regular sort of bloke. I wasn't chatting him up or anything." A thought tickled John's periphery, one that made the hair on his arms stand up. "I'm with you, Sherlock. I'm not going to beetle off with somebody else. Is that what you're worried about? We're together."
"Truthfully, it would be more of an egregiously biased observational study, than an experiment," Sherlock corrected himself, his voice muffled against John's gracilis, "but I would like for you to indulge me."
Inside the Watson's cruck house, John Watson had lain on his belly, moaning with the abandon of one in the throes of deep fever. He was being tended to by two women who had been doing the best they could. And were, against all odds, succeeding.
All this information stunned John, but there was only one feature of importance that stood out to him. "So...i-in fact," John stuttered, scarcely able to believe it. "You do not wish to marry him?"
"You won't be needing your purse, Mrs. Hudson." Sherlock spoke without tearing away from John's gaze, "John and I will buy the shopping today. We've just solved a case." He pulled the small clutch from her hands and threw it onto the chair by the door.
If he were to confess, John had never actually had to courage to seek out a reflective surface to completely see all the damage that he had wrought upon himself. And right now he desperately wished that he had.
The prisoner's face was sunken and deathly pale. The rags that stood in place of clothes were hanging from his gangly body.
Three more pulls sent him tumbling, careening, falling and flying over the edge into orgasm. He let himself go down Sherlock's mouth in three heavy, almost painfully full spurts. Claiming the mouth that took everything and gave nothing back. Claiming it for his own.
The dead man had been of medium height, with blondish hair and a muscular build. His chin canted up oddly on the headrest block and there were clear plastic bags over his head and hands to keep evidence in place. These were removed slowly and sealed carefully.
"As well wishers began to gather at the castle gates, more details emerged of the Queen Mother's final hours. Her doctors had been called this morning after her condition had deteriorated. The Queen and other members of her family gathered at her bedside. A local clergyman was called to say prayers.
And then the body above him no longer belongs to Bill because the tattoos are disappearing. Blanching white and seeping away like milk overtaking a picture. And now the six foot stretch of Sherlock is writhing above him with a rictus stretched across his beautiful face, pinioned by John's cock and trying desperately to control a situation that was well beyond his control. New words pushing through that pouty red mouth:
And was overwhelmingly grateful when William did not look back, keeping his eyes fixed upward upon Castle Appledore. He seemed content to let John look his fill.
The decree stated that should the King of Appledore die in battle; High Steward Charles was to marry Prince Sherlock within three days. No expenses spared. The only stipulation being that should Sherlock agree to the marriage while Mycroft still lived, that too would be granted.
Sherlock arsed himself enough to tip his head back to see what John was talking about, then gave a dismissive grunt and curled back up. Dull.
"Your Highness." John said back, tipping his head in a bow, before reaching to his belt and untying the small bag from his waist and handing it over.
The large gray rosettes on his shoes shuddered as he moved, his heels clicking. His broadly cuffed hands floated delicately in front of him, fingers twitching out as though drawn magnetically to the young man inside.
The creep of exhaustion, which had been dogging him since the hall, makes its move into the empty space left inside him and blooms wide, overtaking everything.
But he can't! Doesn't Sherlock see? /That/ is precisely what's wrong! He is suffocating and trapped and his chest is  not working and there's something wrong with his   a r m s...
Sherlock rocked back after a while, leaving John panting and flushed with kisses, his eyes opening to inky black pools and laid down between John's calves. He used his hands to knead the soft skin at John's inner thighs, plying his adductor muscles, smearing his fingertips along the slashing length of his sartorius, externally mapping John's sublime architecture while John splayed his legs a little bit wider around him and remained none the wiser.
At Tesco, John was deemed trolley pusher, as he often lost his focus, and Mrs. Hudson floated before him, muttering to herself, asking questions he occasionally did not answer, and making decisions on food for the both of them. Currently, they were puttering around in the baking aisle.
"Oh. That's a shame." John saw the exact moment Sherlock dismissed her from his mind forever. "Best to let her down easy I suppose."
Wanting to give Sherlock all the privacy he could, John went back to staring at the fore post of the bed, finally able to swallow down the bitter lump of rage in his throat at the treatment of his beloved. But his false gift of privacy could not hold when the High Steward did something strange and produced a small key from the collar of his doublet on an impossibly long ribbon.
"He'd take them all if they were trying to hide the identity, wouldn't he? So...trophies maybe?" Lestrade said in a way that spoke of macabre experience, joining in. "I think it's unlikely that two men just happened to get the same set of teeth pulled out of their heads right before they died, though I guess that would match up with your dentist theory Sherlock..." His voice petered off and look of concern suddenly creased Lestrade's face. "Sherlock?"
"What else am I to do John? I've nothing left! I've no one!" William had beseeched him, cupping his swelling eye. His face already a riot of desperation.
"If you are quite done grousing!" Sherlock finally snaps as her continued 'helping' only hinders their process further, "perhaps you could make yourself /actually/ useful and go and make John some tea!"
"Oh cheers! Glad that's settled then." John slapped his hand down on the table, reclaiming the slipper he'd lost to the floor and padding over to fill a glass from the tap. Not entirely sure how to handle his friend when his words twisted up something inside him.
John fought his smile at the analyticality of it all and the deep, bright hunger that bloomed throughout his body. He trusted Sherlock to care for him. "Alright."
"I think I'm ready to hear more about this." His clinician's eye looked over the dressing, which had begun to be stained pink with blood. "Why someone was wielding an axe at your head. You said it was a poker game." He gave the side of Sherlock's neck a distracting squeeze as he peeled back the bandage. "What were you doing to piss 'em off so much? Counting cards?"
The tiny flame was too dim to cast much distinction upon the young man's rawboned features. Only bright enough now to limn the long thin steeples of his fingers as they were pressed up to his lips. His hands resembling the stilted arches of a roofless church as he observed his feathered visitor and came back to himself.
But just as the High Steward opened his mouth to deny him again, Sherlock's tentative voice called through the door. "Captain?"
It was cold enough to see his breath as he stepped out of the taxi and John pulled his collar up against it. Sherlock was already a dark smudge off the side of the bridge and nearing the river, flapping around in his exaggerated manner. He had bolted from the taxi almost before it'd come to a complete stop.
Billowing cheeks, a large round nose, and rolling eyes bulged grotesquely above the conflagration. Wild hair splaying away from the heat in enormous whorls.
Caddyshack is a nickname idea I made up from the movie involving Bill Murray the actor about golf and gophers.
"Oh, it's fine, love. Just fine. Although that jumper you spilled tea on's got to hang over my bath for a bit longer dear. It's still damp. I'll bring it up later when it's all nice and dry. And Sherlock, I've sent your suits off to the cleaners, and the rest of your unmentionables are in here with John's. I didn't know if you two shared a dresser yet, but I folded them together anyway."
Too many thoughts and excuses came flooding over each other. "I never...it was...it didn't..." he cleared his throat in an attempt to steel himself. "What I did in the army...that was...IT was ...complicated."
He was still as beautiful as John remembered him, in fact, since having been married into a higher social class and now able to eat regular and substantial meals, he had grown even more handsome. The entire breadth of his bones had been laid over with enough flesh and muscle to make him look healthy. Virile. Gorgeous.
"And how does that mean it's a 'he'?" John asked, causing Sherlock to turn his irradiating attention upon him.
John paused briefly, staring at the empty mouth of the stairway, unsure how much time he should take..perhaps he should wait until he was bidden...the choice was made for him when he heard Sherlock's deep voice call to him. "Come in Captain. It does either of us little good to have you loiter outside."
"Are you now?" The backhanded saccharine was almost too much to absorb. "I suppose that's a point I could possibly concede to." He said warmly.
Smirking, Charles fingered beneath his own ruff of feathers and brought up a long ribbon like the line on a bucket that dipped into a deep and terrible well. A small key surfacing from the depths of his doublet. Warmed next to his skin.
The man whom John had formerly thought of as the King paused here and behind the veil of the parchment he held aloft, met and held John's gaze for the first time since he'd met him with a cold, calculating stare. A small smirk making his mouth slither upwards.
Most people squirmed uncomfortably under that look his flatmate gave him, seeming to find it on equal comparison to being flayed alive for inspection, but John found that he simply didn't mind.
"Uh, very small rocks?" Lestrade said dead-pan and John couldn't help the giggle that pulsed out of him.
"It's alright." John pulls him in and kisses him deliberately on his eye, causing his closing lashes to clip a tear down his sharp cheek. "I don't mind."
"I shall give you a moment to collect yourselves." High Steward Charles said to William and John once they had finally cleared the landing a little ways behind him. Already quite use to having to climb these 17o steps as he did every day, he was hardly out of breath as he looked upon the two struggling men with some distaste. "I must make certain Prince Sherlock is ready."
This letter was almost identical to the one that had come before. It was on black paper, written in the same white cursive, but addressed to John this time:
Standing at the near center of the desolate solar, framed perfectly by a background of bright blue sky cut into a hundred small diamonds was the beautiful man that had haunted John's life since his knighting ceremony.
John did his best not to eavesdrop...but could hardly help it. The naked stone walls with not but a torch to stare at did little to keep his mind focused elsewhere. And though the wooden door was nearly shut, he could still make out the quiet murmurings from within.
"Any errands Prince Sherlock wishes to be done will be done by the servants as they are supposed to be. Any more items he requires will be fetched for him under my explicit direction. I will not lose that which I hold dear to any further incompetency.
"Twenty seven hours." Sherlock had replied, fiddling with the cuff of his long blue robe. His inky hair had been a dark starburst atop his gaunt face. His long body tilted against the doorframe, perfectly at ease. He had been wearing loose pajama bottoms and an inside-out tee shirt and John was always baffled as to how he could walk around barefoot so much. His piercing eyes had been trained fixedly on John, reading him like a book.
A lump formed in John's throat at the utter audacity, caught between being cross and intrigued. "A new list for what?"
Then he saw something that wasn't underclothes tucked away, ripe for plucking. "Oh. Hello. What's this?" He pulled a small brown moleskin book from its secreted place in the far back corner of the drawer. Unsnapping the elastic band and thumbing through the pages.
"Yes." Sherlock breathes. Putting a hand to himself and giving his cock one gentle stroke. With only that, his hips stutter. The arm that's holding him up nearly collapses beneath him and the moan escapes him that punches John straight in the groin.
If John hadn't known any better, he'd swear that Mycroft was jealous. "Why are you telling me any of this? Are you trying to put me off?"
"Victor Trevor." John repeated. "What happened with him?" Sherlock could tell from the millisecond too long it took for him to blink, that John was feeling the effects of the scotch, only exacerbated by his empty stomach. He was sitting more loosely with his ankles crossed, but his shoulder was still curled into him, as if to protect it. As he had for a long while now. He needed to solve that tonight. John's stubbornness was enough for the both of them and he needed him well for the case.
John was too consumed with feeling the shape of the word on his tongue to notice the structure of his broken sentence.
"We're going out tonight." Sherlock said instead. Pulling a large garment bag on a hanger from behind his back. It was impressive that he was able to hide such a thing behind his Belstaff. Almost. That coat was rather huge.
p.s. sorry there's no porn, the boys wanted to chat. ;} next chapter though. promise. just needed an update so you didn't think i'd abandoned it.
On autopilot, John pushed his hips forward. Those side-by-side fingers sliding slickly out of him all the way until he felt the uneven edge of fingernails at his anus' rim, while the pinching thumb stretched forward to remain touching him all the while, giving it balance. Simultaneously, on the opposite side of him, his cock pressed gloriously through that oiled ring of fingers until it met the soft thatch of his pubic hair.
Satisfied, though clearly not pleased, the High Steward knocked twice upon the door before fitting a large key into the heavy lock. The thick bolt followed soon after, screeching abominably as it was pulled back from its heavy bracing.
They were an inch apart now, building heat in each other's eyes. Sherlock's blazed with pale fire, while John's roiled dark like the sulfur vents at the bottom of the sea. They lived as two things purely elemental, opposite and true.
Live animals available for slaughter bellowed, bleated, and crowed furiously. Bundles of cut flowers and herbs twirled in the breeze. Pots steamed. Jars stank. Baskets overflowed. Discarded fruits of every available colour were smashed into rainbow jelly beneath their horses' hooves in the road as they moved on.
A thin rope was tacked across the windows, burdened with an array of dried herbs, desiccated bird feet, leathered frogs, and small burlap pouches of ingredients too small to be hung whole.
"You hated every minute of it." John replies, shaking his head slightly. In disbelief. In remorse. "You were punishing yourself."
Gently tugging, Sherlock came forward and let John wrap his arms around his ribs. John was a whole head shorter than Sherlock, standing this close, but it felt like they fit together perfectly this way.
William and Henry had kindly provided the men with another horse, so that brother Michael would not have to walk, but the monk had insisted, even going so far as to remove the simple sandals from his feet as he led his horse onward, "just until we reach the outskirts. It would do me well I think. We've a long road ahead and I would like to feel the mud beneath my feet."
The flush of exposure only seemed to add to the heat of John's arousal, and by proxy added to the suffocating heat of the bathroom. At last satisfied, Sherlock leant back and inspected John's pert bum like a patron admiring an oil painting. Even going to far as to curl a contemplative finger beneath his chin in consideration.
Instead of melting, though, John's heart crawled straight up and lodged firmly in his throat at the soft snick of the door opening and closing. At the strange swirl of outside air disturbing the fog above the curtain rod as two atmospheres collided. And at the waiting insult about to be liberally and judiciously sprinkled over his injury.
When William had held out his large hand, John had let the heavy coins drop, fearing what touching his hand may lead to.
John dreaded his own reaction if such a thing were to occur. What if it went REALLY bad? What would he do if he were to find himself cut bereft once again? Forced from his new home? Would he have to retreat back into a bedsit? Soldier on? Put himself out of his own-- but he supposed they'd cross that bridge if they came to it.
Anderson, who'd been shifting fitfully in the background with impatience, slithered up to their side. The look on his face when he finally noticed John and Sherlock stooping by his crime scene, was priceless. However for Donovan, their presence immediately made her decide to stay back up on the road, clearly still brooding over their last encounter and wanting nothing to do with them.
John had kissed tall men before, not ever having allowed his shorter stature to become a handicap, but with Sherlock  in particular, tipped over him and crowded so close, every bit the wild stallion of a man he could not predict, let alone control, John's knees chose this time to turn into traitorous water.
Early morning found John in an anxious disposition, despite having had the best night's sleep he had ever had in his life.
Then the notes were rising, rising, rising...and then just as suddenly in freefall. As if plummeting from the highest towers, the most unreachable peaks, and then climbing back out of the darkness when all could have been lost to ruin.
If he'd held out any doubts as to what Sherlock's true intentions were in coming here, or the fallacy of his own assumptions, they were vaporized when the man behind the counter exchanged their jackets for invisible stamps. Stamps which only exposed themselves when John lowered his hand to the bar's purple black light on a resigned whim and a glowing bulldog's head sneered plaintively back up at him. John sighed.
But no. What if they were not the sort to be bribed? What if they exposed him and he was punished like Sherlock had said?
John took a steady breath and ignored the twinge in his shoulder while the disgust ebbed. "So the murderer's stealing organs then? He's an organ thief."
Sherlock sighed, apparently John was missing the point entirely. "You've slept with men on occasions prior to this, it's not as if I am suggesting something you've never engaged in before."
Did Sherlock suffer from something? Erectile dysfunction maybe? If so, it was something they could deal with together. There were pills Sherlock could take. But John wouldn't pressure him. That was his choice to make. Of course.
John nearly jumped out of his seat, the laptop bouncing on his knees. "Thir-! Thirty thousand pounds! For a fish! Jesus Christ!"
He sat for a long while, his eyes wide, his mouth agape as he tried to make sense of what was being asked of him. "I don't understand." John said finally, licking his lips. "Wo--would you read it again please?"
"He has." John admitted, walking slowly. "I think. I mean, I know that he's definitely changed my life."
"But what is its purpose?" Sherlock had asked, eyeing the thing warily as it was offered to him on a satin pillow. He wondered at its shape and why it was so familiar. Being so naive back then.
John and Miles turned back to look at each other, John giving an apologetic shrug as he got up. "Long night." Was his defense. "I'd better be off."
John huffed a bright stab of laughter through his nose in both amazement and alarm and allowed more room between them. Sherlock didn't seem to be suffering the same result; all the lines of his suit lay perfectly once he gave his jacket a stiff tug and smoothing down and John couldn't help the swell of suddenly feeling a bit grotty.
John had to think about it. "Getting a window crew to work at two in the morning in freezing cold is more than a favor, Sherlock. What'd you do, exonerate someone else from a triple murder?" Then it struck him. "You called your brother, didn't you?"
John snorted at the presentation, finding it perfect. "No. I think I can manage to stay awake for a while longer. But I do have to use the loo before we start."
"Well of course it is." Sherlock leaned in, almost conspiratorially, still clasping the LED puck in thin fingers, "upon doing some research to find a proper summarization, I've found that what we have can be best described as a facultative symbiosis."
From his proximity, John could only watch Sherlock through the small strip of reflection he had in the mirror, trying to anticipate the next move from a man that was nothing more than a dark black blur. Leaving only the most minute slivers of pale flesh to flash forth as he moved to kiss John's jawline, then his pulse point, then his shoulder cap.
John thought about this, parsing it out in his own way. It took him a little bit. "So when you say it's not going to work, what you're really saying is...you can't focus on sex because your brain's on overdrive all the time?"
Sherlock hums and tilts his head, both of them poised like two people at the opposite ends of a chess board. Ones that seem to have been playing this game for a long while now. "How about we talk about you? How it's been YOU all along who's been behind these bodies turning up with missing organs."
Putting the ceremony immediately from his mind, John had worked to make himself well only for the benefit of being able to walk up to the Lord of the Manor and pay Harry and Clara's debts himself. And if he collapsed on the step and died of exhaustion being carried on the way back, he cared not.
Running out of peel, John glanced nonchalantly up and for a horrifying second, met eyes with one of the guards. He froze in place, the blade of his knife pressing into his thumb pad hard enough to draw blood.
"You'll probably not even notice I'm gone. Knowing how you get sometimes." She had said, putting far more impassivity into her voice than he knew she actually felt. It had taken him far too long to understand that this was her saying goodbye.
The warmth of the sitting room was extraordinary against the night, made all the warmer with the new double insulated, top of the line windows. He wasn't sure how he'd pulled it, but Sherlock had somehow convinced someone to start and maintain a fire as well until they got there. Reclaiming the flat as a suitable home and no longer a heavily furnished ice box.
And Bill's lips are splitting open now much wider than they should and the whispers that are pouring down from Bill's red mouth hurt just as much as the bullet had going in: 'Za ta sara meena kawom Za ta sara meena kawom Za ta sara meena kawom. I love you I love you I love you.' Before he is leaning back again.
John's brain is a cacophony of alarms and words /poisoned! I've been   p o i s o n e d   !/ . . .but the thoughts reach him slowly. Through treacle.
Sherlock pulls off abruptly and John snaps back into his body like Sherlock's just performed an exorcism. "Wha-?" He pants and Sherlock is braced up on all fours, looking down between his own legs.
"Doesn't he?" Mycroft proffered with an air of omnipotence. He tapped on the tinted partition that separated them from the driver with his umbrella tip and the car stopped. Mycroft opened the door to the frigid night, intending for John to walk back home from wherever they had pulled over, belaying small courtesies. "Good night Dr. Watson. Do give  Sherlock my warmest regards."
"Revenge?" John suggested. "You said that Mr. Jones had a relationship with the pusher. Maybe they were unfaithful?"
Sherlock turned quickly on the attack, vicious and practically slavering. "I've given you EVERYTHING of consequence! Before this you were content to chalk this up as suicide in total breech of the facts! Keeping your mouth shut and your eyes OPEN in the future might help them serve you a better purpose in doing your job!" Sherlock turned back, pulling long hands into leather gloves and letting the guts spill loose from the eviscerating words behind him, mumbling. "I don't consult to do your legwork as well."
"Not whom. But what." Sherlock said cryptically. And then it happened, there was a shapeless dark movement in the left tank on the middle rack, the only one with a pile of rocks. The camera was stationary, unable to pan, so it took a moment for the shape to make its way up to the top shelf. But when it silhouetted itself against the wall, its identity was unmistakable.
"I was!" Sherlock replied incredulously, leaning close. "HE was precisely who I was following! Don't you understand? Drug runners are the perfect informants when it comes to getting what I need. He's cased the room, he knows who's in attendance. He can get me information!" The flicker in John's face, whether a trick of the lights or something else, made Sherlock explain. "I /require/ the information John, not getting high. Do you honestly think I would sacrifice three years of sobriety simply to go off my head in a place like this? In the middle of a CASE? That I'd indulge in such proclivities right in front of you? How insulting! If I were to do anything of the sort it would be behind your back! But since you've moved in it's not even ever been a consideration!"
And to the East of the east lower river grew unchecked the Royal Forest of Baskerville, forbidden to all but those with special dispensation. Rumored to be full of ghosts and magic and all sorts of mysterious things.
The bird would stoop and immediately begin to feed upon his brother's corpse and as it fed it began to morph, fattening itself on the blood of the King, and soon High Steward Charles' blue eyes turned up from his meal and froze Sherlock in place with his look of absolute animal lust.
"I hear you're to be knighted." William had finally said into the silence and it had made John glance up at him, shuffling in place as his stomach swooped. It made sense that the Lord of the Manor would have received word that one of his serfs was no longer to be considered such.
