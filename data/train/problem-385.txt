“Ohhh, did it shut down? The economy has been so…”
John’s eyes remain closed for a few seconds longer and he wets his lips, pulling them between his teeth as if savouring the moment. When he does open them, they are a startling, storm blue and his pupils are blown wide.
Under the yellow tinged light of the hallway, John looks flushed and a bit dishevelled, but happy. He’s not exactly steady on his feet and there’s a couple of hairy moments on the stairs when Sherlock thinks that they might both take a tumble, but eventually he has them both in the sitting room. John is fighting with his jacket and almost cracks Sherlock in the jaw with his wild thrashing when he steps in to help.
“Oh for goodness sake!” Mme Hudson coos.
“Not a simple ask when the price of my inexperienced mistake could be so high.”
"Can't sleep?" John asks.
?” John asks as if he thinks such a thing isn’t even a part of Sherlock’s vocabulary.
It was three years now since they’d moved in together and almost two since they’d begun sharing a bed. Familiarity, far from breeding contempt, had mellowed them. Sherlock was still energy and arrogance and brilliance. John was still a thrill-seeker with an attitude problem. But somehow, now, they were this as well. Somehow they worked. And once they had come to trust in it, it had just improved with age. For the first time in his life, John could see himself settled, happy and growing old with someone – an anti-social, stunning, exceptional someone who was currently dressed like a debutante’s dirty fantasy and making John’s thighs tremble.
The heating has gone off and with the window open, the room has cooled fast. Under the thick blankets, it is warm and snug, the weight of them grounding and comforting. The curtains are not drawn and the fitful light of the moon brightens and fades with the shifting fog. It's close to silent outside, all noise trapped by the dead air and this adds to the strange feel of tonight. Sherlock abandons his mind palace and turns his head toward John. The light is insufficient to see him clearly, but he can make out the fact that his eyes are closed and his lips are slightly parted.
“You haven’t tried at all although you’ve been here for almost two months,” Sherlock rattles out. His eyes have gone cold and calculating and John feels a flicker of unease at the intensity of his gaze.
John glances up into Sherlock's direct gaze, but can't sustain eye contact. He said it himself - Sherlock rarely misses a trick and a misstep now could bring John's carefully created world down around his ears. He has lived for months like this, being in love with his best friend and flatmate, and persuading himself that it's okay, that they can live together, work together and be this close without it driving him nuts. But that plan relies on these things remaining unspoken - if Sherlock asks the right questions, if he notices John's avoidances and hesitations, there's no way he will leave well alone.
He’s under no illusion that he has needed his own share of forgiveness. Sherlock is not blind to his own faults. He gets lost in his head, he forgets that John is there, he leaves him at crime scenes, he misleads him and he manipulates him, belittles him and ignores him. He even left John to grieve, to believe that he was dead for over a year because it was the only way... no.
is one of the more acceptable ways that he’s been described.
John rests his chin on his palm. “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star? You mean you haven’t deleted nursery rhymes?”
He breathes in through his nose, squares his shoulders and steps out of the car, which melts off into the night, turning the snowflakes red and orange long after the shape of the car itself has disappeared.
"Is that something one can learn? I wasn’t aware that was how this works," Sherlock says coolly.
The way he twitches against his hand, has John taking pity on Sherlock. He pushes him further over onto his back and carefully positions himself between Sherlock’s legs, easing his cock back into the perfect spot next to his. He thinks about pulling down their pyjamas, but one look at Sherlock’s flushed cheeks and the teeth leaving indents in his bottom lip, he decides against it. He craves pressure himself and when he begins to drag his clothed cock against Sherlock’s it is dangerously good. He rolls his hips, feeling the drag and glide of their hot skin through thin cotton – the silk throb of their lengths and the velvet heat as their balls move together.
These thoughts, once considered, now throw up a number of other situations where Sherlock’s actions could have been modified to allow for the possibility of a relationship developing. How very fitting, Sherlock cannot help but think. He has created this life, this friendship and camaraderie and partnership that he cherishes above all others, but in doing so has also consigned himself to something that could have been more had he not been so skittish,  arrogant or distracted. A prison of his own making. If he’d only paid attention right from the start, and seen John for the gift that he truly was… If he’d only looked at the potential of John, the bravery, the loyalty, the kindness and seen in him the perfect foil to his own shortcomings. How might he have replied in a way that would have left room for interpretation, for hope? If he’d only realised why he’d been so instantly fascinated, so
"Yes, I'm fine thanks. Happy anniversary, by the way. Gorgeous afternoon for it."
"Come up here a bit," John murmurs.
“Mr Holmes…”
What if Sherlock were finding a way, however indirectly, to gauge John's reaction to this hidden side of him? What if Sherlock wanted to lead John down a certain way of thinking, to reveal something about himself and to observe from his reaction whether that might be something that he approved of or would be interested in? What if Sherlock wanted John to see him in a different light with new potential?
She raised a sceptical eyebrow at him and John felt the beginning of a flush creep around the back of his collar. This was why he ignored this kind of comment, he remembered belatedly. He never knew whether he was giving himself away and drawing more attention to his own confusing attraction to Sherlock. He should have stopped there but apparently old habits died hard and even if he had no intention of taking it further, it was always nice to be noticed.
"No you don't," Sherlock smiles wryly, and John reluctantly takes his leave.
His injuries are mostly healed and his strength and stamina are improving day by day. John has been invaluable, as always, during the course of his recovery driven, Sherlock suspects, by guilt that it was his wife who put him in the hospital in the first place. His guilt is misplaced of course. Sherlock had been too distracted by Mrs Watson to follow his perplexing observations through to their logical conclusion but even the most cynical would not have suspected that John would have allied himself with a mercenary assassin in his absence.
This chapter is for Mr Berty who has gracefully ceded his rights to the only working computer in the house, so I can bang these edits out!
If there seems to be some tension between the two men, John puts it down to some kind of residual familial rivalry. Sherlock and Crispian are of similar age and both are the products of this unique family's upbringing style. Both brilliant in their fields, both whip smart, witty and dry, John rarely recalls having spent a more entertaining evening at a dinner party. Crispian had asked John for some of his own stories and had been sensitive enough not to press on the subjects that John had been reluctant to pick up. Strangely this had made John more open than he had been in a long time. In some ways, Crispian reminds John of Sherlock - and not just because of the striking good looks and trademark curls - and if John has relaxed more quickly than he normally would in the presence of a new acquaintance, he puts it down to that similarity.
"For fuck's sake! Why?" John yells, plot utterly lost now. “If you want to know something about me, just bloody ask nicely! I’ll tell you. It’s as simple as that.”
"No, not really," Crispian replies, quieter than he has been this weekend.
He’s been told it’s unlikely that he’ll regain those memories. John will have to keep them for him.
Finally Sherlock finds some purchase and gets his belly over the branch, his legs dangling in the air quite comically. The relief of having his weight removed feels marvellous, and John straightens and turns to watch. Sherlock looks none too stable so John instinctively steps in and puts up his hands to Sherlock's bum to anchor him. It takes a second for John to realise what he's done and by then it's too late to do or say anything except to pretend that's exactly what he meant to do and it isn't immensely awkward but, and at the same time, completely wonderful.
A pleased but surprised look steals across John’s face. He is not normally given to being concerned about impressing people, or having them like him, and Sherlock is intrigued to find it in this case. John is polite and friendly in social situations but he doesn’t suffer fools gladly and makes no bones about letting people know when they have pissed him off. Of course when he used to date, he would have a vested interest in the women he had his sights on enjoying his company as it would dictate his chances of intercourse later in the relationship, but to his knowledge John has nothing to gain from making a good impression on Mummy and Dad.
“No philly-what-not gems. You’re not listening! Bill said they only thing worse than bein’… rejected by y’r crush, is never having found the balls to tell them in the firs’ place.”
Sherlock has the key in his pocket and he goes to pull it out now, aware that he is having to brush up against John or risk banging his elbows on the ancient timbers that support the porch. To be fair, he isn't exactly averse to being intimately acquainted with John and of the two options, he knows that he prefers the first one by quite some margin. He murmurs an apology as he leans against John's shoulder to get his hand into the pocket of his jeans which is more easily said than done when he has a coat and a jumper on. Finally, he has the key in his hand and he grasps it, pulling it out to unlock the door.
He reaches for Sherlock’s hand, squeezes it and falls asleep between one breath and the next.
Seb                        I had to stop sucking him for a moment to put more lube onto his hole, giving me the opportunity to slide a second finger in as far as the first and I loved the pain of him pulling my hair when I took most of him in my mouth when I hit his prostate again.
He hadn't vocalised any objections so I don't know what you can deduce from that. GL
Rosie                           "Dude. That's so cool. It would suck to be his kid if you wanted to lie or something. Does he have kids?" I was hit by a thought. "Do you have kids??" Duh he has me. "I mean like more kids..."
Mycroft                     "Th-Thank you," I say quietly, accepting the chocolate. "Like I said... it's been a while. Touching a living being is much more difficult than touching other things. I have to get through emotions first"
My brother is the very opposite of harmless -SH
Mycroft                     "I had not intended for him to stop entirely. He seems so... uncomfortable. I'm preventing him from doing something that comes naturally to him. I did not want him to change for my benefit."
Greg                             I awkwardly slip his shirt off his shoulders at least and I left it when I wasn't able to slip it off completely because of the sofa. I then move to his trousers, fumbling with his belt and my sofa wasn't the biggest of sofas so I was trying to shift back to make room for myself.
John                            “Oh. Well, maybe he’s just trying not to do it at all, around you. Make you react on your own.” The kettle boils and I pour hot water into four mugs, and then add tea bags to let them steep.
Greg                             "Then what happened?" I asked, folding my arms across my chest.
John                            “Um... alright.” I start taking out the tea things from the cupboards.
Sherlock                   My eyes widen as the screens come to life with Moriarty's mocking face, the speakers blaring with his voice in unison, "Did you miss me?'
Greg                             My whole body stiffens when I see Moriarty sitting on a chair with the crown jewels on the postcard, my hand slowly turning it to see it said
Greg                            "Not very. I'll just need a warm shower to loosen me up and then I'll be good for the day." I said softly, running my hands over his clothed chest and then down his thighs where he was wearing a matching pair of pj's.
John                            “Oh. Yes. Fuck.” His hand and mouth work me faster and faster. He gives one more hard suck and my orgasm hits and I’m spilling hotly into his mouth. I groan out a string of curses and his name before relaxing limply back onto the bed.
I have eyes everywhere. I'll know if you lied or died. Try not to do either, Dearie.
John                             “What? Of course she’s your mother. Or do you mean the pretending bit?”
Greg                      I found a vending machine so I could at least eat a packet of crisps and a chocolate bar, my eyes just shutting when Mycroft appeared again. I rubbed my eyes and saw something had unnerved him or put him on edge. "What is it?" I asked as I stood up
Moriarty
John                            I notice their hands clasped and the corner of my mouth turns up as I move to perch next to Sherlock on the arm of his chair. “Well what’s the next step. How can we help?”
Mycroft                     "Escaped?" I look at Greg in horror. "Was anyone injured? Are there any leads?"
Greg                             "Just keep following me." I growled as I stood him up straighter, marching him in through the office where I see Sally and Anderson perk up. I explain to custody officers that I'll be booking Sherlock in and within half an hour, I got him booked into a cell with minimal fuss. Along with the pill to be tested at Bart’s.
Greg                            "What happens when you become overwhelmed? Is it like a fatigue kind of thing?" I asked and wondered how the hell he dealt with relationships with a power like that.
Sherlock                   "Weren't you listening to my odious brother?" My fingers slip into his smaller ones, "I know he's so easy to ignore but he was talking about our... your future just now."
Greg                            I wanted to whisper the words to him, that I loved him and I was saying them in my head as he continued thrusting into me. I was clinging to him with our cries and whimpers mixing together along with sound of skin on skin. I had to eventually move my head away to catch any sort of air and to watch his reactions.
Greg                            "Focus." I laugh as we walk in the door and find John sitting in the living room watching the TV. I spotted Rosie on the floor doing a drawing of some sort, both of them looking up as we walked in and our blogger didn't seem any less grouchy than before. He almost looked disgusted at our laughing.
Sharon Price             "I just feel so bad now." My hand tries to grasp one of his for comfort, "We had drifted apart a little these last few years. I... I got divorced and I think she missed having my husband around. Often I think she treated you as her son-in-law to make up for it." I manage a shaky smile with my words, standing and watching them try and work on the building to secure it
Mycroft                       I just sit quietly, my gloved hands steepled under my chin, as Greg looks over the arrest report.
Irene                             "Fuck off!" I bite, pulling my coat closed hastily.
Greg                             I had been trying not to watch the clock and was genuinely surprised when he returned. I had made a few calls to the latest missing woman's friends, checking that her relationship was stable but she wasn't out with any of them. She'd cut herself off from them to join a 'new club' as one put it. I chewed on my lip and tried to smile weakly as he came in.
Moriarty                   "Currently, no. In the very near future, oh yes. Dead dead dead. D-E-A-D. Dead!" I smile as the camera takes my picture to compare to previous retinal scans and looking for mood markers.
John                            Nodding, I take the glass of water and Paracetamol. “Thank you, Love.” I say to Sherlock has he curls up on the couch next to me. “Where did Greg go?”
Mycroft
Greg                            "Yeah. means you can bend me over the desk or I can do it to you… how does that sound?" I whispered between us kissing and he seemed to stop to look at me for a moment, using his free hand to hunt around in my coat pockets as I was pinned up against the wall.
Anthea
Greg                             When he started moving his hips a little harder and faster, that's when I locked my legs around his waist to encourage him. Our heartbeats as one was still ringing in my ears and I had to pull away from his mouth to get some air in. The lust from him was dripping onto me, or it felt like it, our bodies one.
Mrs. Lipton             I look up from the pastry I woring on to see Sherlock walk in to the kitchen only to step out again. "Good morning deary. I hope it will turn out to be a fantastic day too." I wink at him when he returns with two other men and one of the guards I sent to fetch him. "Thank you, Charlie."
Sherlock                   My fingers trace down his back down, sliding under the dark mauve cardigan, his shirt seeming to have vanished from under it, "It just isn't amusing or fulfilling to try and predict what you would do in bed John. I enjoy the surprise, the shock."
Dr Capaldi                 "We've managed to stabilize the DI. He was suffering from Septicemia. It should be resolved in a few days. He can recover in the hospital."
Mycroft                     "Don't..." I say, my voice barely more than a whisper as I pull away. I cannot let sentiment get in the way... not now. "How soon can we start the number trace?"
Mycroft                     "Even wounded, I doubt he would have flung himself into the Thames." I look at him carefully. "Would you like my assistance? I might be able to give you a bit more information..."
Rosie                           "Just the Zoo. Oh, and Diagon Alley."
Oliver                         "I have a day off on 25th. I like having my day offs at Tuesdays. I was at home mostly. Went out shopping in the afternoon." I know I started blabbing a bit, but who wasn't when
Sherlock               "Moran." I jump off the bed, fists curling by my sides, "Where is he?"
Rosie                          I think about what Mr. Croft said and figure he must be like the President’s maid. Now it kinda makes sense.  Once my attention is removed from my new phone I realized how ugly I must look to all the pretty people in their pretty clothes. "Ok. Bye!" I run up the stairs and dress in the clothes I wore yesterday.
Mycroft                       "It seems that our... connection, for lack of a better term, is exceedingly rare." I look at him quietly. "It has only been known to occur when one party's power has a strong emotional component, much like mine."
Mycroft                     I pull back and look into his eyes. "You... you need your rest." I say, my voice a hoarse whisper, smoothing my hand over his chest.
Greg                             "She'll be fine about it, I think, with my flat in pieces. I was having dinner with her anyway when I told her I was going to go check on your mum and grab a few more things from my flat." I explained, trying not to worry about the grip she had on me.
Jamie                           "No. You need to leave. Who. Are. You?!" I pick up the phone to call Security.
Mycroft
John                            “Where are you? Why are these dreams so weird lately... you would call them dull. It’s frustrating.”
John                             “He’s resting right now. Maybe when he gets up. Do you wanna go down stairs for a snack or something?”
Mycroft                     "I suppose not." I give him a kiss on the cheek. The helicopter lands, and we head in to check on John and Sherlock. My brother is situated in a corner bed, John by his side.
Sherlock                   My hands lift, searching blindly, "It may be a sacrifice I have to make. Moriarty must have a control room with contract with the outside world. If I can get there I can send a message to you." My voice softens, "Moriarty is determined to come and get Rosie. That cannot be allowed to happen. Especially as he will likely go through Lestrade and my brother to do so, as well as gaining revenge for Eurus and Moran. I must get the message out before that happens."
Mycroft                     "The experience is a bit draining, I admit, but I appear to have recovered. Why do you ask?"
Mycroft                     I chuckle. "It's easy to fall into a routine, isn’t it?" I glanced at the clock on the wall. "Normally at this time, I am curled up on the sofa in my study, reading a tawdry romance novel." I blush. "This is a refreshing change of pace.”
Greg                            "Absolutely, shall we meet back here again at 9am?" My coat got thrown around my shoulders with my hands going into the sleeves, it starting to rain but it didn't look like it was going to affect me getting home much.
John                            “I miss you too. I wish you were here. This bed is cold.” My dream is just white mist, just sounds.
Mycroft                       I roll my eyes.
Greg                             "You're not late for anything, and you left it on the side there but I plugged it in when you were using the bathroom last night." I waved to the bedside table and sat up to run a hand through my hair where it took literally 10 minutes for me to get ready.
John                            Taking the sugar bowl from Sherlock, I scowl at him. “That is too much sugar. And I’m not old!”
Mycroft                       I sit up for a moment, drinking in the view of Greg lying naked before me, and I lightly brush my hand down his chest, closing my eyes as the sensations flow through me. I lean in and kiss him again, rougher, my tongue flicking against his lips and delving into his mouth.
Sally                            "No, no, of course not, she's been a little angel. Much like you in terms of crime scenes, bodies." I stand up and smile genuinely, seeing a more sincere side to him so I was going to walk them back down to the entrance.
Sherlock                   "Indeed." The guards step to one side, promoting us all to do the same, before treading carefully where they do, "This is why it's not a good idea to let flatfooted soldiers go stomping around before we have a chance to disarm at least some of the systems."
Mycroft                       "Give him some time to cool off. I'm sure he and Sherlock will discuss things before it's time to leave Baker Street. They will need to talk to Rosie about her part in the plan, after all."
Sherlock               A brief shadow passes over my face, stroking back John's hair from his forehead, "My John will want to do the right thing. He always does."
Eurus                         "We could rule." My arms are moving now, struggling, until there's a sickening crunch, my thumb dislocating, one hand wrenched from the cuffs to fly at Mycroft with a wild look in my eyes, "I can show you better ways."
Greg                            "Definitely. We can just make it a little visit." I nodded and knew it wasn't going to be the whole ‘introducing your partner to your parents’ but we both felt something was amiss. More than usual.
Mycroft                     His words encourage me, and I hum with pleasure as I take him deeper into my mouth.
Greg                             "Right, okay, don't let anybody else now, just book her in for something minor and I can question her in the morning. Anything, anything minor, just another public disturbance because I don't know who's on what side at the moment." I waved my free hand around as I wrote down details like where they arrested her, whether anybody could have seen etc.
Greg                             I watched the scene for what seemed like minutes but was only a couple of seconds until I could then hear Mycroft’s breathing on top of me. I could now get my breath back, but I couldn't feel my heart beating for a few seconds, seeing my partners eyes looking down at me where he obviously had registered the panic. I didn't even realise I'd been that out of it.
Greg                            "Oh. What sort of emotions did you get?" I said quietly as I huddled into him some more with my arms folded. The thick blanket was comfortable, knowing he was trying to avoid touching me with his bare hands.
Mycroft                 "Are you listening to me, Sherlock?" I spoke a little louder.
S&R Commander    "Let's go!" I check the monitor to find where Sherlock has placed the beacon, and the team goes to work, carefully moving through the rubble. One of the team members yells out when they move some bricks and uncover an arm... a female arm.
, warm and exciting and addictive. If he were given to fancy, he might even recognise that buried in the folds of his shirt collar the scent of it lingers where months of co-habiting have rendered the difference between their scents negligible – the flat smells like
"Yes, but not in a good while," Crispian says through gritted teeth.
“The same, Sherlock. The same.”
He has to leave.
"And do you think he knows that you are interested in him?"
But John doesn’t call him ‘love.’
“You’ve been playing for me for months,” John counters, weaving his fingers through Sherlock’s while his quicksilver eyes follow the movements. He doesn’t deny it but he doesn’t admit it either. He’s sitting very still as if waiting for something to break the spell, as if he can’t quite trust that this is happening.
He closes the door behind them, adding to the feelings of distance from the main event. John sits on the bed curled forward, his forearms on his thighs, his hands loosely grasped between his knees.
He hummed his satisfaction as John released him and offered his lips up for Sherlock to kiss.
He’s too tired to keep lying to himself – Sherlock Holmes has fascinated him since day one. At first it was a kind of wonder that such a person should exist, all brilliance and cheekbones and social maladjustment, but it was soon clear to John that, gay or not, he cared more deeply for Sherlock than he had ever experienced for another person before. The attraction had been there from the start, but rather than some abstract, intangible recognition of it, as he had experienced with other men on occasion, this one had the time and space to grow until John woke up one morning and understood that this was the defining relationship of his life so far – not infatuation, not desire or attraction or fondness but some amalgam of all of them plus admiration, friendship and a feeling of permanence.
“Yeah, well, you were all brilliance and deductions and I was off my game. You still turned me down though.”
He can feel the hairs on the back of his neck prickle, but now he's begun this train of thought, he can feel it hurtling him towards a conclusion that is so outlandish as to be ridiculous and he has to decide how much of it is real, and how much of it is his own want, bleeding through.
) the door to their flat behind him. There was little point. Sherlock probably knew exactly when he would arrive to within a 45 second tolerance.
It’s Mme Hudson, who always claims to be surprised that he is up but never alters the time of day that she visits on her sporadic appearances. She pops a Tarte Tatin on his table and puts water on for coffee and John, who has come to understand that Mme Hudson is the sweetest, kindest miniature tyrant he has ever encountered, sits down at the table and lets her fuss.
“Sorry, what?”
He finds a plate and a small bowl from the counter and secures the candles he’s brought to them with wax dripped from their melted bases. They don’t give off a great deal of light, but John can see most of the kitchen now, and he can see Sherlock, bedraggled and shivering, sitting among the drips from his sodden clothes, on his kitchen floor.
"You know, you could have just said," John says eventually.
“You’re not planning on staying here,” Sherlock states, then straightens. “Ahhh, you’re not planning on staying anywhere, are you?” he breathes, eyes shining with understanding.
Electricity? There’s no electricity out here - this town has been bombarded for days and there’s nothing left of it, nothing for the electricity to run. Maybe he’s hit his head.
“I was rather hoping it was what you’d do to me,” Sherlock replied and smiled when John abandoned the buttons on his own shirt in favour of dragging it over his head and letting it drop, unheeded to the floor.
John is ragingly hard and it's difficult to think of anything but how beautiful his Sherlock looks like this and how much he wants to slide home and make him come. Every now and again, however, the sounds coming through the window intrude and remind him that they are due at a party that is starting below their bathroom window right now, and that Sherlock can be very, very loud when he's wound up.
“All right then.”
Bracing him with one arm around his chest, Sherlock takes hold of John and hums against his neck as he strokes lightly. John shivers, although the air is warm, and his skin rises into pimples at the glut of sensation - wet finacé, warm skin and Sherlock's clever fingers touching him. John knows it won't take much - he feels like he's been hard for hours, but to have Sherlock's greedy gaze, watching his every twitch and shudder in the mirror as he works his cock gives an extra level of arousal. It seems unguarded and voyeuristic, even though there are only two of them there and John is surprised by how much the feeling of exposure it is affecting him.
door, crosses the room in three strides and throws it open.
“You seem to know him quite well,” John says in what he hopes is a nonchalant way but Mme Hudson gives him a look that tells him she knows what he’s up to.
-  and -
When Mycroft takes the melody, Sherlock looks up to where his father is sitting next to his mother. He has on a dinner suit and bow tie that Sherlock thinks are probably older than Mycroft is. The jacket, especially, is so outdated now that it has come back into fashion again with its burgundy, velvet shawl lapel. The fact that he can still get into it after all these years is something he puts down to dancing with their mother. Sherlock watches as Father reaches out a hand to Mummy, who takes it in her own. They both have a suspiciously misty quality to their smiles and shining eyes. So they do remember. He and Mycroft knew they couldn't compete with the other musicians on the guest list, but their adequate rendition of something with such a personal twist seems to have hit the mark, judging by his father's soft smile.
“It’s okay. You’ll be alright,” John tells him quietly. “These things take time.”
John reports that Crispian is comfortable and resting now. His manner is more tentative than ever, his eyes cast down and his smile forced. He keeps sending hopeful looks in Sherlock's direction, but Sherlock determinedly ignores them. He hasn't been able to discern John's thoughts up to now, and trying to do so when he is already this turned about while in the company of his parents will not bring the breakthrough he's been seeking.  He wonders how people do this - how people survive the uncertainty and the guessing of romantic exploits. It's exhausting. He felt certain that he'd made a connection and had opened a pathway towards them being clear with each other. John's hesitation had been unexpected and confusing and had cast down any confidence that Sherlock might have felt at the progress he thought he had been making.
“John…”
His mind skitters over visions of hypodermic needles and filthy mattresses, hidden knives and stab wounds, collision trauma from skidding cars and soft tissue damage, but he drags his attention back each time to the pace of his footfalls, the thrum of his heart and the unending mantra that speeds his feet, “Just hold on, Sherlock. Just hold on, Sherlock. Just hold on...”
“What did he want this time?”
This turns out to be a mixed blessing. Firstly because John is taking all of Sherlock's weight through his arms and shoulders, and though the man looks willow thin sometimes, he's still six feet of muscle and bone, and he weighs a bloody ton in John's estimation. Secondly because now John has a face full of Sherlock's thighs, clad in the jeans no less, he can't truly appreciate the fact because the first thing means that his shoulders are screaming bloody murder. And now the idiot is wriggling, trying to get some of his body over the lowest hanging branch. So John finds himself beginning to appreciate after all, because Sherlock is warm, even through the denim and he can feel the shape of Sherlock's quadriceps against his cheek and ear, and he can smell that distinctive scent that is purely Sherlock, pressed against his nose. He needs to concentrate on supporting Sherlock and on them not getting themselves some broken bones - it's not easy though.
"It's not quite the same when we're this far apart, but... Do you want to see?" Sherlock asks. He’s definitely hesitant.
“John? John!” Sherlock doesn’t want to shake him in case it precipitates nausea. “You really should try to drink some water before you…” He reaches out and squeezes John’s shoulder.
“On the contrary, although you can hear quite a lot from other parts of the building, this stairwell is very rarely used. Under here, no one can see us unless they are specifically searching for us.”
And then he notices silver blue eyes, watching him intently from the sofa.
“Ah, um…okay,” he agrees hollowly. He knew this was a possibility, but the sudden, pervasive ache that forces the air from his lungs and freezes the blood from his heart outwards is immediate and merciless.
His hand slid around John’s waist and un-tucked his shirt, spreading his gloved fingers against the skin of his back to pull him in tighter.
John was visited by a sudden moment of insight; of Sherlock, bored and alone, teasing himself with the cold kiss of his dog tags and the scent of his old uniform, pleasuring himself
What does Mycroft think Sherlock wants? Deserves? His opinion of his brother, although well meant, is lacking in key elements. If Sherlock wanted more from their partnership, what would that look like? He doesn’t need anyone or anything as far as John can tell, although he seems to enjoy being told how brilliant he is, as if that’s news to anyone. He’s proven himself to be less than capable as Sherlock’s bodyguard, mainly because the idiot can run rings around him mentally and send him on dead-end errands with a nod of his head when he wants to be left to risk his own life. They’re already the closest of friends, Mycroft had no hand in that, it happened without his meddling –
Sherlock instantly turns his head to watch him for a few moments,  eyes narrowing.
The back of Sherlock’s neck prickles as he imagines that the whole of London seems to have gone silent to listen.
He sits still while Sherlock consolidates his hold on him, threading the fabric of John’s t-shirt between his fists. John responds with a warm palm sweeping up and down his upper arm. Sherlock's forehead rests firmly on his shoulder and the solidness of his friend is a comfort and a torment. Sherlock rolls his head against John and his nose crushes against the baggy collar of John’s sleep shirt and the skin of his neck. A sensory recollection jerks him, his body and mind suddenly flooded with the immediacy of the man’s presence, just like in his mind palace. Sherlock knows that none of what he remembers is real, but that’s not how those fabricated memories feel. He recalls how John’s laugh, rushing air against his mouth had felt so warm, how John’s weight on his chest had been so grounding and right, how John’s jaw beneath his lips and the pattern of his stubble had felt like home. Being with John had made him feel comfortable in his skin; cherished. The memories are joyful and diamond-bright. He inhales the scent of John and remembers nothing short of
“Most of them,” Sherlock says, looking at his collection . “There are some that require very specific conditions that I can’t replicate here. Those I have to buy in from other apiarists.”
Sherlock tips his head and puts his forehead against John’s skull to enhance the sensation when Sherlock nods, just once.
“I don’t know what you’re wittering on about now,” Sherlock says, clearing his throat and shocked by how rough his voice is, scratchy from disuse. Was it really only a day since he walked away from John? Surely he has spoken since then?
"Actually, there are a few other things that have changed," John says, with a quick, false smile and leaning forward to pick up his cup.
A gust of wind scrapes the last of the brown and curling leaves across the path with a dry rasp. The bulbs bounce madly on their wires and reluctantly flicker into life as the sky reaches a predetermined level of twilight. Sherlock holds out his hand and John’s eyes follow, staring at the familiar gesture as if he has never encountered it before.
“Good Morning,” John calls, surprising himself.
John's jaw is clenched as he lifts his eyes and faces him. “Why do you do this? Or… or let me do this to you?"
“Listen, Sherlock…”
"I'm fine," Sherlock confirms and wonders what John would have suggested had he been quick enough to claim to be cold. Probably not any of the things that Sherlock is thinking of.
John ponders and clearly decides to quit while he is ahead. “Done, but the toast has an egg on it. And there will be napping.”
“Are you okay?” John demands. There are too many things happening at once. Security is approaching from the direction John came. The nurses’ station crew are finally using the phone –
"It's a bit of a crappy date for a birthday," he concedes.
"Just give him a minute. Since when are you so keen to do chores?" John laughs. He seems happy and relaxed and Sherlock doesn't know if that's the Christmas spirit making him so cheerful or something else; possibly the inordinate amount of time he took in the bathroom that morning which had inevitably lead to Sherlock having to forgo washing his hair in favour of...other things that needed to be taken care of. Sadly, before he can come to a conclusion, Crispian comes out in a sweater, jeans and boots with a knitted hat covering his curls.
“Yes,” John says unhesitatingly.
“Night cap?” he asks.
a second difference between this and reality, after all — the intruders.Their voices come and go; sometimes perfectly familiar and others just a teasing whisper, barely audible, let alone recognisable. Perhaps they are designed to distract him from his theorising. Perhaps he has been being played all along. If this John isn’t real, does that make the voices more or less likely to be a figment of his imagination? If this is psychosis, if his fractured mind is speaking to itself, should he be as aware of these discrepancies as he seems to be?
S&R Commander    Another member of the team calls from the other side of the room - another body has been found, but badly crushed.
Mycroft                       I moan into his shoulder as I thrust into him slowly, running my hand down his arm to his cock. "Let me..." I whisper, pushing his hand out of the way and putting my own hand in its place, stroking him in time with my thrusts.
impressive escape. ~ JM
Sherlock                   "Talented." I turn back to Moriarty, lowering my voice, "Not what I expected."
John                             “I’m sure you have some connections there that can help with that.” I pick up my empty. “Do you boys want some tea while I’m at it?” I brush past them into the kitchen.
Greg                             I flick my eyes between him and the road and swear out loud, shaking my head. I wanted to stop the car to throttle him, but we needed to get back. "You’re fucking kidding me, Mycroft. Come on." I sighed angrily where I realised he'd read the infant. It just didn't sit right with me on many notes.
Mycroft                       "Rough?" I ask quietly. My next thrust is a little harder, a little deeper. "Like that? Or like this?" I bit down firmly on his muscular shoulder, making him flinch a bit.
Rosie                           "You get to see dead bodies?" I lean in close to her. "Are they scary? Do they stink? Are they all... icky and stuff?"
Mycroft                     "As the demands of my position changed, I became aware of my sister's other skills, and was convinced it would be to everyone's benefit to use them for Queen and Country. Of course, money is meaningless at Sherrinford, so Eurus was granted other rewards for her assistance." I took a deep breath. "One of those was the opportunity to speak to Moriarty."
Mycroft                     I look up at him, as he fumbled over his words.
Mycroft                       "I don't know... he was in the room with you, so I thought you would know. Though his voice sounded a bit familiar..."
John                            “He’s resting. But I think he’ll be ok. Maybe a dextrose drip when we get to the hospital to help him along.”
Mycroft                     "Were you able to connect the vehicle with someone?"
Sherlock               I go to stand up, my voice trembling, "No...no, it was meant to be simple. Simple."
John                             “Hey. I got half Hawaiian half pepperoni. Hope that’s ok.” I bite my lip as we decend to the kitchen together.
Greg                            I had to moan out loud as he pushed into me, my hips pushing back against him until our hips were together. I took a few shuddery breaths and felt something different to when we'd had sex before. It felt a lot more like there was less control on Mycroft's front and in the air, his thrusts then becoming harder and quicker than before.
Mycroft                       "And I still care about you. I'm just used to working alone... being alone." I look down at his hand over mind and smooth my thumb along his wrist. "I will make more of an effort."
Greg                            "Seems like Jim has more of an obsession with Sherlock from what we've seen. You're just gonna be pushed aside like nothing. You're gonna be the little pet that they just play with and then throw away." I stood back a little with the way the bed was moving but I was grinning more and more.
Mycroft                     I worked two lubed fingers into him and shifted myself up, licked up his shaft and taking him into my mouth. As my tongue swirled over the hot flesh, my fingers found his prostate, and he thrust up into my mouth with a cry.
Sherlock                   I shift from foot to foot in the airport lounge, waiting to board our flight out to America. I'm impatient and skittish, glaring at anyone who passes us
Greg                             "If you'd just said then I would have given you space or supported you. And I'll still support you because beggars belief, I have feelings for you too." I smiled a little where he was stammering so much over his words and it was a little cute.
Sherlock                     My eyes narrow a little, still gazing out of the window though, "You ask as many obvious questions as Rose Marie."
Sherlock                     My eyes roll, "I wasn't dealing with drugs. I told you." I notice the cabbie is paying a little too much attention to us. "I can protect myself. I don't need you. I don't need my brother. I don't need anyone."
Mycroft                     "I.... don't know."
Sherlock               "I've found him." I bark from right besides Lestrade's shoulder, panting a little, my coat covered in brick dust and what looks like blood, "There's a pocket in the rubble. They're in there. All three."
John                             Folding the paper and standing, I open my side table drawer, taking the post card out. I hand it over to Mycroft. “Sherlock’s resting.”
Seb                        I shouted myself as I came, digging my hands into his back and my hips gave way more than anything when I'd stopped shaking. I felt his hot breath on my neck and entangled our legs together to just enjoy the serenity of the moment.
Greg                            I chuckle with him and my brother had the more desired power of moving objects with his mind, "I was nearly 16 when mine came into play... late bloomer." I admitted, and it did seem odd at the time.
Greg                             I had been quite relaxed in the back of one of Mycroft's cars until we got to the road where my flat was and it was totally cordoned off with police/ambulance/fire service everywhere. I jumped out of the car, running down the road where I could see smoke coming from Mrs. Price's flat and it looked like quite a big fire.
Greg                            "Right. Well, I would normally agree with the doctors here but I don’t think it’s worth taking up the bed for another day. I can look out for him quite easily and bring him back if anything worsens." I meet the doctor’s eyes, watching him huff and walk off to find the right form.
Sherlock                     I nod, moving to try and help Lestrade to his feet, allowing him to lean heavily on me
Mary                     "A bomb?" My head flies around, staring at Seb in horror, "No, you can't just leave us here to die. Please." John lets his head fall back onto the wall with a thunk, swearing under his breath.
Sherlock                   I try and push past his hand, snapping, "I need to be there." I lower my voice to a hissing whisper, "John will still be in danger once they realise he survived."
Mycroft                       I walk into Greg's department, ignoring the perplexed stare of the other officers as I breeze past their desks and knock lightly on Greg's closed office door, opening it when I hear him respond. I quietly close the door behind me and set a bag from the sandwich shop Greg had mentioned in front of him. "No wine, unfortunately. Coffee will have to suffice." I smile.
Greg                             "We need to stay on top of this... to keep one step ahead and with Sherlock getting the files from my office, we need to decide whether even Sally or Anderson would be good for interrogation." I protested lightly as I was lead to the guest room and I had wanted him to sleep with me but didn’t want to push anything.
He’d expected no less, but had only recognised it after the fact, their naked bodies still tangled together so trustingly. Of course John had been intending to get up and wash the evidence of their last night together away, put on his suit and marry Mary. Anticipating it and living it had turned out to be quite different experiences though. Sherlock had left the reception as soon as the dancing had started knowing that he had metaphorical walls to rebuild and patch, and knowing that the sooner he began learning how to live without John, the sooner he would stop aching and craving the way he did.
“We loved. Inst–– we start it in the beginning.
They took it in turns to work themselves closer to completion, Sherlock rocking himself off and back onto John’s cock, his thighs strong and his knees hooked over John’s legs as he rode him. Then he would lose rhythm, chasing the sensation of a perfect hit on his prostate. John would take over then, trying to oblige with his hands on Sherlock’s spread cheeks, lifting him while he rolled his hips up into the tight sweetness of him, trying to wring those tiny cries out of him that made John feel like a giant.
"Done," Mycroft nods, and Sherlock leans in all the way and kisses John, right there, in front of everyone.
“I’m not sure this is a good idea,” Sherlock says hesitantly. His head bowed, John can’t see his eyes, but in the twitch of his fingers and the set of his shoulders John sees uncertainty.
It’s everything.
God, he’s
She kisses his cheek once and slips away to greet more of her guests.
“He said you lacked the social nuances that would tell you…”
"Why? Is it a problem?"
"John?"
What if Sherlock Holmes wanted to let John know that he was interested. In sex. In sex with him specifically.
Sherlock stands in the doorway and observes before he commits himself to entering their sitting room. He’s left this space until the end of this little exploration deliberately, uncertain about what he’d find - or what he'd hoped to find.
“Sherlock, please,” he interrupts almost immediately.
They stand much too close together, neither of them stepping back. John is still holding on to Sherlock, to stop him from stumbling, and Sherlock is hanging on as if his feet are still not quite on the ground. Both breathing hard, Sherlock's head is tipped down to look at John whose head is tipped up to meet his gaze, all of  which leaves their mouths only centimetres apart. So close that Sherlock would only need to sway and their lips would touch.
John seems to anticipate the negative reaction this statement produces and puts his hand on Sherlock’s arm to calm him.
“It’s not…not...good,” Sherlock mutters feebly, his words slurred and difficult to find. They don’t even feel like his words in his mouth. He hates this lack of vocabulary to explain the baseless but very present feelings of dread that assail him each time he approaches this doorway.
He took advantage of Sherlock’s arousal, turning them around to effectively swap places before sinking down into his seat. John didn’t much care for the feel of leather against his bare skin, but it was warm from Sherlock’s body already.
“Oh! Oh, no!” Sherlock clarifies, gesturing between them. “
John seems to come back from somewhere far away.
"John," Sherlock says with every evidence of relief.
Sherlock takes himself off to the bathroom and John marks his place in the book with the till receipt from the birthday whiskey and puts it aside. He knows that Sherlock always sleeps with his window open, so he kneels up to open theirs then shuffles himself under the covers and waits. It doesn't take long for Sherlock to reappear, also in pyjama bottoms and t-shirt, his long, pale feet bare on the wooden floor.
So what is stopping him from just saying it?
Sherlock sniffs. “Dogs, John. And also bees.”
“Oh shit!” John breathes.
“I’ve known Sherlock for a long time, dear.”
“If you’d shown any interest at all… but you didn’t.” John holds up an admonishing finger as Sherlock reaches again for his phone. “You didn’t! That’s how I know that this is purely a symptom of your neurological recovery and that is also why I’m not going to let you do this because in another month you will regret it and it will have messed up things between us. Wait and see, Sherlock! And if you’re wondering, I am never going to mention this situation again. Ever. Okay?”
“What are your thoughts on chestnuts, Mr Watson?” Sherlock asks, running his long fingers lightly over the jars.
"I wanted to ask you, you know. Lots of times. But I didn't think that it was the kind of thing you subscribed to. Might appreciate. You've never been one for overdone sentiment."
John crossed the distance in two steps, reaching urgent hands to Sherlock’s hips to spin him back towards the window. He pinned Sherlock against the desk with his hip and fumbled with his own fly, drawing out his neglected cock.
“I know,” John assures him. “Seriously, Sherlock, thank you for last night. I don’t remember a bloody thing about it, but I hope that I didn’t do or say anything that would make you feel…”
Why can’t he just say it? It’s a word he can manage, just a remark devoid of overt emotional significance.
>>><<<
He’s so very tired, and he’s about to close his eyes for a moment when John’s voice floats in again.
“Not unless you need to,” John replies, at which Sherlock shakes his head slightly, watching for a cue as to what he should do now.
. There's always something," Sherlock sighs, his lips twitching when John's eyes flick to his with recognition. He'd got Harry's sex wrong too, right back at the beginning.
"I bloody will," he hisses.
Sherlock looks away. The pain on John's face is real - he's not a libertine or a philanderer, although it would be easier to think of him that way. He's just a man being asked impossible questions without good answers. Sherlock must accept some of the blame here - John is right; he forgives him every time. Every harsh word, every correction of their relationship status, every disposable girlfriend he has hidden behind, Sherlock has forgiven, up to and including the wife John danced with at his wedding after Sherlock himself had taught him how.
John sits for a few seconds, digesting that, then shakes his head sadly. “”Er, no, sorry, I’m not following you on… that… er…”
Mycroft                       I smile darkly as he fights against my grip, and nip his lower lip. Slowly, I start to move, pulling almost all the way out before sliding back in hard enough to make him gasp. My lips graze over his collarbone, making him arch his back and whimper.
Eurus                         My eyes are dark now, sulky and pouty, "Greg was supposed to come with me. I would have killed you and Watson. That's how I wanted it to go, not Jim." A hint of pride returns, "Jim has no idea about Sherlock's pet. I kept that to myself."
Mycroft                     My hand slides down his side and grabs his arse, pulling him against me as my teeth graze over his neck. "I suggest we stay as quiet as possible... wouldn't want to attract attention..." I purr in his ear.
Greg                             "Don’t take all the glory, boys." I raised an eyebrow over to them as it felt like me and Mycroft were being pushed out, it taking a lot of effort on our parts and I'd almost been killed by Sebastian in my own car.
Greg                            My words were incomprehensible, but his words made his hand around my cock feel warm, just being what I needed and when he started licking behind my ear, I couldn’t hold it back anymore. I know I shouted with the way he was trying to shush me as I came, and it mainly went over his hand with a little on his desk.
It's Christmas Day - so what goodies did Sherlock and John find under the tree?
"... to bring it back."
John’s body stiffens further, straining to listen to Sherlock’s words.
"He's an engaging man." Crispian concedes, turns to face him and crosses his arms. He watches him levelly, clearly losing patience with Sherlock's attitude. "And he's good company."
“Wait here,” he tells Sherlock and walks to the bathroom. He pees, washes his hands and face, brushes his teeth and faces himself in the mirror. Tired. Pale. In need of a shave and a hot shower but those things can wait. However far this goes, John has a reasonable certainty that they don’t have to have it all today. He’s all but asked the man to stay with him forever.
John says that he loves him. That’s good.
"Oh, no. Just a quiet night in, you know?"
they make my bum look fantastic."
“I have been marvelling at myself since the moment we met – your presence has changed so many of my perceptions about things. I’ve never really cared what people think of me beyond my intellectual achievements, and yet I found myself wanting to impress you, to make you laugh. It was… unnerving. For the first time in my adult life I wanted another person to like me for no other reason than that I liked them. I don’t normally succumb to such sentiment, but over and over again you were the exception. Of course by the time I had recognised the pattern and realised the implications of that you had become indispensible to me. So when Moriarty, who had picked up on it quicker than I had myself, damn him, used you as leverage, he knew he had a winning hand. And even then I didn’t keep you safe. I couldn’t stop those snipers, I couldn’t watch you die, so I chose the only way I could to keep you safe. As it turns out, I was in error. Even from beyond the grave, Moriarty managed to get access to you.”
John traced a finger up the middle of him, feeling heat and fresh sweat and was that … had he…?
The conversation tails off and yet John feels compelled to speak. If he doesn't mention Sherlock's performance now, he'll lose his nerve all together.
“Sherlock,” John says with infinite gentleness and regret. In an instant, the realisation comes that John must think this is just another consequence of the injury. That it’s not real.
There’s a quiet snick of a plastic cap being opened and a soft obscene squelch as Sherlock coats his cock. John can see it in his mind’s eye – Sherlock’s eyes falling shut as he closes his fist around himself, the way he bites his bottom lip as he strokes from root to tip, the way he holds his shaft as he guides his cockhead between John’s arse cheeks and the way he nudges his thigh between John’s to open him up a bit, lifting John’s right knee so he can sink…
He checks the bedroom door over his shoulder , then opens the bottom drawer and puts a hand down the back, running his fingers along folded bed linen. This is the obvious place to put anything that you might not want others to see - every teenager in the UK knows that.
John hopes that Sherlock will say something, make some kind of gesture that he understands what he's saying, but he doesn't, just listens intently. John swallows and tries to force into words things that he'd rather not think about in relation to himself.
"You've, uh... You'd better sort that out. Your jumper has made it all static," John explains, withdrawing his hand and gesturing to the mirror.
"Laura's telephone number is still beside my bed because I forgot it was there. I'm not going to call her. It's... it's a bit of a habit, self-defence maybe..." John shrugs again. "I had no intention of calling her. I just... I wonder sometimes if I... It's... I'm not proud of it, but knowing that I'm still able to engage with someone... in that way..."
"Nathan," he says and his lips turn up without his express permission. "
“Well, that’s where I have miscalculated.” Sherlock turns toward the wardrobe and pulls open the heavy wooden door. He starts to move hangers along the old, brass rail with a soft rumble and squeak.
John braces his back against the bathroom door, takes himself in hand and his reluctance is instantly replaced by a rush of relief. His own touch rarely feels as welcome as it does this morning. He is insanely hard already, so he moves his tight grip up to where he’s most sensitive and already leaking precome, knowing that a little dedicated friction here, at the crown, will bring him off in under a minute. He strokes quickly, tries to breathe through his nose to avoid making any involuntary sounds. His balls are already pulling up and he’s just slick enough that the drag of his fist is the right side of too rough.
“All right, dear,” she agrees. “Better make it this evening. The taxi is coming early in the morning. I’ll get some nibbles in – maybe make some mince pies; he likes those.”
He shouldn’t ask. God, he really has no right to know these things, but the thought of a sexually active Sherlock makes something primitive and possessive flare in John’s chest out of nowhere.
Sherlock shrugs. "It was hardly up to the measure of the other performers this evening, but it amused Father, so I suppose it was a success by those standards."
“So…” John begins, but is unsurprised when Mycroft simply talks over the top of him.
Sherlock waits for him, will always wait for him, his own smile ready to return John’s from the day they met.
Thunder rumbles around the house continuously, sometimes low and distant but sometimes bright and loud and close by. It’s a real corker of a storm and John thinks about his poor garden and how much tidying up there will be for him to do tomorrow.
“Right. Tha’s what I said. So…”
“You can have that one. I have plenty of the thyme,” Sherlock says over the top of John’s apology.
Sherlock is tentative at first, as if unsure of his welcome but John hums and matches his rhythm until the dam breaks and Sherlock buries his face in John’s neck and takes his pleasure. He murmurs into the safety of John’s skin, incomprehensible words in a broken, breathless voice, then stills, shudders and pulses between them.
With a shuddering breath, John did. Sherlock was pink cheeked, his chest heaving and his eyes warm but focussed. His bottom lip caught between his teeth and John found he was overwhelmed all over again. Sherlock was so beautiful like this, all layers and pretences stripped back. And Sherlock must have seen something in John’s gaze too as he stiffened, his eyes blowing wide.
No, like armour.
Sherlock gives him a strange look, and John wonders if his bathroom interlude has been rumbled, but the shy smile that follows distracts him from dwelling too deeply on that.
To his surprise, John doesn't withdraw his hand. They have turned towards each other to avert the fall of the jar and their hands are overlapping on the warm glass. John has that same look in his eye as he had earlier - in fact several times earlier today. It is direct and uncompromising and Sherlock braces himself for the words that are to come. Wistful and determined are the emotions that Sherlock is picking up from John's body language and they cannot be a good combination.
Each evening when he goes to bed, John decides that tomorrow will be the day that he sits down and really begins to think about how the rest of his life should look - that’s a big part of the reason he came. He appears to have come out of the war with some life left to live, so he ought to do something about that. He hasn’t quite managed to put his gun further away at night than his bedside drawers, but that’s more of a security measure than it has been in a while. He’s not an old man yet despite the cane and the attitude. Perhaps he could be useful and productive - he just needs to find the right direction to channel his energies to make that happen.  And yet John finds that each day is swallowed up in the minutiae of living it, and evening comes around again ready for him to decide that tomorrow will be different.
“Oh, you beauty,” John breathed, and urgently tugged the tight jeans down Sherlock’s legs to pool at his ankles where Sherlock, wriggled and kicked until he had a foot free, giving John enough room to palm the cheek of his arse with one hand and guide the tip of his own dick to the glistening pucker of Sherlock’s hole with the other.
By around half past eight, most of the guests are gone or going, and Greg, Molly and Mrs Hudson are all wondering where their promised lift back to London with Mycroft has disappeared to. Indeed, neither of the Holmes brothers are to be found, even with all of them looking for them.
“Just relax.”
He recalls glances they shared at the wedding reception. He recalls the look in John’s eyes when Sherlock deduced Mary’s pregnancy – like he had received an unexpected gift that he had now to thank someone for without having time to consider whether it was something he wanted or not. He can think of dozens of instances in the last few months where John has given every indication of being happy – they always have been rather good at making compromises for each other. But he cannot think of a single instance where he has mentioned missing his wife, or any discussion of their future plans. He’s been perfectly content to let Baker Street welcome him back as if he’d never been away.
There is some suspicious throat clearing and shuffling of feet as a collective, silent sigh goes through the group. The flames from the torches flicker in the imperceptible breeze and John is caught in Sherlock's eyes, neither of them wanting to be the first to break this moment. A smile plays around Sherlock's mouth - soft and natural. John's gaze falls to Sherlock's lips and as if compelled to do so, he leans in slightly. Sherlock bends towards him too but pauses to cast a quick glance at his brother.
had done rather than something from John’s past. But now the memory of that night and the importance John seems to still hang upon it makes Sherlock suddenly nauseous. If Sherlock had responded differently, if he had been more ambiguous, less dismissive then perhaps… Perhaps that one conversation had been the turning point that had sent his and John’s story off in this direction rather than the direction the projected John from his mind had followed. Maybe he himself had scuppered any chance of John’s affection or love without even realising what he was ruining as he merely reacted instead of considering the consequences of his words. John had been interesting, different, and his sudden and direct questions had made Sherlock feel exposed and under a scrutiny he was more used to employing than attracting.
‘All right,” John says, trying not to feel trepidation at the opportunity he has handed his friend. It might just as well be his heart, beating defenceless in his palms.
"You do not understand. This is not a simple thing to achieve. If it were I would have done it already,” Sherlock objects, surprised into honesty.
Sherlock scooted down further into his seat and groaned. “Let me take these off so you can…”
As the cases have picked up, John's sex life has trailed off. He doesn't miss it per se, and he's perfectly capable of taking care of his urges by himself most of the time. To be honest, Sherlock has stepped into the role of his most significant other, their work and home lives overlapping and adjusting around each other's quite pleasingly, but without a physical aspect to their partnership. John is frustrated to admit to himself that this is the best relationship he's ever been in - and the idiot in question probably has no idea that they are even in a relationship!
go back for them, only Mycroft had a tiny microphone built into them so he could monitor the operation.”
what was about to happen, he hadn’t believed it, hadn’t for a second imagined that Sherlock would leave him alone with no more than a few cryptic words delivered in a breaking voice. Just one more lie to add to all the others John had let himself believe or had made up for himself to justify his trust in the man.
John smiles against his lips and snakes an arm around his waist pulling him closer when he hesitates, forcing him to take a step nearer. John persists, butting his lips against Sherlock’s in repeated, tiny pecks until with a huff of amusement, he is chuckling into John’s mouth.
The voice on the other end chuckled softly. "Well you won't very well need your mother any longer when you've got a boyfriend, now will you?"
"I knew you were shy and all that," John continues.
But Sherlock will keep this secret. If John wants to snog him again or… or whatever else he'd like to do, Sherlock will let him. Sherlock is fine with that. And Sherlock will never tell another soul for as long as he lives.
Pausing on an order he was just about to call out, Greg tosses John a confused glance. "Uh- Myc's got a younger brother."
"Hi-" Sherlock breathes, then stops his question as John's fingers are on his flies.
Sherlock was on him before the door even closed.
John laughs again. "My favorite face," he teases, running a thumb over Sherlock's rounded lips.
is what I want from you? Right now?"
"Alright, that's it for today," Sherlock said with a flick of his hand as Sally sat back in her chair with an indignant huff. "Off you go."
Sherlock shakes his head. "No, but I figured there wouldn't be one today. I think I figured out the pattern though."
"Listen very closely, John," he said in an impossibly deeper, serious voice. John's cock twitched in his trousers and he held his breath.
His roommate's smirk drops right off his face, his jaw following it down. "What?"
And then it is so utterly
Sherlock furrows his brow.
"Love."
Sherlock was just calming down, blinking rapidly and breathing finally slowing and he froze as he recognized what was taking place in front of him. John trailed his now wet fingers down Sherlock's chin and to his chest, needing to keep touching him as he touched himself.
he's being absurd.
John groans, hands unclenching and sliding up into Sherlock's unruly curls, threading his fingers into what could only be described as silk and holds Sherlock's head in place while he explores his mouth. He runs his tongue along the line of Sherlock's lips, nudging them apart and delving inside, the heat of Sherlock's delicate breath swooping hot and heavy into John's own mouth. He does his best not to grin as Sherlock's tongue reaches tentatively toward his and taps it gently, timidly, like he isn't sure what he's doing.
made a mess?!" he squeals indignantly. "
Sherlock's weight settled against John as he collapsed, effectively sealing John's seed between them. John's clean hand came to the back of Sherlock's head, gently petting silky, damp curls. "Sherlock," he sighed contentedly as his lover laid a kiss against his temple.
It doesn't shoot everywhere like Sherlock had sort of assumed it would, but instead leaks out in large quantities, filling the curve of his tongue and dripping down onto his lips. He can't see John's face but he hopes very much that it's frozen in pure ecstasy. Sherlock reminds himself to be better prepared next time and position himself to be able to see his boyfriend's face when he comes.
They get his cousin, turning in an Oscar winning performance, into bed after he manages to struggle back into his pyjama bottoms on his own. John is reluctant to leave him under the circumstances; clearly Crispian has over-egged his role. Sherlock tries not to sound too impatient, and John is finally mollified with the knowledge that Crispian has his mobile beside his bed and can call them if he needs them.
"Sherlock!" John murmurs, leaning forward, trying to get himself as close to the image as he can.
“Is there a point to this?” John asks tightly. There are several ways the next few minutes could go, and none of them are appealing.
As apologies go, he’s had worse ones.
“Oh, that’s good then.”
“You need better hiding places?” Sherlock guessed.
“Ah, but you are my beauty,” John told Sherlock as he helped to lower him gently into his lap, splitting himself wide on John’s cock with sighs and quiet groans. “Look at you, just look at how perfectly we fit together. That’s beauty, no question of it.”
“Sorry, what?” John asked, dragging his eyes back from the door to their flat.
Sherlock shakes his head and shrugs eloquently. "Help yourself."
Mme Hudson finishes her coffee and gets up from the table. “He doesn’t trust easily, John, and there’s a reason for that. But sometimes the solution to a problem is just as much a hardship as the problem itself.”
Crispian has the grace to look slightly abashed. "Well, she saw me responding to a message and she asked. What was I supposed to say?"
“Because I was here first. Last warning, Sherlock - step back or I will not be held responsible for the consequences.”
Sherlock stays by the door, chewing his lip.
Sherlock’s face is open; compassionate without pity. “What happened?’ he asks quietly.
Home.
His parents have visited several times and seem to have made firm friends with John. Perhaps they hope John is a secret boyfriend who Sherlock has failed to mention and each visit they find him here beside Sherlock’s bed their expressions glow with pleasure thinking their second son has finally found love. The irony is suffocating.
Pausing, Sherlock takes a moment to remind himself of the self-imposed rules he is here by today. He recalls that he has already circumnavigated several of his own diktats just to be standing here at all, and it's not as if he doesn't know what the potential price of today's transgressions are - he's lived them already.
He pokes about with his blog for a while longer, then makes himself some tea and watches whatever movie is on the TV. It's only after half an hour that he realises that he has seen it before and he hated it the first time too. It's getting dark already, so John pulls the curtains and turns on the lights. He thinks about lighting a fire, but it doesn't seem worth it when it's just for him. He cooks himself some pasta with some tomato sauce from a jar, finds his reading glasses and picks up the most recent BMJ on the pile beside his chair, catching up on the latest research in the world of medicine until it's a reasonable time for him to call it a night and go to bed.
Does he always use...
Sherlock offers a ghost of a smile, still fighting the nausea. He looks into his cup, avoiding John's gaze again.
Anyone who has met Sherlock will tell you that he is a difficult man, bossy and scathing and they wouldn't be wrong (although John would counter that with the words
The frustration is making his head ache and his heart lurch in his chest. He looks up when John falls silent and is dismayed to see him moving to the door to the bathroom, letting himself out into the hallway. Sherlock scrambles after him, brandishing the phone at him when he catches him up in the kitchen.
I, William Sherlock Scott Holmes, take you, John Hamish Watson, to be my wedded husband.”
But as the months had gone on, the cold spells had become less frequent, John had grown enough to be able to ignore all but the most blatant accusations. And Sherlock had begun to hope. John's moods had started to matter to him. Although less frequent, John's denials had begun to hurt. More and more he’d found himself thinking of how things might impact John before he’d considered what the cost to himself might be. In short, and contrary to any personal faith in the institution, Sherlock had fallen in love.
Eventually John’s bladder wins the battle of wills and he has to go to the bathroom, muttering curses all the way. He jumps in the shower when he’s relieved himself, pleased to see that the electricity is back on this morning. The gentle ache in his thighs and shoulders is much more welcome with a pleasurable memory to associate them with.
And then Sherlock reminds himself that these questions are all pointless, as the John Watson dancing in their kitchen isn’t actually real but a facsimile, a projection. He doesn’t exist in this form in the world outside his mind palace.
Of course. Sherlock blinks and reminds himself to guard his expressions around John. Their friendship (miraculously) endures, but the warm familiarity they once shared isn’t for him anymore. John is married, and tomorrow they will travel to Dorset where he will return to domestic bliss with his clever, pretty, pregnant wife and he will share his grins and his sarcasm and his quirks with her.
They smirk at each other for a moment, until that becomes uncomfortable and they both look away. It's a lot to take in. They are neither of them strangers to an adrenaline-fuelled lifestyle, they are used to twists and turns, and fielding whatever it is that their lives have decided to throw at them on that particular day. John has stared down CIA agents with pistols, been drugged on three occasions (that he knows about) and been given an ASBO, while Sherlock has gone hand to hand with trained killers, haunts the streets of the seedier areas of the city at night and antagonises people whose only wish is to hurt him. And that's all in just the last few months. So why is it this that has them both hesitant and unsettled? Serial killers are not a problem, but admitting that they have feelings for each other is beyond them?
Greg                            "What would make it easier? Tell me." I said quietly when I heard the frustrated groan and I rubbed his thighs gently again, so he wouldn't get worked up over it. It was a learning curve for both of us.
Mycroft                     I sit across from him at the table. "All right then. Give me your hand.”
Greg                             I tried to keep glancing down at him to make sure that he wasn't passing out from the emotions flooding him, my hand down on his shoulder rather than in his hair with my eyes shutting again in time with a strangled moan coming from my throat. He was getting more confident with his hand on my hip and raising it up to brush my nipple again, twisting it in his fingers.
Greg                             "Any more risk then I'm already putting myself through? It would have made fuck all difference Mycroft and if you'd just talked to me, explained what you were doing, I would have understood." I ranted as I put the milk away and I didn't want him hurt but that wasn't the point.
Sherlock                     There's a bitterness in my voice, spitting out, "Sally is still watching us."
Jamie                           Thom comes back and holds out a tray with all sorts of colors on it. "We have ones that will wake you up, more that will put you to sleep. Some to lose weight. Some to lose time. Some to help you think better," I pick up a small cream-coloured coated capsule, "and some to help you not think at all."
Sally                            Finally he's getting it. "Yeah. Just wants to meet you. Probably gonna fan boy and ask for an autograph or something." I check for signs he's telling the truth. All I see is a broken and used up addict. "I'll tell him I talked to you and you wanna meet him. He'll contact you in a few days. Probably by text." I hand Sherlock the pack of cigarettes and lighter. "Here, take them. No one will be surprised you snuck smokes into the jail cell." I turn to walk away but need to say one last thing. "Sherlock, I've known for years your No Sentiment bull was an act. I get why you did it. No one wants a broken heart. Probably the same reason I stay with that dick Anderson. Even though he's got a gorgeously big cock, he's still a grade A twit. And I'd miss him." My own stupid heart makes me tear up. "I'd miss him and it would break my foolish heart. Don't be foolish like me. Listen to what my friend offers you and think about Rosie. Is she really better off with your brother? Or should you be her Dad? Just listen to him."
Sherlock                   The breath gusts out again on his neck as a huff, "The plan worked well. Maybe a little too well. I didn't intend to lose contact, to be drugged." The irritation in my voice grows, "I wish I could get a message to you."
"Oh, not much," he says airily. "Deathly dull. I've just come back from Austria, recording some Handel with the Vienna Philharmonic. The Christmas Markets were rather lovely in the snow - have you ever been? And then in a week I'm off to Boston for a few days to teach a masterclass. No rest for the wicked as they say." He aims this last phrase at John, who smiles and nods, apparently completely taken in by this false show of humility.
When the flakes are falling too dizzyingly fast for him to keep his eyes open any longer, John looks down to his friend's face and realises, instantly, that he was wrong about the snow. As rare and magical and beautiful as it is, it is not what he has been waiting for. Instead it's this; Sherlock with his head tipped back and his eyes shut while the snow has settled on his shoulders, his scarf and in his hair, making it look like confetti at a wedding. And what it does is make John certain that the unnerving chance he must take, if he is to win this man's love, is worth it because for everything else that he is - brilliant, loyal, arrogant, sulky, rude, driven - he is also this; human, capable of wonder and simple happiness, and just possibly able to return the endless love that John has for him.
