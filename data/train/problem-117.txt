He had unsuccessfully tried to encourage his department to purchase Sherlock after his violent owner had been given a twelve-year slave keeping ban, but by the time Greg had been ready to buy the man himself, he'd already been sold elsewhere. He hadn't seen or heard from Sherlock for over four years before now. He'd tried asking at InS, but they hadn't been willing to give him any information other than that the item he was looking for was no longer on sale. All he had got out of the receptionist after a lot of pestering and asking if he could at least be notified if Sherlock would be sold again had been a dry laughter: "I can't tell you were it's been sold, but one thing's for sure..! It's not coming back."
, he'd been about to say. Stupid. He didn't need to worry about something like that anymore. He had a slave now. So instead he said: "It'd be...nice. Yeah."
"Explain. And you better have a bloody good explanation for bursting in here, bothering my landlady, waking me up and
Thank you for reading! I'm not sure if I can ever really say "I hope the chapter was enjoyable" when it comes to this fic, but I hope it made you feel something. I would be really interested in knowing how you felt. So if you liked it and you have a moment, it would make me really happy to read your thoughts. :)
"I've played the violin since I was four. My mistress kept me practising. She was a violin tutor. I was supposed to become a tutor as well."
Mycroft froze and looked at him with confusion. "I have no power whatsoever to buy you. I have never offered that."
He knew he should not have. It would take him long to get there. He knew he had no right to, he knew his owners would be furious, but he
He'd rushed to the door, heart leaping, full of hope. He hardly even recognised the young man standing by the road. He'd lost so much weight that despite Sherlock growing himself, it seemed as if Mycroft had got taller as well. Maybe he had. Sherlock had rushed across the small yard, only to come to a sudden halt as he registered the collar around Mycroft's neck. His heart sank, shattering all the giddy happiness and hope. Mycroft wasn't there to free him.
"Decided to go by the name my first owner gave me," Holmes completed firmly. Clearly not a topic he wanted to approach. "That, or whatever else my owner chooses. And Mycroft didn't choose to go by that name. His owner did."
. I want the best for you. As a slave. You are my responsibility. So just be good and do your part, and you don't have to worry about anything. Worrying and making decisions are
But the not-Anthea turned around without another word, beckoning Mycroft to follow her back into the car.
"I think it's likelier he'd only arrived. You didn't show up much later," Sherlock continued, eyes scanning the crowd behind the police line. The shooter was unlikely to linger, but one never knew... He stopped at a familiar face.
Lestrade turned his attention back to the slave. "Well, you've probably read the news, it's been all over for a while now. Three identical suicides, but no connection between the victims. And now a fourth."
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. He really, really did not want to talk about this. Not with Mycroft, not with anyone. "I know."
"Like you said, I dragged you out to a crime scene against your will. Two people were killed tonight. Bit different from euthanising a slave. Most people wouldn't approve." He looked down at his master's face, examining it for a slightest twitch of a muscle, but John's expression remained the same.
“Well, if you don’t have any questions...” Ms Bruce prompted. Last chance to get the slave switched.
Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed. Please let me know of your thoughts if you can spare a moment. :)
After Holmes had refused to wear proper coveralls and the Detective Inspector had shrugged it off, Lestrade explained the victim was a woman in her late thirties, called Jennifer Wilson according to her credit cards. The body had been discovered by local kids.
He practically threw himself into the car and told the driver for now to go to the general direction the other car had gone. It took him a moment to figure out how to save the text with the cab number before he could start the agonisingly slow task of logging in and purchasing the full GPS package. The phone's internet was slow and sluggish.
"I've had some practice," Sherlock slurred, but Jeff Hope could hardly make the meaning. His tongue still wouldn't work properly. He reached for the door, but it didn't open. Probably wouldn't, even if he could get a firm grip.
They stared at each other for several seconds until Sherlock had to break the eye contact. His eyes simply wouldn't stay focused. Or at least he wanted to tell himself that was the reason. He fumbled to find the chair again and very nearly tripped on the floor before managing to sit back down. When his eyes found the cabbie again, the look on his face had changed.
"No, it's alright. You can stay," John assured. "I'm sure you've got some catching up to do. I've nothing against it."
"Oh god, you would've," John groaned. "You defy your owners to prove a point. You risk your health and safety to feel clever."
Holmes obeyed. He stood straight, arms folded over his chest, legs slightly spread to give him a steady stance. Numerous scars covering his skin from shoulders to thighs spoke heavily of the slave's past and nature. But the long, narrow scars weren't caused by abuse. They were well healed, done professionally. Only InS could have inflicted them.
The man smiled. "Well, like you said, you found us the murderer. I guess you've earned it. If only you'd got us the shooter, too."
"A slave," he replied simply, clenching his fists to prevent John from seeing how they were shaking. John was furious at him, but he was also angry at his master. Angry and humiliated.
Sherlock was still a slave astray, but he was too tired, too panicked and too nauseous to care. He'd find a way to get back to John's flat later. It was safer for a slave to move in daylight anyway. He'd be stopped far less likely. So surely he could rest for a minute or two. He was tired, so tired...
“That…” John started when he felt like being able to make a complete, coherent sentence again, “was amazing.”
Sherlock swallowed hard and tried if pressing his eyelids did any good for the headache. It didn't. "How did you recognise me?"
"I'm sorry," the slave called Hunny said. "Mistress ordered me to. She fears you might try to escape."
It took an annoying eighteen minutes for the laptop to turn on, the browser to start, the web page to load and for him to come up with a new password for his jhwatson account the InS site insisted him to do before letting him get any further. Then there was wall of text in the form of Terms and Conditions he scrolled by quickly without reading.
"Your fan, yeah. Told me about you, told me about the website. I've been to it, you know. Many times. Brilliant stuff, loved it! Your bruise analysis is incredibly thorough. And quite a bit more interesting than tobacco ashes. And the case files!
"Nothing. Mycroft just wants to stick his nose into my life and kiss your arse with pleasantries," Holmes grumbled, lying on the bed again.
The grimace of shame on Mycroft's face was the worst thing he'd ever seen, but it was gone instantly and his brother turned to face the caller. "Yes, master?"
”So, a war hero?” Ms Bruce finally inquired pleasantly as the printer on the side table started printing.
. Like you said it'd be. I didn't think– I didn't realise the danger I put you in. I'm sorry, Holmes. Jesus, I'm sorry. I
“Please read the file carefully. And I can’t stress enough how important it is that you read the slave rights and laws that concern you as a private slave owner. You can always give a call to our service number in case something comes up.”
The man himself however panicked, shouted for help again and slapped hard Sherlock's left cheek to keep him awake. "God dammit, Sherlock, you're not dying in my arms. Come on, stay with me!"
Her gaze swept over him, assessing him. She didn't stop smiling her gentle smile. "I know this is all new to you. I know you've just become a slave."
Angelo patted the slave's cheek and ruffled his hair. "Don't your owners feed you at all? You're a sack of bones and your mouth goes on endlessly because it has nothing to chew. Anything on the menu, free for you and your master."
The ambulance had just arrived. As Jeff Hope was far beyond their help, the staff seemed annoyed that the only person they were needed for was in fact not a person at all. They talked to him, checked him for injuries and concluded he wasn't injected with anything lethal and it would be for the best just to wait it to wear off. There was nothing uncommon about a slave and a panic attack, and people tended to treat them as mild inconveniences. Sherlock would rather not have even mentioned it, but the police slave did. As expected, he was only told to get himself together. They wrapped him up with a blanket, offered him hot water with sugar and then left him waiting.
The fingers in his hair gripped harder, tugged so violently that it hurt. He squeezed his eyes shut against the flashing lights, but he couldn't shut the music out. The bass radiated from the floor, vibrating through his body. His hands shook as he fumbled with the flies in the dark. The man's knee had been going up and down with the rhythm until Sherlock began. Now his feet were firmly against the floor as he worked his hips to push himself deeper in Sherlock's throat. It was disgusting –so, so utterly disgusting, yet he settled for his task eagerly. Desperately. He needed it
The dog was taken away from him. They were pulled apart. Poor Redbeard struggled and fought against the leash, whining miserably. Somehow he knew.
Holmes had dinner at ready when he finally did find the energy, if not will, to return. The slave still did not set a place for himself before John explicitly told him to do so. At least he looked better rested than in the morning.
"Why do you want to know about my slave?" John questioned. The woman had told him to sleep over it. He had, but he'd understood it was him who was expected to make contact. Surely they wouldn't try bothering him again this soon? Had she or her enigmatic employer changed their mind? John certainly hadn't changed his mind, he was not selling his slave and he hadn't contacted the mysterious M, whoever that was.
"Listen, I– I know I said I wouldn't, but... The thing is, with the move and all the recent new expenses," John went on, circling around the subject.
"I found you the murderer, what does it matter?" he argued irritably. "I told you where it is. John will be happy to get rid of it."
"Well," his brother spoke. "It's certainly an improvement to your previous lodgings. Could use a bit tiding up, but if this is how your owner prefers it..."
On the other side of London, a man sat in front of a laptop. A video feed of Doctor John Hamish Watson collecting his items and exiting the car played on its screen.
Sherlock looked at the blonde woman crouching at his level. She smiled at him. Behind her stood another woman, but Sherlock could tell from her posture she was a slave. The man who bought him hadn't spoken much and Sherlock had been too scared and distressed to speak to him. He'd done his best not to cry as they drove away from the auction building of The Institute of Slavery, but he was so, so scared and so utterly alone. The collar choked him and it had been cold in the car.
"It's because yours doesn't have a photo," Holmes said. "Look at all the others. They all have photos."
"I was not", Holmes denied offendedly. "They sold me because my master's roof and insulation company went bankrupt."
John glanced out of the window. It was still windy and the hanging clouds indicated it might start raining later. Although it been so cold it might even snow. Who knew? Another shrug. "Fine I guess."
"I've told you that little hobby of yours would eventually get you in trouble. You'd be better off focusing on your master."
What interested him far more was Moriarty. Who or what was it? Why had they taken such interest towards him? Fan of Sherlock Holmes based purely on the website he could understand, but Moriarty knew he was a slave. How long had Moriarty known of him? Was it a coincidence that Mycroft and Moriarty had found out about him being in London at the same time? He didn't believe in coincidences.
"No, and I don't want to. Stop this car and let me out. This isn't negotiable, the slave's not for sale!"
told him to have meal ready by the time he'd get home. By skipping the interview he was more than two hours early.
Daddy died before he was cut out of the car. When the midnight came, the horizon was lit by fireworks.
"You know my name", he stated, stepping away from the slave despite himself. The man made no move to get closer again.
"Honestly..." John muttered under his breath, steadying himself with the back of the chair. Fucking leg, he hadn't meant to sound
Sherlock did his best to keep his eyes on Mycroft and his voice level as he voiced the question that had been on the tip of his tongue since his brother had stepped in: "Then why did you offer to buy me?"
"I invited him", Lestrade explained, lifting the tape. Holmes slipped to the other side and kept the tape up for both of the men.
"How dare you speak without permission." Lydia's voice was controlled, but she was outraged. She surged at him, bent down to grab his hair, and brought her lips to his ear: "Apologise immediately. And tell her, you wish she'll still take you."
Ms Bruce got up and the printer behind her started working again. ”Make yourself comfortable. Shouldn't take more than ten minutes.”
John sighed, but nevertheless lifted a paperback book and couple of clothes to see what Holmes might have been talking about. From the sound of it, Holmes was rustling papers.
How would he even begin to fix this? Holmes may have let him touch him, but John had not missed his slave's desire to pull away from him. A slave needed to have a healthy amount of fear for its owner, but not like this. John had never wanted for Holmes to think of him as one those masters who would unpredictably lash out on their slaves for the tiniest reason.
Sherlock breathed out, sitting down. Mycroft would've told him he should've known he was under the stairs –he'd been given a tour in the house. Mycroft would've called him unobservant.
He came to accept that his home was no more. This was his home. Nothing would bring his parents back from death. Mycroft was a slave and could not help him. Mycroft might as well have been dead among their parents.
It came out far more bitter than he had intended. He lay down and pulled the blanket over his shoulders, facing the wall. "If you don't need me, I'd like to rest. Goodnight, John."
And yet...he had attacked his owner. It was not a light accusation. Even if the said owner had been the abusive one.
Clearly just running at the first opportunity was not the way –and his poor bottom had been smacked so many times that the soreness would not go away. His eyes were puffy from crying and he was bruised from fighting against his punishments. He needed a better plan. He needed to leave at night when no one would be there to catch him in the act.
"I just did", John reminded. "Even after you had done it on your own. You may be my first personal slave, but you aren't the first slave I've dealt with. I'm a fair owner, I promise you. Act well and I have nothing against rewarding you. Switch on the TV.""
John thanked the slave. When the lift's doors opened, he found himself in a cozy reception area with large windows, green sofas and a handful of potted plants. There were at least thirty people in the room, a few of them with slaves. He eyed the ticket machine. Button number one said “auctions”, number two “lost property”. The sixth read “pensions”, so John pushed it and received a ticket with F135 printed on it.
The defiant look in the slaves eyes only seemed to increase, and his lips curled with confined anger, but the man lowered himself to stand on his knees, bowing his face slightly downwards, still looking at him under his eyebrows.
"Three times," Holmes insisted this time as well. "I've learnt my lesson. I won't try again. But I still wouldn't sign a contract."
"I was evidence," he told, but didn't elaborate why. "Turned out my legal owners didn't want me back anymore, so they kept me. After about a year I was auctioned, but I managed to impress Lestrade and help him with his career. It didn't work out with me and my fifth owner, but my sixth owner was... He encouraged me to help the police. So I did."
"I can, but I'm not sure if I want to…" He was surprised the thought slipped between his lips. Did he really mean that? "It's like he's playing some sort of a game, trying to see how fast he can make me get rid of him."
"Yes, yes. Master, this is Mrs Hudson, Mrs Hudson, my new owner Dr Watson", Holmes did the introductions impatiently.
He heard the shower go off little before the kettle's noise drowned all the other sounds from Sherlock. He prepared cereals and toast, since there wasn't much else. "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!" had to do, there wasn't anything else in the cupboards. Many slaves would have had hard time not eating some themselves without permission, but Sherlock had never liked eating. It seemed to slow down his thoughts, and after living a major part of his life on one meal a day, he wasn't particularly hungry yet. Despite it, his master invited him to sit with him, even allowed him a mug of his own and told him to make toast for himself as well. So Sherlock ate. It could very well be all he'd get to eat today and he didn't have anything to concentrate his mind yet that would take the attention away from inevitable annoyance known as hunger.
His hand was still below the waistband, so he pulled it out discreetly as he arched his neck to look over his shoulder.
Holmes emerged from the bathroom fifteen minutes later after John, freshly showered and face shaven, wearing only a towel. John kept his eyes elsewhere while his slave dressed into a clean pair of jeans and a T-shirt.
Even if the Marlowes didn't entertain their friends anymore, mistress still had her students. But tonight's guest was not a student, nor was she a friend. Or so Hannah said. Sherlock didn't entertain the possibility of leaving the kitchen before the guest was gone. The kettle was on. He had the tray on the counter, teacups set and biscuits ready when Hannah returned.
"I don't think so." His speech was getting better, but his limbs still felt numb and he had trouble focusing his eyes. Moving his head sent everything spinning. Still, he'd managed to make a few details. "Where are we going?"
"Oh no, my mistress is not interested in him", the strange slave assured, examining the tip of his umbrella. "This is purely between myself and him."
Briefly he considered if it would be best just to tell John about his website. If ever, now would be the moment when John might actually be happy of the knowledge he had it. He could take a case and demand for payment.
John's knuckles curled over the cane. He could use it as a weapon should the need arise. It didn't sit well with him to hit a woman, but he would if he had to. "No, it really isn't."
“You’ve got to wait for the next bus that takes slaves”, the driver explained. “Or your slave can follow you later. But this is non-slave turn.”
"Yes, took me less than five minutes to guess yours." His eyebrows shot up mockingly. "Not exactly the Fort Knox."
"You don't believe me," he stated. "Let's make a simple test then. If you could free me, right now, would you?"
It was little compared to what they would have done –had done– to him at The Oyster House for resisting. He much preferred a punishment that left him bruised than those that left no physical mark. He should have given in.
Despite his words and behaviour, under all the irritation, Sherlock was also relived to have seen Mycroft. Still with the same owner, still fat and well taken cared for for a slave. Had a new collar, though. Still loyal to his mistress. Still trying to stick his nose into Sherlock's life. Moving to Baker Street wouldn't change that, not now that Mycroft had found him.
He didn't hear any of the rest of the conversation. All he could do was to stare at his own trembling hands in utter disbelief. Mistress was selling him. By this time tomorrow, he'd be waiting for his new owners to take him away. His new mistress stroked his hair for goodbye, and Sherlock could barely reply to her. Mistress wouldn't have even needed to order him to stay while she showed the guest out, because he didn't think his legs would hold him right now.
Sherlock sighed and sunk on the leather armchair that had become "his" seat. Seat! He had a seat. Unbelievable. Most of his owners hadn't even let him sit on furniture without permission. He leant back and looked at the ceiling.
Detective Inspector Lestrade gave him a call around midday, and later arrived to pick up the wretched pink suitcase. With John's consent he took Holmes for further questioning of the previous night's events. Sherlock was glad to get out.
Acting according to his threats seemed to have cleared the air between them. There was much less tension now, and John no longer hesitated to discipline his slave. So while Sherlock now got hit more often, it was more bearable, knowing it wouldn't escalate the way it had previously.
He didn't say anything. Sherlock's eyes widened as a glowing red mark appeared on the cabbie's chest. It moved slightly to rest on his heart.
Sherlock stayed stubbornly silent. If there was anything he loathed, it was the slave oath. He'd almost rather have the beating than have to speak the oath.
Without thinking any further, Sherlock grabbed the closest box he could carry and rose to go after her.
Tears still rolled on his face each time he blinked, but he was too exhausted for anything more. He wished he could still be at InS with Mycroft. He'd rather be in that cell together with his brother than here. Maybe Mycroft was all alone, locked in a cupboard somewhere just like Sherlock was.
"Good. You can stand up now," John said after a moment of dragging silence. "But I'm not done with you yet, not even nearly. We'll come back to that later."
“Oh.” John couldn’t figure out anything more to say. He wasn’t sure if he was that kind of an owner or if he even knew how to be a slave owner in general. Perhaps it was a silly way to think about it, but it felt like an enormous responsibility to have a slave. This man would belong to him within minutes and John would then almost literally hold his life in his hands. He had certain duties towards his property enforced by the law, but otherwise he could do whatever he wanted to this man.
Sherlock was desperately lonely. He had never been the popular kid at school, nor had he had friends apart from Mycroft, but never in his life had he been this alone in the world, though he was hardly ever left alone apart from the nights when he was locked in the kitchen cupboard where the sorrow and despair hit him like a wave, dragging him down and drowning him into a restless sleep. His days became filled with chores. He began his day helping Hunny with breakfast. He did the dishes and cleaned the kitchen and the bathroom. If he didn't, there would be no breakfast for him. If he refused he was hurt.
Although Holmes would have probably been more than happy to run an errand if it meant he'd get to roam around London freely.
The man smiled briefly before turning completely serious. "Because a short while ago I was under the impression that he was dead."
"Yeah, teaching. Brilliant lads like we used to be", Mike told before shaking his head in amusement. "God, I hate them."
While the pages loaded he examined Detective Inspector's phone. There was a crack on the screen, but it appeared to be in working order. It took him a moment to locate the address book, but he found what he was looking for: Donovan, Sally.
Despite he tried to keep the realisation from his brother, Mycroft saw immediately he had come to some kind of a conclusion. "What?"
Mycroft had said it would be a good thing if he were sold. It didn't feel like it at all, but he tried to be brave. He imagined he was a pirate captain, taken prisoner. He would need to be cunning and clever to escape.
"Usually a new owner, they want to- Well, they want to have a, uh, test ride. I didn't mean to sound like I
"You're a slave," the Detective Inspector continued without acknowledging his request. "And even if you weren't, you can't just go looking for evidence on your own and take it!"
"How did you even get back so quickly?" John asked. Surely the man hadn't walked all the way back with the suitcase.
"It's wonderful", John told truthfully. But he couldn't see how he could ever afford a place like this.
He wished he could. Everyone else did it so easily. Even Mycroft could find pleasure in it. So why couldn't he?
John Watson had never owned a slave in his life. They had a family slave when he and Harry were children, but by the time John had been six years old, her health had rapidly declined from old age and she’d been put down soon after. They never bought another slave. Couldn't afford one, John himself couldn’t afford one once he had moved out. Then he'd joined the army, still unable to afford one, but also entirely unable to maintain one. Not that he had ever really wanted one, not that he thought he should have one. To own a slave would be a life utterly in his hands. And John, given his somewhat...unfortunate history with slaves before the army didn’t feel confident about having such responsibility.
The cabbie shrugged. "Anybody I could walk through a wrong door, really. People who didn't know where they were going, people lost in a new town."
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, mistress," Sherlock wailed as he clung onto her. No, he didn't want to have Hunny hurt him. And as months went by he realised he didn't want to worry his mistress or hurt her feelings, either. He loved playing the violin. He loved learning and absorbing knowledge of all things imaginable. More than he feared being beaten he feared she would take him the music and the books.
Sherlock retreated into his cupboard in the kitchen after his owners had retired for the night. He lay on his back, little lamp switched on, and stared at the underside of the staircase. When he'd been younger, he'd drawn stars and a moon there. On the wall, he had scribbled a ship with a skull and crossbones flag. A stick figure captain threatened his owners with a sword. Near his pillow where he could always read them before sleeping were four words: William Sherlock Scott Holmes. But he hadn't really looked or read them for years now.
The last time, the final time, when Sherlock had been helping Greg's team had ended with him in a hospital. His owner, who after a lot of persuasion had agreed on borrowing Sherlock, had arrived to pick him up mere minutes after everything at the scene was over. Very much in the same manner John Watson had tonight.
"He's your–? I mean, you're–you're brothers?" John blinked at the sight. He couldn't see much familial resemblance.
"I begged for him to stop," Holmes told. "But when he got like that... He didn't see or hear anything. I did the only thing I could think of to stop him. I grabbed the nearest heavy object, I hit him twice and I tied his hands and feet with shoelaces before phoning an ambulance."
"It got it coming," the smaller of the men, still larger than John, spat out. "Arrogant little shit."
"No it's not," John exclaimed in outrage. "It's an extremely kind gesture from the owner. A slave, even a freed one, doesn't have anything. They wouldn't have a place to go and hardly any means to function in the society as a person. An owner who frees a slave must take it as a protégé for years to come. That's why most emancipated slaves marry their owner."
At the crime scene earlier Sherlock had been his old self. For a moment Greg had thought the slave hadn't changed a bit during the last few years until Dr Watson had interfered. He'd never seen the joy of a case die so quickly in Sherlock's eyes. He'd never seen him return to his master's side with such beaten impression, without a word of defiance.
He'd of course heard what InS did to escapees, but he'd never seen the damage up close. It must have been excruciatingly painful –or so he'd heard. He had not interest to ever witness it, much less experience it.
A bearded man wearing light blue coveralls met them at the door. He didn't look pleased in the slightest at the sight of John's slave.
and he shuddered at the memories. How he'd sat in the filthy toilet cubicle, biting into his fist so that the keeper would not hear his sobs, skin still burning from the completely unnecessary smack across his back. He hadn't done anything, he'd had the proper pass to go to the toilet, but that's just how the keepers and paid free men workers were. He was a slave and as long as it didn't stop him from working, they could do whatever they wanted to him.
John slapped him as hard across the face as he dared, avoiding his nose. He didn't want the man to bleed on the fitted carpet after all.
He knew his bargaining was for naught. He had absolutely nothing to offer. If she had wanted him to work harder or practice more, she would have told him so. If he had done something wrong, she would have disciplined and corrected him. He had nothing to offer because anything he could do was hers already.
If Sherlock got lucky, somebody rich enough would buy him to keep company for their children, though Mycroft could see hundreds of ways that would end up leading to a catastrophe. But the unfortunate fact was that the children of Sherlock's age were wanted products on the industrial field. They were small and had deft fingers useful for assembling small parts. Anything that said "handmade" was likely done by a slave. That, too, could only end badly for Sherlock. Thank goodness he was too young to be legally sold to sex industry, so Mycroft needn't worry over that.
"I don't like your tone", John snapped. "You already had your meal this morning, so after you're done you can start cleaning the bathroom. I thought I told you to tidy up this place."
Holmes sagged against the wall a little more at each strike. He tried to keep quiet, so each cry and yelp of pain came suppressed between grit teeth. Anger washed over John. It took him over, all the frustration from the past few days controlled his arms. He was only distantly aware of shrieks of pain he drew out of his slave.
"Sherlock Holmes, mistress", he sniffed, too late remembering what Mycroft had told him about his real name.
The notes left with the bodies were equally unsettling. Each just a slip of paper containing a single word. In order of their death, the words formed a full sentence: PATIENCE MY DEAR SHERLOCK
No reply came from the slave and he didn't move an inch from the bed where he was apparently just resting, eyes closed but his hands brought over his chest into a prayer-like position. John pushed the chair a bit further away from the table to see the slave better.
"What about that? What is it?" John asked, pointing at paper bag Holmes had left on the kitchen counter behind himself.
He should have asked how Mycroft had found him. Why now and not a year ago when he was sold back? Must have been because it was InS selling him again. Back then he was officially sold by an American client, despite the fact that InS had handled the sale.
He was still angry in the morning as he poked his slave awake. Not as angry as he'd been the previous night, and he did feel bad about overreacting. But Holmes deserved it, he reasoned. In fact it was long due considering he'd only resorted to physical discipline once before last night. It had certainly not been an easy first week with his new slave.
"You've got to be kidding me," John groaned, bringing a hand to his face. He felt like exploding any second now, but Holmes remained blissfully ignorant.
Frustrated he started to make his way back to the restaurant when he stepped on something. He looked down and saw a phone. Not just any phone. Detective Inspector Lestrade's phone, the one Holmes had been using. He pocketed the device and ran back to the street to hail himself a taxi as well. Holmes was chipped, he only needed to get online, purchase the damn tracking device service and he'd have an instant access on Holmes's real time location.
"You've acquired him quite recently, haven't you?" the woman continued, putting away the mobile. "99OR-79/3J3A."
He stroked the inner side of his left wrist where he knew the tattoos to be. 99OR-79/3J3A. Such an innocent series of numbers and letters, yet they had the power to rob away his humanity.
Just a familiar nightmare, he told himself, but it did nothing to silence the voice in his head that still cried desperately for her child.
understand that his owners had been right all along. Of course they had been. It had been foolish to think he knew better. His owners knew better. Pursuing freedom and fighting back hadn't made him happy. Being useful and making his owners proud was his source of happiness and stability.
Holmes had been on his knees instantly. "No, please. I'm sorry I was late. I can't promise it won't happen again, but I accept
"Really?" Well, there was something they had in common then. Something he might be able to discuss about. Ella would be so proud of him, socialising like this. "I actually just got myself a slave last week."
"And some of them get no warmth whatsoever," Mycroft replied. Holmes's scowl only deepened and John, really not knowing what to say, started considering a hasty retreat to the kitchen.
Several jaws dropped and it was suddenly so quiet one could have heard a needle drop in the stunned silence followed by Holmes's outburst. John clenched his teeth in a mixture of humiliation and anger. His left hand, curled in a tight fist, was shaking. His right hand gripped the cane, knuckles gone white. He wasn't a man easily enraged, but it wasn't everyday he was humiliated like this in front of a dozen police officials. No slave should ever speak like that to his owner, and absolutely not in front of other people. Even the people he hadn't been introduced to had heard Holmes and were staring. Several slaves looked at them with such alarmed expressions one would've assumed they were expecting to be beaten themselves.
She sat in the armchair and her guest on the sofa. The guest turned to look at him curiously from head to toe as he approached.
John stopped abruptly at the slave's plea for mercy. Holmes had screamed, but he hadn't said a word until now.
"Sherlock, do not give your name to your owners. It's the only thing you really have. Do not let them have your real name. And whatever happens, I need you to promise me one thing."
John licked his lips. Was there anything else? He was certain Holmes would try to bend the rules if he wasn't thorough enough. "Right...I guess that's all for now. Or do you have any questions?"
"Thank you", the man said, pushing the chair quickly back. He strode to the kitchenette with a few long steps and returned to the table after adding several spoonfuls of the sauce on his plate.
Someone knelt beside him and Sherlock tried desperately to stand up. Oh god, he had to get up and work or they'd kill him, too.
Sherlock came to a sudden halt. He didn't know where he was. All the streets lined with parked cars looked the same. He could see his breath against the yellow street lights as the cold began to settle in.
Sherlock saw him looking and for a moment a knot twisted in his stomach. Each time with a new owner he feared they might not honour his ownership to it. Twice he'd already accepted he'd lost it forever. But for once the bureaucracy that ran the InS had been on his side.
"But I guess I need to move out", he sighed eventually. "I just can't sustain living in London with the army pension."
"This is an unfortunate situation..." the man mumbled, fingers pinching the frames of his glasses. They were so large they seemed to cover most of his small face. "You have no guardians. No one has stepped forward. If you were seventeen you might be able to become your brother's legal guardian, but as for now you're too young. I'm sorry. Unless someone offers to foster you by Tuesday you'll become The Institute's property."
This was all he had. Lydia Marlowe was all he had left in the world –and he didn't quite remember why he'd thought any other way would be better. It wasn't such a bad life after all.
Sherlock opened his eyes to see him poking at John's used sock with the tip of his umbrella. He sprang up and kicked the sock under John's chair where its pair likely was as well. "It's exactly as John likes it."
"I'd rather you punish me," Holmes said, ignoring the correction. "I didn't have to let him in, but I did. He shouldn't be blamed."
After some impatient prompting from Lestrade, Holmes said he'd share his findings after he could borrow Lestrade's smartphone. He then concluded the same the DI had already told them, but added that she probably worked in the media sector, had come from Cardiff only hours earlier to stay one night in London, and that she had multiple lovers.
It took nearly two weeks until Sherlock saw Mrs Hudson again. She didn't see him, and he had no way of getting to her.
"Lucky me", Sherlock sighed, but his mind was already racing. There was only one person in the world who'd pay anything in his power to own him, but neither owning him nor buying him were within his powers. M could only be Mycroft. But why offer to buy him when Mycroft was equally aware of the impossibility of his emancipation? If he was planning something, why now and what? How? He wanted to ask John how he had been approached, but John would find it suspicious.
John’s first reaction was irritation for being interrupted, but as the slave kept speaking in an endless flow of words, seemingly without stopping to breathe at all, John couldn’t helped but to listen in awe. Once he stopped, John stared at him and he stared back with unwavering blue eyes.
He heard the guest hum approvingly. "And the violin? That's the most important thing of course. Could I hear him play?"
"It isn't easy for me, either, you know that," his brother sighed. They were both highly proud individuals, and despite spending good twenty years in slavery, it still took Mycroft effort to swallow his pride, bow his head and submit. With Anthea, or rather, Andrea, but only select few were privy to her real name and he himself only ever addressed her as his mistress. With her it was routine, something he didn't spend too much time thinking about, but the people he worked with and met every day... Had he been free, he could have easily been their superior. Now everything he said had to go through Andrea to be taken seriously unless it were the people who worked with him on a daily basis.
Ms Bruce reached for the printer and then handed him the paper. “Please check that all your personal information is correct and then sign here.”
Sherlock knew only one such slave, but even Mycroft, classified as a lethal weapon for his duty to bodyguard his mistress, most certainly did not practice capoeira. Capoeira and other disguised forms of fighting and self-defence for slaves were highly illegal. A slave caught practicing one could be put down with no questions asked.
Blinding floodlights against the pitch black sea. That annoying baby crying and crying non-stop so loudly behind him he had heard it clearly above the engine's noise. It had been a small boat. Definitely not made for almost thirty people and not meant for crossing the North Sea. But he had thought it would have been enough.
"Not anymore, no," mistress replied. "Bit of rebelliousness when we got him, but nothing out of the ordinary. He'd just been enslaved, when we bought him. And all slaves go through a phase at some point. But that's all behind now, isn't it, Holmes?"
he deserved it. If it weren't for him, surely Mummy and Daddy would still live. If it weren't for him they would have never left the party early. Maybe if he had not cried, maybe then the car would not have crashed.
"What do we know?" he wanted to know as they followed Lestrade inside. This time, however, Holmes walked behind him, head bowed down a little. Even his voice was softer and much less demanding than it had been outside.
It gave John more time to try to sort out things in his life. He cancelled his appointments with Ella, and sent out a few more job applications. Three days after the move he received an acceptance letter for Holmes's permission to use and carry money, or use John's card. It meant a new trip to InS headquarters for a chip update in two days time. With that done, John could dump the responsibility over shopping to Holmes as well. All in all, despite everything, life seemed pretty good for the first time since returning to London.
Yes, master. I'm sorry, master. Here, master. Thank you, master. Please, master. May I, master? Thirty-eight, master. Can I be of use, master?
John went straight to bed without hearing the smallest sound from the slave. When he woke up in the morning he'd completely forgotten the existence of Holmes until he, still half asleep, opened the door to the loo.
John closed the the Handbook and placed in on the table. He sipped his coffee with a sigh. Not for the first time since his return to England John thought back to the slaves they'd had at their disposal in the army, especially to one of them. Before the army he had always prided himself for the fact that he didn't need to resort to slaves for company, but he had to admit it had been very nice and convenient to have slaves around who willingly fulfilled any request you might have had. Truth to be told, sex with those slaves had been the best he'd ever had. And god he missed it.
She flinched and oohed again when someone kicked the front door twice. John's brows drew together and he flexed his fingers.
"You know", John started, "I can't remember the last time I've had cereals for breakfast. I just bought them at some point and then never even opened the package."
John turned to briefly look at the man crouching on the floor, not commenting her words. The man was skinny and pale, but not in a way he’d seen abused slaves being skinny. He wasn’t malnourished. Just regularly skinny like a slave. He clearly had muscles, but he could also see the man’s spine visibly sticking out from his back. The scars didn’t stand out much from the pale skin, but they were scars and there were lot of them. If they weren’t caused by an abusive owner, they were unquestionably a bad sign. There were only so many reasons for a slave to be legally caused such wounds.
John must have known that Sherlock could perfectly well hear him, were it in shower or at night in his bed. Especially those few times online porn had been involved. But again, Sherlock was only a slave. It didn't matter what he saw or heard. After the first few weeks of insecurity about a slave around at all times, John now seemed to feel at ease with his presence. He didn't necessarily order him out of the room when he changed clothes. After a shower he didn't feel the need to hurry covering himself with a towel.
The slave's voice had been pitched and breathless, he'd sounded as if he didn't quite believe or want to believe what he was saying. "I hit him. I hit my own master."
"Really? I tried to get the department to buy you back then, you know. After that last case, and when they refused I figured I'd just buy you myself, but you'd already been sold by the time I got there."
Sherlock straightened his back, abandoning the drunk act as he turned back to the window. He disconnected the call. "How do you make them take the poison?"
"Of course." He wouldn't mind at all if he could play somewhere. If John got money out of it, that was just a bonus.
"If it's alright with you", he responded to Lestrade, but Holmes didn't wait for them to exchange more words.
"If you cannot speak with respect, you shouldn't speak at all," he was told and disciplined for daring to insult his owners. They silenced him with a muzzle. Like the slave collar around his neck, it was impossible to remove without an extra pair of hands.
Lestrade tolerated him, Mrs Hudson felt she owed him. But neither ever forgot what he was. And John Watson, while fascinating in his attempt to be both, a master and a friend, owned him.
Sherlock let the man's rant sink in for a while before straightening his back. Even thinking was like swimming in some kind of thick, murky water. He leant forward, both arms on the table now. "Oh,
With quick, sharp sentences he spoke of the cabbie's lonely life. How he had no one at home waiting for him, not even a slave. Of the wife that had left him and of the children he still loved and she had taken away. And as he spoke he could see Hope's mask slipping. The more Sherlock spoke, the more it twisted a knife in him. At first it was sorrow and shame, but as soon as Sherlock mentioned the kids his eyes narrowed and anger flared.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. He had no bruises that would have been visible with clothing. Something in his body language must have given them away to Mycroft's keen eye, despite trying to hide any pain or discomfort came to him so naturally he hardly even paid any conscious attention to it.
Sherlock stood up, still angry, still humiliated, but he tried to push the feelings aside and stomped to the bed. No one would care for his feelings, and he had far more important and interesting things to mull over. There was still a serial killer at loose. So he sat down on the edge of the bed, steepled his fingers before his face and ignored John the best he could.
John arched an eyebrow half amusedly, half as a challenge. The man looked like he could snap a poker in half with his bare hands. "And what did
"99OR-79/4J4B, three minutes to strip. We start by filling the auction hall A." His bag was thrown in and the door closed again.
"See? You wouldn't. I don't blame you. If our roles were reversed, had I always been free, I wouldn't give a toss about your rights, either. I'd use you and I wouldn't care if you got hurt."
"Amongst other things. I happened to be in the area and mistress has no further use for me right now."
Backwards. It should have been Sherlock pulling a seat for John and pouring him tea. A master should not apologise nor make amends, not to a slave.
"Uh, I've no strong feelings for or against", John answered, taken aback by the unexpected question. "Why?"
He still saw, but he had learnt to ignore. Looking at people for too long meant trouble. Telling what he saw meant pain. He thought he must have imagined it, when his attention was caught by a woman's voice with an English accent. It pulled his mind out of the stagnation, it rang clear above the noise. His eyes sought frantically for its source, his conscious self not quite trusting it had been real.
"House keeping. Sometimes people rent a house slave if their own is ill, or if they don't have one, but need to impress someone. I could drive if you renew my licence."
John would let him, surely. He was so desperate for it. Sherlock would help him undress, make sure to brush against his skin as he did. Maybe pay him a compliment. He'd done it hundreds of times –calculatingly, convincingly.
John ran his fingers through his hair. Despite being horrified of having lost himself to his anger like that, he was still angry. "For tonight, yeah. But that was just for disobeying me now. We'll deal with the rest tomorrow."
If Sherlock were to name one pro amongst all the cons of being a slave it would be queuing. Free people were easily tempted to queue jump a slave, but the slaves were in an equal rush to fulfil their tasks. The solution was obvious –separate queues for slaves. Not every shop had them, and most not all the time, but one could almost certainly find one or two during the busiest hours. Scarce were the free people who would willingly go to a till that said "slaves only". Most rather queued than paid at the slaves' till even if offered the opportunity.
The fractious mood stuck with the slave for the rest of the day. He seemed to once again be testing his master's nerves, but John was determined to not be affected by it.
"Your slave's been helpful with a few police cases in the past", Lestrade explained. "He used to be owned by the Yard –sort of. Hasn't he told you?"
The photos were a clear game changer. By the next day the advert had produced twenty-six emails. Majority John trashed immediately. Couldn't people read? It was clearly written he wasn't renting Holmes for sex. He replied to fourteen messages and got two replies. Soon he had Holmes booked for a birthday group for the Friday night.
John gave the slave a brief look from head to toe. He was tall, taller than John, but then again, it wasn’t a big achievement. He was a few years younger than John and looked the part, had a curly black hair, pale skin, piercing blue eyes and it was very clear he had been fully shaven some time ago. He had scars on his back, so John wouldn’t have called him “prime condition”. John quickly settled for his face. It wasn’t a bad face, but quite far from what he had been hoping for. He wouldn’t have said the face was unpleasant, but there was definitely something alien about it. Alien in a weird, handsome way. But it was a male. The slave’s jaw was tense and he stared intensively at the wall behind his to be master. John thought he really ought to say something. Maybe he could still get a female if he opened his mouth now. Ms Bruce looked at him as if expecting him to say something, and when he didn’t, she pushed the slave’s shoulder down and hissed: “Floor.”
“99OR-79/3J3A”, she read from a small tablet’s screen without bothering to look at him. “Change immediately and follow me. You’re leaving.” She clearly had already gone through his file for she added: “
I'm sorry it's taken me longer to update than I anticipated. I've been busier with real life than usual and it took me forever until I was even somewhat happy with what I'd written.
He had no obligation to serve anyone but his owner, physically or otherwise. He had the right to refuse. But when you weren't allowed to even touch a free citizen without permission, let alone harm them, practice proved harder than theory.
"I should hope so," his brother replied. "And how are you doing with yours? Last time you were rather sore and you don't appear much better now."
Like an animal caught in the headlights, Sherlock froze momentarily. The man was one of his keepers and his cane hit him on the back as he hastily kowtowed. Mrs Hudson stood up, yelping in surprise.
"Almost done," Holmes announced. He turned on his heels to go back, but quickly turned around again. "How was your day, master?"
He had, of course, disciplined slaves in the army, but it wasn't something he liked to do and many of his army mates had rolled their eyes and said he was going too easy on them. But it wasn't him going easy on them. It was him being careful with them. Slaves were human, too, and as a doctor he knew how fragile human beings could be. Especially since back in the army it was him who would have to waste time on patching them up if someone went too far.
Mycroft did his best, yet by the end of January they were still no closer to finding anyone, even though on Sherlock's tenth birthday on the 6th the house had been full of flowers and cards of condolences for their loss. There was little to celebrate, when they'd attended a funeral just a day before. No one but them and their slave were present. Mummy and Daddy had been buried, and neither Mycroft or Sherlock returned to school. February the 10th was their deadline. The local authorities seemed to have no interest in their case apart from the fact that once they were enslaved their property and lands would fall in the hands of the county.
"Almost a year", he replied. With all the shipments in and out it was easy to keep a track of the dates. Horrifyingly so. There was no escape from the knowledge of how long he had been here.
"I'm wearing this ridiculous collar because people keep mistaking me for a free man. I'll have the word "slave" tattooed on my forehead if that's what it takes to stop that from happening."
“There’ll be a few other documents you need to sign after I’ve brought the slave, but that's it”, she confirmed. “Are you familiar with the slave rights?”
“It comes with a standard ID chip on the left arm. It has a GPS tracker that can be accessed online. I’ll enclose your log-in information for our online services with the contracts. It’s covered by the basic insurance automatically. However, in this case I would
"Who would notice me?" It was both the curse and the blessing of being a slave. No one cared what he saw or heard, but neither did they want to listen to him.
The umbrella man chuckled, sounding far too amused for John's liking. "No, nothing like that, I assure you. I don't think he would ever choose to use the word "friend"."
Donovan's jaw dropped and Anderson turned to look at her over his shoulder. They exchanged a quick look before Anderson turned back to Holmes. "Look, whatever you're implying–"
John wasn't sure whether Holmes's reaction was a deep nod or a half arsed bow, but he went to the bed and fell down on it like a log. John surfed the web for the news and weather for another half an hour before closing the laptop into the drawer with his illegal firearm. As far as he could tell, Holmes hadn't moved an inch.
Work kept him busy for the next three days, and Holmes's good behaviour persisted. Lestrade phoned him, asking if he could borrow Holmes. He agreed, but was secretly disappointed not to be able to go with them. But perhaps it had been for the best. Despite still remaining polite, Holmes complained it had been incredibly boring and waste of his time.
Had Sherlock been in his slave mode, he would have flinched at the cabbie's tone. But at the moment he wasn't a slave. At the moment they were equals. He could look at his abductor in the eye with confidence he rarely got to show without severe consequences.
"Watch, Sherlock." Hannah clutched his hand so hard it hurt as they sat safely behind the plexiglass. The room behind the window was white and sterile before they brought the slaves in. "Just this once. Watch. Watch and you'll never, ever think of escaping again."
Sherlock would have hated to admit it, but the cabbie was right. He didn't need to be forced to follow the murderer inside. His own curiosity was enough to drive him. He got on his unsteady legs and took several staggering steps towards the cabbie. The world went spinning around him and he would've probably lost his balance entirely had the cabbie not been there to support him. He didn't resist when the man helped him inside the building and through the dark corridors.
"Thank you," Holmes breathed out. He looked at the offered phone suspiciously, but took it. "There's an address tag on the case. Read out the phone number for me."
“Prime condition, as you can see”, she hurried to say, hastily making the man turn around a full circle. “Just turned thirty-three, excellent health despite it’s been two years in America”, she read from her tablet.
"I'm a slave, the risk's always lingering somewhere," Sherlock dismissed. "You though...you've been dying for three years."
The owner and Donovan had had an outright screaming competition when the man insisted Sherlock was his property and he could discipline him the way he felt was needed. Sally screamed back at him how he was way overdoing it, how his form of discipline was verging on illegal.
John didn't say anything. The man stayed up for another hour or so before Sherlock heard him get up and walk to the kitchenette and back. The lights went off and he heard John make his way to the bed, his breathing soon turning into deep and steady rhythm Sherlock had by now learnt meant the man had fallen asleep.
As Mycroft had said, Sherlock should do his utmost best to ensure John would keep him. He'd done it with master and mistress Summers. He could do so with John.
John didn't pretend he knew much about playing instruments. He'd only played clarinet unsuccessfully for a while in his youth. But even so, Holmes seemed skilful. He had tried calling several places by now during his lunch breaks, but alas hadn't found anyone interested in renting a violinist. Two places he'd reached out to actually remembered Holmes, and had nothing but good things to say. Holmes wasn't a musical genius, but very good nevertheless. It was a good sign, but didn't help John. He needed money now. He didn't regret moving, but doing so and getting a slave had come with unexpected expenses. Perhaps there could be something else he could rent his slave for.
John wasn't surprised in the least to return to an empty flat. Wherever Holmes had gone, it wasn't home, but this time he didn't bother checking the GPS. He was certain Holmes would return eventually. And when he would, John would have him beg for forgiveness.
“If this item doesn’t suit you, you can request it to be changed for another slave during that time. After three years there will still be a period of two years when it can’t be sold privately. Basically, if after three years you decide you don’t want to keep it, you can hand it back to The Institution and The Institution will compensate you, but won’t give you another slave anymore. If after five years you still want to keep it, the resell rights will be handed to you as well.”
He jolted awake to the sound of doors slammed open. There were footsteps and shouting and people, but he couldn't make sense of any of it.
Holmes was returned to him soon after eleven the next morning by a hungover lad in his mid-twenties.
A year into this world, to this never ending load of work. It was sometimes hard to remember anything existed before it. Hard to remember who he was. That he was a person at all.
Mycroft tilted his head slightly and looked a him with a calculating look for half a second. "I wish you would stop blaming yourself."
Mrs Spedding turned her eyes back on the young man on the floor. Sherlock cast down his eyes. It wasn't polite to stare at free people.
"Get yourself something to eat and sit down", John snapped. Maybe it was the headache, but Holmes's sudden obedience felt incredibly annoying. "Did you answer the phone?"
Sherlock waited for the door to close behind his owner and listened in silence for a while. A genuine smile crept on his face and he couldn’t help but to make a little victorious jump out of excitement. He was alone and unsupervised. Time to get some fresh air.
," the cabbie smirked as he watched Sherlock struggling to stay on his own two feet. He took the bottle left on the table and unhurriedly screwed the lid open.
"But you did. I didn't ask for your opinion and you'd do well to keep your mouth shut unless told otherwise. You are not a free man, so get on your knees
Lestrade sighed exaggeratedly, but dug his pockets for a replacement phone to make a memo. Sherlock watched his fingers tap the tiny keyboard.
John thought of the previous night. Did he know? He had, the moment Holmes had asked him to, but his slave hadn't said a word before that. What if Holmes hadn't pleaded for him to stop?
slave. And the way you've been behaving, the things you've said —it's unacceptable. I can't let you get away with it. We can't– I can't..."
Holmes stared at him mouth half opened. John couldn't tell if he was shocked or outraged, but after a second it seemed to click in his head that he was still in fact a slave and that John was his master. He peeled off the nicotine patches reluctantly.
She re-crossed her legs and her eyebrow rose questioningly, but she remembered what he was talking about before asking out loud. "You went to get the slave?"
The enormity of the situation never dawned upon Sherlock until an official from the local branch of Great British Institute of Slavery knocked on their door. They spoke with Mycroft in Mummy's office, but Sherlock knew the best spot for eavesdropping. If the local authorities and Mycroft couldn't find them legal guardians by the end of the month, InS would step in. They'd be handed over and sold into slavery, and their home and slaves and all property would be lost to them.
"Natural then", Holmes said with another nod. "I should perhaps mention that my previous mistress preferred me clean, so it's-" He swallowed and his eyes darted elsewhere for a second. "Well, you saw me. It'll grow back."
Sherlock tore his eyes away and turned sharply back at Lestrade. "Anyway. It's late," he declared. "And my master's there. I should check on him."
"Which is precisely why I wear such an exaggerated collar", the man patiently explained, frowning slightly as he spoke. He glanced meaningfully at John's hand. "To avoid someone losing their face by making an embarrassing mistake. My mistress would be most displeased if that were to ever happen again..."
John got in and while he advised the driver of his address, the slave walked around the car to get in as well. He placed his bag on the empty middle seat, eying at his new owner curiously.
Holmes frowned and John glanced at his hand holding the business card. He tucked it quickly back into his pocket where it had been. He hadn't noticed he had slipped it out.
"An interested party", she smirked. The car stopped and the locks unlocked. John gathered his cane and shopping bag.
"You idiot," Mycroft cursed, pulling him away. "Stupid child, don't you know when to keep your mouth shut?"
"Quite clear", Holmes replied with a sickeningly sweet smile. "Is your wife away for long? Did she take the slave with her?"
"Well done!" she cheered and ruffled his hair. "I'm sure we'll get along very well. Tell me your name."
Sherlock accepted his words with a nod. Truth to be told, he had been worried. One needn't be a genius to figure out why the man had trouble sleeping. And he was surprised, given that he'd been with the man for over a week now that John hadn't yet ordered him into his bed. Sherlock had after all heard him in the shower twice quite clearly. Sex, Sherlock assumed, was something a man like John would have to soothe his nerves. He was a soldier and it was no secret that military bases were equipped with slaves whose sole purpose was to cater to the soldiers' sexual needs and offer them comfort. But perhaps tonight was not the night John required such services after all.
"Sorry." Sherlock backtracked to the kitchen, refilled the kettle and logged in on John's laptop while the water boiled. His inbox had nothing worth of his attention. He was routinely asked to track down runaway slaves, but he never bothered replying no matter what they may have offered him in return.
"What shall I play, ma'am?" he asked, first time taking a proper look at their guest. Mrs Spedding was around the same age as mistress Marlowe. She had narrow eyebrows, perfectly done red lipstick, and dark brown hair, done up so that her ears and the large earrings were properly visible. She was almost certainly here because she was looking for a new violin tutor for someone. He felt a sudden pang of nervousness. Mistress had always said that one day she would have him tutor children. Perhaps this was the reason why she was showing him off. Mistress's guest was considering to have Sherlock tutor her child. She had at least one child, probably around the age of six.
Two identical buildings formed the Roland-Kerr Further Education College he'd arrived to. Both were mostly dark at this hour. Was Holmes inside? Or somewhere out in the yard between them? The GPS signal wasn't reliable enough for him know for sure.
Jeff Hope looked at him, thinking. Judging. He leant back on his chair and shook his head slowly. "Nah. You're not him."
"And when will that be?" Sherlock spoke silently, eyes lingering at his master's back who'd taken several steps into the living room.
"Why must you defy me?" Lydia Marlowe lamented. "Do you think I want to have Hunny hurt you? What profit would I make of you if I hurt you?"
"This is no instrument for a child," she'd said. "You will play it when you're older. I will put it away until you're worthy of it."
He had long since abandoned his native accent. It had only made him the favourite target for the keepers and overseers to pick on. The couple phrases he ever spoke came naturally American now.
"Capoeira?" he questioned coolly. It was a martial art, disguised as a dance of some kind. Created by slaves somewhere in southern America, but the nuisance had since spread across the pond. Any slave practicing any form of martial art without a proper licence to do so could face an instant death sentence.
"I guess you're right," John admitted. "Alright. Hen party it is. You can help me write the advert. We'll put up another one for music, too, just in case."
"That you can't cook. It's not like I'm going to flog you for that, if that's what you're afraid of. So, next time when there's something you really just can't physically do, just tell me. I mean, I didn't even read your file yet. I don't know where you've been before. I saw you were used as bed slave, but I just assumed you were a full time house slave."
Sherlock quickly grew restless in the plain room that offered him so little to do. They were both briefly occupied by making deductions of the previous lodgers and Sherlock entertained himself by playing pirates in the top bunk. Mycroft humoured him by acting as a sea monster. But nothing held Sherlock's interest for long.
"I'm flogging you the moment we're back home", John vowed, but despite himself did exactly what Holmes wanted him to do. He examined the body, noticed the mysterious "rache" on the floor while doing so and explained what undoubtedly Lestrade's team already knew. Asphyxiation, passed out and choked in her own vomit.
And what frightened him the most was that somewhere deep within him a part of him wanted to. A part of him that truly was a slave wanted to love and want his master, wanted to submit and serve. The slave in him just wanted to feel secure and safe again. Wanted the relief of knowing someone else always knew what was best for him. It's sickened him. He wasn't like that. He would
"Yes, yes, alright!" He gulped down the lump in his throat after John let go. The sudden sharp pain watered his eyes.
", he managed to growl between grit teeth. If Holmes apologised immediately they could leave it at that, but of course he didn't. John could hear a concurrent, shocked gasps of disbelief around him when the slave kept standing tall, his chin held high and eyes fixed at his owner in a silent challenge. John really didn't want to resort in violence, but if he would not take immediate action to discipline his property, this already exceedingly embarrassing situation would turn into a complete and utter mortifying humiliation.
"It's not that, master Watson. My mistress is all right," the boy explained. "There's someone at the door."
he was meant to say, but instead he found entirely different set of words coming out of his mouth: “Right, no. No, I think that pretty much covered it.”
”Uh, yes”, John replied and limped through the door the slave kept opened for him. ”I'm here to collect a slave.”
When John said nothing, Holmes speculated further: "That, or at least you've very closely witnessed something you think you should've prevented."
It was long past midnight when they made their way back to John's flat. Holmes seemed to have lost all of his previous energy and dozed off entirely in the taxi. He slumped against the seat and leant to his master, head on his shoulder.
. Have you seen her fingers? It hurt. No, whatever it is, it's important. Probably Rachel. Find out who she is. Again, if the husband doesn't know, ask the slaves in private. Better yet, have another slave talk to them, it's often easier that way."
So instead of going to his master, Sherlock closed his eyes, willing himself to ignore the sounds around him. He had constructed his primary mind palace to his childhood home. In there everything is still like it was when he was a free human being. Sherlock stepped inside through the front door to the hall. He wasn't looking for anything, just checking everything was in its place. His mind palace had grown throughout the years into a vast library of information that could not be thoroughly walked through in one night, so he decided to head for parts he hadn't recently checked. In his mind he walked around the hall, up the stairs and through the hallway to his parents' bedroom. Everything was as it should be and he had nothing new to add to the rooms upstairs. He had even constructed a new section for his new master, where he could store away the details he needed to know to keep him satisfied. So far it didn't include much, though most of normal people would have disagreed. But then again, normal people never observed.
Because a slave who hurts a free man deserves to be beaten, whispered a treacherous voice at the back of his mind. Because a slave who dishonours its owner should be beaten. Because he deserved to be blamed.
And of course Ella had made him promise he'd go to the interview, though he hadn't told her what kind of a job it was. He wasn't sure if she'd approve. He'd focused on talking about another one he had later today.
“Well, we can’t remove it from you or anything. The first three years are a trial period of a kind.”
Holmes lifted an eyebrow. It was a silent challenge, John knew it, but goddammit he didn't want to flog anyone. He didn't even own a whip or a cane or anything yet! Clearly he needed to add that to his shopping list. He grit his teeth in annoyance and ran his fingers through his hair. He should have anticipated something like this, he really should have. He'd read the damn file about Holmes! Strict rules, control and physical disciplining.
Lydia laughed. "Oh, Holmes. Don't be silly. You'll never be able to pay for yourself. She's paying twenty-five-thousand pounds for you."
John watched as Holmes crouched down next to the woman. His hands trailed under her coat's collar, he leant closer to sniff, emptied her pockets, examined her hands and jewellery. Was this, whatever he was doing, why someone wanted to own him? Enough to offer nearly anything in exchange. No slave was worth what he'd been offered, surely.
something. Besides, he couldn't properly see out without sitting on the top bunk. At this point he was desperate enough to stare at the little strip of blue sky and the wall of the opposite building visible behind the glass. Seeing even a glimpse of a bird or something else that
Thank you so much for the interest towards my fic and for all the comments so far! They make me tremendously happy! I hope you enjoyed this chapter as well. :)
John closed the door behind them without a word and moved past the men to stand between them and his property.
Thank you for all the nice comments and interest towards this fic. I hope you liked this chapter as well. How do you feel about Mycroft? Please leave a comment if you have time. That would be nice. ♥
"Not yet, no. Unfortunately I'm very well informed of your situation. Which is exactly why you shouldn't waste this."
"Wash the dishes, make the bed and do some general cleaning around here while I'm gone. The first two I expect you to do every day. You can sleep on the bed if you want. I'll be back around the same time as yesterday."
"It's there in my file, isn't it? I'm ill-tempered and bad-mouthed. I'm not a good slave", Holmes snapped.
At this point is was common to begin to address one’s master directly. John waited whether Holmes would do that, or continue disrespecting him and distancing himself by still speaking of his master as a third person. Holmes drew a breath and his eyes moved to look at him as it was customary when starting to speak the oath directly to one's owner. His lips moved exaggeratedly as he forced himself to continue and the words to come out clear and as calm as he could manage.
"I'm not allowed to leave without permission," he told. Not only a convenient excuse, but also the truth. "Get out."
He shivered under his coat. It was cold on the floor, and the empty fireplace next to him gave no warmth. His master slept comfortably in his bed, radiator right there between him and the wall. Sherlock almost hoped he could have crawled to sleep under his new master's bed, next to the radiator, even if it wasn't a bed made for that kind of thing. Sex even might have been worth it, if he'd been allowed to spend the rest of the night sharing the same bed for warmth.
John hummed in agreement and decided not to correct him. Even though John was still a little uncomfortable with the idea of being a master, he was one. And it would do no harm for Holmes to speak more like his kind.
"You're..." Holmes's brows furrowed in confusion and he dropped the polite speech pattern, "apologising me?"
"I know," he eventually said. "Believe me, I do. But I can't. I'm not like you, and I won't become like you."
He had, of course, met and worked with plenty of slaves during his life. He’d used slaves just like any normal citizen would. Slaves were, after all, an essential part of everyday life no matter where you went. Well, almost at least, if one didn’t count the few strange hippie countries that had outlawed slavery. It was a miracle their economy survived.
"Forgive me, master, but yes you were." The slave drew a breath and exhaled before adding: "I mean no disrespect. Your therapy is going nowhere. You benefit more from sleeping."
But why make an offer to buy him, when they both knew it was impossible? Or had he found some kind of a loop hole?
John sat on the edge of bed and eyed at the case curiously while Holmes took his towel to the bathroom. He didn't touch the instrument, though. It belonged to Holmes and John had no right to take it. But he had to wonder how Holmes had come to own such a thing. Slaves rarely owned anything and most commonly clothes or cheap accessory. He didn't know anything about violins, but this particular one didn't look new. It was in good conditions, at least to his eyes. According to Holme's papers it was antique and looking at it now that was easy to believe. The case was newer, but not new either. It had a small metal plate with letters S.H. engraved to it.
"W-what? No! No, I can do it," Sherlock assured him quickly. This was exactly what he had feared. John needed more than his pension earned him and the stag do was good money. "Don't worry, I will do it."
“Right, here we are. Bathroom’s here, kitchen’s over there”, John explained with a wave of his free left hand. “Just leave your stuff somewhere where it’s not in the way. I’ll figure out where you can put it later”, he planned, handing his coat to the slave. “Brew me a cup of tea for starters, I have to print out some CVs.”
were both phrases any slave would use to describe their owners no matter what kind of owners they were. They were empty words. It was no more than a polite phrase, but something in the softness of Holmes's voice betrayed there was more to it. John had never thought of it before, but it must have been a huge shock for a child to be sold to slavery, to move in with strangers who became his owners.
They stared at each other for a while in silence. John was the first to look away and break the tension. He wanted nothing more than to unleash it and anger he was feeling, but this wasn't about him, was it? Human lives were at stake.
Besides, he reasoned, it was just another new owner, another new idiot to serve. If he’d just play his cards well now, then who knows, life might be interesting for a little while. So he smiled, fished out the teabag, threw it away, poured the milk and stirred the hot beverage while walking. He put it down on the desk to his new master’s left-hand side and eyed at the computer screen over his shoulder. The browser was opened on a blogging site.
It was only half past two and Sherlock seriously considered leaving despite been ordered not to, when he heard heavy footsteps climbing up the stairs. He would have recognised them anywhere.
"There's no law that'd prohibit a slave from having a free e-mail account", Holmes said defensively.
Sherlock hesitated a moment before replying: "Car crash," he said as indifferently as he could. "My father steered the car on the wrong lane. Three people died."
"Wonderful," came the delighted reply from his mistress. Sherlock felt his stomach turn. "I have all the papers ready from our side. If you can–"
"It's not alright," John snapped. Sherlock flinched away from his touch, though John still held his chin. He remained still as John examined his nose and his swollen eye.
John glanced at the floor by the fireplace. All Holmes's possessions seemed to still be there except for the coat. But maybe the violin wasn't important in the least. Maybe he didn't even enjoy playing it.
," he urged. Mycroft would probably have said more, had they not heard John at the door. The arrival of his master had soon sent his brother away.
Sherlock stayed stubbornly silent. Despite how Sherlock had been younger when they were sold, it was Mycroft who had adjusted better. Logically, it should have been Sherlock, and yet he still struggled in all the wrong ways. But it hadn't always been so.
"And make it spotless." John waved him off angrily. The plastic bag with Holmes's pillow and blanket was still on the floor. He kicked it under the bed, out of view. Holmes could sleep another night with his coat and the bag.
"Master, don't—" Sandy pleaded, but Mycroft cut her off. He wasn't about to sugarcoat any of this to Sherlock.
"Explain yourself", he managed to order with relative calm, "and make it good. I might not own a whip, but I have belts."
The words were spoken somewhere far beyond John's dream of gunfire and sand, but a part of his mind registered the word "sir" and every fibre of his being tensed in alarm, ready to act.
He got up quietly, took John's mobile and let himself into the bathroom. He opened a new messaged and typed quickly.
"Oh for– Give it to me." John pushed the lid down and snatched the laptop away from Holmes's reach. When the slave said nothing, he prompted: "Well?"
Surely Holmes wasn't truly that bad, he reasoned, climbing up the stairs. Just mistreated. And misunderstood. His papers labeled him stupid, but he was nothing like that. He had a brilliant mind, he just didn't get to use it productively.
He sighed silently in relief when she stepped away, and gladly sat down when his mistress motioned him to do so.
"I'm happy you came back, Holmes," Lydia murmured and kissed his hair as he swallowed back tears from his punishment. Gradually she allowed him to move more freely. He could go out given he would return and behaved well. The better he behaved the more privileges he gained.
Sherlock nodded in defeat. He still had the coat, his most prized possession after the violin. Perhaps, if he behaved well, John might give him other gloves to use. It wouldn't be the same, but really it should make no difference whether he actually had something like gloves or not.
He skimmed through the Handbook not quite knowing what he was looking for. There was a long chapter dedicated to emancipation, especially to "Ask yourself if your slave will truly benefit from emancipation". John flipped the pages towards the beginning and started from the introduction.
"What?" an irritated, muffled reply came from under the covers. "I haven't been sleeping well. I was on a case, you saw me. It's my legal right to sleep, so fuck off."
John would have loved to hear that two days ago, before he'd made up his mind. He would receive the call anytime now and he'd already decided. John's brow furrowed, wondering what Sarah knew about Holmes to cause her to issue such a warning. He had learnt long ago to trust Sarah's instincts.
Two was highly unlikely. Förstner was a proud man and considered himself slighted by the scientific community, wanted to prove himself and thought he could be close to a breakthrough. He wouldn't give up easily. Sherlock
An hour into their journey, John realized that Sherlock wasn't referencing a map. “Do you have these woods memorized?” John asked, stepping over a large, protruding root.
Sherlock hung up without a word, hyperventilating, afraid that he was dreaming. If John was pronounced dead, there was no logical way he could possibly be alive. He hadn't cared to find out what was in Förstner's syringe. The damage had already been done, what sense would it make to know? He'd killed Förstner; a dead man couldn't be prosecuted.
"Thank God you're here. I didn't know if you were going to show," Molly said, relief causing her shoulders to sag as she walked towards Sherlock. The wails died down to a sniffle as the watery-eyed child observed him curiously.
shadowy past. "Yes, Sherlock, I'm sorry for caring fuck all about you, but I guess I should have known, seeing as you're a selfish cock whose only thought is of himself and "the Work". Perhaps I should leave you to that, hm?"
"The way our kind are being hunted now, I don't reckon why we couldn't just join up and go after those bastards, but it's been every pack for themselves."
John tilted his head, wondering if Jasper was going to be following in his father's footsteps. "So have you give any thought to where you're going to go for Uni?"
He tormented John so beautifully, ramming his prostate until John was on the brink of an orgasm, only to fall short of the mark for the next five thrusts.
“Sherlock, my clothes,” he breathed, pressing his chest up wantonly as Sherlock’s tongue darted out to his peaked nipple. “My cock-”
Sherlock kept firm eye contact as he erased the distance, deciding that it was better to show John what his trust meant to him. Much of this was unfamiliar to him; he’d never strived to make someone feel comfortable or even cared much for their feelings, but Sherlock found that he wanted John to enjoy being with him as himself.
Alfie puffed out a laugh incredulously, rubbing a hand over his aquiline nose as he looked back to his henchman. "'No', he says! Can you believe this arsehole?" Alfie turns back chuckling, but John can see the tick in his jaw that informs him the thug is anything but amused.
He brought his hands up to wrap around the long, graceful neck, bent to devour him with relished fervor.
Sherlock raised his chin, stubbornly refusing to answer. Murray was itching to get to Pirbright, obviously. He hated London, couldn't afford it, and he was tired of routine. He wouldn't be offended by Sherlock's meddling, not that he would have a choice, but he was an honourable man, and he would have questions that Sherlock would rather not answer.
The ride wasn't long and they were well on their way when the houses began to grow less shabby and larger, grand and immaculate. John had only been to the Royal Borough of Kensington a few times in his life, and each time, he was astounded by the old, fancy buildings and the people that screamed 'money'. Sure Sherlock could easily have another flat in Kensington, but for a man whose net worth was well into the realm of millions, Sherlock didn't seem the type to waste money on trinkets and a lavish lifestyle. So what was Sherlock up to, and why had he brought John there?
Well, there went John's “nothing ever happens to me” line he had planned to post on his blog for his therapist to see. The man - Sherlock - was watching him through the screen, and John only just realized how close he’d drawn in order to hear him speak, and was reminded of how handsome he’d thought the man to be before he opened his mouth.
The smell of a soiled nappy bombarded his senses, and John giggled again as Sherlock wrinkled his nose.
Now that Moriarty had returned, Sherlock would be able to reassure himself with valid reasons why John was safer at Baker Street. Not to mention that the last time Moriarty got between them, John ran off for six years and joined the military. Sherlock wouldn’t risk that happening again.
Sherlock's gaze was burning holes into his head, heavy with the fog of a million unknown variables that John couldn't be sure of. What was Sherlock thinking? Did John really want to know what went on behind that iridescent gaze, the inner workings of a madly brilliant mind consumed with want?
“While I appreciate your concern, Victor, it really is none of your business,” Sherlock murmured, peering down at the thriving intersection below.
And then he was gone, and once again it was just John and the dim light hanging from the ceiling, casting everything into shadows.
John crossed the room quickly and wrapped his arms around Sherlock's back, feeling the man tremble in his arms. He wasn't crying, merely trembling, but it had the same effect on John. He held him until the trembling stopped and when he pulled away to look Sherlock in the eyes, they were rimmed red.
Sherlock growled and thrust his cock into John’s grip. “God, how is it possible you’re tighter than you were this afternoon?”
Standing, he had full access to John, the unblemished skin of his back, save for the exit wound, arse on display for Sherlock's pleasure. He was completely vulnerable like this, a slave to Sherlock's whims. Power was the most potent drug and Sherlock was higher than he could remember being in a long time.
There was also the attraction to think of. John wasn't anything special. Plainly speaking, he was an average man; a little shorter than usual, but otherwise, there was nothing spectacular about him. Yet, Sherlock had wanted him so strongly that he'd risked his life to accompany John on a journey that held little benefit for him or his pack.
A knock at the door severed the moment, and John nearly gasped in relief as the tension released from his shoulders. The lady from before strode into the room carrying a platinum tray with two steaming cups of tea and an array of digestives. "Ah, thank you, Janine."
John made it to his room, intent on going in alone, at least for a moment of peace. Miss Vicky frowned at him, her tall form leaning over him as she used the full force of her formidable glare to pin him in place.
Back inside, the house seemed oppressive without the usual noise to liven it up. It was empty and quiet, a replica of what it must have been before.
John looked away, shuffling awkwardly with the bag of clothes in his hands. "A week," he muttered, "regardless if I choose the RAMC or not."
John didn't respond, though he rose on his toes and planted a light kiss on Sherlock's lips. It was soft and sweet, and everything he wished their short time together could have been.
John arched, wrapping his fingers around his throbbing cock, unable to say a thing as Sherlock began to dissect him with just his words.
These definitions are all simplified, so as to avoid wrong information. If you want to know more about the MHRA and the MRC, I recommend a quick Google search.
A little beep filled the tense silence, emitting from the expensive Cartier watch fastened to the man's wrist. Holmes uncrossed his legs, looking for all the world as if he were disappointed. "My apologies, Mr Watson, but I'm afraid I must cut our meeting short. However, I do have a proposition for you."
When the door to 221C closed, it was the beginning of a new phase of their burgeoning whatever-it-could-be-called. Sherlock had crowded John, backed him up until there was nowhere to go. Between the man before him and the wall behind him, both were immovable and John felt his pulse ratchet up to a dangerously rapid pace.
Lestrade sighed loudly from where he stood, flanking Sherlock like an SIS agent, on the verge of baring his teeth. "That's enough out of the lot of you. Sherlock says John stays, and that's what's going to happen, understood?
The woman held a cup in one hand, that John prayed was mercifully full of water, and a torch in the other. She watched the captive with suspicion, chin slightly tilted upwards as the other man stepped forward to place the food at John's feet before turning and retrieving the cup from his companion, which was also placed next to the bowl.
John winced, hoping Sherlock could hear, so he wouldn't have to relay the message in those words, exactly. Thankfully, Sherlock had ears like an owl. "Tell him I prefer to text, which he knows by now, I'm sure. Lestrade does so love to make my life difficult."
Of course, that was inaccurate. It had been three minutes, during which, like any man of war, John was assessing his opponent. The thought of finally,
It was a completely innocent statement, but that didn't stop John from feeling the slightest of shivers whisper down his spine. It seemed that everything Holmes said had a double meaning. John spent all of the two weeks up until that day attempting to work out if the man was trying to tell him something, but in the end, he couldn’t decipher what.
The instant that he thought it, John felt an inexplicable surge of jealousy that Sherlock had done this for someone else before. How many drunken men had he brought back to flat to sober up, allow them to sleep in his bed? It brought John back to his original purpose, which was to get up and go home. He'd imposed enough for one night.
John swallowed, because now Sherlock was staring at him in that keen, observatory way that John understood was Sherlock crawling into his brain and picking out his thoughts.
The woman flashed him a beatific smile, genuine, unlike the lady before her. "Welcome to Holmes Pharmaceuticals. How can I assist you?"
His eyes were focused on nothing, turned inwardly instead, to his mind palace. It was empty and cavernous save for the grand staircase. All the doors were closed off to him, except for one. It was a bedroom, but neither from 221B nor 221C.
“John,” Sherlock tried again, though his voice was quieter than before, reluctant. The tips of his finger brushed John's shoulder and he cringed away as if burned.
John remembered the unabashed hunger in Holmes's eyes; it had fueled his own desire. He would be lying if he said that a part of him wasn't thrilled at this turn of events, but he was just as unsettled about the mysterious proposition. Did he really want to be tied up with a selfish, arrogant millionaire, who may or may not have hired him for sex?
He missed the feel of a hard body against his own, John's calloused hands warming trails up his back, lips at his neck.
John nodded, going to wrap his arms round the butterfly wings flapping away in his belly, but then thought better of it when he remembered his injuries. His stomach was probably all bruised up, and he hoped that whatever client he serviced that night would not take offense.
He reached for John’s erection and wrapped his hand around it, staring into John’s hooded gaze with a challenge in his own. How much longer could he last?
Sherlock collapsed back onto the couch, breathless as John began to move on him, a slow, dangerous grind that John noticed made his toes curl into the cushions and his fingers drag stinging welts down John’s thighs. Along with the arousal was the smug satisfaction that he could reduce this arrogant, otherworldly creature to a shivering mess and he hadn’t even got started properly. His thoughts must have shown on his face, because Sherlock’s eyes, which were wide and waxen before, narrowed into metallic slits. The next moment, he was pounding up into John’s body, two handfuls of John’s arse gripped in his palm as he forced John to ride him fast and hard.
Sherlock held out a hand to him, and John could do nothing but stare at it, something in the offer felt contractual. If he took that hand, John knew he would be making a deal with the devil. Was that what he wanted? A man like Sherlock could bring bliss or terror, so could John risk the latter for a taste of the former?
He stripped down to his pants and vest and returned the suit and shoes to hang in Sherlock's closet. John climbed in on the side of the bed that Sherlock's long limbs weren't occupying and pulled the cover up to his chest, crossing his arms over his sternum as he blinked up at the ceiling.
Jasper nodded and Sherlock retreated to the kitchen to start the kettle. While he waited, Jasper settled in the seat across from his father’s favored chair and checked his phone. Once he’d finally turned it on a few days before, he received all of the text messages John sent him, each one more alarmed as time went by without a response. Eventually they stopped, and now Jasper couldn't stop thumbing through them. In the tube, he read back on months and months of text, just banter and a bit of flirting. Now, there was nothing but the static silence, and the occasional text he’d receive from his dad during his stay at Mycroft’s.
“God, yes,” John hissed, his fingernails scratching down Sherlock’s shirtless back. “Please.” He needed to come so badly, needed to see Sherlock come and those pretty eyes flutter shut in ecstasy.
In the end, Murray had been taken away directly for surgery, and he lived, but he would never fight again. Murray was invalided back to England. John thought about the hopeless look in Murray's eyes and realized that he didn't want to be relegated to that same fate. John had to resign himself to the logic that it was either his life or the insurgent's, and when he looked at it from that angle, John couldn't castigate himself for doing what he had to.
Sherlock barked out a guttural snarl and John leant forward, resting his elbows on his knees as he regarded the man indifferently. “You've got more immediate problems, mate,” he urged, tilting his head towards the giant wolf crouched over the both of them. “You can talk, or…” John glanced at Sherlock, who licked his chops menacingly, then back at the young human. “You can die.”
"'Ellllooo? Is this my little Johnny boy?" John hated when she got like this; hated her and her inability to cope and forget and stay away.
Jasper snickered around the white stick between his lips. Holding it between middle and index finger, he pulled it away to speak. "Perhaps, perhaps not."
The moment that acute stare fell on her, Julia was aware of every inch of height difference and the way the stranger wore affluence like a second skin. She hated the searing quality of his gaze, how it made her feel like a frog pinioned to a dissecting pan. There was something about him that instantly alarmed her, though she couldn’t say if it was his forbidding disposition or that Julia wouldn’t be remiss in concluding that somehow he knew all her secrets without her saying a word.
John waited for the cars to clear before he jogged to the other side of the street, immediately spotting Holmes through the windows. The man stuck out like a sore thumb, dressed this time in a deep purple button down tucked into perfectly pressed, black trousers. His fitted suit jacket and coat were folded painstakingly over the back of the booth. Holmes tapped away on his mobile screen, seemingly oblivious to everything around him.
John nearly lost his struggle to stay standing on weak knees when Sherlock's tongue darted out to lick the sheen of pre-ejaculate on the tip of his cock. "Or I could make you come now," Sherlock hummed, moving his transfixed gaze from John's pearly erection and up to meet liquid cobalt eyes. Sherlock smiled tightly, his jaw tensed in restraint. "Though that would come with a heavy price. Are you willing to risk it, John, willing to be at my mercy for however long I wish you to be? Delayed gratification or instant satisfaction?"
In the corner of his vision, John could see Sherlock's tense form visibly relax as his attention returned back to the microscope, but his hand on the table stayed curled into a tight fist, belying his tumultuous thoughts.
Sherlock's voice was harsh with annoyance at he replied to the man in short clipped tones. "I don't need you to '
Upstairs, Mrs Hudson wrapped a quilt around his supine body on the couch, and Sherlock closed his eyes and allowed himself to implode (finally).
Obviously the woman loved to hear her own voice, the way she nattered on, but John found himself hoping she would give up some hint as to her connection with Sherlock. "I hadn't realized he was expecting anyone. Would you like me to call him?" John kept his tone light and amiable, though the thought of seeing her with Sherlock again left a bad taste in his mouth.
“Yes, at least give me that,” a new voice cut in. Mycroft only sighed at his brother’s tendency towards theatrics. Now that he was so close, Mycroft could observe his brother better.
Though the musk of Molly’s juices lingered on his cock, Holmes didn’t hesitate to snuggle up between John’s legs and swallow him down until he touched the back of Holmes’ undulating throat.
Fuck, John felt hot all over, feverish, and Sherlock's hands on his body, stroking him, were the only thing he could get his mind to focus on. Nobody had ever taken such mastery over his body this way.
you?" Sherlock was standing near, John could feel his body heat in waves, washing over him along with the dulcet fragrance of his aftershave, and the stale scent of cigarettes.
Sherlock's eyes were a nearly translucent mix of blue-green-grey and as conflicted as John had ever seen them. Not for the first time that night, he wished he could hear what Sherlock was thinking but even following their shared exploration, he could see there was a part of him that Sherlock was not sharing. John may never get that part but that didn't mean he wasn't curious to know. Sherlock clearly had no idea what he was doing and everything concerning sentiment from that point forward would be that much more difficult, because a confused Sherlock Holmes was not a satisfied one.
John squeezed his eyes shut, and pulled the cover over his head, feeling bad for whatever sorry sod was on the receiving end of Sherlock's scathing diatribe. He snuggled back into the bed, happy to be out of those particular crosshairs.
More of those footsteps, until the sound cut off abruptly beside John. “No, but he might have an inkling as to
Mrs Hudson was ambling back into the room shortly thereafter, her aged fingers folded tightly around a key. “That poor boy,” she said, shaking her head lightly, “he has his bad days, dear.” The soft, reminiscent undertone laced with notes of melancholia was oddly jolting to John. How long had Mrs Hudson known Sherlock, and what had she witnessed to make her frown that way? It struck John then, how little he really know about Sherlock. How could he be in so deep and know so very little about that person? Was he falling for Sherlock, the man, or what he represented, or rather, what John
They weren't ten minutes into the trip home when John's father turned to regard him with a wide smile. "Well, my boy, are you going to tell me what's bothering you, or are you going to continue sulking in silence?"
Jim had been his very first submissive, whom he’d met through Irene. By that time, Holmes Pharmaceuticals had been going strong for two years and Sherlock felt comfortable enough in his work to also pursue his darker indulgences on the side.
John couldn't fight the jerk of his hips into Sherlock's fist, as Sherlock's lips swallowed his cries, consuming him.
God, did the woman ever leave anything be? John groaned in mental agony of the inquisition to come. So much for that hot cuppa he'd been looking forward to. Sighing, John ran a hand over his face in aggravation, while Sarah sat patiently with the air of a woman that had all day to wait.
The ride had been a quiet one, save for the rumble of John's complaining belly. One would usually find those things amusing, but Holmes' penetrating gaze was only dark and pensive. John didn't look back, but he could see Holmes in the reflection of the window, tapping away on his phone, though pausing intermittently to spare John a glance.
Sherlock appeared much the same, save for a few new wrinkles around the eyes. The bespoke suit was there, the ridiculous coat, and God, his piercing eyes peeking from behind that fringe was just as John remembered. John thought that he would never see him again. His heart swelled and swelled, and John fought the urge to look back at Jasper and ask him why, why would he reunite them? What cruel joke was Jasper playing? Did he mean it? But John couldn't bring himself to willfully see anything but the mirage before him.
“And what would you like me to do about it?” Sherlock enquired softly, hands steepling beneath his chin.
"Come," the man inside snapped. Confusion clouded John's thoughts for a moment, before he realized Holmes was referring to the pair of them standing outside his door.
Sherlock couldn't open his mouth to speak. Whether by his own hand or Förstner's, he was the one that put John's body there. Sherlock's imbecilic miscalculations. Why didn't he
"Oh, no, no no, John, I'm not letting you pass this up because you're being paranoid." Mike was certainly pressing the issue harder than John had expected. He thought he would have an ally in his indecision, but Mike was firmly seated in opposition.
John had to remind himself that he was doing this for Sherlock, for the Work, Sherlock's reputation,
John glanced down self-consciously at the mulberry cotton jumper his sister gifted to him on his last birthday, and the only pair of dark trousers he owned, before storming in after Holmes, chin raised in defiance. "I'll have you know there is nothing wrong with my clothing, and it's
“Come, then,” he said, smiling hopefully down at the younger man. “Let’s make your last night in London a memorable one.”
“I should get going, then,” John sighed, his skin prickling as Sherlock’s eyes scanned him. He didn’t have to look to know that Sherlock was reading every little change in his body language. John knew that Sherlock had caught on to his evasiveness, but the man didn’t seem intent on calling him out on it. Instead, he moved silently to his wardrobe and pulled out a pair of sweats.
John was so thin in her arms, a waif compared to the healthy young man she last saw. His back trembled beneath her hands and the realisation came slamming into her that she’d been given the chance to hold her baby close again rather than the devastating alternative of standing over a casket.
A supple, stockinged leg appeared from offstage, leading up to a garter-lined thigh. Then, Lady Grey was spinning from behind the wall, until her back was pressed against it. One finger trailed from her pretty maroon lips to trail down her neck as the woman on the record moaned erotically. She melted down with the movement, her thighs spreading as her arse nearly touched the ground.
Jim pulled back and smiled maliciously. “It's been fun, friends, but I really must be going. Toodaloo,” he said with a wiggle of his fingers before turning and walking back through the crowd.
Taking one last calming breath, Sherlock edged closer to the door, until he was standing just out of view of the opening. One last look at his partner and John came round and swung in first, gun held out in front of him and Sherlock just behind him.
“John,” Sherlock spoke. The name came out tight and guttural, sharp as barbed wire as it left his throat. There was definitely anger there, but he hadn’t been expecting the relief. It washed over him like rain after an endless drought, and Sherlock couldn’t contain the breath of wonder that swept past his lips.
Sherlock turned piercing pale eyes upon him, and John immediately found himself feeling unworthy to be in the same space as this man. He was like a planet all on his own, complete with his own gravitational pull. "I sent him to stay with my brother for a few days."
Sherlock scoffed, huffing into John’s hair. “We both know that wasn’t the reason I asked you to dinner, John. Not even you could be that oblivious.”
John grinned, feeling his heart swell in his chest. This is not the man he had heard such awful things about; where was all the vitriol and filth he liked to dole out to anyone he came into contact with? "So, you don't make it a habit of sleeping with all of your son's friends?" John had been ribbing him of course, but he was curious to know.
John whimpered out a sigh and turned his head away from the bottle, leaving a translucent ribbon of milk and saliva to trail down his chin. He smacked his lips and turned to stare at Sherlock expectantly.
Her lips parted with the words, gleaming white teeth flashing as she enunciated the lyrics of her song.
John crossed the room slowly, cautious and just as clueless as Sherlock was. "Hey, easy, Sherlock. It's not like you knew this was going to happen." John reached out then, to pull Sherlock's hands away from his hair, and Sherlock gasped.
With minimal effort, the zip came down, down, down, and then it fell away to reveal a waxed chest and erect, rosebud nipples. The sight of them made Sherlock’s throat constrict. He swallowed and tore his eyes away from John’s chest to take in the rest of his smooth torso. Unconsciously, his tongue darted out to wet his lips as his eyes passed over the dip of John’s bellybutton. Highly erotic fantasies played out in his mind, of pressing John down on his back and delving his tongue inside every crack and crevice of his body.
Of course Sherlock knew about the tabloids the minute they were published, but that hadn't made it any less infuriating. Long ago Sherlock learned how easily the press could turn on you, as fickle as it was, and Sherlock had been a foreigner, barely touching toe to new land. The media caught wind of his tendency to dabble in drugs, and the journalists set out for him like carnivores to fresh meat.
Sherlock growled, unfolding his arms, only to stand and ruffle his hair harshly with his hands in frustration as he began to pace back and forth in a dizzying pattern. “John, I'm
Fortunately, it was warm inside, so John removed his jacket and placed it over his arm, feeling the cold air filter right through the thin fabric. The interior was dim and cozy, and soft music played over the speaker, lending the room a romantic atmosphere. The waiter greeted Sherlock by name and led them to a well worn booth in the corner next to a large window. Sherlock sat facing the front door, and John slid into the bench across from him, settling snugly into the worn dip in the middle of the leather seat.
"Lestrade," Sherlock snapped brusquely, keeping his gaze trained on John as he snapped out his orders. "You will get the pack safely to Mycroft's estate in Sussex. John and I will meet you there within the next week." Sherlock broke the stare, turning to his second-in-command. "If we fail to arrive by Thursday next, notify Mycroft. He will know what to do."
Standing further out in the open field, John could see two silhouettes, accompanied by the tangerine glow of burning cigarettes.
John exhaled slowly at this, unsettled. He knew the man could be cold and callous, but hearing him as he was in that instance, John knew Holmes was the fire people were often warned to steer clear of. He was the man Sarah had urged him to be careful of, the one journalists were salivating to get an interview with.
"I'm at this pub... The Watch House, I think," John admitted, twisting his head around to peer up at the large, curving letters on the sign. "Better hurry. I think I'm about to be very acquainted with the pavement. We've met before, you see. He's not a very good friend, though."
Up ahead, the foliage began to thin, and John could see the beginnings of his den come into view, a shabby, crumbling shack that had once become home for John. They’d not thought much of aesthetics while seeking a den to settle in, and the inside was habitable. The shack was obscure and out of the way, a perfect hideaway and untraceable unless one knew where to look. Apparently they hadn't been as conspicuous as John first thought. Still, for years it had been a perfect den to seek a haven in and suited the needs of the pack.
Sherlock crossed his arms and brought a finger to his lips, stuttering taps over the plush flesh beneath as he paced the room with distant eyes. "It's obviously got to do with me, seeing as you sought to spare my "
John inhaled deeply, his hands beginning to sweat where they gripped the chain attached to his cuffs as much for courage as they did leverage. "Feel free to make as much noise as you'd like. Mrs Hudson is away for the rest of the evening."
John was panting loudly into the room, squirming against those curious finger, desperate to rut and find release. It was a thrill like no other, being held at the edge, but unable to find relief. Sherlock was teasing him, seeing how far he could push John before he was driven to madness. His release was right there, so close that John could taste it. Everything else was static, besides the sound of Sherlock's voice and John's heartbeat ringing loudly in his own ears.
"Your arse was red from the caning I'd given you. Beautiful welts to compliment an equally Beautiful arse.” A pause. “Has anyone ever told you how lovely you look when you're naked?" Sherlock leaned down, though he didn't have to go far. John's body was raised high enough that his arse was level with Sherlock's ribs. He licked a clean line up the underside of John's cock, and then down again where he placed his lips around his balls. Sherlock suckled lightly on one and then the other, pulling off with an filthy smack.
John cleared his throat, still standing by the door awkwardly. "So I'm guessing Jasper won't be back for a while if he's not here already."
It was at the café mere minutes from his building, when Sherlock realized he might possibly have to renege on the boundaries of what he would and wouldn't do where taking a bed partner were concerned. He'd agreed to meet with Irene for lunch and inadvertently chosen the same locale as John and his...
“Come on, John, lift your hips! Fuck me,” he growled, pulling John up by the rope on his wrists and bracketing John's hips with his feet, while the hand on the headboard came to tangle in John's unruly strands. Sherlock had to release the rope in order to balance himself with one hand behind him. John's hands were tied, but Sherlock was in his lap and fucking his cock with more vigour than John could keep up with. John bent his legs to accommodate the new position and attempted to match Sherlock's pace.
During this, John could see Sherlock soften just the slightest. His body language was still tense, but frosty eyes lost some of their hard edge. John wished he knew what happened, to make a man like Sherlock give in to Lestrade's appeal. Whatever Lestrade had come from, it had to have been worse than anything John had been through before the hunters came.
Sherlock could feel himself going into a frenzy. The fact that he'd been able to stay coherent this long was a miracle, but now he was ready to give in to the Heat.
Instead of answering, the wolf issued a low rumble. Non-threatening, but nonetheless a warning to make no more enquiries on the subject.
“Aren't you two fucking cute,” he said dryly, without any real discontent. After a year of living with those two, Greg was used to John and Sherlock's unusual friendship, if that's what it could be called. They denied any sort of relationship, yet the pair of them touched more than any friends Greg had ever known. It didn't extend to him, but in a way, it was lovely to watch them together. Greg couldn't deny he indulged in a fantasy or two about them on the lonely nights when he was horny and couldn’t sleep.
Lestrade allowed the younger man to walk in pensive silence for the duration of their short journey, for which John was infinitely grateful, and a short while later, the pair of them had finished struggling and made it to a nondescript door at the top of the stairs.  He turned to the grey-haired man imploringly, and  Lestrade paused with a hand on the door, eyebrows furrowed in curiosity.
Sherlock slowly placed the kettle back on the tray and avoided Victor’s gaze as he reclaimed his chair. “What are you implying, Victor? You know I don’t like riddles.”
"Answer me, John, does he know we'd spilled our come over the kitchen lino?" Sherlock's voice was rough with ardour, and John was so thoroughly distracted by it, the sound of Sherlock unraveling. It was thinking of John that made him like that.
Mycroft, trying to lighten his load on the stairs. The ancient wood was practically screaming beneath his weight.
"I'm sorry you had to go through this, but... John, do you think this thing with Holmes is worth the scrutiny of the press?"
"You're so obedient; I could do so much with you, to you. Would you let me, John? Allow me to sodomize you, push you down on your belly and fuck you?"
John was an active child, happy and always looking for a distraction. Sherlock knew the feeling and wondered if John had often been as exhausted from attempting to entertain Sherlock.
John froze, a bit surprised that Sherlock would offer. Though they’d had sex twice now, they still hardly knew one another. It was tempting to say yes, but John was stopped by the thought that if things didn’t work out between them, it would be awkward. Yet, he couldn’t quite bring himself to decline.
If that was all, then Sherlock would make sure he dedicated every bit of it towards John’s pleasure tonight.
Unbidden, the image of large hands splayed over his waist, holding him fast, and bow-shaped lips came to his mind, forcing the smile to morph into something like sympathy for Mike. He wasn't Sherlock's, but he mine as well be, for all the time he spent thinking of the man.
Sherlock leaned down and kissed his lips softly, breaking character for a moment to give him reassurance. “You'll do fine,” he assured John, and kissed him again one more time for good measure. Then, Sherlock grabbed the lube off the bed and pressed it into the palm of John's hand. “Squeeze a bit onto your fingers. It's been awhile since I've done this, so you'll have to start with one.”
When John flinched away and made to back towards the door, Sherlock exhaled sharply at the sensation that the cold pane of glass inspired across his skin. "Not you, John. You stay. Billy, go home and don't come back until I call for you."
Just as John thought that Sherlock might let him come, the man rose up to kneel between his legs, holding the soft backs of John’s knees as his hips canted forward. His rigid cock pressed hard and long against the slick crack of John’s arse, and from beneath lowered lids, grey eyes smouldered under a fringe of thick, dark lashes.
The man was admirably elusive. There weren't many pictures of him. Just a few taken from behind, or shielded by plainclothesmen escorting him to and from awaiting vehicles. Oddly enough, only a few of them managed to capture a glimpse of Holmes' face.
John reached out a hand, waiting for Sherlock to grab hold of it. Sherlock scanned him for any falsehoods, hesitantly moving forward, eyes flicking from John's face, to his hand, and back again.
At the door, Sherlock turned one last time and ordered John to rest before sweeping out of the flat and down the stairs.
Down below, his cock was swelling with blood, and John prayed this moment would be over soon, for the sake of his anatomy, and he'd also like to leave with some of his dignity, please and thank you very much.
The land John's pack occupied at the time hadn't even been ideal.  The soil was too saturated to build a stable den upon, the stream, too far, and the deer migrated in the opposite direction. But the pack skulking just along the edge of their land were the type to slaughter for the pleasure of it. They were bored, and those packs were always the worst.
“Jasper,” he said sharply, turning his hard eyes to the young man who had enough sense to look ashamed. “Sherlock is your father and you had better start acting like it. Yes, his mistake was ill-conceived,” he stated, glaring at Sherlock momentarily, who stared determinedly ahead. “But he is your elder and my brother, and you will respect him, do you understand?”
"Goodness John," Sherlock said as John plopped happily down back onto the bed, standing up to fetch the baby bag from the cupboard. "I might have to repeat the analysis on the contents of Enfamil. I'm not certain the smell emanating from your nappy is natu-"
"I-," she began nervously, eyes flicking to her feet and back to John cautiously, "I just wanted to say I'm sorry about your-- about what happened to your pack. I can't imagine how-," she broke off, lifting the fingers of one hand to her lips.
He didn’t bother with knocking on the door, instead, letting himself into the loo, steam billowing out as he stepped in.
"Now let's get inside before the food runs cold. I made all your favorites, and I'm just finishing up the banoffee pie. Come on, up you get." His mother urged John up the stairs, his father a step behind, smiling contentedly at it all.
John wrapped an arm around the taller man's neck, the other holding on to Sherlock's bicep. "I think I have a bit of an idea," John gasped into his lover's mouth. His fingers ran through those soft dark curls, pulling the detective's lips down to his own, into something more gentle and intimate.
John felt his lip twitch, unable to conceal his pleasure at the fact that the boy he liked felt as if John was the only one who he could connect with. He looked up, feeling eyes on him, and found himself drawn into the hypnotizing stare of the older Holmes. The man looked bemused, as if there was something he couldn't puzzle out. John thought it may be along the lines of, what would his son want with a
It was more than he'd expected, and if John were honest with himself, less than he'd deserved. It was short and cutting, and callous. Sherlock was going straight for the jugular, and his aim had been precise. Could he expect any less from a man like Holmes?
For a moment, he just breathed, slumped over John’s panting back, until, “Er, Sherlock, you’ve got to get off.”
Once they reached Sherlock's bedroom, John hesitated at the threshold. He'd never actually been in Sherlock's room before, only seen what he could from the angle of his own bedroom, but John respected Sherlock enough not to go snooping when the Alpha wasn't around, though he'd been tempted to.
This time around, the air is charged with the excitement of the hunt; it fuels every stride they take, and the smell of fury and anticipation taints every inhalation. God, John
His last shoot with Kitty Riley had been trying. Her lunch included asparagus and John could hardly keep himself from gagging as he went down on her. Not to mention, her dirty talk needed improvement. John hadn’t been sure if he was fucking Kitty or Voldemort half the time.
Holmes sauntered over after a short, clipped conversation with the director. John stood, heat pooling in his groin the moment that shrewd gaze fell upon him. Holmes’ eyes dipped down, mouth pulled into a semi-smirk that magnified his plump lips as he took a long, contemplative survey of John from the ashen strands of his hair to the worn bottom of his trainers.
Holmes' sharp eyes cut to John, expression unintelligible, before sliding back to Janine. "If that is all, Janine, you are free to go."
Sherlock tapped out a hurried response to John and tucked his phone away in his coat pocket. “Ah, Molly,” he said, accepting the warm styrofoam cup she held out with a nod. “Yes, now actually. Did you need something?”
Sherlock drew back to flick his tongue over John’s arsehole before he delved back in to drop a suckling kiss onto it. He was desperate to hear his sounds, collecting whimpers to hoard away in his mind palace when he couldn’t have the real thing.
“Another,” Sherlock growled, leaning forward with his hands planted on either side of John's head. He was nearly riding John's fingers and John was hard enough to hurt, watching the display. John obliged and added another finger, captivated by the snug warmth of Sherlock's arse surrounding him. The man himself was nearly nose to nose with John, his eyes wide open and filmed over with ravenous greed. John aimed for his prostate and flushed with pride when Sherlock's engorged cock brushed John's belly with the strength of his arch. “Take it- take it out.”
Sherlock leaned forward, hunching over until he was nose to nose with John, darting forward for a near violent clash of lips. It didn't last long, and Sherlock was talking against his panting mouth the next moment.
As John, this would all be highly inappropriate and borderline insane, but as Lady Grey, the vixen-in-red, the well-versed lover, it was right up her alley and he didn’t want to let this go. What if Sherlock thought that he was boring compared to her? What if John wiped away the make-up and Sherlock was disappointed with what he saw? Though John loved his Lady Grey persona, sometimes he loathed how long of a shadow she cast.
It had been impossible not to notice the way Sherlock stared as he danced on the stage. John might even have done some of the moves just to see that eyebrow inch up a little further. The man could watch him all night and John wouldn’t have a problem with it, so long as it ended with Sherlock in his bed.
“Oh, fuck offff,” Greg groaned, turning to pull the pillow over his head, but another muffled noise stopped him. Hell, it sounded like…
Sherlock scoffed at the blatant disregard for his higher intellect. Of course John wasn’t fine, the imbecile!
John’s sudden orgasm took them both by surprise as he tensed up, spilling warmth over Sherlock’s fingers and squeezing down on his dick until Sherlock’s eyes rolled back, mouth slack.
John smiled, wishing he had told her what time he would be going. The wharf wasn't exactly a skip away from Lewisham, especially during noontime.
Rubbing the gound from his eyes, John sat up, though the motion only increased the assault on his equilibrium. When everything was no longer fuzzy, John peered around the room, hoping he hadn't been drunkenly stumbling around London and wound up kidnapped by some mad person. It was bad enough he was having such trouble getting his eyes to adjust to the dark; his surroundings were shrouded in dusky shadows, unfamiliar, and he struggled against uncertain memories to dredge up some sort of explanation about his current whereabouts.
Sherlock rolled his eyes in exasperation. “I prefer to run, thanks. As ever, you rely too much on human creations, when they make new gadgets every day to rid the world of us.”
"Your vocabulary truly is atrocious, John, you need better influences," Sherlock sniffed, standing up and straightening out his suit jacket haughtily. "And this flat is frankly quite frightening." John couldn't disagree with that. Sherlock seemed larger than life in the tiny flat, like an expensive trinket amid cheap jewels. John lowered the plate with an annoyed huff, avoiding looking at Sherlock's brogues, which he was certain ran for several hundred quid, dark and polished against his tea-stained carpet.
The rest of the ride went by in a tense silence until the driver pulled the car up to the kerb at Tesco. Sherlock was first out, and then John until they were both stood awkwardly just to the side of the market doors, locked in a stubborn stalemate.
Really, these were grown men, bantering back and forth like children, yet John really had no room to speak after that morning's happenings. Again, he placed his hand over the receiver, and turned to Lestrade. "He says he prefers to text."
There was a wall, six years thick, built upon with mortar made from their mistakes, and strong enough to fortify the distance between them. But since when did Sherlock ever pay mind to boundaries?
A small, dainty hand came to surround his own, squeezing, until the trembling abated. It was Molly, with her large, doe eyes, a glimpse of a haunted past reflecting back at him. "It's okay, John," she whispered softly, though he was sure the rest were listening. "It's okay to be sad."
Sherlock put his hands up, unable to tear his eyes away from John. This was a situation they could handle. Not the first time John had been used for leverage against Sherlock, yet even after the debacle with Moriarty and Magnussen, Sherlock found that the effects of seeing John in the hostage position hadn't lessened over the years.
“Sherlock,” John spoke calmly, but it didn't mean anything, not when Mycroft was meddling and Sherlock only had a few short hours with John. “Sherlock.”
All was quiet and uneventful during John's first half hour, post-Janine. Before she left, Janine had cut half the lights in the foyer, informing John that he could still take calls, but no one had any reason to come up to the floor. So John sat quietly in the dim light, tapping his fingers on gleaming marble absent-mindedly. He thought about ringing Sarah, but decided against it. They'd parted amicably as they always did, but John could tell that his friend had grown uncomfortable under Holmes's indiscreet surveillance.
"Brother," Mycroft greeted lightly, stepping carefully over John as the toddler reached for his shined brogues with slobbery fingers. "Always nice to see your pleasant face. Fatherhood is treating you well, I hope?"
One could say he was addicted to sex, but that would imply that it was a harmful habit which could be broken. Indeed, the contrary was true. The urgency to feel another body against his, to dominate and seize gratification, was innate and not exactly the worst attribute to have. There were far worse things to gravitate to, and sex was the lesser of Sherlock's evils.
Jim shrugged, effecting an innocent facade as he stuffed his hands in his pockets and backed away. Sherlock's eyes were pale slits, more furious than John had ever seen him.
Harry: the name everyone was almost afraid to say. When John was barely out of secondary, she'd already been hooked on a dangerous amalgam of drugs and alcohol. No one knew where she went, and Harry never bothered to call and soothe their worries. John wasn't sure if he hated her for it, or if he was grateful that his parents didn't have to be privy to her reckless lifestyle.
"Sherlock, my name is Sherlock," Holmes whispered into his ear, as if John was voicing his thoughts into the air, "I want to hear you screaming it, later."
Before long, he was stepping out of the shower and towelling off his hair with one hand and texting John with the other. The messages were coming in slower now than they’d been before. It was obvious that John didn’t text often and it was Sherlock’s preferable means of communication, but he found he liked John’s presence and the sound of his voice more than simple words on a screen.
a drama queen, and Mike," John swung around to where his friend's eyes were just snapping back up, a flush of embarrassed horror creeping up at the sight of Sherlock's genitals flapping about. The wanker hadn't even bothered to wear clothes. "Give us a mo' and then you can ask Sherlock all the questions you want."
"Jesus Christ on a sodding cracker! Sherlock Holmes, you utter wanker, what the hell are you doing?!" John could feel his chest heaving in anger and adrenaline, nearly startled out of his mind as the prick just raised an eyebrow in vague amusement.
From above, Sherlock was staring intently, the muscles his thighs, bunched and tight. Those long, violinist fingers were curled where they sat on the arms of the chair, nails pressing dents into the leather.
Mike grinned, his relief obvious, and John felt the slightest bit like an arse for being rude to his friend who he hadn't seen much of in the past week. "I thought maybe you went to the pub and brought back a wild one," Mike chuckled, though John was now intensely aware of Sherlock's keen hearing and his thoughts on John with anyone else.
Sherlock lead them to a door with ornate numbering, a golden border of vines and filigree surrounding the numbers 319. Sherlock grabbed the heavy brass knocker and dropped it three times against the door.
However, it all made sense the moment Holmes flounced into the room, paying no mind to the film crew as wickedly long, pale fingers flew over the illuminated surface of his iPhone.
He should just turn and walk out, tell Mike he couldn't do it, say no to him for once. His friend would probably be angry for a little while, but John didn't belong here. He didn't know what he was doing. This was a mad idea-
John's breath stuttered in his chest as Sherlock pulled him deeper and deeper. It felt like drowning, like sinking but the only thing keeping John afloat was Sherlock's eyes locked onto his, the lighthouse in the distance. Sherlock pulled on the rope and John's back arched under the onslaught of sensation.
Sherlock felt his nails biting into his palms as he clenched them, listening to the satisfactory pop of his knuckles.
everything in those seconds of pain and a pleasure so intense his eyes were watering.  His arms were burning from the strain and John had never thought himself quite flexible enough to be spread in such a way, but he'd be damned if Sherlock stopped now.
Murray clicked off his phone and sat back, crossing his arms over his chest. With a tilt of his chin, he indicated for Sherlock to continue.
John’s eyes softened, regarding him solemnly. With a breath, his shoulders drooped, and he relaxed into Sherlock’s hands. “I’ll make a terrible flatmate,” he grumbled. “I… I frequently have nightmares.”
John narrowed his eyes and clenched his muscles around Sherlock’s cock, until the man beneath him growled in pleasure. “You
, it read, and directly beneath it, Sherlock Holmes, stood out in bright, bold letters. John gasped, his heart skipping a beat, and quickly slid a finger across the screen to pull up the message.
She stepped into the room like she owned it, and immediately, John felt as though he were the one trespassing. The woman's keen, green eyes were scanning the room with a sharp, knowing gaze.
Sherlock smiled and stepped closer, a few paces away, now, but near enough for John to reach out and touch. He didn't.
“Alright?” Sherlock asked him, pressed up against his side in the backseat of the hired car taking them to a cottage in the countryside where they would be filming. His lips were still a bit swollen from the hour before, when he’d sucked John’s cock in the kitchen after a bout of eye-fucking over the breakfast table. The man really was insatiable.
John took deep, calming breaths, struggling to soothe his waking arousal and put his mind to the task at hand. If he was going to be stuck in the office with this man for the better part of the day, John couldn't get aroused every time Holmes crossed his mind.
Sherlock had one large hand wrapped around John's back, curling up to support his neck while the other struggled with the pram.
Irene had made John the headliner for the opening night, and although his stomach clenched with nerves, he was excited for what would undoubtedly be a new venture in a new place. Now, if only things would go swimmingly for the night. The two of them did have the worst of luck with opening night. One memorable opening involved a broken ankle and a fire in the kitchen.
John stopped next to Sherlock and his breaths began to grow shallow, his mouth parting to allow great gulps of air to filter through. Now that he was finally there, John felt out of his depth, uncertain what to do next. He knew where to find a shovel, where to find the bodies, but where did he begin?
“That won’t be necessary. A vehicle will be there within the next two hours.” Message delivered, the line went dead with a muted click.
. He slid his large hands up John's cheekbones and into his hair, creating a soft cradle for his head as he sealed their lips.
Thank you all for the support you're showing me! I hope you enjoy this new chapter. Thanks once again to my betas
"We have a situation, Mrs. Hudson. Keep the food warm. We'll be back soon," Sherlock clipped shortly, with barely restrained ire.
Hello all! Thank you once again for joining as we creep closer to the end. Thanks to my wonderful beta
Sherlock was well aware of John’s lazy stare as he dressed but avoided returning it. There was little else that could tear him apart the way those deceptively guileless blue eyes could, render him useless until he had every bit of John and John had every bit of him.
John rolled his eyes, chuckling. “Yes, you berk, come on.” He grabbed Sherlock’s hand unthinkingly, and pulled him towards the kerb, putting out his hand for a cab. Beside him, Sherlock dipped to kiss John’s neck as he turned away.
John pulled out his old outdated flip phone and checked for messages. None from his mother or Harry. As if they would be worried about him. One was too engrossed in her drugs and sorrow, and other was trying to drown herself in self-indulgence. John loved his family, but he didn't like them much at all.
Sherlock sat the food on the desk, raising a brow at Mrs Hudson as he removed his suit jacket and hung it on the back of the chair across from John’s. “Herbal soothers aren’t exactly what I was smelling this morning when I left. You might crack a window next time.”
Irene called and called until John answered and threatened to drag him to the club if need be. He’d been reluctant to return with her, unable to know what kind of road she’d drag him down, and though John had never told her where he lived, she’d known anyway. John eventually caved, convincing himself that it was only for Irene’s sake and not because there was something about the lights and the queens that drew him in. Before long, he was going once a week, then twice, and eventually nearly every day that he could.
Sherlock groaned and met John for each thrust. John's cock was blushing and tumid against his own, tears of pre-ejaculate tracking translucent streams over his foreskin.
Sherlock levelled a peculiar look at John, seeming pensive. “There are... many things I am incapable of doing.”
Sherlock positioned his dick and sank inside, eyes squeezing shut as he struggled to regain control of his transport. It wouldn't do for John to see just how much power he held over Sherlock, but he guessed that ship has sailed long ago.
“Of course, how could I ever think otherwise. However, the amount of space on your couch is insufficient for the things I want to do to you.” Then, he pressed against the side of John’s cheek with his proud, roman nose, causing him to shudder in expectation. Those large hands drew him close, and John drowned in euphoria as Sherlock whispered, “Earlier tonight, I believe you mentioned something about number seventeen.”
Sherlock pointedly ignored her and stomped around the room with about as much grace as a herd of elephants, shucking off his shoes and coat before he collapsed in his chair, pulling John with him. John landed sideways in his lap, his legs draped over the arm of the chair and his arse between Sherlock's splayed thighs. John placed his head on Sherlock's chest and pulled out his phone while Sherlock dragged his long, pale fingers over John's scalp. If that didn't spell out gay couple in large bold letters, then Greg would be pressed to find something more convincing.
