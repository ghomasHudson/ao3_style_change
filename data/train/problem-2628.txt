For a moment Dean wasn’t sure Cas was going to answer.  A muscle jumped in his jaw and he swallowed as if the mere thought of telling a stranger about any weaknesses he had was going to make him physically ill.  Dean shifted, aching to at least be closer to the angel to lend some support, but he got the feeling Cas wouldn’t let him get close.
“I am sure they are better than the streets,” the angel parried with a small smile of his own and if Dean wasn’t sure he was literally incapable of it, he might have thought the angel was flirting.
The next morning – earlier than everyone but Dean wanted to be awake – found the four of them hiking through the woods.
"Are you sure you should be doing that given - yes, I understand, however -" Cas sighed and it was a long, suffering sound, his head falling back against the seat while he stared at the roof of the car.  "Fine," he said mildly, shrugging one shoulder, "But if you make yourself more sick -"
“Alright,” he said, heaving a great sigh and shaking his head to dislodge the blanket of fatigue trying to smother him.  “Time for a good, old-fashioned, pros and cons list.  Can’t go wrong with that.  So, what are the pros for taking Crowley’s deal?  One, we get the Viking guy and break the spell.”
Dean had to squint and even then it was a few seconds later before he could make out the hazy neon sign through the downpour.  That was another thing Cas seemed to have retained: freakishly good eyesight.
“I thought – I thought Cas was finally starting to be happy!  He seemed like he was finally relaxing!  He's been more
It was both eerily similar to the last time the angel had been a little out of his mind and completely different.
But he took another deep breath, not trusting what his senses were telling him.  He was too scrambled, in too much pain, to be sure.  Tentatively, and with his anger ebbing in the face of this new possibility, he asked, “Sam and Dean?”
“It shouldn't be much farther,” he told them, but he seemed less sure than before.  “Maybe another hour if we keep this pace.  I can smell clean woon smoke, which indicates there is a settlement nearby, but it is faint.  Are you sure you're both alright?  Do you need to stop and rest?”
Dean considered it, thinking of the small pot and frying pan that went with the camping stove they had.
wrong. You saved the fucking world, man. I think you're just...reading your signals wrong right now. There's...there
The three of them looked wary of each other, the two men watching Cas just as carefully as Cas was watching them and Dean was suddenly struck by how unreal the situation felt.
Castiel stiffened imperceptibly, his gaze snapping down to the ground as if noting the distance between them and Dean was dismayed to notice Cas' toes twitch in the sand, as if he wanted to take a step back.
,” he told them again, for good measure.  Later, when he had the energy and unconsciousness wasn’t creeping up on him like a wave, he would thank them properly.  For now, those two words would have to do.
Undeterred, Castiel simply pushed forward with his whole body, hands clutching at Dean’s.  “No – let’s go,
All down his arms he could feel his tight muscles, sore with overuse from dragging Cas across a field for an hour, protesting his sudden state of consciousness.
“Dean, I’ve been doing this for a very long time, and you are not the first hunter I have helped.  You’re not even the first hunter I’ve helped to change their mindset about other species.  I
Dean was the one to answer, but he couldn’t meet Castiel’s eye.  Instead. He scrubbed at his face roughly with both hands. “We…we forgot about the sigil.”
Dean hung up and Calwell wasted no time grabbing him by the elbow and steering him down a long hallway, presumably for a few solid hours of waiting and paperwork and then more waiting; Dean was no stranger to how this process worked.  But, much to his surprise, he was put in a room by himself.  He’d been in rooms like it before - with a single table and two chairs on either side of it.  On one side of the room, a dark one-way window was set up.  He was in an interrogation room.
They spent the next few minutes stripping off their own armor down to their pants, propping it up against barrels or draping it over the ends of the beds to dry out.  Dean hoped Cas could mojo their pants dry though.  He lifted his left leg awkwardly, feeling the cotton stick to and pull on his skin, and readjusted himself.
his grace.  But it was a bit like tying a string around a lightbulb.  It did nothing to block the light.
He felt Cas press close to his back, on hand darting out to his hip when someone else pushed past them.  The angel didn't do too well in crowds since becoming human either and Cas' hand grabbed a handful of his leather jacket.  Dean repressed a smile when a waitress waved them over to a booth against the back wall. He turned and grabbed Cas' wrist, taking in how his wide blue eyes darted around the bustling diner, and ushered him into the booth with a hand on his shoulder before sitting down right beside him, effectively making himself a barrier between Cas and the rest of the people in the room.
He'd just started pouring coffee into two mugs with a trembling hand and playing his doomsday scenarios when he heard the sound of the chair scraping across the floor and he spun to see Castiel stand and step slowly around the table, like he wasn't entire sure he should be doing so.
Dean swallowed, feeling ridiculous now that pain was no longer fogging his head.  He hadn’t realized how much of it he’d been in.  Over the last few days, the pain from his injuries, the constant throbbing in his legs and feet, and the sharp stabs of hunger, well, everything had just blended together.
For the first three or four seconds the sensation of being teleported – or flown, he corrected himself – was familiar, but still very disconcerting.  Like he was being squeezed into too small a space.  Except instead of being thrown to the ground a split second later the sensation just went on and on.  When he dared open his eyes, everything flashed around him in streaks of grey, rushing by at mind boggling speeds.  One second Dean thought he might have seen snowy mountain peaks and then he was looking down at the shrinking Atlantic Ocean.
Dean felt something jump in his stomach when he saw the little feathers along the leading edges of Cas' wings lift, puffing out.  Hulda saw it too, if her victorious smile was anything to go by.
He paused when the smell of something he couldn’t quite place tickled under his nose.  The first image it coaxed into Dean’s mind was rain water.  Clean, cool and just…humid?  Refreshing?
Another piece of Cas snapped into place inside his head.  How many times had Cas said something either totally inappropriate or at the absolute worst time, usually in front of normal people, only to look at Dean in confusion when he got upset about it.  Now he knew Cas had just been delivering information that needed to be delivered.  No wonder Cas barely spoke these days.
Around them, the drizzling rain tapped on the leaves of the trees and made them dance and the occasional fat drop pinged hollowly off the Impala.  In the distance, miles away, thunder rolled in a sluggish grumble.
This was for Cas, and he would do anything for Cas.  And Dean was almost sure that Crowley could be convinced to do anything for Cas too, if they could find the right leverage.
Just outside the small village, they passed a spindly wooden rack in the grass on the riverbank with fish drying in what was left of the sun and a tent and fire pit set up just beside it.
,” Cas breathed his name like a prayer, finally looking back down with grace-blown eyes.  His lips were swollen and red and his cheeks were a delicate pink.  Against Dean's chest, his hands trembled.  At his back, his wings shuddered and flexed.
His blue eyes found Hannah immediately and she stared back.  Castiel's brow furrowed then Hannah's did as well before she glanced over at Dean and then back to Cas.
He smiled, something settling in his mind now that he’d seen where they were in the context of surrounding areas.
long and emotionally taxing day.  He wanted to move things along and shift Liam’s intense insights on to someone else for a while.
Sam gasped through a delighted, watery grin, his hand rubbing at the angel's leg in an attempt to keep leading him back to the waking world.
The food turned out pretty damn good, for the fact they were using a rock for a stove, and both Dean and Sam had scarfed theirs down before either of the angels had had a second clam.
Sam was already kneeling on his bed roll, rubbing his eyes, hair a wild nest around his head.  One side sticky and tangled with dry blood.  He made a disgusted noise when he absently tried to run his fingers through his hair and then gingerly began trying to comb through the mats with his fingers.
“You've always been able to talk to people, Sam, it's always been easy for you.  Why do you think I always let you take the lead questioning witnesses?  You can talk to people and more importantly, people are comfortable talking
will decide if the information you have is worth the price of letting you go,” Castiel snapped.  “Speak now or I will find the information elsewhere.”
Castiel hummed, clearly only half way in to the waking world and Dean smiled into his hair, tightening his arm around Cas’ shoulders as much as he dared.
Dean turned and punched his brother in the arm, hard.  Doing it again when Sam leaned away and cackled.
Dean hadn’t convinced himself of anything, he’d just ignored it.  He ignored it whenever Cas did something reckless that ended with him getting hurt, silently patching him up without asking
The binding receded before it even really had a chance to take hold again, and Castiel quelled a bitter twitch of his lips, shoving the meager feeling of victory outside the walls with everything else.
Helpfully, his brain reminded him that the last time he had worn these, he’d been looking at hell hounds.
“No, I have not met them, but I spent time in a nearby area once before.  It is not unlikely, given all that they know, that they may have heard of me.”
Agreeing wholeheartedly, Dean busied himself with putting a tea bag into each of three mugs and ignoring how deeply the fatigue from the day was settling into the marrow of his bones.  He wondered what the progress was that
Cas made a soft noise of consent but watched closely as Dean came in to the room, blue eyes glinting sharply in the light coming through the open door.
His wings flared open in alarm, an intimidating display meant to threaten a foe that was no longer there, and he staggered back a few steps as if under the force of a violent blow.
Outside, the crisp fresh air felt too thick to make it down his constricted throat, but that didn’t stop Castiel’s lungs from trying to suck as much of it down as they could.
"Your angel friend?" Aldis asked.  "I've heard their ability to endure is incredible.  My grandfather used to tell us stories about when the angels were here in Tamriel, how they helped save the Imperial City and held off the forces of Oblivion long enough for Martin Septim to vanquish Mehrunes Dagon."
“We need more clams,” he muttered, heat pushing into his face when he felt the weight of Sam's amused gaze.
By the time they finally left, it was pushing close to lunch time.  Thankfully, it had stopped raining a few hours earlier, for which they were all grateful.  Cas finally admitted that, normally, the rain would not have been a problem, if he hadn't spent so much time in the hot water yesterday and washed all the oil off his feathers.
“Jesus, Cas, here…come here.  Sit down.”  He slowly let his hand settled on the angel’s good shoulder, but Castiel was too distracted by the pain in his other one to be concerned about the touch and he let Dean guide him to the edge of his bed.
Dean made sure his face was composed for when Cas turned around and hoped Sam was heating up the rest of the pizza like he’d told him to.  He’d left his brother equal parts confused and shocked after a hasty explanation of the state of Cas’ health and a hissed order to heat up some food for the angel.
Sam shook his head and softly said, “No, ma’am.  And I really am sorry, but we’re taking Cas and you’re not calling security.”
Dean scrambled to his feet, gut twisting sickeningly when another primal sound of agony clawed it's way from Castiel's throat.
had to change.  More honest, Sam told him, no matter how much it hurt.  No matter how awkward or uncomfortable it felt.  No covering up hurt feelings with harsh words.  No hiding behind alcohol and bad humor.
Dean focused on the road again, feeling the heavy atmosphere press down on him like the overcast sky overhead.
They bowed their heads, curled their exposed fingers into their palms and pushed for the meager, flickering speck of light in the distance.
It was immediately evident that Cas couldn't raise his arm past shoulder height and Dean watched him swallow around a groan of pain, his heart thudding too hard in his chest.
Dean’s face went from being red from frustration to pale and ill looking, perhaps thinking of what had almost happened just down the hall, without him even being aware of it.  It was getting harder and harder to read the man with every passing minute, Castiel noted, now that he did not have his own emotions to use as reference. He carried on.
The necro to their right snarled something at them and already had what looked like a ball of electricity gathered in the palm of his hand.  At the same time, the middle one suddenly had a shield of light in front of him, which did nothing to impeded the arrow Cas fired, and he went toppling backwards onto the table with an arrow sticking out of his eye.
Luckily, they had two angels that could cover a lot of distance really quickly and enjoy every second of it.  He was just about to yell for them to come out of the hut when Castiel came running back out through the door with a bark of laughter and Dean's words dried up in his throat.
They’d both read the same publications, taken the same quizzes, done the same homework, and come to the same conclusion.
Sometimes he forgot Cas wasn't as all-powerful and indestructible as he seemed.  He was a lethal fighter and – as Dean had recently come to find out – incredible with a bow and arrow.  And of course, Cas had his grace.  But Dean should know better than most that angels weren't immune to injury and death.  How many times had he seen Cas bleeding, in pain, and weakened to the point where he couldn't heal himself?
Sam licked his lips, still looking pale with an emotion Dean couldn’t quite place.  He licked his lips again, seeming to struggle getting his next words out, like just saying them was nearly making him gag.
“So, where is the little dove?” Crowley asked, looking between the brothers.  “Who’s net has he gotten himself tangled in this time?”
They took a few moments to rouse the woman and send her running before heading back to the car.  In the silence, Dean watched Cas absently cleaning the smears of blood off his hunting knife, dragging an old towel along the blade.
There were two other patrons this morning, crowded together at a small table by the door, hands wrapped around carved wooden mugs of steaming something-or-other.
He relaxed his grip only a little when he spotted a man and his horse ambling down the road towards them, looking for all the world like they had no place important to be.
than his suit and trench coat, and this time was just as strange as all the others.  Dean realized then that he had always thought Cas’ clothes were as much a part of him as his blue eyes or his messy black hair.  Seeing Cas in anything
Still, Sam's outfit was similar to Dean's in every way except his tunic was brown and had a much more conservative neckline.
Once Cas was satisfied that he’d syphoned most of the water from his feathers, he shot Dean a smug look, his wings half folded at his sides, like he couldn’t stand the feeling of his damp feathers touching each other.  And Dean knew that he couldn’t.
“Of course it was Norse.”  Of course it was.  He pinched the bridge of his nose and took a calming breath.  Still, he muttered an Enochian curse upon the Viking barbarians responsible for his current predicament.
With a jolt, he realized he hadn’t been praying for the many long minutes he and Dean had been talking and a spike of disgust and fear rammed itself down his throat.
“I’m sorry, Cas,” Sam seemed to struggle to get the words out, sounding like someone had a hand around his throat.  “I never thought of it like that.”  He looked like he had more to say, but he bowed his head and cleared his throat.
It was an oddly human thing to do for the angel and it left both Sam and Dean blinking at the strangeness of it.  It had briefly drawn the attention of two locals, who had skirted around the reach of Cas’ wings to avoid being bludgeoned as they walked by.
He pulled a deep breath through his nose and let it out in a rush.  “Ok...so...some old guys on another planet rang up an
“The monks, of course.  The ones who asked me to come.  Now go to sleep, both of you.  You'll be useless if you don't get some rest.”
"-then the logical solution would be to stop and get some rest."  Cas was already on his phone, thumbs tapping away faster than even Sam's could.  "There's a motel five miles from here," he muttered, swiping the screen and tossing the phone on the seat between them.
Castiel finally sat up, seemingly unperturbed by the stickiness between them, and fixed Dean with a sly look.
Dean offered him a shy but genuine smile when Castiel dared look at him.  On his other side, Sam offered the same.
Apparently, his brother was feeling extra adventurous.  Though, Dean supposed, they were on an alien planet.  If there was a better time to sample some new culinary delights, he couldn’t think of it.
“I don't think we will sleep tonight,” answered Hannah, tossing her paper plate into the fire just like Sam and Dean had.
Wide, blue eyes stared up at him with cautious curiosity and Dean had never wished more in his life then he did then for the ability to read minds. There was wariness in Castiel's gaze and a current of whipcord tension still had him ready to leap at a moment's notice. But he wasn't scrambling away in fear or screaming like he still thought hellfire was singeing his skin, so Dean would take what he could get.
Dean already knew that wasn’t an option but felt compelled to say it anyway.  They’d done that to Crowley before – too many times to be fair – and he didn’t think they’d get away with it again.  Besides, Crowley knew where Cas was
Water sprayed ten feet in a thousand directions, catching the sunlight filtering through the trees and making tiny rainbows.
, Cas.”  Dean’s voice shook against the back of Cas’ neck.  He tired to move closer, tangled their legs, tried to give some of his heat to the cold body pressed against him.  "It’s ok, I’ll…I’ll watch over you.  Sleep, ok?  Just…just sleep.“
Castiel curled his fingers into his palms, wings flexing under his back, knowing the serpent could hear his thoughts.  He took another breath and tried to calm the white noise building between his ears.  It had been a long time since he’d felt this angry and he glared into the bloody haze.
“Your wings are fine!  I mean how are they gonna react to them?  They look human, what if they freak out over seeing a dude with wings just strolling up the road?”
Across the courtyard, Dean could just make out a faint glowing light and he squinted, trying to make out what it was and realizing it was an alchemy station – he could see baskets and a trunk at the base of the table, the set up tucked into what used to be a stable, with weak wooden beams holding up a dry thatch roof.  The table glowed with a subtle green light and he could see the tiny flame flickering under a burner.
When they finally pulled apart they were both breathing hard, the blush had receded from Castiel’s face and wolf whistles and cat calls from the edge of the water had Dean groaning and dropping his head to rest on Cas’ shoulder.
, Cas.  We’re worried about your mental health.  We’re worried about the fact that you hate yourself and think you’re no better than whatever weapon you can hammer yourself into for us.  It makes us
have a shady past could pull that off."  He leaned back in his chair, "So, if she was a prisoner being brought to that chopping block in Helgen, what if she's still involved in…the lifestyle?  What better way to go underground than asking your guild buddies to bury you?"
Dean eyed a pile of dirty, bloody rags piled on a table outside one of the tents, but the flap was closed and he couldn’t see inside.
He could just make out their destination about twenty yards away before the clouds passed over the moons again and they were plunged back in to darkness.
He’d been in a car accident before, remembered how the driver had frantically stomped the break pedal against the floor, but it had been too little too late.
When he finished, he tossed the book back down on the table, still open, and looked between the brothers with a small smile.
“Four months ago there was an attack on Helgen, a small town to the south-east.  There were only a handful of survivors – one of them, a Dark Elf woman by the name Jenassa, came to the city seeking aide for Riverwood.  At the time, we thought the dragon that attacked Helgen was going to target them next but the dragon never showed itself again.  Several days after the woman arrived, a second dragon was spotted over the plains to the west and a group of soldiers was dispatched to take it down.  We lost several good men but the Elf...” he cleared his throat, looking away.  “The soldiers who returned all told the same story.  After the dragon had finally been slain it turned to glowing ash and a wash of light left it's corpse...and passed through her.”
He glanced at his right wing, eyeing the span of black somewhat wistfully, remembering the searing agony of hellfire turning his feathers to ash.
Dean nearly choked on his stew and Sam's eyes widened a little in surprise before he could get his expression under control and the brothers shared a look over the table.  Luckily, Wilhelm was looking at the fire between them and didn't seem to notice.
Finally, Castiel eyes opened and stayed open, but when they wandered over to Dean his pupils were blown wide, black eating up all but a thin ring of blue around the edges.
“Do you remember how we met?” Dean asked so abruptly that both Sam and Cas' heads snapped around to stare at him. “We met in Hell.”
“I want it to stop,” he whispered, his shoulders and wings hunching, and he closed his eyes like he’d just admitted a terrible sin.  “Everything hurts
The brothers settled down with their flimsy leather bags for pillows, rolling a bit closer to the fire as the temperature continued to drop, and tried their best to sleep through their first night on a new planet.
Liam nodded, pursing his lips and staring at Cas’ limp form from the doorway, looking more and more concerned the longer he stared.  “Well, if they reacted that strongly to such a small amount of tea then they’ll be asleep for several hours.  Don’t worry, it will be good for them to get some good rest.”
Dean compulsively peered into the darkness around them but the gently swaying trees and bushes were constantly shifting, making it difficult to spot anything that may be hiding nearby.
As if he’d forgotten he was even holding it, Cas blinked and looked down, then slowly held it out for Dean to take.
“There are other ways of protecting ourselves.  You and Sam are both excellent with blades and hand to hand combat.  Let me be clear, we are going to a dangerous, magically advance, alien planet and will be trying to locate a high profile target as covertly as possible.  We do
The bear took chase, thundering along behind them, grunting and groaning.  Just when Dean was starting to think that maybe they were going to have to think about facing and killing the thing because he had
!”  The needle climbed on the speedometer.  “Stay right where you are, Cas!  You’re only an hour away!  Stay right there!”
His body had already curled him in to a ball as he slept but he pulled himself in tighter all the same, clutching at the blankets laid over him.
“Is…is everything ok?”  Sam asked, sounding like he knew how stupid the question was given everything that was going on.
“I changed the plates on the cars, just in case,” Sam told him, setting the bags on the little table under the window.  “And the only place open was a Greek place down the road so we’re having baklava for breakfast.  Or supper.”  He grimaced, looking around for the staple clock that seemed to be in all motel rooms.
Agony curled around him like a snake and crawled down his throat like a vine creeping into a corpse. He couldn't move, couldn't fight; could only exist and try to endure.
“Sam?  What’re you doing here you’re sick!  You should be on resting…er, bed resting…in bed – bed rest –”
Heart pounding in his chest – the ringer was up all the way so he didn’t miss any calls – he nearly broke his fingers shoving his hand into his pocket.
even know?  Or does it fluctuate depending on your mood and the current state of the universe?  You don’t want me the way that I am, nor do you want me the way that I am not.  I don’t blame you.  I have caused nothing but problems since I pulled you from hell.  I only wish that you would stop pretending,” he eyed them both, feeling like his heart was leaking onto the floor, “For your sake as well as mine.”
Even still, the thought of showing the brothers his true form when he already felt like…like an animal…
“Damn, if Cas had done that on earth it would have brought the entire world to a standstill,” Sam muttered.
Dean glanced skyward, weezing, chest burning with the strain of so much physical exertion after his first trip through space, thinking that if the clouds would just clear away for a god damn minute they might be able to see better with the moon lighting the way – he assumed there
"Dean." Sam was suddenly at his side, his bigger hands pulling at Dean's arms, trying to pry his fingers off Castiel's shoulders. "Dean stop...
Whatever happened on Dean’s face then made her take a step back and she swallowed, holding her clipboard in front of her like a shield.
There were a few unique, and very alien-looking, plants that seemed to thrive in the harsh climate.  The yellow flowers were growing in abundance in the valley, looking a bit like orchids to Dean’s untrained eye, as well as some kind of creeping red vine that grew in clusters near the pools of water.
All they got in response was a roll of blue eyes.  "Suck it up." Cas told them with an eerily accurate Dean-like sneer, but out of the corner of his eye, Dean saw the tips of his wings twitch near the ground.
“This ok?” he panted as he curled just the tips of his fingers into the soft feathers of the angel's wing-base.
Sam maneuvered his way under Castiel’s limp right wing, letting it drape over his shoulders while he snagged an arm around Castiel’s waist to hold him up.
"It’s an Orc,” Castiel informed them.  He grabbed Sam under the arm and pulled him to his feet, lingering until he was sure Sam wasn’t going to fall over.
“Awesome!  Tell me where to dig!”  Sam said, rubbing his hands together.  Seafood was to Sam as steak was to Dean and he'd seen the guy near drool over bacon wrapped scallops and fancy whiskey steamed muscles more than once.  But, like steak, that shit was expensive and they didn't often get it.
Dean took a few slow steps over to him. Cas didn't look upset that he didn't remember any of the appliances, just frustrated.
Nothing ever seemed to be easy for Castiel.  The fact that he, someone who had wings, could feel wrong by how right using those wings just for fun felt...it made Dean feel like he'd swallowed rocks and they were tugging his stomach down.
It was an undeniably caring gesture from the brothers and he felt a brief surge of affection towards them.  But couldn’t help but feel a filament of suspicion as well.  Not after the conversation they’d just had.  He felt guilty for the feeling, but the guilt did nothing to stop it.
The river was wide, about fifteen feet across, and the stubby grass that covered the ground between the houses was replaced by small, loose stones that had been polished smooth by turbulent waters.  Under Dean’s boots, they gave way, making walking to close to the river’s edge a daring game of chicken.
He took a moment to question just what his body had done for the several hours he’d been dead to the world because he certainly didn't feel like it had been anything useful.
"We cannot stop here, we don't have any equipment.  Drink the potion I gave you,” he told them.  "It will help."
“What gave us away?”  Sam asked, standing tall and intimidating with his arms folded across his chest.
“There is a wash basin right there, you know,” Castiel interrupted mildly, gesturing in the direction of the wardrobe in the corner.
A hundred or so yards downriver, just on the other side of the bridge, the river dropped away into a short waterfall.  They could see the mist hovering in the air around the bridge from the turbulent waters.   Dean wasn't about to get his armor wet – not with the early morning chill still in the air – so he and Sam started picking their way up-stream, back towards the bridge they had crossed to get into town, until the water calmed a bit and they found a disjointed chain of rocks in a narrow part they could hop across.
to the no touching rule and slowly reached up to push his fingers into Cas' hair, pausing when the angel flinched, but then gently brushing through the soft strands as he spoke quietly.
One corner of Dean's mouth turned up in a half smile.  Cas had caught on quickly to being human.  Or as close to human as an angel could get, he'd been told.  Some things about him were
Cas eventually left the seagull alone and stayed close to the water, drifting closer to Hannah as she kept steady on her course for the shore line.  Cas kept veering from side to side, breaking away from her to fly perpendicular to her path before coming back, as if he wasn't quite ready to stop flying yet even though they'd been at it for nearly eight hours.
“I'm alright now,” Castiel promised poorly, but the words shook and tumbled out too fast to be true.
explanation that involved a lot of physics and several mentions of the mysterious etheric plane where wings were hidden for protection and convenience.
“Well, they can't fit in here with me,” Castiel had told him once, gesturing to his bare chest and looking at Dean like he was a moron. It was such a refreshing thing, to see that look on Cas' face again, that Dean forgot to be insulted and instead had laughed.
Mixwater Mill, according to the map, was the closest place that might offer a bed to sleep in and, since they were not about to linger around Fort Amol for more necromancers to show up, they made the decision to press on.
Castiel was more at ease and more happy than Dean had thought he could be and while that made his own heart glow in a way he would never, ever vocalize, it still left him feeling disappointed that
The crackle and pop of the fire filled the silence at the end of her speech and the brothers were left reeling.
Dean felt a sadness spreading through him like frost creeping over delicate foliage and something in him shrivelled and died.
Whenever the sigil’s power began to fade, Castiel found it almost impossible to keep track of his body.  His
Before, when he was young, his wings had been a pure pristine white like all his brothers and sisters, when their grace was too young and too weak to leave it’s own mark.  As an angel grew and changed, so did their wings; changed, molded and painted by their grace so that no two angels had the exact same wings.
Either way, the scowl on her face drew more attention than the skin that was showing and she strode out to meet Castiel.
He tore his eyes away from where his brother and Hannah were crouching down by the water pump, rinsing off the clam shells one at a time, their hands close enough under the meagre stream of water that they kept bumping together.
"I need you, Cas." Dean choked, brushing away a stray curl of hair on Cas' forehead. "I need you, please, come back."
The first thing that managed to filter through the haze in Dean's brain was the soft thud of Cas' wings bracing against the sand, apparently spent enough that he no longer wished to hold them up.  Absently, Dean pried his hands off Cas' hips and stroked the backs of his knuckles down the inside of each wing, grinning when he felt Cas shiver against him.
Sam had told him to watch Netflix and to heal, so he watched Netflix.  He healed.  Was still healing.  Sam asked him to translate this Latin text, so that was what he was doing.  Dean told him to eat, so he ate.  Dean had told him to wear his clothes and 'lose the suit', so he had.
He swallowed his heart and looked down at the strange, frozen face.  He looked a little like the woman they had seen in the Jarl's place in Whiterun.  His face was long, angular and had dark grey skin.  His eyes, frozen open in the shock of death, were black.  Much like a demon.
He repeated the process a second time, and then a third and fourth.  Finally, he readjusted his shoulders, straightening where he had begun to slouch because, he realized, he actually felt a little more relaxed now.
Castiel sagged against him as if he had every intention of taking a nap right there on the floor and grumbled when Dean didn’t allow him to, hauling him back up.
“I cut my grace into pieces,” he told them once Sam was sitting. He pulled the blanket closer around his shoulders. He'd yet to try and attempt to move his wings again, scared that they might not be there. “I...I don't really know why, I just knew that I must, that it would increase my chances of surviving for longer. What that would accomplish, I'm not sure.”
Lemme know what you think!  I wanted to add more picture but couldn't find any I liked...I wish I know how to use photoshop so I could make my own edits...ugh.  I've become obsessed with adding pictures to my fics lately.
.  Doubtful she would have stopped to speak to someone in a town she had only planned to pass through as quickly as her legs could carry her, therefore someone must have stopped her and asked her to go to Whiterun to send help."
Dean caught the eye of another guard standing in the path between the two shops.  As they walked, the blank face of the helmet didn't so much as twitch to follow their progress and a second later Dean heard the guard let out a long, bored sigh.
Also please be gentle with any criticism this is literally the first time I have written anything in four years.
“The last time I was here, Skyrim seemed on the verge of civil war and I fear it is reaching its apex now.  The Imperials rival the Stormcloaks.  The Stormcloaks are the rebellion that rose up against the Imperial Legion, who sought to force all factions, races and regions under one rule and one governing head.”
"A few health reagents and something to clear out common sickness and diseases, if you could.  Then we'll call it square."
He was left with a familiar void in place of everything else, and he took a moment to observe how very old this sensation felt.  The void felt ancient, as if he hadn’t utilised this technique for millions and millions of years. As if more time had passed since he’d met Sam and Dean than his entire existence before them.  As if existing in Sam and Dean’s world had impacted and changed him in more significant ways than all the time he’d been alive before them.
Taking another moment to think carefully about the question, he answered, “I mean, I guess he lives here.  He’s got his own room and everything but…he hasn’t really used it.  Until recently,” he added
"They hate anyone who isn't what they consider to be a ‘true Nord’,” she continued unprompted, with a roll of her large eyes.  "And they hate anyone different from them, especially if they don't
. It wasn't that escape scared him – he'd longed for everything to just end for decades. No, it was the possibility that he might be
He managed it with a great deal of effort, biting his tongue through a flare of pain that swept through his chest muscles as he moved.
“Yes, especially since I am quite sure two of the three mentioned so far do not exist.”  Castiel moved to rub at his eyes.  “I am starting to think he is giving me this work just to keep me busy.”
Above him, Cas whimpered, his hips twitching back and forward, thrusting in what was purely a instinctual move of his human body and Dean saw the freak-out before it happened, releasing them both when the blue light in Cas' eyes flickered.
Off to one side of the room there was movement and he forgot all about the word he was trying to hang on to, shifting his gaze to track the new thing in the room.  It was
“Yes,” Castiel explained, calmly picking up the seuture needle and thread.  “To be fair, she did warn me that she normally does more than just
The maelstrom inside him calmed and that familiar dull ache returned.  He wondered if he might be ok if it turned out Hannah
He stared at the black and deep blue and white feathers.  Every one of them pristine, sleek, and perfect.  Unburned.  Untouched.  Under his own gaze, the feathers lifted and flared as adrenaline saturated his blood stream.
“Stay awake, Sam!” Dean ordered, trying to ignore the stabs of pain from what were likely several bruised ribs.
A quiet, broken sob and arms tightening around him was the only answer to his prayer for forgiveness.
, he wanted to say.  But he wouldn’t, knew now that it wasn’t right to ask that of Cas after what he’d been through; after all the times he
so much.  Why had his Father made he and his siblings with the ability to feel pain?  Surely they would have been much more effective soldiers if they couldn’t feel.  Though he had long ago stopped trying to figure out the reasoning behind his Father’s choices.
He slipped out the door, wings brushing against the iron, and breathed a sigh of relief when it clanged shut behind him.
The higher they climbed the colder it got.  The pine trees began to thin and the rocks and boulders poking from the ground got bigger and Dean was glad someone had taken the time to clear the way for a road because the thought of lifting his foot more than an inch off the ground seemed a far-off, impossible, goal.  He'd had just about enough hiking for a lifetime but it was when he glanced over his shoulder and saw Sam lagging twenty feet behind that he decided enough was enough.
Yet another assumption he had gotten wrong.  If only he’d been able to see Cas’ wings all this time.
He scrambled back, out from under the heavy blanket, pushing himself into the wall, and both Sam and Dean stood and backed away immediately, their hands in the air, until they were clear on the other side of the room. But it didn't help the tightness in Castiel's throat nor the did it ease the sudden difficulty he found in breathing.
While they walked, Cas held his damp wings out wide, taking up the entire road and then some.  All the feathers were fluffed up and fanned out to allow the air to circulate between each one and dry the remaining water.
Cas’ feathers lifted more aggressively, obviously so freaked out by this new development that he could no longer control his physical reaction to it.  It made Dean’s heart give an aching beat and he caught his brother’s eye.
“You could ward a coffin in the ground against all evil but would you feel comfortable living in it?”  Liam peered over the top of his glasses shrewdly, like a professor addressing a student who was being a bit thick.  “Angels are creatures of flight. Their home is the sky and its walls are the horizon.  As humans, we feel safe in fortresses; the more impenetrable the better.  For an angel, safety is the open air; it is in having the
“What did the Greybeards have to say?”  Sam asked, sitting up in the other bed and reaching his arms over his head in a stretch.
Now, it was different. He no longer felt like he was shaking apart and he wondered, with fear clawing at his throat like a demon seeking to escape, if he focused enough, would he be able to feel the ground, solid and still, under his feet?
For a moment, he contemplated standing up.  He should probably make some kind of appearance to the brothers.  They seemed to get…concerned when he hid in his room for too long and he wasn’t at all certain how long he had been ‘zoned out’ as Dean would call it.  Given that the sigil was beginning to lose it’s power, he thought it safe to assume it was nearing twenty-four hours.
“Alright just…just take deep breaths, Dean.  We can help Cas, we just need to break it down into more manageable steps.”
The book had a roughly sketched illustration of an angel curled up in the same position as Cas was now, with the wings drawn lightly over the figure.
He focused on the question Sam asked him, grateful that it wasn’t an order.  “I…I woke up.  It was dark and I…couldn’t remember what had happened and…I was in pain. Again.  I thought having my wings here with me would have helped relieve the pressure for a while longer but…when I woke up just now it felt like I was being crushed again.  I don’t know how to explain the feeling, but I needed to relieve the pressure and the only way I could think of doing that now was to...” he motioned vaguely to the half-finished sigil cut in to his chest.
For an angel to lose its wings was an incomprehensible loss; impossible to describe, even in their flowery language.
Castiel couldn’t identify.  He just knew from the feel of it; a spell so primitive couldn’t be this tangible, this visceral.  He could
Dean wondered how he might feel if a flea yelled at him for the way one of his eyebrow hairs was sitting.
He pulled his knees in and folded his arms against his chest, fluffing his feathers for more warmth even though he was very warm already.  It hadn’t been that long since the last time he’d been without his grace, shivering in the rain in a dark alley and wondering how the damp and cold had worked itself so deeply into his bones. He’d forgotten how cold the world was when he was without that fire in his chest.
Hannah had blinked at him with shock that lasted several long seconds and Castiel turned away, rubbed the pads of his fingers over his lips in a way Dean had only seen once or twice before when the angel had been particularly overwhelmed by something.
The place wasn’t a dive, per-se, but he certainly would not be bringing his mother here to showcase the world’s last thirty or so years of dining advancements.
“Yeah, I don't even care what a Hoarker is, I'm drooling at the thought of anything close to edible,” Sam said.  Then he looked over to Cas, who had thus far been silently observing the tavern’s patrons.  “How come you're eating, Cas?  Does it have something to do with being cut off from the etheric plane?”  Sam asked the question casually enough, but underneath it, Dean could tell he was concerned.
Castiel’s throat tightened ominously.  “I’m sorry…I’m just – I’m just tired.”  It was a weak excuse but it was the only one he had.
“So…angels make the trip out here pretty often then?”  he asked, wondering what other questions he could ask that might get another smile or smirk from Cas.  It was such a rare thing to see on the angel’s face.
“I don't smell!”  Dean snapped defensively, out of habit.  Surreptitiously, he lifted his arm a bit, sniffed, and had to concede that he didn't exactly smell like a bed of roses.
Apparently Cas hadn't been kidding when he said they would be heading out at first light because when Dean woke to a hand on his shoulder and a gravely voice calling his name, he could barely make out a patch of sky just starting to creep over the distant mountains that was slightly less black than the sky above it.
Garth, Cesar and Jessy didn’t know Cas all that well, but they knew him well enough to look concerned.  Garth looked horrified, his big eyes shining while he stared unashamedly at Castiel.
“Driving in the Impala,” Castiel answered without hesitation. “I’m usually in the back seat and the windows are open when it’s warm. I don’t even feel trapped at all, in that car.  I feel trapped in most cars.  They’re just…too small.  Sometimes Sam and Dean are fighting over music; sometimes we’re talking about things that don’t matter; sometimes no one is saying anything at all and it’s just quiet and peaceful.  That…I enjoy that, on the rare occasion that it happens.”
It became evident that no explanation was going to follow so Castiel leaned on the back of his chair again, feeling agitation and fatigue warring for attention within him.
.  Me and Cas had an argument at the motel and some fuck-wad called the cops for a domestic dispute.  When they got there they saw Cas all banged up from the hunt and thought I hurt him.  So they arrested me and took Cas away in an ambulance.”
Dean stared at the man across the table.  Taking in his flat expression, the way his brown eyes glinted in the light over head like a scope in the sun, belying danger.  He wasn’t supposed to say anything, but he’d already fucked that rule.
“Come to think of it, we should probably get you an ID.  Hannah too,” he rolled his bottom lip between his teeth, unsure if he should say what he was about to.  “Castiel Winchester.  Sound good to you?”
It was only after they’d all gotten back to the silence and stillness of the bunker that Dean realized Cas wasn’t as ok as he’d first thought.
But it was at that moment that he remembered that Hannah was perfectly capable of reading his mind and he blanched, his head snapping up to stare at her with his blood frozen in his veins.
He took a deep breath and tore his eyes from where Castiel was smiling one of his little smiles at whatever Sam was saying, and looked back at Jessy and Cesar.
Dean chuckled and moved to the fridge. “You want something to eat? We still have some fruit left or I could make some eggs or something...” he glanced around the fridge for something Cas might like.
"You fought me, of course, the entire flight out." Cas murmured against the back of his neck, before shifting and resting his chin on Dean's other shoulder.
“I’m in Colorado.”  Eyeing a rack of maps, he tried to remember where the hell they had all been when they said goodbye to Dean, but his mind was still refusing to fully cooperate.  Looking down at the map he had just grabbed, he remembered it would be of little use if he didn’t know
If Dean hadn't been watching so closely, he would have missed the corner of the angel's eye twitch, and it was a strange thing to realize that Cas seemed to both
“Why are you doing this?” Castiel asked at length, he slowly pulled his wings in, as if moving slower would somehow make them less visible.
Another breath-taking view sprawled out in front of them and Dean let his gaze wander.  He could see the road they would keep following after they were done here, only visible for a short distance before it disappeared into a surprisingly thick patch of fur trees, the tallest of which had a soft dusting of snow on their upper branches.  Not too far above that, the snow was thick and clinging to the sides of the mountains.
smell,” Sam gripped, looking down at his own bare chest and blessedly not mentioning the conversation between Cas and Dean.  “I want a bath.”  He tried for the hundredth time to run his fingers through his hair, but the blood matted in to it made it impossible.  “I feel disgusting.”
Although, even Dean had to admit that those big eyes and obvious naivety made people instantly want to wrap the angel in a blanket.  Dean himself wasn't immune to that, in fact he was probably the most susceptible to it.
He never felt more rested afterwards.  He never felt like his body had replenished its energy stores.  He only felt as if he had prolonged the inevitable for a few more hours.
“Thank you,” she sighed, sitting down like he’d just put a velvet pillow on the chair.  “Sorry, I’m just so damn tired and I have so much paperwork to do and…anyway.”  She shook her head, pulled a pen from the pocket of her lab coat and bent over the pad of paper, scribbling furiously.
Cas stood, stretching his arms over his head, and the brothers watched as his wings unfolded and spread wide, straining in opposite directions and filling up the entire space of their little camp.
Ok, we had our first little lore dump in this chapter!  Let me know if it doesn't make sense or there's gaps somewhere that I am missing.
aware of his wings.  Very aware of how vulnerable he was with them out and his grace bound.  Why had he thought manifesting them would be a good idea, he must look horrible to the poor human.
“Like a rock,” Dean mumbled, his voice raspy.  As he waited for the weight of a deep sleep to leave his limbs, he briefly considered explaining to Cas that it wasn’t good form to come in to someone else’s room while they were sleeping but decided not to waste his time.  He’d only get one of those confused squints in response.
They moved cautiously and quietly through the destruction, eyes and ears open.  They found Sam’s axes halfway across the clearing and Dean regrettably picked up his sword, hoping he could find something more practical soon.  Cas had another arrow notched, the bow held half ready to go in front of him, wings tense and spread slightly at his back.
He turned back to try and offer some kind of reassurance to the angel, but just then, on the other side of the room, the guy with the string instrument started singing, his voice a little off key in a way that suggested some people might have been paying for his songs with ale.
One soldier was sitting on a thick chopping log and the other was standing with his back to the three of them, half a loaf of bread in one hand.
With a quick glance around to make sure there were no more bandits, Castiel moved quickly to the stone block, of all things, and the brothers followed, looking this way and that across the wide-open area.
Distanly, he felt he should be surprised by the fact that Cas aparently had personal items and wondered where angels kept such things.
His coverts flared again under the praise and Castiel bit his tongue.  Dean certainly wasn’t the first one to tell him his Hell scars were esthetically pleasing.
Castiel blinked several times, frozen in his chair, utterly blindsided by the abrupt shift in direction.
Castiel stared at the brothers, frozen like a mouse that suddenly realized a cat had noticed him, unwilling to so much as twitch under their watchful gaze.  They stared back, hungry for any microscopic tell they might uncover with their probing questions.
The truth was mangled and gore-encrusted; it was messy and tear-stained; deep and ugly like a gangrenous wound.  It smelled of charred flesh and burnt feathers.  Tasted of congealed blood and tainted grace.
bound him?”  Crowley looked unsettlingly appalled but it was hard to tell if that was just a show to make them feel even worse about it than they already did.
stance and Castiel felt a small quiver of something quite like fear slither between his heaving ribs.
It hadn't taken Dean long to realize that angels truly were creatures of flight and seeing how happy it made Cas just to indulge his instinct to fly till he dropped made Dean wonder how he'd coped all those years having to keep his wings tucked away all the time.  The only time he didn't have his wings out now was if they had to go on a hunt or go to the grocery store.
“I’ll be there in,” Sam paused to look at his watch.  “I’ll be there late tomorrow night.  Now listen to me, if they answered the call and arrested you at the same time, that means they arrested you without a warrant.  By law, if they can’t get Cas to press charges, find concrete proof that you did something illegal
Dean tried not to stare, having never seen them exhibit this particular behaviour yet, but quite sure Cas had just made some kind of apology for storming off and Dean breathed a bit easier.  At least he'd managed to help calm things between them.
he wished for that, only that he did. What did time matter to him? Why should he want to count it's passing?
They'd stopped bickering at least, working now in silence, and Dean tried not to feel like a creep as he watched them.  He didn't really understand where this new found fascination of his had come from, but he couldn't seem to get enough of watching Cas – how he behaved and spoke and moved – ever since he'd started noticing he was doing those things differently now.
The hot water must have been hot enough to cut through the protective oils in his feathers and dried them all out.
.  How could he not be?  He was bound by painful magic, powerless, and locked in a little box with three people who killed supernatural beings for a living.  And Mary had gone and proven Cas' fears to be true by shooting him.  Dean wondered, after everything, how he could have thought that Castiel the
Dean, who was alive and driving in the Impala as if he hadn’t been dead mere moments ago.  Back to the bunker where Sam was not because Castiel had failed
“Hello,” Cas greeted, not unkindly.  His wings were still tense and folded tight against his back but some of the sharp lines of muscle under his skin smoothed as he relaxed.
“Violent behaviour?”  Dean parroted, feeling appalled.  “Cas wouldn’t hurt a fly.  In fact, I literally witnessed him befriend a hive of bees just so he could gather some of their honey!”
Dean held Cas against him long after the tranquilizer had done it's job. The angel was a dead weight in his arms, leaning heavy against his chest, and he knew there was no comfort he could lend to an unconscious mind. But he couldn't let go, his arms wouldn't loosen, and he didn't have it in him to care if that was overstepping some bounds because every ounce of self control he had left was being used to keep from breaking down completely.
He didn't have room in him for more fear, he was full to the brim with it, shaking so hard that he could hear his teeth rattling. When Dean came towards him, his face twisting into something foul and demonic, Castiel could only cover his face with trembling hands and let a sob wrack his body.
He felt his mouth open but halted the words for a moment.  He could not promise Dean that he would sleep, because he wouldn’t.  It became obvious then, as he read the eager yet strained expression on the man’s face, that he probably wanted to go spend time with his newly resurrected mother.
, as Liam had said. He couldn’t imagine what feeling better would even look like at this point and thought perhaps feeling less was as good as it was going to get.
Unbothered by the rain, several chickens were pecking at the ground between the cobblestones and they squawked in anger as the three men approached the house, flapping dramatically out of the way.
But at the sound of Sam's voice, most of the tension had left them immediately and their eyes had stopped glowing and they'd turned to the brothers with impatient expressions, wondering why they'd been interrupted.
Cas and Hannah's jaw clipped shut but they turned equally annoyed looks upon him, instantly banding together in an invisible but palpable truce to combat a common enemy.
Dean took it.  The new leather around the pommel was supple, giving him a firm grip and excellent control of the blade.  It was light and quick and he smiled.
He had to call his name a few more times before Castiel’s eyes finally opened.  Even then, they kept slipping closed and Castiel turned his face into the wall with a soft groan, wrapping his arm tighter around himself and pulling his knees closer to his chest.
So they'd stoked it high enough to officially call it a bonfire, flames licking high into the air and pushing back against the dark and the fog, and Dean had followed Sam into the cabin with images in his head of Castiel soaring high above the massive waves of the open ocean, miles and miles off the coastal shore where Sam and Dean were sleeping, the tiny fire a pinprick in his angelic sight.  A constant beacon marking home.
At the edge of one of said pools, Cas paused, frowning in such a way that Dean knew the angel simply could not fight his curiosity any longer, and tentatively stuck his hand in the hot water.
In the trees around them, the birds went quiet, as if the unease in the angelic voice made them wary too.
It was lucky, Dean realized after he nearly took the front tires off pulling in to the Town & Country diner, that there hadn’t been a single cop on the highway over. He knew from personal experience that ‘driving with the intent to kill’ was an actual thing.
Reflexively, Dean caught him under the arms, feeling unaturally soft feathers sliding against the backs of his hands.  Together, he and Sam lowered him to the ground as gently as they could.
Castiel came to a stop behind Liam and the brothers, eyeing the shotgun in her hands and wondering if she ever put it down.
Small talk eventually turned to talk of food and soon Dean was leading Jessy and Cesar over to the water where Sam was still standing at the edge, watching Castiel, who had wandered deeper in to where the water reached his thighs and over to the wall of rock opposite the trail, carefully picking a few little flowers growing out of the moss.
,' he told himself as his eyes traced a drop of water that was sliding between Cas' shoulder blades and down, down, down to the dip in his back.
When Sam’s long finger poked him in the side through all his sweaters, the feeling shuddered loose and he made a sound that was half laughter, half protest as he recoiled into Dean’s side, grabbing Sam’s wrist to still his prodding fingers.
Iddra looked exhausted when the three of them ordered breakfast from her the next day and they sat at a table in the far corner, away from the bar, discussing the best way to approach her on the subject of the Thieves Guild.
” he said firmly, seemingly addressing not only Dean but the entirety of the universe as if to set the record straight once and for all.
They left the car and crept between the shadows, closing in on their target and realizing it was a young man no older than twenty, dragging a woman that only looked half conscious.
He clenched his teeth, remembering only a month ago when he had reached up to adjust the collar of Cas' shirt, his fingers barely grazing his throat, and Cas had flinched away from him.  For a split second, raw fear had flashed through his blue eyes and Dean had pulled away, feeling nauseous and angry.  Cas had come to them - to
than I've ever seen him.  Cuddling up with another angel, flying for hours a day – for fuck's sake his eyes are
They weren't as dark as he'd first thought, Dean realized dazedly. The tiny feathers all along the leading edges were jet black but they turned a rich, dark color halfway down, like burnt chocolate. The farther down the wing Dean looked, the lighter the feathers became, going from dark chocolate to burnt amber and sienna shades. The tips of the longest feathers – the ones curling against the walls – were such a rich, deep color they almost glowed like low-burning coals. With every deep breath Castiel took, the wings shifted with him, light from the hallway playing across the glossy feathers. Close to Cas' bare torso Dean was sure he saw flecks of blue hidden in the small feathers – the same deep, dark shade as the angel's eyes.
“I will be sleeping occasionally also.”  Cas offered them a tight smile.  “Just so you know not to worry.”
There was still just the one light source across the room – and he was most definitely in a room, he could just make out four walls, a floor and a ceiling – but it did not seem to glare as much now and, in the dim glow it cast, he could see the shape of something with arms and legs and a head with glinting eyes – eyes that were staring right into his.
When the beast lunged for him, Dean couldn’t lift his sword fast enough, and his opponent rammed his shoulder into Dean’s chest, sending him flying through the air and onto his back where he promptly lost the sweaty grip on his sword.
to fucking tell them he’d never lay a hand on the fucking angel; that he had, in fact, being trying his best to help him before they came around banging on their door.
It wasn't the first time he'd seen either of them half naked.  When one had wings, shirts tended to get in the way, so it felt like most of the time one or both of them was in some state of undress.  Strangely enough, Hannah always had a flesh coloured band around her chest which Dean was both grateful for and puzzled by.  He'd kind of just assumed, the first time he'd seen Cas strip his shirt off and let his wings go, that Hannah would do the same.  After all, angels seemed to lack any sense of human social propriety and, to them, gender expectations weren't something they knew about or cared to know about.
He wouldn’t be confused about what was happening forever.  Eventually things would settle, he would find patterns and would know what was normal for him and what was not.  He would grow in to this new skin and be comfortable in it; he just needed to give himself some time.  And learn to ask for help when it was offered by those more adept at these new thoughts and feelings than he was.
Dean cleared his throat and stood, taking a few steps over to the hulking monster that had almost killed them and leaned over the thing with a frown, doing his best to ignore the twinge in his chest.
Castiel nodded up at Dean from within his layers and layers of bulky clothes, smiling when Dean did.
She had a soft voice but the lines around her eyes spoke of a hard life and she had an accent Dean had never heard before – not surprising – sounding like something between French and Russian.  It was strange but melodic, but then again maybe that was just her voice.
Dean hiked his backpack – which they had filled with some food for lunch – higher on his shoulders, glanced back with his eyes on the trail, and winced at the poor little pulverised baby plants.  Maybe he could fill some of the more used trails in with flat stones or gravel so he didn’t feel like he was crushing an entire biome under his lumbering, ape-man feet every time he went for a walk.  And he might have seen some things in that book Cas gave Sam – it had just been
There was real reverence in Castiel's voice, among a slew of other things that Dean couldn't put a name to.  Despite all that he had been through at the hands of his Father, Cas still had a flicker of adoration in his eyes when speaking his name.
Cas' wings were arched up over his back in a position Dean had learned meant he was ready to spring at a moment’s notice.  He tried his best to keep quiet, but he was used to doing his sneaking around in jeans and a flannel, not stiff leather and bulky fur.  He hoped the leather would soften with constant use.
“I’m so glad you’re home, Cas,” he whispered into the slumbering angel’s hair.  “I’m so fucking glad you’re home.”
Dean hissed and grabbed it back out of Cas’ hand, tightening his grip around the angel's waist so he didn't crumple to the floor, shoving it back in to the holster around his torso.
Cas didn't seem to care either way, he simply kept walking, right over to where Hannah was still sitting in the sand, and dropped to the ground beside her without any of his usual grace.  It held a note of something like petulance, like a child unhappily admitting they'd been wrong.
“Thank you for the information,” Castiel interrupted quickly.  “We will stay east of the river on our way through.”
until they get back.”  She looked frightened, but no less stubborn than Dean had in that barn when he’d plunged that demon blade into Castiel’s chest.  She shifted the gun again, as if to get a better grip on it.  “
He rolled his shoulder gingerly, wincing a little but grabbing his change of clothes and heading for the bathroom.  A moment later, steam was billowing under the door and Dean was shoving the bottle of Tylenol to the bottom of his own bag.
“Nothing,” Sam answered, too quickly, “I’m just…still surprised you read all the links I forward to you.”
Dean woke before his alarm again the next morning and a smile was already on his face because his arms were full of angel. Cas was sound asleep, his breath hot and steady against the side of Dean's neck. One arm was draped across Dean's stomach, heavy and warm and under the blankets their legs had tangled together.
Cas spent a lot of time in the bunker these days and if Dean didn't know any better he would say that it was likely the most safe and obsessively warded place in North America.  Surely having a part of your body in another dimension all the time would get uncomfortable, so why did Cas never stretch his wings while he was there?  His stomach sank.  Was it
The jaws stayed away, but he imagined he could feel hot breath, as humid as jungle air, radiating behind him like a threat.  And still, as ever, the searing drag of the binding across his skin lingered.
been monsters in disguise so he could just shoot them and get back to making sure Cas didn’t need to go to the hospital.
“Alright, stew it is!  As for something to chase away the cold, we've got some Alto wine and a little ale left.”
Staring down at the tip of his blade, he imagined ramming it straight through his own chest; saw in his mind’s eye the implosion of light and the scorched wing marks on the wall behind him.  He thought of how
Which meant his muscles were aching, there was a headache throbbing dully behind his eyes and his mouth felt and tasted like he'd slept with a dirty sock in his mouth.  If he didn’t know any better, he’d swear he was hung over.
“Alright?” Liam asked sincerely and when Cas gave him a tiny nod he clapped his hands together, looking delighted that Cas had accepted his gift. “Excellent, why don’t you show me to the kitchen and we can all enjoy a hot cuppa?”
With the way Sam was watching him now – like Castiel was a particularly obscure and fascinating tome he’d just discovered in the bowels of the bunker – Castiel wished for the first time that Dean
He refocused, pushing the echo of that harrowing loss deep down and out of the way where it belonged.
There was no time to even panic about how fast the earth was disappearing under them because, seconds later, the last thing Dean was worried about was keeping his eyes open.
He felt like a piece of garbage when he thought things like that, when he got jealous – because that's what it was – of what Hannah had with Cas; what he
Dean had some gentle rock playing low on the radio and he could see Sam’s headlights close behind them in the mirror.
He followed the path down to the water, the sound of it drowning out his movements despite the fact that he was purposely trying to make noise.  He hated the look in Cas’ eyes when he was startled.  Hated it even more when he was the one who put it there.  But he got close enough to call Cas' name without having to yell over the sound of the waterfall and the angel still had his eyes closed, face and body so relaxed Dean might have thought he was sleeping if he wasn’t sitting up.
It stared back.  Was is possible for a pen to exude passive-aggressive hostility?  He frowned at it.
"Cas..." he eventually managed, clearing his throat so his voice wasn’t so gruff.  "Cas, wake up, man." He curled his fingers when Cas still didn't stir, barely able to feel the silky down feathers ghosting over his skin like air.
Dean blinked.  “So if they're not interested in leaving their little mountain fortress then why are they even looking for this guy?  Is he part of their group or something?  Maybe they're worried he's out blabbing about all the stuff they know?”
Unexpectedly, it drew Cas’ attention right away, a flicker of something like envy on his face as he watched Liam stretching.  His left wing twitched and then, like someone who’d just seen someone else yawn, his wings suddenly spread wide, snapping out to either side of his body almost involuntarily.
Cas urged the brothers on with a soft call, taking the lead once more.  Being out of the trees in the open road made it easier to see by the moonlight but also left them feeling exposed.  Over the sound of the rushing rapids to their right and the rush of wind through the surrounding trees, no others sounds could be heard. Dean had to resist the urge to swivel his head like a top, trusting Cas to sense anything that he and Sam did not.  He wasn't at all looking forward to having to walk through the woods for an entire night because even though he hunted monsters for a living the woods were just fucking
They had reached the other side of the valley, the trees around them much healthier and, the pools no longer had mineral buildup but were still hot, with steam rising off the surface of the water.
It was as if he'd been listing sideways – like a top heavy sail boat rolling in the water –  and suddenly someone shoved him upright again.  His world slid back into place with a jarring slam, shaking loose pieces of unreal things and scattering them like dead leaves in the wind.
“But do they?” Sam pressed, leaning forward to rest his elbows on the table.  He wasn’t looking Castiel in the eye anymore, his gaze flicking this way and that over his wings.  He seemed much more interested in how Castiel was
Dean managed to hold his relieved sigh in but expressed it all the same by tightening his grip on Cas’ shoulder and quipping.  “Was starting to worry.”
By then the sedative seemed to have released it's iron hold on the angel, if only a little.  When Dean laid a hand gently on his should, he startled awake, eyes snapping around blearily until Dean crouched down beside his head in the open door.
As much as he hated it, Dean already knew that.  They would have to wait for Cas to wake up and then somehow find the strength to say the words
the spoken-for angel.  It whispered that he'd already missed his many, many chances and not to fuck things up for them.  But god dammit they were already so close and Cas' pink tongue darted out to wet his full, plump lips and all Dean would have to do is just lean down...a few...inches...and...
Castiel lowered his gaze, told himself it wasn't lying if they hadn't asked.  But they were asking now, so he minutely shook his head, shame burning in his cheeks.
,” here his eyes flicked over to glare at his brother before snapping back to Castiel, “that I walked in on you carving yourself up like an Easter ham!”
They hadn’t been walking for long before the roaring sound of rushing water could be heard in the distance – faint at first but growing louder as they pressed on.  Cas told them to follow the noise, as the road they wanted to be on hugged the edge of the same river they'd crossed going into Riverwood.  Through a break in the tall trees, Dean – who was now inexplicably leading their little part even though he had no idea where the fuck he was going – saw the river in the moonlight, splashing and rushing through the jagged rocks along the shore line.
“Fucking freezing,” Sam grumbled beside him, his hair was a mess and he was giving the fire a rather sleepy glare, arms folded tightly across his torso.
It was confusing, because while there was still a noticeably glassy look in Cas' blue eyes, he was still aware enough that he knew it was Dean talking to him. With a sinking sensation in his gut, Dean wondered if that meant that Cas was scared of
Cas. He thought, after all that had happened, after all they had been through, they more than deserved it.
“That's ok,” Dean assured him, glancing down at where Castiel was still gripping the ruined arm rests.
“A flat stone would do, don't you think?”  There was a hint of a smile around Cas' full lips and it snagged Dean's attention momentarily.
Castiel woke violently, the sound of someone screaming nearby propelling him from his bed with an energy he hadn’t felt in days.  Dimly, he realised that for all the time he spent telling himself he wasn’t going to sleep he sure was doing a lot of it, and each time he woke he was reminded of why he shouldn’t have.
He held his tongue all the same, because despite that, the armor, sleek wings, anoyed frown, and sharp blue eyes almost made Cas look like a stranger.  A dangerous stranger.
He let the calm settled into him, turning his face into the wind.  This was exactly where he belonged, and this was exactly what he was meant to be doing.
Dean chomped down hard on his lip to keep from doing or saying something stupid.  “So – do they – I mean, is it weird not being able to hide them away?”
Sam blinked around with a bleary, bemused expression, his fingers clutching at the book in his hands reflexively.  A split second later, when he realized nothing was trying to kill them, he sunk back down against the seat and pulled a breath through his nose, eyes already looking droopy.
me by a white witch.  I had known her for ages and expressed my disappointment that I felt my life would be coming to an end much too soon and that I still had so much work I wanted to do.  She offered me a solution.”
When they got to the living room, Dean was already sitting on the sofa, his legs sprawled across the coffee table.  He rolled his head to look when Sam and Cas entered the sitting room, then threw up his hands with his fingers waggling in the air.
A massive, glowing moon hung in the sky over their heads, so close that he could see its crater-marked surface in much more detail than he'd like.  Right next to it was a smaller moon and their combined light was flooding the landscape around them.
And anyway, lately Dean’s thoughts had drifted more towards the kind of things Bobby used to do, with his vast library and many phones.
in a way that made Dean's heart pound and ache.  Because it was cautious trust; faith based on nothing more than a flimsy foundation of odds that they hadn't hurt him
Dean blinked.  “Well...I dunno...here,” he picked up the empty tool kit.  “Fill this.  No more than what can fit in here, though, ok?” he added firmly, handing the kit over and eyeing the two giant piles of wood behind him.
“Talk about what?”  Castiel bluntly asked him, his face unreadable.  His wings were tight against his back again, which meant the inscrutable body language was completely intentional; he intended to give nothing away to Dean at all and Dean supposed he had that coming.
Unfortunately for all of them, that was the moment the brothers chose to walk back in to the kitchen.
Cas – had made.  But for some reason Cas didn't seem all that worried about it, which, for some reason, only made Dean feel like this was more his fault than the angel's.  After all, Cas was kind of oblivious when it came to social norms and expectations.  Though, he wasn't so naive that he'd think a kiss – and certainly not a kiss like
In all honesty, Dean was somewhat mesmerised by this new side of Cas – it was like seeing a majestic Doberman roll over and show you its belly – and he could have easily sat and observed the angel sleeping for a while longer but…well he was already feeling pretty creepy about the watching he’d already done and they had places to be and people to hunt down.  So, he pushed at Cas' wing insistently until Cas groaned and pulled it against his back on his own, rolling to his knees and folding the other.
This was different, he realized for what felt like the hundredth time since they’d gotten here.  This wasn't like anything they’d ever done before.  Sure, they knew how to kill monsters...with guns and knives and sometimes a little magic.  And they’d killed more monsters than he could ever hope to keep track of. But this...this was different.  Somehow. In a way he couldn’t quite put his finger on and it left him shaken by something other than the fading adrenaline.
knowledge on angels but only that which I could get from books and legends.  So I brought them inside, made them as comfortable as possible, and hoped for the best.  I kept them safe and, eventually they came around enough to tell me how to help them start to heal.”
Sam turned back to him, his gaze as determined as ever.  “Cas, how do angels talk to each other?  How do you communicate what you think and feel to other angels?”
He hugged his blade to his chest for a moment, just breathing, trying to settle his mind in the hopes that maybe he wouldn’t have to do this at all if he could just
All three of them hedged away from the left side, not wanting to get wet, but they all took a moment to lean over the railing on the right side, staring out over the tops of the tall pine trees dropping away below them and the thick haze curling overhead.
to it, almost like blasphemy, that cut down deep into your gut and tugged like it intended to rip your intestines out through your belly button.
“Sir, are you alright?” the shorter one asked Castiel, his voice marginally less intimidating than the tall one’s.
Yesterday, Dean had had to say, out loud, that when it came to Cas, he’d been less of a friend and more of a slave driver.
Castiel scowled and surged back against the invading emotions that were trying to cut him down at the knees.
to communicate is something Castiel had probably only done a handful of times before he met you two.”
His brother nodded and then they were climbing in to the Impala, because no way was Dean taking anything but his baby to go rescue his angel.
On the other side of his wing, Dean felt like a pillar of ice.  Castiel imagined the ragged emotions and accusations likely swimming in his green eyes and, unable to bear it any longer, finally pulled his wing against his back and looked up.
Dean screamed through the closed window when Cas started pulling at the restraints, sheer terror glazing his eyes.  They wrapped padded cuffs around his wrists that were attached to the side of the stretcher and then an EMT fastened a thick strap across the angel's chest, seemingly not even noticing the fact that his patient was on the verge of a panic attack.
Dean rolled his eyes, “Yeah, yeah, college boy.  I’m just gonna sneak him steak and donuts when you’re not looking, you know.”
He was still barely keeping down a cup of milk and the three times he had tried to take a nap he had failed to fall asleep.  The dizziness made it difficult and, in the quiet, it always became harder and harder as the moments passed to remember that there was nothing sneaking up behind him.
“He’s just fine.”  Why did the man seem set on Castiel being some moron that spent most of his day bumping in to walls?  The hell was the guy's deal?  Sure, Castiel had a kind of innocence about him, but he wasn't incompetent.  All it took was two seconds talking to the guy to realize he was a deadly genius.
Absently, Castiel reached over to his left wing to scratch at a few feathers that were out of place.
Sam shoved at him when he glanced down at the girl’s corpse, the glint of silver around her pale, bloodless neck catching his eyes.  It looked expensive...and they kind of needed gold.
He carefully scooped the flowers up, knowing they were also meant to be dried for tea.  Because Cas had showed Sam how to do that and now they were both nerds about it.  Cas had, on one rare occasion when he went out shopping with them, found a book at a used book store that was all about the medicinal properties of North American wild flowers.  He’d given it to Sam on a Tuesday with a simple, “Happy Tuesday, Sam,” and an owlish blink before wandering off outside.
“We all have different ways of perceiving the world around us,” Liam continued patiently.  “As humans, the thought of someone being able to look into our very soul seems like a terrible breach of privacy.  As an angel, Castiel is merely trying to understand your mood and emotions by reading them in their truest, most unfiltered form.  Angels cannot hear what you are not saying, they can’t ‘read between the lines’ and they don’t like to make assumptions because assumptions can be incorrect.  We humans are riddled with things like social pressure, personal shame, anxieties, and concerns over how others perceive us and it makes us talk in all kinds of ridiculous, elaborate, and illogical ways.  Angels want only to communicate clearly and effectively and do not, generally, tie emotion to information that needs to be delivered, they simply deliver it and expect the same in return.”
At least until a body suddenly fell in front of his face, landing with a sickening crunch in the dirt.
Her wings were sleek and agile looking, and dove grey in color, not a feather out of place.  They looked delicate and lethal at the same time, like a glass sword.
Dean rubbed a hand over his stomach, still feeling like he was starving.  The two apples and three carrots he had choked down hadn’t even registered in his gut.
He stared at the younger brother, the answer lodging in his throat.  They wouldn't like it, he knew they wouldn't, and he didn't want to tell them in any case.
An answering grunt of agreement was all Dean got so he stood and made his way over, his knee giving a little twinge.
What felt like seconds and years later, Dean felt Cas' hand squeezing back hard, like he was using it to pull himself out of the depths of wherever he'd been trapped and Dean gripped back just as hard, crushing their joined hands against his chest where Cas could probably feel his heart pounding against his ribs.
Sam and Dean plodded after him, their own footfalls nearly silent on the soft bed of pine needles and young plants.  Small boulders and rocks began to pop up, dotting the space between the pine trees.  The farther they walked, the larger and closer together the stones became until Dean was having to move around them instead of just stepping over them, like there had been a landslide nearby a long time ago.
Dean stared up at the canopy of trees, hearing Cas wading back out of the water amidst the soft chatter of Cesar and Jessy telling Sam about their plans for Alaska.  Under his back, the moss was thick and soft enough that he could have fallen asleep and he had to wrench his eyes back open more than once.  No wonder Castiel liked to spend the night out here.  It was almost better than his memory foam mattress.  And the smell of the earth and trees was way better than the musty air in the bunker.
Dean blinked, trying to process the new information.  Dean had known Cas for ten years and he’d never once thought to type his name into a google search.  “Er…about who?” Dean glanced at his firmly closed door, his brain lagging well behind the conversation.
the way it pulled sharply at the searing pain and cold helplessness constantly simmering in the back of his head, yanking them up like a fish on a hook.
And he looked twitchy too; index and middle finger of his left hand tapping against the mug, eyes sliding sideways wherever someone walked by or a noise came from the kitchen.  Then snapping back over to stare out the window.  If he had ears like a cat, they’d be swivelling incessantly.
Dean woke slowly, like he was a corpse someone was dragging out of a lake.  Before he was even fully conscious he was aware that he’d slept the kind of sleep only the severely exhausted were capable of.
Cas straightened a little, “Yes, I find the books useful in realigning my memories. Most all of the books' historical accounts are accompanied by accurate dates and vivid recounts of events and that has made it possible to organize my memories where I couldn't before,” he paused and Dean held his breath, blindsided. “The more I am able to order things in my mind the easier it is to think clearly and remain...” he trailed off, looking for the right words. “...to keep unwanted memories away. It's easier not to get lost.”
“Perhaps, after you show me how to make coffee, we should talk about those things you mentioned before. I'm getting better, I think,” he glanced back into the library, suddenly looking annoyed. “Most recent incident aside.”
"I wish I could still see like I used to," Cas grumbled.  "I would have been able to tell you exactly how many were in there."
“Oh, wow, yeah, ok.  You’re eyes just went like…coal grey and then dark blue.  I think.  It changed really fast.  Do you know what’s happening, Cas?  Is that normal?”
Castiel strode past him, Sam and the fire, walking off into the mist with the air of someone who wanted very much to get away from a situation they did not know how to handle and Dean looked to Sam out of habit for reassurance that his brother was seeing the same thing he was.
He pulled his hand back and left the glass sitting there next to Sam’s and both of them retreated to their rooms.
“I just mean that making potions looks a lot like making cookies or soup or something.”  Dean shrugged.  “You might like it.”
“We had freedom once,” Castiel continued.  “We could walk the Earth and be trusted to go where we were needed without,” he glanced sideways, “Without someone breathing down our necks.”  He sighed heavily, flexing his wings like he only just realized how stiffly he was holding them.  “And then, one day, everything changed.  We were...dragged back to heaven.  All at once, without the courtesy of even a summons.  It was the first act against us that took away our free will and we never got it back.”
As if the magical chains around him had suddenly been cut, Castiel felt his grace flood him like the valley below a ruptured dam.  It was formidable and violent, and he latched on to the swell of power and rode the wave, drinking in the feeling of being
Just as Dean picked up his phone it rang in his hand and Sam's name popped up on the screen.  "What's up, Sam?"  he answered.
A shy, hesitant smile suddenly pulled at Cas' full lips and hit Dean like a punch to the sternum. His wings pulled in more, folding loosely against his back as Cas slinked back up onto the bed.
Sam was smiling fondly, shaking his head before looking away and poking at the fire with a long stick.
– see it proven in his lifetime.  He especially hadn't expected the proof to be so casually shoved in his face, as if it were no big deal.  Though, to Cas, it probably wasn't.  He started to wonder how many other worlds Cas just flew off to in his spare time, but thoughts like that opened a rift in his mind that was full of ever-expanding, black, infinite, space and, with a sickening tug in his gut, he forced those thoughts away.  His mind had been much too bored for much too long and the last thing he needed was an existential crisis.
was written in a looping scrawl at the top of the parchment and Dean tried to take in as much information as possible.
Hey, so last chapter is up!  Let me know what you thought!  Sorry, I know there are probably spelling mistakes but I'm at the end of a four hour plane ride and I've read through it a billion times already.  If you spot any, feel free to let me know so I can fix them.
Instantly, the hand dissolved into a gleaming shackle and sickly sweet laughter slithered into Castiel's ear.
Cas stood between the effigies, running a hand over the iron claps that were keeping the gates closed before giving a little push at the doors.  They didn't so much as budge, which meant they had probably been magically sealed.  Even so, he gave up quicker than Dean probably would have, gesturing for the brothers to follow as he skirted the skewered corpse and continued following the wall into a stand of pine trees.  The wall curved sharply to the right and, on their left, the base of a small, rocky hill boxed them in.
“Of course, Cas,” he told the sand disappearing under his feet.  His felt his cheeks warm and shoved his hands in his pockets.  “Of course I like seeing you happy.  I've seen you hurting too many times,” he added quietly.
plane of existence, so he has them out most of the time because it feels better.”  He didn’t turn around, kept looking and walking forward so that the likely harsh expression of his face would not sharpen his words further. “No staring, touching or stupid questions about the wings, capisce?”
“Yeah,” Dean scoffed, “It’s surreal.  Even though we've been here for like, what?  A week?  Two?  Feels like six months have gone by.”  he shook his head.  “We're on another
Dean nodded, visibly relieved in the way his shoulders relaxed and he sat back in his chair.  He fixed his eyes intently on Castiel.
Able only to scream against the invasion, Castiel lost track of his vessel; he only knew he’d collapsed because of the jarring impact of hitting the floor.
And Dean looking happy and acting silly was infinitely more interesting than the dusty and crumbling tome on the table in front of him at the moment.
Cas had insisted the brothers take the beds, telling them that his wings were softer and more comfortable than any mattress.  After an almost-argument, Dean relented but still suspected Cas just didn’t want to give up his place by the fire.
Crowley was looking from one brother to the other through narrowed eyes, “You two idiots have been BFFs with an angel for what now? Ten years?  And you don’t know a damn thing about the species, do you?”  He shook his head.
, Dean told himself.  He sighed sharply through his nose, already able to feel Sam's concerned gaze on the back of his head.
For a moment longer, Dean's eyes lingered on him, then he turned back to the pot on the stove and stirred.
The terrible conversation faded away and his awareness condensed into a single point of focus: redrawing the sigil before he lost himself under the crushing strength of the binding.
That massive, trembling force was rising up in Dean’s chest again.  The one that made him want to burn this place to the ground.  The one that wanted to wrap Cas in his arms and snarl at anyone that got too close, but Dean wrestled it in to submission because, in this, he had to stay logical.  He had to not let his rage and protectiveness run the show or it would only end up hurting them all more.
Dean bowed his head at that, a laugh bubbling up from deep in his chest, and looked back up again to see that Cas had taken a step back and was staring down at where his toes peeked out from under the ratty hem of Dean's old jeans.
Cas, one the other hand, spotted a seagull nearby and suddenly snapped his wings out rigid and rolled to the left, slipping sideways like a banking fighter jet.
He struggled for control, feeling his grace trying to fight back.  It crackled along his synapses and sparked from his fingertips, eager to fight and claw and bite.  His grace – his
Castiel smiled, “A very good question.  I use a bit of my grace to hold most of my body weight, otherwise, as you already suspected, my lift to weight ratio would be imbalanced and I would not be able to stay aloft.  I may be able to glide, though,” he added thoughtfully.  He glanced over to where the trees would have been visible if it weren’t so dark, as if he was itching to go test the theory right that minute.
Liam readjusted his glasses and ran a hand down the front of his wool coat, absently smoothing out some creases.
After all the work Cas had done battling the trauma of being held down and violated by the scribe of God here he was being held down and injected with drugs against his will by people who had
“Stop staring at me,” Castiel ordered.  Under the scrutiny, Castiel felt like his skin was crawling and his scapulars began to lift as well.
“Keep talking, I’m diagnosing you?” he read out loud, mustering up a little huff of laughter.  “What does that mean?”  His heart had already sped up.  He knew what that meant.  Who else but a psychiatrist would have a pin like that?
Several flew past his face, one or two bumping into his forehead and nose and he, very gently, swatted them away.
It was lucky Dean was focused on the scenery instead of the conversation, otherwise he would not have seen the dark mass shifting between the trees.
He cleared his throat and stuffed his hands into his armpits for warmth.  "I'm gonna go find Sam," he informed Cas through the wall of the tent before heading through the trees and back to the fire.
At least he had some of his energy back now that he was not in a constant state of being suffocated by his cruel bindings.  Not for the first time, he wondered what
The more Dean thought about the incident with Cas – because he was trying to be honest these days and that included with himself – the more he realized he needed some advice on how to clean up the mess that he – ok, he
He willed the walls to hold just a little longer.  “I have tried so very hard since I met you to soften the edges of my otherness.  I used to hate the look you both would get on your face when another reference went over my head or I said something or did something that you thought was odd.  ‘
Cas abruptly rose up, resting on his elbows and leveling a glare at the hunter that would have been more effective if it didn't come with a side of ridiculous bedhead.  "I said,
Luckily, the Impala and the motel room were just as Cas and Dean had left them and Dean quickly grabbed the keys from his bag and started rooting through the trunk of the Impala that, thankfully, had not been towed.  He made a mental note to leave a generous tip for the guy at the front counter before they hightailed it out of town.
When Doctor Owen came to a stop they were outside one of many heavy metal doors with a small glass window.
His landing was a whirlwind, eyes and wings equally as wild and alive with overflowing energy, and Dean wondered how the hell he could literally be buzzing with energy after eight solid hours of flying without interruption.
Sometimes Dean stared too long, eyes tracing over the soft lines of Castiel's face or the curve of his hip or down the long smooth outline of muscle in his legs...his skin looked so much darker next to those white sheets.
He spotted Cas right away, leaning against the counter and bartering with Wilhelm about the price of the small bushel of frost mirriam sitting between them.  Wilhelm had a patient enough smile on his face, politely shaking his head when Cas offered a revised price, but poor Wilhelm didn't know that Cas was patient enough to win a staring contest with a stone.
“Yes!  Awesome!  Cas, you got your ears on, buddy?  'Cause we're bored and dying to kill something!”  he blurted to the ceiling fan.
.  Sometimes he had helped, sometimes he had just simply not intervened.  Dean could only guess at the kind of mental damage that level of perceived treason had inflicted upon the angel every time it happened, even though the anguish in Cas' eyes hadn't left much need for guesswork.
He cleared his throat, glancing at Sam, who was frowning like he was thinking the same, but with all of the alarm and none of the excitement.
He couldn’t bare to look over his shoulder and check which it was.  Either way, they were no longer wings, but at least they didn’t hurt anymore.
to hear something good.  Because all he could see was the fear in Cas’ eyes when he realized Dean was holding his blade.  All he could feel was the stab of pain in his chest hearing Cas admit he felt like rabbit in a den of lions.
"If you fall asleep at the wheel we might not get there at all, and since you refuse to let me drive the car -"
“But considerably less healthy,” Sam added firmly, shooting his brother a look over the top of Cas’ head.  “And we want Cas to be
His heart was beating in time with his grace, burning so hotly now that he couldn't even feel his wounds.
.  When he wiped a hand down his face, his arm nudged the glasses in his pocket and he froze, looking up at Cas.  The angel had eyes only for his coffee and, moving slowly so as not to draw his attention, Dean pulled them from his pocket and put them on as Sam frowned across the table at him.
“I’m just saying that it’s definitely more noticeable now and it makes sense that they’d work that in to the binding.  The obedience part is already hardwired into angels, maybe they just amplified it.  And the praying thing too.”
It was one thing to rebel on your own, it was another thing entirely for someone to ask you to guide them through it.  Castiel remembered what it had been like for him, how he'd had to tear himself free of the Host and leave behind bloody, shredded pieces of himself in it's claws.  He was probably thinking of the pain he'd went through and that Hannah must now go through as well.
“Finish your Gatorade.  You need some sleep,” he said, voice tight.  “Come on, take off the jacket and I'll help you put on something warm to sleep in.”
“I'm sorry,” he said, knowing that he did not remember in the way Dean was asking him to. “I don't know how long I...my thoughts are hard to hold on to and I can't....think properly, I -” he closed his eyes and tried to focus, the image of pulling Dean away from the rack already mixing with his own memory of looking down at it so recently it still made him tremble. “I couldn't get all the pieces back,” he explained slowly, only now just remembered how he'd looked down and saw shredded bits of his grace still in the clutches of the monsters he'd escaped – that Sam and Dean had saved him from. “There's parts missing.”
Movement to his right pulled Dean's gaze and thoughts over immediately and he shuffled closer to Cas, placing a hand on his shoulder, careful not to touch his wings.  He wasn't sure why.
while –”  his lips pursed in disgust and he swallowed, visibly gathering himself.  “I managed to find what he saw eight days ago.  Seven people wearing black mages robes crossed this bridge and started up the steps and a few of them were wielding what looked like powerful shielding spells and conjured fire to light the way.”
“I’m sorry, Castiel, that sounds terrible.  I can see how frightening it is for you not be able to fight back.”  Liam pursed his lips, looking genuinely sad.  “You’re not used to not fighting, are you?”
Pushing the pain aside as best he could – he was good at that – Castiel snapped his wings out and up in a threatening display, rolling to his feet.
, it was enough to send Dean into a gentle lecture while he watched the worry lines ease around the angel’s eyes.
Dean swallowed, making sure whatever his stomach was thinking about tossing overboard stayed down, and wrenched the door open.
Except it didn't end up being brief because he got distracted by the feel of soft feathers brushing against the back of his fingers and the deep blue eyes Castiel raised to his and then his hand was inching up the side of Cas' neck and how the hell did that happen?
At first Dean had thought that maybe it had something to do with the fact that he'd never had to worry about asking for help as an angel.  If something was bothering him, he could just switch it off - to a certain extent.  He'd never had to ask someone how to make food or be taught how to take care of a paper cut.  But now, Dean was starting to wonder if it had nothing to do with that at all.  Perhaps Cas just had a hard time understanding the emotional side of being human, and things like comforting touches just...escaped him.  There were people that had been human all their lives that struggled with things like that.  Maybe Cas was just one of those people.
There was an intensity in Castiel’s gaze that Dean had only ever seen when an angel looked at a demon.
As it turned out, Kynesgrove was less a village and more just an inn with a cluster of tents and a vegetable garden behind it.
glowing now.  And they keep changing color.  Crowley told me to…uh…”  he trailed off when Cas’ eyes went red again and then immediately darkened to black and then back to white.  The colors were soft, almost as if they were backlit, but still strangely intense with that ever-present glow of grace that softened the edges.  “He told me I should wear the holy fire glasses…” he trailed off, feeling unsure.  There was a lot more demon-y colors in Cas’ eyes than Dean would have expected from an angel.
Dean paused in his shoveling, looking at the vegetable Sam was chasing across his plate.  “'ell is tha'?” he asked around the pie in his mouth.
“Ok, not sure if the disbelief in your voice is more insulting to me or her but either way…she's right, you know.”
It was heartbreaking, the vulnerability Dean could see now underneath that angelic mask.  The way Cas couldn't quite seem to keep his nerves steady now that he realized that Dean
Well, except that one time – but he hadn’t done that again.  He wouldn’t have.  Not after what happened last time he went home with someone.
Dean frowned, not at all ok with the fact that Cas was obviously trying to hide his unease, leaning in to Sam because he couldn’t quite smother the anxiety of two new hunters being close by.  He wondered if maybe he should take them back to the bunker, that niggling sense that he’d betrayed something just by bringing them here coming back full force.
Hot blood splashed across the side of Dean's face just as he swung his machete, taking the head off one brown-haired vampire, and threw his elbow over his shoulder, hearing a satisfying crunch under the impact of bone on bone.
He stopped just behind Cas, standing barefoot and bare-chested, wearing nothing but his leather pants and a grumpy expression.  The fact that there was a thin layer of frost on the ground didn’t seem to phase him.
“It's fine,” Cas took another step back, his wings ruffling briefly, the feathers all realigning themselves.
The brothers lifted him from each side and held him steady until Castiel was sure his shaking legs would support him.
It had been coiled around the peak of a mountain, partially obscured among the clouds, concealed well enough that Castiel hadn’t even been aware it was there until he was flying alongside an eye twice as wide as his wingspan.  The oblong pupil had narrowed, watching him, and it had suddenly felt as if he was falling.
Cas' chin tilted up almost imperceptibly and his eyes rolled sideways at the same time Hannah's did.  They appeared to confer silently with each other until -
They’d hidden the angel blade in a warded box, in the electrical room, inside a crate of odds and ends and old wires.  But Cas’ words kept replaying in his head over and over.
“No,” Dean carefully replied, trying to read Castiel’s body language.  “Most of the bunker is underground, Cas, you know that.”
He cleared his throat, stomach cramping, wondering if calling Cas ‘he’, especially after Cas had pointed out that it wasn’t accurate, had bothered him…er, them.
It was deep and so dark that it was impossible to see farther than a few feet inside, and there was a barrel placed outside.  On top, there was a glass lantern that was lit with a small candle inside as if to welcome travellers into the shelter or its walls.  Just a bit farther away, in some bushes, there was an overturned wagon that was partially overtaken by a snowdrift.
"You want me to go see if they have towels or something?" he asked, coming to stand beside the angel.
“You’ve been cooking non stop for weeks,” said Sam.  He smiled and it only looked sad.  “Let me go pick up some pizza or something.”
