“Lovely. Tea’s on,” the detective intones.
“I wouldn’t have minded,” Sherlock says. “If you’d...” He gestures vaguely. “With her.” For some reason the indifference in his tone stings.
Sherlock disappears. The neighborhoods of Boston aren't large enough that two people whose movements are approximately similar shouldn't run into one another at least once in four months, but there is a distinct lack of certain tall, dark-haired madmen come October. This bothers John more than it should.
“Yes,” John says after a long pause, “but I would.”
“Who is he?”
John’s pager goes off. Great. “Fine,” he hisses, seizing his jacket. “I’m working late. Don’t stay up.”
Here I am back with another chapter!
Things are still weird, but after one evening in which John is stressing over a bunch of reports Sherlock seems to bounce back slightly from whatever disturbingly subdued state he was in. He’s still uncomfortably polite with John, but he moves around much more often and even starts taking cases again.
There it is again.
“FINE!” John bellows, and practically flies out of his chair to grab his keys and wallet. Out of sheer, infuriating habit, he stops two paces from the door and turns towards his roommate, who’s glaring murderously at the upholstery. “Need anything?” he asks before he can stop himself. Why he’s catering to and endorsing Sherlock’s laziness in the first place is anybody’s guess.
“Oh, for god’s sake!” This man is going to be the end of him. John pauses in the middle of the room, taking several calming breaths, and runs a hand over his face. Then, “Sherlock. You need
“How d’you have service up here?” John inquires, which if you think about it really isn’t the salient point.
The Holmes family is proving to be the strangest bunch John’s ever encountered—he doesn’t even want to meet the parents, or any additional siblings. For the world’s sake, he hopes there are none. “I mean, it actually is a childish feud?” he asks the two large children having a standoff in front of him.
If he’s being honest, John searches the news for the next couple of weeks, wondering if there will be any word of Sherlock Holmes. Nothing comes to light. A Google search yields no relevant results, and John spends more time curious about this mystery man than he cares to admit.
he could stand there in front of a man with a gun, impassively criticizing how poorly the murder attempt was executed, is beyond John’s comprehension.
“Keep up with
Sherlock scoffs.
John's mum dies.
“You aren’t religious,” Sherlock points out mildly. “Your mother tried to coerce you into church, but you're too pragmatic to believe in—” He flicks his fingers vaguely. “That.”
"The sun sets at 5:15. It’s only 4:30, and they have ample time to fix it. Shouldn’t be too difficult.”
“It’s not important. I’ve deleted it.”
“As ever, I’m concerned about you.”
“In a manner of speaking,” the gunman replies to Sherlock, still aiming at John.
John is startled. “Please what?”
Sherlock slams the door in his face.
“I don’t like toast,” Sherlock complains like a whiny toddler.
Everything changes on a rainy October afternoon. John’s riding the T to get lunch when Sherlock boards and seats himself next to John. “Hello,” John says.
“You know this is Boston, right? ‘Affordable’ isn’t exactly part of the equation.”
Nope.
“You’re so sick you can’t even properly insult me,” John points out. “Lie down.”
John is home... “No,” John says firmly. He reaches for the doorknob before realizing what exactly he's about to do. Bursting in unannounced on his roommate in the bath probably won't end well for a myriad of reasons. So, flexing his fingers, John shoves his hands in his pockets and storms back into the kitchen.
John has a lot of questions. He arranges them in order of priority. Placing his cup safely on the table beside him, he addresses his first concern. “I'm sorry, but I have to ask. How many legs did that dog have when you found him?”
John runs a hand over his face. "How is he?”
John manages to take the exit and realizes that they are now 20 miles from his apartment. Sherlock is right, though; he has nothing better to do, and frankly, ever since Greg has gotten preoccupied with his police officer girlfriend, John has had little with which to occupy himself in his hours off of work. “So, you’re British too?” he asks a few minutes later, referring to Sherlock’s accent.
More domestics and Sherlock being nice.
Brilliant. Bloody brilliant, the whole lot of them. He
Sally shakes her head.
It’s Sherlock, who is still in a feverish stupor, and as John opens his mouth to ask if he’s alright, the detective inexplicably reaches over and takes John’s hand, as though asking for comfort. John doesn’t know what to say, so he gives Sherlock’s fingers a quick squeeze.
“Bored.”
“How’s Mike?”
“Did you take it?”
“I have a quadruple suicide to investigate. Hand me my laptop.”
It takes two months before John is ready to move out and find a not-insane roommate.

“Enough,” John says firmly, shoving Sherlock away.
his family. It’s marvelous.
“I’ve kept them in the bathroom,” Sherlock informs him mildly. “You needn’t carry on, I’ve put the Purell next to them on the sink, in case of infection. Though your hypochondriac tendencies are verging on the extreme.”
“You’ve already stated the fact of the matter, which is that I did indeed—”
(See the end of the chapter for
“And leave your ailing patient to die alone?”
“The most dangerous man you've ever met, and not my problem right now.” The T comes to a stop; Sherlock unfolds from the seat. “We’ll meet at your office tomorrow evening. Seven o'clock.”
“Yes, I’ve been hearing about your concern.” Sherlock hops off the couch and moves the bulletin board out of the way, intentionally cuffing the man in the shoulder with it.
John recounts their multiple meetings. When he finishes, Mike is beaming. “What?” John asks somewhat defensively.
The hospital. And Mycroft.
“Get out, then!”
bathtub
“Oh, he's great at sex, but his pillow talk is a little weird.”
“John Watson,” John says. “Uh, is there anywhere in particular I should be going?”
“I suppose I'm not accustomed to it,” Sherlock mumbles as his eyes drift shut.
John furrows his brow. “Sorry, what?”
John frowns. “No. What are you going to do?”
Defeated, John flops down on the couch and laments the fact that he is officially old. “At least tell me something useful about my future  roommate,” he groans.
John could, should, turn and run. Make an excuse, back out, call 911. But he also doesn’t want to leave someone to be potentially murdered. While he hasn’t had military training, he grew up in a rough area and knows how to fight, and he was certainly never one to stand down.
“I know,” John sighs. “I know.”
John keeps a straight face. “I didn’t say anything.”
“Your date. He’s on a ‘business trip’ to Chicago, things have been on the rocks for awhile, and she’s trying to blow off some steam. Don’t act like you had no misgivings.”
“What?” John splutters. “No, never. Never. He—we aren’t dating. I’m single, very single,” he emphasizes.
“I assume you’ll be looking for a roommate, and I’ve got my eye on a nice little place in central Boston. Together we ought to be able to afford it.” His eyes are still trained on the screen.
John is leaving work late when he hears an unmistakable voice echoing from down the street.
“I had
“Send her in here.”
His companion doesn’t look up. “My brother works for the government,” he says offhandedly, as though that answers anything.
“I’m sorry.”
“Yeah.” Then John actually imagines them. “No. God no.”
“Oddly enough, no.”
“Hey,” he says. “You okay?”
him to kill you?”
Sherlock doesn’t even bother to respond.
to not want rotting livers next to my toothbrush—”
“Oh,” Sherlock says absently, “yes. That.”
“It’s imperative.”
“I'm fine,” the detective snaps when John asks if he's feeling alright.
“Oops,” she giggles. John clenches his fists.
Sherlock retreats maybe two inches, so he's not breathing in John’s ear quite as much, and falls silent for an entire 45 seconds, after which he turns to Greg and snaps, “Shut up.”
“Fine,” Sherlock croaks.
“I wouldn’t have minded,” Sherlock says. “If you’d...” He gestures vaguely. “With her.” For some reason the indifference in his tone stings.
Sherlock falls silent, still texting.
John isn’t the sort to cower, however, so he opens the door. “Sorry,” he apologizes.
The poor commissioner looks incredibly pained.
“You’re closer to it than I am!”
John falters. Sherlock is used to operating at maximum capacity—overdrive, really. He moves a mile a minute, his brain is constantly going, and the flu probably slows everything down to the pace of an average human being. As irritating as it is to the onlooker, John has to remind himself that Sherlock is not like the others. He’s a whirlwind of activity, exuding energy at all times. John’s treated severely ADHD children before, and they always make him think of Sherlock. So profoundly, incredibly
Cautiously making his way towards the source of the sound, John finds himself in a small and very sketchy back alley, only dimly lit. And there, in the middle of it, is Sherlock Holmes and a man carrying a gun. When he steps onto a patch of gravel, both men turn to stare at him.
“Okay,” John says. He isn’t really sure what else to say; as roommates go, Sherlock isn’t exactly shaping up to sound like the ideal one. Then again, who’d really want John as a roommate, save for his close friends?
“Hello,” she says cheerfully when John walks in. He can hear the bath splash down the hall and quickly realizes Sherlock is probably in there. “I’m Janine.”
The ski lift.
You can’t even get up without falling over. You need fluids and food.”
“Um... Sherlock...” John says through gritted teeth as the gunman wheels around and aims at him instead.
(See the end of the chapter for
This earns John a disdainful glare. “I don’t joke.”
"Not particularly."
“Suppose I weren’t listening,” Sherlock muses, still texting. “Would that really make it better?”
Writing the John/Mycroft scene makes me want to rewatch S1, when everything was pure.
“Hmm?” John turns around. Sherlock is standing across the room, glaring at both of them. “Oh, he’s just in a mood. I threw out his hamster carcasses.”
The Holmes family is proving to be the strangest bunch John’s ever encountered—he doesn’t even
Sherlock raises an eyebrow. “If you recall our prior conversation, I neither joke nor kid.”
Mrs. Hudson gives him a knowing little smile. “Of course.”
“I can, but I don’t care to.”
“Pull over,” Sherlock commands and, god knows why, John pulls over to the curb with a screech.
“Sherlock. I can’t. Only you can. Your body can.” John feels as though he’s explaining sickness to a stroppy, petulant child. “You need to rest, so you can actually heal.”
This is the extent of their conversation for the next fifteen minutes. True to the young man’s prediction, the lift is fixed before sunset, and as John gets off and stretches, he decides he ought to at least say goodbye to his odd fellow rider. When he turns to speak to him, however, the guy has disappeared in a flash of an expensive looking Belstaff (really, who even
“Just be glad you didn’t get caught,” Greg advises him. “There are weirdos all over the city.”
I don't know yet what I'll do for a posting schedule, but since the current chapters are all quite short, I'll probably post relatively frequently. The first set of chapters operate on a four-month schedule (i.e. John and Sherlock meet every four months) until the roommate thing happens, and that'll change up the pace a bit.
Sherlock tucks his phone away and asks, “Are all of our conversations going to be this tedious?”
Greg looks to John in outrage; John sighs again. “Don’t worry about it,” he tells his friend. “Sherlock, you can get off your own arse, you know.”
John fumes. “Half-naked in our kitchen!”

why—”
“What?”
I'd like to do more Sherlock POV, so I think I'll insert some in upcoming chapters. Next chapter (January) has sicklock. I didn't mention Christmas this year, but I'm likely going to keep this going through til next December, in which case I'm sure Sherlock and John will do something to celebrate.
Mycroft raises an eyebrow scornfully. “You are the only person I believe my brother comes close to loving,” he states as though it’s obvious. “I daresay that if anyone is to save him, it would be his precious John Watson.”
“Is he coming?” Janine asks with a sly smile. The double entendre isn't missed on John, who flares his nostrils and takes a sharp breath through his nose.
“So you’ve said.”
“No, not if you’re going to be a prat to my friends,” John replies.
“I’m a consulting detective. The only one in the world. I invented the job.”
The (possible) fugitive.
While Sebastian is still focused on his adversary, John knees him squarely in the back, then grabs him from behind in a chokehold and wrestles him to the ground, knocking the weapon out of his hand. At the same time as John accosts the gunman, Sherlock leaps: with one hand he’s withdrawn handcuffs, with the other a small blow dart. Sebastian is apprehended and unconscious in a matter of seconds.
“221B Baker Street,” Sherlock says. His phone buzzes; he extracts it and begins typing.
Sherlock looks up and frowns. “What are you doing here?”
Despite the fact that he’s fairly certain Sherlock thinks he’s a blithering idiot.
“So?”
Sherlock gets sick.
“Good call,” Sherlock says idly from the couch. He’s crouched on it again, staring at the bulletin board in front of him.
atop a mountain, halfway upon which they are stuck in a ski lift, and also possibly freezing to death in the cold.
Around Thanksgiving, Greg and Molly have a row and Greg comes by the apartment to complain to John. Unfortunately, Sherlock is also in a strop due to a nasty case of cabin fever, and follows both men around making scathing observations the entire time.
and instead digs his heels into the ground. “Has anyone told you that you’re exceptionally irritating to be around? Good lord, what must it be like in your funny little brain? No wonder you’ve barely maintained a romantic relationship since college, you and your incessant—”
“It slows my brain down,” Sherlock says in frustration, rubbing his pants legs agitatedly. “I can’t
John is just settling down for a nice cuppa when the door swings open, seemingly of its own accord, and a three-legged Boston terrier bounds in. Sherlock comes up the stairs a second later. He tosses his coat onto the coat rack with a flourish, then kneels down next to the dog. “John, meet Redbeard.”
“No.”
“Greg.”
“I haven’t vomited,” Sherlock says stubbornly.
“Obvious,” Sherlock scoffs.
“I have plans.”
Sherlock gestures angrily. “Fix it.”
Thanks to those of you who have subbed and continue to comment!
that upset her, Mycroft!”
“The—do I let him in?”
“Adam called, from next door. Said he saw smoke. Coming from
him?”
“Mm,” Sherlock hums. “Noted. Sugar?” He nods at the untouched mug next to him.
John stands and stares at the other man, still trying to catch his breath. “What about the gun?”
John snorts. “Never.”
“Sherlock, what the fu—” John blusters when he comes home for lunch, but stops still because Sherlock is wearing a hazmat suit and crouching thoughtfully on the edge of the sofa.
“I wouldn't dream of suggesting such a thing, dear,” the landlady says placatingly, though John is fairly certain he hears her titter as she turns her back.
John places a compress on Sherlock’s forehead, encourages him to take a sip of ginger ale (after testing it with a pH strip to make sure it’s not some sort of lethal acid), forces him to nibble at the toast, and drags his chair over so he’s next to Sherlock. The doctor inevitably begins to nod off, but jerks awake when someone touches the back of his hand.

“Your arch-enemy, according to him. Do people have arch-enemies?”
Sherlock still doesn’t disclose the details of Sebastian, or why he’s already had people attempting to take his life, or pretty much anything. What he
“It was for science,” Sherlock explains, apparently switching back to the topic of John’s burnt sheets, “and I assure you, it was entirely necessary.”
“Oh, right.” John pauses and rapidly digs himself into a deeper hole. “Do you have a boyfriend? Which is fine, by the way—”
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” are Sherlock’s positively infuriating parting words. Seeing red, John storms back to the office and doesn’t come home until midnight.
The stranger’s expression does not change. “Always so aggressive. Didn’t it ever occur to you that you and I belong on the same side?”
Posting this in a rush before work, may edit later.
Not really sure what just happened, John nods and the doors slide shut.
has to find a way out, because his weird ski lift friend evidently has some sort of death wish.
Sherlock’s head snaps up. He presses his lips together, brow furrowing in mingled confusion and thought, and starts to say something but stops.

“So,” the man drawls. “Another case cracked. How very public-spirited. Though that’s never really your motivation, is it.”

John gapes. “He was trying to kill you.”

Sherlock turns to John. “Mother. Our mother.” He says it with heavy undertones of

friendly,” John mutters sarcastically.
“Right, yeah,” John says, recalling his conversation with the bartender at the Valentine’s Day party. “Er... he’s alright. Moving out next week. He got a new job in New York, so.”
John, who was insulted the first time he received this comment, merely raises an eyebrow. “Yeah, okay.”
“Did he offer you money to spy on me?”
Sherlock glances up at him, face cast in an odd glow from the microscope’s illuminator and blinking kitchen appliances. He gives a small smile. “Perhaps.”
in a world of plodding, dull people.
The doorbell rings one evening as John is getting ready for bed. Sherlock is closest to the door, but of course refuses to budge. When John, muttering about lazy roommates, answers, he’s so startled he accidentally shuts the door in the visitor’s face. It’s the man who had tried to bribe him.
“Sherlock!” John admonishes. “Give me your mobile.”
He’s only been with Mary Morstan a few weeks, but the two of them have been flirting on and off all year and John needs someone to go skiing with him, since his best friend, Greg Lestrade, bailed in favor of a party held by some cute police officer he met the other day. The timing is either convenient or just the opposite, depending on how things progress this weekend. Either way, on February 13, John finds himself having a wonderful day with his new girlfriend at a ski resort his sister Harry generously paid for (in the form of discount vouchers she didn’t use, because she was too drunk and now extremely single). It's picture perfect and just the getaway John needed.
John nearly topples over. “What?”
Things we have coming up: Janine, Irene, Mary (that's going to be a very dramatic and lengthy matter), a death and hurt/comfort, and general UST.
“No.”
I hope you enjoyed! Let me know if you'd like me to continue updating, in which case I will set up an update schedule. I have about 5,000 words written at the moment, with each chapter short at around 500-1,000 words. However, the chapters will likely lengthen once the scene has been set.
“Accustomed to what?”
Sherlock rolls his eyes and leans back against the counter. “Really. These histrionics are quite unnecessary,” he says sternly. “If you’d run along back to your job, I’ve actual work to do. It would appear that the viruses—”
Jealous Sherlock.
John crosses his arms. “You aren’t even listening.”
John remembers something. “I met a friend of yours, a few months ago.”
“Stable. He was lapsing in and out of consciousness earlier, but they have elected not to put him in an induced coma. Right now he is sedated.”
John won't even ask how Sherlock knew about his connection to Mike. “You know Mike?”
“Shut up,” John says sternly. “If you’re going to be like that, then I’m going out.”
“You were thinking. It's annoying.”
“I have no doubt.”
“John, meet Sebastian,” Sherlock says, gesturing to the gunman.
The reporter checks her phone.

Sherlock appears too exhausted to argue, so he takes John’s hand and starts plodding down the hall beside him. When they get to the living room, however, Sherlock nearly falls over, and John hurriedly gets him onto the couch instead.
“That’s all?” John asks incredulously. “‘Oh’?”
Sherlock appears briefly nonplussed. “Girlfriend? No, not really my area.”
Another actual plot event is coming up. This is more of a montage-y fic, though, so there's no specific continuous plot but rather a lot of different moments in their relationship.
Sherlock hesitates. “I
Sherlock gets to his feet and kicks Sebastian over onto his back. “I believe I gathered all pertinent information,” he says, sounding disappointed. “Open and shut, hardly worth my time... I’ll be having a chat to Mycroft.”
“I expected you to come by much earlier.”
“In a manner of speaking. Take this exit.”
“It's
Sherlock quirks the corner of his mouth, suddenly looking much more human. “Dinner?” he asks rather than responding.
John’s jaw drops. “How do you—what?”
According to Mike, Sherlock is 25 (four years John's junior, not that it matters) and has a somewhat ambiguous family history that left him with quite a lot of money, which explains the ‘funding’ comment. He is also apparently something of a genius: after moving from the U.K., he sailed through Harvard at the age of 16, got a doctorate in two years, and then abandoned it all to go chasing bad guys around the nooks and crannies of Boston.
On the couch, Sherlock sends a text. Everyone’s cellphones at the televised press conference go off.
“Fine, starve to death,” John shoots back.
“He’s already got people trying to kill him, so I don’t think that’s news,” John explains.
Mycroft assumes the same mournful expression as he had during their first interaction. “He’s always been so resentful. You can imagine the Christmas dinners.”
Given that John has work during the days and sometimes weekends, he doesn’t get to run around with Sherlock much, which he’s mostly okay with. He gets a large enough dose of Sherlock’s unique brand of ‘crazy’ just living with the man, who’s a constant lightning rod of untamed energy.
John stares at the fireplace for a moment, then adds, “And we aren't dating.”
John laughs in disbelief. “Are you
“No.” Sherlock is evidently unable to string together a list of acerbic observations, which in and of itself is a red flag.
“Deleted it?”
It starts with the sheets.
“He's busy,” John responds shortly.
“I’m just trying to make conversation,” John says adamantly. “What are you doing here?”
It’s a left-hand exit, which means John now has to change over four lanes of speeding traffic in a very short distance. “Are you kidding?”
“Are you—”
The man strides into the apartment without a word to John and goes right over to Sherlock. John tenses, instinctively preparing himself to defend Sherlock. Sherlock isn’t fazed.
Fuming, John gives the detective one last equally murderous glare before wrenching the door open and storming out.
(See the end of the chapter for
“He talks about you,” Janine pipes up from behind John. He freezes, hands resting on the countertop, but says nothing. “In bed.”
When he gets off the phone, he leaps up from the couch ecstatically, crying, “Brilliant! YES! Four serial suicides and now a note! Oh, it's Christmas! Mrs. Hudson, I'll be late. Put the kettle on.” And, without further ado, he’s gone.
I've set the chapter count to 30, but that's definitely subject to change.
Finally John shushes them both and, standing, holds out his hand to Sherlock.
“Polite conversation?” John manages. Sebastian is advancing on him. Why is Sherlock not flinching? Not that Sherlock has an obligation to care about John’s well being, but how on

“Losing it, in fact,” Mycroft says mildly.
“I’ve been ill before.”
Sherlock shakes his head. “Slight miscalculation with regards to a crime scene. Nothing my brother cannot easily amend, but in the interim it would be wisest that I maintain a low profile.”
“Yes, fine,” Sherlock says primly, wiping his mouth delicately with the back of his hand.
“You’re useless, utterly useless.”

John realizes now that it probably isn’t on for him to be so casual when explaining that his utterly mental roommate is regularly targeted by assassins, but he’s already resigned himself to being treated as though he’s somehow responsible for Sherlock, and in a way he is. He got himself into this mess, after all. And, as he rolls his eyes at the detective and gestures for Greg to walk away, he can’t help but be rather glad that he did.
John turns around. “Come again?”

However, he walks into the apartment one day to find Sherlock and a man on the couch in the living room. Making out. Hardcore.
It used to feel like electricity when Sherlock opened his mouth and made those trademark cutting remarks or rapid fire deductions. Now... it’s just silent.
“We don’t have a moment to waste,” his companion insists and, because he is certifiably insane, John complies.
“What are you—” he starts, but Sherlock opens the car door and is gone. Just like that.
“Come on, I don’t even know if I’m doing it,” John protests.
“No,” Sherlock says as though
“Where's Janine?”
“An enemy.”
the American government,” Sherlock says. “Took it over when they told him to stop meddling in their affairs. When he’s not too busy being the British Secret Service or the CIA on a freelance basis. He ran the FBI for a few months, but found it tedious. Now he’s in negotiations with Russia.”
Muttering to himself about the absurdity of the situation, John stomps over to the Keurig—reserved only for desperate times when he cannot even maintain enough dignity to wait for proper tea—checks for suspicious substances and eyeballs, and savagely shoves an English breakfast tea pod into it.
Sorry this is almost a week late!
“We still have unfinished business,” Sebastian growls. He turns the gun back on Sherlock. John heaves a brief sigh of relief before realizing that Sherlock is now in danger, and they’ve got to find a way out of it. Rather,
“Yes,” John says after a long pause, “but I would.”
He shouldn't be thinking of post-coital Sherlock at all.

“How’d you end up here, then?”

Sorry for my absence! Break has started, so hopefully even with work I will have the energy to get a few chapters up in the meantime.
Sherlock looks up and frowns. “A friend? I don’t have friends.”
Sherlock shrugs, takes the weapon, and pulls the trigger. Nothing happens. “No bullets. Do you think I’m an imbecile? Simple sleight of hand, any imbecile could execute it.” He removes an entire magazine’s worth of rounds from his back pocket.
“I—no. What?”
“Fine, then. Don’t be

“You are not—for Christ’s sake, Sherlock, you’re not dying!”

“My brother was meddling too much in America’s affairs. They threatened lifetime imprisonment, he came to the U.S. and took over the government instead. He is the single most pompous, pretentious, and overbearing man I have had the misfortune to meet.”
Sorry it's a day late! Enjoy jealous John.
John runs a hand through his hair wearily. “Goodnight, Sherlock,” he says, and goes up to bed.
John presses his lips together, then shakes his head and heads to the kitchen to get a glass of water and more medication. When he returns, Sherlock is fast asleep.
“Sherlock?” he calls gently; the bathroom door is open just a crack, and the light filtering out makes him shield his eyes. It’s 3:30 am.
Later, holed up with paperwork and music blasting to drown out the sound of Sherlock and Janine loudly flirting downstairs, John can't help but wonder if Janine was telling the truth and if, in fact, Sherlock does talk a lot about him.
What the hell?
“Lighter fluid,” Sherlock calls as John, sighing, follows his best friend to the door.
“Precisely.”
“Ignite my sheets? This is so
Sherlock casts him a withering look. “I wasn’t talking to you, Garrett.”
“Sherlock Holmes,” the stranger finally introduces himself. He’s texting one-handed again and speaking as though they are not in one of the more bizarre and legally dubious situations of John’s life.
His lift-mate gives him a critical once-over before looking back at his phone. “Not what you are,” he says shortly.
John refuses to respond to Sherlock’s assessment of his utter lack of a life at present, though it’s entirely accurate. “Care to explain what this is about? Are you a fugitive?”
“You were bored, so you just packed up and moved to a different country?”
“Are the cops after you?”
“Sherlock, shut it and go to bed!” John yells back, getting angrily to his feet because Sherlock is, once again, on his last nerve.
“You know we aren't married, right?” John feels obligated to ask.
“You’re dehydrated. If you try to run around, I’m sending you to the hospital.” John presses his palm to Sherlock’s forehead. “Are you still feverish?”
“Okay,” John says, and frowns. “Er... aren’t you a little concerned?”
“Please,” Sherlock begs.
“You aren’t,” John snaps. “You’ve zoned out.”
When he steps in, Sherlock is dry heaving over the toilet bowl, looking so sick John considers driving him to the ER. However, he’s a damn good doctor himself, and dealing with Sherlock in a hospital can't possibly be fun, so instead he approaches his roommate cautiously.
“Just drive,” Sherlock directs unhelpfully. Then he glances up. “Take this turn.” John swerves.
“I am always polite,” Sherlock mutters.
“Did you
Mike shrugs. “He’s a good man. You’ll get on well.”
“Nobody likes him,” Mike explains. “I’m sure you can see why. He and I are on good terms, though.”
The next morning, Sherlock has recovered enough to act like a wounded tiger but not enough to be up and about. Any sympathy John may have had last night rapidly dissipates the moment Sherlock starts insulting John’s caretaking skills.
“I shall,” Sherlock says woefully. “Might I suggest, again, that you look into babysitting, because clearly this doctoring venture isn’t working out for you, your diagnoses are painfully obvious and—”
I had contemplated to add on at the end of this chapter to bump the rating to E... but ultimately decided against. Dear readers, please feel free to explore your imaginative minds. xx WH
“Rosie.” Her father said sternly.
John felt a slight shiver going up his spine at all the information that the machine had access to, her attention now shifting to Sherlock.
Aurora rose an eyebrow at him, as she leaned her head forwards, pointing to herself and shaking her head.
” His sentence trailed off in a whisper when he opened the door and found John with both children in his arms, all three asleep in his chair facing the door. He walked slowly towards John and traced his jaw lightly with his palm.
However, as their little sister grew up she began to try and join in on the twins games, something Sherlock was appalled by, his fascination with their older brother having died when he had begun high school, seemingly becoming far too busy for his little sibling.
Ok, people, this is where that incest tag comes in.
Just as she was mounting over the fallen door, John appeared behind her, mouth opening to make a comment on the mess. She lifted a finger on her lips, the laser clicking off, as she shushed him.
The red chip was revealed to Mycroft, and they agreed that finding Karen would now be their number one priority. Karen had built Missy to jolt a thousand watts through the chip, enough electricity to power a computer for five hours, but would melt the chip to a fine but useless liquid. Any attempts to access the chip would activate this protocol, or if Missy determined that she had no other choice.
question.
As he paused gathering his thoughts, his eyes wandered into the kitchen again, only this time, he saw a man with Rosie instead of a woman. He leapt onto his feet, drawing a small gun from the handle of his umbrella, pointing it at the man.
"I am dead... Mums gonna kill me... Then she'll tell dad, and he'll kill me," he said as they walked, glancing towards their home every now and again, only for his sister to tug on his arm to regain his attention in the direction they were going.
“You don’t need update though… Just say sorry to daddy, he is as silly as you, and dada always love him.”
“No, Missy,” John said, going over to the android, kneeling down, placing a hand upon her shoulder, “you need to this, you have to learn about people and life outside of just us… She’ll get that as she grows up,”
"She's wha, William?" A voice said from behind the two, making them jump slightly before turning to see their aforementioned little sister.
He knew it, but for the life of him couldn’t find where. Rosie’s fault, making him sleep on the sofa rather than his own bed.
“You’re angry.”
"I know that it was the truth but... What if mum hadn't believed you? What if she thought you had thrown a lot of stones at Euros, just for fun... She had more than one mark on her face," he looked her in the eyes.
When Rosa had began to join in with this, he decided that it was only fair that he did the same with her, calling her Aurora. This however had received only ever so slightly more acknowledgement as his attempts for his own name, but it amused his twin so he was satisfied to carry it on.
“And dada apooved!”
Euros stepped out from where she had been watching, seeming to have a glare off with Sherlock, where as Aurora went to her side, taking her head as she gently bumped her with her own, her usual greeting.
She looked down at him, brows knitted together, scanning over him to see if she could find out why he was being so… Loving and patient with her at this moment.
“Making shortie here, Dr John Hamish Watson, PhD and MD, former member of the Royal Army Medical Corps and the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. Born on the eighth of September, nineteen seventy one. Has one younger sibling, Harriet “Harry” Watson. Widow of Mary Morston, real identity…” Her head twitched to the side, a fleeting expression of pain coating her face.
“We need to do something about sound proofing our bedroom… I don’t need Missy acting almighty because of what she may or may not hear…”
“File unavailable, access denied…” Her voice changed slightly, seeming more artificial, before she lifted her head and resumed in her previous voice. “Biological father to one child, female, aged three years, four months, two weeks and five days, named Rosamund Mary Watson. Currently in a relationship with William Sherlock Scott Holmes.”
"No, son, she's not ill," he said, putting his hand on his shoulder as he gently guided him up. "She has been under the weather the past few days, but she is perfectly well."
Sherlock tutted, giving John the closest he gave to insulting looks, at least to him, shaking his head as ran his finger over his bottom lip to keep himself from touching the box.
"Why's she wet?" She asked, seeming to ignore his answer, now looking to her sister.
"You're having another baby... Great," Mycroft cut in, growing bored of this pandering styled announcement.
“Thank you. You may leave now.” Sherlock said as he exhaled sharply, receiving a sigh in return from Mrs Hudson.
Sherlock was tearing through all of the piles, looking for his latest and most relevant clues. Missy had taken it upon herself to organise everything into what she saw as obvious headings and subheadings, so obvious to the mechanical girl that she had forgotten to label them.
John rose to his feet, picking up his daughter, carrying the screaming child straight upstairs, giving a look to his partner, Sherlock got to his feet and followed, leaving Missy alone.
“DOCTOR SCHMIDT!!”
Missy brushed past him, flicking her hair so it wiped him in the face, before opening the door for John, allowing him to get in first before closing it, sneering at Mycroft.
"Maybe you should consider doing the same... I mean... With you not talking, it'd make sense to know how the other kids will think..."
As the two sit alone in their room, the two share another special moment,
“It’s a simple fact, and your fussing and dancing around the subject was being just as useful…”
These men did not particularly look like they are from FedEx, or any courier services in fact, but after knowing the Holmes brothers for so many years, especially the older one, she knew not to mind these small details. Gently she shut the door to unlatch it and let in both men, pointing up the stairs.
“Missy has made a mess, between your daddies,” she said, eyes zooming in on a certain wire, “so, I am trying enable my touch to calm them… Only trouble is I am not allowed to touch Curl… I mean, daddy’s stuff…”
. This was what John dreaded when this war started, he had only seen Sherlock going berserk once, and it started with calling Anderson ‘a piece of shit’. He knew where this would head towards if he doesn’t quench the fire immediately.
Though the twins were often content with spending time together within the nursery, his new siblings seemed to know and, in Rose's case at least, take pleasure in finding the perfect times to disturb his schedule.
“No maiming… No maiming…”
Sherlock spent the next five minutes explaining the series of events that unfolded that morning. Mycroft sat in silence, looking at Missy in the kitchen, studying her every move intently. John noticed Mycroft’s shoulders tensed when Missy carried Rosie.
“Yes, John. I also believe she has a limited memory capacity for emotional intelligence. We need to do this slowly, otherwise she might overload. We also need to find out where Karen is…
She reached to him and pulled him close to herself, stroking his curls as he snuggled close to him, a slight grin on his lips as she he returned the embrace.
The older daughter looked at her mother, narrowing her eyes slightly, sucking her lips in before relaxing and nodding, walking towards the stairs to obey, her twin close behind her.
John held the door open now with one hand, the other was extended towards Missy, a small smile on his lips.
“That one is currently deactivated. It is supposed to contain some information on Doctor Schmidt’s activities while I was powered down. You’ll need her to activate it...” She held her right palm up and showed Sherlock a biometric scanner at the center and a small tip of a syringe peeking out of her index finger, “blood and DNA identification.”
The only thing that was now causing their parents concern now was that the two seemed to be mute, hardly even crying.
"Mycroft, mother..."
Missy was more advanced than any technology available at the time. She could morph into anyone, as long as there was enough photograph references, or if she could analyse the person up close for at least two seconds.
She thanked them as they left, before looking for any sign of its recipient. She sighed when she saw him curled up in his favourite pajamas and robe on the sofa. She smiled to herself, ignoring all his nonverbal cues.
More of a filler chapter, an update and introduction to our two little ones,
As they grew closer to the morgue, the android began to ramble more, John gently took hold of her hand, something she had only seen him do with Sherlock.
"It was only one stone, and it was small... She deserved it!" Sherlock objected, his brow creased in a deep frown.
“Shut up. You…” John’s nose flared.
Children will be children, shame the Holmes ones aren't regular children.
Their father chuckled as he set the two down, ruffling the dark curls on the two.
He snarled as he tossed the file across the room, his breathing shaking with the rage building up inside of him.
The little girls face scrunched up, the tears having stopped during their mothers reading of Aurora's story. She leapt to her feet, glowering at the two
“You are getting old, Mycroft. This is the android. Keep up.”
To Mycroft, this posed a security threat, if she was to fall into the wrong hands, something Karen must have known, which was why she built Missy to have a conscience, in the hope she would learn to have a moral compass, thus enabling her to determine right from wrong. Seemingly there was no one better to learn from than Sherlock and John.
“I will try this then, if it is daddy tested and Rosie approved…”
The twins sat upon Aurora's bed, looking at the floor, she at the slight puddles from her wet clothes and hair, he... At nothing, his mind was too busy racing to focus on anything.
“Is it a computer?” He asked, offering what to him seemed a fairly reasonable observation considering he’d just been woken up over a buzzing, possibly vibrating… A slight blush filled his cheeks, his eyes going to the other man, relieved that his attention seemed to be upon the item on the table.
It was only now that he noticed that the box was making a noise, how long had it been doing that? He knew better than to ask his lover, a tired and over worked Sherlock did not make for pleasant for
“Hadn’t you better get that?”
‘...Hopefully.’
That would be like relying on the criminal fraternity to produce crimes to rate only a seven or above for a fortnight or possibly only a week.
“Mycroft shared my nest when I was little.”
“Of course, I want to. In fact, I’d love to, don’t be an arse. Well, more than normal, anyway.”
Evidence of that came to the fore now as he moved forward towards the distressed man as automatically as he had spread his hands to show he meant no harm.
“He’s a halfway clever little sod, isn’t he?” came a voice from behind them. “Then again, what would be the fun in a pet for you without at least a modicum of brain, eh, Sherlock?”
“But you didn’t know – “
“But you didn’t,” Sherlock insisted. “It was my…my interpretations that were wrong, that was all, that wasn’t your fault.”
“Quite so.”
Sherlock’s eyes, which had been narrowed in the scowl, blew almost comedically wide and his mouth hung open, as if he couldn’t believe what he was hearing.
John.
That and there were quite a few unknowns. Moran, for one, Moriarty as the chief of them. Tessa herself, her mother, who didn’t seem the woman their investigation at their house suggest, whether that was due to the situation or something else…
“Sherlock, what, ehm, what are you doing? Not that I don’t appreciate it, but it doesn’t really…”
“Of course I can. It’s merely that…” He trailed off, unsure of how to phrase it. That in itself was probably one for the history books, at least in the sense that he hadn’t found an alternate phrasing within a second or two.
Whatever else he’d done, and however else he’d made John feel in the last 24 hours, there was no denying that he’d brought a man struggling to find a reason to survive back to life and had continued from then on to give his life excitement and even, dare he say it, meaning.
than their usual bickering. Not arguing at all ever again would…it would probably be the single best indicator that their friendship had died or was in the process of dying.
That was the reason it was scared and why it was trying as furiously and tenaciously as it was, with various method to find the one that worked. Not because it was fed up or angry or even plotting a greater revenge against him for what he had done to it and how he had treated it. Well, it might be, but the underlying reason for them all was that it was running out of time and consequently was losing its grip as well.
“I…you don’t believe that.” It wasn’t an accusation but merely an observation of the evidence presented to him in the Alpha’s face.
The fact that John, his kind, brave, clever John, had listed all
“You did it!” he exclaimed, excitement in his voice along with undeniable pride. “I knew you would but bloody hell, you did it! Don’t let go of it!”
It took Sherlock a disorientating moment to realise that it hadn’t come from him. Nor from Tessa, which would’ve been his next guess, had he the mind to guess right then, and John’s lips were pulled back in a snarl.
“I have, several times in a very short amount of time.” It was an argument he’d raised before but right now he felt it was valid to bring it up again.
Of course, it still technically remained to be seen whether the legal issues could be overcome with help, but it at least seemed possible rather than more wishful thinking than anything.
The doctor took a step back at that. Sherlock didn’t try to hold onto the hand, much as he wanted to. To be honest, it was proving hard for him to hold still at all and not press his hands against his head or pull at his horns. They suddenly hurt. Why did they hurt? His head hurt, too. Why?
At least that they’d come to somewhere that Moriarty had been to visit before and probably that it had something to do with the harem’s activities and that orphanage.
After all, Sherlock had a brilliant memory, when he wanted to remember something, so to have him go over the same spot twice, when it wasn’t a chemical experiment, was more than a little strange to the blond.
The midwife turned to look directly at them, professionally unruffled but with a smile visible at the corners of her eyes.
To be honest, he would be better off if he talked to John about at least the majority of it, however, if he didn’t want to end up having his own plan foiled by John’s unquestionably considerate and sweet idea.
He was about to give his bond mate a kiss, one to communicate his gratefulness for that and the release of some of the tension that had built up inside of him, when the phone rang, loudly, as though to voice displeasure at being ignored.
If he had a problem with that, then he shouldn’t have pursued the man in the first place. He could’ve refrained from his further research, he could’ve ignored John’s asking for help, or merely passed it onto Mycroft, who would’ve had his opportunity to bring the harem down, without Sherlock’s further input.
“To bite, yes, and where to. Not the whys of it.”
He paused the explanation to look over what he had brought back with him from his little quest. Eyes narrowed in perusal, he ended up picking a pair of tweezers and what looked to be a small makeup brush that John had no idea where they got from. Mycroft then, after a momentary pause, handed both items to John, who took them. It was hardly difficult to guess what he wanted him to do.
Both his knee and heel clearly impacted, with a relatively large amount of force, given his position. It should have had some form for effect on the body above him, enough so that he could use the momentary distraction, whether it came from pain or pure surprise, to get out from under the other’s body.
He noticed that John not only allowed him to pull him back in but wrapped his own arms around Sherlock’s waist. Why would he do that? The protection he could understand he’d want, but…
Everything went silent. Inside and out.
...I know, it's an odd place to stop. I didn't quite think about length when I wrote all this but at the same time, I didn't want to overwhelm you with all this explaining. And yes, I know it's written a bit oddly, too, sort of after-the-fact, and I'm sorry...I have tried. :( At least it's an explanation, I can say that.
Of course, there was the entire issue of
John didn’t seem to notice. No, that wasn’t true. What was true was that he noticed, as evidenced by the tightening of his jaw and the tenseness in his shoulder. However, he didn’t flinch but stared straight back at the crowd, his chin lifting ever so slightly, in what seemed to be a combination of defiance and showing off his bruises a little, as if to say ‘yes, it’s there, do you have a problem?’
“Gladly but you don’t need to ask.”
Proportions didn’t need to be something to keep in mind, was the point, and yet, he had, for the most part.
Did he?
“What point?”
However, Mycroft wouldn’t have made mention of this if he didn’t think it likely to be crucial, at the very least, and John believed that he was in the right to take it seriously. It was an unnecessary gamble, to say the least.
He was just another customer. Nothing special but nothing weird, either. Not on the outside looking in, from the point of view of the people working there. Or the other customers, for that matter.
He hadn’t actively chosen those objects for his hoard. If he had, he would remember, as he remembered every other stupid little thing he had ever added, from the first dead bee strung up in a frame to – to the watch that John was even now still holding onto.
She turned her head to look at the Alpha woman, her adoptive mother, but then almost immediately turned back, almost as though she couldn’t bear to look at what she saw. Her little hand found John’s free one and grabbed as best she could.
It wasn’t so much their parents he had a problem with coming or interacting with. They were normally okay. It was mostly his brother that he wanted to avoid, really.
Still, right to the end, she had fought, hadn’t she? In fact, without her, he wasn’t at all sure things would’ve worked out…as they had. He wasn’t going to say that they’d worked out fine as he didn’t know that yet. Far from it, in fact. Things could change so rapidly, after all. Just take the –
As he broke through, the howling screeches of defeat behind him ignored and rejoiced in at the same time, the going got incredibly easier, allowing him to almost rocket through the next few levels.
“By ‘they’ you mean you can’t tell the gender?”
The sight of the dragon head tilting slightly to the side in an inquisitive manner ought to have looked endearing or at the very least silly. It didn’t.
He would do it, though. Whatever it took, he’d do it. Because underneath the uncertainty was fear that he’d ruin it, this unbelievable, incredible thing that he never thought he’d want but now would do
There was a brief pause at that before an answer came. “Perhaps. The point still stands, however. We’re going home.”
He wanted to say, ‘it’s not, how can you say that?’ but realised that wasn’t his call to make. It could be argued that she was only saying it for his benefit but even if that was the case, it still wouldn’t be his call to make, as it wasn’t about him. Whatever the reason, how could he take away what little autonomy she had?
The expression wasn’t for them, either. The man would’ve had the same expression for anyone who came to his door so soon after this had happened to him, regardless of the number or look of them, or even the scent of them.
“Please don’t leave!” The words were quick and urgent, beseeching. “Please!”
The jab wasn’t all that harsh and all it did was earn a raised ginger eyebrow. The elder brother inclined his head in the direction of the doctor in farewell, then turned on his heel and walked back out of the flat, the tapping of the umbrella a counterpoint to the tread of his brogues.
The comment puzzled him immensely. At least, it did until it dawned on him that he kept muttering ‘sorry’ under his breath. Which really only further underlined that he was out of his depth since he never did something like that.
Spite can sometimes propel you somewhere no other emotion can quite manage and so Sherlock stood himself up quickly. Too quickly as it turned out, given how Tessa started to slip from his grip. He managed to slip his arm around and under her, though, and brought her back up into safety and a secure grip.
“I wasn’t going to. I was – hang on, is it…it’s because of the blood, isn’t it?” Something came back to him from earlier at the pool. God, had that really not been longer than that? It felt like ages. “Sherlock was adamant that Moriarty didn’t get access to my blood. Why is blood so important?”
“More or less, yes.” Sherlock frowned. “Why are you so okay with this?”
“John, could you hold on a moment? Please.”
“You couldn’t.”
Right now, John was lying on an examination table, his shirt pulled up enough that the midwife they’d been assigned could spread the gel around his belly. It was cool rather cold as she poured it on and warmed up surprisingly quickly as she dragged the rod across the surface of his stomach.
It was just as well, then, that he could think pretty fast and go through the necessary mental steps much quicker and more efficiently than most.
Sherlock hadn’t made a noise, at least none that John had heard, during that entire incident. Encouragingly, though, the tail had moved a little more and the torso was tilted further towards the doctor.
(See the end of the chapter for
Mycroft was waiting for them outside. Outside the car, too, not just outside the building. The car, which was somewhat larger, it seemed, than the ones John had come to associate with him, even over the relatively short time he’d known the older Holmes brother. Or maybe it was merely that it seemed larger precisely because Mycroft stood outside it, lending the scene more importance somehow and thereby enlarging the car.
The fact that he was now technically free wasn’t much of a point; before he had a chance to jump up, lash out or even just move, he was grabbed by the arm by Moriarty, the grip incongruously strong for a body like that, until you remembered that it was a dragon in disguise.
“Is the coat part of his…his hoard?” he asked. “Can other dragons tell whether something is part of a hoard?”
It was said very quietly, so that only the Omega would hear. There was no need to alert anyone, even if they looked to be alone where they were.
you that,” Sherlock pointed out, though for some reason, his smile only widened. “As you rightly say, you’ve deduced it, or Mycroft has supplied you with the information. That’s not the same thing. So, on that score we are relatively even.”
Or, perhaps it was fairer to say that his anger was no longer directed at his friend because of the aforesaid realisation. He was still angry, yes, but it was directed at the nature of dragons, the circumstances and the events that had sprung from those, and especially Moriarty. Not Sherlock.
Perhaps he could say something a little later, when they were on their way and John was in a bit of a better state of mind. It always seemed to help for him when they were in the process of something rather than at the precipice of it. A precipice gave him time to think, to speculate and analyse thing. Possibly overanalyse, too, which would only exacerbate already existing issues and most definitely not help him.
He wasn’t just worried about what John might think of him in the context of a partner but as a mythological being. A beast, which could, if he wanted to, destroy him in several different ways. Being the partner of that was something else entirely, he knew that.
“Always,” Sherlock replied and there was a hint of a smile for a second or two.
A part of John was offended, another was touched, and yet another lauded Sherlock for thinking of it and offering to help, again. A small part of him, which might be proof that he was indeed tired, found the last sentence oddly amusing.
He pressed the button to the remote control, unconsciously praying that it lit up as it should, all the way through. It had been a bit of an operation to get it set up, as far as he’d been told, and there were a lot of lights that had to work.
Luckily, the reaction was to break down into tears, and he didn’t have the presence of mind to shut the door on them. Instead, he clung to the door as if that were the only thing preventing him from slipping off into some tempest of uncertainty.
It was…it was more than that. Or different than that?
It usually ended up with the younger Holmes walking right back out, after he’d been dragged in there in the first place, of the headmaster’s office without so much as a blemish on his record, which of course only made it worse.
John’s expression as he sang, which the taller teen could mostly see in profile as the blond had finally broken eye contact with Sherlock to look out at the gathered crowd, helped sell it, too. He wasn’t smiling, as such, but there was just the tiniest quirk in the lips and the sparkle in his eyes to convey a smile well, further assisted by the warmth accompanying that sparkle.
“No, you won’t. You’re as anxious as I am to get to the explanation of what the third solution to the problem is that won’t harm either or both of us as I am.”
For his part, Sherlock told John about some of the more interesting experiments he’d conducted which the blond repaid by regaling him with stories about injuries sustained in rugby and the ways he’d found to treat his own scrapes and bruises back in primary school.
“You would’ve been entirely unsuccessful.”
“One set won’t cut it.”
While looking at it, he also kept an eye on what kind of reaction it would produce in Sherlock. Though he was prepared for a spasm or even a stronger reaction, which wouldn’t be ideal, and he would need to stem somehow, he would, to be honest, rather have that kind of reaction than none at all.
Most specifically, about whether or not Sherlock had assaulted him in his sleep. Whether he had…done what he never should have. He could see no evidence of it but then again, John had evidently showered – even if he couldn’t see it, Sherlock would’ve been able to smell the difference, dragon or no dragon – and had put on a fresh set of clothes.
high alert as that of the capital’s airport.
Sherlock felt almost as much animosity towards that Alpha as he did towards Moriarty himself.
This time, the taller man did topple onto the mattress though he did so gently, not bouncing when he landed.
Unless, of course, he thought it suspicious that Sherlock didn’t fight back.
“Tell me what?”
“She will,” Sherlock readily agreed. He took the hedgehog from John and slipped it down beside the teddy bear still just barely peeking out of the bag.
“Perfectly fine.”
John didn’t mention it, either, turning instead to the other Holmes, who was leaning slightly on the ever-present umbrella.
To find John looking up at him, smiling. The smile was sat in an otherwise slightly grim, tired, and determined face. One which had scratches down the side of it, two bloodied welts that started just around his eye and trailed off down his cheek, and a bruise that had bloomed rapidly as it spread dark-purple across his jaw.
“Making excuses for such behaviour could prove dangerous further down the line.”
“Yes,
The former soldier was silent, an array of emotions flickering across his face.
John hadn’t expected the speed but managed to get the rest of the way over to the window before the dragon was out of the kitchen. He hadn’t opened it before, worried that the smells coming from the opened window would tip the other off on what he intended to do.
Sherlock's woken up but something must've gone wrong and now John struggles, not just to find out what's happened but to keep from becoming the next skull on the mantelpiece.
The knowledge that there had been an interest in
“What’s the matter, love?” he asked, gently.
“That wasn’t what I meant at all!” he burst out, sounding as shocked and confused as he looked.
John asked whether it was because he didn’t want the Omega at Whitehall in the circumstances. Omegas had managed to reach the hallowed grounds of Whitehall as something other than staff, so it wasn’t that, though a pregnant one might be considered distasteful still to have to look at, much less smell in such esteemed places. Ah, yes. Progress was a merry dance of one step forward, half a step and a twist back.
"Holmes, and that's all you need to know, freckles."
“Two days old. A van, Renault Trafic. Most likely white.”
“Put the child down, and step away from her, now!” Mycroft was now standing next to the man, pointing the gun to his head. Sherlock pushed the gun down towards the floor, staring at his brother while John picked Rosie up, bringing the now wailing toddler into the room.
“Your mess was making it impossible for me to find data I had not yet analysed!”
"Oh mein Kleiner... ich wollte dich nicht anlügen, nicht immer... es kommt früher als ich gehofft hatte..
At his words, she nodded, hanging her head as she prepared herself, she slowly began to walk forwards, till she was able to put her hand in John’s extended one. The doctor carefully led her through, keeping a firm but gentle grasp on her hand as he led her along to where Karen lay.
“If you cause anything to happen to Dr Schmidt, fatty, consider it you signing your own death warrant… All these delays… I could have found her and be back home by now… Fatty is as slow as his body says he is.” She shook her head, earning a disapproving look from John, where as Sherlock couldn’t help but smirk.
“We really need to talk to her about turning her hearing off at some points… God, she could make our lives hell with what she has heard, and no doubt seen…”
She lifted his head slightly at this, looking him in the eye she nodded, making his grin grow. He suddenly felt his heart race at what he felt he was reading in her face.
“Rosie! No!” John yelled as Rosie threw the skull across the room. She had been annoyed by Lily’s presence and went against everything John said. With a loud sigh, John watched as the skull, Billy, shattered into pieces against the back of the fireplace. Lily started squirming in his arms when Rosie tried to climb over the baby fence.
“It was just a suggestion… If you’re so desperate to find out where she’s from why don’t you just call… Mycroft…” He went still as his eyes met with the androids, their eyes meeting as she had been looking around the room. Her stare was intense, piercing, as if it could slice right through him.
While Sherlock was searching for this name in his archives, John took the initiative to clean out the android, placing it on the floor while he threw out the packaging scattered all over the kitchen floor.
She looked to John for a second, eyebrow raising as she pressed her lips together, as he smirked slightly at her.
As with every other case, Sherlock had pinned photos, articles and handwritten scribbles all over the flat with threads of different colours representing different relationships between data. John was used to it, but Missy was not impressed at all. She had a neat way of storing data, namely her internal logs and storage and the mess Sherlock made agitated her to the core.
Aurora gasped as she felt unfamiliar hands pushing and pulling at her clothes and herself, it was definitely not her Sherlock.
He bowed his head, blushing as he grinned, reaching out he ran his fingers through her hair, making her giggle silently as she went back to her make believe.
“Where is your master?” Sherlock was getting impatient by the second.
"I'm not afraid," he said, holding his head high, making his mother chuckle slightly.
Aurora sat upon the large rock, watching the two boys bash their wooden swords together, dodging each others strikes. She began to run her fingers through a piece of her hair, smiling softly at the red haired boy who had tried to drown her.
John reached his hand and held Sherlock’s, letting him know that he was there to support in any way possible.
Most of the android’s memories were in separate chips from older versions of herself. She turned around and the back of her head hinged open a small window, enough for Sherlock to see a dozen of microchips labeled in years. One microchip stuck out amongst the rest - a red chip without a label.
She closed her eyes as she spun, thus didn't see the little boy until she had fallen into him, knocking the two of them into the little stream, her twin only able to grab and tear a piece of her dress off.
One of Mycroft’s armed guards broke the lock, and led the group into a large ground floor with mezzanine levels. There was only one main entrance and one elevator that led down to the basement.
"Halt die Klappe, Halt die Klappe, wenn du die Klappe hast, musst du nicht gehen... Du musst mich nicht verlassen... ich kenne diesen Ort oder diese Leute nicht... ich will nicht, ich will einfach nur Geh mit dir nach Hause... " (Shut up, shut up, if you shut up you don’t have to go… You don’t have to leave me… I don’t know this place or these people… I don’t want to, I just want to go home with you…)
Aurora cleared her throat, nodding frantically, cuddling him close a she showered him with kisses, making him giggle and squirm.
Next chapter will be a proper one and should be up soon.
” (Glad you asked, Mister Holmes. I want her.) Mr Schmidt replied to Mycroft while lifting his index finger from his free hand towards Missy.
When Aurora had found the perfect spot the two stopped, with her sitting upon a large rock, as she began to play and smooth out her hair, looking at her reflection, sitting tall, acting out her fairy tales in her head.
It had been a long day, as it got closer to the evening, Anthea appeared in the flat with some takeout for everyone. Missy sat with them, filling them in with what she was from what she had been told.
“She hacked Q’s security and left a note. It’s in the file. I’ll leave you to it.” Mycroft nodded towards Anthea before she left the room quietly.
"Well, at least we know she had a career lined up in theatre should she choose it," their father said, smirking at his wife who tried to give him a disapproving look but failed, their attention going to Euros.
, John thought to himself while pulling Sherlock upright. “There’s nothing wrong with doting on Rosie. Just… less sugar next time.”
“Meaning curly wurly here is none other, than William Sherlock Scott Holmes, the world's only official consulting detective. Born sixth of January nineteen seventy seven, one older sibling, Mycroft Holmes, and one… One… One...” Her head twitched to the side again, pain covering her face briefly.
At her words her hands splayed, fingers aimed at each man's hands, before the same laser which had opened the bolt shot out, over heating their guns till they were forced to drop them rather than to scald their hands.
The contempt he saw in Sherlock’s eyes made him shudder, John straightened his spine and marched over to him, grabbing his arm, he pulled him away from Missy and into the kitchen.
"Shelly, please... Perk up," Aurora signed, eyes pleading with him, he merely scoffed at her, rolling his eyes.
"I'm home," to anyone who was there. He stood silently for a few moments, hearing soft voices from one of the upstairs rooms, along with odd noises that he didn't immediately recognise, he hadn't heard them in his home before.
“You failed in short, and are now trying to mislead the people in this room… I have seen the unedited footage of this... Tragic, and avoidable, event.” He turned to address the room, “the android, who goes by the name of Missy, was willing to sacrifice herself for her creator, however was prevented from doing so… It is also able to perform emergency first aid, doing so upon a,” he opened the file, scanning it, “Dr. John Watson, after Mr. Holmes attempted to destroy the android using an electrically fuelled bullet, only for the good doctor to leap in to block it.” He closed the file, Mycroft had now taken the empty seat behind the head, “this also shows that it is able to form strong bonds with people, enough for a man to be willing to cause himself great harm, and possibly death…” He looked back at the Holmes man, sighing. “I think I have seen enough, thank you, Mr. Holmes.”
“Fourteen, and you...” Missy said as a man in a pristine suit walked out from the shadows, pointing a pistol at Doctor Schmidt.
He inwardly scolded himself. Yet, machine or not she looked real enough and was prodding at herself as she looked at his man.
He looked down before, he undid and, took off his shoes and socks before doing the same for his twin, earning a light peck on the cheek, along with a caress, her usual way of thanking him.
"I know A, he'll get over it... I think... Just too much change at once for him..." He stepped back, looking her in the eye, "he isn't mad AT you, though, just everything around you,"
"We've been together forever, why wouldn't we get on? We have another brother and sister though... He can be alright, when he's not being an arse," he said, making his sister bite her lip to suppress a laugh at him using a "naughty" word, "but our little sister... She's..."
“About a month…”
However, he however still saw Missy as a literal walking, talking weapon.
She had tried to get them to bring her twin and friend into the games, and with some of the boys it worked for a while, but the girls seemed to see this as a oddness in addition to her silence, and distanced themselves from her whenever she decided to hang around with the two.
"Mothers not ill, is she?" He asked, eyebrow raised. He may not enjoy school, the other boys were morons in comparison to himself, but he didn't want to allow them the chance to get ahead of him by his absence due to illness.
Aurora's eyes widened as she felt him shift in ways he'd never done in previous pecks they'd shared. She swallowed hard before she lifted her trembling hand up, copying his as she pulled him closer, turning her head the other way.
He stood up and reached out to hold Sherlock’s face in his hand. Pain shot through his shoulder when he lifted his hand and he hissed. Sherlock came out of his thoughts when he heard the hiss, took a step towards John and held the doctor by the back of his neck. Gently he bent down and gave John a chaste kiss on the lips before reaching out to pry Lily out of his arms.
“Ich weiß, ich weiß... Aber wir können nicht nach Hause gehen, nicht zusammen... Dieses Land ist jetzt zu Hause... Der Arzt und sein Detektiv deine Familie... ” (I know, I know… But we can’t go home, not together… This country is your home now… The doctor and his detective your family…) At this Missy closed her eyes, lips pressed in a thin line as she shook her head in defiance.
“What the fu-- If you’re not hurt or threatened, you will be very sorry Mr Holmes.”
Name: Missy Schmidt
“I had a feeling this was a bad idea… I should resign before it’s too serious…”
"Yes, I am Mycroft. A little girl, to even it all out. She should arrive in the next few months... Oh honestly, you can go now..." She said as the two began to squirm.
Missy hung her head, closing her eyes as she turned away, going back to what she was doing.
“Joooohhhnnnn! She started it!”
Rosie crawled into the android’s lap, snuggling close to her as she cuddled her, resting her head upon her chest.
"Wasn't askin you, why's she wet William?"
He slowly sat down beside her, not wanting to disturb her, smiling softly to himself, biting his bottom lip.
A rapid series of knocks jolted Mrs Hudson from her chair, almost knocking over her cuppa in her hands. She was having a restful afternoon, enjoying a quiet day after baking scones for the boys that morning.
“Shhh, jetzt... Shhh, mein Kleiner... ” (Shhh, now… Shhh, my little one…) She said stroking her hair tenderly, as she began to sing “Ist das das kleine Mädchen, das ich getragen habe? Ist das das kleine Mädchen? Ich erinnere mich nicht, älter zu werden, wann war sie? Wann wurde sie eine Schönheit? Wann wurde sie so groß? War es nicht gestern, als sie klein war? ” (Is this the little girl i carried? Is this the little girl at play? I don't remember growing older, when did she? When did she get to be a beauty? When did she grow to be so tall? Wasn't it yesterday when she was small?)
Sherlock examined the box carefully. There was an envelope on top with his name on it, written in a neat script. The box smelled like oil, similar to the kind they use on bicycle chains, a soft hum was coming from it. He knew from experience better than to touch it without knowing exactly what was inside. With that, he dialed three on speed dial.
“What the fu--”
Victor had decided to stay with the Holmes twins after all, he now sat with Aurora on the floor of her and her brothers room, Sherlock having seemingly vanished into their vast back garden before the two had gotten in.
Missy knew Greg had a heavily armed team were upstairs, so made no effort of stopping them.
“The red one. Why is it different?”
She walked back, looking to their mother, hand on her chest nodding as she picked up the "pebble", pointed to Sherlock and shook her head while pointing at the not present stone in her hand, before pointing to their sister and mimed a big creature, domineering over the invisible boy.
"I've been reading up on how people work... You know, since we're gonna be starting school soon, it made sense to... Get a head start on that..."
He grabbed his secondary, secret sketchbook from the bottom of his bag.  The one he used while John was at rugby practice.  He flipped it open and shoved it across the table.  John was still looking at him with panic and slight annoyance (but the sadness was gone).  He sat down and slowly pulled the book towards him.
Sherlock froze.  Footsteps approached at the other end of the platform, out of the darkness of the tunnel.  The voice was awfully, terribly familiar.
John smiled.  “Well I can’t wait to see that.”
He lolled his head to the side.  There was no other word for it.  John looked smug as hell.  All-out 100% blissfully fucking smug.
“Sherlock-” Mycroft warned.
With this the two heads swivelled to stare at the third.  Molly often found it creepy how in sync Irene and Victor could be but she was getting better at ignoring it.
Sherlock whined again as John stopped and climbed off him.  "Not what I meant.  What are you-?" He began, opening his eyes and propping himself up on his elbows.  John however had just peeled off his pants, throwing them to the floor and was positioning himself between Sherlock's knees.  John grinned wolfishly at Sherlock's shocked and aroused expression and leant over to kiss it away.  He then trailed kisses down Sherlock's neck again, this time feather light, and along his collarbone, sinking further and further down.  He paused to lick Sherlock's nipples, earning him a hissed intake of breath and then deep groan.  But John had a plan and so kept going lower, alternating kisses with licks and small bites until he reached the band of Sherlock's pants.  He carefully took it between his teeth and pulled them off revealing Sherlock's erect cock.  Sherlock made a strangled noise and John glanced up, worried he'd accidently hurt him.
important.
‘suitable’.  Sherlock, of course, liked him almost immediately.  They had met relatively normally, in a Chemistry lecture.  Sherlock had purposefully settled himself away from other people, in the top right of the lecture hall, closest to one of the doors
aspect was another
It was strangely calm.  Cars still rolled down the street, a scattering of people meandered on the pavements.  What was he expecting?  Walls crumbling, children screaming, people fleeing the scene?  But no.  Even the sun was shining, albeit it weakly through the clouds.  He scowled at its feeble attempts.
“Guess that means he approves?” John said, only half-joking.
“There’s a Basildon’s Furniture Warehouse and a weird tower thing and Stevenson’s Mechanics,” Sherlock chimed in.
situation.
This was a bad idea.
“Clearly not!  The overriding reception of me is that I’m rude, I’m mean, and I’m a...freak.”  He stumbled over the last word, falling into a murmur.  “Who would even like me?”
“But I
There was no way Sherlock was going to admit he wanted to snuggle.  John wasn’t going to make him.  He could make a compromise though, for the sake of cuddling.
His owner was pacing up and down the flat.  Through the kitchen, down the hallway, around the coffee table, dodge the chairs, back into the kitchen.  Repeat.  Every third or so circuit, he would glance up at the mirror, pause, adjust his collar, tug at his jacket, or run a hand through his unruly mass of curls.  Then on the next mirror stop he would shift the collar again, take off the jacket, and flatten back down the hair.  Gladstone couldn’t tell where the agitation was coming from but the fact that his owner, who the other weird tall not-dogs called Sherlock, was so visibly upset was making him nervous.  He had sat himself down on the sofa (the biscuit lady downstairs needn’t know) so he could see his master at all times and was quietly waiting for
“You were quite a handful getting out of the car,” John said mildly.
“It’s nothing,” he tries but Sherlock’s already narrowed his eyes and was in full thinking mode.  His eyes flickered round John’s body and then systematically around the living room, assessing and sorting, unravelling as best he can.  John felt it in his bones that this was now the time that Sherlock was going to find out.  He knew it before Sherlock’s eyes landed back on the laptop and nearly flickered away until something caught his eye.  Once again he looked between the laptop and John and once again he blushed.
,” Oli hissed.
He was going to ignore it.  And yet- “I am a proper detective.”
"Trying not to flirt?"
His anxiety was not calmed as he saw there was a yellow sign on the door.  His had hovered over it, ghosting the fresh paint.  He considered his options.  Ambush?  Or a warning?  Another trick to throw him off the scent?
).  They dumped their coats in a bedroom—turned-store cupboard for the evening and then went to go join the group.  John was pleased to note that Sherlock had dropped his meditative attitude and was quick to join in conversations.  However, as his worry about Sherlock receded, he became acutely aware of how awkward he felt.  Sherlock had stayed with him for approximately the time it took for both of them to get a drink before he was called over to one of the sofas to join in an argument.  Although Sherlock stated he would be right back, as time began to tick by John began to doubt he would see Sherlock again unless he actively went to find him.
Mycroft tilted his head to the side.  “I understand you have been through quite the ordeal, but I didn’t think I would have to remind you that this is my house.”
He couldn’t move.  He wanted, more than anything, to run forward and search.  To be proven wrong.  But he knew it was pointless.  He had seen the decision being made in John’s eyes, the relaxation of his shoulders, the slope of his mouth.  Had to watch as John dragged himself round, away from Sherlock’s desperate eyes, and push as much energy out as he could manage, triggering the energy swirling round him and sending shockwaves rippling out.
“Favourite colour?”
When they arrived, John was still glaring at the coffee shop.  Sherlock racing ahead like a humanoid bloodhound, he practically barrelled past John and into the alley.  Not expecting anything else, John simply grinned at Lestrade and said, “Suppose you’ll be needing this.”  The other angel accepted the cup gratefully.  His collar was askew, his grey hair winning a battle with gravity, and he looked, for want of a better word, shattered.
of people.  Not a horrendous night for when he was a newly-formed angel but not one John would rush towards.  Sherlock had spent the rest of the day tapping away on his laptop or phone and generally looking nonplussed about the entire event (after he’d had a good laugh at John’s expression of course).  John, in contrast to his usual habits, kept pacing and moving, unable to sit still.  If he was annoying Sherlock, it wasn’t mentioned.
“Sooo, do you still fancy him?” he said, nodding towards the photo.  It was quite possibly the worst line he’d ever used.  In fact he wanted to take it back for being awful and try it again if it wasn’t for the renewed blush and small smile on Sherlock’s face.
“It’s impossible to act casual when someone tells you to act casual,” he stated.
He even tried to forget about it but his transport was not co-operating.
John huffed a short laugh.  “Some people already have.”
“We should probably leave,” Irene stated.  The others looked at her puzzled.  She rolled her eyes.  “Haven’t seen each other for a while.  Emotional reunion.  They’re
“Now before you go in, all you need to know is that this is what the flat normally looks like,” Victor said, producing some photos.  The image of the inside the single room flat showed that it was basic but as clean.  The living area would be first upon entering the door, the kitchen on the left and the bedroom, obstructed by a screen, directly behind.  The bathroom was separate but more of a cupboard than a room, a shower squished in as an afterthought.  No clutter was evident on the windowsills or on the floor, the pale blue bedspread was neatly made and the kitchen looked as if it was rarely used for fear of disturbing its rigid order.  There were only small hints that the flat was lived in at all, a few photo frames dotted around, shoes by the door, a toothbrush by the sink.
He stood up and Sherlock panicked this was less sweet and more stalkerish and John had decided to leave.  One picture was a gesture, a book seemed an obsession.  Those thoughts were quickly stopped when John stood up, leaned over and kissed him, kissed him right there, in the middle of the Quad.  John’s hand ran up and buried itself in the curls at the back of his head, pulling him closer.  The table in between them had never been more annoying.
“Tomorrow,” Sherlock said smiling.  John turned to go, but stopped, turned back, and hesitantly kissed Sherlock, feather light, on the cheek.
He nodded and shoved his hands back into his pockets, taking off back down the street.  His hand found the vial containing the small glowing fragment that was tethering him to his mission.
“I’m flattered.  So go on Prince Charming, tell me what the hell’s going on.”
He reminded himself of this fact when he woke up in a dingy cellar, his temples throbbing and his limbs rendered immobile by the ties and handcuffs that bound him to a chair.  It took him a few moments to realise his predicament.  Whatever he’d been given caused his brain to feel like feeble mush and his memories slow to activate.  There was a solid weight behind his back, something above where the chair stopped that felt humanoid.
Sherlock had taken the direct route out a window and was already in flight.
the solution to the Halden Green case instead of Lestrade.  They’d actually chatted a little bit, Sherlock explaining he was a Consulting Detective and that text was meant for the Yard, then explaining what exactly a Consulting Detective was and what the case was all about, and he did not blush when John texted back that he was Amazing for working it out.
“Do you want me to break in?” Sherlock asked as they stood there, reaching into his coat pocket for the lock-picking kit (
“The human form one?  I’m not sure, got a few ideas kicking round-“
“Hey, look at me,” John said softly.  He reluctantly dragged his eyes up to see John smiling at him.  “I want to spend time with you too.  I already agreed to the evening, you don’t need to hold me hostage as well,” he said teasingly.
“Yep.”
Sherlock sipped his tea moodily.  John didn’t realise before Sherlock that someone could drink tea with any sort of emotion.
Sherlock stared at him again, using what was left of his scrambled deductive powers to check if John was lying. Either he’d become an excellent actor or John was being serious.
?  It was not his usual speed but if there was ever a time to be an optimist…
“Doubt it was a difficult competition,” Sherlock shot back and John elbowed him.
For the past two years, they had met every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.  Wednesday was rugby practice and John didn’t mention that he saw Sherlock hiding behind the trees across the field, still sketching away.  Because of this, Sherlock didn’t mention that he saw John sitting outside his Friday labs with a sketchbook in his hand or the glances tracking Sherlock’s movements as he moved around the classroom.
“What’s
“Okay,” John said smiling softly.
“I’m taking that as a compliment.  I’ll talk to you later.”
"Please," Sherlock whimpered.  John then took his cock into his mouth and slowly sunk down.  Sherlock groaned long and loud as John bobbed his head slowly, getting used to the feel of Sherlock's cock and enjoying Sherlock's obvious desire.  He pressed his tongue to the underside as he moved making Sherlock twitch at the pressure.  Then he slid up to suckle on the head.  Sherlock whined in a high pitch and John looked up to see him spread back out on the bed, hand scrunched in the sheet, the other clutching at nothing, trying to find some purchase.  He took Sherlock's hand and placed it in his own hair, encouraging Sherlock to hold on before bobbing his head back down again. He picked up the pace slightly feeling Sherlock's gasping breaths and pleas speed up in turn.  He moved the hand on Sherlock's hip down his inner thigh and then down to cup his balls, pulling them slightly.  John smiled a little as he felt Sherlock struggle not to buck up into his hot, wet mouth at the sensation.  As Sherlock's cries took on a new note of desperation and he felt his balls draw up to his body, John moved his hand and as he sucked on Sherlock's head, he pressed onto Sherlock's perineum.  Sherlock's muscles tensed as he came with a shout, hot and heavy in John's mouth.  John kept sucking gently, all the way through his aftershocks before realising him and swallowed as much as he could.
In the short lift trip, the reality of running into an old army friend set in.  Since the war, there had been a nice dividing line between those who knew John before the war and those who knew him after.  No one had made the jump over the dividing line yet and this was because John had ensured it by taking a cut-and-burn approach to his contact list.  He was aware that he may be being a tad dramatic but the reality of the situation was that he didn’t want, nor need, the sympathetic looks or pity of anyone who had known him in what he considered his prime days.  He also didn’t want them to discover the life he was leading now after the promise he had shown, didn’t want to have to relive losing his powers over again, didn’t want to remember any of it if he could help it.
“Molly.  We have known each other for some time now.  Please be serious about this.”
, if you
Glancing at his mates, it was clear they were all gone.
“Because telling me would be too easy.”
“I thought you had class?” John said, moving past him to start moving the lights back to their corner.
“Couldn’t.  Too stupid.”  Sherlock picked at the edges of the arm of the chair, tiny bits of the black leather ripping.
“Molly.  Please.”
Sherlock tilted his head in acknowledgment.  “Do you think he’s a Fallen?”
In response, Lestrade hit him round the head with his right wing.  Hard.
Sherlock agreed and they swapped numbers so Sherlock could text John the address.  John then glanced at his watch and winced.  “I’m really sorry but I’ve got to go otherwise I am never getting home.  See you tomorrow though, right?” as if Sherlock had decided in the last thirty seconds he’d changed his mind.
“You’re-”
John blinked at him.  “What do you mean it’s not there?”
“Mike,” Sherlock said with a nod, his voice deeper than John expected.  “Is everything alright?”
So instead of dealing with his issues like the adult he was, John and Sherlock settled into a very haphazard, very unstable routine.  Cases were the foundational structure.  If they were brought by a client then John would play mediator to assure Sherlock wouldn’t get attacked every time they let someone into the house (that old man was determined and
“When?”
“What is that?” Sherlock asked, looking at John.
Well he couldn’t argue with that.  But there was just one thing-
“That’s-”
This in itself was probably why John should be on his way to arrest him because how could he know if he wasn’t involved?  Or up to what Greg referred to as “some seriously shady shit”?  That coupled with the fact that John couldn’t find him on the G.O.D (Great Omnipotent Database- never trust angels to come up with administrative solutions while drunk, they can be little shits and commit like all hell).  Although, if John was a Fallen, he would have kept off the grid too.  Plus, he still has no idea why Sherlock kept turning up while he was at work.
When John got out of the shower he still didn’t feel right.  He knew outwardly he appeared to be his usual self but inside he still felt on edge, as if he was back in the forest on a night Patrol rather than in his own bathroom at 10 in the morning.  What was even more unnerving was he could feel his senses struggling to respond, trying to listen and see on a level his new human senses couldn’t reach.  This only served to make him tenser as his brain recognised this as wrong and began to search for the cause, battling against whatever spells were masking his eyes and ears.  But there wasn’t anything to find.  This was what he was now and there was nothing he could do to reverse it (
“Sure you did babe.”  John grabbed him into a quick, biting kiss.  “Race you back?” he smiled as the sirens increased.
someone had to have taken it.  Now this is where I used your very own ‘powers of observation’.  If you had used the bottle in an experiment it would either be lying about near your science equipment to use later or, less likely, in the bin.  It wasn’t in either so clearly you didn’t use it and that leaves us with someone stealing it.  So someone with access and a motive, leading me to think Mrs Hudson stole our milk so I would have to go outside the flat, giving her enough time to clean the kitchen without me being able to stop her.  Good eh?”  John finished his monologue with a triumphant smile. Sherlock stood gaping at him for a second.
“John,” Greg said warningly.
Sherlock looked tempted to run and find one but instead turned back to the microscope and John tidied up his little experiment, leaving the glowing substance on the side.  It looked decorative, like the innards of a lava lamp.  John had wondered what the allure was and now he could see how it was oddly therapeutic.  Upsetting that this used to be a person though.  Bet they wouldn’t have gone down as well in the 90s.
John blinked at him.  Sherlock was practically vibrating with barely concealed excitement, hands fidgeting and feet twitching as if he wanted to race about the room like a ten-year-old. However, there was just a small, tiny, minuscule detail John needed to clarify first.
“As of about an hour now,” John spoke and then smiled at the surprised look on everyone’s face.
Don’t think.
“I think I have a lead.  Excuse me.  You may go back to terrorising your co-workers.”
Sherlock slumped back in his chair, irritated.  “What do you want Raz?”
He floundered for a minute.  “I guess you could say it’s kind of personal?  The topic is the human form.”  Sherlock raised his eyebrow but didn’t say anything.  “No, stay with me.  It’s nothing weird I promise.  I’d just need one photo and we’d set it up to be this perfect monochrome photo, really classic, and then I’ll do some editing to highlight the different colour tones in the photo?  Of course I need a good model and I thought of you.”  If John could have kicked himself under the table he would have because he really needed to shut up before he outright told Sherlock he was gorgeous.
Backtrack.  BACKTRACK.  His mind screamed at him to come up with something, anything to get them out of this situation.
“Plus, you like bossing people about.”
“That…was incredible,” John said in awe, a smile creeping over his face as he processed Sherlock’s rapid-fire words.
Of course life began throwing opportunities at them practically as soon as the agreement was made.  Cases which involved being squished into very small spaces together such as a suspect’s wardrobe, Sherlock spilling chemicals onto himself and having to wear nothing but a sheet for a week, and one very memorable stake-out where John decided to wear jeans that perfectly contoured his arse began an irritating and regular norm.  Sherlock had nearly let the gang leader escape but figured he could not be held accountable for his actions because if he hadn’t snogged John in that moment then how would John know that Sherlock needed to kiss him?
“I think I’ve made my thoughts on the powers quite clear.  And you’re going to make it up to me,” Sherlock said smirking.
That made Sherlock frown slightly.  Perhaps upset he hadn’t solved that particular problem yet.  “Yes.  I think you still are by the way.  But not from the person on the phone, that’s another problem entirely and not a priority right now.  Unlike-” Sherlock finished as they emerged from an alley between two buildings onto a residential road.  One house was cordoned off with the same opaque shield as yesterday and John was going to walk towards it when Sherlock tugged on his sleeve.
“Sherlock.”  Lestrade landed next to him, quickly crouching down, and pushing him up.  “Hey Sherlock, talk to me.  You okay?”
Lestrade met them outside the flat block belonging to Mr Faber and one Miss Marjorie Lincoln, his neighbour.  John’s initial thoughts were mainly comprised of thinking he’d never wondered how much peach one person could fit into a two-bedroom flat and what he could do now he knew the answer.
“You should listen to him you know.”  Two sets of eyes snapped to his face but there was only one he could concentrate on.
Unconsciously, he dug out the F.A. he’d been keeping in his pocket.  It was unclear if it would survive the journey, but he was bringing it anyway.  He didn’t know why but it seemed important that he show someone.
“I take it as a compliment,” Sherlock bowed his head in acknowledgement.
going to get murdered.
Sherlock was just about the suggest they head back home when Victor appeared from around the corner.  One sweep and Sherlock knew something was wrong.  Very wrong.
, sending them in under the guise that Sherlock was definitely into them and no, of course this wasn’t a joke, how dare you accuse us of such a thing!  This, obviously, didn’t work.  Sherlock pushed away every gender equally and when word got round about what was happening, no-one would listen to any officer known to have even
Two average, short words were all it took to nearly unravel Sherlock Holmes. He indulged in recording the voice for later when he could find and analyse all the nuances of expression but for now. For now it was enough to be able to hear it again.
to Sherlock.  He felt John’s lips twitch and there was a split moment of panic before a hand came up to cradle his head and keep their lips pressed together.  When they finally pulled back, neither could contain a small laugh, and John slowly shook his head, brushing their foreheads together as they simply soaked in the moment.  It was the start, their start, and in that crystalline moment both silently vowed that it wasn’t going to be taken away from them for anything.
“Well it doesn’t matter because I do like you so there!”  Not his finest romantic moment.  John was looking at him, completely blind-sided.
“Oh don’t be like that.  I know history isn’t your strong suit.  And really isn’t history what this is all about?”  He flicked his eyes back to Sherlock.  He paced just behind John, brushing up against him occasionally.  “Did you know he was genuinely a Fallen once?” he stopped, turning to John.  “Made quite the name for himself before he ran away and joined this circus.  Never could settle.”
A voice whispering his name.
“So what do I do?”
could do those things.  It didn’t mean they were rude or mean or careless all the time.  So, no, Sherlock was not a bad guy here.  John just had to find a way to prove it.  Perhaps he’d busted Raz before.  Perhaps Raz was an informer.  John, with his not-so-secret love of spy fiction (both human and celestial), was rather taken with this idea and in the five minutes it took them to reach the station, he had convinced himself that all was well and that there was no nefarious reason behind Sherlock knowing their fucking
The next was how much one woman could cry about a man she had spoken to about three times.  It turned out a lot.
And there he was.  In a conservatory, with sunlight surrounding him in a cosy glow.
“John, I didn’t – “
However, that ought to be on the scale of wariness or perhaps slightly frightened and even then, it should only be frightened of being told off or, possibly, in the more traditionally minded families, a spanking. Nothing hard in any sense and most definitely nothing that warranted…
Then again, would he have expected anything else from who could only be Moriarty?
Granted, John already bore a rather major part of the friendship, Sherlock could admit that if only to himself at the moment, far more than most would put up with. But even so, it would be a rather different thing to ask for it to be so much on his shoulders if they advanced to the next level.
It was likely wrong, to get satisfaction from a reaction that was more than likely instinctual. On the other hand, they were bonded, and if he couldn’t flirt and make sexual allusions with his bond mate, then who could he? Especially seeing as they were evidently well-received.
‘How long have you known? – SH’ he wrote, fingers moving quickly.
“Sherlock. The point.”
He was waiting for them.
He’d wait for Sherlock to crawl back into bed and then he’d go out into the living room and call Mycroft. Then he could always pick up worrying afterwards. He might even have a brief panic attack about it all, who knew?
“Yeah?”
He couldn’t have – if he hadn’t picked up on that then, it could just as well have been that there was a lot of other things going on in his brain at the time. He had not, to put it mildly, been in a state of mind for a subtle reminder of what he ought to do, and that whether he had retained that particular information or not.
Rosie leaned in, watching the android work on her hand intently, now able to see what made her hand work and how.
As the children grow up, the closeness of the twins begins to become as issue for their parents,
“John!” He yelled while taking the stairs two at a time, hoping to find John awake, and apologise before he gets mad.
“Well, hello. Look at what we have here...” Biting her bottom lip as her eyes roamed them briefly.
She nodded enthusiastically, grinning at her, proud her mother was getting better at reading her speeches.
Upstairs Missy sat with Rosie, the pads of her palm laid beside her as she worked on her latest self improvement project, something the little girl she had seemingly became nanny to loved to watch, as the android knew how to explain what she was doing in a way that entertained the toddler and at the same time educated her.
She sighed softly, nodding as she lay her forehead against his, her eyes going after her brother.
"What if... You fought me, for dis on earing your lady?" Victor asked, looking past him slightly to see her reaction.
The android leaned against the wall outside two two one b, sighing heavily, shaking her head, glowering at the taller man. They were being delayed due to Mycroft’s private car being caught in traffic.
“I won’t,” the young man counters.
“I had a husband like that once, always rushing about,” Mrs. Hudson says fondly. She turns to John. “But I can see you're more the sitting-down type. I'll get some tea.”
Sherlock tries to unfold himself and get to his feet. He does, but nearly falls backwards and has to clutch the arm of the couch to stop himself. “I’m fine!” he practically shouts.
"Okay, but d'you really want to be stuck up here after dark?"
“So... what are you doing here?” John continues in a valiant attempt to keep himself entertained. Having acerbic comments thrown at him by a stranger still beats dying of frostbite and a slight fear of heights.
“You need to get into bed. I’ll bring a bin, but kneeling on the bathroom floor isn’t going to help anything.”
“Oh, bugger,” John says when the carriage comes to a screeching halt.
Their landlady, Mrs. Hudson, is a sweet and doting woman who worries excessively about Sherlock, as is evidenced by the piles of uneaten biscuits left on counters and casseroles thrust into the fridge between vital organs. The first time she gets more than a few words in with John (before either he has to leave for work or Sherlock, in true toddler form, demands his attention), Sherlock gets news on another case he’s been chasing for the BPD.
Thank you to people leaving comments, it's lovely. I usually don't share my writing, so it's very nice to see others enjoying it.
and then firmly deposits the cranky detective back onto the sofa.
and who’s who?”
an interesting woman sitting to his left. The two started talking, and flirting, and he came very close to bringing her back with him, except then he remembered his weird roommate.
“I’m sure there’s nothing to worry about,” the young man beside him says impassively. He’s
That spat is eventually resolved. John calms down a bit; Sherlock buys him new monogrammed sheets but pretends they’re a gift from John’s mum, Caroline. Except Caroline can’t afford those sorts of luxuries, so John sees right through his awkwardly thoughtful roommate, but plays along anyway.
That's when John
“We have more in common than you like to believe. This petty feud between us is simply childish. People will suffer. And you know how it always upset Mummy.”
It’s 104, just on the verge of dangerous. “Paracetamol,” John orders, “and try to eat something. I can make you toast?”
It’s Valentine’s Day, and for once John Watson is not single.
Hang on. John’s brain is still trying to catch up with what’s happening right now. “So when you say you’re concerned about him, you actually are concerned,” he states to Mycroft.
aware that your constant and rude attitude is extremely irritating?” John shoots back.
It isn’t as though he and Sherlock were friends. In fact, he’s fairly certain that the longer he spends in Sherlock’s presence, the higher his chances of ending up in prison for the rest of his life, or, alternately, getting killed. But after his meeting with the strange man who tried to bribe him, he finds himself wanting to see Sherlock again, if only to warn him about this supposed arch enemy.
“Better get out while you still can,” the person holding the weapon warns.
The angst commences. Warning for overdose and mention of drugs.
a reporter asks.
John has to suppress a smile. Dammit! He should be angry. It's just that the thought of a post-coital Sherlock blabbering on about beheaded corpses strikes him as endearing more than anything.
“So you just casually decided to use your roommate’s bedsheets for whatever experiment—”
Take another paracetamol, I’ll stay and make sure you don’t end up passed out in the streets, but
Sherlock sighs, “Don’t be dull, John, it’s terribly unappealing.” He spins round and heads for the kitchen, where he swiftly removes two cups from the cabinet. Then he checks the clock. “You disappoint me.”
“Your dinner plans were cancelled, you split with your ski resort girlfriend ten days ago, Sarah isn’t interested, and your so-called best friend stood you up,” Sherlock rattles off. “You have nowhere else to be.” He leans back and drums his fingers agitatedly on the console. “Are you planning to go the speed limit? It would be considerably more conducive to the current state of affairs if you refrained from driving like a blind grandfather.”
I've written up a bit of sicklock, because of course I have to fit all of the Johnlock tropes in here. I've decided to structure the fic month-by-month now that they're moved in with each other. Thank you to those who have left comments.
reasons?”
Mike exclaims, aghast, when John tells him about it.
“Oh, don’t bother with John, he’s terribly dull,” Sherlock says offhandedly. To the man still pointing a gun at him. Casually. Like this happens on the daily. “I suppose you bypassed Mycroft for
“Sherlock, lo—” John catches himself, positively horrified at the term of endearment that almost slipped out. He’s never been much of a term of endearment guy, but in previous relationships the occasional ‘love’ or ‘babe’ was wont to occur, usually when he was trying to reason with someone being unreasonable.
Until the ski lift gets stuck on his way back to a nice dinner with his nice girlfriend.
John blinks, then shakes his head. “No, actually.” It's true that he's been less than keen on work lately, but that's neither here nor there. “Pretty sure you know why I’m... well. You do realize you set my sheets on fire.”
On the way there, he’d grabbed his clothes, though, as well as both their phones, which had been left in the room earlier, just to make sure that he would have enough battery to call Mycroft and get a proper explanation.
Another thought rode along on the current of the first one. Or perhaps it was more of a memory than a thought, one with slipped underneath the first to punch him hard in his gut with the realisation.
It ought to have been enough of a clue that he wanted to be left alone, even if his demeanour and his words before that hadn’t been enough of a two-by-four for the man, especially one as observant as Sherlock.
“…Yes.”
Once upright, John tried to disentangle himself from Sherlock, but the Alpha was quite evidently not in the mood to let John go on his own. Remembering just what had transpired earlier, regardless of the fact that he didn’t know much about it, the Omega couldn’t really blame him.
Thankfully for Sherlock, it seemed that Mycroft was willing to play along with the suggestion he sent, as there were no more interventions or attempts to supersede him as the one to do the actual proposal.
Sherlock had collapsed! What had come between the watch giving and the collapse, he wasn’t fully sure on but it hadn’t been that long after. Which meant that he had…had…
Oh, not when it came to him being a criminal mastermind. Granted, that was something, too, and the sheer
He reached into his suit jacket and pulled out something that looked an awful lot like just a little booklet. Which, technically, it was, but a rather important little booklet.
“Do you think we’re ready?” was finally asked, quietly.
“…Remind me never to get an office job.”
“Bit rich, coming from you, innit?” John said. His eyes ought to have fried the Irishman to a crisp. “And you were quite happy to have me stuck in the harem, if it comes to that.”
At the same time, there was no doubt in his mind that something would happen and soon. The tension in the room had only got worse, strengthened rather than lessened by the ‘cordial pleasantries’ that had been exchanged and though they were at an impasse right now, the stalemate wasn’t going to last.
There. It was done.
Sherlock tried, then, despite what he wanted to do. What he managed to open was his hand. John’s own slipped more firmly into his in the process and, with the slight squeeze his hand got, too, the younger Holmes managed to open his eyes again.
The murmur died quickly after that. As it did, pride swelled in Sherlock on behalf of his friend, whether it was his place to do so or not.
“Get them tomorrow.” No, tomorrow wasn’t good enough. “Bugger that. Let’s get them before we leave. That way, it’s less likely they’ve been altered, and I can read them – “
“You are, John,” Sherlock reiterated, with more confidence and no doubt about the relief this time. He still didn’t look quite put-together and alright, as one might expect from him.
The split-second but rapid and extensive expansion of the pupil didn’t go unnoticed, as he was watching for it.
The smile didn’t disappear at that, though it had every reason to. It did stiffen a little, however.
"Oh, yes. Hi, " John said and there was no way he could cover up how startled he sounded. "Sherlock, these are some of my rugby friends. Bill, Johnson, Mike, this is Sherlock."
Directly across from their living room was a sign that could not be ignored.  Spray painted onto the side of the building opposite, in bright yellow paint.  The symbols were on either side of the words.
“Thank you.”
“Yeah, yeah it is,” and Sherlock had to try so hard not to shiver at John’s soft voice in his ear, “It’s alright.  I’m fine seriously.”  John paused for a second.  “Who knew you were a total softie,” he added, laughing as he untangled himself and playfully pushed at Sherlock’s shoulder.
He had nothing against Swedish furniture.
The writing had gone.
The bad news was that his crush was getting increasingly worse and his self-control was not as good as he thought.  After learning Sherlock could possibly be in the very same building as him, he spent most of his lectures trying
“On the way to the scene.  If you’re coming that is?” Sherlock hurriedly added.  John liked options.  Had to remember to keep asking.
“As I assured you earlier I am fine.  Are you okay?”  Sherlock pretended to be deeply engrossed in Form 23XJ937Y.  There was a slight worry that if he made eye contact, those ocean eyes would make him start apologising and grovelling on the floor and he was desperately trying to claw back some of his aloof persona.
“It’s going to be a pain to get that off. We might need a new one,” she sighed.  He was not conscious of moving but the next moment he was aware of arms wrapped around him, a hand patting him on the back.  He squeezed lightly once, then stepped back, and looked away as she laughed at him.  “Yes, yes, I’m fine,” she said fondly.
“I can help with that,” he offered.
“A small advantage of warfare is you become accustomed to sleeping when you can rather than when’s comfortable,” Sherlock said softly, looking at what he could of John’s dozing face.
“All that trouble John, really?  Also, if they’d switched the plates, how do you explain this, which you clearly think is mine?”  Sherlock shook the feather disdainfully, as if his wings would ever disobey him by moulting like a common Labrador.  He placed it into a clear plastic bag which had been produced from the never-ending pockets.
to think about Sherlock being in the next room over and failing desperately.  It was also exhausting attempting to keep his crush from the man in question.  If his rugby mates, who had the collective awareness of a root vegetable, could tell he had already fallen for this guy, there was no way Sherlock couldn't be aware.  Could there?  Either way Sherlock had not abandoned him yet and John was taking what he could get.
John was essentially an innocent bystander in all this.  And now they were in John’s personal hellscape that was IKEA.
John nodded.
, which you would think would be a big clue as to this person’s mystery identity.
“What I did?”
“Mallory, while loyal to Lestrade to a fault,

Lestrade was still confused.  “What are you talking about?”
After what felt like hours he was on their corridor.  There was Sherlock’s door.  He kept on telling himself that everything was under control.  He could do this.
he?  Don’t think about it!  He had
“Yeah, you know him?” Lestrade asked, mildly surprised.
“It better be.”  May have had more weight if he wasn’t panting.
“Unfortunately.  You going to spend the rest of the day there?” he said enviously.
“Sherlock,” she said, obvious fondness in her voice, and to John’s surprise Sherlock submitted to a hug and a kiss on the cheek.  In their brief meetings previously, Sherlock didn’t strike him as the hugging type.
“Hey,” Victor said, walking up to him but his face dropped into a worried look.  “You okay?”
“It’s nothing,” Sherlock said hurriedly, body suddenly tense as he blocked John’s attempts to move him. Sherlock couldn’t bear to see the worry in John’s eyes as fingers rolled over the gnarled path of his back as if he could both assess and heal through touch alone.
That caught John’s full attention.  “Your brother
John nodded, adding "Clean through.  It was already weak in the middle apparently but then this guy wanted to celebrate winning beer pong and whush, straight on the floor."
John laughed, squeezing the arm that was around Sherlock in an adaptation of a hug.  “I’d love to go.  Maybe I’ll get to know your friends a bit better yeah?  See what you get up to on all these night’s out.”  Look, he was being supportive and everything.
John shuffled in his chair, oddly ruffled.  “I just think you haven’t given yourself enough credit.”  There was something about having Sherlock smile at him that made him feel odd.  Happy but odd.  “So you’re going to stop lounging around and get on with something productive.  Set the curtains on fire.  Re-draw your internal map of Thai restaurants in a 100 mile radius.  Learn to paint.”
John laughed softly as Sherlock huffed angrily and twisted a little to see three heads disappear back round the kitchen door.
Sherlock arrived outside the block of flats, his mind still distracted with the events of earlier.  It was clear John was trying to hide his nightmares but why Sherlock didn’t know.  He didn’t understand how he was supposed to help if John didn’t let him in but for now, he would respect John’s wishes to leave him alone.  It hurt slightly but clearly John wouldn’t want to go on the case, especially not just after a stressful night’s sleep.  John hadn’t shown an abundance of enthusiasm about the case anyway.  However he’d be fine by himself.  At least that’s what Sherlock kept on telling himself.
John wondered if Sherlock would ever give him a straight, non-cryptic answer to a question.  It also suggested this would be a problem for Future-John and he’d like to know in advance what it was he would be berated for not noticing.  “Despite the fact that one of the first things you said to me was that I was in danger.”
“Can you promise
“To tell me that you like someone?” John looked confused.  Sherlock raised an eyebrow because seriously, how much more would it take for this boy to work it out?  He was trying his best here.  Sherlock stepped closer, so they were
“I need to speak to John.
“So let me get this straight,” Lestrade turned round as fully as he could to glare at the bashful Fallen.  “You are choosing
The alleyway was already blocked off by an opaque shield charm and was beginning to get crowded with curious people straining to see what the fuss was about.  Sherlock stalked to the front, his wings providing enough reason for people to get out the way and John followed closely.  The Guard on the outskirts, keeping the peace, was someone John recognised.  This was not necessarily helpful.
?” John asked exasperated.  He’d been two footsteps away from Sherlock since they’d found the evidence, only stopping to argue with Lestrade for two seconds.
“I’m 71 dear I’m not
“Ah, it’s no problem.  All you have to do is admit that I’m better at you and then we’re even.”
John smiled.  “Good to know.  I’m sure Molly will have something for you to dismantle.  Also, your hair’s stuck up weird.”
guilty.  I don’t think you did it though.”
“Fine, the old-fashioned route it is.”  Sherlock pretended not to look interested but couldn’t help glance at him out the corner of his eye.  “Can you find the number-plate?”
“Not even in exchange for this?” Sherlock said pouting.  He produced the previously pocketed phone and held it up to the light, like he was evaluating a precious jewel.  Dimitri’s hands jerked up to grab it, only to jolt back to the table.  Sherlock winced sarcastically.
Because he had lived in the Above with John and lived without him.  The biggest puzzle known to the afterlife, tracking several Fallen with hidden identities and no moral compasses, had been presented to him on a silver platter and instead of leaping at the chance, all he wanted to do was leave and find John.
Sherlock repressed a sigh, as he closed his eyes and smiled. It was such a simple thing, a monosyllabic name that was so common it was entrenched with ordinariness. But, oh, it was so much more than that. That one word contained in it the knowledge that he had done it. He had kept them safe.
Light bulb.  “Mallory.”
“Asking for my help.  Are we ill?”
“I don’t either sometimes.  But you’re stuck with me now.”
“We’re all very excited for you.”
“They’d have to be someone notable for us to realise,” John said, shaking his head.
“Always.”
.  As the mystery unravelled itself he was trying to keep pace with Moriarty and try to get John out of the fatal energy buzzing around him, and for that he needed more
“Okay, ask me another one, ask me another.”
After a few minutes, and quite a bit of swearing, there was the sound of clattering and then Sherlock waved his arms in the air, stretching them out after their captivity.  “Got it.  Now for the cuffs on my feet.”  John felt begrudgingly impressed.  Of course even mildly high, Sherlock retained some of his skill.
at Sherlock.
Wait, what if John already had a partner?  Because who in their right mind wouldn’t want to go out with him?  He was gorgeous and lovely and kind and had nice eyes and oh god what had John done to him?
John looked back into his eyes.  He didn’t have chance to think as John yanked him forwards and crushed their lips together.
,” he said as he caught up with Sherlock’s words and a wicked smile, the exact smile Sherlock had imagined on him, lit up his face.
He was startled from his lovely reprieve by Mike nudging him in the ribs.  “You’ve made it here on time, might as well listen,” he whispered, nodding to the front of the room.  So he dragged himself from his
Molly did not listen.  “You should just ask him out.”
Raz nodded.  “Alright, so second, the message thing.  Basically, what I have to say is
John did not find this as amusing as hoped.  “Hey.  You’ve already insulted me once, try to have some tact.”  He tried to keep his tone light but it was a few notes off, falling shy of accusative and landing at simply awkward.
Sherlock frowned slightly.  “Powers?”
John might have heard the barista snort behind him but he was too busy trying not to hyperventilate to really register it.  Then he realised he was just stood at the counter top, clutching a coffee and staring at GCG.  The man in question had narrowed his eyes in response.  If he didn't move now then that would be it.
It was clearly time to find John and fix this.
“Errrr, yeah, we should be alright,” he said, glancing around their desolate surroundings.  They didn’t have coats, didn’t even take them to the club, the evening surprisingly mild.  John was both grateful he wouldn’t have a stroppy Sherlock with a lost Belstaff but worried he would have a freezing Sherlock with pneumonia instead.  He tucked his wings closer round them and guided them to a wall near what once would have been a car park.  Sherlock curled into him and sighed softly.  John allowed himself to rest his head gently on top of Sherlock’s and breathed deeply, exhaustion creeping into his bones.  He fought against his drifting eyelids, keeping half an ear out on the door they had escaped from.
self.
Lestrade shrugged.  “Honestly?  We’re getting nowhere fast on this case and between this and the symbols case I need a win, soon.  Figured your boy might be useful, him being a consultant and all.”
“Alright mother, I’ll try and do better,” John said, rolling his eyes, and grabbing a tray.
He leaned over and closed the gap between them, locking their lips together.  He gave Sherlock a moment to back away and John's heart clenched when Sherlock remained motionless.  He was going to pull back and apologise when a soft pressure pushed back against his lips.  John twisted to face Sherlock properly and brought his hands up to do what he'd been wanting to do all evening (translation: for weeks now) and run his fingers through Sherlock's hair. The hum Sherlock made at the contact sent shivers down his spine.  The kiss was so soft and innocent it barely seemed real.  It was precious and beautiful and everything he had wanted but was too scared to take.
"Sorry it's messy in here," Sherlock explained as he rifled for something.  "We had to shove a lot of stuff in here so there was room."  He gestured to the pile of books that were stacked on the floor and the small table next to it.
Sherlock. No, let me finish," he shook Sherlock's head slightly as he opened his mouth to interrupt. "But I waited. I didn't have to, but I did and at times I wondered why but somewhere, somehow I knew. I knew you’d come home, would come back to me, and now you're here and-" he paused, a look of revelation in his eyes. "And I want you. Right here, right now.  If you’ll let me."
Sherlock sighed and let go.  “No, I’m talking about the symbol,
However, when Sherlock arrived at Lestrade’s office and skimmed the files he could barely contain his sigh of derision.  It had to be obvious even to Lestrade that this case was nothing of the calibre Sherlock expected.
John pulled back and ghosted his question onto Sherlock's lips.  "Do you want to-?"
“Really?” Sherlock asked shyly.
dramatic?  Purple had always been tight but would that be a good thing?  What was the right choice?  There had to be one, he was just missing it, always too slow, always not quite right, always, always, always-
Ah, yes. He glanced down at the skinny jeans and thought of his curls, shorn off at the sides to make him look younger. But he knew that this was not what John was referencing. John was referring to the black and white stripy jumper Sherlock had on, swamping his skinny body so that it hung down to his knees.
John expected Molly to recoil from such a statement.  Instead she looked curious, and here John realised why Sherlock was allowed a run on the labs down here.  She glanced behind her and turned back, leaning in.  “Fine.  Don’t break anything.  Be out by morning.  I’ll bring you tea.”
Now Sherlock in matters of the brain is logic and reason and ultimate truth. When it comes to matters of the heart however, that unravels like pulling a thread on a jumper and quickly his brain is jumping to every conclusion it can get its hands on. This goes some way to explaining what happened next.
“I didn’t
Then-
Too quickly the curtain fell back and Sherlock felt the irrational cold of rejection.  There was no guarantee of how he would be received, whether he would be welcomed or shunned. Even Mycroft’s information had been meagre.
“John, everything you said to my father, only you see that.  Everyone else always focuses on my faults, it’s in their nature too but you, you make me stronger.  Better than that you make me happy.”
Irene tried not to laugh.  “Okay smartarse, quick fire round: When’s his birthday?”
“And you were trying to protect me?  To look after me?”
“I’ll go get that for you Mrs H,” John said, already bolting down the stairs, his coat half on.
It felt like John was avoiding him.
“- They instruct you in what to do and your terrified they’re going to kill you.  Boss seems as good a word as any.”
“Obviously.”
Drink.  Needed.  Now.
“You make it sound like I’m scared,” Sherlock said huffily.
“It was a little muffled but I believe there was something about all dogs being good dogs.”
A straw was pushed against his lips.  He thought for a moment of refusing but the moment a drop of water hit his lips he abandoned his pride and drank.  He did however try to spit out the straw afterwards in protest.  He strongly suspected it was not as hard-hitting as he wanted it to be.
It took him a moment to realise Mrs Hudson had appeared with tea.  She was the one person he didn’t begrudge sitting in John’s chair.  It was, after all, her own chair.
John looked at him for a moment before saying, “Time works slightly differently down here than up there.”  It was not what Sherlock was expecting.
“Indeed.  I guess I’ll have to have a talk with Mrs Hudson to verify your story and to tell her to leave my things alone.
He cautiously walked down the hall, hyper-aware of how loud his footsteps were in the quiet. Once again, the door was already open.
Sherlock sighed and leaned back.  “Fine.  Was worth a shot.  We’ll just get your henchmen to talk instead, they don’t seem that intelligent, should tell us everything that could incriminate you.”
At the noise he flinched and spun round.  He reminded himself that although he was technically keeping a secret, Sherlock was also secretly stalking a vigilante without telling him.  It was a small something but he held onto it for courage.  He was not the only one to be questioned.
His not-housekeeper was stood in front of the chairs with Gladstone sat by her feet.  Both had looks of judgement on their faces.  Traitor.
“Because it’s our
I.”  The worlds tumbled out incomprehensible.  Because he didn’t want to take them back, not really, but if he didn’t something terrible might happen, like John might voluntarily leave and that cannot be allowed to happen, not when he’d just got him back and-
“Meaning they’ll be more tomorrow?” Sherlock said in mock-horror, with a hint of curiosity.  It would make sense that John would be a romantic.
And so, one decision had already been broken.  No big deal.  After all, no one was perfect, and the pair were big enough to admit they were perhaps less perfect than most.  There was one issue however, that surprised both of them.
“Some rules are meant to be broken.  And look how well that turned out with our first rule.”
“No.”
“Look left.  Between those buildings.
“’Strade,” the groggy voice stated.
Sherlock sighed.  Clearly there would be no getting through to her.
Positives: he hadn’t been knocked out again.  And there was tea.
“Lovely to make your acquaintance.  Now what brings you both here?”
Greg spoke quietly.  “You think-”
Oh yeah.  So screwed.
this.
“Really?” Lestrade said as they marched down the pavement.  “So what was I just saying?”
First one out the gate.  He wanted to be happy.  After all, it was statistically possible.  Improbable but he should take a win at this moment in time.  And yet...
“That’s a lot of people of interest,” Molly pointed out, lifting one of the bags to look at the strands of hair within.  “Human?”
John stood silent for a moment, trying to catch Sherlock out in a lie somehow.  Either he was an excellent actor (which John suspected he
He told himself he was still adjusting and processing, even a year later, and with the upheaval of moving
John.  His John.  Just sat in an armchair.  He was holding a cup of tea in one hand, a book in the other, relaxed and whole and decidedly not dead.
Sherlock gripped the back of the office chair.  “But that could take decades...”  The thought was horrific.
“And bringing a Senior Guard would only arouse their suspicion.  It could jeopardise everything.”
“You alright?” John asked as they stepped over the road, where the paint was failing to attract much attention.  The people of London Above were about as jaded as those in the London Below.
Things were decidedly
“I go by Sherlock now Father,” was the reply as he sprawled, “not that you would now,” he muttered under his breath.
Sherlock nodded, distracted for a second before- “One more question.”
kidnapping, to Moriarty, and Sherlock felt his body winding tenser, and tenser, and
.  Lestrade dutifully sipped his coffee and thought nothing at all.
Trying to cut through the crowd was more difficult than it looked.  Clubs, and dance floors in particular, appeared to make people totally unaware of the space around them.  He thought back to yesterday as prime evidence, the person bumping into him completely oblivious to what they’d broken.  Luckily Sherlock was tall enough that he was easy to find but this also meant that John had a perfect view of him disappearing through the door without him, as he was stuck trying to navigate around an awkwardly placed high table.  He followed as quickly as he could, his senses settling themselves on high-alert.
John nodded.  “Yeah.  It’s all good.”
“Hi guys.  Good workout today,” he said, looking at Sherlock.  To everyone else in the room it was clear that he hadn’t really registered that Molly was there at all.  Sherlock, for all his observational ability, was the one person who had not.
There was the obvious.  The leather-bound books, stacked in block colours, with no names on their spines.  No personal effects on the desk.  No sentiment.  He rolled his eyes.
Sherlock laid back down and resumed staring at the ceiling.  His brother.  A group-chat.
“What is this place?” he asked as they took the stairs down to the basement.
But, as the days drew on, mania turned to lethargy.  He couldn’t mark when the tipping point was.  All he knew was that one day he was crackling with energy and the next, it was a trial to even open his eyes.  Hope, stupid illogical hope, had somehow seeped into his bones and now it was crumbling.  Mind Palace John had disappeared.  The F.A. had dimmed.  The signs were pointing towards the devastating.
.  Because, despite the obvious signposts to the contrary, John truly believed Sherlock was genuinely working against the Fallen.  Sherlock wouldn’t betray him like that because…well he wouldn’t.  He could be rude and mean and careless, he’d shown that in his words at the neighbour’s flat, but
"Hey, what the hell man?" John said, shrugging him off as they entered the kitchen.
“Yes, of course I am John,” Sherlock said, waving a hand dismissively.
“And how am I supposed to do that?” John replied, chasing Sherlock’s lips.
“Ha. Ha.  A comedic genius as well as,“
“John, be reasonable.”
“Sherlock!”
“It’s the glow you have to look for,” he said, highly aware of Sherlock looking at him with as close to awe as Sherlock ever looked.  Well, the mixture.  John was sure Sherlock had forgotten he was there.  John stood up and motioned for Sherlock to put his hand over the mixture, to feel the power that was emanating from the solution.  There were other markers and tests you could do to confirm it but this was by far the simplest and effective.
“For an entire week?”
“Let me,” he offered, happy his voice was still even.  It was then John looked up and Sherlock couldn’t help smirk at the appreciative way John scanned his body.
They made their way into the ballroom proper.  A bar ran along the left side, with several people already stationed there, a few large circular tables with lilac decorations, all framing a large dance floor which was practically deserted apart from a few brave (and judging by their dancing, drunk) souls clumped in the middle.  The music was being played by the Quartet who were pushed into a corner, and Sherlock admitted they were alright.  He let the music sway him slightly, imagined joining in a waltz, spinning softly, with John in his arms… in front of everyone.  No.  Because that wasn’t platonic and people would be staring and then John would want to stop dancing.
“I know.”
“This one’s sturdy.”
Well, Molly did.  But at this moment Molly could have turned into a space-travelling giraffe being followed by a Mariachi band and his gaze wouldn’t have wavered from the sight of John pinning Jack to the ground by straddling his back, holding Jack’s arms in what must have been a painful hold.
“Sherlock, to what do I owe the pleasure?”
“What was what?”
“Fine, let’s find John and he can tell me instead.  Rally your big brother, Mycroft isn’t it?  He’ll probably be able to find him no time.”
“You jumped the fence?” John said.  He knew his jaw was hanging open but he couldn’t help it.
“Now you see, to me John, despite your convincing words, your tone of voice still screams jealous and can’t deal with it.  And that’s fine.  Just give this Victor guy a chance.  He is Sherlock’s friend after all and I’m sure that even if he does have a new person to hang out with, Sherlock still loves you just the same.”
“I-” Sherlock started boldly before panicking.  He aimed the rest of his speech at John’s chest.  “I just wanted to spend time with you.”  That was not what he wanted to say.  This was not seducing, this was...vulnerability.  It made him want to wriggle out of John’s arms and run.  He could feel a hand move to cup his face.
conversation.  Their talk had spiralled from dogs to Sherlock's work, to observations about the surrounding population (which made John giggle and oh, he had to hear that sound again), to Sherlock's apparently astonishing lack of popular culture knowledge.  So there was another walk two weeks later.  Then one a week later.  Then it advanced to every week.  Then every few days.  And then Sherlock found himself lying on the sofa only a day after his last walk with John, desperately wishing the day away not, as was usual, for a case but so that he could see John again.
Sherlock pursed his lips and looked like he was about to refuse outright when he caught John’s eye.  Something faltered in his expression, and he sighed, turning towards the glass.
As for their flat, it was no Baker Street and Sherlock was already mentally plotting how to get them onto Baker Street once more, but it was functional and warm and most importantly, had John in it.
“Well,” John said, settling down so there was more pressure on Sherlock’s chest, grounding him.  “I would like to stay here if that’s alright with you?”  Sherlock nodded.  “Good.  Because you are gorgeous,” and here he began punctuating each word with a kiss, “and funny, and brilliant, and clever, and sexy, so fucking sexy.”  This kiss lasted longer, was deeper, John’s tongue taking it’s time exploring his mouth.  When the separated, both their breathing was a little harder.  “And so there’s nowhere I’d rather be more than right here.”  Sherlock didn’t know how to respond, how to articulate the fact he felt the exact same way other than to push up and pull John back towards him, continuing the kiss.
The body under him smelt lovely, musky and like sex.  Sherlock wanted to roll in it, to smell like it always and he was so tired his mind didn’t even bother telling him that could be considered weird.  Instead, it was strangely on board with this idea.  He dragged his eyes open and blinked against the light filtering into his room.  Forgot to shut the curtains.  Silly.  Too exhausted to move.  Do it later.
“You need an alarm.”
“Because you left me no other choice!  All the time, every day, all I hear is about how you and Victor had a wonderful time that day and what great adventures you’re going on tomorrow, and oh look you’ve got another party to go too together and who do you take along to your first ever crime scene?  How can

This was the first time he saw Sherlock Holmes.  He made sure it was not his last.  Obviously he didn’t know he was called Sherlock Holmes at the time.  Most of the time, in his mind, he was simply the Gorgeous Coffee God.  He did not tell anyone this name.  He did not want it going round he was acting like a besotted 14 year old.  But in his head, he was free to think of as many ludicrous names and fantasies as he wanted.  And dream he did.
“It’s fine.”
Neither turned out necessary however as a black taxi rolled down the street, stopped, and there he was.  John never thought he would call anyone getting out of a car ‘graceful’ but that was the only way to describe it.  He then had to tell himself to get a grip as Sherlock was approaching him.
This meant they could move on to stage two.  He retreated to the kitchen and returned with tea.  Eating was the gateway to drinking.  “You can’t stay on the sofa forever,” he said as he handed one mug over.
Sherlock smiled.  “Precisely what we’re going to find out.”
Just as John allowed the thinned magic to slip through his fingers he caught the tail-end of Sherlock’s disbelief.  Outwardly Sherlock merely raised an eyebrow.
He, whoever he was, was a Fallen Angel.
“Sherlock, calm down.  I’ll try and get in touch with him, you should go and look in all the places John’s likely to go.  But first you need to tell me what you did.”
“Well if the mountain won’t come to Mohammed…”  He said it automatically, uncertain of where he had picked up the phrase or why it was important to keep.
At least the dramatic sigh showed he was listening.
“Duty calls,” he said with a nod.
“I forgot about this earlier!  John dropped it off yesterday.  You really should meet him Sherlock, he just dotes on our young man.”  Mrs Hudson always referred to the dog as ‘our young man’ or ‘our sweet boy’.  Sherlock didn't bother correcting her.  In her hands was a wrapped present, complete with a bow on top.  It was clear from the frenzied response from Gladstone that it was a treat of some kind and on a small tag it said ‘To the handsome boy in 221B, From John, the dog walker’.  Sherlock determinedly told himself he was
Surprise!  Okay, so a few things:
Sherlock snorted, jostling his shoulders, causing John to stir slightly.  However, his body had clearly decided it would take what sleep it would get and he sunk back under quickly.  Lestrade noted that Sherlock ran his hand soothingly up and down his arm, stopping just shy of shushing him.
“John,” Sherlock called after him but he didn’t stop.
He tried to concentrate but it was difficult with Molly’s final words ringing in his ears.  “Just ask him out.”  Like it would be that easy.  Just going up and asking John out.  Who did she think she was talking to?  And as if John would even
“Arguing is not casual,” John pointed out.  The others huffed but called a truce in the interests of the case, each promising to have strong words with the other later.  John was intrigued by how Sherlock knew the other Fallen, the question of his residency in the Council limits still a mystery, but this was perhaps not the time to ask.
“Yeah, well, like I said, I’ve been busy.”
“We’re going to see Molly.”
“Don’t worry, I’ll look after him,” another female voice said from behind them and Jasmine ran off to answer the now insistent knocking at the door.
“Just one more time.”
“Yes,” he said, because he
“Evening sunshine,” John said as Sherlock started.
So Sherlock had been trying something new.  Patience.  It was awful but he would do it for John.  Sherlock was also working out that the phrase “Absence only makes the heart grow fonder” was very much A Thing for him.  That too was also hateful but only because he couldn’t seek out the Absence and tell him he’d really like to kiss him senseless.  Victor had also cautioned against using that as his first line.  Jury was still out on whether Sherlock would actually take that advice.
Lestrade looked incredulous.  “Who?  The tagger?  The
“On the smaller sofa.  We would have fit.”
John held the door open for him and as soon as he was through the door a cry went up.
“I’m sorry.”
“Oh here we go,” Molly said, rolling her eyes as John casually wandered over after most people had left with waves and shouts of “thanks”.
“What do you mean you’re moving in with him?” Greg asked suspiciously, leaning back in his office chair as if to look John up and down, figuring out if he had finally gone mad.
“I wonder whether (insert appropriate scandalous information here).”
Okay, this is it.  Epilogue done, fic finished.  I cannot thank you all enough for reading so hopefully this last chapter stands as my thanks.  A word of caution, I haven't really read through the ending properly so please do flag all the grammar and spelling errors that definitely await you and, as ever, I hope you enjoy this :)
“I’ll offer you a deal.  I’ll find out who your mystery backer is and prevent them from attacking you further
“Forgiven?” John said, his lips twitching into a hopeful smile.
“Fuck,” John growled, forehead rest on Sherlock’s chest, before shouting towards the door “Be there in a minute.  Later,” he said, desperately to Sherlock.
“So what are we doing here? Why not start now?”
“Yes.”
He attempted to say “Fuck off Mycroft.”  What actually came out was a “urghhhh” noise.  His throat was clearly now a scratching-post for kittens.
“I’ll hold you to that.”
… John stopped that thought before it really started.
“Tomorrow,” he said, centimeters away from Sherlock’s lips and then disappeared out of the front doors.
?”  His high pitch was not helping.
Fuck him.
“Now, do you have a hairpin?”  Sherlock asked him, over pronouncing his words.  He sounded like a magician asking the audience for assistance.
The ensuing scramble around the desk nearly took out at least two desks and four nearby angels.  Luckily, those surrounding had learnt to move quickly where Mallory was concerned.  Once in the office, Lestrade shut the blinds while Sherlock moved to the other side of the desk, glowering menacingly.  Mallory was undeterred.  He was certainly committed to being keen.
“Yes.”
There was a pause before Sherlock started to giggle, the vibrations running through John's chest.  He started laughing too and soon they were helpless, each setting the other off again.
Lestrade swung back to Sherlock.  “That’s sorted.  What next?”
to John.  There was more than one occasion that Sherlock considered he had been obliterated and was now experiencing a circle of hell.
He could swear Mallory’s neck clicked with the force of his head snapping up.  “Yes sir!”
“Fine!  A little.”
“You could have slept on the sofa.”
"Everything about your bearing says soldier.  The way you lean back into Parade rest without thinking, the tan line up to the shirt sleeve, the cropped hair."  Sherlock said in a rush before clamping his mouth shut.
“And you solve it for them?”
He huffed and mumbled an answer.  “Needaprofessionalopinion.”
Raz, who was dressed in his customary tracksuit, was about to answer before he stopped dead in the doorway.
) and left the kitchen in search of John.  Luckily he didn’t have to go far as John was perched on the sofa, jotting down notes from a scarily large textbook (
“Why was he worried?”
“You need a hand gorgeous?”
“Er, pot kettle my friend.” John gestured to the laptop.
“Suspect he’ll make you pay for it.  He’s made it explicitly clear he doesn’t like people interrupting his plans,” Sherlock looked about to make a snarky reply that he didn’t care what Raz’s boss thought, when Raz continued, “Probs go for your bulldog mate first.”
He could faintly hear Sherlock panting, still chasing his own release and then still and felt his come combine with his own on his stomach and chest.  Sherlock slumped down next to him and they both stayed there, Sherlock curled up round John as they both calmed down.
Sherlock hummed noncommittally.
“Alright, what do you need?” she said, jumping up.
thoughts Sherlock was having) as he was steeling himself for something which would either work spectacularly well or be spectacularly stupid.  He licked his lips (derailing Sherlock even more), took a deep breath, and locked eyes with Sherlock once again.
His eyes felt heavy so he tried to listen instead.  That’s what Sherlock would do.
“Just to be on the safe sense,” John agreed.
John closed his eyes.  “And he didn’t think to mention this to me?” he said quietly.
They turned to look at each other.  "Brilliant," John said softly, smiling.  Sherlock's face lit up at the praise and John was helpless.
“Do you have classes after this?” was not what Sherlock thought he was going to say but there it was.
“I don’t care.  I’m not going.  Now leave.”
“And there’s that morbid sense of humour I know and am slightly scared by.  Now I need to ask you for a favour that’ll employ those great observational skills but will also help me with a little problem I’ve got.”
of all people telling Sherlock how to behave like a real person.
“I’m fairly sure your housemates are spying on us from the kitchen.”
“Fine,” was all he said before chivvying everyone into the car.  Raz, whoever he was, sat squished between John and Sherlock in the back, in case he tried anything, although the cramped conditions made it impossible to move at all without standing on someone’s foot or crushing a wing.  No one spoke.  No one looked at each other directly.  Peripherally, John was keeping an eye on Raz, who was watching Sherlock, who was staring out the window.  Sherlock, who had to be aware of the attention, was ignoring it and, if anything, looked mildly bored.
“Lock,” John said, digging his heels in to grind them to a halt.
Sherlock was about to agree he was being illogical when instead he said, “I never said what I needed this for.”
“Hey, give the guy some space if he wants space.  I’m sure everything’s fine and confronting him over nothing will actually give him something to avoid you for.”
“Regular elephants.”  Sherlock said it as if his thought process should be obvious.  John couldn’t help laughing.
It looked as volatile as it had the last time.  Sherlock felt slightly nauseous looking at it, torn between a feeling on falling and a wild animal desire to run.
to know that.  “You know, like a spy?”
John frowned at the sudden detour in conversation.  “Victor and Sherlock are best friends.  Been practically joined at the hip since they met.”
