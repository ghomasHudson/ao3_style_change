“Siege of Troy, not important” Cas sank gratefully into a chair. “I think I hurt my knee.” he mused flexing it.
“May I be so bold as to ask what the job is?” That nasty wheedling tone again, it set Chris’ teeth on edge.
“Cas, C’mon. I know she was hot, but this is an over reaction” he looked at his brother, “look Sammie thinks I’m right.” Up until that moment Sam had been convinced that Dean was sober, now he realised that the opposite was the case, He took a step forward.
“John don’t”
“I don’t think you really want me so answer that question do you.”
“The guy who punched Will Riker?”
“Dean-”
“Maybe, would it knock him out like this though?”
“Not now Dean”
“Tell me where he is!”
“Yes I have been called that, but you disobeyed me and you dragged others along with you.”
The boys look for chris, who is chilling with her uncle gabe...but things are getting serious. Sam tries to cope with cas and dean's new arrangement.
“You can’t, Chris you are too weak” The words bubbled out of him in a rush, instantly he regretted them. “I didn’t mean-”
On the way home from sioux falls Cas stops in a bar and meets a curiously familiar stranger, someone who will turn his life and his understanding of the world upside down. But Cas loves Dean, Can an angel love two people? must he choose? or will events take the choice from him?
“Right as rain, Sam. I’m just gonna sit here drink my whisky and think about that cute little doctor” Dean wiggled his eyebrows “If you catch my meaning”
“What’s the story here Doctor?” John raised his eyebrows at the readings displayed on the tricorder, “Doctor Crusher this patient is saturated with chronometric particles.”
“yes Doctor?” Geordi asked.
“How very modern of you,” a derisive snort, “What is it you want from me, bitch.”
“No, just me now.”She was still looking out the window, “My Dad died about five years ago, Cancer of all things. After all those years hunting it seemed hardly fair. My little sister and her family are also..”
“When will you be home?”
“God, it’s his fault. All of it.” Cas didn’t know what to say, Chris watched him closely. “I’m going to punish him.”
“Thanks Dean, I was unaware of how much I had messed up, until you used all that sarcasm to point it out.”
“Sammie I don’t need to go to sick bay, I’m fine. I just need a little R&R and I’ll be aces again,” lying again, lying to Sam was different though, his little brother didn’t need to be worrying about him. Sam sipped his drink they watched the stars slip by outside the window.
“I’m fine Geordi”  Lies, he admitted to himself. Geordi tipped his head and looked at him, even now Dean found the visor a little off putting.
“Not long now kiddo, just hang on okay” Gabe gripped her hands and smiled at her.
he wondered in the privacy of his head. The thing on the screen was weird, a small blue, seemingly wooden box.
“Maybe not, Cas you said to pull Chris out of her dream world, you had to use possession right?”
“I tried that as soon as I couldn’t wake her up!”
“No, I did not take advantage of the situation” Cas snapped, something was off though. Castiel was many things and a terrible liar was one of them.
“Well he is. Do you think that woman did something to him? We should have tested her, maybe she is some kind of monster” Dean realised Sam was staring at something behind him.
“Can they hear her Cas?” Dean demanded. Abruptly the noise ceased and Chris crumpled into Cas arms.
“Just hush choirboy.” She kissed him slowly, almost painfully. Fingers sliding through his hair, stroking down his neck and across his shoulders. It was hard to hold back, but she made herself take her time, burn each caress into her memory. Cas pulled her closer, hands gripping her hips tight enough to bruise. He had slowed down too, perhaps sensing this time was different, each kiss a little self contained supernova against her skin. She pushed him away a little and began unbuttoning his shirt, his eyes never left her face. A kiss to the chest for each button she slid from its hole, his skin tasted of salty seas and long ago skies. She could see the shape of his grace now, bent and twisted but still silvery blue moonlight on an ancient ocean. She reached out to touch it with her own coalescing light, gold as the sun when it was first born. Cas lifted her smoothly onto the dressing table, she could feel his heart hammering under the fingers she spread against the smooth muscles of his stomach. His need reached out to her, she kissed him deeply. Throwing her grace against his,  she saw his broken wings one second arched above, the next cradling her in silvery cosmic fire, his eyes were alight with the same radiance. Something woke in her, she pulled him inside. No not even that he was just there, she locked her legs around his waist. The power was there again whispering to her, then a moment like fire. She felt him reach for her, they were one thing for an instant. Her being saw his, and golden light filled their joined perception-Chris closed her new wings over his, tears starting from her eyes. She cradled Cas against her chest, feeling everything all at once. Knowing as well that small secret part of himself he didn’t ever talk about. He said her name softly.
“No Cas,only that he is alive, for the moment”.
“Oh kiddo, when you say ‘with Dean’, you mean they’re banging right.”
“Well that is true” self consciously Dean held out his hand. “Lets go get our girl and hope she doesn’t kill us.” Cas curled his fingers round Dean’s and they walked down to the kitchen together.
“what’s this? Dinner and a show!” Dean was grinning. Cas froze, blood flooding his face, he looked at Chris whose cheeks had gone a bright hot pink.
“Then call her, give her the choice, tell her what Chuck is planning.” Sam and Cas were both staring at him as if he had grown an extra head.
“This is my fault!”
“Yeah but c’mon man, you had just rescued her, she’s hot and grateful and your kind of handsome” Dean leaned forward, he was enjoying this and Cas had that ‘rabbit caught in the headlights’ look about him. “You are seriously telling me that you spent 24 hours together and nothing happened?”
“You can even bring the flyboy”
“Hi,” a deep gravelly voice that made Deans palms suddenly very sweaty.
“No I don’t think so.” John didn’t like the way she was frowning at him.
Cas was lying in bed watching dust dance in the sunlight. Chris was curled up asleep next to him her hand resting on his chest. Occasionally he felt drawn to look at her and when he did a wave of something new overwhelmed him and he had to smile. So was this love then? He’d thought he knew, but this was different from love of god or family or friends. He looked at her again and felt his smile get wider. His phone rang and she stirred opening her eyes.
“Sure, our Mom left some things here, sit down have a coffee. I’ll see what I can find for you in a bit.” Sam poured the coffee like a good little hostess, Dean sneered in his mind. Then checked himself, realising he was acting like a six year old. There was an awkward silence, Dean was unable to stop himself glaring at the interloper. She avoided his gaze by staring into the depths of her coffee cup.
“Speaking of where’s Cas?”
“Deans wrong. I am not going to spend the rest of my life running in the opposite direction when ever I start to feel something for someone and neither should you. Even it doesn’t last-”
The next time she woke up it was even harder to emerge from the darkness, someone was shaking her and calling her name. She opened her eyes to Castiel’s worried face, “You again.” she pushed him away and sat up, trying to still the trembling in her limbs.
“Back to the motel?”
“You better answer that.” Cas sighed and picked up his phone.
“No, it isn’t. I’m sorry I should not have woken you. You had a busy night it was inconsiderate of me.”
“I’m not sure I want to hurt him, i’m not sure I can. Is there any other option” Cas sighed and met her eyes.
“So she is hot,” Cas could imagine the grin he just knew was spreading over Dean’s face right now. ‘Well two can play at that game’.
“Cas, what’s wrong” she sounded upset. He couldn’t bring himself to look at her, not wanting to see  the pain he had caused.
“Chris, please.” An edge of pain in his voice, consternation filling those sea deep eyes. She laid a finger over his lips.
“Dean, get the hell away from my warp engines,” and he went not gracefully and not without tapping the console lightly and whispering “see you later, Baby” to the ship, but still grateful to get out of there. He headed for ten forward in need of a drink, but willing to put up with synthehol for now. The place wasn’t crowded for once, one of the ships bands was playing Beatles music in the corner. He would have preferred Led Zeppelin, at least it wasn’t jazz. He ordered a beer at the bar and let himself start to unwind. He caught himself crooning along to the music “hey Jude, don’t make it bad, take a sad song and make it better”. He was well into his third synth-ale by the time his brother arrived from his shift on the bridge.
Sam took a step forward “Dean?”Dean woke with a start, coughing, Cas gripped his shoulders. “Dean? Are you alright?”
“Of course.” as soon as she was gone Cas pulled his phone from his pocket. ‘She liked the flowers, NOW WHAT DO I DO?’ He texted Sam.
“You were in a bar? What were you doing?” Dean suppressed a surge of irrational annoyance.
“Donna are they still in custody?”
“Castiel, or Cas if you prefer.” his tone was insistent, Dean sneaked a glance at his face, there was something needy buried in those eyes.
“How else was I supposed to get rid of that many angels? I assure you I do not enjoy carving banishing sigils into my own flesh,” Cas glanced over his shoulder, Fiona had gone to bed with a stern admonishment that he too should sleep and yet he couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched.
“What was it then Dean? I know you are overly proud of your masculinity-”
“How dare you say that to me, after everything I’ve done, Everything I have given up for you and Sam. All the times I have helped you. I have never asked you for anything, and now you have the gall to tell me I can’t have this one thing! How much more of me do you want!”
“I told you it won’t work. Can you stitch it?”
“Uh, No” Cas sat Chris up and gently drew back her shirt exposing the wound. The neat line of stitches had held, but the flesh of Chris’ shoulder was blackened and bruised. The bite it self was a wet angry red. “Its just a ghoul bite, I should be able to heal it”
“I told you she’s family, its okay she won’t hurt you”. Chris reassured him.
“What do I do now?” Cold panic invaded Chris’ veins, she stumbled away blindly. Gabriel followed her, she wasn’t expecting him to do that. “Gabe just go okay.”
”She is in Illinois, a place called Blue Mound there’s an old mansion out side of town.” Cas told Sam and Dean.
“I thought he was against that sort of thing”
“I know, I know. Please just stop, for a second,” Feeling doltish, Cas realised this wasn’t anger, this was fear.
“What do you mean?”
“I can understand that.” Cas turned round and surveyed the room again, with it’s happy population of locals, somewhat depleted now as the evening drew on. He looked down at himself clothed as they were, jeans, boots a plaid shirt and a heavy wollen sweater. It made him smile, then in turn he felt guilty. Dean would be so worried.
“You know about that” Cas dropped his gaze, his cheeks hot.
“Stop” his eyes flared gold, wings outlined against the sky for a moment. “That’s enough, look at your skin” Chris pulled her coat sleeves back, her forearms were blistered and red.
“I’ll get Madame’s nappy changed, come back to bed Sherlock” John raised his eyebrows at him, “It’s four in the morning, even you need to sleep.”
“Chris, are you sure?” he stood up and held out his hand, she took it begrudgingly and let him pull her upright.
“What do I get.”
“Just a moment seraph, this is taking a little longer than I thought, Now hush boys” Ariela cradled Chris’ face in her hands and closed her eyes again. The silence stretched on and on,  Ariela’s face wrinkled with effort. Dean shivered, the room was getting colder as if something were sucking the heat out of the air. He could feel Cas quivering with tension under his restraining hand and pulled the angel a little closer, hoping Cas would understand he was trying to reassure him.
“Ariela-”
“That is inappropriate, especially since I am also your therapist.”
Cas was stunned as the memories unwound in his mind. They did nothing to assuage the dread that had taken hold of him when Asasa had revealed her wings. Dean was shaking his shoulder “Cas, buddy what did she do to you?.”
An hour or so later Dean shut his laptop with an angry snap “African dream root won’t work, apparently Jorogumo are immune.” He leaned back in his chair rubbing his eyes. “I could do with a nap, I had weird dreams last night. Could have sworn Cas was there.”
“I’ll check in with you later Cas, Just go and get sleeping beauty settled”
“When, when I was a kid Sammy was a baby.” The memory seemed to distract Dean, he even smiled a little.
“I don’t think it is.” He scrubbed his face.“Dean is right, I’m going to get you killed or worse. Every thing I have ever cared about I have watched die or has become so twisted I can barely recognise it. The worst of it is, a lot of the time I was the one that twisted it.”
Dean found Sam in the kitchen, sat at the table with his laptop. He looked up as his brother walked in. “Jack called, he wants to stay at Jody’s for another week.” Dean nodded and poured himself a coffee and sat opposite his brother. “I think he has a crush on Alex” Sam added with a smile. Dean couldn’t blame the kid, being at home in the bunker was no picnic for any of them right now.
“I don’t know,” Sam sounded really upset, Dean felt a twinge of guilt. How was this going to reflect on his brother? His little brother who he was damn sure would make captain one day.
“Sorry son” he vanished, Gabe struggled in Sam’s long armed embrace.
against his chest, his family, the only thing he knew was right in a world subtly out of kilter.
“Nice to know you stopped for all of twenty four hours” Cas sat down opposite and tried to act casual.
“Of course he wanted her, he has always wanted her.”
“I need to speak to you in person..is that alright” Chris licked her lips her throat was suddenly very dry.
“Are you sure about this Cas?”
“Yes you do” Picard nodded, “But Mr Worf is concerned about your reasons for doing so.”
“Did what hurt?” The Doc looked confused.
“It is, or it was.” he looked round the room in shock, “I don’t understand.”
“Change it to do what?” Gabe was frowning at her, Chris hesitated unsure of his reaction.
“Cas darlin’ this may be the back of beyond, but we no live in the dark ages in Scotland. You are welcome here laddie. Now come on turkey is waiting.”
“I’m not weak Cas. Maybe, I over reacted, please tell me you understand why.”She wasn’t sure what she expected him to say. Cas’ stepped forward, hesitantly he stroked her hair, his hand coming to a tentative stop on her bare shoulder.
Cas grinned “Fyi she is not a fan.”
“Why? And how can you see my wings?”
“Then go on then, won’t be long” She gave him a light push as an encouragement and shut the door behind him. Cas looked down at the small squirming human in his arms and felt the faintest rush of recognition. An echo of an echo, once Jimmy had looked down at an infant Claire just like this. A tiny fist gripped his finger, bringing tears to his eyes. Smiling sadly, he disengaged his trapped finger and laid it on her forehead.
There was a sound that wasn’t a sound, like reality popping and Davy was with them. Standing on the charcoal star, his clothes dripping water, face ravaged by the sea and the creatures that had feasted on him. Fiona made a small sound half sob, half repressed scream.
“Yes”
“Why!” lot of anger in that voice, lot of resentment, John made a note. He still didn’t look up though.
“Why?”
Dean is a trauma ridden veteran of the war with the Borg, Cas is his counselor. Things get weird when an unexpected visitor arrives on the USS Enterprise 1701-D.
“I get that Cas, I really do. But it’s not true.”
“Are you alright?” The concern in his voice made her eyes prickle with tears, ‘what am I doing?’  she asked herself.
“Yes, I like her”
“Yes I know, she is also my aunty, sort of. She’s a very old friend of my family.”Cas stood stock still as Asasa swept him over with a critical gaze.
“Who knows? We don’t know where Gabriel has been all this time, there is a chance that he is an unwilling participant.”Cas exchanged a concerned look with Dean.
“Well I was sorry, she was amazing” Cas pretended not to see the tears rolling down Sam’s face.
“Yes, do you want me to come to you?”
“You should go to the hospital.”
“I find crowds difficult.” He admitted “Why did we have to come here?”
“What the hell”
“So, Tell us about yourself Chris. How did you get into hunting?” Sam asked a shade too brightly.
“Don’t you dare say his name”
“I suppose she might take that course, if she felt there was no hope left.”
“Well he’s up, for a change. See if you can talk some sense into him. God knows he won’t listen to anyone else” Sam hit the button and the doors slid open. “I have a shift on the bridge, see you later”
“Okay good”
“I think it is number one, Mr Winchester open a channel.”
“Time for Chris to die?”
“Shut up Sam” Chris and Dean said simultaneously. Sam decided it was better to look at his boots.
“Beer run, I need a drink.”
“She’s an archangel” Cas hissed.
“I know, but I need the practice. I’ve not really used sign language since the academy.” Sam knew he was babbling, he couldn’t stop, “Not federation standard anyway, I learned Vulcan sedem-ded when my Dad was stationed there and when we were on Bolia-” Eileen laid a finger on his lips.
“Gabe no” Chris tried to look fierce but it was difficult to be mad at Gabe, he just waggled his eyebrows at her.
“He’s from up north, friend of Bobby Singers. I ran into him on a hunt.” Chris explained. Larry narrowed his eyes suspiciously.
“Chris I’m sorry we broke in, but I’ve been calling both of you all day. Tell me you would not have been a little concerned.” Sam looked at Chris, with his best kicked puppy expression.
“Data here, Good evening Mr Holmes.” Data’s voice was as expressionless as ever, however Sherlock still thought he could hear a note of amusement. Yet again he cursed his mother for naming him after some dusty old book.
“Could she do that? I mean she still has wings right?” Dean paused to smile at Cas, His angel smiled back, but it was a sad ghost of a smile. Dean could see the guilt shining in Cas’ eyes. “Perhaps she has just skadadled off to Jupiter or something”
“continued existence. Give me what I want and I won’t deep fry your ass”
“nothing” he lied.
“I’m an archangel, me and my brothers used the big bang as a paddling pool, I will be fine. Now light the candles young padawan.”
“I get it Sam and I appreciate it, reminds me of home.”
“Shut Up, Dean” Sam ordered, holding his right eye.
“Yeah I do,”  he sighed and helped her to her feet, “No offence kiddo, but you are broken.”
“I’m not just going to die Sam, I’m going to burn. I’ll burn for days, I can’t be near any of you when that happens.” Both Dean and Sam looked appalled, Cas stood up and took her by the shoulders.
John muttered in the privacy of his head. “I see you’ve been having panic attacks.”
“Ohh sweet thing I don’t need you just your blood. Child of an archangel, with your blood I can scour the grace from every angel in heaven and earth.”
“My number, call me sometime.” she leaned down and kissed his cheek and turned to leave.
“OL DOOAIN I Ariel PASH”
This Chapter: Cas gets laid- explicitly, (consider yourselves warned) Dean may be a little annoyed by this..
“According to this we don’t, there’s no cure. The victims rescued just wither away and die .”
“House burned down end of story.” Dean slapped the couch.
“With a human!” He jumped off the table anger clouding his features he took two steps forward, Ariela forced herself to meet his eyes, all she wanted to do was cower before the terror inducing waves of power he sent towards her, but she couldn’t let herself give in.
“Okay, but I don’t know how to get him out. Maybe we should give it sometime, he may wake up on his own..perhaps this will work.”
“Hey what you smiling at blue eyes?”
“Look, I don’t get what this thing is with you and Cas and I know things are complicated-” He stopped, feeling torn between his brother and his best friend, “what I mean is, I had this friend and I always hoped we’d be more than that-but she died. I really wish I’d grabbed that opportunity.” Chris squeezed his hand and then pulled him into an unanticipated hug, Sam was starting to see what cas liked about this woman.
“One thousand and twenty five and yes for you.”
“Its not for you to apologise for that Castiel.”
“very good Mr Worf, keep hailing them. Mr Data, put our unexpected guest on the view screen.” The camera angle shifted to show the port nacelle it’s bussard collector glowing faintly red. Sam squinted, there was something small and dark floating near the hull, at a nod from Picard he magnified the image. “mon dieu” Sam heard the Captain whisper under his breath.
“Hey that’s enough you two.” Asasa reappeared and handed Cas a piece of paper. She looked at them sadly. “I can’t say I’m happy about this. You look after her Castiel, she is all I have.”
“What are you doing in my bedroom? And where the hell have you been!” he demanded realising he was awake.
“I am capable of going to a liquor store on my own.”
“ I will have you know, I have faced three princes of hell.”
“Nice to meet you Sam” The Doctor turned to Picard, “I think I need to have a look at your crew manifest Jean Luc.”
“Guys we should head back home, go through the lore again. If Chris isn’t going to co-operate we need a better way to subdue her. Because these clearly don’t work” Sam held up the snapped through angel cuffs.
“I don’t sleep, you could have let me drive” Cas pointed out testily as he helped Chris out of the car. Dean eyed her worriedly, she had slept the whole drive back, head pillowed on Cas’ lap and now she didn’t seem entirely awake.
“I told you, I’m different,” she walked up to him smiling, “Thank you blue eyes, now get” she shoved him away, a psychic push that landed him back into his own body with a bump.
“Cas that’s angel radio!” Sam darted forward and dropped down, cradling Chris’ face between his hands. “Chris, its Sam. I need you to come away from that right now.” she didn’t even flinch, her gaze remained fixed on some point far above the ceiling.
“Well two or three things can happen, either the universes energy signatures cancel each other out and all life just sinks back into nothing” Now the Doctor was staring right at Sam.
“All in good time, after we get this bairn back to her mother.”
“Alright then, Oh and Jean-luc?”
“Um, she tried, but the damage is extensive all she could do was patch you up.” He wanted to hold her, but something in her manner told him that wasn’t what she wanted right now. Silence lay heavily between them as she considered his words.
“Why?”
“Everything hurts” Chris murmured, abruptly she was a dead weight in his arms, he tightened his grip holding her upright. “Cas, I can’t think straight.”
“I didn’t-” he gasped as she applied more pressure.
“What do you want to do Cas?” Sam asked gently.
“We get him out I suppose, though how..”Dean sighed “And when we get him back we take his feathered ass to a shrink!”
“I suppose so”
“It’s okay, Sam. He won’t hurt me.” She lingered a second after Sam went, fingers tapping at the table thoughtfully.
Dean looked at the still form of the hunter, with grudging respect, “She took out two ghouls on her own?”
“Woah” Sam muttered and shook his head. Cas looked at his friends.
“Just as well,” Asasa sniffed, “I’ve never liked killing angels.”
“It only takes one mistake and somebody winds up dead, she was lucky Cas was there.”
“Wow, that’s kind of cool. isn’t it Dean?” Dean glowered at Sam, behind them Cas was happily chopping vegetables.
“Like what?”
“You really feel better?”Chris looked anxious. Cas didn’t answer her, he just pulled her close and brought his mouth down on hers.
“We didn’t want to take any chances, Chris you were screaming out on angel radio.” he exchanged glances with Cas’. “Tell you what, Sammy and Jack here will take you upstairs get you comfortable. You should eat and me and Cas will clear up down here. That sound okay to you?”
“Look Cas I’d be the same if it was someone I cared about in there. Just try and keep it together” Sam said, giving his brother a slightly disapproving look, which Dean ignored.
“Cool your jets Castiel, I may not seem like much, but I am a lot older and tougher than I look.”
“Ariela, enough.” he pushed the blade down, and touched her face. “I am sorry kiddo.” He hugged her, she received it stiffly, unbelieving.  “I’m sorry, I mean it. I just wanted to know your reasoning, I was an idiot back then.” his words broke her heart and she embraced him back laying her head on his shoulder.
“I’m sorry, I was just asking.” He still hadn’t put the picture down, Chris crossed the room and snatched it from his fingers, placing it very gently on the shelf, Sam watched his brother with mounting anger. “and who are these cheeky imps” Dean asked picking up another gilt edged frame. Chris took that from him as well, her face unreadable.
“What’s this?”
“You two have been grocery shopping, while I’ve been sat here thinking god knows what had happened to you, you two have been playing HOUSE?!”
“Are you alright?”
“What do you want?” Cas snarled.
“Well we both want the same thing, don’t we?.” Her eyes flicked towards the other end of the room. Dean bit his lip and said nothing, Chris took the final plate from him and dried it. “I’m going to lose him, I can feel it. The only question is how.” Dean really saw her then, perhaps the way Cas saw her. A glass with a crack in it, and he did not want to be the one to break her. He took a breath.
“Call me Thor”
“I can send her faraway, a different world, she’ll never be able to come back.”
On the way home from sioux falls Cas stops in a bar and meets a curiously familiar stranger, someone who will turn his life and his understanding of the world upside down. But Cas loves Dean, Can an angel love two people? must he choose? or will events take the choice from him?
Fiona’s cottage was still dark when Cas pulled the land rover up outside. “looks like the power is still out.” Fiona, didn’t answer she just clutched the bag of candles the land lord of the pub had given her and stared round eyed at the black windows. Cas gave her an encouraging smile, “Come on.”
“Look Cas when I hook up with a girl in a bar, its not because I want to marry her. Its because we both want to have a good time.”
“Sam turn it off.” Sam fumbled the phone.”
“He was killed on an away mission.”
“Oh God Cas. Does anything I say make it into that thick head of yours?”
Pounding pain in her temple roused Chris from one profound darkness to another lesser one. For a while she lay still and rode the waves of sickness that washed over her. Concussion, she decided, she sat up slowly cataloguing her body’s hurts. Her throat hurt, the skin on her knees and palms were on fire, her fingers found a gritty crust of dried blood on her forehead-that would be the cause of the concussion then and she was bone numbingly, blood chillingly cold. When the next spasm of nausea passed she staggered upright and felt her way round the walls of her prison. A small space, stone built her questing fingers told her, with a metal door at one end and a wooden bench attached to one wall. The bench contained a rough blanket and nothing else. It smelled strongly of things she did not want to think about, but she wrapped herself in it anyway and sat on the bench tucking her feet under her and wrapping her arms round her legs. Eventually the blood returned to her hands and feet in a painful tingling rush, she allowed herself let out a single sob “Cas”. She wondered if he were dead, her memories were ribbons. She remembered his voice shouting in fear, then blackness and another memory surfaced. She had woken up before this in another place surrounded by demons, she had flown at them, they hadn’t expected that. She had been trying to make them kill her-clearly she had failed. Tears threatened she blinked them away, no she would get out of here and if Cas was dead, well she would make every last one of them burn!
“Smooth Cas, real smooth.” Dean shook his head and sat back down swinging his booted feet up on the table.
“Really?”Chris smiled “That’s adorable.”
“Well maybe I am” Dean wriggled a bit getting comfy. “So what are they going to do with me Sam?”

“I’ll see you later then.”
“So you like her”
“Now tell me something Castiel where is my niece? And why have you brought the Winchester boys to my home?”
“don’t joke Cas”
“Will you get rid of it?”
“And her’s, Cas I knew you were a lot of things, but I never had you down as selfish.”That stung, Cas flushed with rage.
“Yeah right, so you and he” Gabriel grinned and bobbed his head “have been getting nasty, you know, playing hide the zucchini-”
“Cas I’m alright” Chris told him and pushed his hand down.
“So you caught a ghost? I’m impressed” even though the line was crackling Cas could tell, Dean was not happy, he sounded annoyed.
“Castiel.”
“Yes I am” Dean said as he appeared behind his brother. “What’s going on fellas.”
“I don’t know if I remember everything, it took a while to come back. But I know you blue eyes, better than I know my closest kin” She stroked his cheek, he half smiled at that. She hugged him fiercely while he wept into her hair, her own tears trickling on to his skin. “I’m so sorry you had to do those things, I’m so sorry. It’s ok now.” After a while Cas pulled away, though he kept his hands firmly on her hips.
“I don’t know what to say to make things right.”
“Okay Sammy, I’ll go talk to Cas.”
“No Cas, they need to know,” he heard the sharp breath she took to calm herself and reached up covering her fingers with his own.
Cas did as he was told laying a double thickness of warm wool on the cold wood. After a moments thought and a nudge from one of Jimmy’s old memories adding a towel on top of that; that earned him a pleased smile from Fiona. He stood close by as the baby was unwrapped from it’s snug nest. She was so tiny Cas couldn’t help staring.
“The last one?, How many were there?”
“yeah I have a few like that.”she raised her hand to the barkeeper “two bourbons, please.”
“about what?”
“How did that happen?”
“So Anthony, why have you decided to come to therapy today?” he had put his sunglasses back on and was looking at her with his mouth open. “You are not my first demon.”
*note this is not a reader insert.
“What do you mean?”
“In here” Cas whispered and ducked in to the darkness. Dean and Sam switched on their flash lights and followed. A lot of bodies here, these were blackened and twisted as if they had been close to the centre of an explosion. A soft sob attracted Deans attention, he pointed his flash light in the direction from which it seemed to come. There was a large throne-like chair in the centre of the room huddled on it was a pale figure.
“Control is very important to you isn’t it?”  That did it, Dean scrambled back a couple of steps, putting the couch between him and the Doc. Cas just shook his head and let out a short laugh. “sit down Dean, I’m not going to eat you, for a start you are not my type. I said sit.” He pointed to the couch. Dean did as he was told. He sat, head down and hands clasped together and looking everywhere except at the Doctor. Cas had returned to his own seat seemingly un-fazed by what had transpired, he was totally relaxed legs stretched out in front of him and the PADD danglingly from his fingers. “So you lost some friends at wolf 359?”
“Oh you know this and that.” The demon’s smugness was really starting to annoy her. Chris grasped Gabriel’s arm. He tried to scream, but all that came out was a guttural moan, Chris held him firm as he thrashed and drew him into the light. His mouth was sewn shut, needle marks and half healed injuries dotted his arms. Shocked Chris let go and he scuttled into the furthest corner of the cell.
“No.”
“That was Lucifer.”
“As you said, I’m your oldest friend. You can’t fool me.” John folded his arms, “I’m waiting.”
“Did I do something wrong?” He sounded hurt.
“I need to see an old friend, it won’t take long.” She touched his face and he kissed her. The beautiful mundanity of it struck him, this was normal life.
“Thank-you, Dean” Cas rubbed his forehead and his gaze seemed to turn inward, then his eyes flicked back to Dean ,“I know where she is”
“I got hurt, when I was up north. I nearly died.”
“Won’t work, doesn’t work on me.” She ignored the confused frown wrinkling his face, there would be time for explanations later. “just get me back to my motel, its the six on main.”
“Thank you, but some things they don’t heal, they just fester.”Cas was surprised by the vehemence of his own tone. Chris squeezed his hand briefly.
“Did you really kill three princes of hell? Because I’ve been in your head choirboy and that is not the way I recall it.”
“How did you know-”
“Anthony J. Crowley at your service.” He swept off his sunglasses, revealing lizard like yellow eyes. Linda wondered if he was trying to shock her. She sat down and picked up yet another new notebook. She wrote his name on the cover and then on the first page, ‘Anthony has an exhibitionist streak and a deeply performative nature’.
“Oh come on Sam, lets see would Cas go off and do something stupid without consulting us first? I think we both know the answer to that one.”
“it wasn’t your fault choir boy, not all of it.”
“It was that mortal loving pustule, Castiel wasn’t it. Is that broken winged freak in love with you?” Chris didn’t answer. “he is isn’t he!” Asmodeus laughed to himself. “Ah no matter, he will go down like the rest.”
“That’s not good enough” he growled and reached across, grabbing Gabe by his shirt front and hauling him out. The table tipped over, drinks going everywhere, their companions took off like scared rabbits. Chris stood up.
Sam had to agree with that, he sat on the other side of the bed took the girls free wrist and checked her pulse again. “What now?”
“That was pretty damn good.” Dean wiped the last of the sauce off his plate with a crust of bread and chewed it slowly. Cas looked down at his own plate, a half embarrassed, half proud smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. Dean dropped his gaze as a familiar feeling washed over him. It was followed by a spike of intense anger when Chris, collecting the plates paused behind Cas and kissed him on the top of his head. She slid her fingers into his shirt for a moment, caressing Cas’ collar bone. She happened to look at Dean, he saw her skin pale, her expression briefly contorted with a spasm of something akin to pain. In response Dean felt his face flush and he forced himself to smile. Chris smiled back and carried the dishes away, but her movements were stiff and the dishes banged loudly against the kitchen counter as she put them down. Dean joined her by the sink as Sam asked Cas about some arcane piece of lore he was reading about on his tablet.
“I love you, never doubt it.” he told her earnestly, not expecting a reply.
“Well I damn well hope they stay there.” Asasa paced the floor angrily. “Christine you are my only kin in this world, please give him up. Angel and a human that’s a story as never ends well and of all the host of heaven you choose Castiel. Death follows him around like a shadow.”
“I got to tell you brother, she smells so good”
“I assure you I am real.” He reached out and unclenched her hand wrapping her fingers around his. She looked him in the eye then.
“Well I have had my fill of people ‘protecting’ me . I have to go Cas is here.”
She saw his intent the second before his dangling foot connected with the giants crotch “Gabe don’t!” Too late, he went down like a tree, howling and clutching his privates. Her uncle landed on his feet and together they surveyed the crowd of bouncers advancing on them. Gabe was laughing, his face a mask of malicious glee.
“Jack, what the hell are you doing here? I told you to stay at Jody’s!
“Extract her grace, it’s our only hope of saving her”
“Sherlock what the hell-” he took a few steps forward, Sherlock thrashed about eyes wild.
“Sure, I’ll go tell Dean” Sam shrugged at Cas almost smiling at his confusion.
“I get that Cas, I really do, but you are acting weird. You just saved your friends life shouldn’t you at least be happy about it.” Cas made to push past Sam, who for his part blocked the way by simply spreading his arms across the corridor. “No Cas, you are going to talk to me. Dean is pretty pissed with you for risking yourself like that.”
“Sure thing.”
“They have already started the spell, we can’t wait. I’ll go ahead, follow me when the spells working”
“Then I will be going, thank you aunty.”
“How do you know that?”
“I was just trying to find out” Sam folded his arms and stared at Cas, Cas shook his head.
“Chris, I love you please stop this” Cas held out his hand, she looked at him for a long moment then snapped her fingers. She reappeared in front of him and reached for his out stretched hand.
“One thousand and twenty-five, I will be there by tonight.” He repeated.
“Do you want me to stay?” Sam was still hovering anxiously.
“It’s going to be okay, I’ll talk to Deanna, he is still seeing her?”
“It was me, I happened Sammie” She said unbelievingly. Cas touched her forehead.
Cas kissed her back hard on the lips, he stopped.
“Good I can only handle one moody feathered person at a time.”
“I’m not tired, what about you Cas? Do you want this?” She let go of his tie and slipped her hands under his shirt. Her fingers wandered down his spine, spreading fiery shivers down wards making him thirst for more. “Cas?” he wanted her badly, yet he held back. Confusion tangled his thoughts, he had wanted Dean this badly and that had not turned out well, what if this went wrong?, what if he lost her as well? He pulled himself away and sat on the edge of the bed breathing hard, as panic took hold of him, all these years and he still didn’t really have a grip on human emotion.
“He doesn’t just think it Aunty” Chris growled.
“Cas, why?”
“About Chris, Right now I don’t know what I am supposed to say to her, should I tell her?.”
Silence reigned in the bunker broken only by a click as Dean put Cas’ phone down on the table. “Cas, I don’t mean to sound disrespectful, but I think it’s fair to say Chris has gone off the reservation.” Dean felt bad saying it, but what the hell was he supposed to say?
“She protected my Dad from the BMOL, helped us hide.”
“Hi Doc” Dean tried to straighten up, uncomfortably aware of the tears on his cheeks and the whisky bottle dangling from his fingers. He attempted to concentrate on the blurry figure in front of him, but his heart was still trying to burst out of his chest.
“Cas, it’s going to hurt her, it may even still kill her. I won’t ask you to do that to someone you care about.” For a moment, Cas looked like he was going to argue, then to Dean’s discomfort gratitude shone in the angels eyes.
“I am, forget it long day.” Linda stood up and rounded her desk, holding out her hand. Her visitor bowed deeply and kissed her knuckles, his skin was hot almost feverish.
“Dean, she is dying, I’m going to lose her.”
“I know but I was thinking, maybe it just needed more power?”
“Denver, I have emailed you the mugshots.”
“Dean, she- Asmodeus is after her, he wants her for some nefarious purpose” Cas watched as Dean absorbed that information, his friend paused mid-sip and slowly put his glass down. When he finally turned to look at Cas his expression was furious.
“I’m watching him too”
“Hiya Sammy” Dean snagged the sheet and pulled it over them both. Sam was now steadfastly looking at the floor. “this is exactly what it looks like.”
“We summon him and you talk to him.”
“You’re a clever boy Sam, I like you. But you’re wrong” She laughed, a beautiful sound. “Ah my little brothers, endlessly arguing, fighting and messing up. Only one I had any time for was Gabriel, he was a sweet boy. He liked you Castiel, took you under his wing as it were.”Cas was silent, he remembered a long ago beach, waves lapping his brother pointing out an ugly snub-nosed fish as it pulled itself on to the gritty sand. Asasa smiled “I was there that morning, Castiel.”
“good times!” he shouted and threw a punch at the nearest black suit. Chris let out a sigh and clenched her fists, it was going to be a long night.
“No you do, its just you do things differently, understand.”
“But sir-” Sam interrupted, Picard waved him into silence.
“Please don’t go.”
“One condition?”
“Wait.”He looked down at Chris, stroked her cheek. Her eyes opened slowly “Are you alright?” he asked her.
“What were they to you Dean?”
“It’s Castiel”
“Oh I see and do you like it.” Cas felt his cheeks grow hot, Chris didn’t seem to notice. She turned her attention back to the sink, picking up the bouquet of jasmine and snipping the ends of the stems efficiently.
“I don’t own a shotgun.”He sounded confused,  Chris laughed, then realised he was serious.
“you may find you are wrong about that” She had been telling the power to wait, to build now she smiled at Asmodeus. “you may want to get out of the way” He frowned at her puzzled, then alarmed as she unclenched her fist and a light began to glow hot and golden, kill them all she told it savagely. It built until she was blinded, she heard the demons behind her scream and then let it go.
“I may be able to do something for the pain and I can see they are hurting you.” Cas looked round the crampt shop dubiously.
“what do you think I was doing? I was having a beer, Dean” Cas snapped.
“No you’re not buddy, we will find a way to fix this’” Dean sounded certain, Cas doubted his sincerity.
“My panties are just fine, Sam!” Not his best comeback, both brothers gaped at him. Dean was trying not to laugh, that hurt.
“Then let me help you, please” their eyes locked, her eyes glistened with tears, Cas felt her fingers wander along his jaw.
“What happened to you Castiel?” he didn’t answer her and started to get up, angrily dashing the tears from his face. Chris grabbed the lapel of his trenchcoat and pulled him back down. “It’s okay” he looked at her again, “you’re okay” she reached out and brushed an errant tear from his cheek, then slipped her arms around him. There was a moments resistance and then he slumped against her, face buried in her good shoulder. Chris stroked his hair lightly and tried to untangle the mess of feelings in her head. What is going on here? What the hell is this? she couldn’t find an answer and when he pulled away and mumbled an apology she kissed him very gently on the fore head.
“That was Sam, come on”
“No I’ll come to you, can you text me the address.”
“You have no idea” Cas told him with a wink and tossed a load of mushrooms into the pan. Dean made a sound half way between a groan and a laugh.
“Eww you are right. Go run, but take a couple of hours off tomorrow. Doctors orders.”
“Because I remember, just like I remember being filled with leviathan.”
“Go with Sam, I won’t be long.”
“If you kicked the men of letters asses, I’m grateful. But I did nothing to the choir boy, Why would I? He saved my life.”
“What is the difference” Cas was confused.
“The wrongness” Dean’s expression pleaded with him to agree. Cas took a deep breath, he was appalled he had never got a diagnosis this wrong before. He wondered if John knew the extent of their patient’s psychosis.
“Okay and what else did he teach you-” Cas cut her off with a kiss, he  gripped her buttocks and lifted her up. Chris wrapped her legs round his waist and danced her tongue over his neck. He carried her to the table and sat her on the edge. She pushed the leather jacket from his shoulders and tugged the t-shirt over his head.
“Yes”
“It’s fine Castiel, I have to pay a visit to the lass and her bairn in the village anyway,”She squeezed his shoulder and smiled up at him. Castiel had to admit she was quite pretty in a small elfin way, his brow furrowed as he considered how this petite person had managed to hoist him from the road so competently. “I see you have been nosing about the place,” she nodded at the picture he was still holding.
“Hold him, it works quickly.” John watched Sherlock lapse into unconsciousness.
“But I am hot” He smiled, pleased at his joke.
Cas made another pot of coffee while he waited for Fiona to come downstairs, senses alert for any change in the atmosphere. A quick inventory of the kitchen cupboards furnished him with a packet of salt and he had retrieved an iron poker from where it had fallen under the unlit Christmas tree. Basics for ghost fighting, he leaned the poker up against the fireplace within easy reach should he need it. As he straightened up a photograph on the mantel caught his eye. Fiona looking somewhat younger in a white wedding dress and standing next to her, smiling broadly the man he had seen upstairs. He picked up the picture carefully, tipping it towards the light so he could confirm what his eyes were seeing.
“My names Sara” the girl pouted.
“I remember a fish,” she was crying, she pressed her forehead to his, fingers gripping his shoulders tight. “and I remember Dean, I’m so sorry Cas.”
“You killed my children, your grand children. You, sir are a monster, you kill your own kin.” Anger and remembered grief consumed Ariela, she let it speak.
“The warding is the same.” Cas held up a hand, briefly occult characters glowed on the wall, then faded. “Its distorted, like its been blown apart.”
“Look I’m sorry I just need you to listen, just for a minute, please” Dean seemed to collapse in on himself, Cas saw tears in his eyes. “I promise. Just one minute then you can walk out of here and I’ll leave you alone.”
“Dean! She was injured” Cas frowned at him, disapprovingly. Dean grinned even wider, he missed teasing Cas.
“John Watson, Doctor Watson”
“Small but perfect” Fiona pulled her stethoscope from her pocket checked her over briskly, “Everything seems fine.” She pulled the blanket back round the child and to Cas’ surprise handed her to him. “Do me a favour Cas, take the bairn out in the hall while I examine Mairi here.”
“yes”
“and now I know we are related” Gabe grinned and planted a sloppy kiss on his blonde. Chris turned back to Sara, the girl had a pretty heart shaped face and big grey eyes.
“Hey Cas it’s Dean I want to apologise-”
“No, I don’t make a habit of hanging out with angels.”
“Dean help me choose some tunes?” Chris called to him.
“Shh Sam, what happened?” Dean let his head thump back down.
“This is it?” Dean asked Looking with disgust at the tacky shop front. Cas ignored him and pushed the door open.
“I like to have him close, besides he ain’t going anywhere.”
“Dean, my girlfriend remember?” Dean let her go and grinned at Cas.
“She went home Cas, Sam drove her back to her car a few hours ago.”
“Hush now, show me your wings lover boy”
This Chapter: Cas has to face a grim truth, Ariela tries to help. Talk of death and dying.
“Yes.” Cas looked away, embarrassed.
“So kill me or lock me away like you did Lucifer, because if you take my child from me again I will stick my blade in my own heart and go into the empty like my little brothers.” with a flick of her wrist she pulled her sword from her sleeve and placed the point over her heart.
“Grown bairns already you must have got married young.”
“Well you fell in love with him” Cas laughed and sat back in his chair, John grinned at him.
“Why are you sorry? you didn’t give the orders. You didn’t drag the entire crew after just one man!” Dean stopped short, he noticed the wet warmth on his cheeks and scrubbed the offending tears away. He wanted to stop, but the words were poring out of him in a seething stinking mess, “They were right next to me, I should have saved them.” Silence suffocating everything, Dean could hear the Doctor breathing, but he wasn’t paying attention to Cas now. Instead he prodded his pain like a sore tooth feeling its sting in new ways and remembering everything. Laughing with Charlie about  his ex-boyfriend, back when they had served on the Lexington and Kevin, Sam’s room-mate at the academy too young really for active duty, but so damn smart the powers that be had made an exception. He was so lost in his memories, he didn’t notice Cas stand up and stretch.
John decided.“So your Mother died when you were a child, Yes?”
“you ready for this?” Dean asked softly, Cas shook his head and zipped up the bag quickly.
“Sorry” he gulped the water down, hoping it would relieve the dryness of his throat-it didn’t help much.
“I’m sorry Dean, but we have to talk about this. You need to move past-”
“Well thanks little brother.”
“I can’t, I’m sorry”
The Doctor was not entirely sure where she was, one minute she had been taking the newly updated TARDIS for a test run around the sun and back. The next thing the old girl had started shaking and bucking like a wild horse. A shower of sparks had arched over her head before some kind of feedback had knocked to her onto the deck. She woke up with a cut on her chin and a head full of blinding light. She pulled herself upright and planted herself in front of the console screen, muttering darkly to the Tardis,“I’m gonna be late for tea at Graham’s”. The Doctor stared at the screen in confusion, the stars were in the wrong place. “Well that’s just brilliant”, she studied the star charts for a minute before a fuzzy memory poked her or rather flicked it’s ridiculous fringe and straightened it’s bow-tie at her.
“how do you feel right now.”
“It’s nothing, really.”
Asasa shook her head at the disappearing angel and pulled her niece into a hug detaining her. “I love you child and yes I think he does love you, but he is not for you.”
“It’s okay, you’re alright I have you”
“Father?” He appeared in front of her, head tilted on one side eyes giving her the same disappointed look he had bestowed on her all those millennia ago. She took a step back expecting him to blast her on the spot, more worryingly she could no longer feel Chris.
“Understood” She let herself sink back to the deck and back braced against the console base, closed her eyes. There was a barely perceptible lurch as the Enterprises tractor beam snagged the Tardis and guided it into her shuttle bay,
Back in the bunker all Dean heard was a thump as Cas dropped the phone, “Cas!” Dean shouted. Sam stood opposite him he looked at his brother with a frown.
“Something tells me that was not a sincere response.” Cas’ eyes narrowed and he ran his tongue over his lips. The innocent gesture made Dean even more uncomfortable, he wriggled in his seat and hoped the blood rushing to his face was not noticeable, though he was more worried about the blood currently rushing somewhere else. He made a grab for the carafe of water on the coffee table and poured himself a glass, in his haste he spilt half of it on the gleaming wood.
“What!”Sam was looking at him in disbelief.
“Asmodeus” Chris said softly.
“Maybe, I just don’t get why he took her, if he has a grudge why not just kill her?” Dean looked at Cas sympathetically, “I’m sorry man.”
“But what about Dean?”
“NO!” Chris screamed and headbutted him, he let go the impact knocking him backwards. Chris ripped the needle from her neck, blood spread unheeded in its wake. She snapped the angel cuffs from her wrist, turned and grabbed Dean and threw him over the bar. Only Sam was left standing, he was backing away from Chris, an angel blade held in front of him. Cas stood up and lurched in front of Sam.
“How do you know?”
“Now why would I do that, when I came here to fetch her?” Chris went suddenly limp and the demon tossed her over his shoulder. Cas howled with rage and rushed forwards, only to find himself held fast. Asmodeus winked “I have to thank you boys, I’ve been looking for this child a very long time, thank you so much for your assistance.” Then he was gone, and so was Chris, nothing remained but the lingering scent of sulphur. What ever spell was restraining them vanished and Cas stumbled forward.
“Well thank you very much counsellor Troi-Why don’t you-.” Chris cut the call off then and looked at Cas. He was hunched up hands covering his face, a naked shivering ball of pain. Her heart dropped, tears started from her eyes.
Chris seized his chin and tried to make him look at her. He pushed at her, his whole body twisting in desperation to escape. Chris sensed the moment when he opened his wings, but she was ready-that was, after all how they had ended up here in the first place. She lashed out with her grace and held Gabriel still, wings pinioned like a dead butterfly.  He made a noise, half way between and sob and a scream. “Gabriel, why did you bring us to Norway!” Chris turned his face towards her and saw hell reflected in his eyes.
“It’s an archangels sword, my brothers they needed to be kept in line. So Daddy gave me that”
“The truth obviously, Cas” Dean snapped, pulling his phone out of his pocket and walking away. Sam had been hanging back watching the argument, his forehead creased with concern, “Cas are you alright, I’m sorry this happened.”
“I beg your pardon! I have been nothing but a good wife to you, Since the day we were wed!” Fiona jabbed an accusing finger at the ghost. The ghost actually leaned backwards as if her finger were made of iron.
"You know you and Cas that’s technically-you know."
“No the bunker, it’ll be safer.”
“Guys, there’s something you need to know” Chris’ voice was flat, all her earlier humour gone.
“Well its making me feel like I need a cold shower.”Sam laughed.
Dean has trouble dealing with confinement.
“We were just trying to protect you Jack, you understand that right” Sam held his hands out in apology. Jack nodded and took a couple of steps towards Chris, Cas found himself suddenly worried about how Ariela would react and stood right behind his son, ready to defend him if necessary.
“I think she is alright Fiona, such a good girl. She barely made a cry all night.”
“So what do we do?”
Cas was still cold despite the fire that crackled and spat in the grate less than a foot away. Fiona had stripped his soaked clothes from him, bundled him into a oversized t-shirt and pyjama trousers and installed him in an upright armchair. Her eyes had widened when she saw his slashed chest, “something made a bit of a mess of you there, laddie. No matter once you are warm, I’ll take care of it,” he had opened his mouth to thank her, she had laid a finger over his lips “Hush now, I’ll make you a hot drink and then we will talk.” with that she had tucked a heavy blanket round his unprotesting form and disappeared into another room. He tried to stretch his still cold feet closer to the fireplace and was as surprised as hell when they were gently kicked back, he looked up frowning. Fiona was back, she too was frowning. “No you don’t laddie, we warm your core first, unless you want to go into shock?” something in her eyes made Cas draw his feet back.
“I get that, but I’m here to help. Good things do happen, whether you believe that or not and sometimes whether you deserve them or not.” Cas was standing too close, Dean froze. His blood was thundering in his ears, right now he wanted nothing more than to land a kiss on those soft lips, rip off that uniform and – what the hell is wrong with me!
“You okay Winchester”. Dean turned round,
“My god, Castiel! what are you angel of the bloody obvious!” Chris was feeling sick, must be the blood loss, she told herself.
“That sometimes you need to stop scratching before you make things bleed? well sometimes you need to cauterise that wound before it gets infected.”
“Must have been hard, you and your brother were quite young at the time.”
“You were human?” Chris wasn’t entirely sure she had heard that right.
“So that’s why you rescued me?” Gabe sounded hurt, disappointed even. Chris shook her head.
“I don’t know” he took a step forward, “I need your help, she has been taken”.
“Well not here, he hates strip clubs, but this town definitely.”
“Look Cas, go and say you are sorry.”
“You’re right and she will never forgive me, but she will be alive.” Dean looked sceptical, Cas paused for a second before adding. “There is no other way, the last time this happened the nephilim was the child of an ordinary angel, Chris is the daughter of an archangel. There may be no safe distance.”
“Cas hang on” Dean reached out to stop him.
“Deal”
“So do we think he is helping her? Cause an archangel is not something we have planned for.”
“Cas?”hearing his voice sent a jolt through her.
“Dean, I think you need to sleep.” he edged round the table and firmly took Deans arm and guided him towards his bedroom. He went meekly enough, climbed into bed and let Cas pull the covers over him.
“Winchester you are in serious trouble, I suggest you think about what you are doing.”
“Yes, you have.” Deadpan, but a hint of a smile was hovering around Cas’ lips.
“Don’t” she snapped in a warning tone. “Just go home.”
“We can’t let you do that.” Dean dragging himself over the bar and pointing a gun at Chris, “Angel killing bullets, won’t kill you, but will slow you down.” Chris shook her head sadly, she glanced at Cas.
“I did not lose him” the dark haired one snorted miming quotation marks in the air. “Odin went to Norway because he wanted to.”
“What about Dean?”
As her phone started ringing again, Chris resisted the urge to throw the damned thing against the wall. ‘You need to hear his voice’ some traitorous part of her muttered and she gave in. “Hello, Cas”
“I said get her out of here before I snap her neck.” he couldn’t remember the last time he had felt rage like this, Chris was just standing there, un-intimidated and un-fazed. Worse still he was sure it was pity he could see in her eyes.
He came back to himself slowly, Chris was curled tightly against his chest his name escaped her lips it sounded like a half sob. He stroked her hair.
“OL DOOAIN I Ariel PASH” She shouted.
“Sorry Sammie”
“Cas, it’s a thousand miles”
“I saw your wings.” She muttered and stared into her glass. “Just for an instant, when you healed the bairn.”
“No, I’m sorry. Chris this path you are on, if you keep your power it only ends one way. I won’t lose another child to the dark side”
Cas could smell the sea, that sharp iodine smell. He blinked his eyes and looked down at his bare feet, toes sinking into black sand. A small wave broke sending foam racing towards his naked skin, the first touch of the ice cold water sent him hopping gracelessly backwards. Some one chuckled, Cas spun round searching for the source of the sound, there was nothing. Just the black beach and the empty horizon of the shining sea. No other sound, not even a gull, just the rush of the waves against the sand. He made himself take a breath and examine where he was, beach, sea and mountains behind him. It all felt real and yet it seemed wrong, like the nightmares he had suffered when he was human. He scooped a hand full of wet sand and let the gritty stuff dribble between his fingers. This time it was a sigh that echoed on the wind, Cas rubbed his hand clean on his trench-the confusion was giving way to anger. “I know you are there” he noticed then, the sun was moving too swiftly. It had been daylight when he arrived, now the sun was dipping towards the horizon. Even as he watched, it set in a sea of fire while behind him night engulfed the mountains. “Why did you bring me here!” shouting, feeling impotent he strode up and down the beach.
“Chris, that’s not true”
“ I know everything about her, I think” He found himself smiling as he said it.
“Can you see my wings”
“I don’t know what you are talking about”
“Dean, we are safe. You heard what she said, Chris is going after Chuck.”
“Well, there’s you and me, and then there’s you and Chris, but what if it was just you, me and Chris.” Dean must have sensed Cas’ confusion, “What I mean is, she’s hot, I like her, I think she likes me, we both uh, love you. You see what I am getting at”
“Oh Castiel, one final word” Ariela called over her shoulder as she made her way behind the counter. “If you fail to bring my baby girl home safe and sound, I will rip those broken wings from your shoulders and gut you myself and your boy toy.”
“How did this happened Cas? Because Asmodeus didn’t do much to me, he wanted me alive.” She finally faced him, her golden glowing gaze pinned him in place and he knew she sensed his guilt. There was no way to soften the blow, he would have to tell her the truth.
“I told you ,I don’t know!”Ariela was pleading with her, Chris could see the desperation in her eyes.
“just hang on a second.” Dean rubbed his face tiredly, “You want to do what?”
“Of course I’m here, child” A very old woman appeared from a shadowy doorway by the counter. She wore a bright orange and white head-cloth and matching dress, her dark skin was deeply lined. Her bright eyes scrutinised Chris for a moment and flicked over Castiel, she grunted. “What has happened to you child and why have you brought a fly boy into my home?.” Her voice was smooth and heavy with a southern accent.
Chris was angrier than she had ever been, Asasa began to walk away from her. Chris strode across the room and grabbed her mom’s arm, “Tell me how to find him!” She let her eyes blaze and her wings appear. Asasa snarled at her, her eyes lit with fire, wings materialising above her head. She moved like a snake and threw Chris to the floor, pinning her like a falcon does it’s prey.
“Cas” Dean standing in the shadows, arms crossed defensively. “Buddy are you sure about this?”
“Not long”
“Don’t!” He snatched the weapon from Deans grasp and dropped it.
“What do you mean” Chris asked softly.
“Yeah I’m fine, I’m sorry I didn’t say good bye. Dean-”
“You already tried to heal her?” Sam cut in before the conversation turned into another fight. Dean resisted the urge to make a snarky remark and collapsed in to a chair. Sam’s constant peace making was starting to get irritating.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea.” Cas told him softly, even though the idea of climbing into bed with a warm body after so long sleeping alone had it’s attractions, even if that body was a mildly psychotic, if gorgeous ex-patient.
“Chris-”
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to intrude,” he handed the picture to her, avoiding her too bright eyes and trying to hide the ashamed blush that threatened to crawl over his cheeks.
“Sarcasm Sammy? Really?” Dean grinned at his brother, he was starting to feel nicely fuzzy, “So what’s shaking upstairs, anything interesting”
“I’m sure we could” Chris found herself grinning, a laugh bubbled up from somewhere.
“That’s messed up.”
“Nevertheless, it is the reason. Your expectations don’t come into it. I am your Doctor.” John looked at Dean finally. He was hunched up, hands clasped together in front of him, whole being vibrating with suppressed rage.
“Of course I can. That’s not the right question though.” The yogurt was all gone, disappointed Chuck scraped at the bottom of the tub ineffectively for a moment then snapped his fingers, refilling it. He flashed Cas a grin, “mmm raspberry this time”.
“Yes,” Castiel interjected “But it wasn’t his fault he burnt off his soul killing the Arch-angel Michael and-”
“You see? How can you possibly see? It’s hardly a common problem is it? Bet people walk in your office everyday saying; ‘Doctor help me, I’m in love with the Angel who helped me stop the apocalypse!’.”
“Oh course, I’m-”
“That’s not what I meant”
“I thought you were the Doctor?”genuine puzzlement.
“Cas wait, you idiot!”Dean called to no avail.
“You’re not a betazoid by any chance?” Dean still couldn’t look at him.
“You know this is making me uncomfortable.” Cas said in a slightly hurt tone of voice.
"I'm not judging.” laughing, he held up his hands. Chris glared at him, “Okay I am totally judging you.” He patted her on the shoulder and wandered away to the cliff edge.“So where is lover boy now?”
“Oh good, I guess.” ‘Shut up Sam you clumsy oaf’ he told himself sternly, he hoped Eileen wasn’t offended. She took a step back and tilted her head looking at him critically.
“I don’t recognise her species?”
“There may not be anything you can do. You all heard what Ariela said only God can fix me and I don’t think Grand-daddy is all that interested.”
“You really don’t know me, do you little brother?” She sighed and flicked her fingers releasing them from restraint. Dean immediately rushed towards her drawing an angel blade, Cas grabbed him.
“Chris please, give up your grace.” Gabe said softly once their laughter had died down, “If dad hasn’t fixed you, he won’t. He’s not known for his leniency.”
“Is this hell?”she asked, Cas looked round the bright room in confusion.
“I don’t know, Sam. I hope not”
“She died,”Not strictly a lie, but not the truth either. Fiona was quiet for a moment, she shifted the land rover into a lower gear.
“Doctor, I still don’t quite understand what it is you are saying to me”  Sam heard Commander La Forge say, he sounded frustrated.
Dean sighed “Did you just fall down the stairs?” Cas narrowed his eyes.
“Just as well, I’m not doing this sober angel.”
“Me too Cas, me to”
“Cas I’m sorry I’m just scared, I am so scared.” she grabbed the front of his shirt, twisting her fingers in the material and surprising him by planting her lips firmly on his. Her mouth was hot and wet. She tasted sweet, how do you always taste so good? The thought was fleeting, lost as her tongue curled round his. Cas pulled her into his lap, he could feel her urgency now. Her hands glided down his back and he tightened his grip.
Inside the pub a fire burned merrily in the stone fireplace, Fiona’s entrance caused a small wave of happy greetings. Three musicians, a fiddler, a man with a guitar and a girl with a penny whistle sat in a corner and played a merry tune. Cas stopped to listen to them, unable to suppress the smile that the happy melody brought to his face. Fiona pulled on his sleeve and dragged him away laughing. “come along man, we need to see the baby first.”
“Hang on, your son was Gilgamesh, the Gilgamesh? And he was a nephilim?”
“So have I,” Castiel sighed, “Did the ones you killed deserve it?”
“No you’re not, not really. I can’t understand any of this. You spend what a day? with this girl, and suddenly you want her to play Leia to your Solo? Its totalled messed up.”
“and yourself. You hurt yourself for me.” she pulled herself away a fraction ,“You do that too much, Cas”, Cas could feel her hand shaking as she caressed his jaw. He stared at her, unsure of how to react.
On the way home from sioux falls Cas stops in a bar and meets a curiously familiar stranger, someone who will turn his life and his understanding of the world upside down. But Cas loves Dean, Can an angel love two people? must he choose? or will events take the choice from him?
“You are not my doctor,” Dean jabbed a finger at him, John raised an eyebrow. Clearly Dean was not happy.
“Maybe we don’t all deserve it”
“Cas have you seen Dean? Oh god!” Sam staring at them, mouth opening and shutting like a stunned goldfish.
“Who are you texting?”
“You have changed.” Ariela let go and took a step away.
“At the moment.”She was looking out the window, “I have a house there, it belonged to my parents.” Sam heard sadness in her voice.
“You don’t believe there is one”
“What if it doesn’t work?”
“Go to sleep Cas, Beregida” she whispered kissing his forehead softly, he went lax in her arms. With newly discovered strength she laid him in the bed, pulling the covers round gently. “I have to go. I love you blue eyes” She picked up his trench coat and slipped it on. “But I think I am going to have to save myself, I need to go home.” Home, she thought and closed her eyes.
“Cas slow down, what’s going on with you?” .
“Yes I know” Cas was hunched on his chair not looking at eithier of them.
“What the hell is this!”
BI!Dean, Bi!Cas, Done!Sam, main character OC (not a reader insert) Various other OC’s
“Yes” he admitted, dropping into a chair dejectedly.
“Yes” he admitted.
“he told you what?” Dean was staring at him in alarm.
“What?” Dean demanded.
“She is gone, she left. But its okay, I know how we can save her”
“Sam Winchester,”
“Because I was in her head Sam and she told me. I had to use possession to wake her up.” Sam looked appalled at that, Cas remembered Sam had been possessed by Gadreel without his permission. “She called to me Sam, she asked me for help. I didn’t know what else to do.” Cas let out a bitter laugh “and now I can’t stop thinking about her.” Sam sighed.
“So the tracking spell was a bust?” Dean rubbed his hands over his face tiredly and tried to keep the frustration out of his voice.
“Then we have to find her, now.” Cas jumped out of bed.
“Who might you be child?” Quick as a snake she stood up and crossed the floor. Cas resisted the urge to drag Jack away from her. She was looking Jack up and down, a strange smile curving her lips. “Are you Luci’s boy”
John groaned internally
“When the angels fell, all those screams. My brothers and sisters dying and nothing I could do except listen. What would you have had me do flyboy?” Her voice was like a razor, Cas turned away, but not before Dean saw how deeply her words cut him.
“Do you know what we talked about, when I drove her back to her car?” Sam asked changing the sub ject.
“Damn straight Cas, not happening” Dean nodded, Chris bowed her head.
“But him” Davy gestured at Cas angrily.
“She is safe for the moment, the boys have found her. Whether she stays safe, depends on you.” Ariela drew a cautious breath.
“Chris please-”
“Cas, Buddy are you sure about this?” he asked as gently as he could, folding his arms against the tightness in his chest.
“You’re a long way from home” Cas said after a moment, mostly to cover the awkwardness he felt sitting next to someone and not speaking.
“Unless it’s not a ghoul bite”
“Okay” she breathed and leaned forward, a heavy hand on her shoulder interrupted the intended kiss. Chris looked up and up, a giant in a monkey suit was glaring down at her. “Problem?”
“yep, mugshots. She was arrested with little fella for starting a fight in a strip club.” Sam flipped open his laptop and pulled up the email, sure enough there Chris was and Gabriel too.
“Only when it suits him” Gabriel’s eyes turned inward for a second, Chris squeezed her uncles shoulder.
“Cas no!” Dean called after him, but he was already running.
“You’re not alone any-more, I’m here and Dean will come round.”
He woke up sometime later in sick bay. He tried to get up only to find someone had strapped him down. Well that’s a good sign, he managed to raise his head and realised he was in one of the private rooms off the main sickbay, Sam was leaning his lanky frame against the wall arms folded staring at his brother with a mixture of anger and concern.
“You’re cute when you blush.” Dean raised an eyebrow, “You know, if you wanted” Dean paused “Maybe we could, uh, sort something out.”
“Slut” Davy repeated sullenly, his glazed eyes stared at her with malevolence.
“yes, what are you doing here.” she pushed herself to her feet, aware that she was shaking. She had never seen an angel actually smite someone before, the rogue ones she had killed had never had the chance. That was the problem though, Chris was suddenly remembering just how many angels she had dispatched. She took a half step away and her knee gave way, she hit the floor hard and her breath hissed between her teeth in a silent scream. He was beside her in an instant.
This Chapter: Cas meets the family, Chris makes a discovery-quite fluffy
“Obviously.”
“I beg your pardon lieutenant!” Slowly Dean turned round. Riker was furious, his face red under that ridiculous beard. Dean grinned to himself, he approached the seething first officer until they were nose to nose, out of the corner of his eye he could see Sam getting out of his seat.
“I was just saying-”
“Gabriel, of course I’m not sure. Just do it alright!” The power was already whispering that this was a bad idea, Chris shoved it’s suggestions to one side and glared at her uncle.
“This is not a good idea.” Even so she pulled the cork and took a swig, it burned her throat and made her splutter.
“You canna stay here any longer Davy lad, you have to go. For both our sakes”
“Sorry Sammie just trying to lighten the moment.”
“Instead of someone I liked, instead of the first girl that our best friend fell in love with.”
“Oh I don’t think so missy” As her fingers closed on the gun, the ghoul grabbed her wrist and snapped it. Chris let out a low scream through gritted teeth and tried to head butt him. “oh the things I’m gonna do to you” his tongue flicked his lips.“I bet, you are going to taste sweet and cause you killed my brothers, We will have a little extra fun before I tear out that pretty little heart of yours hmmm?” He sunk his teeth into her shoulder. Chris struggled and managed to jam her knee into the ghouls crotch, she saw his eyes widen then he was wrenched away from her.
“That was weird”
“Just get Sam, meet me in the war room”
“Have you never heard of personal space?” it came out as a growl, instead of backing off the Doctor leaned forward until he was practically nose to nose with Dean.
“I love you too, Cas” Her fingers curled round his, he gripped her hand tightly and pulled her against him.
“Well I knew chocolate wouldn’t cut it.”she saw his shy smile reflected in the mirror as he dropped another touch of his lips to her shoulder. The jolt was electric, she leaned back wanting him to press his lips there longer. He obliged “I love you, never doubt it, I won’t let you die” She turned in his arms.
“Yes Sam, I am drinking. I have nothing better to do, I’m stuck in these four walls, until they decide what to do with me.” he finished the glass, putting it down on the table with a clunk. “I am at the mercy of others” He spread his hands wide, bowed to Sam then sat back down heavily. He thought about pouring another drink, but decided to cut out the middleman and instead, swigged straight from the bottle. “tell your pal Sanchez to hurry up next time, I had to wait an age for him to walk me home.”
“You know Giles, the librarian? From Buffy the vampire slayer”
“You want to think about that for a moment Cherie?” she tapped the staff on the ground again and looked at him. “So flyboy, where is my baby girl?” the eyes she turned on him were flinty. Cas swallowed in trepidation.
“You don’t have intercourse?” Cas frowned, sometimes he thought Dean considered him a little slow. Well, two can play at that game, Cas thought to himself.
“Where is Asmodeus?” Dean wondered aloud.
“I told you to call me Aunty Asasa flyboy.” She was there in front of them, eyes narrowed and face flushed with anger. Cas noticed that this time she carried a staff, the opa iku, ancestor stick. He took a respectful step back and motioned at Sam and Dean to do the same. “And I may be old, but I am still your elder in every way.” There was a short silence.
“Cas! It wasn’t that! For fuck sake!” Dean rubbed his face, why had his throat chosen this moment to dry up? He licked his lips and made himself look Cas in the eye, he had to put this right, he needed to find the right words, ‘I can’t mess this up’“I fell to bits when you died, you have no idea. I missed you so much, Cas” Dean crushed the sob trying to crawl up his throat. “I couldn’t go through that again, everybody I love gets hurt.”
“No, don’t do this”
“When I first realised he was still around, it was wonderful. My Davy same as ever. But then-”
“You didn’t say anything to Mairi”
“Why are you lying to me?”
They found Cas standing next to one of the peeling wooden columns four dead demons strewn in front of him.”I take it that wasn’t you” Sam said, leaning down to examine the corpse’s empty burned eye sockets.
“Dean, I don’t know what to do.” Cas admitted, he looked away embarrassed.
“Hello I’m Doctor Watson, I’m your therapist.” John smiled brightly at Dean and received a furious glare in return.
“Chris you don’t understand, there is nowhere you can go” Chris could hear the panic underlying his words now.
“No I just cut your connection for a moment, we need to talk Ariela.” The small ginger haired man hitched himself up on a table, he picked up one of the quartz crystals scattered artfully across the table-top and held it up to the light.
“My name is Castiel and I am definitely not a choir boy.” he growled annoyed.
“No it is, I can feel you Cas” She stroked his jaw with trembling fingers. “I’m not ready to die, I won’t.” She pushed him away and angrily pulled on a pair of Jack’s jeans. She stared at him a moment, looking somehow smaller in his son’s baggy clothes. “I won’t die Cas”
“uhh guys” Sam stood by the kitchen doorway red faced,  Dean was leaning against a wall beer in hand, grinning he raised it in mock salute.
“Yes it will hurt me, but I will not lose you.” not like I have already lost Dean, the thought froze him to the core.
“Ah bless your heart, I just gave his memory a poke” she shoved Cas with her foot. “Get up child, you ain’t hurt.” She glanced at Sam, “Sammie help your brother get this fool on his feet.”The boys lifted him, but it was Dean who held his shaking shocked form upright. “Don’t you two look sweet, so do you know me now brother?”
“Who’s ‘he’” Cas interrupted, he reached out and snagged Chris’ hand.
“So you keep him planet side, not very smart” Chris asked Asmodeus, as she followed him along the winding corridor.
“Take the rest of the day off, maybe go to sick bay.”
“What do I do?”
“Alright then”.
”Yes I am awake and yes I am fine.”
“And you say I’m a nerd,” laughing, Sam shook his head and turned his attention to the book. “hmm, this looks promising,” Sam leafed carefully through the brittle pages, “I think this is a spell for binding and powering down an angel.”
“The demon who did it, yeah. The thing who sent him, no.” She took a deep breath “can we talk about something else Sam?”
“Did you do something to me Aunty?”
“We don’t have time and neither does Chris.”
“You are a total jerk, you know that.”
“From Cas’ exploding girlfriend!” Dean snapped, he stood up and stretched. “Cas has a plan, he wants to force Chris to give up her grace.”
“I will try and be fast, but this will hurt”
“I get that Cas, what’s your point?”
“I’ll see you downstairs.” Cas told him.
“You said she wouldn’t hurt me.”
“Yes, just be careful and text me your address,” Dean hesitated for a second before adding “I love you, merry Christmas dumbass.”
“No, I’m definitely not hurt Cas.” She cradled his cheek and kissed him.
“Guys stop it, that’s enough” Cas shrugged out of Sam’s grip and barrelled towards Dean, who floored him with a round house kick. “Guys this is absurd, your fighting over a girl and one of you doesn’t even like her!” Cas was up again, Dean caught him on the forehead before Sam stepped in between them and caught the full force of Cas’ return punch. He fell to his knees both his brother and his friend looked at him in consternation.
“Where are you going?”panic in her voice, Cas didn’t blame her it felt like the house was watching them, goosebumps prickled the back of his neck.
“Yes”
The burgers were finished long before Cas’ reached the end of his story . He sat cross legged on the floor as he spoke and he didn’t look at her at all until he had told it all. Now those blue eyes were pleading with her for something. A little awkwardly because of her bad knee she slipped off the bed on to the floor.
“Three she killed the first two before I got there. I was too late to stop her being bitten.”Cas laid the hunter back down carefully, he shrugged off his trench coat and folded it under her head.
“Yes, I think so” Cas clasped his hands together in his lap.
“But you hook up with girls all the time.”
“I’m your doctor, Castiel.”

Chris shifted to the end of the bed letting her legs dangle off the end, as she considered the question. What do you want? She asked him silently, honesty something whispered to her. She moistened her lips, “I’ve killed a lot of angels Castiel.” he took a couple of steps forward and sat down beside her.
“what’s that?”
On the way home from sioux falls Cas stops in a bar and meets a curiously familiar stranger, someone who will turn his life and his understanding of the world upside down. But Cas loves Dean, Can an angel love two people? must he choose? or will events take the choice from him?
“I don’t remember much.”
“I expressly forbid it.”
“It’s a bit late for that Cas.”
“Well, when ever you two have an emotional problem, you get drunk and it helps you solve it.”
“I got you these, Sam said I should give you roses, but I know these are your favourite.” he watched her anxiously as she breathed in the fragrance, “Like um, the ones in your mothers garden, they got a little crushed, sorry.”
This Chapter: Implied sexual threat, implied torture, Chris finds out who she is.
Chris pushed Asasa away and walked out without a word, she grabbed Cas’ hand and pulled him after her.
“Are you just trying to make me feel better” Cas asked, Dean pursed his lips.
“Really?”
“Yes, I feel dizzy is all”
“What did you call me Davy Mcleod!” Fiona’s hands had balled into fists and she took a step towards the circle, Cas blinked in surprise.
“I think Mairi said they were going to call her Amelia, after her grandmother.”
“I’m going to help you, but you have to move or you will die,” she lifted his arm over her slight shoulders and firmly gripped him round the waist. It took a couple of tries but Cas managed to drag himself to his feet the woman was surprisingly strong taking most of his weight, she muttered encouraging words to him as he put one frozen foot in front of the other. It was only a few feet to the car, an old style land rover, to Cas it seemed like an eternity. The woman strapped him in the front seat grabbing a blanket out of the back she swaddled him tightly like a burrito. “That will do until we get home, try not to die”
It was dark in the Cathedral at this time of night, only the candles on the altar wavered in the slight breeze as Gabriel swung the door open. “Nice place, Dad always did have the best architects.” he wandered down the immense nave, it’s forest of white columns veiled in shadow. Chris followed more slowly, every part of her body was now screaming at her. She stumbled and grabbed a pew for support, the wood burned beneath her fingers. Gabe jogged back down the nave and helped her up. “Ups a daisy” He helped her to her feet and half carried half dragged her down to the altar.
“What did you say your name was son.”
“Dean-”
“I’m fine, I can barely feel it. Thank you Asasa.”
“Yes Cas, I know! But could you and my brother please put on some pants first!”
“It’s real, nowhere near earth, but real. You aren’t really here of course, you are asleep in the bunker” Chuck paused and wiggled his eyebrows suggestively, “Where your girlfriend left you”
“I’m not sure ‘adorable’ is a term I’d use to describe Dean. It was our Dad’s car, keeps him close you know” Sam started the engine.
Characters mentioned/present: lost track, most of them probably.
“Not you flyboy, stay there and don’t touch anything.”
“No, sometimes I don’t want to remember. I’m not that Castiel anymore, I’m not that soldier. The things I did back then-” He stopped, Chris’ arms round his shoulders her cheek pressed against his.
“Cas what the hell!”

“No just the Doctor and you are” she smiled at him.
“I’m sorry sir I don’t know” John apologised. “Sherlock calm down, look at me.” he tried to distract his husband as out of the corner of his eye he saw Beverly palm a hypospray. Sherlock twisted and somehow escaped his captors grip, he ran forwards but stopped in front of the Doctor.
“I kissed her,”Cas admitted, Dean fought hard to keep his expression neutral as his heart sank, but Cas wasn’t looking at him; he was looking at her, his fingers resting lightly against her cheek.
“Doesn’t matter, she has been through hell the last few days and you are treating her like a kid. It’s going to take more than chocolate and flowers.”
“Not all of it.”
“We have to be quick now, make a circle of salt.” to Fiona’s credit she did as she was told, sprinkling a large ring of salt around them and retreating back to the centre with commendable quickness. Cas finished the design he had been drawing with a burnt branch on the floor, a pentagram in a circle. He lit a candle at each corner anchoring each firmly with wax and then glanced up at Fiona, who was scanning the shadows of the room anxiously. “Its time” he held out his hand. Fiona nodded and placed her hand in his palm up, she shuddered as Cas drew the blade across her palm. The blood dripped onto the charcoal star, the candles wavered as the room grew suddenly colder. “Amate spiritus obscure, te quaerimus, te oramus, nobiscum colloquere, aput nos circita,"Cas felt resistance as he chanted the spell, he repeated it louder and heard Fiona repeat it after him.
A reassuringly soft thud announced that she was safely onboard. She stood up, smoothed her coat down and stomped down the ramp, flinging the doors open with a grin.“Beverly! Jean-Luc! It is brilliant to see you again” she lurched forward and hugged Doctor Crusher and a very surprised Picard, “I know the last time you saw me I was a brunette and had a posh accent, but I’m blonde and a bit northern now” her legs were threatening to give way she spun round to hide it “I was an angry Scotsman for a while too-” her head betrayed her, the lights became blinding and she sagged to her knees, “I think maybe I am a little poorly”
“Are you drinking, Dean haven’t you learned your lesson? You may be facing a court-martial” Sam tried, unsuccessfully to snatch the glass out of Dean’s hand. Dean stood up with a groan and faced his brother.
“He has a name, Castiel and he is an angel so you’d best be mending your manners Davy.” The spirit opened and shut it’s mouth a few times, “Plus he’s gay” Fiona folded her arms and glared at her dead husband, Cas stifled a laugh, he had never seen a ghost look mortified before.
“Ok, maybe he did.” Dean pretended to calm down, then shoved past his brother and grabbed Sam’s Cellphone from his bedside table. “Lets have a little look here shall we.”
“My Dad was never good at taking orders, he upset some very powerful people. I think you can guess who, since we are sat in one of their bunkers.” She stared defiantly at the brothers, “so are you going to kill me ? I imagine there is still a very good price on my head.” She jumped when Dean let out a laugh, Sam was smiling at her as well.
“Well what can I say, he has a punchable face,” Dean’s legs were cramping again, he resisted the urge to get up and pace.
“How was she dangerous?”
“You killed her!” it was nearly a scream, Cas felt Dean grab him holding him still.
“That Dad hates strip clubs. Well actually it’s a funny -”
“Because it was wicked?” Sam shrugged.
“That’s right flyboy. After Michael killed my boys, when I realised what our Daddy was up to I took my grand-babies and I hid them, I kept them safe from the flood watched over them and their children and so on down all the long years. Once I had a tribe of kin, now I only have Christine, my last baby girl.”
“Yes, this is my true form, you should not be able to see it”
“yes you are sweetheart, though it seems considerably less powerful than is usual.”
“Yes Ariela, burned an image of this place into my mind.”
“I’m so sorry, if there had been another way-”
“She made a mistake Dean, she told me.”
“Sorry no time, we have things to talk about.” She slid off the biobed and looked at John quizzically. “I’m sorry have we met? You look familiar.”
“you don’t even know me, not really.” Chris let go of his hand and instead ran her fingers around the stubbly line of his jaw, there was that sensation again, recognition.
“I don’t know where that is”
“Cas we got you back, we got me back, hell we got Sam back. This time will be no different.” Cas forbore to comment, thinking of all the times they had failed, he wondered if Dean really believed his own words.
“No you may not. Now where is he?”
He paused next to the guest rooms. Sam was curled on his side cuddled into his blanket, pillow scrunched up under his head. Cas smiled it was easy to see the child Sam had been, he seemed to go back to childhood in sleep. He closed the door, the second guest room was directly opposite the first, the door was open and Dean was sat up staring at him.
“You mean besides feeling like I’ve been in a blender, yeah I’m great Cas” she grinned.
“I know your there, Choirboy” she said, without turning round.
“I’m sorry Dean, I should’ve told you earlier”
“I told you, I’m a hunter. Thats all. Look at me you would know if I was lying” she held very still as he stared at her. The hand holding the blade wavered and Cas turned away. Chris relaxed as he placed the weapon on the bedside table.
“Uh?” Sam was holding his phone, for a second he glanced at it as if trying to remember what it was. “Ariela just called, she says Gabriel is alive and Chris is going to kill him.”
“Alright sorry got distracted, anyway these different universe are held apart by this web of spacey wacey, timey whimey stuff”
“You won’t” he dropped a kiss on her forehead, “I’ll go with you”
A short time later Sam pulled the Impala over to the kerb, Chris looked at him in disbelief. “you’re kidding me right?”
“Shut up Sam” Dean shook his head and followed Cas out.
“Is she alive” Dean asked when Cas nodded, he pulled his own jacket from his shoulders and tucked it over her. “If it’s shock we need to keep her warm. We should go before evil Colonel Sanders decides to come back”
“Where is Chris?”Cas’ blood ran cold.
“Plenty of porn movies do too” Cas managed to keep his voice completely deadpan, Dean however started coughing and spluttering. “You just choke on your beer?”
“Thank you”
“Well, you do seem to be having really hot sex, a lot.” This was Dean lightening the mood Cas knew, he went along with it.
“I love you too and merry Christmas,” Cas cut the call unwillingly, he wanted desperately to go home it’s Christmas for goodness sake, jack’s first at home as well, the thought made him feel worse. He glanced at the mantel clock, nine in the morning. He hadn’t slept and he didn’t feel tired that was a good sign maybe his grace was restoring itself?. He hoped so, he disliked feeling vulnerable.
“Ach I know.” Fiona shrugged, Cas could see the sadness in her face. He took a step forward.
“No I’ll be honest I’ve not been to sleep yet.”
“Well what is it?”
“No Castiel I made children and they were beautiful, do you remember them?”
“Hear what?” Cas looked confused.
“okay fine, but you eat, deal?”
“Cas, baby don’t lie to me,” she knew something was wrong. He bit his lip, caught in the lie and lost for words. He couldn’t even look at her. Chris sat up, her face unreadable.
“Cas? As in Castiel?” he narrowed his eyes at her and frowned, “how do you know Cas?” Chris turned away trying to hide the blood rushing to her face.
Sherlock couldn’t sleep, it was one of those nights when his brain would not shut down. Ignoring the cramps in his legs he lay as still as he could and listened to John’s snores. He was loathe to disturb his slumbering husband, he knew John had had a busy day in sickbay, but he could sense the mania beginning to cloud over his mind. That feeling as his neurons fired too fast and his skull seemed too small, he felt wrong. Carefully he shifted onto his back, stretching his toes out, trying to focus on bodily sensation the way Counsellor Troi had shown him. It didn’t work, not this time, his mind had other ideas. He gave in swinging his legs out of bed as smoothly as possible. He paused by their daughters crib; Rosamund was sound asleep, fists waving in some infant dream, satisfied Sherlock padded into the living room and sat himself down at his desk.
“My apologies sir, but we detected an unknown vessel, so far no response to our hails.”
“In theory”
“in Strathcarron”
“Then you would be dead, I thought you were for a while.” She brushed a tear from his cheek.
“I like it.” Awkwardly Cas brought his hand from around his back revealing a bouquet of sweet smelling small white flowers nestled in dark green leaves.
“Dean” Sam probably, about to try making peace again.
“Come in” he managed to mutter and staggered to his feet. The doors slid open and there was Castiel, his face creased with concern.
“This ain’t bible study boy, he did it to get rid of us me and my brothers and sisters who chose humanity over Daddy.”
“Ahh well she is a happy child and no mistake. What about you everything comfortable?” the girl didn’t answer, her eyes flicked over to Cas.
“It’s over Chris, please just stop.” he could feel her panic at being helpless and her horror that it was him doing this to her. Shame engulfed him, “I’m sorry.” There was a bang as the door was slammed open and the sound of running feet.
"What?"
“I need your help now, get Sam”
“Thanks Cas.”
“I have never asked you for anything-”
“Dean, are you alright.”
“The child was well?”
“ Cas you don’t understand stay back, If I do this he will come.” There were tears on her cheeks, Cas felt his heart break.
“Chris, I’m sorry about the way I’ve behaved.” he said quietly as he rinsed plates
“It’s about Chris.” Cas heard him sigh.
“No, but like I told you, I don’t want to face my sister otherwise.”
“Oh come on Sam, I’m dying of boredom here.”
“Where are you going?” She didn’t answer and the door slammed as she left.
“Are you out of your mind girl?” Asasa demanded as soon as the door clicked shut. “Do you have any idea how dangerous it is taking up with an angel-especially that angel?”Chris took a step back, her aunts rages were formidable. “And where are his friends? Those Winchester boys, they are never far away.” Chris didn’t bother asking Asasa how she knew about Sam and Dean, her aunt had always seemed to know everything about everything.
“You want to know about your grandfather, read the bible it’s all in there-well the highlights anyway” Ariela snorted.
“Always, so do you want to tell me?”
“Uh Jody.” Sam lied
“Can you heal her” Cas asked, afraid of the answer.
“I work out of New Orleans, but I grew up in England.”
“I don’t know how.”This was agony, not for the first time Cas wished he had punched Chuck in the face, how could He have let this happen? Cas hoped whatever dream she was trapped in was at least a happy one. “Dream” he muttered to himself an idea forming, he touched her cheek. He locked the door, took off his trench-coat and suit jacket placing them neatly on the armchair loosened his tie and crawled in to bed. He gathered Chris to him, “Okay I’m coming to get you” he lifted her face towards him softly kissed the cold lips, and tried to slip behind her eyes.
“Maybe I have had more than one” a grudging answer, but at least he was talking. “were you born in England?” he was trying to deflect the conversation.
“so did she, Gabriel didn’t get all his tricks from Lucifer”
After pulling on pants and his shirt, he found her in the library still visibly angry, pulling books from the shelves and slamming them down on the table. She had pulled several cards from the index and left them strewn about the floor. Cas forbore to comment, knowing Sam would be pissed, he was OCD about the bunkers filing system. “What are you doing?”
“I wish I was but its true.” he shrugged. “He actually said it, just say the words ‘pizza man’ to him, that angel will blush like the sun rising.”Chris got out the car, Sam did likewise he couldn’t shake the guilty feeling, “are you sure you don’t want to stay here tonight at least. I’m sure Cas will be back soon.”
“But I don’t sleep.“
“You’re right I have got to stop saying that” the Doctor started rooting around in the pockets of her coat. “so this stuff, the timelords call it the void, is null. No energy, nothing, but it’s disappearing and when that happens” The Doctor stopped, her expression suddenly anxious.
“One more thing aunty, I have a question”
“Alright, I’ll help you.” Gabe said softly, “ you asked me, why Norway?” he turned to the fjord, “Because this is where I became Loki, well not quite here, the sea level has risen a bit. There used to be a glacier here,” he shrugged. “That’s global warming for you I guess.”
“Tough day?” the bar keep asked.
“Fine, one minute” Cas folded his arms and directed what he hoped was an intimidating stare at Dean’s stricken face.
“yeah 1969 triumph GT6, I may have an American accent now, but I was born British.” She opened the door. “Sam?”
“Sam, make the call,” Dean snapped, before Cas could argue further. Sam nodded and dialled the number.
“That chick does not mess around.”
“Yes Heavily” another sound but from inside this time followed by a shout of alarm.
“They are in Kansas, Aunty.”
“The tetryon and tachyon emissions ?”
“I said take the day off lieutenant. Now”
“I know, lets go home.”
“Your Enochian is improving”
“Aunty Asasa, this is Castiel he is my friend.” Chris held out her hand Cas took it and stood next to her.
“Well what’s wrong?” Cas demanded, Dean gripped the angel’s shoulder a little tighter. He didn’t like the way Ariela’s hands flitted over Chris, she looked confused, on the edge of panic.
“May I remind you that I existed for several billion years before your species pulled itself out of the mud! I am more than capable of making my own decisions, I do not need or require your supervision!”
“Who, you may have to be a little more specific. I have more than one guest.”
“Chris” her name was a pleasure laden sigh. Cas wanted all of her, he wanted to feel her skin against his. He pulled her shirt apart, the buttons clattered on the floor,  he pushed her down and climbed on the table. He kissed the base of her throat and worked his way down slowly, every shiver of pleasure from her salty skin sending lightening bolts to his groin making his cock jerk in his jeans. Her hands caught his belt and freed him, he gloried for a moment in the warmth of her hand, but slipped her grasp and his tongue continued its dance down her body. He gripped the waist band of her jeans, while his tongue teased her belly button. She looked down at him eyes pleading for something. He pulled her jeans down in a smooth motion and sank his head between her legs. Chris made a soft cry as he sank his tongue inside her, her knees rose and she spread herself wide. Her hand gripped his hair urging him on, but he stopped. He stood up and grabbed her hips pulling her towards him. Gently he pushed the tip of his cock into her while rubbing her clit gently with his thumb, she moaned as he slipped inside and pulled out slowly. Savouring the feel of her as she quivered at each stroke, the ache in his groin building as she started to pull him in. Chris sat up, pulling his head down for a hungry kiss wrapping her arms and legs round him tightly.
“Not a day,  A couple of hours. See you later.”
“No of course not”
“Cas, you’re not the only person to make a bad decision to save the ones you love.”
“You’re lucky to have them, No-one should do this job alone.” There was something painful in her voice, Cas glanced at her, she was staring out the window.
“Your fingers are cold”
“Where am I, I’m sorry my memory is hazy”
“How do you know?” Picard seemed to have completely forgotten about Sam and Eileen. The Doctor pulled a key triumphantly from her coat.
“What the hell have you been doing?”
“My last baby girl, I protected her. Warded her against those that would use her and now” she paused, her face a mask of rage, “because of you Castiel she is with that thing Asmodeus and only my father knows what he plans to do with her.”
“Just don’t okay.” Cas went cold, he reached for her. she let him curl his arms around her, her head lying on his shoulder and her breath tickling his ear.
“Cas, I’m sorry, oh god.” Chris realised she was sat up in bed, the sheets tangled round her body. She shivered, the cold of her dream still raising goosebumps on her skin.
“No I didn’t Cas, you should have told us.” or maybe I should have noticed, Dean was feeling like more and more of a callous moron. “So, a magical pain killer?”
“Because of the stick up their butt?”
“Yes Dean, I still have a career.” Sam said sharply, Dean was hurt, it must have shown on his face because Sam’s expression softened. “Are you going to be alright?”
“Right and it will all be puppies and candyfloss.” Dean stood up “Okay, we will give it some time Sammy, but if he’s not back by tonight. We find a way to drag his arse out of there.”
“Do you have any idea, how much trouble you are in? you head butted Worf. The only reason you are not in the brig is because I told them you were mentally unstable.”
“Slut” the spirit growled, the voice seemed to come from every where at once. Cas drew Fiona back a pace and took the poker from her.
“No don’t look, none of this is real, but you have to want to leave. do you understand?” Chris nodded. “I can get you out of here, but you have to trust me”. Cas could feel the magic congealing around him, trying to lure him into the false reality. He saw a flash of his own hell, Deans bloodied face as he held an angel blade over his heart. He pushed the suggestion away forcefully.
“I think you do Aunty, tell me the truth. I nearly died, if Cas hadn’t been able to break the warding-”
“Fine, I’ll take you to him!” The demon squealed. Chris shoved him away, taking pleasure in the way he cowered on the floor.
“Sure thing Cas, uh ‘PRG TELOC’” Sam intoned the enochian words effortlessly and the flames died down instantly. Cas was mildly impressed.
The door choose that moment to open and Sam strode out nearly colliding with Cas, who took a step back an embarrassed smile crawling across his face, he scrambled for an excuse as to why he was stood outside their quarters looking like a love struck teenager.
“Chris, no one is saying you can’t decide-” Sam rising from his seat, trying to sound conciliatory, but coming off a little patronising.
“So?”John noticed that Dean’s voice had lost some of it’s brittleness.
This chapter, mild sex, grace kink (abit) usual angst, talk of death.
“It was Asmodeus.“ he admitted.
“your grand daddy could, if he was minded, but he never liked the idea of grand kids.”
“Ach, it’s no problem. You know you apologise a lot for a yank.”
“Yes Mom, I talked to the damned Doctor.” Dean sipped at his scotch, Sam stared at him open mouthed.
“Gabe you know what I meant”
“Not in this world honey.” Hints of the south in her voice and other places Cas was not able to identify.
“Too far,” she wriggled against him delicously, “lounge, second door in the hall”
“Sam what the hell!”
A soft cry from Rosamund broke his concentration, he heard John groan as he was woken by their daughter’s cries.
Her head pounding, Chris surfaced from a formless black sea. She was lying face down on something soft, her questing fingers felt the roughness of cheap motel sheets. Some one was gently and carefully wiping her back with a cold wet cloth. She froze, “who’s there?”
“Before she left, what did Ariela say to you?” Dean didn’t respond immediately, he licked his lips and avoided Cas’ eyes the way he always did when he had to say something difficult.
“Like you have never done something stupid for a girl?”
“So what are we going to do? We need to find Chris and quickly” Sam, always needing a plan.
“I know that, but God could!”
“And what about that” Dean nodded at the whisky bottle.
“Yes, by some miracle.”
“Okay, I’ll give it to ya. I know a rising star when I see one.” obsequiously, he bowed and backed down the steps, “You remind me very much of our dear lord Lucifer when he was young.” He gestured to the vacant throne. “All yours my Lady.” Chris ignored his words, the fool was actually being serious.
“Can you focus for one second!” Cas growled, irritated beyond measure he had to stop himself from knocking the tub out of Chucks hand.
“No Cas it’s not that, don’t you feel it?”
“And”
“It’s too late” she whispered in his ear then the world turned white. Cas had a single glimpse of Chris her mouth open wide in a soundless scream before he was blinded.
“are you okay sugar?”
“Sorry what?”
“Cas, am I going to be ok?”
The door opened at a touch, Cas walked in first, angel blade held ready, Chris was stood behind the bar pulling a beer. She glanced up smiled at him and held up a finger.
“Baby, I was just trying to protect you. Won’t you come home now?”
On the way home from sioux falls Cas stops in a bar and meets a curiously familiar stranger, someone who will turn his life and his understanding of the world upside down. But Cas loves Dean, Can an angel love two people? must he choose? or will events take the choice from him?

“He left, I made him leave, he wanted to-” Chris muttered
“I’m going to the store.” Cas muttered and stalked up the steps
“umm, sorry if this is too personal, but is there anybody at home? You have been through a lot, might not be a good idea to be alone.”
“No, and I’m not sure what to do now.”
“I’ll get Dean” Cas grabbed Sam’s arm.
“Yes.” Cas muttered, Dean was looking at him intently. There was a message in his eyes, ‘this is us’ he seemed to be saying. But Cas wasn’t buying it any-more, what the hell was the point of keeping each other safe and waiting for some mythical ‘right time’ which may never arrive. He was tired of it, tired of pretending everything was fine and he cared about Chris. Thinking about her caused a new ache in his chest, a twin for the near constant pain Dean still caused him. Why couldn’t you just love me he asked silently.
“Or what?”
“Gabe, this is a rescue” Dean called out, the archangel swung in his direction and took a couple of steps forward.
“Well yes, he mine now ain’t ya boy. Now kill this bitch for me!” To Asmodeus’ obvious consternation, Gabriel didn’t move. Chris laughed out loud.
“Donna just called”
“No I do not need your protection and I will save myself!”
“I need to possess you expel the poison, but your body is warded. It will be painful” Cas could feel her heart racing. “If you stay here you will die.” For a moment he thought she was going to refuse.
“but why take her at all?” Sam interjected, “if she was no-one just a random hit I could understand.. but he wanted her.”
“well you made up for that.” Dean said with a grin, Sam’s mouth dropped open.
“What are you doing here.”
“Yes it’s me Dean”
Cas read the message and his throat went dry, this was it then. He could hear Chris humming to herself in the kitchen. He couldn’t wait, he followed the sound finding his way to a large room dominated by an old fashioned range and a scrubbed oak table. Chris was standing by the sink rinsing out a vase, Cas loitered by the door frame and watched her. She had tied her thick wavy hair into a messy bun, his fingers itched to pull out the ribbon and watch it fall down her back.
“She’s a new friend Dean and she is hurt”
“Yeah, of course”
“and how was your day Sammy?”
“Why, so you two can hurt each other some more?” That shut him up, “I am not going to pretend to know what is going on with you two, but I know Cas loves you and Sam. So take a chill pill and back off Dean.”
“Well I don’t fancy the drive back tonight, I’ll gladly stay.” Sam looked at his brother, “Come on Dean, you can’t really want to drive anywhere else tonight.” Dean looked round at all three of them, and gave up.
It was cold by the water, Chris pulled the collar of Cas’ trench-coat round her face and shivered. Of course she didn’t have to be cold, not really. She could have warmed herself with a thought, but there was something so clean about the brisk winter breeze. So she let herself shiver and enjoyed the way the air tugged at her hair. “I know you are there, why so shy?”
”Of course, I knew we should have chained him in the dungeon. Grab the stuff from the trunk and follow me.”
“I see” Linda took off her glasses and rubbed the bridge of her nose.
This Chapter: Things take a nasty turn.
“And who is she,” he demanded turning his attention to the archangel. Ariela had paused in her healing to stare at the interloper, her head tilted on one side, eyes narrowed suspiciously.
“Gabriel, do you know who I am?” No answer, disgusted Chris moved a little closer  “What have you done to him?”
“It was me” Chuck was standing a few feet outside the painted star, arms folded.
For a long time she thought that perhaps she had been thrown in here to rot, but eventually the door opened and a small bowl of food and a mug of water was shoved across the floor. The first time she knocked over the water in her haste to slake the thirst that had plagued her for hours. The smell of the food revolted her stomach and she couldn’t bring herself to eat it. The second time the demon bringing the food looked round the door before shoving the tray across the floor, Chris did her best to present a picture of cowed terror, not difficult considering what she must look like. The Demon grunted in satisfaction and the door banged shut. So they were feeding her, that meant they wanted her alive and if they wanted her alive that made them stupid. She ate the food holding her nose, huddled back under her blanket summoned last nights last good memory into her mind and forced herself to sleep.
“What is it you want?”
“Yes I’m fine, thank you Ma’am.” The woman didn’t look convinced she directed a baleful stare at the window of Asasa’s hoodoo shop.
“Well I need a drink Dean.” A note of sarcasm there.
“Ariela?”Cas pushed Dean away and stepped forward unbelieving, “but sister you died, you died in flood.”
“Three?”
“You know lying is a sin right?” Chris had trouble keeping her voice calm, it was difficult, part of her, the human part wanted to run screaming from the room.
“Maybe a little.” she admitted sounding distinctly un-apologetic and pushed back harder against him. It was Cas’ turn to groan, he nipped her earlobe and teased a nipple with his thumb.
“Is it true, is she like me?” Jack was smiling his face fell as he saw how still Chris was. Cas rounded the desk and sat down next to Chris, he waited expecting to have to defend himself to Jack, but his son radiated sadness.
“There is a spell, Asmodeus was going to use me to rip the grace from all of the angels in heaven.” she paused biting her lip. “I realised I could change it, just need some pure non human contaminated archangel grace.”
On the way home from sioux falls Cas stops in a bar and meets a curiously familiar stranger, someone who will turn his life and his understanding of the world upside down. But Cas loves Dean, Can an angel love two people? must he choose? or will events take the choice from him?
A quick glance at the date told her it had been a year in normal space- time since her last visit. It had been considerably longer than that for her- several billion years and two regenerations longer, ‘
This Chapter: Sam gives some advice, Cas tries a new form of transport and Dean gets quite annoyed. Also angst.
“You can’t. you’re not strong enough.” Asmodeus’ face twitched into a snarl.
It hurt, every one of Chris’ nerve endings screamed as Cas stripped the warding from her bones, from her flesh.  Cas gritted his teeth against their shared agony and continued to burn his way out, if he stopped now they would both be trapped. He was dimly aware of Chris’ psyche clinging to him, her soul crying out with the pain of it. Abruptly the warding shattered and the pain vanished. Quickly Cas eradicated the ghoul’s poison, healing their vessel’s hurts with a thought.
This Chapter: Chris learns what Cas did. Angst, talk of dying implied sex
“Just what?”
“It’s true, I was broken years before I met you, you saved me. Without you where would me and Sam be?” Dean rested his head against Cas’ shoulder, glorying in the fact he could do that now.
“Sickbay? Ahh that’s right, knocked my head didn’t I?” She reached up and pulled off the cortical stimulator. “I think I am alright now though, where’s Jean-Luc?” she looked around wildly.
“Dammit Cas I told you it was a bad idea!”
“Mr Worf thinks otherwise”
“She’s saying her name, it’s Enochian ‘I am the child of Ariela’”
“Maybe we should uh, move out of the kitchen?” he tilted her face towards him and very carefully kissed her.
“Not particularly,” Sam took a firm hold of Dean’s shoulder. “We are going home now.”
“Nothing, just the miracle that is you.” He kissed her, but the phone continued to ring.
“And if it isn’t fine?” his tone pleaded with her.
“Yes Odin Allfather, king of Asgard; our Dad, he died recently” The giant blonde one looked away, his brother patted him on the shoulder gently.
“I dreamt I lost you again. Not just you, Sam and Jack too.” Dean chewed his lip, saying the words brought the fear back, the fear of losing all of them. “Chris was there, she burned. I’m worried Cas, what if extracting her grace doesn’t work?”
“Somebody must be able to fix her, we can’t just give up” Jack looked round at them all.
“Watch where you are going lieutenant.” Will Riker regarding him with his usual disapproving stare.
“I love you too choir boy” she murmured, hand coming to rest over his heart, he pulled her closer “You know what I miss most about about being human?”
Cas stalked through the corridors, he needed air and time to think, Sam called out to him as he swept past the kitchen.
“Angel with a shot gun?” he asked eyebrow raised. Chris shrugged.
“Can’t we just go home.” He asked raising his eyebrows suggestively. She laughed and shook her head.
“She must have warded herself” Sam shrugged and sat down at the kitchen table.
“Chris?”
“Dean, I’m not lying to you!” Cas was annoyed, Dean could tell by the way the angels eyes narrowed.
“More productive than yours obviously, how did go with the Doctor?”
“No me neither Cas.”Dean took his friend by the shoulders, “Just breath, buddy.”
“Don’t you lie to me. I know you seraph, inside and out” she drew back her foot and kicked him hard in the chest, the pain was intense he tasted blood. Then she withdrew, and sat on the counter arranging her skirts meticulously. “You may get up” she told them regally. Cas struggled to his feet. Dean was staring at him, his expression full of concern Cas avoided his eyes. “Did it ever occur to you to say no to her, Castiel?”
“Hope is a terrible thing on the scaffold Dean.”
“Yes” that came out more savagely than Dean intended. The doctor removed his hand nonplussed.
“Not one move further gentlemen or I’ll crush this pretty things throat.”
“Castiel, you are a hot mess.”
“Hi Data, I was just reviewing the original survey. There are some odd concentrations of sub-atomic particles recorded.”
“Well be careful what you wish for, Hamlet ended up dead.” Cas went very quiet, he must have given some kind of out ward sign because Chris shook herself awake and he found himself trapped by that dark gaze.
“Sorry Doctor who?”
Ariela placed her hand on Chris’ forehead, her eyes  tightly shut in concentration. After a moment her eyes flicked open again, she sat down heavily and picked up Chris’ wrist, her fingers finding the pulse point. Dean wasn’t positive, but Ariela looked pale.
“Like a different position?” Cas managed to keep his voice dead pan, who the hell was Dean Winchester to lecture him on long term relationships?
“Yes.”
“No safe distance from what?” Sam wandered in and extracted a beer from the fridge.
“Three times since the creation, is not a problem.”
“That is enough Dean.”
He decided to wake Fiona, Cas knew he should probably let her sleep after all she had had a busy night. But the empty silent house was getting to him in some way he couldn’t define. He went into the small kitchen, fed the wood stove until it was blazing cheerily and set the kettle boiling. Almost on automatic he lit the old fashioned oil lamps and built up the fire in the living room as well. It was oddly soothing reminding him of those weeks with Kelly at the cabin. The memory still made him smile even if it was tinged with sadness. Taking care of her and feeling Jack’s kicks growing stronger every day had been on of the most peaceful times of his life, okay it had ended horribly, but still he cherished it. He found the coffee and managed to make a decent pot with the unfamiliar stuff, British coffee was weird. Carefully he carried the mug upstairs, there were only two doors on the landing, one was open revealing a shadowy bathroom and the other was firmly closed. Cas knocked lightly and opened the door. He had meant to leave the coffee, shake her shoulder gently and leave her to wake up. He took one step through the door and froze. A man was sitting on Fiona’s bed, his head turned to one side watching her sleep. For a moment Cas wondered whether Fiona had simply neglected to tell him about a husband or a boy friend. The figure glitched like an old fashioned movie and Cas realised the room was much colder then it should be. He took a step forward, a floor board cracked under his shoe and the thing turned its gaze on him. It’s eyes were blue and the look in those eyes was murderous. Cas estimated who ever the man had been he had been in his twenties when he died. On the bed Fiona stirred, the ghost glanced back down at her and with a snarl at Cas vanished.
