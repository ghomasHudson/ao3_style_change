Slowly, Sherlock removed himself from John, who could detect a slight tint of red on his friend cheeks. To be fair, he probably didn’t look less embarrassed himself. He sat up and stretched out with a tired groan. Were they going to address this? John thought of something to say, just anything to break the silence so they could move on, but never got the time when Sherlock saw his puzzled face.
“Oh, that. Yeah.”
A perk of living alone is that there’s no one around to complain when you conduct highly hazardous experiments at 3 AM. This night in particular, Sherlock is sitting at the kitchen table, which, to be honest, looks more like something you’d find in a laboratory, burning some chemicals. He’s in his own little bubble, completely absorbed with the experiment, but somehow a noise that makes Sherlock look up manages to pierce through that mental wall surrounding him.
By the time John was back, the moment, or whatever that had been, was over, and both men grew quiet, leaving Sherlock with plenty of time to analyze the situation while pressing a package of frozen chicken to the large bruise on his abdomen. Had John seen through Sherlock’s lie and realized the true intentions behind the staring, and if so, had that made John uncomfortable? John’s face was impossible to read. He focused entirely on taking care of the wounds now, not meeting Sherlock’s gaze at all. On second thought, John had gone terribly quiet, hadn’t he? Of course. Sherlock recognized this scenario too well. Had he gone too far with the deductions? There was always the possibility that John had become completely agitated and decided that the best solution would be to just stop everything. The conversation, the friendly looks - all of that. That’s what people did when they were uncomfortable, right? A sudden urge to do something, just
“And from your left arm”, John added. “God, what have you been up to?”
John smiled.
Sherlock forces out a “yes” in response.
The praise sends a beam of warmth through Sherlock’, and a tiny
“Yeah, I’ve noticed”
Mr Holmes seemed more than fine with it, so with that, John pressed the completely silent phone against his ear and bolted for the nearest exist with a “Merry Christmas, Harry!”. When he came close to the doorway, Mrs Holmes’ voice was heard.
Confrontation. Great. Just what John needed to boost his mood. An annoyed sigh escaped him as he crossed his arms.
Sherlock.
“So when were you planning on coming back?” John replied, sounding slightly harsher than he’d intended to. “God, Sherlock, we need to talk about your parents.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but did fight back John’s feet until they both found themselves resting comfortable against each other, legs tangled, as the conversation died down for another minute or two.
Perhaps it was a childish reaction, but John couldn’t help to feel as though it was somewhat unfair of Sherlock to not help him tackle this. After all, it was his bloody parents. Knowing him, he’d undoubtedly already deduced how his parents felt about this, and if he’d only been here he’d probably been able to divert the conversation by now. John helplessly scanned the room for his friend, but alas. The only other signs of life in the lounge was Mrs Holmes talking to a clearly bored Mycroft at a table across the room. Where on Earth had the man gone?
“Um, hey Mary. What’s up?”
It’s understandable that John doesn’t sound too excited when he picks up. His voice sounds as if it’s on the verge of shaking. The man must be panicking, and Mary notices.
“John, you should know that I don’t care about your sexual preferences. Do I really look like your average homophobic heterosexual man?”
There was in this moment it began to dawn on John that it was actually Christmas. It was Christmas, and not only was he going to spend it with Sherlock, but with him and the man’s family. A family he had never met, and had no idea what they’d think of him, let alone what they expected him to be like. When John had voiced his concerns to Sherlock two weeks earlier, the night when the invitation first had arrived, he’d simply shrugged and brushed it off with an unbothered “it’ll be fine”, and turned his attention back to the experiment he’d been conducting. John knew it was not going to be fine. For all he knew, Sherlock’s parents could be anybody, and judging by their sons, John almost feared them, having created a mental image of two absolutely terrifying geniuses who probably reproduced asexually. No, this was not good, and as if meeting the parents wasn’t bad enough, meeting the parents during Christmas added a whole new layer of pressure.
“Mm. I know.”
“Um”, Sherlock began, but didn’t get the time to follow it up with a quick “I’m fine” and then proceed to move on with his life before he was interrupted by Watson.
“I’ve really fucked up now, haven’t I? Greg, I was planning to break up with her! I can’t just do that after saying something like that. I’d look like the biggest arsehole ever!”
John beamed back at his fake lover. They really had bought it.
“I- Um. He… Sherlock-” he stammered, taken aback by the question that he definitely wasn’t ready to answer.
The couple laughed, and Mrs Holmes reached out a hand to touch John’s arm.
“It’s really no big deal. I didn’t even hear the entire conversation.”, Sherlock tries, even though it’s not true. Anything to get that expression off of John’s lovely face.
Sherlock can’t stop staring. Can’t tear his gaze away from John.
John was very much aware of that the concept of “meeting the parents” was heavily associated with introducing one’s romantic partner to the family, and having Mrs Holmes put it like that, was suggesting things that John was too scared to even think about. The occasional assumption by strangers that John and his flatmate were dating was something he’d grown used to, but this was different. Oh, it was different. This was more than just a suggestive comment by a waiter, or a presumptuous Scotland Yard detective. John looked back and forth between Mr and Mrs Holmes, who had moved on to discuss something with Mycroft and occasionally Sherlock, who would jump into the conversation to make a snarky remark from time to time.
This was the coldest day so far since John and Sherlock has first arrived in the town, and the snow crunched underneath the two men’s feet as they walked in silence down the road. It was so freezing that Sherlock had even taken the time to attach the incredibly soft looking fur collar to his coat. John hadn’t had any specific route in mind when he’d prompted the walk, but Sherlock seemed to know where he was going, so John followed. As they reached the end of the street, Sherlock took a left, leading the two of them into a park turned immaculately white. Despite the hour of the day, the snow had been left untouched, completely free from the trails of children playing, or dogs being out on their afternoon walks.
“We don’t have to. If it makes you… uncomfortable.” Sherlock murmured, and John could see the uncertainty in his eyes.
Suddenly, John’s mouth took the form of an “o”, as if he’d just come to a brilliant conclusion.
As if that wasn’t enough, there was also some sort of underlying threat in the conversation - how Mycroft had kept telling John to make the right decisions, think about the consequences, not break anyone’s heart. That thought was unpleasant. Breaking someone’s heart. Breaking Sherlock’s heart? It was these questions that made John hopelessly sink down on the bed. Sherlock was fragile, indeed. When John had first started to get to know his friend, he’d been told countless of times that this man had neither feelings nor compassion. That he was the sociopath he would sometimes still claim to be, but as time went on, John slowly began to see something different behind that facade. It was someone that was the complete opposite of a sociopath. Sherlock himself would never agree with that, but John knew it was there. It was there in the way Sherlock would softly play the violin during those nights that left John awake for hours, how he’d pretend to despise John’s blog, only to be the first person to read the posts, and in all of those small things that John couldn’t tell if Sherlock was aware of doing.
“Yeah, the two of you have been dating for a couple of weeks and the first time you tell her you love her is on the phone. It’s not
Was he? John had no clue. At first the idea of getting to pretend to be in a relationship with Sherlock had been appealing, but the closer John got to actually doing it, the bigger the knot in his stomach grew. Maybe he’d show too much enthusiasm? What if Sherlock saw right through him? Would they be able to continue on as normal after this? John wished he had even the slightest idea of an answer to the questions he had, but that wasn’t the case. Besides, he was the one who’d suggested it, so there really was no backing out at this point.
“What are you on about? I’m fine!”, John half yells, clearly not feeling fine, and a pause follows before John fires back again. “That’s not true! Mary, we went out last week. I do want to spend some time with my friends as well, you know.” A pause follows and John hums a little as Mary talks.
John snorted at Sherlock’s reply, but it didn’t stop his mind racing. The one bed meant that Sherlock’s parents intended for them to share it. To be fair, the bed was of an adequate size to fit two grown men, but it was certainly not larger than that. Sharing it with Sherlock would inevitably include numerous incidents of accidental touching, and the amounts of shared body heat would be massive. The room itself was rather minimalistic, and had no other furniture that could substitute for a bed, so John knew there was no way of getting around this. Tonight was undoubtedly going to be interesting.
Sherlock ransacked his brain for for subjects. None seemed good enough. He glanced at John, who was busying himself with carefully putting a compress on a wound on Sherlock’s hip. Perhaps John didn’t want to talk at all. Perhaps it was better to just stay quiet. Actually, yes. After evaluating the outcome of staying quiet versus making stiff small talk, the safest option was to just shut up, so that’s what he did.
“Hey” John said, nudging his friends slightly.
It wasn’t an entirely untrue prediction, yet the remark made John bite his lip in frustration. That was another Holmes family trait right there. John could swear each and everyone of them had a love for the dramatic.
No more words were uttered after this, and John found himself drifting off to sleep almost immediately to sound of the whining snowstorm outside and the soothing breaths from his friend.
“Shit! Sorry, I know it hurts.”, John yelped. “Actually, give me a second and I’ll fetch something cold for you to put on that”.
“John, I don’t want there to be any misunderstanding here. My intentions are good. Just remember to tread carefully. But please, do what is right.”
Of course, it wasn’t going to be fine. A light knock on the door was all John needed to immediately know something was up. He threw the last piece of clothing into his bag, shut it, and turned his attention towards the person on the other side of door.
“Yeah. Bit unfair to tell them now and upset Mummy during Christmas.”
A single
Still, John couldn’t complain about his whereabouts. This was nice. The picturesque little countryside town gave off a cozy vibe with its elegant lamp posts and colorful Christmas decorations that reminded John of the excitement Christmas used bring when he was very little. It was soothing, walking down a quiet street with a person that meant the world to John, knowing they were going to spend this holiday together, and almost for a second forgetting the horrors that may lie in front of him. John sighed as he waited for the taxi he and Sherlock had ordered, and watched as his breath formed a tiny cloud in front of him.
“Me too. I mean, I like you.”, he says and John blinks at him as if he can’t believe what Sherlock just said, and a large, genuine smile appears on his face - a smile that Sherlock swears could melt glaciers.
“Hm?” the detective replied as he looked up from his phone. “Naturally, I realized they’d never be as discreet as they’d promised, although I did expect them to keep their promise to some extent.”
“John” Sherlock began, carefully observing his fingers that were playing with the blanket. “I should probably have let you in on this, even though I initially thought it would be fine. At least they’d promised not to be so up in our faces about it.”
“It’s been nice”
For the first couple of hours, everything seemed fine, surprisingly fine considering this was Sherlock’s family. John still hadn’t been able to shake off that eerie feeling that this was too good to be true, but still, everything progressed normally, and with the arrival of Mycroft who was in a state of spurious excitement, dinner followed.
“Wait a minute, how long have you known?” he asked, shocked at the idea of Sherlock being able to keep this big of a secret from his own brother
“John?” Sherlock croaked as his hands reached towards his hair to reposition some curls that had fallen out of place.
“Christ, are you bleeding? What happened? Actually, if you’ve got nothing better to do, you could come in and I’ll take care of that. I’m a medical student, so I should know what I’m doing.”, Watson replied with a short laugh.
“It just felt right to kiss him.”, John says and Sherlock’s heart skips a beat as a million questions begin to form in his head.
“Oh, they definitely bought it” he huffed playfully.
To John’s grand disappointment, he woke up to an empty bed. Maybe due to last mornings’ situation that was still unspoken of. Both of them knowing that that happened, and perhaps fearing talking about it would be inevitable if it just happened to occur again. But things moved on. Breakfast was eaten, a brisk morning walk with Mr Holmes was taken, and time crept closer and closer toward 6PM, when the evening train back to London would leave the town. This knowledge filled John up with optimism, and around 2:15 when he happened to glance at his watch, the realization that they had made it washed over him, almost like a tsunami. Despite all of this, it was going to be alright. Sherlock was an idiot. He really was, thinking it was a good idea to lie to his parents about something so fundamental, but everything was going to be alright. The act would come to an end, and hopefully things would go back to normal with John pining over his friend, and now also regretting he hadn’t done more this weekend.
Sherlock replied with no more than a stern look, that John assumed was meant as a “
“There’s only one bed” John stated.
” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Point is though, that I didn’t mean for it to become… like this.”
Greg just blinks, completely taken aback. Tries to say something. Fails. John undoubtedly notices that something’s up, eyes panicking.
Both of them glance over at John, who appears to be in the middle of an argument now, and here is where Sherlock makes his grand mistake. Shaken by the explosion and everything that followed, whatever happened before that and the secrecy of what he did has been pressed into the very back of his mind. Just as the argument with Mary ends and someone hangs up he says what might just be the absolute worst thing that he could possibly have said. He mindlessly looks over at Greg, and answers absently.
“That was- That was
Lovely? There was absolutely nothing lovely about this whole situation, if not… It felt as though the world was moving in slow motion as John tilted his head upwards. There, hung in the door frame with a red ribbon, it was. It only took John a short glance towards the sitting room to know that everyone’s heads were turned towards them, staring in anticipation.
This time Sherlock gets it. He knows what John wants him to say and, Sherlock couldn’t be happier to say it.
It’s embarrassing, really embarrassing to stand in front of John Watson looking like this. It’s their first proper meeting since that night a couple of weeks ago, and Sherlock is standing here, in his dressing gown, which sleeves are now wet from the extinguisher foam, a pair of boxers, and as if that wasn’t enough, his ever so charming safety goggles that are strapped tightly to his face. Christ, he probably looks like some kind of mad scientist, which, to be fair, wouldn’t be too far from away the truth, but John doesn’t need to know that.
“Stop worrying” Sherlock blurted out to John’s surprise. “You spent an extra five minutes getting ready this morning, and checked yourself in the mirror twice before you left the flat. Don’t worry.”
“Of course not! Off you go!”
Watson’s voice cut like a knife through the silence that had started to become rather painful since the two men locked eyes. The neighbour was standing there, wearing a pair of grey flannel pajama pants and a navy sweatshirt. Still, he didn’t look like he’d recently woken up.
Greg is friendly, but it stops there. He has never shown any sign of interest in Sherlock - that’s obvious, but John? The way he looks at Sherlock sometimes can’t be just friendly. He stares, there’s no denying in it. John does what Greg does not. He stares in a way that just friends don’t stare at each other, gives too many pats on the shoulder, and maybe, just maybe waits a bit too long before letting go of the towel he’s just handed Sherlock.
“Hey”, is all John says and eyes him up and down. Not in a judging manner but more in what could possibly be a concerned way.
Most of the time Sherlock was hugely grateful of Mrs Hudson’s kindness, and during the months he had been staying at Baker Street, she had become almost like a second mum to Sherlock with her constant fussing and care. On this very night though, it was a relief to come back home and realize that she’d gone to bed, because even if Sherlock appreciated how much she cared about him, the woman could undoubtedly be somewhat overprotective from time to time.
Looking back at this, Sherlock regretted his decision. If he hadn’t been so stupid, then maybe he wouldn’t have gotten himself in the situation he was in now. Without intending to do so, Sherlock had found himself unable to not care about everything John did. He began to notice which hours John left his flat, what his footsteps sounded like, hell, even what sort of food John cooked. Some might have called it a “crush”, which if confronted with, Sherlock would’ve denied immediately.
“Yeah.”
“Gah, get your feet off me! They’re freezing. I hope your mum has gotten you a nice pair of knitted socks.” John exclaimed as Sherlock’s toes brushed against his calves. “Speaking of your mother though, what on Earth is going on, Sherlock?”
The moment John dared to look up at Sherlock, he saw how the man’s green eyes were sparkling, and John could feel the smile spreading across his own face as he stared right into them.
“My parents?” Sherlock squeaked defensively, almost as if he could sense what was coming next.
“Alright. Alright, so you could deduce Greg? Can you deduce how Greg… How Greg feels about you?”
“I know, and look, it’s not like I’m worried or anything. This is all just… new to me, y’know. I hadn’t even considered the possibility but after
He bent down to pick up his phone, which had thankfully landed with the screen facing down and therefore saved John from having to explain to Sherlock’s parents why he had faked the phone call. When John raised to his full height again, he was met with a puzzled Sherlock. The man opened his mouth, and John could only hear the beginning of a “
“You can borrow my scarf. If you want to” Sherlock blurted out, obviously having noticed the state of his friend.
How the hell were you supposed to reply to that? John knew he was probably just as, if not even more, confused than Mrs Holmes, and was absolutely clueless as to how he was supposed to talk about a relationship that wasn’t even a thing. He couldn’t tell her the truth, but lying was arguably worse. It would be to dig himself, and Sherlock, into a massive hole. He couldn’t put that pressure on Sherlock, could he? Still, they’d be going home in two days, and both men knew where the mistletoe was located now. Sherlock couldn’t possibly have missed the fact that his parents were convinced the relationship between him and John was of a romantic nature. A selfish part of John also recognized this as his only chance to, for just two days, actually experience what he’d been dreaming about.
“You- You told your parents we were dating, what, four years ago, and then we show up, acting like we’ve never laid our hands on each other?”
“Mary? Thank God you’re calling me back. I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean…”, John begins, but is rapidly cut off.
’? Really?”
Sherlock really didn’t tell his parents anything, did he? It was almost as if John was some stranger that Sherlock had just happened to bring along. For all Mr and Mrs Holmes knew, he could be anyone. Actually, from Sherlock’s parents perspective, John’s presence must’ve looked terribly strange with him just showing up, but the encouraging look in Mrs Holmes eyes still gave the impression that no one minded, and the sense of comfort the woman radiated made John feel like opening up. And thus, he told the story of how he, and the man facing him at the dinner table met all those years ago.
Sherlock hummed, allowing himself to think for a moment before answering.
The detective’s lips curled into a genuine smile, as John took a moment to breath in the smell of the scarf. Home, was what it smelled like. Like 221B Baker Street, and like Sherlock.
“Knows what?”, he asks innocently, seeming genuinely curious about what Sherlock might know.
“Tell the others I said goodnight”
There was no doubt that Mycroft knew. The man knew way too much about Sherlock and John’s private life already, and he’d be the first person to know if any developments had occured in their relationship. Actually, John was pretty damn sure that if they’d actually gotten their relationship sorted out sooner, he would’ve been pulled into a car by one of Mycroft’s goons to be given the “Hurt my brother and you’ll end up dead on the bottom of the ocean”-talk right as him and Sherlock would pull away from their first kiss. Point was, Mycroft knew of the situation, and was probably getting some twisted sort of entertainment out of tormenting John about it.
After agreeing to go out for dinner that night with the whole family, John found himself waiting for his food while absently stroking Sherlock’s hand at one of the local restuarants in the town. This all felt so real, terrifyingly so. It had all gone so fast. A couple of hours ago, even letting his hand rest on Sherlock’s shoulder felt scary, almost forbidden, and here he was now, holding the man’s hand without a second thought, as if this was something they did on the regular. As if they really were together. The sudden realization made John want to pull his hand away, because this wasn’t real after all. Tomorrow they would go back to Baker Street, and all of this would stop.
John did his best to not let his smile falter, and could only hope that his eyes didn’t give away his total surprise. Not at all did that make it seem as if Mr Holmes had gotten a very, very askew idea of what kind of relationship John had with his best friend. The friend he’d lived with longer than anyone else, the friend his life revolved around, and perhaps most importantly in this case - the friend everyone thought he was dating. Surely the parents of this very friend wouldn’t be firm believers of any of these rumors, surely not, John told himself, even though he recognized this situation too well. It happened everywhere. At restaurants, crime scenes, even bloody Tescos people made those tiny remarks implying that the two men were more than just friends. Everyone seemed to have it figured out except the two people in the centre of it, and John knew this was the reason those remarks bugged him so much.
Mary? Who the hell is Mary? Sherlock needs to know, but at the same time, a part of him hopes that he'll never find out. Maybe Mary is no one. She probably doesn't even matter that much to John. Just an acquaintance of his. Sherlock knows he's wrong.
“Fine.” John replied reassuringly. “I guess.”
Sherlock nodded.
In the distance, something that sounded like an ecstatic Mrs Holmes was heard, but John didn’t listen. Couldn’t listen. His eyes were locked on Sherlock, unable to tear themselves away from him, knowing that if either of them snapped out of it this would be over and they’d have to deal with the consequences.  The only two things that existed were Sherlock and the mantra John’s brain seemed so keen on repeating.
“Dinner will hopefully be ready in not too long. If only Mycroft would have taken the early train! I swear that man never takes a break.” Mrs Holmes began as she took a right turn at the top of the staircase, leading John and Sherlock towards a white door. “Alright, here are you boys’ bedroom. I’ll just leave you to get everything sorted, and don’t hesitate to ask if there’s anything you need”
“Actually” Mrs Holmes began as she turned around to scan the rest of the room as if looking for something. “Do you have any idea where he is? I haven’t seen him for hours.”
“Please, Mary. Just listen to me. I love you!”, he all of a sudden yells.
The room was lit up in a yellow light from the lamp, revealing what looked like a pretty soaked Sherlock. Some ice crystals were still in his hair and on his coat, but most of them seemed to have melted long ago, making his hair dripping wet. The man himself looked at John with a puzzled expression.
John let out a subtle, but frustrated sniff. This was ridiculously vague. Mr Holmes
Sherlock furrows his brows. What’s not the end of the world? Clearly John is concerned about something. Something serious, that he still can’t help laughing at. Or maybe that’s just the alcohol laughing. If Sherlock hadn’t been to straved on data on John, he probably wouldn’t have cared, but he finds himself
“Oh, tell me more about it” Sherlock teased, drifting closer to John’s face.
“You know, deduce me. Like you deduced Greg.”
“Christ. Sherlock, you’re the most clever person I know. Have you not figured it out?”, John asks, and Sherlock bites his lip in frustration, because John isn’t wrong. Why can’t he just be sure of what John means? Actually, that’s not even the problem. Sherlock knows what John means, or at least he know what it
“Sherlock Holmes”.
Without saying a word, Sherlock took off the coat he’d been wearing ever since he left his own flat earlier today. He watched as John raised his eyebrows.
Sherlock chuckles, because John is right, and it almost feels as though John is someone that knows him for real. So he thinks for a while, carefully choosing a story that’s going to make John laugh and Sherlock’s stomach flutter. Finally, he finds the perfect anecdote and can begin telling the dramatic story of the time he, on complete accident, blew a hole through a table during one of his chemistry lessons in sixth form. To Sherlock’s great pleasure, John and Greg seem unable to stop laughing as Sherlock describes the horrifying look on his former professor’s face, and as Sherlock talks, a sudden warmth has slowly began spreading all throughout his body.
John was stopped with another kiss.
Light stomps that can only come from someone running up the staircase are heard, and soon a man that looks about the same age as John appears in the doorway. He runs a hand through his dark hair and looks at Sherlock with tired eyes that somehow still seem alert. John doesn’t question the man’s presence, so Sherlock assumes this must be Greg.
“Sherlock, can you please hurry up?” John shouted impatiently from the bottom of 221B’s staircase, as he peeked towards the front door, knowing there was an even more impatient cab driver waiting behind it.
“And what about me?”, John asks quietly, but not weakly. He’s determined.
He’s not wrong. Even though the smell has began to disperse it lingers subtly in the air, and when a waft of air that makes Sherlock’s nose tickle hits him, he’s reminded of the fact that a window needs to be opened. With a “just a moment” to John and Greg, Sherlock strides across the room to finally get some fresh air into the flat. Somehow though, the two men at his door takes this as an invitation to step inside and take a good look around the flat, which makes sense, because 221B truly is a lot. There’s stuff in every corner of the flat. Stuff that ranges from the most ordinary things like coffee cups and books to human skulls and crime scene evidence that Sherlock really shouldn’t be keeping. And then there’s the kitchen. The kitchen hasn’t been touched since the fire was put out, and the table is now overflowing with extinguisher foam that’s slowly starting to drip down on the floor. Sherlock notices how John’s eyes lock on it.
“Um, John. I should probably apologize to you” Sherlock began out of nowhere.
John let out a breath that he didn’t know he’d been holding, and leaned in closer towards his friend.
” John breathed as they finally pulled apart.
Apart from Mrs Holmes’ remark, dinner was enjoyable with delicious food and good company. Of course, the two brothers’ never ending dispute was as ongoing as ever, but with the exception of that, time passed quickly, and soon John found himself forgetting the uncomfortableness he’d felt earlier that night. He was enjoying himself, and had come to fully accept that Sherlock’s parents were just over all kind, and rather pleasant people to talk to. That was, until the topic about John and Sherlock’s relationship came up again.
Sherlock swallows. Some help would indeed be nice, because there’s not a chance in hell that he’s going to let the flat look like this when Mrs Hudson comes up with his tea the next morning. It’s a wonder that the explosion didn’t wake her up too. Sherlock doesn’t even dare thinking about the chaos that would’ve erupted if his usually sweet, but also very protective, landlady would’ve gotten the opportunity to say something about this.
“Christ, John! Don't pick up! Not when you’re like this.”, Greg hisses, almost as if he thinks Mary is going to hear him otherwise. “What does she want from you at this hour?”
“John, you should know that we really can’t thank you enough” Mrs Holmes exclaimed as everyone involved with the Christmas celebration had one final cup of tea before the departure of John and Sherlock.
Process what? The fact that his kitchen almost caught on fire? No, he’s used to that. What Sherlock really needs to process is John. John and everything John has said tonight. It’s too much to take in. John has made out with a man. John has a crush on a man. John likes men.
There in the doorway, the silhouette of J. Watson was standing, softly illuminated by the lights inside of the flat. Sherlock couldn’t quite figure out whether the neighbour was judging him or if he was simply shocked by Sherlock’s current state, which, to be fair, was below the lowest of standards. Sherlock had seen his reflection in the cab on his way back, and knew he was not a pretty sight.
“Of course! And I'm not… I’m… Fuck. Actually, that makes sense, doesn't it? Me. Being bisexual. Fuck.” The last “fuck” comes out as barely a whisper. Maybe it’s the sound of absolute realization. The moment when all pieces fall into place.
A snort was heard from the detective.
“I’ll get them, no prob-”
“I mean it. He seems so much happier around you, and I truly can’t understand why he’s kept you from meeting us for so long.”
” under his breath and threw off his coat and scarf.
“I didn’t even dare to consider this. That you felt… like that. I never thought you-”
John wriggled his body so that he was facing his friend who busied himself with staring straight into the ceiling above him.
The two went quiet for a moment, but the silence was interrupted by the ringing of the fancy grandfather clock on the other side of the room. As John looked over to the clock’s dial and noticed the time, he saw his escape.
John hesitated for a moment, unsure what to say, but then made up his mind.
Even though Sherlock tries his best to continue with his research, the noises coming from John’s flat won’t stop nagging at the back of his brain. It’s not any special noises at all, just muffled talking, and yet Sherlock wants to know everything. What does John like to talk about? What’s he like around his friends? The voices are coming from what seems to be just underneath Sherlock’s living room, and if only Sherlock moved in there it would be significantly easier to hear the conversation. Maybe he could sneak in there for just a minute and listen to what they’re saying. Yes, that sounds like a good idea. He’ll get up, go to the sitting room, eavesdrop on the conversation for not too long, and immediately get back to the experiment.
“11 o’clock, huh? Maybe it’s time for me to retire. Wanna be well-rested for tomorrow!”, he said with a quick laugh that Mrs Holmes joined in on.
“Sherlock?” he asked as he clicked the on-switch.
As they came closer and closer towards the Holmes residence, so did the fact that John was about to face his fears, and he could feel himself growing more apprehensive with every turn the cab took. Sherlock didn’t comment, but John noticed the detective rolling his eyes at his own reflection in the car window when his friend, at first, unconsciously began tapping his finger on the car seat. Slowly, the landscape outside of the window began to change, becoming more countryside than town, with bigger and fancier houses. Finally, the car started slowing down in front of one of the houses. It was one of the bigger buildings in the area, with bright brick walls and large windows with warm light scintillating out of them. A narrow path had been shoveled into existence from the road to the door, and in the deep snow surrounding the path, the top straws of a group of dormant plants peeked up, hinting at a garden. The house seemed completely normal - no ominous mansion with moats or towers at all. I fact, it even felt inviting.
“So. Uh, if you’ll just find somewhere to sit down I’ll go get my medical kit, okay?”, Watson finally said and left the room after making a broad gesture into the lounge as an invitation for Sherlock to take a seat.
“It is, and you should be happy for your brother!” Mrs Holmes warned with a light smack on her son’s arm. “You might need someone like John in your life to cheer you up”
John cut him off.
John didn’t have to look at the detective on his left side to know that he was rolling his eyes.
“Hey, Sherlock?” John suddenly asked after a minute of silence. “‘
“I concur” Sherlock giggled.
“Shut up, Mycroft.”
Being offered the scarf felt almost like an honor. Though it had been replaced every once in a while over the years, the signature blue scarf was something that had stayed with Sherlock ever since John had met him back in 2010. It was the only type of scarf John had ever seen him wear, and the thought of Sherlock not wearing it was… strange, almost as if it had become a part of the man. It reminded John of how it felt to see someone who always wore glasses take them off for the first time when Sherlock began to untie it from his neck, not even waiting for John to answer him.
“My brother is fragile, John, and it is of the utmost importance that he stays stable. You if anyone should know this.” he said, without taking his eyes off of John for even a split second. “I’ll admit that I was fairly surprised to find out about this game he’s been playing, but-”
Sherlock blinked. Stayed like that for another five seconds. Then he shook his head and darted out of the room.
Sherlock listens closely as Greg tries to talk some sense into his friend, mentioning that John should sleep on the matter and simply think all of this through tomorrow. If Sherlock’s deductions are correct, there are two possible scenarios. John is either worried that the person he kissed won't feel the same, or he has just had his first experience with a man which has left him perplexed.
“Shut up”
“Sorry, by the way, I haven’t even had the time to introduce myself. John Watson”. Watson, or, well, John, reached out his hand to shake Sherlock’s. Sherlock grabbed it and gave a firm shook.
So Sherlock says what must be it.
Mrs Holmes stayed quiet for a second as she looked at John with that same facial expression Sherlock made when he thought he’d caught a suspect in a lie.
“Not with me?”, he asks softly. “Just me?”
“Yes. I’m sorry, John. However, I greatly appreciate your willingness to play along. You made it a whole lot less insufferable.”
Mr Holmes laughed a hearty laugh, playfully patting his son on the shoulder. Sherlock was visibly squirming in his seat, looking notably on edge, his eyes flickering between his parents. The gaze was penetrating, and John felt a subtle change in Sherlock’s mood. Was that anxiety? It was a change only he had seemed to have noticed, but then, John’s attention constantly seemed to find its way back to Sherlock. With a smile towards his friend that John hoped would come off as reassuring, he turned his attention back to Sherlock’s parents.
“Mind if I join you?” she asked, but took a seat before John had had the time to answer.
“I’m so sorry, Mr Holmes, it’s my sister. Do you mind if I…?” he asked, hoping his voice wasn’t shaking too much.
Was he fine? John didn’t know. Getting to act like this with Sherlock, regardless of the reason why, was more than he’d ever expected out of this trip, and he couldn’t deny that it did bring him immense happiness to know that he could just touch Sherlock like this. This happiness was however beginning to be overwashed by some strange sort of unsettling melancholy that John didn’t get the time to analyze any further, as a waiter arrived at the table with plates of food that would soon make John forget any doubt or uneasiness.
“Earlier, when Violet mentioned that this was the first time in very long that Sherlock has brought someone home, she really did meant it. We love Sherlock, of course, but he’s always been difficult, so you can probably imagine why we were so happy we were when he told us you were coming along. You really must be special to him.” he said.
His pulse instantly picked up as the thought crossed his mind. He could do it. He could just head downstairs, find Sherlock and
When he looks up, John appears paler than ever before. He’s staring at Sherlock, wide eyed and is biting his lower lip. Sherlock doesn’t understand. What did he do wrong? There’s no reason for John to panic, and yet he’s looking at Sherlock like that.
Sherlock said something that sounded like “
By the time the train had reached its destination it had become completely dark outside, despite the fact that it was as early as 4 PM. The air was chilly and a few lonely snowflakes were spiralling down from the sky, sprinkling the hairs of the two men stepping out of the railway station in the small town. The train ride itself had been dull, and aside from having Sherlock claim he wasn’t hungry, only to nick half of John’s snacks, John had found himself staring out of the window for the majority of the time, occasionally dozing off every once in a while, leaving him with a subtle pain in the back that desperately needed to be stretched out.
No question, no matter how delicately phrased, could possibly convey “Do you think Sherlock and I are dating?” without having a horrendous outcome. Have them say yes, and awkwardly have to explain how that was, in fact, not the case and possibly upset both parents, or have them say no and plant the idea in their head. John glanced over at Sherlock and managed to catch the man’s eye. Talking to Sherlock would possibly just make it even worse, so that was a no. He couldn’t talk to Sherlock about this. Sherlock blinked at John, who met him with an innocent smile and turned back to his food.
It was many hours later that John finally woke up to the bright light that was now seeping in through the blinds. The first things that crossed John’s mind was how something felt different. Just different. A subtle scent of sweat and a cologne that wasn’t John’s lingered in the air, but that wasn’t all. As John’s limbs began to move, trying to reach the phone on his nightstand, he was stopped by a crushing weight slung on top of him with its left arm wrapped tightly around John’s chest. A breathing, lightly snoring weight with a birdnest of dark hair that was softly tickling John’s stubbled chin.
“Thanks.” John said, sounding way shyer than he’d planned to, as Sherlock pulled away from him.
“Well. We haven’t.”
Like that, everything went on, and, to John’s relief, his and Sherlock’s relationship wasn’t brought up a single time by Mr and Mrs. Holmes. The act seemed to work almost better than John had anticipated, and when he brought it up to Sherlock later that night as they’d huddled up in bed, the man seemed more than content with the day.
“No, we’re not. Turns out your mother thinks we’re a bit ‘stiff’, for some inexplicable reason. She pulled me aside, Sherlock, because she was worried this-” John gestured between himself and Sherlock. “wasn’t ending well! How bad would it be if we told them the truth?”
“No. Why should we? After all, they are right about us.”
“Stop shouting or you’ll have to answer that to my parents!” Sherlock spat back. “What do
John felt his eyebrows furrow in surprise as he stared at his friend, completely unable to understand what he was doing. Sherlock only apologized when he was aware that he’d done something really bad. Something that had really hurt others, and usually the apology itself never came before John had pointed out that the amends were absolutely necessary. Sherlock pressed his lips together before continuing, staring down at the white ground where he was busying himself with kicking a small pit into it.
. His hands were fidgeting, looking for something to do. John reached for his phone that had been lying on the nightstand, spun it around in his somewhat sweaty hands for a minute, and then unlocked it. He opened the messaging app, and began typing out a text. Erased it. Began typing again, and then hit send before he had any time to regret what he was getting himself into.
Suddenly, Sherlock is hit by a realization. He could confess, couldn’t he? After all he just happened to overhear the conversation. A conversation he has nothing to do with and shouldn’t have heard, yes, but also a conversation which he technically wouldn’t have any use for. John and Greg
When John moved into the flat below Sherlock’s about two months ago, Sherlock couldn’t have cared less about him, truth be told. Based upon the hours the neighbour appeared to leave his flat, he was a student, and after hearing John’s TV play various medicine related documentaries the same week as university finals were coming up, it was safe to assume the man was a medical student. Really just an ordinary guy that goes to school, hangs out with his friends on the weekends and goes grocery shopping way too late at night. No one to waste time on, Sherlock thought. Then came a night that changed everything.
“Well, I’m full of surprises” John scoffed and sat up in the bed.
“So…?”, John begins, and Sherlock becomes shockingly aware of how long he’s been quiet. “I was sort of hoping you’d maybe… I don’t know.”
“Jesus, Sherlock, these past couples of days. They’ve been-“
Or not.
“Yeah. About that, I hope it doesn’t feel like I’m just, I don’t know, barging in here. You know, considering me. Being a bit of a stranger, that is."
“Well, I suppose I am. I mean, I survived tonight. You okay?”
”, but as time progressed, they slipped into the rhythm of it, growing more and more comfortable.
“Yeah. I wasn’t really convinced that it was a crush because, you know, I didn’t even know I liked guys, but fuck, after tonight I’m convinced.”
The gloved finger hovered millimeters from the bell, just about to press it, when the door swung open, forcing Sherlock to quickly take a step backwards. When John turned his gaze towards the person in the door, he was bewildered, having discovered what seemed to be as far away as possible from what he’d initially envisioned any member of Sherlock’s family to look like. A short woman, dressed in bright and warm colors, appearing to be in her seventies stood in front of them with a big smile on her face.
“Oh, uh, I think he… left somewhere after, you know.”, John said, squirming in his seat, feeling slightly uncomfortable with the kiss being brought up again.
“It doesn’t have to.”
Listening to Sherlock’s parents possibly make assumptions that John wished were true was one thing, but actually playing along? That would be too much involvement. Even though he technically wouldn’t be lying about anything if he did answer the question, John knew that he’d also confirm the assumptions, meaning there was no going back. He’d have to explain this to Sherlock. John felt the panic bubbling inside of him, and just like that, it didn’t matter if talking to Sherlock would make it all worse. He had to discuss this with him. Now.
The inside of the house gave off the same impression as the outside. Welcoming, warm, and now with the Christmas decorations - festive. John found himself admiring the interior and how normal everything seemed, wondering how it was possible for Sherlock to come from this. When he observed his friend though, it was clear that Sherlock felt at home here. The man seemed relaxed, and his pleased smile was a genuine one. Maybe Sherlock wasn’t so out of place, after all.
“No!”, Sherlock cut him off defensively. “Mummy
John could finally let out a sigh of relief. There. He’d said it. It was no going back now, but somehow there was something calming about that, how John had done his part. Now it was up to Sherlock to respond, but John could already tell by how his mouth curled into a smile, and the way his eyes were shining, that this was good. Very good. Sherlock’s smile kept growing larger until the man finally opened his mouth to say something.
“I thought I heard someone outside!” the woman exclaimed enthusiastically whilst practically pulling Sherlock inside by the collar of his coat to give him a tight hug. “We haven’t seen you in ages, Sherlock. I keep telling you, you really should come around more often!”
At precisely 8:16 AM Sherlock hears
Sherlock had already located an ugly blue chair standing in the corner if the room, right next to the sofa with all the boxes, and moved over there. As he was waiting, he listened to Watson opening cabinets in what he presumed was the bathroom. Seconds later the man was back in the sitting room.
Of course he had noticed something was wrong. Maybe it was the increased palm sweat, the fact that he’d bit his lip or how he was subtly squirming in his seat. Sherlock knew, and as John made eye contact with him, Sherlock lightly squeezed his hand.
“Stop laughing Greg, this is serious!”, a voice that definitely belongs to John shouts, even though he’s clearly trying his best to keep his voice down, and despite what he just said, dissolves into giggles the second he’s finished speaking.
“Yeah. Um, that was kind of the reason why I asked you to come. To talk about, you know, this.”
9:03 AM. Probably time to get up. With only about six hours of sleep, the thought of doing so was somewhat painful, but as soon as John remembered what was ahead of him, the mixture of excitement and anxiety was too much to keep him in bed. Filled with new energy, he began to untangle himself from Sherlock’s body that seemed to have attached itself permanently to John. It was during this that John felt the man move. The arm that previously had been holding on to John’s torso now made its way towards the detective’s face, slowly brushing the unruly curls out of his eyes. He sighed, and suddenly his entire body went stiff. Maybe he’d just had the same realization as John. That this was happening. John hoped he wasn’t too horrified.
John knew he was bisexual. He’d known it for a long time, and had over the years become rather comfortable with his sexuality. Something he was much less comfortable with, was knowing he found Sherlock attractive. Really attractive, in fact, and the assumptions about their relationship served as a constant reminder of how the things John fantasised about weren’t actually real. This, however, was a completely new situation. In the past, many people close to John had been living under the impression that John was indeed dating Sherlock, something John was had become very good correcting people at, but now it felt almost inappropriate to do so. So for the sake of not causing a scene two minutes after stepping into the house, John stayed quiet about the matter as he trotted on further into the house, following Sherlock and Mrs Holmes who’d begun to make their way up a staircase.
“So. We heard a… Actually, Sherlock, I’m not quite sure what we heard, but we did hear something.” John says and scratches his neck in distress.
“I’m sorry?”, Sherlock breathes, barely able to process what’s going on. They’re really doing this, aren’t they?. If John is trying to make him say what Sherlock think John is trying to make him say then this is… good?
“Um. I was… Er, well, I’m somewhat of a scientist.”, Sherlock begins. “And I was conducting an experiment. That exploded.”
Deduce him. Alright. It’s not like he’s done it before, but running over the facts again can’t do any harm - in case he’s wrong. In case he missed something.
“John, how is it? You’ve been terribly quiet the past couple of hours.”
Suddenly, an arm reached across John’s chest and over to the bedside table. A click was heard as the off-switch button on the lamp was pushed and the room went black. Sherlock turned his back to John with a “good night”. John repeated the phrase to his friend and turned around so that he was no longer facing Sherlock, maybe out of fear of getting too close. After all, the bed felt awfully small, and it seemed damn near impossible to lie in any position without somehow touching the other person.
As they moved inside, taking off their coats, another person appeared in the hallway. This time a man, about the same age as Mrs Holmes, with glasses hanging around his neck and an apron tied around his waist. John could only presume this was Mr Holmes, looking equally as commonplace as his wife - in a good way, of course. The fears of a nightmare holiday had at this point been blown out of the window. If Sherlock’s parents were anywhere near as nice as they looked, this weekend was probably going to be fine, if not even enjoyable.
John was nearly out of the room, just about to pass through the door frame, when the sound of his phone hitting the floor was heard as something collided straight into his body, nearly causing him to fall over. As John turned his head, he discovered the only person who was not in the room - Sherlock, who probably looked just as dizzy as John after the rather violent crash.
“I’m fine. Perfectly fine. Just a bit tired. Long day, you know.”
An hour went by. Two hours went by, and John had begun to accept that Sherlock wasn’t coming back in the near future. Since the man had left, John had closed himself off in an armchair with a glass of wine that had been finished a long time ago, leaving John to stare into the fireplace. He was quiet, probably quieter than usual, but he couldn’t help it. This evening just seemed to be getting worse. John glanced at his phone that was lying on the coffee table. Should he text Sherlock? His hand reached for the phone, unlocked it and clicked on “messages”. Apart from an actual Christmas text from Harry - nothing. John tapped on Sherlock’s name and began to type out a message.
He really was
“Maybe we’re really just that compatible” John teased with a grin.
Throughout the entire evening, Mrs Holmes’ presence had only been associated with good and positive things, but there was something different about this. Perhaps it was the seriousness in Mrs Holmes’ voice that made John more uneasy than he wanted to. They hadn’t exchanged a word between each other since the kiss, and John feared that it was that very thing she wanted to talk about.
“Hang on”, Greg says. “You were planning to break up with her? Why?”
“This? You mean…?” Sherlock said, doing some intricate hand movement between himself and John to imply what he was trying to say.
“It’s been fine. Interesting. Nice sharing the Christmas spirit, you know” John replied as nonchalantly as he possibly could.
And with that, it had been decided that John Watson and Sherlock Holmes were now in a relationship. Or at least a pretend one. John thought about it for a moment as he and the detective laid in silence. He probably should have asked what this would include. Touching? Hugging? Kissing? John opened his mouth to discuss this, but shut it again, realizing that, just as he’d said, he’d survived tonight, and regardless what was ahead of him, it surely couldn’t get worse.
Sherlock was quick to exit the cab, leaving John to pay as he listened to the snow crunching underneath Sherlock’s feet as he made his way up the path. Soon John could join him at the door that was decorated with a wreath. Both men stood in silence for a moment. John looked up at his taller friend and found the man smiling, making John unable to not beam back.
“I was.”, Sherlock said with a smile.
Is it wrong to hope that the man you’re in love with’s relationship doesn’t work out? Maybe it is, but Sherlock can’t possibly care less. After some hesitation, Sherlock presses his ear tightly against the floor again, and suddenly, like a gift from above, the conversation begins steering in a direction that could be in Sherlock’s favor.
Due to his blog, and the fact that John knew he probably wouldn’t be breathing today if it wasn’t for that day, John had no problem to recall the events of January 28th and 29th, 2010. It was like retelling what happened yesterday. When John had first walked through the lab doors a Bart’s and seen the ridiculously striking man, that for some absurd reason wanted to live with him?
Everything goes quiet for what feels like an eternity. Greg doesn’t say anything until John seems to get himself together.
“I’m curious. What makes you different?” Mr Holmes suddenly asked, sounding eager as ever, and John could feel his skin turn pale.
”I don’t know, this was your idea!” Sherlock hissed back, but when he saw the pleading expression on John’s face he softened. “Just act like you would with a real partn-“
“Nothing. Based on the way we’ve presented ourselves in the past, they’ve made the assumption that we’re dating, so clearly we’re already doing enough.”
“Hey, John. Um. I think we should…”, he begins, but pauses. Looking for the right words, seemingly in just as much agony as Sherlock.
With the arrival of Mrs Holmes, and soon also Mycroft, who, to John’s surprise had slept longer than anyone else, the act begun. Sweaty hand holding, awkward touching and calling each other “love” became only a few of the things endured over the day. It had all started out stiffly, the two men having no idea how to act this way with each other. John found himself in a constant internal battle between “
“Are you trying to say you’re sorry?”
“But I’m not gay.”, John says in what almost sounds like despair. Sherlock nods, pleased with himself. That confirms the latter theory.
It was a bit rude, John had to admit, but then Sherlock had no problem with being that, and apparently not his parents either, who seemed to have brushed off the comment as nothing.
Sherlock’s heart sinks. Why would he think John was single? Of course someone as amazing as John would have a partner. Of course.
“Of course not! But we have to do something. Amp up the romance somehow, I guess.”
“Git.”
In a haste, John simply turned his head towards Mrs Holmes as she spoke, never bothering to slow down his pace, feeling too desperate to get to Sherlock.
“Oh, well, yes, if it’s not too much of a trouble”, Sherlock says and holds John’s gaze for just a fraction of a second before switching his focus to the kitchen table. Anything to hide just the slightest tint of pink that may be appearing on his cheeks.
It was impossible that Mrs Hudson would be awake at this hour, and besides, Sherlock knew she’d never creep up on him like this. If it had been her, he would’ve heard her talking long before she’d entered the hallway. No, it must’ve been someone else, and that left Sherlock with only one candidate. Slowly, he turned towards the door on the first floor that had  “J. Watson” written on the label, and his theory was not to be proven wrong.
With that, Mrs Holmes wished him goodnight as John got up from the sofa and made his way out of the room, exiting through the very door frame which he had kissed Sherlock Holmes underneath earlier that night. John climbed the stairs up to the second floor, once again considering texting Sherlock. Was he even planning on coming back? No, that was stupid. Of course he would. Despite how much Sherlock seemed to dislike his family and silly Christmas celebrations, John had seen love in the man’s eyes as he was reunited with his family, and he knew that Sherlock wasn’t some sort of Christmas hating Grinch. He’d come back. Eventually.
“Well, I got suspicious the moment Mummy started treating the two of you like
”, as Mrs Holmes, who’d kept quiet since the collision, was heard.
“Come on, you must’ve noticed! They’re convinced we’re dating.”
With an annoyed huff at his friend, Sherlock Holmes made his way out of the building and slipped into the cab, going straight into what John immediately recognized as a sulk.
“You…
For the past couple of days, Mycroft had stayed out of John and Sherlock’s business, and John had known it was too good to be true from the very start. If there was anything Mycroft always did, it was to interfere, as if anything was his concern. Big brother’s watching you - quite literally in this case. Sticking their nose into everyone’s business really was a Holmes family trait. John glanced at Mycroft, who shot a knowing look in John’s direction. Of course he’d realized. John fought the temptation to let out a low growl of frustration. With only a couple of hours left in the house, surely there was no reason for Mycroft to deal with this right now. He’d turn up at Baker Street in a couple of days, make things a bit awkward, only to eventually be shooed away by Sherlock and a screeching violin solo.
Sherlock is proud of the shaky “Hello”, that he manages to squeeze out.
With only a few minutes left until the train reached Waterloo Station, John’s phone buzzed.
“It’s Mary! Why is she calling me at this hour?”
, and these suspicions were confirmed the first night. Mistletoe and all. Since I know for a fact that my brother and you aren’t romantically involved, realising Sherlock was up to something was child’s play”
“No.” Sherlock answered quickly. “We can’t.”
A muffled “
The bedroom door slowly swung open and revealed a dark figure that John would recognize anywhere by its height and large mop of hair. The figure did a surprisingly good job at silently shutting the door again, clearly not having noticed that John was awake. He rummaged through his coat that smelled strongly of damp wool and pulled out his phone, using the illuminated screen as a soft light to guide him through the pitch black room. John reached for the lamp switch on the bedside table.
There was something about how fast, almost too fast, Sherlock answered. The way he rapidly turned his head towards John, and the desperate look in his eyes. It was strange. This man never tiptoed around anything, and never missed an opportunity to correct someone who was wrong. So what was different now?
“Perhaps for this very reason.” Sherlock chimed in. “We don’t need you interrogating him at every given possibility”
About twenty minutes later, Sherlock, wearing his navy blue shirt, and John found themselves at the kitchen table with a massive breakfast prepared by Mrs Holmes in front of them.
Greg squints at him, and Sherlock can almost hear the “What the
“Shall we?” Sherlock asked, and lifted a finger to ring the doorbell.
It probably takes a solid minute before either of them actually decides to let go, and even if the embrace is over, John doesn’t entirely let go, letting his hand rest comfortably on Sherlock’s shoulder. As a matter of fact, it feels natural, as if this is how it’s supposed to be, and Sherlock finds himself leaning into the touch. It’s outright preposterous to think that this seemingly disastrous night would lead up to this, and Sherlock can admit that with this beginning, who knows how it’ll progress in the future. Something he does know though, is that whatever the future holds for him, he’s not afraid of it anymore.
“Sorry mate, it’s just… I don’t know. But hey, even if you’re right, it’s not the end of the world.”
Before John had the time to question Sherlock about whether or not it was a common occurrence that Sherlock timed how long he spent in the shower, Sherlock pulled out his phone which he began to type away furiously at, clearly not wanting to be disturbed any longer. The two men grew quiet, and as the cab began driving towards Waterloo Station, John was confident in the fact that the following train ride would give him plenty of time to overthink the situation, despite Sherlock’s assurances.
A med student? Nothing new. Watson turned out to be just as predictable as Sherlock had anticipated, and as if that wasn’t enough, the numerous beer cans and takeaway leftovers on the coffee table that Sherlock spotted when he peered into the flat hinted that people had been over recently, confirming that Watson indeed was quite a social guy. Sherlock smirked. A social med student then, just as he thought, which really meant that the invitation to come inside wasn’t that surprising at all. So with that, Sherlock limped into the flat.
John saw flashbacks from the past couple of days. Holding Sherlock’s hand, staring into his eyes for a long, long time, absently caressing his leg under a table - all of that. All of those things that were supposed to end now that the act was over. But they weren’t going to. Idiots, that’s what they were.
As silently as Sherlock possibly could manage, he began climbing the stairs, avoiding all steps that he knew would make a noise, but despite his efforts, a high pitched creak was heard, causing Sherlock to jump in surprise. That was odd. He
Sherlock had provided a perfect segway into the topic they were really here to discuss. John swallowed. All or nothing.
“I don’t… I’m not good at this, John. You know I can deduce that you’ve been walking through Hyde Park on your way back home based on the dirt on your shoes and the vegetation on your jacket and, but this? I can’t. Not with you.”
And with that, John was out of the room before Sherlock had time to object.
And like that John was reminded of why he was here in the first place. The whole purpose of the walk. As discreetly as he possibly could, John peered up at his friend, who was busying himself with making sure the scarf looked good, and wondered if he had any idea. The easiest way to find out would be to ask. Actually, no. It was possibly the hardest way, but here he was. About to do it. Somehow.
“Are you sure? It’s just - and please tell me if I’m being intrusive now - but I can’t help but worry about how things are between you and Sherlock. You both seemed so… stiff earlier. Are you sure everything is okay?” she asked.
As Sherlock began to reach the end of his string of deductions, he could see how John was dying to say something. His mouth was slightly opened and his eyes were way more focused on Sherlock than the actual wound that he was supposed to be taking care of. However, John never got the time to say whatever he’d been planning on saying, because right as Sherlock wrapped up his long monologue, a sharp pain shot through his entire body as John’s cold fingers touched a way too sensible bruise, causing an immense and pulsating ache that made Sherlock groan in anguish.
“I overheard you”, Sherlock says, refusing to look at Greg and John. “I was awake doing my little experiment and I heard you talking through the floor.”
“I’m sorry, what?”, Sherlock said, and was for a second left completely clueless to what was going on before he realized that he had, in fact, been staring. Great. As Sherlock was pulled back into reality, he also came to the unpleasant realization that this whole meeting was definitely going to make him, whose cheeks were now burning with embarrassment, come off as even more of a weirdo.
“So, do we tell them anything? I mean, your parents?”
“Mm, yes. I think Mummy’s quite right” the sly voice of Mycroft Holmes uttered from across the table. “It’s such a joy that my brother has managed to find himself in such an... affirming relationship.”
John found himself unable to go to sleep, only drifting in and out of it for hours in a bed that seemed to get more and more uncomfortable for every toss and turn he made. Outside, the wind was whistling. A snow storm was apparently coming, which John had found out at 1:29 AM when he’d checked his phone, wondering how long the wind was supposed to be roaring like this. Ever since John had begun his very much failed attempt at going to sleep, he’d been unable to stop thinking about the events of this evening. Whenever John could feel sleep creeping near, the mental images of the kiss kept coming back, sending a shiver down his spine.
