“I think Gregson suspected, but she dropped it pretty quick. I think she figured out the gist of it and decided to leave it alone. It definitely saved that family a hell of a lot of trouble. That was the moment I finally saw it. What Gregson had seen in him from the beginning. That little spark of goodness in him. Lord knows he didn’t show it often but every now and then if you just knew where to look you’d see it. After that I started seeing things like that more often, little signs he was a better man than he made himself out to be. After that I started trusting him more and when Gregson left and I got promoted I continued letting him in on cases. Christ knows it was helping our department out a hell of a lot.”
“No. No, you’re right. I would have done exactly what you had. Or at least, I think I would. I suppose I hope I would. I don’t know if I would have… handled it quite as well as you did but yeah, I’d try.” He let’s out a pained breath. “I may be a bloody hypocrite but still. In the future just, try to remember you have me to rely on, okay?”
“You look lovely.” John found himself blurting, accidentally cutting her off as she went on about the desserts. She looked up at him, startled, and he was gratified to see a bright smattering of pink dusting her cheeks.
On Monday he goes downstairs and see’s Mrs. Hudson. She’s overjoyed of course and clucks on and on about whatever she can think of while she bustles around her small tidy kitchen to make tea and gather some biscuits and cake she baked the other day.
“Your git of a brother is sending someone to get that thing out of here.” He gestures towards the ornate display of flowers as if it is some grotesque deformity. “You okay?” His face which had been set in a venomous frown just moments ago was now smoothed out and gentle as he regarded Sherlock. Sherlock nearly felt himself blush at the sudden attentiveness.
John shot up in his bed, his breath was ragged and he had a cold sweat covering his body. His whole body was shaky with residual fear from his most recent nightmare.
As their lips are pressed together and they are giggling in each others arms Sherlock feels all the residual pain from the hospital and his injuries float way and all that’s left is them. The pain will eventually return and theres still so much they need to say and do but in this moment all that matters is that they’re there and they’re together.
“Hi.” Her voice is soft and almost gets swallowed up by the wind. John forges ahead and unlocks the door, holding it open as Mindy steps in after him and he follows her up the stairs. Once they get in to 221B and it’s just the two of them. John starts to feel nervous. He’s never fucked up with somebody in such an insulting and well… creepy way. He doesn't even know where to begin his apology.
He’d listen to the gentle, rhythmic slapping of skin echoing through the room and feel his own skin tingle with sensation.
He turned back to look at her and when he saw the hopeful yet motivated look in her eyes he couldn’t help but play along.
The subway carriage rocked and trembled as it raced along its track and in the back of his mind John appreciated the trembling machinery as it worked well to hide the constant tremor in his left hand. That said, he still clenched it tightly, attempting to squeeze out the shakiness though knowing it would never work. The soldier let an irritated sigh go and he ran his right non-shaky hand through his hair trying to calm down a bit.
He feels saturated in his own disgust. He doesn't know when his mind got so twisted and corrupt but he can’t deny he isn’t the same man anymore.
“I’ll bet, sicko.” Andersons voice was still shaky, though Sherlock was surprised he would bother speaking at all. Not that anyone paid much attention to the statement however. Moriarty acted as if he hadn’t heard it at all, focusing all this attention on Sherlock now. John had been the only one not to say anything this time, and that filled Sherlock with a whole new kind of fear. What could be going through the army soldiers mind? Was he angry? Disappointed? Disgusted? And did he feel that way towards Moriarty or Sherlock himself? He wouldn’t be surprised if John hated him when this was all said and done. He was about to sleep with the enemy, so-to-speak, and he was the reason John and everyone were here in the first place. This was really his fault in the end. He shouldn’t have underestimated Moriarty’s obsession with him. He should have seen this coming.
“Look John, I know you haven’t been yourself since…” She goes quiet, clearly not quite knowing how to phrase it. John is too busy floundering himself to help her out. “I know that.” She repeats decisively. “I’ve been trying to make this as easy as possible on you because I care about you, John. I really do. But I can’t do this. I can’t hire you and deal with your flippancy about office hours again. I thought…” She hesitates, not seeming sure if she should continue but Sarah has never been anything other than brutally honest. It’s one of the things John has always respected about her and he can’t bring himself to resent it now. “I thought that now with Sherlock gone you would be a better employee. I figured he was the thing distracting you from coming in. But if you’re going to make a habit of being a no-show, let me know now so I can find someone else for your job.” Johns stomach sinks. He feels nauseas and tired and he still has that bloody headache. Everything seems like its moving so fast and John can barely keep up but he has to do
of all times. Now John would feel even more awkward when he eventually had to break the news of his impending move to Sherlock.
“Sherlock. Stop.” Sherlock did stop then and stared at his lap in shame, waiting for the final hammer to drop.
The day itself goes relatively smoothly. No patients die or barf on him, so John considers himself lucky. It goes smoothly but slowly. Each hour seems to last triple the time and by the time his shift is over he feels as if the day might as well have been a week.
“We’ll keep that in mind though we would prefer for you to stay hospitalized during the first couple weeks of recovery. It will help us monitor your vitals and caloric intake more easily along with seeing how well your body heals.” Dr. Richards looked down at his chart and flipped through the pages casually. “As for the actual extent of your injuries, you were quite lucky. You’re friends managed to get you here within less then three hours of the burns taking place which helped prevent further scarring or tissue damage, none of your cuts or nails have gotten infected yet, though there’s still plenty of time for that so we’ll need to keep an eye on it. The surgery to excise the necrotic tissue near your burns went smoothly as well. I expect that if we continue to treat your wounds carefully and you don’t push yourself to hard the recovery process will go very well.”
John doesn’t know. Not yet. But he will. He will because he never wants to feel like this again. He never wants to see someones face drop like Mindy’s had earlier and know that it’s because of
He got a surprising number of visitors. Greg came back the next day with Anderson and Donovan which had proved to be
“Hey… Is everything alright?” He looked back up and took his head out of his arse to find Mindy staring at him, her large doe-like eyes filled with concern.
When John had went to begin tidying up he was shocked by the amount of filth that had somehow built up inside 221B. He knew that he had let things slide a bit but he had no idea how bad it had really gotten. It had taken him two hours just to clean the kitchen and living room and another two to tackle the bathroom and his room. All in all it had taken him four hours (give or take a tad) to get the flat looking the least bit presentable again.
“That… was lovely! Gosh you really went for that, I can’t wait to see how you do with this next one!”
“Ghh, Sherlock-!” The mouth around him pauses for a moment but he hardly notices, feeling completely drunk and tired and content. He does notice when the heat leaves him however, and the sudden blast of cold on his groin startles him out of his sleepy descent into unconsciousness. He looks down and sees Mindy standing up in front of him, looking out of place and deeply uncomfortable. John does some quick thinking and comes to the conclusion that she must be waiting for some form of reciprocation. He did finish embarrassingly fast after all.
John looked over at the closed bedroom door and felt his hand itch to open it. He stopped himself. He didn’t deserve to go take refuge in Sherlock’s bedroom. Not after treating his memory like some kind of sexual fantasy. He gathered all the will power he could muster and straightened his spine in an unconscious soldiers rest and turned sharply away, marching stiffly up to his bedroom.
Not wanting to waste anymore time delaying the inevitable he closed off the remaining space between himself and the cock standing at full attention in front of him and placed his lips around the crown, carefully suckling. He gagged slightly as the strong taste of pre-come, musk, and sweat filled his mouth. The gooey texture and silky feel of foreskin under his tongue was disgusting enough. Jim didn’t bother telling him not to bite. They both knew who had the upper hand here and as long as John and the others were held under those four red dots Sherlock wouldn’t do anything risky. That didn’t make the action any less tempting however.
“I’ll give you mine too. Here,” he handed her his phone and she dug in her purse briefly before finding and unlocking her own. It was in a bright pink case and his heart gave a violent twinge when he thought of the last bright pink case he had seen way back when him and Sherlock had met for the very first time. The string of serial suicides (or rather homicides) that Sherlock had almost been a victim of.
"Sherlock," he started, more than a little unsure what to say, "what exactly are you trying to tell me?"
"He's also allowing a temporary reprieve, due to the pregnancy," he continues carefully, when John makes it apparent that he is not going to say anything. "Mary will remain in protective custody until the baby is born." It's protection for Sherlock and John- not for her. "At that point, you will be given full custody, pending the successful completion of her mission. Beyond that, Mary appears most focused on retaining her freedom before anything else."
He goes to Regent's Park, sometimes. He claims to John it's reconnaissance for a case, boring, dull, something John wouldn't be interested in. It's a transparent lie: he
All John is wearing is the dreadful dressing gown. He looks at Sherlock, cupping the side of his neck in the way that he does, making sure he is really there, now, really awake. When he finds what he is looking for, he slides closer to kiss him.
Sherlock said. So how many people had known? How many people had known some of or exactly what was going on, and said nothing? The only person to try and help him had been someone who'd needed help just as badly and never gotten it.
why isn't he waking up. "Sherlock?" He touches his face, the red scrape at being thrown to the floor, but it's only that, a scrape. His wild hair isn't hiding anything, either; he's not finding any lumps or bruises that could answer where he's gone. "Sherlock,
The ice breaks, and the hand around his fingers squeezes. "Good. Eat something." He kisses his hair, then backtracks before Sherlock is able to worm himself upright enough to kiss him back.
with the great Sherlock Holmes? John had hit him. John had beaten him and told him it was his fault. John had been ready to leave him in that hospital for good and if that was the case, why the hell was he here now? Why was he
"I thought that it might perhaps be... cruel. To call you here, when there were still so many hours left to go, and to give you that hope. Not when there was no guarantee that he was going to survive."
He could tell John meant it, though, and in any case, he was right about Rosie. Of course. John of a few years ago would've blown it off, because Rosie was too young to remember, what was the harm of one night with a sitter-- but that was John of a few years ago, and this was John now, and they weren't the same. Sherlock didn't want them to be the same.
The look on Sherlock's face cleared, and he swung back around to face the outside world with nothing more than a billow of his coat.
A big part of him now wanted to tell Sherlock to call the date off. A little bit of nerves was okay, but here Sherlock was a full two hours early, dressed to the nines, unable to sit still, and so anxious he thought he was going to throw up.
"Yes, well." He again tugged on his collar, pulling it even closer around his throat. "My appearance is very important to me."
If Sherlock'd seen him with context removed, he would've deduced that John was the father of a newborn. Then he would've noticed the lack of a wedding ring on his finger, and- and he's not sure what he'd have thought after that.
That's what it is, he realises, and it hits like a punch to the gut. He's never seen Sherlock afraid for himself before, but he
"Nope!" John proclaims, all smiles, and settles himself down on the edge of the new bed. It's marginally better than the old one. It's also still a travesty. "Mycroft's security also isn't going home until you do, so. Get used to them. And speaking of Mycroft." He fumbles in his jacket, which had been suspiciously bulky the entire evening, and at last holds out his hand with his offering in tow. "Mycroft asked me to give this to you. I think he hopes if he keeps you occupied, you won't make a run for it. Again."
He slumps even deeper into his chair, trying to pull off an annoyed, unbothered sulk, but underneath it all he is only unsettled. He hasn't seen Mycroft this angry in years. And for what? A temporary relapse? One experimental hit, just to see what happens?
"Look, John," he started, looking at him in very transparent worry. "If you think Sherlock isn't well enough for this, you just need to say so. I can live without his help, if that's--"
He shivers, not because of the cold but something deeper, more primal, and he pulls even deeper into his blanket.
he was always amazing, his conductor of light, and now Sherlock was supposed to respond properly back. But what was the next move? What was he supposed to say or do?
He keeps his fingernails cut obsessively short, so he can not scratch himself. He tries to keep a cigarette in hand, so he can't bite his lips or the inside of his cheek. He participates in John's little daily conversations of the mundane and the boring. And John notices all the efforts he's making. John, for some reason, feels the need on the regular to tell him
John pours himself a cup of tea, and this time, doesn't bother to pour a second. If Sherlock gives some indication that he wants one, he'll make it, but every cup he's given that bleary-eyed blanket burrito over the past few days has been left almost entirely untouched. He sits down at the kitchen table instead, his back turned firmly to the rest of the room.
There was definitely a reason that Sherlock had first refused to take this case. And it was the same reason he had refused to come with John today, and it was the same reason he had now been so quiet and out of sorts for days.
However, there is another reason that they frequent Angelo's, and it is also the reason that they are here tonight: the location is
Nobody who has had any hand in putting Sherlock where he is now is going to live all that much longer.
"And even if she wasn't," Sherlock snapped, "because it somehow seems to have escaped your impeccable powers of observation despite it being so obvious that even
He swallows hard, glaring down at the two files. He wishes Mycroft would close them. "So it's finished, then? They're all dead. The case is over."
"Okay. Mycroft is finding your location, and then one of us is going to come pick you up. I'll stay on the line with you until then. You're going to keep talking to me, and not hang up until we get there."
Then John catches one of his hands, tugging it down to the table between them, and looks at him with eyes so earnest and sincere it makes Sherlock want to run away.
He's tired of the fact that he can compose all night long, but his brain still short-circuits and his fingers freeze solid the moment he tries to pick up his violin.
Sherlock had been extraordinarily disappointed when, after lingering for himself in the dark sitting room for well over half an hour, over the moon with his own cleverness and positively
and John couldn't have loved him more. He doesn't look at John but stares at his brother, and his musician's hands flutter, moving through motions too fast for John to ever have a hope of keeping up.
this was going nowhere. He tried to sift through the words as best he could, to try and keep Sherlock's privacy while at the same time get an answer. Because he knew he could trust Greg, but he still didn't know what
There are two men in suits on the street, standing silently just outside the door to the flat. On the kerb idles the long, black car that is symptomatic of a spontaneous appearance of Mycroft Holmes, and both men have the unmistakeable appearance of being his government agents.
loud groan. He creaked to his feet audibly enough that John could hear him all the way from the sitting room, and he looked up from his laptop just in time to see Sherlock stagger, step by step, into the space of his door. He was draped still in a blanket and an untucked blue shirt, and looked like he wanted to fall flat on his face.
It's never mattered. Whatever mental block there is that stops him from speaking while awake, it's still there in his head when he's asleep.
And a BIG, BIG THANK YOU to YAJJ/paybackraid for helping me to proofread and edit this monster (for a show she hasn't even watched!) Woo!
"And the only reason he was in that hospital bed in the first place is because of me. I put him there. I hit... I
They slate him down for head scans and neurology interviews next, scans to be evaluated by an increasingly overqualified panel of neurologists. John, if anyone's asking, is of the opinion that the head scans should've been the first step. It's not only spoken word. Sherlock can't
He's seen John after twelve hours at the surgery, and he's sat with John on all-night stakeouts. He's seen John after nightmares, the flu, and being kidnapped and held at gunpoint.
John smiled again, his hand tugging on his hair, this time to nudge Sherlock's head to lean against his shoulder. It wasn't quite as nice, but it
They were through the worst of it. Tonight was the lowest point, and they would survive this. Sherlock was going to be okay, and John was going to be there with him, and they'd see it through to the other side.
Sherlock pockets the cigarettes for later, and saunters off around the corner, Lestrade's wallet and police badge now in hand.
He finds his voice again. But as he is slowly beginning to understand, that is not the same thing as finding his words.
"You were married. The biggest and most important day of your life, you said. That life was... supposed to be what you wanted."
"I was drunk. I was--" Sherlock pulled back just enough to look up at him but still clung to him, his long fingers suddenly digging into his back, grasping him close as a lifeline. "I was drunk, you heard me, I had no idea what I was--"
"You... oh." A lump settled in John's stomach, and he swallowed again. His fury turned inward, just like that, anger into understanding, and misery along with it.
Sherlock's face twitched into a sardonic smile. "As it should, Doctor." He held up one hand, flat, turning it this way and that, and accepted his tea with the other. "See? Perfectly steady."
They get to A&E. Mycroft is, most curiously, not present. John tells him that he'd threatened to snog the living daylights out of Sherlock for the entire drive if Mycroft had insisted upon staying, which is easily the most romantic thing he's said all day. He's diagnosed with a bad sprain and given a hateful walking boot, to which John promises to make it worth his while if he leaves it on and agrees to call for Chinese on the way home.
This wasn't right. How could this be right? How could Sherlock just sit there and look up at him like that and be so
because it's to the point where not even Sherlock is selfish enough to escape the fact that sitting here day after day, staring the bullet wound right in the face, is absolutely killing him.
"Yeah, well, sorry, I guess I tend to get a little absentminded after being pistol whipped." He rubbed his face again with a long, jaw-cracking yawn. "Sarah's all right, at least. Thanks for... turning up. Helping us out."
But it's also the most fond, the look of resignation on his face that is exquisitely familiar, and Sherlock beams.
"Just as sociable as before, I see." The professor lowered his hand, again looking Sherlock up and down, and this time even flicking his eyes to John for good measure. "So you're here on that little detective thing that you do, then? I've seen you in the news about that. It's very... quaint." He paused, observing the both of them with a very uppity, public school air. "I'm glad that you found something you were good at."
"Approximately the quantity of the Thames." He sank gratefully into the proffered chair, his head dropped back into his hands. "Three, before I left the restaurant. After that-- file not found. I think it got dropped over a banister."
"John Watson," he pants, "we're looking for John Watson-- Sherlock, lad, I told you to wait for me, come on--"
His stomach goes hollow and empty. It feels like he's imploding from the inside out, a crushing emptiness opened inside him that just
at John. The way he's looking at John right now, his inquisitive eyes narrowing and a shroud fallen across his white face. The urgent terror from before has faded, as has the fury at not being understood, and the rage at whatever mouth-breathing idiot had hit John on the head. He stares at John instead, with eyes that are too intelligent to escape from, and a gaze that sees too much to ever hide from.
, synapses that remember and dendrites that branched that not even he or Mycroft can delete at a whim.
the man start to smile. "You're welcome for that, by the way. He wasn't very good, with me. I had to teach--"
"No, no. Of course not," she murmured, hardly paying him any mind. "But Sherlock is a very... unique person, isn't he? Unique name, unique face. And that personality-- well. Let's just say he got a lot of attention, even back then. But that's enough of that, isn't it?" She smiled back at him, just as strained and professional as John. "What was it you wanted to ask me?"
Older than Victor. Almost certainly a young professor, someone older and put together and competent, someone who
"So... what, then? You think I should--" His stomach knots, and can barely get the words out past the anger gathering in his throat. "--should,
"Sherlock," he repeats gently. He settles down with him, resting his hands on his sharp, bony knees.
He'd never met this one. He wasn't sure John had ever so much as told him the new one's name. So he pictured Jeanette, instead. He pictured the boring teacher, with her polite mannerisms and inoffensive smiles, the way she told jokes that didn't make the room go dead silent and had never once made anyone at that get-together cry. He pictured John going with her to the movies, to watch something boring and dull and mind-numbing, with a shared mundane popcorn in his lap and his arm worked carefully around her small shoulders. It was dull, dull,
Sherlock shoots him an exasperated look, eviscerating him inside and out with nothing more than the force of his brilliant eyes. His expression is absolutely and totally
Which is horrible for John, yes, but the part that really worries him, is how horrible it must be for Sherlock.
He pulled back to press his face against John's hair, his frown deepening severely. "Nobody asked him."
Mycroft's mouth twitched, a quiet look of increasing disgust slipping across his features. "Yes. For some time. Not that Sherlock recognised it as inappropriate. He felt...
It felt like a decade long hiatus and break in conversation, and only now was John finally surfacing on the other side.
"I shouted at him to get a girlfriend," he finished, scratching his jeans into his fist. "Then we went out and got cake and I went home, and I haven't seen him since."
But he stands there in the door, his fingers digging into the cup and biting hard into the inside of his cheek, and can't name what trouble Sherlock could've possibly gotten into.
John sat back in his seat, and rubbed hopelessly at the growing knot of worry, settled right there in the center of his chest.
John is able to tell immediately he is not waking up. He's not ready to yet, and the drugs they have him on reflect that fact. He shifts in bed, his face settling into a pained, worried grimace, and hands twitch, but he is not awake. A nightmare, then.
But it is all in his own hand, beginning to end, a story of blue ink, cramping hands, and John's loose, warm arm nudging against his foot. It is
Sherlock's throat jumps as he swallows, his eyes again darting from John to over his shoulder and back again. He blinks hard and shakes his head, like he's having trouble focusing, and stares at John with eyes that are flickering too fast. He's trying to deduce and it's not working. Or it is, but he's too drugged and hurt to make any sense out of the storm of details that his overactive brain latches around and won't let go.
that you're always fussing over? Always ordering me all about the city, calling me home from across the country to water the damn thing?"
John is angry at him. It is everything that Sherlock has wanted to prevent, and it is everything that he has always been powerless to stop. John has tried, so very hard, to be patient. He has taken care of Sherlock for months, and months, and
They sat quietly for long enough. Minutes on end, Sherlock just folded around John, all long legs and arms, and this time John let him because he knew Sherlock needed it more than he'd ever care about the healing pain in his sides. "We'll figure this out," he whispered, the words lost into the hair buried against his neck. "I promise, Sherlock. I
"Get him to drink as much water as you can. If he loses consciousness and you can't wake him up, or has any trouble breathing, any at all, you take him straight to an A&E." John shouldered his jacket back on, yanking the zipper to his chin with a clenched, furious fist. "And you will not get angry with him, do you understand me?"
"Right," Lestrade coughed again, clearing his throat. Sherlock wondered idly if he ought to offer a cough drop. "This is enough for now, I think. You'll need to sign your statements, both of you, but that can wait. Assuming this stays a Scotland Yard case, what with Sherlock over here trying to sell off classified information to a psychopath."
He decides very quickly that the best place for him to be is at the door to the old house, so if Sherlock tries to follow an evidence trail right outside, John will be there to catch him. Unless he tries to skip out the window instead, stiff back and quivering legs be dammed. John doesn't put it past him. But no matter what Sherlock's plans are, John clearly is of no help, just watching him silently deduce things and keeping it all stuffed into his own head.
His legs propel him out of sight before he can even start to open his mouth, and his heart is pounding so hard he can hear it throb in his ears. His throat hurts and he suddenly can't help but to scratch it, his fingernails tearing lines down it so deeply they want to bleed.
"I know," Sherlock said, without missing a beat. He sipped his tea again, watching over the rim. "It's transparent."
Sherlock turned up here, on heroin himself. Heroin. Which, to Greg's knowledge, he had never used before.
and Sherlock is- relearning to walk. A text conversation debating the potential veracity of one of Mary's claims is interrupted by the brisk striding in of a team of nurses, there to cart him off for yet another scan. He's trying not to gag on mushy steamed peas and demanding to be weaned off IV painkillers while the world moves on, and there is precisely nothing he can do to stop it.
Sherlock, who was watching him now, his jaw clenched tight, and his face as smooth and unreadable as stone.
"Did you know that Victor Trevor isn't Dr. Wilson's only former student to have such a long fall from grace? Or the only one to drop out of school?"
He could tell Sherlock liked kissing, at least. He could feel it in how he moved under his hands, and the sounds he made, and the way he kissed back that he liked it. He wasn't just reciprocating because it was what he thought John wanted. This was something that made Sherlock happy.
. "I was hoping an additional voice of reason might perhaps be able to sway Sherlock. Surely you'll at least do me the favor of listening, John-- you know how he tends to the dramatic."
John inhales sharply, his fist white-knuckled and his spine coiled. There's a storm on his face and in his eyes, and for a moment Sherlock is terrified he's going to cry.
Sherlock's breaths continue to be hard-fought and desperate, each one torn from deep, deep in his chest. His wild hair spills over his eyes and stands up on end, and he wrenches a hand upwards to yank his nails through it, pushing it back and out of the way.
Sherlock heads out of the office, his hands buried deep into his pockets and his face tucked into his scarf. On impulse alone, he bins the scrap of paper meant for the cabbie, on which he had already written
It took a moment longer still, but then Sherlock breathed in, and with it, a flicker of light filled back into his eyes. Once again, John's touch on his arm was all that it took to breathe life back into him, and once again, it came as simply and easily as a flicker of light in his eyes. He blinked once, gaze flickering up and down John and then away again, lightning quick, and the line of his mouth flattened.
John doesn't want to do anything at all but wrap him up in his arms and tell him it's all going to be okay.
John takes in a breath, and carefully, very carefully, wraps his arm around Sherlock without asking him anything more.
Sherlock inhaled again, still tasting the very faintest scent of ash and sweat and chlorinated pool water. He swallowed, testing out the unfamiliarity and uncertainty of a smile of his own.
"I'm going to require many cups of tea, when I come home," Sherlock says, because the point needs some slight editing, to make it palatable for John. "And much pampering. I won't be satisfied if you just keel over."
Sherlock tried to swallow again, to force the wave down, but feeling his throat move against Oscar's mouth made him feel even worse.
Lucky sniffs dolefully at her owner, tail drooping. She looks up at Sherlock, and he allows her to lick his face one final time before rising to his feet, and accepting his medicine.
"My recollection from last night has several holes. As you know. I know that I called Mycroft, but after that--" he swallowed audibly, and when John turned back around it was to find him holding his water glass in a white-knuckled grip. "I would very much appreciate a full explanation because-- I surmise that I might have imagined or dreamed several sequences of events, and it would... I would just like to be sure I'm operating on a complete and accurate data set before we proceed."
He gains weight, much to John's approval, and the last of the IVs come out. He's steadier on his feet, and the doctors stop talking about infection and his next scan and start talking instead about how he'll manage at home. Acute pain management turns into discussions about chronic pain management instead.
He hated them. He'd hated them before and he hated every single staff member at that school now. He hated the ones who'd blown Sherlock off, he hated the ones who must've felt something was off but ignored it, and he hated the ones who'd believed Oscar over him.
I'll take a look downstairs. But if I don't find anything I'm dropping your theory and going with mine, okay?"
There was nothing quite like a night with takeaway, tea, and a case at Baker Street, no. But this was a close enough second best.
John stage-whispers, squeezing his arm around Sherlock's side. His smile is bright and brilliant in the dark. "Can we ever have a normal date, do you think? One that doesn't end in us getting thrown out of a restaurant or having to call the police?"
don't do that, it's okay. You're okay. Just take another deep breath, all right? Deep breath, come on, love, with me. Sweetheart.
If he were Sherlock, he'd probably have deduced everything that was going on, right then and there, and in that one instant of looking at the scene. If he was anybody else other than himself, he'd have taken just a few moments to observe what was going on, and figured it out, and defused the situation as best he could.
Mrs. Hudson, crying on John's shoulder, murmuring about finding Sherlock asleep on the floor in his own vomit; Sherlock, still barely more than skin and bones, moving stiffly, sorely, sleeping more, because he was a bloody human being and he could only put his body through the wringer so many times before it started to give up on him.
Sherlock. Please believe me. I was scared and felt like I was failing you and didn't know what to do but I wanted someone else to fix it for me. I'm still scared because I don't know what to do to help you. But I know it's not this, Sherlock." He squeezes his eyes shut, feels the trembling of Sherlock's back beneath him and the wretched whines of breath. "I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Please believe me."
“Yeah, would do if he wasn’t ignoring my calls.” John felt a sick sort of glee that at least he wasn’t the only one being ignored. “John, do you have any idea how worried I’ve been? I’ve been expecting some ruddy fucking stranger to call the Yard and report a gunshot in Baker Street or a blonde army doctor floating in the Thames.” John felt guilty. He’d be lying if he said Greg was over-exaggerating. John had been spending an awful lot of quality time with his Browning as of late and he knew the DI’s concern wasn’t unfounded.
“Oh, uh, sorry mate.” John apologized, backing away from the man and no doubt looking as embarrassed as he felt. “I thought you were someone else.” Not-Sherlock may have replied and he may have not. John wouldn’t have noticed either way. He was too busy racing back to his seat and berating himself. What was wrong with him? How on Earth could he actually go up to someone like that? He probably looked like some drunken idiot. John is suddenly hyper aware of how much he’s had to drink. Maybe that fourth glass of whisky wasn’t a good idea.
“Next round!” Moriarty exclaimed cheerily. He snapped his fingers again and one of his thugs handed him… a small cooking torch. “Now this time I’ll play nice and give you five minutes. I do believe the objective of this round is rather self-explanatory.”
“He always did have his moments.” John thought back to all the strange little things Sherlock had always done that seemed to show he cared. “He was never the type of person that expected to be liked and acted like a complete arse because of it. Only people that really knew him ever saw what he was really like. He was one hell of a secretive bloke.” He pauses a minute and wets his throat with his refilled glass thinking back on how little he really knew about Sherlock.
Thank you for reading! If you got to the end and enjoyed please feel extremely free to leave a comment or kudos. I love to see how my writing is being received so feedback is like gold to me.
He remembered that night so well. Sherlock had of course been in another one of his strops and had stolen John’s gun from where the ex-army doctor had hidden it in his bedside table. John could still remember how his heart had raced in panic when he heard the gunshots. Memories of his time in Afghanistan had mingled with the fear that someone was using those bullets on
“John…” She began. “I’m not here to get an apology. I’m here to give one.” With how horrible she looks John’s not surprised, after spending so much time in it’s company John knows what guilt induced misery looks like, and Mindy was a walking billboard for it.
“Oh relax Johnny Boy, I’m not going to hurt him.” Sherlock thought that was a bit disingenuous considering he was still gripping his hair so hard his teeth were grinding down on his gag.
“Please, stop! He’s had enough now! Let me take this one, please…” Sherlock felt a jolt of terror pierce through him at the thought of Greg having to go through this. There’s now way he was going to let that happen. Besides, he’s already gotten this far. After this round he only had one left, he would have no problem with that. Sure, he was dizzy and the burns on his body felt like they were on fire or someone was constantly branding his skin but all that’s only transport. This is a game of endurance and God help him if he doesn’t know how to endure. Without knowing it he let out a grunt of protest, his eyes flicking between Greg who was waiting for Moriarty’s answer and the consulting criminal himself who had a rather pensive expression on as if he were seriously considering Lestrade’s request. Sherlock desperately hoped he wasn’t.
The smile didn’t last long though as he remembered what else had happened that night. He’d stormed out, went to Sarah’s and slept on the lie-low while at the same time 221B had been bombed (well, not exactly, it was the flat across from them but it was obvious it was only to get Sherlock’s attention).
He waits for the ringing to stop and a few seconds after that his phone chimes letting him know he has a voicemail. He considers just deleting the voicemail without listening to it but in the end curiosity and pity get the better of him. He at least owes it to her to listen to her damn voicemail, besides it’s not like he has anything better to do.
He hadn’t realized quite how much he had missed Baker Street until he was finally standing back in it. It smelled of Mrs. Hudsons lilac detergent and chemicals and that soft earthy scent of
It had been three months and two days since what happened at Barts and John’s first time fully out of the flat. He hadn’t restarted his job at the clinic, it was still far too soon – it felt like it would always be too soon – but thankfully with the incident going around every headline in the country (and even a few out of the country) Sarah fully understood why and had only called him once to check in and let him know that his job was still waiting for him whenever he felt fit to return. He knew it was kind and thoughtful of her, but
“Are you sure? It’s fine if you’re not. We can always leave and try this again another time.” He felt so undeserving of her kindness. Here he was, sitting in front of her thinking of how it would never work between them and she was doing nothing but being sweet and comforting.
This was indeed a bit not good. What should he even do with it? Should he get off or just… wait it out? He felt like a teen boy discovering wanking for the first time. That familiar cocktail of shame and confusion and utter horniness.
“You could have just asked Mycroft. I’m sure he’s still keeping tabs on me.” At the mention of the elder Holmes brother John’s voice turns bitter and his mood goes sour. Mycroft hadn’t contacted him once since the week after Sherlock jumped. He hadn’t even attended the funeral. Bloody crummy older brother is right.
“No moving now,” he winked. “You wouldn’t want my snipers to get the wrong idea and get trigger happy now would you?” He slowly slipped his cold hands under the detective’s now ruined shirt and slid it down his arms with the careful attentiveness of a lover, making him shiver both from the chill and the disgust at how intimate the gesture felt. His disgust only seemed to delight the consulting criminal as he stepped back and gave Sherlock a long lecherous look.
“Anyhow,” Greg continues on, “He was using all the time then. The whole first year we knew each other I don't think I saw him sober
“Don’t go.” He sounds needy and desperate and he’s acting disgustingly clingy put he can’t help it. He’s in a hospital and his whole body is so sore, from both his injuries and his lack of movement. He needs John right now and right in this moment he doesn’t care if that makes him look needy.
They had known their time would be limited. So they had not wasted any. They had dedicated every waking moment, every
That DVD was not the first time that Sherlock had nearly died because Mary had made the decision that on the scale of all of their lives and happiness, Sherlock's was expendable.
Sherlock licks his lips uselessly. His hands stay limp at his sides, because even if he had the words to say, John would not hear them.
He couldn't ask that of him because he wouldn't make Sherlock happy. He knew he wouldn't. He'd been Sherlock's closest friend for nearly a decade, and look at where it had gotten them.
Polite enough, John thought. Certainly more pleased to see him than most of Sherlock's old associates tended to be.
Sherlock rolls onto his back and flings his arm over his head, glaring at the ceiling. Sickness still churns in his stomach and throat, but the despair has flagged, and with it the blinding rage that vibrates in his bones and fills him with the need to scream. It's all gone, and in it's place, he just feels... empty. Nothing.
Seconds ticked by. Sherlock sat there looked aggravated and aggrieved as ever, his jaw twitching and his finger twitching with it, and John just stared at him. A bomb might as well have gone off. In the flat, from Sherlock's mouth, inside John's own head.
A low, throaty whine. It's faint and leaky, and broken by little hiccups of breath, a voice that is desperately hoarse with disuse but still a voice. A voice. Sherlock's voice.
"Well. Yes." Sherlock tilts his head, watching the way John stands and shifts, trying to read his reaction. "People like Magnussen should be killed. That's what Mary said, in this very room."
Clearly, he was never going to manage to evict Milgram. Milgram was a curse and a plague unto this flat, cosmic retribution for the entire experiment being conceived of in the first place, and simply a new fact of life that he had to accept. John was here to stay- and so was Milgram.
The pen Sherlock had hurled in his fit of rage and fear is still on the floor. Lonely, discarded, and sad.
John watches him quietly, his eyes unreadable. They almost gleam in the monitor's glow, and in that eerie green backlight, he looks desperately unhealthy and sallow.
Sherlock glares back, his own irate fury rising like a tide in his stomach. He keeps his mouth shut and his hands still out of defiance alone. Mycroft knows the answer.
Sherlock knocked his fist on the doorframe again. Then he knocked it a third time. Just a slow, steady, rhythmic knocking, even though the door was already open and the person he apparently wanted to summon was right there looking at him.
hurts me. Okay? Do you understand that?" He threw caution out the fucking window and caught Sherlock's face in his hands, stroking his high cheekbones, his hair, the lines under his eyes. "I will
The bundle grumbled to himself, still curled. "I'm fine." He buried his head deeper into his pillow, earning another frown from John at his sides and the breaks underneath his pajamas. Pajamas again, rather than the dress shirt and trousers from before. "I'm fine. I feel sick."
"Oh. No-- no, they weren't, actually." Greg flips through his own notes, his brow furrowed. Sherlock all but vibrates with impatience, shifting back and forth in building frustration. "Nothing at all until the maid came in through here this morning, and realised the painting was missing."
"Sod the labels," he said. "Sod all of it. I don't care what you call it. It was a bloody awful marriage. Mary was in love with the idea of Mrs. Dr Mary Watson and what I could do for her more than she'd ever loved me. She only cared if I was happy so much as it affected her. And I knew I was married to someone who didn't actually care about
He knew what Sherlock was trying to say, and-- god, it made sense. He heard the story Sherlock was spelling out with Victor and as badly as he wanted this to work, he knew he couldn't go too far in the other direction. He couldn't be...
here. Someone that Sherlock wanted to impress, if he wanted to find a mentor here, and the chance to stay.
He swallows, his throat moving visibly, and his next words come out thick. "For a genius you're quite possibly the biggest idiot I've ever met but
John's phone buzzes in his pocket. He doesn't want to take his eyes off Sherlock, not even for a second, so it's not until the detective suddenly spins on him that he realises what he's missed.
Moriarty, there was a low intake of breath from across the room. John shifted in his chair, his voice low and tense, trying very hard to betray nothing.
Sherlock thins his mouth, glaring at the space between his knees. The pen taps between his hands, so rapid and angry it's fast approaching a blur.
And he's shoved away from it by bureaucratic red tape and his own transport's infuriating inability to piece itself back together.
John has bolted around the corner just in time to see Mr. Moron hauling his fist back against where Sherlock slouches on the sidewalk. Lit only in the glow of the streetlamps, he is a furious and vengeful angel, leading the charge down the street and
Sherlock stared at him, his face almost hollow. It was as if he'd completely forgotten how to talk. His throat jumped again, a thick, audible swallow, and he watched John's every move as he carefully, slowly, slid the glass away.
Sherlock's mouth pulled down, flattening into a small, severe frown. He rocked gently for a moment, back and forth in the creaky, uneven chair, like he was swaying to a beat that only he could hear.
Sherlock had just all but had a panic attack over a man that had abused him. That he couldn't even bring himself to label as abuse, and that he'd been bloody terrified of, but still forced himself to confront because all he'd cared about was that
He opens his mouth, searching for the best words that won't set Sherlock off, while at the same time sending Mycroft away. But it's a tall order, and in the second it takes him to get ready to start, Sherlock has already sat up, and reached for the folders himself.
A new seed of anger started to grow in his stomach, this time closer to righteous fury, and John took a deep breath, forcing himself to stay calm.
It didn't help. It didn't help the anxious fluttering of his heart beat or the tight knot in his stomach at all.
"Because, Sherlock. Not everything important about you is in here." John's hands curl around his scalp, threading again through his hair, running through it and down, cupping him close, so close, so
It was almost dizzying. It was the most touching, considerate thing anyone had ever done for him, and in that, it was overwhelming, because Sherlock knew he could never do anything to pay it back. He knew he could never do anything to be worth all of it, there were never any words to properly express how much this meant to him, and he could never do anything to pay this back to John. The fact that John was sitting there, clearly bracing for what he was expecting to be a furious reaction back, was as ridiculous as it was puzzling.
Another small chapter today that's a little bit more fillery. The chapters after this one are important, but this one is really to just set up Sherlock's state of mind for the fallout that is to come :) (I proofread, of course, but I've also had a glass of wine so a few extra bits of proofready edits are likely to come!)
The reaction is as immediate as it is terrible. Sherlock jolts awake as suddenly as if John had just hit him, flinching backwards in his bundle of sheets and-- and he just continues to gasp. He lies there and clutches his chest and gasps for breath, his eyes blown wide and his hair stuck to his scalp with sweat, and for several horrible moments it's just that. Sherlock, gasping for breath, and John, knowing that he can not stop it.
He sinks down to the bottom step, holding his face in his hands. His feet feel like they're weighed down with concrete and his head is already starting to hurt.
And then there are the head scans, which Sherlock only has to lay still and shut up for, but just because they're easier to kick off doesn't mean they get anywhere. They reveal
He knows something's wrong. Maybe not what, exactly. But Sherlock knows something is wrong, and it has nothing at all to do with the blow to the head.
Sherlock shakes his head against John's skin. He starts to mark another check mark, to assure him that whatever sign he's picked up on, he is still okay. But he's only halfway through when John nudges him onto his side, up enough that they're eye to eye, one hand on Sherlock's face and the other palming a constellation of old cigarette burns in his ribs.
John tends to be good, about disguising his own reactions. When he wants to, at least. His smile drops like a light, but there's nothing there to replace it, either. The line of his jaw goes tight and his hands crinkle into the legal pad, wearing wrinkles into the sheets, but it is only because Sherlock knows John's mannerisms so well that he can see the building storm.
It was what she'd try to say to John about abuse, and abusive relationships. And moving on after they were over, or... not moving on at all. He still wouldn't call his marriage abusive-- if anyone had been abused, it was Sherlock with a bullet to the chest-- but he could at least admit now it had been toxic and unhealthy, and there was no lost love between them by the end. He'd been miserable, in his marriage, but now that it was gone, he'd found himself strangely reluctant to try again. Not just because of Sherlock.
"You've already said that he'd do anything for you, John. He's expressed as much to me himself. I'm simply suggesting that, instead of dangerous plans involving illicit substances and serial killers, he might try something a little more dull instead."
It is all true. He can blame Mycroft for a great many things, but how this case had first played out has never been one of them. It was his own missteps. His own failure. His own decisions, that, as he has told John, he would make again.
"And I still don't know..." The words were stuck in his throat, festering there, like an infected wound, and they didn't want to come out at all but he had to say them. He'd shouted at Sherlock to get a girlfriend, hadn't he? Told him he wasn't a
She barely offers up a half-hearted shrug, the muffin passed from hand to hand and her mouth turned down. "I really would've appreciated him letting me know before tonight." She claims the side of his bed- Sherlock is currently taking up space in the room's only chair, half-asleep through a livestream of a forensics conference in France- and then. Then she just
that would be enough. He wanted to take what he'd done to Sherlock in the morgue and unleash it all on this piece of shit instead. He wanted to take every bit of physical hurt and unfair words and cruelty that he had ever,
There are more steps on the stairs behind them, and John grits his teeth, put even more on edge. He doesn't care that this is a crime scene. The very last thing Sherlock needs right now is more people.
"First time what?" He took another step back, his heart pounding. "That-- that hurt. I didn't like that. I--" Sherlock gulped in a breath of air, trying to unstick the words from his throat, but he couldn't find the right ones to say. What did normal people say, what would a normal person say here? How would a normal person stop this? Damn it,
been this angry at someone for his own sake. But he was furious now and he was just too tired to reign it in anymore.
did he? Oh, he was sure there were plenty of people that would call this freakish and sick and wrong; two
Next to him, Sherlock flinches violently again, rocking backwards against the wall. He goes back to stock still, the bookcase still rattling behind them, and the only motion there is from the corner of his eye is the wretched heaving of breath. He sounds like a cornered, terrified animal.
"Nothing would've ever happened without your permission-- this wasn't going to ever be behind your back. Well, not just your permission, really; everyone's. I've already got Victor's parents, but I want consent for every chapter."
It is four years, since the first time they had this conversation. Since they'd stood there at the foot of the stairs, catching their breath and laughing after a dinner interrupted by a case for the most ridiculous thing they have ever done. It's been four years, and the similarities stick to him like glue just the same as every single piece that is so excruciatingly different.
he gave finally, grimacing. "He didn't do or say anything to imply that things had ended badly with this guy, either. I'm sure if he'd been-- I don't know, abusive or something, he would've said so. Or at least told me to shut up about it." He stopped again, trying to sift through the words, his sense of unease, and land on something concrete. Because obviously Sherlock hadn't been abused or hurt by him, they wouldn't have gotten this far to this conversation if he had, but Sherlock had very clearly not been thrilled to see him.
"You think you ruined him, but the truth is you're nothing more than a footnote in Sherlock Holmes' bibliography. You're barely even that. You're a blip on the radar that no one will even remember past the prologue. But in yours? In yours, which was already written in full the day you decided to take advantage of a fifteen year old?"
it. He can't tell John what goes wrong when something does, if he even would, and he has no way to express
Once upon a time, he would've taken offense at the anxiety comment. Now... now, he just doesn't have the energy for it.
Sherlock still doesn't answer back in words. He doesn't even try. But he lets John hold him and in a moment he presses his face against his shoulder, like a kitten wanting a cuddle. It's about all the strength that he has to move and it feels like being stabbed in the stomach, but Sherlock hides into his arm and his eyes are watering into his sleeve and in that moment, John wants nothing more than to crawl onto the narrow bed with him, wrap him in his arms, and never let him go again.
"What is it?" he started, folding his arms in the center of continued hurricane Mycroft. "Is it that it's another man? That Sherlock's gay? Never would've figured that would bother you, but I guess anyone can be an ignorant arsehole, even--"
But he can't make it come out. He tries, and it doesn't happen, and all he can do is gesture furiously between the two of them again, then to his own throat. It. Doesn't.
Why can he face a madman with a gun on a rooftop easier than he can face a conversation in his own kitchen?
His last stop of the day, instead, was downstairs, a very brief visit in on Dr. Adriana Smith, a lecturer on organic chemistry and researcher into pharmacology, and only employed by Cambridge for the last ten years. Her time at Cambridge didn't come close to overlapping with Sherlock's, so for once, he was able to go down to her office without a building knot of trepidation or a wary sense of protective dislike. John quickly got her statement on the deceased-- he was, after all, at least
"You're also the worst student in the department. Aren't you? What was it-- Victor?" Sherlock didn't want to, not at all, but it was apparent this was the only way he'd get what he wanted, so he turned back around. He turned just enough, switching his attention off from the glorious centrifuge back to where his guide still lingered in the doorway, now looking especially haggard and distracted. And pathetic. "Unless they give all actually
to acknowledge the possibility, but he is a scientist, and he knows he must always acknowledge failure as a possible outcome. And even if today ends in the worst outcome imaginable, with Sherlock collapsed into a panic attack stricken bawling child on the floor, Lestrade has seen him worse. He is not John, where he still has so much pride and stature to lose. It doesn't
It's so awkward and heartbreakingly dull, but he irons out schedules to the very last detail. He eats and sleeps and trims his nails so he can't scratch himself and Skype calls John once a day and what the hell more is he meant to do? He can't
The receptionist is starting to stand, and she's not the only one. Security has taken notice as well, two uniformed officers making a wary, silent approach. John's heart lurches again and he starts forward himself, because oh,
, very tight and very warm, and the look on his face wraps all around Sherlock, too, warm and calming, like a blanket. "I want you to know," he starts, his voice thick through a combination of congestion and sentiment, "that... I want--" he swallows, his finger still playing with Sherlock's. "I'm bloody proud of you and the only reason I'm not kissing you right now is I really, really don't want to get you sick."
Sherlock does not move. Sherlock holds John in place and stares through the slightest gap in the curtains and does not even breathe.
as writing down what he wants, or typing it, is clearly beyond him. He's too frantic. He can't do it.
"Then I'll actually repay this one. As long as whatever you want is reasonable-- come on, Sherlock, you two are bored silly. Even John's bored, look at him!"
and refocuses on Sherlock. "It remains only a tentative identification, at the present moment. Brother mine, if you would be so kind?"
and he finds his hands twitching again, lifting up through the signs just because he can't keep them still.
John just looks at him. He stands there and stares down at him, his eyes unreadable, and Sherlock settles himself in for what is going to be yet another tongue-lashing of a lifetime.
John had let it slide without interrogation, then. His concern over these past several weeks had been devoted to making Sherlock as comfortable as possible, not plying him with questions he very clearly did not want to answer. Sherlock had already guessed it would only be a temporary reprieve.
When they had found Sherlock, their immediate priority had been getting him to the nearest trauma center. The nearest trauma center had been this country hospital that John has spent the last four days in, and it is barebones at best. They don't have the best equipment, and they don't have the best staff. The hospital Mycroft is having Sherlock transferred to is not that far, just an hour and a half away by ambulance, and John only recognises its name as a private one. He spent a few minutes looking at pictures on his phone before they got there, and the rooms look more luxurious than a damn hotel.
There's other noises from behind him then, Lestrade taking the officer and bringing him roughly down the stairs, his voice rising, angry voices and shouting. John blocks it all out without a second thought.
and some horrible piece of himself, deep inside him, had known if John left, then he'd never see have him here again. And nobody has ever thought to accuse Sherlock of being anything less than selfish.
"What is this, then?" he rasps, hands steepled and clenched. Because he doesn't know what this is, he doesn't know what John
Sherlock arcs under his hands, glowing with pleasure and pride. He could say something else, something about how he's positive google will suffice, or how that sounds like a very ungrammatical blog post in the making, and he knows John can do better than
His doctor had been right. Ulcers tended to be resolved safely and with little fuss, but ones that went untreated could make a patient seriously ill, and Sherlock's had been untreated. Sherlock's had been untreated for what sounded like a very long time, in a patient that already hadn't been taking care of himself.
"...An ulcer," he repeated flatly. John worked his jaw, trying very hard to keep himself sounding remotely calm. "At... eighteen."
John couldn't help it, even with his nerves; he smirked and nearly laughed right into his mug. "Can you deduce what about, then?"
This wonderful, lucky Bosco. His only concerns are his next meal, and finding an affectionate enough human to make sure he is petted enough to be satisfied at all times. A simple-minded, loyal, fantastic creature; what must it be like, in their funny little heads? It must not be boring at all. It must be absolutely
Sherlock pauses for a moment longer, exhaling a lingering puff of smoke. His irritation twinges again, a violin string plucked pizzicato and pulled just a hair too tight.
"Of course not. There are a dozen unknown variables outside of my control that I have no ability to reasonably predict. It could be anything from a suggestion for a case or asking if I've got immunity to varicella, because Rosie picked it up at daycare. I am immune, by the way." He smiled again, very slightly, relaxing all the way back into his chair. "I'm a scientist, John. Not a psychic."
Sherlock closed his eyes through a breath, forcibly arranging his most pleasant, socially acceptable smile. All right.
Of course it is relevant. It is the most relevant truth in this entire debacle, no matter how much he wishes it were not.
be the reason that he fails. So he pants and clutches his chest and probably takes ten years off of Lestrade's life, but he lets the man hold his shoulders and talk him through breathing, and slowing down, and not passing out, and it's humiliating and disgusting but he's too worn out to care.
"For what it's worth," the lead of the team says to John, "the Broca's area seemed to be as active as I'd expect. It's hard to gauge it, since he refused to participate in the parts of the exam where he was meant to speak. But..."
That is what he has done now, huddled back into dusty corner, trying to scream. For help, in pain, for John. His arms are still stuck behind him and he protects himself with his knees, but the look on his face is vacant still-- his body is there, but Sherlock himself is not. Sherlock himself is far, far away, locked himself deep in his palace where it's safe. Because he is not safe here anymore.
How long had the call stayed open? He knows Sherlock, he wouldn't have hung up right away, not when John had disappeared like that. Had he heard the cacophony of the fist fight? He must have; John had ended up wrestled to the floor next to the receptionist's computer and the basket of intake folders, it would've been so loud-- oh, shit, shit,
"Don't be ridiculous, John," Sherlock sighs. It's muffled into the pillow, the lovely, perfect pillow,
"Yeah," Lestrade murmurs. His gaze lingers on where the consulting detective is still ranting, his motions aggressive and wild in his back and forth with Donovan. "It's been five months now, yeah?"
"You were brilliant," he whispers, his lips moving against the fringe of his hair. "You were bloody brilliant and you'll be even more brilliant tomorrow. You'll see."
"This is the worst day that anyone has ever lived in the history of recorded time and if you do not save me from it, John, I will
"Were you really going to shoot the explosives? Sherlock?" Lestrade hesitated, sounding nearly upset. "The bomb squad finished looking at them. They were all
"She told him to do it," he forced out, like he was dragging the words through a minefield of broken glass with his bare hands. The words felt distant and tiny, foreign, each one sick in his stomach that made him grind his teeth. He felt defeated. "For me."
But letting that topic continue opened up the possibility for it to turn down some very dangerous avenues, such as
He is self-centered. He is arrogant, narcissistic, and so full of himself his head ought to explode, and those around him would be ever so grateful if he would just stop and think about others for
what he's supposed to say, and there's never anything there trapping him if he gets it wrong. Now it's just one sentence, one question, and now there is no choice; now he must
Things will be better, John swears to himself, his cheek pressed to Sherlock's chest. He doesn't know how or what it is that he'll do. But he can promise this much. Today will not happen again. Sherlock will never feel this trapped or powerless ever again.
Francis nods slightly again when Sherlock does not answer. He can read the reply from the silence, so at least he's useful for something. "Reacting unhappily to unhappy news doesn't necessarily mean anything bad, Scott," he reminds him. It is a mantra that it feels like he has spent months hearing. "Coping with traumatic or unhappy things doesn't mean being happy all of the time. I would be more concerned if John wasn't affected by everything that you told him. It just means that you and he are processing those emotions in a healthy way."
In fact, what John now wanted, more than anything, was an excuse to change the bloody subject. He risked a glance back over at Sherlock to see that his friend at least did look calmer now, still leaned back against the sofa with his tired gaze now floating on the ceiling. The acceptance of his apology did at least seem genuine, this time-- the people Sherlock was really angry at weren't in this room. Those who had made assumptions over the years, and assuredly said things to him much, much worse than
) Sometimes he did need to be nagged into it just to get off the sofa, but he really did think this would be good for him. Something to keep his brain occupied, and prove to the tabloids that the game was back on, to get the private clients trickling in again. Hell, something to be between him and John that wasn't Mary and the morgue and Sherlock's relapse.
John tried again. "Look, if you're not interested in it at all, then that's fine. But I think that you are. Otherwise you would've deleted everything about it days ago. And..." He gave a deliberate pause, raising an eyebrow at Sherlock's downturned gaze. "Are you telling me that if I go look at the mantle, I
"No," Donovan says, stepping further into the room, "I will not. This is my crime scene and my job, not yours. Assuming you were trying to tell me to
Sherlock frowned again, just barely flicking his gaze back to meet his. "Why didn't you ever ask me to do it, then?"
He'd just let it go. Yes? If Sherlock wanted to talk about his university days, and Dr. Andrews, and the professor that he'd hugged, then he would. If he didn't, then he wouldn't. It wasn't John's business to try and drag it out of him. A few years ago, before relapses and a wedding and a fake suicide, John might've demanded it out of him, but this wasn't a few years ago. He didn't have that right anymore, but that wasn't important. He didn't need to interrogate Sherlock about events that had happened decades ago, he just needed to not fuck it up now.
Across from him, Mycroft nods again, looking pale and lost in thought. He finishes doing up the buttons for his jacket, not quite meeting John's eyes. "I will take that into consideration."
"I'm a detective, Molly, not a psychic. Which don't exist, by the way." He breathes in through his nose, the sharp scent of antiseptic and alcohol and blood and medicine. "Everybody likes cake."
"Good," John snaps. There wouldn't have been any long, drawn-out trial anyway, not with Mycroft's influence. He doesn't care.
"Regardless," Francis goes on, after giving him a few moments to collect himself. His face is solemn, and Sherlock no longer quite feels like he's being mocked. "Selective mutism set off by an incident of traumatic stress is very rare. The label selective mutism only really applies for lack of a better one, and I have not been able to find any literature or case studies that would be relatable to your case. While I would very much like to help you, Scott, I'm afraid that I'm flying blind."
"Yes." He closed his eyes, inhaling in the deep, intoxicating warmth that was better than any drug. "
s... allowed. Isn't it. John drinks, he can't get mad at this, I--" There were a few scrapes, Sherlock trying to walk or perhaps just working his feet over the ground. "I hate when he drinks, Mycr... Mycr. It makes him miserable. I wish he wouldn't. Why do we do things that make us misera, miserable, Mycroft, I don't-- 'ld've jus gotten a
John sat for several moments, just looking down at Sherlock's long legs stretched out over his lap. He had never, ever thought he'd actually be this close to Sherlock, and yet here he was. Here they were. Sherlock, warm and pliable all over him, within hugging distance, and if John leaned over to kiss him right now, he knew Sherlock would kiss him right back. It was
He nodded again, satisfied. "Good." He gave Sherlock a kiss on the cheek, just one more, and then dropped back down to sit in the cab.
"I like how four syllable words sound in your voice," John laughs, curling his hands into his hair. He lies still for a second, stroking his hair, forehead to his chest, holding him close. "I
but the man says nothing, just sits there with a raised eyebrow and his eyes on Sherlock. John, a knot in his stomach, is helpless to do anything but follow his gaze, and find what it is that he sees.
John came home from the surgery twenty minutes early, just as Sherlock was carrying the thing across the flat.
There was no room for misinterpretation in Sherlock's words. He hadn't come right out and said it, he hadn't said,
Sherlock smiled wanly back. "This," he said, gesturing, with something that just might've been a smirk. "We're two for two now, on...
And then, flushed, very definitely on his way to drunk, and just an inch away from Oscar's face, he finally
It's not pleasant to hear, no. That Sherlock had hurt John so badly, John's marriage had been an attempt to excise Sherlock out of his life, role of the best man or no. But it is what it is.
John gasps, "you're a nutter, that's what you are." He cradles his face and hair and strokes his cheeks as if they're something indescribably precious, his voice shivering against Sherlock's skin. "You're not making any sense-- you've been practising, haven't you? This isn't the first time--"
Thank you all so much for all the comments/kudos, and for the well wishes- I do feel a bit better now :D And another quick thank you to the amazing J_Baillier for helping me out with NHS procedure here, because my training is American and I wanted to be accurate! I'd point my readers to her fics, but let's be real if you're reading my stuff it's because you have none of her masterpieces left to read ^_^
tired. He buries a hand in the nearest blanket, catching the cotton between his thumb and forefinger, and soon finds himself dropping his other hand down to the sword-scarred leg of the sofa.
Sherlock is capable enough at communicating now, when it comes to crime scenes and his deductions. He texts without issue, and he signs vigorously with Donovan, taking the criticisms in stride. But beyond what he needs for the Work... it's as if there are now two Sherlocks. One, the genius consulting detective, and then, the one that plays violin and loves dogs and curls up delightedly on John's lap. The genius consulting detective is able to speak, albeit with much difficulty. His Sherlock, the one that can not even pretend to be a machine, no matter how much he might like to be one, can not.
John took a deep breath, trying to swallow back his own nausea, his own fury, his own disgust. He felt sick at heart.
Sherlock beamed back at him, already shot towards his coat on the door while even Greg could barely contain his relief-- the return to normalcy was already addictive. "You won't do any such thing," he announced, and tucked his coat around him in a swoop of cotton. "You're bored, too."
John was even more lost than before. The only saving grace was that Mycroft didn't seem to be finding any drugs as he tore his way through the flat, but that was the smallest mercy that there was, barely a pinprick of a balm underneath the churning confusion. What the hell was going on?
winner, for god's sake. John rolled his eyes again, giving Sherlock's shoulder a nudge. "Everyone's second-rate, compared to you." He watched closely as his friend's mouth twitched and curled downwards, like he'd said something that was not at all funny, and sighed. "What've you got to lose, Sherlock?"
When Sherlock does not repeat his order for her to go away, his hands instead fumbling through something else with even less confidence than before, Donovan enters fully into the room. She does still look a bit impatient, but drops to her knees in front of him, taking his hands in her own. "Like this," she explains, "hold your fingers straight. No,
But there are no perfect words, and the harder he tries to say them, the more he understands he's setting himself up for certain failure. He wants a perfect ending, one of the transparently 'witty' sign-offs to one of John's long case write-ups, but there is no perfect ending because this is not a blog post. The borings bits have not been edited out, and Sherlock's words or lack thereof will not be proofread, pruned, and purified to be at their best. It is raw, real, and so
"What good do you think this will accomplish, little brother?" He leans forwards, curling his fingers under his chin to stare at him, to

He's not a child. He's been in hospital before, actually, believe it or not, and is perfectly capable of subsisting without John here. Which is the point, actually- suddenly, Sherlock looks at John, and imagines him going home, and. It's all right.

John's face did a funny thing, again, a cross between amusement and exasperation, and whatever caution he'd had left was thrown to the window. "All right, you arse," he said, crossing the room back to stand right there in front of him, "like
Sherlock has, by now, climbed his way out of the palace. He is cold, still shivering, and humiliated, but he is fully himself again. He supposes he could try to communicate this, if he really wanted to, but John is busy doing up the buttons on his softest shirt, murmuring some nonsense about Sherlock being
The line changes every day, and with Sherlock unable or unwilling to label it himself, John has almost no way to find it.

was going to end up being the prologue to a much less innocent story. John had a terrifying vision of Sherlock dialing Mycroft sitting in a pool of Oscar Wilson's blood, flushed and grinning, and in the same instant knew he didn't fucking care. He'd hide the body. He'd grab Sherlock by the hand and flee the bloody country with him if Mycroft couldn't help them. He'd watched Sherlock be arrested for murder once and it wasn't happening again. Not for this waste of space.
But this, evidently, was not the right thing to say. "Why? Why would you assume I was asexual? Because I'm strange, odd,
Then, mannequin-like, he manipulated Sherlock down under the first layer of the blankets, and rolled him back gently onto his side. So he looked naturally asleep, instead of something much worse.
Thinking things like that-- that he was a horrible person, had nothing left to live for, that the people he loved were really probably best off without him--
He allows the doctor to lead him on through the mostly empty corridors still rubbing his head, intent only on seeking out a taxi idling outside. Once upon a time, he could've counted on Mycroft to have already had a car waiting for him on the kerb.
"He's a second-rate researcher. I have no respect for his science, and I have no tolerance for stupid people. You know this."
This is his life. Mrs. Hudson gossiping about Mrs. Turner's cats, and livers on the kitchen table, and a case pending on his laptop, and his violin in hand. John at the surgery, coming home late tonight because of another meeting with his tutor. Perhaps they can meet at Angelo's instead. This, all of this, is his life. He is
But Greg just fell back into another silence. His thumb traced steadily against the steering wheel and his features were schooled into some sort of sad attempt at nonchalance, but John could see plain as day that there was something underneath it.
and this is now. First it was the trouble of medication interactions, and John watching him like a hawk; then it was the niggling wariness that Mycroft was spying on him, and would see him slipping back into old habits and use that as an excuse to try and commit him. Then it was pride, that he is not so pathetic as to need the help, of course he's not, he doesn't need
Yeah, of course he had. It shouldn't have been his choice. He should've been taken out of university altogether the second it had gotten so bad he'd ended up in the bloody hospital.
Whatever bits of himself he'd been so desperately trying to cobble together before, fighting to just get out one single word, one name after five sickening months of silence-- he's not trying now.
Once again, Victor had been the only person trying to look out for Sherlock. And once again, it sounded like he'd gone about it in exactly the wrong way.
Mycroft; you've never had one of those, isn't that so? No one wants to be friends with a fat, interfering, know-it-all like you, so of course you wouldn't understand what that's like!"
He rolls his eyes. "Only marginally more useful than the flowers your office sent. Who the hell thought I'd have a use for
fucking plans of yours where you think you need to save me by hurting yourself. That doesn't help me, Sherlock. You, getting hurt, seeing you hurt,
know something. This man, this, this slimy slug in a suit, he'd been involved with Sherlock before, and enough so that Greg was able to remember it two decades later and clearly not in a positive light. John had been right. It wasn't just jealousy, it was more than that, this
If this goes the wrong way, if this even hints the slightest at a wrong turn, Sherlock will bolt like a startled gazelle and they can not stop him. They will not catch him.
Sherlock swallows again, forcing his shoulders to relax and his pounding heart to slow, and drops his face back into his exhausted hands.
He lapsed into another silence, his mouth tightly shut. A frown creased across his face, his eyes distant, and John gripped his hand even tighter.
Mycroft would've requested it too, but Mrs. Hudson thinks Mycroft is a vulture and listens to him about as much as she listens to Sherlock's opinions on Mr. Chatterjee.
He tries to tell John that it's okay, again. In as simple language as he can make it, he tries to tell John that it's all right, he is fine, he doesn't need to be sorry. His cold fingers fumble at first, but before he's even halfway through John's face falls, and he shakes his head, wrapping his hands around Sherlock's to keep them still. "No, listen to me. I'm trying to say that I know things have been very difficult for you, and instead of supporting you I'm pretty sure I've only made things worse. Just... god, Sherlock! Look at this--" He splays his fingers through Sherlock's again, cradling them close to his chest. "You can't even talk to me! It's been
Ella gave him a few moments more, as if he might suddenly remember something else that he had done. Which, John thought, was probably fair. He'd already said more than enough for a lifetime, but with Sherlock, it was never that simple. He wouldn't have been surprised if there was more to admit to, either. More for him to apologise for. More that he done
Sherlock has scratched and disfigured those particular scars many, many months ago, rendering the messages illegible with his own nails and cigarettes almost immediately upon escaping from hospital. He is no stranger to pain, and the minor burn of his own cigarettes had barely even registered at all.
it's good. "He broke the vase on her, probably in a fit of drunken rage. They realised she needed medical attention, and staged the burglary to explain it."
He sets himself up on a stakeout at a Starbucks, the paper folded in his lap as he sits at the counter, picks at a muffin, and observes the bank across the street. John is not with him (shift at the surgery), and once the morning rush dies down, the cafe is almost empty. He picks at his muffin. He counts the minutes. He picks even more obsessively at the muffin.
Mycroft snapped, "have been out of the country, and only returned when my staff alerted me to the crisis in its making." He slammed one book down upon finding that it did not contain hollowed out pages and a vial and went straight onto the next. "I was sure it'd be safe to leave my brother's welfare to you for just a few days, but apparently this was an incorrect assumption to make. You have my apologies-- I won't make such a foolish mistake again."
Lestrade looked like he had gotten over the shock by now and was now sharing a significant portion of John’s anger. He was no longer looking at Sherlock, just staring up at Moriarty with a seething rage.
“Yes, it was, I’m sorry to say. We make sure to do that in all rape cases, including oral rape. I know it’s unpleasant to think about but these sort of diseases are highly contagious and you can never be too careful, though luckily all the tests came back negative, so you are perfectly healthy in that respect.” He had never even thought of it as rape before the Doctor had said it. It wasn’t really? Was it? It’s not like Moriarty physically forced him too. He had another option after all. It was either carving out his eyes or getting on his knees. Hardly a decision but it was a decision nonetheless. He had willingly done it, so therefore it couldn’t qualify as rape.
“John?” He called out feeling panicked. He didn’t want to fall asleep. He and John were finally alone and talking.
John wakes up and everything is grey. This feels all the worse because it makes him realize that things had been better lately, and now it’s all come crashing back down. He has a metallic taste coating the inside of his mouth and he realizes he had fallen asleep with the gun still clasped in his hand. It’s a wonder he hadn’t blown his brains out overnight.
They’re sitting down at the table sipping the sweet tea and even sweeter cake when Mrs. Hudson cuts herself off mid-speech (a mild miracle in and of itself) and places her soft hand, freckled with age spots, over Johns own and looks at him with all the motherly fondness John had never gotten from his own mother.
“I assume Mycroft is the reason we’re in an upgraded room?” Both John and Greg seemed to both deflate in relief at the break in silent tension.
grave.” His voice cracked a bit and Ella’s professionally neutral smile turned down slightly at that.
“I—well.” He takes a sip of his water with Mindy staring at him curiously, a bit of confused concern reappearing in her face. “My flatmate. He, um. He…” How does he describe it? Passed away? No, that’s far too calm to describe it. Too peaceful. He supposes he may as well just be blunt. “He died a few months ago.” A soft gasp from Mindy. “I suppose I just haven’t been able to get back in the swing of things…” He trails off poking further at his already melting, runny ice cream.
When John gets walks up the steps and into 221B he doesn’t think. He doesn't berate himself for being the massive bloody
“Oh, I always knew you two should’ve just gone for it!” She complains as she pulls away enough to slap his shoulder. She looks at him and begins to smile all-knowingly. “He liked you too, you know. I always saw it. You made him a better man and that’s proof enough of how he felt about you.”
“What did you want to say, John?” Her voice is perfectly calm and peaceful which makes his clipped off growl sound even more aggressive by comparison.
“Prob’ly a good idea...” he may have argued more under different circumstances but he suddenly felt unbearably exhausted and for once didn’t mind letting Lestrade and John take control of the walking. Slowly and carefully the three men shuffled towards the doors that Anderson and Donovan were already holding open for them and walked out into the fresh air. It felt great to get away from the stale sex-tinged air of the warehouse. Sherlock felt himself begin to shiver as the cool air dried his sweaty skin. Donovan was holding his shirt and jacket and he was tempted to put it on but he knew it would hurt badly on top of his burns. John felt him begin to shake and ran a hand along his back trying to add some friction heat. They had only to wait a few more moments before the sound of sirens filled the air and the ambulance was coming down the road. Everything happened incredibly fast, or maybe Sherlock was just more out of it than he thought, but it barely took three minutes for him too be laid on a gurney (much to his displeasure) and transported into the back of the ambulance with John sitting beside him. He wasn’t sure where Lestrade, Donovan and Anderson were but they must have still been outside explaining the situation to the paramedics and police.
thinking about that) and stripped. Once he was fully in the buff he took a moment to examine himself in the mirror. What he saw was expected, yet disappointing. He looked washed out. His skin was pale and clammy, his hair was verging on uncomfortably greasy, not at all helped by the sweat filled nightmare he’d had the previous night and it was hanging limp on his forehead. His body didn’t look bad, but it looked frailer than he could remember seeing himself in a long time.
John lowers the phone from his ear and sighs. He feels like shit. What is he even doing? Here is a lovely, young girl chasing after him and he’s ignoring her calls.
John’s libido had seemingly dried up right along the time Sherlock had decided to go diving off Barts’ roof.
“Oh John…” She sighs and unexpectedly engulfs him in a warm hug. John startles at first, not exactly being the most affectionate man in the first place, not to mention it was a surprise attack, but her sweater feels soft and her hug is warm and instead of resisting John allows himself to give in to the motherly embrace.
“Of course. I’ll bring the doctor back with me too. He has a lot he wants to discuss with you Mr. Holmes,” he didn’t add anything else as he left the room. The small space seemed to ring with silence as none of the three men seemed to know what to say. Eventually Sherlock decided the awkwardness was too much and broke the silence himself.
“Promise?” Sherlock blamed this ludicrously vulnerable question on the morphine and torture-induced exhaustion.
Thank you to everyone and anyone that left comments and/or kudos so far. Each comment made my day and inspired this chapter to be created.
“Please,” Johns voice was quiet now, he already knew that Sherlock had made up his mind and yet he was still trying to change it, ever the good soldier. “Please, Sherlock, if you care about me at all you won’t do this. I-I can’t let you do this for me. I won’t be able to live with myself if you do.” Sherlock knew there was a certain selfishness to his choice, that John would no doubt be plagued by guilt and yet he knew that if he let John loose his eyes instead that very same guilt would be targeting him and he knew he couldn’t handle that. So yes, he was going to be selfish he just prayed that by the end of this John would be able to forgive him.
People have only ever hurt John anyway. He doesn’t need them. All he needs is the one friend who’s never let him down. He walks over to the kitchen cabinet he has been frequenting and pulls down his good old friend Jack Daniels.
done and though he can understand how that feels he has no idea what Mindy could have done to invoke that feeling in herself. She’s been nothing but kind since the beginning. John’s the fuck up.
However, Sherlock Holmes was never one to hide and instead put on his most haughty face and spoke with his voice dripping disdain. To the rest of the world he would look utterly above all this.
He didn't realise until John's hands gently closed around his that he had been perfectly silent, now, approaching on two minutes. Three? His brain had been knocked offline. And John didn't like when he did that, John worried--
"But you have... elected to not do that. Which is not something that I predicted. But you have. Meaning my need for Milgram has expired, and my interest in the results of the experiment have waned. I- that is. ...Thank you, John."
He spends a lot more time in the palace, these days. Whether there's a case or not, whether he has a puzzle that he can't solve or not. John supposes he can't begrudge him that. If he'd had a mind palace, after Afghanistan? A place where his shoulder and his leg didn't hurt, and he was free to do whatever he wanted without having anyone there to watch him fail?
John, while sick, exhausted, and clearly wanting nothing at all more than to just put his head back down on the floor and go back to sleep, has drawn him a map to milk and eggs and tea.
"No. I am simply telling you that this is not the first time Sherlock has lost his voice in response to a traumatic experience, and that all manners of expensive therapy, tempting with snacks and books, and any other forms of reward, accomplished little. He only chooses to adjust his behaviour when he deems it worth it." He pauses and frowns, his expression souring. "Though, do continue tempting with snacks. He's barely eating, John-- I presume we would both like to avoid a hospitalisation for malnutrition?"
If Sherlock could ever think he'd side with Mycroft against him over this, then it's because John has seriously,
At his silence, John sighs, looking particularly displeased. He takes a moment to find the words, but as he does, he runs a thumb over the back of Sherlock's hand, and the feel of it is exquisite.
John is sitting there now at the clearest spot at the table, a piece of toast in his hands as he waits for the kettle to boil. He can't see Sherlock very well, from that position. Just out of the corner of his eye, and if Sherlock wriggles properly down beneath the blanket, then he can't see his face.
Mindy looks at him and John finally puts it together. He feels a familiar feeling of dread creep over at him and wonders at what it says about him that he finds feeling dread ‘familiar’. Mindy doesn’t look sad. She doesn’t look disappointed. She looks like John. Guilty and ashamed and heartbroken. John wants to reach out to her. Tell her it will be okay, everything’s fine, it’s all okay. But it won’t and it’s not, so he ends up saying nothing while waiting for this beautiful,
John thinks about arguing; denying any possibility that he had a chance with Sherlock but when he looks down and see’s the tired smile, deep laugh lines and hopeful eyes staring back at him he doesn’t have the heart. He can’t
He wishes he could tell her that it doesn't matter. That no matter what she’s done John won’t mind. But John knows better. He’s not as naïve as he used to be and he’s been bitten and burned by far too many people to have such blind faith in them anymore. Sherlock had been his last exception to that rule.
“Oh… John...” She pats John’s hand and gives it a tight squeeze. “I know you boys had something special. He was different with you; softer. That man always did need a bit of softening.” She tuts.
They both waved goodbye once more and then John left and found his way up onto the street. He walked the rest of the way to Baker Street and tried to ignore the empty, gaping feeling in his gut. It didn’t work.
“No, it’s, um, surprisingly comforting. Thank you.” He can feel himself getting flustered now and wills the blush in his face to go down. John chuckles softly.
Even before he met the banker he had assumed Sherlock had been on the less popular side of the social chart though after meeting him he was absolutely sure of it. The barely concealed contempt was plain as day in the way Sebastian talked of the detective and the way Sherlock called him “Seb”, an expression that seemed strangely friendly for two people who seemed more like old enemies than friends. The memory broke his heart a little. It made him seem so much more vulnerable than he was used too, and that’s why he seemed so out of place in social situations. He was vulnerable and there was something unnerving about the usually aloof man being so uncharacteristically unsure of himself.
awkward. They had both given him strange well-wishes and what Sherlock thought may have been (and John later confirmed) a thank you. He didn’t really think it was necessary but he excepted it with minimal fuss to get them out of his room quicker. Donovan also hadn’t called him freak once. In fact, neither her nor Anderson had thrown a single insult at him which was thoroughly uncomfortable and made Sherlock all the more excited to get back on his feet so they could all go back to hating each other. Greg had continued to visit each day but thankfully Anderson and Donovan stayed away after that.
Maybe he had noticed but ignored it because that’s what they did, Sherlock and him. They just ignored things. Now John would give anything to get a second chance, a chance to not ignore it. A chance to change his last words he had said to him from the choked up accusation –
“John, I-“ She cuts herself off and picks up her bag she had thrown carelessly on the floor less than ten minutes ago. “I think I should just go for tonight.”
“I know you won’t want to see me anymore, but please just listen first.” She waits for him to object, to say something but John doesn’t know what to say anymore. He’s so tired and words never seem to do him justice.
When he’s finished, his hands are sore and oily and his legs feel stiff from sitting cross-legged so long. Still holding his freshly cared for gun he stretches out and lays down on the bed. He breathes in and the citrus smell of Sherlock and gunpowder and oil have mixed together. John breathes it in deep, completely intoxicated.
Would one date really hurt? It would give him both some human contact and an excuse to get out of the flat, and God knows he could desperately use both of those things.
the enemy. He feels the shame hit him yet laughs because he can’t remember the last time he didn’t feel ashamed of himself. Well, he can actually. It was before he had let his best friend die in front of him.
“When exactly will I be able to go home?” Sherlock didn’t bother with pleasantries. He never had before and he wasn’t exactly planning to start now. Surprisingly Dr. Richards didn’t look taken back at all and instead just gave him an amused grin.
“What? No. I was only a Detective Sergeant back then. Gregson was the one that decided to let him in on crime scenes. I thought he was completely shady.” They both start chuckling and it feels good. It almost feels like the times before The Fall when him and Greg would go have a pint and vent about Sherlock until they were giggling and drunk.
“Well, hello there! Nice to see you Sherlock! I was hoping you’d decide to pop in and say hi to your good old friend Jim.” his body tensed and suddenly all the smugness left his body at the sound of that familiar mocking tone.
“NO! No, stop Sherlock! Stop this right now!” he so wished John would be quiet; he really wasn’t making this any easier to do. He took as deep of a breath as he could before slowly lifting the blade to his eyes. In less than two minutes he would never see again. He would be stuck in eternal darkness. He’d never see his mothers face again or see John smiling. How would he tell if Mycroft gained weight? He supposed he could work something out with the heaviness of his footsteps but it would certainly be an adjustment. The blade was nearly to his eye now; barely a millimeter more and it would touch the soft vulnerable flesh of his eye. When Moriarty spoke up again it was in a voice so loud it nearly made Sherlock jump and prematurely dig the blade into himself.
An experiment would probably end disastrously. And then John would look at him with such disappointment and irritation, and he doesn't know the expiration date of John's newfound patience for him, but surely there is one and this would be a surefire way to find it.
"Or... was I right, with Sherlock?" Oscar started, before he'd even reached three. "He's sleeping with you, too?" There was a short pause that reeked in smugness, and even with his eyes shut he could just
John shoved to his feet, his throat working furiously and his eyes gone from clear to stormy in the space of a second. For a second, Sherlock almost expected him to throw a punch, but all he did was haul his jacket up from the arm of the chair. "All right, then," he snapped, shrugging it on, "all right," and it wasn't a surprise at all when the door shut with a slam.
Sherlock refuses to rise to the bait, and the worried knot in John's stomach grows until it's almost impossible to swallow.
Greg blinked. "That's what this is about? No. No idea, actually." He frowned again, transferring his gaze back to the road. "I know he studied at Cambridge, a long time ago, but it's not as if he ever talks about it. I don't think he had a great time there, but... come on. It's Sherlock. It's pretty easy to guess he wasn't the most popular kid in school." He tried for another grin, but John wasn't exactly in a joking mood, and it faded back into barely concealed concern as the light changed to green. "Is something going on?"
He still won't look at him, his face turned severely away and now about as open as a brick wall. He's ice cold and angry, his lips pressed together and his shoulders gone heartbreakingly tense; he's furious again, as furious as he was at the terrible neuropsychologist, but now he's not furious at anyone but himself. It's right there on his face-- Sherlock isn't mad at John. Or maybe he is, a little, but that's not the bulk of it. He's frustrated and upset and above all else, he's mad at himself.
"Sherlock. Come on, try to relax. Take another breath. I know you're in pain, there's nothing we can do for that here--"
"Yes," Sherlock coughed, clearing his throat. "In any case. Oscar was irritated with me. And that became anger, when he realised that this time I wouldn't be able to rise to his expectations. I was too sick. I tried, but I kept being able to barely leave my room, never mind stand up in a lecture hall or lab. I kept not being able to eat, and then not being able to keep down what I could."
"It's okay," mind palace John tells him, his fingers tracing a line down the back of his neck. "You're okay, sweetheart.'
John stared back down at his hands, this time in no small effort to stop himself from looking at Sherlock's lips instead. This wasn't exactly something he wanted to ever discuss with Sherlock, and for reasons that he could never tell him.
Mycroft looked just about as exhausted and relieved as John, and more than ready to get off the emotional rollercoaster. He sat across from him with his one hand still dangling limply, the other over his face, and John couldn't tell if he wanted to shout at Sherlock or thank him. Sherlock, meanwhile, was now
Mycroft held a finger to his lips, meeting John's eyes and waiting there in the silence of the flat, only the vibrating of his phone to break the fallout of the devastated quiet that had settled after all that John had learned here tonight. John nodded once, not daring to even open his mouth,
Sherlock buried his face deeper into the cushions. He took in a deep, long breath, inhaling the familiar scent. Is that what the problem was? Really? John was almost killed, several different times in several different ways, and the problem was that Sherlock hadn't let him in on his plan before it had all ended up going awry anyway?
It's an obvious dismissal, and John couldn't be more grateful. He understands Greg needs to allow certain latitudes from her-- she
If he'd watched someone else hurting Sherlock like that a few years ago, before Mary's death, the wedding, the fucking fall, he'd have-- have--
So John did his best to stay calm, and he let Sherlock sit silently in the seat next to him, arms folded and his stubbly, rough face cold and all but shut down, and ignoring the both of them as if his life depended on it.
The Broca's area is associated with speech production. It has been their first guess for a culprit, in why Sherlock is suddenly unable to speak.
This isn't normal. This isn't typical behavior, for a flashback. This isn't just a panic attack. Sherlock is completely unresponsive, and has been so now for several minutes.
be interesting! This conference! That I told you about days ago! Sherlock-" John kneaded a hand into the bridge of nose, and he actually looked a bit annoyed, now. "All right. I'm not going because it's my job, I'm going because I
John sits back down next to him again, reclaiming Sherlock's cold hand, and tries very hard to swallow the knot of unease that just keeps getting bigger and bigger.
If he can't do this today, there is always tomorrow. If he can't wait until tomorrow, there is always today.
"I'm sure Milgram will be thrilled," he said, and handed John his now tragically empty cup. "Now go raid the fridge for me- I've a suspicion that what we're looking for is masquerading as a milk carton. And then get us some more tea."
He thinks about that chart, a mile long in Sherlock's room and with months of pages still to be added.
where he's fighting a smile because he doesn't want to indulge Sherlock but is going to give in anyway. "And stop being such a baby. When I was shot I was in rehab for months."
Mycroft sticks his meddling fingers back deep into the entire unfolding mess, and four days after his admittance, Sherlock is very carefully bundled into a nest of blankets, sedated heavier and strapped to a gurney, and transferred to a new hospital.
Ella waited for him again. She watched hm only in calm, neutral sympathy, no expectations, no demands, just letting the words to settle. But they fell on deaf ears. It felt like John had just walked into a brick wall and was now just standing there, repeatably ramming his face against it.
He waited a minute more, hoping inquiring minds would investigate without requiring him to broach the subject. John, however, spent his time doing precisely nothing but sitting there in his chair, blinking up at the ceiling, and looking like he wanted to go to sleep.
Sherlock. You are seeing a therapist, you are clean, you have an actual relationship, stop the presses, my god! And yet everybody else seems astronomically more invested in preserving your health and happiness than you do! You want to throw all this away, and for what?!"
It's a very simple case of cause-and-effect: his life is what it is because of John, and if he loses John--
He looks at Sherlock, out of the corner of his eye. He's gone bloodless and cold, the rage darkening in his eyes, and for several seconds there is nothing but horrible silence.
Sherlock looked down at him, very pale and his face still unreadable. He said nothing at all, instead stepping away after a few more moments of silence, crossing the room to linger by his own chair.
He suspected Oscar's retirement was forced as well. Cambridge didn't care about the marital affairs of their staff, but they certainly did care when they were with former teenage students, with the tabloid 'journalists' already suggesting they'd be looking to find out if that relationship had started before Sherlock had left school. Sherlock suspected Mycroft had played his hand, as well.
, I want to... I want to very much. But if we are, then we need to talk about Oscar. And what happened last night."
even was. "He's just been really quiet the past few days and I think it's more than just Sherlock being Sherlock, you know? He's meeting one of his old professors for drinks in a few days and maybe he's a bit nervous about it, I don't know." Or maybe that was John and a bloody inferiority complex. "The one who won a Nobel Prize and all, because of course Sherlock knows someone who's won a Nobel Prize..."
for me to come home because you couldn't be bothered to move three feet... that you have stood by, and with your own two eyes watched me water a
He has been attempting renovations for the past several months, but his efforts have been paltry and sad. They are nothing but pathetic, standing here now, looking out at the devastation torn through the halls of his own mind. He has been reluctant and hesitant, because he does not want to do what must be done. The wreckage can not be cleaned. The relevant files must be saved, and he must build a new wing, one that is entirely from scratch. He must clear away the destroyed bits of himself entirely, and use what remains to create the foundations for something new. One that did not endure what he did, and is not scarred and beaten from being burned down from within to protect John.
And because he hoped that if he turned this into less of an interrogation, if he took the expectation of a monologue off of Sherlock, this would be easier. It was one thing, to sit here and demand answers out of Sherlock, out of what had quite clearly been a very painful period in his life, and one that he clearly still didn't quite understand. It was, John hoped, quite another, to establish a give and take.
"What I mean is," he finally said, "you stressed earlier how important you thought it was that we not keep secrets. That we be honest with each other. And I want you to... know what exactly you are getting into, before you commit. Because I. You. I would much prefer it, if. If you thought that I could change, there is actually a limit to how much I am capable of it, and I suspect that limit is rather low, and... if you decided this was insurmountable, then... then I would prefer you know it now, and not--"
Sherlock sinks deeper into the blanket, his stomach churning. He buries his face in his knees, but really, he'd rather bury himself into the bloody floor.
"Sherlock?" he calls again, a littler softer, now. "Sherlock, it's John. Are you all right? Answer me, Sherlock!"
Sherlock traces a hand over the mirror again, then his own body, a finger drawn through the former brand that arcs over his waistband. It's rough and uneven, and one of the marks that John insists he thinks will fade entirely, if he leaves it alone. He takes a deep breath and feels the shift of his skin underneath his hands.
So John isn't surprised in the slightest when, after paying the cabbie and checking in on Mrs. Hudson, he makes his way upstairs to find Sherlock already in his mind palace.
"I figured out what queer meant eventually, obviously. And I knew what happened to people that were. But I thought I was okay, because I liked girls, didn't I? Harry was the one who had to be careful, but I was straight. I was safe. It was normal to think the rugby captain was hot, wasn't it? Everyone thought the exchange student was cute. It wasn't gay to shag your commanding officer, or-- or to have to go for a walk because your bloody Calvin Klein model flatmate won't put on more than a fucking sheet."
But she's not here, and instead it's a choice between being in pain and less bored, and being in less pain and
"Yes, yes, I remember. Whatever I can do to help." He ticked his pen between his hands, one skeptical eyebrow raised. "No Sherlock Holmes today, then?"
"Please don't-- look like that. It's okay, I promise. But can you just... can you give me something, here?"
"John," Lestrade says softly, voice kept low to ensure they don't attract Sherlock's attention. He sounds uncomfortable at best, and is clearly unsure of what to say. "If you want me to hold off on the cases for a while--"
He smacks himself again, panting as if he's run miles, as if he's still running. His face contorts and suddenly he looks absolutely furious. Oh, god.
Mrs. Hudson moves away to continue her fussing, setting the bowl down and straightening up the kitchen and in general being his housekeeper. "Oh, this is so
Toothpaste and/or mouthwash are both too far away to bother. He drags himself back over to the sofa and collapses back down, huddling underneath the blanket and shivering. He feels empty and scraped hollow, his insides aching as his legs trembled with every step and his throat now throbs.
His mouth moves a lot. His lips forming words, throat jumping as he breathes in, spelling out a silent monologue to whoever is there to listen. And when John had first seen that, months ago--
He just knew he had to open the door. Because if he didn't, and they started this with secrets and trauma still kept silent between them, then it was putting that many more obstacles in their path to making this work.
Now Sherlock rolls his eyes, his fingers tapping against each other even faster. He's amused, even while trying only to look exasperated instead, and John knows he's won.
It is simple, spoken language. He just-- opens his mouth, and sound comes out. Human beings have been doing it ever since they evolved out of the ocean; even since before they evolved into
he was proud of Sherlock for it. He wished he'd been there to see it for himself. "Well. If I ever see you so much as try to contact Sherlock again, then I'll do the same to your career-- or at least, whatever's left of it. I'll post a tell-all on my blog; you know the one, don't you? Very popular. The Queen's a fan, I've heard." He paused, waiting for the whiny shit to get it. "No one will ever be able to google your name again without getting headline stories of sexual abuse. Good luck explaining that one to Cambridge."
he repeats into the warm skin. He scratches the checkmark into his hand, and as much as he loathes the need for it as a safe word, he's grateful for it now.
"I think she knew if she hit Rosie I would leave her, and there was nothing to be gained by hitting me. Maybe she knew you'd kill her if she did, I don't know. She--"
John very much needs an answer. He won't call Mycroft, Sherlock realises-- he's asking for his permission and if he doesn't give it, then John won't call him. He will find another way. John wants Sherlock to trust him, more than anything else, and he refuses to bring Mycroft into this if Sherlock doesn't want him to.
John kisses him once, right in the most wine-sticky shoulder. He runs his hand through Sherlock's hair, barely disguising a snicker at the rat's nest therein, and rolls onto his other side with his phone in one hand and a yawn in the other.
The things he felt in replacement weren't exactly positive. But he wasn't anxious. So there was at least that.
He's been reluctant to play for John until he's rebuilt his callouses and fully restored the muscle memory, but the look on John's face whenever he
"I'm so sorry," John finally rasps again. He strokes his hair with shaking fingers, still sounding perilously close to tears. "I'm so... tell me you don't hate me, Sherlock.
He stays there, sitting in the deepest level of the palace, where it's cold and dim and he's shivering in his coat, aching all over and shellshocked. He keeps his head in his knees, breathing into his trousers, and above all else, he keeps his mouth shut.
Because there is nothing John can do against Mycroft Holmes, the man who has tea with the head of the NHS, golf with a judge, and biscuits with the Queen. Sherlock does not fit the criteria for sectioning, but that's not the question that will be asked. John can throw him out of the flat with that baseball bat right now, and that does not change the fact that Mycroft has the power to take Sherlock away.
"Yeah?" He sounded angry again, somehow, his voice warped to be low and threatening, but more than that, Sherlock almost heard an element of hurt. "So, what, then? I'd be left sitting up here knitting a tea cozy, and meanwhile Lestrade is on his way over to tell me you got blown up by a sociopath and I'm never going to see you again?"
Sherlock squeezes his trigger finger, and Jim Moriarty dies in 2010, shot in the head and bleeding out into the moonlit pool.
It doesn't matter how posh a prison it is. A prison is still a prison, and he knows that is how Sherlock will see it.
John closed his eyes again, breathing harshly through his nose. He wanted to break something. He wanted to break Oscar's nose.
"That's very nice. This was 1999, and she was speaking to me as a family friend, not as a physician." Mycroft sighed deeply, setting his own tea down. "Sherlock, of course, refused to speak to me about it, and I deemed it to be a non-emergency. If he needed assistance, he knew where to find me."
to make him happy and stop being the reason he's miserable and never give him cause to leave ever again, but he's also spent weeks upon weeks being

It had been transparent, truly. Obviously. Thinking back on it now- it was Moriarty's playbook exactly, speaking to him through another's voice, playing the game one step ahead. It had been so
Lestrade finally let his shoulder go, his hand gone cold and clammy. He's looking at him in a way that's just
He wanted to punch him. He wanted to swing his fist back, and punch him in the face. Wanted to see his skin beaten black and blue, and for his fist to hurt, and to know it was because of him.
Sherlock hiccuped again, his breaths unsteady. "I called Mycroft," he stammered again, "I didn't... John. It's fine, I know you're not gay, it's fine, I don't--"
"John!" Sherlock swiveled upright, swinging his long legs off the sofa to fold himself in two to stare at his ridiculous flatmate. "That is not a thing. That is a
John thumbed his thin wrist, previously folded underneath his side, and felt his breaths. His heartbeat was steady, albeit underneath admittedly cool skin, and his breaths were even and deep.
to be happy, but it wasn't until he left Mary that it actually happened. And it's not Sherlock's own inability to comprehend human sentiment, because he's not the only one to see it. More than one person has told him that they haven't seen John look the way he does now in a very, very long time.
but he didn't have to. It was the day at the tarmac all over again, with Sherlock opening his mouth and John so sure he was going to say it only for something else not quite it to come out, but-- John heard what he meant. He heard what he hadn't said. He felt it.
Oh, take a break for a couple years, that was normal, jump off a few rooftops, have a botched marriage, a few attempted murders--
Which is why he's now popping in on Lestrade in the waiting room for A&E, and Lestrade, perhaps coincidentally, looks like he wants to turn around, call in sick, and not leave his flat for the rest of the week.
if he tries to touch him, but all the bastard does is gesture with enough smugness to choke on it. "He barely sleeps; he certainly didn't last night-- I can see it from here--"
"Now I really will throw up." Sherlock sunk deeper into his chair, almost folding up into himself like a prickly porcupine. The only signs of life in him were two glittering eyes underneath the wild fluffy wreck of his hair. "I think I did throw up on his shoes, actually.
He remained quiet at first, still looking anywhere but at John. Another moment passed and he wound his fingers together very tightly, as if to keep them still. "If you'll forgive me for possibly overstepping again. But... you did not seem to be very happy with Mary. Even before the shooting."
and what's worse is that they reveal nothing in the most stubbornly unhelpful of ways. They confirm that there is at least no blocked nerve or swelling contusion or TBI, but that just means they have to look deeper, and that's when they run into a brick wall. They have him in an fMRI and run him through the standard battery of questions, mapping cortical activity, but the map is utterly useless when there's nothing to compare it to.
There was another period of silence, Sherlock averting his eyes again to stare down at his tea, expressionless. He was cold and pale and perfectly in control, but the tight curl of his fingers in his lap told John exactly how calm he wasn't.
John is nearly thirty-five years old, and has lived through war, being shot, an alcoholic sister, and a drunk shithead of a father.
Sherlock takes only a moment to glance through it before his face lights up like it's bloody Christmas. He claps his hands, all but upending his experiment in his haste to stand, and he's off back to get dressed like a rocket with his eyes bright and his smile like the sun.
"It would be understandable if you were," Ella started gently. "You've just lost your wife, so for Sherlock to--"
John." He squeezed his eyes shut, counting to ten. Wasn't sure why. It was something Normal People did, to calm down. All it meant was it was now ten seconds later.
There was a very small scratch on one cheek. Barely noticeable, except to the trained eye, but John's was trained, and he knew Sherlock's face better than his own. As he watched, Sherlock scratched at his chin, still dark with stubble, then his scraped cheek, just the same. It made him look so much older.
"Special?" he started, a new warmth and delight unfolding in his chest with pride, right along next to a solid sense of disbelief.
John can't stand the silence. He wants to stay with Sherlock, and feels absolutely dreadful for leaving him like this, but he can't take it anymore. He can't take having zero response from Sherlock to tell him that what he's doing is helping. He can't take looking after a hyperventilating doll for hours and the only answer Sherlock is still able to give him is nothing beyond a dull, miserable nod.
They make it outside together, Sherlock staggering on long, trembling legs, like a nervous colt. He is in pain, with the wave of the panic attack's adrenaline now crashing, his blood sugar assuredly in the toilet, and as much as Sherlock clearly hates it and wants to pretend otherwise, he needs the help. They only somehow get down to the ground floor, and then outside after it.
He couldn't do anything to protect Sherlock. He couldn't do anything to go after the people that had done this to him after the fact. And now he can't even be there for him in the aftermath, because he's not a bloody one in a million genius able to pick up an entirely new language in just a matter of weeks.
Sherlock who was in pain and didn't like new people, and his wife was a bloody lying assassin that had put him there. And John, who had so
John glares at Mycroft, his heart thudding and close to breaking in his chest. On one hand, Mycroft has only done good today-- Mycroft has brought news that all of the people who've done this to Sherlock are dead, and Sherlock
and that was it, happily ever after, but that was just it. It wasn't going to happen. The fact that Sherlock was interested in men after all certainly did not mean he was interested in John.
The headline was about the latest rugby game. Well, that was a no go. He wasn't entirely sure Sherlock could even name one of the country's top rugby teams. The next page was on the ongoing prime minister election, which was another no. If there was anything Sherlock had less interest in than sports, it was politics.
The politician gives Sherlock another look, even as he slips two files out from under his arm with a faint
He doesn't remember the details. He remembers the Skype call with Sherlock, and very distinctly remembers being called a philistine. More fuzzily, he remembers hearing shouting from outside, and getting up to go investigate.
And John knew Sherlock was not the same person that he'd moved in, all those years ago. He was an incredibly different man than the one who'd risen from the dead just three years ago. He was more aware of people's feelings, and more reluctant to hurt them, but... but surely that wasn't all this was.
"I'll think about it," he settled on at last, swallowing his protest down. No matter that he disagreed with what she was suggesting, the core off what Ella had said was still right. It needed
Sherlock shifts on the ground, suddenly and exorbitantly uncomfortable. He says nothing. Of course he says nothing.
Which was, incidentally, how Sherlock ended up sitting at the kitchen table before his microscope, one severed leaf pinned between a pair of laboratory scissors and held aloft, and-
him. I hit him once because I thought he was going to hurt someone, but then I kept hitting him. I hit him until he was on the floor and someone had to pull me off of him and then I looked at him, and I told him he deserved it."
Neither had the pep talk. Or the promise to ring him later. Or the gentle squeeze of his hand at the door, actually.
One soft, well-worn bee plush was very quickly thrown at John, and then, batted at Sherlock. Mrs. Hudson was the only one to escape unscathed, pushing cups of tea at all the adults in the room while Rosie matched her little hand against a bewildered Sherlock's. Mrs. Hudson was over the moon at it all, and Sherlock sat there on the floor exhausted and bleary-eyed and beaming, and John was ecstatic.
Sherlock has left the lights off, so John follows his lead, crouching across from him in the dark. He's still panting and trembling like mad, his eyes tracing John like a hawk's. Something about his face warns him to stay back.
"Victor," he repeated, and cold fury started to root in Sherlock's chest. "I was very worried for you when I heard that you'd started associating with him, Sherlock. You were much too good for him."
Greg shares a look with John and shakes his head, gently disengaging to leave all of Sherlock's weight on him. "I'll go get the car," he promises, already set off at a jog, and John can barely contain his relief.
at him. He didn't get it. He really didn't understand what John was trying to say. "I've... had worse," he said, and shifted uncomfortably, arms curling around his stomach. He clearly didn't want to talk about this. "I've really had much worse, John. It's--"
All right! I'll probably be a bit scarce for a few weeks, my next trick is looking to be quite messy- but I will be back! This time, with more of your regularly scheduled angst programming! A small preview, of what I'm working on for next...
"Hello," he said. He glanced between them both for a moment, his voice low, and oriented himself at the woman. She was similar to Kitty Riley-- absolutely vicious, and would do anything for a good story. It just so happened that most of her stories were actually rubbish since she worked for the Sun. Perhaps giving her a story that could actually be fact-checked would help her career. "Recognise me?"
Ella tilted her head back, sharing with him a quietly amused look. "For any other patient that had been attacked by a serial killer, yes. And of course he didn't deserve what happened to him, and the blame only lies with Culverton Smith. But from everything you've said, it really sounds as if Sherlock intended to be attacked by that man. But John,
John is bleary and so tired, thumbing through literature in his lap that examines the addictive potential of the painkiller that Sherlock is on, a new medication, something that smells like Mycroft. He's exhausted, and sets his phone down to go for a cup of water, and-- Sherlock's awake.
It even made sense about Oscar, too. Sherlock clearly had not been a popular student, far from it-- he'd heard how Sebastian Wilkes had talked about him as a peer, and now he'd heard how his teachers talked abut him as a student. Sherlock had been hated while he was in school. If Oscar had been kind to him, if Oscar had liked him, then it really seemed like he'd been the only one to do it. Of course Sherlock would've been close to the only person who'd not hated him.
you don't need me to stroke your ego here. You're cleverer than he could ever be even on your worst day."
Lestrade grins faintly, nodding once. He looks exasperated but still fond, the absolute disaster of a detective still causing him no end of trouble but he's still willing to deal with it, if it's what it takes to help Sherlock right now. When he so clearly needs it so much, while at the same time despising every attempt any makes to try and make things easier for him. Any other DI probably would've tossed a mute Sherlock off their crime scene ten minutes ago, and John is grateful that Lestrade hasn't.
"There we go," he said, very gently looping his arm back around his. "You're still stiff as a board, you know... there's no need to be worried. It's
John tucks him into bed despite it being barely half six, because there's really no sense in pretending Sherlock is going to come online, eat takeaway in the sitting room, and watch bad telly with him any time tonight. John draws the sheets and blanket up around him instead, all the way up to his chin, watching him all the while with wary, worried eyes and his hands hovering against his hair. He lingers still when it's all done, sitting next to him and not seeming sure at all what he's supposed to be doing.
With no answer forthcoming, John gave in to the urge to protect and stand up for Sherlock, because that was about the only thing left that he had. "Will you put that
He just about gets drawn and quartered for the proposal. The number of Mycroft's goons outside his room doubles, and his brother swears if he tries anything again, he will contact the parental unit.
It's silly and boring, is what it is. Sherlock only needs to stall for just a minute or two, until John notices he's gone missing and tears off around the corner looking for him, thereby giving Lestrade a convenient assault to witness. Sherlock could end the fight in one hit, but that would rather defeat the whole point, so he lets himself get roughed up a bit, instead. An angry elbow gets into his ribs, but it's the ice underfoot that is his true humiliation. His ankle twists underneath him and
But John's reaction would be even more unfortunate, if Sherlock kept this from him and waited for him to find out on his own.
Sherlock is bored, of course. Sherlock is bored, and restless, and twitchy, and growing even more bored and restless and twitchy by the day. It was doable, when his body was still broken, and no matter how twitchy he was he could barely make it down the stairs without John's help. It stopped being doable, when the final cast and restriction came off, and John was handed back one very stiff, very sore, very quiet boyfriend, who was so desperate for something to do that he insisted upon walking the two miles home.
He's slow, still. His mind isn't working like it should. The facts are there, but they're muddled, and he has to taste them on his tongue before he's at all sure. He'd blame it on the drugs, on inaction, on the pain, but evidence seems to suggest he's been this slow ever since coming back from the dead.
"Pictures," Lestrade instructs, slipping his mobile out. "Pictures only. When I go back to interview the victim, you're staying put. And then someone is taking you back to your room."
She hadn't shot anybody else and then had the gall to sit there and claim she'd done nothing wrong, so he should count his blessings?
Bloody idiot, that man was. He could show up to his date wearing his dressing gown and the pink tee-shirt from the startup band
to talk to. Not to mention the husband's history. I guarantee there's a record of domestic disturbance calls. When one spouse is willing to harm another, there is
And-- that was that. John grinned at him from the cab, giving him a small wave from the window, and then the cab pulled away and he was gone. He was leaving Baker Street with Sherlock left on the kerb, his face flushed and warm, to go pick up his daughter, and come back with her to him the next morning.
"Milgram," he said. "Stanley Milgram. Stanley Milgram was a researcher at an American university in the sixties. Though the ethics of it have now been called into question, the validity of the results have not been, and- and you know I tend to test my theories with experiments, in which- Milgram is most famously known research into obedience to-"
His fingers curled into each other again, nails digging into the skin. He was disgusted enough with himself to throw up.
Sherlock smiled faintly into his tea. "You have no idea what scientists do." He took another perfunctory sip, his bloodshot, weary eyes flickering away. "I know the chemist who made that initial discovery. That led to that article."
"Well?" John asks. He spreads his hands, arranging the steadiest, most confident smile that he can. "Go on, let me have it. I can see you thinking it."
"You're going to ask me if I'm interested in a collaboration," he said flatly. "I'm afraid the answer is no."
If ever there was a time, it would be now. But he can't even open his mouth. Earlier he'd at least gotten past that step; now he can't even make it that far. He
It was an almost full glass of hard whiskey. Sherlock knew it would help him relax. He didn't drink, and he didn't drink because he knew the science of it, and even if he didn't, he heard the proof of it outside his window every night: alcohol made people slow and stupid. With Sherlock's weight, complete lack of tolerance, and the fact that he hadn't eaten since lunch, that was enough alcohol to turn him into a boneless idiot.
"So," Lestrade says, as Sherlock continues through the album. It's painfully transparent. "I saw John the other day. He's moving back in, he said."
"John, I..." Sherlock started, and something in his voice made John stare back up in worry. "You must know that I would never-- not with Rosie. I understand she must be your priority. She's mine, too. I wouldn't ever--"
So he smokes, radiating displeasure as much as he can, and plans how best to send John out for Chinese when they get home.
Davis' dog comes sniffing to the door. A smart creature, that recognises a friend when she sees one, and lets Sherlock drop to his knees to scratch her neck. The dog licks a wet stripe down his neck and he feels better and worse all in the same breath.
"He was always an arrogant bugger, just as bad as he seems in the news. Didn't quite seem to figure the difference between asking questions and showing off-- and there were so many rumors about him at the time, but his grades in my class at least always backed it up, so I suppose I can't complain..."
Sherlock smiles slightly back against his mouth. He hates them too. He hates what they did to him and he
They had resettled back in the kitchen, this time in adjacent chairs, and close enough to touch. Sherlock's long, elegant arm was flat along the table, his finger splayed, as if daring John to touch. Except it wasn't a dare, because John
"That man was a sodding idiot. You did more than anyone else there and you didn't even have to say a single word. You are
Rosie made a babbling sound again, her face still warm and soft against his neck. She tugged a second time on his hair and John squeezed his eyes shut and made himself breathe.
It had taken a while, for the lighthearted teasing to turn into mocking. And it had taken John even longer to realise it for what it was. But that was what it had been. Mocking. Mocking the blog, mocking the cases, mocking Sherlock. Once or twice, even right in front of him, and with John in the room. But Sherlock, after being so used to Anderson and Donovan brazenly calling him a freak right there to an audience of the world at crime scenes, hadn't quite picked up on it; John had seen it on his face at the time. Mary had once commented that John was perfectly prepared for a newborn to be screaming and snotting all over him at the slightest inconvenience, but that at least
He dropped his face into the crook of Sherlock's neck, one hand still rubbing his other shoulder, very, very gently. It was an odd sensation: too much tactile stimuli to properly translate. Sherlock had hated it, at first, but he was learning to appreciate it for what it was.
Eventually the vomiting slowed until all Sherlock was coughing up was bitter stomach acid and even that faded until it was only dry gags that tore at his already sore throat. He stayed hunched over the bin, breathing heavily and thoroughly despising himself.
John had decided to invite her out to dinner with him and had managed to convince Sherlock to come as well. It was hard enough to get the haughty detective to agree to eat, much less to eat while meeting a new person but somehow John had managed. John had expected Sherlock to be his usual unbearable self throughout the night though surprisingly he’d put on his best behavior. John felt a smile form on his face as he remembered how Sherlock had actually complimented Harry’s outfit upon first greeting.
Eventually he begins to get unstuck. He hadn’t had the mental capacity to put himself back in his pants earlier and his now limp penis has caught a bit of a chill. His legs are sore and stiff as he moves and although he knows it will only make the guilt in him grow and fizzle he directs himself toward the room on the main floor. He falls into the bed and the faint, rapidly fading scent of Sherlock wafts up from the sheets and infuses him with such overwhelming sadness and comfort that before he knows it his chest is heaving with sobs and his ribcage hurts from gasping for air. He is positively wailing. Never before has John Watson felt so not-himself, so out of place in his own skin. He feels like he isn’t even John Watson anymore. He had thought at times that it felt like he had a parasite in his brain, something that had just latched on and drained him of life but now he knew the truth. Now he knew that he didn’t have some make-believe parasite, he
He heads into the GP consultation office where Sarah is currently talking to a patient. He’s in his late forties and already in the hospital gown get up. He’s sitting on the examination table and seemingly getting debriefed, though Sarah’s chatter dies when John opens the door.
As he went about the flat doing last minute tidying that he had missed the first time around he decided he would pay Mrs. Hudson a visit tomorrow.
“Mm-hmm. They’re good friends with my parents.” John nodded and moved to speak again but was suddenly assaulted with a memory.
Like most difficult things in his life he decides to ignore the change in atmosphere in the room and divert the subject.
“I’m sorry I worried you,” he offers, voice full of contriteness. “I- well, it’s been… difficult. I’ve never been the best at these things.”
“Oh.” She said quietly, dipping her head down low. “Thank you.” She lifted her head back up and looked in his eyes with a new found determination that reminded him of when she first introduced herself on the train. “You look handsome. I think you’re the only man I’ve ever seen successfully pull of that colour jumper.” Her smile is mischievous now, clearly teasing and John finds himself grinning in turn. His jumper is indeed a unique colour, sort of an odd mesh between purple and dark green. Sherlock had hated the thing, damn near burnt it on a Bunsen burner once while John had been at the clinic, luckily John had come home just in time to snatch it off the flame.
“Don’t worry, that was… nice. Yeah. That was a really nice thing to offer. It was just me really, I’m not use to people actually
“Ohhh… This definitely isn’t your first time is it? Did your little pet teach you how to do this?” Oh God. Why did he have to bring up John? An image of John actually leading through a blowjob nearly made him whimper, though thankfully he muffled it in time. “Ah! Oh… forget the detective thing, this should be your fulltime job instead…” All of a sudden Moriarty’s fingers tightened up and yanked Sherlocks head forward, Sherlock gave one last hard suck and ignored the tears forming in his eyes from the tugging on his hair and the prick being crammed down his throat. A hot flood of come ran down his throat and Moriarty’s cock pulsed madly on his tongue. The salty taste filled his mouth and the musky smell of sex engulfed his nose until all he could smell or taste was Moriarty. He was desperate to pull away from the taste and the feel of the slick come sliding down his throat but he seemed to come forever. Finally, the hold on his hair loosened and the hand pulled away allowing him to yank himself back and retch onto the concrete beside him.
John is confused. He doesn’t know what he could have done to scare her off so fast. The first thought that comes to mind is that she got put off by his scar but when he looks down at himself he remembers they had both managed to stay (nearly) fully clothed up ‘till now. What could he have done? Or said?
. "And cocaine is a shortcut. It will do nothing for you. I also know that while my opinions will always be completely discounted, you are aware that John shares this particular one. There is nothing to be gained by doing this to yourself, and nothing to be gained by doing it to him, either."
John quirked an eyebrow when Sherlock looked at him. "Remember?" he prodded, and now he actually looked
Oscar laughed. He laughed out loud, so suddenly and so loudly that Sherlock flinched back. Usually, when people laughed, it was at him, and it was only the beginning of something much worse. But all Oscar did was finally,
His room had spent a week as a bloody florist shop before John took to redirecting all such deliveries to the nurse's station. "Those files were
One evening after the transfer, upon which John truly has moved into Sherlock's room for all intents and purposes and that is where he intends to stay, John takes a walk around the hospital. A sorely needed walk to stretch muscles that feel like they're about to cramp and die if he spends one more night just
As horrible as that relationship had been, and as miserable as it had clearly made him, it was safe. It was safe because he knew how he'd be treated, and how it would hurt, and he knew he'd survive it because he'd survived it before.
"I'm going to move your arm now," he promises, and he does, keeping the limb as still as possible as he guides it out from behind Sherlock's back. A whimper catches in Sherlock's throat, high pitched before it cracks, and John rubs the inside of his wrist. "Shh, shh, there we go. I know it hurts, just breathe. Deep breath, now." Sherlock's breaths hitch, and it's impossible to say if he was trying to follow the instruction or not. "There you go. You're doing so well, Sherlock. That's it. Just stay still for me..."
using again, it was directly because he'd been forced against the man who was the reason he'd started using drugs in the first place. He needed support, not being thrown out on the fucking street.
Sherlock who didn't do relationships at all, Sherlock who might just say yes to him anyway because John was starting to see that there really was nothing he could ask that Sherlock would say no to...
"And this is Dr. Wilson's lab, but I think I overheard him mention he wasn't looking for any new students, this coming term... we can just--"
"Ah," Francis sighs, the confusion fading. "Well, I can hardly be insulted, Scott-- I'd find a dog easier to talk to than a therapist as well." He allows for another weighty pause, observing Sherlock very closely. "Do you think it might help you, if we had a dog here? Animal therapy is a supported practice, and can be very productive for some patients."
"I would really rather not," he said at last. His voice was vanishingly small, disappeared into John's shirt.
He's careful, as he removes the handcuffs. Careful to hold Sherlock's still recuperating arm in place, careful not to throw the fucking things to clatter noisily against the floor, careful to talk him through it, keeping his voice confident, reassuring, and calm. Above all, John is careful to watch Sherlock's wet face, searching for some sign that this is too much for him, or that what John is doing is scaring him, but there is nothing there. There is
have them, no matter how vehemently he denies that they are nothing more than the fly in the ointment for the stupid-- they're stuck in his rat nest of a head. John can vent to any number of his friends, many of whom care about Sherlock too and are worried about him. Sherlock has nothing. Sherlock has no one.
John waited for another minute, his arms slung tightly around Sherlock's back. Sherlock stayed against him, his face hidden and his fingers clinging to his jumper, and once again John let him just stay there. Unmoving and pale and
Sherlock still stood just inside the restaurant, surrounded by gentle piano music and waiters in tuxedos and London's idiotic upper class, and felt just a little bit like he was going to throw up.
, and John is so overjoyed and relived and grateful he could burst. But on the other, Mycroft is also the reason that Sherlock is panting in the corner as he shakes and whines in his throat and tears his hair out, and that means it's time for him to go.
But the discussion was already closed. John was back to reading through the fat file, tracing the words with a pen, in a silence that very much demanded that Sherlock get moving. And if he did not get moving, there was still a crumpled paper ball under his hand, primed and ready to be thrown.
But it was too late. The seed had been planted, and now Sherlock was sitting there, looking downtrodden and bruised and thoroughly unhappy, and asking him about romantic entanglement and ordinary and... happiness.
John all but stomped across the room, stepping over the books left on the floor in Mycroft's search and without regard for the still semi-full tea cup left behind. "I'm going to find Sherlock," he snapped, hauling his jacket up from the sofa. "I don't care if you come with me or sit here and dust the kitchen table, Mycroft. I'm going. He--" John zipped his jacket up, rage swelling in his throat, then swiveled back around only one step on to the door. "What the hell is wrong with him?! Why would he
He was supposed to be irritated, he was supposed to be threatening to leave his phone at home next time he had a date, he was supposed to be threatening to hide his cigarettes and pay the city off to not sell him anymore.
"You want to section Sherlock," he says numbly. Next to him, Sherlock stiffens, confirming the horrible truth of the words without any need for it from Mycroft himself. "Because Sherlock refuses to go of his own accord."
His tired eyes passed straight over Sherlock as if he was little more than an inanimate object, lounging long and lazy on the sofa, and he thudded over instead to sink straight into his chair.
He did look less distressed than before, but only just. And John still couldn't quite shake the feeling that something was
They pulled up to Cambridge with a very quiet Sherlock in tow. John and Greg were left to make casual conversation on the way, while the genius man of the hour just sat there next to John, taking up space and not much else. He occupied his time with glaring silently straight out the window, and ignoring the rest of existence.
He sets about helping Sherlock to keep his balance as he switches from the bed to the wheelchair. Because Sherlock's room is on the third floor, and he's still unsteady on his feet and his arm in a sling, and he can't speak to argue against it and John has done his best to not give him a choice. Sherlock is all bone and ice cold as he shuffles with John, looking unhappy and sullen and
"...Just an icepack," he said slowly, underneath Sherlock's high, panting breaths. He set it down on the table between them, a neutral space, and then sat back, to allow Sherlock's ball to remain undisturbed. "For your face, lad."
He threw his head back and groaned again, covering his face with his hand, and suddenly there was a hole in the dam. "John. For the last time:
John rolled his eyes, though he looked so incredibly fond throughout it, Sherlock could hardly bring himself to mind. "One of us needs to go home, you berk," he repeated. "To water Milgram. We've been here since this morning."
John's fingers dig into him again, scrabbling from his shoulders to his back to his hair, scratching between expanses of skin and angry scars without regard for the difference, and that, that is perfect too, and when Sherlock sucks one of his legs kicks to tangle in his and this is amazing. It's sweaty and messy and Sherlock's own transport is tempting to fray apart at the seams, and it. is.
"That wasn't her fault," he insisted. A very limp and obligatory defense of the woman he'd been supposed to love
His stomach and chest remain a detailed canvas of charcoaled skin and tell the story of a carcass for a butcher. They'd been mostly shallow cuts, excruciatingly careful not to bleed too deeply or cut a chunk of liver or lung that he'd need to talk, and the patterns that spill between his ribs are as uninspired as they are boring. There's one particular patch of skin that is electric burns doused in acid, and he's loved to catalogue the healing as much as John has hated to acknowledge its existence. His back is much the same, whip marks that intersperse with a galaxy of knife punctures and little hills of cigarette burns and stripes of acid. The acid in particular had been a favorite... low concentrations of weak acid do not dissolve skin or bone, contrary to popular belief. They simply hurt. An incredible amount, when the ideal solution is found. They hurt an even more incredible amount when doused onto already open wounds.
broken, of course. He was not. But there were pieces of him that had been hurt, and that needed looking after. Pieces that he'd neglected until now, and that would hurt him again if he let them.
He has been a doctor for him at all hours of the night and days of the week, and woken up through nightmares with him, and been
Sitting here, touching Sherlock's face in the intimacy of his kitchen, without a scar staring him in the face every time that he looked at him, was going to feel very, very different.
Then, Mycroft is out the door, and John is left standing alone at the foot of the stairs. The morning is not even an hour old, and already, he feels worse than he has all week.
John's stomach goes cold, and his heart is suddenly thundering so loudly in his ears he can barely think.
Sherlock didn't pay much mind to his mail. Bills were deducted from his accounts without him needing to attend to them, and everything else, well, why would he care? If it was something truly deserving of attention, then they could manage to write into the blog or stop by the flat in person. Potential cases, junk mail,
Sherlock is dressed very particularly for the outing. He is missing the trademark coat and hat, and has wriggled instead into the one pair of jeans that he owns, and a slightly itchy, grey jumper knitted for him by Mrs. Hudson. He doesn't want to be recognised today, by reporters or by anyone else, and looking like anything less than himself is as close to undercover as he can currently get.
But Mrs. Hudson only shook her head again, giving a stack of papers on the desk an organisational shake. A shake in which she came perilously close to Milgram. "After all that I hear John going on about? This thing sounds more work-intensive than a puppy, somedays!"
A short moment passed in silence. He did not go on. No elaboration, no explanation. Just that short, cryptic
Sherlock smiled slightly again, ducking his head. "Perhaps." He pulled his hands apart to touch John's again, pulling it closer so he could see the state of his knuckles. Red, scraped, and bruised. Not enough, in John's mind. Not remotely enough. "It ruptured his fantasy, I think. It was the turning point that happened with every student of his before-- the moment when they stopped being able to meet his expectations, and he realised his special star was about to let him down. It was what happened to Victor. I'd just been conceited enough to think I was special enough that it wouldn't happen to me."
Sherlock, somehow, looked even more severely unamused than before. His face was white and angry, almost affronted, and he wrapped a second arm around his stomach. "Everybody else," he repeated, voice strained. "So feeling like this is normal."
Sherlock's head jerked up again, all pretense at sleep discarded in an instant. He stared at John with his usual laser focus and with the man's such close proximity, John could tell that he'd all but stopped breathing.
Sherlock. That's it. No more drugs, no more using yourself as bait for a serial killer, no more trying to get yourself killed because you think it'll help me. If you really need a reason then do it for me if you can't do it for yourself, but... not because of Mary. She didn't do anything but start to pay you back for the day she shot you."
But John is a very good doctor, and one of the only Sherlock Holmes Experts in the world over, and so that's all he needs to.
Sherlock grumbled something, his voice edging just on incoherent, then just moaned. "Snogged him. Thn told him he was a terrible scientist and d'sgusting excuse fr a human being. Then I spat in his soup. Then I left."
His original plan had been to take the call, and go. Now he couldn't even answer it. Now he just stood there, watching
been, lately?" he started, sting of jealousy tempered into full-blown disgust. "I won't deny that I've not been fair to Sherlock, but all
He gives Sherlock a few more seconds to catch his breath, the detective still refusing to meet his eyes. He sits with him and waits, allowing the tight squeeze of Sherlock's fingers in his hand.
"For the good of my business," Davis starts, his words a slow, almost lazy drawl, "because it's not all that economical a model for my repeat customers to off themselves." He pauses, looking over Sherlock with a very pointed, direct gaze. "I'm obligated to remind you to measure your doses carefully. Especially if it's been a while since you've used-"
It actually wasn't all that unusual. Sherlock could be very picky about the cases and clients he took on, turning them down for the stunningly superficial and hilariously insignificant (John's favorite remained the deadpan
"I know, love," John sighed. His fingers combed gently through his hair and he nudged gently again, trying to keep the bandages and the blood turned safely away from his shirt.
that, that's the bloody problem. If he'd cooperate with one it could actually do some good, but there's no point in forcing him to see one. He's too smart for it to ever do any good if he doesn't want it to. He's got to actually be willing to talk to one." John stops, realising what he just said, and groans. "You know what I mean."
He'd tried as hard as he could and pushed himself too far and John wants nothing more than to stay up here and hold him and shush him down and make him another cup of tea. And to throw Mycroft down the stairs.
John has been by his side for days, keeping watch on his ever fluctuating and precarious vitals, feeding him ice chips when he's delirious and semi-conscious, mopping up the sweat from his bloody brow. And
"...I don't know." He swallowed again. Suddenly, it felt like he was back on very thin ice. "I thought you weren't interested in anybody."
It's a suffocating dust, every graceful pad of Sherlock's footsteps grinding in his ears, every breath resoundingly loud because there's
But that DVD was not the first time she had nearly gotten Sherlock killed. It wasn't even the first time Mary had
John straightens after a minute passes, and Sherlock remains upset. He goes to Sherlock's IV, increasing the flow of the sedative just a tick. They're already trying to wean him off opioids; John wants him to sleep through as much of the withdrawal and cravings as he can, and Mycroft is in full agreement. But if it's a choice between aggravating his distress right now, when he's in pain and scared and flinching away from John's hand with his bruised face looking so
He'd rather do without it, actually. Or at least John have waited until they got back to the warmth of Mycroft's bloody interfering car.
Sherlock was right. John was bored. And maybe John wasn't about to start shooting the walls and asking for a nice murder, but... he wasn't exactly going to say no to one, either.
John would be grateful for it, if not for the rage steadily building behind his eyes that's so violent he can barely even think.
"That's right," John said evenly back. "It's been how many years, since he was a student here? Fifteen years? And yet when you heard we'd be on campus today, your first instinct was still to run off up here to try and mock him."
"I will be your consultant, if you need it. And you do. I've read your write-up for the last case we took concerning graduate-level chemistry and it was, as you say,
hating it, because he wants Sherlock to be comfortable, doesn't he? He certainly doesn't want the opposite. He wants Sherlock to be happy. And by all appearances, that is what he is. He bounces around a crime scene, deducing as easily as ever, and John is the only one to have a problem with it.
There's no more he can do now, not without stripping him out of his coat and shirt, and he can't do that, not with Sherlock like this. He holds the limb absolutely still and rubs his shoulder and oh,
He breathes in sharply and his fingers tangle in his hair, tugging him away just enough to see his eyes in the dark. "You're sure?"
"Yes, but that doesn't matter to you, does it? You're brilliant. You probably know it better than everyone taking the course right now. Yeah?" Oscar's hand trailed along his shoulder again, moving from its usual position to cup the side of his neck instead. "It is usually a position for graduate students, yes, but we make exceptions, sometimes. And you're special, Sherlock. I just want to make sure that you're treated with with the attention that someone as special as you deserves."
"I did say comparatively. No, Watson, we do not eat our stuffed animals. But no, I meant--" His voice dropped even lower and he hunched a bit into himself, still folded up on the floor. John placed the cup of tea in the chair next to him, and Sherlock ignored it completely. "He has always been much more capable at reading and accurately responding to social cues than me. He thinks they are a waste of time, but he is at least capable of it, when the situation demands. It's why he recognised Oscar for what he was and I did not."
His bright eyes flicked away, looking anywhere but at John. He fiddled with his tea and shifted in his chair, the line of his jaw jumping, and John had seen him look like that far too many times these past few days for it to be okay. He resolved, right then and there, that one of the things he was going to do was make Sherlock realise he never had cause to feel that uncomfortable or worried again.
John stands there, and begins to systematically and affectionately record every single last thing about this moment, no matter how small. To take every
"That's not-- he's... it's not that simple, Mycroft! It's his decision to make! And not--" John can barely find the words, caught between his own anger and his own hurt and the impossibility at discussing this in front of Sherlock. "You're asking him about
But John isn't quite observant enough to notice, and instead just continues on his nonsense mission to rally Sherlock, as if his appearance here hadn't done the whole job already. "You'll be home before Christmas," he assures, nudging his hand again. "Believe it or not. And I'll be nice, this year. Won't even make you go to a party." Then he stops, and his own smiles starts to fall. "...To be honest, I don't think I'll want much to do with people either, this time around."
Oscar kissed him again, his two fingers rubbing a little lower, first underneath his belt, then his pants. Sherlock tried very hard to focus on the last column of the article.
"Git," John mutters. He has to fight it past the lump in his throat and it comes out weak and watery, the effect utterly ruined. Sherlock looks away. "You knew all the tests they were doing were a waste of time, didn't you? And you let them make fools of themselves anyway. Bet you enjoyed the spotlight, at least?"
It was established in 2012 that Sherlock Holmes has an orbit, and John is his star. Texting Mycroft probably would've made that evening go infinitely easier than it had, yes- and?
Was this karma? Sherlock derided the very existence of the so ridiculously fanciful, and determinably unprovable, but- what other answer was there? He was a good person. By... some very strict, limited definition but- still! A good person! He solved crimes for the incompetent; he didn't deserve this!
"I agree," she assured again, nodding. "He was trying to help you. He was genuinely trying to help you, with only your welfare and happiness in mind... and now," she finished pointedly, looking at him. "As a direct result of those actions, you are unhappy, self-loathing, and guilt-ridden."
too short for the beanpole that he was but swallowing up his shoulders and chest anyway, because he was rail-thin. His muddy hair fell over his eyes and his hanging head, knotted with leaves and twigs-- perhaps he'd slept in a park-- and his angular face, with hollow cheeks and heavy eyes, was flushed with the heat of a high.
and he wasn't. He never had been and he never would be. And if this was what it was, he didn't want to be.
is it not? And this is not the first time that you've expressed how worried you are about how John sees you. Your difficulties and anxiety about recovering your voice are not something you can separate that easily from your anxiety concerning John. The two are inextricably linked." He tilts his head, watching Sherlock in a way that is coming to remind him of John. "You need to trust him, Scott."
For several seconds, it was just that. Sherlock, breathing heavily into his hands, hiding his face and very clearly one wrong move away from lashing out. And Greg--
He clutches it anyway, because it's warm and his hands are cold and it gives him something to keep his fingers still. He clutches it and sits just so, so that his face is hidden behind the file, and that's that. He sits there with his coffee and his case file, safely alone in the office with only Lestrade as company. Lestrade himself goes back immediately to his own paperwork at his desk, and ceases to pay him any mind. It's absolutely perfect. Once again, Sherlock could not ask for a more ideal scenario.
It's quiet for several moments again. John is standing military-straight and silent, his hands curling into fists at the counter, breaths a measured, angry pace. "Handle the problem," he repeats flatly. "You mean kill Magnussen."
He settled in the seat next to his mad genius, grinning and the knot in his stomach loosened for the first time in a week, and knew that this was going to go well.
Sherlock has not written, since-- since. It had made being discharged from hospital an ordeal, because when he had been unable to vocally answer his attending's questions, they had tried to get him to write the answers, instead. He hadn't been able to do it.
He cut himself off to inhale through gritted teeth, squeezing his eyes shut. Mycroft had already told him why. He hadn't been able to do anything without Sherlock's cooperation. He hadn't had Sherlock's cooperation. Mycroft had been in the exact same position back then that John was in today.
John's face twitches, a little, some of that light going dim, and Sherlock waves it off without the slightest bit of patience for it. "Baker Street, I mean. You moved back in, and now your bed is currently collecting dust."
Lestrade hovered uncomfortably in the doorway, watching in silence as John just collapsed into his chair. Sherlock flopped himself over the sofa with little more than an eye roll, and molded himself into the cushions with no intention to ever leave again. He could still smell the faintest hint of ash from the explosion earlier that week. Mycroft's
At last, Greg decided the only move that would be wise was to just give Sherlock a few moments on his own. He backtracked several step to leave the genius slumped down on his couch, his arms wrapped around himself and his head down, knobby fingers clenched so hard into his threadbare shirt and still trembling. He left the lights off and started to boil the water for tea, something herbal, something non-caffeinated for this time of night, trying not to think too hard about what could've put Sherlock in this state.
He got kissed again, one more time, and then John pulled gently back, his hands tracing through his hair. He smiled at Sherlock, flushed and just a bit breathless. "Come downstairs with me?"
He strums an out of tune minor third, plucking the two strings together with sore fingertips. It resonates just next to his ear, like the chime of a clock bell.
Next to him, Sherlock, still, does not react at all. He sits there, his fingers curled tightly and his sharp eyes narrowed, staring down at the files. He refuses to react in any way whatsoever.
