I’m glad you enjoyed the bread, I still wasn’t one hundred percent happy with it, but it was my best effort.
“Think about it. It would never work. He couldn’t introduce me to his loved ones as anything but a friend, and of course, I’ve already screwed that up. Chuck would take one look at me and I’d be on the outs. He couldn’t bring me home for holidays. His whole family would probably disown him, he practically said that’s what happened to his brother. Even if he
amount of incest porn between Jed and Bast, not that he could really blame them. The writers hadn’t provided their characters with any meaningful relationships aside from each other. Maybe if they were more respectful of the female characters that wafted in and out of the scripts, people could find something else to ‘ship.’
“You don’t know how Hell works!” Castiel burst out, in a rare show of emotion from Ramiel. “Did you think you’d be able to waltz in there and take your father’s soul, maybe stop by the ‘gift shop’ on your way out?” There were Castiel’s finger quotes. “All you were doing was fighting to be allowed through the gate. There were no guarantees beyond that. And even if you
Dean growled low in his throat as he automatically complied, crawling into the room on his hands and knees. “Bastard,” he hissed under his breath through clenched teeth.
“Oh, yeah?” said Dean, lifting his brows in sudden inspiration. He held up his first finger, indicating that Cas should wait. “Unpack your ‘provisions.’ I’ll be right back.” And he disappeared into the bedroom.
“Did you want to shoot something?” asked Dean, turning around as he heard the click of the door locking. His stomach dropped when he saw Cas holding a paper bag, his eyes beginning to filament with red.
Dean grinned as he and Sam also lifted their drinks, touching them together in a toast. Slowly, his stomach was untying itself. “I’m really happy, dad.”
Cas was still pinching and teasing Dean’s nipples as he jerked him off and licked and sucked his neck. All the stimulation was driving him crazy and making it more and more difficult to remain silent and still. He braced his hands on the dividing wall in front of him, struggling to keep his breathing even.
“I won’t,” said Dean, speaking quickly when Castiel opened his mouth to argue, “let me prove it to you.”
He did, grabbing at his sheets with his other hand. He pumped his fingers, keeping his eyes closed so he could pretend it was his alpha making him come apart, praising him and telling him how beautiful he was as he soared closer and closer to orgasm.
“Ah. You’re here,” said a low, rough voice that tripped up Dean’s spine like fur being rubbed the wrong way. The man with the tone like velvet over gravel stood up from his desk where he’d been working and approached. “A pleasure to meet you. I’m Castiel Novak.”
Sitting down beside him, Castiel also began to get dressed, pulling on his socks and picking up his trousers from the pile. “That sounds serious.”
“We met at the Cooper Gallery. You don’t remember?” He tilted his head so the light from the nearby streetlamp glanced off his high cheekbone. “Or maybe… you just can’t see my face from this distance.”
“You’re asking a lot of questions,” said Cas, leading him over to a closed-in part of the set that had four walls.
“I really don’t know,” said Rami, lifting his brows slightly. “I have no comparison for what this feeling is. By the time I realized what I felt, it had been a part of me for so long that… it simply
“I’ve learned so much so quickly, thanks to you,” Dean began. “Not just about you, but about myself, and alphas and omegas. I had so many perceptions about the world that were skewed. So many things I wanted to experience but had never allowed myself to even think about. Because of you, I learned that it’s okay to feel and to express those feelings and that there are people who won’t judge me for them. And that means so much to me. With you, I can be my most honest, authentic self, and you
“I don’t know why you were so indecisive over the mangos,” Castiel was saying to Jack as they came up the sidewalk, carrying bags of produce. “They all felt ripe to me.”
“Dean!” Cas exclaimed happily, seeing him standing outside The Piehole’s front door. Dean loved how Castiel always smiled whenever he saw him. “What are you doing out here?” he asked. His brows drew together slightly as he noticed the re-opening sign. “What’s this?”
“Come whenever you like,” said Cas right before going back down, taking Dean all the way to the root and making him writhe.
“That’s the idea.” He popped up on his toes and rocked back. “Kind of a shame to ugly up that pretty face, though.”
All of a sudden, the bride came bursting in from the direction of the chapel. Her hair and makeup were flawless, but she was still wearing a white robe that said ‘bride’ in rhinestones across the back. Dean wondered if it was something a bridesmaid had gotten her. Following her was a diminutive, older Asian woman, her hair perfectly coifed, wearing a plum colored skirt suit, the kind of thing Dean would expect a First Lady to wear. Her mouth was pinched and her shrewd eyes followed the bride’s every move. ‘Ah,’ thought Dean. ‘This must be the Mother In Law. Capital M-I-L.’
He laid back against the pillows and drew his knees up slightly. Castiel poured a generous amount in his hand, focusing on his first finger. He took a deep, shaky breath before reaching for Dean with his free hand, lacing their fingers together. Dean nodded, then gasped as Cas touched his rim for the first time. He’d played with himself numerous times, but this was new, and it was
“I forgive your expletive, my son, but do try to rein it in while in God’s house,” said the priest. “So, this is a romance issue you’re experiencing. I’m not sure I’m the right person to ask, but I can certainly offer my own perspective.”
It required Dean to remain very deliberately still and didn’t allow him to fuck himself backward onto his daddy’s cock. He just had to let himself be taken, agonizingly slow, while their pups took what they needed. The scent of his arousal was thick in the air and slick gushed out around Castiel’s dick on every inward thrust.
“I’m me,” said Azrael. “But I know what you mean. I don’t want prayers or sacrifice, I’m not going to be directly hands-on, but I’ll be… present. I’ll be in every drop of rain, in every mote of dust, to influence the world toward good. All anyone has to do is believe in that goodness and it will be there, waiting for them to embrace it. And… I think I’m pretty close as this. Plus, I’ll have you to help me.”
Instincts running hot, he growled at Luce, eyes fairly sparking with deep gold. His fingers contorted into claw-like shapes at his sides as he darted in front of Sam and ordered the alpha to, “Back off!”
“It’s majorly fucking serious. I’m going to meet his family when we finish college in Spring. Be introduced to his pack head, the whole shebang.”
Dean woke up with a start sometime later, automatically checking the time, relaxing back down when he saw it had only been a couple of hours. They didn’t have to leave for work just yet; they could stay in bed for a little before they needed to get ready.
“I am,” said Dean, and he took another bite of his sandwich as he contemplated whether or not they should discuss this now. This was definitely a conversation to be had in private. But they were fairly isolated from the rest of the crew at the moment, no one would be listening in as long as they kept their voices down.
“M’kay.” Dean was good with just about anything at that point. His whole body hummed with bliss and he drifted off smiling gently to himself.
Dean shook as Castiel entered him in one swift thrust, and he called out, not because it hurt, but because it felt so right. His alpha had come home. It almost brought tears to his eyes, but he held them back. There had been way too much crying lately. This was a time to rejoice.
DoorDash bill.” He was kind of kidding, but Cas just winked at him in the most over-exaggerated way that only he could make appear sincere.
“Yes, daddy,” he said, sighing with gratitude. “I had so much going on in my head, it was such a relief to let it all go.”
When he was able to take a deep breath and open his eyes, tears leaked out of the corners, but he didn’t care. He looked up at Cas and saw matching tears, but he almost missed them because of how brightly he was smiling.
“You… I can’t believe you got him to admit all that,” he said. He released a shaky breath he wasn’t aware he’d been holding. “So… nothing really happened.”
Guilt mounting by the moment, Dean went into his attached kitchen area and put a mug of water into the microwave to heat it up faster while he rooted around in his pantry cupboards. “I didn’t mean that you shouldn’t say something when you’re honestly sick,” he called into the living room, preparing the mug. “Only that you should suck it up if you’re not feeling well because of something preventable, like a late night.” He returned to the couch with the mug and a bottle of honey, the latter he placed on the coffee table, the former he handed to Castiel. “Is this why you’ve been avoiding me?”
“You should feel pretty special, Castiel,” said Sam, who had seemingly recovered from his bite of spicy pie. After putting his empty milk glass in the sink, he headed back to the stand mixer where he’d previously been working prior to their guest’s arrival. “Dean never shares his recipes with anyone outside the family.”
“Uh, yeah,” said Dean. Keeping his eyes on his beer bottle, focusing on the torn edge of the label, he took a deep breath. “I’ve, um, this isn’t like, public or anything yet, but… I’ve been seeing someone.”
Spreading his fingers, Dean brushed them along the tips of the feathers from the base to as far out as he could reach. Cas shivered and bared his teeth like a dog who’d just had his fur brushed the wrong way, but the sound he made was far from a growl. Then Dean brushed his fingers through the feathers, straightening them, smoothing them out. The wings flexed and shimmied, the rainbow of colors hiding in the dark feathers rippling in the light, the white tips shining like stars.
“Absolutely.” He straightened and went to the bathroom door, pointing back at Dean. “Bath for you while I get some food sorted out. We eat, then ointment, then oral payback. In that order.”
His gaze kept returning to one in particular, made of long yards of semi-sheer white chiffon that parted in the front like a curtain so his legs would show when he walked. It had the empire waist that so many of his maternity dresses had, but the bust was covered in crystals and beading, and it had fabric draping off the shoulders that would emphasize his arms.
“Lucifer Herman Novak!” To the surprise of just about everyone, the sharp voice hadn’t come from Cain, but from Colette. The petite woman stood just a few strides away with her hands on her hips. “Just what do you think you were doing?”
“It is,” he said, warmly, pressing a kiss to his ear. “You don’t have to worry about anything like this happening to you, ever. You are mine alone.”
“Vanilla…” said Cas, his voice low and dream-like. “Brown sugar. Dark chocolate. You smell sweet. Like cookies.”
“Well, that explains the drinking.” He put a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “Look, I get it. You’re lucky you’re not worse off than you are. But you need to take it easy on yourself, or it could turn into full-on rejection sickness, especially since you still work together.”
Dean was glad he’d already swallowed because there would have been a spit-take. “What?” he sputtered.
Castiel’s head fell back on a groan as Dean suckled his tip, swirling his tongue all around it and licking up all that had dripped before slowly working his way down. He used his hand to pump along the length, looking up while he bobbed up and down because he knew that Cas liked to see his eyes when Dean sucked him.
After they’d all had some appetizers based on classic pregnancy cravings like peanut butter on crackers topped with a sweet pickle garnish, it was time to start the guessing game. Dean had absolutely refused to do any of the old-fashioned gender tests that involved pee, and there were a
“Absolutely not,” said Castiel, firmly, with a growl in the back of his throat. He tightened his grasp around Dean’s waist, holding him closer to his chest. “I am my Beloved’s and my Beloved is mine. Period. I. Do
Dean kissed him again. He didn’t think he would ever get tired of it. Leaning over to his bedside table, he opened the drawer and removed a few things. First, a condom in its foil wrapper, which he held up and gave to Cas.
With a growl, Cas surged forward, burying himself to the hilt, and Dean screamed out his pleasure, his back arching away from the couch. The alpha slammed into him, chasing their orgasms relentlessly. His knot was already beginning to grow, having done such a thorough job at working them both up. Dean’s own dick was practically twitching like a ticking clock, leaving a small pool of pre-come on his abdomen, signaling that his release was not far off.
It was only a little late when they finally finished shooting the majority of the fight scene. For all the issues they’d endured, Zeddmore seemed happy with the takes they’d gotten and Dean couldn’t wait to see the final product with the CGI. He had a spring in his step, despite the long hours and slightly sore muscles, as he went back to his trailer to get changed out of wardrobe. It had been a while since he’d gotten to film a long fight scene like this, and it made him wonder if this was what Mandy Patinkin had felt like filming
“Then get ready for bed. You’ll get your nighttime knot and if you manage not to come, you’ll get a reward in the morning. Come and it’ll be a punishment instead.”
Cupping Dean’s face in his hands, Cas tilted it back down. “Then I am yours. Who we are to each other belongs to no one else. The past is the past. You are my future.”
Cas drove them both down there, but Dean asked him to wait in the car since Sam had only asked for him. It would look strange for Cas to be there if he had nothing to do with whatever was the problem.
He looked up as he laved the underside with his tongue and rubbed the slit at the head before sucking him back down. The normally loving expression he was used to from Cas was nowhere to be seen, but he forced himself to hold eye contact.
“Please stand for me, beloved,” he said, assisting Dean to his feet. Cas didn’t let go of his hands as he eased down onto his knees.
Slapping the other cheek, Cas scolded him again, “Brat.” Then he chuckled. “Ooh. I think you liked that. You squeeze me when I spank you. Is this something we should pursue in the future?”
He stepped back and allowed the alpha to follow after Aaron, who had scurried off to the makeup trailer. At least Castiel appeared appropriately chastised, if not entirely confused by his own reaction. It was not the right time for it at the moment, but Dean fully intended to have a talk with him after work. He didn’t get to pull that kind of possessive alpha bullshit after they spent
“Yes, because I knew if I told you first, everyone on your social media pages would know two seconds later,” said Cas, lifting a brow at his older brother.
Dean lifted his brows at Cas as the flirting continued. His daddy gave him a slight nod, indicating he saw the spark between them, too. If this kept up, maybe, hopefully, Sam and Gabriel wouldn’t be single for much longer. Dean had never pictured his fairly liberally-minded brother mating a dyed-in-the-wool and fully-trained albeit sassy omega, but then, this was the same Sam who’d called Dean beautiful when he’d fallen into sub-space suckling Castiel’s cock. Maybe his brother was more interested in traditional alpha-omega dynamics than he’d previously thought. Well, the same ended up being true for Dean, too.
He was just getting into the groove of rotating the baking sheets, taking out the finished pies, setting the pecan pies on racks to cool and getting the fruit glaze on top of the peach ones while the new set of unbaked pies went in – when the knock he was waiting for came at the back door. His heart ensured his feet hardly touched the ground as he hurried to let Cas in.
The following slaps continued to get harder the longer the punishment went on, but Cas did it so gradually that the pain just melted together. The steady, even rhythm of the spanking started to make his mind go hazy as all that existed was the next slap and the next. While the occasional muffled grunt had been startled out of him at first, he moaned low and even as he began to drift mentally, floating away from the pain on an ocean of white noise. Time was as nebulous as a cloud; he had no idea how long his punishment had been going on. By then Cas was hitting him very hard, but he could barely feel it. He existed outside of the pain. The tension in his body had left him and he was boneless across Castiel’s lap, just moaning and moaning, as that was all he was capable of.
Dean popped off with a gasp. “Stop ordering me around. You’re already hard, let’s get to it.” Despite that, there wasn’t a trace of the alpha’s normal vanilla scent in the air to signify arousal. Just the sharp top notes of pine that had been in the rain.
Cas brought his other hand around Dean’s back, resting between his shoulder blades, as he rocked forward, rolling Dean backward, almost far enough that his head would fall off the end of the bed. The motion made Cas thrust the rest of the way in and they called out in unison, the demon’s low moan of pleasure and Dean’s higher cry that was almost a sob. Cas kissed him again, swallowing that sound, feeding on it, as he began to move.
As Cas returned to his laptop, he kept one hand on top of Dean’s head, lazily stroking his hair while Dean closed his eyes and leaned his head against Castiel’s thigh while he nursed his alpha’s knot. He continued to come for several minutes and Dean swallowed it all down, loving the taste of honeyed almonds and the feeling of being filled in an entirely new way.
Cas slowed down, moving himself side to side and up and down with his hand. Dean exhaled slowly, consciously thinking about relaxing his muscles. As he did so, the head slipped past the ring and Dean grabbed Castiel’s arm as he groaned, the sound an odd harmony with the moan that Cas uttered. Now that the biggest part of him was past that initial barrier, it was easy to slowly sink the rest of the way in. Cas fell down to his elbows, covering Dean’s body with his own, shaking as he held him close and pressed his face against Dean’s neck.
“Here we go again!” said Dean as the two of them sprang into action. Between their efforts, they both managed to finish all one hundred pies before midnight.
When he was naked, Castiel patted the bed. “On your knees, sit on your ankles,” he said, “then lean down until your face is on the mattress.”
“No!” Dean exclaimed, a little too loudly. “I still want to stay anonymous. I’m just… it’s so embarrassing for me.” With determination not to lose to the demon, Dean bit his own tongue and focused on the pain to try and gain a modicum of clarity. “Actually, Father, I have a problem with someone at my house. His name is Cas and…” Again, Dean’s voice came out on its own, “I just want him to fuck me all the time. Ah!” He shot a furious look at Cas, who merely smiled at him. “I—I didn’t mean to say that!”
“This was one of the first places I visited when I moved here,” said Cas. “I came back whenever I needed a moment of quiet, some time to think or just decompress. I remember you told me once that I smelled like Christmas, and I was reminded of this place with all the twinkling lights.”
The house was in escrow before they had to take Sam to the airport toward the end of Winter break. Cas had shown Dean the virtual tour online and it was even more gorgeous than he’d imagined from seeing the picture of the outside. It had a huge front and backyard and a wraparound porch. Plenty of bathrooms, a spacious kitchen, huge dining room, and hardwood floors. It was close to where Cas would eventually be working with his family but also near some really good schools. It was the perfect place to raise lots of pups. Dean was growing more and more excited by the day and was constantly going over his training in his head. He was going to impress the
Though there was a third chair, Dean merely used it to house his coat and went to the cushion on the fourth side of the table, gracefully kneeling down on it, facing the chair Cas went to. Sam sat down in the chair he’d previously vacated, watching the two of them with something like wonder in his expression.
They held onto the string to keep it from moving too much and readied their pins, glancing at each other with thrilling anticipation. Even though the game had been a bunch of nonsense, this was still the moment they would find out the primary gender of their pups.
“Oh, please, don’t pressure yourself on my account. As long as Castiel is happy, that’s all I care about,” said Gabe, proving himself to be one of the good ones in the group.
The next link was to a video interview on a different website of Meg and Castiel, both wearing the clothes they had been in the other day when Cas had left to meet up with her. Apparently, they had been doing the rounds to promote the upcoming finale that night.
While Castiel prepared the champagne, Dean got his pie and a fork and sat down on the couch to eat it right out of the tin. He watched the alpha move around his small kitchen, humming to himself happily and laughing when he got the cork out without making a mess. Dean rolled his eyes. Sometimes it was so hard to remember that Cas was definitely not the ‘harmless alpha’ he made himself out to be. Not with the way he fucked. Ahem…
“No, we’re not shooting,” said Cas, setting the bag on the desk Dean was standing next to. “Please, put this on.”
Instead, the alpha dropped to one knee, bringing them face to face, and took Dean’s chin between his thumb and forefinger to force him to meet his eyes. “So rebellious. And such disrespect, calling your teacher such a thing. I’ll have to discipline you.”
Dean didn’t answer, he knew the question was rhetorical. The head of the North Dormitory, some scrawny beta guy with skin like he was still in high school, scowled at him, arms crossed over his chest. Dean matched his posture and crossed his own arms, absently noting with not a little smugness that his muscles were massive in comparison. But his green eyes looked away from the man with disinterest, just wondering when the lecture would end so he could go back to his room.
“Always. We’re in this together. We’ll put an end to this, once and for all. The only thing left is to confront Naomi. And I have an idea on how we should do it.”
He started the water in their shower, which was tiny, but they could squeeze in as long as they didn’t mind constantly touching each other. “There are other places I want to take you,” said Cas, leaning his rump against the sink while the water heated. Dean propped himself up against him with his arms around the alpha’s neck. “But most importantly, I want to go someplace where we can pick out tangible proof of our connection. A formal exchange of our intent to mate.”
I know I shouldn’t because you’re drunk and can’t make good decisions right now… but if you really were here, would you let me kiss you?
“I do,” the alpha confirmed, tracing his fingers around Dean’s waist and over his satin-covered ass for a firm squeeze. “But do you?”
, while secretly pining for you the whole time. And when you said you wanted to knot me, I lied to you when I said I didn’t want it. If you hadn’t gotten out of control, then this,” he gestured between them, “might never have happened. And I wouldn’t be so stupidly happy now.” He caressed Castiel’s face again. “I didn’t know it was possible to love someone so much.”
He sounded almost surprised, but Dean couldn’t blame him. They’d only just met and he was springing surprise group outings on him. He just wanted Castiel’s brother to feel included, that their romantic relationship wasn’t more important than a familial one.
Smiling, Dean explained, “Your family probably never went, but Plucky Pennywhistle’s is this pizza franchise for kids—well, actually, more for lazy parents. But it was like Disneyland for kids like us. Cheap, greasy pizza, an arcade that ate your quarters, a ball pit full of germs, and games that earned you tickets to win prizes.”
Despite his inner turmoil, Dean was honestly happy for Cas. He really had worked hard this season. The Ramiel character was very popular on the social media sites Dean stalked; they were calling it the rejuvenation the show desperately needed and they would almost certainly be renewed by the network, especially in the wake of all the awards. He picked up his own glass of champagne and clinked it against Castiel’s.
provide for Cas, he wanted him to have—whether it was giving him power or taking it away. It didn’t matter who was on top. “I really did a number on you, didn’t I?”
“Heh,” Sam laughed shortly. “No problem. Thanks for using your words and stuff.” His tone sobered. “Seriously. I know this wasn’t easy for you by a long shot. It’s gotta be real if you talked to me about it.”
“Heh,” Dean half-laughed, recalling his good friend from college. “Charlie would think it was named after her.” He missed her, though they were still in contact online frequently.
embarrassed,” Cas said, happily, “then saying it again, or three times, or ten or twelve times won’t be any different!”
“I know this is terribly last minute,” said the harried blonde girl sitting across the table from Dean and Sam. Her hair was coming out of her braid in wisps and the dark circles under her eyes betrayed her lack of makeup as well as sleep. “But we only just got his family’s permission to get married, now we want to do it before they change their minds.”
It was on one such shopping trip when they were out later than intended that the first snowfall began to drift down on them. “Look at that,” said Dean as he stood beneath a streetlamp, gazing up at the night sky, his breath coming out in white puffs. “It never gets old. Snowfall is always so beautiful. I know it’s just frozen rain, but… it’s kinda magical.” He looked to find Castiel staring, not at the snow, but at him, his mouth slightly parted. “What?” he asked, smiling self-consciously.
He did. Dean held up his skirt and though he knew it was unlikely that the driver could see that low using the rearview and the only way his dick would be seen was if a semi-truck drove past, his face stayed red and warm the whole time. But he smiled and enjoyed lazily kissing his alpha because inside, he reveled in the embarrassment and humiliation. Because no matter how low he was brought, he was still
Cas handed Dean out of the car in front of a black building with stone lions flanking the doors. Inside, there were rows of glass cases full of glittering jewelry, but what really drew his attention was the fact that in addition to chairs, there were velvet cushions on the floor as well. This was a place that specifically catered to old-school alphas and omegas. Dean swallowed thickly and hoped his nerves weren’t too noticeable.
Dean awoke to the smell of bacon and coffee wafting through his slightly open door. It had him on his feet before he was even really awake, making him think of those old cartoons he and Sam used to watch, where the character would float through the air following the aroma of a delicious pie. Grabbing his gray bathrobe off the back of his door, he pulled it on as he went out into the main part of the apartment. The sight awaiting him in the kitchen nearly knocked him flat.
When he just stood there looking, Dean took hold of Castiel’s wrist and brought his shaking hand to his chest. His touch was feather-light, exploring his abs and traveling up to lie flat between his pectorals.
Sam sent back almost immediately, “Wow!” and an emoji with huge eyes. Dean grinned. The thought of introducing Sam to Cas was still a nerve wracking one, but he had hope. And that was big.
“Yes,” Castiel said, chuckling. He didn’t explain further, which left the student blinking in even more confusion.
“I still don’t actually know, but he came home with bruised hands and paperwork stating that my contract with that particular talent agency was terminated. I don’t know if he had to pay penalties or if he threatened to expose their predatory practices, he just came home and told me that I don’t work for them anymore and he’d have his manager handle me for a little while longer. Sam told him his plan and dad actually liked that idea, said it was the best way to keep us both out of trouble.” He paused. “What sucks is, parties like the one I went to are still going on and will for as long as there are assholes with money and power willing to abuse them.”
Gabe handed the cake box to Cas. “Here, you set this up on the food table, I’ll drop these off with your pup-mama, then grab your laptop from your office.” Putting his sunglasses on top of his head, he blew a kiss at Dean as he left the balloons in his care. “Hello, sweet thing, you’re looking radiant. You handle these, BRB.” As quickly as he’d come in, he hurried out, heading for Castiel’s office.
‘Favorably’ was definitely a matter of opinion. For some hare-brained reason he couldn’t fathom, Dean found himself asking, “Like, what kind of rules?”
The implication that Cas wanted Sam to be an active part of their life squeezed Dean’s heart. It meant so much to him.
He wiggled to feel the plug move. “Feels so good, daddy,” he said, tilting his head back. “So cold.”
“Beautiful,” the prince repeated, his eyes dark as he lifted his face to look at the wing. “Sooner or later you would see it as I do. A curse. And you would ask to be assigned a new duty. One where you could forget about me.”
It was easy to remember the first time he’d ever seen him, he doubted he would ever forget. Five months after he and Sam had opened the bar, they’d had to strike a deal with the Devil (Dean’s private name for their wealthy investor, Crowley) in order to save it from going under. It had always been their dream to start up a family business and they’d each quit lucrative careers (Dean as a mechanic, Sam as a lawyer) to open Winchester Bros. It had taken every penny of their life savings to do it, they just couldn’t give up so soon.
“I want to fuck you and make you scream, make you come on my knot.” He panted then tilted his head back, baring his throat, whining pitifully. “Please, Dean, I can’t hold back much longer…”
“To be fair,” Dean continued, looking at Cain, “I kinda thought pups were implied in the whole mating deal. Cas made it sound like it was important to your family.”
He gave Gabriel a hug that the oven costume made awkward. “I love you, Gabe, thank you so much,” he said. “But we’re still not naming you as godfather.”
The alpha tugged on his hand, bringing him in for a quick kiss. “That’s because you’re my good boy. And my good boy knows what to call me.”
“Like… when someone tells you that you’ve done something unforgiveable, it doesn’t mean you can’t be forgiven. You don’t need someone’s permission to forgive yourself. Or you might find you never really needed forgiveness in the first place. It’s all about perspective.”
He sighed. “I was upset. I feel stupid now, but last night it seemed like a really good idea to just not think for a while.”
The angels didn’t want Rami to leave obviously, he had to fight his way out of Heaven in order to get to Bast and warn him not to do it, but he arrived too late, bursting onto the scene just as Bast found Lilith and fired the Colt. Rami reached for him, clutching Bast to his chest as he stared in horror at what he’d done.
“Do you ever think about… you know.” He stuck his tongue into his cheek to indicate what sexual act he meant, waited for Castiel’s wide-eyed response, then switched to, “Kissing him?”
Actually, Cas had informed Dean after meeting Garth the first time that he had the imprint of a lupine shifter, which would explain his constant allergies and skinny frame. Dean wouldn’t have pegged Bess as anything more than human, but that was the new world he lived in. The supernatural was everywhere.
They went in on Mike’s side of the club, called The Pearly Gate. The interior was bright and white with lots of gold. The dance floor shifted in the colors of the sky. Stars hung from the ceiling and twinkled amid swaths of fairy lights. There were tables and stools, but instead of couches, there were huge, fluffy beanbags that resembled clouds and somehow, they made it look classy. The VIP section was fully enclosed with excellent sound-proofing to allow the solo harpist to be heard over the thumping beat of the club music coming from both sides. The servers wore sheer, diaphanous toga-like gowns and had little halo headbands. The bouncer at the door even wore a badge declaring him St Peter.
The alpha held up a finger. “I said ‘stay,’ Dean,” he said, his voice low and firm. “As long as you’re quiet, no one should come out to check. And if you’re a good boy,” he watched as his words had the desired effect, “I’ll give you all the attention you’ve been wanting.”
“I’m close, too,” he said, breathless. “I wanted to make you beg me properly, but I don’t think I’ll last.” He lowered Dean’s body so that he could rest his hands on the seat cushions, his stomach resting on the back of the couch. “Spread your legs wider. When I hit your good spot, let me know.”
“Uh huh.” Maybe he was reading into it too much, but suddenly Dean couldn’t wait to leave. “Well, thanks.”
“God, you’re gorgeous,” he panted, their breath hot between them. “I love when your eyes turn gold for me. I love the way your body opens for me, taking me so well, the way you twitch and flutter around me, how you clench down so hard when you come.”
“And I said, ‘that’s not a great description’ and he admitted that you’d never met before. I said ‘that’s pretty brave, what if he’s a serial killer?’ But he assured me that wouldn’t be the case.” He lifted an eyebrow. “You’re not, are you?”
turned him on for Dean to pull a switcheroo on him. Maybe no one else had ever tried before. This presented some interesting possibilities. Dean grinned, wolfishly.
She handed him a ring with a modestly sized but still very sparkly round stone the exact color of Castiel’s eyes – a deep lake-blue that had just a touch of transparency so hidden depths were revealed depending on how the light hit it. The band was a matte silver, but had a thin ring of shiny gold around the middle. Many courtship items featured gold to represent the omega and he liked the subtlety of it here. The ring’s overall beauty left him speechless. As soon as it was in his hand, Dean knew that it was the one.
“Yes, daddy, such a slut for you,” he murmured, seeking out Castiel’s lips with his own, but the alpha avoided them, not giving him the pleasure of a kiss.
“I know,” said Dean, leaning in to kiss him. “I’m incredibly thankful for your patience, especially now when I know your instincts are telling you to protect me any way you know how.”
Again, a couple of things happened. Dean suddenly had to contend with a massive boner pressing urgently against the fly of his jeans while his underwear grew progressively more wet as a massive wave of slick began to drip from his cloaca. The combination of the loving stroke through his hair and the words
He set the brown paper bag on the table so the writing on the front was visible. “I’m supposed to give them this.”
Castiel’s face turned pink and Dean didn’t think it was because of the spiciness of the pie. “He says he’s already in love with me,” he admitted after swallowing.
“I think they have a group text in case they need to find one of us and we’re not answering our phones. And maybe there are conventions for managers where they swap stories and discuss how they get their clients to be on time for things.”
“I was afraid of how you’d react. I should’ve known better. You’re the only one who knows. Aside from the photographer.”
“Laugh all you want.” He held it open to the page of Dean and Cas. “This is him, isn’t it?” Dean didn’t respond, but apparently, Crowley saw what he needed to in his expression. “Huh. Unbelievable. Don’t worry, I won’t say anything, though I do worry about how this will affect your career.”
Dean just shook his head at that and allowed his eyes to drift shut. They were still waiting out the knot and he wished there was a handy bottle of water nearby (he was going to be
whine at the loss. “I would have thought you’d remember after last night, especially with the reaction you had when I grabbed your wrist, that cute little jump you did?”
“No, I’m not,” said Dean, pointing ahead. “We’re doing two more turns and going in a complete circle. I’m not walking past that horrible music again.”
“Yeah, so you can see why I want you to come out here. He’s gotta meet the most important person in my life.”
Getting up, he offered his hands and assisted Dean off the sofa. Blushing and trying to hide his smile, he backed up toward his bedroom, pulling Cas with him. He couldn’t believe it… that he was
this, craved this kind of submission, and desired to follow this man’s orders. How he’d instinctively reacted was proof of that. With a single word –
He shook his head. “I’m not upset or in pain,” he promised. “I’m just… overwhelmed. Happy, loved, but also… exposed? I feel like I’ve been cracked wide open.”
“I’m just sick of all-white. If I want something that tastes like pineapple, I’ll use pineapple and let it be yellow. I’m thinking up a new strawberry pie, maybe one that uses Chinese Black Strawberries.”
Cas looked up again, but there was only despair in his eyes. “I’m serious, Dean. I was lower than a dog to her. If you saw… How could you possibly see me as a strong, competent alpha after that? If those images get out, what would your father think? Your brother? Would they want you to continue being with me? And—” He cut himself off, looking away again. “How can
“Okay…” Anger flaring that she had made him leave without even allowing him to clean up, he tried to pull Cas in the direction of the bathroom, but he didn’t budge.
Cas pushed his chair back and stood up. His pants and underwear fell down around his ankles and he stepped out of them, toeing them aside, but his eyes never left Dean’s face. Reaching out, he traced his fingers along Dean’s cheeks, back around his ears, and down to his neck, holding it. But there was no threat there at all. Dean stayed kneeling, tall and proud, his chin lifted, his golden eyes full of trust.
this? Dean’s whole body was tingling as Castiel held eye-contact with him. It was similar to the way he felt towards the guys who would pick fights with him. The only difference was, he couldn’t feel any hostility coming from this alpha. Even so, the urge to lash out bubbled up inside of him, threatening to boil over.
“Don’t,” said Castiel, leaning his forehead against Dean’s shoulder, turning his face to scent him while he fingered him faster and faster. “I want to hear you. I want to hear every little sound you make. God, Dean, you’re so hot, I can’t wait to feel what it’s like to be inside you. You have no idea how bad I want to slam in and just
“A cab?” Dean repeated. He threw an arm around Castiel’s shoulders. “Oh, no, no, no. What we did this weekend couldn’t have been accomplished without you. So, you are coming back to The Piehole with us for beer o’clock. Or, you know, coffee or whatever you want instead. I’ll drive you to your car later.”
Sam shook his head. “You know I don’t approve of decorations before Thanksgiving,” he said, indicating the tree.
As the countdown ended and the band struck up the classic ‘Auld Lang Syne,’ the net above them opened and hundreds of balloons drifted down on top of everyone. The lights reflecting in Castiel’s eyes had them twinkling like stars as he reached for Dean’s face, his other hand pulling tighter around his waist, smiling into a kiss that had Dean’s toes curling in his shoes. Angling his head, he parted the alpha’s lips with his tongue and wrapped his arms around his neck. Instantly, his chest was vibrating in a purr that Dean could feel more than hear due to their loud surroundings. But they might as well have been the only ones in the room as they got lost in each other’s embrace.
“Well…” He drizzled a design in the glaze with his spoon, which immediately melted down into the rest of it. “I know how his words make me feel. I need to know if I feel differently in person. Right now, it isn’t… really real. But if I could hold him in my arms? What then? Will I feel awkward or…?”
“We’re holding off on the official ceremony because it’s a big deal in my family,” said Cas, rolling his eyes. “My mother wants to be a part of planning it. Believe me, if that wasn’t the case, he’d be wearing it locked way before now.”
And at least Sam would be walking into a much more stress-free setting than Dean had when he’d first set foot in this house. Everything was a lot more informal, the family was relaxed, and as an alpha, Sam wouldn’t be expected to ‘perform.’ Most of that would be on Gabriel, to show that this was the mate he’d chosen to submit for. Since it was so out of character for him normally, it probably wouldn’t take much to convince Naomi that their relationship was a good thing.
The omega burst out with a watery laugh and threw himself forward into Castiel’s arms, kissing him with everything he had, his heart overflowing.
Sam gave him a long, hard look and didn’t have to say ‘don’t screw this up’ before he turned around and headed up the street. Dean waited until he’d disappeared around the corner then reached into his jacket pocket for a pen.
“Hey, Sammy,” said Dean, clearing his throat to get rid of the sudden tightness. “Want to get your face painted?”
Dean bit his lip and squeezed Castiel’s hand. “No problem, man. Hey, if you’re feeling better this weekend, want to hit the Farmer’s Market? I promise not to fight you for produce. Unless you think that might be fun.”
, the vanilla of arousal hanging thick and mingling with the rich chocolate from himself. Fisting a hand in Castiel’s dark messy hair, he dragged their lips together, plundering with his tongue and swallowing down what he was almost about to say.
“Alright, everyone,” Michael’s voice rang out through the sound system. They looked up to see him standing on stage with the band, holding the microphone and a glass of champagne. “We’re coming up on the final countdown! Drumroll, please?”
knocking.” He’d thought Crowley had learned his lesson about messing with Dean, but the man wasn’t going to let him have the last word, apparently. “Did you need something?”
Heart racing, Dean smacked the hand away in a panic, fast as a cobra strike, and jerked back. He bumped into a folding table, making a good number of the water bottles standing on it fall over. Novak was staring at him, his hand suspended in the air, clearly shocked by Dean’s reaction.
“That can be discussed between us, but at the bare minimum,” he moved close to Dean’s front, “I’ll give you lots of praise and attention.” He lifted his hands and stroked the omega’s hair again, trailing his fingers down his neck along his spine. “That’s my good boy,” he said in a warm tone that rolled down Dean’s back like velvet. “You did so well, I’m so proud of you.” Dean actually found himself feeling something akin to disappointment when Castiel let his hands fall back to his sides. The alpha smiled at him. “Something like that. Or I can do something else that you like. If there’s anything you want me to do, you can tell me. Good communication is key.” He checked his watch. “I have to go now, but please use this time to settle into the room. I’ll see you later!”
“Not sure. Probably something anti-climactic, like Steve.” He picked up the ten with his other hand. “I’ll get you some change.”
“Yes, daddy,” said Dean, making an effort to keep his body relaxed and pliant. “I’m all yours. You protected me so well.” Hesitantly, he carded the fingers of one hand through Castiel’s hair. When it made him completely stop growling, he did it with both hands, gratified when the alpha closed his eyes and began purring quietly. “There you are,” he said, smiling. “There’s my daddy.”
“You can do this.” His brother’s voice was steady as a rock and full of unwavering confidence. It tethered him.
Dean wasn’t given too much time to think about it as a tongue dipped into his navel and the little kisses that trailed along his hip bones were surprisingly ticklish. But he would completely deny the high-pitched squeak that came out when Castiel licked a stripe along the underside of his cock. He grabbed the blanket and tossed it to the side, needing to see. He’d heard that some alphas really got off on the taste of an omega’s slick, but he’d never heard of any that willingly gave head to male omegas. It seemed to be a widespread belief that it was degrading.
The rest of the season involved Rami teleporting them all over the place, trying to catch and stop Lilith. The problem being, with hundreds of possible seals to choose from, it was pretty much impossible to be pre-emptive about it. They had to wait until she struck, hope that an agent of Heaven would see it, then Ramiel would be alerted, he would teleport Bast and himself there, and
He grumbled as he climbed the ladder to change the blackboard that listed all of their pies. “What do they need white strawberries for - they can use the red ones! I swear, they just do this to fuck with me…” He muttered a few more uncharitable phrases as he crossed ‘White Dream Pie’ off the list for the day. “Try again tomorrow. Steamroll them if you have to!”
She began to get back up, then paused. “Oh, did you want to put in an order to engrave the wedding band? Some like to wait until the courtship progresses, but if you’re already buying the full matching set…”
“Well, I’m glad it wasn’t anything more serious, but his behavior is still inexcusable.” She looked at Dean, who was finally getting his rage under control. “And you, dear? Feeling better?”
Cas as Ramiel stared at him. “How did you do that?” he demanded, getting to his feet and coming over to where Dean was looking at his hands in bewilderment.
was what brought tears to his eyes? He kept them shut tight, pressing his face against the alpha’s neck and opening his mouth to scent him better. He was shaking, lost in a hopeless mix of pain, emotion, and euphoria. Cas continued to hold him tenderly and lavish him with praise and that was all that mattered.
Meanwhile, at the convent, Rubicante and Bast were fighting through a demonic army to get to Lilith who was performing some kind of ritual at an altar within. It was all for show—the demons who died in the fight, Rubicante encouraging him on the whole time, telling him to do it for Jed—to make Bast think he was doing the right thing by killing Lilith.
“Like it?” he repeated, incredulously. “It’s breathtaking.” As if he meant it literally, Dean drew in a shaking breath and swallowed hard. “I would be so proud to wear your collar. I whole-heartedly consent.”
When the song ended, he grabbed some toilet paper, wiped his face and blew his nose. He hoped that the message had come across. His phone buzzed and he checked it immediately, the light from his phone nearly blinding him after being in the dark for so long.
Gabriel grinned. “What, you don’t like the idea of the King of Rock n’ Roll asking my dearest to be my ‘hunka-hunka burning love’?”
At first, he wasn’t sure what he was seeing. Streaming out of his back, waving in a non-existent breeze, were brilliant banners of multi-colored light. They followed him as he moved, trying to get a better look. They weren’t quite wings, they were more amorphous in shape and constantly moving, but it was gorgeous. He was
Lilith died in a burst of red light and Rubicante began laughing, finally revealing her part in the long game. She announced that she’d been working for Lilith the whole time and why—to break the final seal. Bast blew her away with the Colt as well, but it didn’t really matter because meanwhile, Lilith’s blood formed a pool and separated into a complicated circular sigil on the ground. The circle then opened up into a black hole that belched a towering inferno of black fire.
“Well,” said Bast, spreading his hands, “obviously, we can go back to the ol’ grind. Hunting things, saving people, the Colt Covenant. But… that’s just what we’ve been
Climbing up on the bed, he got between the demon’s legs. The closer he got, the stronger his sweet baking-pie smell became, making Dean’s mouth water all over again. His face grew warm, knowing Cas was watching his every move, as he lowered himself down, puckered up, and pressed a breathless kiss to the tip of the straining cock. He couldn’t help darting out his tongue to capture the tiny bead of moisture gathering there. His brain lit up as he swallowed, sending a shiver down his spine. A sound of agony ripped its way out of his throat.
Tilting his head and furrowing his brow, Cas squinted in confusion. “I don’t understand that reference.”
Smacking his tongue against the roof of his mouth, Angel Eyes considered his answer. “This is a good one,” he said. “Definitely not pumpkin, but it has sweetness… and a note of tart as well.”
“Well…” He scratched the back of his head, looking away from those dazzlingly blue eyes. “I trust you. I just better not see any of these turning up at Daily Bread. Otherwise I might have to kill you.” The last part was said as a joke, but Castiel took Dean’s hand in both of his.
Rowena had proven immensely helpful. Thanks to her, Dean was contacted by several different English actors who all provided testimony that Naomi had bribed reporters to write fake slanderous articles about them, creating difficulties for them in their careers whenever they pissed her off.
Before Cas could draw him away to speak with other members of the family, outcry among the audience stalled them. Dean lifted his head to look and saw that ‘Kitten,’ Michael’s mate, had gone totally limp on the floor. He’d passed out and ‘Pet’ was frantic, shaking him and becoming more agitated by the moment. The myriad of alarmed smells in the air were probably making things worse for her.
“Well, that’s kind of rude, how would you like it if my brother and I were calling you Trench Coat behind your back?”
Sam pointed. Dean followed his line of sight out the kitchen window and to the parking lot where a white van was just pulling in – marked on the side with Your Daily Bread.
Dean chewed on his lower lip, debating on whether or not he should tell his brother. “I made a deal.”
“We can record it,” said Gabe. “Or, if you’re not busy that day, we can livestream it.” He whipped out his phone. “Gimme your details, I’ll keep you in the loop.”
I bake a lot of bread. My suggestion for yeast is universal for activating it, but not all flours rise alike. Nut flours are much heavier than wheat flour and will usually require more than one leavening agent. Are you trying to bake gluten free?
He snorted. The man probably thought it had something to do with their innate biology, that Dean might feel inclined to
“Don’t get too relaxed,” Sam said. “There’s still prep to do for tomorrow and you guys left a mess in the kitchen.”
The younger Winchester laughed, shortly. “Castiel, we considered it fancy to drink beer from a bottle instead of a can.”
His inner omega cried mournfully. If he hadn’t been wearing blockers, he was positive his scent would have turned sour, like rancid butter.
finale. Seeing Castiel’s gorgeous face, he couldn’t bring himself to turn it back off. His acting had improved so much. Dean smiled sadly.
“I know, just breathe, let my scent soothe you,” he said, picking Dean up and cradling him in his arms. He carried Dean out of his trailer with his head covered.
Taking a deep breath, Dean calmed himself and went still in Castiel’s grip, having learned to pay attention to that particular warning.
But now that the most nerve-wracking part of the night was done, Dean was finding it harder to remain comfortable in his submission in front of Sam. He kept interrupting Cas as they spoke about their coursework and making sarcastic comments to his brother the way he usually did. All of it went against the training that he’d been working so diligently on. Dean knew it was important to remember what he should be doing at all times so that it came naturally to him, like muscle memory, by the time he met Castiel’s conservative family. He’d already been warned that they would be able to tell if Dean was just going through the motions or faking the submission. And since he came from nothing, he desperately wanted to impress them and give them zero ammunition to shoot holes into their courtship.
“Dean, you have to know,” he said, quietly, “I love you, too. And that means no matter who else likes you, no matter who enters your life from now on, I won’t let anyone have you. I’m sorry to be so possessive; I’m sorry if that scares you, too, but you are mine.” He tilted Dean’s head up to meet his eyes and they were full of warmth and want. “And I’m so grateful to have you. I’ll never take the gift that is your love for granted. Every day, I want to be worthy of it.”
He was calling her by her first name? Why did that make the hair on the back of Dean’s neck stand up? He sneaked closer to the door, shamelessly listening in since there wasn’t anyone else around.
“But I thought you were going to do the ceremony this month?” said Anna, a little frown line appearing between her auburn brows.
They carried on in this manner for twelve pages. Cas slowly became harder the longer it went on, rising to full hardness by the time Dean was swirling his tongue to signal he’d reached the end of the chapter. The book was taken away and Cas cradled the back of Dean’s head with both hands.
was the guy who’d stolen his title! He’d never catch that Emmy if he didn’t take things more seriously.
that he hoped Cas could feel as well. In that moment, as if it wasn’t gone already, Dean’s heart gave itself completely over to Cas. He knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that there could be no one else.
“Of course, you did, my good boy. I just remember coming into the kitchen and seeing you hurt with them standing over you,” said Cas, confirming what Dean suspected. “After that, it’s kind of a blur.”
The oily man smiled darkly and attacked back, waiting for his opening, then he grabbed Dean by the front of his shirt, lifted him up, and then slammed him down on the ground, sword raised for a kill shot. It was done all without wires, using only Crowley’s strength as an alpha, which still surprised Dean a bit, considering his smaller height.
Dean was antsy, feeling like he needed to move. He looked over at the alpha. Castiel was turned away, facing the wall, his body rising and falling minutely as he breathed. Dean closed his laptop and set it aside, grabbing his boots from next to his bed. On socked feet, he left the room and put his boots on in the empty hallway.
At some point, he was aware of Cas moving them both down to the mattress, hauling Dean onto his side. The alpha’s knot was beginning to catch and he angled Dean’s hips up toward him, thrusting harder to force his swelling cock in and out before they were tied.
“Yes,” said Dean, breathlessly. He swallowed hard, his instincts telling him to bare his neck for his alpha and submit to the order. “Yes, I’ll wait.”
“So, I just won’t sleep,” said Dean, shrugging. “I had to, Sam. She’s in the same situation as me. Seeing this wedding will give me hope.”
He forced a smile. “Come on, just take me home. I’ll treat you to a beer. Only one, so you’ll be under the legal limit.”
Still pumping, still thrusting, Cas leaned over Dean’s chest. Dean reached around the demon’s shoulders and grabbed the base of his wings, clawing outward with his fingers, hard, but not rough enough to pull any feathers. Cas cried out and his hand tightened on Dean, ensuring that they were both coming – Cas deep inside Dean, and Dean all over Cas’ front – explosively and repeatedly, shouting their ecstasy to the sky.
Squeezing a middle finger into the midst, he scissored them slowly until he could get the other one in as well. One hand in, one hand out, alternating them so Cas was never empty, sliding and tugging while the alpha moaned and held on around Dean’s neck. His skin had grown damp with sweat, his scent deepening and mixing with the omega’s, creating a heady perfume that filled the room.
“Train me?” Dean went on as though the alpha hadn’t spoken. He put one foot on the floor, but his knee wobbled, telling him his legs wouldn’t quite support him yet. Huffing, he waited a little longer for his body to get under his full control, but he carried on, glaring up at Castiel. “I’m not about to become some fucking alpha’s slave or whatev—”
Despite his brave words, Dean’s anxiety twisted his stomach ever tighter the closer they came to the college. It wasn’t late by any means, so there were still plenty of people walking around campus. Even with everything he’d done that day, Dean suspected this would be the most difficult part.
“Don’t be stupid,” said Sam, seeing through him as always. “Cas would not dump you for a bad Christmas. In fact, he’ll probably laugh about it and suggest you plan something together next year so neither one of you folds under the pressure. Get over yourself and stand in his shoes. That should tell you what to do.”
For the moment, the audience could see what Ramiel saw. Bast’s soul was broken from within, splashed with black, barely held together with wispy gray. Beautiful for what remained, but still broken, tainted. Then it was touched by the angel’s light, making the black recede, screeching in pain and fury from the sheer purity of an archangel. The light wove itself into the cracks, pulling the soul back together and making it whole, shining with threads of gold… Somehow, it was more beautiful now for having been broken. And then… something strange happened.
“Mmm,” he sighed, his nose buried in Dean’s soft spikes. “You smell like my shampoo. You’ve been showering here more often than not.” He smiled. “When we live together and mate, our scents will merge properly. You know I love that. When you smell like me.”
He had no idea and he wasn’t about to ask, but there was a slightly acrid smell creeping into his sweetness, the scent of burnt chocolate making its way through the heavy pheromones in the air.
“This is typical abusive behavior,” said Dean, his mouth pressing into a grim line. “She’s isolating you. So you have no one to turn to. No support system.”
Floating. No body, no tether. Weightless. Dean as a person didn’t exist. It was all just suspended, more feeling than felt. Like the vastness of space, but warm like the softest, coziest blanket ever. He’d had small tastes of this when he’d gone into sub-space before, but he’d always had the sense of knowing where his body was. This was like leaving the earth entirely and fully entering the astral plane.
His phone remained quiet after that, but Dean would have been too busy to type a response anyway. Around mid-day, a familiar face came through the door, carrying a paper bag with the Trickster logo.
“It’s not a problem,” said Meg. “As they say, there’s no such thing as bad press. I got some headlines in the deal, I’m good.”
They drove further into the city, where the homes trended larger and more grandiose, the restaurants very up-scale and exclusive, and the stores became specialty boutiques. This was the type of area that Dean would have maybe driven through but never dared to actually set foot in. For all that he looked the part now, inside he still felt like hooker-Julia-Roberts, ready to be turned away as not good enough to shop.
That seemed to wake something up inside Crowley because suddenly they were getting through the full sequence without having to cut. Zeddmore still needed lots of takes from multiple angles, but hopefully, they wouldn’t have to go into overtime if they kept up this pace. They moved into close-ups, including one shot where they had their swords crossed with both of them leaning into it. It meant having to stare into each other’s eyes while they said their lines and Dean was never more grateful for scent blockers.
Beside them, the hot lamp on the desk flared bright and burst with a loud pop. There were sparks in the air around them, disappearing before Dean could get a good look. The demon continued to come for a long time until it began to leak out a little around his dick.
“Even though it looks different than you expected?” Dean asked, stepping back and holding out his arms, indicating the soft black sweater and green skirt he was wearing that day.
Setting down the bag, Castiel reached for the white box and opened it, revealing perfectly glazed mango slices drizzled in a bright orange sauce arranged in a spiral on top of a white pie. “This was for him.”
“I’ll shut up when I’m satisfied,” said the alpha. Grabbing Dean’s hips, he suddenly pushed him down all the way, making the omega cry out in sharp pleasure-pain. “Ah, your ass is so tight and I’m inside you so deep. I can feel you twitching all around me.” He cupped Dean’s face in his hand, fingers tracing behind one ear. “Will you really just go back to fucking beta girls after this? Can you forget me so easily?”
The alpha purred in his ear. “That’s all I can ask. Give me your trust and I will give you everything. This is a mutual relationship, Dean. You give me everything and in return, you trust that I will give everything to you. I know your life has been so hard. You’ve always had to be so responsible, even now. But when I’m taking care of you, you don’t need to worry about all of that. You can let all of it go. Let me free you.”
What he didn’t worry about was Castiel. The alpha had promised he would never judge him for anything he needed to be happy and healthy, no matter what it was, no matter how dark or dirty or secret. And that was worth its weight in gold because Dean had never had that in his life. Even with how close he was with his brother, he’d never admitted to Sam that Rhonda Hurley had made him try on her panties when they’d gone out in high school, but he felt like it was something he could tell Castiel. Hell, he could even tell the alpha he’d
The woman rose from the cushion she’d been kneeling on to assist Dean from the proper height and went through a door at the back of the shop. While she was gone, Dean pressed a hand to his chest, feeling his racing heartbeat, and closed his eyes as he took a calming breath. He was really doing this. He was sitting in a jewelry store that normally he’d never come within a mile of and picking out a courtship gift for an alpha. His mouth was so dry it was hard for him to swallow. Opening his eyes, he looked down at himself, at the beautiful dress he was wearing. It was so different; everything was
Dean nodded and all he wanted to do was kiss the hell out of his adorable man. “I think he hated knowing he was about to disappoint you.”
Dean didn’t stop or speak again until they’d turned the next corner, which fed into a brick alleyway. He ducked in and punched the wall.
At that moment, a fourth caterer came hurrying through the hall door carrying a tray with a small rectangular cake on it, not paying very good attention to their surroundings, probably just aware that they were running late. The bride squeaked in alarm and tried to stop, but her fancy wedding heels skidded out from under her. In a kind of slow-motion, Dean watched as they collided and the cake went flying. There was no saving it. The nut-covered creation fell to the floor with a splat along with the tray that clanged like a dropped coin.
“Come again soon!” Turning away, he took the tray from Castiel. “Why don’t you go back to the kitchen. Uriel can take over out here.”
Dropping the back of his head onto Castiel’s shoulder and clutching the arm rests with his hands, Dean let himself go, his mouth falling open in a silent cry, his body shaking as it tensed all at once with his climax. White static exploded behind his eyelids. Then, all tension seeped out of him, leaving him totally boneless and lying limp on top of his alpha.
Dean as Bast stormed into a dilapidated barn in the middle of nowhere, a wooden box covered in silver runes clutched under his arm. He held an uncapped bottle of whiskey in his other hand, which he finished off, wiped his mouth with his sleeve, and threw it at the wall where it shattered. This was right after Jed’s dramatic sacrifice and death. Bast had tried to make a deal with a demon to get them out of the hunting life and Jed had shown up to stop him, saving Bast from going to H-E-double-hockey-sticks but ending up there himself as the demon dragged Jed down with him, so Bast was rightfully distraught.
“Then take me back as your beloved, daddy,” said Dean. “I don’t have to answer to anyone but you. And if anyone looks at me the wrong way, you can tear them a new one.”
He glanced up from the magazine to look at his television, currently playing the season two finale. He’d seen most of this already, of course, but he wanted to watch the last scene. The CGI had been so complicated that Dean had only gotten to see the green screen version –
He showed Dean. It didn’t take long to search the internet for what it meant. The sites were all splashed with variations of the same question—
The way she said ‘pet’ made Dean want to barf. She was still assuming that he didn’t know about the videos she was holding over Castiel’s head. This was her trying to intimidate Cas in front of his co-star, not his lover. He suspected things would be so much worse if that was the case. Right now, she just wanted Dean to lose his respect for Cas as a co-worker, not completely destroy the image of him as his alpha.
“I was just at Dr Novak’s office today, so I know he’ll take good care of Adam,” he said. “Personally, I find it a lot more likely that he passed out because of a lack of care on his alpha’s part, rather than anything you did.”
“He means ‘stereotypical white lady,’” Gabe translated. “It’s really just an excuse to get together and have cake. Gender is a social construct. But playing guessing games and throwing pink or blue confetti is fun!”
“She thinks she’s planning your perfect ceremony,” said Gabe, dismissively. “She’ll get over not having control over ours. Vegas is way more fitting to our aesthetic anyway.”
Rolling his eyes to conceal how contagious the alpha’s enthusiasm was, Dean put the magazine aside and dedicated his evening to helping Cas decorate. “Is this your favorite holiday or something?”
Before too long, Cas was holding his swelling knot and Dean tightened his lips as he moved faster, reaching underneath to fondle the alpha’s balls at the same time. When they began to draw up, Dean hollowed his cheeks and sucked hard, taking him in as far back as he could, pressing his lips against the knot like an open-mouthed kiss. Cas held the back of Dean’s head, keeping him still as he came down the back of his throat. His long drawn-out sighs came with the slight rumble of a growl.
His brows lifted. “Can’t you see what’s happening? We’re highly compatible. I suspected once I scented you, but I couldn’t be sure until I tried out a command.” He reached out to Dean’s head, making the omega flinch back, though he couldn’t move very much. That was the worst, he couldn’t fight back at all. But the alpha only ran his fingers through Dean’s damp spiky hair. “Good boy, Dean,” he crooned. “I think we’ll work well together. I’m so looking forward to training you.”
“I didn’t want you to think I haven’t missed you like crazy,” said Sam, warmly. “I’m just still getting used to all this.”
With all the laughter and happy scents filling the air in the huge kitchen, it was only Gabriel who remained nervous as he assisted Dean with making the pies – two pumpkin, one caramel apple, and one dutch apple, all with crust made from scratch. His hands shook slightly and he kept looking at the clock, clearly wondering when Sam and Cas would arrive. It was no wonder. This would be Sam’s first introduction to the Novaks in person and he had a very important question to ask. Gabriel was wearing an apron over the dress Sam had helped him pick out specially for the occasion. It was a silky number with a flared skirt in a soft, dusky gold color that complemented his hair and eyes beautifully. Since Gabe tended to dress more neutrally, appearing so starkly feminine had definitely lifted a few eyebrows.
“Power is addictive,” he said. “The more you use it, the easier it is to let go of your humanity. And if there’s nothing left of you, I won’t be able to purify your soul. You’ll be a demon forever.”
Ah, I understand now. To tell the truth, I had purposefully not thought about how my family would react. I didn’t want to burden myself with that worry until I could meet you and learn what that felt like. I thought ‘maybe it will be different in person. Maybe this will solve the puzzle and end the magic once all questions are answered.’ But I don’t think I can fool myself any longer, even though we didn’t meet. My emotions have been compromised in the best and worst ways, thanks to you. Best, because it fills me with elation. Worst, because it goes against everything I know, and that makes it terrifying. I feel like I stand at the edge of a great precipice. Below, a foggy abyss that I can’t see the bottom of. I have no idea what I’m diving into. Will I crash? Or will someone catch me?
As he started out, Dean looked up, inspiration striking. “Cas!” he exclaimed, running down the hall and grabbing him by the shoulders. “You could make them a new cake, couldn’t you? A
an ass and didn’t make him wait long for a reply. In fact, it was almost like he’d been waiting for it. Had he?
“You just stop caring about them for a little while. And when they come back, you feel awful on top of it.” Castiel sighed again. “I never do this. I used to believe I knew myself. I knew what my future held and even the people who would be in it. But now… I know nothing.”
“Alright. Let’s do it. I want to know exactly what it feels like to be your mate and you should see if I’m capable of giving you what you want. If either one of us feels off, then we won’t work.”
Castiel pointed at the bottle. “I mean, it’s from the correct region of France. It’s real champagne, not sparkling wine.”
Dean hesitated at the mention of his beloved black Chevy Impala. “Do that and you’ll never drive her again. Just be there. You
However, he almost forgot about what they were intending to do once they were out on the street. There were people and vendors everywhere, street bands on every block, an electric atmosphere, and seeing the way Sam’s eyes lit up, like he was still the little kid he used to be, reminded Dean a bit too much of their non-traditional upbringing. When they’d wanted to have fun in the past, they’d always gone just the two of them, leaving their dad absorbed in work. There were days Dean wasn’t even sure he knew they were out. He was there… but he wasn’t. And he and Sam never really talked about it, they just carried on.
With his dopey smiles and unassuming posturing, Cas seemed like the type of person everyone would get along with, but in reality, Dean could see he wasn’t very close with anyone. People kept their distance from who they perceived as a very serious and disciplined character. And ever since Castiel’s father died, he’d been hiding his deepest feelings and suffering in silence, going to therapy, meditating, but never gaining true relief.
Whatever Dean had been about to say dried up. If the logo on the man’s shirt hadn’t told him, the blaring religious music he could now make out from the rest of the bands playing around them would have clued him in. They were standing in front of Your Daily Bread. Sam’s mouth was in a flat, grim line.
“Thank you for agreeing to meet with me again,” said Chuck. “I had some paperwork drawn up for you.”
“They didn’t,” said Cas. “Mother and father were unaware of the full extent of things at the Shurleys, though I thought they knew at the time, which is why I went along with it. No one was more surprised than me when my balls dropped instead of developing a birthing-hole. Our engagement was called off the same day because we were expected to have pups and that’s impossible for two alphas unless they have a surrogate. Our parents were very traditionally-minded people, they wanted it done the old-fashioned way.” He ran a hand through his hair, disheveling it even more than usual. “I was devastated.”
Panicking, Dean put his hand into the man’s without thinking, letting him look it over for injuries. “Um, this, uh, this isn’t what it looks like!” he stuttered.
So, it was time to take risks, do controversial things, and indulge in storylines they normally wouldn’t in the name of preserving their ratings. Webb gave his full support, as long as they adhered to censorship guidelines like always. This was their last go-round, so why not? The writers were
He untied the sides of the G-string and slowly pulled the string of pearls from between the omega’s cheeks, tossing the scrap of fabric aside. Cas licked a stripe along the underside of Dean’s cock and it stood away from his body, seeking more attention, as Dean moaned, tilting his head back. Beginning to pant, he looked back down immediately, concentrating on everything Cas was doing to him. This was his alpha taking care of him.
The quick agreement had him pausing. They might be recently acquainted, but Novak seemed like a decent guy and that was rare enough for alphas that Dean knew he should try not to be so dismissive. He turned around to face him again, absently rubbing the back of his neck. “Maybe some other time, okay?” He pointed in the general direction of the alpha’s shoes. “Say, Novak… About how long were you standing there?”
“Uh-huh.” Cas did not sound convinced. “I must not be fucking you hard enough if you have the brain-power to lie to me.”
Surging to his feet and completely ignoring the way his head throbbed at the sudden change in equilibrium, he got dressed as fast as he could, made sure he had all his belongings, and got out of there like the devil himself was on his heels.
“It’s about the challenge, Sam,” said Dean, immediately jumping to Castiel’s defense. “This is how pies are created, you try lots of different things to see what works and what doesn’t. When you have a tricky ingredient, you really have to get creative to pull it off. It’s impressive!”
Dean slapped a hand over his mouth, stopping himself from shouting. His stomach twisted as his body had a visceral reaction to this turn of events, nausea rising in his throat. Surely, Cas wouldn’t—but what choice did he have? If the evidence Naomi had was as bad as it sounded, then Castiel’s career would be over the second it hit the internet. His reputation would be ruined. It wouldn’t affect how Dean felt about him, but he couldn’t picture John Winchester being happy about their relationship if the videos got out. Besides that, what would Castiel’s family think? And if all this was going through Dean’s mind, it had to occur to Cas, too.
“Not bad, just different. The mango one reminded me of a spicy fruit and cheese danish. You know, after I could breathe normally again. It really packed a punch! Can I try this one, too?”
His quarry didn’t notice what was happening until Dean put both hands against the island on either side of his hips, caging him in. Cas turned within that small circle, arms in the air to avoid dripping peach juice on either of them.
“You’re sure it’ll work?” Dean asked, ignoring the cozy position they were in. They weren’t… cuddling. He was just too boneless and satisfied to move, even to go clean up. That could wait. “Not just demons, but humans, too?”
“Dean!” he exclaimed, pushing the pants down to reveal the pale pink satin panties, embellished with black bows in the front and back.
career first.” He turned and started hurrying after his brother, his heart growing heavier with each step. “I’ll go home with Sam.”
“We could check out the competition down the street,” Sam wheedled and damn if he didn’t know Dean’s weaknesses. “Been a while since we last looked at their menus and crowds…”
Cas rolled his eyes so hard it was a full-body movement but he was smiling. “I know. He’s like a little sunflower.”
Bast chuckled. “You’ve gotten to know me too well.” He sighed and shrugged. “Seriously, I don’t know. This whole thing was… a lot. I really didn’t know what I was getting myself into, just like you said. But I’ll just keep doing what I’ve always done, the only thing I really
“Uh-huh.” Dean’s eyes were on the key now as Cas reached out and held it between his thumb and forefinger… but Dean couldn’t seem to make himself let go.
“Quite a lot, actually.” After placing a bandaid on Dean’s forehead and a smaller one near his mouth, Dr Crowley went back to his desk, leaning his rump against it. “Biologically, you’re subconsciously seeking out guidance from an alpha. You acting out in increasingly violent ways is proof of that. Because this is the first time you’ve been away from your family, your pack leader; you’re adrift. Lashing out in all directions until you find where the line is drawn, but there’s no one to draw that line. Does that make sense to you?”
He was on top of Dean in moments, still mostly dressed with just the necessities pulled down, getting fully naked could wait. Dean really did sob when the blessedly erect cock slid inside of him, no foreplay or preamble required, filling him the way he needed to be filled. He just wrapped his arms and legs around his alpha and held on for the ride, encouraging him with a litany of pleas for “more” and “harder” and “fuck!”
There was one thing that was bugging him, though. “Hey, is it normal to bliss out during a punishment?”
“I want you to be mine,” he said and the glow of red from his eyes allowed Dean to see his tender expression. “It’s the only thing that makes sense since I have no intention of letting anyone else have you."
“I see the way you’ve been ogling me in class whenever you think I’m not looking,” the alpha continued, frowning down at him. “To think, an honor student like you would allow yourself to become so distracted.”
When he got back to The Piehole, Sam was in the living area upstairs watching TV but he immediately muted it when Dean walked in holding the box.
Dean pulled at the collar of his shirt, cinched tight by the tie around his neck, and cleared his throat. He could maybe see the resemblance between this man and Naomi in the intense blue eyes, though Chuck didn’t seem nearly as intimidating. Perhaps because he didn’t have a typical alpha bearing—he had a smaller stature, the angles of his face softened by his salt-and-pepper beard.
to rehearse with the actual person he was doing the scene with, but that was yet another thing Crowley had skipped out on.
“Well… no, that’s exactly what it was.” He took his hand back, a touch belatedly. “But generally, clients don’t look too fondly on assault.”
Opening his eyes, he saw not Cas beside him, but Crowley, still asleep. Dean jerked away from him so fast, he fell off the side of the bed, adding to his laundry list of pain. Eyes wide, he crab-walked backward until his back hit the wall. Noticing his nakedness with growing alarm, he grabbed the curtain hanging next to him and wrapped it around himself.
Cas shook violently from head to toe, giving Dean an aftershock from where they were still joined. He was pretty sure the demon just had another, smaller, orgasm. Cas stared at him with eyes so bright, but Dean could see them quite clearly for the first time. They weren’t just blue, they were twin burning stars, flickering in all sorts of colors that he hadn’t been able to see before. Likewise, what he’d seen as starling wings, with jewel-like colors and white tips, actually shifted like the milky way and glimmered like millions of diamonds in the ever-changing rainbow.
“Rami,” he said, going to him. He lifted a gentle hand to the angel’s face, turning it so his beautiful blue eyes were visible. They were full of more vulnerability than Bast had ever seen in them before. “I definitely don’t deserve it, but I know what love looks like. I know what it feels like. And what happened between us wouldn’t have, if it wasn’t something we both really wanted. Right?”
He’d begun speaking to the pups more often now, ever since he’d read that their ears would have developed enough to hear sounds. Pups almost always recognized the voice of their mother, Cas wanted them to recognize his as well. They even sang lullabies at night before their evening knot.
“Castiel!” He dropped his bag and practically flew over the counter, throwing himself into Castiel’s arms.
“Cheers!” Dean, Castiel, and Sam all clinked their bottles together in celebration of a job well done. Cas couldn’t stop smiling, it made Dean wonder if his family ever had any good times together. Or was it just the same thing, day in, day out? Do as you’re told and that’s it? As bad as it sounded to Dean, he could still understand how difficult it was for Castiel to leave. It was his family. It was all he knew.
He wasn’t the only one. Time had slowed to a crawl and all Dean could see were those beautiful pink lips coming nearer and wondering what they might feel like on his. His mind was blissfully empty, his body warm and malleable, and it would be so easy to indulge and thread his fingers through that wet, sexy hair. All he wanted was to fall forward into those welcoming arms and find the comfort there he’d never found anywhere else. He could barely locate the strength to resist. What the
A thick trail of slick ran down Dean’s thigh, revealing without words what he wanted. Why was Cas doing this to him? What was it that he ‘needed to know’? It wasn’t that he wanted Dean to say he wanted the orgasm, but that he wanted
He gently bit the jut of the omega’s hip to punctuate his statement, careful not to leave a mark that would last. Taking Dean’s cock in hand, he tilted it upright and let more honey drip down. The omega jolted a little when he licked it away then engulfed him in his mouth, but what made him start to gush with slick was when a finger sticky with honey teased the rim of his ass.
He opened his eyes in shock to see Castiel was still crowding him against the wall, breathing like he’d just run a mile. He could blame adrenaline for that, but what he couldn’t account for was the red glow filamenting his eyes, almost turning them violet as red striated the blue.
“That it was normal for a familial omega to do so spontaneously, in the absence of the omega parent,” Castiel finished for him. “Wow… Dean, I am so impressed.”
Fuck it. Dean unbuttoned his pants and reached into his underwear, taking himself in hand as he leaned his head back and closed his eyes. He imagined himself walking into Castiel’s room in total darkness and cuddling close on his double bed. Leaning down and kissing him, soft at first, then with more and more intensity. Coaxing him to open his mouth by teasing him with his tongue and delving inside. What would he taste like? Tonight, it would be the alcohol he’d consumed and it made Dean wonder what sort he favored. He chose to imagine the burn of his preferred brand of whiskey, a little sweet, a little warm. He would drag his fingers through that dark, messy hair. Would he be shocked if Dean pulled on it a bit? Or would he like it and moan? Maybe a little of both.
She did so, appearing much calmer already, probably just by nature of Dean surprising her out of her panic. Gabe went to the cupboards and found a glass, then filled it up from the fancy refrigerator door, and returned to Kelly. He pressed it into her hands, encouraging her to use both when he noticed how shaky they were. Gratefully, she drank the water, a little of it slipping out of the sides of her mouth, making Dean wonder how long it had been since she’d last used an actual glass.
I’ve had dreams about you during our correspondence as well. But just how ‘vivid’ was it? Was it… sexy?
Cas’ cock pulsed deep inside him as the demon nearly came, just from that show of trust. Cradling Dean’s cheek in one hand, Cas held his gaze and said, slowly and deliberately, “I love you, Dean Michael Winchester.”
Licking his lips, Cas hesitated, then bravely said, “Not to bring up private family matters, but from the dismissive way she talked about them… please look after your grandchildren. They shouldn’t have to suffer for losing her either.”
“I do like pumpkin pie,” said Dean, pouring the whiskey. “But I think it’s more of a November flavor.”
“It’s been a while for us,” said Cas, rutting along Dean’s opening, coating his cock in slick, “so I’ll go slowly. Relax and breathe for me.”
He knew Sam was right and he made a good point, but the memories embarrassed him. Sam had deserved a lot better and Dean could only do so much back then. He deflected in typical Dean fashion, “I’m
Cas spoke too soon. A moment later, using his close proximity to Sam’s ear, Luce licked a stripe along his neck. And Dean’s patience snapped at the exact same time Sam used his massive alpha strength to push Luce away from him.
“No.” Reaching out, he squeezed Dean’s hand. “Wish me luck. I haven’t done anything like this since finishing school training, never for real.”
“You should have seen him, Sam,” said Dean as he pulled chairs off tables in The Piehole’s eating area. “Cas looked them all right in the eye and didn’t waver even once. It was incredible.”
’s filming hiatus between seasons. He had the lead role, being the ‘hot young stud’ of television’s new hit series, and Novak, a relative newcomer to the industry with only two years of experience under his belt, had been given an important supporting role. This would be his official debut in film and he was opposite Dean, practically a veteran who’d been acting since he was a child.
a little worried that just plain Dean wasn’t good enough for you,” he said, looking down at their hands.
He tilted his head. “Maybe I had forgotten. I’ve laughed more since we met than I have in years. Something else I should thank you for.”
“Walk me through your memory,” he said as their body heat began to warm them up, “I want to see it.”
“Me neither. But I am looking forward to the ceremony.” He put his arms around Castiel’s neck and they started to slow dance to Bing Crosby’s
Sighing, Dean turned his back to the man in order to pick up his personal shirt. “Fine, I guess it couldn’t hurt to—gyaah!” A cold hand on the small of his back jolted him upright and he whirled around. “What the
Castiel stood there holding a basket full of different types of bread rolls and baguettes, in a white uniform branded with his name and a logo. Clean, professional, no five o’clock shadow because it was so early in the day. He looked so natural, like he just belonged, maybe he was used to this kind of setting. They were mere steps apart, but it might as well have been miles. The chasm Cas had talked about in that one email, yawning between them. Dean was suddenly seized with the urge to grab him and run away. This wasn’t his world anymore, he wanted to make a new world, just for the two of them.
Putting his fork down, Dean turned in his seat to face Castiel. “Look, stop me if I’m crossing a line here… but is this your first relationship with a man?”
“This, from the man with his knot currently up inside me. Are you going to tell me this was different? Because I’d really love to hear that explanation.”
Dean nodded and waved before closing the door. Leaning forward, he rested his head against the cool wood and palmed himself through his jeans, groaning quietly. “Sooner than you think,” he mumbled.
kind of outlet, don’t you find that your stress gets all pent-up inside? When that happens, the only way you have to let it out is by fighting. But you really shouldn’t be doing that, as I’m sure you’re aware.” His eyes bored into Dean’s. “Doesn’t it leave you feeling unsatisfied and empty?”
They rutted against each other through their underwear while they kissed. Dean moaned at the feel of Castiel’s cotton briefs slip-sliding over the satin he was wearing, so different than usual, so much more sensual against his skin.
It turned out Dean didn’t need to have worried, Gabriel had his back, like always. The fellow omega ensured that there were wine and cocktails aplenty for everyone who wasn’t pregnant, so the whole family was feeling loose and having a good time as they hung out and cooked together, Naomi included. Seeing her laugh was a little like seeing Cas laugh for the first time – it totally transformed her face, making her seem younger, approachable, even.
“We’ve got a big event that we’re providing dessert for this weekend,” he said, pulling out a chair at the kitchen island for Castiel. “I agreed to it before asking how big it was.”
“Mmm,” Dean moaned, tilting his head to give the alpha better access. “Please, daddy, will you put the cock ring on me?”
“Directors, am I right?” Crowley said, his dark eyes watching the omega with interest in the mirror.
“I get that,” said Dean. “I never had a chance to make real friends with anyone till probably senior year of high school. Dad moved me and Sammy around a lot after…”
He took a bite. The lemon was not subtle, it wasn’t quite a pucker, but it did cause a bit of an ache in the back of his jaw, the way a citrus fruit alcohol would. The sour flavor was immediately tempered by the sweetness of the cheesecake and the whipped cream together. He could still feel the heat from the Scotch Bonnet, but it wasn’t nearly as painful as before. It burned, but didn’t bring tears to his eyes instantly.
“The one you made last night. Like a puppy who knows he did something bad.” He leaned in, pressing their foreheads together. “It’s
So, dressed in a new dark suit with a subtle blue plaid in a wide pattern, he sat in Sam’s car along with John, bouncing his leg impatiently, as they headed over to meet Cas and his family at The Gates. Sam was wearing a pretty boring gray suit with a red-striped tie, but John looked rather handsome in black-on-black, the collar of his shirt left open.
