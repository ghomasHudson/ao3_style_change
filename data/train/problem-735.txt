"My homeland is not Russia, sir." Mikheia answered, his eyes still on the curve in the wall where that strangely lucid man had run. He hoped he got out. "I do not think he is. A threat, I mean. His eyes were kind. But they were dying."
“That’s not an answer. And, as much as I hate to rain on your parade, love,” Not-John says and Sherlock can hear the smile before he slides down the row of drawers to sit opposite him. “You’ll have to look at me sometime. You’ve got to clean the wound before it can heal.”
He licked a finger, dipping it into the large bag of powder. Rubbed it on his gums, the taste bitter and chemical. This haul was…okay. He’d had better, but it’s not like the teenagers of Twin Peaks could tell good shit from bad. They’d swallow it down without complaint and he’d get his money.
John still seemed to have some resemblance of a life, which was good. He still called and met with old friends, there were still nights were he went out, but every night he dutifully returned, and that's wasn't an exaggeration.
“—But,” he goes on, “That doesn’t mean I’m not angry. What you did today—what you did three years ago—that was unacceptable, that was worse than unacceptable, it was...it was something I never thought I could live through. And then you come back with your apologies and tell me I'm the one with martyr eyes when you didn't even see how you looked at me when I came in the room. And you sat across from me, hours after you called me water to a dying man, looked me in the face, and told me Harry deserved what she got—I thought I might be the cause of your actual death tonight.”
"I know." John sighed, running a hand through his hair. "I know you are. But that doesn't change the fact that you let me watch you fall, you let me believe you were dead. Friends don't do that to each other."
One by one, his cabinets, his mounds of gold moulded into other forms, imploded, the glass panes bursting outwards wholly, untouched, while the shelves shrank into themselves, rooting downwards into the floor to spring into green shoots and thin sprouts and tall trees. He walked in a daze through them, the panes shooting past him like rushing comets, like rays of light. Nothing touched him. His broken bare feet didn’t step on broken bare glass.
At least not until he was far into adulthood…too far to acknowledge what he'd been missing out on, yet at an age where he could objectively appreciate what he found and what he felt.
As a mediator between the villagers and the pedestal they had placed his husband on, John was quick to recognize the early signs of his mate in crisis; the furious research, the mania of a case, followed by the long, still silences, the frustration of unfulfillment, so obvious now that he’d seen the worst of it in Norway.
He would follow because, for a split second, he had misplaced those long, gangly limbs as belonging to someone else, someone that had been long dead for four years, and that split second was all his convictions needed.
Sherlock draws away and looks down. John is not going to give up. John will not allow Nachash to win. There must be another way. There has to be.
“I believe you felt these things, John, but you still seem to be belabouring under the delusion that I allowed this to happen because I could not stand the sight of you. In truth, you couldn’t be more incorrect, and despite what I have said I don’t think you’ve heard what I’ve been saying at all.”
“You know,” Harry reflects after a moment, “the craziest thing about that was that you weren’t even wearing a seatbelt the whole time…”
When his messages had stopped coming and his mail remained empty for weeks, Sherlock had gone to ground, hiding himself in his flat, obsessively trying to work at their connection. Their bond had been shut off, and he could find no logical reason for it other than John had been killed, by one of their own or by the army as a dissenter or a traitor; he still hesitated to think of those long and endless nights, too ill to eat so he would worry at his own wrist, sustaining himself in the interim. A fruitless and barren week went by and then he received a telegram, addressed to him from Warsaw and blank save for one word: Amsterdam. He’d bought the next overnight train ticket available, and spent the entire trip pacing up and down the corridors.
“Will you then?” Sherlock makes a noise of frustration and cards a hand through his hair. What is it about John that made his thoughts so unloquacious? “I mean…will you tell me the truth?”
The Voice cannot be trusted. If they tell you one thing, you must expect that they always mean something else.
"Hello, sir." She began, trying to keep her voice even. Having a gun waved in your face had not been entirely uncommon in her youth, but she had thankfully managed to forget the feeling until now. "If you are at leisure, could you please come downstairs, please? There is a—um—a parcel waiting for you."
“I made it a point in my line of work to be attentive to detail, so allow me to share with you what I’ve found. To begin with, your flat is far too nice for a graduate student, even one of your age and skill, to afford, especially in this part of London, so you must have come by it through an inheritance or you have another line of work. I’d already deduced that you and I were of the same breed: we have various experiments lying about, we work best alone—I believe you referred to me as singular? a phrase which struck me as rather odd until I remembered that individuals, upon meeting someone new, will often project aspects of themselves onto the other in conversation in order to test the waters so to speak and see how well that projection is received—and we also share a taste for Vincent-Girardin montrachet wine, which often runs around 250 quid a bottle, and I do so appreciate your generosity in pouring me a glass, really you could have offered me a chardonnay worth £5 from the corner shop and I’d never know the difference, but you do have a habit of leaving both your bottle’s label showing and a guest unattended with a phone that has working Internet. As to the monetary element, you allowed me enough time to get a good look at the photos in your hallway, or lack thereof as you only have framed certificates, odd for a man of your age to have no pictures of sentimental value, isn’t it? But upon closer inspection—and, as a constructive criticism, you really must open your wine faster and keep your guests within eyesight more frequently—I realised that many of the certificates were out of date, at least in context with your age. Were you really a graduate of the class of 1923 at Cambridge? Obviously the presence of the framed items are to give the appearance of normality, yet aren’t supposed to be scrutinised so closely, so there’s no sentimental value to you, and the lack of personal pictures rules out inheritance. Surely, if Aunt Helen loved you so much to give you a house and enough to pay for rent and expensive wine, you’d have a picture somewhere. I must infer, then, that either you have no close relations or that you look astoundingly good for a man who is about to become a centenarian.
Mikheia stretches, yawning as he shakes out the stiff coldness before heading into the den. John shuffles after him.
Eventually, his tricks became expected. He failed with increasing frequency to draw Sherlock from his moods, and they became blacker. The windows began to frost in the morning, and by the first snow John was walking alone, feeding alone, and sleeping alone, with few exceptions.
“He came after you, Sherlock.” John murmurs, and he feels warm hands on his knees. “He came after you
"Let's have it, then," He said, gesturing to the bottle, which Sherlock handed him. He knocked the cap off and took a deep pull, wiping his mouth. "Come on in," he said, standing by to let them pass into the dark foyer.
"That'd be a sight, wouldn't it? I think he'd have the baker write something clinical like 'Congratulations on the Coital Bliss'."
Sherlock stares at him for a moment then deftly takes the rag off John's face, wiping at the remaining water with his own hand, which somehow seems cooler in comparison. As he draws it away, John wishes it had stayed longer. Hell, he wishes he was at the top of Everest or at the bottom of the ocean if it meant coolness.
day and night, seems like—until the married ones started disappearing. You can imagine what kind of chaos that brought, especially when the mayor’s wife turned up missing half her clothes, and then the next night he did too. Everybody had the same excuse, but no one seemed to make any sense of it: the gist of it was that the person they most desired appeared to them and seduced them into bed, but disappeared the next morning, usually having taken some trinket or jewellery or something valuable. So I get assigned to this town and its dirty little secret, and it’d be obvious to the newest hunter what I’m up against, even if it wasn’t to the town itself. People don’t usually believe in impossible things if it doesn’t benefit them, do they?”
"I've seen many things die. Many people. Some of them I even liked. I don't know what I would do if you became one of them."
“Any serious international criminal would have a network of contacts, especially one as big as Moriarty. It just makes sense. So I started off in the big places, Berlin, Paris, Moscow—though I should’ve realised if anyone could make a cross-continental trip in less than a day, you could’ve.”
Willing himself to calm down, he breathes in deeply and lets it tumble back out again. If anyone meant to rob him, they wouldn't find much of value. If they meant otherwise—he had his gun.
“Irene was right,” he said, and Sherlock tensed. “Nothing ever changes with us, and when it does, we don’t know what to do with it. We are, the both of us, just two idiots in love.”
"Well...I mean normally when someone asks you to kiss them, it kind of happens…as in one party doesn't suddenly get cold feet."
It’s quite hard to talk to John when everything he says sounds hostile, like he’s got a loaded gun on him and Sherlock’s a long-standing enemy who’s getting a morality lecture before he’s shot full of lead.
Plaster and wood crumple against their combined weight as John’s body breaks through it. He feels splintered wood and chunks of drywall slice and beat his skin, feels the opening of new wounds that will become old in moments. Azazel lands on top of him and he kicks out with both feet, catching him in the stomach and sending him flying back through the hole and smashing against a large bookcase by the balcony doors. Books and loose paper fall around him as he struggles to get up and John grips the edges of the ragged hole punched in the wall as he lifts himself back out of the wreckage. His palms slip on the roughened plaster, slick with atramentum that has nothing to heal. It smears over the pale paint and glistens in the dull light like a night sky reflected in dark water.
"—So I figured I may as well finish what he started." Moran grins. "Course, it's never too hard when there's a shag promised, is it? Even for you Holmes," Moran eyes him. "Even for The Virgin. But John Watson would have taken care of that, wouldn't he? And the way you rushed into the flat, it was like you thought you'd be late for the Revelation. Pity you missed it." He smirks. "And all it took was a crumpled shirt. Here I was, thinking you had more brains in your head than your cock."
Sherlock decides that, having no knowledge of either injury, he’d best not judge John’s measurement of pain. He carefully helps him into a sitting position, rubbing at his back and placing a line of easy kisses at his temple.
"Evening, gentlemen." A deep voice resonates from inside the tiger. "Or whenever you happen to be listening to this. I trust it came into your hands quite easily, Sherlock Holmes."
John aimed. A man in a crisp suit, walking out of the hotel. Roughly about 100 yards away. He adjusted the scope one click right.
Sherlock stares back at him, wordless. Wordless, because John has said all of the things that Sherlock has wished for in the dead of night, when he was alone and the house was asleep, as fervently when he was young as when it was yesterday, because John has validated all of those hidden feelings that he’s kept sheltered, that he’s tried to destroy but couldn’t, because John has reached in and revived a piece of him that he had vainly tried to kill with drugs and bitter callousness yet which lived on, starved and neglected but alive.
And then it began. Sometime in March, near the end of his second tour, his story started. On his last mundane entry, he talked of needing more swabs and antiseptic and then mentioned that he would see action soon since the numbers were running a little low due to those leaving at the end of their tour.
“He is an angel, technically. He’s a Watcher, like me, and the ancestor of Seth, who was the father of the rebel angels. An antideluvian to the core.” John catches Sherlock’s stare, furrowed brow and hard eyes as if he’s trying to remember something. “Did you delete that?”
Sherlock frowned at his wording, but knew there were bigger things to worry about, and filed them away for later.
"When I was 17, I tried to cheat a man that was older and wiser than I was. I was not the smart kid that I am today, see. He—he had me taken to an old cigarette factory and I was beaten very badly. I was still useful so they did not want to kill me, but the man, he got red eyed, thirsty for blood, and, to teach me a lesson, he took a red hot poker out of a fire, and—and he—" Mikheia stopped, unable to continue. He ran a hand through his hair and then held both hands out, clenched into fists, and mimicked something being shoved through his chest.
Irene's smile faded, and a distant look came into her eyes, the same look of a war-weary soldier asked to relive the glory days of battle that was nothing more than an uncontrollable riot of fear and violence, death and blood. Nothing more than a brutal, merciless struggle towards survival. No more than the instinctual, reflexive grab for life.
He kept his eyes shut as he woke. He hadn’t expected to, and consciousness came slowly, like a rolling fog tumbling into the void.
Then it snarls, revealing rows of blackened, rotted teeth and bleeding gaps where some once belonged, and a roar rips from its desiccated throat as it charges at him with unnatural speed and he knows he's royally fucked long before it raises a clawed paw to strike him down.
he once possessed. It wasn’t decent, that goodness. Too incorruptible and uppity; too superior. He had to revise his definition of good when he was at war, when he realized that life is not black and white, no one all good and no one all bad. Well, almost no one.
, he’s right here…he can’t…help me, Mycroft, you’ve got to help me. He’s getting heavier, he’s sinking, come on.”
“Careful, John.” Azazel says with a cold grin. “If you’re going to talk like that, you’d better be sure your fortress is secured.”
So it didn't surprise him when the local hospitals called after being swarmed with E.R. patients and asked him if the clinic was willing to work as a temporary base. And it was no surprise when John, one of the few trauma doctors around, was assigned to handle the severe cases. He was the best equipped after all.
to take me for granted, Sherlock Holmes. And instead, you’re what? Drowning in your own sorrow and self-pity?”
The stub still smoking, he grabs the football and his hunting rifle, slinging it over his shoulder as he starts to whistle.
He turns and blocks the punch suddenly flying at his face. Sherlock whirls on him again, tossing the phone at him.
"Unnecessary." Sherlock proclaims, waiving him off as he reaches for the rotating light above him, turning it to focus on Rachel's left hand.
“You don’t know.” John repeats and Sherlock can hear the twine of frustrated anger in his voice, stretched taut and hard. “Bollocks, you know everything. In that great head of yours, you don’t know why you attacked your—your best friend, dislocated his shoulder, and tried to gouge his eyes out?”
Water molecules aren’t created anymore. They all leapt into existence on the planet in one go. Every single drop of water on this roiling, green rock has been recycled through everything that drinks it. The dew that graces the grass once touched the lips of kings and their queens, whores, orphans, murderers, lions, Tenebests, passed from Jesus to Shakespeare, roses to clouds, and then to John and then him. If he cupped a handful of that water, he’d be holding the ages in his hands, all the sweat and tears and piss of the famous and the unknown alike. If he cupped that water, it might hold a single molecule of John inside. He could hold John in his hands, if he wanted.
That had Sherlock's attention. His eyes flicked up to John's face before settling back down, a small, melancholic smile coming to his face.
Sherlock isn't listening. He's collapsed at John's side, untying him as fast as he can before John slumps forward in his arms.
"I feel that I should state that I am as equally partial to sexual intercourse as I am to lying next to you and doing nothing but looking at you."
Sherlock could see it in John's eyes, see it in the lines forming around them (not visible yet; give it a few years), see it in the creases of his forehead and his posture and his slightly more reserved taste in clothing. He could see it in the fact that John failed to mention how this nice employee at the front desk had also offered him her number and he had kindly refused, which was both like and unlike John. Did this woman—this
"Perhaps I should considering creating an undead creature to do my bidding because I'm afraid of looking at myself for what I am."
John kisses him back, something sharper, harder, lining his affections. Something hopeful and terrified.
. You could tell the weaker blood from the better ones; it felt thin and watery, less substantial, and frankly put, the high wasn’t as good.
They stand still for a moment in the soft glow of the flat before John takes a deep breath and steps away.
The two now sat at the tiny table that they had crammed into the kitchen so long ago, before the schism split the gulf between them and that bitter black longing poured in until it overflowed. Two mugs of hot tea were in front of either of them, but only one actually drank it.
The dark room stirred with thin, spicy smoke, the wisps trailing from a hand-rolled cigarette dangling from a stubbled, bloodied mouth.
The professor’s accent was odd as well; his German was excellent, but certainly not native. It was more difficult to tell with his friend – he hardly said a word, other than to order his coffee or quietly respond to the other man.
“Did you know they were here? When I took the case, the client spoke of a rabid hound. Did you think then—”
"Well, drink up then." John said, motioning to the untouched cup. "I was told by a nice employee at the front desk that the coffee was very good for stressful mornings."
A package was waiting on his stoop, thin, wrapped in plain parchment. He felt a pinch in his chest as he saw the familiar scrawl.
John groaned from under him and Sherlock drew back, blocking the sun from John's face. As John looked up at him with great blue eyes in his great, perfect confused face, Sherlock felt a fantastic and beautiful friction in his heart as it scraped against his flint chest, a beast awakening from its long and terrible hibernation.
Slowly, the stillness of the room began to wrap itself around his throat, the deafening roar of silence shoving itself in his ears until he was practically choking on it, until he was mad with it, why him, why now, why, why—
“He did call, good deduction there, because he found out we were attacked last night and he was worried. He’s not as uncaring as you think, you know. And…well, we have a bigger problem.”
"Yes, I would. My soul has been cleansed, purged in the fire. I've struck gold, see. I can't be harmed."
That doesn’t stop the hope churning in his veins like gasoline as he paces the hall. He’s waiting for the match to light. Waiting to see John’s face, to see his eyes open and make him burn.
The last shelf, started but unfinished as of late, is for John. Of course it is. He fears it will remain unfinished. Somewhere, crouched out in his cold escape, he can feel it. A fear that creeps up like an influenza, slowly and with a building heat. He might just be waiting for the day for the fever to come upon him, and he can crash through the roof of Enlightenment and bury himself so far down into the floor that he’ll never get back up. Maybe he can add another shelf for John. He’d like that, nothing and no one had ever been allowed more than one shelf before, in Enlightenment; if the shelf space was full, he’d simply built it upwards, reaching towards the ceiling. This was why the glass house of poisonous plants stretched its arms far higher than the meagre, squat case of 72 neatly placed tobacco samples.
John didn’t answer. Sherlock glanced up at him: his head rested against the counter, mouth slightly open, the ends of his fangs just pointing through. His eyes were closed.
He was no Kevorkian, but he knew a terminal case when he saw it, and the family that sat on that plain sofa in front of him would have to pay, would have to deal with years of repaying their bills and debts to prolong something he could end for them now.
?” His face drops, carved with lines of disgust and cold anger. “Because I know what will get you in the end, and it’s not the drugs and it won’t be on some run-of-the-mill crime bust gone bad. It will be madness. Madness, because the great Sherlock Holmes tried to solve an unanswerable question.”
He glanced up from his plate. Sherlock was leaning back in his chair, food untouched, watching him over the rim of his glass as he drank, smiling like butter wouldn't melt in his mouth.
He stares up, head tilted back to stare into the globe of light. There will never be a perfect sphere or circle. It’s mathematically impossible. Most things are, and other forces continue to perpetuate the myth that they aren’t. If you turn a gyroscope fast enough, the center pillar appears to remain in place, keeping the whole operation from collapsing in on itself.
He exhales heavily through his nose. He is getting upset over material things that mean nothing to him. What does he care if they danced around in his underwear and did the hula?
The chair he’s strapped to begins to whir and he realises belatedly that it’s the same kind as one found in a dentist’s office. He can do nothing but wait until he’s brought up into a sitting position, the light blaring into the sensitive tucked away pains in the back of his head.
“And because of whom do you think that was the case?” Mycroft says tightly. “John was not omnipotent, he was a man…just a man. Didn’t you ever stop to question
like it was a locked, windowless room with a body in it, so it bloody well looks like yours includes me as well. Now, if that’s what you want, you will tell me everything,
“I can’t believe he did this.” John hisses quietly. “We have rules concerning your kind. We aren’t supposed to hurt you, or get involved.”
“I’m not asking him to, I just want to—to—I don’t know. I don’t want him to be like this. I don’t like it. It’s not healthy.”
"Our friend, the one whose home was burned down, I want to find him. See if there's anything on him."
And Mycroft, clever, brilliant Mycroft, had found a way to communicate to Sherlock John's safety the next morning without the danger and luxury of a phone call. To anyone else, it sounded like a faulty alarm clock or a phone ringer gone rogue, but Sherlock knew better. As soon as he heard the beeps sounding out through their—John's—empty flat, he grabbed the nearest paper and pen and scrawled out the message.
"I'd explain to you what state of mind I'm in right now, but I think you've already deduced that, haven't you?" John asked, rubbing at his eyes, before looking at Sherlock and gesturing. "Well, go on then."
Mikheia, laughing, helped him sit up as he turned him towards the wall. "Sorry! Just sit up and hold the headboard if you can." John sighed, but obliged, knowing it was admittedly the most comfortable position he could afford right now.
"You make everything lighter." He says quietly, thumbs brushing the soft insides of John's palms as he lays his head against John's chest. "You mute the noise."
John woke to a blinding light, his own personal sun burning through his eyelids and blaring into his vision. As he came to, he realised it wasn't the sun hovering in their room, but the bedside light, the shade removed so it blared all the brighter. It was raining, the night outside the open window was wet and cool, a damp, easy breeze waving into the room.
Then he had woken up to silence. That horrid quiet, so similar to the one that had lain between the coolling of the Earth and when man learned what name to call himself.
, and Sherlock couldn't change that and, for a rare time in his life, knowledge physically hurt him. John's resemblance of a life was a lonely one, and that was bad, very bad.
The room is certainly to Sherlock’s tastes, from the singular sofa—an exact replica of the one in his flat—in the middle of an empty room that’s filling with chaos at the corners, to the enormous walls of dark panelled shelves, cased in glass from prying eyes that will never see them, that house all of the facts and tricks he needs. Lockpicking shines like a well-loved trophy next to the ash wood box of analysed alphabetical samples of London mud from Westminster to Whitechapel to Whitehall. Pinned boards of poisonous flora, from belladonna and opium to oleander are tacked up, with neat little cards depicting their uses and toxicity are propped up across the room from charts demonstrating how to make nitroglycerin from kitchen items.
But he couldn't think about John now. That never led anywhere productive. They were night thoughts, best saved for when the sun went down or the lead was cold and he could let his mind breathe. Let himself ease into those memories like hot water, boiling and bubbling with John, only ever with John, the burn of his smile, the sound of his laugh, his -
He hadn’t changed much – a relief, all told. John’s biggest worry when he was away was that Sherlock wouldn’t take care of himself, would forget to eat or worse, eat something poisoned. Yet here he was, tall and lean as ever, with the same spark in his eye and the same ridiculous mop of hair.
It was quite strange to see it now, a reconstruction based on the model of a memory. There was more of an exaggerated flourish behind it, something that the original had not possessed, even in all its finery. He eyed the golden figurehead as they came up to the front of the prow, the line tittering in anticipation of the evening. A light orchestra was playing on the deck, harpsichord and violin together, and faint sounds of clinking glasses, laughter, were floating down to settle and sink among the choppy waters. At the foot of Justice, rendered in exquisite detail, the Lion of St. Mark’s looked on, guarding two cherubs locked in battle, arrows ready to pierce the heart of the other.
Busting out Gladstone was the easiest part. No one at the corral had much need for the older horse, but he still had a little spirit in him yet, and at a full gallop his stride could match any prize pony. John had called off at lunch, knowing he'd have nothing but idle hands if left to his own devices on the derrick, which hadn't yielded more than a handful of barrels all week. Although a dry well meant little bread come payday, his belly was full from breakfast, his mind was racing, and the day was too good to pass up playing another round of cards, drinking and waiting for something that might never come.
She gives him his wallet, christens him with his old credit cards, his I.D., his identity, his life.
. He wasn't there to stop John's feet from crossing the threshold, he wasn't there to stop John from opening his bedside drawer and finding John's own personally folded, presumed missing striped jumper, and he wasn't there to walk in and find John kneeling in front of his bed, clutching that jumper as if it was the only thing that mattered anymore. The camera's resolution wasn't high enough to show the wetness on John's face, but Sherlock was, if anything, excellent at insight.
"Mikheia," Sherlock strode over to the boy, picking up his discarded gun off the bench and handing it to him. "Take her and go."
Sherlock reaches out in front of him to pick up the phone, the motion smooth in execution but hesitant in nature. Lestrade understands that he is bearing witness to a rare event: Sherlock Holmes has been caught off-guard.
The agency would not allow Sherlock to live. If John couldn't do it, then they would find someone that would. He could tell them all sorts of stories. The target was a no-show, the shot wasn't clear, the risk of civilian casualties was too great—
you…and you killed him. You did this to him, gave me to him like a lamb for slaughter, you stabbed him in the heart...you just gave me the knife."
"You are right, though. I'm not an angel. We used to be called Nephilim." John says, leaving Sherlock's pseudo-accusation unacknowledged. "Sons of fallen angels and children of mortal women. By-products of not-quite-holy unions that began when lesser angels were sent to Earth to teach humans the truths of your world, although no one seemed to take into account just how beautiful human beings are, how warm and…" John swallows. "Alluring. The women called to them like water on a hot day, and their offspring suffered for it. Those born from the unions were known for their great strength and greater cruelty."
He sighs. What are they going to do with that information, taunt him about his crow’s feet? He’s been past all the hangups on growing older for years. They must already know it anyways, it’s not like he hid it well, or didn’t look his age.
His people stepped aside as he entered the tiny kitchen. They had been ordered to leave everything as it had been found until he arrived. He closed his eyes, and gathered his thoughts.
He’d known John’s life would have been boring without him, but this reaction was…extreme. Alarming, even. John was a creature of habit—personal hygiene was routine. This man before him was going against the grain.
"Sherlock!" John said, his voice strained, and he wrapped his arms around Sherlock as if he was desperately trying to prove to himself that this man was solid, not an entity.
"Do you think you'll grow a beard again?" He asked. John grunted from below the brim of his hat. "I rather liked it."
The capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina wasn't doing itself any favours in Sherlock's opinion. He doubted it would bother to differentiate itself from Novgorod or Moscow or Minsk. The post-Stalinist siblings tended to resemble one another in more than one way. The iron curtain had tried so hard at conforming them all into one in the darkness it cocooned them in.
The first time it happened, it was an accident. Or John told himself that it was an accident, but some deeper, unacknowledged voice in him quietly whispered at night that it might have been on purpose.
"No, I'm not." He said, so sure of himself and his convictions. "You know, I think I'll round up all your little friends and pick them off one by one. Your landlady first, since there's not much of her to play with. Then that friend of yours, that Detective Inspector you work with—"
The man doesn’t answer. Sherlock sheds his coat, handing it to Mycroft, who melts back into the shadows, watching, waiting to intervene if he goes too far. John isn’t to be seen.
what your path is, but Nachash made it a mixed blessing. He began to tempt your ancestors, made their thoughts bleed with vice until you knew what sin was. He robbed you of your purity. "
"Room 106?" A voice asks, stepping into the room. Molly's heart lurches. A cop. A cop who looks penitent. She casts a worried look over to Will, who straightens in his seat.
“How will we get the poison?” The lawyer asked. “It does not have to be said that it shouldn’t be traced to any of us at any rate.”
.” Sherlock hissed, turning on his heels. “I have told him before, a thousand times – I will not allow it. He’d be feeding you to the lions.”
"Isn't this cute?" Moran muttered into the dirt before he began to try and twist out from under John's boot.
“Oh my god,” John sighed, suddenly understanding. “You’re upset he didn’t pick you? Are we in primary school?”
"My name is John." The angel repeats, his head cocking curiously to one side as if Sherlock is a question he doesn't understand.
“But alas,” The man says, turning to where the light was shining, “your friend damaged my friend. What might we do about that?”
They all file through the gap and as Sherlock looks back to signal for Gladstone, he blinks and the gap is gone.
“You had to find someone with John’s name, you had to track down Kitty Riley and plan her murder in a jail cell, you had to plant bombs at the Yard, and on top of it all premeditate your arrest…that’s not indicative of someone who doesn’t think things through.”
?” Harry asked, flipping through records in her nightgown. Her fangs had just begun to ascend, poking through her lip after her morning meal.
He darts back downstairs, nearly skidding down the stairs in his haste, and snatches his phone from the kitchen counter.
Hope turned suddenly, the dark shape of his arm coming up, pointing at Sherlock, aiming for his head. John knew that stance all too well.
“You didn’t believe in John at first; you thought I was lying then too, until he showed you what he was. You ask me for proof now, when again you don’t believe me. Go see Mortimer if you doubt me so much. I don’t crave your acceptance or your approval. Go to him for your own reassurance but I’ve given you all that I can, so just leave me alone already. Your
“…And your counterpoint to my concerns is that great men do terrible things over small matters.” John looked at him then, staring into the deep grey hue of his eyes, flickering over his face before resting on his hands, still clasped to his mate’s chest.
Sherlock says nothing. He can't. He tightens his hold on John's hand and feels his head bow over the edge of the tub, brushing John's dirtied knee, as a low groan of agonised despair tears from his throat. He sounds like a dying animal, but god, that's just what he feels like. He's dying and he's not even the one bleeding.
Sherlock's answering smile carried the weight of three hundred years of unaltered affection. "You may be an idiot, but you're no dullard."
“No, John, no, I would nev—” Sherlock stops, unable to correctly phrase what his mind is yelling at him. “You saw what Mycroft had on the netbook in Stockholm.”
“Maybe – no – I don’t know. Surely we could offer a better future for life on earth than the way we are continuing now.”
“May as well extend it to the street, but just to the property line. No use holding up traffic. Are you busy with something?”
Smoke hissed from his nostrils, and he took a deep breath of fresh morning air before righting himself against the boat, coming to a balanced stand at the helm. Years of living on the water had taught him how to keep his footing even in the roughest of waters. He grasped the rudder in his hands, and guided it to the nearest channel, still darkened by the light of the oil lamps.
once. We’re in this together. He’s nearly killed you twice now, three if you count Gladstone, and that’s thrice as many times as I will allow. You’re in just as much danger as I am.”
The sensation warmed, a comfortable presence as it spread outwardly; the way it flexed, like a muscle stretching after rest, and then the way it felt, a caress and a reminder at once.
The flat is too quiet. All the lights are off and he stands at his window, scanning the fogged, translucent street for any signs of John.
Sherlock stepped closer, their chests almost touching. He said nothing, but their bond trembled with a racking coldness, as if it were shivering, and he knew that deep down, his mate was afraid.
Sherlock then turns in a huff to eye the scenery, small towns smoking and peaceful in the distance, nestled in the arms of the quiet hills around them. A wave of hot envy passes through him for a moment, jealous of their simplicity. What did they know about pain? What did they know about the suffering of the world? He was sure, even as he thought this, that he was wrong. Someone down there must have suffered as he did, or else someone beside him.
All those days of wondering, all those days of loneliness, and Sherlock had been just as alive as he'd ever been. How could John not have figured it out? How many times had he passed Sherlock in the street and not noticed? Relief should not feel this awful, knowing that Sherlock was alive and that the only thing separating them was an old brick wall. But it wasn't just the wall that separated them. It was circumstance. Sherlock was alive, and only because John had not killed him like he was ordered to.
Sherlock's hands slide up his face, tilting John's head up towards his own as he presses their mouths together, sealing back in whatever John is about to say.
“I can ask the same of you. If I’d known my brethren have let themselves be leashed like a loyal little guard dog…” Azazel taunts with a sardonic grin. “I might have come sooner.”
Two heartbeats passed as John and Sebastian stared at one another, neither moving but both breathing heavily. The adrenalin burned through them both, thick with blood. Moran's hands tightened on John's flour-stained collar and John could almost hear his thought process.
“Ridiculous,” he scoffed, turning to John, who was accepting two glasses of sangiovese under the guise of glancing at the attendees without raising suspicion. “That headdress is reserved for Chinese nobility. I doubt any of these servants have even been taught to
before he remembers that he was trying to explain his personal hell to the person that caused it. Beads of sweat are gathering at his forehead again and he presses his face to the washcloth for a moment.
it happened in the first place. But…I'd stopped chewing the gum then, hadn't I? I'd stopped the medication for something I didn't really need but my body thought I did."
Sherlock took in the vaulted wooden ceiling, the lone spherical light dangling from it, the plain white walls and plain, modest bed covered with a comfortable looking duvet. Things he could recognise from his earlier intrusion though they looked different in the light. All in all, in its quiet modernity and simple, refined taste, it was a significant leap up from where he and Mikheia were staying.
Sherlock takes a step. His death won’t stop him. That’s isn’t Nachash. He’s sure of it. It’s too easy, but it's
John. Where had John gone? Had he realised yet that Sherlock was not at his side? Surely he had. Wasn't that something that was immediately obvious?
They say nothing in the wake of rushing water. The bowl fills to the rim and Sherlock lets it overflow for a moment before reaching out slowly to turn it off, as if the pillar of water sucks his concentration down the drain with it. It seems for a moment as if he can barely muster up the energy to turn the tap off.
He was happily surprised to find that Mycroft had installed motion sensor lights in his lawn. Apparently his love of antique décor fortunately did not extend to security.
John ignores me. I march on, too far gone to care. Too far gone to salvage any part of myself I wanted to hide. I’m going to drown anyways. The storm outside rages. The cold and rain are seeping through the cracks.
Sherlock lurches forward, just managing to catch it before it hits the ground, the echo of the shattering that hadn’t occurred blooming in the passing seconds. He lets the frenzied fear dissipate before he straightens, fury lined in his face.
"I'm glad you're here, John." Sherlock said quietly as they broke apart, resting his head on John's as he shut his eyes, hoping John would read between the lines.
"Haven't you noticed my silences? My surrenders to the pyre as I toss bits of myself in? Haven't you noticed The Emptiness, Sherlock?"
." Sherlock says calmly, hands clasped in front of him as he leaned into his fingers. His thinking face. "
When the Golem, the man that struck fear into the hearts of millions, the man known for his unmerciful, fearless brutality, stepped into the light, he was not the man that Sherlock had once met. He was not inhumanly tall, his limbs were not long and gangly and his face was hollow, yes, but with something other than tall cheekbones and sharp facial features, hollow with the heaviness of a burdensome life. This Golem was no myth. He was a man. He was a man that Sherlock knew well, a man he valued above all others, a man he loved.
“Thank you for talking to him Irene, but our relationship doesn’t need yours projected over it. Stop using Sherlock as a proxy to fight whatever quarrel you have with your wife; you should go now.”
"They're very superstitious, the khylsts. It has to be a moonless night. The grave has to be fresh. The rooster must be a cockerel, and its throat must be slit before dawn." She turned to look at him, and he understood.
John doesn't pay attention to much after that. He knows they've won. Knows he can let Lestrade and Sherlock take over from here; that they can handle it.
The tree directly ahead was splintered; another, farther back, had the same damage. He turned, mapping the trajectory – the back door was nearly off its hinges, flapping about in the evening wind.
"If I called you an owl that'd be complimenting your looks I suppose, but not your intelligence since owls' skulls are occupied mainly by their eyes and leave little room for their brains, and it'd be a crime to call your brain tiny."
He strolled through the room, an observer in a museum of his own creation, marvelling at the preserved artefacts. Then he came to the end.
"If the word gets out that there will be more of these, the public will go into a panic." Lestrade says grimly.
“I agree.” Another voice added, and John turned to meet his mate’s eyes as he closed the hidden door, cloak over his arm. “Your strategy is rather sloppy.”
“It depends on who you ask, Sherlock Holmes.” Irene says, speaking with his voice and hers, smiling her smile with his lips. She does that with alarming frequency, the smiling. He’s starting to become annoyed by it. It’s her answer to everything.
As he pulls their teacher aside, a girl runs past their classroom window, screaming wildly, screaming—why is she screaming?
Sherlock hesitates before sending the next text. It's true though. He can't deny that John heard him admit certain things when he was still trapped in the fear that his doctor had been injured.
"Yes," John interrupts, ears going a bit red. "Thank you Sherlock, if you'll save the more colourful language for the flat where
“Molly, you’re not going to get in trouble. I’m not your father and right now I’m technically off-duty, so I’m not your boss either. I’m asking as your friend. A place like that isn’t exactly where I’d normally expect to find someone like you.”
The woman grins and shifts, resting her chin on crossed arms on the lid of the tub. "Oh, I'm sure it won't mind a little on the side."
"Nothing is incredible." Sherlock replied, long fingers idly playing with his glass. "Only observation, and logical conclusions." He knocked the rest back, a red flush cresting the edges of his cheeks. With the bandana out of the way, John could see a little constellation of moles and freckles dotting his throat. A very nice throat, pale except for the faint red mark of the rope.
Georgiy waves before picking up Mikheia’s coat and shrugging it on, donning his cap and grabbing his wicker basket, hauling it over his shoulder as he leaves to go into town.
With that, Sherlock retreats back into the room, leaving the door open as Gladstone trots in after him, tail wagging at the excitement. Greg can see him from the hall, leaning over what must be John, and the light cast over his face reminds him of a painting he once saw. It had been of something easily forgotten, an angel looking towards Christ or some other divine thing, but in that moment it’s all he can think of. Sherlock is looking at John like he’s saved him from some unearthly suffering. Like John’s his deliverance.
John can’t have survived. Sherlock had seen the explosion, felt the heat, heard the screeching metal and collapsing concrete as the inferno tore through terra firma, its violent birth raging before his eyes.
But as much as John respected Sherlock and all his eccentricities and privacy issues, John was curious, he was finally answering the call and killing the cat, and Sherlock couldn't stop him.
tell anyone what had truly happened. All they needed to know was that there was a body and John Watson had put it there.
"It's the air around you." Harry says from behind him. "Not an aura really, more like…a sense about you. The way you hold yourself, the way you want people to see you, it makes you blind to what you really are, or how you look. You scare people, Sherlock. You're intimidating. Doesn't mean you're a monster."
"Am I?" He laughed, walking over to the car. "It's your gun, genius. And now your fingerprints are on it too."
This chapter takes place at the same time as Sherlock and Mycroft's part in Chapter Six ("Ime"), but not John being pulled from the river (for obvious reasons; this hasn't become a sci-fi time travel fic...yet?).
He knows Mycroft is watching him. He didn’t hide his newest camera as well as the others, and it stares at Sherlock where it’s wedged between the corner of the kitchen cabinets and the ceiling. He stares back. He knows his brother won’t hesitate to meddle and he fully expects an unannounced visit in the morning.
Moran whistled. "Look who's touchy now. Isn't it odd, John, that we chose the battiest men in the world to dedicate ourselves to? I saw you, that night at the pool where little Carl died. Where Jim's portfolio began. You were ready to die for him. I'm no different from you in that regard."
"John—" Sherlock started, but was cut off as John kissed him, running his tongue lightly along the edge of his lip. He groaned, settling back into the seat before sliding back so he was lying all the way across the seat.
"No, I know who this bullet is for, Holmes." Moran said, tracing John's temple with the muzzle and missing Sherlock's stricken gaze. "I know it will destroy you even if you remain unharmed. There's no fooling me on this one."
They had come to Norway for a case; it had long been solved, but Sherlock had been asked to be kept on retainer in the countryside mansion of one of the nobles, and John had convinced him to stay, expecting a new adventure to begin imminently, as they usually did.
“Oh yes, he’s a faceless lackey for the government, which is where he takes after Mycroft, and is astoundingly precocious, which is where he takes after me.”
“You’ve not been here long,” he hisses, “but normal humans don’t shout loud enough to rattle the walls. London’s not experienced an earthquake in recent memory; let’s not change that.”
“Yes he can.” John wheezes, eyes opening and watery with pain. “Yes he can. He’ll keep using me to get you.” Then, what he never wanted to hear: “Kill me, Sherlock. You have to.”
Narrowing his eyes, John looked at his husband, supine on the couch, ready for an almighty sulk. But there was something else there, something he couldn’t quite see. Something he thought he’d forgotten, but was becoming all too clear that it was still there, just under the surface.
The wind rushes past his ears, cold and fresh in his chest, and he's missed the feeling. He feels it part as his wings come down and up, pushing him through the fog and clouds that hang over the night.
“I haven’t forgotten.” Sherlock said lowly, and John knew that the subject would have to wait a little while longer before he brought it up again.
"The Soviet Union was disbanded two decades ago, sir. Therefore I can go wherever I wish. It is the beauty of a non-Communist state, see. Free travel and all that."
"As there was Jim Moriarty," Sherlock said quietly, "so there too were his helpers. Moran…and Morstan."
"I had been having help from the covenant." Artemisia said as they climbed. "That is how you say that, yes?”
"Shh." She soothes, smoothing down the hair at his temple before pressing her lips to his. Every cell in his body seems to revolt at the touch when a day ago he would have welcomed it. Now all he can do is think of Sherlock and how much more he wants him here.
There is a ragged, dark hole torn in John's chest, gaping like the wet mouth of a cave. If he hadn't moved in front of Sherlock, if he hadn't gotten in the way, Sherlock would be watching his own heart pumping out blood in front of him on the wet grass, just as John had said. If. If. If.
“Not that I could see, no. But it was so weird…when I got closer to it I thought I started smelling engine oil of all things.”
“Quite.” He answers, and he knows she noticed his glance over her. He’s planned for her interest. “I don’t make it a habit of repeating myself.”
He’d barged into Mycroft’s office—the Diogenes Club rules be damned—after hearing of one of his more recent abductions of John, and precisely told his brother about John Watson.
“Then you’re aware of the difficulties we’re facing. We’ve had…a lot to come back from, things we’re still working out. But it’s still better than it used to be, and Irene has no business twisting the knife she put there herself, and neither do you.”
, the long-scuttled and treasured lagoon barge of the past doges of Venice, ripped to pieces and burned for its gold by Napoleon—burned for three days in all. He’d had the underwhelming pleasure of sailing on the bloated thing a few times before but had lost count somewhere in the seventeenth century. He found its gilded veneer to be too loud, its passengers too stiff before the drinks and too unpredictable after them to be very enjoyable. John, on the other hand, had been right at home.
Sherlock stood, beginning to pace about the tiny chamber. “We both are aware that I am not the best communicator of feeling, John, but I will try to be now. I need you to tell me what I can do for you, how I can help you, how to fix this.”
John's left the agency behind him (not that they're letting go), and must face the effects of his torture.
"No, I'm merely saying that I would prefer revenge since what led you here can apparently take you back. I don't have the power to send you away; that's Sherlock's decision, and I would favour that it remains his, not someone else's'." Mycroft stares at him for a moment, his fingers tapping the arm of the chair. "Who do you answer to, John?"
He treads carefully on the shining floor, bleached like sand, as he glancing into the darkness of each anteroom as he passes, heading towards the light at the end of the hall.
"Yes, yes, a nice quiet place like this—" Sherlock mutters, but as he has little tolerance for small talk and even less talent for it, he abruptly stops walking, turning to face the other man. "Allow me to stop you a moment. I want to make one thing clear: although I may not be an agent, I am an entity of the FBI, which gives me certain measures of authority. When the Bureau is called in, the Bureau is in charge. I am in charge. I hope for the sake of this investigation that I have your full cooperation."
“Yes, you can.” John answered, fixing him with that familiar look, the one that told him there would be no opportunity to compromise. Sherlock didn’t argue – he drank the rest, licking the residue off his fingers.
Just yesterday, they’d had so much time. He’d had days, months, years worth of John. So much time to learn everything he’d wanted to, to plumb the depths of who John was, what made him laugh, what made him angry, and only now, now that he’s gone, Sherlock realizes he had learned nothing. John had known everything about him, and he had learned
"I have to apologize for these lights again," The lab assistant says apologetically. "I think it's a bad transformer."
Sherlock closed his eyes, thinking back on what could possibly have made John so cross, so suddenly. When he came in from work an hour ago he seemed quite peaceful, so something happened between then and now that made him irritable. He had found a human thumb wired to a potato in the fridge before he made dinner, but that wouldn't faze him anymore, much less make him angry. Angry was a word he didn't usually use when he thought of John. John was irritable, annoyed, cranky or upset, but he was never
“Listen, Sherlock,” He starts. “I know going home tonight will be difficult, but will you promise me you’ll get a good night’s rest?”
"Don't worry, you didn't break any rules or anything." John smiles. "I hide them in crowds, in case they attract too much attention. Walking with you on the street is fine, but in dense areas I don't want to risk a mob if suddenly everyone sees my wings and thinks I'm some divine archangel."
A quick glance through watering eyes proved to Sherlock what he already suspected, that Mikheia had thrown himself through a window by the quickly heating metal stairs, not quite between the first and second floors.
John looks up at him and sets his fork down as his face scrunches in mild bemusement. In the light, Sherlock can see faint swirls and smudges of black beneath John's skin, almost like veins, as if someone had drawn on his insides with a pen. His wings flutter happily in the warm cosiness of their booth, shaking off the dark rainwater.
He stood at the desk for a moment, fingers reaching out to run along the grooves and marks on the old wood.
“You certainly seem to be treating it that way.” He responded lowly, unable to keep the slight tremor from his voice. At least, thankfully, it hadn’t cracked.
"You're in a mood," Sherlock sniffed, sounding rather put-out. "Gladstone, as I'm sure you saw, is just fine outside."
“Crêpes.” Greg’s brow shoots up in surprise at such an easily conceded compromise. “Okay, well, I—uh—I’ll get on that.”
John cleaned off the blood on his fingers, biting at the pads of his hands. The room smelled of deer urine and wild blood, the fluids puddling under the cheap fluorescents. A cold wind blew through the open door.
It had been miserable for the both of them: Sherlock, stuck in Berlin, surrounded by the worst dregs of humanity, the terrors of fascism, blind incompetence, and ignorance, and John, volunteering to pull bodies from the rubble, clearing streets on a night crew, slowly going mad from the constant blood before he’d finally had enough of sitting home alone in the dark listening to sirens and anguished screams, and enlisted again. Suicide by proxy.
Sherlock frowned, his expression surely mirrored on John’s face. The hairs on his neck began to rise again.
"The—" Sherlock cut off, unable to continue, but gestured to John's back, annoyed at his inability to speak those few words that gave a name to what John had suffered through.
Slim fingers nudge at the ridges of his spine. He flinches at the contact, the cool touch tickling his bare skin.
John is starting to gasp in air. He can't seem to do it fast enough, and each breath leaves him struggling for the next. He feels a cold sweat dampen his hair to his neck and face.
Silence also tended to be a cruel mistress. It was cold and quiet, leaving his questions unanswered, always reminding him of the body that should be filling that space, of the warm words that should brush the silence of his world away, dispersing it into the air and that slow smile that meant everything was alright.
Hands were at his temples, his ears, examining them for damage, turning his head gently yet it lurched like a boat on choppy water.
"Yes, you do. You do many things for many reasons; you are not a man who does anything because he simply doesn't know better. Why?"
But Sherlock was prone to leap off buildings at impossibly heights and survive. A train would be child's play for him if he had truly planned it out, if he had known that he was going to leave again, leave him, leave John out in an empty compartment without so much as a goodbye.
The lights turn off, and John wants to cry in relief. His mind is so overwhelmed, so awash with feeling, that his head is shaking, tremors running up and down his spine. He shuts his eyes, but the light follows, swimming in his line of sight no matter how much he wills it away.
“There are over 400 men in the duma, in a rapidly crumbling empire that are desperate to gorge themselves still while the country starves. Where do you think?”
"It's always the ironic twists that get me, you know. Sinners dying at the hands of the wronged. It's wonderful, really."
John smiles that stupid little knowing smile of his that sends warmth passing over Sherlock’s mind like sunshine bursting through the clouds on a foggy day.
She looked at John and smiled. Men had killed to have that smile directed at them, and for even less than that. John stared at her silently, unmoving. Letting out a weary sigh, she leaned forward to pour herself a thick drink from the pewter flagon, then knocked it back in one go.
“And how long have the two of you been conspiring to do that?” He said, narrowing his eyes. “John enlisted you to chastise me that what I am doing is not productive or right, to scold me like a boy caught stealing sweets. Please, talk to me like I know no better, and
“This is Molly.” Lestrade says, indicating the girl as she nods to Sherlock. “She’s our intern. Forensics.”
The dogs are barking furiously, straining at their leashes to break away and run towards their sought-after prize. Sherlock sympathizes.
Donovan moves to stand as if to diffuse the outburst she expects to be coming, but there is nothing. Sherlock stands as still as ever behind her, staring at Moran with…blankness. No anger, no disgust, no interest, no
Sherlock’s head rolled towards him, and the look in his eyes told him that his assumptions had been correct. John began to shift in his lap and his hand came up as if in reflex to stroke John’s face.
There is also a torn piece of paper half a foot to the right with the inscription—most likely in blood—'Fire Walk With Me'. Immediately below is the word 'rache', R-A-C-H-E, carved into the floor."
Sherlock Holmes, very much alive and very much irritated, stared in exasperation at his new contact.
The line clicks off and John places the phone back in Lestrade’s pocket, straightening up to look back out the window, where the sun dips behind the silhouetted horizon. A figure is dark against the glass, standing on the balcony, unmoving. Waiting.
Everything, everything and nothing was at once so funny and so sad he didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He could taste the hot iron tang of blood on his teeth.
occasionally, they overlap and meet each other with near-impossible precision and what you hoped would happen actually happened.
"The mistress deigns to greet her lowly subjects." Sherlock intoned lowly. "Something is rotten in the state of Denmark."
“If you think for one moment that Mycroft doesn’t have perfectly capable agents already in place, then you’re being deliberately obtuse.”
"The name, damn you!" He snarled, as Hope cried out, clutching in vain at the widening red stain spreading beneath his shirt.
than have you go first." Sherlock growls lowly. "If you are not in my life, John Watson, then there is no point to it. Everything I've done, everything I do or will ever think of doing, it is so that you may
He’s babbling. Oh god. He’s babbling. Now that he’s said it he can’t stop and it’s like watching a trainwreck during an outer-body experience.
“Sherlock,” he sighs, weary with the tone of one who’s all too familiar with his nature, “just give me what I came here for. And for God’s sake, be discreet.”
Sherlock had managed to clear the shelf in record time through a decisive combination of kicking at the debris and swearing loudly before squeezing himself through the gap as soon as he could.
John manoeuvres him to the bed and pulls the sheets over him, tucking him in, but when he turns to leave, Sherlock grasps his arm.
"Did you think I was stupid, Sherlock? Is that it? That my puny little brain couldn't possibly catch up to your massive intellect and I'd just wait on the train with a bloody
He had been wrong: he did not want to die. He wanted to live, with John, wherever he wanted to go. If John wanted to drag him off to the most remote corner of the globe, he wouldn’t argue. He wanted to be with him, forever, as long as possible. He was a fool for thinking otherwise, for considering for even one moment that he didn’t want to see John, his smile, his laughter, fight with him, bicker over petty things, hold him close, feel him nearby.
She rolls her eyes, and shoves the door open. Striding around to the other side of the car, she reaches out to open Mortimer’s door, only to find it locked.
Something inside him aches at the thought of the empty space where John should be, the feeling not dissimilar to the cold reverberations of a stuck metal pipe, shivering through his insides like ice.
His foot catches against the cabinet as he struggles for purchase on anything other than slippery floor.
"And you aren't goaded into arguments easily." Moriarty answered slyly. "What was it that I said that made you want to play? Was it the skinning of our good doctor, or was the image of me fucking him just too much for you?"
It looked to take all of Sherlock’s ability to suppress his natural reflex to roll his eyes. “I think I know what I would or would not do. I’m asking you.”
If possible, John’s eyes narrow further. Wrong hypothesis, negative results, you’ve done it again, Holmes. Well done. The water at my feet shines as the light brightens against parquet tiles. The storm rages outside.
“Salt shakers.” Moran repeats. “Cruets. I’m sure you’re familiar with them.” He relaxes against his chair and looks up at Lestrade. “I’m done now, Detective. You can tuck me in now. Be sure not to scrimp on the bedtime story.”
The second time Sherlock had proposed, nearly two years had passed. They had not discussed it since the topic had first come up, but John had known, had always known, that despite his reservations, he would let Sherlock talk him into it, as he did with most everything. And Sherlock knew—as
"Careful," John says, his voice snapping him out of his thoughts as he flips another crêpe. "Your possessiveness is showing."
“I—you know, since the car park, some days, when I feel very…dark, my black moods—and maybe it’s from my injury, maybe it’s some kind of PTSD recurrence, I couldn’t bloody care why, because it doesn’t change the fact that it happens— I feel…empty. I feel like I’ve failed everyone, you, Georgiy, Sherlock, my friends back home, everyone I’ve ever met. I feel like I’m a burden. A disappointment. And…I think, maybe some people would have been better off without that.”
He stared at John and John stared back and in that moment, he felt protected. He felt impenetrable, untouchable,
“Yeah, when you’re not bursting into spontaneous combustion from the heat I bet the scenery’s quite lovely.” Harry snickered.
Sherlock seems to take this into consideration, puffing away silently at what remains of his cigarette.
As he read off his information for the booking, he glanced over at the window, where he could just see the sea, churning under the moon. It made him think of Sherlock, the last time they were together. The moon hanging over Paris.
When John had discovered him alive in the water, he had gone into a frenzy. It had been one of the greatest events, in magnitude, of Sherlock’s life. He’d watched, injured and immobile on the banks of the river, as his husband, his bonded, had not only torn their adversaries to shreds but utterly destroyed them. It had been terrible, and fascinating, as if he were staring at the sun in its moment of brightest glory, and even if he had been blinded, he would never forget the sight of it.
She smiles ruefully. “There’s no way—you can’t know.” She shakes her head as if to throw off the memory, and looks at him. “It’s something your world won’t understand, even if you wanted to know. You can’t comprehend what it’s like, and how heavy the burden is once you’re out from under it. Here, it’s so…so
“I always had a weak spot for the opera, and classical music.” Irene says, breaking Sherlock from his reflection. “James plays it for me sometimes. That Rachmaninoff earlier was a treat. He knows what I like.” She shoots a lascivious wink at him. Mortimer doesn’t notice.
, like he belonged there in that small, cramped space of Sherlock's heart, and Sherlock belonged in his, although he was getting the better deal, as John's was roomier.
“What, the English word?” She asked, but John knew she wasn’t so naïve. “Translation is one thing, pronunciation another. I will have to be making mistakes until I learn the intricacies of your language—”
They are running away from the sun, tripping over stone walls, and he’s falling in the air, down into the pulsing water. He feels himself smack the surface as it parts under his weight and he begins to sink.
John had seen him out at the empty porter’s booth, barely bothering to dress for the weather, his hair mussed and cowlicked. They’d had many partings just like this, in the lightening hours of dawn, one of them stepping outwards and the other staying put; they were well practiced in public goodbyes.
"Feeling a bit peaky, are we?" John asks calmly with a raise of his eyebrows and subsequently ducks the embroidered pillow Mrs Hudson made them as Sherlock tosses it at his head.
He took the offered wine and followed John through the crowd to the stern, where guests were expected to toast the man of the hour in ceremonial reverence before ceding themselves entirely to bacchanalian depravity. Cadorin, famed though he was, held little interest to him, and he raised his glass, parroted John’s wishes for another year of good health beneath the midnight canopy, and spat the wine out of his mouth over the side of the deck once they were out of sight.
. He ran his hands along Sherlock's thighs, smooth and pale like marble, but pulsing with heat. A hand scrabbled at his and intertwined the fingers it found—
One moment they were standing side by side in the lift, in their still silence as they rode upwards, and then, as the doors opened as the elevator jumped to a stop, Sherlock looked at John like he had made up his mind about something, grabbed the curve of John's jaw and pulled him into one of the most beautiful kisses of either of their lives.
“Just trying to help.” John hummed, and though the images lessened, they didn’t disappear, receding into an even flow in the back of his mind, washing at the edges. “Can you know for sure that these people would become what you think they would? Did you know them?”
tell me what he would want!” Sherlock snarls, bringing his face up to glare at his brother. “You have no right to dictate what he would
"What are those, then?" John asks as he comes beside the two men, shrugging on a pair of latex gloves.
Hurriedly, he strides after him, catching the edge of the door before it slams closed in front of him.
at the sight before him as a priest feels before Christ. He wants to prostrate himself at the murderer's feet, wash the blood off them and ask how they did it if only so he might
He's stopped as Sherlock tilts his head up and presses his lips against John's. John lets his eyes slide shut, a warm heaviness settling in his belly as he smiles.
He stopped when he put his hands in the pockets of the robe, feeling something small and circular. He drew it out, holding it to the light. A piece of wood? He looked closer, felt the density of the thing, and froze.
"Well you got one," John pointed out, gesturing to Hope's body, the blood sinking into the sand. "He ain't gonna mind."
"How are they?" Sherlock asked quietly as the train rocked like a calm ocean, breaking the hour's silence.
Henry is waiting outside a large train car, clearly long abandoned and looking as if it was half burned down, ready to collapse in with the next hard rain.
Sherlock makes love to him then. John had been wrong to call it lovemaking before; that had just been sex, something to take up their time and pour their feelings into. This is making love. This is caring for someone, for showing them you love them, for showing John that they are now inexplicably bound in the way Sherlock looks at him as he twines their hands together in the space above John's head. Sherlock's gaze widens in a sweet look of amazement, as if he is astounded that John has agreed to this, to being his, and he releases himself, everything that he is, into him. He shudders and feels John wrap warm arms around his shoulders, grazing at his neck and face the way women do in Renaissance paintings, light and heavy all at once, a caress and a blessing, as John's body arches into him. Sherlock dips his head, grazes his lips over the salty hollow of John's throat before kissing him. John replies lazily, pliant from orgasm, and Sherlock tastes fulfilment on his tongue.
Mortimer deflates, his defences lowering, and has the good grace to look ashamed. "Right. Sorry. I just—I thought that—"
“You’ve had ample opportunity.” He said, ignoring the barb. “I can’t imagine our whereabouts have been a secret.”
He moves forward without any plan, if only to throw himself over John and slow down the wolves before they hurt him more (he's not foolish enough to think he can stop them). He grabs at John's dropped metal pipe and stands in front of him, wielding it without having a clue of what his next move will be.
“‘Whom’.” Sherlock corrects, eyeing the staircase set discretely in a darkened corridor near the back of the club. “And I do.”
“I did nothing I regret.” John answers solemnly. “He’s more than meat to me. He’s worth it. If we didn’t do anything but breathe and blink in one minute, it would be worth a thousand lifetimes of Sheol as long as he was there and he was mine in that moment. He will always be worth climbing out of that pit. We all have our reasons for wanting to get out. You’ve got yours, and he’s mine.”
Sherlock sighed, exhaling smoke into the rushing wind from his isolated spot in the back of the train. Apparently they had been fortunate enough to book one of the last trains that still had an open air carriage and it was, of course, bound for Sarajevo.
Sherlock felt as if someone had grabbed his stomach in their fist and squeezed, forcing all the blood from him. He wanted to hurt something.
The door bangs open behind him. He turns as Lestrade comes out and jerks his head towards his office before he strides off down the hallway, haggard and exhausted in the way of someone using all of their might to go absolutely nowhere.
She pulls her car off the road a little ways into the thicket, far enough away for anyone passing by to avoid hitting it, maybe even noticing it. She rests her head on the wheel, cool to the touch. Her lungs seem to quiver, each breath wracking her body as she inhales thinly, shakily. No one else is left in the world who knows her like Rachel did. No one but Will.
I do intend to continue this by including a few extra standalone scenes from John and Sherlock's past, ones that I've either cut or have thought about including and never did. Expect those around the holidays - Thanksgiving or Christmas!
Steam rises up against cream tiles, filling the room with hot, heavy dampness. James Mortimer sits on the lidded toilet seat, sleeves rolled up, as Sherlock stands in the doorway, staring at two different coloured eyes as they gaze back at him.
But yes, the dream. He was in the foyer of his mind palace, just stepped over the threshold from being
His target had been a no-show. That happened sometimes. Plans were derailed, people cancelled on other people, someone decided to pop into the store or got caught in traffic. Various external factors all lead to a disappointing night and no pay.
This is why, when Mycroft gets a call from a frantic Mrs Hudson about the massive destruction inside of 221B—"Clothes out of the dressers, holes in the walls, plates smashed, it's an awful mess, really...is Sherlock alright?"—he knows why. And, furthermore, this is why he is not at all surprised, not in the least, which leads to Mrs Hudson opening the door to a cleaning crew a half-hour later by means of apology. He questions Sherlock, but he is silent on the matter and does nothing more than shift from angry glares at Mycroft to angrily staring out the window. Mycroft knows this is no mere temper tantrum. It's far more serious.
He hadn't paid much attention to the unused cigarette pack. Not since John's last birthday, when he'd been deciding on whether to call anonymously or not and subsequently worked himself into an agitated state before lighting a cigarette and then getting into a very heated argument with the landlady over his right to smoke inside. He'd thought that it was the least of her concerns considering the opium den two floors above and three rooms to the left that he told her of in so many words. He hadn't made many friends that day, but that was because his Mandarin was limited and he had been focusing all his attention on the only friend that he deemed deserved enough of it.
