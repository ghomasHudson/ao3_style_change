Burgess was tired of the office staff. Her friends were in danger, and she had to participate. Of course, she was scared, but that, in turn, made her adrenaline go up.
With a beating heart and small footsteps, Cas let himself be led, then heard a key that was turned around and felt a moment later that he was pushed forward.
"Listen," Dean said, sighing. "Nothing happened, you have to believe me."
"It's sexy," Dean whispered as he gently pulled on his husband's lower lip and loosened the loop in Cas's neck with his fingers because he did not have time to change. "But you like me so much better."
After a quick look into the blue, bright eyes, he slowly lowered his head and ran his nose along his chest, while his half-open lips made a wet trail, occasionally kissing, licking, or leaving soft bites in his skin. At his armpit, he made a short stop which made Cas grinning, and Dean answered that with a short laugh before he slid down.
"A firefighter. You said you had difficulties with your freight elevator. He might take a quick look, right?" He said, winking more than once.
It was not the pain but the shock that was in her bones. With crowbar and side cutter they tried to open the dented door. And it was loud. It was so loud that Sylvie almost lost her mind and was about to panic. Again and again, she inquired about her colleague, instead of worrying about herself, because from the hip down she felt nothing.
"Well, and now tell me again exactly what the doctor said."
"You owe me a favor," he muttered after half an hour, tucking his hands in his trouser pocket and ducking his head to protect himself from the cold wind. "Not even a dog would go outside in this weather!"
"I did not know that" Dean replied, but was immediately slapped in the face with the barrel of the gun before he was told to shut up.
"Let the idiot talk, in a few hours we will not see him anymore."
The first step was done, his consciousness was back. Now he just had to find somehow a way to wake up.
On the other hand, he also knew that other powers were involved.
"How long?"
"Not ..."
"Yes," Dean answered firmly, chuckling again.
Frustrated, because his fiancé had teased him for so long and then pulled him back just before the jump, he made a decision, put the shower on cold, put the shower head to full power and let the cold drops rain on her heated body. He did not know that the black-haired man could jump around and scream like a little girl.
All that went through his head was to stop the bleeding. Desperate, he tore Cas's shirt in half to see how bad it was. What came out of his mouth could be described as a mixture of hysterical, relieved, nervous laughter, mixed with a desperate sob. It went right through, and the place seemed to have missed all the vital organs.
He sighed and nodded, his hand drawing circles on Dean's chest.
"Fuck!"
"Leave him alone, he looks stressed enough," Kim said reproachfully, sitting down again and bit heartily into her burger.
With the nurses, he understood better and insisted on doing some things himself, even when it came to an 'accident'.
"I can not tell you that."
All present, Herrmann had again attached the sign of the 'closed society' to the door, gathered around Dean and Will Halstead.
The second highlight of the day, in the truest sense of the word, was when Will came with a cup and asked for a semen sample. On the one hand, because he had to examine that, on the other to see if his sperm came out where it should, or if it ran back into the bladder, which would not be great.
Startled and horrified, the younger man sank on the wooden bench. His worst fears had come true. They had Cas. Whoever they were. Dean's heart began to race as he stared wide-eyed at the display, which made it clear that Cas was being tortured. He was sitting on a chair, face bloodied, one eye swollen and his mouth duct-taped.
"Cas, Honey, what's going on?" He asked for the second time, as there was no sound at the other end of the line.
Short and painless as in a telenovela, the two had reconciled again.
"Want?!"
At least he thought that was a sexy look, and Dean had to grin at this attempt of tired eyes. After Herrmann called a taxi, Dean put an arm around Cas's hip. So drunk that he needed this support, he was not, but Dean just wanted to feel him close.
He was right, except for a painful bruise on her tibia and Gabriela's concussion, both were as new.
"Please," he pleaded with Trudy, who rolled her eyes and closed the door.
"But he breathes on his own. We have greatly reduced the medication and now have to wait. As I said, his values are good. He still needs time. We have done everything, and now you come into play. You are safety, emotional security and confidence. We still have some tests to do, but I think he is currently in a mix of a coma and the so-called 'locked-in syndrome'. It's too early to say anything more."
After some deliberation, he closed the doors of the ambulance and began to talk. From the fact that Dean was important to him, from the burglary into his apartment and his fears, he might be in trouble.
Sit on the edge of the bed, get up, take two steps to the left, two steps to the right, sit down. Castiel was sweating, and he was dizzy ... unbelievable how fast muscles could break down ...
"We have to be careful. Otherwise everything collapses," Severide said, and as soon as he had uttered the sentence, it happened.
Cas smiled proudly. Within moments, he had turned his husband into a horny, moaning mess. To return to the question ... no. No, the two of them would not be able to make it to bed, because even his fire hose was so badly jammed that it was already painful.
As he made no move to get back to bed, Castiel finally stood up with a grunt and dressed.
"I do not want chemo," he sobbed, stammering brokenly. "I do not want to vomit all the time and ... and not be me anymore. I want everything to go back to what it was ..."
"It's alright. Good night," she murmured, turning off the light and closing the door.
As he raced to his house at full speed, he hoped he either misunderstood this or that his husband had fooled him. Because honestly, that could not be!
"Come, come for me, my angel. Give me everything you have," Dean whispered wickedly, nibbling and sucking on his earlobe until he could feel it.
Again he was pulled to his feet and scanned from top to bottom, and when asked if he was alone, Dean nodded.
"Adam!" Cas called again, and finally, the policeman stopped and nodded as the fireman secured him with a rope. The terrorist was trapped and looking around like a frightened chicken.
"We should not do that, Dean," Cas whispered as he felt hands on his shoulders and the policeman's warm breath on his face.
They had gone through so much, had survived the Apocalypse and Lucifer, and now this accident should be fatal to him ?! And why could not these winged bastards do anything?!
He was just about to bite off his candy bar when he was startled by the loud thunderclap and bright flash of lightning but took a relieved breath when he saw his boyfriend.
"Come ... please wait in the corridor," she said, gently gripping the young policeman's arm, who instantly shook off angrily.
Moving the bed up and down felt like he was on a ship that threatened to sink at any moment. Another time he wanted to scream when a nurse came to his bed and with a distorted grinning face promised to come every night at the same time to inject him fear. She held a syringe with a damn long needle in the air, which she then attached to his neck.
"No!"
You learn to appreciate the little progress if you were in such a situation.
"But Sarge ...!"
Dean was the first to wake up, noting that both were in exactly the same position as they always were. Dean was the big and Cas the little spoon. Waking up like that was the best thing for Dean, and it made him smile. With a gentle movement, he pushed even closer to his husband. Cas's fingers lay loosely on Dean's arm, and only a soft, satisfied humming could be heard.
"Ask me now. Ask me again."
With a happy smile, he told that after that he had felt really good again.
That was the first question he asked Jay when he had not even set foot in the door.
The cards had to be put on the table because Voight was sure that the firefighters were also in danger.
"Dean," the angel whispered and stroked his cheek. He looked peaceful as if sleeping. But Cas's heart was heavy because he knew he was not sleeping.
Immediately he got a syringe in the access to his neck, which made him feel better again.
"I knew it. You can hear and feel me. Oh Cas, I'm so happy. Can you ... can you move your fingers. No, do not strain yourself. Relax, we'll catch up with everything. I'll keep talking. Just listen to me."
He had helped Otis a week ago to get a karaoke machine because he had relationships. Chuckling, he entered the full bar and was immediately waved by the Russians at the counter and greeted with a pat on the back.
Excited, Dean slipped back and forth in the passenger seat after finishing duty and almost begged Kim to go for a quick drink to Molly's, hoping to meet Cas there. Although Kim had an exhausting shift behind her, she agreed.
Seeking, the hunter looked around, but he discovered the angel nowhere.
Underneath the Christmas tree
As soon as he lay on the ground, he came to himself again and looked confused in worried faces. It all happened so fast that he could barely remember it.
"Okay you two pretty ones, come here."
The next day he made his first steps alone with the rollator on the corridor. Dean stuck him quickly with plaster the, on the back open nightgown, so that no one could see too much.
Cas turned in the direction of the voice and angrily threw the broken flashlight away.
"You can touch it too. It does not bite. But it sometimes spits," the firefighter chuckled as he realized Dean was hesitant.
"I know," the black-haired mumbled, adding. "I mean, I believe you."
"Say you're sorry!"
"Stay here. It could be that everything collapses!" Voight shouted after him, but the young policeman did not even turn around.
The dark blonde was still lying in bed motionless and had to digest the impressions first because he had seen his fiance completely naked for the first time. Then he jumped up fast, got rid of his boxer shorts because he wanted to see more.
Laughing and with a pat on the back, the two stood up and mingled with the crowd.
"Firefighter crashed through the roof!"
"Hey Dean, are you coming now or should I start alone?!"
"The pumpkin pie is great, it reminds me of the one my mother always baked, assuming we had money," Herrmann sighed a little wistfully.
"It is said, that when a cook oversalts the soup, he is in love. And since it’s not me, because I'm trying to make you beautiful eyes for weeks ... Out with it!"
But when he sang ... Dean did that in moments when he was unobserved because in that way he was shy. For his husband, it was the most beautiful voice he had ever heard.
His body was covered with a blanket on his bed.
Immediately he was with her, while Kim fired at the shooter, who disappeared as quickly as he had come. She ran after him, but he was already over the mountains. She promptly informed the police and an ambulance before returning to the bar to reassure people.
"Adam!" The policeman heard a voice, looked around but decided to pursue the suspect.
"Can I understand well, after all, he has just been emasculated," Joe mumbled, reaching protectively between his own legs.
"Just a few minutes, Sarge ..."
When his cell phone rang, he took a step, because it did not all have to be noticed when he phoned his sweetheart.
Cas looked at him startled and put his hand on the back of the hunter's head, but nothing happened as often as he tried, no matter how much he concentrated.
Cas did not care how that was done, it was important if something was found or not, but that still took a while.
"Please go home, Dean."
Rather, it was the fact that his husband had retreated even further. Dean felt that Cas thought he was worthless now. Actually, he did not want to do anything behind his husband's back, but he saw no other way out. So Dean went outside the house under the pretext of having to do something at the police station. That he went to the guard was right, but the other.
Casey shook his head. In the end, he was responsible for keeping his men together.
In the dining room, some of the bad boys sat together and mumbling, and the five kept looking in Dean's direction, who stood by the door as a supervisor. And he knew one of them too well. After all, he had contributed a great deal to the fact that he spent his remaining life here, of which he was proud.
Cas saw that Dean had called him, but after he had tried the third time and was always blocked off, he gave up. Even more puzzled and admitting, he was a little hurt when he got the message to stop calling. What he could not have guessed was that Dean just wanted to protect him.
"What?"
Although it was only a lead of a second, as he was sure it would be only a matter of time before the others found out about the location, he could not and did not want to expose Castiel to that danger. If he did not lose his life then definitely his badge, but he did not care. But it was not as easy as he had imagined, because nobody let him out of sight for even a moment.
Silently humming to himself, he would have had nothing against a helping hand, but he did it alone. With quick movements, he finished in a few minutes and washed him thoroughly. Cas did not know if he could hold his breath but tried. That was so unpleasant to him.
"You had doubts?!" he asked in astonishment as Castiel carefully took a small bite into his mouth and then grimaced in a grin. Because that tasted excellent.
In a quiet minute, he called his family and asked them to go on vacation. He explained nothing and felt a little paranoid, but better safe than sorry.
"OK. Until the boys arrive and cut the fence, we can do nothing but keep him alive. "
The burglar had caught up with the karma because it looked as if his attempt to escape had been slowed down over the fence and he had slipped unhappily because the iron grid was rooted in his back. He hung on the fence like a scarecrow and was barely conscious.
"I'm a cop, and I can park where I want!" Dean shouted back, ignoring the finger, which was then shown to him.
Too tired to fight. For what too. By now, half of his brain was probably spread out in the street. He also saw the reaper next to him and knew he had lost. His last look was for his angel, but even if he wanted to tell him that he loved him, there was only a croak between quivering lips. His eyes were fixed, his heartbeat slowed until it finally stopped altogether. From afar they heard the clock tower beat. It was midnight.
The noise made the young firefighter awake again, and even though the pain was unbearable and he saw it all just a little blurry, he could see that Dean was in the greatest danger because his tormentor had a knife in his hand.
"Do not worry. It's all right. Just like you, Brett. You both had many guardian angels."
"I ... um ..."
All possibilities were exhausted and disappointed they made their way home.
Well, and the poor women he saved on patrol duty were very willing to show their appreciation to the handsome officer. And he did not have to work hard to do that either. Dean had a busy sex life, and sometimes men were among them. Only, he had not found true love yet. But to be honest, there was no hurry. With his barely 30 years he wanted to enjoy his life, not commit himself.
If Cas had been able, he would have laughed. What came out of his mouth, but was a barely arrange hum. Dean wanted to undress completely, as hot as he was trying to crawl under the blanket of his husband.
A sudden gust of wind ripped Dean out of his thoughts, and he stared at Cas amazed.
It was early morning when the young policeman suddenly remembered.
"It's okay," Cas replied only, leaning against him, grabbing his friend's hands, which had settled around his upper body.
"All done, he's just a little shy," the younger man grinned.
Should he wake Cas? Part of him said he should do that. The other part of him enjoyed this pleasant tingling but too much. But that's not how he wanted it, so he put a hand on Cas's shoulder and squeezed him softly but firmly until the black-haired man opened his eyes and froze as he became aware of the situation.
Arrived at the goal, they found the older man in a stuffy bar, storytelling, among some other men. At first, he did not want to come along and invited the young firefighters.
"We should get up and get the tree," the policeman finally said, kissing his husband on the cheek and getting up without another word.
'I don't want a lot for Christmas
It was all ... it was an indescribable feeling flowing through his veins. It had been a long time since Cas was so happy at Christmas. In the midst of his big family.
The medication triggered in part anxiety attacks. Cas saw things, heard things, learned a lot, and to distinguish what was real and what was not, was almost impossible.
"Show me a man where both are the same," Cas grumbled lazily and stretched relaxed.
That was also a new experience for the firefighter. With a smile, he distributed the warm sperm, which was catapulted intermittently over his hand, before he wiped it on the towel and lay down next to his somewhat surprised friend.
"Yesterday, a woman was standing at our door, holding a cell phone and asking if a Dean would live here. He would have forgotten his cell phone with her. Apparently you two were not on guard right now, and Platt gave her our address, "the fireman sniffled and gratefully accepted the handkerchief Kim handed him.
The image that opened before his eyes broke his heart and in no time he crawled to the bound man. With trembling hands, he leaned on Cas's thigh.
The dark-blonde waved off because that was second-rate now. On the phone stuck a sticky note with the inscription to play the video when he was alone. The question of who had put it in his locker was uninteresting, for he wanted to know what was going on. But Antonio made no move to leave and so the other had no choice but to press the button.
"Do not shoot the messenger! Cas did not want us to know. Guys, I promised Dean to give them time. So we'll do just that, it's bad enough for him."
Dean laughed because he just imagined partying with the stiff, innocent angel. He remembered his visit with him in the brothel, which was anything but good.
With these words, he aimed at Cas and fired once, without hesitation. In no time a red spot spread on the bright shirt. Never before had the young firefighter been shot and had to admit that he had never felt such pain.
"Because nothing is exciting in my life right now?!"
"I like what I see. I love you," the dark blonde replied, unconsciously licking his lips.
With tears in his eyes, he looked at Halstead and followed him after saying goodbye to his husband. If he had tried to keep his composure in the sickroom, he collapsed in front of the door and slid along the wall until he was sitting on the floor.
Quietly he slipped down the corridor and opened the door of the cooling chamber.
'Good morning sleepyhead'
"Just stand still, okay?"
"I'm just worried."
"Has not everyone," Dean laughed, hugged his husband from behind and both admired their result from two steps away.
He learned that there was a holder on the bed. Very convenient.
With a grin, he got up and shoved the cold lasagna into the microwave before sitting down on the couch with his husband and resting after dinner.
Kelly shook his head. No, he would not give up, he could not lose anyone else after Shay, and he knew his team was 100% behind him.
"Are not you the bastard to whom I owe this?!" The bearded man called to him.
His mind was against it, his body was for it. Dean nodded and crawled out of bed. On the way to the bathroom, he wondered how Castiel should be standing in the shower when he could hardly stand on his feet. The problem quickly disappeared when he saw the shower set up. In addition, to grab the handles, there was also a seat that was easy to fold from the wall.
Something beautiful? Damn it. Looking for help, he looked around, but as hard as he tried, he could think of nothing beautiful in this hopeless situation.
"That looks very much like our witch," Sam murmured, continuing to scurry down and read everything through what was written.
Although Dean always enjoyed control and was already on the verge of mastery, he liked the fact that Cas was in charge. As if in slow motion, he noticed how the tip of his tongue emerged between his lips and moistened those lips, how those bright eyes fixed his own, and that little mischievous twinkle.
Until ...
"Stop poking your finger around, you're destroying the eroticism," Cas muttered, opening his eyes now and staring at his husband, shaking his head. "Maybe it just means that you should gain some speed. Otherwise, they will burst."
He still could not believe it. The last time he saw her, she was fine and then ...
"What?!"
"Let him go. It's something personal between us."
"Phew ... that would be done. And now to us two beauties."
With a swing, Dean pushed open the door and knelt on the floor to make sure that he was alone. Like a climbing acrobat, he balanced on one of the sinks and opened the window. It was not big, and he had to work hard. The sweat stood on Dean's forehead as he sent a thousand prayers to heaven, leaving him undetected.
"Do not you have phone ban!?"
Sergeant Platt talked about her childhood and various snowball fights. In the faces of the others, one could read the question, in which time this had happened because nobody could imagine Trudy as playful, as serious and sarcastic as she always was.
His voice broke, and the whisper went into a sob.
Head over heels, he jumped up from the bed and muttered that he had to take care of the little problem before Dean heard the door of the bathroom crack.
"What I'm trying to tell you is that if I lost you, I would miss the chance to be with you. And I do not know what I would do without you ... I love you!"
"Nothing at all will work. Cas and I are friends, family!"
"The sooner we put him behind bars, or six feet under, the better. He, or maybe several of them, is after the Fire Department and the Police Department. I will not let that happen."
"Come on," Dean mumbled shaking his head as he heard the rapid heartbeat on the monitor and knew his husband would have preferred to be invisible. "In good times and bad, you know."
Slowly he calmed down again, occasional sobs became a soft whimper, until only the beeping of the heartbeat was heard on the monitor.
Everyone had come back the following year, and no one could imagine how happy they had made him with it.
Both clung tightly until the last vibrations had left his body.
"Please go out, Mr. Winchester."
Your hope is my hope.
"Am I happy when we are back in our bed ..."
"Seriously?!"
Dean was not stupid. Although they had not known each other for so long, he realized that something was wrong. His husband was often tired, exhausted, drained.
For the past two weeks, Dean had had plenty of time since he had been suspended from duty, and with the help of the numerous volunteers who had helped with the renovation, the old house became a cozy nest, just in time for Cas's release.
To reduce the risk of infection, all unnecessary additions came out of the body and antibiotics in, an infusion three times a day.
"Well look. Do you even remember how the job works?"
It was so nice to hear Dean's voice, and though the black-haired man was too exhausted to follow this quick and over-zealous sermon, it was that soft and affectionate voice that made his heart beat faster in the truest sense of the word.
Cas had never fired a weapon. Though he knew how to do it, the figures in front of him moved so fast that he was afraid to hit the wrong one. But if he did not make a quick decision, that would be fatal. While he sent a prayer to Heaven, he squeezed the trigger.
In no time, he took off his own clothes and turned on the warm water.
"All right. What do you want?"
As fast as he could, Halstead went out and prepared everything. Then he came with a bowl of cold water and finished the wraps.
It went uphill step by step.
"What a hell of a plan," he mumbled, sitting down on a rock and staring at the field where the two, or fortunately the three, had been for over an hour.
"Do not even think about it."
"Hey, you two!"
For Cas, it was not clear at first who was sitting at his bed, and after a few moments, he closed his eyes exhausted with a sigh. He felt as if he had just run out of a marathon, but he was just lazily lying in bed. But it was nice to know that Dean was there, holding his hand and he did not have to say anything; it was enough to feel that presence.
Your confidence is my hope.
But that ... How many times had he wished in the past few hours that this damned terrorist had died instead of Adam? How many times had he wondered if it had not been the wrong decision and what would have happened if everyone had had more time.
"That was the tenth. He's not in hell," Cas sighed, killing him by placing his hand on his forehead.
Make my wish come true
Kim had gone home with Adam, and since Cas had a night shift, Dean had no choice but to spend the night in one of the dormitories. One could say that in the current way of life he felt like a prisoner. But at least, he got better food. His last thoughts were on Cas before he fell into a restless sleep.
"I know," the dark blonde replied with a nod and a small smile.
Not two minutes later, the alarm sounded. But only for the ambulance. Gabriela threw Sylvie the car keys while walking and with blue light, they raced to the scene of the accident. According to the information, they were to find an old woman at the corner of a supermarket struggling with shortness of breath, but there was no one to be seen far and wide. Frowning, the two women stood together before Sylvie reached for the mobile radio.
The sensitive firefighter laughed with tears and took a shaky breath.
Cas's legs widened automatically as the other one slid down and in a hoarse voice he demanded more, but Dean took his time.
The four decided to go to a bar. Neutral ground and Dean breathed relieved since he was not alone with Cas.
"Much too big," the fireman muttered, shaking his head as Dean stood in front of a prime specimen.
Well, it was just one word. A small word that had already destroyed the lives of many people. Cancer. The fireman could not believe that life had condemned him.
Nervously Dean licked his dry lips because the proximity Cas led for a long time that his heart rate increased and his hands began to sweat.
"I feel so comfortable with you and want to see where this leads us if you want it.
"Let's see if the fire rages among us," Casey said as he was the first to get off the aerial ladder to the roof. "Otis, hack a hole in the roof. Cas, open the skylight!"
That was very pleasant, because, intentionally or not, the fingertip had immediately found his prostate. Fortunately, Cas had such long fingers.
"Seriously?"
"Come, sit down," he said with a sigh and pointed to the chairs in the lounge.
"You had an amazing dream, apparently, " Dean grinned.
Already on the fourth day, and Dean was incredibly happy about it, his husband was transferred to the regular infirmary, and he was also a little bit proud that Cas put some pressure on himself and showed his will to fight.
"There are only monsters," Sam replied shaking his head and closed the heavy iron door to the interrogation room. But Dean has been there before. If more by a stupid accident.
"I'm going to the bathroom for a minute," Dean replied and was about to get up.
"You are awesome, Dean ..."
"Turn around," Cas suddenly whispered as he unscrewed the shower head to attach the other.
"Man Cas, those were some crazy days," Dean sighed in relief and squeezed his shoulder.
"Ambulance 61 at the control center. We are at the said accident site, but it is abandoned."
"What can I do for you?"
The policeman had heard the last words before closing his eyes with a smile. Only the crackling of the fire could be heard.
Until he heard Dean purring, which made him smile. His second hand was not idle, sensually groping the sensible places between his legs and smiling again when he noticed how Dean automatically spread his legs even further.
Somewhat startled that the other one was not asleep, Cas left his hand where it was.
As it seemed, the young firefighter had something to celebrate, for he was already slightly drunk.
One last look into the emerald eyes before the blue ones closed and a quiver went through the firefighter's body when he felt soft lips on his own. He had waited so long for this feeling, and it was like intoxication, indescribable, magical. This kiss was everything and much more. He felt a hand grip the back of his head, grabbing a handful of his hair and pulling him close to those delicious lips.
"Oh, come on," the dark blonde smirked. "It's Christmas."
After all, he had saved him once before. But now he tried to follow the conversation that was taking place somewhere. He was still in the hospital?
"How are you?"
"How is that possible?" The black-haired asked, looking him up and down.
"And I want a pizza," the black-haired grunted. "Homemade."
"We're with you Ruzek," said Voight in a composed voice that was more played than real.
"Yes. And?"
Still dazed by the operation and the painkillers, he was glad he could not see himself. Because he probably had the stupidest grin of all time on his face.
By now, Dean's complexion had taken on a darker tone, and his breathing was getting heavier and deeper. Besides, he had to concentrate that he did not immediately succumb to his feelings and therefore he asked him to stop.
The heart was pounding Sam's throat as the angel's sword swished past his own head a few millimeters. He was nervous, and after one last look at his angel, he closed his eyes. He heard Rowena's words, felt his stomach cramp and was glad to have his eyes closed when powerful lightning struck and they were pulled into darkness.
"Yes, yes ... of course," the fireman interrupted him, and while everyone was giggling, laughing, applauding and clapping, the two hugged each other.
"You're going to dig up everything, friends, family, real estate, organizations ... Let go of all your informants. I want to know everything. Ask the neighbors. Somebody must have seen something!"
"How's Cas?"
Gradually it turned out that at that time the Russian ambassador was being treated in the hospital, and he was being attacked.
The following ten days the fireman was unfit for service, had to go to the hospital again and again to change bandages, which pinched like a tight underpants, CT scan, and let go of all the medical stuff and his arm looked like that of a drug addict because he had repeatedly taken blood to check the tumor markers.
The Chief personally forced open the door, but it was hopeless. The building was in full fire, and even though the firemen were soaking up everything to extinguish the blaze, the fire could not be brought under control. He had no choice but to get the remaining three firemen safely from the roof before it collapsed.
In the evening he stood naked in front of the bedroom mirror and admired with a sigh the bruise, which graced his lower back, the right buttock and also a piece of his right thigh when he had fallen from the truck. Although this painting gradually faded, it was still visible. And admittedly, it hurt.
"Close!"
But first came an important part.
"No!" The firefighter hissed.
So far went his last bit of mind that had not yet passed between his legs that you could smell sex.
"Leave it!" Kelly shouted, pulling him away. "We have to get out of here and come up with something different."
"You should have answered the first time," the policeman answered wittily and smiled.
In the interception room, of course, the alarm went off, and the nurse put her head in the door to ask if everything was alright. Dean put the soiled utensils in her hand and took off his gloves.
Loud voices, one of which he recognized as that of Sergeant Voight and the other as that of Antiono Dawson made him listen and in no time left his office. As suspected, the two had a man in custody who fiercely resisted.
"Did not I tell you not to frighten me?!" Dean smiled, at least trying to, but to tell the truth, it tore his heart, and he bit his quivering lips.
With a loud sigh he laid his head on the hunter's chest, and as the tears continued to run down his cheeks, he fell asleep.
A sudden knock on the door tore him out of his thoughts. Wondering himself, who was outside shortly before midnight, he slipped into his pants and opened.
As proof, he did just that and sighed thoughtfully. But the grief and the worries did not pass him by without a trace, and he himself had lost some weight.
Sergeant Platt stood in the doorway with her arms folded, looking at the young man, who kept checking his watch, instead of finishing the police reports.
It must have been minutes, if not hours when Dean was wandering around.
Dean was interrupted again as Gabriel twirled his hand in front of his face. Since the angel never took a leaf in front of his mouth anyway and said what was going through his head, he also spoke it out directly.
No death that one wished, but who could choose that already ...
"I love your soft hair that I can dig into." Lovingly, he stroked his fingers through his hair and scratched his neck. "I love your eyes, so beautiful, so deep, so loving, and I have the feeling that you can look deep into my soul. I love your beard," he laughed and stroked his cheeks, after which Cas grinned, and Dean put his index finger into the dimple. "And this. I love your lips." He pursed his lips with his thumb, and Cas swallowed before he opened them easily. "I love your tongue, which sends electric shocks through my body every time. I love your deep, sexy voice that triggers something in me that you can not imagine. I love your strong arms, in which I feel safe and secure. I love your tender hands at whose touch I am in seventh heaven." He lovingly took his hand, kissed each finger and smiled at the goose bumps that formed on Cas's body.
"Ruzek!"
"Make this nice and wet for me."
With blue lights and sirens also came the other emergency vehicles of the surrounding fire departments and the police gradually.
"What are you thinking about, Chief?"
He has often read reports of people in a coma but never heard an exact answer.
Of course, the alarm went off again immediately, because it was already something different.
"Well, because you did mouth-to-mouth insufflation with Dawson ..."
Immediately, the firefighter cuddled even closer to the dark blond and sighed with closed eyes.
"You lousy asshole!" Dean shouted and laid Cas carefully on the ground before he was on his feet in no time.
There was something so wicked, erotic, and highly explosive about the sight that the young cop could not help but explode.
Overall, Cas was in the hospital for two weeks, and he could not wait to get out again.
"And now?" Cas asked and sank to his knees. Desperately, he tried to dig to reopen the access.
In response, he got only a choppy laugh, because his leg was trapped and therefore he could not go away anyway. Also, he was bad, and his stomach felt as if his entire intestines were no longer where they belonged.
"Burgess, Winchester, you're in the office now. Report to Sergeant Platt! Chief Boden, come here for a word."
But Dean promised him a wonderful dinner, and that made Cas smile because he knew that when his husband cooked, it took hours and then the kitchen looked as if ten elephants had raged. But he did it with love, and that was the main thing.
"What do you want on the pizza ?! You can forget. Pineapples are definitely not on it!"
Cas had survived all examinations successfully, there was no consequential damage, and the discharge was nothing in the way.
"Just no hard-on, I feel very well," he chuckled because the young man could not resist that.
Dean's heart broke when he saw his husband so desperate, and he felt so helpless, but he could do nothing but support him and be with him.
Cas was no different. Part of him told him that he should at least take off his pants, but another part did not want to move away from his fiancé. Dean brought a hand between both erections, stroking, squeezing and rubbing faster and faster.
Confused, Matt looked at his colleagues, who looked back gravely, then broke into a loud giggle and laughed.
"I mean, it brings something. But we should continue this as a couple."
"I just wanted to tell you. You can not do anything. Try to sleep a little bit. Tomorrow we'll discuss the details."
The loud noise made it impossible for the young people to hear anything for a moment and they could only read in the horrified faces of the approaching policemen, who seemed to ask if the three of them were alright.
Voices. He heard voices. Silently, indistinctly. Cas pricked up his ears; something was different. Where was he? Slightly he grinned as he remembered this episode from the television series Supernatural, where that angel ... damn, what was his name ?! No matter ...
"Celebrate with Cas ..."
At that moment, Gabriela and her colleague came around the corner, who of course immediately decided to take the young man to the guard, because in this state, he should not be alone.
Cas cried no tears, was paralyzed. Slowly he began to realize and with the realization came the fear. The doctor asked him to come over in the next few days to go through the following steps, because first, he wanted to let the young firefighter, who stared silently out of the window, processing this shock.
Immediately Dean clung to him, like a drowning man to the lifebuoy. From the very first glance into that kind, sea-blue eyes, Dean knew that the fireman was extraordinary, and almost never in his life had he felt so comfortable with a human even though he almost did not know him. Not yet, for he vowed to change that fact.
A small smile crossed the policeman's pale face, and as quietly as possible he opened the door and closed it again. What he saw there gave his little heart multiple painful stings.
It was a day like any other and yet it was not. Tears floated in the eyes of the young firefighter as countless colleagues in the cemetery saluted in front of the decorated coffin to pay tribute to his friend Cruz. It was a mission, like many before, and it took only a blink of an eye, to end his life.
"Stay in bed," the black-haired man smirked, turning to him and waving his eyebrows, then wrinkling his nose as he smelled his T-shirt and taking it off. "But first I'll take a shower."
Dean let his gaze wander between blue eyes and those red lips expectantly as he bit his own lower lip.
And another news was in the house. After his marriage proposal, Dean, of course, wanted to let deeds speak. Preferably yesterday than today.
"Dean Winchester, Castiel Novak. With this I declare you to legally married spouses. Now you are allowed to kiss ", Orlovsky smirked, and with loud cheers and applause, the two fell into each other's arms. All the tension had dropped off them as they whispered how much they loved each other.
Your power is my motivation.
"If I'm not at home, Cas or 51, I'm at the police station," he mumbled but knew she did not mean it that way.
Dean was not a monster and allowed him a brief breather, which he used to slide his fingers through the black hair that adorned Cas's chest.
Then she patted his suit and hugged him.
"Great ..." he murmured, grabbing his knife and the ax lying on the ground and scrambling to his feet.
Nevertheless, or therefore he did not want to sit around idly but to participate, but Voight spoke again a power word that he could not resist.
"An artificial coma means that we give his body the ability to better cope with the situation," Will said, receiving only a dismissive nod in response.
The moving speech of Sergeant Voight in the full church moved even the people in the back row, and it was a renewed goosebump moment when he urged everyone not to mourn death but to celebrate life and stand up in remembrance of Adam Ruzek.
How he would have liked to stretch out his hand and wipe those worries out of his face.
"A saying goes that cold coffee makes you beautiful," Cas muttered without thinking and sipped his cup.
When he felt Dean's thumb rub lightly on the back of his hand, he took a deep breath and smiled at him.
And when the two were in bed, he also knew that the black-haired did not sleep.
"You're pretty curious, Brett."
The hand, which lay suddenly on his back, he barely registered, and when he straightened up and recognized the chaplain with a tear-shrouded look, the policeman fell sobbing around his neck.
"Come here," Dean whispered, and without answering Cas slid close to him, sighing softly as an arm wrapped around him.
"Honey, no matter how you choose, you know that I support you," he said, hugging him. As hard as he could, the black-haired had to bite his lips so as not to burst into tears.
Sergeant Platt slipped the package, wrapped in untidy newsprint, across the counter, waiting as Dean made no move to open it.
One of the cops watched the teasing a few moments before he stood in front of Dean, his hand on his chest as he noticed how the young man was bubbling.
"No reflexes," the doctor sighed as he lit his little lamp in Cas's eyes and checked on his soles.
"Or a snow angel," Cas chuckled and turned to face him.
It was reassuring for Cas when Dean was with him because he could feel his presence.
The crew was doing an exercise and slowly approaching.
"Winchester!"
"I will not let you go," it said, and a few seconds later, Dean was alone again, again enveloped in darkness.
Otis looked amused at Chief Boden, who enjoyed the food with a slight grin on his face.
Everything felt numb and unreal, and suddenly everything was too much for Dean, he had to get out of this room. He did not feel the cold wind on his clothes, nor the drizzle that wet his short hair as he rushed headlong down the stairs, tore open the glass door and rushed haphazardly into the park.
In no time at all, the lounge was decorated with floral arrangements, wreaths, and flowers and while Otis dismissed condolences, Mouch tried his hand as a florist.
"No, Matt," the young firefighter replied a little annoyed. Although he was a bit queasy from time to time lately and he sometimes had a pull in his back or stomach, but he put that on the stress.
If he had gone to school, it would not have happened. It was a cable fire, that was found out later — a stupid accident. All he could remember was that his mother died of a smoke intoxication in the hospital, and his father in the house, trying to protect his son. But this fear, horror, and lack of hope were more present than ever.
"Pulse is weak, but there."
"Honey, you have something there."
"Sergeant. Will I get five minutes with the driver of the truck, alone?"
With a wave of his hand, he let Cas enter the treatment room, pointed to a chair, and closed the door behind him before sitting down at the desk.
He had made many friendships, had fallen in love and found in Dean, a man who supported him in everything and was always there for him.
After explaining why he screwed up his chance, Dean snorted with rage.
"Morning, Hon."
"You do not thank for sex, dumbhead," Dean laughed softly, and after the two had dressed again and were just on their way to bed, the nurse put her head in the door.
Matt was the first to kneel on the ground and breathe a sigh of relief, as it was not one of his friends.
After these ten days, he felt fit enough to return to his dream job and thought he had survived everything. Although the doctor had explained to him the possible consequences, he did not want to remember or better said, he repressed it.
By chance, Otis came by, raised his eyebrows and immediately turned back. It took only seconds until he had told Herrmann about it and after Casey had sat down at the table, he was staring at him silence until the older man could not stand it any longer.
All he said was that the chances of recovery were 95%, but that did not reassure Cas. With his results, he sat in his car, could not think straight. That could not be possible. That had to be a mistake!
A psychologist showed him relaxation exercises and helped him to work with positive pictures. But the best relaxation for him was his husband.
In the evening, Castiel was sitting in the bath, still thinking. He had already thought so much that his head ached. No matter how he sliced it, that was just a huge shit. Absently, he held his testicles and felt with his thumb and forefinger. Right, everything was as it should be, left he felt only the flabby skin between his fingers.
Based on the sarcastic tone, the young man knew that a discussion was going nowhere, and he grunted on his way. Still grumbling, he stood in front of the federal prison fifteen minutes later and gave his assignment to the policeman at the reception.
Since, in the heat of the moment, both had forgotten to buy one, Cas unceremoniously picked up his engagement ring from the small box he had stashed in the bedside drawer and fumbled it through the topmost branch.
Music from the CD player was, of course, nothing in contrast to a singer, but you had to be content with little things.
After Dean locked the door, he turned around with a grin, put his arm around his husband and loosened the loop on his neck.
Hank got up and emptied his glass in one go.
When he opened his eyes again, his view stuck to the table where his best friend was always sitting.
Hank Voigt kept trying to reach Adam, but the policeman's radio was broken, which neither of them knew.
This is done to relieve the pain or give the body a chance to recover and mitigate the organism. When the doctors dropped off the anesthetics, the patients woke up again, slowly but steadily, simply by reducing the medication.
But some planning had to be. For one, because you had to bring the fire department and the police under one hat. On the other hand, because it should be a secret, at least the chief bosses should not notice, because it could only come back to unnecessary trouble. The wedding was planned during the shift, at the guard 51.
With confidence that was more played than real, the dark blonde broke away and snorted furiously.
Dawson had been recovered uninjured, and Dean's desperate plea went down in the applause for the successful rescue.
Exhausted, Dean began to giggle, and Cas could not help but agree.
He did not say a word for the entire ride, only occasionally a soft sob could be heard from him. With a nod of understanding, Burgess went alone to the guard again.
A soft sigh escaped the dark blond, and he lowered his eyes sadly because now he was even more afraid to tell him what he felt.
"I see the fire hose is already ready for use," he giggled, which Cas only answered with a roll of his eyes.
These nightmares were always interrupted when he felt his husband's presence.
"Is he dreaming?" His brother Jay wanted to know.
To emphasize these words, Dean moved even closer and pressed his lips to his husband's. A flock of butterflies began to flutter, and Dean could not suppress a groan as he felt a naked, muscular thigh between his legs, rubbing against him barely noticeably. Both knew that they could not do that, as one of the nurses always made their rounds, but none of them could stop either.
"Careful, two steps."
"You take good care of him, yes?"
Casey wanted to shake her awake because she was not bleeding or had any other visible injuries, but he did think better of it.
Doctors then know which meds we can best treat for our sepsis patients. Because you fight bacteria completely different than viruses and in turn, unlike fungal infections.
Sergeant Platt shrugged and nodded, secretly hoping that it would not be another catastrophe like last time.
Even for Cas, the air was short, but not in pain, but by the sensations that twitched through his body as he penetrated deeper and deeper.
"In an artificial coma and narcosis, the brain is partially paralyzed chemically. Depending on how strong the medication is dosed, therefore, the subconscious mind is more or less switched off, since for examinations the deep relaxation of the muscles is indeed required. And just in the subconscious, the dream processes are moving. Nobody can say if and how much these people will notice or dream."
"I know. Do not you need," the black-haired waved off and also got something to eat.
The soft, soothing words, the strong arms that held him safe, and the regular heartbeat he heard at his ear enabled Dean to calm down again quickly. He somehow felt tired and slid lower and lower, until he finally laid his head on Cas's lap.
He pulled his suit tight one last time, his cap, took a deep breath and nodded to Kim.
"No. No no no!"
With a heavy heart, he kissed his hand and let go. After the young policeman had closed the door, he leaned against it and closed his eyes.
Dean sent him the best wishes from the entire police and fire brigade team, and even if they were not allowed in intensive care, he should know that everyone thought of him. At that moment, the sensitive firefighter felt so loved that he had tears in his eyes.
"I feel the same way."
"Come in here," the black-haired man said, pulling Dean by the arm into the bedroom.
A hint of disappointment spread in Dean as the doctor shook his head.
"As if you have something to say here, but do not worry, your lover is still alive," came the sarcastic response that was followed by another slap in the face, this time from a smaller man who had appeared out of nowhere.
The past weeks had shown that Castiel could rely on him. How should he get that back? Nothing happened. So drunk that he had a blackout, he was not. Again he put the bottle of whiskey to his mouth and took a generous sip.
Now that he knew he wanted more, it was too late. He wanted Dean to be something his brother had with Sam. He wanted to be close to him. Wanted to touch and taste the hunter.
"It's all right, Chief," Burgess replied, putting on her most innocent smile, and the boss just mumbled back into the office.
"I'm fine," he repeated again and again until Dawson let go of him. "Maybe the breathing mask was not tight, and I inhaled something."
Everyone laughed and nodded, and the young policeman was a little embarrassed when Cas suddenly kissed him.
Without thinking, he jumped up and hugged Sergeant Platt, who was a bit taken aback but could not resist a slight smile.
Cas shook his head and looked at him questioningly, while Dean answered with a giggle.
"What ?!" Dean asked irritated and turned to her.
"Will that be an interrogation? What do you want to hear? That we had wild sex in the shower? In his condition hardly possible, right?!"
Stammering, Cas explained that he had nothing for Dean and sadly lowered his eyes. With the thumb on the chin, Dean forced him to look up. He put all the love he had in his eyes and smiled at his contrite husband.
"It's nonsense. Such an old shack; let's flare it off," Joe said annoyed, dropping his ax again and again on the roof. "The whole block is empty, everything here can burn away."
"Hmm ... you hallucinate," Dean replied dully, his head on Cas's back, eyes closed.
When he was sure that his husband was fast asleep, he deftly wriggled out of his embrace, stood up as quietly as possible so as not to wake him, and made coffee.
An hour later, both were back at the station. Somewhat disappointed, because it was again just an observation.
"Oh yes. Any idea?"
Luckily two tears ran down his face when his husband made himself felt again. A gentle kiss on his motionless lips followed before he ran outside to search for Will.
"No matter which demons you're fighting with, it's not real, are you listening? I'm here, focus on my voice and my touch."
Cas sat at the computer and checked his emails when he heard a clatter from the kitchen.
"Probably the safest place in town," Hank muttered, after passing his command to Ruzek.
He was sorry, he was to blame — a sigh that Dean knew only too well followed.
"But you're lucky, Ruzek has room in the garage," she grinned after that Dean rolled his eyes.
After both were back in the bedroom, Dean noticed the untouched coffee cups.
He revealed in thought, remembering the time in purgatory and the number of times the three had died. He had to smile slightly at the thought. The many fights they had fought with each other. But with this life change, nothing could endure forever and eventually it would be over. Forever. Cas had been on earth too long and had gotten used to this life. He could not bear losing Dean.
Again the song sounded 'Thank you for loving me,' and Cas already had wet eyes when he saw Dean standing with the chaplain, his best man on his right and Kim was already there. Everyone had gotten up, and their eyes were on Cas. It was precisely 21 paces before he could hold his luck in his hands. Once again, he had to swallow his rising tears when he had to think briefly about his deceased parents because that would certainly like to see them both. But he had a new, huge family now. And he had Dean. His Dean.
Sleep was out of the question anyway, and since the safest place was the guard, they spent the night there. Maddie survived this attack, thank God. But at least now Dean knew he was in serious trouble.
Dean told him everything and tried even more so that his voice would not tremble.
That was when Cas woke up. The view was a bit cloudy, and he was too weak to open his eyes completely and talk, that did not work. But a very slight, barely noticeable movement of his right hand. Dean immediately jumped and looked at his husband.
"Oh good, the cavalry is here!"
At that moment, the pool lit under the truck, and Cas admired once again the active cooperation of the guys. Everyone knew what to do, everyone could rely on the other, and no one got hurt when the car exploded.
The four paid and then wanted to go home. As they passed another bar, they heard two men calling after them. They were already pretty drunk and struggling.
"You are acting as if it were life and death!"
"But?"
Comforting, he put a hand on Cas's shoulder because he saw how much the matter went to his heart.
"The stairs," the black-haired man gasped, nodding in that direction.
"I know," Dean whispered as he passed light kisses on his shoulders. "Look at me, please. Do not exclude me. I'm here, I'm with you, and because it's the way it is, we'll go through it together. I love you and have the strength for both of us. If you do this surgery, then I know that it will turn out well. From where? God, Cas. We've been through so much, and our guardian angels are watching over us."
"We'll be right out, Chief. Everything's alright," the fireman passed over the radio.
Dean did not come, did not call, did not write. The evening turned to night, and the night turned early in the morning when Herrmann laid a hand on his shoulder and told him to go home, as he wanted to lock up.
'Dean, pull yourself together!'
"It does not work. Why does not it work?!"
He did not startle when he was standing right in front of it, because it was not the first time he was facing himself.
"What do we want to do the remaining three days before the work takes over again?"
"Hey Dean," Otis shouted, hugging him briefly with a smile and a pat on the back.
"W-what?"
With some books in his luggage, he went back to the hospital the next day. His condition had not changed, but Dean was glad that it had not gotten worse. Another day passed, and there was not much left of Dean's intentions as he looked again at the lifeless body in bed struggling to survive.
"I'd rather stay here. What do you want from me? Did not we agree that you should leave me alone?!"
What came to the fore when Otis lifted the tarp let everyone swallow.
"Well, then no one sees the hole!" Herrmann snorted and shook his head; the black-haired man turned back in the washroom.
Now he was sitting alone again, staring again at Cas. And suddenly the black-haired man turned in his direction, smiled at him, and Dean's heart began to beat faster. Quickly he turned around and involved Otis, who stood behind the bar in a conversation that he could barely remember in the next minute.
His pulse went faster, the fear crept up his throat, making Cas's heart ache.
As practical as it was, Cas almost cheered as the catheter was pulled out of his penis.
I don't care about the presents
Somewhat melancholy, he looked into the distance, before he continued. At the time, a friend had shown him how to use a Braille typewriter to write a letter to her. He almost gave up more than once, because he had always done something wrong.
Internalized the perfectly formed body that stretched out in pleasure and listened to the sensual sounds he could elicit his fiancé.
It was just before closing time when there was some action in the jail and the reason was the dark blonde, who once again could not shut up, and that was not the first time that had got him in trouble.
Again he was desperate, and it was difficult not to show how bad he was. The hours he had slept through lately, you could count on one hand.
After work, he was at Molly's and sat at his place at the bar.
Dean did not quite know what to do and just stared at the motionless body in bed.
Cas had lost confidence. He did not want to constantly wonder what his husband did when he was not there. He had gotten so lost in thought and ignored his heart that told him he exaggerated excessively, and that that was not possible.
"What?" He whispered.
"Come on, babe, let me help you," the fireman smiled.
Startled, Cas shot up. For one thing, angels do not need to sleep, and for another, because Dean's chest heaved and his eyes widened with a suffocating snort.
"What happened?" The dark-skinned man muttered, slowly coming to himself.
"What did you do, Winchester?" Another policeman grinned as he led him around. "Because if someone has to come to us here, that's usually the case."
"I was there. Never think about what would have been if, that will ruin you. Everything is okay."
"Herrmann, Mouch ... establish fire safety!" Came the command of Casey.
"Today we are celebrating Christmas and then ... you will see, the time will pass by in flight, and maybe I'll visit you sometimes. We go for a walk and build a snowman."
That was too much for the little heart, and it did not only express itself in nightmares but also abdominal pain and nausea. Screaming and raging, he refused to get up from his bed. He did not want to go there, but he did not tell the reason to his parents. He was too ashamed of that because he knew that both were working hard to enable him to do so. On this day, both decided to stay with their son.
"Good morning Cas."
Dean was startled because the last thing he wanted was for that bitchy nurse to stick her nose in the door.
"Dean!"
"Fuel out!" Cas shouted a few yards away, looking first at the dripping pool on the floor and then at his lieutenant.
Since it was just under zero degrees, Dean put his jacket first and then his arm around him and drove home with Cas.
"Sorry. I had to take the bus; someone stung the tires of my car. "
Annoyed, Dean scanned the lines, put his signature underneath, and put the paper in the file.
In the letter, Cas had told her everything he could not express in words. How much he admired her and how much he loved her. After that, she hugged him for a long time and said she had never had such a nice Christmas present before. The feeling that he had at that time was indescribable. Two nights later she died, with the letter in her hand.
"You have destroyed the lives of many others. You're only here because you belong right here! "
The couple waited a few seconds before they were sure she was gone, then they burst out laughing as they slipped back into bed and cuddled together.
"Will is the best; there's no doubt about that. Cas is in good hands."
"I think one or two ribs are broken," he groaned and kissed him briefly, but when Gabriela tried to take him to the hospital, he shook his head.
At noon Dean came back. Since the black-haired man was still too weak, his husband was allowed to feed him and to be honest; Dean liked this 'mothering'. Soup and applesauce, solid food was not yet on the program. His gums were slightly inflamed, gradually the little things came to light, caused by the long lying.
"I am sorry. Excuse me. It's just ... It's crazy. I can not handle this flood of emotions."
Dean was thrilled, hard to stop himself from kissing the doctor. Instead, he pinched his cheeks, and with a relieved grunt he turned to go to his sweetheart.
The two naked men rolled slinky on the bed and could leave their hands and lips from the other.
"Right. Brett had a tracheotomy. You do it once," the dark-haired giggled.
Gabriel sat down next to him with a cup of coffee.
Sam was not sure how long that had taken, but when he opened his eyes again, he found himself on the ground of a forest.
"Dean Winchester. Did you become shy overnight?" Castiel replied with a big grin.
Cas dreamed, as he had many times before, of his parents and to make it clear, of their death. It was a sunny day. Cas was six, just enrolled in school. But he did not feel well there. The other children teased him because he wore braces. 'Robots', they called him and that he should not open his mouth, otherwise these wires would kill the other children.
He remembered Billie's last words, saying that it would be forever if one of them died. He could not accept that. Tears ran down his cheeks as he watched helplessly as his brother's life faded from minute to minute.
Antonio put his hands on the shoulders of his desperate colleague and patiently waited for him to look up.
"I have an idea."
"Do not stop, please," the black-haired man whispered, looking pleadingly into the green eyes of his counterpart. He wanted to know. He had to know.
As the gut is removed from the abdominal area during surgery to reach the lymph nodes on the back, it had to be empty. That meant in his case that Cas had to drink about 6 liters of a slightly viscous beverage. As a result, he often had to go to the bathroom, but not to pee!
"Why?" Dean asked in surprise, shaking his head.
He had to let his pent-up anger out somewhere. The unit of intelligence was known to use harder means too. But as long as it did not degenerate, all looked over it, because this unit had the highest enlightenment rate, which could not be denied. That was only half the truth because Dean knew there was a window in the room and saw his chance, but Hank Voight thwarted him and shook his head.
Trudy glanced at them for a moment before handing Kim a piece of paper and sending her upstairs. Of course, Dean wanted to follow her but was whistled back by Sergeant Platt.
The heart of the young policeman beat higher. Could it be a bomb?
Dean put the cups on the bedside table, sat down in the bed and tried to smooth this stubborn hair with his fingers, but decided otherwise and ruffled through the thick, black hair.
If he had known what fears Dean had been going through in the last few days, he might have avoided it. But he did not know that yet.
So the nightmare started again, and he felt guilty. How he would like to put those responsible behind bars, but all efforts of the Intelligence have gone so far in the dark. Who would be next?
With a roll of his eyes, the older man moved on and within a few minutes had stretched him so far that he saw no reason to wait any longer. When he felt the metal, thank goodness, Cas had warmed it, which knocked cautiously, he took a deep breath. Again and again, a little bit, because Cas realized that Dean had bitten his teeth together, stopped breathing and clenched his hands into fists.
"Yours," Cas agreed breathlessly as his tongue flicked over Dean's collarbone before rejoining the other.
"I can not anymore. Dean, get out of here," he whispered, but Dean just told him he did not want to hear his lamentation.
With a wave of his hand, Dean shooed the nurse out the door and turned back to his husband as he put on gloves.
"So, enough now," she murmured and wriggled out of the embrace, at which point all three had to laugh. "Stick to it, then something will become of you, Winchester."
Gabriela and the new paramedic had just delivered their emergency at the Chicago Med, as her gaze turned to a nurse carrying a body. Barely fifteen minutes later, the two parked their ambulance back in the hall of the guard 51 and got out with a grin.
When Dean thought back, he had to hold back his giggling, because then he had started something with his colleague, who had then move to another department, because the young policeman could not keep his fingers from other women.
"Why did not he tell us, we need to go to the hospital!" Herrmann shouted in annoyance after everyone at Ward 51 heard about what Gabby had experienced at the hospital.
"Not yet," was all he said and Kim had to settle for it.
"What?!"
The last time Dean had anything to do with a man was half a year ago, and his heart was thumping as he put his hands to the cold tiles and leaned back a bit.
The fire of passion screamed through his entire nervous system, and Cas had great difficulty not screaming. Again and again, he felt the thrusts crawling up his urethra.
"If Dean is not in heaven and not in hell. What else is there?"
Somewhat confused, he lay there with a hard-on, which longed for relief. Looking around the room, he saw a box of handkerchiefs, got up, grabbed a few, and lay down again. After shoving his underpants to his knees and wrapping his penis with one hand, he closed his eyes and imagined it was Cas's hand, slowly pacing up and down. The head was already wet with the drops squeezing out of the small slit, and a shaky sigh broke as he made his thumb circling. It was not long before he felt this twitching and spurting in the handkerchiefs.
Dean squeezed his hand and mumbled that they had to go now. When he got up, he felt he was floating. Everything was so surreal.
One day later at the police station.
The dark blond nodded.
"He's going to hate me, but yes," the policeman finally said as the other suggested he come along to talk to Cas.
With Kim as an accompaniment, he again presented the incidents to the assembled intelligence team. Immediately everyone sat down at their computer to go through everything again.
Smiling and panting, the woman slipped from him and dropped beside him. Her name? No idea. One more in his collection.
The ride took almost four songs that sounded from the car radio, and both sang along cheerfully, and Cas waited expectantly as Dean turned off the engine, got out, opened the passenger door and handed his friend his hands. What he had not told Castiel was that his parents were pretty wealthy because he did not want to stand before him like a spoiled sonny boy. Even more so, where he had sworn to abandon his lavish ways of life.
"And you also have to report that about your car."
Afterward, when they both sat in the car, Castiel felt suddenly bad, weak and sick. He tried to pull himself together, even if it was only for the reason that he did not want to worry Dean. Probably it was this hand that made light circles on his kneecap, maybe the soothing words and gentle voice he heard from his husband, but suddenly the switch in his head turned. His fear was replaced by a defiant, 'Ok, it's just that way, you have to go through'. Smiling, he looked at Dean, squeezing his hand as he turned the music louder with the other on the radio.
Whether vital organs were hit, he did not know, had no time to think about it. Cas toppled over and felt only the impact on the hard ground before darkness surrounded him.
His glassy eyes gave the impression of being sick, but the deep tone of his voice dripped with arousal and need.
"Ruzek, you will not fall asleep now. The men are on their way. Get your ass in the control room!"
Gradually, the meds were reduced. It took and lasted.
As Casey turned to face him from the passenger seat, he noticed Castiel staring at Otis, who steered the fire-truck and grinned.
While Adam was still wondering why his sergeant had told him via mobile radio to get a clearance vehicle as quickly as possible, his own car turned as automatically.
"You do not have to thank me," he smirked, nodding at Trudy, who had seen that look and was struggling to make it to the two men.
After taking a seat on the leatherette-covered chair and now knowing how women felt at the gynecologist and being so thoroughly examined by this doctor that he probably knew the number of pubic hairs, Cas exhaled with a shuddering breath he had unconsciously stopped. After an ultrasound, and, damn, that was strange and cold, he let go of him and took off his gloves again.
Climbing stairs were the next hurdle; it was more exhausting downhill because you had to brake.
"Is this necessary?" He grumbled as Dean pushed him through the hospital corridor in a wheelchair.
And then the incident when he was shot. As he thought about it, he fell into a restless sleep.
"Thanks, Dean. I love you," Cas finally answered, hugging him before expressing his affection with a passionate and deep kiss.
"What?"
Why not? Dean wondered when he had mutated back to a shy boy.
The doctor asked Cas to get dressed again and then come back to the consulting room. As he looked into his computer with a serious face for a long time, the fireman began to feel more and more anxious. The heavy moaning and the tone in the doctor’s voice did not sound like 'all right', but he still thought that this small bump on his balls could not be so bad and would undoubtedly be treated with a few tablets.
"Wow, I'm about to burst," Cas moaned, holding his stomach. Satisfied and happy, he winked at his husband, tapping his thighs.
Said and done.
"Thanks, Will. For everything," Castiel whispered. He found it difficult to speak, the words came out of his mouth only croaking and choppy, but he was glad to speak at all, as much as his throat ached.
One day, when Dean leaned over him and pressed a kiss on his forehead, his husband closed his eyes for a moment and then looked directly at him.
"What? Damn it!"
"I've always had calf wrap as a child," Dean said rather casually, but Will found that in addition to the drugs a great idea.
"Yes, I can ..."
"Do you want to talk about it?" Dean asked cautiously but got nothing more than a shake of the head.
Back on guard 21, none of the cops had closed their eyes for more than a day.
Smiling, he kissed his fingers and had the feeling here also felt a movement on his lips. But could also have been imagination. At that moment, he was just glad that Cas was looking at him. And he looked at him for a long time, just as the green-eyed man silently returned that look.
"Cas. Cas!"
"Where were we?" The smaller purred and kissed Sam again.
The face flushed, as well as his chest, he looked down on his husband, breathing heavily.
Quietly he pushed a chair up and sat down. Carefully, he took his hand and made light circles on the back of his hand with his thumb. That gesture always calmed him, Dean knew.
"My parents died when I was little, and I grew up with my aunt. My grandmother was blind for the last 20 years of her life. But as long as I knew her, she had lived alone and maintained her independence. I spent a lot of time with her. She was a great woman, impressive, taught me a lot."
In no time Dean's bowel filled with lukewarm water, the feelings that were associated with it, made him moan again. Slowly, Cas pulled the shower head out and back in, imagining that it was his cock that kept submerging. It made him hot. It made him so unbelievably horny to see this, he could not wait to drag Dean into the bedroom, attack him and take what his body demanded.
He did not say a word, just looked at him in desperation. While the results were stable and Cas did not need artificial respiration, which was a good sign, the firefighter was still so fragile and weak. His eyes were closed, and even though everyone was hoping, no one knew exactly how many hours it would take for him to wake up.
Halstead nodded and sighed. An evening with friends and without pondering would be good for both of them.
After both had finished the mission report in the car and threw themselves a questioning shrug, Sylvie started the engine and wanted to get out of the side street, as a huge truck rushed at much too high speed on the ambulance and crashed head-on into the driver's side. It all took less than ten seconds, and none of the women had the chance to dodge. The ambulance was whirled around, the rear doors swung open, and within moments the road was paved with bandages and medical equipment before the car finally came to a stop.
Until a few hours ago, Dean would not have believed that sentence would come his way, but when he looked into the beaming eyes of his fireman, he knew that was the right decision.
With shaking hands, he plunged at the sink and looked in the mirror.
"Dean, Dean, Dean," his other self laughed. "You have died so many times and returned again. For the universe, you already count to the supernatural."
Then he kissed his forehead and his right temple, down over his cheek to his chin. Every kiss was a mixture of gentleness and despair. Dean had missed that so much. Even though his husband did not respond, he hoped he felt the same way.
"Save your sarcasm, Billie. Why?"
"Wake up and responsive," Dean hummed happily.
His heart missed a beat and completely stunned, he stared for a few moments into the expressionless, pale face.
When he felt the cold stone under his fingers, tears came into his eyes.
The relieved sigh went through the whole house when he finally got the long-awaited answer.
"Yes, that's fine."
"We decided to stay for a week, then we'll see. I do not have to tell you that it's important for him to feel that you're there."
In the past few days, if he was not at the hospital with his friend, Dean had plenty of time to think. About his life, about the people he had hurt. Until the time he met Cas, Dean did not know much about love, had many affairs, but no one had meant anything to him. You could say he was selfish and only interested in his advantage. A daredevil, regardless of losses. One of those mistakes almost cost both of them their lives.
"Yes, it is something personal. You have no idea how personal this is. Call it karma or destiny. When I visited my cousin in prison some time ago, and he told me who had arrested him, I did not know what to do with the name first. Only days later I remembered it. Take a look at the photo!"
"Do not you have to. That's going to be pretty quick."
"I'd feel better if everyone did not keep asking me how I'm doing," he grumbled.
A light red glow formed on the face of the shy man, shining around the bet with his eyes. Slightly weak on his legs, they began to tremble immediately, whereupon Dean told him to sit on the toilet lid. Although there was nothing better for Cas than to feel his husband's tongue on his own, he had not the slightest offense when the younger man knelt on the floor, spread his legs and licked and sucked where he so badly wanted it
When the black-haired man's lips opened slightly, he could not resist and leaned over to taste him again. Dean thought Cas was a fantastic kisser and knew exactly how to do it to make the butterflies fly.
Everywhere he looked, but there was no trace of his husband.
"Can we ... do we still make it to bed?"
"Do I want to know?" Boden asked when he saw the sleeping chaplain a few minutes later.
"Good morning, Dean."
His fingers wandered. Over his shoulder, back, down to his firm butt, stroking, squeezing lightly. Every movement he pursued with his eyes and imagined what it would be like if no disturbing clothes were between them.
That he had shot and stabbed him in the barn and how long, really long, it had taken to convince him that not all angels were terrible.
Gratefully, he nodded to him and his eyes beamed.
For a moment, the dark blond was not sure he had fantasized, but then he put down the guitar and sat down in bed.
"Th-thanks."
Worried, he looked at his partner, who was sitting there in silence, staring holes into space. He could well imagine what was going through her head, after all, Kim had nearly fallen victim to an attack a few hours ago.
Immediately, the young policeman took this angelic face between his hands so as not too stupid him. But retreating was the last thing Castiel wanted. His heart began to beat faster as he closed his eyes and put his lips on the other.
It was just beautiful to watch and the theme music from the movie 'Pearl Harbor'. Muscle strength and body control. Cas was fascinated and never blinked once. In the arena it was quiet, and you could feel, how everyone held their breath.
So he sat in front of the TV for another two hours and tried not to fall asleep before making his way to the small eatery on the corner of Guard 21.
"Touch me," he whispered huskily, and of course they stroked his back.
"Thank God. I was afraid that I would have to dye my hair" the Bondine giggled, clapping him on the shoulder in a friendly tone.
Trudy put a file on the table and briefly explained the case to both of them.
Now the personified temptation was in front of Dean, and all he could do was to look him up and down. A handsome man. Dean valued him a little older than himself, and what body hid under that clothing, he could only guess. But in any case, this fantasy was very inspiring. Now he could see his eyes as well, and he was sure he had never seen such deep blue, beautiful eyes.
"I love you," he whispered before his eyes became so heavy that they just closed.
After all, Dean was dead because of him. Had he not intervened ...
"Do you see, Doctor, can it be that he wakes up?"
It was an icy but beautiful Christmas day, and both decided to walk.
"No problem, honey," Dean grinned and pressed a kiss on his forehead.
It was a relief to hear the news, and with a smile, he opened Cas's sickroom. But when he saw his husband lying there with a breathing tube in his mouth and the countless devices that monitored his life, his smile died down as well.
When Cas woke in the morning and his first glance fell on the ring he smiled very briefly before his eyes became sad. At that moment, his fiancé came in.
The tears began to rise again, and two left the corner of his eye and dripped on the limp hand. Dean looked at the wet spot and wished so much for a movement.
"Um ..."
"It takes a while for me, they still want to do some tests," Gabriela muttered, grimacing.
But the alarm intervened and suddenly Orlovsky stood alone.
"Lick me ..." he shrieked, turned around and threw himself exuberantly on his husband's neck as he placed countless kisses on his face. "How are you?"
"I was careless, I'm sorry. Won `t happen again."
"Dean," he shouted, shaking him lightly. "Dean!"
"I was drunk, and he was a gentleman."
He did not know exactly why he did that. But there was something different about the way Sam looked at him and the way that angel looked at him.
With a wink, he stroked the outside of his thigh before his hand lay on the inside and pushed it upwards.
"Oh God. Cas ... Cas!"
"What should I do now, Dean?!"
"Ok, caught," Dean groaned, whereupon Cas looked at him questioningly. "My husband had a nightmare and was so sweaty that I showered him for a second."
"Sorry, but I had to bring her," he chuckled, pointing to Kim.
"He certainly did not want to hurt Gabby, the guy just could not handle the outside world and wanted to go back to jail."
"We have to find them!" Otis shouted, looking around for help.
Cas had tears of joy and emotion in his eyes, and with a short but passionate kiss, the engagement was sealed.
The time in this bright, empty room was far too slow for Dean. First, he went to and fro, then he leafed through the newspapers he had already read three times, sat down in the chair or to his husband in the bed, and now and then looked out of the window into the gray winter sky.
Cas pulled the blanket up to the tip of his nose and frowned as Dean squeezed himself into his pants, hopped a few times and waved his fingers.
The beeping became faster, just as he felt his heart racing. Could this be related? Oh, they both had noticed that too. Castiel tried to swallow again.
While decorating the tree Christmas music sounded from the radio, and both threw themselves, again and again, furtive, love glances.
"Do not let them provoke you. Stay calm."
The joy was hard to describe when, for the first time, with the rollator, he could go to the bathroom alone. Without help. A great feeling.
But he had lost a lot of blood. That was why he had become unconscious. That had to be the reason.
"Will! Is ... is Cas awake?"
"Guys, I eat!"
"What exactly happened?"
"She would have been happy for you," Cruz said, who had followed his gaze and put a hand on his shoulder.
He gripped Dean's wrist with his hand and pushed it a little higher, whereupon experienced fingers immediately wrapped themselves around the soft flesh, which hardened within a few moments.
With that, Castiel put a big cup of black, hot coffee in front of his nose. But that did not help much, and while he was snoring on one of the chairs, the chaplain was treated with an infusion of saline, vitamins and headache pills.
Not only did not the alarm sound, but he had also slept through almost eleven hours at a time. He had a good conversation with the chaplain the day before, had regained his courage and talked about all his worries from his heart. And, dammit ... He had slept through the night for days. Somehow he felt good that morning, really good.
"If he has a bomb too, that's it," Ruzek said, and Cas nodded.
A few blocks away Cas dozed off again and again. He had lost all sense of time and was so incredibly thirsty. Again and again, he ruffled his bare toes to dispel the cold that sneaked through his body. Breathing was hard for him because of the adhesive tape that was stuck over his mouth like a bomb and that lousy smell of chemicals and moisture did not make it any easier.
He wanted to tell him that they might meet again someday, but he refrained from doing so because he did not know where Dean was. He did not know if the stories of this 'empty' were true, and even if that were true, and even if Dean was there, they could at most be close, maybe sleep side by side. For eternity.
"Thank you."
When they sat in the car and drove to Colorado to kill vampires, everyone was silent. No one was sure that would work, because it has never been tried.
"We still have something to discuss. He is your problem now."
"You have thought of everything," Cas smiled and caressed almost devoutly over the shower head, which resembled a dildo.
Another fit of coughing shook him, and he wished to suffocate at that moment before the flames would reach him.
"With wet hair?!" The blonde woman frowned.
The doctor explained that you had to imagine an artificial coma like a general anesthetic. Just longer. The drugs produced an artificial unconsciousness. The patient was artificially ventilated, all essential body functions such as heart rate and blood pressure were monitored. That is, the doctors controlled this condition.
Castiel enjoyed these gentle touches, although everything was much too slow for him, and when the dark blonde finally stopped, as if he had fallen asleep in between, he put his own hand over Dean's and started to move them both. When the younger looked up, he noticed the fire in Cas's eyes and how he bit his lower lip with desire.
"Adam," Voight said, taking a deep breath. Kim collapsed into Sergeant Platt's arms and was shaken by a crying fit. The rest of the crew were united to the radio, but nobody had the right words in this situation.
"Alright. Everything will be alright."
The only thing the dark blonde could think of was that it was not already burning on the roof, because that would have meant the end for both. With last strength, Dean reached the door handle and immediately pulled his hand back screaming.
It took several hours, but the search of the intelligence finally brought some light into the matter thanks to the experienced staff.
"Is not that the address where Brett and Dawson were called. Why suddenly a traffic accident?" Herrmann wanted to know and slipped out of the shoes in no time and into the boots.
"I do not look bad, right?"
Of course, he had therapies behind him, for a little boy it was not easy to process all that. That was why he went to the fire department. In each rescued child he saw himself again, with each victim he felt guilty. That was his way of dealing with the experience. He thought he deserved it.
"Did not take long."
"The best gift for me is that you are healthy again and with me. That we can celebrate Christmas together and that you love me. You do not have to give me anything, Cas."
"Maybe you should sit up for your brain to regroup in the middle," he replied cheekily.
"No fake shame, take it like a grown-up," he joked, trying to be as careful as possible, not to hurt him.
"No stupid single bed in the hospital."
"I did not risk my ass for you, so you give up now. We did it right away. If necessary, I carry you, and if that does not work, I'll drag you out of your hair here. Do you hear?"
"Why did you do that?"
The aim of this vulgarity was Cas because the two made fun of his trench coat.
Shortly before his upcoming dismissal, he cycled for half an hour on the ergometer. A little later, he felt muscles that he had never even suspected existed.
"Should we gain access?" Burgess asked.
An exaggerated defense reaction of the body usually led to the fact that a blood poisoning can run out of control because the immune system triggers a violent inflammation in the whole body, which gradually detects the vital organs. Thus, this defense would turn into the opposite, not only against the invaded gems but against the own body itself. Small blood vessels would be damaged and get leaks. Large amounts of fluid entered the tissues, causing blood clots to get out of control and more and more vessels in the body becoming clogged. The consequence of this was hypoxia, which massively impaired the function of the organs and against which the heart tries to pump with decreasing force until the circulation collapsed, the organs failed, and death occurred.
When he raised his head and looked at Cas, he noticed the shimmering tears in his green eyes.
Dean retook his hands and kissed both. Seeing his friend so upset gave him a stab right in the heart. He lovingly put a hand on his cheek and stroked the tears away with his thumb.
The scenes that took place before Cas's eyes were the greatest thing he had experienced in a long time.
When Cas realized that he had to go to the bathroom, he reported to the nurse, who then only said that he should just let it run because the catheter would fix that. That, the black-haired had to admit, he found very useful.
"So hard for me ... Cas," Dean growled between hot kisses and every minute movement sent electric shocks through their bodies.
The second day was the same except that Dean felt his husband was getting worse. Breathing was more laborious for him; his eyes opened only once.
For days his friend was talking about a surprise, and Cas was more excited than he had been in a long time.
"The universe was so tired of watching you, two idiots. To watch you at your eye-fuck, constantly these deliberate or accidental touches and nothing has happened. We had all bets on it, and a deal is a deal. Ten years are over. You surely know that. And since you two fools could not confess your love to each other, one of you had to die. Plain and simple."
Dean came shuffling into the kitchen and muttered to his brother a sleepy 'good morning', who was already sitting at the table again staring at his laptop.
"Now many things become clear to me. I saw you leaving the bar with Dean last night. Was there something going on? "
But to be honest, he did not want to be in any of these places, but rather sit in the bunker on the couch, preferably with Cas and Sam and drink a beer. He even missed the lewd little angel a little bit. He wondered if they would look for him.
These threats went back and forth for a few moments before the other policeman grabbed Dean by the arm and pulled away before it could escalate. The last words he heard were that he had enough contacts outside and that it would be better to look over his shoulder in the future.
Dean stood at the desk, waiting for Sergeant Platt's instructions.
Maybe it was also the fact that their problem child had finally found someone he was serious about, which had caused his parents to give him his inheritance prematurely.
"And you do not deserve to live!"
"But only if I'm allowed to drive," the fireman grinned.
Again and again, Cas heard his husband desperately calling his name. This voice became weaker and weaker until he did not hear it anymore.
"Excuse me," the three of them heard before Billie disappeared again.
"Yes, but I have never noticed it so extreme, it looks like one of them is swollen. Does that hurt?"
Alarmed, the dark blonde jumped up and hugged his husband, only then saw the unmistakable cup and whispered wickedly and with a wink, whether he would need a hand. Castiel just shrugged his shoulders silently, but that was enough for Dean, and he pulled him back into the bathroom, locked the door and turned around with a grin.
"We found fingerprints of these two model boys on the car bomb. You will observe the house. "
Deep down, she had the fear that it would happen sooner or later.
"Do not worry, Chief. I'm fine," he muttered as he scrambled to his feet again.
Of course, he tried that as best he could to hide, but as I said, Dean was not stupid.
Cas did not have to wait long for an answer.
When he retired, he instead took the warm hands of the black-haired in his.
"I can not guarantee anything if you can not keep your head steady," Cas countered with a grin.
"He's tough. Do not worry," he replied with a pat on the back and went to the car to get some water.
"You are the newbie. Can you cook?"
If sepsis is well advanced and the circulation is attacked, it is called a septic shock. Sometimes the artificial coma is the last chance to help the body get through the biochemical chaos in its bloodstream and organs," Will explained in detail. "If the lungs and cardiovascular system stop functioning properly, then they can use artificial respiration and infusions to ensure the body's oxygenation.
"Oh god, Dean!"
After all three had told the story, Rowena sat down because her head was smoking.
As Dean, he was not a muscle pack, but you could tell they were holding their bodies in shape. For two years, Cas was no longer so close to a man, and he was nervous.
I can only imagine what you've heard all about me, but I can do it differently. I'll try ... with you. If you give me a chance."
Gabriela kept the word in her throat when she saw Dean while she and her colleague walked quickly with the gurney through the door of the emergency room. After asking her colleague to continue, she frowned at him and asked what he was doing in the hospital. Now the cat was out of the bag, and Dean could not hide it from the curious Latina, who of course gave him a sermon.
"Would you believe me when I say that this is my best Christmas? Friends who have grown more in my heart than I can express. A man who means everything to me and cakes and cookies until we fall over."
Sighing, the hunter shook his head, but Gabriel was right. He could not stay there. Meanwhile, the third day had dawned, and so they decided to put him in the cooling chamber.
The anesthesiologist explained to the young policeman, tapping his feet nervously on the ground, that he should not be too hopeful, for recovering from a coma was not the way you knew it from movies. No sudden sitting in bed and babble. It was usually a lengthy process that could last for days.
Unlike Sylvie, her colleague was quickly freed and was driven by ambulance to the Chicago Med.
First, he pushed with his against the beer bottle which was held out to him before he cleared his throat.
"How do you know ..."
In no time there were two nurses in the room grabbing the bedside.
Everywhere he was carefully inspected. Ears, mouth, eyes ...
"What?"
Kim's words echoed in his ears. No, he would prove it to everyone. He would show everyone that Dean Winchester had changed. And he wanted to do it right. He and Cas did not even have a first date.
Damn, what was that? He was so embarrassed and quickly moved away.
After he was lovingly brought to bed by his husband, the nurse came to give him a pubic shave. Mumbling, Dean left the room because that's what he wanted to see.
"Stop chatting and just do your wor ..."
Somewhat dizzy, since the three hours of sleep were not enough, he dragged himself out of bed. Such a 24-hour shift was already tough, but on the other hand, he was looking forward to two days off, a hot shower, a little sleep in his bed, and the afternoon when he finally saw Dean again.
The young firefighter did not feel like laughing, much more he felt he had to vomit. He had no time to think about the fact that he had just shot a man because the two had to get out of here immediately.
Reflexively he grabbed the back of his head and felt nothing. No wound, no blood, no sticky hair or pain. But he knew he had died.
"I want to be in you, Dean. Please ..."
"Kim. Nice that you're finally here," Cas groaned as he tried in vain to close the cufflinks himself.
As if by appointment, Cas sat a few blocks away in the bar. He did not notice the excitement and took turns looking for the door and his cell phone.
For Dean, a world collapsed. In what condition would he wake up? What if Cas would never wake up?
"Well done. Dean. They wake up."
He also could handle a little thing, and so he nodded to Adam. It was almost dark outside, and they were nearly the only ones in the canteen, and though his stomach rumbled, the young policeman poked listlessly in his food.
Of course, he knew that these correctly trained people of this unit had all the means to track down the kidnapper or kidnappers. And, of course, he knew it was a suicide squad trying to do it alone.
He wondered what was wrong with him, for his hands began to sweat, and he could not overcome turning his head. Something was different because he usually had no trouble talking to people. Maybe it was the fact that the two had seen each other a few times, but had not exchanged a single word.
