"Come on Capsicle, don't be so pissy. You got her number didn't you?" Tony grumbled, not taking his eyes off Steve. "Yeah, no thanks to you." Steve huffed, collecting the plates. He stared at the half melted candles, hoping that they would set aflame once again, and with them, the night would once again set back to the way it was, the way it was before they went to the bar, before Tony decided that getting drunk would be a good idea.
Steve pulled away, and looked at his lover. “What do you mean?” The blond asked, studying his face. “You know exactly what I mean. I can’t keep lying to Pepper. She… She deserves better than this.” Tony held his head in his hands, and sat back on the couch. Steve wrapped an arm around him, and Tony sighed heavily. “I love you Steve, I really do, but-“ “But you loved her first.” the soldier finished, feeling a sick feeling rise in his stomach. “I just don’t know what to do- I keep having nightmares, I feel so guilty.” Tony's voice broke, and a single tear tried to escape.
The brunette walked into his large kitchen and started a pot of coffee, smiling at the bright day seeping in through the curtains. He had almost forgotten about yesterday, but he still wanted to let Steve know that he wouldn't get away with a stunt like that so easily.
"Fine, he wants to be alone? I'll leave him alone." Tony growled as he headed back up to his room. He hopped onto the elevator, where Clint and Natasha were having a small argument. "It's not time to tell them!" she whispered quickly, not noticing the doors had opened. "They're going to find out sooner or-" Clint stopped mid-sentence as Tony hopped onto the car. "Hey Stark, what's up?" he asked, pulling Natasha close.
"Watch it Stark, I don't talk that way about your girlfriend." Steve growled, and both Christine and Tony looked at him in surprise. "So she's your girlfriend is she?" The brunette smirked. "How does it feel knowing you got my sloppy seconds?" "I swear to God-" Steve began advancing towards him, but Fury's voice snapped him out of it. "Enough! Both of you get back to your rooms, and get out." he ordered, switching his vision between the two.
Their hands connected, and Tony turned sharply upwards back toward the roof top. He pulled Steve up close, holding him as they flew upwards. They landed with a soft thud at the top of the building, the snow cushioning their fall. Both lay there, staring up at the stars, breathless. Their adrenaline surged, and Steve thought his heart would explode from his chest.
Tony didn’t respond. He simply looked up, and stared into Steve’s blue eyes. And in them, Steve found the answer.
The others followed, going their separate ways to get themselves prepared. "Captain," Fury's voice stopped Steve in the hall as he was on his way to get his suit. "Director," Steve replied as he turned to face the man. "Keep your personal affairs out of this mission; I need all of you back alive." His voice was serious, and Steve understood. He knew that Fury was referring to the ongoing fight between the men; he was still oblivious to what had recently happened. "Understood." The soldier said, and said goodbye to Fury as he went to get his suit on.
"No, you're just another hallucination. Now leave me alone." Tony snapped, glaring at Steve's chest. He couldn't look him in the eyes. He just couldn't. It would cause him too much pain. "Tony, how can I prove it to you? I'm not a hallucination, I swear." Steve asked, begging really.
Tony wiped away a tear. "I'm sorry I made you think that I wanted to get rid of you. I'm sorry for all the times we fought. At least one good thing comes out of this. I got to hear the first time you say your dad." Peter closed his eyes, and clenched his fists. You're the worst father ever, I hate you. He wished he could take it back. But it was too late now. The last words he ever said to his father were the ones he never thought he would say. "I'm sorry Dad.." He whispered, even though he knew Tony couldn't hear him. "I love you Peter, and I don't want you to think for a split second that I don't." Tony says, and Peter looks up. "I love you to Dad," he mutters, and the video goes black. He slowly gets up, turns off the equipment, and goes downstairs to Steve's bedroom.
The soldier's body tensed at the feeling of Tony's fingers within him, pumping them, and his breathing hitched. "Tony, please. Just
Another older work of mine. I had a version in which Tony succeeds, but it was lost on my old Tumblr.
"I'm sorry for insulting you the other day." Tony said quietly. "I'm sorry for snapping at you, I should be grateful, you saved my ass back there." Steve apologized awkwardly. "Well, it's in the past now," Tony said, a fake smile on his face.
Steve crossed his arms on the table, and put his head down on them. He closed his eyes, but the image of Tony's face caused them to flash open. He groaned slightly, wanting nothing more than some freaking sleep. "Everything alright Steve?" Bruce asked, taking a seat next to him. The soldier looked up at him, mouthing, "No." Bruce was about to ask what was wrong when Tony walked in. Steve immediately sat up, averting his eyes from the approaching man.
Steve opened his mouth to start screaming at him, but stopped. "You disobey my orders again," he growled, face only inches from Tony's, "And I won't be saving you at all." He marched off as the rescue vehicles began to arrive, there to pick up the men. The Hulk finally returned to Bruce, who stood naked as he and Clint watched Tony take off, obviously not in the mood to be in the same place as Steve.
"Me? Oh what on Earth would give you that impression? I'm simply saying that you're withholding some amount of truth from me about certain information that seems quite, oh, I don't know, necessary, for two people to begin to form a relationship of any kind." Toni sipped lightly on her water, helping to hide her smirk.
Steve smiled, looking down at their hands. "I promise." Tony took in a shaky breath, and let go of the blond's hand, before taking a step back and looking up at him, a broken smile on his face. "Take your room key, I want to make sure you know you're always welcomed back." He said, biting his lip. "Thank you, Mr. Stark." The soldier said, holding out his hand. "Anytime Captain. I hope you find what you're looking for out there." The brunette said, shaking the other man's hand.
He began crawling out slowly, and Steve chuckled as he watched the grown man crawl across the floor like a two year old. "You'll never cease to amuse me Stark." Tony peeped up from behind the couch, a scowl on his face. "Shut up and make the coffee. I'm going for some aspirin." he grumbled, continuing his journey to the bathroom. It was then that Steve noticed Stark wore nothing but a pair of boxers, and a blush crawled slowly up his face. He couldn't break his stare with Tony's butt; it was...
. He decided, and watched as Tony got them a few drinks. He came back with two shots, and Steve shook his head. "Oh come on, you gotta do em." The brunette laughed, and handed one to the other man. "Fine, but just one." He said, and they toasted, before downing the burning liquid.
Tony snapped out of his daydream to see he was now alone in the kitchen, and his slices of toast had been put out. He decided not to question it, and simply pulled out the butter from the refrigerator. It's going to be a long day. Tony thought, and made his way out to the balcony, leaving the bright sun to melt the butter on the counter.
“Natasha taught me; told me if I was gonna keep you I had to learn how to show you up every once in a while.” Steve said, lowering his voice as they reached the couple.
“Well, what are we all waiting for?” Tony asked, about to dive his fork into the ham. “Wait! We need to say grace!” Pepper swatted Tony’s hand away, and the man groaned. “Really Pepper?” She shot him a look that needed no explanation. Everyone joined hands, and Pepper allowed Steve to do the honors. “Dear Lord, we thank you for these gifts were are about to receive. We thank you for our family and friends, and those we hold close to our hearts.” Steve gave a quick squeeze to Tony’s hand. “Thank you for allowing us to spend another day on this Earth, and allow us to spend a few more.”
. Thought Steve, a smile spreading across his handsome face. Clint looked in disdain at Tony, a pitiful look in his eyes. "No, n-no more." the assassin mumbled. Bruce took one last gulp of his iced tea, and placed a five on the table. "I think it's time to get him home. You guys wanna catch a cab or should I come back for you two?" Tony dismissed him with a wave of his hand.
Steve moaned at the feeling of Tony's stiff cock against his own, loving the way his heat felt. Tony grabbed Steve's shoulders, and spun him so that he was now below Tony. He smiled, and dragged his teeth across his lips. He grabbed the blond's firm ass, and quickly grabbed his cock with the other hand. His eyes widened, and filled with pleasure. Tony began to stroke him, and moved his way down to Steve's body, kissing his neck, his chest, and finally reaching his pecs. He bit down on Steve's nipple, and he cried out. "Like that big boy?" Tony growled, letting his tongue flick over it, showing it some affection.
"And I couldn't ask for a better group of friends." They all raised their drinks in approval, even Tony. Steve sighed, happy to see all his friends together.
Steve saw Tony wave down a waiter, and gave him the check. Christine noticed as well. She leaned in, and whispered in Steve's ear, "Kiss me." "No!" Steve whispered harshly. "Kiss me or I release them." she hissed. He saw Pepper and Tony getting closer. He turned his face to Christine's, and put a hand on her neck as he kissed her.
It just didn't seem real, the whole war of the worlds thing. It was... almost like a dream... But it wasn't. As much as everyone wished it was, it hadn't been, and it never would be. What happened happened, and nothing could change that. Tony shook his head and flipped on the plasma screen, trying to find something to watch. Anything to get his mind off now.
He stared quietly, unsure of what to do. But he didn't have to do anything, as the previews began, and the theatre was filled with sound. Ashley pulled back, and the two sat silent for the rest of the film, Ashley out of embarrassment, and Steve out of confusion. What had stopped him from kissing her? It was almost as if he knew he would have felt guilty about it later. Tony suddenly worked his way into his mind, and Steve felt his heartbeat quicken.
Tony tied his robe closed, giving the blond a dirty look. "What's wrong Rogers? Can't keep up with the times?" He smirked at the other man, who responded with his own dirty look. "Just turn the music down would you?" He skulked off, leaving an amused Tony to himself.
Steve was left standing in the middle of the room, alone. He eyed the Christmas tree one more time, before heading towards the bathroom. He locked the door behind him, splashing some cool water on his face. “Relax Steve; you can make it through a simple dinner. Just,” He paused, thinking he heard footsteps.  “Just fake it.” He turned off the water, and dried his face with a towel.  He came out of the bathroom, and the smell of a Christmas ham wafted over to him.
Steve placed his fist in front of Tony's face, and slowly made his way to the man's perfect hair. "Wait! Uncle! Uncle!" Tony pleaded, and Steve released the man, who glared at him. The blond simply laughed, and Natasha walked in on the fun. "Well, looks like you two are having a fun time, 'training'." She put air quotes around the last word, causing Steve to laugh even harder. Tony shoved him hard, and the super soldier fell onto the ropes.
"Alright, we're home, you can put me down now!" Tony complained. His hips were starting to hurt, as Steve had actually carried him all the way home. Even if it had only been a few blocks, that didn't mean it didn't hurt like hell when the blond decided to take the stairs. But he couldn't totally complain. The ride home had given him a nice view.
“Praise the universe!” Tony called out, and everyone laughed. “Alright, now who wants some ham, and who wants turkey?”
"Hey! Stop! What the hell are you doing Stark?" Steve cried out, trying to fight off the clingy man. "Hey guys did I-" The fight broke as the two looked over to see the stunned Natasha standing in the doorway, mouth gaping open. Steve's shirt was half off, exposing his abs, and Tony had him pressed up against the refrigerator.
Tony showed up about ten minutes later, and sighed when he spotted Steve. "Hi." he muttered. Steve motioned for him to sit. Tony sat across from him, looking curiously at the manila folder. "What's-" He started, but Steve cut him off. "We're through Stark." Tony looked up. "W-what?" "We're through. It's best for everyone if we just pretend like none of this ever happened." Steve stated, avoiding Tony's eyes.
Stephanie laughed a bit, before Toni finally allowed herself to be led back to the table. She seated herself, claiming that she didn't want to be doted on like some sort of little girl. The other woman accepted the fact, taking her own seat. The waiter returned, taking both women's orders for drinks. Toni ordered a glass of pinot grigio, while Stephanie opted for a cream soda.
"Steve, relax. We can use this time as a chance to give you some dancing lessons." Tony stood up and stretched, then turned to his friend. Steve stared awkwardly, and rubbed the back of his neck. "I don't know Tony, why don't I-" Tony placed his hand over Steve's mouth to silence him. "Steve, shut up." He took Steve's hand in his and pulled him towards the dance floor. Other couples danced close to the current slow song, and it was nearing its end.
Steve simply smiled, acting as if he cared. “Thank you, but you know; I’ve never been much of a dancer.” he said, flashing one of his heart melting smiles. “Oh don’t be so modest! You were amazing!” The woman giggled, twirling her hair. “I’m sorry; I never caught your name.”
"What's the matter? You scared?" The man asked, getting closer to Steve's face, the smell of alcohol overpowering. "Hey! Leave him alone would you?" Tony intervened, glaring at the drunk. "Ooh, look at this, now we got the little guy, Tony Stark isn't it?" The man asked, and turned his attention away from Steve to the small brunette. "You here with this guy? I never took you for a fag Stark, I thought higher of you." He laughed, and pushed Tony. He was taken off guard, and stumbled back a bit. "What did you call me?" he asked, hands balling into fists. The drunk laughed, before grabbing Tony by the collar, and looking him in the eye. "A disgusting, cock sucking, dick loving, faggot!" The man snarled, and threw Tony back, causing him to fall back onto the counter and hit his head.
"Bucky! Noooooo!" Steve roared, and suddenly he was back in his room. Steve looked around the dark room, and realized it was all a dream. "Bucky..." he whispered, and buried his head in his hands. Sobs rocked his whole body as he grieved over his lost friend. Tony bounded in through the bedroom door, followed by Bruce and Clint. "You okay Cap?" The man asked, looking disheveled as he ran over to Steve's bedside.
He had been working in his lab alone when it happened. A familiar voice called out to him, but he chose to ignore it. I'm just hallucinating again. He thought, and continued his work. A pair of hands turned him around, and pulled him into a tight hug. "Tony! Tony it's me!" the blond said, on the verge of tears from happiness. "That's wonderful." Tony grumbled, pushing the other off of him. Steve stared at him in disbelief. "What? Tony, I'm home, I'm alive!" he said, tears streaming down his face.
“Ah, I’m off to dance, anyone want to join?” Tony asked, wiggling his eyebrows in Steve’s direction. “You go ahead. I need a bit of a break.” Steve said, waving his hand. Clint grabbed Natasha’s hand, and asked her for a dance. She nodded, placing her shot down, and the three headed for the dance floor.
Steve remained silent. He stared down at the lifeless body of his ex-husband, the only man he had ever truly loved. He was completely numb, he didn’t understand. Why would Tony push him away at a time when he needed his family the most?
He walked around the granite island and shoved purposefully into Tony, causing steaming black coffee to splash and burn his hand. “God dammit!” The brunette yelped, shaking his hand in pain as the coffee continued to burn him. “Funny thing for an atheist to say don’t you think?” Steve smiled, scooping Folgers into the coffee maker. Tony stared daggers into Steve’s back. “Dumb Christian.” he mumbled under his breath.
Tony smiled. "You'd be right." he chuckled, kissing back. "I love you." He whispered, and nestled his head in the crook of Steve's neck. "I love you too." the soldier whispered back. They held each other for a moment, listening to the quiet sizzling of the bacon on the skillet, before the sound of a door slamming shut alerted them of someone's presence. Both men looked up, still wrapped in their embrace, to Pepper, who stood in the middle of the room, the look of betrayal obvious. Her lip quivered; she looked like she was going to cry. "Pepper-" Tony started, moving from Steve's grip to where she stood.
The audience cheered, and Steve and Tony looked up, panting for breath. They looked at each other, and began to laugh. Steve pulled Tony up, and the two took a bow. Clint and Natasha waved them over, and they made their way towards them. “Where did you learn to dance like that Cap?” Tony panted, still a bit exasperated from the display.
“Natasha taught me; told me if I was gonna keep you I had to learn how to show you up every once in a while.” Steve said, lowering his voice as they reached the couple.
“Hey Steve! Glad to see you made it okay!” Clint said, greeting him with a smile. “Everyone is around the tree; I’ll show you where to put your presents.” Steve nodded, and walked quickly with the smaller man to the living room. “Woah…” he gasped, and stopped short upon entering the living room. The tree was huge, and decorated with ornaments of all kinds; old ones, new ones, ones that lit up and ones that sparkled.  A small train wrapped around the bottom of the tree, and Steve smiled. It was like the one he used to have when he was a kid.
Natasha smiled, knowing that he took the bait. "You, you are a tricky one Romanov." Tony chuckled, laughing so he wouldn't start crying. He turned around slowly, putting his hands up in mock surrender. "Alright you caught me. So what? You gonna go tell everyone?" he asked, staring down at the ground, a forced smile on his face.
"Steve? You up here?" Tony poked his head out the roof top door, the cold immediately nipping at his face. He shuddered, and heard a low voice. "I think that's the first time you ever called me Steve." The voice said quietly. Tony stepped out to find Steve sitting on the edge of the roof, hunched over. "Cap? What are you doing up here?" The brunette asked, rubbing his arms to keep warm.
"God, so either you tell the world yourself, and lose Steve and Pepper... Or you hide from the world, dealing with the pain of seeing Steve with a woman, and suffer in silence until Christine decides she's done with you?" Bruce sighed, and looked up at his friend. "I'm so sorry Tony...." Tony laughed sadly. "I don't know what to do Bruce, I mean; she told me she'd call me when she knew what she wanted from me... But it's been a few months since then... What if she just wanted Steve? What if that's how she plans to get back at me?" "I think it'd be the easiest thing she could do." Bruce said quietly.
Tony flew off; making sure Steve was positioned safely on his back. The blond laughed with joy, he had never seen so much of the city, and it was beautiful. Tony decided to show off, and moved Steve from his back to his front, so they were staring at each other. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony's neck, and the brunette spun them around, causing Steve to yell with fright, but grin with excitement. Tony laughed, and focused on where they were going.
"We have more than that Steve!" The brunette defended, blinking back his tears. "We- we've been through all this shit together! I was there when you cried, I held you through your nightmares, you've seen my ugly side, you know what I'm like but you still love-"
"See? We can still be lovers." Tony whispered, keeping a bored look on his face. “I know Tony, but I-" Steve began, but stopped when he heard the soft music beginning to play. A slow smile spread across his face. "You want to dance Mr. Stark?" he asked, releasing Tony's hand and beginning to stand. The brunette looked up in shock. "Do you think you can?" he asked, looking the soldier up and down.
Tony shot him a dirty look, and ignored his comment. "Jeez, where the hell are they all?" He was tired, and he simply wanted to go home and hole himself up in his lab.
"Give me my shirt!" Tony said as he placed his cup on the counter, diving towards the super soldier. Steve was caught off guard, and yelped as he was pushed against the counter, coffee spilling, and the shirt being ripped off his body.
"Well, what's there to say? I'm a small town girl, and I grew up with a nice family. We had our days, but other than that, things were great..." Ashley began, and Steve tried to act interested. He wanted to look like a gentleman, but he couldn't stop looking at the back of a familiar man.
this was some hot shit. "Come on Capsicle, you gonna just stand there and get a stiffy or are you actually gonna give a little here?" Tony breathed, nibbling lightly on Steve's ear. He could give less of a shit as this point, he was so wasted that this could be not even Steve anymore, and it wouldn't even make a difference. He just wanted to fuck something good and hard, and if was the hot blond named Steve Rogers, bonus points.
He finally made it to his destination, and looked up the hill. If he could just get a good aim, he could end this all.
"Coming at you!" Bruce yelled, and jumped on top of the other three. "How did I end up on the bottom?" Steve giggled, and Tony gave him a playful look. "Aren't you always?" he joked, and received a playful shove from Steve that sent them all flying off the super soldier. "Sorry guys!" he chuckled, and helped them up. "Natasha sent me out here to tell you guys dinner is ready." Bruce announced, brushing snow out of his hair. The three nodded, and began to head inside. Tony quickly pulled Steve aside, and whispered, "You know you're going to have to finish what you started later." he purred, and Steve smirked. "And you know that I'll show you who's bottom." Steve muttered back, stealing a quick kiss before the two men headed inside.
"I have a few friends on the inside. That, and S.H.I.E.L.D isn't too hard to break in to when you've got technology like mine." Toni spoke with some pride, earning her a quirked eyebrow from the woman before her. "So, Captain, now that you know I know all about you, does that make you want to get up and leave?"
"Can I speak to you in your office?" Steve asked through clenched teeth. He didn't give her time to answer before he grabbed her by the arm and lightly pulled her into the nearby office, no one even trying to stop him. He slammed the door behind them, and Christine's eyes were wide with fear. "What's this about?" she asked, thinking about where she had the mace placed in her drawer. "How could you tell Pepper? We had a deal!" The soldier practically screamed, losing his composure.
Tony pulled Steve closed, and allowed the blond to begin the lead. "Let's see what you got Cap." he said, eyes full of passion. Steve led him backwards, and Tony lifted his leg to allow Steve to dip him. He did as prompted and lifted Tony back up only to spin them around. Neither noticed the dance floor clearing in order to make way for the dancing couple.
"Exactly. We know nothing about each other, let's face it, I just fell in love with a pretty face. I don't want that Tony, I want more than that..."
"No thanks, we're going to head out. We'll meet you at HQ, Banner and Thor are coming along." Clint answered before Natasha could ask another question. Steve nodded, and grabbed the pot, pouring himself and Tony a cup. Clint smiled and began walking out the door, tugging lightly on Natasha's hand. She looked at him, and then back at Steve, her eyes full of curiosity, and assumptions.
He swallowed a hard lump in his throat; he just had to think of him didn't he? Steve moved slowly towards the door, and when he saw everyone was pre-occupied, he sneaked out of the room, heading up to the rooftop.
"Yeah, I love him, I love him way more than I have ever loved anyone, and I probably always will, but he doesn't love me. And I can't completely destroy what we finally built just because I'm in love, I'm... I can't be that selfish. It's better for everyone if I just keep my mouth shut, pretend like it doesn't hurt every time he puts his arms around her waist, it doesn't hurt every time she kisses him, and he kisses her back." He blinked back his tears. He wasn't going to cry, not in front of someone.
Something warns her. The scrape of a boot sole on the concrete behind her. A whisper of cloth on skin. A hiss of breath quietly released. The sudden, sharp flare of static in the red star. In the reflection of the glass, there’s a murky shape blurring towards her, tall and hazy and dark, except for on the left, which is a bright gleam grey with a smear of scarlet.
“Nah,” Kate says, and steals his last slice of pizza out of the two-day-old box, makes a face after the first bite, mumbles something unintelligible around her mouthful, and then eats the rest of the slice. “We,” she says, still chewing, “took a trip to the Iliad offsite storage facility and raided their server farms. There’s probably a lot of worthless junk in there, but you went looking for information, right?” At Tony’s slow, wary nod, she grins, pushes her sunglasses to the top of her head and spreads both hands above the bounty of jump drives. “I give you data.”
“One: you are the only SHIELD liaison I will work with. They try to replace you, or you go mysteriously missing and a not-previously-cleared temp liaison shows up? All bets are off. You, or your officially hand-picked replacement, or we don’t work with SHIELD at all.”
Toni growls. “Gates is too good for you. You’re going straight to Google, you hear me? Let’s see how you enjoy being a cluster server for captcha processing. It was
The headache pounds, and he struggles to move his arms and legs, to fight, to run. Feels sweat bead on his forehead, feels his face twitch. Curls his fingers into a fist at his side.
Toni fires her boot jets, sudden and powerful, and flings her arms upward. Her attacker is solid and heavy, but the suit augments her strength. The throw, augmented by the momentum from the jets, slams her attacker head-first into the ceiling.
Oh you guys... you have no idea how much your comments make my day and make me want to get more words out to you as soon as my fingers can type them. I <3 U guys too.
Coulson folds his arms and just watches her steadily. “Not in so many words, no,” he says, “but he made it clear his office was bugged. He couldn’t say so directly. But I understood what he meant.”
”Thanks, J. Appreciate the updates.” She slicks her hair back from her face, and reaches up to adjust the shower head to it’s hard massage setting, jacks the faucet left until the water is almost hotter than she can stand. She slumps under the spray, head bowed forward, and groans in sheer bliss as the scalding pulses pound the knots out of her neck and shoulders.
“Pass,” he says, and Kobik’s face goes dark and glowering. It’s a gamble, and a very risky one at that, but he ignores the army of cosmic-cube puppets and wills the fires to burn brighter, hotter. “What you’re offering isn’t friendship, but enslavement.”
“Yes you did,” Nat replies, amused. “But it’s fine, Steve. I don’t have feelings you can hurt. It’s making you uncomfortable, frustrated and edgy, so I’ll drop it. You already know what you have to do. We’re all just hoping you’ll get around to doing it.” She shakes her hair back out of her face and resumes her pose on the stool.
Tony smiles, opens his eyes, and settles his hands on either side of Steve’s face. “You begged me to wake up and try to stop you,” Tony says softly, and takes an immense amount of satisfaction in the way Steve’s eyes go wide and panicked. “And sweetheart, here I am, just like you asked for.”
Bucky snorts a laugh. “Jesus, yes. Exactly like that. That unimpressed eyebrow and the way she could drag out your name to mean a hundred things. You're gonna love her, Stevie. Toni’s so--”
She distracts herself by flying as close as she dares to the cliff face, figuring the intense concentration required to keep the tips of her knees and chest from banging into the sheer rock wall will be enough to prevent her from overriding JARVIS’s privacy protocols and demanding answers.
The HUD turns red, and the target matrix locks on a blur of motion coming towards her. She only has enough time to register its presence, not enough to get out of the way. The HUD scatters, goes crazy, jitters and reels, as one-two-three fists slam into her faceplate, and her head rocks back with each blow.
Machine guns bristle from the van three’s windows, and Toni throws herself in front of James instinctively, pulling him in and down to shield  him with the bulk of the armor. The HUD registers multiple impacts, flashing reminders about structural integrity.
She grins. “Well, not only did I finish your arm early this morning,” she says, “it’s also the third day post-registration, so it’s pretty much official, honey.” Her eyes are dancing above her coffee cup. “Courier should be picking up the DSMR cards for you and me today, dropping them off this afternoon to the office. Our bond is officially recognized in the eyes of the law.”
JARVIS never seems to mind answering, though; his tone never shifts from its usual pleasant register. “Seven minutes, thirty seconds, sir. I am now within range to connect with the JRV-Malibu servers, and am downloading pertinent updates.”
“You know something, Steve?” he says conversationally as he wraps his arms around Steve's waist, braces against the teeth-rattling crunch of hitting the world's most stubborn supersoldier like a wrecking ball, and only sheds a few involuntary tears of pain at the jolt ripping through his abused shoulder when he shears abruptly upward to carry them both to the secondary, mostly empty VIP deck. “I think you forgot to mention a few things the other day when I asked you to fill me in on the stuff I missed while I was asleep. Why don't we talk about that now?”
Bucky freezes, heart hammering in his chest. For a moment, it feels like a panic attack rising, but it’s not like that at all. It’s… Jesus, it’s deep and it’s wondered and it’s
“Toni, get the fuck up off the floor!” He’s not sure what makes him reach out, slap his hand over the red star and shove like he’s trying to push through her rib cage, but he does it, and a jolt of heat and light and bright, jagged electricity jangles along his nerves. “

“Thank you, Captain Danvers,” Magneto says primly, and cuts an ominous and imposing figure as he descends like a god-emperor from the sky to begin tossing quinjets and metal-based weapons around the deck with negligent waves of his hand. A moment later, Thor lands to one side of him and Carol to the other, and Tony’s kind of impressed at how quickly they clear tarmac big enough for both quinjets to touch down and spill their passengers out into the fracas.
Behind his back, his fingers curl into fists. “If the Phoenix can be shown the way...” he begins, and closes his mouth again as Schmidt waves him silent.
over the line, and I’ll grab Toni, and you and I will disappear with her. We’re very good at disappearing. They’d never find us.”
And special thanks to state_line_of_texas, who tolerated my temporary abandonment of her promptfic verse for the sake of this beast with good humor. Cheers, doll.
He doesn’t mind pencil and charcoal on his skin anyway. It reminds him of better times. It reminds him to be careful and take his time lest he ruin his work, which is a lesson he thinks the world forgot somewhere along the way.
Eventually, a chime dings softly, which Fitz has learned is JARVIS’s version of clearing his throat. “Pardon, Dr. Fitz, but an encrypted email has just arrived for you from Malibu. It is flagged as an urgent matter.”
Tony stayed where he was, meeting Steve's angry glare. Their eyes locked, and the lump was back in Steve's throat. Same with Tony's stomach knots. "Just, come out with me tonight. I'll get the guys together, we'll have some fun!" The smaller man pleaded.
He finished up and grabbed a towel wrapping it around his lower body. Walking into the kitchen, he found a note, and picked it up. It read:
Steve growled against Tony's skin, causing the other man to shiver, and buck his hips into the blond's.
"You're always bored Tony, except for when you're in your workshop." Bruce commented as he took the seat beside Tony and reached for a potato of his own to begin peeling. “On second thought” his brow furrowed and he added as an afterthought, "You haven't seemed bored as a teacher."
“Share the water and bring us round; Rom are to the atchin’-tan bound.” he murmured softly, thinking deeply as he struggled to recall the old chant Catalina had taught his Ma, to draw the members of the familia together again. “Merry we’ll meet and merry we’ll part. Merry will be the company found.”
“Ian!” Ian froze as his father stalked toward him. Tony felt the hair on his arms raise and fought the urge to lean away, faced with the sheer intensity of Stefen’s gaze as he bore down on them. When he was toe to toe with Ian he spoke again, very lowly.
"I'm not here to hurt you." He tried again, voice shaking and Wanda whimpered, burying her face in her brother's arms and murmuring something lowly in German that Tony could only catch pieces of over the sounds of the storm outside.
“They took my girls.” The confession came raw and bleating, like something that would come from the throat of an animal rather than a man and Bucky cringed. Dvorak’s shuddered breath was loud and jagged like broken glass in the room. He choked on a sob, tears leaking out the corner of squinted hate-filled eyes as he lifted a shaking hand to clutch at the arm Bucky held the gun with desperate clasping fingers.
James swallowed thickly and lowered his eyes, mulishly silent but Tony didn’t really need an answer. He already knew. All too well.
Sudden fear seized Natacha’s insides like a cold hand, squeezing at her heart, and she dashed after him, certain that she couldn't let him leave and without a clue how to make him stay.
The people, eager to see their dreams of a return to the ‘homeland’ become a reality were no longer content to keep their heads down or their hands idle. Riots had broken out before then and people had died, but that was Hughard, always so convinced of his own invincibility. Always so forgetful of the workers who filled his factories.
“Shhh” he soothed rubbing the boy’s back as he began the long trudge toward the house. He gestured for the others to follow and they did, silently, Natacha carrying a now silently crying Maria. “Shh. It’s alright now.”
?” Gypsy girl. She knew that because Baka used to call her that too. Natacha closed her eyes and savored the sound of the old pet name for a moment, letting it ground her. If she could choose, would she just be that and forget everything else. She didn’t know.
“I didn’t have to. As I said he seemed to be expecting it. Stanislov demanded a judge’s signature before he would release anything but I have some friends in the State Office who handled that nicely.”
Yep. Back already. I did say updates would come more regularly from here on out, but fair warning the chapters will be far FAR shorter. I hope you enjoy the update. That said fair warning, this one hurts. See you on the other side.
is no longer illegal.” Magda countered the man in a fierce tone. “Don’t be a fool!” he snapped in reply, and Steve’s heart jolted at a sudden clanging sound, his heart pounding in his chest.
But would it be enough? Tony wondered. If someone came looking it wouldn't be much. Perhaps a latch? Tony kept thinking on it as he had the younger children get started sweeping out the floor. Phillips had clearly retained some of his tidiness from the military, but it was obvious from the dark stains on the floor and the fine layer of dust that covered everything that the loft space was the most neglected area of the lodge. Artur and James made a game of dragging the little girls about on an old wool blanket and called it dusting, while Tony, Natacha, and Péter got water heated and scoured the kitchen for a bar of soap.
Too happy, Tony thought the taste of the man still lingering in his mouth. He could see it in Stefen's eyes that he was remembering along the same lines when that heat sparked anew.
“I must have ate something - ” He could feel Harold’s skepticism. Steve barely ate these days. Maybe that was the problem? He should eat more, anything. If he could just get to the kitchen. Get a proper meal in -
They'd stripped him as soon as he’d made it into the courtyard. Schmidt had been there, watching on, still as a statue, the cat poised for the kill.
“You’re late Herr Coulson.” Steve remarked and though his expression didn’t change Steve thought there was a thread of amusement in Coulson’s tone as he replied.
Stefen nodded slowly and Tony stepped back, guiding the children to the corner of the stage leaving him standing alone in the center. The captain stood for a long moment, staring down at the mandolin in his hands, thumb nervously stroking a chord but not hard enough to produce any sound. Tony’s heart beat painfully fast within his chest, wondering if he’d frozen and he and Bucky shared an anxious look. Just when Bucky shifted, clearly about to make some sort of move, Steve finally spoke.
The children were still rather subdued from their ill adventure on the water the day before, but as the hour dragged on past noon inevitably, they became twitchy.  James had begun to whine about being hungry and only quieted when Natacha whispered a smug, ‘I told you so’ out of the corner of her mouth at him. After that, he backtracked, insisting that he was only asking about when they could eat because Ian’s stomach was growling so loudly, and went stubbornly silent, glaring pointed daggers at his sister as if every second of silence just proved how wrong she was.
When the four of them finally did arrive back to the villa, it was to find that they had a surprise visitor. A plain black automobile was pulled up to the garage, a uniformed driver waiting in the front seat. The sight of an unfamiliar car in the drive made them all go quiet as Harold pulled their car in beside it and the driver nodded to them. They shared worried glances between them but tried to keep up a façade of normality as they unloaded their bags and made their way inside.
“Keep to the room? On Chanukah!” He sounded absolutely scandalized now. “You need not be such a martyr, Cousin, there is no reason why you can’t celebrate with family when a celebration is to be had. It is our birthday isn’t it? Do you remember how we used to celebrate?”
“Your children are so clever Captain.” Charlotte turned to Stefen with a look that Tony could only classify as adoring. It seemed practiced. “You must bring them to the officer’s ball. Claudia would adore them.”
“Seems a lot of effort. It’ll be louder than the gates o’ hell in here when you’re working, but stuff some cotton in your ears and you should be fine.”
“What’s wrong with it? Many ethnic Germans have red hair.” Emile pointed out, and Ian heard Rita reply, just before they were out of earshot. “It’s
“You bring Peg back here and I'll hurt you.” Bucky growled. “Don't put her face on your guilt. It’s bad enough you’re using me.”
“Sara helped save Rachel and her baby girl, whom they named Rochel which meant ‘battle cry’. Learning that Sara was in exile Rachel pleaded with her father to offer her a place in the clan. The Rom Baro was very grateful as well, but Sara refused to leave the rest of her family behind and he did not want a gadje and his offspring in the camp because they were unclean.
There was nothing for it. They'd have to order a delivery for what they couldn’t carry. Mindful of his small salary, Tony was a little loath to admit it but…
He frowned, eyes drawn to something moving down below by the lake. After a moment of squinting he realized that it was Stark and that the soft sounds of banging drifting up toward them were from the hammer the man was currently taking to the underside of a small fishing boat.
No. No he wasn’t. Steve knew it in his gut. He’d known it all day he realized. Péter was with the Klein boys, who no one had seen all day besides Natacha. Because they’d fallen ill. Because Natacha knew he was busy (too busy to check in right away) and Virginia couldn’t afford to risk the maids when they were so short staffed. They’d gone. The way Steve had suspected they would eventually. The way he would have himself were he in their shoes. They were gone and Péter was with them.
"No. What about the others?  Shouldn't I be here for them, like you said?" He asked in a quiet voice.
"It just goes to show boys, what impurities in the blood will breed. A man's name is nothing. His value is in what he contributes to his nation. Now, I want this place spotless before you go. Heil the Führer!"
“Course she’s pretty, she’s a baroness. They’re always pretty, even when they’re ugly.” To Steve’s continued embarrassment Becker chimed in groggily from his sleeping bag on the floor.
Bethany had said, and her father was a subscriber. The Tucks had a copy of the issue in the window, but in a place that was almost so out of the way one nearly had to know it was there to ask for it. Tony’s gaze flew back to the little book of names, his mind working quickly through the problem.
“Are you going to Berlin as well?" she asked conversationally after they’d both sipped their drinks for a moment.
Steve noticed that the rest of the table had fallen quiet and he could hear Bucky snickering behind his hand. If Peggy hadn't ingrained better table manners in him he might have been tempted to flick his food at him.
“I’ll write Obi,” Tony decided. “I own controlling stock in the company. He can’t refuse to help me.” Whatever it was that had caused Hughard to mistrust his old friend Tony would likely never know and regardless he was right about Obi being in no position to say no. They were on the brink of war and Stark Industries was a German company. Obadiah had always been the most concerned with the company reputation.
“How can I? I don’t support every decision the man makes, or else I wouldn’t be here. But we should do right by our people is what I’m saying. Even Hitler isn’t wrong about everything.”
The words spilled out of Tony’s mouth, naked little things that made him feel equal parts small and foolish. He made the most of it, tilting his head to meet Stefen's gaze and effecting as easy a grin as he could manage, as if the memory hardly bothered him and any discomfort he'd felt as a result of Stefen's chilly reception already forgotten.
“They’re never going to get to sleep now.” Stefen remarked as he watched the three younger boys throw pebbles into the fountain, the ice from their cones slowly beginning to melt and dribble between their fingers.
It was a pity, Tony thought as he wrapped one arm around Maria and the other around Artur, blinking back the moisture in his eyes. A pity it wouldn’t last.
With that she left them, heading toward the bar, and with hands shaking from excitement Artur dug in his pocket for the paper tag the baroness had slipped in his pocket that morning, sliding the loop around his wrist. He looked over to make sure that Maria had hers, and then he undid the buttons on his coat and shrugged out of it, leaving it abandoned on his chair. He took Maria's hand and made to follow Péter into the crowd of children with matching stars and little white tags on their wrists; but Maria jerked on his hand and Artur looked back to see that James still lingered by the table. He looked frozen, his hands clutching at his trousers, biting his bottom lip until it had gone as white as his face.
Both men looked startled to hear the other speak, gazes snapping together once more and coming to some mutual decision within seconds.
A half hour or so into the ride Péter asked the boy sitting across from him where they were being taken and the boy, who said his name was Daniel, told them that the train was taking them to a boat on the coast.
She was up and flying out of bed a moment later, nearly tripping on her blankets as she went, bare feet slapping on the cold floor. She ignored the discomfort – something was wrong. Why were they shouting?
"Turns out Stefen rarely does what people expect him to." Tony offered in answer to the unspoken question of what on earth he thought he was doing. He heaved a small exasperated sigh. It was tinged with amusement, because Bruce must think him mad staying in Austria, flouncing into prison camps disguised as a catholic official and exploding buildings just for the fun of it.
“Yes and he has very delicate senses,” Virginia sipped her drink demurely as she patted Tony's leg and Bucky snorted into his drink, choking on a wet laugh.
He knew that Bucky was sorry to have pushed him so far but Steve didn't expect him to say it. But it was the nature of having bled for one another so many times before, that Steve didn't really need him to either.
Tony closed his eyes, biting his lip to stave off the sudden urge to sob. Quiet. They needed to be quiet. No one must hear them.
“I understand.” Steve reassured him, before reporting what he’d said back to the impatiently waiting captain. It was clear to Steve that Altera was skeptical of the woman’s existance. He barked a few more questions about the woman, the direction she’d taken Pisani in, and her description, which Steve translated.
“It does not matter, do you hear me?” Nonna clucked fearfully. “It does not matter if he is kind now, he will not be kind later. It is how they are. They are born knowing how to kill. It’s better if you stay with your own kind.”
The door was locked. As it should be. But it didn’t help to think it. Not with the stillness pressing down on him. The blank darkness in every window that even shutters could not hide. The lack of trace or trail leading to or from the door but his own was too much.
“What happened?” he damned to know, looking at Péter in order to get straight to the matter. He wasn’t worried about frightening him. Péter had just turned sixteen and was not a child anymore.
James called out Ian’s name again, frowning and chewing on something (Tony could almost hear the smacking from where he was) regarding his brother thoughtfully. Ian clenched his lips tightly but did not answer his brother’s calls either.
When she had still not appeared a few minutes later he resolved himself to going and having a look. But just as he opened the doors two women exited, deep in an intensely whispered conversation. Tony stepped back to allow them to pass. They were
“You’ve shown no one else?” he asked, pulling his eyes away from the journal, and Tony rolled his own again at the question.
He’d trade every bit of strength he’d gained over the years to switch places with Artur now, just so his child wouldn’t be in pain.
Still, conflicted as she felt there was some little voice in the back of her head that sighed. It had been nice to pretend, even for a moment.
“It’s the medicine, right?” Péter demanded to know – shattering the vision of Bruce’s cluttered office in Tony’s mind, of Banner’s brow furrowed in a thoughtful frown as he read Dr. Pym’ notes about the possibility of using a chelating agent to neutralize the effectiveness of toxic metals.
“But Rachel insisted, and the Phuri Dae warned that terrible luck would follow if he repaid Sara’s kindness by allowing her child to die. And so, the Rom Baro welcomed Sara to his clan, and that is the story of how your Baka lost her family and found it again. I know it is true because I was there, I am the baby that Sara had with the potter. I saw them and ate with them.”
“He’s alive.” she whispered, reassuring them both. Steve nodded jerkily and Magda pressed her lips together, her shoulders tightening as they lifted toward her ears. It was only a split second of silence, but within it her whole continence changed, as if she was solidifying in front of his eyes.
Tony was giving Steve this meaningful look as Péter took a hesitant step forward, cheeks flushing a curious pink, and Steve understood. He remembered being fourteen and awkward with his emotions. And some snickering little voice in his head (that sounded an awful lot like Bucky) reminded him that he’d never really grown past it.
“Father likes you in that horrible suit you’re wearing so he’s hardly the perfect judge.” The girl had sneered, and Tony would have been more affronted if one, she hadn’t just used his actual name instead of insisting on Herr Stark, and secondly, he personally agreed with her that the suit was hideous.
Natacha thrashed and threw herself backward, struggling in vain to jerk herself free of his hold but Bucky held tight. He weathered her kicks and her curses until her body finally tired, and she slumped against his chest with a sob of exhausted breath.
“Don’t worry Bakhuizen. I promised the captain I won’t let them get hurt.” To the children he offered a smile, shining with confidence. “And there’s no fear of that because we’re just going to sing good night. You won’t trip James, and if you do just smile and keep going. Peter you’ll remember your part because it’s basically just saying goodbye over and over - and you can say it in at least three languages now so just pick one. You’re all going to be just brilliant. Okay? He’s going to be very proud of you. Just as I am.”
It shouldn’t be too hot. Steve had tested the water twice. Just to be sure he dipped his fingers again.
“Ah, Jeg vil gjerne presentere Kaptein Rogers, for dere, deres hoyhet.” one of the ancient attendants standing behind the prince’s chair shook to life in order to announce them. “Captain Rogers. His royal highness Prince-”
after all, he taught them about breath and notes, how to keep time, and how a group of voices performing a round could create harmony, not to mention great fun.
Later he supposed he would find it funny. At the moment, creeping through the darkened house, heart thumping heavily in his chest as the children’s screams blasted in his ears, he could find none of what occurred the least bit humorous.
“I’m sure I was more,” Tony admitted. He shoved his hand into his pockets and tried to smile, it felt more like broken glass stretched over his face but in this house he doubted anyone would know the difference.
Steve took a shaky breath, calming himself as he focused on breathing in and out and his promise to himself. This would be over soon, and then he would go home. But in the meanwhile, he couldn’t sit in a toilet all day with his cock out. That and the smell was getting to him. Despite the rooms chill there was an underlying sickly warm stench of urine and refuse that couldn’t be masked.  It was the product of too many bodies all going in one place and not so much as a soap bar to go about cleaning up after themselves. The apartment could barely manage a small family let alone fifteen or so men all using one pipe system.
“Frank loves Captain Adventure.” Susann murmured lowly, gently prying the thin little book from his hands. “I didn’t see the harm.”
“Where are the others?” Tony asked, his throat tight as he looked over at James who was still clinging to to his father’s side like a burr. The little boy shrugged dismissively mumbling something about Ian having been behind them, and Tony frowned concerned.
"Kid's a sharp shot. " Bucky confessed under his breath as if they weren’t in the middle of a life or death chase.
"If you put it on your crops and it kills off the rats and the bugs, what's stopping it killing you? Think about it!" Tony urged, leaving the driver to his contemplations and turning to Péter. Thinking the more he was prepped the less time they'd waste when they got to the abbey. "It's a metalloid, which means in theory a compound that can bind with the ions will allow your father to piss it out. That's what we have to do, create an agent to bind to the ions in the arsenic."
"We were tearing the country apart. A civil war was the last thing we needed after the great war Buck. I was trying to - " Steve tried but Bucky waved his words away impatiently.
"Shit, I'm sorry Wanda. You're right." Pietro immediately changed his tune to something more amiable Péter noticed, as the other boy wrapped his arms around his sister's thin shoulders.
“Then we face them together.” Steve promised. Swore it on his soul. “Tony I need you to come downstairs. I need – I need you where I can see you.”
“In Vienna, I had a private audience with the prince,” he began to explain, and Steve needed no interpretation for the wistful gleam that passed through Tony’s gaze. Vienna felt like a dream to Steve now too. “We knew even then that war was coming. Certain factions of British Intelligence hoped to persuade the king to take more active opposition against Hitler, but he was wary of the size of the German army and reluctant to anger him. They wanted me to persuade Thor, who we hoped could persuade his father. Ultimately, he could not, but Thor was sympathetic. He provided weapons and funding, as well as refuge for many of our operatives within Norway’s borders.”
Still, she’s completely wiped because Steve is a merciless perfectionist, and she spent the last fifteen minutes drilling in form corrections and adjustments to her fighting styles. She lies on the mat, flat on her back and limbs sprawled out, catching her breath. “Bet you totally regret that boring-ass human crack now,” she says, once she’s got enough lung capacity to manage speech. “Even if you totally allowed me to get in that first takedown.”
“The time for jealousy was about thirteen years ago. That's never been who we are, and you know it.”
The driver pulls off onto a side street and cruises slowly past houses and into less populated area, industrial warehouses and storage facilities. She’s expecting it, but it still takes her by surprise when one minute, the driver is making a left-hand turn onto a one-way street, and the next three men fling the doors open and drag her kicking and screaming from the back seat.
Bucky’s brain misfires. He slams her against the wall and fucks into her, fast and hard and brutal. His hands are locked on her hips, hard enough that he knows they’ll bruise, knows he’s too rough, knows he’s hurting her, knows he’ll feel guilty later, when lust is sated and reality sets back in. But he can’t find a shred of care right now, because she’s crying out, babbling nonsense in Italian and English, calling his name in an utterly
“Good,” Toni replies. “Cos I’m sure as shit not either.” She bends her knees, shifts her feet again, and brings her hands up in loosely-curled fists. “Just please keep in mind that I’m a plain old vanilla, boring-ass human being, not a supersoldier, huh?”
An hour after Natasha leaves, he desperately wants her back, because as bad as her silent judgment was, Clint’s refusal to shut up is ten times worse. Steve supposes he should have known it was going to be one of the more aggravating periods of his day when Clint begins his appointment by sprawling in what Steve can only assume is supposed to be a seductive pose. He just can’t decide if it looks more like someone with no idea of what yoga is attempting downward dog, or a girl with no idea of what to do with her hands posing for her first modeling shoot.
“Probably,” Quill says with a smirk, and Tony smirks himself a second later when suspicion crosses Quill’s face. “You know what, I think you just insulted me.”
, express gratitude. Toni’s eyes well up, and she sniffles as tears stream down her face. God, she’s so tired, and she desperately needs to sleep, but she lays one hand gently on top of the boxy server wired to her laptop, cradling the corner as gently as the skull of a newborn, and cries happily.
Bucky finds himself in Toni’s workshop, dark and dimmed, and blinks at the suddenness of it all. He straightens from his instinctive crouch, and stares around at the consoles and machines and strewn-about tools for long moments before he realizes what that niggling feeling of something being off is.
“Kittens,” Clint says through gritted teeth, and his hands are white-knuckled on the yoke of the quinjet. “I am going to have motherfucking
If she wasn’t so scary fucking powerful and more than a little unhinged, Tony would be utterly charmed by how adorable she is with her face scrunched up like that. “I’m not going to fight you, kid.”
It’s enough to put anyone down, but Toni is pure reflex now because anyone who can hurt her through the multiple layers of goddamn titanium of a grade even NASA would think is
Steve steps back with a funny, endearing smile Toni can’t decipher, and his hand drops away from her neck. He reaches over his shoulder to pull the cowl on, adjusting it with deft tugs. “I thought I’d ask you to take me flying.”
. Between the new designs she sends down the pipeline into prototyping, and the long hours spent with Pepper planning the expansion into three new states, Toni doesn’t have time to take off to have a kid. She doesn’t have time to spend with a kid. She doesn’t even know if she wants to have one
“They cleanse my memory.” Declaration. No intonation. A simple statement of fact. But then his forehead furrows and his eyebrows draw together. His eyes cant downwards, and he seems to be staring at his hands. “It doesn’t always work.”
has escaped him until now. He’s floating in space in what is quite possibly the largest Iron Man armor he’s ever created, a goddamn Gundam if he were inclined to play to the millennial crowd. There are literal gods and forces of nature and superpowers at his back on the surface of the Moon, and the Phoenix makes them all look like a child’s plastic green army men.
In the next moment, she feels the bowl slide out of her lap as someone yanks it away, and turns to glare at Bucky, who is unapologetically setting it in his own lap. “You snooze, you lose, Romanoff,” he says, digging out a handful. “So these ‘randomized spontaneous events’...”
"I remember the Red Skull," he says weakly, massaging his temples with both hands. "I remember fighting Nazis in Germany. I remember Kreischberg..."
“We’re going to have to talk about it at some point,” Toni says softly. “I know that. We’re supposed to be a triad, clearly--” Her hand sweeps between his mark and hers. “--but we don’t…” She sighs again, runs her hands through her hair rhythmically, shakes her head slowly back and forth. They’re all signs Bucky’s come to learn mean she’s shoving shit in a bottle, locking it away because she needs to focus on something else. Some
“Good,” Natasha says, pleased. “I’ll go run the bath, and then I’ll come back and help you out of bed. Try not to injure yourself in the five minutes I’ll be gone.”
Jemma’s side of the bed is empty, still neatly made. She must still be in the lab, overseeing her nanite experiments. Fitz groans as he throws himself face-down into the center of the mattress and lies there, spread-eagled for a little while.
Toni snorts. “Figures. The boys-only bullshit isn’t dying fast enough, in my opinion. What happened, were they afraid a woman with one leg was still too much of a threat to their masculinity?”
“I hope you’ll stay with me,” Steve adds, and squeezes Tony’s hand gently for good measure before letting it go. “At least until you’ve gotten some of your stability back. Spend some time with me. I’ve missed having you around, Shellhead.”
“That's handy,” Clint remarks, tossing an appreciative glance over his shoulder as he goes to the fridge to fish out a couple of bottles of water. He tosses one to Tony, putting it unerringly into his hands. “Always wondered if that quick costume change gimmick was a feature of the phenomenal cosmic power schtick. Learn something new every day.”
After a moment, JARVIS responds, “No. It is far more likely that sir inadvertently damaged the arrays by embedding hostiles in the drywall.”
“In the shower!” she calls back, and turns to let the water batter at the scars surrounding the arc reactor, the chest muscles that never truly lose their dull ache. Cold air swirls abruptly as the bathroom door opens. A silhouette stops in front of the frosted glass door, appears to hover there. She watches as he reaches for the sliding door and hesitates. “You can join me if you want,” she says, and ducks her head beneath the spray.
He sighs and props his chin on his hand, going down the list of who’d be best suited for what and trying to figure out how to fill the holes left by the fact that there are only six Avengers -- seven, if he counts the Hulk, like Toni suggested -- but he thinks he might have some pull with a couple of SHIELD agents he can ask to join the project.
Anyone else who hasn't kept her tied up for four fucking days straight with contract negotiations that should have been handled by SI’s legal department. She doesn’t care
“Love you too,” Toni mumbles, and lets Natasha lead her into the room. Natasha looks over her shoulder at Bucky in the most open expression he’s seen to date, one that manages to convey gratitude and pride and approval and affection, apparently all for him, in a single upturned smile. It floors him just a little.
ended up with it at the end of everything, but here we are. And you know what else? This Hydra Cap thing?
He doesn’t pray, he doesn’t have the mental coherence right now to frame anything that formal. He doesn’t think God will particularly mind. He’s fairly sure the Almighty will suss out his relief and gratitude no matter how ineloquently he’s expressing it. He can feel the tension draining out of his shoulders, feel that horrible, terrible burden lessening from his body. Finally feels something akin to a connection in this waking nightmare he’s found himself in.
For the fourth time, she attempts to get through the first paragraph, but her brain keeps losing track of the words, can't keep them from sliding away from her comprehension.
Thor looks troubled, and Tony sighs, because if there’s one person he thought he’d have to work the least on convincing, it was her. “It is difficult to believe,” she says doubtfully, cupping her chin pensively in one hand. “I have seen many an oddity not easily explained, friend Stark, but this stretches credulity, possibly to the breaking point.”
Tony finds himself smiling in response, a slow, curving tilt to his mouth that is his patented Stark smirk, a thousand percent him through and through. “Okay,” he says easily, and pulls Steve to his feet as effortlessly as if he were lifting air. “I’m betting you’re wrong, but on the off-chance you’re right and there’s nothing left of the man I know? We’ll just have to burn together.”
“Good kid, J. Mom’s proud.” She flicks her right hand to the right, separating the two different programs she’s been working on, scanning over both of them with a hand rubbing her chin. “Check my code for errors, would you?”
Natasha nods. “Coulson’s got new intel on a few things. He’s going to want to meet about it at some point. And even though we’re down an Avenger, the rest of us are still here. I’ll draw up a training schedule, get everyone used to working with everyone else.”
. To be told that she was sick of waiting for him to get his shit together. To be told to get the fuck out of her house. Lies or denial or anything else. He certainly wasn’t expecting any of
“You’re all sloppy,” Natasha says, tucking her feet up onto the cushion beside her. “Carol and Rhodey might have won, but it was by a very slim margin. And Clint’s right, it was an unfair setup. You two,” she says with a nod, to indicate Carol and Rhodey, “are used to working together. You and Bucky,” she shifts her glance to Clint, “aren’t, though you learned pretty quickly. I’m going to keep changing things around, get different combinations used to working together.”
And there’s only a single, purple arrowhead intermingled with Toni’s blue circle, and a smooth expanse of skin where his and Steve’s soulmarks should be.
She sips her coffee again, enjoying the heat spread through her body, props her chin on her hand, watches the others act like Christmas came early.
James. And one of those rules is that only I get to be kidnapped to avoid going out to dinner. It’s my thing, you can’t have it, so don’t fucking do it again.
She nods, throat itching with smoke and ash. “At least they’re incompetent,” she mumbles, and lolls her head onto his shoulder, wincing as she jars the gash leaking blood into her eye. “They’re always incompetent.”
Toni stands at the window, leaning against the wall with her arms folded, and stares out over the city. It’s cold and drizzly, and very far below, a sea of open umbrellas swims along the sidewalk. By all appearances, an utterly shitty day. But Toni doesn’t care, because this is the day that she gets to go home at a reasonable time, eat food that isn’t takeout strewn around a mountain of paperwork, actually remember she has a boyfriend that isn’t named “Pepper”.
Steve manages to make his stance look like a fluid motion in a single step of his foot. “I know you’re not superhuman, Toni,” he says with an amused frown. “But boring and old are two words I doubt I would ever use to describe you.” He pauses, eyes looking distant and dreamy for a moment. “You do smell like vanilla, though,” he adds then. “I think it’s your soap.”
Shadows and darkness and something scarily close to apathetic resignation blows through her eyes. “Not anymore.”
There’s a window, tiny and grimy, but enough to show her part of the hallway. No one’s outside. “Oh my
“I doubt it. If you wouldn’t mind, please see yourself out. I’ve a lot of work to get through today.”
She’s grateful the faceplate is down, because she’s positive the heat in her cheeks mean her face is on fire.“Do you know how often Clint falls off a building? Or how many times Tash tries to stick to the walls even though she’s not really a spider? Everyone has static locks on their uniforms, just in case I need to grab them quick.”
He’s thundering after her, and she knows that he’s faster, even without the shield. He doesn’t know the building like she does, though. There’s an access door that leads to the crawlspace between floors down the next corridor. She just needs to get to it.
The memory of Rhodey’s funeral flashes through his mind again. Sobbing over his body. Fighting in his armor at the end of it all, because no one would ever fight in it again. And
“Short version is that Toni’s never offered and I never asked,” Clint says. “It’d screw with my ability to see shit coming and going. There’s a reason I don’t wear a mask beyond vanity.” He shrugs and fishes a beer out of the cooler between him and Carol, tosses it to Bucky and snags another for himself. “Toni’s probably got an Iron Hawk or something tucked away in a folder for a rainy day, though. She does shit like that.”
He should go check on Toni, but it’s only a half-hearted attempt to convince himself to leave Steve alone. He knows Toni’s got company, lots of it. Company that isn’t going to leave her alone. Clint’s eyes had been hard and sharp and accusing the last time he looked in on her and found Clint wrapped around her, keeping her warm and comfortable.
“I'm afraid that won't do any good, sir. Ma’am did not order me to call you ‘sir’. She prefers to let others request their own forms of familiarity from me, which I am free to grant or deny.”
“Don’t you fucking dare, JARVIS!” She struggles upward, tries to wiggle off Bucky’s shoulder. Forgot that she’s dealing with a super-soldier, and outside the suit, he’s
Fitz has seen the Avengers in action. He’s fairly certain it can and will hurt quite a lot. “We’re not Avengers, Jem. It doesn’t seem a bit excessive to you?”
because that way, it might be any building and not her home, her sanctum, her safe place that no longer feels quite as safe.
He can feel Toni practically vibrating with the need to know and frustration that she can’t guess it beside him. The more he smiles, the more she scowls. “Fine,” she grumbles, like he knew she would. “I’ll play your game, Barnes. But I want an explanation when you let me catch up to you.”
She blinks and straightens, because that is a recurring dream of hers, and it has been since she first got her pilot’s license all those years ago. “You want to go flying,” she says, just to be sure she heard him right. “Instead of taking me inside and having your way with me.”
“... so that’s the deal. A superhero team. Officially put together and everything. Gear, training, a paycheck. Probably action figures and keychains and backpacks with your face on ‘em.” Toni shoves her hands into the rear pockets of her jeans and looks around the room. It’s pretty easy to tell where everyone’s thoughts are by the looks on their faces. Is suddenly sure, just like she knew she would do this, that they’re all in too. Still, she has to give them the choice. “Floor’s open for discussion, debate, dissent, whatever. You can say yes or no. No harm, no foul either way.”
Rhodey is a champion fretter. She learned that one the hard way while still in college. Anything someone did to themselves, hangovers or sleep debt (or that one time she managed to cut her arm nearly to the bone when she had the brilliant idea to supercharge the can opener, which she and Rhodey have mutually agreed to never so much as think about ever again because Rhodey says he'll hear the dying shrieks of the fridge in his nightmares forever), none of that ever wins sympathy points with James Rhodes. Accidents, illnesses, and no-fault injuries, on the other hand, bring out the super-protective mother hen from deep within his psyche. It’s only because he cares, and it’s only because he wants to help, but if she learned anything post-Afghanistan, she learned that Rhodes in hovering-protector mode is fucking annoying nearly as often as it is appreciated.
“I really need a raise then.” Rhodey drops an arm over her shoulders, and she curls automatically into his side. “Hazard pay, maybe. You’re a pain in the ass.”
Bucky just looks at her dubiously as she finishes listing off all her excuses, and she kind of hates that he's only known her for a few months, and yet knows her so well. His mouth tightens into a thin line of unhappiness, but blessedly, he chooses not to press the issue. “Alright, Toni,” is all he says. “If you gotta do this, then you gotta do it.”
,” Mama says, stroking her hair as she curls into a ball and cries in her lap, skin raw and sore from the frozen burn of the marks searing through. Mama has strong, gentle hands today, soothing the marks with a lotion that smells like aloe and tingles with analgesic relief. “Our family has enemies that will think to use them against you. I will teach you how to hide them,
“None of your business,” she snaps, then instantly regrets it. “You know I do,” she says in a more reasonable tone. “Why do you think I developed the nano mask?” She stops, blinks, tries to cover herself. “Uh, I mean, why do you think Selwyn from Berkeley developed the nano mask?”
Helen releases her after performing a few basic tests to check her pain and functional range, but privately Toni thinks Helen’s just looking for an excuse to get Pepper alone. She grins knowingly at Helen as she leaves, winks salaciously at Pepper, and blithely ignores Pepper’s return glare.
She wonders idly if parents of flesh-and-blood children go through this uncertainty and fear as their spawn come into awareness and understanding. She wonders if parents look into the faces of their sleeping kids and wonder:
“I’m not a host sharing my body with the Phoenix.” Tony hesitates, and his expression goes troubled and maybe a little trepidatious before he sighs and adds, “I think my body
“She is,” JARVIS replies. “Ma’am has been airborne for approximately forty-five minutes, and does not seem inclined to return soon. Still, I advise haste, Captain. Ma’am will no doubt find something to tweak or tinker with before long.”
how slack and lifeless their faces are, like lights are on but no one’s home. Or, he thinks grimly, as the warmth of his flames washes upwards, chasing the chill away, like the owners are home, but are tied up in the attic, screaming into their gags.
“No. But--” Her eyes go to the padded envelope on the corner of her desk, and shivers. She hasn’t opened it, wanted to wait until she brought it home so they could open it together. The courier company she used is her usual, the highest rated security firm in the city. But life has taught her that
“Good morning, ma’am,” JARVIS says. “The time is 6:23am. It is 64 degrees Fahrenheit, and the weather forecast is cloudy with chances of rain. Your calendar lists this date as your 18

As the days pass into weeks, he learns the rules of the Stark home and the quirks of these weird people he finds himself living with.
DiNozzo's Bakery, to my best knowledge, does not exist. NCIS was on in the background while I wrote that scene.
Phil isn’t sure how he’d describe the expression on Fury’s face, though he’d put it somewhere between aggravation and incredulity. “You're suggesting that if we'd, what, scheduled an appointment and asked
She’s rewarded by Pepper’s most withering look, the one that scares her straight down to her toes. “Don’t,” she says, and the soft tone is gone now. It’s all hard and unmoving, the Big Boss Pepper voice Toni usually prefers to see used on obstinate board members because it always makes that person quail and quake. “Because I’d take the promotion, Toni, and I’d fire you from every position you hold.”
“Another five minutes or so, and the initial work is done. I’ve programmed a 60% die-off for the twelve-hour mark, and an additional five percent per additional twenty-four hours until the colonies are extinct.”
And he knows the man's making them. He can see Coulson’s mouth moving, hear the rise and fall of his voice, knows that Coulson's speaking at least one language he understands, but Bucky’ll be fucked if he can comprehend a single goddamn syllable.
time, trying to win Tony over to his side, a side Tony has to ruthlessly repress shuddering in horror to think about ever joining.
He searched her face, his mouth tightening into a hard, grim line. “She must be trained,” he said. “Start her tomorrow. We must know if—”
what makes you a fuckin’ fine woman.” The fire banks off, dies down, becomes an unbearable itch that makes him want to howl and claw at his arm, electricity crawling under his skin and snapping off sparks. He grits his teeth, pushes through it. “Most girls, fellas too, I suppose, would want to hear a story about the war. They want to know about Captain America. You… you’re asking about
So maybe he was always meant to be here, standing on the front lines of a world about to enter a new age, one about to plunge headlong into evolution and growth and chaos and revolution. He’s not a futurist, like Stark. He’s not a master tactician, like Rogers. He’s not a pessimist, like Romanoff, and he doesn’t see the tiniest details like Barton. But what he is, is a
An alarm blares, and he hits the floor on his hands and knees, heaving and coughing and choking. Flails back, feeling water fill his throat, his lungs. His bare ass hits the cold floor, and he yells something wordless and aggressive.
He cuts her off with another kiss, this one a little harder, a little more possessive. It’s the only way he knows to express everything this is making him feel, because he's too overwhelmed to find the right words. “You talk too much,” he says. “File the paperwork.”
Toni glances overhead to check the readouts of the holoscreen monitoring the tiny machine inside his arm, stitching man to machine with what he’s privately sure are tines carved from Lucifer’s pitchfork. “Halfway done,” she says, looks down at him with eyes gone too wide and washed-out. “You should have let me put you under. It’s not too late. I can get Tash--”
"Wait, Steve, if this is about what I said earlier, I'm sorry! I didn't mean it, I love having you in the tower, I love you..." His voice dropped to a whisper with in the last words, and the blond felt tears trying to escape. "I'm sorry too, I'm sorry for wasting your time with this stupid little dream we had, thinking that we could be something more." Tony thought he was going to cry. "Steve..."
"Damn, look at those two go." Clint said, turning away from the bar to watch the spectacle on the dance floor. "You would never guess that they hated each other by the way they look right now." Natasha turned and held her breath for a moment. She watched as the two lovers danced passionately, capturing everyone's attention.
Tony flipped off his radio, and turned down the fire. Pepper lay on the couch, and a Christmas song had lullaby-ed her to sleep. She had a business trip in the morning, and Tony and she had spent the whole night in each other's arms. It was perfect. He looked over and watched his angel breathing, her hair hanging in her face.
Steve began to back away, staring at the floor. He ran for the door, pushing past all the bodies. He needed to run; he needed to get away from it all. Tony turned around just in time to see Ashley on the verge of tears, and Steve's coat-tail disappearing out the door. "Oh no." Tony quickly got up, and began to run after the super soldier. "Steve? Steve!" He pushed past the bodies on the sidewalk, receiving yells and curses.
The brunette groaned, and headed back into his room to get dressed. Steve just stood there, trying to get the embarrassing blush off his face. He sighed, and figured it'd be best to go to his room and at least put on a shirt before they headed to the meeting. He looked back once more over his shoulder, but saw only a closed bedroom door. He bit his lip slightly, and headed back into his room.
Steve simply smiled, acting as if he cared. “Thank you, but you know; I’ve never been much of a dancer.” he said, flashing one of his heart melting smiles. “Oh don’t be so modest! You were amazing!” The woman giggled, twirling her hair. “I’m sorry; I never caught your name.”
Steve sighed heavily as he walked into his apartment, only to find Tony sitting there, wringing his hands as he obviously waited for the soldier to come back home. He closed the door softly behind him, and the brunette jumped up, and went over to kiss him hello. The blond stepped away, and Tony could sense something was wrong. "We need to talk." He said, voice harsh. "What's wrong Steve?"
He pushed the brunette down onto the bed, and began to pull off his own pants while the other did the same. Tony maneuvered himself onto his knees, wrapping his arms around Steve's neck and pulling him down on top of him, their cocks brushing against one another through Steve's boxers.
Tony's eyes flew open, and he sat up to see Steve sneaking out the door. He was in complete shock... Steve had just told Tony, that he loved him. "Where you think you're going soldier?" The brunette asked, a playful tone to his voice. "Get back here and give me twenty." Steve smirked, and climbed on the bed, crawling to where Tony was laying, and kissing him again. "Sure thing, Mr. Stark."
"Stark, hurry up would you?" Steve called out to him, and Tony snapped out of his little fantasy. "Don't tell me what to do Cap!" He yelled back, and his arrogant attitude replaced his recent, dreamy one.
Tony crumpled up the paper and tossed it in the garbage. He'd have to call Pepper later, let her know he misses her. But for now, he had something else on his mind. The brunette poured himself a cup of coffee and headed out to his balcony. He tried to think of what exactly had gone down last night.
Steve rolled his eyes and laughed lightly, before removing his arms from around the other man's waist. Tony shifted away, but didn't get up. He looked back at the blond, whose eyes watched the brunet's every move with such, amazement.
"Sure." Steve says with no hesitation, and the brunette can't help but be caught off guard. He won't let that show, though.
"What are you doing?" A voice mumbled, warm breath passing by Tony's ear and causing him to shiver. The brunet looked over his shoulder, awkwardly, to see a sleepy eyed Steve staring at him, lips up turned in a smile.
Steve threw a few more punches at the bag, before giving it one final blow, still expecting it to fly off the machine. It stayed intact, and the blond smiled. Tony really put a lot of work into this thing. He sighed, grabbing his towel and wiping off the sweat that dripped over his face. His phone buzzed, and he smiled, hoping it was Tony calling to ask him to grab a bite or something else that would give them an excuse to see each other.
Steve checked his watch nervously, and Tony rolled his eyes. "Calm down Steve, she'll be here." The blond watched the door, and bit his lip. "I don't know Tony, what if she stood me up?" Steve had invited Ashley to the bar, and hoped that tonight would be the night; he would tell her how he felt. Or at least how he thought he felt.
So this is literally my favorite chapter. This and another one, I think the one after it. Anyways I'm being irrelevant later.
Steve smiled as he rolled off Tony, pulling him close, kissing him again as he pulled the sheets up around them, the brunette resting his head against the blond's chest, the arc reactor lighting the room with a dim light, and the soldier smiled to himself, before his eyes closed and he fell asleep.
“I thought this would really be the best thing to give you.” Tony muttered, watching the super soldier’s reaction. Steve looked up, a mix of pain and gratefulness showing on his face. “How’d you even find this?” Steve asked, running his thumb over the needle kept protected by glass. “It wasn’t easy, took some pretty deep looking, but, I have my ways.” Tony smiled, his eyes twinkling. “Thank you Tony. It’s really the best gift I could ever receive.” Steve said, closing the compass. He placed it in his pants pockets, and everyone went around hugging each other merry Christmas.
"Why aren't you out there mingling?" Steve asked, knowing it was a stupid question. Everyone knew how Bruce was, how he never really liked talking to anyone. The man shrugged. "No one to really talk to but you guys, and you all seemed to be enjoying yourselves." Steve gave him a sympathetic look, but quickly corrected it. "Don't be that way Bruce, we all really like you." he told him, patting him softly on the back. Bruce grinned, and sipped at his drink. For some reason, Bruce always had the feeling that Cap hated him, he just kept it hidden.
Steve shot his husband a look that said, You tell him, you tell our son about what you're going to do to this family. Tony tried to look at the boy, but he ended up looking at Peter’s feet instead. “Your father and I are getting a divorce.” He said. Peter dropped his bag. “You’re joking, this is some sick sort of joke.” He laughed in disbelief. “It’s not funny guys, joke’s up.”
Pepper bit her lip, and kissed her boyfriend. "Sounds like a plan." she muttered, and they headed back to Tony's car.
"Here, fuck here, give it to me." Tony groaned, taking the package from Steve's hands and sitting up. He opened the package, but not before the blond pressed himself against the other man's back, their sweat mixing and making it almost impossible to tell where the line in their bodies could be drawn. When the fuck did it get so hot in there?
The rest of the dinner went by smoothly. Steve felt as if he was part of a really big family, and he was grateful that he could spend his first Christmas awake with all his friends. Thor told his amazing stories of his adventures on Asgard. Clint and Natasha danced around the subject of Budapest, never revealing any real facts. Steve was able to speak about a few war memories, ones that didn’t involve Peggy or Bucky; everyone hanging on his words. Pepper, Natasha, and Jane all got along relatively well, not too good but not too bad either. After dinner was a desert fit for Thor. Pop tarts and coffee. There was of course apple pies and fondue for the others, causing Steve to chuckle to himself.  He avoided the topic of Howard though, not wanting to upset Tony.
The funeral, empty casket, lasted all day. There were ceremonies held across the nation for the fallen Avenger. Everyone gave Tony his privacy; they could tell he was taking it the hardest.
Christine blinked as she watched him step out of the office, leaving her alone. She sighed, and reached into the drawer, taking out the photos, and putting them over the garbage can, lighting them. She dropped them in, and watched as the only evidence she had of the story went up in flames. There'd be other stories, and who knows, maybe she'd get a better one out of this.
After his little episode, Tony went to the medicine cabinet to get some aspirin, and heard a knock at the door. He grabbed the whole bottle and stepped out of the bathroom, attempting to open the bottle with one hand. By the time he reached the door, the bottle remained closed, and some coffee had spilled onto the carpet. He put the item in his mouth and opened the door.
He heard the chair in front of him scrape against the floor, and he looked up to see Steve sitting down across from him. "Hello Captain." Tony muttered quietly. "Mr. Stark." Steve responded politely. "How are you today?" Tony rolled his eyes. "We're not really going to do this are we?" he asked, looking up at the blond and leaned on the table. "We both know we don't want to be here, so let's-" "Who said I didn't want to be here?" Steve asked, a small smile twitching at his lips. Tony lips upturned in a smile, which he quickly hid behind his hand.
Tony walked to the door, watching as Natasha got onto an elevator, tears in her eyes. He picked up the envelope, labeled in cursive, Mr. Anthony Stark. He tore it open, and balled his hands into a fist. Steve's key was inside the envelope. He was gone for good. "Good." Tony whispered, anger rising within him. He walked out the door, slamming it shut behind him.
"What song is this?" he asked, closing his eyes in the moment. "Piano Man, by Billy Joel. It's a classic." Tony said quickly, noticing all eyes falling on them. "Tony, everyone is staring at us." muttered Steve, a blush crawling up his face. The brunette heard a group giggling, and turned his head in their direction.
"Come on Stark, almost to your room." Steve said as he lifted an incapacitated Tony into the long corridor. The drunk man hung onto the blond's large shoulders, and tried his best to walk straight, but that bump to his head only made his condition worse.
The audience cheered, and Steve and Tony looked up, panting for breath. They looked at each other, and began to laugh. Steve pulled Tony up, and the two took a bow. Clint and Natasha waved them over, and they made their way towards them. “Where did you learn to dance like that Cap?” Tony panted, still a bit exasperated from the display.
loved. He ran his hand into Steve's hair, tugging lightly, imagining himself screaming the man's name and grabbing even harder. The soldier smiled against Tony's lips, and the brunette took this opportunity to let his tongue slip in, and their tongues danced against each other in a way that made them lose themselves in the moment.
Steve sighed and looked up at Tony, brown eyes full of gentleness. "Hey, would you mind if we talk later? Ashley is probably wondering where I am." Steve said, glancing over his shoulder. Tony nodded, and removed his hand from Steve's shoulder. "Yeah, same for Pepper. I'll talk to you later Cap." he muttered, and gave Steve a small wave.
Steve smiled at him. "Hey Tony, sorry about that, I wasn't watching where I was going, damn shirt's got me all confused." He chuckled low, and Tony looked at his chest to see undone buttons, a few in the wrong holes. The man rolled his eyes, and swatted Steve's hands away. "Here, let me help you out a bit." He muttered, and began to undo the blond's button down, exposing his broad chest, the one that Tony had missed laying his head against, listening to Steve's heartbeat.
"Steve? You hear me?" Tony's voice broke through Steve's thoughts. "Sorry, what?" he asked, swallowing a bite of his steak, and looking up at the brunette. "I said do you want to go out for a few later?" The man repeated, and Steve looked at him confused. "A few what?" Tony rolled his eyes and chuckled. "A few drinks dumb-ass. God, you really are blond aren't you?" he teased, causing the blond to scowl. "A few can mean anything Stark." He growled, a heat passing over his cheeks, and he knew he was blushing.
"Listen, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be so late, but something really did come up, and I really do want to have dinner with you. And from what Bruce has told me about your messy breakup, you're looking for someone to talk to. So, why not a stranger?" Stephanie's voice was pleading, but she had a good point. However, Toni wasn't going to give her that satisfaction.
"Aw come on Steve!" Tony whined, pulling on his arm. "It's a once a year carnival, and I've always wanted to go with someone special." "No Tony, I don't feel like it. Now leave me alone." Steve shot his lover a dirty look as he pulled the covers over his head. "But Steve! It'll be fun! We can ride the Ferris wheel and get cotton candy, and you can win me stuff." Tony suggested, crawling onto the blond and attempting to pull the covers down away from his face. "I just don't want to alright?" Steve snapped, and immediately regretted it. He felt Tony's weight lift off of him, and heard the bedroom door open and slam shut.
Tony took in a quick breath as he opened the door, eyes falling on the tall, blond, handsome, super soldier, Steve Rogers. He smiled at him, and stepped out of his room. "So, you ready to go?" the smaller man asked, and the blond nodded. "I've been ready, but I didn't want to come too early. I know you like to be 'fashionably late'." He teased. Tony smirked, and gave the soldier a small shove. "You know me too well." He laughed. Steve laughed with him, and they took the elevator down to the lobby, taking a cab to The Silver Celtics.
Without another word, Steve headed into the showers, wanting to be fully ready when he beat the shit out of Stark.
