Rosie was at school; Sherlock had just agreed to take on a client—a woman insistent that her husband had recently been buried alive—who had left him a thick stack of folders and clipped-together reports comprising the man’s medical history, particularly in his final weeks.
“Good luck to him,” George shrugged, sounding as if he felt John would need loads of it, if he’d taken up a banner in favour of persuading the league to treat head injuries more seriously.
Everything between them having stayed easy and pleasant for nearly twenty minutes, John knew he should get out on a high note; they could never dance very long before the tone of the music would inevitably turn sour.
It was past ten o’clock by the time John and Sherlock made their way via low-lit, raised wooden walkways across the resort’s central courtyard, over stretches of white sand  and among small clumps of shrubbery, to the far side of the property and the generic white box of a nightclub with
“I have some memory tools I use. Anyway, Bouchard was poking at the puck-handler—it was Gregory Lewan—but couldn’t get at it. Thurston made a move to help out, lost an edge, and ended up on his back. The shooting lane opened, Lewan made a sneaky pass back your way, and you slapped it low to my glove side. I had to slide and stack my pads, but it rang the post beside my skate blade and went in.”
“Holmes, they’re getting lucky on you; their passing plays look pretty sloppy. Keep your head in it, eyes open. Their offense is no match for our D; do your job and we’ll get out of this alive.”
John gestured at the telly with his chopsticks, and said around a mouthful of teriyaki, “There. That’s where we need to go. During the bye week.” He chewed, gulped. “Pass me my phone, I’ll book it.”
“And?” John prompted, with some amusement. He stood, too, to admire himself in the oval glass above the wash stand. Sherlock’s buttonhole was as good as any he’d ever made--moreso because he’d made it a Christmas gift to John.
“Bed, then?” Sherlock suggested, already drifting toward the rocky shore, the wooden walkway that would carry them from the edge of the ocean straight into the room.
John typed, and bit his lips. He was so tired it felt like drunkenness. He should not be texting his ex about Christmas. What a cliché he was already becoming.
John gathered the schoolwork they’d been offered. “I’ll take these to pin up at home? If she’s still terrorizing the other kids in a few weeks, maybe we can reconvene.” John stood, so Sherlock stood. “Enjoy the rest of your day,” John fake-grinned at the dumbstruck women, and Sherlock waved his hand in front of his chest.
Raynham played along. “I don’t know; all guys look the same to me.” He thumped Sherlock on the shoulder pad. “Just. . .you see what I’m saying? Maybe you need to work on some physical therapy or—have you had your eyes checked lately? Peripheral vision?”
“Am I sheep or a wolf? I want to be a cute, cute lamb.” They were at the edge of the school grounds, children and parents all converging in the bright hubbub of Monday morning; soon enough he would lose Rosie’s attention entirely, when she spotted a pal or made a break for the playground.
John was writing an Op-Ed for the Boston Globe, with some behind-the-curtain scheme to have it talked about by sports radio, in social media, and elsewhere, all of it designed to surround the night of his number being retired in Hamilton.
Mrs Holmes, never one to miss a chance to be both passive and aggressive simultaneously, patted Sherlock’s shoulder and clicked her tongue. “I barely recognise you with that beard. Isn’t it time to shave, now you boys have won all your games?”
“Oh, I don’t know,” John replied, playing it off. “Now I’m sort of stuck here. Hopefully the fall will kill me before I hit the ground.”
this,” John scolded, as ever implying that Sherlock was failing so spectacularly in his role as one-of-just-us-two that, well, he
“You just look a bit off.” John reached and Sherlock allowed him a feel of his forehead. “Sort of flushed. And you’re sweaty.”
“Watson, my apologies, but I only stopped in to have a look at the best display in the room—those in the know might even say, in the
Sherlock grinned at him--an odd, almost off-putting grin--and laid his book aside on the floor by the fire. “I’ll see. Have a seat.”
“So do what you need to do,” Lestrade finished, as he signed his name and wrote his room number. “and we’ll see how you look tomorrow night.”
Phew! Glad we got that one out of the way. Upfront answers to your most burning questions, in case you want to check out early and just get back to the silly stuff:
John scraped this thumbnail over a nick in his phone’s outer shell. Picking at something felt appropriate.
SH: Not remotely. But the machismo is thick, it’s true. In the end, though, we’re individuals, and we know each other quite well in some ways. The personal relationships, friendships outside of work, and so on, vary like they do in any group of colleagues.  So those who know us well for our personalities and ethics and whatever other qualities are valuable to them, were sort of instantly supportive and then let it go.
Mycroft reached beneath his jumper to liberate his mobile from his shirt pocket, then frowned at the screen as he scrolled with his thumb. The frown deepened, paired with a grim hum, and he passed the phone to Sherlock.
Rosie slithered and rolled from the chair in the bendy manner of soft-boned children and dashed to her rucksack. “First I want to show you.”
Mycroft tapped at his mobile’s screen, and before Sherlock had made even a half-step forward, said loudly, “I’ve summoned my best IT specialist to assist you, Father; he’ll arrive in thirty minutes. Why not have a cup of tea while you wait?” Sherlock allowed himself to smile his relief at Mycroft—well connected, when it suited him—and Mycroft added, “I’ve just finished mine so you’ll be on your own, I’m afraid. Sherlock has an appointment.”
“It’s kind of you to offer,” Sherlock said, sounding regretful, perhaps even actually regretful though John couldn’t be sure even after a decade of acquaintance, much of it quite intimate. “I think it’s best I decline.”
Of course, John himself was no fan of kiddy parties either, but after the first half-dozen or so, it became their default position that he escorted Rosie to all of them. Sherlock never volunteered, and on the few occasions when Rosie asked that he take her, John had let him off easy, making his excuses for him so Rosie didn’t feel rejected. And so it had always been John who stood around small-talking with people—mostly mums, at that—whose names he rarely cared to remember, critiquing the classroom teachers and cluing each other in on the least crowded rainy-day playspaces, reminding the children to keep their hands to themselves, exhorting them to eat something decent before pouring sugar over it, practically begging them to please, darling, I know you’re excited but you must stop screaming. It was John who always came home with his head aching, and who inevitably dealt with the high-pitched, tremulous sugar surge followed by the inevitable tantrumming crash.
“Are you going?” he deflected, unwilling to acknowledge having so quickly and so thoroughly succumbed to the post-adrenaline crash. John’s hand on his shoulder had not been thrown off, despite the turbulence.
Sherlock shook his head, turned Colin’s body so his back was pressed to Sherlock’s chest, moved against him to make known his intentions. Colin’s wordless agreement was to reach back with one hand on Sherlock’s hip, urging him closer, harder against his backside. Sherlock ran one hand up the front of Colin’s torso, every muscle defined and flexing, over his pectoral, catching his nipple in a quick pinch. When he closed his eyes, Sherlock still saw the blue and red flashes of disco lighting from every direction, blaring bright throbs behind his lids. He fished in Colin’s pocket, moved against his back in time to the music, drew out another tablet. Sherlock—smiling and closed-eyed, elated and aroused, pressed the bitter little round onto his tongue, gathered saliva, and swallowed.
Hotel key card; billfold; cellphone in a case with slots for cards on the back, platinum credit card and driver’s license visible. Folded bills—probably not more than thirty dollars—and some loose change. Two bars of Xanax. A squat plastic vial with a disposable rubbery cap, a residue of light-coloured powder left in it. Sherlock stepped back until he hit the opposite counter, less than a full stride, and kept his eyes on the pile of detritus lest it make any sudden moves. He went on staring at it for as long as it took him to finish his drink. Using thumb and forefinger only, he turned George’s phone face up. He found the information he needed—it was 2:43 a.m.—and also caught sight of a notification of a
John was busying himself fetching out plates and glasses and flatware, while Sherlock took a kitchen chair so as to be more at Rosie’s level. She began to draw out tiny cats and their even tinier accoutrements by the fistful, making a jumbled pile on the tabletop.
John nodded, and passed Sherlock his glass. John tucked his nose into the rim of his own; the whisky smelled so smoky and thick with caramel it was nearly erotic to experience. “So you’re a veteran, too,” John said. Not lightly.
“My mother is clearly enamoured of you already. The only person my father has ever been impressed by is himself.”
John gave him a comical, lifted-brow look that said he knew better about Sherlock’s nature. His eyebrows stayed high, but inched toward each other above his nose. “You’re wearing a suit?”
John nodded understanding. He picked up Sherlock’s hand and played idly with his fingers, softly massaging his knuckles, then tracing tickling paths over the sensitive surface of his palm.
George’s contract rider called for local beer, mass-market crisps, a video game system, and bags of mixed nuts, the last of which he grabbed on his way out the door. Sherlock left behind an unopened packet of cigarettes and three unopened bottles of wine, at least some of which would no doubt follow him to their next hotel, in Shoreham.
, then they take a breath and walk away to think, and then they say sorry and accept the apologies and be friends again. Still be friends.”
“Can we get some gingerbread persons? And remember that one with the little picture of me when I was a baby?”
That night, Sherlock let by four goals and the Brawlers would return to Boston with another loss in the books. After his shower, Sherlock found a note in his locker to report to coach Lestrade’s office Tuesday morning at nine o’clock.
“We’re good at it,” John agreed. “Always have been.” Sherlock nodded and, when he opened his eyes, found John looking down at him, glowing with something warmer than mere satisfaction. Affection.
“I do enjoy a disguise, I’ll admit. But I need you to create a diversion while I liberate some medical records.”
John had nearly an hour before he would be forced to leave early to fetch Rosie; in the meantime he kept his mobile in the chest pocket of his shirt and returned to the exam room. Under the pretense of fetching a swab kit to culture the throat of a feverish pre-teen, he stepped out into the corridor just long enough to check news headlines. One confirmed fatality; multiple injured. For the first time in many years, he responded to a text from Mycroft.
“There’s tea,” Sherlock told him, nodding at the kettle but too knackered to get up and fix him a cup. In reply to his inquiry, Sherlock offered, “I’m fat and out of shape. Luckily all but the young ones are, too.”
—staring up open-eyed to meet Sherlock’s gaze, and Sherlock held out as long as he could, then a moment longer, and John drew back to finish him by hand, watching intently as Sherlock’s cum left wet ribbons across his shirt where it disappeared into his trousers’ waist, and on the turned-back zipper placket open just enough to expose his pink prick.
Sherlock hummed agreement as John bustled out of the bedroom, calling one last goodbye before he quick-stepped down the stairs and out. There was a captain’s practice that morning; Sherlock could just make it if he got his arse out of bed and drove like hell, which was the only way he ever drove. He dropped back onto the pillows, pulled up the quilts and burrowed in. He wasn’t available for captain’s practices.
They drank, and didn’t talk much, and once they’d drained their glasses, John accepted the proffered light bulb, and his courage failed him--they’d only just met, and they were neighbours, and anyway maybe Sherlock didn’t go that way, though it seemed like he probably did but one must never assume--and he retreated downstairs to the much-inferior armchair and the clamour of the interior of his own head.
“All right,” Sherlock agreed, sounding less than convinced. John called up his favoured music app and rubbed his palms together, then twined his fingers and stretched them.
John had finally nearly finished the NHS job application. He spent at least a few hours a day mentally rehearsing what it would be like to work in a London clinic, tried to make it engaging or at least appealing but repeatedly failed. He cursed the tremor in his hand that had put a premature end to his life’s work as a surgeon. He doubly cursed the dead soul of the one who had shot him and left him sometimes-sleepless from the ache in his shoulder, with tingling in the nerves of his arm and hand, little irritating licks of fire that ranged from ticklish itch to stabbing burn.
And of course, sex. Sex, when they had it—which had also been a decreasing quantity in their last few years together—was like an inoculation against furious silences and sniping at each other and made the wet bath towels on the floor a bad habit rather than a personal slight. Even tired, or angry, or a bit half-arsed about the whole thing, the sex had always been good between them. Whether their growing resentments and communication breakdown had caused the frequency of their sexual encounters to decrease, or the decrease had made them resentful and distant, John wasn’t sure. Anyway, it was all of a piece.
He had done all the right things. Shoot-around with Thurston and Kocur in the morning, then a head-clearing three-mile run. Lunch time phone call to John, who was on his way back to the flat after a day in the Heads Up Foundation’s office. Checked his equipment; found an empty stairway where he sat and cleared his mind, acknowledged his emotions, bodily sensations, and monkey-mind thoughts, then let them all go. Joined in with his teammates for a round of two-touch outside the room. Roughed his crease, banged his stick, tossed his head. The game started, and Sherlock was fully present, focused like a laser beam, fully armed to defend his house.
“I used to type a lot, before. You don’t remember? When Sherlock and I were working together on his cases, and then I’d type up the stories for people to read.”
“Love you,” Rosie told him, and squeezed him hard around the neck. Once they were through, John lay a hand at the back of her shoulder and brushed her toward the stairs.
“Bullshit, Holmes, and you know it!” Merrick screamed at him, and Kocur got upright and solid in front of Sherlock’s paint, chest to chest, keeping Merrick out of Sherlock’s way. The goal celebration over, Lamm and Hollis started piling on.
, John texted. There was the sound of the school bell and an immediate outward explosion of children from every door.
John had found a Michelin-starred French/Italian fusion restaurant in Chicago with an internationally admired wine list, somehow without consulting Sherlock, who could have told him about it before he’d even gotten out the entire question of where they should dine in honour of Sherlock’s birthday.
When it became clear John was not going to respond to Rosie’s inquiry, Sherlock asked, mimicking her casual non-inflection, “What do you think?”
Nearly there, Sherlock’s breath was thick in his throat, his lungs pleasantly straining as the muscles of his thighs and calves inched toward full exertion. In rhythm with his beating soles, a silent chant arose in his mind, imploring him to keep himself in check. He could sail past, chin up, eyes forward. A few dozen strides and he’d be through to the other side. Awaiting him, a blistering hot shower, and he would take himself to a barbecue place for lunch, bring back bags-full to eat on the hotel bed while he watched a film on his laptop. He’d place a video-call to John at the end of his workday, maybe get a glimpse of him in collar and tie, always appetizing.
“He’s fine, Mycroft, “he hurried to say, “he has a concussion and he’s in the hospital now but there’s been no damage to the brain.”
It looked almost comical, the way Victor’s face was red like a tomato, and John pressed his lips together at the sight of him.
“Right, “he said, switching to his doctor's voice, “your pupils are still a little unfocussed, but that’s fairly normal with a concussion that heavy. But it’s a good sign you’re not nauseous or dizzy anymore. Your memory seems fine as well as your cognitive skills. Obviously, we still need to take a look at the results of your EEG, but I think the probability of you leaving the hospital today is quite high.”
It had always been that way. John was the one pulling him back to himself. Showing him the right way.
He had quickly realized that John had not really meant what he had said, it had been obvious in the way he had called after him when he had left the hospital room. Obvious in the desperate tone when he had called him from the police station. Sherlock had not completely understood why John had yelled at him like that at Barts but it seemed it had something to do with sentiments again. Not his area of course.
Running up the stairs to the first floor, he entered the central corridor. The ‘John’ corridor. He would find everything he needed right here.
John held him for a good ten minutes, stroking his back soothingly. It reached the point where he almost thought that Sherlock had fallen asleep against him when Sherlock finally cleared his voice and pulled back.
The corners of John’s mouth fell, and he didn’t know what to say – a fact that apparently amused Mycroft a great deal.
A particular brutal push of her thumb into the wound made him rear up in pain and this time he couldn’t suppress the choked yell escaping his mouth.
“Who knows when the doctors here will have the time to look at you?” John tried to make it more appealing. “I can probably tell you how high your chances of leaving today are.”
He cried and to his utter relief, the faceless man disappeared, leaving him alone in a deep and dark nothingness.
Sherlock didn’t answer, so John decided to take a risk. He scrambled back onto the bed, lying on his side next to Sherlock, careful to leave a strip of empty space between their bodies.
Without further ado, John rushed to the bathroom. Inside, he cautiously laid Sherlock onto the ground and then proceeded to turn on the shower. He quickly stripped down to his pants and held out his hand to test the water’s temperature. It needed to be tepid, anything else wouldn’t do.
“What happened? Did… did I pass out?” Sherlock still seemed fairly disoriented., much too his obvious dismay.
“Correct.” Magnussen’s tone was appreciative, as he continued to appraise the student in front of him. The students in the room were getting restless, John noticed. This seemed unnecessarily cruel. The professor obviously seemed to have it in for the kid.
When she was finished with the photographs, Mrs. Wilkins put on a pair of latex gloves “Alright then, Mr. Holmes, I have to inspect your wounds more closely now and take some swabs, collect a few samples as evidence of your assault. Are you okay with that?”
Sherlock was adrift. Floating between consciousness and oblivion, trapped inside an unfathomable limbus, a wasteland of nothingness, denying him access to his the ability to focus. To his unmitigated irritation, he found himself unable to grasp any coherent thoughts, he couldn’t function like he usually did. Instead, he was forced to make do with whatever bits and pieces of information his barely-lucid brain permitted him to process.
The man on the other line was blabbering away again and he listened for another fifteen seconds, pushing a pencil into the blank paper on his desk until it penetrated the thin surface, breaking the pencil as he crushed it in his hand.
A huge wave of relief washed over him then and he let out a deep breath he didn’t know he had been holding in. A small smile crept upon his lips.
“Yes, that’s what you like about me, “Sherlock retorted, and he threw a sly smile at John as a cab pulled up beside them. An undefinable but somehow nice feeling made John’s belly flutter unexpectedly, and he couldn’t help but grin as he got inside next to his friend.
, he said weakly as he looked up to the ceiling of his mind palace, closing his eyes, letting himself relax in spite of the rumble and noise around him. He needed to relax in order to get back.
Nausea threatened to overcome him and he pressed a shaking hand to his mouth, bile rising up in his throat, forcing him to swallow a few times rapidly, to push the urge to vomit away.
“Victor and Sebastian of course, “ Sherlock sneered and he knew at once when he saw the expression on John Watson’s face that he was wrong and yet he couldn’t stop himself from continuing to snarl at him.
That’s when he was hit with sudden nausea. Reacting quickly, he turned, dropped to his knees, and vomited into the toilet. Like last time, there wasn’t much in his belly and soon he was only coughing up bile. He leaned his face against the cold toilet seat, exhausted, wishing he could just fall asleep. Make everything go away, he didn’t want to deal with it anymore.
“Okay. I understand.” John scooted forward in his position so that he was near his friend and he reached out to softly grasp Sherlock’s hand. “It’s okay, “he said quietly, looking into his friend’s green-blue eyes. “I understand.” He rubbed his thumb over the back of Sherlock’s hand in an unusual tender gesture and Sherlock looked at him nervously, a little surprised too.
Jack stopped in front of him, in fact with a good distance and he lowered his head, looking ashamed. “I’m sorry man, I don’t know what came over me. I didn’t mean to come on to you that strong, I'm sorry.”
“Are you serious?” John stared at Sherlock with an open mouth. “You were nearly raped, for God’s sake, you cannot pretend that’s nothing!”
There was fondness, too, admittedly. A lot. Despite the man being impossible, despite him constantly grinding all of John’s gears with his insults and his lack of empathy, his constant nagging, and his tedious experiments cluttering or even almost blowing up their apartment, despite all that, Sherlock had somehow managed to crawl into John’s stupid heart and make himself a home there. Meaning that he had become John’s best friend. Don’t ask him how it happened, it just had. And what was even more strange was the fact that John had somehow accepted liking and maybe even enjoying living with a madman like that, as well as running around London with him to solve crimes. Somehow, inexplicably, being with Sherlock made him happy, and wasn’t that the dumbest and craziest thing ever happening to him?
Magnussen slowly approached the first row, holding his hands behind his back. He looked positively elated, like a predator ready for his meal, coming for his tasty, oblivious prey.
Very cautiously, John slipped the pill onto Sherlock’s tongue and for a second, Sherlock’s entire body lit up at the sensation of John’s hand brushing against his upper lip. Before he could fret about it, John had already turned to reach for the water behind him, and then he was putting a hand behind his head, pushing with gentle force.
“Oh, I bet you I can, “Sherlock said, his voice confident, and he started to push himself off the bed to prove it. John tried to stop him, but Sherlock shook his arm off and got up.
After a few seconds in which it felt as if his mind was completely lost in grateful nothingness, he snapped to attention again, as he remembered.
“It’s okay, Sherlock, it’s just the paramedic, “John said as he tried to calm Sherlock down by stroking his arms, “She just needs to see if you’re okay.”
“Indeed he did. I’ve been here since yesterday at three o’clock. It was a little spontaneous – me being sent here, I mean - but I’m used to this from Mr. Holmes, so I didn’t mind.”
Just to surprise him, just this once, John smirked at him, and Sherlock’s eyes widened slightly in surprise. However, he quickly recovered and smiled back.
“You were alone here, Mr. Holmes, “came the deep throaty voice from somewhere above him. “Please correct me if I’m wrong but nobody knows you’re here, right? You are such a reckless, arrogant man that you came here alone, without any help. No friend to stand by your side or rescue you ….”
He had been much younger then and utterly stupid, too focussed on getting high and too greedy to stay away from that one dealer who would agree to payment in other forms than money.
One of the assistants stepped forward and read from his notes: “Workplace 1: Acell, Billinger, Donelly, Gilroy, Grant, Hill. Workplace 2: Hummel, Jenkins, Jones, Killroy, Maxwell, Miller. Workplace 3: Newton, Novak,  Owen, Park, Sawyer, Stamford. Workplace 4: Tanks, Trevor, Umbridge, Watson, Wilkins, Williams.”
Sherlock moaned softly but didn’t protest when John cautiously slipped the thermometer between his lips.
“So that was quite something, “Mike piped up from next to him. John shot him a look and Mike smiled weakly in sympathy.
“I see, “Mycroft said after a while. “I’m sorry you think about me that way. You are wrong, by the way, but I’m sure you won’t believe me when I tell you that you do matter to me, little brother. A lot. So I won’t waste our time saying it out loud.”
“Alright, John, I’ll go now, please contact me if you need anything. And I mean anything.” John smiled at Greg’s sincere declaration and he nodded at him gratefully. “Thanks, mate, I appreciate that.”
Although he had turned John down almost instantly leaving out the fact that he had misunderstood, he had felt flattered by John’s apparent interest. At that moment he had been irritated. He wasn’t interested in something trivial as relationships, it only cost time and effort he only wanted to spend on his work. Apart from that, sentiment was a weakness, so obviously it wasn’t an option for him.
There was a heavy sigh at the other end of the line. “Yes, there has been some mishap in that matter. Apparently, one of my men worked two jobs without permission and has been so tired he slept in the car when my brother slipped out. He’s been let go, naturally.”
“Oh, come on, Sherlock, don’t pout, you know I’m just teasing you a little.” Sherlock huffed again but looked at John and blushed again as his friend winked at him amicably.
He stopped and straightened his back, holding his hands behind his back as he studied them once again with his frosty gaze, his mouth twitching almost grotesquely.
“Yes, but only with my mate’s written consent and only if I’m able to find an employer who is willing to hire Omegas.”
“You’re right, of course. The person with the larynx on the right side had to be hospitalized after drinking the hydrochloric acid in an apparent attempt to kill themselves. They didn’t succeed in doing so but the injuries to the throat and respiratory tracts as well to the inner organs were so severe that they had to be put into a medically induced coma, or they would have died. The owner of the larynx on the left side recovered completely with the help of medical care. The owner with the larynx in the middle suffered some remaining damage and has to use an inhaler from time to time, but other than that his wounds have healed just fine. I think all of you have realized by now that the first larynx belongs to an Alpha, the middle one to a Beta, and the right one to an Omega.”
John looked at her imploringly. “Please, I don’t think it’s necessary. I’ve already taken a look at him, I’m his doctor, Dr. Watson.”
John gratefully squeezed his shoulder and nodded. “Yes, Sherlock, I’m here. You collapsed a minute ago, your body needs rest. The sofa is right there next to you, do you think we can get you there?” Sherlock closed his eyes, apparently in pain – he probably had a nasty headache. But he nodded ever so slightly so John laid his arm around his shoulder, the other behind his back, and lifted him up. Sherlock lay heavily on his shoulder, almost completely unable to hold his own weight but John managed to half-drag, half-carry him to the sofa and lay him down there. Sherlock, once in a horizontal position, curled in onto himself at once and closed his eyes again. “S-so tired, John, “he whispered, his words slurring again. “N-need to lay down, a little.” He was asleep within seconds.
It had started the day after the first assault when Sherlock had declared that he wanted John to find them a fresh case, that the assault didn’t mean anything because ultimately it hadn’t been rape and that he absolutely wasn’t interested in getting a rape kit done. To his surprise, John had lost it then, had yelled at him and called him an idiot for the first time of many. Unfortunately, his stupid transport had collapsed right then, undermining John’s theory that he needed rest and time to recuperate. It was stupid, really. The Rohypnol had still been in his system, that was all. It didn’t mean anything just like the panic attack in his bedroom earlier hadn’t meant anything. His transport was prone to some sort of physical reaction after all the stress, unfortunately, he couldn’t help that, but that didn’t mean that he needed anything else than to forget. John couldn’t see that.
He shook his head, frustrated, refusing to let his worries overwhelm him. It just had felt right to allow Sherlock to stay here with him. He was a doctor, wasn’t he? They wouldn’t do much more in the hospital than he could do here. They would give Sherlock his medicine, watch his temperature, just as he was doing here. He had looked at the wound, kept it clean, had changed the dressing. He had kept him hydrated.
Ah, yeah, that would probably be the day where they had chased a cabbie throughout London and ended up eating Dim Sum in a dubious little restaurant to celebrate their first victorious case together.
“John! You need to get ready, quick!” Sherlock pulled him up by the arm. When John simply stared at him without making a move, he made a shooing gesture with his hands and when John still did not react, he shoved him towards the bathroom.
“I’m sure John didn’t mean it like that, right?” He looked at John who mumbled something incoherent under his breath, blushing slightly, unable to cope with the situation.
Greg’s face was full of compassion. He shuffled in his bag and found a printed form. “Here, I’ll fill that out with everything you have told me, you just need to sign. By signing, you’re accusing Mr. Christopher Jack Taylor officially of drug-facilitated sexual assault and the court will be informed. I have a picture of Mr. Taylor here with me, I need you to look at it and confirm to me it was him that attacked you.” He turned to John. “I need your statement as a witness, too, by the way. Maybe we could do that right after?”
A sudden thought hit him, and his head shot to the front door, a knot of fear twisting in his stomach.
He knew that what had happened to him, both times, still had an impact on him. He would be stupid to ignore that. Even if it was silly, fretting over something that had happened to his transport, the threat of rape and murder had apparently still been strong enough to affect him, possibly even traumatize him. He hated to be this weak but he couldn’t ignore this, sooner or later he probably had to deal with this.
“You think so?” Scott seemed surprised which in turn surprised John because how could Scott not have realized how brilliant he had been, how he had left every student in that class in awe of his obvious superior knowledge, but also the level of confidence with which he had proven it. Magnussen had a certain reputation on this campus and this smooth-skinned fresher had somehow managed to embarrass him in front of everybody.
John breathed a heavy sigh of relief as a thrill of joy simultaneously rushed through him at his friend’s ‘return’.
His friend looked at him with obvious relief. “John! Great, you’re here, now you can tell them we’re going home.”
Scott actually blushed at that. The sight of it brought sudden heat to the general area between John’s legs and he shifted, trying to keep the expression on his face neutral as he willed his unbidden physical reaction to disappear.
He paused before he addressed the sulking detective once more. ”I won’t take any calls from you, Sherlock. No, don’t look at me like that, I mean it. You can contact me again for cases when John allows it.”
“You know what?” said Charles Dickson to his brother. “I bet they’re into all kinds of sick stuff. I bet they’re faggots, shagging each other senseless with who knows what.”
“Yeah. We just wanted to tell you that the charges against you have officially been dropped, John. The charge of the murder of Mrs. Bendick as well as the charge of grievous bodily harm against Mr. Taylor, it’s all gone. There won’t even be a complaint. You’re completely free.”
“You know what?” Billy said and now he sounded eerily calm, almost bored. “I’m done with you. Fuck this. Fuck off.”
“Would you mind not locking the door?” John asked cautiously, “just as a precaution, so I can step in if something’s not right. And don’t make the water too hot, alright?”
“Yes, “the doctor confirmed, “it did look very inflamed. We cleaned it, took a sample, and bandaged it anew. We can only hope the infection doesn’t grow worse. He’s already on antibiotics?”
“I say piss off!” Scott cried out as he tore his hand free from John, the anger from before returning at full power. “What is it with you Alpha blockheads and your stupid Alpha ways? Can’t you accept a simple no? God!”
A tedious flatmate turned best friend that he somehow inexplicably had fallen in love with? An extremely clever man that impressed him with his outstanding intelligence and wit, even though it also tended to turn other people away? A helpless person that constantly got into hairy situations that left him injured and in need of John’s tender care? A blushing virgin he’d like to bed?
“I’ll be glad if you eat anything at all, so…” John indicated the sitting room, prompting him to go first.
And John left. On his way out, he passed a visibly fuming Dimmock. He couldn’t resist and let a triumphant smile play out on his face as he tipped his invisible hat. Dimmock’s face turned almost purple and John suppressed a vicious snicker as the door fell shut behind him.
“Sentiment is a chemical defect found in the losing side, “Mycroft had told him as he had applied some antiseptic cream to a cut on his cheek and offered him a glass of water along with some paracetamol. Sherlock had believed him then, had hardened himself and decided not to ever let that happen again. Be used like that. Lose control over his emotions and thus make himself a target.
John took care to step in silently, his eyes locked on Sherlock’s face. He didn’t react to the slight sounds his shoes made on the floor.
It disappeared quickly as soon as he stepped into his flat when he was manhandled out of his coat and pushed onto the sofa by tiny Mrs. Hudson.
He wiped the remaining sweat from Sherlock’s face and laid a cool wet cloth on his forehead. Even if he wasn’t conscious, maybe it would help him sleep more peacefully.
His whole body was tense, rigid with the wish to protect the one being threatened, and make the tainted scent of distress disappear. He was nervous that Scott would keep on protesting and be thrown out of class, but then, almost miraculously, Scott sat down and John exhaled in relief.
John was inclined to give her a piece of his mind but then he saw Sherlock glance at him from the side, shaking his head almost imperceivably, telling him
Eventually, while John was telling Sherlock about Harry’s upcoming birthday and how he dreaded having to call her, Sherlock fell asleep. Just like that, mid-sentence. His eyes closed and his head lolled to the side, a couple of loose curls falling into his face as his breathing slowed down in peaceful slumber.
John hesitated. “Well with you looking like that, it must be hard for you. To avoid drawing everybody’s attention, I mean..”
Sherlock simply hummed and watched as the man lit up the cigarette with a lighter he surprisingly had thought to bring with him, in contrast to the apparently forgotten cigarettes. He wasn’t too happy about having company, he had enjoyed being alone for a few minutes, enjoying the fresh air and a moment of peace and quiet with no loud people around him, crowding him.
“No, “Mike said slowly. Then he tilted his head. “But it did anger him even more so maybe you should have avoided doing that…”
“Oh yeah?” John got up from the couch, his voice heated now as he indeed managed to work himself up into a fit. “Please, don’t get too emotional here, it would be really unfitting for a member of the British government, would it? To get all weepy over an annoying little brother!”
“I can do anything I want, John, “Sherlock said, making a point of making his voice sound bored. “Please, could you stop shouting? You know my head hurts.”
Sherlock fixed him with a cold stare. “I think it’s my decision if I feel okay or not, John. Please don’t be presumptuous, it doesn’t suit you.”
“Yes, I know, I should have known better, alright? Believe me, it’s not as if I’m not feeling guilty.”
For now, I have written two short stories which I'll probably be posting in the course of the next couple of weeks. One is Johnlock and one will be focussing on Mycroft and Sherlock's relationship for a change. Basically, I encourage anyone with a weakness for hurt, vulnerable Sherlock to subscribe to me because I'm going to keep writing him, and Johnlock, too ❤️
It didn’t get them anywhere and Dimmock himself ended the session at last, after having slammed his fist into the hard steel table in frustration more than once. John had just sat there calmly, feeling surprisingly serene and collected. Nevertheless, he was tired, and he desperately wanted to get out of that sticky room. This was pointless anyway. If they were set on punishing him for saving another human being’s life, so be it – but he wouldn’t do them the favor of making it unnecessarily easy for them.
He was glad that they had not parted in dispute. If they had he knew he would have been unable to sleep all night, driving himself mad with guilt and anguish over how he had made Sherlock feel. He knew that his friend was still hurt by his words, but he had at least somehow accepted John’s apology and conveyed to him, that the two of them were okay.
He relaxed immediately when he saw the familiar Belstaff hanging on the rack, Sherlock’s favourite blue scarf wrapped around its collar. It was all good.
“I’m glad, “Sherlock answered relieved “and no, I wasn’t sure.” After another smile at his friend, he made his way to the door. “Goodnight John, “he said quietly, and he pulled the door open.
“You misjudged them, “John said, more seriously now. “You thought they would go at each other’s throats.”
“Hey, don’t look like that. You look like a dog that’s been through the pouring rain, “he said as he studied John looking at the door through which Scott had disappeared.
He cupped Sherlock’s face and tilted it upwards, frowning when Sherlock didn’t react, his head lolling to the side in John’s hand, eyes closed.
No words in his life had ever hurt like that. Of course, he didn’t have a best friend like John before that and so there weren’t exactly many comparable situations to relate to. Never had he been attached to a person like that before, so naturally, nobody ever had the power to hurt him like that.
“Don’t worry, John. There are other fish in the pond, you know,” Greg said, indicating the crowd of dancing people with his bottle of beer. “You’ll find another minx to have fun with.”
He could try an Alpha girl, for instance. It was rare for two Alphas to have sex, which did make sense on some level. But it was worth a try, wasn’t it? Who knew what he was missing?
It had felt as everything had been completely straightforward between them. There were no unmentioned mysteries, no clarifications concerning their relationship needed. They were there, together, happy. That was everything they needed.
“Well, he’s alright, I guess. He slept through the night and he’s still sleeping rather soundly, hasn’t stirred once. I’ve cleaned and dressed his wounds and his heart rate and breathing are almost normal since five in the morning. He has stopped sweating so much by then, finally, but I’m afraid his temperature is up a little. Not too worrisome, 38.1, doesn’t have to mean anything really. However, I gave him some antibiotics to be sure.”
“Alright, “he conceded sullenly, “we can try but I’m quite sure he won’t be happy about it. And I want him to wake up in peace so don’t have that Nurse Examiner person show up for at least another two hours.”
“Now come on, baby, don’t be that way, “the voice continued, and to John, it sounded like a threat. “We could have avoided this, but you left me no choice. Stop wriggling, it won’t do you any good.”
John looked up to see Sherlock staring at the wall, lost in that moment where he had not been in control.
His stomach lurched and he grabbed the edge of the bathtub, needing to steady himself. His heart pounded in his chest as he imagined John’s face, surprised at Sherlock’s thoughts, maybe even shocked. Maybe his face would straighten into a tight smile, wrinkles forming around his kind blue eyes as he tried to let him down easy, explaining that he had never thought of Sherlock as anything else than a friend.
“How?” he asked, his voice steadier now. “He drugged me, you said. Rohypnol, probably, right? I couldn’t see right, could hardly move my limbs, brain all fuzzy and then the headache.”
“What?” I didn’t know that!” John stopped in his tracks, and stared at her, truly aghast. “That is so unfair! How can the government allow all this?”
“You’re an idiot, and that’s why you’ve been hurt so much in the past and the reason you will keep getting hurt in the future. You just can’t keep yourself from being yourself and someday it will kill you, Sherlock! See where your bloody mouth gets you then!”
“No!” Sherlock yelled back. “No, he can forget about that, I won’t allow it! I don’t want it, it’s not necessary!”
“Hey. It’s alright, love, come here.” Sherlock seemed on the verge of tears and John pulled him into a tight embrace.
“Look, “John said quickly, “as I said, I’m a doctor and I have some experience with these kinds of things. I’ll closely monitor him, and I’ll drive him to the hospital at once should his symptoms deteriorate. He’ll probably fall asleep soon, the drug’s been in his system for at least forty minutes now. I will take care of the bite wound at home, I have everything I need for it.”
A fresh wave of despair washed over him as he entered the stairway which led to the upper main floor. He was just considering if he could muster up the strength to climb the stairs when he discovered that a new room had appeared just at the end of the ‘John’ corridor. It hadn’t been there when he had entered the corridor earlier, so it must have appeared while he had been there, looking at the files stored here. Which meant that his mind had deduced something subconsciously he wasn’t aware of yet.
“Well, “he began with a heavy sigh, “when those guys told me they went to the park I ran there straight and I followed the first road. At the crossroad I turned left and followed that road for a while but when I didn’t see anything I just ran cross-country. Then I heard a voice. He was saying … vile things. I first thought it was just some couple about to have sex in the park but then I heard his voice… Sherlock’s.” John’s voice faltered a little. “He was saying ‘No’ again and again very softly, but I was sure it was him. I ran around the corner and then I saw them.”
He tried very hard not to think of the strange things that had occupied his mind last night. Sherlock was right about John worrying about him, but he didn’t know that he wasn’t only worrying about his health but other things, too. Like the way, Sherlock looked absolutely beautiful and breathtaking and the fact that he was apparently obsessed with him.
Sherlock couldn’t help but smile back, rendered completely helpless in the face of the dazzling, disarming smile that belonged to John Hamish Watson. But inside his chest, his heart was thumping like crazy, because he knew the moment where they needed to talk was approaching rapidly. He was at a loss for words.
Sherlock smiled unconsciously at the thought of his best friend. The grumpy little army doctor could be a real piece of work with his unnecessary overprotectiveness. He wanted to strangle him for forcing him to step down and solve crimes from home instead of doing the real thing. But he knew John did it because he cared for him and although Sherlock had trouble admitting it to himself, he was thankful. Nobody had ever put so much effort into trying to keep him safe. Until John had shown up.
“Oh, don’t make me explain it, “John groaned, half-burying his face in his palms. “I behaved like an animal, that’s what I did.”
“Of course, “he said hoarsely, and he lay down next to Sherlock, after very quickly putting his clothes back on. To his surprise, Sherlock shifted even nearer and then laid his head down on John’s chest. Instinctively, John laid his arm around Sherlock, pulling him closer to his body.
John slid into the seat next to Sherlock, confused as to why he was met with unusual coldness and rejection. And his behaviour didn’t change a lot. Throughout the lesson Sherlock seemed stiff and unmoving beside him, eyes fixed on the blackboard. What worried John the most was the distinct lack of snarky comments towards the teacher, not correcting him at all.
He could feel the students in his close proximity whispering and looking at him. Gritting his teeth, John set off to find Mike and Greg. As he pushed his way through the mass off students he accidentally bumped into a tall figure in the hallway. When he tilted his head up he immediately recognized the person in front of him.
“You just didn’t quite seem to be yourself today. Look, if there is anything at all… don’t hesitate to talk to me. If you need someone who listens to you.”
As usual Sherlock was the one doing most of the work, measuring the precise quantities of the chemicals to pour into the burette and reading their results. However, after the indicator changed its colour for the first time he turned to John.
“I can’t.” John’s heart dropped at that statement, his face fell. Sherlock’s beautiful, pale eyes were still fixed on his, staring at him determinedly.
“Um… yes… I did write… um… that,” he finally managed to get out. Christ, now he’s going to think you’re a mentally deranged idiot who can’t even speak properly.
That was definitely not what John was expecting. The phone showed a photo of The Wall. More precisely, John’s writing on The Wall. I’m bi and have a hopeless crush on my lab partner. In that moment John wished nothing more than for the earth to open and swallow him. How could I have been that stupid? Of course he’d know the note was from me. Of course he’d know I meant him. Great job Watson, you have successfully managed to ruin any chances you had of maintaining a friendship with him.
“I’ll see you in class Sherlock. I really have to go and kill Mike and Greg now.” And with that, he took off.
But even if it did look a lot like Sherlock’s, he couldn’t be sure. It was crammed and tiny. Not enough to go on.
“Yeah just a sec!” he replied. “Bye, Sherlock!” With a warm smile at Sherlock he joined his rugby mate at the door to get lunch.
I’m gay and have a hopeless crush on the rugby captain. He hadn’t even thought about finding the text when he made the decision to come here. But there it was. Squeezed in between all of the other scribbles. Seeing it in real life made the writing look a bit different and suddenly a chill went down John’s spine. Seeing it from this perspective almost made the writing look a lot like… Sherlock’s.
Suddenly Sherlock’s whole demeanour shifted. The confident posture vanished. He started fidgeting, not seeming to know what to do with his hands or where to look. John found it to be absolutely adorable. He observed him closely, still trying to figure out what exactly had gotten into Sherlock.
“You’re turning down person after person without actually explaining why. It’s really not fair. You have people throwing themselves at you and you’re not doing anything about it whatsoever. Just tell Sherlock. Tell him or go out with one of the guys that are flirting with, seriously mate,” Greg told him. “There,” he added, letting out a deep breath. “That’s all the serious man to man talk I can muster up today.”
The cause for said trance was currently snapping his fingers in front of John’s face, trying to get his attention. Slender hands. Pale skin. Dark, curly hair. High cheekbones. Perfectly tailored clothes clinging to the tall, slim body. Eyes you could easily spend hours upon hours staring into without ever being able to define their exact colour. Beautiful, plush lips that were just begging to be kissed.
He slowly lifted his eyes to stare into Sherlock’s, suddenly very aware of how close they were standing together.
Greg did have a point. He couldn’t just keep rejecting every person who flirted with him. But telling Sherlock simply wasn’t an option either. Suddenly, an idea popped into his mind.
“All of you, what the hell did you do?” He was furious. “It’s not like I need the whole fucking school to know about my sexuality. Neither does the whole school need to know about that guy’s message.”
“God, I’m so sorry!” he blurted out. But instead of responding to him, Sherlock’s eyes were widening in shock and he stayed completely still. John was used to Sherlock not talking a lot but outright ignoring him seemed kind of weird and abnormal, even for him. But John had more important things to do now than worry about Sherlock behaving weirdly.
“It’s actually kind of painful to watch you pine over Sherlock. Just ask him out or declare your feelings or whatever… Something!” Greg added.
But what he found upon entering the classroom was definitely not what he had expected. Instead of the coldness from last time Sherlock immediately fixed his eyes on John when he entered the room, watching him walk over to their desk.
He was walking to the bus stop with Mike and Greg when suddenly someone gripped his arm. Upon turning around he found himself under the scrutinising glance of pale, green-blue eyes. Immediately he could feel his heartbeat pick up. Instantly he was reminded of the small moment they shared after chemistry class that day.
As usual, Greg was waiting for him at the door. John expected him to go on about John’s crush and maybe tease him about it but he was not prepared for the speech he got from Greg.
John gave him a half-hearted smile, still very confused by the past chemistry lesson. When he opened his mouth to defend himself, he was interrupted. “Don’t say anything. Just… think about it, alright?” Greg told him, flashing him a tight-lipped smile.
“Of course not, why would there be,” came the snarky reply. But John could hear Sherlock’s voice cracking slightly towards the end of the sentence.
“Well then… Maybe I can switch with Greg? Then you wouldn’t have to work with me anymore and he really is a great guy. I could partner up with Jim instead. I mean, he’s obviously not as brilliant as you are but I-“
The rest of the school day passed in a kind of blur and John grinning like a lunatic throughout the most part.
Too quickly the bell chimed, marking the end of the lesson. He folded his lab coat neatly, trying to spend as much time as possible in Sherlock’s presence.
It had been a while since his last visit and the sheer mass of doodles, paintings, scribbles and scrawls never ceased to astound him. Every time he returned he found something new, that was part of The Wall’s charm. There was everything ranging from 5 second doodles to very impressive artwork, from insults to love confessions and of course the occasional love heart with letters like M+G inside. John took it all in, unbelievably glad no one else had decided to pay The Wall a visit during their lunch break.
Mycroft smiled at him, in his typically condescending manner. “Yes, Dr. Watson, do calm down, please. There’s no need to be dramatic.” As John continued to stare at him furiously, he added, a little softer “My apologies, if I offended you.”
Without looking at John again, he grabbed his things and headed for the bathroom. He actually swayed as he made the first few steps and he could practically feel John’s concerned gaze piercing into the back of his neck. But apparently, John was holding himself back because he didn’t say anything and Sherlock was thankful for it. He was done with feeling weak and helpless and John knew it.
The inside of his mouth tasted as if something had crawled inside and died there. He couldn’t stand it, so he quickly grabbed his toothbrush and brushed his teeth vigorously. Obviously, John had cleaned the wounds on his face already and another surge of gratitude rushed through Sherlock. It was then that he also noticed the bandages sticking out from under his shirt, on his left shoulder. He pulled the fabric away and inspected the bandages. He flinched when suddenly images appeared in his mind.
. So, John pushed down the anger bubbling within him and simply followed them as they made their way to the warehouse’s entrance.
Her finger left his mouth and she pushed herself up, her eyes never leaving his. She towered over him for a minute, that triumphant smirk from before still on her mouth. He used that time to rest his head for a second because it was getting heavier by the minute and he really considered sleeping a tempting option at the moment.
The shower scene has been inspired by a similar scene in one of my favourite stories ("To Light Another's Path") by one of my favourite authors and she has generously permitted me to use that concept in my story. Thanks so much
He shook his head just a little to will himself into stopping his deductions which was really hard and tried to politely smile at the guy.
“Sherlock, “he said softly as he shook his shoulder. “We need to get you back the hospital,” Sherlock whined and shrugged John’s hand off, curling even more into himself.
He drew his shoulder blades back and fixed him a hard stare, refusing to step down and Sherlock’s eyes flitted down again. Apparently, he wasn’t in the mood for discussing things. Which was a little worrisome, because normally, Sherlock wouldn’t hesitate to put up a fight with John, perseverating on his own point of view and refusing to acknowledge John’s valid arguments, pouting and stomping around like a little child throwing a tantrum. Thinking about it now caused John’s heart to clench with surprising longing. He wanted the old Sherlock back. His old Sherlock. The one that used to drive him mad, the one that put bullets into their wall because he was bored. The one that used up all their milk or toilet paper for dubious experiments, refusing to replace what he had taken without thinking. The one that looked at him with surprise on his beautiful face when John had said “fantastic!” for the very first time.
“I feel alone when you’re not there, “John said, his heart hammering in his chest as he dared to speak again. “I miss you the second you’re not by my side. I could lie on a bed with your head on my chest forever, it’s an almost incredible feeling having you so near….” His voice broke, and he swallowed, took another deep, shaky breath .”I want to kill anyone trying to hurt you. Seriously, I want to bash their brains in, rip the arms from their sockets, take them as far away from you as possible, anything so that you won’t get hurt. I cannot bear the thought of you being hurt. I ...it almost hurts physically when you cry….”
“Damn, Sherlock, did we have to bolt like that, like madmen?” he muttered as he typed a quick text back –
He couldn’t remember what he had dreamt about this time. However, he realized as soon as he woke up, that he had slept soundly and he was feeling much, much better. He opened his eyes and relief flooded through him as the headache from before seemed only a distant memory, lingering at the back of his head. The exhaustion was still clinging to his body, but not in the way that it had a few hours ago, a heavy weight pulling at his limbs, dragging him down into tempting oblivion his body couldn’t resist.
“No! I only want to talk. Honestly, I was wishing to meet an Omega for some time now, so that I could talk to them. But I don’t know anyone and there are so few Omegas on campus, I never met one of them.”
Scanning the room for every detail Sherlock’s mind was already racing with all the information it fed him. But he needed to focus on the task at hand, so he approached the huge wooden desk where he would likely find something useful. The drawers were also locked and for once, Sherlock was not able to pick the locks. Apparently, someone was taking at least a little precaution.
Sherlock was lying back with one arm flung across his eyes. “We’re not the first, nor will we be the last, Watson.”
“Bye, then,” Sherlock said, to either or both of them, and turned his back. Rosie pulled John in the opposite direction.
“The sun? I’m afraid it can’t be helped. Natural order of things.” John bit down on a grin. “Anyway, I brought you this.” John set down a cup of lemonade he’d concocted, generous with both lemon and sugar, and with a bruised sprig of mint pushed down into it. Beside it, a tin of ginger sweets.
“Here, lean back here,” Sherlock prompted, wanting to take a selfie of the two of them with nothing but air and treetops in the background. The metal railings were strung with mesh nets, at a slight angle so that the walkways took on a v-shape.
Just barely acceptable, John thought, but it was awkward no matter what words he used. For all he knew, Sherlock had deleted their mistake already. John sent the email, shut down the laptop, and stayed where he was, letting his eyes adjust to the seep of streetlight around the edges of the windows. Sherlock had embraced him, rested his big head on John’s chest. And John could have played it off, thumped his back soundly as he hugged him with one arm, made some jokey comment about how they’d survived another kid-related crisis. Instead he’d pressed him backward and kissed him, and so John blamed himself for their moment of weakness. It had been strange and selfish, nothing like their usual, and in the moments after, he had a momentary, melting glimpse of himself coming back to that flat, to that bed, to that infuriating, imperfect man. But immediately the shadow of reality fell: the reality that nothing had changed, and that the end had been sheer hell of a kind John wished never to go through again. There was no point stepping backward into misery just because it was comfortable.
Sherlock only laid a finger against his lips, gave Molly a wink, tried not to notice that she never blushed or stammered anymore when he did so, and went to beg a cigarette from a porter. He’d be safe to smoke it; Rosie wouldn’t be home for two days.
“I’d love to have dirtied up your little bed,” he whispered, voice dry and harsh beside Sherlock’s ear. “Wanting to suck you, fuck you, eat your pretty arse, but only this. Just this.”
Soon enough Sherlock was in his place, bracing himself against a thick wooden shelf with one hand, with Steven at his back, both of them still dressed with only their trousers open and Sherlock’s pulled down around his thighs. Mouth open at the back of Sherlock’s neck, forcing a roll of his head to make space, Steven pulled at his shirt collar with his teeth, groped with probing fingers into the cleft of his arse. Pinched a wide expanse of the flesh there. There was a mirror on a stand, decorative knick knack with an ornate pewter frame, on the shelf at Sherlock’s eye level. Clever how the horniest ones always found ways to make every single object in their environment all about sex. Steven had already revealed the drawer in a pretty little octagonal cabinet, full of condom packets and tubes of lubricant; no doubt he knew all the connection points to tie ropes to his chairs and desk legs, had an extra bathrobe in the en suite bath, and a secret stash of hundreds and fifties to derail blackmail schemes or pay escorts.
John hummed noncommittally and sipped his drink. “What are you working on?” he asked, keeping the conversation going—a reason to stay—but leaving aside anything with much weight—a reason to argue, or to sigh, or ultimately to leave. Sherlock was grateful for the chance to talk over his latest project with John, his friend once more, it seemed. The only man on whom an explanation of his cases and case studies was never wasted.
John’s palms braced hard against Sherlock’s arse, shoving up and away, releasing and redirecting Sherlock’s aching cock to at last slip past John’s lips, across his tongue, against the back of his throat so he gagged and pushed Sherlock away and then started it all again. The throb of heat in Sherlock’s bollocks thrummed up his length, burst in his low belly, and John nursed the tip of his prick, suck-sipping and swallowing and growling pleasure through burbling lips.
“Eighteen months!” John barked a laugh. “That really is shameful. Lying to your parents.” He made an exaggerated expression of disappointment. “They seem lovely.”
“Not officially,” Sherlock admitted, and it struck him that he had been so distracted by rough sex and illicit contraband that he hadn’t worried about whether he would start the game for nearly six consecutive hours. “But that’s what we talked about; it’s what I was promised and what I’ve planned for.”
He might have been pacing the room by half-six that evening if his ankle wasn’t still tender, so instead Sherlock sat in his favourite chair, absently slow-spinning his mobile between thumb and two fingers, realigning it against the chair’s arm at the bottom of each rotation. He started when he heard the buzzer—proof his nerves were highly tuned and raw-ended. Limping toward the landing, he heard the slap of Rosie’s rain boots against the stair-treads, the squeak and thud of John closing the front door behind them. He crouched just in time to catch Rosie as she flung herself at him and squeezed him hard around the neck. He closed his eyes; they threatened to overflow with relief.
John looked pleased with himself, nodded, frowning, as he skated in curlicues around the crease. “Not bad.”
“How did you know it was time for rehab?” George asked, forced casual, betraying himself with a crumpling frown. Sherlock thought George’s chin might have quivered, but he’d quickly made a major shift of posture, ducked his face and scrubbed his jaw with one hand.
They’d arranged a schedule, three nights with each parent, with flexibility. The school summer holiday was coming up, but after that there wasn’t much to negotiate until Christmas,
“Watson would like it. And I find it amusing to watch you in situations so far outside your usual comfort zone. I’ll give her your number and she can text you.”
“Bit early,” Sherlock complained. “I slept a bit.” He took a half-step forward, pasted on a friendly expression. “Mr Watson recently had his number retired by the Hamilton Thrashers; this weekend is a bit of a celebratory holiday for him. I wonder if there’s anything special we can arrange.”
**BBC Sherlock fic trope alert!!**BBC Sherlock fic trope alert!!** Takeaway curry **BBC Sherlock fic trope alert!!**BBC Sherlock fic trope alert!!**
Sherlock started to shake his head. John stepped toward him, letter crushed in his hand, finger pointing accusation at Sherlock’s chest.
, as he approached. John noticed past Sherlock’s shoulder that there was an older couple sitting slightly apart on the sofa. The man was wearing a cardigan over a button-up shirt and the woman held her handbag in her lap as if afraid to be parted from it. There were the remains of tea and biscuit-crumbs on the coffee table in front of them.
John knew he should not have assumed the event was one they would attend together, and wondered if he had, in fact assumed that. Surely not. Why would it be?
Sherlock shifted his gaze from his hands--slipping the pin between the stems and the twine, into and out of the fabric of John’s shirt, then catching the twine again-- to meet John’s eyes, and favoured John with one of his genuine smiles, a pretty upward perk of the corners of his lips. He went quickly back to his work.
“She told me it’s a werewolf,” the teacher replied. “We find a lot of monster-mania in Year Two,” she explained, sweet-sounding, affectionate toward her charges. “It’s an age where children are recognizing themselves as individuals apart from their parents, which can be a bit scary. So I find a lot of them develop a bit of an affinity for monsters, things that scare them a bit.”
“Sorry. Sorry,” he apologised to the office manager as he rushed past, shrugging into his coat. “I have to get to my daughter. I’ll phone later about whether I’ll be able to work tomorrow.” The office manager and receptionist gave him troubled looks but waved him on. He stuck out his arm for a taxi, then dropped into it and found two waiting texts.
“I watch Megan Ashley and I Am Leah play it in their videos. I Am Leah got scammed in a trade for her tiger cat but she had a flying potion left so she used it on her cheeseburger cat. But it’s not rideable.”
He ate breakfast mindlessly while checking scores and stats around the league, assessing the impact of the previous night’s games upon the Brawlers’ standing. They were tied for fourth in their division—not a hopeless spot as February approached, but certainly not where they’d hoped to be. A concussed second-line center from the Milwaukee team meant suddenly the Brawlers needed to keep eyes on the St Paul Grizzlies, while their recent championship opponents, the Shoreham Shock, were showing signs of loose wheels about to come off. As Sherlock poured a third cup of coffee, he pondered these latest shake-ups and watched a few videos of the Kansas City team Boston would face the next night, seeking weaknesses for his teammates to exploit.
“I had a bracelet made for my mother, when she turned sixty; found the jeweler through word of mouth among
John, determined to keep the mood light—no small feat given Sherlock’s equal determination to wallow in his depths of misery—joked back, “From
Sherlock felt scorn for the child in the book having such a dull imagination. Likewise the book’s author.
“Of course,” Sherlock said. “In that case, Watson, we’ll have time tomorrow to continue catching up with everything we’ve missed, so it’s time to get you off to Bedfordshire.”
Sherlock resumed his seat with three pencils of varying lengths and points and a yellow, lined pad; he dealt them each a sheet of paper and a pencil.
“In short, a bad man, and a very bad doctor,” Sherlock finished. He dipped his fingertips into the paper bag, persuading it open and peering over the edge. “Biscuits, you said?”
Sherlock arranged a small smile. “Good talk,” he agreed, for John’s sake. And for Watson’s sake. Probably, too, for his own.
He’d seen Mrs Hudson spritz the plant with a fine mist of water from a spray bottle, nattering pleasantly about how it didn’t like wet feet, so she never soaked the soil, and by some miracle it hasn’t died, so why muck about with the recipe? Spray the leaves Wednesdays and Sundays and leave it alone. Though he had grown so used to the thing he barely registered its presence, in the evening hours after their return from Leeds (Sherlock had offered to buy the breakfast and the tea on the train, claiming it as a valid expense he could charge to the client, a fact which gave John an enormous sense of relief), he found himself squinting at it. The leaves wore a troubling coat of white. . .something.
“Look,” Sherlock prompted, briefly casting his glance over his own shoulder, about ten yards ahead of them around a curve. “There’s a platform, quite close in to the cliff. A good place to stop and breathe.”
“Mm.” He offered his right hand to John, who stepped around the table to shake it. “Pleasure to see you again,” he said perfunctorily.
Sherlock imagined whatever Watson was getting up to in school, it was far less disappointing than her mild refusal to drink her milk. John’s throat-clearing reached a crescendo as the army of women arrayed against the two of them took up their positions on the opposite side of the table. Their smiles seemed suddenly viper-like; Sherlock raised his guard.
John cleared his throat, cut a glance at Rosie walking just ahead and to his left, her eyes downcast to watch the toes of her trainers as she walked.
“Did you think you were taller than last time?” he asked, aware of the tightness of his teeth even as he joked.
He held slim hope of a reply, as John had clearly been ignoring his messages for the best part of a fortnight. With a wide open schedule and a hateful lack of chaotic energy in the flat, what he really wanted was to ask for time with Watson—the weekend, at least, and that Monday would be a bank holiday—but he had a sense of needing to pick his way carefully through the next little bit. John was prickly and still held all the cards.
The bandstand came in view with surprising suddenness; it was nearer the main pathway than Sherlock remembered. Gathered in a sheltering clump to its distant side were a half-dozen people, mostly men, none young, all in a uniform of sorts: old jeans, hoods of their sweatshirts pulled up to half-hide their faces, burning cigarettes in nearly every hand. Sherlock sped up despite the twinge in his shin which was now a true groan—a deep bruise from friendly fire during practice—and fixed his gaze. He could make another left, take himself only slightly out of his way, over a knoll and then back around. He could, but then again.
“Researchers, yeah. I’m sort of the opening act for their two days of presenting papers to each other, talking about brain and spine injuries.” John shrugged. “Iain will be there; he wants to hear the speech aloud, now we think it’s finally finished.”
, he told himself, and wrenched his neck left and back, where he could just see two curls of clean, smooth wire wrapped in green vinyl, and shining-new screw heads, in among the general filth and rust of the world collected beneath the bus’s bonnet. Sliding himself back out onto the open floor of the garage, he refined the thought.
at you. Look at you sucking my dick.” The contempt in his voice was undisguised; every third exclamation tilted over into unguarded pleasure, more wordless than not, but most of what he said was unmistakably disdainful in tone. Sherlock was a cocksucker and a queer, certainly no real man, probably no worthy person.
Sherlock confessed it with neutral inflection, a plain fact in evidence, available for blending with relevant context and general knowledge. He fixed a gaze on John—one John met, but didn’t hold for long.
“Right,” John said blandly. His expression had changed; he was closing down and becoming more guarded, sensitive to any perceived slights against Rosie and her obvious perfection.
Molly Hooper and young Margaret brought the platters to the table and the cook smacked the boys’ greedy hands until after she’d prayed. Dishes were soon overflowing with roast meat and potatoes, pickles and pole beans, a spectacular terrine pieced together from scraps of others--five in one, Molly called it--dark and light breads, warm berry compote, and a dark-spiced, rummy cake.
John cleared his throat. “I don’t mean to cut into your time, hanging about. I should be on my way.”
“There are rules to all of those. To minimise risk. You, on the other hand, have a rather alarming tendency to maximise risk. Because it’s fun.”
He took liberties with the finishing touches, casting a cloud in the role of Sherlock’s pillow, and crowning him with a soft corona, half-edged and angled to suggest a crown, or halo.
Over the course of long minutes, their breath was caught and they lay side by side, the wrong way across the bed.
Just as it became impossible to keep his breath quiet, and the pace of his stroking picked up, blankets kicked aside, wrenching his neck in a way that was nothing like his fantasy—no force to struggle against, only minimally uncomfortable—John shifted his limbs at the other side of the bed, hummed and rolled and moved closer to Sherlock’s side. Sherlock was close, couldn’t be bothered.
“Free Christmas biscuits with every purchase,” he said, settling the question of whether or no he would hoard the sweets for himself, for later, just in case.
Sherlock smiled. “Indeed.” He passed a glass to John, who eagerly, almost reverently, wafted it beneath his chin, letting the scent find him.
-- Oh. No. Here it is.” John set his phone on the worktop and Sherlock began measuring out the sugar. He looked livid.
Sherlock could barely stand to let John out of his sight, insisted they stay in bed most of the day. They had a no-frills morning tryst, donned track pants and hotel robes while they ate a massive breakfast at a round wood table beside the window, shared the shower, then returned to the bed to recuperate. John scrolled his phone while Sherlock scanned the television channels, which offered not much of interest. He settled on an interior design competition program; it always interested him to watch people do what they did best—the further the skill from his own experience, the better.
The way the window-pane shadows crossed the ceiling, John could let his eyes un-focus and see a map of Hellmand, and he thought about the war—not the war itself, but the eerily normal in-between. A quiet morning that afforded him the luxury of sending a subordinate with time on his hands to fetch John a coffee and a maple doughnut from the Tim Hortons at the end of the world. Treadmill runs in the gym; the best-of-the-best equipment seeming incongruous; they suffered heatstroke and frequently lost limbs, but in some very strange and specific ways were spoiled. Photos and video snippets of spouses, children—some newly born and not yet met—dogs and cats and shiny sports cars, eagerly shared with John though he had none of his own to offer. How every child had looked the same to him, but how each was thought of as by her parent as the loveliest one alive, and so John would lie and say,
, why he had to keep even eight-year-old children at artificial distance. Old habits, to some degree, surely. But the Only One In The World also felt he had a reputation to uphold, and he would hold it up for even kids on a playground to look at. A year before, John would have gotten after him about it. Five years before, John would have gently corrected him. John only cleared his throat a bit, and left it.
John waited for more. Waited and waited with the phone on his chest, his hand resting loosely around it. Woke up in the grey light just before true morning with the phone underneath the side of his chest, half-tucked between the sofa cushions. No more from Sherlock.
He crouched down to receive his hug, kissed her plump cheek, and with one fingertip directed a loose strand of blonde hair into the topmost divot in one of her plaits.
“Clearly nowhere near your heart,” he said, with unsentimental admiration, then skated back to the bench to wait for play to resume.
A near-whisper. “Have you enjoyed it? The holiday? You seem so much more relaxed than you did at your parents’.”
“Unlikely,” Sherlock said. Six months before, it would have been sniping, but it was mild; Sherlock was watching the children, tracking Rosie’s movements with his eagle eyes.
John thought a moment about how to talk about casework without giving them away as Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, yes, the ones in the papers.
“Can I suck you off?” Sherlock asked. There were many things he wanted, as ever, but there was something about the rough way Steven held his head, caught him with a tight grip beneath the chin, Sherlock found particularly. . .if not exactly pleasing, at least arousing.
Sherlock felt a twinge of the only type of jealousy he was capable of: envious of anyone who got to spend time with John when he could not. He was equally jealous of John’s colleagues from the foundation and the three hundred children who’d had the chance to deafen him while Sherlock was taking practice shots from his teammates.  He inched his plate away from himself and sat back, reaching to his inside jacket pocket to fetch out his money clip.
) sleek but sturdy headboard, and leaned his arse into Sherlock’s waiting hands, spreading him open so Sherlock could lick and suck and hum against his hole, up and down as much of the slit of John’s lovely, muscley bum as he could get to. Sherlock jostled and pulled with gripping palms and fingers, and John rocked and wriggled, and everything was wet and dark and dirty and delicious. Sherlock’s cock twitched and jumped with need for stimulation; he thrust against nothing, hips rolling in time with the motion of his tongue.
,” she protested, an automatic whinge indicative of her disagreeing with him but not particular to the current moment; he knew her habits.
Later, still before midnight but after they’d let time pass to digest their meal, John on his phone, typing with his thumbs and occasionally grunting a light laugh at whatever he was reading in response while Sherlock bundled a cloth bag full of their dirty pants, socks, and workout gear and set it out on the landing to be picked up by the laundry in the morning.
As John stepped through the door from the landing, he was met with a chaotic mess of a flat, perhaps not its usual state (though he had his doubts) as most of what caught his eye as he gazed around the sitting room was an explosion of glinting, glistening, green and gold holiday decorations. Boxes sat open, overflowing with garlands of faux pine, oversized velvet bows in various shades of red, strings of small lights. There were two trees, which John knew by smell were the genuine article, one in front of each of the windows on the Baker Street side, awaiting their tarty Christmas finery.
He texted John despite knowing he wouldn’t see it for at least a few hours, aiming for a declaration of desire but landing on something more sentimental. He hadn’t anticipated feeling soppy, though of course it was no small thing he’d done, declaring himself so firmly attached he had no wish to be let go. A ring John would wear to remind him. As adamant as Sherlock felt that he was not holding John too hard, not trying to domesticate him or change anything about all the ways in which they worked so beautifully together, he could not deny even to himself that something momentous had occurred. A mild hope flickered in the back of his mind that John might even reciprocate with a declaration of his own. But even if not, he’d smiled and agreed to wear the ring Sherlock had chosen for him, sealed it all with a kiss on the back of Sherlock’s hand followed shortly by mutual orgasms in the bath.
“What time will we expect you tomorrow?” Mrs Holmes called after them. Sherlock shrugged and lowered himself into the car.
was summoned; it seemed unfair for John to interrogate him; he was feeling slighted on top of worried. John should thank and comfort him, not grill him about inconsequential details.
“I’m sure he’s got endless advice. What I need is to start. All these disruptions in my schedule are wrecking my flow. Put me at the top of the roster, get out of my head, let me play.”
“Come on, then,” Sherlock said, and swept her onward with his hand on her shoulder. “The shop up the road. No sweets, though; don’t ask.”
“McDonald’s,” Rosie said with quick finality, before John could change his mind. He smiled and took her school bag off her. “Can I stay and play first?” she asked, her entire small frame practically vibrating in the direction of the climbing structure and swings.
No longer dependent on the visuals, Sherlock leaned hard on the edge of the sink, curled his back and neck, closed his eyes. John giving his arse a sound smack. Then another. Then clutching Sherlock’s hips with both of his strong hands, pulling Sherlock back and down onto his prick. The hot slide, how full he would feel, how thoroughly fucked. John shoving his palm against the back of Sherlock’s head, forcing some hot stranger’s cock deep into Sherlock’s throat, fucking, oh and fucking, and
Twisting tits, reminding his body what it needs to do, one-on-one time? If Sherlock had been in an even slightly less dour state of mind, he’d have come in his trousers already. He sighed relief as he shook his coach’s offered hand (thick fingers,
“And now this,” John marveled, his shoulders moving to describe a tour of the bedroom. “Our own house. You beside me every night. Every morning.”
Sherlock admired John’s throat exposed by the open shirt button and loosened necktie knot; he was a little stubbly, maybe thinking of letting his beard come in though he hadn’t said as much. The downgraded attire was acceptable given they’d chosen a place for burgers and beer rather than steaks and chateauneuf-du-pape. Sherlock was half-satisfied with the malt vinegar he’d been given for his chips, and chased the thick-cut fries through traces of beef jus left behind on his plate.
As it was in all big houses, the downstairs rooms in Stonefield Hall were busy with noise at nearly every hour, the kitchen fire crackling while the cook whistled at her work, pots and pans clanging against the tables, worktops, and stove. The maids poured out buckets of water into slop sinks, and the footmen rattled the silver while Sherlock turned the bottles in the wine cellar. There was friendly chatter as well as the stern intonation of orders given, and the curt acknowledgement of orders received. The car on the gravel drive and the stomping and nickering of the horses. Gossip at dinner. The clatter of washing up.
“You make a keen point about the inefficiency of idioms. However, what that means is: a very bad person, who is crafty and dangerous inside, can sometimes look on the outside as if they are gentle and non-threatening. Like a wolf wearing a sheep disguise.”
A lifted eyebrow conveyed Sherlock’s amusement. Once both glasses were poured and the waitstaff moved away from the table, Sherlock sampled the wine, then relished a few long moments letting John twist a bit.
The third period was a blaring blur of bodies moving toward and away from him, the glare of the ice, the chaotic jangle of the crowd—even the droning moan of Sherlock’s fans shouting
“True,” Sherlock agreed. He reached into his coat pockets, quickly drew his hands out again. Looking for cigarettes, then remembering himself. “It’s only that I enjoy watching her. I find her interesting.”
There were a few more pages, and John scrutinised photo after photo of a much younger Sherlock, smiling mild affection at each image. Sherlock could barely stand to see them. Each picture told its story, background and context clues reminding him this was just after those boys emptied his hockey bag onto the frozen pond and kicked the contents in fifty directions so Sherlock had to scramble, this was the flat with the always-dripping taps that kept him awake nights, that was his dead brother’s jumper that Sherlock wore every day until it unraveled, and even then he couldn’t cry, and it was then he knew it wasn’t just teenage self-absorption that made him think there was something wrong with him. And this was the winter he got hurt, got pills, got hooked. That bruise on the back of his hand was not a hockey injury.
“We were objectively better than you guys that year,” John put in, and Sherlock tightened the grip on the back of his hand and began to slowly persuade it along the rail, taking a half-step backwards, urging John to follow him.
John’s voice was quiet. “Why doesn’t your dad come out?” he wondered, flicking glances toward he closed door at the back of the kitchen. “You’re only here a few days.”
He closed the distance between them with a half-step forward. John, gazing down at his hand being held in Sherlock’s, sighed again, then opened his eyes—deep blue, soft, with the evidence of all his life’s joy and pain etched around them perfectly; Sherlock knew each line by heart—and opened his mouth for Sherlock’s kiss.
“Three more, then?” John offered, and Sherlock could see by the particular frown he wore that he was thinking Rosie would have to put Mary’s name on the page just to fill in the gaps and satisfy her marking rubric.
“If I didn’t think it would break her heart, you’d never see her again, Sherlock.” He shook the letter at him. “After this.” He threw the packet of paper down and away, and it scraped its edges against the floor as it came to rest under a chair. “You can’t have her.
“A holiday, in fact,” Sherlock reported. “Vermont. The Green Mountains. I don’t report to training camp for another three weeks.”
“I think it wouldn’t be pink and yellow if it was for you,” Rosie mused, then asked the judge, “Is it for him?”
Sherlock’s own eye-rolling and sharp-honed tongue had come along when John once and for all gave up any involvement in casework. Certainly he’d stopped running headlong into criminal behaviour as soon as he’d brought Rosie home from the prison hospital where she was born. Later he’d stopped taking time for the sort of paperwork he’d done a few nights earlier on the premature burial case. Then he’d even stopped updating his blog. If the work, and John’s part in it, was Sherlock’s mode of connecting with John. . .
He bit back noise, huffing air hard through his nostrils and then his open, silent mouth as he came, cum shiny and nearly the same shade of white as the marble of the floor it streaked. He panted away the last of it, felt the welcome softening of every adrenalised muscle. The quieting of his ever-racing mind to something like a dull howl, at least low-key enough to let him fall asleep. Optional morning skate. Maybe he’d go. Rather than fastening his trousers, he stripped off all but his boxer-briefs, tossed a hand towel at the mess on the floor and smeared it with his foot. Using dexterous toes to save him bending over, he deposited the towel in the tub.
“Optional skate. I’m exercising my option.” He ran his palm down John’s torso, then up, across his chest, over his belly.
Their words trailed off, and it became full dark with surprising speed. The stars were vibrant and countless, so unlike the sky over the many cities they’d bedded down in as to seem unreal. A log shifted in the fireplace, threw up sparks and a loud cracking noise. They undressed each other slowly, taking time to kiss and praise, to trace shadows and warm each other’s newly-bared skin with sighs. Sherlock sucked gently at the just of bone at the outer corner of John’s wrist. Raked fingers through his chest hair. Rolled up to lie along the length of him, and later rolled down to feel the weight of solid hips and thighs as John hovered above him, adoring eyes just visible in the faded, filtered evening light.
John told the boys stories from the war, which thrilled and terrified them, each asserting his fearlessness while pointing out the cowardice of his peers, easy for them all as--God willing--they’d never have to spend a single minute of an hour, let alone a string of frozen nights, shivering in a ditch. John left out some things, lightly embellished others, told tales of his fellows as if they were his own. Even showed a card trick he’d learned in a cafe during a leave, from a French beggar no older than the hall boy.
John had a lot of questions, which would have to wait, as Sir Paul was just then tucking his knees under John’s fake-wood table, picking a stray hair off it and flicking it to the floor. He hung the coat, clutched his notebook in a sweaty hand, and followed Sherlock across the room.
“Thank you, no.” Sherlock removed his waistcoat and necktie, heard John inhale as if to speak, then hum instead. As he loosened his shirt around the neck, he felt John rise to stand, just behind him, and turned to find him frowning furiously, neither sad nor angry, though somewhere between the two.
“Watson, oh,” he echoed himself, and his hand found his forehead in a motion John had only ever seen in Punch and Judy shows, indicating a confounding state of emotional crisis. “Oh, will people
John bit back an urge to blurt something about Sherlock only having three friends. Perhaps those were just the three he’d gotten around to writing thus far. He was having a party in a few weeks, after all; certainly he wasn’t going to have it just for three friends.
“No, go on,” John encouraged, and he felt something flickering up inside his belly, a little flame of something that might be wonderful, but he didn’t want to rush.
Sherlock tipped his head to the side a bit, studying John as if he were terribly intriguing and difficult to puzzle out. After a moment too long at it, Sherlock raised his glass in the air and said, “To bitter memories, and better days ahead.”
John nodded, comforting himself, set his jaw and frowned hard. Sherlock released his grip on his knee and found his hand, slotted their fingers together and squeezed.
“What’s this, now?” John asked, and peripherally Sherlock saw him turning in his seat but refused to meet John’s gaze; he was in no mood to be confronted in front of a social worker and a psychologist.
“No. I don’t remember ever going in that shop.” His throat ached. Now that she’d moved on to yet another random topic, maybe he could swallow the lump and all the feelings it contained—steady on, Watson, no time to fall apart—even if only long enough to get her settled at dance class and excuse himself to walk out for some air.
Upon his return, he found John had thrown back the blankets and was lazily stroking his upright prick in his left fist. “Give a bloke a hand?” he asked, with a slight smile in Sherlock’s direction.
Sherlock was saved from having to come up with more items for the To-Do list John seemed to want from him by the server bringing their appetizers and the sommelier the next course of wine. To his mild amusement, the first pour was offered to John for his approval, and with a light shrug he sipped—Sherlock could see him holding the wine in his mouth, coating his tongue before swallowing—then nodded and said, “Very nice, thank you.”
Sherlock dampened his fingertips and went after a few waving locks that wanted taming, plucking and shaping in front of the bathroom mirror.
John watched the game from the owners’ box with Kim; the Thrashers took it four to three, which certainly pleased him. For his part, though, Sherlock was annoyed with himself for letting one get-able puck go by him on the stick side, and his self-chastisement crowded out anything positive he might have thought about the rest of his performance: three perfectly legitimate goals against him, just the one bad one, and twenty-seven saves. He huffed and grunted his way through undressing, ditching his gear in a heap for the equipment manager to sort out and pack, but reminded himself it was John’s night, and so let the steam-heat of the shower slough away his residual layer of dark thought. By the time he was dressed and ready to show his face, he had all but shaken off the loss. Nothing a night in bed with John wouldn’t resolve.
“It’s fine,” Sherlock said, monotone. It might really be fine or it might not; Sherlock was not giving much away to John these days. His hand drifted up toward his chest, going for cigarettes again. A divorceable offense, five years ago.
“The sign,” Sherlock prompted, as John was about to shut it. John affixed the Do Not Disturb card to the door handle, let the door fall shut on its own as he quick-marched across the room to where Sherlock sat, took his place between Sherlock’s splayed thighs, kneeing aside the rolling desk chair as Sherlock wrapped his legs around Johns thighs, shoved his hands up under John’s t-shirt front to stroke his chest and shoulders as they kissed, hot and deep.
“OK then,” Rosie agreed, and let herself be soundly kissed on the cheek before she peeled away, sprinting, folding herself back into the group of friends piled on a wide saucer-shaped swing, trying to sync up their momentum to get it going.
“Right,” John said, waving his hands, shaking his head, shrugging his shoulders, making every indication it was Not A Big Deal. “Another time.” He gathered his bag from where he’d left it by the front door--before the sleeping arrangements had become clear--and headed for the bedroom. “Good night then.”
He nodded, finally met Sherlock’s gaze. Sherlock nodded back, biting down hard on his back teeth. “I appreciate that,” he said, and let his hand drop off the bottle’s neck, took a step toward the sitting room. As if startled to action, John strode firmly in the opposite direction, toward the door, speaking in a more business-like tone.
Sherlock heaved a great sigh, unashamedly naked with bedclothes carelessly arranged to provide only minimal modesty, leaning heavily on one elbow while waving the other hand through the air.
“No! No,” Iain protested, waving his arms like a drowning man, surrendering. “I meant the three of us together.”
It had been so quiet all through 221 Baker Street all morning that John assumed he must be the only one at home. He was working--still--again--on his application for placement in an NHS clinic, not particularly wanting to receive one. He had money enough to get him through to the first of the year, provided he lived in his typically frugal fashion. No one to buy gifts for, no obligatory officemate present-swaps, no real need to make a fuss. Though he was weighing up the possibility of a bottle of Macallan. He’d enjoy a bit with his Christmas lunch of (probably) a sandwich and crisps, same as every other day. New Year’s Eve. He’d wait and see what his prospects for a steady income were, mid-month.
“She recovered quickly,” John said, self-deprecating, and heard Sherlock hum. “What was that about—your neck? Slept wrong?” He’d already said he was leaving, and yet here he was making small talk with the only man on earth who hated small talk more than John did.
“You couldn’t have known,” Sherlock replied. “Anyway, it comes apart. Give me the other half, if you decide you want to. Later.”
Sherlock sank into the moment, a relief like arriving home after wandering, and chose to focus on gratitude for it, rather than the back-of-mind fear that it wouldn’t last.
“The missus made me quit,” Lestrade replied apologetically. “Consider yourself lectured about smoking.”
“Yeah, fine. Whatever.” He had gathered up the items and moved to put them on the bedside table but seemed to think better of it. “Is that it?” he demanded.
Sherlock’s instinct was to point out that other really quite good thing they had between them—just then tucked into bed in the room above—but held it back in favour of a shrug. “You could just say no thank you.” Sherlock was unsure whether he felt rejected—or embarrassed?—but in any case he put a mild joke in his tone, to blunt the edge of the scold.
“I imagine perhaps less time than that, if you wear something memorable. Your red jumper with the pigeon on it.”
“And then. . .” he grimaced, an expression of embarrassed disappointment in himself. “Then instead of speaking up, I just hung on to resenting it.” He made claws with his fingers, illustrating. “Felt righteous and martyred. All those healthy things.” He shook his head at himself, then let go a little laugh. “All this therapy’s making me. . .I don’t know the word for it.”
At least the posters saved him from the struggle of coming out to everyone, that job had been done for him. And John began to feel the consequences. Over the following days he received more flirtatious looks from guys than he ever had from girls and he really didn’t know how to feel about that. The temptation to flirt back was definitely there but every time John thought about flashing those boys a mischievous smile, images of Sherlock flashed before his eyes and he couldn’t help comparing him to them. No one, John discovered, seemed to have the same effect on him that Sherlock had.
When it was finally Tuesday, John was almost giddy to see Sherlock again. After the struggles of the past week he was looking forward to be in Sherlock’s presence again, calming himself by drinking in every feature of the beautiful boy.
He lifted his eyes to Sherlock’s face, taking in the beauty he saw. When his gaze met Sherlock’s, a tentative smile crept on his face which was instantly reciprocated.
John had spent a lot of time looking at Sherlock’s writing as he always wrote down their results himself because apparently he didn’t deem John to be capable of doing so without messing everything up.
John hadn’t come here to find more about his secret admirer. He had come to make a confession like so many before him. So he picked up the sharpie, looked for a spot that was still relatively free from any drawings, took a deep breath and started writing.
The picture showed someone’s writing that stated “I’m gay and have a hopeless crush on the rugby captain”.
When the bell rang Sherlock immediately gathered all his folders and stood up. Just before he could storm out of the room, however, John grabbed his sleeve. Sherlock stilled.
“What you need is a good distraction. Someone else to take your mind off that science kid,” Mike suggested, a mischievous smile playing around his lips.
Still quite confused, John took the pen and wrote down the exact quantity of hydrochloric acid left in the burette.
At that moment, the bell chimed, indicating the start of the lesson. John was happy when he heard they were going to conduct some titration experiments, looking forward to being able to spend more time doing something with Sherlock instead of just sitting beside him.
“What the fuck, Mike?” John shouted at them. Immediately their laughter subsided. Most of them quickly fled the scene upon seeing their captain’s rage leaving only Mike, Greg and Bill.
But apparently that was not going to happen today. Even the other students seemed to notice that something was wrong with Sherlock. John noticed that, as time passed, more and more confused glances were being thrown in their direction.
He knew that the guys meant well but he also was unbelievably glad that the whole thing seemed to be over.
When it was finally Tuesday again John was feeling a weird mixture of nervous, excited and apprehensive about facing Sherlock again. He rarely saw him outside of chemistry class and if he did they only shared fleeting glances, acknowledging each other.
“Well, you’re saying that now,” Mike grinned. “Shut up Mike,” Greg interrupted him and the two seemed to have a silent conversation. John was really confused. Something was going on.
John continued watching Sherlock for the rest of the lesson like the lovesick sheep that he was. Occasionally he heard him muttering something like “mentally deranged idiot” when Anderson dropped a test tube filled with sodium hydroxide on the floor or “it’s obvious, how can you not understand it?” when Mike enquired him about a specific formula he didn’t quite get. And then there were the usual complaints about the class being “pointless” or “boring”. John was used to it. It was his job to ensure Sherlock didn’t insult everyone around them.
Throughout the lesson Sherlock kept insisting on not writing the results down himself. Instead, he looked at what John had written down, gave a curt nod and filled the burette again.
But the boy in question only tugged on the sleeve of John’s sweater, motioning for him to follow. Sherlock had never really talked to John outside of chemistry lessons so having him turn up and wanting him to follow was incredibly strange.
“Well, if you say so… Then I guess I’ll see you next week?” At this point John had gotten pretty nervous. He didn’t dare to meet Sherlock’s eyes, suddenly having developed a tremendous interest in his shoe laces.
“Yes, sorry Sherlock. What can I do?” Sherlock only rolled his eyes. John knew how much he hated repeating himself. “I asked you to hand me that flask”
The Wall was in a place tucked away between the restrooms and janitor’s closet. Over the years it had been filled with all kinds of anonymous confessions and doodles. Even the efforts of the administration to paint over the writing had proven to be pointless as the students always took over again, covering it with their scribbles.
“Hey Sherlock” The boy in question seemed startled at the greeting. Immediately his whole body stiffened. He looked up at John with an undiscernible gaze, staring at him.
“The secret admirer note, John. I wrote it. Do keep up,” Sherlock said impatiently. John couldn’t help but smile fondly at him upon seeing the usual snarky attitude return. When he realised what Sherlock had actually just said, his smile grew impossibly wider.
“Hm, sorry, what did you say?” John snapped out of the trance he’d been in for the most part of the last minute.
The entire day was complete torture. Everyone in the school was looking at him. He could feel the whispers behind his back. Greg continued to apologise profusely, but John just waved it off. The harm was already done. Although he really did want to find his secret admirer, even if it was just for the sake of apologising to him for the behaviour of his idiotic friends.
It didn’t take long to find the rugby crew. They were all sitting around Mike, Greg and Bill on the school yard, seeming to enjoy themselves immensely.
The attention from students seemed to die down over the course of the week but John still got one or the other flirty look thrown in his direction. He had given up on trying to find his secret admirer, there were simply too many people messaging him, claiming to be “the one”. Some of them were just trolling him. John had been careful to avoid being too specific about his confession, he really didn’t need another poster incident.
He had been looking forward to taking a break from all the weirdness of the week. Even if Bill, Greg and Mike had actually taken down all the posters it had apparently not been fast enough to prevent seemingly every gay or bi male person in the school from getting his phone number. Throughout the whole week he had received messages from at least ten different people declaring their love to him. Combining that with all of the flirtation directed at him, John just wanted to hide somewhere. Preferably somewhere dark and quiet. Busying himself with watching Sherlock was even better.
Now and again their arms brushed due to having to stand quite close together and every time it happened, warmth was spreading throughout John’s whole body.
