“Well, I was attempting to make a name for myself as a consulting detective.   Someone the police can turn to when they are stumped, which is always, because most of them are idiots.  Maybe I’d take private clients.  I have a website,” he added proudly.
“Especially.  Now, shut up, stand there, and try to look stressed out.”  It wouldn’t be a stretch.  Even without his ubiquitous coat and scarf, Sherlock was meticulously dressed in a suit and couldn’t look more uptight if he tried.
Thuckata-thuckata-thuckata
“I asked him if he needed help, if he wouldn’t mind.  We used to talk all the time, you know.” Owens sighed.  “I know it’s stupid, I was a grown man.  But what we feel in childhood never really fully leaves.  I just…”  He swallowed hard.  “I just...I don’t even know, just
“Safe, yes,” Sherlock replied.  “Slow, no.”
“Owens?” John breathed.  “Adam Owens?”
“Oh, there she is again!” said Molly.
John raised an eyebrow.  “Little favour?  Your ‘favours’ are never
“Don’t go to work,” Sherlock said at length, drawing the duvet up from where it had been kicked down to the end of the bed.  “Just stay here.  You can force me to eat breakfast and then we’ll have plain vanilla sex again.  Then we’ll find a case, get into a bit of trouble, come home and do it again.  In the sitting room.”
“You’d love it.  I can picture it now - you looking all posh, smouldering at the camera as they style your hair and go after you with a makeup brush.  You wouldn’t even have to try.”
Both men seemed pleased with this information.
Moriarty claps his hands in delight.
Hello, insistent erection: proof that Sherlock Holmes is indeed human and male.  I think it looks ridiculous.  On John, though.  Well, that’s another matter.  I very much want to see his anatomy, in all its various states of being.
John looked up into Andrew’s face.  “Is that so.”
“And you, Dr. Watson.  Mycroft tells me you write about Sherlock’s adventures on an internet diary thingummyjig.”
“I want to know more about my father, before I was born, before Mycroft was born.”
“No.  Although no one really has the patience to go after something like a dahlia or something with loads of petals.  No one picks roses, if that’s concerning you.”
Then I ate three more.
“Oh.  Well, I guess I’ll meet you there.”
The kiss was tentative at first, their lips brushing, again and again, John not wanting to be too eager and scare Sherlock off -- he had absolutely no clue about the man’s prior sexual history except for his one-time mention of past ‘lovers’ -- but it wasn’t long before Sherlock’s hands came up from the water to slide John forward, bringing them closer together.  Without thinking, John spread his legs to let Sherlock kneel between them.
“Oh.  John.  Hi.  These things.  Hybrid tea roses.  Pain in the arse.  If they don’t have bugs, they have mould.  If they don’t have mould, they have bugs.  And this one?  This one hasn’t bloomed in years and I’ll be damned if I can’t figure out why.  It’s starting to bud, here, see?  But these will just rot and fall off in a few weeks and that’s that.”
The breakup hurt, but as all hurts generally ease with time, John got on with his life and added another continent on which he had enjoyed the company of women.  He still loved easily, enjoyed flirting, loved having a good time.  He wasn’t as much of a Don Juan as some of his squad made him out to be, although he could boast, if he wanted to, about his unusual ability to attract a lover.  He didn’t particularly like one night stands, although he had his share of them. No one ever entered relationships while deployed under the pretence that it was actually going to end in marriage, kids, and a house in the suburbs.  Hell, you didn’t even know if you were going to live another week, for that matter.  Murray knew what that felt like.  He knew that sometimes things happened in the heat of the moment, things you didn’t talk about, things John didn’t even want to think about.
“These techniques are used more for comfort and relaxation,” explained James as he took the bottle from its location in the heater.  “We do a lot of these for couples, and even teach a class once a month.  Very popular.”  John heard, rather than saw, him pour the liquid and rub it between his palms.  He tried to picture Sherlock and himself at a couples’ retreat, Sherlock’s slender feet between his hands.  All he could imagine was Sherlock complaining about John ‘doing it wrong.’  Thinking about Sherlock doing it to him was probably not a good idea at the moment.
“That’s fine.”
Chapter 10: In the Garden
John knelt there, trying to absorb everything he’d just heard.  Behind him, Sherlock was still, back to the room.  For a time, the world was just three men in a flimsy bubble of pain and memory.
John couldn’t tell if Sherlock looked put out or thankful.
“I’d like very much to tell you something.  Something I want to say.”
Mrs. Hudson gave a hiccuping sob.  “He won’t eat a thing!” she confessed, then realized her error and sobbed again.
“There’s nothing that girl can’t do. She even helped do the decorating. Made a dent in the finances at the time but within two years, we had not only paid for the renovations, but were turning a considerable profit.  Her ‘Fountain of Youth’ is extremely popular.  I owe her tremendously.”
John felt his attraction for her quickly deflate.
John rolled over, tucked his arms under his head, and looked at the ornate ceiling.  “Of course.  But you know, Sherlock, I find that I can’t really be arsed.  You’ve got a case, I’m going to relax, have a nice massage, eat like a pig, and we’re going to have a proper holiday.  I couldn’t give a fuck about what anyone thinks right now.”
Sherlock dutifully consumed the minestrone John bought for him and then proceeded to read the story aloud; John took his time with his lunch and listened.  Although he was reading quietly, Sherlock had a beautiful voice and certainly had the gift of modulating it for storytelling.
“Don’t worry.  I wasn’t planning on going out.”
“No.  I’ve, uh, been published.”
Though, when John thought about it, he’d probably chase right after him...and enjoy whatever mischief they got up to.
“Did you check the website before we came?”
I can tell him with words, but I find it easier to tell him this way, to show him how much he affects me, body and mind. So I lavish my attention between his cheeks, very slowly licking him before applying my entire mouth to kiss his anus like I would his mouth.  I run the tip of my tongue around the rim, listen to him sigh.  I fuck him with as much of my tongue as I can, tasting him, filling my mouth and nose with his scent.  I press my tongue against his perineum, worrying that tight skin.  Slowly, he relaxes.  That beloved ring of muscle begins to kiss back, twitching against my tongue.  If I push inside, John will moan.
Sherlock sat up then and narrowed his eyes. “You don’t think I can?  I deduced you the night I met you.  In the dark and in the throes of an incredibly nasty withdrawal, I might add.”
He’s barely played two notes before she’s twigged it: he has had sex.  Multiple times, at that.
John honestly didn’t know if Sherlock Holmes was a snorer or not when asked by the owner of the Cross Keys Pub.  It wasn’t until nearly ten years later before he could answer with absolute certainty.
“I’m all yours,” he says, and smiles at me in that lazy way that means that I can have my wicked way with him.
“God, that’s bloody awful.”
“Yes.”
John met with Jackie Metcalf, the pub owner, since he was just around the corner.  He drank an obligatory pint at the bar as Jackie recalled what he remembered about Archibald.  Unfortunately, Jackie’s father suffered from rather severe early-onset dementia and wouldn’t be able to give John anything helpful.  Jackie himself didn’t know Archibald well at all; he and Mycroft were the same age, and from what John could gather, most of Archibald’s interaction with the villagers was before Sherlock was born, and all of it in the summer months.
Mr. Chapman shook his head.  A tortoiseshell cat sauntered out from the back and jumped up on his owner’s lap.  Mr. Chapman stroked it gently.  “Pity.  He was a bright young man.  Unusual, but bright.”
“John?”
“That’s it,” murmured Sherlock, sliding his hands down John’s sides to his hips before running them back up again and over his nipples.  John sighed and leaned into the touch.  He closed his eyes as Sherlock manoeuvred their bodies so that Sherlock was directly behind him.  John felt the nudge of Sherlock’s cock between his legs, and he closed them so that Sherlock was trapped there between his thighs.
“Well, when they sell this place, I’d like...I’d really like to go back to London.  Get my MRCP qualification, and then who knows?  It’s funny, you’ll laugh, but I’ve always wanted to work at Barts.”
Behind them, the thorny mass of Sherlock’s roses that had lain dormant for years began to bloom, sepals separating as the flower within slowly broke forth into the light.
“Is your shoulder all right?” asked Sherlock.
“What?  Tell me!”
“No!” she said immediately.  “Though there were people in town who were jealous, of course.”
“Sure,” said James, darting his gaze between the two of them, clearly unsure what the hell was going on.  “Er...are you on your feet a lot?”
“I don’t know.  Really, I don’t.  Again, I don’t mind creativity.”
I must have been for some time now, my body responding to his as we slept, my cock filling, expanding, seeking the warmth of John’s body.  I shift a bit, seeking to extract my arm from underneath John’s head.  I’ve been curled up too long; my body longs to stretch.  I do so as gently as I can as not to wake John.  Not yet.
Sherlock ignored John’s last comment and finally sat back in his chair.  He had a penchant for pacing and waving his arms while told stories; now he was still.  He stared at the fire (unnecessary for the time of year, but enjoyable nonetheless).  “I rescued the cat,” he said at last.  “It’s the only pussy Mycroft’s ever stroked.”
“Jesus Christ.  What happened to him?” queried Lestrade as Sherlock studied blood spatters that were nearly indistinguishable from the florid 1970s wallpaper on the kitchen wall of a Hackney flat.
“That’s it,” John murmured, encouraging.  “Yeah.  That’s it.  Love to touch you here.  Fuck your arse with my finger.”
people before and that he not only liked it, it was
Everything had been boxed up in crates and packing cases; they’d spent the entire day sorting, folding, wrapping, taping, and loading until John’s shoulder began acting up and Sherlock developed a case of the sulks.  They were both irritable and moody by dinnertime.  John had hoped for a nice, final, intimate meal with Sherlock, but as the kitchen had been completely gutted of cooking utensils, plates, and cutlery, they were forced to go into Burnett Thwaite for supper at the local pub.
“Cheeky rascals, those kids.  But they loved Archie, especially Henry.  They’re all off to who-knows-where, but you can ask Margie.  She’d tell you.”
“Does it matter?”
Sherlock clears his throat, and John clears his mind.
“I didn’t see any like that in the secret garden,” said John as they eventually entered the large walled garden that ran alongside of the house.
One night, before showering, he stared at himself in the mirror under the punishing glow of the fluorescent lights.  His tan was already fading, bags had appeared under his eyes.  He’d lost a stone and a half.   His right upper thigh bore an ugly six inch scar that ended in a strange-looking V.
“Oh, shut up,” replied Mycroft primly.  “Apparently, you are too.”
John nodded.
John scratched the back of his head.  “I may have elbowed him in my sleep.”
“I’m interested in the motive and crime; the punishment I could not care less about.”
, thought John.
“Yes?”
“He is my brother.”
John, concerned, took a seat next to her.
The evening was pleasant and warm, and John enjoyed the ride into the city.  He could faintly smell whatever aftershave Sherlock had applied whenever Sherlock shifted, could feel the heat of his body through the leather.  John hoped it wouldn’t make his friend too uncomfortable, being in a pub with strangers.  It’s not that Sherlock didn’t know how to behave in social situations.  He did.  He just chose not to.  John had no idea why Sherlock decided to make an exception in his solitary life to include him, but he was pleased that Sherlock did.
“Come closer,” she beckons.  “Do you want to know how I got out?”
“This whole case,” Sherlock extrapolated, waving his arms, “he knew!  From the very start.  It’s not like he even needed me to work it out.  No offence,” he added, waving an arm towards John.  Well, that hadn’t changed.  “He knew exactly what was going on.  He did this
How John managed one-handedly to carry the tray up to Sherlock’s room without spilling anything was a minor miracle.
“Crime forensics, mainly.  Most forensics experts are idiots.  So far I’ve specialised in dirt, which is like a fingerprint in and of itself, aquatic microbiology, pollen, explosives, poisons, ballistics, animal hair and dander, and perfume.  I have a blog, if you’re interested.”
John met Sherlock’s eyes in one of
First, some thanks.  To you, the readers, who took a chance on this story and stayed with me; you left awesome comments, recced me on Tumblr, spread the love around.  I appreciate each and every one of you.  To you, Bettyswallocks, who is a dear friend, and Canolacrush, who has become one.  These two people spent hours on this fic.  HOURS.  They deserve a round of applause.
“Pistachios,” said John.  “She said she’s allergic to...pistachios.”
“Can you tell me how you’re feeling?  Are you in any pain?”
“You do understand the implications of this particular room, do you not?”
John meant to wait up but fell asleep on the sofa.  He woke late in the morning thinking that maybe Sherlock had touched him in his sleep, placed a hand on his head, smoothed his hair.  But he couldn’t be sure.  He wondered what it would be like to lie with Sherlock on the sofa, both on their sides, snuggled in, snoozing on a lazy afternoon, dust motes swirling in the air while London went about its business around them.  Would that be something Sherlock would even want?  Would he be demonstrative?  Affectionate?  Or would their physical interactions take place only behind locked doors, away from public scrutiny?  What was sex, exactly, to Sherlock?  A biological imperative?  Although Sherlock always maintained that John knew him better than anyone else, John still couldn’t predict how his friend would act, what would change, when their relationship finally moved from just friends to lovers.  And how would John explain his...inadequacies...in bed?  What kind of lover would Sherlock be?  Attentive and thorough?  Bossy and dominating?  Shy and clumsy?  All at once?
“Indeed,” said Sherlock, before continuing down to study the corpse’s legs.
“Sherlock?  Are we going somewhere?”
“Show me.”
“Then keep talking.  It’s best if you don’t think about it.  Stare at the ceiling.  Recite the periodic table or something.”
“I”ll text you.”  And then, Sherlock was off, leaving John standing in the dark.  He fumbled in his jacket for a miniature torch, and waited until his eyes adjusted enough to find his way to the large pool area before turning it on.
“I see.”
“Yes.  I told her last week.”
Leybourne looked like he was trying to recall his employee’s face.  “You would?”
“The house is relatively uninteresting, unless you like looking at room after room of old furniture.  The Japanese Garden is rather beautiful.”
“Suit yourself.  I’m sure Mike and his wife wouldn’t mind.  And I’m sure we could make use of you.”
This scene takes place during chapter 22, “The Momento”.  When I was originally writing The Guarded Secret, I didn’t really see a place for an explicit sex scene.  So I didn’t write one.  I was also under a time constraint; I had to finish before I went back to work.
you.  And I’ll be yours as long as you’ll have me.”
Much to John’s surprise, Sherlock closed his eyes, right there in the middle of the room, and did something funny with his hands; his lips were moving, even his eyes under his eyelids.  For a moment John wondered if he were having a seizure, but then his eyes popped open and he gasped an audible “Oh!”  He turned back to the shelves, scanned it again, and plucked a slim volume from the shelves, and brought it to his chest.  He pressed it against himself, holding it tight, before extending it to John.
“You’re welcome to the thermal cycler,” said Mike, leading them over to an open workspace.  “Clean what you use, replace what you break.  So detective work, eh?”
want to have some kind of man-to-man deep relationship talk with you right now, okay?  Sherlock and I...we’re just...”  John sighed.  That was the problem, wasn’t it.  They were “just”.  Just friends, just flatmates, just an inseparable pair.  “We’re just us,” he settled for.  “Sherlock doesn’t
“It won’t help.”  John thought about the hateful blue rubber therapy band he’d binned earlier that day (it was
“That’s the point.”
John’s giggles were renewed afresh and they laughed at the absurdity that was their lives.  “...Yeah, right, fucking a muff,” he managed to stammer out.  “So that felt...that was, um.  Jesus, Sherlock.”
“Excellent, I’m sure.  You want to come?”
Who knows how much Sherlock’s brand cost - John didn’t see it here, but knew it was salon-issued.  John didn’t dare ever use it.  Sherlock would know.  He could probably determine how many mL were left by sight alone.
John was nearly asleep when he realised Sherlock’s breathing had picked up, felt his heart hammering away through his back.  He’d barely noticed his erection, having grown used to the bulk of Sherlock’s genitals pressed against his bum as he slept.
“I had some crisps earlier.”
Sarah, as it turned out, was incredibly attractive and kind; she wasn’t phased in the slightest about his cane or the tremor in his hand.  The half-hour interview went well, and she assured him that she’d be in touch soon.
“No.”
And then there were the things that John didn’t know what to do with, but thought might amuse Sherlock when he needed distraction.  A small, disintegrating stuffed owl.  An old tin of mints containing a mummified mouse (Mrs. Hudson claimed she had no idea).  Miniature bottles of Scotch, Tia Maria and Creme de Menthe, date unknown.  A man’s black leather jacket.  A telephone directory so old that Scotland Yard’s number was WHI 1212.
“Yes.  I see you’re above all that.”
“Not that I can tell.  If she’s doing something untoward, she’s covered all her bases.  She was not the least bit nervous that we would discover anything out of the norm.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You hit me in the shoulder once,” Sherlock mused.  “I had that bruise for an entire week.”
“Except for Chris,” said another woman.  “Lad thinks he’s Mo Farah.  We told him to bugger off and wait for us at the finish.”
John was so intent on picking aphids off of Sherlock’s roses that he didn’t notice Molly slip into the garden until she was directly behind him.
Yet Sherlock
.  It lay there wetly, a gleaming blob of greyish muscle in a pearlescent cradle.  I remember sniffing it.  Barely an odour there, salty, perhaps.  I poked it with my finger, chased it around its shell.
John let Sherlock play with his hair a bit more, and then was suddenly rather worried.  “Will it bother you?  To be seen with me?  Old, decrepit Grandpa John?  Will you still find me attractive?”
John was summoned by Mycroft later the next afternoon.  Something about the man made John slightly uncomfortable; namely, that he was holding something back, and John hated dishonesty.
Here are some other sites I used for research if you’re interested
Sherlock looked down at the table, ran his finger over the edge.  “It hurt,” he said.
Through trial and error, they’d found that John was most comfortable with a certain brand of massage oil than anything else; the smell was pleasant, its viscosity perfect, and one generous application usually lasted the entire time.  Unlike Sherlock, who, under John’s gentle ministrations, opened easily, his anus relaxing nearly on touch, John took a while.  Which was perfectly all right with him because his lover was incredibly skilled with both his fingers and tongue and the whole process felt
John chucked the pillow, not caring where it landed and approached his new lover.  He had to reach up a bit to help pull the shirt from Sherlock’s shoulders, and when one was uncovered, he kissed the skin below his collarbone.  “Do you know how many times I just wanted to, just reach out and...”
“You aren’t my life, Sherlock.  You did just fine without me all those years.”  John exhaled loudly.  Sherlock had mentioned on several occasions that his finding a flatmate - and even a flat - was a nearly impossible task: he knew he was difficult to live with, much less be friends with.  He may be a genius, but his interpersonal skills were total shit.  If Sherlock had a fear at all, John figured it was being on his own again, searching for another flat and a poor sod to put up with his antics.  The truth was that Sherlock
Sherlock nodded again, and John found himself smiling on the way back to his room.  He showered and changed his clothes before heading to the kitchen to make something to eat, adding an extra sandwich and an apple.  By the time he got back to the east wing, Sherlock’s unpacking was well underway.  The door was open, so John let himself in.  Books were everywhere.
“My knife,” said John, peeking under the gauze at the flap of skin.  It extended from his first knuckle to nearly his fingernail.  It would take a while to heal, he thought, and he’d have to keep the finger fairly straight until it scabbed over, maybe a week or so.  He’d have to snag a finger splint from work.  How irritating.
“Sorry.  Habit.”
John could be so insipidly dull sometimes.  If he had not broken wind in the doctor’s general direction, it was simply because it’s not what you do when you are trying to impress your flatmate, when you are attempting to be alluring and mysterious.  A peacock on display does not fart.  He struts, he fans his tailfeathers and attracts his mate.  John, however, seemed to be oblivious to the peacock’s charms.  Likely because he was not a peacock.  A bird of prey, perhaps, some type of falcon, maybe.  How did falcons attract mates?  Likely in the same way.  Tailfeathers or talons or something.  Perhaps the bird metaphor was unfitting, however, since the female bird only chose the showiest mate for the sake of passing down her genetic material, and John had no use for Sherlock’s genetic material whatsoever, at least as far as reproduction was concerned.  Come to think of it, most biological metaphors were completely unsuitable, since most the mating behaviour in males for most species were frankly barbaric in regards to male relations, rams hitting each other on the head again and again in competition, stags ripping each other’s throats open just for a chance at a two minute copulation with a fertile female.  Even more confusing was the fact that John and Lestrade seemed to be vying for the loudest and smelliest wind.  Was a male’s stench a sign of his success as a mate?  Did intelligent men really find this kind of puerile silliness a sign of manliness?  Did they wave it around like the peacock’s tail, a telltale sign of a healthy and properly functioning digestive tract? Sherlock’s eyebrows came together in frustration.  No, forget the peacock.  Did birds even break wind?  No.  They didn’t.  Peacocks most certainly did not sneak out to use the toilet in the bathroom of the currently vacant third floor if they needed to void their bowels while their flatmate was home out of common courtesy and a completely unwarranted but undeniable need to be found...what?  Likable?  Desirable?  Attractive?  The entire business was confusing.  It was giving him a stomachache.
I start with kissing.  There are times when we skip that, go straight to the quick and dirty, especially if we’re pressed for time or if our adrenaline is too high.  Sometimes we fuck, right there on the sitting room sofa.  Sometimes he bends me over the counter; sometimes he drops to his knees.  But that’s not what we need right now, not after this case.  Affection, yes.  Fondness, always.
“Not unless you consider aromatherapy and hot stone massage menacing.”
In which John is surprised, Sherlock discovers that he needs more data, and Molly reveals a secret.  The plot begins properly.
John looks at the ground; he’s emotional.  They’re both out of practice; the familiar easiness they once had seems just out of reach.  It’s worth striving for.
Just then Sally’s phone rang; she looked at it and excused herself for a moment, heading outside to talk.
“Oh hush, Sam,” chided Joyce.  “Love is love.  I’m proud that old bed saw some real action.  Whoever it was, I hope they come back and enjoy themselves.  As for mysteries, though, I’m fine with Willow Cross remaining famous for nothing more scandalous than our spa and service.”
?” he asked incredulously.
He changed in a newly renovated cubicle and dived in, swimming lengths until he felt his shoulder loosen.  Then he floated on his back and spent some time enjoying the feeling of weightlessness before he realised he was hungry.  He climbed out, towelled off.  He’d need another shower to wash off the chlorine, but he didn’t feel like getting dressed again.  Mrs. Hudson was out with friends anyway, so he figured it was safe to saunter back to his room in just his swimwear.
Sherlock cleared his throat.  “Goodnight, John,” he said formally, and walked down the hall. John watched him go, the strange feeling still there, pooling in his gut.
masculine feature that sends John right round the bend.  He loves to pet the kinky hairs with his thumb, slick them to Sherlock’s skin with his tongue.  He loves the texture as he slides his own cock between Sherlock’s cheeks, love to coat the entire cleft with his come and then swipe his fingers through the mess.
he mouthed.
Sherlock kissed his shoulder. “Understood.  What about private data?”
Sherlock looked at John, really looked at him, and for the first time John could see something more there, something beyond the genius, behind the precise logic: Sherlock had loved his father.  Maybe not in the same way that most young boys do (John surely had enough residual anger and resentment toward his own), but he had loved him.  And more than that, he was convinced, without a doubt, that his father had been murdered.  John was fully inclined to believe him.
A few flowering trees broke into blossom, and hyacinths, tulips, daffodils and crocuses stretched themselves toward the sun, which was slowly but surely warming the earth.  John no longer needed the heavy duvet at night, the countryside finally throwing off its nightly blanket of frost.  Things were almost settling into a routine, for which John was appreciative.
John had been occasionally dragged to antique shops by his aunt as a child, and he’d hated their musty smell: a combination of cat urine and mould spores.  To his child’s eye, everything had been useless and boring.  Now, as an adult, John found he liked ducking into Mr. Chapman’s.  It didn’t have that particular odour, either; instead it smelled of old books, like brittle paper or wool, lemon polish, and glass cleaner.  John found the owner himself interesting: having lived in Burnett Thwaite his whole life, Mr. Chapman knew just about everything about the village and the people who lived there.  He opened his shop three days a week and habitually wore a bow tie and cardigan combination of which John wholeheartedly approved.
“Yeah.  Doesn’t look like much now, though.”  Lestrade shrugged and pushed his cap back with his forearm.  His silver hair fell over his forehead from underneath.  “I like it.  Good, honest hard work.  Quiet, too. Well, I should probably show you the garage while we’re right here.  Got a motorbike you’re welcome to.  And a real bicycle, too, if you want.”
“But even if we do survive, how will we cope? I’ll never find another manager like Lillian.”
“You can’t force him to stay.”
“John did most of it,” said Sherlock.
“You should ask your questions,” he replied.  “I haven’t kept anything from you, John.  I just...lack certain graces of conversation.”
“Do you do anything else besides amateur sleuthing?”
Right, then.  The human body: weigh it, test it, catalogue it, diagnose it, heal it, soothe it.
“Close your eyes,” said John, as he teased the tip of his lover’s cock with the opening of the muff.  “But I want you to do it,” John whispered from in front of him.  “So I can watch.”
He put on his trainers and dug his torch out of the wardrobe.  Quietly he slipped from his room and took the north staircase to the upper level of the house.  He’d been upstairs since the initial screaming incident, mainly to use the library.  The west wing’s rooms were former servant’s quarters, and had been redesigned to sleep two.  He turned the knob completely before opening each door, trying to be as stealthy as he could.  Once he made sure the coast was clear, he went on to the next.  He made his way methodically down the corridor, finding and hearing nothing aside from the occasional gust of wind.
“Hot.”
John was reading an article about special teas brewed for relaxation when he received an e-mail from Lestrade:
Agatha Christie.  He chewed his steak instead.
“Indeed.  Thank you.”  Sherlock yawned again; John echoed it.
“You’re sitting on the patio.  In your wet underpants.”
Mrs. Hudson’s face went from frustrated to alarmed.  “Oh, John, no.”
http://harewood.org/
Sherlock stares at him.  A what?  Poppy seed.  He reaches past his science references. Wasn’t there some Shakespeare play with a Poppyseed?  With the fairies?  Does he think I have a fairy?  Does he think I am a fairy?  No, it wasn’t a poppy seed, something else, sunflower or pumpkin or sesame or mustard.  Wasn’t there that one movie with the green lady and the fabulous red shiny shoes and some sort of flying primate and a man who controlled everything who was disappointing in person, (a bit like Mycroft)…there were poppies in that, weren’t there?  It was deleted long ago.  Was there kissing in that film?
“My childhood is unimportant and irrelevant.  I have very few prior relationships that I want to discuss because they are not pleasant to recall.  And you already know my hopes, dreams, and fears.”

“To the tuba, you idiot.”  A recording of Sherlock’s self-composed wedding song plays on the computer.
Mycroft shrugged and took off his suit jacket, draping it over a chair.
“Look.  We’ll get dressed and go back to the suite.  I’ve got something to show you from Lillian’s room, anyhow.  She’s made a fucking
John collected his thoughts, stepped into physician mode, put own a pair of gloves, and began to examine the body in earnest.  “Male, twenty-five to thirty, physically fit, more so on the upper body than the lower…maybe an athlete…a gymnast?  Not a body builder, though.  Calluses on the palms – wait.  No, never mind.”  He paused, looking at the very bare skin of the victim’s chest before lifting an arm and examining the naked armpit, looking for clues.  Nothing obvious.
Yet then, no.  Not a god.  A human after all.  A real human being with emotions.
“I highly doubt someone would expire simply from depilation, John,” said Sherlock dryly.  “Tell me what you see.”
“You’re supposed to say thank you,” prompted John.
Eventually the subtle aftershocks of his orgasm began to fade.  Oddly enough, the weird feeling on his chest wasn’t waning, and neither was a strange sensation on his cock.  Intense orgasm, indeed.
Sherlock sighed and looked contrite.  “I’m rehabilitated.”
“You like horses? I love them!” exclaimed Lestrade, much to Sherlock and John’s surprise. “My uncle used to own a riding school, and we’d spend the summer holidays exercising the ponies. No dressage though. Bit public school, that.”
John sighed, pulled off and unzipped his backpack, and handed one over.  Sherlock shrugged out of his jacket, rolled up his sleeve, and slapped it on.  They sat there in silence, the leaves rustling overhead as the breeze blew.  John tossed down a few more pebbles and was considering getting up to keep exploring when Sherlock started talking.
Peering around the kitchen wall, John looks at his flatmate.  Sherlock’s just finished “Silent Night” and is still cradling the instrument: a big, physical barrier between him and the rest of the guests.
“I saw you outside today,” said Sherlock at length.  “With Lestrade.”  He dragged the name out comically.
“Thank you,” he said, because he could find nothing else to say.  Sherlock nudged a bit closer, pressing his naked body into John’s.  John trailed his free arm down the lines of Sherlock’s bicep, over the sinews of his forearm, and linked their hands together.  Sherlock’s hand was so much larger than his own, another reminder that his lover was, indeed, a man.  A man with smooth skin, morning stubble, an adam’s apple, hair under his arms, large eyebrows, and a really lovely penis.  Inside that man was an incredibly brilliant brain and, somewhere in there, a heart, a heart that now beat in time with his own.
“Good for you.  Shit.  Five? Really?  I’ll look like someone’s damn grandfather at forty-six.”
John hesitated.  He really didn’t feel like explaining things to Mrs. Hudson, and he hadn’t thought of a good enough story.  He was a horrible liar.  “I’d really not bother Mrs. Hudson,” he said cautiously.
Sherlock, on principle, does not succumb to embarrassment.  He learned to quash that feeling years ago, letting ridicule flow over him, through him.  But ever since John has entered his life, the emotion has reared its ugly head once more.  Sherlock remembers the first time it returned, too, as the drugs squad picked their way through his flat looking for cocaine (he honestly hadn’t had any at the time), an incredulous John looking on, already defending his honour.  It took him a full three minutes to identify the sensation: embarrassment, shame, feeling foolish and small.  John would be so disappointed.  For the first time in nearly two decades, Sherlock realised that he cared very much about what his flatmate through about him.  It should have been obvious, but it took a full six months before Sherlock finally identified
for Sherlock, but it came as naturally to John as breathing.  His body would betray him, override his head and heart and then there would either be mind-blowing sex or Sherlock would retreat deep into his head and the man John had grown to love would be lost to him forever.
“Drafty.”
“I don’t know.  Perhaps.”
“Because I can.”
He delivered the line so deadpan that John choked on his own saliva before laughing.  “Did you just make a sex joke?” he stammered.
John doesn’t usually wear aftershave.  He used to, when he was dating the most boring women on the planet.  He grew wary of all smelly products for awhile, and had an aversion to any woman wearing distinctive perfume.  He ditched the Tom Ford
“What we really need is for her to perform it on one of us.”
“I don’t know.”  Sherlock grew contemplative and went to stand in front of the windows.  John let Sherlock take a moment for himself before he joined him.
John grumbled about how many clothes Sherlock actually owned.  It turned out he had three times the amount he’d kept at Holmes Hall; at least a dozen perfectly tailored designer suits, twenty or so formal shirts in shades that complimented his skin and eyes, and at least three silk dressing gowns that John had found so far.  He was afraid he was going to have to move most of his clothing to the two rooms upstairs.  Either that, or the three unpacked boxes full of “clothing to be used for disguise” were going to have to be relocated.
Joyce finished a stack of napkins, patted her lap, and stood up.  “Well, ladies, I’m off.  Got a grandson to babysit tonight.  Don’t worry, Navya.  This whole mess, well, you’ll see.  It will all come out in the wash.”
Sherlock Holmes, who, apparently, knew how to fold himself into a chair, backward, on top of his lover.
, John thought sadly.
…”  The last word gusted out from between his lips as Sherlock moved again.  “It’s all slippery, love.  It looks...wet...it looks like a video and feels like...Heaven.  Fuck, Sherlock.”
They continued to move together, slowly, reverently, their breathing becoming harsh and urgent.
“Mine?”
“Mr. Chatterjee brought them,” Sherlock says.  “Awfully nice of him.”
He opens his arms.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock says.
“You’ve got plenty of time, Mr. Chapman,” said John, smiling.
“Where are you, John?”
“He…”
“Well…” said John, rocking back on his heels.
he thought as he tightened the CAT.  Now, something for the shock…
Sherlock smiled wryly and went back to his paper.
Once Lillian was in custody, John left to find Sherlock.  Sherlock’s phone was still in his pocket, and so he had no way of communicating with him.  John supposed he had returned to the room, and was pleased to see that indeed he had.  He was sitting in the chair by the window, shirtless, and staring at something out on the garden.  His back was an alarming shade of pink.  When he turned to John, he was clearly upset.
“The Holmes are a bit of a peculiar bunch, that’s for sure.”
Oh shit.  Here it came.
“Hhmm,” said Sherlock.  “You are fit.  Very fit.”
He was nearing the end of his shift when his mobile rang.  Between patients, he checked his voicemail.  It was Mrs. Hudson.  “Oh John,” she said in a trembling voice, “Come home as soon as you can.  They’ve had a horrible row.  Sherlock’s locked himself in his room and refuses to speak to anyone.  Anyone, that is, except you.”
Below there was a small tin box, no bigger than a cigarette packet.  At one time it must have been painted with what looked like a Parisian scene, but most of the paint had worn off, and it was caked with rust.  The box opened with little effort, however, and inside were two keys.  One was of the old, brass skeleton variety, and the other, a modern mortice.  John knelt there, his gun and birds on the bench nearly forgotten.  He knew, without a doubt, that he was holding the keys to the locked garden.
“Don’t care,” Sherlock said back, nipping in for another kiss that would have continued had Sherlock’s mobile not buzzed from where it sat next to his rapidly cooling tea.
“Please leave.”
“I do
“This is the main pool, kept at 28 degrees for comfort but not too warm for swimming.  It took nearly a year to lay the tiles,” she added, indicating the millions of tiny turquoise glass squares.  “The lions” - lion heads were carved into the pillars and water spouted from their mouths - “are in homage to Harold Leybourne’s, the founder of the estate, coat-of-arms.  His great-grandson owns it now.”  John had seen the coat-of-arms and the founder’s portrait in the Hall’s main entry, followed by formal portraits of the Leybourne patriarchs up until the current owner, Phillip Leybourne, who’d clearly inherited Harold’s weak chin and short legs, too.
“Yes you do.  It’s why you make me say it four times before you acknowledge that I’m speaking to you.”
about him and what was so amusing about bodily functions anyway and why was John’s arse so perfect even if he did pass gas as he dozed on the sofa?  Why was he even looking?  Stupid betraying brain!
“Changed a bit from our day,” he said to Mike as he perused the equipment.
He could hear  Sherlock no doubt saying something brilliant, slipping on someone else’s persona as easily as his coat.  It was unnerving - the man could have made a career of acting.  The problem was, whenever Sherlock actually got when he was after, he discarded the act immediately, and that was when the problems usually began.
?” he retorted.  “Fear of rejection, I suppose.  Afraid of fucking it all up.”
“Oh, John, that’s...rather lovely.”
him.  He is my home; he is my master.
The second day of strange found John back at work, called in on his day off.  He got a call from Mrs. Hudson around the lunch hour, wondering if there was special occasion she ought to know about because Sherlock had gone out and come home with all sorts of “exotic green things” and she thought he might be making lime tarts.  John assured her he was
John couldn’t sleep.  He hadn’t heard any screaming in the night since the initial incident, but his intuition told him that he wasn’t the only lodger in the house.  Mrs. Hudson was cooking more than necessary and appeared worried.  Molly was even more on edge.  Even Lestrade, who was becoming less of an acquaintance and more of a friend, seemed on guard.
“Consulting detective,” he said as he shut the door behind him, emphasizing the modifier and raising his eyebrows.
“Have you now?”  John doesn’t know exactly what that means, but it sounds suggestive.  He’s perfected his tonguing techniques too, but Sherlock probably doesn’t want to know about that.
“And you should see yourself.”  Lestrade shook his head.  “You are practically besotted, John Watson.  The sooner the two of you two pull your heads from your arses, the better, I say.”
John laughed.  Of course.  “That sounds like some rubbish you picked up in
“I was going to suggest going inside for a drink.  Maybe we should talk about this.”
John took a deep breath to slow down his racing heart.  “They’ve got...bugs…” he said.
John squeezed his buttocks together and grit his teeth.  “Yeah.  Won’t be a mo’.”
Two chairs, two men.  One hearth, one home.
Without second thought, John was off, Donovan at his side, weaving in and out of sweaty, colourful bodies.  A haze still hung in the air, making it harder to see.  John lost sight of Sherlock but kept pace with Donovan, who was quickly going to outpace him.
“Then why are you trying to take the hair off it?  You’re not even hairy!”  John stepped back and did a clinical observation.  He had played scenarios of getting Sherlock naked so many times in his mind - this was not one of them, and it was
It wasn’t long before their bodies simply couldn’t wait - a slow rhythm of rocking hips at first became a gentle but steady thrusting.  John felt sweat form on his brow.
“Oh, I
“How’s your grandmother?” he asked as they rested.
Eventually the laughs trail off into sniggers and then into something else entirely, something raw, too intense.  John lifts his head from where it’s buried in his arms and sees Sherlock gasping.  He’s thrown his arm over his eyes and there, running down his cheeks, are tears.
“My very own species.
“Why is it so important?” He didn’t look away from the microscope, which was lighting up his eyes (pale, prone to early cataracts, John thought, inability to make eye contact, emotional discomfort).  “Sex.  Nudity.  Bodies touching.”  He paused.  “You’re the doctor.  Biology?”
Sherlock opened the windows to let in the night breeze, and they climbed back into Sherlock’s big bed.  Sherlock rolled to his side and drew John’s arms around him.
John shut his mouth with a click.
There were several rows of slides set up to the right of the scope.  They were labelled, but from his perch John couldn’t read them.
“You look like shit,” John muses.
“There’s one in my mind that’s going to need immediate attention.”
He hit the “send” button and heard Sherlock’s phone and computer bleep simultaneously, but Sherlock gave no indication that he had even noticed.
“Someone up front said she was the only one who did that particular massage.”
“Navya!”  Sam marched out of the laundry room holding a sheet by her thumb and forefinger.  It trailed behind her like a soiled wedding veil.  “Who the fook was in the honeymoon suite this weekend?”
“...but I wouldn’t know because I’m the great Sherlock Holmes and my body is merely transport for my glorious brain...”
“Why not start small, then?  Maybe a blog.  And you could just write a little something every day.”
“No,” replied Mycroft.
“But you could do it.  I don’t imagine Miles Donovan had a flower press handy.”
This time the thrusting was accompanied by sharp teeth at his throat.  Bloody hell.
actually help untangle the threads of reasoning in the detective’s great brain during a complicated case.  Who’d have guessed?) things were going rather well between the two of them.
“Do you always repeat yourself?  Yes, my roses.  When I was ten I created my own hybrid tea rose.  Don’t repeat what I just said.”
John went to work, came home, ate a cold supper.  Sherlock did not come back.
me.  If anything, he has made me
“Don’t let me forget.”
They took a taxi back to Baker Street.  “She was really good,” said John.  He tapped the programme against his leg.  “Really good.”  Then, “You are, too, you know.”
“May I leave it open?”
“I love the way you feel in my hand,” Sherlock murmured into his ear.
Sherlock’s version of a funeral dirge is to simply play a series of long, mournful-sounding notes repeatedly.  He does it again, and again, and again, occasionally stopping to make a notation on his composition papers.  It goes on for three days and John doesn’t know what to do.  He hates Irene Adler for breaking Sherlock’s heart, or whatever she did to him.
“Now, John, I do believe you have a train to catch?  You mustn't be late.”  Mycroft said pointedly.
“These power cords are tricky to insert.  The scuff marks indicate that whoever owned the phone routinely struggled to connect it.  I’d expect to see these marks on an older person’s device, or on someone who has a neurological disorder that causes tremors, like Parkinson’s, for example.  I’m assuming that your brother is no more than six years older than you are based on birth rates from the 1970s, if I am estimating your age correctly -- you’re prematurely greying, am I correct?  So, if your brother is between forty and forty-five, I’m going to assume that he is of good health and that the shaking is caused by a more common affliction: drunkenness.You must not get on well or you’d be living with him while you reorient yourself back into civilian life.  A quick glance at your history shows you don’t know how to use half of the apps on the phone, indicating you haven’t been home long enough to figure out how they work, or you’re a bit of a Luddite who couldn’t care less about the weather forecast or how well your shares are doing.  There are no games; you don’t waste your time.  And you’ve only made twenty or so calls since you acquired it.  Half of those were from your brother, and half of those you didn’t answer: my guess is that you didn’t miss the calls, but rather you ignored them.   Ergo, you don’t get on.”
“Why?” Sherlock says to the offending thing, and for the life of him, John can’t figure out a proper reply.  Why indeed?  Why are there lollies?  Why did someone decide long ago to affix a sugary circle of confectionery to a stick?  Is it phallic?  What’s wrong with simply popping a boiled sweet into one’s mouth?  Is that Sherlock’s lolly?  Does he even like lollies?  Why green?  He likes purple ones, honestly.  That fake lime flavouring is horrible.  But the blackcurrant.  The blackcurrant is good.  It tastes like purple.  Purple is good.
Blur.
Something in the tone made him turn around to see Sherlock sitting on the bed, looking a right mess.  Any resolve John had managed to muster quickly dissolved.
Mr. Chapman waved and propped the broom up beside the front door.
Wishing for his pistol, John got out of bed and wrapped his dressing gown around him, grabbed the fireplace poker, and carefully opened the heavy oak door of his room.  The corridor was long and dark.  Tall ceilings loomed above him. The spike of adrenaline, however, was unexpectedly welcome.  He listened; there was the noise again.  Not from this corridor, no, but maybe from the floor above him?  Sweat prickled under his arms despite the chill in the air.  He hoisted the heavy poker with thankfully little protest from his shoulder.
“It’s my rudder.”
Greg looked skeptical.
put the pieces together.  He began to mentally categorise all the details of the case so far:
John smiled and tried not to cry.  “Mrs. Hudson made the dinner, Sherlock,” he said jokingly.
John held out the keys.  “For you, I think.”
“The boyfriend?” queried Sherlock.
“I want to know you,” Sherlock whispered as he kissed his way back up John’s body.  “Learn you.”
John’s hands were not as large as Sherlock’s, but they, too, were finely-boned and capable of great precision.  Within minutes Sherlock’s thighs were trembling.
“Interested?”
area.”
“It’s an appropriate adjective for him.  He was a bitter man.  From what I could tell he was one of those people who always thought the world was against him.  He hated the country life.  Sally’s mother, Gloria, was powerless to curb his drinking.  I think she took her fair share of physical abuse.  Sally hated being at home.  We met at the library.  I was sitting at a table and she came right up and sat next to me, bold as could be.”  He smiled at the memory.
), finally stopped screaming and died.
“Oh, mine, too.”  Sherlock agreed warmly, and John found himself snorting into his wine glass.
.   Sherlock sees red.  “Don’t be scared,” drawls Moriarty as he saunters toward the door.  “Falling’s just like flying….”  He leaves, probably thinking he’s said something clever, but Sherlock has stopped paying attention.  There’s an apple in his tuba.
“What about ‘learn from the past’ and all that?”
“Mmm.  Not today,” John said, extracting his finger and giving the soft hairs of Sherlock’s cleft a bit of a pet.  “Umph.  Up.  Can’t breathe.”
“Really?”
“Not true.  I speak to you even when you’re not there.”
“No.”
A Memorable Wank
-- oh God.
John nearly spit out his tea.  “Crime?  That’s rather ironic.”
There’s a funny feeling coiling in his guts: anticipation?  Nerves?
He felt Sherlock’s slender fingers dipping between his cheeks, petting the soft hairs, gently rubbing over the sensitive pucker of his anus.  Sherlock had slotted himself behind John’s body and was gently mouthing at the small of his back, running his other hand over John’s front, caressing his abdomen, occasionally reaching down to his cock and balls.
John sighed.  “Yes.  I guess I do.”  It came out a bit louder than necessary.
“For much longer time if it weren’t for him.  Genius!  Such a great man.  Whatever you want, it’s on the house.  For you and your date.”
“Would you like to play my tuba?” Sherlock asks one evening when they can’t seem to find anything better to do and John has decided that he would rather help Sherlock stab pigs with harpoons than attempt Cluedo again.
“Jesus.”
.  They’d come so far already together.  Less than a year ago John was a broken man, empty and directionless. Sherlock was much the same, waging a war against himself.  They were complicated men, men with idiosyncrasies and demons, men who weren’t particularly skilled at handling emotions or playing by the rules.  But they were men who brought out the best in each other, who would find a way to make something beautiful together.
John masturbates nearly every other day, which he knows is normal enough (more if he’s had a crap week at the surgery) and definitely a healthier way of relieving stress than drinking. Tonight, though.  Tonight was a disaster.  He might need a wank
John took a deep breath through his nose and let it out through his mouth.  His lover was nothing if unpredictable, and John loved that about him, but if Sherlock was going to lose interest in the current proceedings and take a shining to studying scrotums of all types for the next week - well, that simply wouldn’t do.  Not after all that talk about vanilla and the fellatio and the thing with the fingernails…
He awoke in the morning with another erection -- and a bit stuck to his sheets.  John ran himself a bath and spent a good hour getting to know himself again.  He delighted in all of the sensations he’d forgotten he loved: palming his balls, gently manipulating his foreskin, thumbing the frenulum, watching the glans poke out of the circle of his fingers as he thrust into his hand.  Firm strokes and soft caresses, pressure on the perineum, a fingertip fluttering against and then just inside the anus.  He savoured the building pressure, the tightening in his pelvis, the way his legs shook and his buttocks clenched as he grew closer to release.  He thought of nothing and no one, simply enjoying the sensations, remembering how much he could enjoy pleasuring himself.
“Mrs. Hudson sent you.”
“No. You? Nav?”
going to use me as some experiment in hair removal.  Nope.
John shoots him an incredulous look.  “The tuba can’t possibly be more challenging than the violin.”
John took a deep breath, then released it.  “I’ve been in the garden.  The locked one.”
for a while.  Sometimes they talked for hours; other times, they just sat together in Regent’s Park, doing nothing in particular except existing side-by-side.
“Did she text you?  She did, didn’t she?”
, completely relieved.  She looked like a drug addict.”  John glanced at Sherlock, who was picking lint off his trousers.
“OK.”
Part Deux
I purchased them,” Sherlock smirked deviously.
, somehow.  Using his fingers seemed to be too medical to start, and he still had Sherlock’s taste on his tongue.  Sherlock had told him earlier that he was brave.  Might as well prove it.  “Here,” he said, sliding off the bed and trying to pull Sherlock’s lower half with him.  “Put yourself - here.  Yes.”
Owens raised his eyebrows, nodded an affirmation, and took a drink.
“He said you’ve had some difficulties at other universities?”
illustrated with gorgeous photography.  It’d ended up in the room of a girl he’d been regularly studying (and having casual sex) with.  They drank several pints, tried several poses, and gave it all up in favour of their old standby (her-on-top).  The images had stayed with him long after the girl had: bodies purposefully posed for pleasure, but also for aesthetics.  A still picture was just as arousing to him as a video.  An intimate moment, frozen forever.
“Look, are you sure you want to get rid of these?”
In which Mycroft makes an appearance, Sherlock makes a confession, and John finds himself in exceptionally good spirits.
Sherlock bent his head around to shoot John a look of exasperation and annoyance.  “John, I am asking as politely as I possibly can in my current state of arousal to kindly put your fucking dick in my arse and get on with it.”
John can’t argue with that.
“You OK?” asked John, kissing the damp skin between Sherlock’s shoulder blades.
Sherlock froze.  A dozen expressions crossed his face (surprise, curiosity, fear, betrayal) before settling on blank indifference.
“...and how to make it stop.”
about breaking and entering, and something about being wrong with Sherlock felt decidedly right.  It was a conflicted and wonderful feeling, and John savoured every moment of it, every time.
“No.”
Exhale.
“No.”
Thuckata-thuckata-thuckata
“That’s it,” John said, dropping his fishing rod and pulling off his shirt.  “I’m going in after it.”
“I’m not a babysitter,” said John, crossing his arms.  “But I really am a doctor.  How bad is it?”
John twisted his head around to meet Sherlock for a messy kiss before grinding back against Sherlock once more, feeling his pleasure crest.  The coil of tension in his groin released, his full testicles spurting forth into their joined hands, his legs shaking, arse clenching.
The heat finally broke the next day in the form of a torrential rainstorm.  Great sheets of it came sweeping across the moors, and John fell asleep listening to it pelt against his windows.  In the morning, the gusts of wind grew strong enough to break small branches off the trees, and John was thankful he didn’t have to go to work in such dreadful weather.
Sherlock shuddered.  “Oh, fuck,” he breathed.
“I see that you had an interesting evening last night.  How is your head?”
“And I’m not dead.”  His voice sounded hollow, disconnected.  He made himself focus.  His vitals looked normal on the monitor.  Nope.  Not dead.  Alive.  He closed his eyes again.
Caffeine buzzed merrily in his veins, chasing away the vestiges of his earlier panic attack. Maybe he could get a walk in later, get out into the fresh air and just exist for a while.
“So good,” Sherlock mumbled as he thrust his hips into John’s hands.  “More.”  John wasn’t exactly sure what “more” meant - that was one of the beautiful things about a new lover: learning each other, each other’s bodies, preferences, when to do what depending on the mood. His body was at war with itself - part of him wanted to get right down there and reciprocate Sherlock’s earlier blowjob; another part of him wanted to sink himself deep, sheath himself to the hilt and rut.  Sherlock decided it for him.
“Yeah.  It’s her brainchild.  She’s actually studied in China and knows much more about the traditional practices and their philosophies than the rest of us do.  ‘The Fountain of Youth’ keeps her in high demand, and she’s paid a fortune,  but everyone’s so pleased with how she’s turned this place around in the past few years that we don’t really care.  Rumor has it that she’s got a boyfriend, but with all the hours she works, I can’t see how she’s got the time.  Now,” he said with a smile, “You’d better go and chase after your friend.”
, John told himself.  It would take time.
Our resting heart rates are not the same.  My blood pressure is naturally lower than his is.  Try as I may, I can never get our heartbeats to match up.
“That’s your best shirt.”
But yet…
“I don’t know.  I don’t think so.”
“Yes.  You know where to find him.”
Mycroft ignored the comment and continued.  “Our mother refused to listen to Sherlock then.  She was mad with grief and frustrated at Sherlock’s apparent lack of it.  She never said so, but of course she blamed him for what happened.  I did too, for a time.  Altruism isn’t one of Sherlock’s more salient personality traits.  It wouldn’t have taken much for him to pull himself away for half an hour to hold a ladder.”
They’ve met in a park; neutral ground.  The baby is sleeping in her pram.  She’s nine months old now and has already seen her fair share of vice and crime.  It’s too dangerous, and they both know it.  As it turns out, Mary is a fairly decent mother; John can’t begrudge her for that.
...there.
“To many more,” Sherlock smiled.  There was a twinkle in his eye, something soft and lovely, and John couldn’t help but fall in love just a little more.
John looked at Sherlock, whose eyebrows had come together.  What was that mind palace of his really like?  John supposed it was fantastic and absurd, with nothing where it was supposed to be.  Sherlock probably kept sexual fantasies in the freezer and bludgeonings in the bathroom cupboard.  Lestrade, Molly, Mrs. Hudson, and even Mycroft had all hinted at Sherlock’s ambivalence about (and even disdain for) sex, but Sherlock, as John had discovered, did have a libido.  Granted, that libido was irregular and just as unpredictable as the man himself: there were days Sherlock was simply content to bring John off and then share a cuddle without achieving his own orgasm; and then there were other times that he was downright horny, nearly throwing himself at John and whispering all sorts of dirty things (
them.”  He paused, an idea surfacing.  “Hey, why don’t you show me all of the rooms?  Give me one final tour.”
“For you?  £300.”
He binned it.
“I’m so sorry, Sergeant Donovan,” said John.
Sherlock frowned and gathered an armful of textbooks.  “It wasn’t like that.  My parents, for all the money, were exceedingly
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t think I’d mind now.”
There was something something honest in his voice.  It wasn’t enough to overpower John’s distrust of the man, but it did humanise him.  John took off his coat and hung it on the peg but didn’t sit.  The sooner Mycroft left, the better.  “You want me to treat him, then?  As a patient?”
“Anyway, I lost everything.  I sold our place in Miami and came back to England.  I stayed with my sister for a week before Sherlock rang me.  He told me his mum and dad needed a housekeeper and I was the perfect fit.  So here I am.  It was hard, though, losing Archie so quickly after I started.  And Lilly -- well, she suffered.  They all did.”
Canolacrush did a smash-up beta job, and Bettyswallocks, as usual, is my go-to girl for everything British.
John was investigating an ancient-looking hunting horn that hung on the wall for decoration, when he heard the distinct click of heels behind him.
Sherlock rolled them both onto their sides and pulled out.  John winced (that never seemed incredibly pleasant) and stretched.  What was up with his skin?  A hot shower was definitely in order, or he would be sore tomorrow.  To his left, Sherlock was tugging at something.
stood at ease, resumed full military alert.
“That detective, Sherlock Holmes,” continued Sam as she twisted the top of the bag containing the offending sheets closed, “was here the whole time and you didn’t tell anyone!  First a murder investigation, now a gay sex orgy.”
“Wait.  Have you read mine?” John asked.  Sherlock didn’t even bother dignifying the question with an answer.
“I had no idea it was so
“Can you at least stay in London?”
He had an quiet and rather awkward dinner with his sister, who was adamant that he wasn’t “ready” to work again.  Disregarding her concern and promising he’d be fine, he packed his bag, and in the morning, headed to the train station.
“Indeed.”
“So they were at the house then.”
“He says it’s like nothing else he’s ever experienced, euphoric even, which is why he’s so keen for me to investigate.  He says there’s a waiting list.  Something’s not right.”
John looked up to see Sherlock run a hand through his hair - a gesture of exasperation.  “You’re always embarrassed when we share a room.”
“Who?” John asked.
With a sigh, John hauled himself up, dusted his knees, and left the garden, carefully shutting and locking the door behind him and sneaking out from the curtain of ivy.
They were people my mother knew from university, mathy-type academics.  She blended in well, finally in her element again, while my father made friendly conversation with other spouses who weren’t quite as brilliant as their mates.  I hated events like those, even if they were far and few between.  Anything that honoured my brother was awful by nature.  However, it did give me an opportunity to observe.  There was a woman there in a black beaded dress who held champagne in one hand and slurped down oysters on the half shell in the other.  She ate three in a row.  Must have been indulging, I mused.  Oysters must not be a luxury she had often but had obviously acquired a taste for them somewhere.  Mycroft, the lardarse, was holding court close to the dessert table, so I, on principle, avoided the entire area, even though I wanted nothing more than one of those little chocolate squares with the raspberries on top.  The woman in the beaded dress took the arm of a man too old for her and disappeared into the crowd.
“Touchy subject,” murmured John.
.  Quiet.  Peaceful.  Maybe he was dead, after all.
“I also love your testicles,” Sherlock murmured.  “They are very nice.”
“It’s recommended to always wear tight underwear in hot climates, mind you.  Prevents chafing.  And sand.”  He pauses there.  Sherlock’s mouth nearly waters.
“Hair, John.  Armpits.  Legs.  Groin.  Does that bother you?”
John went to work again, came home, didn’t feel like eating, and still Sherlock did not come back.
“I am not!”
Who knows what he told the young woman at reception, but he was apparently ushered behind the black velvet curtain that partially concealed the salon proper from the waiting area.  John could see black leather reclining chairs and lights reflected off of mirrors beyond.  The whole place had a modern vibe, catering to London’s twentisomething mediafolk; bamboo flooring, exposed ceiling beams, simple yet posh decor.  Several framed articles hung on the wall, proclaiming the salon’s accolades from women’s magazines.  A flat screen television the size of a small sofa showed slides of supposedly stylish cuts and colors.  Somewhere above him, satellite radio filtered through the sounds of blow dryers and women’s idle chatter.
The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees,
“Oh,” said John.  “I think there’s two.”
He remembers the days when Sherlock used to narrow his eyes and scan him like a laser, deducing everything about his day and current mood from wrinkled clothing and the length of his hair.  Either Sherlock’s got better at deducing on the sly, or he’s purposefully given John a bit of privacy.  Some things, however, just can’t be hidden: a row with his daughter is like a siren to Sherlock.  Maybe his flat is still bugged, after all.
She smiled.  “I’d love one.”
Sherlock worried his lip.  “It would appear,” he said, “that you are having a mild allergic reaction.  I didn’t know you were allergic to chinchilla.”
. It’s meant to generate clients.”
to me.”
“Meth-adone,” John sang back.  “Have you stopped vomiting yet?”
When John returned, Sherlock was pushing a stack of boxes out of the way just enough so they could get to the bed.
John watched Sherlock process.  “An empathogen, then.”
The sun was high overhead and the garden was warm, its own self-contained little oven.  Bees lumbered around from flower to flower, their little legs laden with pollen.  John wondered if they were from Mr. Campbell’s hives, if for years they had remembered this secret spot, had flown over its walls to harvest its bounties long after tragedy had closed its door to the people who had loved it most.
One of the movers added another box --one marked
“I want to be in you,” he murmured against John’s lips.  “Please.  Let me be in you.”
was affected by it, like each of his hair follicles was coming, too.  Well, maybe not coming, but twitching, or...something.  It was hard to pinpoint when every part of him seemed to be spasming in pleasure.  Fuck-ing hell.
It’s a delicate thing, trying to navigate a friendship into the murky waters of romantic relationship.  Sherlock has never been especially good at the former, and those of the latter sort were few and ended disastrously.  There was, too, the question of whether John would be receptive toward Sherlock’s advances.  He was, after all, repressing his own bisexuality (and failing, Sherlock thought, reminding himself of the seven times John had licked his own lips today, touched Sherlock’s arm, twice, when he hadn’t needed to, and, for the lack of a better term, “made eyes” at him over the body of an armless corpse).
“Sherlock Holmes!”  came a familiar voice through the door.  “I trust you’ve had an eventful evening.  Now get dressed before I come in and collect you.”
“I apologise.  I’ll have this sorted out in a moment,” he said sourly.
Sherlock shook his head.  “The apologies are mine.  I over-reacted.  It was a foolish emotional response that I should have been able to control.”
Later, Sherlock phoned Henry Gant.
They parked the bike in Lestrade’s garage and walked back to the house. It had gone 10pm and the stars were out.  Not quite as brilliant as the night sky in the desert, but impressive nonetheless.  John found himself stopped somewhere between the garage and the house, looking up.
Sherlock looked up, raised an eyebrow.  “Secret meetings in a locked garden, John.  It’s a storybook fantasy come to life.”
.  While several of his former girlfriends weren’t afraid of a bit of backdoor play, it was usually John who was knocking on the door.  Not that he wasn’t up for it.  It was pleasant, but in an extraneous kind of way.  A teasing fingertip at the anus during a blowjob was like a spicy, exotic condiment on a very enjoyable dinner.  With Sherlock, though.  It wasn’t long into their sexual relationship when John realized that Sherlock
He cannot find words to describe the feeling, though, and finds this vexing.   What exactly are they to one another?  He doesn’t know.  It warrants thought.
“I do know a thing or two about plants, John,” she teased.  “I didn’t know you were interested.”
“How could you possibly know that?  And no, I don’t.  It’s bad enough as it is.  I’m not an old man.”
Instead of answering, she gets up and hugs him.  “I’d like you to see the cottage,” he says into her hair.
“Are you a ghost?” he asked.
“In me, yeah?” he whispers.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “I’m aware.  And I can control the transport.”
“It does indeed.  But my son, Robert, unfortunately has shown very little interest in taking over.  He decided to study chemistry instead and works for Pfizer, developing pills and potions.  Staying here was simply not exciting enough for him, I suppose.  I would hate to see this place leave our family.” He nodded to John, “Don’t put it in your report, but perhaps I’ll have to sell.”  He shook his head.  “What a shame that would be.”  He looked maudlin for a moment, then knocked back the rest of his drink.  “Well, boys, I’m off. Got to check on a poorly filly before I turn in.  Please do take advantage of everything we have to offer.  If there’s ever a mystery at Willow Cross, I’ll know who to call.”
“She was just running,” said another woman.  “Just crossed the line.  She was fine!”
Chapter 15: It Is Time
The spa at night had other-worldly feel.  During the day the pool area was flooded with light from rows of windows and skylights; those windows were now dark and rain-streaked.  The place was aglow from the lights from the large swimming pool, which sparkled like a sapphire in the middle of the huge room.  The wall sconces remained lit, but all overhead lighting was extinguished.  Shadows dwelt in every corner.  No quiet talking or relaxing music broke the quiet of place; the lions had ceased their endless spitting.   All was silent except the soft lapping of water.
Sherlock remains still.
“Did they say anything about it?”
“What?”  Sometimes John was positive Sherlock talked to the windows just to make himself harder to hear.  “Whose?”
John smiles.  “I’ll be fine, sweetie.”
“I know you’re not most people, but touch can be very healing.  I’ve seen coma patients respond to the touch of a loved one.”
Sherlock nodded, pressed his lips together.  It was a subject for another time.  “Let’s go.”
John sighed.  No.  No, it wasn’t.  He wanted to touch Sherlock; smooth his fingertips over Sherlock’s eyebrows, push his hair back from his temple, kiss the warm skin there.  Rub his back, trace the scars, press his lips to the freckles.  Give him solace.  Give him pleasure.  He wanted to feel the hairs on his legs and under his arms.  He wanted to rub the tip of his nose over Sherlock’s nipples and then gently nip at them with his teeth.  And most of all, he simply wanted to gather the man close, pull him in tight, and love him, love him, love him.
“I’ll never be able to sleep if I know you’re up here wallowing in your own filth.”
Then the doctor and the detective inspector had a good, long laugh at Sherlock’s expense.
“You mean Sherlock, that is?  Yes, that’s just the kind of thing he’d like.  Or would have liked, a long time ago.”
,” I clarify.  I nuzzle his neck, lick a bit.  My hand has strayed to his shorts, teasing him.
“Mycroft said he has no friends.”
Sherlock shrugged his shoulders.  An answer was not forthcoming.
Just being in the spa was so comforting that John found himself unable to think quite clearly.  The water looked so inviting and warm and comfortable...  Sherlock, on the other hand, was revelling in data.  John loved to watch him think; it was such a visible process.  For a while he had watched Lillian, who was too busy explaining to notice his scrutiny.  Then he turned his attention to the guests and the pools and the decor.
“It’s not a deal breaker,” sighs John.  It really isn’t.  Annoying, yes, but not irritating enough to make him go back to that sterile bedsit where the only thing of interest was his illegal firearm.  “Go on then.  Impress me.”
Whatever had been holding Sherlock together suddenly breaks, and for no reason, he begins to laugh.  He laughs for a solid minute, a little silly giggle that makes John laugh, and then they pause to catch their breaths, look at one another, at the stick, at each other again, and then Sherlock just loses the plot.  He laughs so hard he slides off the sofa and onto the floor, where he lies on his back and continues laughing, a completely uncontrollable avalanche of glee sends his diaphragm into spasms and he can’t stop.  It’s all very funny, thinks John.  Sherlock is funny.  Their lives are funny.  Hil-fucking-arious.  John slides off the couch, too, and they try to catch their breaths.
“I’m sure you’ll figure it out.”  He takes another bite of the apple, then with perfect aim, tosses it to the corner where Sherlock’s tuba becomes an impromptu rubbish bin.  It makes a loud
“Who?”
“If you’d like to be.  No one would refute it.”
Thanks always to Bettyswallocks.
John hadn’t noticed.  As usual.  “Ballet?”
John manoeuvred through a group of people, using his stature to his advantage, and came out right in front of the startled, blue-faced runner.  He pivoted to dodge him, then leapt over a small hedge.
“He’s making a horrible racket.”
“No!” interrupted Sherlock, his voice loud in the room.  “No.  I need you with me, here.  You’re not the most luminous of people, but you are an excellent conductor of light.”
How long they spent like that --  pressed together in the warm water, lips capturing and recapturing one another, tongues tasting, exploring, tangling, an intimate dance, breaking apart for air only to come back together again -- John would never know.  It could have been five minutes or an hour, but when it ended, their breath ragged and their hands roaming over backs and collarbones and biceps, John leaned his forehead against Sherlock’s and laughed gently.  His lips were swollen and his balls ached, and he had never been happier.
The statue of Theseus stood guard, sword drawn, in the centre of the fountain.  John followed the path around to the front, where John could see the hero in his full glory, the muscles of his chest and abdomen sculpted in bronze, his penis and bollocks unabashedly on display between muscled thighs.  John looked up at the hero of Athens, who blinked back at him, bronze lids opening and shutting slowly as if frozen from years of disuse.  The statue seemed to inhale, then lowered his sword arm, which had been raised to the sky, and pointed.  “Go,” he seemed to say.
he knew Sherlock’s hopes, dreams, and fears.  What did Sherlock hope for?  Cases.  Puzzles.  Things to figure out.  His dreams?  Who the hell knew.  He didn’t want fame or money.  As far as fears, John knew Sherlock was terrified of failure.  But beyond that?
“Sorry, I don’t have a lot of time,” said Sally when she breezed into the Pret a Manger nearest to Leeds station.  “I have to work tonight, but I wanted to touch base.”
“Not in the slightest,” said Dr. Fellows, smiling.  “You’re going to be just fine.  But,” she said, pulling up the chair to sit next to him,  “you’ve been under heavy sedation for a while.  You lost a lot of blood and the shoulder injury was complicated.  You were stabilised at Camp Bastion where you had your leg patched up.”
Human After All: He Digests
her business, the whole place seems to say.  This could be yours.  It is yours.  It’s always been yours.
It clicks.  “Tonight?”
“What does it look like?  Describe it to me.”
“No.  I would think it’s hardly necessary.”
.  I do hate a boring criminal.  So disappointing.”
She laughed at that, a genuine cackle.  “Unhappy?  Heavens, no.  They paid well and Lilly was lovely company.  It was hardly even a proper job.  I was only there a few days a week.  Lilly and Archie were very adept at cooking their own meals and tidying up after themselves, that sort of thing.  I did cook one or two meals a week, and I always helped Lilly if there were guests.  She was an excellent chef, although she truly despised it.  It’s a very large house, as you know, so I did a considerable amount of dusting and polishing.  That sort of thing.  Lilly and I even had tea together once a week before the children were born. None of that upstairs-downstairs stuff. ”
This part of the Secret Garden was my favorite as a child.  I loved the initial reaction of Mary to Colin, and Colin's interest in her.  Reworking that for this fic was really difficult.  Obviously John wouldn't hold Sherlock's hand and sing to him on the night he meets him, so I had to get creative.  I hope it meets your expectations.
“You’re crying,” he announces, concerned.
“Don’t be silly,” Sherlock scoffed.
For there, on the couch, his lover, impossible man that he was, was currently engaged in doing something untoward to...good God, what the fuck was that?
“I like them.”
“Well, yes.  I thought you would get a kick out of looking through all the outdated material.  There’s this as well.”  John pulled the jar of honey from his backpack.  “Mr. Chapman said you’d like it.”
“...so you hauled off and punched me.”
John was nodding off when Sherlock muttered something.
“Yes,” said John, laughing in spite of himself.  “Yes, she did.”
“Ooh, do tell,” said John conspiratorially.  “What is it this time?  Maggots?”
So, the estate that Winnicott Hall is based on is here:
Shit.  Jesus fucking shit.
John rubs his temple again before kicking the chair.  It skids across the linoleum and topples over.
“You just can’t fart in front of a woman, John.  Least of all Sally.  She’s…” he waved a hand in the air, looking for the right word.  “...Classy.  Can’t fart in front of a classy lady.  Gentleman’s rules.”
His eyebrows come together.  He hasn’t been out with a woman in ages.  Years.  Talk about trust issues -- after what happened with Sherlock’s sister, he could barely stomach a woman’s interested smile or raised eyebrow.  And then, finally, when he’d moved on from that, it just didn’t hold the same appeal as it once did.  He had Rosie to think about, after all.  He’s accepted celibacy, too, and the intense longings for physicality have dwindled.  She thinks he’s been dating her whole life?  Is his daughter on drugs?
those muscles and John’s vision nearly went white.
“So,” he continued in that deadly baritone of his, “if your sexual repertoire is limited to spectacular fellatio and penetrative sex that gave me cramp in my feet and rendered me incapable of composing complete sentences, I think the future of our sex life is more than acceptable.”  He scrunched his eyebrows together.  “And, at one point in time, John Watson, I do believe your tongue was in my arse.  Is that ‘vanilla’?”  Sherlock moved his hips against John’s side, erection already hot and leaking.  He leaned in further, lips on the shell of John’s ear where he whispered, “I think you should know that I
When his pension came in every month he took £50 and went to the Porter and Sorter, where he sat, alone, and drank pints of bitter until the money ran out.  Then he staggered home and justified his actions by telling himself it was only once a month, that he wasn’t like his sister, that he wasn’t an addict, that he had the right to get as pissed as he wanted to after losing both his career and his comrades-in-arms.
“Let me take your coat.”
He might have, too, had Sherlock not stopped him.
about having colored powder thrown at you?”
Sherlock rested his head on John’s shoulders before finally reaching down to hold the condom as he pulled out.  John felt around for his discarded t-shirt and gave himself a quick wipe-down before handing it over to Sherlock, who must have deposited the condom on the floor before collapsing on the bed.  They were both sweaty, sore, and beyond exhausted.
