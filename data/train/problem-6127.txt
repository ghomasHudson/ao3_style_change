In other circumstances Steve would almost feel bad for the idiot but he had plans for today. He had been looking forward to spending more time with Tony at the MOMA, or really anywhere-and had instead gotten called out for this: Some guy in a feather suit causing mayhem in times square. Despite Iron Man being right there, this isn't the way he was hoping their date would go. Steve thinks the city is getting a little too comfortable with calling them for things local law enforcement could probably handle.
“Wha-” He gasps out when Tony sits back, taking most of that lovely heat and the warmth of his body with him.
“Steve. My name. My name is Steve.” The wind has stopped howling, and the medallion feels heavy in his hand, an anchor that only seems to be growing more tangible.
“I may be a hussy, but I have an ass you could bounce a quarter off of, that has to count for something right?” Tony still remembers that time they were both more than a little intoxicated and Rhodey accused him of wearing one of those Booty Pop things they were always advertising online.  Maybe it had been overkill to moon him for proof that this is all his, but Tony has no regrets.  Rhodey snorts, but then gets a sort of considering look on his face.
When they make it to their honeymoon suite, and Tony gives him an extremely talented striptease that ends in a Captain America themed garter belt getting stuck on the ceiling fan. “We’ll worry about that later.” Steve says, spinning Tony down to pin him to the bed, grinning at the sound of Tony's delighted laughter in his ears. “I'm gonna peel that underwear off you with my teeth.” He says seriously.
“What does love feel like to you?” Rhodey asks, months later, beside him on a deserted strip of beach along the Seattle coastline. He’s building a company here, something new, a lighthouse he hopes will draw the one meant for him, even if he knows it won’t.
“Uhh, I'm always down for a party, but what are we celebrating?” Tony wheezes, staggering over to Steve where he pretends not to be putting the supersoldier between himself and their very enthusiastic friend.
Steve felt his heart kick up, the world sharpened, colors saturated, and everything seemed to slow as he watched the private take aim.  This was it.  He thought, as he broke parade rest.  He heard General Phillips yell something, but he paid it no mind.  He wasn’t going to make it to the frontlines, he was going to die in basic, he thought almost half hysterically.  It didn’t matter, he had to protect his fellow cadet, even if Waters was an asshole, he didn’t deserve to get shot like a sitting duck.
does he want, but that's not how he wants this to happen. He doesn't want Tony to get the wrong idea, and he thinks maybe Tony is good at that-getting the wrong idea that is. Steve doesn't want Tony to ever feel used, not unless he wants to be. Maybe Tony will think Steve's old fashioned at heart, he wants their first time together to be planned-wants to make sure Tony knows he won't just leave after-that he's not just after a roll in the hay. There's a lot of stuff out there on the internet. Nasty things printed up about Tony pop up all the time. Old pictures of him with a woman or a man on each arm and a drink in each hand. They belittle his genius, make light of his struggles, but Steve knows a performance when he sees one, and Steve wants
He doesn't give their conversation much thought after that, but he really should have known that Tony doesn't forget things nearly as much as he pretends to.
“Oh we've got some idea.” Carol says, shrugging when Steve gives her a look. Tony seems completely undisturbed, in fact he looks kind of proud. Steve supposes he'd be proud too if his behind looked like Tony's. Which is not a good train of thought to engage in while sitting at the kitchen table with the team while the owner of said behind is using his arm as a headrest.
“Steve,”  Dr. Erskine paused, flipping Steve’s folder open, smoothing the pages down with practiced ease.  “I am certain you have already noticed that this is no regular recruitment office.”  He smiled crookedly, and Steve looked around, offering a tentative smile in return.
Steve put the cufflinks away in his nightstand, nestled atop the box holding the chains.  His teeth chattered with imagined cold.  Steve kicked his boots off, stripped off his uniform and put on the sweats Tony gave him that first night in the mansion.  The shivers persisted even as he climbed into bed beneath the mountain of covers.
His landlord was a different story, sniffing derisively and telling him he’d be shipped back home before the month was up, and not to expect his apartment to be there when he got back.  Steve took great pleasure in telling him to stow it, and even greater pleasure when the ritzy Packard showed up to collect him.  Maybe it might have been just a little petty to wave at old Mister Boone as they’d pulled away from the curb, but he was confident he’d either make it or die trying, and maybe he was just a little bit of a hothead too.
“Food for the Captain of my heart, I bestow upon thee,”  He pulled a big paper container out of his box, “the nacho platter.”
“Carnival games.” Clint says, taking a huge bite out of his probably ill gotten goods. Tony walks over to the kiosk, opening a panel in the armor and passing over a few crisply folded bills.
All precise lines and floating equations. Tony sweeps his stylus along one, muttering about weight bearing walls and materials. Light catches on the golden brown of his eyes.
“So sweet, so eager, you're going to make me feel so good, honey, I know it.” Tony murmurs lowly, turning his head to brush a kiss over Steve's lips. He's pushing Steve back a moment later, reaching above himself to grab some of the pillows that had served as Steve's just moment ago. Those he props under his neck and shoulders, before fixing Steve with a gentle but expectant glance. “Grab my hips, sunflower, pull me up onto your lap, yeah, just like that,” Tony trails off, biting his bottom lip and sucking it between his teeth when Steve easily pulls him up, tucking his own legs beneath himself and kneeling up to give Tony a solid place to rest on.
going to kidnap Tony. That is the absolute last thing of all things I would do to Tony Stark-don't you
presses in deep; Steve letting out a moan of his own at the feeling of Tony's body clenching around him and then
“Rhodey, okay, can do. So, what's shakin' bacon, need me to do something for you? Because I hate to break it to you but that ship has unfortunately sailed.”
“Don't talk to him before coffee, he's not human.” Clint adds from where he's picking at his nails with an arrow.
He rested little, and slept less, the only pause in it was found wrapped in the arms of fellow soldiers, when it got to be too much and he absolutely had to seek the comfort of another person.  There were of course omegas trained specifically, specialized therapists for battle fatigued alphas and betas coming back from the frontlines.  He wasn’t on the frontlines though, there was no reason he couldn’t deal with this on his own.  Putting in a request to see an omega just so they could give him some peace for a little while was ridiculous.  There were alphas and betas coming back from the war missing limbs, what the hell did he have to complain about?  That and his instincts, everything that made an alpha an alpha, it was ramped up in him, made more.  He worried that an omega touching him would be hurt by it somehow, that it would be too much, that the energy and emotional transfer from him would leave them broken in some way.  He couldn't risk it, no matter how much the idea appealed to him, how much he longed for it.
but usually he managed to say something at least.  The man’s face fell, and Steve finally found it within himself to speak, he was probably coming off as rude, hell.  “Having a little trouble, yeah, this is a real nice training room, do the Avengers train in here as a team?”  There, that seemed to put the smile back on his guest’s face.  Steve felt a little breathless, and irritatingly stupid in the head.
“Take a picture, wanna send it to Tony.” Steve says, passing over his phone and standing there; managing to look both enticing and patriotic while holding a ridiculous stuffed fruit. Tony has no idea how he manages to make it work, but he
“Be still, c'mon, be good for me.” He murmurs against the smooth skin of Tony's neck. Tony screws his eyes shut, his legs fall open and loose from around Steve's waist. Smooth fabric slides across metal as Tony sets his heels on the table and spreads his thighs so their hips are pressed flush together. Hazy brown eyes slit open, irises just barely visible through a crescent of thick dark lashes.
“Can I touch you?” Steve asks, kissing his ear, breath minty where it fans against the side of his face.
“Excuse me, Captain Rogers, may I come in?”  Whoever it was they were a Brit.  Steve lurched up to sit, schooling his features into something he hoped looked neutral.
“Our date got cut short.” Steve murmurs under his breath, Tony's head snaps in Steve's direction, but Steve's not looking at Tony, but instead down at his phone. Surely enough the HUD helpfully displays Cap's text to speech message within moments of it being sent. Huh. Steve has figured out text to speech, that's pretty impressive, but not at all surprising.  “I'll bring you something, I promise, wait up for me sweetheart?” There's a tiny fond smile curling at the corner of Steve's lips. He's staring down at his phone so affectionately that Tony wants to rip his helmet off and say '
“Cap, I’m fine, really, just a minor setback.”  The helmet retracted, Steve didn’t know it could do that.  Tony was smiling down at him, his eyes looked more dilated than they probably should have been.  Steve stood up a little straighter, peered into his face searchingly.  Tony stared back at him, he frowned.  “Have you been having trouble sleeping?”
Steve shakes his head, bringing Tony's hand up to press another kiss against his knuckles.  Just as before it seems to make Tony almost hold his breath.  “Don't stop. I'm glad that you...that you think of me and want to make things to keep me-and the Avengers safe. So thank you again Tony.” He says, giving Tony the brightest smile he can manage.  Tony is looking at him now, really looking.  It's an expression he's seen on Tony's face so many times now, the look he's been giving the long scrawling lines of math he can't seem to put down these days, a puzzle, something unknown.  It's vaguely satisfying to be able to throw a super-genius for a loop, but he'd much rather Tony see how much Steve cares for him, how highly he thinks of him.
They meet up a short time later down in the garage. Tony feels like he might be losing his mind. He's never come across anyone even remotely like Steve Rogers. The man said no to a Tony Stark blowjob because he wants to go on a
“Where's my good morning kiss Mister Universe?” Tony asks, coming right up into Steve's space-close enough that Steve can feel the slight heat shearing off the armor in waves.
“It does feel good, you weren't hurting me.” Tony snaps his mouth shut before he can do something as undignified as begging. To his relief Steve doesn't ask any further questions, just resumes rubbing at his back with slow even motions. Tony sags against him, as Steve strokes the fingers of his other hand over his jaw.
“Fuck, Tony.” Steve knows the plug isn't nearly as big as he is, but for just a moment he calls Tony's bluff; bracing one hand on Tony's hip, and using the other to guide himself just barely into warm gripping heat. His eyes almost cross at the tightness, and Tony makes a high punched out sound, trying and failing to push back against him, only the hand on his hip keeps him still.
“I very much felt like a tin of sardines.” JARVIS adds helpfully from his spot near the table. Tony's eyes narrow.
doing the whole courting thing.” He blurts out, and Rhodey nods as if that makes sense, swinging his legs to get out of bed and walking over to the couch in his hotel room. Wow. Tony kind of expected a solid telling off for waking Rhodey to talk about his feelings for Steve. Rhodey just kind of looks like he was expecting it; sprawling across his couch and settling his phone on a stand on the coffee table to stare at Tony. He turns his wrist, clearly waiting for Tony to continue.  “At least I think he is, he said he was but what-I don't know, anyway.  What the
“M’hot.”  He grumbled, kicking the blankets off.  Tony stared down at him for a moment, his fingers twitched, he looked a little pink in the face.
man Steve has ever known. Steve loves him so much he doesn't know what to do with himself, so he settles on hugging Tony more tightly, whispering his thanks and praise until Tony is blushing tomato red and scampering off to harass Rhodes about the tiny robotic pea shooters he gave him as a gag gift.
“If I'm amazing then what does that make you, Captain America?” He says, interrupting his own spiraling thoughts before they ruin the moment. He gets a blinding smile in return.
“Oh, I'm offering.” Tony says, low and hot. “You have to let me up though, and I'm going to need an hour.” Strong hands run all over Steve's chest, under his shirt, then down to cup the heavy weight of his cock where it's leaving a wet spot against the front of his sweats.  “Wow. Yeah, and my bedroom please, I'm going to need a lot of lube.”
“Sir, would you like me to prepare your pain medication?” JARVIS is always so helpful, even when he's being a snarky asshole, still, Tony groans, pushing himself up to sit with a grimace.
“No. If I...if I leave now some of the donations might fall through.” Tony shakes his head, raking a hand over his face.
things I could be doing right now Bruce, but I won't, because I am an adult, and I feel like shit right now, very unsexy.”
Warnings in this chapter for Steve being VERY depressed at times and coping badly, references to the A-bombs, and canon-typical violence.
“He wants the arc reactor, my tech, access to technology I discussed with him as a friend, he needs me alive and mostly unharmed. At least I think he does.” Tony sounds so certain, but Steve doesn't think it's entirely true.
“What, alive?” He deadpans, too exhausted to even react when the gold and red faceplate bobs in a hesitant nod.
“Call me Fido.” He said seriously. Tony frowned, then sat forward, leaning closer to Steve, blue eyes searching.
Time passes just as slowly as Steve predicted. He keeps his hands off of himself by sheer force of will. Tony is true to his word however, and at just a few minutes over the hour, he's back in the room, crawling up onto the bed, all dark eyes and wicked intent. It's definitely a good look on him, and Steve feels his arousal come back full force when Tony perches his warm naked form on his lap, and leans in for a scorching kiss.
“I'm sure I don't know what you mean.” The illusion is a little flimsy, because JARVIS sounds entirely unsurprised.  Steve pulls up a video of Tony crouching down to take a picture with a pair of tiny twin girls. The three of them flash the peace sign, Steve feels that one two punch of affection sharp-right between the ribs. Tony's real smile is something Steve wants to see more of. Behind them Iron Man is posing for a picture of his own, but his movements are off.
“I think I might be uh...into Steve?” He says slowly, hesitant to even give voice to this new realization-this new, old realization.  He thought he was over his crush on Captain America years ago, but meeting the man in the flesh had only served to remind Tony that never happened. Steve in person is better than any childish fantasy he ever could have cooked up, and it's getting more difficult to ignore, not that he has any choice other than to do just that.  He's under no illusions that dating Tony Stark is, and would ever be on Steve's radar as a possibility.  JARVIS makes a series of short beeping sounds that equate to laughter. Tony scowls.
“What about this, you contact him, and we run a trace, we go to him and take him out.”  Steve suggests, hoping against hope that Tony will take it as the reasonable suggestion it is.
“Okay, okay, but still, my room, it has a bigger bathroom. You can wait for me in there if you like too.” Tony offers, and Steve doesn't know how he'll handle an entire hour of tension, but he's survived the wait up until now.
him there. Steve's mind fuzzes out unable to comprehend just how arousing all of this is. He strips off his other glove, hand going down to stroke through dark curling strands, tugging gently to hear Tony gasp. No one has ever done anything remotely like this to him before. He's not a virgin, but this, this is something
“No, what kind of monster do you think I am? If I drift before his fireworks, you have my permission to scream in my ear until I wake up.” It's a pointless thing to say really, there's absolutely no way he'll be able to get any rest for a while yet. Adrenaline still pounds through his veins, leaving him shaky and a mix of exhausted and far too awake even as he arrives back at the mansion just as the sky is beginning to brighten.
As if in answer to his silent worrying, the man of the hour comes sauntering in. A fitted black t-shirt stretches across his shoulders, and a pair of sweats bearing Steve's shield and the words “Captain America” scrawled down the side encase his legs. Steve stares at them for a few seconds, wondering how it is that Tony always manages to have at least on piece of Avengers merchandise on him at all times.
. Tony doesn't know what, but Rhodey just sags, stepping close to pull him into a hug so tight it makes his back pop.
“Does Mister Stark have a-” Steve pauses, his bow furrowing in contemplation. It gives Tony enough time to come up with a million horrible scenarios. Steve has found out what a horrible person Tony Stark is, Steve saw his sex tapes, Steve wants him to build a time machine. The possibilities are endless “a partner?” Well, that was unexpected.
“Can you take a third?” He asks, leaning back to watch Tony's face as he pulls his fingers out to trace over the rim of Tony's hole. Tony's pupils are blown wide, but he licks his lips and smiles when their eyes meet and hold.
He ended up tumbling into bed with a beta.  He was as handsome a fella as Steve had ever met, shorter than Steve was, with pretty brown eyes and auburn hair.  His scent was muted by suppressants, but he’d still smelled like fresh lavender and woods while draped over Steve’s back.  He’d been surprised when Steve hadn’t wanted to do the pitching so to speak, but he’d gamely brought Steve off three times anyway.  Steve had laid there afterwards tingling and gasping and wondered how people ever got anything else done when they had a partner.
The next morning, he set out to De Rossi’s gym.  It was a few blocks down from his apartment.  Small and tucked away between a glasses repair shop and a deli.  He’d seen it a few times, but thought maybe he’d have been laughed out if he tried to sign up at a gym.  There was nothing to be lost though-people already laughed at him anyways-so Steve stepped inside.  A little tinkly bell announced his entrance, but no one looked up.  There was a boxing ring in the center, where a pair of betas were doing their level best to knock each other's blocks off while laughing.  All along the sides of the ring, men and women lifted weights, or talked in little groups off to the side.  No one paid him any mind, and Steve felt a wave of relief course through him.
“I'm here, and I'm full of holiday cheer!” Tony calls, laughing when Jan whistles. Atop his head he's sporting a red and white striped headband, but what crowns it grabs and holds Steve's attention. Tony is wearing a headband with a little sprig of felt mistletoe dangling above.
“Yeah. Steve, I worry you know. I know he's got stuff under control but I wish he'd let us help sometimes too. He's been so busy we haven't even gotten to do our weekend nail painting.” Jan sounds put out.  Tony feels more than a little guilty about that. Weekend nail-painting goes
“How was your trip?” Steve asks, resting the towel around his neck and really wishing he didn't smell like a barn right now.
“Do not get into a debate with me right now about which of us is prettier, buster,” Tony says, and Steve can hear the smile in his voice. He peppers Steve's face with tiny fleeting kisses, like a butterfly landing and then flitting away, and his lovely clever fingers tap, tap, tap over his chest. It makes him feel light, good, as if his belly is full of bubbles, he feels lit up inside just to hear that tone from Tony, to be able to revel in his clear affection and attention.
“God, yes Steve, but that better be a mutual arrangement.” Tony says, darting in for a kiss-which is returned immediately.  Steve grins, rolling them both off the bed to carry Tony into the bathroom on slightly wobbly legs.
“Bambino, if I said no, what kind of man would I be?  Mia would never forgive me, I am old, but not a numbskull.”  Lorenzo’s dark brown eyes glittered, deep laugh lines creased about his eyes.  Steve couldn’t help but smile back at that.  It felt unfamiliar on his own face, it had been so long since he’d had anything to smile about.  “So,”  Lorenzo said, bringing Steve into his cramped office in the back of the gym, “what are you looking for here, you want to lift weights, learn how to stretch?”
“Ooh yes, you have uncovered my terrible plan; spoiling you rotten and keeping you all to myself.”  The sound of Tony's bright laughter rings through the room. It's such a good sound, one he wished happened more often.  Tony kisses his neck, toying with the tiny white buttons of Steve's pajama shirt. Just the clever brush of his fingers there, popping a few open and then slipping in against his skin makes him shiver.  “Mmm, what do you think? Would you like to stay in bed all day, because I have something you might be quite interested in trying.” Tony's hand is so warm against his chest, sending thrilling trails of sensation down his spine-that it takes him a moment to register what has been said.
“It's your birthday? I also have um. I was going to bring you breakfast in bed.” How Steve still manages to look in any way uncertain after what he just did, Tony will never know.
“HARK, IT IS I, THE MOLE MAN, I HAVE COME TO CLAIM NEW YORK IN THE NAME OF THE LAND OF SUBTERRANEA WITH MY LOYAL MOLOIDS!”  The apparent moleman yelled.  Steve hurriedly pressed his hand to the portfolio to undo the locks.
“In your desperate nervousness you have missed me! Come, face your certain death at the hands of my disintegrator gun!” Zemo taunted, haughty and triumphant as ever. A gun that disintegrated whatever it shot at was not the easiest thing to fight with the shield, but Steve had improvised under worse conditions. “Have you finally gone mad then, hmm, has your grief made you lose yourself, Captain?”
as if the word of a man out of his time could really mean the world to someone responsible for some of the greatest technological advances of the last century. Steve
Steve chuckles, leaning close to drop a kiss on the top of Tony's head. His hair smells faintly of motor oil and whatever fancy shampoo he keeps in his shower caddie. If he has a shower caddie. Steve deliberately moves his thoughts away from Tony and showering.  Steve presses his nose more deliberately into tousle of Tony's hair, and runs a hand through it for good measure.  Tony gives a bodily shiver, swaying a little when Steve steps back to make the short trip to his own bedroom.
“Nah, pretty sure both Thor and Hulk take that cake easy.” Steve doesn't find the admission difficult, it's not as if he's insecure, despite Hulk thinking everything is an excuse for a competition-usually a very destructive one at that.
“Oh god Steve, honey, baby, darling, that was the hottest-” Tony gasps when Steve crowds him up against the wall at last, that big body pressed all along his as Steve brackets him with his arms. “-thing I've ever seen. I probably shouldn't encourage you, but god
and then to beg Tony to please leave the life risking to him. He knows that would go over like a lead balloon though. Tony burns so bright with the desire to help others that Steve worries he will flame out, or that he will throw himself into the jaws of death even if it means saving just one person. He supposes Bucky would call this karma, Steve hopes he's having a good laugh at Steve's expense, wherever he is.
“My name is-” Tony thinks about that for a long moment, everyone in the room seems to be holding their breath. “Tony. Tony something, anyway. Not important,
“Oh, well. This is where I go when I don't want anyone to know I'm in town. When I'm not feeling up to dealing with everyone.”
Steve laughs, arranging them so that he's not crushing Tony beneath him on the pillows-although Tony didn't seem to have any complaints either way.  It's quiet after that, the two of them trading gentle hesitant touches, until Tony drifts off, wrapped up in Steve's arms with a slight half smile on his face. Steve watches him for a time, until the fire burns low and the only sounds in the room are the beating of his own heart, and the gentle electrical buzz of Tony's pacemaker. The last thing he registers before sleep sweeps him away is JARVIS' soft goodnight.
The envelope is light, just barely registering on the armors sensors with its weight. Tony gets is open easily, only just managing not to flinch when a slip of paper falls into his repulsored palm.
“Good lord, you're made of granite, incredible.” Tony mutters, leaning shamelessly into Steve's space to demand a hug. A hug which he gets without delay. Steve holds him, his arms a loose circle around his waist. He seems content to let Tony use him as a space heater for a moment, but then he speaks.
“I hear you, just relax, let me do this.” Says Steve, getting his knees under himself and dragging Tony's hips up onto his lap, shifting him to push one of his thighs wide, while draping the other over his shoulder.
.’  Steve wished it were so easy.  Away from the team, away from their warmth and that sense that everyone was safe, it was so much harder to sleep.  He tossed and turned, but finally managed to tire himself into another night of restless sleep filled with strange dreams and the cold.
“Why not, feels good, warm.” Tony answers slowly, once he's dragged his gaze away from what little metal peeks out from beneath Bucky's sleeve. That arm is just so
“Yeah, yeah, I know about the whole-” He flaps his hand expansively. “Reverse psychology thing and that he's actually secretly doing a happy little tap dance that I'm funding this team and keeping us away from the world security council's grubby little fingers.”
He thinks somewhat recklessly, watching Steve and his Captain America uniform come strolling into the room to set a big brightly colored bag by the door. He arranges it carefully there so it doesn't topple over, and then he's walking right up to Tony, cupping his face between warm gloved hands.
“Yes, I did, I loved it.” He admits, unable to think of why he should be anything but honest in this moment. Tony leans in and presses a quick kiss to his mouth that leaves his lips tingling, just that little bit of contact leaving him wanting more.
“Of course, what's up Captain handsome, something on your mind?” He keeps the tone light, walking beside Steve towards his suite. Their shoulders bump companionably. Beside him, Steve is worrying his bottom lip. He doesn't speak until they're in front of Tony's door.
Only the soft whooshing of the doors to the training area opening finally gave him pause.  He turned, wiping sweat from his brow in the same motion.  There was a man standing near the entrance of the gym.  Steve blinked, he was coming closer.
Tony had said, and Steve hadn't lasted long at all. Best of all Tony always seems delighted for Steve to mess him up a little; or a lot.
in a way Tony doesn't have a real precedent for. He wants to curl up in this, soak it in and roll around in it all at once-but he settles for rubbing his face against Steve's chest instead.
“C'mon, movie's about to start. Previews just ended!” Jan chirps from her spot perched on the arm of the larger of the two couches in the room.
touches him anymore-no one but Tony, and occasionally Iron Man. His bed is huge and empty, but Tony is right here, sliding fingers through his hair and whispering to him in sleep slurry Italian peppered with endearments that Steve remembers from the war. So he tucks the blankets around them; the canopy of pale fabric glows orange in crackling firelight, illuminating the tilt of Tony's face up towards his when he traces over Tony's cheekbones and rubs tiny circles over the smooth skin there.
“Welcome back sweetheart, do what you needed?” He says between kisses, shivering when Tony grabs his hands and leads them down to feel what he's been up to.
“No Steve, it's definitely not. I don't exactly live the most low stress existence. It's safe to say that it handles my lifestyle very well.” Further questions stall when their food arrives, and Steve sets about inhaling a truly impressive amount of breakfast. Tony can only look on in awe as Steve puts away enough food to feed a small army. He feels like his two slices of bacon, toast, and egg white scramble are pretty sad in comparison.
“Mister Jarvis, that’s real generous, but I have my own money now, I can get my own groceries.”  Generous was really the operative word, with everything Tony did.  He opened his house to the team, built them training rooms, funded the team, and he seemed to have an unshakeable affection for and faith in Steve.  It made him feel incredibly off balance, but also grateful, he just didn’t know how to return that gratitude.  He hoped he was making it worth it for Tony, for the team.
“Such a gentleman, as always.” Tony smiles, sliding into the sleeping bag and shifting around to grab a pillow, smacking it into shape before jamming it under his neck. Steve joins him shortly thereafter, slipping in behind him with a pillow of his own. It's quiet outside, night birds chirping distantly. Tony turns onto his back, then his stomach, then onto his back again, grumbling equations and rubbing at his chest. Oh. Steve thinks. The arc reactor must be bothering him. It's easy to forget that the life saving device probably isn't the most comfortable thing to live with. Tony never complains about it, and Steve feels suddenly terrible for never asking about it.
Outside the windows the city is lit with blinking lights, and white puffs of snow drift down. If Steve really listens, there are carolers somewhere down at street level. Steve falls asleep holding Tony close, surrounded by the people he cares most for in the world. It might not be peace on earth, but it's one of the best days he's ever had.
“We’ll sway then darling, it’s only us here, we can take this as slow and simple as you like.”  Tony says warmly, taking Steve’s hand in his. “There we go, now, just sway with me, put your arm around my waist.”  Tony does this sort of thing all the time. He instructs, and at first Steve thought maybe he was being patronized, but Tony never means it that way with him.  Everything he says comes without a shred of judgement. Steve doesn’t think he’s ever been with anyone who was so excited about the prospect of making him happy.
“Look Tony, I don't know what's happened in your past, I got some idea, but if you ever want to tell me I'll listen. But I just. I understand, that you'd want to maybe keep some things to yourself.” Steve's words trip over themselves, as if he's in a hurry to get them out. “Boundaries are an important part of any relationship.” Steve continues with an air of recital.
“I am indeed going to make a mess. Of you, hopefully.” Tony says brightly, leaning down to drop a kiss over the leaking head of his cock. Steve gasps, his hips rolling up into Tony's grip almost without a second thought, he reaches up intent on touching Tony in return, maybe urging him to lay down so he can suck Tony off in return. They've done that a few times, and the feeling of Tony pushing down his throat while Tony does the same for him is always indescribable. Tony stops him though, letting go of his cock to grab Steve's wrists and press them back down atop the sheets. “You get to touch me all the time, darling, right now it's my turn to play, keep your hands there.” Tony's grip is gentle on his wrists, but there's something like a command in his voice that makes Steve feel weak in the knees.
“Hey what's, oh god, shit, okay...” Iron man is at his side, Steve starts, realizing he's been hunched over his knees staring blankly at the wall for God knows how long gulping in air with long wheezing drags.
“Very good sir, shall I play Whale Song Playlist number one, or Clint's Sexy Cupid Montage number two?” JARVIS answers promptly.
“Is not. Listen, maybe I just want funnel-cake okay. Stop judging, let me live.  Besides, Hulk is already playing.” Clint sounds so incredibly put out that Tony almost feels bad for him.  Tony tries not to think of Hulk, He can see him, off in the distance trying to win a some kind of figurine set.  Yeah, he's definitely going to be paying for some property damage.  He didn't even know Bruce was in town, or that Hulk enjoyed that kind of thing.  What do you know.
But he holds it close, locks it down, maybe someday Tony will trust him enough to take the armor off, but Steve knows a hard boundary when it's wrapped in gold titanium alloy in front of him.
“You don't need to put that in a sling, it's almost undetectable under long sleeved shirts too. Just wear a hoodie or a sweater if you don't want anyone seeing it. I know you're probably still going to be ridiculous and go on one of your jogs.” Steve really does
The usual banter is much more subdued than usual. Steve notes several concerned glances aimed both at himself and Iron Man on their trip back to the mansion. Iron Man seems to be resolutely ignoring the rest of them, staring out the window and watching the scenery fly by with a palm pressed over the arc.
“Okay fine Jan, yours is the prettiest, but that's because you made it.” Natasha concedes. Jan smiles wide, holding her elegant holiday themed fascinator out for Tony to ooh and ah over. It really is pretty swell.
I am not Oliver fucking Twist I did not-” Tony appears to be trying to work himself out from beneath Steve, succeeding only in half turning to claw at the soft mats beneath them. “say please sir may I have some, more!”
“It is a little silly.” Steve murmurs, slipping a hand up to stroke through Tony's hair. “Silly is good though, I like silly, it's nice to just have fun. Thank you Tony, it's great.” Tony is watching him uncertainly, just the barest hints of pink along his cheeks, so Steve kisses those two spots of color. Tony's eyes close, and he lets Steve hold him like that until JARVIS announces he has a call from James Rhodes. The AI sounds regretful about disturbing them, but Steve is happy Rhodes will be joining them. Tony obviously misses his friend, and Rhodes has given him solid advice before concerning Tony, maybe he can help work a miracle.
The movement seems to stir the man in his arms, Tony makes a quiet sound-a soft hiss of discomfort, as if being lifted is jostling him painfully. Steve tucks him closer against his body, careful not to bump him against the doorway upon exiting the room.
Later, much later Happy brings the limo around and helps him in. He misses the concerned look Happy shoots at Steve and his answering headshake-too busy pouring himself a drink from the car's minibar, too drained to do anything but down one glass before slumping back on a wide bench seat with another in his hand. The ice clinks as Happy pulls away smoothly from the curb. Tony closes his eyes and tries not to think of explosions. He
“Well, I’m glad you’re a fan of my old tin can,”  He said, sounding just a little faint.  He shook himself, drawing his hands out of his pockets and stepping closer.  He wasn’t wearing gloves, but he had a few rings on, pretty, manicured hands, but they were covered in thin well-healed scars.  “Hi, I’m Tony Stark, and Iron Man, welcome to the Avengers, Captain Rogers.”  He held out his arm, and Steve stepped forward, gripping his forearm.  Tony’s skin felt so warm beneath the fabric of his shirt, the way Steve had imagined it might feel beneath the armor.  This close he could smell the clean minty scent of his breath, and a soft spicy, woodsy scent, the same scent that had been on the heated blanket Tony had so graciously offered him.  Usually, with his enhanced senses, Steve could get a good read on people from a distance, but Tony’s scent was subtler, closer to the skin.  Still, alpha, he had to be, to have strapped himself into such a fantastic suit of armor and stood at the frontlines with the others.  A few of them were betas, but the way Iron Man fought, the way he protected the team, Steve felt a kindred spirit in him.
Steve huffs, taking the lube as it's passed back to him, waiting until Tony has settled against the desk again to give one round cheek a good open handed slap just the way he knows Tony enjoys. Tony cries out, his cock jumping when Steve kisses over reddening skin. “Let me do some appreciating, would ya?” Says Steve, dragging his teeth over firm muscle. Tony just whines again, seemingly holding his breath the closer Steve kisses inwards to were he's holding himself open. The first touch of his tongue over where he's wet with lube and slightly open from the plug and he's making a soft choking gasp. Steve kisses him there, just teasing him with pressure and the barest flicking of his tongue. He's red to the tips of his ears, but the sounds Tony makes when he traces around his hole with a slicked finger and the point of his tongue are worth it. Tony is fantastic at this, but Steve likes to think he's a quick study, and judging by the way Tony is pushing back against his face he's doing alright.
“Hugged my ma this morning and I could tell she was sore at my da’, and then she had to go take a nap.”  He said triumphantly, dropping down into his seat to swing his legs.
“Happy new year Steve, guess we found someone to kiss for good luck even if it's a few days late.” Tony murmurs, smiling widely and demanding another kiss.
“Not yet, gimme one more try, c'mon this is embarrassing.” He doesn't look embarrassed though, just flustered and appealingly rumpled.
“Oh now you've done it Stark.” He growls, wrapping his arms around Tony's wriggling form and sliding downwards. Tony's eyes bug when he fastens his mouth over a spot just about in the middle of Tony's stomach, then inhales and blows the loudest most obnoxious raspberry possible on the skin there.
“Got me, right where you want me, gonna kill me.” He wants to touch Tony, make him feel good too, but Tony wants this. Tony wants to do this, and it feels good, knowing Tony will take care of everything somehow, even if it does make him feel a little selfish. Still that awareness, that desire to do whatever Tony wants, it buzzes beneath his skin, spools out within him when Tony squeezes his wrists again and smiles at him as if he's the best thing he's ever seen.
Steve hopes he does too.  Rhodes goes back to the icebox after that, grabbing a few things, putting together a dish full of food he clearly intends to eat on the way to wherever his plans take him. Just before Rhodes exits the kitchen something he said truly registers now that the imminent danger of being decked by the War Machine has passed. Steve feels his body go tight with anger so quickly it almost leaves him breathless.
“Yeah, that would definitely hold up in court.”  He answers, after a long pause, he's looking at Steve curiously, or maybe a little like a kindred spirit.
Tony was quiet on the drive back to the airport, but warmed up and chattered away during the short return flight to New York.  Back at the mansion he slung an arm over Steve’s shoulders and squeezed him close, promising to send him a new uniform because his old one ripped during the whole debacle with the Moloids.  In truth Steve was not even aware there was a rip in his uniform, but Tony seemed dead set on offering a replacement, waving off Steve’s assertions that he could sew up the tear with a decisive gesture of his hand.  He seemed insulted just by the prospect of Steve taking a needle and thread to the suit.
“Yes thank you Dummy.” Tony says, as the robot bends to offer Tony its party hat. “Yes, yes, I needed this hat, it is indeed party time. Anyway, done being morbid now. New outfit!” Tony wiggles his fingers around, and Dummy does another spin.
It's starting to get dark when Steve buys a handful of glow necklaces from a street vendor. He grins, dropping the bright circle of neon blue around Tony's neck.
“Side room.” Steve says suddenly, fingers squeezing his wrist carefully to pull him into an empty room. There's a table, a few chairs scattered around, but overall it's pretty clear no one has been using it for quite some time.
Steve went for a walk after that.  They would debrief later, when Tony returned from his business duties.  New Yorkers were just as used to seeing celebrities as they had ever been.  Some pointed and stared, but most of them gave him his space.  He found himself standing in front of a fine jewelry store almost as if on autopilot.  It advertised rings for bonded dyads, triads, jeweled gloves, and all manner of courting gifts.  All beautiful gifts he never would have been able to afford before being frozen.
“Fuck, you're so strong-” Tony groans against his mouth, and then they're kissing again. Tony bites his bottom lip, then trails a path of kisses over his jaw to suck a mark just under one of his ears. Sharp points of his teeth making his awareness buzz with heat. It catches him off guard, grip tightening on Tony's hip as he hisses out a moan. Tony's head tips back, mouth falling open in a high sound of hungry desperation that makes Steve harder if that's even possible. ''Fuck-” Tony repeats, eyes opening to stare up at Steve dazedly. Steve starts- realizing how tight his grip on Tony's hip must be. His hand loosens, rubbing soothingly over the spot he's surely bruised, and Tony gives a full body shiver, head going to the side to press into his other hand.
“Oh yeah, tell me all about this appreciation.” Tony says, suddenly so very over his offense when Steve tugs the plush away and hoists him up into his lap by the backs of his thighs.
“I know you do.” Steve says quietly.  “It means a lot to me though, to bring you stuff, to show you you're my fella. I don't want you to feel obligated to give me gifts.” Steve shakes his head, brushing their lips together.  “I can't give you gifts that will impress you, grand stuff that's fancy enough for a fella like you, but-”
“That's impressive, his eyes aren't even open.” Clint says, sounding awestruck watching as Tony opens the fridge, pours a small quantity of milk into his mug, then tips his head back to seemingly pour the entire cup down his throat in one long gulp. “You seeing this Cap?” Clint asks, gesturing at Tony and waggling his eyebrows. Steve hits him square between the eyes with one of the little breakfast sausages Carol likes so much.
“Sir, shall I call someone, you appeared to be having a nightmare?” JARVIS asks.  Tony shakes his head, licking his dry lips. Dummy rolls up close, clicking and whirring his worry like the great big baby he is. There's a clink. Tony glances to the side to see the bot placing a shake on the floor in a way that can only be described as morose. Tony takes the shake, trying not to spill it while he drinks it through the big bendy straw Dummy tossed in there. Where he got the straw Tony has no idea, but he appreciates not having to sit up to drink it
As if in demonstration of that anger, the punching bag currently feeling the brunt of his frustration gives an ominous creak. The chain swings once then snaps, giving up the ghost and toppling the bag onto the floor with a resounding thump of reinforced fabric hitting concrete.
Steve frowned, looking down at the bracelet in his hands.  It seemed so silly now, the idea of walking up to Russell and holding this out to him like some kind of prize.  Or maybe leaving it on his desk with a letter of intention, the way the alphas in the movie pictures did it.  Steve felt his ears burn at the thought of it.  Of Russell opening up a heartfelt letter and seeing Steve was worth it.
“Oh I don't know, the kind that kisses on first dates.” Steve fires back-without missing beat. Tony laughs, reaching across the table to steal Steve's untouched cup of coffee in retaliation-only to put it down after the first sip when Steve flips one of the big laminated menus up to obscure their faces when he leans across the table to pull him into a slow lingering kiss.
The next time they get called out to a fight it's at the crack of dawn. The sun is just making its way over the horizon, casting long fingers of light across the city. It would be a poetic sight if they weren't currently engaged in a battle royale with one Doctor Doom. High above them Tony is swearing up a blue streak and shooting off repulsor blasts while Hawkeye uses scattershot arrows to hamper the movement of the swarm of tiny insect-like robots currently infesting central park.
“Always, never better.” Tony lies.  Beside him Steve frowns; neither of them press the issue. For that, Tony is grateful.  “I'm...going down to the lab. Stuff to work on, got stuff I need. Need to do.” Tony chokes out when the silence goes on too long. Steve squeezes his hand but lets it go.
Steve kisses him to stop that particular sentence from being fully uttered. Tony just laughs, but he does kiss back, so Steve counts it as a win.
As always, your wonderful comments and kudos keep me from becoming an unproductive potato, I love them all.
“The press can go take a long walk. I don't care what they say, I want you Tony, all for myself.” Fuck, well, what Steve wants Steve gets. Sweet Nicola Tesla, he is so screwed. Rhodey's going to laugh himself into an early grave.
“Yeah no sweat, go ice your arm, I'll be in the hold, got the-” He sucks in a breath when the reactor buzzes a little more loudly. “spare in a safe here.” Steve nods despite not wanting to leave, helping Iron Man up into the plane before closing the doors to the hold and going for an icepack from the first aid cooler near the cockpit. From behind the doors a loud clatter sounds, followed by a heavy thump. Steve's head jerks up, his feet carrying him over to the doors of the cargo hold almost before he's processed his own intent.
Tony turns in Steve's arms, his insides flipping over unpleasantly. No, he's not hiding things to hurt Steve, but he's certainly not doing this to help him. He's so fucking selfish sometimes, but he doesn't want to stop, can't seem to when it comes to Steve.
“It's not a Turkey!” Villain of the week all but screeches. He's cuffed on the ground looking like nothing more than a giant plucked chicken, or maybe a woodpecker. It doesn't really matter, it's so ridiculous that it's all Steve can do to keep his Captain persona in place.
Another compartment opens on the armor to pop out an odd little device. Iron Man shakes it out to reveal a sort of complex wire skeleton. That must be the splint, definitely better than the twig splints he's made in a pinch in the past. He would share that with Iron Man, but then he would probably start swearing again. Steve really wishes he was out of the armor now, that he could see Tony's face, but he knows this is not the time to push. This thing between them is still so tenuous, even the slightest step in the wrong direction and everything might fall down like a house of cards.
“That’s gotta sting.”  Tony said over the coms, and socked Enchantress with a repulsor blast while Wasp flew down with her Wasp’s sting to deliver the finishing blow.
He wants to yell, but instead he lets Steve kiss him senseless. Time doesn't seem to flow the same way while they sit there under a streetlamp on a park bench. It's not the most comfortable spot though, even perched atop Steve's lap as he is, and it's starting to get a little chilly. Steve hums, taking his hands and rubbing them between his own broad palms. “Are you cold?” He asks, as if he's not being used as a pillow on a wooden bench. As if Tony's comfort is the only important thing in the world.
“Steve.” He says softly, and his eyes close, dark lashes trembling over slightly sunburned cheeks. Steve wonders how long he has been searching. “Steve-” He whispers again, reverent as any prayer at Sunday mass. He steps closer, presses his palm against that cold windburned cheek, and it's so real, so much he shakes with it.
“Don’t you start with my meat again, Stark.”  Steve says, laughing despite himself, pulled from his melancholy instantly.  Tony shakes with laughter against his back, pressing apologetic kisses against his neck, which is lovely, and more than a little distracting.  Still, he finishes his assigned task in what he estimates to be a decent window of time.
Not even five minutes later Steve answers back not with a text-but by striding into the lab looking like a man on a mission. Tony sits up on the cot to greet him, realizing belatedly that he's only in his short half shirt and a pair of leggings. Steve definitely notices too, but the look on his face is anything but displeased by what he sees. Tony freezes, the desire to cover himself with the blanket warring with the urge to say '
Clint shifts on the Ferrari, turning towards the movement in his peripheral vision and screams, clutching the box to his chest when he sees them. He bolts away at top speed. It's actually kind of impressive. Tony didn't know he could run that fast.
“Yeah? Really? I uh-you liked it?” His thoughts feel slower than usual, warm and happy, and floating. The way they are when he and Tony are together like this. Tony just smiles, leaves tiny kisses over Steve's inner thigh that make him shiver pleasantly.
“Yeah, that's...that's the tradition, gotta, can't mess with tradition, it's bad luck. You'll turn into a turkey, or even worse, Justin Hammer at midnight or something-” Tony's is looking everywhere but Steve's face, but his eyes drop shut immediately when Steve bends the slight distance between them to seal their lips together.
“You know me Shellhead, they don't call me the man with a plan for nothing.” Says Steve, and Tony laughs, leaning in and letting Steve pull him into a hungry kiss.
“Yeah babe, that’s right, I’ve got you.”  Tony whispered, helping Steve take his own tactical gloves off, because his fingers were too slow and stupid to do it alone.  “You needed this huh, I thought so, I’ve noticed, but you never asked.”  He was petting Steve’s hair, and Steve sobbed, tucked his face against Tony’s neck, pressed his cheek there against warm skin that smelled like vanilla, he tasted Tony’s scent too, this close it was like drinking a sip of hot spiced tea and the crunch of a sugar cube between his back teeth.  The way he’d had tea in a tiny Turkish cafe outside London during one of his few periods of downtime in the war.
“Sugar bear, it's you! I mean-” Tony pauses, holding a quelling hand up. He feels terrible about dousing the hope in his friend's eyes, but it won't do to lie to him; no matter how familiar he is. “I don't uh..actually remember you. Just you look like a sugar bear, or maybe a sour patch.”
Tony comes awake to light kisses on his shoulder blades. He cracks one eye open. The lights are drawn down, but the holo-clock floating on his darkened window tells him it's six in the morning. Steve smells damp and shower fresh as he leans over Tony's back, and Tony angles his head for a soft drowsy kiss. Steve must have gone on one of his ridiculous four am jogs. Apparently rolling around in bed for an hour the previous night had done nothing to cut into his exercise time. Tony sighs, mumbling sleepily as he's turned from his side onto his stomach. Broad hands work down his flanks, strong thumbs press into the dip of his spine, working out tension and soreness.
Tony Stark just might be the only man on earth more stubborn than even him. It's a daunting prospect.
“I um. I like Mister Stark a lot. I want to court him but I don't know if he would even be interested.” Why would a guy like Tony Stark be interested in a guy like him?  Still, he feels there might be a slight chance there.  Rhodes stares at him as if he's gone completely featherheaded.
Natasha just stares at him, completely unimpressed by his speeches as she ever is.  “Steve loves you, you know?” She says, ignoring it when Tony gapes at her, trying to wrap his mind around that non-sequitur.  “He'll love you whether you're our backer or the man he trusts most to fight at his side. You don't have to keep this from him.” She says, her words careful and gentle. She's talked to him like this once before. He was dying then. He wonders if she knows something he doesn't. When he gets back to the mansion JARVIS is going to be tasked with running scans of the reactor
Tony was speaking with Natasha when he returned, but he went quiet at Steve’s approach.  He had both gloves on, but the right one, his thumb was exposed.  Steve flushed, back in his day, that meant someone was angling for a kiss.  He didn’t think that was the signal Tony was trying to give him, no matter how pretty his smile was when Steve got up close to him.
“Aw hell Tony, sweetheart, I'm sorry.” Steve says, anger burning down into apology as Tony pulls his hand away and shakes his fingers out.
There's a moment where he thinks he almost has it, but then black is rushing up to cover his vision, his ears ring, distantly he feels himself shaking, as if he's seeing this all play out from a long ways away. His muscles scream with tension, and somewhere someone is screaming, funny it sounds a lot like his own voice.
“So I guess that’s a no on another date.”  Roy said.  Tony turned to regard him incredulously.  The undersuit slid back into wherever he was keeping it.  Tony sighed, and stripped off his gloves, lowered his gaze and rolled the leather up into his hand.
“You trust me to drive your ritzy flivver?”  If he was being honest, he was excited to give it a go.  It made him miss the motorcycle he’d driven during the war, he wondered if it was sitting in some museum somewhere.
“Tony, Tony, great to see you here, just the guy I was looking for.” Hammer sounds like Tony is crashing his own party instead of the one doing the crashing. There is not enough whiskey in the world for this, but standing behind the armor will only encourage him. The moron.
“We're gonna stand behind you and look intimidating, I brought my pointiest arrows.” Clint sounds excited at the prospect of menacing Justin Hammer. Natasha looks approving, striding over to Clint and shoulder checking him with clear affection.
“Need you to close your eyes until we get to the car. There's lots of stuff in here that might set you off.” Bucky is walking at his left, a baseball cap covering his shoulder length brown hair, and a single black glove hiding the hand of his metal arm like a murder strutting Michael Jackson.
“Is it good, does it please you?” Thor asks. The sliver of jealousy is rapidly upgraded to full on jealousy when Tony nods and lets Thor feed him another piece of the fritter. Objectively he knows it's ridiculous, Thor is just being Thor, he's not
“Yeah. Yeah I do.” In the humming of the ship Iron man's words are quiet, Steve almost imagines he can hear his real voice beneath the masking. He can't of course, but there's no denying a person is in the armor. Someone good who saw a soldier with shellshock and didn't go running in the other direction. He hopes there are more people like Iron Man in this new world, maybe then he won't feel so out of place.
“Close, I'm, I'm-” Tony gasps out, the breaths leaving him are short and staccato. Steve just growls, a low rumbling sound that vibrates against Tony's back. His hand wraps around Tony's cock, fingers forming a tight sleeve for Tony to thrust into while he fucks Tony like he's aiming for a prize. Tony would like to give him a gold star, he really would, but all he can do is bury his face in the pillows, and bite down so he doesn't wake everyone in the compound.
“What is it, the metal thing, all those machines?”  Steve asked, half pleased the question had come out far steadier than he felt.
“Of course, we definitely have red velvet boxes.  Would you like to write a note with your gift, or have wrapped?  We can take care of that for you here, no extra charge.”  She was moving around, polishing both of his purchases.  She very carefully set the cufflinks into a ruby red jewel box, and then the larger, more delicate chain into another red container, also velvet, but almost as slim as an envelope.  The jeweler’s name was emblazoned across the tops in swirling gold lettering.  Steve felt a little dizzy.
“You're terrible. Here, do you wanna try mine? It's peach with sprinkles,” Steve smiles at him all soft and dopey, dipping his spoon into one of the many bowls spread out in front of him and holding it out to Tony.
Everything but the present fled out of his head however, when it was his turn to be scrutinized by the recruitment officer.  He was a beta this time, but no more impressed with Steve than any of the others had been.  He at least seemed regretful while turning Steve away, saying it just wouldn’t feel right to put Steve through when he was still sick to boot.  Steve cursed his foul luck to have had a coughing fit while insisting on his own readiness to serve.
sending off his message without comment. Beside him Steve is tapping away at his phone, a fond expression making his features soft. Sunlight combs warm fingers through the golden blond crowning Steve's head, the blue of his eyes is a color Tony has only seen in paintings. Beneath the arc, his heart gives a strange and worrying twist in response to Steve hugging the plush against his cheek, and snapping another picture to send to Tony.
Rut, his alpha cycle, was stronger as well, that drive to protect ratcheted up to new heights.  It made him stronger, he had ripped the gun clean off of a tank after it shot at Toro, and then flung it into another tank, easy as anything.  Later, as he stood on the battlefield, panting and covered in mud with his shield clenched in his hand, satisfaction still eluded him.
“Yeah Tones I think it is. Stop overthinking, I know you're fundamentally incapable of that, but please, just trust me on this one. Now, I've gotta go, there's this thing called sleep which most of us humans need, don't suppose there's anything you'd know about that is there?”
that's disgusting.” Steve sounds as if the very foundations of his world have been rocked.  Tony can't help himself, he starts laughing. Steve just looks so utterly betrayed. He manages to get his smoothie back between involuntary giggles, setting off Steve in the process.  “Well that settles it.” Steve says when they've both gotten themselves back under control. Tony pointedly goes back to drinking his breakfast-earning an eye roll in response.
“Codladh sámh mam.” Tony hears as if from far away. The room seems to stretch, the aisle lengthening, and tony needs to reach him, has to reach him.
A cold breeze drags icy fingers over his face, and something tells him that's not right, his face shouldn't be exposed like this. Bright spotty afterimages flash behind his lids when he blinks, and the smell of smoke and burning metal is so overpowering he nearly blacks out again. Where was he before? Someone is leaning over him-speaking to him, blue eyes, blond hair, a face that Bernini might have sculpted brought to life. Explosions rock the ground, no, the street he's laying in the middle of. Something about the billowing clouds of smoke makes him cringe with half remembered terrors, the ringing in his ears makes his breath ache in his chest, and his fingers itch for a gun that's not there.
“Blasphemy, how scandalous.” He gamely kisses Steve goodbye however, waving him off with only minor grumbling at the inconvenience.
“He eats, he definitely eats. Sometimes I even eat with him.” He says, gesturing to the slowly melting shake. Tony squints at it, swiping it off the counter and shoving the straw back through the mouthslit as JARVIS thoughtfully opens it. He slurps at it pointedly, jiggling it in Steve's direction for emphasis.
“Pepper.” Tony groans,  “Pepper you're not my PA anymore why are you doing this to yourself?” Pepper just huffs, watching Mister Stark with something like concern.
"A strong heart will take you further than any physical strength. A strong heart means you'll never quit, you always stand up, you remember that.”  She said, her hand rubbing slow and soothing circles over his back.
He was tall, nearly Steve's height, or maybe a little shorter, but not really by much.  Compact, slender, but strong, with warm sunkissed olive skin, but his face, what a face it was, like someone out of a movie matinee.  His hair was blue black, shiny with just a little bit of curl, he had big piercing eyes of the prettiest cerulean blue Steve had ever seen, fringed with thick, dark lashes, and an incredibly precisely trimmed beard that just served to make his features look finer.  Oh wow, Steve thought.  Steve had no idea why the most aggressively beautiful man he’d seen in all his years was walking closer, as if he were there for Steve, but he was-walking closer that was.  If he’d have had a hat on, he would have taken it off in respect, maybe laid his coat out in front of his feet.  Steve hastily grabbed a towel off the supply tray and wiped his face off.
“Part of me woulda loved it but I haven't even really gotten to court him. It would have felt so good to do it though-god he's just gorgeous-but I want to take him on a date first.” The hand on his back stops moving, he can see Iron Man staring at him from the corner of his eye. Steve represses the smile threatening to give him away. If Tony is in the armor it sure is nice to be able to compliment the heck out of him without getting any blowback. Steve counts it as a victory when the hand on his back resumes its gentle motions.
“Cap, Steve, focus! I have another present.” Tony has rolled over on a wheeled stool. A brand new Stark Pad is summarily shoved under Steve's nose. He takes it from Tony slowly, turning it this way and that in his hands. It feels a good deal sturdier than the skinny flimsy feeling things Tony carries around with him. Probably reinforced.  “It's loaded up with everything, Jay will walk you through any questions you might have. I could teach you how to use it, but we both know I'm probably not around enough for that, as much as I'd like to be, you can always call me though, you know, if you want private lessons.”  Tony says, waggling his eyebrows.  Steve laughs, reaching out to take one of Tony's hands in his. He stills immediately, curling their fingers together and looking up at Steve cautiously.  “Sorry. Pepper says I can get a little um. Overwhelming. I can stop.”
“You became briefly agitated, but seemed content to be carried soon after.” JARVIS has a similar tone to someone trying to talk a treed cat down.  It would be kind of funny if he wasn't the one needing to be coaxed out of the metaphorical tree.  Tony blinks, hand unconsciously going to rest over the reactor.
It's a quiet sort of intimacy, something he never thought he could have after the serum and his long time away from the world. He only wishes Tony understood.
“You have tried to serve your country, what is it now,”  Dr. Erskine opened the file, his brow rising nearly to his hairline, “no less than fifteen times, if we do not count the occasions you attempted to forge your age.”  The tone of his voice was something in between amusement and respect.  Steve licked his lips, staring at that thick folder.  He’d had no idea someone had been keeping tabs on him.
“Hey, no flirting with my fella-unless I'm gettin' some special candy too.” Steve says with mock seriousness. Tony blinks in confusion. Holy
“No, darling, not yet. I would dearly love for you to touch me, I always do, but, that is not the name of the game today.” Tony smiles, urging Steve further back on the bed, climbing up over him, rubbing over Steve's bottom lip with his thumb. The soft silk of his robe brushes all along Steve's skin where it hangs open, and he shivers, willing himself not to reach up, grab two handfuls of that robe and pull Tony down against him. “That is if you want it, but I'd like a clear yes from you. You remember your colors, don't you, tesoro?”
Tony, I mean, just look at this-” he gestures at the twinkling, shifting holograms around them.  Tony is
“Carefully, again.” Jarvis murmurs encouragingly, and Steve repeats his approach, smiling when Tony leans into his touch this time instead of away.
Steve couldn’t wrap his head around it, wanting something like that, seeking something like that.  Objectively he knew there were evil people in the world.  He had met a few in his time, but nothing like what Dr. Erskine was describing.  An alpha like that was even more incomprehensible.  Alphas were supposed to protect, to form the cornerstone of a nation’s defensive capabilities, or protect their loved ones, on a smaller scale.  Even, historically, in the times Before, when humans spent all their days warring and scraping for territory, alphas were there to protect their people.  An alpha serving the Nazis though, that wasn’t protection, that was an unspeakable evil.  He couldn’t imagine how Dr. Erskine must have felt, seeing his work empowering such a monster.  That he could sit before Steve and offer that same work to him then, Steve could not imagine what he had done to earn that trust.
“Yeah Stark, stop making eyes at each other and get your fine ass into a couch. Oh god, did I just say that out loud? I've been listening to Cap talk about you too muc-” Carol cuts him off by winding an arm around his head and dragging him into a very intense headlock. Tony would feel bad for him, but Clint's made his painful nest, now he has to lay in it.
“No.” Tony is so stubborn, Steve wonders if there's a gene for stubbornness, if so, both he and Tony probably have it in a big way.
Steve stares at it for a moment breathing heavily and shaking out his hands. There is a whirring sound; what remains of the chain in the roof moves towards the back of the room, and the ceiling shifts with it, bringing a new punching bag over to where he stands along a roof mounted conveyor belt. A trapdoor opens in the floor, taking the broken punching bag away as well. Steve sighs. He wonders when Tony installed that, there's no question in his mind that it
"Reveille, reveille,”  He said with a smile, but it quickly dropped off his face when he noted Steve in his sweatpants and shirt.  “Did I wake you?  I can come back later, sorry-”
“Steve, where are we going?” Tony asks, following Steve's steps regardless, until they're standing just in front of the plush black leather couch in the far corner of the room. Steve tilts his head down, fixing Tony with an expectant stare completely at odds with how red his ears still are.
Steve woke up in a state of confusion. His body was warm, languid, as if every pain and stress accumulated over the years was no more. For the first time since waking up, the covers were kicked down to the end of the bed. He wasn’t cold, he was warm in fact, his water bottle pillow was across the bed instead of clutched tightly in his arms. Briefly he couldn’t remember how it was he came to be in his room, and then it all came rushing back. The newspaper, the horrible drop that followed it, and, Steve sucked in a deep breath. Tony was an omega, Tony had touched him, held him, been so sweet and generous and without judgement while Steve did his best impersonation of a walking disaster. Even going so far as to stay with Steve until he fell asleep.
“Who was it?” Steve would dearly like to find them.  Rhodes stops on his way to the doorway, turning his head and glancing over his shoulder to where Steve stands rigid; fists clenched tightly and body strung tense.  He wants to call Iron Man up, ask him if he knows.  He wants an itemized list, but he doubts he'll get it.  Tony shares so much with all of the Avengers, his home, his tech, his time-but he guards his personal life extremely closely.  Still, Steve wants to do
“You really made all of this?”  Steve asks wonderingly. A sunny yellow pile of fluffy scrambled eggs takes up an entire plate, as does a veritable mountain of crispy perfectly cooked bacon.  There's coffee, orange juice, an assortment of muffins, and a very neatly organized stack of jelly tins-the kind Steve remembers from diners so long ago.
There were supposed to be several others like him, but now the weight of all those expectations has fallen to him. He wanted to be a soldier, but he's Atlas instead. He is The Captain now though, and there is no time to process the terrible wonder of what he has become. So he pushes it down, locks it up like an ugly secret.
“Baby, I am not even going to answer that.”  Tony took his hand, leading him down the hall until they reached his room, with Steve trailing after him on autopilot.  He got Steve into the bed with surprising efficiency, helping to strip his boots and mail shirt off, but declining anything else.  “Not that I won’t respect you in the morning, but sugar, you’re not in your right mind.”  He said, pulling the covers up just under Steve’s chin.
“Steve, honey-” Tony sighs, pushing Steve back in his chair and clambering up onto his lap. His weight settles there, comforting and real, and Steve holds him, sweeping his fingertips over the back of his neck and up into the dark curling hairs at the nape of his neck. “I live here with you all. Everyone knows I make things for the Avengers, there's always been a target on my back. At this point it's not an 'if' I'll get hurt, it's a when, you can't put that much weight on my safety.” The matter of factness, the flippancy with which Tony discusses his own life makes the blood freeze in his veins just as surely as any icy water.
“I tried to, but he just wouldn’t let up, and I had places to be, so I took the ticket.  I don’t plan on going.”  Tony frowned, so did Steve.  He sure hated it when some lousy cad couldn’t take a hint.  Maybe the guy was just socially inept and couldn’t tell Tony didn’t want to be friendly outside of work.  “Wait!”  Tony said, his eyes lit up, he looked as if some brilliant idea had occurred to him.  “Come with me!”  A wide smile was spreading across his face.  He leaned forward, set his hands on the table like a man making some kind of business proposal.
“I don't want a froyo machine Tony, I just wanna take you out. Fella like you deserves to go out somewhere don't you think?” Steve is just so
“It's nothing, really Steve. It's-it's nothing” Tony lies. They say the truth will set you free, but Tony would chain himself to a boulder if it meant one more day feeling Steve's arms around him like this.
to have said about me-I'm covered in scars, did you know that? Not like you, you're...I,”  Tony's eyes are wide, so wide. Steve carefully sets down his new uniform, placing it atop one of the many tables scattered around the workshop.  “Even if we're ever...if we're ever going to sleep with each other. I'm. You can't see part of my chest. There's a pacemaker, it's. I can't show it to you.” Steve nods, feeling something twist in his core. A complicated cascade of emotions. Want, anger, fierce and protective, all circling back into a dizzying rush that Tony has said a lot of things, but he hasn't said
“Up then, let’s get you to bed, I don’t have the armor, so I sadly can’t carry you.”  He wiggled his fingers at Steve encouragingly, pulling Steve up to stand with impressive strength when Steve accepted the hand up.
“I’m not the one who needs worrying about as it is.” He reached out, clearly telegraphing his intentions, and laid his hand on Steve’s knee, giving it a gentle squeeze. “I’m worried about you, Cap,”
The new punching bag seems to taunt him with its wholeness, and Steve would feel kind of sheepish about how many of them he's destroyed, but Tony just seems impressed by the carnage. Steve slumps over to his water bottle where it sits on a long bench and taking a long swig. After emptying and refilling the bottle he goes to stand in front of the heavy bag again, fists raised in preparation. Before he can land his first punch however, the distant sound of music gives him pause. Steve cocks his head, listening as the first hesitant strains become more confident.
