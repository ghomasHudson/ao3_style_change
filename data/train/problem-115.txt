“The mountains,” he finally said. “But where should we look? The mountains aren’t an easy place to search, especially not in this weather.”
"Oh no…" The Queen broke into a run towards the princes. The maids were kept from entering the room by the King’s stern glare.
Sherlock crossed his arms over his chest, trying to contain his nervous energy. “Yup,” he answered, popping the
Billy pointed his finger tentatively at the space between Sherlock and the chimney and the prince tilted his head in assent.
"Shut up!" came Sherlock's voice as the price ran out the door, only to stop in his tracks at the sight of the frozen fountain.
John had gone to bed at 1.35 AM, leaving Sherlock to work on his laptop. He had fallen asleep 10 minutes after turning off his bedside lamp and started snoring at exactly 2.20 AM. He was now sleeping on his right side, facing Sherlock and the bedroom door. His right hand was tucked under his pillow, while his left was resting on his right elbow, holding it. He could roughly make out the position of his legs under the heavy blankets, right knee bent and left leg straight.
After a second of panic his brain informed him that it was Billy, standing on his window washer’s pulley, fist raised to knock on the window again.
I think he is still very much afraid that Sherlock will turn into an automaton, and I think this is partially because of John’s low self-esteem. He still thinks his friendship and what they have accomplished together won’t be enough to keep Sherlock away from Moriarty’s dark call (as we will see again in TRF).
“Invincible!” Mycroft corrected. “But will they still win against Blackbeard in a storm?!” he asked his imaginary audience.
He approached his trembling son with care and showed him the small box he had been holding. When Mycroft didn’t move to take the offering, the King opened it to reveal a pair of pristine white leather gloves.
This one is just precious. This post marks the beginning of a side story about Mrs Hudson and new technologies that will carry on in the next posts.
Bill looked pensive for a moment before he answered “No, it’s just a way of saying, like a…” he trailed off.
“Come on, Billy…” Sherlock gave him his most winning smile. “If money is the issue here, I can pay you handsomely for the information. You could go ask your father again. No one has to know I sent you...” he lowered his voice to a conspiratorial tone.
As he made his way through the Palace’s West wing, Sherlock couldn’t help but marvel at how different it had become. Everywhere he turned there were maids hurrying along with dusters and brooms, pushing back heavy curtains and opening long closed shutters. Dust motes danced in the light, upset from their rest by the maids’ efforts. All the Palace vibrated with nervous energy while people ran back and forth, preparing for the celebrations.
“I’m still… here!” Sherlock grumbled, pushing against the darkness in his vision. He felt himself moving and realized that the men were dragging him by the shoulders towards the fireplace.  “I’m fine, I’m not even... shivering anymore.”
.. John is coming down from the adrenalin high and is feeling like he’s in a super spy movie. The same super spy movies he and Sherlock had binge watched a few days before.
“Come on, lad, wake up!” Bill insisted. “You need to get up!” He drove his point further by unceremoniously pulling away John’s blankets and shoving them on the floor, leaving John to curl up against the cool air.
“You were lucky it wasn’t his heart that was struck.” he said, addressing no one in particular. A faint blue glow appeared where the troll’s hand made contact with Sherlock’s forehead. Mycroft made a motion to step forward, alarmed, but he was stopped by the King’s hand on his shoulder.
was below a Royal Prince or some other rot. And the Captain would sooner fall on his sword than go against Mycroft’s orders. No, the only way to convince Mycroft was to solve a crime, quickly and brilliantly, for all of Londondalle to see. Then his brother would have no choice but to employ Sherlock as High Detective, or Supreme Crime Solver (he was still working on his future title).
Sherlock admitted to himself that this was not the first time he had allowed himself to indulge in several improper dreams and fantasies involving his companion. John would understandably be appalled if he could see what was inside Sherlock's heart and mind, perhaps that is why John had fled with such haste. That morning, Sherlock decided that such urges and fantasies were a danger to their friendship, and resolved to suppress or better conceal such feelings. But perhaps it was already too late.
John browsed the paper, thinking about what to make for breakfast, but kept an eye on Sherlock because he was a little curious. Sherlock usually engaged with John a bit more than this in the mornings and he was often excited to talk about his work, but not today.
John sighed and rose from his chair, heading towards the kitchen. He looked around, the eyedrops were not on the kitchen table, or elsewhere. "Sherlock, where are the eye drops?" he asked.
Sherlock responded, his voice low and serious. "Just observe." So John sat patiently next to his friend, their shoulders touching, and perhaps 5 minutes ticked by. Sherlock said nothing more and continued to watch the fireplace closely. John was finally feeling the exhaustion of the day. Best get Sherlock back to bed so he could go to sleep himself.
"Hmm? Oh, no, not really. Just a little red today. Must have got something in it." Sherlock continued to stare into the scope.
The younger man's reaction was immediate. Sherlock's eyes flew open with a shout and he grabbed the base of his own cock, holding it firmly. John backed off just a little bit, but he continued stroking at Sherlock's insides, letting himself go little by little as he felt the familiar tension start to build in his abdomen. He felt Sherlock tightening around him. Close.
Having received the answer he was hoping for, John gave Sherlock an honest smile and let the moment dwell briefly before he sat up. "Alright, let's switch places, you lie here, on the couch. I'll sit on the coffee table."
Booker never showed remorse. He thought he was entitled to the money of the 72 year old lady he tried to rob. He would have gone free, if Sherlock hadn't been so insistent that Lestrade interview him more thoroughly. As usual, the Yarders and the city as a whole owed Sherlock a debt of gratitude, but had repaid him in suspicion and jibes that he had too much in common with Booker. The implication was, as Donovan said, one day they would all be standing around a body, and Sherlock Holmes would be the one who put it there.
was more like it, but, again, obvious, John knew the answer was no. He was irritated that Sherlock was so blasé about his health. Just a little effort. So many people the world over didn't have access to any healthcare. Sherlock had a live-in doctor. The problem had been diagnosed and the medication delivered, just inches away, and Sherlock did nothing. John regarded Sherlock, reclined on the couch and pretending to read, obviously aware of John's scrutiny.
"Sherlock!" John shouted again as he finally came up behind him and reached for Sherlock's arm. At the contact, Sherlock turned, fist swinging towards John's head. The motion was clumsy and John easily dodged the punch, grabbing Sherlock's wrist and turning him so that John had him from behind with his other arm hooked around Sherlock's elbow. Even in his right mind, Sherlock would struggle to escape being held in this position as the shorter man, with his more compact strength, had the advantage.
He pushed Sherlock's door open without knocking. Sherlock was sitting up in bed, and as John approached he was shocked to realize Sherlock was actually crying. His mouth clamped into a grimaced frown, tears streaming down his face. John perched on the edge of the bed and wrapped the detective in his arms without hesitation.
Sherlock slept lightly, naked, as always, on his bed of grass mats. He rose from the depths of sleep into the early dawn, in an unusual state of arousal. The feeling of warmth and damp around his manhood was strong. With one hand wrapped around the rigidity of his shaft, he delivered slow, languid strokes. In a state of demi-sleep, he imagined that it was John's human hand, not his own, that was delivering his pleasure. In his fantasy, John enveloped Sherlock's body in his strong tentacles, reserving his hands for more gentle explorations of Sherlock's most private places. The John in Sherlock's imagination was surprisingly talented in delivering such satisfaction, and in a few short moments, Sherlock quietly uttered John's name as he reached his climax. His seed spilled in creamy spurts across his own stomach.
This was the first time John had ever seen Sherlock erect. His prick was long and somewhat slender, rising from a well manicured thatch of pubic hair.
Sherlock let go of John and crossed his arms over his chest. He huffed out a breath and stilled, obviously focused on calming himself down. John sat, waiting patiently, carefully giving Sherlock the space he needed.
John showered, shaved, and quickly dressed. Sherlock's bedroom door was still open a crack, the detective sound asleep in bed. John grabbed a quick piece of toast for breakfast and was down the stairs and out the door by 7:30 AM.
John rolled over onto the other side and struggled with the pillow as he tried to get comfortable again. His thoughts jumped from one topic to the next, spiraling back through the events of the past days. There were worries about Sherlock's sleepwalking. What if he hadn't stopped him the night he tried to walk down the sidewalk barefoot? What if, while asleep, he decided to concoct some dangerous chemical mixture in the kitchen or put the toaster in the sink? An obvious solution would be to sleep together in the same room. John wanted that. But did Sherlock? Thoughts, feelings, hopes, the last relationship he had with a man, a broken heart. John's mind was fully awake now. No use trying to sleep.
In the pre-dawn darkness of the third morning, Sherlock was woken from his bed where he had been staying beneath a makeshift lean-to with several of the elder ladies. Molly, Nikau cradled at her breast, led Sherlock along the beach to the point east of the village where the offerings to Wh'an were left. Sherlock wore the short kapa cloth kilt-like garment around his waist that was customary for the men. He carried with him his bundle of scientific notebooks, now filled with words and phrases of the Island People's language. In the first hints of morning twilight, he could see a canoe at the water's edge. It was large with one long outrigger, similar or identical to the craft he had arrived in.
Sherlock scoffed “No, you won’t! I’m going to get you up here and you’ll see how brilliant this is. I just saw a-”
For the people who joined the fandom a little later, I think it’s important to mention that the blog did change a bit between the episodes. Not only did new posts appear, they would also be edited. Sometimes the features on the right column would change, like John’s profile pic, or the hit counter (present during ASIB), etc.
Sherlock stomped his feet all the way to his own bed and put on his robe, not bothering with the sash. He stomped back towards the door, this time grabbing his brother’s hand on his way there.
“I’ll see you… I mean, bye! Goodbye!” he shouted at the amused prince and broke into a run back to the Palace. As he ran, he felt a smile tugging at his lips, but he refused to let it grow.
The ragged summit of Whitehall Mountain peeked over the snowy hills, shimmering white against the bright morning sun. One could almost look at the clear blue sky and think it a normal spring day if not for the deep blanket of snow that still covered the land.
Suddenly, a mighty rumble was heard and the earth began to tremble. John was knocked on his behind but rushed back upright to look over his cover. He gasped in horror. Dozens of rocks, much like the one he was hiding behind, were rolling towards the people below, who huddled together, powerless to stop them.
Feel hundreds of eyes staring at him, Mycroft slowly took off his gloves, placing them carefully besides the Royal Orb and Scepter. His shaking hands hovered over the objects for a second before he grab them and turned around quickly to face the assembly.
The fun of these two blog entries lie on the comments. Remember that John and Sherlock got back home after being hired by Seb and finding Van Coon’s body. They have a potential murder case on their hands. The boys get back home and John goes to his room and types up both entries. I’ll go through the comments in chronological order.
Hurried footsteps were heard outside the ballroom. Suddenly, the doors were slammed open and two guards came rushing in, swords at the ready. They stopped in their tracks when they took notice of the frozen landscape before them.
Sherlock laughed bitterly. “Nope, we’ve been here the whole time, him and me. Well, me, at least.” He thought briefly about how ill advised it probably was to confide in some window washer he had just met, but he was too frustrated to really care. What was there to lose, really?
He took a few deep, steadying breaths, gathering his surroundings.  He had entered a cozy little shop, filled with an impressive array of products - from vegetables to medicine to climbing gear, all displayed in neat shelves and cabinets across the room. There were no signs of life beyond a large fire crackling in the hearth on the far wall, and that was all that Sherlock needed, really. He closed his eyes and let the warm, smoke-scented air fill his nostrils and warm his lungs, relaxing his aching shoulders and back.
“John’s helping me find my brother," Sherlock interjected, pointedly ignoring John’s embarrassment, "have you seen him?”
“Yes, yes, we know,” the Queen teased and patted his cheek when he approached them. Sherlock huffed in protest but took his mother's arm and walked her to the carriage where his father was already waiting. He stood by the main entrance to wave them goodbye as they drove off. When he turned back to the main hall, Mycroft was already gone.
Mycroft raised a commanding hand to stop his brother's outburst. "Please. Trying to deny it is an insult to us both."
Besides the books, the Library possessed another source of entertainment. It so happened that its southern window was the only one in the Palace with a partial view of the town's square. Whenever his eyes got tired from reading, Sherlock would lean over the windowsill and watch the town's people go about their day. Confined to the Palace walls as he was, Sherlock treasured that view as a window to a different reality. His racing mind devised names and backstories for the people he could normally see. He liked to imagine what kind of lives they might lead, their goals and struggles.
mention other times when this tilting effect is used. Every time, the camera angle keeps Sherlock vertical and tilts the rest of reality.
Bill stood up from the table with a smile. “So are you. Now finish your porridge and go set the tables. I’ll go wake up the men.”
“Leave, please!” Mycroft let his head fall forward in shame, trying to hide his watery eyes. “Please...!” he begged.
They soon reached the top of the highest roof in the Palace, legs burning and hearts racing. Jim finally let go of Sherlock’s hand in favour of doing a pirouette, an impressive feat for someone standing on such a narrow surface in mounting boots. Sherlock chuckled in surprise.
Sherlock observed the woman for a moment before letting out a frustrated sigh. “No… she’s just debating whether to have another slice of cheesecake or not. I would advise her against it, considering her lactose intolerance,” he declared, already looking for another suspect.
Jim relaxed against the railing while his eyes followed the aggravated prince. He smiled kindly at his companion and took another sip of his wine.
John is going to find him fallen on his front, bleeding out. He is going to turn him around and save him again. Can I hear a Garrideb?
Sherlock couldn’t help but smile at himself. He had finally cracked the code! After all his troubles, he now knew what made John snore! He could now sleep soundly knowing this gap in his knowledge had been filled.
From that moment on, Sherlock’s days fused together in an amorphous haze. Billy would come by his window every two days to bring him more of his product and to collect his payment.
“You’d what? Make even more of a mess?” Mycroft countered, his voice growing louder. Catching himself, he closed his eyes and took a deep breath before continuing in a more subdued tone. “State affairs need to be handled with patience and level-headedness, brother mine, two qualities you do not possess.”
“I knew there was something strange going on! Sorcery!” Anderson persisted, sweat beading on his forehead. "Evil sorcery!"
The prince smiled in relief and suddenly realized he was incredibly tired. Without further thought, he threw himself on his back, to lie next to John and enjoy the cold snow against his overheated body.
His eyes locked with his brother’s over the edge of the report, analyzing. Sherlock raised his chin in defiance against his brother's scrutiny.
The wind howled between the tree branches, making the falling snow cling to his eyelashes and bury in his hair. Shivering, the prince tried to wrap the woolen cloak tighter around his face and neck only to expose his legs to the biting cold. He let out a long sigh that condensed around the wool, making it uncomfortably damp.
But Sherlock, in his mind, will not put his well-being first. This is his blindspot. He has no clue how much his happiness is tied to John’s happiness. But we know he will do anything
The prince stood up in his seat and propped his foot on the sledge’s immaculate dash, provoking a stream of protests from his companion. “Hey! Get down! This is fresh lacquer!”
“No. Go away.” John answered. He turned his back to the prince and laid back down, pulling his coarse blanket towards his ears.
“-Yellowbeard set off to sea in search of the evil sea-lion,” the older prince continued. He turned gradually on his heel, describing a circle with his outstretched arms. The wave took Sherlock’s boat around the ballroom.
With an aggravated sigh, Sherlock closed his laptop and stepped out of the bathtub. He took a moment to stretch his aching back and neck.
An awkward silence filled the room when Sherlock didn’t take his leave. Mycroft raised an eyebrow in silent questioning and Sherlock crossed his arms over his chest again.
For a second, there was a look of sadness in Mycroft’s clear blue eyes, but it disappeared when Jim stepped out of the thinning crowd to stand next to Sherlock.
Sherlock felt panic rising in his throat as the ballroom emptied around him, and he made a desperate move towards his retreating brother.
Everything was blissfully silent for a minute. Mycroft wondered if Sherlock had finally admitted defeat. But he knew his brother better than that. True enough, Mycroft felt a gentle hand pushing the covers from his face. An icy blue eye peeked at him, conspiratorial.
Mrs Turner, their long suffering nanny, did not take kindly to any time spent on ‘superfluous’ pastimes - that is, anything other than academic study and physical exercise. Despite her stern demeanor, she had the gift of discretion, and that was why the Queen’s had chosen her to look after her sons.
Silence fell as the boys worked on their snowman. Sherlock rolled a large snowball and put it on the body he had built, giving their client a head. He poked two holes with his finger to make the eyes. After some consideration, he decided to draw a large smile on their client’s face.
Tired of staring at the passers-by (who were giving him an increasingly wider berth) in hopes to find a criminal, Sherlock decided to continue exploring the town. He was eager to look closer at the places he had only known from the library window, inspect every nook and cranny, but he knew his time was limited. At least for now.
The men and the horses made their way slowly onto the frozen lake, adapting their stance with the ease that comes from many years of working on icy terrain. John and Harry were allowed to ride on the ice cart on the way to the lake, but would have to make it back on their own, when the cart would be filled with ice blocks and the horses would struggle with the weight.
"Hush, I can’t hear!" it admonished him. Its eyes suddenly lit up when it looked down and realized it wasn't addressing one of its own. "Oh, hello!" it beamed at John.
Sherlock huffed in frustration. "This is so stupid. Why am I like this?" he blurted out in a raised voice.
Understanding seemed to dawn on Sherlock and he glanced around the street once more, then his feelings quickly turned to embarrassment. "I'm sorry, John. This hasn't happened in ..." he didn't finish the sentence. "Did I hurt you? I didn't realize it was you."
Out of habit, his right hand found his coat pocket to grab the object within. He felt Billy’s glass bottle growing warm as he held it in his hand.
On the other comment thread, people are still sharing their pet peeves. Molly says something interesting, but I’ll get to that another time. Just notice how she mentions Connie Prince, the fashion guru that is murdered by her brother’s lover on TGG. Mrs Hudson is still borrowing Mrs Turner computer and complains about the sword mark the assassin left on her kitchen table that morning. Mrs Hudson is paying attention to her property!
Sherlock stood up with a start. How could he forget! The Andromeda would already be waiting for her royal passengers in the docks, her burgundy sails unfurled against the gentle breeze.
“Mycroft?” he called out, hopefully. When no answer came, he knocked again, more forcefully this time. Maybe Mycroft hadn’t heard him. He called out to his brother again, this time in song.
There was nothing more than to wait for another opportunity for John to sleep in Sherlock's presence. For now, he would this rare moment to catalogue all the new raw facts of his friend's sleeping patterns.
Sherlock ignored Jim’s praises and turned his attention back on the crowded ballroom. He wouldn’t find any criminals if everyone insisted on being dull.
for themselves - he makes sure to stress that it was a conscious decision for him and for Sherlock.  He is aware that it  a dangerous life, made progressively more dangerous by the fame Sherlock is gaining (hello, TRF?). John fears for Sherlock and for the people that are close to them. Already, he is aware of an impending force looming over Sherlock and his world.
Sherlock really did not appreciate his condescending tone. His eyes scanned the man for a second before he tried again.
Outrage boiled inside of him, until it spilt over. He pulled his remaining glove angrily out of his hand and threw it in the wind. Enough hiding! Enough pretending! The damage was done, his life was finally ruined. He could do no more - he would do no more.
“That’s not right... “ Billy declared, scratching his stomach absentmindedly. “They shouldn’t keep a bloke - I mean, a young man like you away from the world. How do you manage?” he asked.
We did not question the changed skull painting in TAB because the rest of the set had obligingly changed around it too. We assumed that the skull painting had changed because we were not in the show’s “reality” but in something different.
"No. I pushed Mycroft away, I should be the one to bring him back. I need you here to take care of Londondalle while I’m gone. Alright?" he asked quietly.
“Why, thank you, Harry,” John bowed his head at the reindeer and she raised her head in surprise, a string of drool dripping from the corner of her mouth.
There was a mutter of assent from the crowd before Sherlock felt a soft bundle being pressed against his leg. Looking down he saw Jim holding up a woolen cloak for him to take.
After a moment, he turned his head towards the prince and asked, “What were you arguing about, anyway?”
The top of the rocks was smoothed down by thousands of years of wind and snow, made smoother still by patches of sleet and wet moss. John made his way forward very carefully, trying not to slip and give away his presence. His heart thumped in his chest and his veins sang with the rush of adrenaline. He smiled to himself. Alone with Harry in the cold dark forest, chasing after strangers in mysterious places, he realized there was nowhere he rather be.
Piqued by John’s dismissal, the prince decided to take matters into his own hands. He pushed himself onto his knees and gathered the snow still littering the inside of the sledge to make snowballs, which he proceeded to throw at the approaching wolves with surprising accuracy. But the snow soon ran out and Sherlock was forced to reach for John’s bags to throw whatever he could find inside.
But before Mycroft could yell out a warning, the Ambassador came running down the steps, pale and wide eyed, followed closely by a few of the Palace Guards.
The man motioned them to stop when they reached the middle of the expanse. He cleared his throat at called out in a clear voice. "Hello?"
I don’t know the first thing about making gifs, but if you watch the “shock blanket” scene, you will notice that Lestrade gives a knowing little smile after Sherlock describes the shooter, backtracks and excuses himself to go talk to John.
“You were half asleep, no wonder you don’t remember.” Mrs Turner opened the bathroom door and pushed him in.
Sherlock's mad scrambling came to a halt a few feet away from the stream when he felt his clothes stiffen and freeze around his limbs. Light headed and short of breath, the prince suddenly realized that his only chance of survival was to keep moving, in whatever shape or form.
“Leave it to you to make this sort of mistake,” John said from the bathroom when he heard Sherlock close the door behind him.
"Oh, sir! I've searched every inch of the castle for the necklace and came out empty handed," the butler lamented. "If anyone can find the missing jewelry it's you, Mr Holmes! Please, will you come?"
The Queen began to tense her shoulders, but her smile stayed fixed on her lips. “Because he’s the prince heir, and that’s his duty. He’ll be busy with new lessons and some new chores.”
Sherlock gave silent praise to John’s ability to adapt to his flatmate’s idiosyncrasies. The doctor's only response to the scene was to halt by the door and raise a questioning eyebrow.
“So... you’ve got questions,” the prince’s deep voice startled John from his intense focus on the path ahead.
He was faintly aware of the door clicking shut as he spread the documents over his bed. He soon realized his eyes wouldn’t fix on a paragraph for long enough before the letters started to glow, so he decided to sort the pages into stacks as he waited for the drug to wear off. First he chose the reports, then the diagrams and maps, and then the case notes. Then, as his brain lifted from the fog of the drug, he organized each stack by date to build a timeline. Soon enough, his mind began to build a mental image of the crime scene and he found himself walking through his Mind Palace with a purpose, picking bits and pieces of information to form a cohesive image.
They exchanged a concerned look before the Queen stepped forward. “Mycroft, what’s wrong?” she asked.
John's dark blue eyes found her green ones. The warmth he found in her gaze made the knot in his throat loosen.
Sherlock had made sure the suit was made to his exact specifications, and now, as he looked at himself in the bright sunshine, he was glad he had invested so much time in pestering the Royal Tailor with all of his demands. The suit was made of the finest cotton, navy blue and accented with delicately embroidered green and burgundy leaves, the colours of the Londondallian flag. Everything was trimmed with a fine gold thread that complemented the shiny brass buttons. Under the jacket, Sherlock wore a pristine white dress shirt, a white cravat with a gold pin and a dove gray vest. The look was finished with a pair of white gloves, a ceremonial sword and glossy black knee high boots that had been discreetly placed by his door while he was in the bathroom.
You'll notice that it's not a constant thing. Sherlock finds it really annoying to have a speech impediment so he has been working very hard to improve it. Also it makes his lines easier to read if it's not a very serious thing :P
Mrs Turner waited for the maids to step back and handed the Queen a thick orange blanket to cover Sherlock with. Then she knelt in front of Mycroft, who was clinging to his mother’s side. The young prince did not raise his eyes from the floor while his nanny guided his pudgy arms through the coat.
“No, you said hold on. I’m holding on,” the prince answered as he resumed his barrage against the wolves. He had just tripped one wolf with John’s spare shoes when another one jumped from the opposite side of the sledge and bit down on John’s sleeve, pushing him out with it.
“The heart is not so easily changed,” The Grand Stamford continued, “But the head can be persuaded.”
“Born with them, and they’re getting stronger.” The King shot an icy glare towards his wife. She only clenched her jaw in answer.
But before he could answer, Anderson cried out, still unsettlingly pale and shivering, "You saw what happened; the king tried to kill us all!"
“Hm, yes. Fine, I’m fine.” he blurted out, unable to tear his eyes away from the man. Seeing the both of them standing by the sea,
He thanked his host and took a sip of the drink, smiling back at him when he noticed the slight alcoholic tinge in his tongue.
He was soon running again, this time towards the nursery’s door. “Come on, move your big butt!” he called out to his brother, who made a show of slowly standing and reaching for his robe.
Sherlock stuck his tongue out at the guard’s retreating back but he almost bit it off when a scream broke through the silence. Sherlock ran back towards the window, following the sound. His eyes widened like saucers at what he saw. In the town square, the crowd had parted to make space for two figures, locked in a fight. One of them was the pickpocket and the other was a blond boy, around Mycroft’s age, who was trying to pin down the thief. Even more surprising, there was a reindeer taking part in the fight, trying to bite the man’s ankles.
"You and Harry can come live with us!" Ella decided after she had hugged her fill. The gems in her necklace glowed a little brighter.
“Hi...” Sherlock answered, scratching his oily curls. Once his attention was drawn away from the case, he could feel the tingling pull of the drug invading his chest.
The people screamed in terror and stepped back from him, holding their terrified children and huddling close together. At that moment, the Gaulian Ambassador appeared at the door.
“How does your heart freeze, anyway? Is it when you fall into the lake, too?” the boy looked up at Bill, barely concealing his frustration. He was getting fed up of all this talk of frozen body parts.
Harry tilted her head in concentration. John chuckled and repeated his impersonation of the reindeer’s voice.
John found the reindeer standing in two feet of snow, with her head bowed against the wind. He rushed to meet her as best he could through, but he quickly realized he needn’t have worried. The reindeer’s ears perked up as soon as she noticed John approaching and bounded happily to meet him halfway, apparently unaffected by the cold.
Heart racing, Sherlock carefully braced his hands on the mattress and tried to quietly shift back to his side of the bed, but John's arms only tightened in response. After a few failed tries to escape, the detective admitted defeat.
A week after taking the case, Sherlock marched into his brother’s office and deposited the Power’s case file on his desk, along with a small notebook filled with his own handwritten notes.
He was at the door before the papers had settled back down. Outside he found the Royal Tailor, flanked by two nervous looking footmen, who held several leather cases and a carefully folded suit. When suddenly faced with the disheveled prince, the tailor took a step back but quickly masked his surprise with a look of professional indifference.
Sherlock’s attention was pulled back to the altar when the song dissolved into the air and the Bishop’s clear voice resonated in the church once again. Intoning an ancient prayer, the old man took the royal crown from its burgundy pillow on the altar and raised it solemnly in front of Mycroft, who bowed stiffly in answer. From his vantage point, Sherlock could see his brother closing his eyes when the crown touched his head.
Mycroft eyed the foreign prince for a moment before turning to his brother. “I gave you those cases to… to keep you entertained,” he said carefully. “It wasn’t a job interview, Sherlock. The ‘real world’ is a cruel place filled with stupid, selfish people and I refuse to throw my own brother into it.”
I can’t remember what was John’s profile picture after ASIP, but I think it was Sherlock’s picture… Can someone remember?
Feeling energized, Sherlock threw his legs over the wooden railing and turned towards Jim, who held out both his hands while planting his feet wide apart.
The princes kept their stances low as they followed the arguing pair across the garden. As they moved, Sherlock kept his eyes trained on the slowly advancing assassin and wondered whether it would have been sensible to have brought some sort of weapon with him.
For obvious reasons, this post was changed after ASIB aired, and is now the final version we can now read.
What if the vase slides because it’s “the thirteenth stroke of the clock” of this scene? What if the vase slides because it’s meant to destroy the reality of this scene?
Up in his study, Mycroft was pacing back and forth as he waited for the clock to strike the hour. He had ordered the Royal Tailor and all the footmen to leave him as soon as he was dressed and refused to see any of his ministers. The time was for control and concentration. He was about to appear in front of all the Kingdom and its allies - he must project an image of absolute serenity as he stepped in the role of king.
There was a murmur of surprise from the crowd when the guards began to herd the guests towards the doors. The music stopped abruptly, making the shuffling of feet and chiffon skirts louder for the lack of buffering.
John stroked Sherlock's cheeks and chest with his human hands. His suckers moved along his back, gently touching and reacquainting himself with the human after his long absence. The slender tip of one tentacle reached into the garment and pulled it free from Sherlock's waist. Without interference from the scratchy artificial barrier between him and the warm skin of his friend, Octopoda was free to hold Sherlock as close as he wanted. In any other situation, the gesture would have seemed sexual, but this was different. John needed tactile information and took great comfort from the physical contact as much as Sherlock needed to tell John what was in his heart.
Molly stopped just several feet from the canoe and turned to Sherlock. "I will leave you here for Wh'an. Take good care and be well."
"I mean it, Sherlock, the sooner you get those drops in the sooner it will go away. And keep using the drops, even if it clears up, or else it may come back worse."
Sherlock nodded in agreement and they repeated the motion for the third time. Sherlock followed John's hand with a grip on his forearm, the entire action taking less than a few seconds.
So, again, he tipped the bottle over, careful there were no drops ready to fall, and moved the bottle over Sherlock's pink eye before taking it back and turned it upright again. He would do this a hundred times if it was what Sherlock needed.
"Alright..." Sherlock responded. He was feeling a little confused. How could these people know about the mythical beings that created them? Did Molly really believe it? Was he truly special to John? John, who held such a place in the lives and creation myths of the society he now found himself in. Was Sherlock really that special? The thought brought a lightness to his stomach, but also made his separation from John all the more poignant.
Sherlock tried his best not to worry over the loss of his material possessions, instead he thought of John. John would come back for him and take him away again. They would build another home together.
"Um... I ah... was up. I couldn't sleep. I was wondering if, maybe, you'd be alright if I... ah... if I could sit here with you for a while?"
Still looking lost and uncertain, Sherlock's eyes darted to John, then away. He performed a slight shrug, his lips pressed together in silence.
In truth, John felt their friendship was very close and he wanted it to be more. He was plagued with doubt, though. That first meal at Angelo's, Sherlock had made it clear he was married to his work. What a fool John had made of himself. But what if things were different now? Couldn't a bloke change his mind? John had hope, but for now, he simply admired his flatmate from afar. No need to hurry.
John has 4 pairs of very large, very strong tentacles. The pair closest to his front are somewhat longer and more slender at the tips, and the hind pair are the most stout. Sherlock has never seen what lies buried inside the ring of tentacles, but he assumes John must possess an anus, perhaps at the center of the tentacles where an octopus's mouth would be. Sherlock has no knowledge as to the details of John's sex. Sherlock remembers his invertebrate zoology class at the University quite well. If John is like other octopods, and he is male as his countenance suggests, then one or two of his tentacles would be specially adapted to deliver his seed to a female. Many octopus species enter senescence and die shortly after reproducing, so Sherlock hopes quite strongly this is not the case with his friend.
John startled awake to the sound of the door to 221B closing. It hadn't slammed, but his military doctor instincts were tuned well enough that the out-of-place sound of the latch clicking back into place had roused him from sleep. He listened as Sherlock's footsteps descended the stairs. The door to the street opened, then closed. John climbed out of bed and padded over to the window, hoisting it open and putting his head out into the damp and cold night air.
John pulled the duvet up over both of them and snuggled deeper into the pillows. The warmth from Sherlock's body was comforting and he was relieved his flatmate's nighttime crisis seemed to have passed. He would lie here for just a few minutes, just long enough to make sure Sherlock was asleep.
John took his time. He held Sherlock's hips down and bobbed his head back and forward. He worked the frenulum with his tongue and enjoyed the scandalous noises that Sherlock was making. He licked at the slit, tasting the bitterness of precum and the distinctness of Sherlock. He heard his bedside drawer open and a cold bottle of lube was pressed against the back of his hand.
"Here you go," John said placing the small white bag on the table, "one drop in that eye every few hours for 10 days."
John regarded Sherlock's back, hunched up and looking small on the couch. He imagined a curly-headed little boy who thought his parents wanted to
Like a bucket of ice water, the words suddenly seemed to reach him and Sherlock froze in place. The street fell quiet except for the sound of their heavy breathing.
John brought two mugs to the table, placed one by Sherlock, then sat down in the chair opposite, setting his own tea down and reaching for the newspaper. He noticed, of course, that Sherlock always brought the paper up for John to read, even on days he was far too busy to do much else.
Coming together again, the kiss continued. Slow at first, then John licked along the cupid's bow and pressed his tongue between Sherlock's lips, which Sherlock parted to give him entry. John licked into his mouth, feeling the softness of his tongue, mesmerized with this new part of Sherlock. As the kiss became more heated, he framed Sherlock's face with his hands and gracefully turned them over so Sherlock was underneath him. He continued to lavish attention on Sherlock's lips, the beautiful curls of his hair between John's fingers.
"That sounds marvelous," John replied as he gave Sherlock a tight squeeze. Sherlock's bed. Big and covered with luxuriant linens and smelling of Sherlock. He kissed Sherlock on the lips, sincere but comparatively chaste to before, and settled back down next to him under the cozy covers. Indeed, he wanted nothing more than to sleep beside Sherlock every night and make love to him every morning. Not just because each of them would sleep better, and Sherlock would be safe from the sleepwalking, but because he was happy. He was finally with the man he loved. With that thought, he slipped back into a warm and comfortable sleep.
"I'm sorry if I woke you Sherlock. I'm alright. Just, you know..." he trailed off as Sherlock pushed the door open and stepped inside.
The rain had stopped but the winds had picked up and Sherlock could see white waves breaking beyond the reef. Without as much as the opportunity to look back at his home, John slid back into the sea, pulling the canoe along with him.
John returned to his chair. He saved and closed the Word document on his laptop, then sat quietly, listening to sounds coming from the flat. Ten or fifteen peaceful minutes passed by and John was nodding off. It was unlikely Sherlock would wake again that night and John was tired. He went to the bathroom to use the loo and brush his teeth. On the way to his room, John stopped by the kitchen and put the milk, now damp with a layer of sweat, back into the fridge. He would leave the chairs by the fireplace and the pots and pans on the table. It would be a good mystery for Sherlock to solve tomorrow.
John began shallow, then slowly drew the strokes out farther, pushing back in deeply after each. He thrust steadily, yet gently, studying Sherlock's face for signs of discomfort. The dark curls were sweaty and matted to his forehead, his eyes pinched in concentration. He was letting out whimpers of pleasure, gasps and sighs, and John knew neither of them were going to last much longer. He reached down and pulled Sherlock's thighs up, simultaneously shifting himself slightly lower so that he would brush his prostate with the next thrust.
Back in Sherlock's bedroom, lit dimly by the lamp on the nightstand, John led him over to the bed and pulled the covers away. Sherlock laid down and as soon as he rested his head on the pillow, his eyes closed, the tension left his body, and his expression settled to one of quiet repose. He looked almost angelic in the dim light of the room, his raven curls spilling over his forehead, accentuating his angular features. John pulled the duvet up over his sleeping flatmate and listened as his breathing evened out. He switched off the lamp, walked quietly from the room, and closed the door behind him. He left it open several inches, though, so he could hear if Sherlock got out of bed.
The sense of relief started to disappear, however, as the warmth that first felt so blissful against his skin began coiling under his clothes and around his limbs, making him feel nauseous and light-headed. His vision was blurring worryingly around the edges when a large man walked in from one of the back rooms, with open arms and a wide smile.
“Where are we going?” asked the Queen after she had mounted her own horse. Sherlock, wrapped in his orange blanket, stood out in sharp contrast against the queen’s black cloak.
“Everything is under control, you can handle this,” the King interrupted. “You’ve trained for this.”
“Time to get ready, sir,” the voice in the hallway informed him. “Your brother has instructed me to-”
The ice harvester had kept his eyes trained forward since the beginning of their journey, driving his sledge with single-minded focus and pointedly not acknowledging the prince beside him. Although seemingly absorbed in this task, from the corner of his eye Sherlock could see how John cycled between taking deep breaths as if to speak and pressing his thin lips together in restraint.
Sherlock watched until her form was no longer visible against the shadows of the palms along the shore. Now he was alone for the first time in so many days. He felt the solitude of the dark and strange beach.
As if that wasn't the hottest thing John had ever heard. He recovered Sherlock's cock in his mouth, his own erection even heavier now at the promise of what was to come.
John was simultaneously relieved and disappointed that Sherlock had gotten up and left before John woke and they could talk. He wondered what Sherlock had thought when he found himself in John's bed. Surely he wouldn't remember there was a woodland creature in his own bedroom, so he was probably a bit confused. It seemed, though, that Sherlock was taking his sleepwalking in stride and was perhaps, then, not too bothered. John briefly considered checking Sherlock's room for porcupines, but he was pretty sure Mycroft hadn't been by lately so surely his flatmate must have dreamed it.
The doctor churned the case over in his head. The crime started as a theft, then went wrong and ended in a brutal double murder. The Yarders were ready to condemn the worker who had been painting the flat downstairs. Though the man had confessed, the crime didn't seem to add up. The real killer, Henry Booker, was a university drop-out, desperate for money but couldn't hold a job. Booker was a loner and also probably quite brilliant, who knows what he could have accomplished if he hadn't been so troubled and cut-off from society. Sherlock had taken an immediate interest in him when he was identified as having been at the block of flats that day. Reluctantly, Lestrade gave Sherlock permission to participate in interviews with Booker on three more occasions. Of course, Sherlock finally got the information they needed and together with John had recovered the money and stolen property, sealing the case against the university drop-out.
Without delay, John reached forward, bottle inverted, and squeezed. A single drop fell from the tip, landing on Sherlock's sick eye. The detective flinched and made a quiet sound of surprise, pressing his head back into the couch pillow, both eyes clenched shut and forming the wrinkle across the bridge of his nose. He opened his eyes, looking to John with an expression of disbelief, blinking rapidly as if he was surprised something more awful didn't happen.
The doctor moved slightly, nudging Sherlock with his shoulder to make sure he wouldn't startle. He stood and moved around behind Sherlock, one hand on his shoulder. He reached for Sherlock's hand, which lay relaxed on his knee. Standing next to him, John tugged his arm gently, urging him to stand.
Sherlock stared at John, still mid-chew. The bridge of his nose wrinkled and he blinked rapidly as he obviously tried to remember. "What happened? What did I do? Did I say anything?" he demanded, looking around the room in alarm.
"Sherlock, you are a good man. You've made a career of helping people. Of saving people. You've saved me. Whatever malice, or anger at the world, that made Booker decide to kill those people, you don't have it and you never will. I know you, Sherlock, I know you're not a sociopath."
After several minutes, it was Sherlock who proceeded. A tip and forward circle of his hips, and it was obvious what he was asking for. But he said it anyway. He said it in a ridiculously low and seductive voice, dripping with arousal, and it drove John around the bend. "John,
After a short pause, Sherlock must have decided it would be easier to just answer. "In my room, bookshelf by the window, second shelf from the top."
Sherlock's life in England had been very lonely. As a boy, he had no tolerance for the inane trivialities and games of the other children. In school, he belonged even less, the teachers despised his cleverness and unwillingness to sit quietly when he was far wiser than the lot of them. In adulthood, many sought his company but were turned away by his unstoppable honesty and desire to prove to all that he was the most intelligent man among them. He was an embarrassment to his mother and father because, though he was an eligible bachelor, he had no interest in the fairer sex. He had no ambitions and no friends or companions to speak of.
"The fact that you're sleepwalking isn't terribly worrisome since you already have a history of the behavior. But I am concerned that you tried to walk down the street. You have no idea where you were headed?"
Sherlock sat contentedly in John's arms for several more minutes, his head resting on John's shoulder. As the first rays of the rising sun streaked the sky, Sherlock pushed back so he could see John's silver-rimmed octopod eyes in the twilight. There was so much he wanted to talk about with John, so much he wanted to tell him. Quietly, with no reservation, he spoke the phrases in John's language as he had learned them from Molly.
"Alright," John responded, he was being as delicate, yet direct, as he could. "I am concerned because you are clearly more than just uncomfortable about this. You are almost in full blown panic. Take a few breaths with me."
Sherlock took a slow, deep breath and let it out. "My first year at uni, I didn't have many friends. I didn't have any friends, actually." Hurt flashed through John's heart at the thought of Sherlock being so alone at what was, for most young people, a wonderful time filled with new people and experiences.
"Thank you, Molly, I am glad to have met you. I am grateful to your people for welcoming me and I hope I can come back and see you soon."
Sherlock huffed out a deep sigh and a slight eye roll. "It's easy on other people, John," he explained. "I've dissected human eyes before, it doesn't bother me. It's different when it's my eyes."
The hours flowed by, the children coming and going. They took interest in Sherlock, asking his name, what work he did, and what his family was like. Molly taught him several phrases that he spoke with the children, answering their questions with her help, and was met with smiles and giggles. He was given a grass mat to sit on, which was much more comfortable then the rough floor of the cave. The air was cool and dry, but the fire was kept high enough to keep him warm. He was shown to the women's privy, a small area with a low ceiling off the main cavern, where he visited several times to relieve himself into a clay chamber pot. He would have preferred to go outside, but it seemed against the rules for him to leave the cave or venture far from his circle.
"Yes," Sherlock replied as he reached into the pantry cabinet and shifted some boxes around on the top shelf, undoubtedly looking for the angel hair. He was doing it in that way he did most things. He knew he was attractive and even looking for a box of pasta it showed. John loved it. Yeah, he should definitely consider having a talk. Eventually. But not tonight.
John surfaced slowly from the depths of sleep. He was warm and comfortable, aware of a living, breathing body next to him. It felt very right. His head was pillowed on his left arm, his right hand rested on an angular hip. Behind his eyelids he could tell the light in the room was bright- much brighter than his own. He sighed deeply and snuggled closer to the man next to him. He pushed his pelvis forward just slightly, his usual morning wood pressing against his boxers. He opened his eyes and was immediately met with the calm but inquisitive seafoam blue-green stare of Sherlock Holmes.
The night passed quietly. The good doctor / blogger was at his desk in the sitting room, typing up the details of the case for his blog while the events of the past few days were still fresh in his mind. He glanced at the computer clock, 10:30 PM.
Sherlock was still anxious but he followed John's direction. Reclined on the couch, he blinked up at John, the unhealthy sheen of his pink eye catching in the light. It was pretty bad.
Sherlock's breathing had not yet evened out, but he was lying still and seemed peaceful. What was the harm in letting him stay?
How would one soothe a child in such a state of distress? He was hugging, rocking, whispering, trying his best to make him feel loved and safe.
talk. I am a very good doctor and I care about you very much. Sometimes traumatic things happen to people that lead to very strong fears and anxieties. You didn't do anything wrong and the way you're feeling right now is not your fault."
. The marks on his chest and neck must have been quite visible even in the dim light. He could feel his cheeks coloring. John was their brother?
"Yes." She smiled and shifted the infant, looking back to the fire so that her friendly face was fully illuminated. "I was bound for Australia when... I... came here instead. It's been several years now. This is my child, Nikau. Hau and Kai are also my children, they are sitting over there with their aunties."
. A flutter of embarrassment, of regret, touched his stomach. It had been several days since he woke up in bed with his flatmate. They hadn't talked about it, John hadn't offered any more explanation or details of Sherlock's nighttime outburst because Sherlock hadn't asked. The hopeless pair had simply carried on life as they always did.
Two more days passed that Sherlock spent with the Island People. He missed John terribly and tried not to show his sadness and disappointment that John had not come back for him yet. He did his best to learn as much as he could. He learned many dozens of words and phrases from Molly and practiced speaking with the women. He expressed gratitude to them for keeping him safe and he did his best to help them in their work rebuilding what the storm had taken away. He learned their ways of preparing food and weaving grasses into matts and crafting a cloth they called kapa from plant fibers. He watched the men rebuild houses from a distance, noting how they carefully wove and twisted the coconut fiber ropes between many layers of palms and grasses.
Sherlock's blinks continued, causing John to smile a little more. He had seen Sherlock do this before when he was presented with new information that seemed to disagree with previous observations. John reached for Sherlock's free hand, gently unclenching his fist so he could hold Sherlock's sweaty palm.
Sherlock clutched at John, burying his wet face against John's chest. He didn't say anything, instead, his gasps and sobs escalated. It certainly seemed like yet another sleep disturbance. John was at a loss- what could he do? "Oh, sweetheart," John held him tight. "It's OK, you're alright, I've got you." He continued to hold him firmly, gently stroking his back and whispering assurances. At one point he leaned back, brushing the damp curls away from Sherlock's face so he could see his eyes. The blue-green irises, visible just barely in the low light, were unfocused  and unseeing.
"Sure, Sherlock," John said as he scooted back towards the wall and lifted the blanket, providing a clear invitation to his flatmate to come in under the warm covers. Sherlock crossed the room and climbed into bed. John noticed Sherlock had brought his own pillow when he placed it next to John's and settled himself into bed, lying on his side facing him.
John rutted up against Sherlock's thigh. He was so hard. He shifted all his weight to his right elbow and ran his left hand down Sherlock's chest. When he reached the bottom of his t-shirt, he reached up underneath it, running his palm over the smooth skin and firm muscle. John's hand slid back down past his navel to the sparse hairs at the waist of his pajama bottoms and paused. He opened his eyes, which he hadn't realized he closed, and leaned back to see Sherlock, breaking the kiss in the process.
Basking in the warmth of his release, Sherlock emerged more fully from sleep to gaze up at the open blue pre-dawn sky, dotted with a few remnants of the night's stars. Feeling comfortable and relaxed, Sherlock turned on his side to face the ocean.
So, Sherlock made preparations to undertake the journey. The moon had been rising early and was very full, so he was not concerned with disembarking so late in the day, as long as he returned to the beach by dark, he knew he could make his way. He put on his old trousers, which were now frayed very short and really quite in need of mending, and tied the knife that John had given him to the waste. He ate and drank enough to sustain him for several hours, though he was confident he could find freshwater and fruits along the way. He covered each foot with thick leaves and a portion of sailcloth, tying the layers into place loosely with a length of plant fiber rope. Satisfied with the design of his improvised shoes, he took them off to carry with him down the beach until he ventured up the craggy rock streambed. He also carried with him a notebook and a pencil.
Sherlock had woken that morning to a pleasant breeze and the great relief of seeing his friend resting in the shallows alongside where he slept beneath his sailcloth canopy.
When they are not swimming together or sharing a meal, the unlikely pair simply sit together on the beach. John rests with his octopod parts in the sea while Sherlock rests on the dry sand. As one might expect of an octopod, John is a very tactile creature, relying first and foremost on his sense of touch. When they sit together, John will occasionally reach out with a tentacle to touch at Sherlock's hands or face, demonstrating the importance of touch in his abilities to assess the human's condition.
Sherlock alternately spoke with Molly and sat quietly, at one point even napping for a short time. When asked by one of the children what he had in his bundle of belongings, he showed her his notebooks. John had taken them all and even included a writing pencil that had been closed between the pages. How fortuitous, Sherlock realized, as he could write down each word that Molly taught him together with the English translation. He was very good at learning languages, but this would allow him to expand his vocabulary with even more efficiency.
John replaced the cap and put the bottle down on the table next to him. He rested his empty hands on his knees.
Sherlock has still never heard his companion speak. Instead, they have devised a repertoire of hand signals, Sherlock teaching John to understand the spoken English word for each one, as his hearing seems equal to any human's. The words in their vocabulary grow each day, as John is very intelligent. The words between them include fish, fire, swim, cold, hungry, later, yesterday, palm frond, sleep, turtle, shark, land, sunrise, sunset, freshwater, fruit, go back, rope, boat, Island People, clothes, and several others.
"Nothing, really. You just moved the chairs around. You were interested in the fireplace, but didn't say why. You were only up a few minutes before you went back to your room." John didn't elaborate that he had taken Sherlock back to bed himself.
Sherlock was roused from sleep by wet hands bracing at his shoulders. He opened his eyes to see John towering over him, his octopod eyes dark with anxiety. He hoisted Sherlock from his bed so quickly that Sherlock was momentarily dizzy, and carried him straight to the water where he placed him in a canoe. The craft Sherlock found himself sitting in was quite a bit larger than the last that John brought to him. It was outfitted with a single outrigger and multiple seats so it would fit at least 6 men.
from downstairs. He jumped up and descended the stairs towards Sherlock's room. The sleep-heavy tone of Sherlock's voice had not inspired his sense of danger, but instead activated his instincts as a caregiver.
Sherlock's lips were red and wet. A high blush graced his cheeks and he was breathing a bit heavily. He looked debauched and it was the most alluring thing John had ever seen.
, John bottomed out and paused. He opened his eyes and stared deep into Sherlock's. John was a rather experienced man, but he had never experienced anything quite like this before. He felt completely connected and he wanted to stay like this. There was no urge to rush forward, to finally be given the permission to thrust, to race towards the obvious conclusion. Just like this, here, with Sherlock, John was satisfied.
He flipped the cap of the lube open and squeezed a generous amount into the palm of his right hand. He let it warm before covering his left index and middle fingers, then stroked the rest along the base of Sherlock's cock as he pulled his mouth off. This next bit required a little more concentration.
Sherlock reached the confluence of the stream with the sea and donned his leaf and sailcloth shoes. He searched the shallow waters for signs of John one last time, and seeing none, he began his journey up the streambed.
"Yah, sure," John replied. He picked up the newspaper that he hadn't a chance to read yet and scanned the front page headlines. Sherlock knew John was there for him when- if- he wanted to talk.
It was Sunday morning, going past 8 o'clock, and John was just opening his eyes to the subdued sunlight filtering past the curtains of his bedroom window upstairs at Baker Street. Despite usually being an early riser, he had worked the past 5 days in a row at the clinic and he was ready for a few days off and a little extra rest.
Sherlock found the King and Queen in their room, donning their coats and hats. As soon as she noticed her son, the Queen smiled and opened her arms. Sherlock walked silently into her hug.
This fact shocked and embarrassed Sherlock in equal measures. How could he, a man with a whole wing of his Mind Palace dedicated to the cataloging of every aspect of John Watson, have this enormous, unforgivable gap in his knowledge?
John kept his eyes fixed on the celling as Sherlock laid his head back on his own cold pillow. Was he blushing?
!” Mrs Hudson finished her song, thrusting her arms out with gusto. Harry threw her head back and mewled in support. Sherlock clapped politely.
“You don’t tell her what to do,” the ice harvester said, brandishing a camp knife. "Get ready to jump, Harry!”
“Go away, Sherlock.” Mycroft distant voice cut through his song. The coldness in his tone left no room for debate.
Hearing John’s voice, Harry stood up and mewled, frantically sniffing at the upturned snow around her. Sherlock ran to her side and found her nosing John’s last bag. Inside it, he found Angelo’s gifts - a pickaxe and a length of rope - and gave silent thanks to the generous merchant. Summoning everything he knew about nautical knots, he took the items and quickly tied the rope around the pickaxe’s handle.
He gasped when his back collided with one of the courtyard’s fountains, instinctively grabbing the stone edge for balance. Too late did Mycroft realize his mistake. His hand froze the dark stone, spreading the frost across the water and up the gentle jet, turning it into a menacing twist of jagged icicles that towered over the crowd.
He stepped around the mess of papers on the carpet with a spring in his step and laid the suit carefully on the upturned bed, humming a happy tune.
Sherlock felt right about ready to crawl out of his skin. He had to break the awkward silence. “John, I really didn’t mean to-”
Hypothesis: John only snores when sleeping in a bed. And that was something Sherlock had never witnessed until now, not fully.
that there are forces, however abstract, determined to bring Sherlock down. It’s very much in line with John’s last scene in TBB. We can see that he is worried, that he is realizing that there is
The other interesting thing about this post is that they did go to the chinese restaurant Sherlock had suggested at the end of the episode.
. Again, Harry is the first to contribute to her brother’s posts. From her text, I assume she is trying to stop drinking again.
A peal of laughter erupted from Sherlock’s chest, melting away his anxiety. He smiled at John and found the man smiling tentatively back at him, as if unsure that his vulgar joke would sit well with his royal companion.
As much as Sherlock hated proverbs, that particular one had been rattling around his brain for the last two hours - approximately the time when he had lost all feeling in his fingers - and he had to admit there was some truth to it.
They kept their steady march through the mountain path, the snow crunching rhythmically under their feet. The few trees around them were devoid of any birds and no other animals crossed their path as they climbed ever upward. All was quiet but for the wind, blowing steadily from the north, and although the sun shone happily in the cloudless sky, the air had a strange, charged heaviness to it that reminded Sherlock of those moments of eerie calm before a particularly heavy storm.
John fixed the prince with his most commanding stare. “Go back to bed, you maniac! You should be resting.”
All of a sudden, a white shadow came into shape a few feet below the surface. John leaned forward to try and make it out. Slowly, the shadow grew fins and a billowy tail and John realized he was looking at an enormous fish. It’s movements were calm and mesmerizing and its scales shone silver and blue where they caught the sunshine. The fish danced in and out of sight as it hid under the ice, only to appear again in the sunlit water. So entranced was John by his discovery that he didn’t hear the cracking under his hands.
That wasn’t exactly what he thought John would pick up from his account, but he was happy to explain. “My partner, Prince James of the Éiren Isles,” he said, puffing his chest with pride.
In their room, they took turns to use the bathroom and change into their sleeping clothes. When Sherlock emerged from the bathroom, John was already lying on the left side of the bed, thumbing through his phone.
The hurt look on Jim's eyes was like water to the flame of his impotent rage, and the prince felt his cheeks warm with embarrassment. Too unsettled to do anything about it, Sherlock turned away from his friend and bounded up the stone steps back to the courtyard, his laboured breath escaping his lips in white puffs of air.
The snow woman’s eyes sparkled with delight as she recognized the man in front of her. “Sherlock! My stars, how you’ve grown!” she tottered happily towards the prince, reaching out to hold his hands in hers. He offered them without protest, amazed at how her skeletal hands could hold his own so tenderly.
“I’m sorry, dear,” Mrs Hudson said, shaking her head. “Last time I saw your brother we were all playing in the Ballroom, remember? What fun we had!” Sherlock nodded encouragingly, although he had no idea what she was on about.
The older brother took a deep breath before launching into his explanation. “Carl Powers was a trusted business advisor of the Gaulian ambassador to Londondalle. The bizarre circumstances of his death, combined with the failure of Londondalle’s authorities to explain them, put a severe strain on our diplomatic relations with Gaulia. The Gaulian Prime Minister accused us of not doing enough to solve the case and the trade between our two Kingdoms all but ceased since then.”
In a completely extra touch, she adds that one of Mrs Turner’s lodgers (the married ones, remember?) is trying to get her to join Facebook.
He leaned over the table as he willed his heartbeat to slow down. He would get through this. No one would notice if he was quick enough, if he stayed in control. He could hold it together for one day.
Sherlock raised his hands reverently into the air and the colourful aura ran down his arms, covering his body and spilling onto the floor. Slowly, the colours spread all around him and, soon enough, everything around Sherlock was alive in a warm, colourful light. He tilted his head from one side to the other, making the colours dance. The desolate corridor now glowed in such vibrant tones that Sherlock couldn’t help but sigh in admiration.
“Haha, very funny,” John added in his normal voice, putting a hand over the strings to silence them. That was enough silliness for a day.
The growing sound of marching boots pulled Sherlock’s attention from the mirror to his window. Looking down he could see the Palace Guards slowly pouring into the courtyard in preparation to open the Palace’s gates. Even though he couldn’t see beyond the walls, Sherlock could make out the faint noise of the crowd gathering outside, laughing and singing, ready to step through the long closed gates and cheer for their future king.
On this second post, John vents a bit about his memorable row with the chip-and-pin machine at the start of the episode. Again, nothing too exciting about this post. It only drives home John’s grumpy, frustrated mood that he decides to complain on the interwebs about an annoyance he had that morning, despite having started a new possible murder case that very same day.
“Where you injured your left shoulder, yes, not your right leg.” Sherlock interrupted, no longer able to keep his deductions to himself, regardless of John’s stunned look. “Probably dislocated it, by the way you move it. I suppose you also broke a few ribs and won some interesting scars as a souvenir, but I’d need more data to confirm this. My point is, even if you had hurt your leg, I don’t see how it can suddenly become better, especially not after our daring escape from snarling death.”
Before he could say his fill, someone bumped into Sherlock’s back, causing his wine to spill over and fall to the ground with a splat.
“We’ve just foiled an assassination attempt against the Suomic Ambassador!” A shocked gasp traveled around the crowd, and Sherlock puffed out his chest, reveling in the sound. “Here’s the criminal,” he declared, giving his prisoner a shove. Still stunned, the man fell to his knees, struggling to keep his head upright.
The King stood over his family, deep in thought. After a few moments he muttered. “I know where we have to go.”
Jim’s posture deflated at Mycroft’s request, so Sherlock rushed to his partner's side. “No. Whatever you have to say to me, you can say it to Jim, too.”
John had everything he needed. He had Harry - the calf he raised by hand when his father was still a reindeer herder - and now he had a purpose. He would stay and help Mr Murray and he would learn how to be the best ice harvester in the Kingdom.
Things suddenly take a much darker tone when John admits that he does enjoy this life he and Sherlock
He concentrated on the memory but it refused to settle into a solid image. He definitely recalled playing in the snow… He remembered running in the garden, with the cedar trees around him, or were they marble columns...?
Sufficiently convinced, John laid back down and closed his eyes, falling asleep almost immediately. Sherlock remained still, looking expectantly at his flatmate’s sleeping form, but the snoring did not resume.
He brushed his hands on his robe and stood back to admire his work. Mycroft stood beside him with his arms crossed.
“Let’s get back to work!” John renewed his efforts to pick a single block of ice from the freezing water. This time he joined the song, trying to deepen his voice to match his companions.
Jim raised his chin and returned Sherlock’s cautious look with a sober gaze. "On my honour," he declared.
Of all the staff Sherlock had come to know, only Mrs Turner, the cook and the butler remained. The few remaining maids and footmen were replaced with new people, who stood nervously in the shadows, waiting for their orders.
Instead of reassuring the man, his response made him scowl even harder. “Oh, what possessed you to go outside in this storm!” Angelo lamented, “Dressed like this, no less!”
Sherlock held the object against the sunlight. Inside the clear glass he could see a small portion of a crystalline powder, white like fresh fallen snow.
“I’m looking for any suspicious activities that may lead to a criminal incident. If I can identify and ideally thwart said incident in front of all the guests, my brother will have no other option than to recognize my abilities and employ me as a full time detective,” the prince blurted out at full speed, closing his mouth with a snap when he was done.
“Monster! Seize the monster!” Anderson screamed once he regained his bearings, shuffling to hide behind the guards.
“Fine! Run away! That seems to be the trend, these days!” he yelled into the darkness, equal parts furious and ashamed.
Mycroft scowled at the memory. No, he had failed and now he must pay his dues. If he was still a king, this was his kingdom now, the only one he was fit to rule over. Endless expanses of snow and stone, with only the howling wind for company. He would rule over it until the ice claimed him at last.
He burrowed further under the duvet and took a deep, satisfied breath. Beside him, John turned on his side and started snoring in earnest.
Slowly, Sherlock’s laboured breaths became chuckles and then full laughter when he locked eyes with John across the snow. The ice harvester burst into breathless giggles himself, breaking Sherlock’s gaze to grin at the cloudless sky.
“We were playing, but then Sherlock fell, and I tried to save him, and I hit him with the magic instead - but it was an accident!” he explained in a rush, transferring his brother into his mother’s arms. “He won’t wake up!”
Reading had become an escape from his daily routine. Every day he could feel the weight of the Palace walls growing around him as the urge to know the outside world was becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. But when he read, his attention was lost inside the books. Every new bit of information became a new brick in his carefully built mental archive - his Mind Palace, he liked to call it, not without some pride. Every new room became a space for his mind to roam free, untethered by inane rules imposed by stupid people.
“What makes you think I need your money?” the ice-harvester asked with a raised eyebrow. He quickly regretted his decision when he saw a self-satisfied smile pulling on the corner of the prince’s lips.
His song was cut off abruptly when he slammed against the breast of a passing horse. The force of the impact threw Sherlock sideways, over the boardwalk and into a pile of nets on a moored fishing boat.
Sherlock reached over the side in a panic, only to realise that the ice harvester had managed to hold on to the back of the sledge, the wolf still stubbornly clinging to his arm. He scrambled for a solution before remembering an experiment from one of his physics books. Not wasting a moment, Sherlock reached for Mycroft’s cape and quickly folded it on itself, tucking the edges in his hand.
“I said I was sorry!” There was a hint of desperation in the King’s voice. “I made one mistake, one single mistake. But I sent him away…” His voice had lowered into an angry whisper and Sherlock had to strain to hear him. “I apologized and I’ve been apologizing every day since then. But your heart froze... and I don’t think there is anything I can do to melt it.”
“He may have had some qualms about letting a thirteen-year-old in on a murder investigation...” Mycroft explained while Sherlock read the first page of the pile.
Sherlock grumbled and stood up, straightening his jacket. After making sure he looked presentable again, he turned angrily around to give the man a piece of his mind, but whatever words he had died on his throat as he looked at his rescuer.
“Everything is secure,” he informed his brother as he finished his inspection. He was thoroughly ignored.
John found the two horses alone, tied to a moss covered tree stump and grazing idly on the stunted vegetation. They were well groomed, he noticed, with beautiful leather saddles and shiny brass stirrups. Their owners were probably very rich...
“A pickpocket!” the prince explained to the dumbfounded man, “I just saw him stealing from a man by the fishmonger’s stand! It’s the second, maybe third time he’s done it, as far as I can see.”
“Londondalle is in grave peril and I am the only capable of saving it,” Sherlock answered, slowly raising his eyes to lock with John’s accusing gaze. “I couldn’t lose any time sitting around planning a lovely little field trip.”
Sherlock felt his cheeks warm up under John’s disbelieving stare. “Well, we just met this morning,” he argued, “I couldn’t work out all the details before Mycroft pulled this stunt.”
The young prince walked the empty hall with some trepidation and knocked on his brother’s closed door.
Behind them, in the second row, sat an elderly couple, admiring the singers with raw delight. The man, with an impressive collection of medals pinned to his broad chest, was clearly a gambling addict, who had squandered -
His own little blizzard, Sherlock thought, despondently. Well, if he died from taking the concoction, at least he’d have the last consolation of tripping Mycroft with his corpse on his way out of his room.
In the first posts (pre 29th of January), she is repeatedly trying to reach out to John. Just like Sherlock later deduces
Releasing a shuddering breath, he grabbed a candlestick and a small porcelain bowl from the table. The touch of his bare hands on the objects sent a shudder through his arms, but Mycroft tightened his grasp and stood upright, turning around as he would do during the coronation ceremony.
Billy looked thoughtful for a moment as he scratched his chin. Sherlock realized Billy scratched himself a lot.
Please stay safe and enjoy my little contribution to making quarantine a bit more bearable. A big thank you to my lovely beta, CamillaCarmine!
The prince was happily going through his list of deductions when he realized he couldn’t hear John’s steps by his side anymore. In fact, as he turned around he found the ice harvester a few feet behind him, gaping at him and holding, an increasingly more confused Harry, by her lead.
The snow crunched under Mycroft’s boot with each unsteady step forward. The wind kept whistling angrily in his ear, pushing and pulling on his heavy cape and kicking up errant snowflakes into the air while he strained to keep his balance.
Sherlock's heart constricted in his chest at the sight the birds. He sang a bit more quietly to avoid disturbing the animals.
Jim scanned Sherlock’s eager face, as if trying to find any trace of dishonesty. After a few moments of silence, his eyes lit up again. “That’s good to know…" he said, suddenly shy. "Mind keeping me company for a bit? You’re the only interesting person I’ve talked to all evening.”
He had been making his way through the wilderness for the better part of four hours, mind focused only on escaping as far as his weakening legs would take him. As he walked on, the dense, dark forest had slowly given way to shallow vegetation, until there was nothing around him except for a flawless blanket of shimmering white snow.
“Suit yourself, I’m going back to sleep.” John announced and laid back down, tucking his blanket firmly around himself. After a few seconds he added, “By the way, Harry snores.”
Feeling a bit less restricted, Sherlock curled into himself as tight as he could, trying to chase after the warmth that had filled his chest only a few hours prior.
Mycroft allowed himself to smile back, feeling as if a tremendous weight had come off of his shoulders. He had made it!
Preliminary conclusion: John did not always snore. Not even in his own bed, where he would feel the most secure, and therefore, relaxed. Neither recognized relaxants like alcohol and post-coital status influenced the muscle tonus of his soft palate and pharynx.
“You’re freezing!” the man exclaimed, his worried eyes dancing over the prince’s face. “Come sit by the fire, I’ll bring you a blanket, no, two! Maybe some cocoa!”
Sherlock crossed his arms. “I would be doing us all a favour. One less assuming idiot roaming the Earth,” he grumbled.
“Yes!” he answered, delighted. Under him, the suspect groaned into the carpet and tried to shuffle away from Sherlock’s grasp.
!” Sherlock sang quietly as he looked from behind one of the many marble columns that framed the long hallway. He raised his hand in silent warning as he spotted their suspect, hiding behind the column in front of theirs. The prince felt Jim’s warm breath on his ear when the shorter man strained to look over his shoulder.
“It’s… It’s Sherlock, he’s out of control!” Mycroft answered, wringing his hands. He made another lap back to the window.
With a sad smile, Mycroft allowed himself one last bit of sentimentality. He pointed at the snow beside him and drew a circle with his hand, willing it to form the shape of Mrs Hudson, the snow-woman, from her snowy bun to her lopsided skirt. She smiled vacantly at Mycroft, her icy arms stretched wide. If she only knew how life had changed since the last time he had seen her.
“See? You’re good...” his father smiled at him. He kept his warm hands around his son’s gloved ones and kneeled down in front of him. “Conceal it,” he recited, holding his gaze.
he leaned towards the reindeer, who raised her ears in recognition, but kept working through her carrots.
“And you were ready to move in with prince what’s-his-face,” John riposted, leading the pair into another wave of laughter.
The stable was empty except for a couple of farming tools resting against a corner and a few haystacks neatly piled in the center of the room. It certainly wasn’t as comfortable as the trading post, but it was dry and safe from blizzards and entitled idiots.
“Just brilliant, thanks,” the prince deadpanned, wishing to cut the conversation short. He pushed on the window to close it but Billy stopped him with a hand against the window pane.
Suddenly, he noticed that his vision was becoming blurry. Looking at the windowpane, he realized that there was frost climbing steadily up the window, not from the cold weather outside but from his own hands, freezing the windowsill where they touched it. He stepped back from the window, horrified. He didn’t mean to do that at all.
“I’m sorry sir, but you asked for a double bedroom, didn’t you?” she looked anxiously between Sherlock and the printouts in her hand.
“Mycroft? What’s wrong? What happened?” he asked, barely controlling his anxiety. Instead of giving him an answer, his brother directed his attention to the strange man with a tilt of his head. The man kept his eyes fixed on the floor as he clutched his woolen hat nervously between his thick hands.
“Don’t bother, thanks,” Sherlock interrupted, “my hands are still working.” He snatched the suit from one of the dumfounded footmen and slammed the door in their faces.
“Wolves! Harry, leg it!” John cried out, tugging on Harry’s reins. The reindeer broke into a gallop and jerked the sledge into motion, making Sherlock lose his balance and fall back on the sledge’s floor.
“Careful, Johnny! You don’t want to end up like old Paul over there!” Danny pointed to the man across from him. He looked old to John’s young eyes, but he wasn’t a day over forty-two. His face, burned from years of working in harsh conditions, was etched with deep lines around his eyes and mouth, and whenever he took off his hat, you could see he was missing the top of his left ear and much of his right one.
