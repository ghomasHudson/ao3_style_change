Sammy, ever the smart one, figured out an approximate location of Anna's grace from the date she was conceived as a human baby and the area she lived in as a human, searching back in the records to see if there were any astronomical abnormalities. Dean spent the research time talking with Anna, she bandaged his ribs and he found her surprisingly funny, and refreshing. She really hadn't been lying when she said she wasn't like the other angels. Dean couldn't imagine Castiel ever smiling with him like this. He regretted it almost as soon as he thought of the angel, his stomach flipping so hard he had to sit down, and Anna watched him and kneeled beside him, placing a gentle hand on his forehead.
"Did you kill them?" Dean asked, and his voice was more quivery than he had expected it to be, heart dropping into his stomach at the thought of his mate dead.
his mind so helpfully reminded him.
. What the FUCK kinda name is that?” Sam smirked, and gave his brother an awkward one armed hug.
"Yeah, okay, Chuckles," Dean muttered, and Castiel almost cracked a smile at the fearless way Dean spoke even to angels he didn't know. Dean turned to fix his gaze on Castiel, and the angel drew a deep breath he didn't technically need, hands clenching. "Who's your friend?" Dean asked, his eyes narrowed, and Castiel swore he could sense jealousy in his tone. Uriel's gaze bore into Castiel's back, and he neatly avoided the question to avoid reassuring his mate of his affections.
Dean had Castiel mojo a TV and blu-ray player into the cabin so he could show Cas some movies, and other shows. He found himself watching Castiel more than he was watching the films, studying his face with some amusement. Castiel watched movies like he didn't understand what was going on, his brow furrowed and head tilted in confusion. During Star Wars, Dean had asked Cas if there was something he didn't get, and the angel had looked at him and told him he knew for a fact there was no such universe and if someone like Darth Vader actually existed the angels surely would have smited him a long time ago. He then followed up the statement by asking if Darth Vader had ever showed any signs of being demonic. Dean had snorted a laugh and changed the movie to something not so science fiction. They discovered Castiel liked action films, especially Indiana Jones, even though parts of that confused him too.
"We've all done things we've gotta pay for," was all Dean could think to say, swallowing the lump in his throat. He almost flinched as Anna reached for him, leaning in as if about to kiss him, and Dean stiffened, body taunt as a bow, and he turned his head away. "Sorry," Dean muttered, "I mean..." Anna smiled at him, and yeah, she was beautiful, but her eyes weren't that ethereal shade of blue, there was no chiseled jaw or shadow of stubble, no jet black sex hair, and Dean just couldn't touch her. His skin crawled and he jerked away, afraid for a second he would throw up.
"Are you all right?" Castiel murmured, lightly brushing Dean's cheekbone.
"Dean, we could use Sam on this," Bobby said, brow furrowed in concern, clearly against the idea as a whole.
Dean had decided the only thing worse than finding out there was a whole book series written about him was trying to prove he was a hardcore fan of said books written about him. Not that it was hard; after all, they knew themselves for the most part, but this publisher chick was annoying as hell and all Dean wanted was to get the information and get out. Sam was handling it better, so Dean let him talk unless the chick's impromptu quiz asked questions about “Dean.” Back and forth it went, Sam desperately trying to convince her they were die hard fans, and Dean doing his best to not roll his eyes and brandish a gun and demand answers. Finally, and stupidly enough, it was the tattoos that the girl accepted as fan proof, they received the author's actual information, and Dean stomped out to the car, cracking his knuckles. “That dude is soooo fucking
By the time the Winchester brothers cross paths with Anael, Castiel had been tracking Dean's health and whereabouts daily. He's careful about it, stealing away to keep tabs on his mate when the rest of the garrison is otherwise occupied, and always returning before they realize he's gone. The angel had never felt this emotion before; granted, as an angel he didn't normally feel a wide range of emotions anyway, but the feeling that currently resided in his grace was strong and acrid and wholly unpleasant. It made him feel faintly ill each time he saw Dean and the human looked a little worse; Dean was losing weight and had developed a cough, the golden skin Castiel had so lovingly crafted was now consistently paler than usual. The angel knew why it was happening, bond withdrawal was well documented in human history, but the fact it was happening to his mate and he could do nothing about it was driving Castiel insane. He couldn't force Dean to accept him or listen to reason, and so he hovered instead, keeping track of Dean's vital signs and trying to keep the hardest hunts and monsters out of his path. When Michael called Castiel and Uriel back to heaven, Castiel was sure he had finally been found out, that Dean's symptoms had finally become severe enough that the angel's superiors had noticed.
"John Winchester. Made a good name for himself. A hundred years. After each session, I'd make him the same offer I made you. I'd put down my blade if he picked one up," Alistair told him gleefully, apparently pleased with the fact that he now had Dean tense.
"That's why we've come to his student. You happen to be the most qualified interrogator we've got," Uriel sounded disgusted by the whole idea, and Dean wanted to hit him.
Instead of having the desired effect of calming his mate, Dean's expression grew stormy and he glared at Castiel. "Get out of here. There's no such thing," the human spat the words like venom. Castiel could now honestly say he had no idea what was going on. There were several things at play here that did not make any sense. Vessels were always chosen because of two things, bloodline and devoutness. The fact that Dean Winchester was
, the voices of the host supplied. He blinked his multiple pairs of eyes, mouth opening, and the first thing he said was “
“What? No! I'm a writer!” Chuck said, and his voice was rapidly turning pleading. Dean realized with a bit of pleasure that they were scaring the dude. “What do you even
Dean was anxious and eager, and yet he really didn’t want to know at the same time. He was a hunter, raised that way his whole life alongside his brother Sammy, and he didn’t think he wanted to drag any girl into this world. He might be lonely, but at least his conscience was clear. He didn’t think any woman would want this life.
Castiel spoke to Uriel, and the feeling that something was wrong increased exponentially. Castiel decided to talk to the only angel who might understand his predicament.
"That's not what I meant," Castiel explained, "Uriel is dead."
"She's alive on Earth," Michael sounded annoyed, which was never a good sign, "the chosen vessel is with her currently. I need you both to go find her, and end her existence." Castiel inhaled sharply, head snapping around to look at Uriel, who remained impassive and dutiful as ever. Orders were orders; Castiel needed to remember that. "Take this," Michael's voice boomed, and a long spindly arm made of light handed a little vial to Uriel, "it's Anael's missing grace. Keep it safe at all costs. Do you understand?"
Castiel stepped into his space, and reached for Dean, touching him for the first time, hand running down his cheek and jaw in a caress that left Dean a bit breathless, skin tingling and head clear for the first time in weeks. "You're meant for me, you know," Castiel murmured, and Dean leaned closer, eyes half shut.
"SHUT YOUR EYES!" Anna shouted, a sharp bright light and piercing noise cutting through the din, and Sam and Dean hunched over, covering their faces, and when they looked up all the demons, including Alistair, were gone, and Anna was nowhere to be found.
Cas nodded, and while a single tear ran down his cheek, he saw in his mind the blonde who smiled at him.
"Empty."
The urologist, an older man with a slight belly and graying hair, gestured for him to sit down, but his sympathetic and friendly nature did not soothe Cas's heartbeat.
"Sammy. I'm dying," Dean whispered, beginning to breathe heavily.
Immediately Dean checked to see if anything had been stolen, but that was not the case, but instead found a cell phone that was not his.
"Stop the gobbledygook and tell me what that means to my husband? Does he have to undergo surgery again?!"
Neither of them said a word and yet there was so much on both of them because neither knew whether the other felt the tingling sensation either. But to find out, one had to take the first step. Only that was not so easy, because for Cas it was so long back that he had felt so for a man and Dean knew how the others talked about him. After all, he was known everywhere as Casanova. At that moment he would have preferred that he was not. That's why he wanted to do it right with Cas, did not want to scare him, tried to make him feel like he was not a one-night-stand.
An occupational therapist also checked him. Count the months backward, mental math, reminder tests. This worked out well, which was not self-evident because sepsis could damage the brain and lead to losses.
Dean looked at her seriously and waited for an answer.
Shaking her head, she motioned silently to the stairs and ordered with a forceful voice to contact Sergeant Voight, immediately.
"What exactly are you trying to tell me?" He grinned, tickling him until he begged for mercy.
"If you did not play for the pink team, I'd kiss you," he whispered, but the rest of the sentence went down in a cough.
"Adam," Voight repeated. "Kid, it was an honor. They were one of the best. "
At first, he was angry because after all both were grown up and one could talk about such things. After a few hours, he got a restless feeling. He did not know why, but that feeling that something was wrong did not let him go.
"Well, what do you say. Best idea ever. Thanks again, man."
Cas bent over him, ran his lips along the line of his chin before he snuggled closer and pressed their mouths together.
"It took me a few minutes to get in here," he replied cheekily.
"Cas my dear, is it possible that you are in love?"
"Damn Novak. Stay here!"
"Adam," the policewoman sobbed, shaking her head in tears as he tried to calm her down.
"Carry on," the dark blonde grinned, squeezing him even closer and pulled the blanket over him.
Ok, admitted. The two had already managed to make that angel a bit more relaxed, but under 'celebrate', Dean understood something different. Girls, booze and lots of fun.
"It was by far one of the best gifts."
"And why are your hair wet too?"
But when he saw Dean's disappointed face, he added that in every phase of a drowsy or deep sleep, the subconscious was present - as with any living person.
With all his strength he clung to the older man, like a drowning man, because the dark-blond had the feeling that the ground under his feet had been pulled away.
Sam's arm pulsed and glowed red and moaning in pain, he drew the knife. In short, he spoke the spell and cut Cas free. With questioning gestures, Gabriel wanted to know where Dean was.
"He isn't deciding anything. He's a mouthpiece, a conduit for the inspired word." Castiel explained the best he could in words that Dean's mostly non religious upbringing would understand. Dean gave him an unreadable look for a moment, as if he was deciding whether to believe him or not.
“I dunno, Castiel. Our Father must have a plan. He always does, you know that. But, it IS very weird. I mean, when angels do couple, it’s always to each other,” Gabriel shrugged massive shoulders, “don’t worry so much, bro. It will all fall into place.”
Dean straightened, eyes narrowing, and the muscles in his arms and hands were twitching as though he was attempting not to move. "Some angel you are," Dean's voice was a bit wobbly, though Castiel couldn't tell if that from the display of his wings or the mating instincts battering at him like they were screaming inside Castiel right now, "you burned out that poor woman's eyes."
Anna talked with Castiel, claiming he had no idea of emotion, of the feelings of being sorry. She spoke of orders, of permanence, of the obedience of a soldier. Dean could relate, and he watched Castiel, posture slumped and sorrowful. Dean thought to himself that Cas might be feeling more emotion than he should angelically be feeling.
"You guys don't walk enough," Dean told Cas, "you're gonna get flabby." Castiel just stared at Dean, one hand reaching for him in a pleading manner. Dean took a step forward and then paused. "You know, I'm starting to think junkless has a better sense of humor than you do," the human told Castiel, frowning.
“Well, I'm not ready yet, so...” Dean shifted Castiel up and rolled over underneath him, tilting his hips up in an offering, and he heard Cas gasp quietly.
" Your plan isn't gonna work, Sammy. Since when did demons ever want to spill their guts to us in the non literal sense?" Dean scowled, eyebrows raised. Sam huffed in annoyance and Bobby was wearing his typical grizzly frown. "This is the only way. We gotta call...the whatever the hell it is," Dean trailed off, and Sam caught the painfully obvious attempt to avoid saying the name that had haunted his brother for years. He opened his mouth to says something to Dean that would probably end up being sappy and girly, and Dean quickly cut him off before he could. "I'm gonna take a nap. Crawling out of graves is exhausting," Dean announced, sinking onto the pull out couch of the motel and shutting his eyes. He hadn't been lying, and when Sam was sure his brother had drifted off, he took the keys and climbed into the car, driving to find some demons.
Turns out, Cas is still always right. Dean was never going to get this leverage off his head. Cas was goddamn lucky he loved him.
This was a
Dean was kinda pissed off, honestly. He and Sammy had gone to investigate a routine haunting, and had run into a much,
"Yes. When we discovered Lilith's plan for you, we laid siege to hell and we fought our way to get to you before you-" Castiel broke off, his own voice cracking, and cleared his throat, "We were... I was too late." Never would Castiel get over the guilt for the pain his mate had to carry because he had been too slow in his rescue.
"Yeah, way to make me feel good about being in my thirties, Cas," Dean looked amused and not angry though, so Cas ignored the comment and ran fingers through sandy colored hair.
Castiel awoke in the heavens, and stretched his great wings, several pairs of them sprouting from a colossal form made of energy and light. His brothers’ and sisters’ voices echoed in his head, calling and rejoicing at the creation of another of them,
"You're somethin' else, Cas," Dean replied with a smile, "you really are." He gave him one more kiss and made his way to the door, and Castiel couldn't help the warmth filling his grace as he flew away.
Dean had woken up in Bobby's beat up car, and everything ached, especially his chest and his ears. Dean cleaned himself up with a spare cloth and looked at Bobby, eyes wild and fierce.
"Don't strain yourself," Ruby sighed sarcastically, but she didn't seem overly hostile. Anna interrupted by asking about her parents, and Sam looked at Dean quickly before kneeling next to her and whispering apologies. Dean rubbed his temples; he knew no amount of sympathy would ever take that pain away. Anna looked on the verge of tears when her head snapped up suddenly, hair flying, and she looked wide eyed at Sam and Dean.
"Yup," he replied, short and to the point. He was running out of patience.
"You sure you did the ritual right?" Dean's voice was bored, eyeing the entrance to the warehouse, looking around at the sigils painted everywhere, the large devil's trap near the entrance. Bobby just gave him his "don't mess with me idjit" look, and Dean sighed. "Sorry, touchy touchy, huh?"
“Please, wait,” he said weakly, “please, don't hurt me.”
"Why'd you do it?" Dean's voice was no more than a whisper, and he was trembling so much that Castiel ached with it, and he responded the way any angel might to avoid the temptation to touch his grace mate.
“What do you mean? I don’t understand. Dean is not an angelic name; how could I possibly be grace mates with someone named Dean if Father has not created them?” Castiel put on a burst of speed and drew even with his older brother.
"Why?" Castiel spoke slowly, as if he couldn't believe his ears, "it's not blame that falls on you, Dean, it's fate. Not to mention the fact I couldn't have left you there if I tried. The minute I saw you, touched your soul, that was the minute I became yours. Being without you seemed... and still seems... the worst idea I could ever think of. I belong to you, whether or not you ever return the sentiment, and I will remain close by until the day you tell me yes, and then every day after."
It looked like a bomb had gone off in the vicinity. the trees were flattened, grass destroyed. Dean quickly took it all in, and following his instincts he hightailed it out of the vicinity.
"She's even worse than the abomination you've been screwing," Uriel added, and Castiel could tell he was seconds away from killing everyone in the room just to make it easier, "now hand us the girl."
, his grace whispered to him,
"Him? Really?" Dean pointedly looked at the alcohol bottles and Castiel bit his tongue to remind Dean of his own similar issue. At least he could clean out Dean's body whenever he healed it. That would have to do to settle Castiel's protective instincts for now.
"Yeah well get some fucking donuts or something while you're out," Dean snipped, and Uriel boomed a laugh.
"I wish I couldn't feel a damn thing, Sammy," Dean told him, voice thick with tears, "I wish I couldn't feel a goddamn thing."
"You've gotta be fucking kidding me," Dean and Chuck spoke so simultaneously and in the same exact tone that it almost sounded rehearsed. Cas wrinkled his brow in confusion, head tilting to the side in what Dean referred to fondly as his "puppy dog look."
This has been abandoned for quite some time and I honestly don't know if i will still have readers. I'll spare you the gory details of my life, but I can promise I WILL be working on this fic again, hopefully a chapter a week, but that's up in the air. Thanks for the ultimate waiting challenge, guys!
"It's two am somewhere," Dean muttered, and Anna put a hand on his shoulder.
"What kind of specialist?" Dean's voice was harsh, face hard, "what are you gonna do?"
“I'm Dean, this is Sam,” Dean told the man, face dark and stormy, “The Dean and Sam you've been writing about.”
. He reached down for the angel, pulling him up to kiss him again, this time tasting himself along with the electric taste that was Castiel. He tugged at the angel's trademark trench coat, and placed little nips along Cas' jaw, “Cas. Clothes. Mojo. Off. Now,” Dean told him, impatient, and Cas huffed a silent laugh and obliged, all his clothing disappearing the next moment. Dean pulled back and looked at his mate naked for the first time.
Oh. Castiel was starting to understand a bit more now. The Hunter in Dean was fighting the mate instincts. At least he could reassure Dean he meant no harm. "I'm an Angel of the Lord," Castiel replied, a little proud as he looked at Dean.
That got Dean's attention, and his head snapped up, looking at Castiel, "Demons? How are they doing it?"
Castiel was startled when the prophecy began to fall into place exactly as was predicted. The two brothers, of which the angels only knew the last name Winchester, were already being prepped to be vessels for the apocalypse. Michael was pleased, he wanted his brother dead once and for all. Many angels felt the passing shame that this war would likely destroy their Father’s whole creation. Castiel was one of them, he looked at the wonders the humans had created and felt sorry for them, so much tireless work and evolution would be gone in a day, maybe even hours. His Father had been silent and absent for hundreds of years now. They had no choice but to follow the prophecies. He fully expected the Winchesters were like every other vessel, chosen for religiousness and bloodline.
self image; he knew was pretty damn good looking, and he had never in his life had issues picking up women, but there was something different about baring your skin for your mate, showing him all of you and trusting he likes it. Add into account that Dean had never been with a man and had no idea where to even start, other than what he liked himself, and that created one nervous wreck. The only thing that made it even slightly better is that Dean knew Castiel had even less experience than him, but even that didn't seem to provide much comfort. So, Dean did the only thing he could- he stalled. He found a river running behind the log cabin and showed Castiel how to fish; Castiel didn't really understand the recreational value of it, when the angel could simply snap his fingers and the fish would literally leap out of the water onto the bank of the river. Dean couldn't remember the last time he laughed so hard.
Castiel looked alarmed, "where are you going?"
“I trust you, Cas,” Dean told him, and he'd actually be lying if he said the thought of angelic strength fueled sex wasn't a huge turn on. Castiel cleared his throat and leaned down, slowly kissing his way down Dean's spine, making him tremble, before grasping his hips and pushing him up onto his knees. Dean whimpered as Castiel parted his cheeks, and he threw back his head and cried out a moment later when something warm and wet and probing slid over his hole. After a second, Dean realized it was Cas'
"Yes, him. You should have seen Luke," Castiel silently thanked his absent father that he hadn't been in charge of that particular prophet. Alcohol and erotic writing had nothing on the unique habits that that particular prophet picked up on his travels. Dean just gave him a strange look that was a mix of frustration and amusement. "I don't know how prophets are chosen. The order comes from high up on the celestial chain of command. Very, very high."
"You are infuriating. Must you always talk with your fists?" Despite the words, Castiel's eyes softened, the wrinkles from his brow fading as he looked at him affectionately. "He must be protected because he is a prophet of the Lord."
Dean flushed at the implications of Castiel's statement, and he looked around at the cabin and the clearing. Everything was so green, even the trees had moss growing on them, and the air was clear and crisp. He inhaled deeply, relishing the clearness of his lungs and the lack of pain. "What about Sammy?" Dean asked, predictably worried about his brother.
"Ah, this one just won't quit, will he? I think I'm starting to like you, boy," Uriel looked a Castiel when he spoke, and Castiel clenched one fist, eyes glowing as he tried to control his temper. Dean watched Uriel vanish and shook his head.
Dean hung around the rundown vending machine outside their room trying to gather up the good sense enough to do what he was about to do. Despite the growing closeness he was feeling with Castiel, he'd never called to him before, and he honestly felt like an idiot. "Please, Cas. I need some help, so I'm praying, okay? Even though I feel stupid." There was a woosh of wings and there was his mate, standing far too close, not that that was anything unusual.
"This is Uriel, part of my garrison. He's a...specialist," Castiel said, glancing at Dean. Dean's hand slipped towards his gun, immediately on guard.
"Oh, fuck, come on," Dean grimaced, holding his stomach with a hand. Castiel twitched, and Dean eyed him carefully from the corner of his eye.
"Yeah," Dean sighed, and he sounded utterly exhausted, "I figured that much. I meant WHAT are you?"
Dean never felt great about stealing, besides the fact he had been doing it his whole life, it just never sat right with him. He stole out of necessity, out of the need to eat and drive and live. This situation was no different, and he felt only a pang of remorse as he broke into the small convenience store and swallowed bottles of water and granola bars in quick succession.
"What you're asking is not within my power to do, Dean," Castiel answered quietly, fingers playing with the cuffs of his trenchcoat.
"How about a reflex exercise? I've got a gun in my pocket right now. Come with me or we'll see who the quicker draw is, me or the angel," Dean stared seriously at Chuck, who slowly went white. Dean smirked, now he had him.
"It was disobedience," Castiel responded, with a weary sigh, "he was working against us."
"GO!" Castiel snarled, and Anna looked like she was about to argue, but shut her mouth and disappeared. Castiel wiped his eyes furiously.
"Of course..." Dean said weakly, and why did everybody have to know Castiel somehow? "So what, they were like your bosses or something?"
Dean had never been more pissed in his entire life. Or, if he had, he sure as hell couldn't remember it. "You're gonna smite the whole fuckin' town?!" Dean spluttered, brain whirling as his fists clenched and he glared at Castiel. The angel looked bereft, almost enough so to make Dean calm down, but Dean had always been stubborn.
Dean had never been more nervous in his entire life. He had never had problems with
"I’m not a…hammer as you say, I have questions, I have doubts. I don’t know what is right and what is wrong anymore, whether you passed or failed here. But in the coming months you will have more decisions to make, and I don’t envy the weight that’s on your shoulders, Dean. I truly don’t," Castiel told him softly, and Dean could hear the concern in his voice, the mate in him was calmed by it. Dean dug his fingernails into his palms, trying to keep from vomiting and passing out at the same time. "Dean..." Castiel said, voice whisper soft, "we should really talk about this. I understand human anatomy- I know how ill-"
"What's going on, Cas? Since when does Uriel put a leash on you?" Dean asked quietly, eyes shut as Castiel's nimble fingers traveled over the curve of his lips.
!” Dean snapped, officially at the end of his rope, and he grabbed the writer's arm and dragged him out towards the Impala, the man protesting the whole way. Dean let him go and flipped the trunk open, pulling out the compartment and showing Chuck the arsenal back there, watching the writer's face go pale.
"All I remember is waking up and I was me again," Jimmy shrugged, careless. Dean wanted to shake him by the stupid trench coat until he told him where Castiel was.
"Cas... please come home." Dean whispered, ignoring the blank feeling that told him the connection didn't exist, "come back to me."
Dean had never, and will never be a match for Alistair. Whether that was a product of inbred fear from hell, or simply the fact that he was a really fucking powerful demon, Dean didn't know, but he did know in a fair fight he'd get demolished a hundred times over. The boys barely escaped the church, the demon-bitch Ruby having fled with the girl who could hear angels, and Dean was currently sitting in a filthy motel room, on an equal disgusting bed, watching his brother sew up the cut on his own arm he'd received from tossing himself out a window. "So your demon buddy has her now. Is she seriously safe?" Dean was dubious, his instincts screamed at him to not trust anything from hell. Sam glanced at him, Dean was holding his arm awkwardly because of the dislocated shoulder, and noted the bags under his older brother's eyes.
"Don't worry, I'm not like the others," Anna said, face calm and poised for the first time since they had met her. "Castiel and Uriel are the ones who came for me? We kind of used to be in the same foxhole."
Uriel's lip curled in a sneer, "we can handle the demons, thank you very much."
Uriel laughed, proving Dean's point, and Castiel's fists clenched. "Anna's an innocent girl!" Sam piped up again, sounding almost as threatening as his brother, and he walked up to stand by Dean, imposing in height alone.
Zachariah decided to play a game with the Winchesters, and he sent them to an alternate universe where they didn't remember anything about their hunting life. Dean wasn't truly Dean, and it made Castiel extremely uncomfortable. Dean Smith was nothing of the snarky, temperamental, wonderful mess that was Castiel's mate, and even though Cas hovered nearby, there was no pull of the bond for either of them. Castiel hated that more than anything, and his grace ached with the absence. In the end, Dean came back to himself, as Zachariah had predicted, and Castiel couldn't help a wave of relief when Dean prayed for him later and greeted him with an enthusiastic kiss. Sam was less than thrilled at the impromptu make out session, but his brother was happy and Castiel could tell that made Sam happy too.
Alistair held Dean up against the wall by his throat, Dean's face demolished and bloody, and the demon sneered in disdain, "You got a lot to learn, boy. So I'll see you back in class bright and early Monday morning." Dean felt his vision start to go fuzzy, black around the edges, when he was abruptly dropped, inhaling air through his crushed windpipe with a gasp, and he caught sight of Castiel stabbing Alistair directly in the heart with Ruby's knife. Alistair looked down at the knife, watching it spark a bit before dying out, and he looked at Castiel, smirking, "looks like God is on my side today." Castiel twisted his hand and the knife twisted itself deeper into the demon's chest, making him gasp with pain. Alistair yanked the knife out, dropping it, and launched himself at Castiel. Dean reached a hand out, twitching, but he couldn't move any more than that, almost unconscious with the pain.
"You could just give her back her angel juice," Dean said reasonably, gut clenching as he resisted the urge to punch the angel.
“No more one night stands, huh, Dean?” Sam was teasing blatantly now, and Dean crossed his arms, glaring. “Fine, fine, wouldn't want him to come down here and smite me,” Sam raised his hands in surrender. “However, it's not going to be easy to find this guy. No tax record, no known address. I'm pretty sure Carver Edlund is a pen name,” Sam told him.
grab the iron easily from Bobby, and touch two fingers gently to the older man's forehead, dropping Bobby to the ground unconscious.
"Castiel," the angel replied, brow furrowing because he thought this should have been completely obvious to the human by now. Surely Dean knew his bond mate's name?
Dean went up against a siren. Castiel almost flew to him, almost forced him not to go, but Uriel appeared by his side, knowingly smiling, and turned to Castiel, "it would be a real shame if the vessel died before Michael could even enter it, wouldn't it?" Castiel ground his teeth together, clenched his fists so hard the knuckles cracked, and said nothing.
"You think I'm gonna tell you?" the archdemon tried to laugh, but it was choked off before he could.
"I'm hungry. I haven't eaten in... probably months," Jimmy just gave him a look, those blue eyes so familiar and alien at the same time. Dean shifted his weight, and Sam cleared his throat at the awkwardness.
The next time Castiel saw Dean Winchester, it was also under unpleasant and duty related circumstances. The raising of Samhain was well under way, and the boys had already been investigating when Castiel and his garrison mate Uriel were sent down to Earth with new orders to take care of the issue. As Castiel flew swiftly to the run-down motel room the Winchesters were staying at, he couldn't help but feel his grace leap at the closer proximity to his mate. He composed himself, instantly reminded he wasn't alone. Out of all his garrison, Uriel was bound to be the least accepting of this abnormal grace mating. Castiel still hadn't mentioned it to anybody, he was debating what to do about this situation himself, still absorbing what was going on. Each time he was around Dean it got harder and harder to control the urges of the mating, to not claim Dean as his.
“I believe it is both customary and more comfortable to do this on a bed,” Castiel said seriously, and Dean laughed, some of the tension broken.
"More private? We're inside my head," Dean spoke slowly, fear shivering lightly down his spine.
Every night, when Dean curled up to sleep, he debated asking Cas to "sleep" with him in the bed. The angel had informed him he did not require sleep, but Dean had always liked waking up with a warm body next to him. The only thing that kept him from asking was the fact that every morning since he'd been here alone with Castiel, he'd woken up with some of the worst hard ons in his life. He hadn't jerked off in the shower this much since he was a teenager. He also noticed that the longer he stayed with Castiel the better he felt, physically. His lungs were clear, cough was gone, no headaches plagued him, he was gaining back weight and muscle tone, and the sun outside was bringing color back into his skin. He felt better than he had in years, besides the sexual tension that was driving him insane. He started noticing the little things about the angel, the stiff way he held himself, the way his hair constantly looked like he had just crawled out of bed, and especially the color of his eyes when the sun hit them just right. Dean thought he could die looking in Castiel's eyes and be perfectly happy.
"The word... like the word of God? Like, Bible, new testament and all that?" Dean sounded much less upset at the knowledge that Chuck was not, in fact, controlling their lives. Castiel couldn't say he exactly blamed Dean for the sentiment.
“Dude, I can’t just pack up and leave,” Sam hissed, frowning, “I’ve got scholarship interviews in a few days.”
"That's not good enough!" Dean snapped, and his fist came up. In the next minute, a strong arm wrapped around his waist, and the slight shock of ozone filled his nose and surrounded his senses.
“I'm not doing anything!” the author's hands were in the air as if in surrender, and he was backing away rapidly.
"Sorry. Get yourself another one. Try JDate," Dean quipped, and Castiel winced, his mate's typical cockiness wasn't going to win any favors with Uriel.
"What the hell?" Dean whispered hoarsely, looking around the place.
The rattling of the roof panels was unexpected, and Dean's heart leapt into his throat, and he jumped up and looked around, focused, with his gun held firmly in his grasp. The doors to the main entrance rattled, and Dean and Bobby both whirled around, guns pointed at the door. The doors slammed open at the same time the light bulb fizzled out, the creature standing just beyond the entrance. Dean almost collapsed, because he knew.
"The witch knows who you are, too," Castiel practically growled the words, his teeth clenched as he imagined the beauty and quirks of his mate dead once more. Seeing Dean unmoving and cold and decomposing once was hard enough, Castiel wouldn't have been able to do it a second time. "The raising of Samhain is one of the 66 seals," Castiel continued, sensing Uriel shifting behind him. Dean immediately and predictably grew impatient.
, his mind told him, and he reached into the car and took a swig of bad whiskey from the bottle he kept in the glove compartment, Sam shooting him a bitchface. Dean pointedly ignored him; if he was going to deal with a throbbing headache he was allowed a drink or two. Of course, to top it all off, that was the moment Anna turned to them and simply said, "it's not here. Not anymore. Someone took it." Dean tossed the keys to Sam, climbed into the passengers seat, and proceeded to drink half the bottle of whiskey before passing out.
“Yeah, even after the publisher went bankrupt, but those books never came out,” the writer looked flighty again, and Dean stepped closer, “okay, wait, this is some... some kind of joke, right?”
“Well,” Chuck laughed nervously, backing away again, “I have to admit it, you guys really are my number one fans... so I think I've got some posters in the house-”
"That's not fair, Dean, and you know that," Castiel bit at a full bottom lip and glanced at the sky for a moment, "You must understand why I can't intercede, Dean. Prophets are special, and very protected." He dropped blue eyes to look at Dean, eyebrow slightly arched as if waiting.
"Pamela. You know, psychic Pamela? You remember her. Cas, you remember her. You burned her eyes out. Remember that? Good times. Yeah, then she died saving one of your precious seals. So maybe you can stop pushing us around like chess pieces for
Still, Dean was
So, Dean had to admit that Ruby was a little helpful sometimes, and when they made it to the cabin that the demon had stashed Anna in with no further issues, he decided to hold back the insults and questions for now at least. "I guess I owe you for Sam," Dean groused, voice gruff, "so... you know..."
"Out of the way," Uriel demanded, reaching as if to fling Dean out of his path. Castiel almost exclaimed out loud, reaching for Uriel to stop him, when Dean wavered to his feet, wobbly.
"You're not a hallucination," Chuck pointed out.
"But he said nein each and every time. Oh, damned if I couldn't break him," Alistair rambled, sighing as if he was insulted by this, "pulled out all the stops, but John, he was, well, made of something unique. The stuff of heroes. And then came Dean. Dean Winchester. I thought I was up against it again." Dean took several long drinks from a bottle of whiskey, likely put there by Castiel, and set it back down, picking up the holy water instead. "But daddy's little girl, he broke. He broke in thirty. Oh, just not the man your daddy wanted you to be, huh, Dean?" Alistair goaded, sly smirk on his face.
Dean didn't even need to think about that, he felt so sick and weak it was disgusting, and his broken ribs were making it hard to even breathe, "yeah, if you could, that'd be kinda nice."
"You've got to be kidding me," Sam rubbed his hands over his face and Chuck cleared his throat nervously.
Castiel sorrowfully watched his mate in the hospital bed, bandaged in every visible area, breathing tube forcing air into his lungs, and the order not to heal Dean rung in his head. Sam hadn't understood why Castiel couldn't mojo Dean back to normal, and if Castiel was being honest, he really didn't understand why he couldn't, either. The biggest question here, though, was how the devil's trap had broken. Castiel felt sorrow, and regret. He understood why humans were driven to extremes when overcome with this emotion. It was an aching, broken feeling, and he wanted nothing more than to grab Dean, heal him back to his beautiful self, and whisk him away from all this. He had let his mate down, and it was the worst feeling in the world.
"That's your problem, Dean," Castiel sighed, "you have no faith." It didn't take much effort on the angel's part to cause several quick, bright flashes of lightening, and he watched Dean's eyes widen as he glimpsed the shadows of the angel's wings splayed across the walls and ceiling of the run down warehouse.
"We need to find out what happened." Sam climbed from the impala and they drew guns as they walked along the rubble inside.
"So THIS is the guy who decides our fate?" Dean scoffed, although the tightness in his shoulder lessened a little at the touch. Castiel shook his head, his hand sliding to Dean's other shoulder to repeat the motion.
Dean woke with a start, feeling just as exhausted as when he had fallen asleep, and he pulled out a bottle of alcohol and took a long pull. Sam frowned at him, and Anna eyed him with concern.
, Michael decreed, his mighty voice practically shattered the heavens.  As much as Castiel disliked the idea of killing any of his brothers and sisters, he knew his duty, understood the need to protect his father's creations. Michael himself went down to this realm, and trapped Lucifer there forever, in a mighty battle, destroying so much that Castiel knew it would take hundreds of years to be replenished. With Lucifer caged, existence continued, angels performing their tasks.
, Sam. He's possessing the dude. Then there IS the whole issue of the fact I'm not
"Just take it easy," Dean murmured, still pressing a hand to his forehead, brushing back messy black hair. "Cas, you okay?"
said, and God help Dean if that voice didn't do things to his chest and stomach and some places lower than that, "
"Because this divine prophecy is more important than me and my brother?" Dean glared, and Castiel dropped his gaze.
"You killed him?" Dean opened his eyes, surprised, and Castiel scowled.
?" Dean kept his tone scathing and cold, and saw his would-be-mate flinch almost imperceptibly.
The Lord’s creations were unique, and more intelligent than the other living creatures on Earth. Castiel could understand sometimes why his Father thought them so important. They evolved slowly in Earth time, though it was no more than a blip in the timeline of Castiel’s existence. Angels were assigned to keep watch on these new creatures, and as they grew, Castiel heard stories, stories of his brothers and sisters falling for them, choosing mortal life, for these odd, simple
Dean went immediately to the given address, a sick feeling in his stomach telling him something was very, very wrong. "Something's wrong. I can't feel him anymore," Dean whispered, pulling up to the warehouse. "Sam, I can't feel him." Sam exhaled sharply, shaking his head.
The writer paused, snapping into realization, “The last names were never in the books- I never told anyone about that. I never even wrote that down...” Sam and Dean looked at each other, nodding. They had his attention now.
"You misunderstand me, Dean. I’m not like you think, I was praying that you would choose to save the town," Castiel's voice was earnest, so much so that Dean had to look at him, and Castiel looked right back with that intense way that felt like he was looking right through Dean's soul. "Can I tell you something if you promise not to tell another soul?" Castiel inquired, voice dropping an octave, making Dean shiver all over again.
" It’s the lives of one thousand against the lives of six billion, there’s a bigger picture here," Castiel's eyes were big and blue, and Dean's lips tingled, body screaming at him, "Lucifer cannot rise; he does and hell rises with him. Is that something that you’re willing to risk?"
Dean watched the small man in front of him with some mix of concern and annoyance as Chuck tossed back a very large serving of whiskey, even by Dean's standards. He turned back around and made a look of surprise.
Grinning, the taller man took Gabriel in his arms and pressed a kiss on the top of his head.
"Why?"
"One of my informants, I have to go there," Adam said as his phone rang and Dean's heart pounded faster. That was his chance, and he was not allowed to mess up that.
If it was not Dean who informed his friends about all these processes, it was Orlovsky who came by spontaneously now and then.
"Please take good care of her," he told Antonio, patting his shoulder before disappearing out the door.
"Sam."
His heart rate quickened again as Cas sat down next to him and started talking.
"Cas, I'm fine, and you're fine. That's all you have to worry."
"Well," Dean said, and Castiel startled when he realized Dean was crying, moving his hands to wipe away the tears, "if it's my fate you angels are depending on you guys are screwed. I can't do it, Cas. It's too big. Alastair was right. I'm not all here. I'm not-I'm not strong enough. Well, I guess I'm not the man either of our dads wanted me to be. Find someone else. It's not me."
” Dean snapped, and the writer paused, eyes as wide as saucers.
"Isn't it a little early for that?" Anna asked observantly, and Dean sighed.
Sam glanced at her through the rear view mirror, eyes narrowed, "what are they saying?"
"That was my mistake," Castiel tried to keep his voice calm, reassuring, and apologetic, "Certain people, special people, can perceive my true visage. I thought you would be one of them. I was wrong." If Castiel was being honest with himself, the fact that Dean wasn't one of these people was the oddest thing about this situation. Firstly, he was Michael's vessel, even more important in status than a prophet, and that alone should have rendered him able to observe angels in their natural form. Secondly, he was Castiel's grace mate, and the thought that Dean couldn't even hear his real voice after the angel had rebuilt him from bones up made Castiel far more irritated than he really should have been. He was about to ask Dean if he knew about their mate bond when the human cut him off.
"Yeah?" Dean snarked, his voice much weaker than usual but grip on the knife as unwavering as he could make it, "thanks for that." He whirled and plunged the knife deep into the creature's chest. Dean screamed with effort as as the knife sank deep, every instinct in his body crying out, muscles revolting against him, head pounding.
"I invoke, conjure, and command... Castiel? No. Sorry, Castiel, I don't scare easy," Pamela smirked, still cocky. Dean almost fell off his chair.
“Little brother, you have done what I asked. Your reward is to be the chosen vessel’s guardian. You will keep him safe and instruct him as we tell you. Do you understand?” Michael asked, energy humming around Castiel.
"Who said anything about asking?" Uriel snapped, and abruptly, the room was empty except for Sam, who turned in a circle and slammed his fist into the wall.
"This guy can't be a prophet. He's practically like a Penthouse Forum writer!" Dean objected, and even Castiel himself could see why Dean thought that, "did you know about this?" Dean whirled on Chuck, who was currently working his way through a second (third?) new bottle of whiskey.
"Yeah, of course," Dean said, and as soon as the words were out of his mouth his stomach leapt into his throat and he wavered where he was sitting, only Anna's hand holding him upright. The doors to the stable flew open and Castiel and Uriel stood there. Castiel's blue eyes immediately connected with Dean's, and he saw the angel's eyes widen as he took in the pallor of his skin. Dean knew he must look pretty damn awful. The rest of the scene passed in a blur, Dean's already weak and alcohol addled mind fueled only by adrenaline.
Dean lost track of how long they stayed at the cabin, ignoring the passing of days and nights, just relishing the time with Castiel. The angel never mentioned the bond, he just tagged along with whatever Dean was doing, never letting him out of his sight. The human began to question how angels even consummated bonds, if sex was even an option with Cas. After what must have been at least a week at the cabin, Dean got his answer.
In the end, it wasn’t Sam that came up with a solution,  Bobby did. They took off to go see the psychic Pamela,  Dean’s arm burning and gut churning, Sam not taking his eyes off his brother for a single minute. At least the Impala was unchanged, his baby was gorgeous and masculine as ever, engine rumbling and bringing a bit of familiarity to the crazy fucked up situation. Dean gripped the steering wheel tight and breathed in the smell of leather for a second, the feeling of home. The enormity of the situation was crashing down on him, and he was struggling to understand it all. Hopefully, this psychic could solve the problem.
, and it soon was obvious any angel who fell into Hell twisted, grace becoming distorted, dimmed, and finally darkened completely.
"I had orders not to. I am disobeying," Castiel said simply, and grabbed Dean's hand, flying them to a remote cabin in the middle of Europe, landing an instant later. He held onto Dean to keep him from toppling over, and Dean swatted at him.
monster first. Just in case.
"Anna," he murmured in acknowledgement, straightening his shoulders.
“Someone has gotta know who he is,” Dean replied firmly, and Sam just rubbed his temples.
"Okay," Dean murmured, kicking himself for being so casual. Eloquent speech was never his strong suit.
"He's not here. He's gone." Jimmy sounded so relieved that it made Dean's jaw clench, and a rough sob tore from his throat. He knew instinctively that it was true. His mate was gone. The man before him was a stranger; he knew his body, but the appeal, the tug of the bond was no longer there. He pressed his palms to his eyes and forced himself to take deep breaths. He couldn't feel Cas anymore, not anywhere. His chest ached with the emptiness and he clutched it.
"Prayer is a sign of faith. This is a good thing, Dean," Castiel seemed all too pleased, and Dean sighed and pointedly ignored him.
"I toyed with your lives for entertainment! If I had known you were real I would have made another pass, not made you live bad writing." Chuck began to pace, the ice in his glass clinking as he threw his hands around.
Castiel was still praying, listening to the screams, when the light bulb above his head flickered and burst, dimming the room. He didn't have to turn around to tell who was there.
Watching Jimmy eat was probably a pretty good mirror of what Dean looked like when he ate a really good hamburger. His face was blissful, cheeks stuffed, and Dean felt unreasonably nauseous. "You wanna slow down? You're going to give me angina."
“Doesn’t matter,” Dean said finally, with a sigh, “I’m not bringin’ any girl into this. Ain’t fair to her.” Sam’s expression saddened and Dean tried to ignore the new, aching and empty feeling in his gut.
"Cas? What's wrong?" Dean stood, placing gentle hands on his mate's shoulders.
looked like, astonished because the creature appeared undeniably male, tousled black sex hair, five o clock shadow, body hidden under layers of an ill fitting suit and a long tan trench coat, dress shoes crunching over the rubble on the ground.
"Castiel?" Dean asked weakly, his voice almost non existent, throat tight.
"Yeah, I've known since I met you," Dean sighed, forcing himself not to touch the angel right back.
"Let's keep it that way," Uriel's deep but less gravelly voice piped up from where he was staring out the window, and Dean and Sam turned to give him matching scowls.
And through it all, his chest ached.
Dean slumped into the driver's seat, face buried in his hands, and Sam climbed silently into the passenger's seat, waiting for Dean to speak or move.
"Dean," Castiel's voice was softer than he had wanted it to be, and Dean looked at him with curious eyes, "the breaking of the seal must be avoided at all costs. You have to kill the witch before she can succeed." Sam had been watching the whole altercation carefully, eyes bouncing back and forth between Dean and Castiel, and he finally spoke up.
"Dean," Castiel whispered, gravelly voice even rougher than usual, "I know this is difficult to understand..."
"Sorry. All I know is I'm Jimmy Novak from Pontiac, Illinois," the man shrugged, and Dean's heart dropped into his stomach. "I was a religious man, very devoted, have a wife and daughter. He asked for my help and told me my family would always be safe."
vessel, the one hand selected for Michael, should have meant he was the most God fearing man on the planet. Yet, Castiel could tell, both through the mating bond and with his own eyes, that Dean quite honestly did not believe a word that was coming out of Castiel's mouth. It was irritating, and the mate in Castiel was growling its disapproval.
"Oh fuck." Chuck cursed suddenly, digging through piles of rough drafts on his desk, "the new book, its kind of weird. Very Vonnegut."
"Because God commanded it," Castiel said, still standing well within Dean's space, "because we have work for you."
Hell was cold, hell was noisy and chaotic, and hell hurt Castiel’s very essence. His grace was revolted at being so close to these twisted creatures, and only skilled practice and thousands of years of killing kept Castiel focused and alive. He slashed through swarm after swarm, saw brothers and sisters fall on either side of him, and still they fought on. He was dimly aware of the passing of days, days became months, months became years, years became decades. His wings grew frostbitten and the feathers grew brittle in response, turning deep black starting from the tip and creeping in until his wings were black as night and shadow. He would wear them as a mark of pride, he thought to himself, when he got out of here. If he got out of here.
Dean had been well muscled, toned and hardened from hunter’s work. Castiel started there, winding muscle over bone and crafting a well made structure. He began on skin next, Dean had had a golden complexion, and time in the sun had given him light freckles, scattered over the bridge of his nose and across his shoulders. Castiel traced light fingers over his shoulders, freckles blooming in precisely the same spots as they had been upon his death. Only then did Castiel begin on Dean’s face. His hair was spiky and tousled at the same time, light brown, the same color as his eyebrows. Full lips, strong jaw line, sturdy neck, stubble evenly crafted across his cheeks and chin. Castiel reached reverently for his mate's face, saving his eyes for last. Dean Winchester’s eyes were the most beautiful things Castiel had ever had the pleasure of seeing. They were green, but all shades of green. Mossy green blended with emerald, and bits of jade were thrown in and scattered everywhere. Castiel poured his grace into it, making everything as it once was, and he stood back to look at his work. He pressed a hand to Dean’s bicep, in a brief, very selfish moment, and marked Dean as his, burning his mating mark into that perfect skin.
“Sorry,” Bobby said, completely unapologetically. Sam hesitantly reached for his brother, grasping his shoulder.
Castiel wasn’t screaming out of pride; he was shouting in euphoria, grace swelling with the thought of meeting his grace mate after all these millenia. He rushed on, finally breaking free of the realm of hell. Castiel couldn’t wait to see what his mate looked like alive and whole.
Dean clambered out of bed with a yawn, wearing nothing but loose pajama pants, and stumbled into the kitchen for coffee, which was blessedly already made. Thank God he had taught Castiel how to use the coffee maker. He poured himself a cup, raising it to his lips to drink when suddenly there were warm arms around his bare waist, long fingers running over his hip bones and soft, chapped lips trailing over the arch of his neck. Dean moaned softly, tilting his head back and resting it on Castiel's shoulder, and the angel nosed his way up to Dean's ear. "Do you know how appealing you look like this?" Cas asked, breath warm on Dean's skin. Dean shivered and huffed a laugh, putting his coffee down.
A click made both turn around. Gabriela stood behind them with a mischievous smile and when she showed her cell phone, they looked at each other with something that could only be called 'hearty eyes'.
"Kim, baby. I love you, I always have and always will. I'm sorry it has to end like this. "
"Do not even try. Your reputation as Casanova precedes you.
For one, because he was worried about him, on the other side, because he was also worried about his colleagues when the young firefighter had another failure. In certain situations, this could be detrimental to everyone.
Although he would have preferred it differently, the two were a team.
Dean had taken the day off and promised his husband a delicious breakfast. For the third time in the last five minutes, he looked at the clock and then went to the window. Finally, the dark blue Ford was coming up the driveway, and Dean stormed out of the door. Galant, he opened the driver's door and handed Cas his hand.
First, it was necessary to confront the causer. It was not the first time any of the Winchesters had summoned death, so it did not take long for this creature to stand in the midst of the circle.
"Go on, but do not mess!" The older man grinned, reached into his pants pocket and took out the key.
"That heals the hangover in an hour," Dawson whispered, putting her index finger to her lips and the others following her on a soft footing.
With a smile on his face, he walked down the hallway in the Chicago Med, admiring the colorful pictures on the wall, but when he reached Sylvie's sickroom, which was deserted, his smile died down.
"You can bring me a suppository," the black-haired mumbled because so far he was still in his right mind. It was enough when he did not get around in the intensive care unit and had to shit once in the bedpan. In embarrassment, he would have liked to vanish off in the face of the earth.
Almost the young policeman slipped and was able to hold on to the fire escape with his last strength. Granted, this plan was not well thought out, but he had little time for that. Carefully but swiftly and quietly he slid down and with one last jump Dean finally felt the ground under his feet.
The witch was never a fan of the Winchester brothers, that was no secret. But that fate had so badly affected them, made her thoughtful. Much was possible in the world of the supernatural, but to punish someone with death just because the others made fun of it was nasty. She tore herself out of her thoughts because she had done that several times before. And admittedly, she had regretted some of it. Actually, she did not want to be labeled as a wicked witch, and maybe that was her chance to repent. So she agreed to help them.
Asked if everything was alright, Dean held his aching head and as he brought his hand forward again, anyone, despite the darkness, could see the blood in his hand in the light of the street lamp.
Cas gave as much as he got, stifled no groan as their tongues danced like snakes and explored the foreign territory. The hand was still in his hair, while the other drew circles on his chest, also pulled on the clothes. Breathless wheezing, lusty groaning, contented sigh filled the room.
"Some have fallen for his charm. I want you to take care of yourself, okay?"
Dean was happy to deal with his niece and his little nephew but was also glad when he came away from this childish screaming again. He got on well with his colleagues from work, did his job, was satisfied.
"Oh, God!"
Dean was aware that his fiancé was an attractive man, but when he approached him in his dark blue uniform, it nearly took his breath away. Damn, what luck did he have ... His heart was pounding wildly, full of impatience, full of suspense and love. Only a few steps, then they would beat in unison.
"Where's Cas?" Dean demanded, shaking Jimmy's shoulder roughly. "Where is he?!"
. This didn't make sense to Castiel. They had their duties, they had purpose, and Castiel didn’t understand why they would give this up for the creatures in the realm below. Angels talked, voices in his head arguing and debating, speaking of prophets and prophecies and things to come involving these creations. Castiel dismissed the thoughts, choosing to continue to protect heaven and earth as per his orders.
When they arrived back and found Sam’s soul-bond dead, killed by the same demon that got their mother, Dean looked at Sam’s face, an eerie echo of their father’s, expression grim and vengeful. He didn’t try to talk much to his brother; it wasn’t going to do any good. He knew what people were like after losing their soul-bond. You got half of you ripped away, and some people even died from it. Dean knew his brother well enough to know he wasn’t one of those people, but as time went on, Dean wondered if Sammy wouldn’t rather be dead sometimes.
"So, you talk to the angels?" Dean asked, a little wary. He didn't want any more angels tailing them than there already were.
"So I uh -- failed your test huh? I get it. But you know what? If you would have waved that magic time travelling wand of yours and we had to do it all over again, I’d make the same call," Dean was firm and fierce, though he knew he had bags under his eyes and his body was trembling and shivery with fever from the close proximity of his would-be-mate, "'cause see, I don’t know what’s gonna happen when these seals are broken, hell, I don’t even know what’s gonna happen tomorrow. But what I do know is, that this, here? These kids, the swings, the trees, all of it is still here because of my brother and me."
Dean was dreaming of hell, shifting uncomfortably, cold and aching inside his mind, when the television flipped on. The radio alongside the bed began to sizzle as well, and it was enough to jolt Dean awake, rubbing his eyes and hissing between his teeth, "Oh you have GOT to be fucking kidding me," Dean snatched up the shotgun from the bedside table, he wasn't sure where Sam was, and had no way of contacting him. Dean winced as the ringing sharpened, desperately trying to clutch the gun with at least one hand, the sound literally ear splitting. Dean felt blood trickle out of both ears as he clutched the right ear in his free hand and, finally abandoning the useless weapon, he clutched both ears and fell to the floor. His gut clenched, breath punched out of him, tears leaking from his eyes as he struggled to stay conscious, vision fuzzy. The mirror above his head on the ceiling shattered, and the shards cut into him harshly even as Dean used the last of his strength to roll mostly out of the way, screaming as the echoes in his head and chest reverberated until he thought he might be dying all over again. He was vaguely aware of Bobby bursting into the room, stretching a hand to him and calling his name at the same time something else did, and never had Dean's name sounded so terrifying.
"Of course I knew. He writes about everything involving you and Sam, and by that extension, sometimes he writes about me as well," Castiel responded, and Dean averted his eyes. Castiel just stared at him and Dean came back to the more pressing topic at hand.
He loved him, and maybe he was loved in return. He didn't deserve it, that was for sure, but fuck it felt good.
"Like I said," Castiel murmured, his voice even rougher than usual, "you look very appealing like this." Dean turned in Cas' arms, facing him, and it was only when his erection brushed the matching hardness in Castiel's slacks that he remembered he was only wearing thin pajama pants. The angel gasped, and Dean couldn't help another little thrust, drawing sighs of pleasure from both of them. "Dean," Castiel hissed, hands sliding up to cup Dean's face, "you don't have to do this. You know what will happen if we do. If the bond is completed, there is no going back." Dean grasped Cas' wrists, holding his hands to his face.
"It's not us, we're not doing it!" Alistair wheezed, fingers scrabbling at his throat, "Lilith is not behind this. She wouldn't kill seven angels. Oh, she'd kill a hundred, a thousand." Sam paused, frowning, and Alistair hissed in a breath. "Oh go ahead, big boy. Send me back, if you can."
"Well," Sam responded, "get angry instead."
"Who is going to stop us?" Uriel smirked, "You? This demon bitch?" Castiel flinched as Uriel flung out a hand, smashing the demon into the far wall. Dean leaped at Uriel, face twisted into a snarl, and Castiel did cry out now, turning quickly to Uriel to demand he cease action. Uriel slammed his fist directly into Dean's stomach, and his already weak body crumpled under the angel's strength. Castiel winced, grasping Uriel's arm, yanking on him hard enough that Uriel turned to face him with a confused expression. Castiel had just opened his mouth to explain when a bright light engulfed both angels, and they were flung far away from the tiny cabin, and consequently he was flung far away from his hurting mate.
"The most fearsome wrath of heaven would rain down on that demon. Just so you understand why I can't help," Castiel nodded slightly with a small, self satisfied smile twitching the corners of his mouth.
"Hey, where's Ruby?" Sam asked, glancing around as if she might pop up.
A small smile played along Anna's lips, "Something like that."
Dean was about to respond that he was a damn hunter and his life WAS danger, when Castiel pressed soft, chapped pink lips to his, only for a moment, before disappearing, leaving the familiar empty ache inside Dean behind.
He had been working on Dean’s body for seven earthly days, and it was now Thursday once more. Fitting, Castiel thought to himself. He scooped the bright, wonderful soul out of the center of his grace that had been protecting it, and placed it back in his body, back into the coffin and grave he had found it in. He wished to stay and observe Dean awakening, but his superiors were already calling him back, ordering him home. Castiel let out an annoyed burst of power as he took off, flattening the area around his mate’s grave, and he flew towards heaven, appearing before Michael with what remained of his garrison.
“Well, nice to meet you,” Dean said, praising himself for only sounding a tiny bit sarcastic, “I'm Dean Winchester, and this is my brother Sam.”
Castiel officially hated his superior. Zachariah was a conniving, slippery angel, and Castiel thought to himself that he must have some kind of secret agenda. Directly upon arriving back from the cabin, it was demanded that Castiel come to heaven- he claimed he had healed Dean because the human was too close to death for him to be comfortable leaving him that way, and though he was scolded for the healing, it was also noted that Dean was in better fighting shape than he had been in a long time, so Castiel's superiors let him off with a warning. Zachariah had been the only one to look at him curiously, as though he were seeing through him, and when he asked Castiel about the week they'd been missing, Castiel simply told him the human's body had been too hard to repair immediately. It had been an uneasily accepted excuse, and Castiel was not disillusioned- he knew he was on extremely thin ice. Somehow, however, the angel couldn't seem to make himself care too much, he was finally bonded with Dean, with his grace mate, and he was floating with happiness. Another emotion, another weakness for angels, but Castiel didn't regret learning about this one.
"It looks like a bomb went off..." Sam muttered, looking side to side and up and down.
Sam cleared his throat, and he looked like he couldn't decide whether to be disgusted or amused,” as in... Sam-slash-Dean... together.” Dean flinched back from the computer like it had burned him, staring at Sam in horror, and Sam gave him a look, “hey, Castiel doesn't exist in the books yet, so...”
“Yup,” Dean told him, pointing at the items, “that's real rock salt, those are real fake IDs.”
"Here for her like... here for her?" Dean stepped in front of Anna protectively, as though he could prevent the angels from touching her. Castiel looked sad and weary for a moment, like the weight of the world was on his shoulders, and Dean wanted to reach out and wipe that expression away.
"I dunno, she's your hell buddy," Dean groused, taking another swig of alcohol and relishing the way it burned down his throat.
"Not here. Someplace more private," Castiel completely ignored the question, eyes narrowing at Dean.
"He tried to have you killed," was the angel's explanation, and really, it was enough.
Castiel was antsy in a way that was driving him mad. After he left Dean standing in the barn, he flew quickly to an isolated area of the artic, landing amidst the snow and ice and standing there for a minute, silent, before slamming his fist into a glacier with a cry, the ice splitting with a mighty crack and avalanching to the rocky ground. He stood there, vessel shaking, emotion running through him. He wasn't sure what to do anymore. Uriel knew now, he could tell that clear as day, and Castiel knew his life was in danger at this very moment. The minute Michael got word that Castiel was bonded to a human, the seraph knew he would be killed... and still his very grace ached, pulled on him, tugging Castiel back towards North America where the beautiful soul of Dean Winchester resided. Castiel had only gotten one taste, one caress, and yet he knew he couldn't go back now. He belonged by Dean's side.
"Anna's grace is gone. You understand? She can't angel up. She can't protect us. We can't fight heaven and hell. One side maybe, but not both. Not at once," Ruby was all but shouting, and Dean gathered she was just as anxious as the rest of them.
The house of the author was really run down, old, and not taken care of very well, and Dean felt an absurd moment of hurt feelings that the general public didn't like the books more than they did, that they were so unpopular the author went bankrupt. He scowled at himself and rang the doorbell, Sam tall and imposing on the other side of him, and when a short, raggedy looking man answered the door, absolutely reeking of alcohol, Dean couldn't help but be even more annoyed. “You Chuck Shirley?” Dean practically snarled the words, fists clenched, and the man trembled ever so slightly.
After days, the doctors had discovered the blood clot that had gone unnoticed into her brain, but it was too late ... Sylvie was already dead. Four days before his release. The only consolation was that she had not noticed. It went very fast.
It is said that people develop extraordinary skills in exceptional situations. That's exactly how it was. Although Dean could not carry his friend, he could support and pull and drag him. Closer and closer they came to the door to the roof, only a few steps. Almost done.
"No Dean, no! Come on. You fought against demons and all kinds of supernatural things. You were in heaven, in hell, and purgatory. If you think you can die now after falling on a stone ... Dean. Damn open your eyes! That can not end like this. That may ... Dean!"
Now it was he who was nervous. After all, it was a long time ago, and he did not want to hurt him. But damn, he wanted it so badly, just like Dean did.
"I'll make myself comfortable on the couch then ..."
At that moment, a part of the hospital collapsed again, accompanied by a massive cloud of dust that formed around the crowd.
"Hey. Here I am. Thoroughly disinfected and germ-free," Dean smirked.
For the fifth wedding anniversary, Dean had thought of something extraordinary. He had baked a cake for his husband.
"You called me?"
It was a desperate, dark, aroused and at the same time pleading growl that broke Cas's lungs and disappeared into Dean's mouth and all he could do was press his hands tighter into the other's buttocks to hold him there were both wanted to feel it so badly.
Besides his penis, he also had one in his nose, such a thing for the oxygen, one in the back, which went directly to the spinal cord and probably provided his body with some painkillers. One on the neck, possibly for the same purpose and one in his scar on the abdomen, to remove the wound fluid. Besides, the needle in the back of his hand for various infusions, some pads on his upper body, which were connected to monitors, and a kind of clothespin attached to his finger.
Each time he was pushed forward, his cock rubbed against the mattress, and it did not take long for him to feel the warm wetness beneath him, while Cas squeezed tightly against him, whispering in his ear how much he loved him.
Because he did not know what to do, he rang the nurse, who immediately saw what was going on.
"What?" Cas asked perplexed.
With a satisfied hum, he slid that gorgeous cock over his face, rubbing his nose gently, drawing in that unique scent. Dean liked that male smell, the smell of pleasure. And this scent also flowed immediately between his legs and made itself felt by small fireworks. His eyes were still closed, his mind focused on his fingertips and feeling as he slowly stroked Cas's scrotum. He felt that roundness and fullness, soft, grooved skin and heat. It was like being in a trance, touching him like that, so sensual for Dean, but then he frowned and looked closer.
After a sip of tea and the proximity of his husband, the black-haired had calmed down so much that he could talk without stuttering. Dean insisted on being at the next appointment.
Then there was silence, as Gabriela lost consciousness after she sent the emergency call with her last strength. Neither of them heard the shouting as people hurried. No one saw that the truck had moved on. Both had their eyes closed.
With a slight smile, Dean stroked his man's black hair, placed a kiss on the top of his head and watched as those eyes grew heavier and heavier as Cas lay on his chest.
Both giggled and from then on the ice was broken. It took not a long time and they talked like old friends, laughing, joking and flirting. Both were sleeping well that night, hoping for a sequel.
Since his voice sounded very hoarse, as his vocal cords were still swollen, the speech therapist came over and did a few exercises with him.
"What's wrong with you?", Herrmann grinned after watching the scene when Dean had sent a girl into the desert in a rather uncharming way, put another glass of beer in front of his nose and waited for an explanation.
He leaned closer and the blood shot into Dean's face.
"That's great. You scrounging funeral institutes," Cas chuckled, getting in the car to help.
"Are you going to tell me, or should I guess?" He asked a little annoyed.
Dean and Cas were with Kim to help her during this difficult time. She was standing in the kitchen and had calmed down a bit when she saw Sergeant Voigt's car drive up and he got out with chaplain Orlovsky.
"What and ... A day to celebrate!"
"So, but there is also good news," he smiled and looked into questioning faces, as he increased the tension with the delaying of the answer. "We start to wake him up slowly tomorrow. The values have improved surprisingly fast, and nothing stands in the way. You can all visit him in a few days."
As an angel, the cold did not bother him, and so he lay down to Dean on the floor. He wanted to be with him for the last few hours, even if he was cold and stiff.
Twice he heard a police siren and hid in panic among garbage cans. His breath rattled as if he had asthma. The shirt stuck to his body and he wiped his sweaty hands on his black trousers a few times.
"Where? What?"
Chief Boden was in despair because Herrmann had a serious leg injury, Dawson was buried under the rubble, but Casey and Severide had localized her and were about to pull her out, and Novak had resisted an order and was in mortal danger. Once again.
The first day was not bad. On the second day, the painkillers were dosed lower, and every movement and especially the coughing Castiel tried as well to suppress as it led to the fact that his abdominal wall moved a lot, which resulted in considerable pain.
Exhausted, he sank to the ground and closed his eyes. His thoughts wandered to Cas how he would have liked to tell the angel what he felt for him. On the other hand, it might have been even worse for Cas to let him go. He did not want to do that to him either.
Yes. Certainly. But not just for fun, but only when the brothers had a case where they needed help. And besides, that day had a meaning now. Dean sighed and opened the first beer.
After Dean was in the fresh air, having a coffee at the machine and walking back to his husband, he sensed that the black-haired was struggling with something.
This has happened frequently lately. It was these nightmares that tormented his husband, the experience he had during this difficult time needed time to process. Again and again, he was overwhelmed by these emotions, which he could barely channel.
"The hose disturbs kissing," Dean murmured and Cas warned him not to make him laugh, because of that hurt. There were enough hoses in and on his body.
If it had been possible, sparks of anger would have come out of his eyes.
Still, the fever dropped only slightly during the next two hours, but Cas played it down, even as Chief Boden and Herrmann came to visit. He had to admit that he had to think for a moment so that he could remember the name of his colleague. It was probably due to the fever. Then he vomited again.
More than you could ever know
Cas lost no time and locked himself in the toilet. But it did not work because he always had the fear that something was wrong. After 5 minutes he was frustrated, after 10 minutes rubbing he was annoyed, after 15 minutes the tears ran, and he was desperate. After he had washed his face, he unlocked and just wanted to get back to bed to pull the blanket over his head.
After a few moments of shock, however, he saw a small glint in the blue eyes, took a deep breath and shook his head in relief.
"We could pick up where we left off a few hours ago."
"You're killing me, Honey," Dean sighed, gently pushing Cas's upper body away from him.
"I love you. Any spot on your beautiful body and if you were not so heavy, I could do it for hours, but I can not hold you anymore."
Dressed and ready to finally get home, he sat on his bed with his cell phone. He had already signed all the forms and said goodbye to everyone.
Sighing, he closed his eyes. Everything went so slowly. Of course, he knew that the Intelligence Unit did everything and also that it was not that easy, but all he wanted to live a fearless life again. With Dean.
"See, he does not want me to go."
"We're thinking of you," he said goodbye, leaving Dean alone.
"Dean, can we drive to Sylvie for a while?"
"Just for today, they have a loss, and you seem very suitable."
Your heart is my heart.
The creature knew it had lost and reluctantly agreed to let Dean go.
"Do not say it," Dean repeated, emphasizing each syllable.
Yes, Dean Winchester and patience. These two things just did not fit and it was not easy to learn that. Nevertheless, he was happy about this little progress.
"Am I under house arrest?"
Yes, Dean was a slut and always took anything that was willing. But those times were over, and he vowed to do it with every kiss he shared with Cas.
"There are two options, you bastard. Either you let me go, or I'll wake everyone up, and we'll have a party."
To be honest, it pinched, but the relief was all the greater.
It took less than ten minutes for the fire truck to stop and everyone got out.
"You have beautiful eyes."
At some point the tiredness overcame him, and he sank to the ground, where he immediately fell into a restless sleep.
"Cas ...!"
"Do not hurt him."
Suddenly, he felt a pain in his heart, had to gasp for a moment, because this heartache, when a special person was no longer there, he had never felt before. Not even when the angels had fallen or when it turned out his dad was an asshole. Never.
"You have tested me and thrown me every which way and I have never asked for anything. Now I need your help. Please, aren't I important enough to warrant a little of your angel power?" Dean snapped, and Castiel frowned, in a pained sort of way that almost made Dean feel bad.
"So basically, I'm getting you into trouble," Dean murmured, watching Castiel's face.
The hurt that crossed Castiel's face made the mate inside Dean scream its displeasure. "I will prove it to you, Dean Winchester. I will show you I am worth your time and affections. I've been waiting for you for millennia. I can wait as long as it takes," Cas responded, jaw set and eyes flashing as he made the vow, "in the meantime, will you allow me to heal your afflictions?"
"But I didn't write that yet... the story, I haven't seen it," Chuck was definitely putting on the brakes now, "no friggin' way, not gonna do it."
When Castiel’s entire garrison was called to meet with Michael, he knew something huge was happening. There had been whispers about it for days, angels echoing in his head that the seal had been broken, that everything was in place. Michael stood gigantic and imposing in front of them, and his voice echoed when he spoke,
"I think we will just take that," Dean snatched the manuscript from Chuck's hands despite his arguments, "and you can stay here and write some more. It would be nice to see what we're going up against, and not just about Sam's sex life."
me," Castiel begged, and Dean really could never refuse him that. Dean trailed fingers through Cas' thick black hair, grasping it and slowly, easily sliding his cock back into his mouth, shallow thrusts at first until Castiel made a sharp noise of disapproval. Dean's already weak control broke, and he starting slamming into Castiel's mouth in earnest. He gripped Cas' hair hard, eliciting a pleased sound from the angel, and shoved his cock deep into Cas' mouth, feeling the exact moment when his cock shoved down the opening of Cas' throat, watching the outline of his cock show through the skin there. He pulled out quickly and thrust back in, Castiel moaning around him the entire time, and goddamn but this was the best blow job of his life.
Not that Dean would ever say that out loud,even if threatened with bodily harm. Still, it was nice to think it. He wasn't sure how angels could feel about humans, but Cas and him were always weird anyway, and it was nice.
“See, here's the thing,” Dean snapped, officially done with this shit, “ we have a life. You've been using it to write your books.” Dean shoved the door open and shoved Chuck backwards in the process, and the writer exclaimed in surprise.
"Dean! you can't just conjure the thing up and expect to SURVIVE!" Sam argued frantically with his brother. Dean just shrugged.
"Broke some ribs, I think," he managed to grind out through his chattering teeth, "gimme a minute." Sam stepped back and watched with worried eyes as Dean painstakingly managed to lever himself into a siting position, one arm wrapped around his torso. "So what the fuck was that?" Dean asked, looking around to see no angels in sight.
"So if the prophet was in the same room as a powerful demon..." Dean's brain finally clicked into place, and he took a deep breath.
"Hey, we're still in one piece," Dean gritted his teeth, "although if you mention the mating bond and cabin thing again YOU might NOT be."
"Dean, stop! Let him go." Castiel hissed, pushing his arm down. Dean slowly let the smaller man go and turned to face Cas, who looked unusually serious, even for him. "This man is to be protected."
"So you'll help me?" He looked those blue eyes straight on, feeling some of the tension in his shoulders ease.
Michael inclined his head, and Castiel bowed in submission.
"Well I didn't ask for you either!" Dean snapped back, ready to tear into him when Sam held out a hand and gave him a warning look.
"He's got a wife and a kid. We put him on a bus and send him home," Dean spoke so harshly even he could hear the emotion in his voice.
“Like... us, together, together?” Dean asked, looking a little ill. Sam smirked, and nodded. “They do know we're brothers, right?” Dean frowned, looking like he really didn't want an answer.
"So what do we do now?" Sam asked, giving Dean a knowing look.
"I told you I don't know!" Chuck whined, hands coming up to prevent a hit to his face.
"Where?" Chuck asked warily, pulling against the hold as much as he could.
"Don't worry," Uriel's smile was absolutely predatory, "I'll kill her gentle." Anna couldn't help crying out, and Dean stood a little more firmly, adrenaline sinking in.
"Your sympathies?" Dean asked, though he had a feeling he already knew the answer.
Dean Winchester’s body was in horrible condition. The circumstances of his death and the months on Earth it had spent in the ground had rendered it almost unusable. Still, Castiel was more determined and focused than he remembered being in all of his time alive, and he slowly began his detailed and painstaking work on this body.
“Man… I just can’t believe it’s really you,” Sam’s voice broke on the last word, his eyes teary and lip trembling. Instead of looking like the imposing giant of a man he was, Dean was reminded of chubby little six year old Sammy waiting for him to get home from school.
He poked around, gasping sharply when he saw a familiar tan trenchcoat. "Cas!" Dean rushed over, pressing a hand gently to his forehead, "Cas, fuck. Wake up. What happened?"
“Maybe,” the much smaller man twitched, “why?”
"I trust Ruby," Sam replied evenly, "after you were gone, she saved my life. Ruby came back for me. Whatever you have to say, she saved me. More than that, she got through to me. What she said to me... It's what you would've said. If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be here." Dean stared at his brother for a second, reading between the lines. Sammy was in deeper with this demon than Dean would have ever guessed. Sam popped Dean's shoulder in on the count of three, and Dean gasped with pain. Sam frowned as he touched his brother, all Dean felt like was skin and bones, and Sam could almost count the columns of his spine through his thin t-shirt. "Dean, you look awful," Sam gave his brother his best bitchface, "you need to talk to Castiel and see what you can do." Dean shoved away his brother, rubbing his injured shoulder with his good hand.
responded, and Dean's knees buckled slightly, the dragged over sharp gravel voice pulled feelings out of him he didn't want and really didn't need at the moment.
Castiel's brow furrowed into a confused frown, and Dean wanted to smooth the wrinkles away, "Why are you fighting it, fighting me?" Castiel asked, and the misery and hurt was evident in his voice. Dean was starting to get an idea of why Anna had said this brother was different than the others.
"And we follow it, I know. Like I said, I'm just—I'm just getting tired," Dean groaned, and Sam could understand why. His older brother looked absolutely terrible, pale, thin as a skeleton, and constantly exhausted. Sam cleared his throat, debating what to say.
"Who's me?" Sam asked, grip tightening on the pistol in his hand.
"I am not kidding you," Castiel told them, slightly offended. Why would he make such an important point up? Chuck looked pale white, and Cas was debating whether forcibly removing the alcohol from his bloodstream was a viable option when he excused himself and stumbled up the stairs. Dean seemed to give up, body going lax and letting himself lean against him.
Dean didn't really expect an answer, and none came.
Pamela Barnes was curvy, sexy, and sassy, which was a win-win in Dean's book on women. He flirted shamelessly with her as she prepared for the séance, Sammy smirking fondly in the background. Dean ignored the tiny voice shouting at him inside his brain, along with the nauseous feeling that accompanied it, he was Dean Winchester, dammit, and he was going to hopefully get laid tonight if the flirting was anything to go by. He deserved a little fun after being in hell, no matter how much his body screamed at him it was
Dean gasped, and Sam's eyes shot up, locking onto Dean, remembering. Dean shook his head at Sammy, no way would he have been paired with some
Uriel laughed, a dark kind of sound, and he cracked his knuckles, "So Castiel has nothing to do with you, then. When I throw you back in Hell, he will go on completely unaffected?"
"We're here for Anna," Castiel's voice was firm, and Dean felt his knees betray him and tremble ever so slightly.
Castiel winced slightly, still displeased with himself for that whole scenario, " I warned her not to spy on my true form. It can be... overwhelming to humans, and so can my real voice. But you already knew that."
"Me, I think," Anna piped up from the other side of the room, and Dean glanced at her. Her arm was bleeding, but she looked otherwise okay, though she so pale with fear she looked sickly. Anna motioned to a mirror Dean hadn't noticed before, and there on the mirror was a sigil written in blood, one that apparently had the power to get rid of angels.
Mary and John Winchester had told Dean stories when he was younger of the soul-bond aspect of human life and love. They told him about how it would happen. Dean’s Dad would get this dreamy far off look on his face, and if he was drunk enough he would talk to Dean.
"I'm the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition,"
"It's the only way we could chat, since you're hiding like cowards," Uriel responded, ever superior.
Dean's world was shattered. It stopped spinning for a moment, his head reeling, stomach sick. He knew instinctively Alistair wasn't lying to him. The first seal had been his weakness. He had started the entire apocalypse by torturing innocent souls. He whirled around, knife in hand, ready to kill the bastard. "When we win, when we bring on the apocalypse and burn this earth down, we'll owe it all to you, Dean Winchester," Alistair laughed a gurgly bloody laugh, and Dean gripped the knife even tighter, "believe me, son, I wouldn't lie about this. It's kind of a religious sort of thing with me." Dean chuckled darkly.
Dean swallowed convulsively, and when he spoke his voice was quiet and rough, "I have no clue what you're talking about."
"Needed?" Dean coughed, "we just got back from being needed." Sam interrupted quickly, trying to diffuse the tension.
“Dean, what’s wrong? What happened?” Sam’s voice was quiet and subdued, trying not to wake their father, “you were thrashing in your sleep… what’s her name?”
“I've never wanted anything more,” Dean told him, and as he said it he realized it was completely true. Castiel's face lit up, and he took Dean's hand, leading him to the bedroom.
. He whispered the name to himself, trying to stamp down the hope inside. It simply could not be.
Then, he found himself suspended, pierced through by hooks and chains seemingly attached to nothing, a grinning, twisted, horrifying demon form in front of him, slicing into him and laughing, the pain happening over and over again. Sammy, Dean’s mind screamed, I did this for Sammy. Dean knew this was coming, and day after day he told himself it was worth it, until the day he couldn’t picture his brother’s face. Thirty years he suffered, clinging to memories of being human, until he couldn’t bear the pain anymore, until he couldn’t remember ever being human. He stepped off the rack and sliced into the first victim, a twisted smile on his face. With every heartbeat one word rang in his head, the only thing that remained of his humanity.
“Hey, this isn't funny!” he protested, and Dean snorted.
It seemed rather ironic that grace would create something as magically beautiful and huge as an oak tree, when all Dean had seen grace used for was killing and destruction. When they arrived at the location, in Union, Kentucky, they all piled out of the car, and Dean inhaled sharply at the gorgeous sight of the field and the tree, it looked ethereal, unnaturally beautiful.
"Enough of this," Uriel demanded, power crackling through his words. Castiel frowned, mouth open to speak and stupidly defend his mate and his mate's brother when Dean spoke up.
"So what, Cas just ditched?" Dean found this hard to believe, the note, the dream, and the lack of mate bond made him wary of everything that was happening. "You don't remember anything at all?"
"Castiel? Oh, he, uh...he's not here. See, he has this weakness. He likes you," Uriel told him, and Dean shivered at the blatant mention of Castiel's fondness for him. Apparently, even the other angels were noticing, and Dean couldn't help but wonder if that meant bad things were coming for Castiel as well as Anna. "Time's up, boy. We want the girl," Uriel demanded.
The minute Dean walked into the shitty hotel room he knew exactly who was standing there. His stomach flopped to his feet, and he swayed where he stood, Sam placing a firm hand on his shoulder and flipping on the light.
, Sam. Quit it." Sam opened his mouth to argue when there was a knock on the door.
"There are a thousand people here! You're willing to kill them all?!" Sam exclaimed, expression aghast, and he took a step forward. Castiel's eyes only flickered to him briefly before settling on Dean again.
“Everything is in here, and I mean
“Yeah, its me, I swear -don’t you dare slice me with that again, Bobby, I see you holding it- I just have no clue HOW I’m here, which is why I need my pain in the ass, genius brother to help come up with a solution,” Dean was pissed, his arm burning faintly where the large handprint remained branded into his skin. The lonely ache in his belly, while familiar in its emptiness,  felt a little off, and his brain wouldn’t stop whispering
Dean snapped, the limit of his temper reached, and he outright snarled at the angel, watching Castiel's eyes snap up towards him and body go taunt as a bow, "Of course you have a choice; I mean, come on, what? You’ve never questioned a crap order, huh? What, are you both just a couple of hammers?"
face, sorrow maybe, and it was gone as quickly as it was there. The monster gripped the magic knife, pulling it out of his body, dropping it to the floor and fixing those blue eyes impassively on Dean, who was leaning against the table, gasping for air, trying not to throw himself at the inhuman man in front of him. Dean noted dully that he didn't even BLEED, despite the fact the knife should have pierced his heart. His stomach dropped as
'Strumming', he always jokingly called it, because Dean usually hit the wrong notes on his guitar. But at that moment it was the most beautiful tune that reached his ears and spread like a warm wave throughout the body.
He did not care, just wanted to look back into his angel's eyes and tell him how much he loved him.
It was the next day when Cas opened his eyes. That was beautiful on the one hand, but totally spooky on the other. Because they did not react or move, just stared at one point. But every two hours the nurse came with eye drops to prevent them from drying out.
"Dean!"
"Task completed. I need an ambulance, or rather a hearse. Not much more left than a pile of tin."
Inside, he had to grin a little as Cas seemed invulnerable to the outside, yet as fragile and shy as a child.
And while he was still nodding, he felt that finger slipping all the way in, letting out a mixture of moan and gasp.
The road was arduous, and although Castiel reluctantly left Adam behind, he knew he needed to get the other man out of the way as his condition deteriorated rapidly. By joining forces, the three finally managed to get Adam's foot free again. That was a relief. With a nod, Cas pushed the radio into his hand.
"Do you mean the Casanova of Chicago?"
Cas sat up wide awake when he thought he heard voices.
Up to the part when his bank account was looted, he could tell when ...
The younger hunter knelt down and took his hand. Seeing the horror in the other's eyes, Sam knew something was wrong, and it scared him.
"Sit down and leave the rest to me."
Granted, the timid firefighter was a little uncomfortable with this situation. It was no use ... he had to go through it.
"Maddie!"
"Which of the three?"
Everyone involved hoped that there had been no action in the meantime.
"Your balls are different in size," the young policeman remarked.
After two hours, the nurse came and literally had to pull Dean away from his husband.
"Son of a bitch!" He shouted, but got no answer.
"Look, it took a long time. I've been waiting for you."
