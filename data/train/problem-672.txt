“Anyway, I’ll leave you be.” He walked around the bed and wanted to pass by Mycroft.
“These were really good, handsome. Thank you so much. Now clean up and come closer.” She said looking up at him. He quickly took everything back behind the paravent and returned. She stood in front of him and took his wrist. She led his hand up and placed it on her left breast.
This was John leaving it to Sherlock what to do. He could decide how their evening would turn out, which activities they were having and how rough it would become.
But he wanted him. He was so happy that they were finally together. They even had had sex.
“Sebby …” His hand twitched. Sebastian smiled.
“John, can you hear me? John?” He turned him around holding him in a dead man’s grip. John retched up some water but then coughed out:
“I can see there is still fight left in you. Some fighting in front of the camera will be appreciated for this film. You may fight, hit, kick, and lash out as much as you want. The final rape will be just wonderful!” He clapped his hands together and left the room.
Sebastian stared at Moriarty’s face and already started to plan the revenge.
“I can even keep up with his brother.” Rogers smirked and Greg laughed.
“Yes, Master.” He hurried away.
“John?” Sherlock said and John stopped by his armchair.
“Can't you wait any longer, brother-dear?” He smiled at his brother.
He quietly entered their flat and hung up his jacket. Sherlock didn’t see him and kept playing. John watched and listened.
“Sit with me for a moment, please.” She ushered him into a drawing-room and he sat down.
„Why would I do that? I thought you wanted to leave. I never wanted you to leave.“ He sipped some tea.
Sherlock actually felt sorry. He hadn’t meant to do
“This is very good progress, brother-dear. I am very proud of you. And I am sorry for Gregory. He must have suffered a lot and I didn't know. How could I understand his actions when not knowing of his past?” He sadly shook his head.
“You are getting my hopes up, Myc.” Mycroft leant in very close.
“I am not angry with you, love. You know that, don’t you?” He spoke into his back and felt the fine fabric of his dress shirt.
“We should leave the country but I have no idea how.”
“I never had a flatmate. Or any mate of sorts.”
“Exactly. Get your weapon and a torch. We are checking the shrubs.” Sherlock grinned. He was happy. John finished his fries on his way back to their car. He checked his gun and got the torches. Sherlock impatiently waited running small circles into the dirty ground.
“I never had sex before. You are my first. I want you to be my first. I wanted it for a very long time.” Sherlock roughly whispered.
Sherlock dangled his boxers before John's eyes and saw them widen. He slowly stuffed them into his mouth and held them inside until he felt him relax. Only then he wound wide medical tape around his mouth covering his lower face from chin up to under his nose. For a few seconds, John closed his eyes and breathed steadily through his nose.
Sherlock now pulled several instruments for collecting evidence from his pockets and picked up tiny fibres and things John wasn’t able to identify.
“No …” He shivered. Sherlock used one finger and scratched his nail over the bulge beneath John’s pyjama bottoms. He looked up at him and John bit his lips. He was panting already and Sherlock bathed in the power he held.
He leant against the kitchen counter and drank his coffee. Suddenly Sherlock’s door opened and he stood there. Their eyes met and John straightened up.
For a minute, they stared at each other until John felt him relax.
Sherlock gushed down his throat in several long, hot spurts and John took it all and spilt nothing.
“Sherlock!” A voice called out and someone quickly approached him. He twitched and jerked back but then he recognised his brother. He desperately looked up. Mycroft reached out and took off the thick gag.
“Yes, I am.”
“Yes.” Quietly spoken.
His thought process gained speed over the minutes.
“I prepared myself for you, Captain. I am wearing a plug.” The blush deepened when John quietly laughed.
“Open up wide!” He ordered and Sherlock opened his mouth. John pushed the ball behind his teeth but saw at once that he could use a bigger one. He chose the next bigger size and changed them. He shoved that one inside and it was much better. He fastened the buckles behind his neck and beneath his jaw. He also attached the harness to the swing.
After he had towelled himself dry, he slowly walked back into the living room. Sherlock stood beside the sofa and looked up when he entered the room.
“We will start tomorrow and your first appointment has already been made. Until then I have to do a few changes to the studio. You will wait upstairs in our playroom for the time being.”
“Relax…” John whispered into his ear and Sherlock really tried. The bubbles came on since John had brought the remote this time. It became better.
“It’s from my brother, Lestrade.” Greg looked at him and then at the envelope again. Then he slowly opened it and started to read. His brown eyes became large and he stored the letter in his jacket. He cleared his throat and Sherlock meant to see a faint blush on his face but he could be mistaken.
“What favour?”
“No, Sir. Captain, Sir.” Sherlock grinned showing his fangs. John set up the table in the meantime. He had even found some nice linen for it.
“He is strong. I felt his presence when he was seeing me. You asked him first to show you and he denied you.” Mycroft again nodded and felt rather stupid.
“May I come in?” He quietly asked and both men nodded.
John thought he looked like a child. Their eyes met again and he blushed. John stood and got him a napkin.
“You are safe now. You will be just fine in a few.” He roughly whispered. Moriarty blinked his eyes open and he looked exhausted and tired. But he smiled when seeing Sebastian.
“Anyway, look.” He pointed at the dead woman lying on the grass. There was a lot of blood that had seeped into the lawn. Sherlock swallowed. This was not good.
“I am a vampire, John, I can’t get sick.”
“I am not leaving.” He locked the car and followed the party into the hospital. Sebastian wanted to follow into the operation theatre but wasn’t allowed.
“Us.” They looked at each other and Greg pointed at Sherlock who just sat there staring into nothing.
“He was shocked, but he coped.”
“I can't start the car. Only the driver can. It's a matter of security.”
“And you will be staying here with me?”
“Sherlock? You have to wake up! You can’t sleep here!” John spoke louder.
“Yes, it is.” Greg returned the kiss and they stood close until dinner was ready.
John cleared his throat. Sherlock’s head shot around and he instantly relaxed.
He could wait. John could fuck him any time. Tomorrow or later in the night if he felt like it.
Sherlock opened it and got out a ridiculously expensive bag of crisps. He tore it open and offered it to John.
“No, Mistress.” She nodded.
“Yes.” John marked the paragraph.
“Perhaps, you might want to talk with my brother about it. I mean, he uses his power in his job. You have been with the military. It surely was helpful. I believe my brother might have some strategies that can help you. If you like. You don’t have to…”
When he was gone, John scanned the room for cameras or anything he could use. He needed to get rid of his restraints and run away. He leant against the wall and fumbled with the rope. He couldn’t reach the knot though; this had been done perfectly.
“John has been quite the busy, little bee, hasn’t he?” Mycroft mused tilting his head.
Sherlock rubbed his hands and waited for him to come back. When he did, John was wearing wide trackpants and a soft, old t-shirt. He looked great.
“Where is Sherlock?” Greg asked. Ian cast his eyes and the move surprised Greg.
It took Sherlock more than ten minutes to calm down again. John felt him tense and then he straightened up. John’s arms fell down and he let go.
Sherlock prepared two sandwiches for him and wrapped them in foil. He found yet another paper bag to store them and put everything into John’s bag.
“You heard exactly what I said.”
“Talk to me, John.” He quietly ordered. John looked at him for a few seconds and then just held up his arms. It was an answer, too, and it made Sherlock smile.
Sherlock was brooding.
“You don’t get it, do you? I am a police officer. I am with Scotland Yard. I do homicide. You can’t just borrow me for
Soon after he felt his slicked-up finger probing on him again. This time he stayed put. He just had to. Sherlock shoved his finger deep inside and pressed down on his prostate rather soon. The pleasure shot through his spine, his whole body, and he shook. Pain. Pleasure. He couldn't decide. He cried desperately. Sherlock giggled and added the second finger spreading them wide inside him. His cock hurt, his balls hurt, he hurt. But there was pleasure, too. He sucked on the plug inside his mouth to distract himself a bit.
“Come on, John, you need to get into bed. But bathroom first. Go!” John slowly got up and slumped away. Sherlock heard the loo and the water run. He undressed in the meantime and put John to bed when he came back out. He only brushed his teeth and joined John who was almost asleep but tried to stay awake to wait for Sherlock.
Finally, after two long hours of looking at many pictures, they had found their victim. They also rented a room in Birmingham that looked like a wonderful play-ground. They would leave the day after tomorrow but until then Sherlock had promised to look into the matter Mycroft had brought up.
If only Sherlock would have told him more about the case, he would have helped and forgot about his job. But it had felt like being wiped away, put to the side, and ignored.
Mycroft nodded his thanks and they quietly left again. They looked at the bed and Greg grinned up at him.
„Yes, we have. We are not insane.“ Mycroft snorted and Sherlock glared again. After a few seconds, the brothers laughed.
and it never sounded really nice.” John said tilting his head.
“But yes, I did! Would you like to try it at once?” He asked.
“Permission to speak, Master?” He trod very carefully.
He was aware of his whimpering but it didn’t matter. He felt perfectly fine.
Sherlock groaned and sucked and licked and did unspeakable things with his talented tongue. John knew he wouldn’t stand this for long and he wanted to fuck Sherlock. If he came now, he was fairly sure he wouldn’t manage a second time.
His driver stopped in front of Gregory’s place and he slowly left the car. He also sent him away. He had no idea how long he would need and how long he would stay or how long he would be allowed in.
“Do you have any other news regarding his clean-up?” Sherlock asked.
“I see.” He slowly said but Sherlock shook his head.
“It either means he is shielded or too far away. Or dead.” John became as pale as Mycroft.
“My advice? Show him what he misses. Make him jealous.” John was surprised.
“What happened?” Mycroft quietly asked and Greg just shook his head trying to come down. He needed another minute to collect his words.
“Look at me, John.” He looked up and found Sherlock was naked.
“You are stating the obvious. That’s why I am calling you.” Sherlock hummed.
“Thank you for the dinner invitation. It was a nice surprise in the midst of chaos.” Ian smiled and held out his hand.
Sherlock froze. The warmth of John’s hand invaded his skin. Blood shot south and he swallowed.
He stood in front of his bed and looked. He thought about his wank the other day and smiled. Then he pulled back the blanket and got into the middle of the mattress. He sat on his heels waiting for John to appear.
“He told me he expected you tonight and there you are. He will drop his work instantly. If not, make him. I know you can.” Greg raised a brow and wondered what Luke knew.
“You are perfect…” Sherlock said and agreed to his suggestion. John beamed and stood.
“Yes, I did. He was a bit sceptic after he read your file. But I am not. I think it will work. I really do. Together we can make it work.” John took the last of his wine and at once a new glass appeared on the table.
Sherlock swallowed. He was grateful but it wouldn't help after all.
Sherlock still stood where John had left him. And he still held back the tears. Ian approached him and pulled him into his arms. Sherlock even let him. He needed this, needed gentle touches, tender arms that simply held him.
He didn’t ask Greg to take his hand away.
“None.” He looked into his glass.
Sherlock slung his arms around him and held him tightly. John huffed against his t-shirt but hugged him back. It took him a moment until he understood Sherlock’s murmured words. He repeated them quietly over and over again and he was almost sobbing.
“Not to that extent, no. Not because I don’t trust you but because I can’t bend my body like this without causing damage to my muscles. So, unfortunately, no.” Greg shook his head.
“Hold me?” Greg smiled and Mycroft reached out for him. His long arms came around Greg’s body and he pulled him close.
“Let's leave this ugly place, shall we?” Anthea said helping her up. Mrs Hudson stood but her tiny body shook.
He wondered if he really should go shopping tomorrow. Perhaps, he should work on the case. But if he wouldn’t go tomorrow, he would never go because there would always be something.
“I know you. You were concentrated on the work. It’s all fine.” John tried to calm him down. Suddenly though Sherlock broke free and swung around holding a knife in one hand and a cucumber in the other.
And he wasn’t there. Sherlock drank coffee and ate two croissants with jam and cheese. He licked his lips and thought about his life. It wasn’t too bad. He got fed and bathed, so to say.
“Yes.” The landlady seemed to be pleased.
Sherlock had been excited but when they had gone to bed, John had just held him down. It wasn’t enough. Sherlock had wanted more.
“God, please, yes. Thanks, John.” Greg watched him while he prepared a meal for both of them. Just a risotto with vegetables and lamb. At least Greg hoped it was lamb that cooked in the pan.
“This training lesson is about moving around. You are not supposed to, that is the point. So, the lesson starts now.” He untied his genitals and pulled back his balls to put a humbler on him. No matter in what direction he moved now, he hurt himself. He was sweating and moaned behind the plug.
“No, I have to admit I fell asleep after some time.” He had the decency to blush.
A finger tipped lightly on his shoulder and he fell on his knees. The blindfold was taken away and two fingers tipped on his head and he knew to lower it and avert his eyes at all costs.
Sherlock turned around and left again. He quietly closed the door and joined Greg downstairs. Mrs Hudson was just bringing their snack and they sat down in both armchairs and the sofa. She poured tea for them and Greg gladly took a scone.
Sherlock still stared at him.
.” John looked at him.
John swayed up the seventeen stairs and disappeared into 221B after his dinner with Mrs Hudson. He went through a very short bathroom routine and fell into bed. He slept deeply and only woke the next morning when his mobile rang. He had set the alarm to get up early and pick up Sherlock.
“But I am doing this all the time. Why would he give
“The last time was when I was at university and I will never forget.” Sherlock nodded.
Mycroft Holmes had cleaned up his brother’s mess again. Well, not by himself, of course. He had minions to do this for him but anyway, it was worth it. The spray was perfect and he could use it, too.
“You have to guide me through it.” John quietly said and Sherlock patted the mattress.
Finally, after having made all the necessary decisions, he returned to the
“I need to get supplies from the pharmacy, Sherlock. I want you to rest now. Eat an ice-cream.” Sherlock stood but swayed on the spot only to fall down on the chair again. He quietly groaned.
“Yes, also my shoulder is aching a bit. It will be over soon. I just need a minute.” Sherlock thought about how he had restrained him. Of course, his shoulder hurt. It was his fault.
“I am looking like that because I am desperate. I am scared and frightened you had found me not good enough. It didn’t last long, what we did just now.” Sherlock shook his head looking at John now having freed himself out of the embrace.
“Eat some rice, too, please?” Greg said and Sherlock sighed but ate rice.
“This is it. I don't know more but you can start with these. You know how to use his computer?” Sherlock bit his lips to not answer the question the way he actually wanted. It would have come out very impolite.
Sherlock felt John’s eyes on him and he slowly turned his head and lowered it close to him.
“I understand why this must have shocked you. But I needed to tell you. Now get up and do whatever. Come back to my side when you are ready.” Sherlock swallowed and slowly stood. He left the kitchen and left through the back door. He fled into the garden. He had found it earlier and walked through to the end. There he sat leaning against the wall and closed his eyes.
Sherlock couldn't find any rest. The pain was intense and he had to admit to himself that he was scared. But he couldn't do anything, he could just wait for what was going to happen to him. He was alone. But he also knew that Mycroft would do anything to rescue him and so would John. And Greg.
The water filled Sherlock's stomach and it didn't feel good. He closed his eyes and started to relax his body. This would be painful and he knew it. John filled him up with a lot of water and it sloshed around inside him. John touched his stomach and actually felt the cold seeping through his skin. He grinned and sat on the closed toilet lid.
“If you behave badly and embarrass me...” John roughly whispered and pressed his wrist hard. He made hit hurt.
“Why don’t you come along? You can give some great advice for both the cake and my clothes.” Sherlock’s face lightened up.
“They think I could work as a doctor again, that’s why.”
He moaned, groaned, and sweated. He imagined John was doing these things to him. He had vivid images in his mind.
“Do you need a break, Mycroft?” Greg asked halfway through. Mycroft nodded.
“What are you doing?” Sherlock slowly turned his head and his cheekbones were flushed already.
“Why isn’t he here?” Sherlock asked.
“I am sorry...” He sobbed and started to cry openly. Greg pulled him into his strong arms and held him.
John came back with a towel around his waist. He raised his eyebrow at the erected penis but just passed by and went upstairs where he still had his clothes. He dressed and knew he had to do some washing. Downstairs he asked Sherlock:
“They will never find her body. She has just disappeared and everybody will assume a suicide after what happened to her. You don’t have to worry.”
After the twentieth stroke he shoved the riding-crop into his behind and Sherlock was trembling badly. But he held his position.
“What the fuck are you doing?” He asked glaring at him. His cock tented the blanket already again.
“This is your living room, too. Just do as you please.” Then he started to read and sipped his tea.
“You look exhausted.” He said standing up.
When he heard Greg, he turned around.
Sherlock raised a brow. What the fuck? He rarely swore but now he did. This was utterly suspicious. He dropped the card and unfolded the piece of paper. It was a dinner invitation and it was a
“Get into this. We are leaving. I’ll tell you on the way. Just do it.” He insisted and John could see that it was serious. He dressed into the robe and felt rather awkward. Sherlock hadn’t thought about slippers and he padded after him over the aisle.
“I have just talked to Sherlock. He went to see his brother for help. He called me after having spoken to him and I have to say, I am shocked. I am shocked about your behaviour towards Sherlock.” John really had no excuse. He knew that and therefore didn’t say a word.
“Yes, well. But I want you to close them around your wrists.” With shaking hands Sherlock took the cuffs back and closed them tightly. Afterwards, John forced his head down, so he could see his hands.
“Well. Then let’s kiss, shall we?” Greg just took both their tumblers and placed them on the table. Then he leant in and placed his lips on Mycroft’s. He felt his unmoving body but he also felt his beating heart. He also turned his head to the side again. Greg could feel him trembling.
“Nothing. It's just, I like to see you eat.” John shrugged and Sherlock’s cheekbones were covered in a shade of red. John found he liked that look.
Then his stomach rumbled. He rubbed over his middle and sighed. It was time for dinner. John really hoped there would be any dinner. He decided to look for them and find out. He left their room and slowly walked down the large stairs. He really enjoyed staying here. It was a beautiful house and he wondered whom it belonged to. The government? Mycroft? Someone else?
“What is it?” He quietly asked taking the folder.
John hissed under the spray.
John knew that there was the ring gag waiting but he decided against it. He wanted to feel Sherlock and enjoy his skills. And he was very skilled with this.
“Gods, you are so tight …” Sherlock kept moving very slowly and shivered while holding back.
“Let’s begin, shall we?” He asked looking up at him and Sherlock nodded.
„Your turn.“ Sherlock just said and they changed places.
“I am glad I am here with you now. Right now, I am feeling well. Relaxed. You have invited me.” Mycroft shakily inhaled and shook his head. “In addition, I am babbling utter nonsense.” He cast his eyes and his cheekbones were covered in a fine red.
“Yes, Mistress.” He quickly went into the bath and cleaned up his face. He piled his hair up as his dom had shown him. He hurried into the kitchen and collected everything he needed for the pie.
Mycroft let him take his hand but stood rather stiffly. He looked down his long nose at him.
“I do. Thank you, both of you.” They all started to eat before Mycroft told them anything. John's feelings were in turmoil but he made it. He could throw up later. Now he needed to hear what Mycroft had to tell them.
“I wondered about jelly or ice-cream?”
“Do what? Cuddle? Then they were stupid because this, with you, is just wonderful.” Sherlock relaxed.
“Thank you!” He quickly left and looked for his team. He briefed them rather quickly but was thorough nonetheless. Only Sally knew about his relation to Mycroft Holmes.
“Soon he dished out punishments. He badly hurt me. He whipped me, paddled me. You saw my welts, my bruises. My scars. You saw the collar.” Completely unconsciously his hand came up and touched his neck. He even carefully scratched over his skin where only a few irritations were seen. Dr Kim had done good work.
“You know, safewords are as much for you as they are for me. I should have used them. I should have seen you were in a stress-position for far too long and what it would cause you. So, it is really my fault. I was responsible for you and I failed you. I am anything but a so-called
Sherlock had changed into a t-shirt and boxers sometimes during the night and now didn’t bother changing. He pulled John along and showed him the text. John kept his gun with him. He was awake and on alert. His eyes were bright blue and adrenalin pumped through his body.
“No, I am not. He was on the crime scene. He seemed to be impressed.” James smiled.
They enjoyed their food and Mycroft went inside to get them a bottle of wine. Sherlock tensed. He had forgotten the wine or any drink. He suddenly felt cold and Greg saw how he felt. He placed his hand on his arm.
“I like your choice and will put it on right away.” But at first, he had to pull Sherlock’s balls to get rid of his erection. Sherlock suppressed the noise he wanted to make but hunched his shoulders and scrunched his eyes closed.
“It's time, Sherlock. Let's go.” They stood and Ian opened the door to let them out. Greg checked the surroundings but didn't see anything suspicious.
Mycroft though showed no mercy. He even increased the plug’s intensity until Greg’s whole body shook and he started to wail. The moment he sagged, it stopped.
“Now relax. I am going to pull this thing out and get in myself. But first, I want to hear you. And don’t forget to look me into the eyes. Come on, gorgeous!” Sherlock moved his head so he could look at John.
“He was complaining already. He missed Sebastian. And he was jealous.”
“I am all rumpled...” He said but Ian kept pulling him into the living room.
“How is he?”
“Well, let me explain to you how nice this Jim is to my mate.” John bluntly said and started to talk. She sat up against the headrest while John was talking. After he had finished, she looked at them again.
“Are you angry with me?” He asked quietly. John inched a bit closer remembering the fact that Sherlock didn’t want them out in the open.
“You have been good at this. Good enough for an orgasm anyway.” Sherlock kept sobbing when John grabbed his prick and started to move his strong fingers. His body gave him no choice but to react. Soon he was hard as a rock.
“Perfect. Now you can come and go until the rules are changed. Only his brother has the same security level. It makes you special.” Luke grinned a bit beastly.
“Thank you, my Captain.” He whispered and kissed John’s palm.
“I am happy in our relationship. Don’t assume things, OK? I will take our relationship wherever we want it to go. But you can’t expect me to know things if you don’t talk to me.”
“How are you doing, John?” John turned his head.
John smirked while he pushed his finger inside. He was still wide from wearing the plug for hours. He would be wide enough anyway due to all the fucking. He found his prostate and circled it, pressed down, and rubbed over it.
“I trust you, John, not to do anything stupid.” Mycroft quietly said coming closer again. John's head shot up.
“Very nice, dear brother.” Sherlock put it back and examined the boots and Hunters. He approved of these, too. Finally, there was a rainproof jacket, a hat, and a new scarf. The colours were dark but Mycroft didn’t want to be seen. He needed to be inconspicuous.
Sherlock had found out he was quite a fighter and a very skilled marksman. Plus, he was also a doctor who could prove useful to Sherlock.
“Hold on just a second.” He dashed into the bath and quickly brushed his teeth. John understood, he didn't want to be kissed after what he had just done with his tongue.
“This is really nice, isn’t it?” Sherlock quietly asked looking into his tumbler.
“Very good. See you later. Both of you.” And gone he was. Greg smiled shaking his head.
“Yes, you would be immobile. You would also be immobile and could do nothing when being tied up.” John replied and Sherlock hummed.
“Very well, Dr Watson. May I offer you something?” Mycroft asked politely.
“Being with you, knowing I would come home, was the only thing that brought me through the bloody events of today. Without you, I would have drunk too much and blackout probably.” Sherlock’s eyes widened in shock.
“They are gone. They have taken the lab away. I don’t believe that!” Sherlock was very angry. Greg rubbed over his face.
“Thank you, Master, for providing food and water for your helpless slave.” Sherlock said.
He took him off the bondage-chair and almost gently carried him over to the bed. Sherlock groaned and his eyes were barely open. He tiredly blinked up at his dom and waited for something nice. But for now, his dom just towered above him.
“Gregory?” Mycroft asked holding him still up. Greg kept panting for some seconds and then swallowed.
“Perhaps I need to make myself clear. Another no-go is slave-play.” Sherlock paled.
“Aren't you jealous?” He wondered. John shook his head.
The cab stopped and they got out. Sherlock led the way up to some stairs and didn’t even have to ring a bell or use a door knocker. The door just clicked open and Sherlock entered. John followed suit.
“Let me finish my sentence first. Come on and have a drink. I’ll be ready in a minute.”
They had breakfast together until John had to leave. He kissed him.
Sherlock’s hands were on top of John’s and covered them completely. He also was wide-awake now. From behind, he felt John’s arousal.
“Come over here and sit with me, please? You need to relax.” Mycroft sat on the sofa and Greg sat by his side. Mycroft’s back was straight and he sat on the edge looking rather stiff.
“You do remember when I was in the hospital and Mycroft tried to hold you back?” Sherlock asked.
Anthea parked directly in front of the stairs leading up to the entrance. Sherlock got out the moment the car had barely stopped. John and Greg followed suit and so did Anthea. She passed by Sherlock and had both her eyes and hand scanned. The door clicked open and Sherlock raised his brows looking at her.
“Very well. I look forward to the experience.”
Forensic was set up in another room and he got to work. He was still dressed in his posh suit and John left him alone with the woman to work.
“Nothing bad will happen to you, do you hear me?” John said and Sherlock nodded. John sighed and motioned to the crib. Sherlock climbed inside and got on his back. He actually wondered why his dom ensured him about that. He had done much worse to him and never minded it.
He arrived at Mycroft's place and wondered what he would find inside. He entered the building and hung up his jacket. He at once got rid of his shoes and padded along.
“Sure. Would you like a man-cave on the attic?” Mycroft grinned and Greg relaxed.
“I should think so since Greg brought tons of food.” They looked at each other. Then Sherlock gently nudged John with his protruding hipbone and made him move.
“He had me tied up and watch them being tortured. He did that himself. At the end he made some cuts over their penises and testicles and warned them off. I never saw them again. I heard of Victor's suicide though.” Greg wasn't sure if he could touch him now but he just tried. Sherlock let him and relaxed into his arms.
John sighed and Sherlock looked very, very angry.
He opened the door and looked for John. The living room was empty though. Where was John?
“Stay down!” He yelled and hit him right on the side of his arm. Sherlock lost his stance and fell back. The pain was crucial and he shouted out his hurt. But he stayed down.
“I suggest to go in there. Would you like to wait here or shall I call you later?” Greg asked and Ian really didn't have to think about it.
“That’s right. But I promise to make it good for you.” He really looked eager.
“Yes.”
“I think, he is OK now. He is in the bath and my brother tries to make breakfast.”
“Well, Dr Watson. He actually took me to Paris. We stayed in a not so fancy hotel and at first, I was pissed. But Sebby showed me that there was so much to observe. Other people, normal people. Then he took me into Euro Disney.” His eyes were on fire when he told John everything.
“Have fun tomorrow. There is CCTV over here and I will enjoy every single minute.” Sherlock watched him leave. He didn’t mind him watching.
“Please, just be with me …” He almost whispered the words and Sherlock smiled.
“I got distracted.”
“I know it is hard for you to have me around without... Well, you know. But I admit freely that I need you close. I am being selfish because it will make you suffer. I do understand if you have to deny me.” But Ian shook his head.
“Get down on your front and relax” Sherlock ordered and John simply climbed on the bed. His body was warm and he felt great. He was going to submit very quickly, in fact, he already had.
“Everything I could wish for, everything I want, is you.” Sherlock helplessly shrugged looking at John.
“How many times…” John shook his head.
“What?”
John turned to Sherlock who looked pleased.
John pushed him away.
Greg had started to run after Sherlock but got hit by something. It stuck in his back and he couldn't reach it. He knew by heart it wasn't a bullet that had hit him. He very well knew how it felt to get shot and how a bullet inside his body felt.
“My backside still hurts. Some of my scars are itching and pulling my skin. I slept without waking.” Dr Kim nodded.
“Absolutely. There is video footage if you want.” Mycroft offered and Sherlock opened his eyes.
He watched Sherlock's cabin touch down and he hurried up to his side bringing his coat. He saw that Sherlock was paler than usual. He carefully laid his hand on his arm.
“No, John! This terrible excuse for a piece of clothing!” He pinched him through the jumper. John swatted his hand away.
“No, please, don't. This is your past, this is you. I want every single piece of you. Mate.”
They sat in the library and looked at each other. Greg was worried because Mycroft's face didn't show anything.
“Sherlock, how are you doing?”
“I will do that, Detective Inspector.” He stood and brought him to the door.
“Where are you?” He called out because only his coat was on the hardwood and the man himself was nowhere to be seen.
“You bastard!” He was up and over Mycroft in mere seconds and looked into his smirking face.
“Not all the time, no. It seems you haven’t orgasmed for longer?” Sherlock shrugged.
“You are not telling me has run away, are you?” Sherlock whispered.
Mycroft, in the meantime, stood in front of the room where his younger sibling was waiting. He looked at the judge who nodded. The guard stood still outside, too. He exhaled and then pushed down the handle.
“Stockings?” Sherlock looked hectically.
“Yes, it was. It was meant for you. My backside will hurt for quite some time.”
“Anyway. Thanks for listening to me, John. See you soon!” They hung up and John exhaled. He wondered if it could work between Greg and Mycroft as it did for him and Sherlock. He very much hoped so because Mycroft deserved someone to love. Just like Sherlock.
“So, you don't like your coffee?” Greg closed his eyes and sighed.
Slowly, Mycroft got up and pulled Greg with him. He reached out for his nipples. Two fingers of each hand took a nipple and started to pull and pinch them. Greg moved on the spot but Mycroft followed his every move. He groaned loudly from behind the ballgag but it was nicely muffled.
“How are you?” He closed the door and came closer. He carried a paper bag.
John sat on the bed and moved some hair off his forehead.
“Nothing like you, brother mine.” Mycroft picked up all his bags and left.
“Is it your birthday?” John didn’t give up.
“John? Where are you? I am dying ...” John grinned and munched his toast. He already felt better.
John fucked him for a very long time and Sherlock made the most interesting noises.
Sherlock carefully moved over to the window to have a look but John pulled him back.
“I promise to do that from now on.” Mycroft whispered.
“I am not sure. I mean, these things won't be done to me. I am just watching you or demonstrate perfect behaviour.”
“I appreciate it, James. I really do.”
James. Jim. Jimmy. Oh, God! What would he think if he ever found out? He would kill him. Slowly. He was sweating but the fear slowly disappeared.
“Please, Sherlock. Be careful or you will inflame your nose.” Sherlock looked up and their eyes met.
“Not this time. I think. I don’t know.” Sherlock did look confused, John thought. He was getting more curious by the second. However, at first, he wanted to finish his ice cream.
“Clean up, change the bedding and plug yourself for the rest of the night. You need to be alert for tomorrow. Set an alarm, too.”
But still, he just wanted to sleep. Go to bed. Perhaps take a bath first.
“Of course not! What do you think?” John said not very convincingly. Sherlock poked him into his belly button.
“Sherlock, come here. I want you.” John said and at once Sherlock fell down on his knees and crawled over to him. He assumed position and John placed his palm flat on his head.
“What are you thinking about?” He quietly asked.
“Will there be a reward if I make it?” Sherlock was getting excited.
John became more enthusiastic. He held his cock and his nose touched his pubic hair. He licked and sucked rather rudely and sometimes he caught his skin between his teeth but Sherlock liked it. His teeth were bared around the ball-gag and sometimes the pain made a tear fall over his cheek.
“I bet you really are hungry now, right? Sit up and eat, mate.” Sherlock happily obliged. This was an order and he sat up. His hole was still sore and it hurt. But it was nothing in comparison. He had gone through so much more.
“It was a present for the weekend. But we might need to stay longer to solve this. He won’t pay for an extended stay, I suppose.” John sighed and fondly thought about the whirlpool.
“What would you do to stop me? Restrain me?” Ice-cold spoken. It made John shiver.
John decided to give Mycroft a call tomorrow, so he could finally find out about Sherlock’s past.
“It's our only lead anyway. We are going to Scotland, too.” Mycroft stood.
“It feels just wonderful having you so close to me.” John replied and already tightened his hold.
“What would be wrongdoing all this if he likes it?” Sherlock quietly asked shifting on the spot.
“I would like to.” John finished his wine and slowly stood.
“There you are. I want you to prepare our dinner tonight. We will have a nice dinner and afterwards I will do as you wish. How does that sound, pet?” John looked into his eyes and saw he was close to tears.
“John, how is Sherlock?” She asked looking all worried. John put up a tired smile.
“Master, please. I...” His dom held up a finger and Sherlock stopped at once.
“I killed. It’s livestock. Do you know what this means?” Sherlock asked.
“John?” Sherlock yelled from the bath making John jerk once. He went to see him.
“I am glad to hear it.” Sherlock quietly said. In addition, he ate more than he normally would. He wanted to please John, show him how much he liked his meal. Moreover, surprisingly he was hungry.
“Are you telling me you need help, so you won't pee on the hardwood?” John nodded. But what happened next wasn't what he thought of. Sherlock retrieved a diaper. John's eyes widened and he shook his head making noises. He moved back.
“Then go and sit in the library. I will bring you dinner and pour a drink for you.”
“Maybe?” John replied. Sherlock just pointed to the hardwood and John knelt. His arms came up and he folded his hands on his nape.
He swallowed and knocked on the door. John opened it being rather surprised. Sherlock wrung his hands but finally told him. John followed him into his bed, leaving the action to him. He simply adjusted to Sherlock’s wishes.
“What now?” Sherlock asked and John just looked at him.
“Lycan as in shape-shifter. They don't like to be called weres. It's like calling us leeches.”
“No, you wanted to see if we were shagging. Admit it. You are jealous.” Mycroft examined the carpet while John choked on his tea.
Then two police officers pulled the suspect out of the water. He was unconscious and John was happy to let the medics do their job. He actually didn’t want to help him. He wanted to stay with Sherlock.
John was looking forward to the dinner event. He had only heard about these
“Yes, when you were balancing between a blackout and an orgasm. But you never fully dropped. If this is your favourite thing, it should work.” Sherlock expectantly smiled at him.
“Very well ...”  Sherlock felt John tremble in his bonds, but he also was hard. Everything was fine. Very slowly he fucked him with the anal beads and John didn't move a bit.
“To us.” Sherlock lifted his glass and looked into John’s eyes.
“You can buy it now. Take my card.” He brought him a mug with coffee.
“Oh, please. We have passed that stage, haven't we, Detective Inspector? Call me Irene.” She poured the whiskey herself without calling the maid.
“I can’t possibly force myself any longer on you, Gregory. And the air is cleared, as you have said. We are good, aren’t we?” Mycroft carefully asked.
Ian had stopped working to keep eyes on John and find out what happened. He had talked to several men of John's criminal organisation. He also tried to track Sherlock who was rather successful.
“What do you want?” He tried to stay calm.
“Do you trust me?”
John had been watching his struggles and wondered how far he would go. The moment he was halfway up he kicked him into the back. Sherlock shouted out in pain but was muted by the cruel medical gag. He crashed on the hardwood and groaned. But he didn't give up yet and surprised John. He got his knees under himself and came up again. The blindfold was still on and so were the ropes around his wrists, but they had gotten loose.
“In here, Gregory.” He replied and watched him enter.
Sherlock sobbed and whimpered when cum mixed with blood gushed out of his behind. His insides were raw and he had felt no condom. This stranger had just raped him without a condom.
Greg only had to spread his arms wide and embrace him. He hugged him tight and Sherlock groaned but didn't let go. Greg looked around Sherlock’s body and Ian pulled a face. Greg loosened his grip.
Greg gently pressed his heels into the horses’ side and it started to move forward in a medium trot. He could manage that. The stable boy had also told him that his horse knew the way. He simply let it go and held on.
Slowly he got up on his knees and his mad blue eyes stared at Greg.
“Oh, but I can. You know everything. You are ripe. You are experienced. Please?” She giggled.
The Russian left the room but the other man spoke up. He had a nondescript English accent.
“Could we perhaps have a new table in the kitchen to have breakfast? This is too large and too cold for me.” Greg asked while taking things from the buffet.
“Return from where?”
He could leave with him after the appointment tomorrow. In Russia, people would pay even more money for these extreme sex-things. He had noticed the sales into that area and was convinced it would work.
He sat in his armchair and pulled his long legs under. He took his computer and started to work.
“John?” Sherlock stood by his side and made him look up. John at once concentrated on him and smiled.
“We need to do some research. Let’s take both our computers and divide the topics. We are quicker than and time is of the essence.” John just nodded and stood.
“I did this?” He whispered and stared at the prominent bulge in Greg’s trousers.
“See? I am going to eat and then I’ll go to sleep. You can go now.” He smirked. John shook his head and quickly pecked a kiss on his cheek.
„Needles.“ Sherlock suddenly stated and John swallowed.
Mycroft very thinly smiled when he gave him a once-over. John was only dressed in his birthday suit.
John moved his head up and down in a very quick pattern. He held him in position until he heard him gag. He lowered his head.
„What is, Sherlock? Enlighten us, please?“ John smiled one of his less pleasant smiles. Lestrade thought John had several smiles for every occasion. This one wasn't nice but Sherlock of course didn't notice.
Greg raced away rather angrily but was self-disciplined enough not to endanger any other drivers. He slowed down and moved the fancy SUV through the landscape. The display didn’t work and there was no music. But there was a place to charge your mobile and he tried that. Soon music came out of the speakers and he relaxed. Soon it also rang and the display on top of the windscreen showed the caller ID. It was Anthea. He raised a brow but hit the button on the wheel to answer her call. It was probably because of the borrowed car.
“Do whatever you please but don't expect me to help. I didn't mean to hurt your brother and you know it. I will go back to my flat. You know where to find me whenever you have come back to your senses.” Then he turned to face Sherlock. He actually went down on his knees and tried to look into his eyes but it wasn't possible. He didn't touch him though.
And then he remembered what his dom had told him and how he had fought. But he obviously hadn't. He had dreamed all of this. But he had in fact panicked and behaved shamefully. He had disappointed his dom and it would have consequences. Perhaps he should try and appease him?
“Not at all, Mrs Hudson. Perhaps I can talk Sherlock into visiting you in 221A.” He led her out to his waiting sedan and they rode away.
Later that afternoon Sherlock had showered and now sat on a chair with his dom behind him. He was arranging his hair. Afterwards he dressed into one of his suits, shirt, and polished shoes. He had licked them clean earlier this day and now they looked perfect.
“Only because you are a dom, you are not to tell me how to feel or behave. No one ever will again. And now you can go. Since you are of no use to get me out of here, just leave me alone!” And he turned his head away.
“Sherlock, is it OK if I light a fire?” He turned his head.
“I only want to know what happened. Today. With Lestrade. You know.” Mycroft smiled.
“I need to know more about the relationship between Sherlock and his brother Mycroft.”
“Didn’t you want to see your brother?” John innocently asked. Sherlock checked the time and nodded.
“Mycroft, John is right. Don't harm her. She is just a human being.” Raven rumbled close to him.
“No problems, Dr Watson. I am here only to give you some much-needed advice.” Now John raised a brow. Moriarty sat down in front of his desk and John leant against it. He crossed his legs and folded his arms over his chest.
“Dr Watson is sicker than I thought.” She shook her head.
“Remember quickly because I don’t want you to fall asleep with them.” John sternly said.
“Yes, absolutely. He probably will still be angry and shout abuse at you. Just listen to him, tell him sorry and promise you will do better in the future.” Sherlock lit a second cigarette.
“May it have some dessert, please?” John just looked at him and then waved for the slave who took the empty plate back. He brought him a bowl with pudding afterwards. Chocolate pudding with berries. Sherlock greedily eyed it.
“Assembling his office.” Mycroft replied.
“Fuck you!” He spit it out and earnt another laughter.
“I only wish I had the money to buy suitable toys for us to play with.” He sounded sad and Sherlock reached out.
“Let's get out of here. Wherever to.” She slowly started to walk holding on to Anthea.
“I know you don’t want to hurt me. But you scared me already and that’s why we need to talk and sort ourselves out. Being helpless does very much apply to me. I love bondage, being blind and forced to do stuff.” Mycroft moved deeper into the sofa and his embrace. He also hummed.
“Nice, isn't it?” Greg simply nodded.
“Yes? Is it forbidden to care of one's boyfriend? Do you think it perverted?” Now he looked smug and Greg slanted his eyes.
“There you are, slut. You made it. I am so proud of you.” He patted his head and Sherlock almost cried. His lips quivered when he croaked out his thanks.
Sherlock had no idea what else to ask.
“Yes, I actually was.” He replied softly.
“Who just called?” John finally asked.
“Wouldn't he like to come along?” Ian asked but Greg shook his head.
“He will be coming by tomorrow.” John replied.
“Nothing. Not yet.” He grabbed his coat and John slipped into his shoes.
His body was sore and covered in welts and scars. Twice a day the shower ran over him automatically to wash away all the blood and gore. He wasn’t able to escape the cold water gushing out of the walls and ceiling.
He had fallen asleep and an oxygen mask covered his face. John had told the nurse to give him some nutrition as well and watched him sleep peacefully. His pulse was just fine and John sat on the edge of the bed.
“Yes, it has. I had a look already. The skin on your cock is a bit rough. The same with your wrists and ankles. Your nipples and balls might be sensitive for a while.” John said with a grin.
“Ow!” He shouted making Mycroft laugh.
“Your darling brother is finally having a good time, Myc. Don't spoil it.” He said from behind. Suddenly Mycroft stared over the edge and Greg lifted his eyes.
“They showed me in therapy. It was the only thing I liked. It was good. It helped me relax.”
Sherlock looked at his dom until he disappeared from his view. Only then he quietly followed the guard. A door was opened for him.
This worked perfectly well and John pulled out again without having come and cleaned his cock. He walked around Sherlock and lifted him to the right height. He took the head harness off and ruffled through his hair.
“Where is my dom?” Sherlock asked and Mycroft dropped his hand.
“Here you go. Enjoy.” He said handing over the little plate. John looked at it.
And he was a bit worried because he thought Sherlock didn’t eat and sleep enough.
“You don't have menus in your kitchen drawer like any sensible person?” Greg wondered but grinned.
John took the head on his tongue and closed his lips firmly around it. Then he sucked hard. Sherlock screamed and yelled and fought against the ropes. John moved lower and soon bopped on Sherlock’s cock. He wasn’t used to this and choked on his own saliva and Sherlock’s pre-cum. Sherlock laughter was muffled but it stopped when John pulled the chain between the clamps. Sherlock yelled and John kept the strain by holding it tight.
“Jesus!” John dropped the glass but Sherlock caught it.
Anthea in the meantime had texted her boss who had given her the final go. She called in assistance and an ambulance. She met the security team in front of the asylum located close to Heathrow. She showed them a picture of Mrs Hudson and they entered the place.
“Yes, John.”
It extremely aroused him.
Soon he had Sherlock’s long limbs folded on his chest and pressed down. His cock was caught between their bodies and he hurt. He pinched his nipples and twisted them evilly making him scream and yell again several times until he was close to losing his voice.
“I suggest wearing something less restrictive. Get into one of your trackpants. No underwear.”
Sherlock understood that this was a so-called
Instead, he sat on a chair and watched Lestrade try on several pairs of trousers and shirts. He actually gave him some good and honest meant advice and Greg happily bought the things Sherlock recommended.
“No. You need to hear it. Otherwise you will stop being so adorable. And I don’t want that!”
“May I? Please? I need to touch you…” Greg begged and after two seconds Mycroft nodded. Greg pushed him gently back into the sofa and opened his belt and buttons. Mycroft closed his eyes and tried to relax. He was thinking. He always was thinking.
John’s vice-like grip finally relaxed a bit but he didn’t let go. He sat on top of Sherlock and looked at him.
“Yes, John.” Sherlock felt better now. John wasn’t angry with him. But there was something. He could feel it. He opened the bottle of wine and took two glasses from the very back of the cupboard. He also took the bottle of Lagavulin and cleaned two glasses. He put everything on a wooden tray and carried it over to their armchairs in front of the fire. He saw John looking at him. These blue eyes really made him self-conscious. He had no idea why. He poured their drinks and sat down, too.
“Damn you, Myc! Just provide me with his number! I owe you a favour.” John was able to hear the snickering over the mobile and shook his head. Finally, Sherlock hung up and at once started to type a number. Now John was listening up.
A moan escaped his lips and he looked more than delighted. He drank it down.
“You bet.” Sebastian said. Then he snivelled again and Sherlock handed him some more tissues.
Mycroft leant back in his chair and looked at him. Their eyes met and Greg questioningly raised a brow.
“Should any problem appear during your ride, there is a gun hidden in the side of the door. The car is both bomb- and bulletproof. Please, do not push any buttons you are not sure about.”
John heard the sound and poked his body. No reaction at all. He smiled. Then he started to cut off the foil from his face. He pulled out the tube. Sherlock didn’t move or even twitched. John shoved a large towel under his body and cut off the rest of the foil. He had pissed a lot. John was hard. He stuffed everything into a large plastic bag and carried it outside. When he returned Sherlock had moved on his side and was sleeping. John knew the difference by now. He got a bowl with warm water and tenderly moved the washcloth over his skin. Sherlock let out low sounds indicating he was going to wake up in a few. John covered him with the blanket anyway.
“Please, drink this.” His hand was still a bit shaky but he downed the whole amount. They looked at each other.
“Well, well. Slut.” He pressed on his still confined cock. John managed to stand still in his grip but his mouth stood open and his pupils were completely dilated. Sherlock whispered:
“For now, yes.” He said and walked forward.
“You couldn’t have expected to be attacked. You just have to make sure that Sherlock stops blaming himself for what happened to you.” He spoke quietly.
He opened his eyes and met Sherlock’s worried ones.
“Don't fall asleep. We are almost there.” Mike had to help him into the hospital where he was placed on an examination table. Anthea wanted to leave the room but Sherlock snatched her hand.
“Look at me, please?” John insisted and pulled his hand. It made Sherlock look up. Their eyes met.
“I think I need a snack. What about you?” Sherlock nodded and quickly rolled out of bed.
“A little bit.” Sherlock replied but kept holding him. John tried to push back but failed because Sherlock wouldn’t let go.
“Get your socks and shoes off. Move your hips and shake your trousers off.” He once pulled his hair to make himself very clear and Sherlock just did it. Now he ripped off his silken boxers and forced them into his mouth by pressing his fingers into his jaw. His eyes were wide open when he tasted his own pre-cum on the soiled fabric. John got hold of his blue scarf and pressed it behind his teeth. He knotted it tight behind his head. He once pinched his cock and made him yell into the gag. It was perfect. John grinned and stood pulling him up with him. He shoved him over to his bed and made him kneel again.
“I like to see you eat.” John smiled and Sherlock focused on a little piece of butter clinging to the left side of his mouth. He leant forward and licked it off. John flushed a rosy red.
John talked to himself.
John saw that it didn't like the bath. Normally it enjoyed getting cleaned up, showered, or bathed but now Its body was tense and it shook. John rubbed a towel over his skin and covered him with a bathrobe. He walked him upstairs and into his bedroom.
Finally, he ended up with a pair of designer jeans and a cashmere pullover with a t-shirt underneath. He slipped into soft leather brogues and arranged his hair. He took a leather jacket and ignored his umbrella by the door. He wondered where to put keys, wallet, and other items when his eyes fell on Greg's shoulder-bag. He had left it behind when storming out.
“What are you thinking about, pet? You are far away!” John poked into his stomach and Sherlock was back.
“Aren't there, my dear?” Mycroft entered the room. He had been drinking to calm down and by his side walked a big black wolf. Obviously, Raven had changed and the show-off was perfect. She sucked in her breath. Then she looked at Mycroft who politely smiled showing his fangs. The wolf moved over to David and then placed his paws on the bed. She pulled up her legs.
“And I thought you knew your game!” He hissed into his ear.
“I realised only lately that I have feelings for you. I couldn’t admit it earlier. Not to you and not to myself. I didn’t see your pain when I left for dates I actually didn’t want. I spoke to myself about it. You. My sister was in my head.” John laughed and shook his head. “I love you too, Sherlock.”
“God, Mycroft. This is so good. You are amazing…” Mycroft had no idea what to say and instead pressed his lips back on Greg’s. He also embraced him and pulled him closer. Greg ended up tightly pressed against the back of the sofa and relaxed beneath him. He tilted his head up and let Mycroft do as he liked.
John washed his hands and disinfected them, too. He had his med-kit close and at first had a look into Sherlock's throat.
“First of all, I want you to get on your knees with your chest on the floor. Spread your knees and hold the position.” John could hear him grab the bag and open a pack of lube.
“What did John say when you asked him?” Now Ian grinned.
Sherlock returned into his armchair and closed his eyes again. His fingertips touched over his chin and he thought about what just happened.
“Traitor? Here?” Greg nodded and explained. She became angry.
“No, he was just worried. He normally never gets furious. At least privately. It’s different on crime scenes when I am around.” Sherlock pulled a face.
Sherlock screamed and screamed and pissed into the bottle filling it to the brim.
“Well, I'll be going
“It was quite a bit scary…” Greg said.
“It’s Lestrade. He is on his way over here. You don’t mind, do you?” They looked at each other.
His eyes were piercingly examining John’s cock. He probably had his measurements saved somewhere already. John was close and didn’t want to come. He wanted to come inside Sherlock.
He actually knew he couldn't afford to buy things there. He also thought Sherlock needed to be taught a lesson.
“You were exhausted, old man.” He smirked. John glared.
“Sherlock, please do address John directly.” Sherlock nodded but did not repeat his words.
His dom would have him raped in front of a camera. But not only raped but humiliated. He had seen what was in here, inside his former bedroom. He felt he had lost everything by now. He would never recover from this. He would suffer for a long time and could only hope for a few moments of peace and quiet.
“I don’t know how to do this.”
“I was. I hurt; I still do. But I can’t deny the feelings I am having for you.” Sherlock smiled.
Sherlock’s wrists hurt. The pain radiated up his arms, over his shoulders and down his spine. It ended between his legs and made his cock pulse.
“Good evening, old man.” John slanted his eyes.
Greg had joined them for breakfast after his shower. And now he kissed Mycroft good-morning and ruffled Sherlock's hair. Mycroft obviously relaxed.
“I bought everything you wanted.” Mycroft said not thinking.
Sherlock pretended to sleep. He heard John leave his bedroom and then move around. He was on the phone and didn’t leave for work.
“I didn’t know…” John said and wondered if he could or should ask.
“Risotto.” He pecked a kiss on John’s cheek and it was good.
“Almost. Vampires use the glamour to pull people close because they want to feed off them. Glamour does also numb you a bit, you won't feel the pain when being bitten. It awakens your sensual side, your sex. It makes everything better. If the dosage is perfect, your human will be fully aware of everything and enjoy it to the most.”
“It made me angry after I have come back from my clean up. I wanted to make love to you but how could I make love to you the way you look now?” He sadly shook his head. Then he shook Sherlock’s head.
“The poor woman. How is she?” She asked.
“But you didn’t leave him behind. Utterly helpless.” John looked at Greg.
