Sherlock kissed him again.
“Good?”
John slid his finger in and out, turning it, pressing against the smoothness inside. He knew by Sherlock’s reaction more so than touch that he’d hit the spot he’d been looking for. Mouth wide, eyes wild, Sherlock grabbed John’s shoulders and bore down, trying to get more of that touch.
“No! But, just, Sherlock, are you, are you seeing anyone?”
“James,” Sherlock continued, “what was the weather like that day? I’ve looked up the temperatures but am wondering if you can remember if it was particularly windy?”
“Mmm,” Sherlock hummed, looking smug and like he knew something John didn’t.
Sherlock looked down at his smock. “Potassium iodate, malonic acid, and hydrogen peroxide.”
I've gone back through chapters 1-8 and added more images, as everyone likes them so much. I don't own any of these images, so I hope it's okay to borrow them from the internet peng gods. The adorable photo of Sherlock face-planting has mysteriously disappeared, and I have no idea where it went. I think my code is fine, and a thorough internet search has come up empty. If anyone can find it, please please please let me know.
John plucked the colored lights from his hand and grabbed two more boxes of the same off the shelf. “Colored lights, definitely.”
John punched at the buttons until the machine spit out their tickets, pushed through the turnstile, then they climbed the stairs to the westbound platform and waited for the train.
John sat up from where he’d been reclined against Sherlock’s side and took one of his hands in both of his. He glanced up at Sherlock, then down at their hands again.
“I'll show you.”
“I think they’re more than friends.”
Sherlpeng. You look very handsome right now.”
“How is that even possible?” Lestra demands. “I
John turned off his bedside light, wrapping them in the dark, but a moment later the room glowed bright again with a text notification.

Same note as last chapter:
“After what you just did, you can inspect my balls for any reason whatsoever whenever you choose.”
720 ILCS 5 Sec. 11 14.1: Solicitation of a sexual act
They sit outside, enjoying the last of the early autumn light, tea mugs and an unwrapped Cadbury Fruit and Nut bar set on the small garden table between them. Sherlock hasn't looked up from the draft since he sat down, and John is flipping through the file folder, rereading the letters, notes, and documents that allowed him to finish the book. They're in no particular order now, having been reshuffled so many times, but it hardly matters; they are all as familiar to him as the back of his hand. He pulls out a small, light blue notecard.
John twirled his glass in a small circle near his ear, and shrugged. “We’ve been together for a long time now, yeah? No reason for that to change. We’re, you know, good. Together.”
IT APPEARS I AM APPROACHING CLIMAX TWELVE MINUTES THIRTY-SIX SECONDS SOONER THAN PREVIOUS ESTIMATIONS ALLOWED
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut and tossed his head to the side. It was there, it was right there, it was so very, very close.
“Thank you, sir.”
Mycroft turns on his feet and reaches behind him. When he turns back, he has the heartstone cupped in his wings. He holds it high above his head for all to see, then lays it at Sherlock and John’s feet.
“It wouldn't have been the first time.”
Erebus smiles at him, and gestures to the egg nestled in John’s pouch. “May I, Sherlock? John?”
“I will. I will hunt the edges of the eddies, and ー”
Before he went back to bed, he inspected himself in the medicine cabinet’s rectangular mirror. There was a bit of stubble coming in on the lower half of his face, and his hair was a nest of tangles and curls. His lips and eyelids were puffy, the first from kissing, the second from sleep. He found a love bite spreading under the thin skin of his neck, just above his collarbone, and when he ran his fingers over it, it felt warm and tender to touch. There was another one above his left nipple.
John came to stand in the vee of Sherlock’s legs. He took the bottle from Sherlock’s hands, twisted out the cork, and grabbed for a flute before the bubbles could spill over. Some of it dribbled down the side of the bottle, and John licked that bit off the glass with his talented tongue. He filled both glasses, handed one to Sherlock and raised his in a toast.
“Okay.”
“I just thought these would help if the skates were uncomfortable.”
Tui mutters through the side of her bill, which is clenched down on the watery sea plant. "Kept us up half the night with your sleep talk about seeing John again – figured at least one of us should get some shut eye."
“This is nuts. This weekend isn’t even over yet, and we’re worried about the number of days between Christmas vacation and spring break.”
on tumblr.
“It seems important, Elder Cetus, given yesterday’s histrionics.”
“It is a new name,” John says.
Sherlock shoves his wing into John's bill in an attempt to muffle his squeaks, but John nips at him, then pushes his head up against Sherlock's neck and cheek.
The waitress stacked up their empty plates on her tray, and scribbled on her pad. “Sure thing. Back in a sec.”
John ran his fingers through his hair, pulled just enough to release the stress that Sherlock unconsciously stores there, each shaft tingling with the slight stretch and release. Sherlock planted one kiss to the bulge near his lips, took a deep breath, and fell asleep.
“You’re right, Sherlock. I don’t know how I’m going to do it this time.”
“Good boy.” John rewarded Sherlock with half of his index finger. “What else?”
Sherlock reached in between them and started undoing his own jeans, the back of his hand bumping against John as he worked the buttons. John licked into his mouth again, and rolled his hips, trapping Sherlock’s hand between them. Sherlock turned it over, and there it was, John’s erection, pressing into his palm, filling it, throbbing against it.
“Sherlock. Has anyone ever kissed you before?”
“My goodness, yes. You have set truly wonderful dynamics in motion, my son. It is history in the making, and I feel very fortunate to watch it unfold. Selvic would be as proud of you as I am, you know.”
“Oi. Am I enough of a not-an-idiot to, eh, you know?”
“Yeah.” Why had Sherlock’s voice squeaked on that one little word?
“Are you in some sort of trouble?” John asked.
“Well, no. I mean, I’d love to touch you, but only if you want to be touched.”
He smiled and grabbed his suitcase from just inside the front door, where he’d left it when they’d come home from the airport.
Sherlock practically threw the lube onto the counter and started pulling loose bills out of his coat pocket. The woman with the pink hair smiled at him and came over to ring him up.
✓ buy condoms, lube
He set it down on the bench, the same one they had sat on just that morning, and put his hands on his hips. Eyebrow quirked, he shook his head and sighed. “Tired, eh?”
“Of course I’m sure.”
Sherlock lowered his head between John’s legs and brushed his hair back and forth on John’s inner thighs and balls, then went back to his frenulum, and gave it a light kiss. A drop of fluid ran down the tip of John’s cock and settled on the sloped edge of the crown. Sherlock ran his tongue through it, not to lick it up, but to smear it down, onto the small patch of skin he’d been working.
Sherlock couldn’t help it, he giggled. “Sorry. Bit cold.”
John starts shaking.
“Mm?”
John's chest was a warm weight over Sherlock's pounding heart. He felt anchored, protected.
“Oh. I doubt it. Chicago has about seven thousand licensed taxis. And I like dick.”
“Because I’m an emergency?”
“What does it feel like for you? When – when we kiss and touch like this?”
“I don't, but it's a great idea.” John took his laptop back from Sherlock and started two-finger tapping at the keyboard.
John got dressed while Sherlock pretended to reorganize his backpack. He totally did not sneak a peek when John dropped that tiny towel, nor did he have to perform an emergency saliva swallowing technique when John bent down and pulled on a pair of tight, blue striped boxer briefs. Sherlock was eighty-three percent composed when John did up his button-fly jeans, pulled a dark blue polo over his almost dry hair, shrugged into his letter jacket, and announced himself ready to go.
council
"Tired?"
"Text Mycroft."
“Guys. Stop. Seriously. Kevin, I’m Greg Lestrade. It’s nice to meet you.”
“I am Sherlock of Pobeda.”
"Are you talking in your sleep?"
“Hello, John. You look quite well yourself.”
Sherlock waggled his eyebrows at John and John smirked. “Sorry, it’s not that kind of surprise, not right now, anyway.”
They scrubbed the dishes after dinner, setting everything to dry overnight, then took a stroll around the grounds. Sherlock tracked the movements of the swallows over the back fields as they walked, and John listened as Sherlock talked rapid-fire about the birds’ migratory habits, flying speeds, and diet.
“Not the same.”
Sherlock pulled back enough to glare. “What woman?”
“Ah, yes. I should have known you would remember that. But what advantage would I gain here, by deceiving your friends into thinking I have some power that I do not? They have all been perfectly lovely, and very accommodating. They stayed and huddled with us all night, in fact, and have been very concerned about Tui.”
Sherlock winces.
Kahu in particular loves asking this last question. He asks over and over again, giggling when Sherlock’s smile goes a bit wobbly, and when John puffs up his chest and explains, “I am Sherlock’s
“Sherlock, just listen to me for a second.”
And they had. They had prevailed, and the proof of it was working diligently toward hatching at this very moment.
“Yeah?”
“Shh,” Sherlock whispered. “Easy. Tell me if this will work.” He lifted John’s hand from where it rested on Sherlock’s hip, brought it to his mouth, and slipped John’s first two fingers inside to the knuckle. Mouth still open, he rolled his tongue over the pads of John’s fingers, flicked at them, licked them.
“Sherlock, we should go find her.”
“I don’t know. Moving on? Letting this house be mine, instead of my parents’ ghosts’ place?”
“Not at all. The journey is arduous,” the other peng says. Her voice is lilting and melodious, and Sherlock wonders if this is a native Rūnanga accent. Her accent may be captivating, but her appearance is otherworldly. She is almost entirely white. Where she should have golden patches she is slightly pinkish in colour, and where she should be black, along the tops of her wings, her face, and her back, she glows like moonlight. Her eyes are silver, her bill, too.
“Sherlock. At one time I thought perhaps you and I – but then – and you came back – but I – and now – now, Sherlock, after all this time, I wonder, would you still have me?”
They have more personal narratives to explore, and they turn to each other, eager to pick up where they last left off. The summer has left signs of maturity on both of them. John's grey fluff has given way to mottled black and white feathers, as has Sherlock's. Neither have achieved their adult height, but Sherlock is two sure wingtips taller than John now. Sherlock has seen his reflection in the water from time to time, and he knows that his body mirrors the changes he sees in John's. The bulk of their shape is shifting, from their hips to their chests. Their wings are elongating, which helps tremendously with balance and locomotion. They have longer, stronger tails, and longer bills, too. Most of their new height is in their torsos, but some of it is found in the stretch of their necks, too.
Anahera nods. “You don’t have to tell me. I won’t pry. But it has something to do with what you’re carrying, doesn’t it? And that’s why you’ve come to the High Council.
“What?”
Penghearts, I do apologize, but my photobucket has a kink, a not very nice one, and it will not let me copy my image addresses. I'll fix it here when they fix it there, but would rather post this now, late on Monday night, without images, then wait much longer. There are some end notes at the bottom, just not of the photographic kind.
Sherlock closed his eyes and focused on the pressure building inside him. He was close, and he knew that when it happened, it was going to be huge. He tightened his grip, smeared precome under his crown, and stroked faster. There was a surge of arousal, a tightening, the sensation of all his awareness rushing down and inward.
“And you made a new one and sent it here.”
Sherlock left James sitting at the table with his newspaper. He wanted to retrieve the folders from under the mattress before John came home or Annette headed upstairs. He wouldn’t keep this from John if the subject arose, but he hoped it wouldn’t. If pressed, he’d admit the truth. He’d say he mistakenly thought the folders were John’s and feeling guilty for snooping he’d shoved them out of sight without thinking it through.
Sherlock sighed. He pulled the iPad toward him and in a flash of genius entered John’s name and email address. He picked up the bag, thanked the saleswoman, and turned on his heel.
It is not until he sees Tui approach that Sherlock understands that the weight of his own sadness might add to her grief. Her shoulders are bowed, and her eyes are dull. She looks only half herself without Anahera by her side. He becomes more aware of himself as he observes her, noticing how hard John has worked to keep him groomed, and warm, and safe. He pulls himself up to his full height, and takes the first steps he has taken in days. His body feels stiff, and heavy, and if he weren’t trying so hard for Tui, he would feel even worse for having let himself drift so far away, from himself, from John, from the colony.
Sherlock shook his head.
John stood toe to toe with Sherlock, and rested his hands on his hips. “In a minute. First, this.” He leaned up and kissed Sherlock’s bottom lip. “Mmm. And this.” He leaned down and kissed under Sherlock’s jaw. “You have the sexiest neck I’ve ever seen in my life.” Sherlock tilted his head back and sighed. “Maybe some of this, too,” John whispered. He pulled the unbuttoned collar of Sherlock’s shirt to the side and kissed along his collarbone.
"Mmm.
“Because you have feelings for me.”
You will not regret watching
“With me, with me.”
Sherlock, John, Mycroft, and Erebus stand on the landing shore, and they wait. They have been there for most of the day, scanning the waters for Siger’s arrival. They’ve told the others they are acting as an ad hoc welcoming committee, and no one disagrees that the colony’s leader deserves to be greeted upon his arrival.
“Like what?”
Thank you, KA!
“Yup.”
“Are you all right, Sherlock?”
“He wouldn’t have given you his pity.” Sherlock brushed a hand over his face. He left it pressed flat over his mouth, his thumb pressing into his cheekbone.
"Sherlock – yeah – oh god –"
A short while after that they were back in a spotlessly clean kitchen. Annette had left a note saying that she’d cleaned half of the ground floor, including the library, sitting room, and dining room, and that she’d be back the next day at 10:00 a.m. to keep going.
Sherlock grabbed John’s hand under the table and gave it a tight squeeze. “Not bad for our second night on vacation.”
“There, at the bottom.”
“No, I want the right side.”
Sherlock is reminded of flocking flight birds, and shoaling fish. As Anahera moves around the huddle, she lightly touches a shoulder here, a wing there, the base of a tail, the curve of a neck. As she does so, those emperors she has touched shift infinitesimally, which causes the ones next to them to shift, too, and then the next, and the next. As he watches, Anahera single-wingedly creates an entirely new huddle, whereby those who need more warmth are turned inward, and those who need to cool down come to the outer rings.
Sherlock giggles, and that makes John giggle. They go inside, the telling of their shared lives held in their hands, and close the door behind them. The sun slowly sets, the garden grows dusky and damp, and the honeybee goes back to its hive.
John stood between Sherlock’s spread thighs and leaned over him. He kissed the skin just above Sherlock’s hip and ran the flats of his hands up Sherlock’s torso from belly to chest. He teased Sherlock’s nipples and ran his fingertips up the sides of his neck and into his hair, tugging gently, then caressed his way back down. John stared down at him, his eyes heavily lidded, his lips parted, then pressed one hand to the bed at Sherlock’s side and stroked the inside of his thigh with the other. His gaze darted between Sherlock’s face and his silk-clad erection as he rubbed his thumb into the tender flesh at the innermost edge of the fabric. Sherlock grabbed onto John’s biceps and panted, open-mouthed.
Sherlock moved closer until his knees bumped into the bed and he couldn’t go any further. John reached up and hooked a finger into the loose knot of the robe’s belt.
“Well, not all of it.”
He slid it downward, stopping with each declaration. “Glans. Corona. Frenulum.”
, and accounting ledgers with handwritten notations, and boxes of check stubs that were dated all the way back to 1980. Why? Why were they hanging on to all of this?
John stares down at Sherlock gasping for breath, absolutely gobsmacked, stunned to have gotten what he asked for and now with no clue on how to move forward. John reaches down and into Sherlock’s pyjamas and gives Sherlock a few quick strokes. He wipes his thumb through the slick waiting there and wipes it over Sherlock’s lower lip, and fuck if Sherlock’s hips don’t buck involuntarily, if his eyes don’t roll back in his head, if his hands don’t clamp down on John’s thighs and clench.
“Well, you don’t have to marry her, John, you just have to go out on a date with her.”
“I see. What shall we bring?”
“I would’ve noticed if it’d been windy enough to shake a car,” James answered. “What he’s saying is there was somebody else in the car, somebody moving about.”
“Bees.” Sherlock rose and went to the bookshelves, running his fingers up and down the spines of his collection, until he found what he was looking for. He retrieved a thin, faded book and returned to his chair. A little puff of dust rose as he opened it, and he absentmindedly swatted, finally, blessedly, distracted.
I. And Then I Almost Died Because Transparent Linen Britches
Imi points at it, squinting her eyes in concentration.
“You already have,
"Yeah, I'm looking, but I can't find a job."
“I’m too young for such an announcement, dear brother, but wouldn't it be nice for Mother if one of us finally gave her that honour?"
John got into bed and scooted close, making no pretense of reading a book or going to sleep. He smiled at Sherlock and reached out to lay a hand on Sherlock’s wrist. Sherlock startled for a second, unused to the lack of questioning before being touched, but he’d given his permission with the choice of his garment, hadn’t he?
John bucked up into the slide of Sherlock’s hand and nodded. “Yes, please, I understand. God, yes.”
“Quite.”
“Do not misunderstand me, Sherlock. This is not a matter of gender, or preference. There are many other factors to consider. Are they healthy? Are they young enough to dedicate many moons to a family? Will they take a chick who needs extra care? We cannot pass off parentless pengs, willy-nilly, to anyone who expresses an interest.”
The next morning the Anahi break away. Nikau wishes Sherlock and Mycroft both safe travels, full bellies, and a short winter. It is one of many emperor salutations, and they return it with sincerity, the three pengs bowing low before parting.
John kissed him then, soft and sweet. He kissed him all over his face, leaving the last one on the sharp rises of his upper lip, and then pulled back and looked him in the eye. “I'm going to get up and go home now, but I'll come back before I leave. Don't get up. You stay right here and close your eyes and think about New York, okay? And when I come back you can tell me all the other great ideas you have for what we should do while we're there. And I promise I'll think about your idea for my dad buying some of your acres and putting the loan money toward tuition.”
THE SEAGULL (with a nervous look): Wait. Are you John the Tuahangata?
“Well, no. I’m sure not so easily.”
“Thank you.”
Sherlock yanked up his briefs, then sat up and tugged his shirt on. He did a couple of the buttons in the middle, rolled the sleeves up to his elbows, and crawled over John as he tried to button his own shirt. Crotch-to-crotch, Sherlock arched his back and lowered himself onto John. “You know what, John?” he whispered. “I’m going to have a great breakfast, and you’re going to be the one keeping that shower in mind.”
"Where are you off to now, young Sherlock?"
Thank you, happierstill, for the beta.
“What's with the hedgehogs?” Sherlock flounced onto the couch, turned his back to John, and yanked his dressing gown up and over his legs, thus cocooning himself and the mystery of the otters away from John for the rest of the afternoon.
Thanks, as always, KA, for straightening out the kinks.
“You know that I got some of the photos from Mrs. Hudson and some from my mom and some from Mycroft, right? I had emailed Mycroft to ask for them. We emailed a few times, actually. Back and forth. You know, he’d say something, and I’d say something—”
. He knows that John doesn’t really give a whit, either. But still. It’s
Sherlock gapes.
"Sher - Sherlock Holmes, sir ... Jean."
John asks questions, so many questions, and although Sherlock tries to answer them in a way that lends to the whole story, he finds himself jumping from topic to topic, nothing in chronological order. Each question leads to another tangent, a thought remembered, something to share. Sherlock's ice palace has a large cavern to one side filled with shimmering icicles that whisper
“That’s not the same as you upsetting me.”
“You’re tired. We don’t have to talk about anything else. Would it bother you, though, if I stayed up a bit more and did some reading?”
“It still upsets you.”
Sherlock kissed the underside of John’s jaw and fell asleep.
John’s lips twitched, but he did as he was told, tugging his shirt up and out of his jeans on his way back to Sherlock.
“C’mon. Let’s go back to the hotel.”
“Or, we could just go back to the hotel room.”
“She?”
John runs his hand down Sherlock's long thigh and squeezes his knee. “We weren't married then, Imi. We were just friends. Not to worry, though, your Papa didn't let me have the girlfriends for very long.”
“Well?”
. John rounds his shoulders and reaches down, cupping Sherlock's bollocks with one hand and fisting his shaft with the other. He gives in to the sensations overtaking him, lets it all gather and grow, knowing he won't last once Sherlock comes, and that Sherlock is going to come, very soon now.
Kevin glanced down at his wrist. “11:48.”
“I trust you, John. I was surprised and hurt that you didn’t tell me, but I understand why. I’m not entirely comfortable meeting Mycroft with so little warning, but I trust you. Is there anything else I need to know?”
When they parted ways James headed back in the direction of Annette’s flat, leaving John and Sherlock standing in front of Victoria’s. John stepped forward and straightened the collar of Sherlock’s jacket, then went up on his toes for a quick kiss.
“Ours is not a peaceful time. Some of us fight internal struggles. Others fight ideas and notions and the world at large. Each and every day, we must battle the sea, and the enemies with which we share it. I will not have us at war with each other.
“God, yeah.”
Pabst is a very regional beer, originally brewed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
“Thirty minutes. If your foam isn't firm, thick, and creamy after thirty minutes, I wash my hands of you.”
“We are alone now, though, aren’t we?” Sherlock murmured. “The case is over and we have nowhere to go, nothing to do, nothing to even think about.”
John looked back and forth between Sherlock and the waiter and nodded. “Yeah, you do, but I think you have a few inches on him.”
Sherlock was pretty sure there wasn’t enough blood left in the upper half of his body to facilitate the workings of his vocal cords. It didn’t help that John was now nibbling on his frenulum. “Y – yes, John, I do believe – I can be of assistance – when it comes to – your daily need for – sucking cock. Oh – my – God – yes.”
“Me neither.”
The barista raised an eyebrow and opened her mouth, no doubt to ask a dozen questions about coffee bean elevation preferences, wand steaming temperatures, and milk-fat content, but John raised one hand, shook his head, and said, “Two giant, milky, coffee things. And two of those blueberry muffins.”
A few stops later the two men stood and made their way to the doors, close to where John and Sherlock were standing. They were only a few feet away now, and Sherlock watched as one slung his backpack over his shoulder and made way for his friend to stand next to him. Sherlock watched as he fidgeted with a strap on his pack, as he shuffled his feet to keep his balance as the train slowed to a stop. His friend, who hadn’t been holding on to anything, jerked forward, then back, and Sherlock watched as the other reached out to steady him with one hand on his bicep, and then as he raised that hand, as if in slow motion, rested it on the back of his friend’s neck, and squeezed. His friend made to step away, a movement that looked completely instinctual, but the man kept his hand where it was, kept looking out the windows as the doors opened, and rubbed his thumb into the hair at the nape of his neck. They stepped off the train, stepped apart, and walked away, but not before the one with the backpack took one last look back at Sherlock.
Sherlock had read the news as it trickled out to the public, first scoffing, then incredulous. No government should serve as a matchmaking agency, not for any purpose whatsoever, and if that’s what was going to happen, he would stay well away. He hadn’t, however, anticipated his mother’s eagerness to participate. She had all but jumped at the chance to marry off her eccentric younger son, registering Sherlock immediately with their local Oxfordshire County agency and filling out all the necessary paperwork for him when he refused to do so.
“There we go,” John breathed.
News spreads like a tidal wave through the colony, and within moments of returning from the skua’s thwarted attack, all eyes are on John, Sherlock, and the chicks tripping and tumbling around their feet. Ariki and Kahu trumpet their arrival with tiny, squeaking honks, and herald their pengsitters as heroes with mispronounced words and wild wing gestures.
Sherlock groaned against his forearm and rolled his hips against John's groin. “Need to know masses and velocity … velocity being how fast you … how fast I …”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Then I needn't waste my time telling you that my recent interest in the property listings is in no way indicative of my intention to vacate this flat anytime soon.”
Sherlock stared at the potato peeler in his hand, at the clock, and at the five pounds of potatoes sitting in the sink. “I’ll do a few now, and the rest later, all right?”
And now here they were, and Sherlock was as bare as he could be, exposed in every way possible, and happier than he’d ever dreamed possible. All those layers, all his defences, dismantled. Layer after layer of sarcasm, dismissiveness, cruelty, layer after layer of white silk, all of it stripped away, and just like those distant stars, at the very heart of him, he was burning bright.
Sherlock listens to John with one ear, but focusses most of his energy on analysing the potential outcomes of Moringa’s surprise visit, and categorizing their most effective responses. He watches the set of her shoulders as she plods along in front of them, the haughty tilt of her head, the arrogant way she holds her tail out behind her. This peng, Sherlock thinks to himself, walks like a bird who has never slipped and felt the hard ice meet her behind. Or, he reconsiders, a bird who wants everyone to believe exactly that about her.
all man
“What kind of trouble?”
“John. There’s only one bedroom in this house.”
“Jesus, that’s really generous. Can we use that for spring break?”
“Mmhmm. You?”
“Right. On my way.”
The river swirled and tossed as it flowed, narrow here close to its point of origin. The loch laid a few kilometres to the southwest and they planned to walk there, lunch in tow. They’d driven through several small towns to get here, towns that boasted nothing more than old Scottish names, like Ballinluig, Balnaguard, Grandtully, and Aberfeldy. They’d parked on the outskirts of a town called Bolfracks, and Sherlock had laughed as John put the Range Rover in neutral and pulled on the handbrake, because the entire place was made of outskirts, nothing more than someone’s farm and a scattering of cattle sitting on the patchwork quilt of verdant-hued lands that made up this part of the country.
She was already out the door when he thought to call after her. “Oh! Andrea? Do you have connections in the school of medicine, too? My boyfriend—he's the one who arranged our visit—is studying in Minnesota, but I'd come here in a heartbeat if John could study here, too.”
“I am Nikau of Anahi.”
“I’m sure you are, honey. I’ll be in the kitchen.”
Sherlock doesn't turn around from where he's slowly unbuttoning his shirt. "Don't be boring, John."
Sherlock opened his eyes. John was fiddling with a cup of coffee and a spoon but pushed it away long enough to get up and fetch a cup for Sherlock. He poured it full and pushed it across the table.
Thank you, noobs, for the cheering and crafting ...
They went through their nighttime routines quickly, brushing teeth and washing hands and faces, chucking dirty clothes into the closet and lining up their boots by the door. Sherlock climbed into bed and took a look around the room. They'd been there for eleven days, and in those days they'd turned it into a home away from home. John always put his watch and phone on the nightstand on the left side of the bed, and Sherlock always put his on top of his photo album on the right side.
Sherlock mentally patted himself on the back for having guessed what Kevin did for a living.
Anahera
“Sherlock? You okay?”
the sleep that had earlier evaded Sherlock came and found them both.
Mycroft moves to the front of the Council and clears his throat. Sherlock would not have bothered to consider it before their journey from Cassiopeia to the Shelf, but it seems Mycroft has softened under the weight of his recent responsibilities. Sherlock reads in Mycroft’s stance and expressions that the privilege of intercolonial committee work has humbled the older peng.
What was taking John so long?
Lestra looks a bit nervous, and a bit disbelieving. “Ah, go on then. She’s not really
Sherlock stepped forward with his arms crossed across his chest and tried to maintain his disgruntled boyfriend pretense. John planted his palms on either side of Sherlock's face, went up on his toes, and kissed him. If Sherlock was expecting a quick peck in front of their audience of one, he'd misjudged. John may have started out soft and sweet, but as his thumbs swept over Sherlock's cheekbones so did the tip of his tongue over Sherlock's lower lip, and as his thighs made contact with Sherlock's, so did that tongue with the inside of Sherlock's mouth. John kissed like a flame slow to take, but once sparked, white-hot through and through.
“The big rush is that the longer we stay in this room the harder it’ll be for me to not give you that birthday kiss you were talking about.”
Sherlock watched him go, and thought this was all a bit like one of those movie scenes where two virgins are about to have sex for the first time, and are trying to make everything perfect in spite of their nerves and hesitations. He climbed onto the bed, rearranged the pillows, and waited for John to come back.
“I understand, Sherlock. One doesn’t travel as far as you have to see the High Council, and then blabber all over the place about the business at hand.”
A short while later they'd picked out two delicious-looking sirloin steaks, ingredients for jacket potatoes, a couple handfuls of green beans, and a ruby-red cabernet sauvignon. Neither had wasted a second thought on whether or not they needed dessert. They didn’t.
“It’s going to be boring after Chicago.” Sherlock knew he was bordering on morose, but he felt powerless to stop it.
“I don’t think so, no. I mean, no, I’m not joking that I think that’s what this is about. It makes sense. How secretive he is about his work, how much he travels, this card, all of it.”
The only thing they didn’t agree on was what Greg should do with his future. Tired of the club security scene, Greg was ready for his next big thing. Armed with a liberal arts degree, Greg figured he could do just about anything outside of the sciences, which was fine with him. He wouldn’t mind going back to school for the right thing, but would need scholarships or loans to pay for it.
Showing the others what he has learned puts him in mind of Erebus and all the hard work they have done testing Sherlock’s theories on hunting and foraging. Erebus has always supported Sherlock, always listened to his ideas, always been willing to change his own habits to embrace something better. And now, Sherlock thinks, Erebus’ days of hunting are over, and even if he tried, Sherlock cannot fill Erebus’ wake.
Sherlock was less comfortable describing the how than the what. The how involved having memorised every detail of John that he’d been able to see in their short encounters, the way he stood and talked and moved, his choice of words and his haircut and his clothing, the way he’d trained his muscles to move, the way he was leaning into Sherlock’s space and licking his lips and … no. There was no way to tell John how he knew what he knew without coming across like a completely obsessed, infatuated nutter.
“There’s an egg on your feet, Sherlpeng. An
“I think we do.”
“Are you tracking assists, or am I?”
John rolled his eyes and slipped his hand closer to said wood. “Go ahead genius, tell me.”
Sherlock blinked. John’s mouth fell open.
“Not really, not anymore. I used to be so afraid, though. Remember when we thought she might come back, when we worried that she would try to take Hannah?”
“Stop it. But yes, always bring your equipment.”
Sherlock is overcome with the urge to bow to the great hunter, so he does, and out of the corner of his eye he sees John do the same.
“I suspect that’s the alcohol, John, and not the architectural brilliance of the building. You had a lot of those smashy things.”
“It did. I hope you don’t mind what I said about your mom.”
“Harriet, get your elbows off the table.”
He didn’t need to say a word. John read his body, the way his thighs and abdomen clenched, and the way his breathing became short and choppy, and he nodded that he knew, and was ready, and Sherlock let out a shout, and exploded into John’s tight mouth. And this, this part right here, may have been his favorite part, because as he came, pulsing over and over again, John just kept on going, kept riding Sherlock with his mouth, breathing hard through his nose, eyes closed, swallowing again and again. He kept going until Sherlock couldn’t take anymore, and somehow he knew when that was, too, and then he slowly, slowly popped off, as if reluctant to do so, and kissed Sherlock’s thighs, as if thanking him for the chance to service him that way.
“I don’t want to leave. Not yet, anyway. And when I do, I want you to come with me.”
Sherlock exchanged another few words with the bartender, and another round arrived.
“You're really not upset?”
He is surprised when he wakes up the next morning, because to wake up means he fell asleep, and he was sure he wouldn't have time to sleep with all the scenario planning still left to do. But he wakes up, and when he does, Anahera is just coming back with a long strand of Himantothallus grandifolius, and Tui rushes over to inspect it, humming and hawing over the best way to utilize it.
This is the 42nd chapter, which means I've been updating for 42 weeks. I know that's a long time in terms of remembering a lot of the mythology in this story, so I thought I'd offer a little summary:
John keened.
Sherlock's thoughts circle back to all the reasons none of the other explanations had made sense: because they were already committed, because everyone already knew, because they would choose each other no matter what, because hatchlings don't matter, because they would never change their minds. Sherlock and John were bonded before they were bonded. And yet, it feels different now.
“Calvin had just taken a test, and he said to the teacher, ‘As you can see, I have memorized this utterly useless piece of information long enough to pass a test question. I now intend to forget it forever. You’ve taught me nothing except how to cynically manipulate the system. Congratulations.’
They stomped the snow off their boots outside the kitchen door, toe’d them off just inside, and left them on the
John nodded and pushed his Coke across the table, toward Sherlock, who’d been eying it. “Yeah. Or, we could go for your birthday.”
“Well, I suppose we should order, shouldn’t we? If you’re not too terribly busy, could you bring us one Blood and Sand, and one Dark and Stormy?” Sherlock sealed it with a wink, and Paul nodded again, bumped his way out from between the tables surrounding them, and disappeared.
“Nuh-uh, gorgeous. We’ll never get out of here if we start fooling around now.”
I’ve been here with you,
“Oh, I get it. You object to the body in which John’s boyfriend happens to be housed, is that it? Well, I don’t exactly cotton to your wife, to be honest with you. Just isn’t my type. Not everyone has the same type, you know? Now, Sherlock here, he’s John’s type, and John is Sherlock’s type, and quite frankly, that’s no one’s business but John and Sherlock’s. Do you see what I’m saying, Hank?”
They made several toasts to marriage and each other, and to their families, including John’s absent sister and deceased parents, and when all was said and done Sherlock was warmed through with drink and affection, and John was still grinning like an absolute idiot.
, of sorts.”
Sherlock fell asleep in his nest of sheets and pillows and John and thought about how far he’d come, and how far he’d go if it meant being home, home with John.
“For what?”
, “is that you’re afraid we’re on a wild peng chase, that the High Council won’t see us, this will never be resolved, and you’ll never see John again.”
ii. If he does not immediately fling you upon the mattress, floor, or against a wall, and begin using both lips, his tongue, and at least four teeth in a full-on assault of your mouth, repeat
“What does he look like?”
“I am confident in your hotness.”
“But, that’s like, thirty-five minutes from now.”
“Come to Harvard.”
“Jesus Christ, yes.”
He peeled his wet shirt off and let it fall to the floor, then his shoes, jeans, and socks. Kicking them into the corner, he turned on the taps in the tub, waited for the water to warm up, and turned the shower on. He did his best thinking in the shower, and he had an outfit to plan. What did one wear to a study date, he wondered as he tugged down his pants and stepped into the shower. He’d seen the way John’s eyes had lingered on his clingy white shirt that morning. And on his hair. And his neck. His mouth. Sherlock scrubbed the bar of soap over the goosebumps rising on his arms and chest despite the hot water flowing over him.
“Mmm, feels good. Do yourself, too.”
“But of course you did. Sherlock, would you mind terribly if I tell Lestra this news myself, or did you already assure him that we would see things your way?”
“It’s okay. You don’t have to take it off.” Sherlock looks at where he touches the stone, covered as it is, and feels a small tremor start at the tip of his wing and work its way toward his shoulder. He closes his eyes. He can see the glow of it in his mind, and the colours it had cast over him, and John, and the colony, at the
“Hey. Work toward kissing me. I don’t want you to miss your plane.”
Thank you, happierstill, for proofreading for me!
He is only two and a half orca lengths away from them when he sees the seal. She comes from behind, closing the distance with unstoppable momentum, her mouth already opening in anticipation of snatching her prey. Sherlock will realize later that he must have radiated sheer horror, because the expressions on both Anahera and Tui’s faces change instantaneously, from joy to confusion to abject terror. Instinct kicks in, and the two emperors immediately separate, bulleting along opposite trajectories, each hoping the other will be spared.
“Feel good?” John murmured. He lowered himself down to one elbow and licked into Sherlock’s mouth, flicking his tongue in time with his hand.
“Maryle, you are so sweet, and it was very kind of you to share these … sentiments with me. I would’ve done for any penguin what I did for you, and I will do it again if required. You just stay safe out there, okay? Stay near my parents, and Harriet, if you’d like, and don’t go out on your own, and I’m sure we’ll run into each other back at Pobeda.”
Kevin and John laughed, Sherlock huffed, and Greg announced that everything was ready.
Maryle is sputtering. John looks completely baffled, but not unhappy with this turn of events.
“She has,” Mycroft said with a tilt of his head. “We couldn’t have compiled this report without thorough interviews with all three of you.”
“Māmā says I talked so much as a hatchling, she tried to put me back in my shell. I talked all day, I talked all night, even in my sleep.”
Sherlock smeared the rest of the lube over his own erection, then wrapped his arms around John’s shoulders again.
There are not enough platitudes in the universe for Calvin and Hobbes. I got my C&H first book from my first boyfriend, and he wrote, "I love you, baby," on the inside, and signed his name. Now my kids have it, plus just about all the other books. I mean, really. Just google some C&H quotes, and tell me that Moftiss and Gatiss aren't basing Sherlock on Calvin.
Awake, and with a fuzzy hangover and hours to kill before meeting Greg and Kevin, John threw on his clothes from the night before, and ran out to Bow Truss to get coffee and muffins. The bag full of breakfast didn't stop him from snagging a couple of chocolate chip cookies from the lobby on his way back to their room.
“I reach down and squeeze your balls –”
“I know you are. I didn’t mean to worry you. It wasn’t really a big deal. I was taking a shortcut to the lab and saw this guy coming out of the back door of the Baker Library.”
John folds his paper and lays it on the table as Imi approaches, then takes the handful of purple stalks from her and dips his face into the bunch, inhaling deeply.
Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock gave John a long, hard look. “Anything you want, John. If you win, you choose. If I win, I choose.”
(noun) companion, friend
John nods, relieved. “Yes. Yes, that’s it, in a nutshell.”
“11:59,” Kevin and Greg said at the same time.
John stops his pretend grooming and pokes at Sherlock with his wing. "Okay. Yeah. Good. You could, you know, if you wanted –"
Sherlock sighed and tugged his scarf closer around his neck, looked up and down the street, and nodded toward the stoplight. “C’mon. Let’s go get a drink and I’ll fill you in.”
Sherlock took a bite. He chewed, swallowed, and took another bite.
Then John slides down Sherlock’s body, he runs his hands down Sherlock’s chest, pushes his shirt up as high as he can, strokes his fingers across Sherlock’s nipples and pecs and down his ribs, into the shallow bowl of Sherlock’s belly, trails his fingertips down into Sherlock’s nest of hair, and he shushes him, tries to settle him, and then when he’s done all he can do, he takes Sherlock in his mouth, and holds him there, willing the daft genius to breathe before he passes out, because passing out after an orgasm is quite acceptable, but passing out before you get there is a bit not good.
“I'm okay. I really am.”
“Oh, that reminds me. John and I are going to drive down there for a few days while we’re home. It’s our Christmas gift to each other.”
“So good. Yours?”
Sherlock stretched, fingers and toes splayed, back arching, thinking about what made this time different. Maybe it was the novelty of what they’d just done, although everything they’d done before was novel to him at one point. Maybe it was his complete, unwavering focus on John as he took a more active role, although he’d certainly been focused on John before. Or, maybe it was just them growing together, so trusting, so safe in their vulnerability, that Sherlock’s brain had given up the fight and let him be for once.
John bowed his back, playing with the position until Sherlock’s cock was driving into John's prostate each time he slid past. “Fucking hell, there, there, there, oh, yes.”
John tilted to one side, stretched his left leg down the length of Sherlock's right, and Sherlock rolled them.
“Is that so?” Sherlock said into the smooth space below John’s ear.
“These?”
“Shh, love, it’ll be okay. We did good work today. Someone must have seen something, something they didn’t even realize was important at the time.”
”I’ve held on to this guilt for half my life. I’d like to say that I’ll wake up tomorrow and see everything differently, but I don’t know if it works like that. I’d like it to, though, if that helps.
Sherlock taps John on the back, and when John looks at him, his face still pinched in a scowl, Sherlock shrugs his head in the direction of the dusk-smeared sunset, and smiles. John’s precious face softens a bit, and his eyes lose some of their murderous glare. He shuffles closer to Sherlock and aligns their wings. It’s the most minimal of contact, but it makes Sherlock feel as if he’s united with the entire universe.
“True.”
“John?”
“Mm?”
Sherlock thinks back to Nikau. Was he an apologist? What would he have done if Sherlock had told him the truth?
Sherlock’s upper lip twitched. “And you know her pretty well?”
“That sounds like something you would say.” John tousled Sherlock’s hair and wrapped his leg around Sherlock’s hip. “Should we call him, then? Let him know about all this?”
Sherlock straightened himself out in his seat, still close to John, but with his hands in his own lap. “I have a premise we can test, John.”
“One … two … three.”
John pursed his lips and looked up at Sherlock with an exaggerated squint. “Mmhm. I see how it’s going to be.”
"Do you still not know?"
He was already breathing hard.
John has called in morning greeting, and when he is searching for Sherlock, and even in anger, but John has never called for Sherlock like this. John’s call covers their island with song. It hovers in the air above them, each note loud and clear before fading away into the cold. John’s call comes to him in colours, pink and orange and purple.
HOW IS THIS EVEN
“Well, so were his deductions, to be honest. I have no idea what my watch says about anything, but everything he said was brilliant.”
Sausage in my hand, sausage in my hand
forever, but Tui stops him, and says that forever isn't only until they stop being pengs. Forever means always, for the rest of time, even if there comes a time that there are no more pengs, no more ice, no more sea. It means there can never be a different interpretation made, by anyone, about who they were to each other.
“And so I did, too.
This time it is Anahera who rages, who flaps her wings in indignation and stands tall, throwing her back and growling out words of Moringa’s deserved comeuppance.
phonetic articulation
Mycroft only nods, and blinks. He is trembling.
“Hey. We don’t need to use this if you don’t want,” he said, gesturing with the condom. “I mean, I’ve certainly never, you know, with anyone, and I don’t think, I mean, I’m pretty sure you haven’t, either.”
He sees it.
“I agree. Do you think it will work?”
"I must admit, I had no idea you had ever considered taking a mate, Mycroft."
"John?"
John shakes his head and smiles. “Penggit.”
Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock watched John watch the display, following the echos of light in his eyes and the awe playing over his features. John glanced over at him and smiled, tucked his hand in Sherlock’s back pocket, and turned back to the fireworks. The show raced toward its climax, dozens of special effects spiralling, bursting, trailing, shooting. Sherlock could feel the
“Shhh, Lestra, let him talk.”
The moment Sherlock learned to climb out of his cot was the moment he realized he had choices. Every night his mother, father, or sometimes, if he was very lucky, his brother, would put him to bed, and every night he would pretend to fall asleep, wait for the house to settle into quietness, and then climb up, over and down, and begin exploring.
John giggled, and lifted his right leg when Sherlock knelt to pull his jeans over his foot, then switched to the left side and did the same.
“Sherlock!”
“You’re right. You’re not horrible.”
His thoughts continued to mimic the intense, singular focus John was paying him. In the blackness behind closed eyelids he saw concentric circles closing in on each other, red-orange dots and spirals that continuously recentred in his head no matter how hard he tried to move beyond them. He gripped the sheets in his fists and stretched the fabric on either side of his head, grunting into the pillow. He imagined the scene from John’s point-of-view, the stretch of his fingers on pale, spread flesh, the moist, pink pucker under his tongue, the tremor and shiver in Sherlock’s skin, but his attention was like a deduction now, honing down, honing in, an unrelenting brainstorm of singular intent.
Sherlock snickers and squeezes John's shoulder. “I definitely remember the kiss. Do you?”
They stood there and smiled at each other, stupidly besotted, until John said, “Maybe I should park the truck and get out, hmm?”
There is the sound of the sea, of course, always that; rising above that gentle sway, though, there comes the sound of baited breath, of anticipation, and watchfulness, and awe. Yes, the eggs are coming, one by one, to their parents, who have been waiting, some of them many winters, for this opportunity to bring another life to this small patch of ice in this most southerly sea, abutting this lowermost continent. New life.
“Strong?”
“I was. I didn't get rid of anything of yours, but I went through just about every other room in the house and purged all the years of accumulated crap.”
It is not until Sherlock speaks with Mycroft privately that he understands the timing of his brother’s decision.
Olivia was attentive as Sherlock got her up to speed but insisted she could take no action until she’d reviewed the NSY and military reports that had already been filed. Acquiring those files, Sherlock knew, was both a stalling tactic to ascertain whether or not Sherlock was off his rocker, and a bureaucratic process that could take days, if not weeks. He was hardly bothered, though. He had gone to the police to appease John and had expected the exact response they’d received. At least they were on record now, should anything go horribly wrong.
“I could have frostbite.”
On the fourth day, he got a text.
"All pengs seek and find food, Pāpā. They are not all called peng-kimi."
By the time Sherlock heard John’s footsteps coming down the hallway his brain was primed to explode. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes when the door opened. He heard John come into the room. He heard him close the door. He felt him sit down on the side of the bed, his hip pressing into Sherlock’s thigh. He didn’t open his eyes.
Sherlock fought the urge to come. It took almost nothing now to feel the first grip of orgasm. John reached up and pinched Sherlock's nipple, and it was as good as a wet, tight stroke of his cock. John’s tongue on Sherlock’s asshole was an entire blowjob in one lick.
Sherlock saw words swirl in front of his eyes.
“I do.”
“Because you’re my friend and you wanted to support me and you like football?”
“I’m glad you liked the tree.”
quickened pulse
John Watson’s perfect little bubble butt was bound tight in powder blue lycra, above which a narrow waist gave way to the sweep of well-defined latissimus dorsi, then those padded shoulders, the tease of blond hair at his nape, the blue and white high school football helmet.
There, not even two orca depths! He dives, bites down on the chip, twirls upright, and resurfaces.
Sherlock slipped the phone back into his pocket, and immediately picked up a book called
Sherlock froze, his tongue stilling inside John’s mouth.
“So gorgeous, and so very sensitive. You should never wear trousers again, ever.”
“To Scotland. I’m taking you home, to the family ranch.”
“Do you believe you would be able to teach this skill to other pengs? Perhaps other pengsitters, and parents?”
Greg ran his hand through his hair, creating a mess of spikes going every which way. “He wanted me to let him work the door some nights.”
“You need to rebrand yourself. You're a silver fox in the entertainment management industry.” Sherlock gave him a half-smile and shrugged his shoulders. “Couldn’t hurt.”
“Maybe I can get a job as a cabana boy if the whole doctor thing doesn’t work out.”
Sherlock shakes his head. “No, not mine. Erebus and Selvic, Mycroft. They are the foundation.”
It would be fine.
“The colony has him. He’s an outstanding healer as well as an excellent defence peng. He has been recognized as such and he uses his talents to the best of his abilities.”
Once there, he opened his walk-in closet and wandered in. The shelves there were already packed with childhood memories of him with each of his family members, including his now deceased grandparents and a few favourite aunts. No, this wouldn’t do, he thought, there wasn’t enough room. He turned and walked out and looked under his bed. Redbeard. No. John was special, but not to be confused or muddled with Redbeard.
“What are you going to wear?”
Sherlock ducked down for a quick kiss, but John held onto him and lingered. John tasted like coffee and pastry and muffin and love, all of it sweet and warm in Sherlock's mouth. John smiled into the kiss and swayed forward, shifting his hips so that Sherlock bore more of John's weight against him. When John pulled back to breathe he bit his lower lip and kept his eyes on Sherlock's mouth.
Cold, ice, snow, water
Sherlock looks. "Penguins, asleep. It's tedious."
Snorting must be John’s last line, because as soon as the indelicate noise escapes Sherlock, John stomps his foot down and shouts, “Sherlock, enough!”
“No, Anahera, like this,” Tui says, nudging Anahera out of the way. “Come here, Sherlock.”
"Sherlock. Let me put a ring on your finger, and I'll let you put one on mine, and then everyone will know, and then, I think, words will be unnecessary."
He handed the envelope over to Sherlock, who swallowed his molested strawberry, and wiped his hands on his napkin before taking it.
“No, but I can if it will hasten our departure.”
“He is here, in the huddle, resting. The mating was quite exhausting for him. Not so much for me; I really didn’t have to do much at all.”
"You're doing quite well. Are you sure you haven't taken lessons before?"
“Bloody unlikely.”
“I’m in you.”
This is a post-S4 fixit that I posted on Tumblr shortly after TFP.
“Oh. Well, I—”
Then, finally, he sees John, and they are in each other’s wings. John rocks on his feet, both tugging Sherlock against him, and pressing himself flush against Sherlock. They kiss each other’s bills and faces and necks, and then John rests his forehead on Sherlock’s shoulder and whispers, “You came. You came.”
John fell into a silent scream, his hands gripping Sherlock’s hard enough to hurt. Sherlock felt the hot release flood into him, imagined John
"Very good. Do you see how?"
John got up and hustled through the bushes in the direction of his clarinet. Behind him he could hear Sherlock huffing and puffing. Truly, it hadn’t been that bad, had it? Sherlock was a musical snob, but he couldn’t have been that offended by John’s attempts, could he?
Sherlock shrugs off the praise and answers, “It was important. It was an extremely important day.”
“Yes. I saw the label.”
“Mm. Sounds good. But food might be good, too. And I need to finish some Christmas shopping, and check in with dad.”
Sherlock rolls his head back and rests it on John's shoulder, and grinds tiny little circles into John's crotch. Sherlock wants to be a gift to be unravelled, pried open, taken apart and consumed. He's as breathless as John now, wound tight with need and want, lost in the bliss of letting this other man take control and lead them wherever he wants them to go. He lets out a guttural moan, completely at odds with the delicate lace and ribbons, and John hums back, empathetic.
He knew that in this position he was angled up, toward John's spine, so he began to fold himself low and long over John's back. When he had both hands on either side of John's elbows, John began to thrust back. Sherlock pressed himself tight to John and wrapped one arm under his chest. He toyed with John's nipples and kissed the back of his neck.
“You'll see.”
Sherlock looked back down at his doodles, swirly J and S letters intertwined on what appeared to be a cloud. Good God, what had he done? He quickly flipped the page over and began sketching the long, rambling molecular formula of arginine as John approached.
Still, no one moved.
John tucks it into a curl under the tiara, behind her ear and says, “We should go out front now, love, I think your ride is waiting.”
“Mmkay?”
John and Maryle step a small distance away, but Sherlock cannot be bothered to afford them any privacy. He stands, facing them, and stares. Maryle clears her throat a few times and gives John pointed looks while nodding her head in Sherlock’s direction, but John either doesn’t pick up on it, or doesn’t feel inclined to move any farther away.
“The bigger problem is her attitude toward the parameters of sexuality in general.”

"Father says we are descendants of Kororā, hatched Aumārire many millennia ago. But Mother says there's no way to know that for certain, and even if it were true, everyone on the continent must be descended of Kororā by now. She also said it doesn't matter, because the point is to strive to be selfless and kind, like Pono.
"Why? What's wrong, Sherlock?"
He cried so much that he ended up crying himself to sleep.
It was Sherlock. "We need to talk," He said gently.
"Are you alright, John?"
Soon he had his wounds bandaged.
Sherlock waited for him, still sitting quietly on the edge of the bed.
"If you say so."
"I... need to sit down..."
"Not much... I hate to bring it up, but isn't Sherlock's brother part of the British Intel? We have a suspicious lack of information on this guy..."
John gently hugged him.
"Yes, Sherlock?"
John growled a bit.
He didn't force Sherlock to do anything.
Lestrade was standing nearby, watching him in empathetic pity.
He tried anyway.
"Is what so?" he asked.
"But..."
"In fact, thanks to those men Sherlock is out of the picture. So in a way you didn't fully beat him on your own."
"I've got some good news... Maybe." Lestrade muttered.
"Why are you doing this?"
Sherlock sighed. "I just don't want to see you get hurt because of me again."
"But I'm not that great."
John continued to try to save Sherlock.
The detective snuggled closer to him.
"Mr. Holmes, are you alright?" she asked.
He sighed sadly as he sat up in his bed and didn't have the energy to anything else.
"You are sick."
"I was supposed to be taken to the hospital for authenticity's sake, but let's just say that Magnussen met us halfway. I've been staying with him for the past couple of months."
Lestrade looked at John, almost as if waiting for the OK.
"I don't need saving! I am so sick of being the one on the sidelines! I'm taking control now and get out of my God damn way!" he yelled as he shoved Sherlock out of the way.
Into the room waltzed Mycroft, who looked a little bit battered, followed by Lestrade, but Sherlock paid no mind.
"Are you alright, Sherlock?"
"You don't think I'm...
Being trapped against the wall by John, Sherlock quietly stayed still, staring at him.
Were they missing something?
"He refused to submit to me. He now bores me."
Unless he could get in contact with Magnussen.
He smiled as Sherlock fell asleep.
The taller man looked rather distressed, and he subconsciously pulled at his dark, curly hair, continuing to moan and groan.
idiot... and I love you for it."
Sherlock rolled his eyes at himself. "Oh, to hell with it." He muttered before he kissed John again, harder and more passionately this time.
John and Sherlock stood and thanked her for helping out, then sat again as she bumped and jostled her way through the crowd and disappeared.
Anahera turns to the huddle, and listens. “Do you hear that?”
“Like what?” Sherlock voice cracks. Phone sex seems to come easily to John. He’s confident, he knows what he likes and what he wants, and he has no problem telling Sherlock. Sherlock knows what he likes and what he wants, too, but it’s harder to put words to it. The phone helps, a little bit.
“I see.”
“Victoria, I’m delighted to introduce you to my husband, Sherlock Holmes Watson. We’re actually on our honeymoon. We arrived just a few days ago.”
John hums and stands up tall to look Sherlock in the eye. "And that's what has you so flustered? You look like you just raced the length of the island and back." John presses himself up against Sherlock's chest. "And your heart is racing. And you feel warm. Are you getting sick?" John runs his wing over Sherlock's forehead. "Open your bill."
“John, you have two families now. You are welcome to swim, eat, and huddle with us at any time. We must stick together, those of us who love Sherlock as much as we do, don’t you think?”
Sherlock didn’t notice the silence until it ended. “Babe?” he heard Hank say from behind them. “That some kind of joke?”
“Is that it? You’ve driven all the way out here in your pyjamas, on a Saturday morning, to tell me that you are in love with me, that you want to move here, and live with me? Be with me?”
Sherlock walks over, head held high. He's going to see John today, so they can tease all they want. Nothing can ruin this day for him.
“You’re a sad little wanker, aren’t you Holmes?”
The Thanksgiving dinner in this chapter is the Thanksgiving dinner I served today, minus the sweet potatoes, which I have had before, but don't usually make. Pumpkin pie is absolutely my favorite thing about Thanksgiving dinner.
“Yes, that’s what I’ve been told. And to the left is the ‘new house,’ or so we call it, even though it’s close to two-hundred-fifty years old. That’s the drawing room through there, and if we keep going down this hallway, past the staircase, we’ll find the dining room, sitting room, a games room, and the kitchen, which was brought upstairs from the lower level at some point by my grandparents. Upstairs there’s a whole mess of bedrooms, although most of them have been closed off for decades. Hopefully, we’ll find the master is still habitable. So far it all looks like it did when I was here on leave about a year ago.”
Sherlock brushed the crumbs off his fingers, rinsed the milk carton out, and tossed the knife into the sink. He was about to turn around when he felt John press up against him and wrap his arms around his waist. He felt John's breath at the top of his spine.
“I'm okay with being short, you know.”
“He means
“It’s my birthday, and he won’t kiss me.”
The rest of lunch was uneventful, and Sherlock was both grateful, and impressed, by Mrs. Watson’s restraint. She was clearly trying, even if she hadn’t participated in the conversation about them going to Chicago. He had seen Mr. Watson catch her eye a few times, and appreciated his efforts to help his wife manage the situation. If she could ignore that with which she took issue, they’d all be better off.
“Shh. We’ll Skype. We’ll talk. We’ll have epic phone sex.”
“You could not have known. We rarely talk about it anymore. Most, in fact, doubt it ever existed in the first place. Those who believed, gave up searching, and the legend dwindled, and diminished, and is all but mythology, now.”
“Yes. Hopefully, I’ll have it tomorrow.”
“It’s okay, it’s all right, young sir. I wasn’t implying that you should have done. You can, though. You can speak directly to him. In fact, it’s best that you do. Maybe not now, when you still have these winters of youth ahead of you. But, in time, when decisions must be made, do not be afraid to speak your mind.”
Sherlock's transport was on the edge of complete mutiny.
“Fuck, Sherlock, God, you have the best ideas, the best fucking ideas, but that’s not going to, oh fuck, that’s not going to be enough.”
“God, no. Here, try this cheesy-jammy stuff, it’s delicious.”
"Lemme check."

“Anahera and Tui are Rūnangan, and are, well, I will tell you everything later, but they came home with me when they realized that Mycroft was to stay behind. They finished the journey with me. It is over.”
“Like what?”
“No, love. It was always there. And what I can give you right now is my promise to take care of it for the rest of my life, if you’ll let me.”

, Johnling. We can kiss, and touch, like we used to when we were young, in the ice cave. Remember?” Sherlock tilts his head down at an angle most flattering to his long neck, and blinks up at John.
“You’re so beautiful.”
So, here they were, on the precipice of what? Were they going to drink Champagne to their future together? Or maybe they were going to drink Champagne and wish each other well as they went their separate ways? Or maybe they were going to drink Champagne because John liked Champagne?
Sherlock trills their war cry softly under his breath, and half a dozen powdery white bombs go hurling over the ramparts toward one very unsuspecting Mycroft.
“I asked your parents if I may seek your hand in marriage.”
“No, Father, you are not wrong. I know there are some who are absolutely sure this is the heartstone. I suspect there are some who are not exactly happy to see it, too. But we cannot know, and to set any expectations around its validity sets us back down a trail of imposing one belief over another.”
Sherlock's shirt fell to the floor in a heap, followed by his T-shirt.
“Shut it, you.” Greg slid out of the booth with the box of donuts and his coat. “Mind if I take these home to Kevin?”
John squeezed Sherlock’s hand and shook his head. “Let’s play it by ear. When we leave here we’ll move into Baker Street, you’ll establish yourself as the foremost consulting detective of our time and take on more cases, I’ll set up my practise, and we’ll see how things go. How’s that sound?”
“I can't tell you what will or will not happen in the future, love, but the two of you have something special. You always have. Protect it and cherish it. Don't ever take it for granted, and don't take each other for granted. Be good to each other and never stop talking to each other. You're in a wonderful place right now, Sherlock, but you will have rough times. You will fight, you will get mad at each other. That doesn't mean it's over.
This maniac had made it seem like there was a time limit.
"I'm here." She said rather calmly. "Turns out I didn't need any backup, but an ambulance might be nice."
"Ah... That kind of makes sense, I suppose."
"We can't," Sherlock said as Moriarty, at the same time, said, "You can't."
Sherlock turned. "I think it's over for me, John."
"You're not fine." Sherlock said before he started calling out for a nurse.
He couldn't do so; the thought of Sherlock getting shot was haunting him even though he knew it was only a dream.
"The nurse there is a fake!" then explained how he could tell.
"Do you... really think I should get help?"
"Sherlock, it's me, John Watson! Snap out of it!"
When they got downstairs, they were surprised to see Moriarty and four of his men still there.
"Fine..."
Things were finally looking up.
"No, Sherlock."
John decided to try after he got some rest.
"Well, well. Look who's grown a pair." Moriarty mocked.
"But he could
"I still need to find a way to attract our culprit's attention."
"Are you alright?"
He couldn't wait any longer as he got into his wheelchair and went out.
"Yes it is! I made you go to her!"
"You're out of your mind this time, Sherlock!"
"Don't you?"
"You're dead!"
"Now, now, Sherlock. We're here to ask for his help."
"Yes, I know that now."
John didn't try to get him to stop.
Another pause.
"Well, I suppose it should really be who are the targets." Moriarty shrugged mockingly.
"He... He said your name, you know. As they carted him off into the emergency room..."
Sherlock laid down.
He immediately moved his hands away from his ears. "No reason." He said quickly, increasingly aware that if he kept on showing signs of instability, John may resume insisting he get help.
"He killed the man. Disarmed him, took his gun, and just shot him. No hesitation."
"To..." Sherlock put his hands on his head. "T-to... urgh..."
"I love you too, Mary." He smiled back at her.
With that, Sherlock smirked and left.
Their reception was wonderful. Lestrade was there, and so was Mrs. Hudson, who had long since recovered herself. However, the one person he didn't expect to see, but did out of the corner of his eye, hovering near the exit, was Magnussen.
Sherlock?
"Here it comes..."
"I wanted to make sure he's still alive."
Sherlock hailed a taxi on the street, and after they both got in he told the driver where to go. As the taxi started to move, Sherlock sat quietly beside John, not saying anything.
It just couldn't be Sherlock. It just couldn't be.
"Good."
He psyched himself up. "Alright, I'm as ready as I probably can be."
No one was stopping him from going back in there.
' as though Sherlock had been using a different term to define John to his older brother alone.
"... Er, WAS. - JMx"
Sherlock exhaled. "Well. Whatever the case, that's over with." He picked up his violin and resumed playing, as if nothing had happened.
"It doesn't matter right now. I don't have time to bother with medical treatment either way. Let's-" His left leg gave out, and he nearly slipped.
Moriarty stuck his tongue out at John childishly.
"Yes, Sherlock?" he asked, not realizing that.
"But how?"
Sherlock seemed to pull John even closer with that remark as Moriarty laughed.
"I'm sure."
"I really can't. A psychologist wouldn't understand my mind. I can't blame them for it; they're not trained to treat anyone like me. I'd be deemed mentally unwell even without all of this other stuff."
"I need to meet him."
"Mmn..." Sherlock, awakening somewhat, tried to open his eyes.
"I'm simply trying to voice concern. I believe I've heard you say the victim's name once or twice, and from the way you spoke of the victim, I believe you may feel sentiment for them in some way." Firstly, Sherlock was showing vague emotion. Secondly, he was suggesting that despite seeming to ignore everything John ever said, that he did in fact listen. It really was turning out to be a strange day.
"You like my voice?"
"How is he?" he quickly asked.
A tear ran down Sherlock's gaunt face. He leaned down to John and gently kissed him, making Moriarty roll his eyes impatiently.
"It's..." Sherlock then seemed to remember that they were being listened to, and he shut up. Moriarty smiled, realizing that Sherlock had figured out his other targets.
"Whoopie."
Sherlock gulped a bit. He had to admit the good doctor had a point. He took the knife out of his pocket and looked around for someplace to put it.
"John..."
"I trust him!"
"What a cute question! Are you looking to rescue your damsel detective?"
Unless he could somehow pay him off.
Sherlock seemed to try to deduce something to help them, but it did him no good. Still, he kept trying. "There has to be a loophole somewhere. Something he can't possibly have checked..."
The Detective Inspector sighed and crossed his arms. "I wish he'd make up his mind already."
kissed you..."
" Sherlock snapped out of the blue.
It would be weird: moving on.
"Unless making a scene in the middle of the subway counts as a plan, no."
"Stop telling me what to do."
"Yes, I do."
The doctor turned over in his sleep.
"That kiss felt so
Sherlock stared at him as he slept.
"But how do you know he will?"
"What are you talking about?"
He still couldn't believe Sherlock would stab him like he did.
Sherlock struggled to sit up. "God, I've never wished to have some cocaine so much..." He mumbled.
"Whatever you say, John..."
John growled and punched Moriarty in the face.
"I remember he always admired my pocket-watch."
"I love you so much."
"There's not much I can do about that," Lestrade vacantly replied.
"You stay out now."
"This is my fault. I shouldn't have tried to have you leave with me."
Before Magnussen could answer, Lestrade entered the room.
"Let's get ready."
Right then, the door opened.
"There
"Who was it?"
"Where on Earth will you find another like it? Oh, bother, that's not my concern. Now if you'll excuse me, dear brother, John and I need to continue our severely hindered investigation. Good day." He turned and began heading for the door, his hands shoved into the pockets of his flowing black coat.
"We need to find a way to keep you safe from me."
He wondered why he kept going in there.
"You never listen to me, Sherlock. I've always been the voice of reason and yet you never listen!"
What if something had gone wrong?
Sherlock squirmed a bit, but evaded the question. "Why did you need to talk to me."
"Want to go get something to eat since it's morning?"
John slowly calmed down. "I'm alright now."
He would have to hail a cab in order to get there.
She pushed his wheelchair back to his room.
Sherlock took the cellphone and put it to his ear. "Who is this?"
"The latter until I get this number."
He walked fast after it. "Please tell me who that man with you is!"
"Say, just a second ago, Anderson found some blood on the wall by there. Looks like it might've been a cipher, but it's all smeared. Could you make it out?"
He continued to bleed terribly.
"It baffles me."
"Don't push yourself too hard. You alright?" asked Lestrade.
"I knew it!"
"I'm not myself..."
"I love you too, Sherlock. Be careful."
Sherlock didn't look at him, and resumed mumbling. From closer, he could hear what Sherlock was mumbling, but it didn't seem to make much sense...
"John, you can't give up now. We can't rest yet; he's still coming after us! That's why we need to go!" However, the Consulting Detective left their pursuer unnamed.
Then he found a wound he had missed.
The detective inspector huffed. "We can't go with him why?"
"You said you cared about me," Sherlock started.
"Sherlock, what is it that you're not telling me?"
"If you insist..." Lestrade opened the door for him.
John's eyes widened in horror as he saw his friend collapse.
Lestrade hesitantly did as he was told.
"Believe it or not, I was hoping it wouldn't come to this. It's not surprising, though."
Just as he thought that, Sherlock's phone, which he still had on him, received a text.
He just shrugged.
He silently listened to the person on the other end of the phone, and soon slowly stood up, appearing a bit horrified by whatever he was hearing. "How do you know this? What do you want from me?"
John sighed. "I can just cancel if you don't want to go through with it."
"Moriarty would have free reign if you died!"
"Sure he had to buy Magnussen's cooperation, too!"
The good doctor smiled and helped him lay down.
"You sure?"
"Aren't I~?" Moriarty turned and began walking out. The two men restraining John slowly backed away after him, cautiously aiming their guns at him in case he tried anything funny as they were leaving.
He tried again to sleep.
"This is one case that will kill you!"
currently recovering from a gunshot wound...
"I'm fine..."
"No, he won't."
like me. He's what I would have become had I not decided to become a detective."
An hour and a half passed, though it felt more like an eternity, before John's phone started to ring.
"Adapting?"
"Well, for one, it's better than having them die. Secondly, I never said I was going to give Magnussen good advice."
"Then who is it, you bastard?"
"I can't think..." Bad sign when coming from Sherlock Holmes. It was possible that he was starting to go into shock from the wound.
"Why is that?"
The nurse entered and quickly said, "Mr. Holmes... Mr. Holmes is awake again!"
"Nor do I."
, my head..."
"But..."
"Sherlock, just calm down and rest."
"John wouldn't leave you before you stabbed him. That might be different now, though... I'd probably leave after this if I were him."
"There's just one small catch, though..." Moriarty added.
"... The couch isn't too comfortable, is it?"
"Well?"
He couldn't believe what he almost did.
John groaned a bit as he turned over.
"Look at the stars..."
"Get Donovan out of my room."
"I'm only doing this for you, John..." He mumbled.
Mycroft cleared his throat. "The problem is blackmail. Magnussen has stated he will use his knowledge against the British Embacy if we try to take him into custody or take Sherlock away from him."
"I don't think he does."
About fifteen minutes later, after a battle with the machine at the shop as per norm, John returned to 221B Baker St. to find Sherlock fully dressed, sitting on his chair, and Lestrade leaning against the desk in the middle of the room impatiently.
"You alright?"
"Moriarty."
"It's risky but could work. What sort of deal?"
"Are you in here?" Watson called out as well.
"I'm glad." He lied. "I said I'm glad."
"I wish we never took this case."
Sherlock looked through some of the drawers in the apartment's kitchen.
John didn't flinch. He sat there and glared at the two evil men.
John continued to sleep.
" were practically dug into the wall opposite of the bedroom door, with a smiley face drawn into the "
"Who do you think?"
"I wouldn't be so sure about that," mumbled Sherlock.
"Thank you, Sherlock." he weakly smiled.
He gently and carefully helped him up.
"Sherlock, it's John. Are you alright?" he asked him with concern.
For now he would have to wait and see.
"Can you believe the nerve of this guy?" Sherlock asks, referring to the state of the flat. He looks at the floor, at marks and creases on the carpet, and then immediately marches toward the broken window.
"Jo...hn... Jo...hn..."
John was starting to get worried.
Sherlock rubbed his own temple.
Watson hung up and carefully laid back.
Sherlock shook his head, suddenly looking a bit scared.
The figure just smirked and twitched their trigger finger.
Soon enough, one of the blows caused Moriarty to stumble out into the stairway outside of their door.
"What hurts more, Dr. Watson? Losing Sherlock to me, or losing Sherlock to me and then having me send him back to C.A.M.?" was what it said.
"John wouldn't leave me... It'd be wrong for me to--"
"B-but I..."
"It's fine..." Sherlock ran his fingers across John's cheek and flinched when he realized he was smearing fresh blood across the doctor's face.
"The East Wind?"
For some reason Sherlock couldn't explain, he only found it fitting to blame this on the psychologist he held. Any guilt in his eyes vanished and was replaced with what could only be described as fury and hatred as he turned his pale blue eyes onto the woman.
Shivers went down his spine as he heard those same words again.
"Sherlock wouldn't say a thing about what happened. He just kept mumbling things..."
"Oh, I doubt that very much, Doc."
He nodded and went with him.
"That's a shame."
He almost felt like he could hug the Consulting Detective.
He couldn't think of what to do about that.
He just had to find a way to make Sherlock less interesting to Magnussen.
Sherlock broke the kiss and stroked John's hair. "Get some rest, John... I won't let anything bad happen to you ever again, I promise..."
"Magnussen preys on people's weaknesses, or as he calls them, their Pressure Points. Sherlock has plenty... in fact, he has far too many. However, he will prey first on the two most prominent. ... When we get him back, don't be surprised if Sherlock doesn't want to be around you for a while. I'm almost completely certain his attachment to you is his biggest weakness."
Looking at John from the corner of his eyes, he responded, "What are you talking about?"
"I'm just happy you're alive, Sherlock."
"So be nice."
"You were alright until you were beaten across the head."
He closed his eyes.
"John," Sherlock spoke soothingly as he held John by the shoulders. "Don't say that, it's not over for you. Your chapter with me is over, but your story hasn't ended just yet."
"Don't leave me, John..."
He balled his hands into fists, furrowed his brow, grit his teeth, and shut his eyes tightly; he was beginning to purge things from his mind just to make room for normal thinking. The way his brain worked was causing everything he had stored in his Mind Palace to come forward to be "re-sorted", but with nowhere to put any of it, he had no way of repressing any of it; purging all of it was a desperate measure he wouldn't normally take, but he felt he'd go mad if the thoughts didn't stop.
Magnussen only smirked and turned his back to John. He stepped closer to his limousine without a word.
Maybe his connections could help.
"Alright, I'll run it through. Shouldn't take more than a couple minutes."
"I..." Sherlock gave it a moment's thought, studying every crease and wrinkle of John's hand with his fingers. "... I accept... Help me keep him safe..."
He prayed for Sherlock's safety.
"Because I'm not going to make your death as painless as his. You're going to suffer, just like I have."
"Alright."
He almost half-expected for Sherlock to roll out from under the bed, but no such thing occurred.
John grabbed his coat and left to get more milk.
"What would you like to get?"
"I'm here for you, Sherlock."
"We've found someone you may be interested in speaking to."
