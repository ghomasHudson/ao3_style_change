And he hadn't been on a date for so long that it was hard to believe that he was once called Three Continents Watson. And while there was a lot of exaggeration in his reputation, something was still true. He knew how to charm, it was only a matter of desire. Now John was at a loss as to whether he really wanted it or whether it was what he needed. He really didn’t know and couldn’t guess if he had to risk it and invite this witch on at least one date or not.
From the outside, they could be mistaken for acquaintances deciding to take a walk, it meant that neither they nor their behavior aroused any suspicion.
“For several months already. I'm still getting used to working with him, so I really hope for your help and support, Molly. You, yourself knows what it can be like.”
And, it seemed, he already knew why he dropped in here this morning, in between the pages of an old textbook on Basic Theory of Dreams lay an unremarkable leaflet - against a black background, plain text advertised courses for aspiring Dreamers or those who simply wanted to learn how to read dreams. No contact information, except for the address was provided, while somewhat embarrassing, it still didn’t seem suspicious to him. Many Temples, unlike schools or private institutions, did this; he only had to check the address and make sure that the courses were indeed held at the Temple. And maybe they were even free, if not mentioned otherwise.
“What?... Sherlock, what do you mean?” John hissed, grabbing the dark mage by the sleeve and nervously looking around. He didn’t want any problems before the disciplinary commission - for Holmes, it would be normal to do something out of the ordinary and consider it acceptable.
I'm glad that I finally finished posting it)) Soon there will be also sidestory with Sherlock's POV and a bit of  information about the plot for the 3 part called "Shadow from Ashes" (I'm activly writing it now).
How it was possible to look so defenseless and strong at the same time, Sherlock sincerely did not understand, but he wanted to know. And John was the perfect teacher to show by example.
He was drawn to touch the invisible streaks of the runes, and he didn’t resist this desire. The skull fell silent for a moment, obviously interested in his strange behavior.
To activate the pentagram, Anteya had only to touch the black, even line of a small circle, and magic of a level that could only be afforded by Mycroft with his special permission and admission, and through him the witch working for him, continued to work around.
A familiar yellow mark stared at John from a painting. It disfigured the canvas with its ugly smudging, but it did not interfere with the depicted artifact in the original painting.  With talented performance, someone had drawn with beautiful, clear neat strokes, an oblong tube of unknown purpose. This artifact was completely unfamiliar to him, and John decided he would definitely find out about it as soon as the opportunity arrived and free time presented itself.
Whirling in front of the mirror, nervously smoothing his perfectly styled hair, John glanced again at his attire - dark jeans, a blue shirt that favorably set off his eyes, and a brown suit jacket were his final, though not first, choice. He didn’t want to overdo it, yet he had to go through with the not-a-real-date. Artifactist Su Lin Yao had insistently demanded his presence at the event that would take place at the Lantern Festival, citing the fact that it would be there that the mysterious Spider would appear. As their main and only suspect, he wasn’t only a key figure in their investigation, his capture could also reveal a scheme of smuggling and the clandestine trade in artifacts in England.
Shrugging off the dark haze around him, John sat down in front of another heaping pile of books. After running his finger along the spines, he was once again convinced that the books collected here before him had no connection to each other. Perhaps a system was here, but it was imperceivable to him, nor did he feel any strong amulets or artifacts. In addition, the inept and carelessly finished spells added to the sloppy ligation of protective runes and more than clearly, spoke of the potential of the victim as a rather mediocre and weak mage. This meant that he could never have independently begun and finished the ritual left in the bedroom.
John held out his hands, implying that he should put his own on top, and Patrick confidently and without delay did so. This flattered and put a burden of responsibility on his, John's, shoulders. He tried to remember exactly what he felt when he shared his power with Holmes, more precisely, when Holmes took his own strength from him, so as not to scare and stun the boy who so bravely agreed to take part in an unfamiliar ritual.
)))) Again a lot of thank goes to her for doing great job with editing my translation, and let me tell you what a task it is in itself!
“As the official representative of the Ministry, I give permission to the Mage Sherlock Holmes to perform the Ritual of Calling Souls. I will share all responsibility with him.”
“I think he went out to the morgue. Or wherever. The case we’re busy with now interested him. You know how he can be.”
Sherlock’s presence disturbed the complex spells, making the magic within them pulsate and gleam. Regularly, John had witnessed such reactions, but every time he couldn't not help but be amazed. Before meeting Holmes, he had never known a mage or witch capable of such a thing. Once again convinced of the genius of his partner, he helplessly caught himself thinking how much more he still had to discover and study, and next to Sherlock, he had the freedom and chance not only to learn, but to provide all possible assistance as well.
“Yes, yes, a long-awaited promotion. You even decided to mark it, changing the previous secretary to a new one,” the latter bit didn't even sound like a question, but Mr. Wilkes didn't even notice.
“You look but you don't see!” Sherlock angrily looked at the long faces after his statement, until he settled on John with mute desperation in his eyes.
“Thanks. Somewhere in the Library there is even my monograph on this topic, but for obvious reasons, my method has not been widely used.”
“No... I see the past, but I cannot change it. The future only occasionally lifts the veil of secrecy, only the present passes through me, and I can sculpt it at my discretion.”
“Why so long?” Sherlock’s discontent came through not only in a cool tone, but in every gesture. He was quite taken aback by such a greeting.
John stepped aside so as not to get in the way, and stood so as to have the best viewing angle. After all, he was to see the Ministry Necromancer at work with his own eyes.
Molly drew runes in the air, and they either hovered over the body with a faint bluish glow, or silently scattered, as if hitting an invisible barrier, while Holmes silently watched her actions without criticizing or interfering.
“What did he do this time?” John wearily rubbed his eyes and sank into his favorite chair, preparing to listen to the skull’s displeasure. Though he already had a good guess what it was about. He strongly suspected communication with Sebastian Wilkes could hardly cheer anyone up. Given his already strained relationship with Holmes, it wasn’t surprising that Sherlock was out of sorts. John considered himself lucky enough to slip out the door at the very beginning of this unpleasant telephone conversation between the two, which he now ranked as a personal achievement. His day, unlike Holmes’, was very productive, even if it was filled with the usual household chores.
At the entrance to the spacious hall, illuminated by many magical lights, they were greeted by the skillful illusion of a small eastern dragon with a long mustache on a narrow muzzle. The dragon welcomed them by hammering its flat tail against a massive gong, silently striking sparks of different colors. The rest of the visitors clearly liked it, judging by the enthusiastic oohs and exclamations, and, if not for the unpleasant associations after communicating with a living representative of the dragon family, John might also enjoy such a greeting.
While he spoke, John managed to go to the kitchen and make some tea. He was a little amused at the thought of Mycroft as a potential suspect. Though if he thought so, it wasn’t worth having some fun, being of more worth to be scared. But again, in this he trusted Sherlock’s opinion more than his own, so he didn’t worry in vain. He was much more worried about this mysterious Moriarty, whose potential Sherlock equated with the potential of his brother, whom he, though refusing to openly admit, respected and highly valued.
Nodding in agreement, though he stopped himself immediately, as much as he was outraged by Sherlock’s behavior, who hadn’t bothered to warn him about anything, he was still his partner, and now he could safely admit it, a friend. In addition, John was well aware of the strained relationship between the brothers.
Distracted by hot breath, John did not immediately comprehend what the dark mage had just told him. As soon as he started thinking about the people who could be the parents of such children as Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes, the most unexpected images immediately began to pop up in his head.
Now, a short, almost chaste kiss, which he received as a reward after revealing the secret of an ancient artifact, which turned out to be a hairpin, Sherlock accepted with hidden joy and relief. Words of praise and admiration caressed the ear, once again reminding him of what he had been deprived of all this time until John appeared in his life.
“Thank you, I like everything,” he was still waiting for the social courtesy accepted at such meetings, and Holmes senior did not disappoint.
“Sebastian somehow helped me get...a commodity,” Holmes decided to explain. John himself, had already guessed what kind of communication would connect these two people.
He stopped right in front of him, blocking out more than just the entire room. His tall figure, pale face framed by dark hair, now illuminated by the daylight penetrating through the window, as usual, pushed out of his field of vision, the piles of books, the table littered with papers, newspapers, and books, the walls decorated with runes, artifacts, and pentagrams, the fireplace, and the sagging sofa. There was no longer a luminous stream of magic or dark suspension - everything faded into the background, grew dim, and blurred. John looked and saw only Sherlock Holmes.
John turned away from the window, deciding to take a break from the outside fuss. He hadn't noticed when Holmes had gotten so close that their shoulders were now touching each time the cab turned or slowed down. But now he had the opportunity to examine at close range, long dark eyelashes, high cheekbones and a sensual mouth, half hidden by a dark blue scarf, in which Holmes had buried himself, bowing his head to the phone. Long fingers fluttered across the smooth display, and John, once again, with slight envy, marveled at someone else's ability to be so clever with the thin soulless plastic. His phone, donated by his sister, had given him much inconvenience, and he had longing thoughts of going back to a simple button model.
Holmes, in his expensive coat and shock of unruly hair, stood out sharply as a darkly moving figure against the dull background of gray walls, bringing a gloomy animation with his presence. As usual, he was admired by strangers and repelled them in equal measure.  His predatory pale face was now adorned with a rare expression of pleasure and excitement. John watched him with admiration; he was suddenly filled with a sense of pride that this mage had chosen him, John Watson, as his partner.
After much persuasion, ending with a clear threat from Sherlock, Dimmock finally agreed to accompany them to the crime scene. Therefore, after the hospital and the morgue, another place was added to the list of where John had managed to visit in one day. Moreover, here the purification ritual had not been carried out for several months.
“Do you see this?” he could still see light flashes in Holmes' dark aura. It was fascinating; he wanted to reach out and try to trace this interlacing of colors with his fingertips, as this was  clear proof of not only their partnership, but their compatibility. John blinked frequently, shaking off the vision, until the world returned to the boring office walls and the dark blue scarf in front of his eyes. They stood so close that John could feel Sherlock’s warm breath on his cheek.
“What?” Sherlock stared at him with the unblinking gaze of his impossible eyes, pinning him into place. The chilling tone of the other was rather ominous; his straightforward plan might have worked, although John was truly ashamed that he was distracted, knowing how important any investigation was to Sherlock.
“I am sure, under the guise of a sect, the “Black Lotus” is not only busy distributing drugs, but also collecting the life force of its parishioners. Theoretically, one of the parts of the artifact, and we are not only talking about The Sphere of Harmony, can be replaced with concentrated energy of equal potential. True, in this case, the results may be unpredictable, and many factors must be taken into account. The conclusion is very simple. A sect is a kind of insurance, as well as a way to declare yourself and at the same time, avert your eyes from your main activity. While the authorities and the Ministry are busy dispersing this pseudo-cult, a trade in rare artifacts is going on right under their noses.”
He never liked to look at the auras of dark mages or Necromancers, they, without exception, were ink stains, occasionally tainted with colorful splashes. The aura of the dark mage standing in front of him was not only familiar to him, he’d had time to get used to the rare red flashes, and to the ash-gray cocoon, behind which Holmes had skillfully hid himself from others when he needed to be lost in the crowd.
“No,” laughed John and looked into the such different faces of these small adults. “The ability to wield magic is an incomparable gift. A gift that needs to be developed, in which you need to work tirelessly and protect. And a little help along the way won't hurt anyone, does it?”
The text on the white paper with the official stamp wasn’t at all what he expected. Carefully tearing the edge and dumping the stack of sheets into his lap, he first thought that there were too many of them for a simple notification of a warning in connection with a violation of the rules for working with the appointed temporary Inspector. He couldn’t even imagine that the date of Holmes’ disciplinary commission would be appointed so unexpectedly. What became even more surprising for him was the fact that he too, was summoned to the commission along with Holmes, which on the one hand was only logical - they were partners, and on the other hand - puzzled. He didn’t quite understand why he was expected to be one of the defendants, and not a witness.
John looked around in shock. He, following stereotype, imagined something gloomy and quiet with a marble staircase, labyrinths of deep dark corridors with oak doors and name plates, dimly glowing crystal lamps, and dark carpets that drowned out the footsteps of rare visitors. He imagined an intricate interweaving of runes and wards, ancient Guardians and the most complex of barriers.
It was clearly not a question, but John nodded in agreement anyway. Lost in thought, he relaxed his vigilance and was therefore taken by surprise. At least now he knew for sure that he wasn’t the only one who saw all of these yellow inscriptions.More precisely now he knew for sure that only some mages and witches could see them, of which he, for some odd reason, could safely count himself amongst.
Much to his surprise, the witch had almost immediately called as soon as he had sent her the photo by e-mail with the description and a request to decipher the sign. In an agitated voice, with accent heavy from emotion Artifactist Su Lin Yao asked him to accompany her to the event indicated on the poster. All due to a sign he accidentally saw and had drawn attention to.
The circus show, which the witch insisted on attending, did not attract too many people. Perhaps it was the price of the tickets, or perhaps the variety of outdoor activities on offer, but John decided it was for the best. Leaning over the window to ask for two tickets, he was unceremoniously pushed aside, while the familiar baritone calmly asked the cashier instead for three tickets, moreover, ordered in advance in the name of the dark mage.
It was not quite the question he expected to hear from a stranger when first meeting them, although in some way he could understand her. He even felt a little sorry for her, no matter how brilliant Sherlock was, there were times, as John was personally able to see, he preferred not to see past his own nose especially when it came to feelings.
The incoherent noise of voices disturbed his peace, destroying the integrity of the moment, without regret he shook off the remnants of a slumber and sat up. He needed Patrick, although any child John saw with him would do.
“Remember this feeling well so that you will never again confuse it with anything. We will try everything together a few more times, and then you will try on your own. I have no doubt that you will succeed, and you can even help others without my participation.”
Again soory for waitng) amd well)) this chap was not full beted as I decided not to wait any longer and post it. We are really nera the very end)))
A white robe waited for him in the closet, and for a moment, his breath caught from the overabundance of feelings as soon as he touched the starched fabric. Gods, how he had missed it. If he thought about it, in his army days, he had, most of all, missed the uniform of the Healers. Putting on the robe, he not only began to feel better, like nothing else, it helped him to tune in to the right mood and get rid of everything extraneous from his head, in order to focus on treating patients.
Inspector Gregory Lestrade became not only his involuntary ally in difficult tasks such as looking after Holmes, but also a good friend. Having lost almost all his friends after signing contract with the army, and then losing contact with his army friends after going to civilian life when wounded, John found himself in a situation where he even had no one to drink with. Mike Stamford was almost always busy with students or family. Sherlock could not be lured into the bar even by voluntary consent to participate in one of his strange experiments. After one single but highly memorable trip with a dark mage to his favorite pub, John once and for all vowed not to take him somewhere where he was known or where he would like to return to at least once.
“And in this, my partner is absolutely right.” Holmes deliberately emphasized the word partner with his voice, which simultaneously embarrassed and pleased John. “Everything was done calmly and prudently. The murdered man himself was forced to prepare the stage for his death. The killer had foreseen almost everything except this little detail. Mr. Wang Kun is left-handed.”
“I am open and listening,” it seemed, he had read about something similar in the textbook, but was not sure that he had not confused the proper wording with something else.
“Now imagine, with the help of The Sphere of Harmony, a certain artifact should be created, but it itself is incomplete and its part is replaced. Firstly, this is a big risk, and secondly, the customer, by definition, cannot be an ordinary mage. The only one who fits in all the parameters is my brother and Moriarty. For obvious reasons, I ruled out Mycroft.”
“No, absolutely not. Fear nothing, I will simply become your guide. This way you can feel what it means to enter the Stream and remember this feeling. In the future, you can simply focus on these memories when meditating. Clear?”
Holmes, confidently maneuvering through the maze of partitions, led them to someone's office. Through the thick transparent glass, it was clear that its owner was not there, not only did the secretary look puzzled, she was surprised to be distracted from the monitor when they appeared. In her sad eyes, it wasn't hard to read the obvious unasked question. John was sure that the same bewilderment was written on his face.
Holmes stilled, deep in thought and not paying any attention to what was happening around him. John quietly took a deep breath, gaining determination, and boldly took a step towards the dark mage. With trembling fingers, he squeezed the icy hand, of which he had previously pulled off the now unnecessary glove, he wanted with this simple gesture, to show that he supported and accepted Holmes for who he was with all his strength and dark magic. This seemed requisite to him, and he did not care what the Agents present thought of them.
The abundant mixture of smells, sounds and colors was supposed to create a festive mood, which, to John' unbiased opinion, the organizers of the festival more than managed to accomplish. According to the poster, the culmination was supposed to be fireworks and the launch of colored paper lanterns. And there was even a small chance that he and Su Lin could be lucky enough to see the fireworks and make a wish launching the lantern into the night London sky.
(1) The Artifact Exchange is a permanent operating market of pure competition, where transactions of purchases and sales of various artifacts are carried out according to certain rules. That is, an artifact is a lot. In this case, they could be whole (the entire artifact) or incomplete (parts of one artifact), respectively. For the convenience of trading with different countries, and, accordingly, different time zones, the exchange is divided into divisions (European, Asian, etc.).
With a thin book in hand and in high spirits from such a successful purchase, John hurried to the hospital. His first day on the job didn't promise to be busy or difficult, but it didn't matter. He no longer remembered the last time he could legally, without looking back at the Agents of the Ministry, apply his knowledge and skills in practice. And even now if it could be something simple in the form of treating a cold or flu, he had managed to miss even such simple tasks desperately.
John knew from experience that the possessed, regardless of the nature of the possession, could be effectively and quickly calmed down with a simple aversion spell. For as long as he could remember, this was an effective, albeit short-lived, measure. To his surprise, he did not receive the expected reaction; however, the "withdrawal" still had an effect. The strange guy rolled his eyes and shook, loosening his grip.
If you replace the phylactery with a living strong mage with suitable magic, then the effect of the Ritual is intensified several times, since there is immediately a human sacrifice, and a conditionally living vessel for the soul, and a source of light magic in the literal sense. The process has never been documented, and the consequences of the Ritual for both mages in the process are unknown.
“How did he get you, John? This guy is just unbearable, although he knows a great deal about artifacts.” Wilkes hastily changed the subject and willingly pounced on John, like a hound seeking prey. This was the second time in one day when he had to not only hear a reiteration of someone else's dissatisfaction with Holmes, but to also try to free his own hand from a strong grip.
Kissing John Watson turned out to be exactly as Sherlock had imagined - amazing, a little uncomfortable at the very beginning but absolutely and completely right. Out of habit, John tried to seize the initiative, but Sherlock did not allow it, slowly and surely forcing him to obey and give up control, as it should have been between them. John stood up on his tiptoes and buried the healer's experienced fingers in his hair to immediately start fiddling with them, and with ease allowing himself to be guided and led. John was clearly unaccustomed and embarrassed, he kept jerking nervously at other people's shouts and whistles, but, to Sherlock's satisfaction, he quickly got distracted and forgot about their involuntary witnesses.
“Sherlock!” Hailing Holmes, John did not know what he wanted more - to stop or wish him luck. He was not pleased with the prospect that he single-handedly decided to hunt for a half-demon, guilty of the death of two people.
He had a choice to resume the practice of the Healer, though not at the same level, but for this, he first had to find a place where he could have part-time work, the opportunity to constantly ask for time off and, most importantly, no serious patients. John still doubted that even with his new-found Balance, he could fully deal with the treatment of people, so he saw a real option of either a small private practice, or a municipal hospital in the outskirts, which would be glad to welcome any Healer. It was certainly not worth hoping for a great salary, of course, with such options, but he could at least start with that. Lost in thought, John didn’t notice pulling on and buttoning his jacket on autopilot, going out into the street, emerging from the dark walls of the Library.
John didn’t know what to expect from the soul summoning ritual, but for sure, not what had occurred. Everything happened somehow too casually and boring. The world had narrowed to the size of one room, a bed with a light bedspread, and two figures. He not only could see everything that was happening, but also felt on himself everything that Holmes did. There were no pentagrams, no runes, nothing that John associated with the ritual of summoning. He must have heard a few words in Latin, but even that may have just been a figment of his imagination.
(3) The Orb of Harmony is an ancient artifact that allows you to harmonize the flow of magic and direct and apply transformed magic to perform a ritual of absolutely any complexity. The potential for such transformed magic is enormous. Consists of three parts; presumably looks like a medium-sized box with a lock and key.
“Then we'll call a specialist,” Dimmock said again, which earned him even greater dissatisfaction from Holmes, who, standing stiffly, fixed a meaningful look at Lestrade. Where he was standing, John clearly heard the Inspector’s tired sigh.
“My humanity is too dear to me to part with it so carelessly... Besides, I have my own God. And you?”
The boy’s aura wavered under his pressure, so he tried to reach the necessary channels as gently as possible.
The loud bang of the gong attracted everyone’s attention, arousing genuine interest from his random neighbors. Such a simple signal clearly heralded the beginning of their meeting, so putting on a serious expression on his face, John prepared to listen.
The lights suddenly went out all across the floor. John rubbed his eyes, tired from reading and got up from the table. At this late hour he was the only visitor on the floor, and maybe even in the entire Library, and he certainly should not have lingered so long, who knew what Sherlock could have done during such a long absence. After all, he had left that one to himself for almost two days, and that simply couldn’t end well, therefore, picking up his bag and jacket, he hurried out of the reading room.
They paused briefly, waiting for the green light to cross the road. If he decided to take the dark mage by the hand, or if Sherlock would suddenly do it instead of him, then this walk could even be counted as a date, a far cry from his previous encounters that he never kept around for long. But he did not have enough determination for such a thing, and when the green light came on, he wasn’t at all up to it. The stream of people gathered around them at the crossroads threatened to pick him up and split him from Holmes. John was worried, perhaps he still should have thought about how to inadvertently take the dark mage at least by the sleeve and keep him close to him, the reason was more than plausible.
“Arghh!” John jumped to the side and started to run. He certainly least expected to be pursued by several lesser demons. Ugly and composed of different body parts from stray animals, but still agile and dangerous. He urgently needed to get to a busy and well-lit section of the street, the sooner the better. More than ever, he was glad that he now didn’t need a cane, though the lack of training still made itself be felt that he decided to start correcting it in the very near future. Provided, of course, that he managed to get out of this mess unharmed.
“... and then he just went and laid down on the sofa and was there until you came… jumped up and locked himself in his room…”
“You flatter me, John,” the elder of the Holmes brothers chided him with a modest smile. “But I will not hide that our meeting was not a surprise for me.”
An intricate pentagram glowed on the tiled floor, drawing attention to beautiful curls and unfamiliar runes. Now what was happening truly began to resemble the ritual of Summoning Souls from a textbook, which he once somehow had accidentally flipped through. At the same time, Necromancer Hooper not only activated the pentagram under the table with the body, but also several more runes of mysterious purpose.
“Is that a threat?” John turned his head in the direction of Holmes, and if he had not deviated in time, their noses might have even collided.
“I didn’t think that you, too, could see these signs,” a quiet female voice murmured from somewhere to his right, startling him a little.
They walked for some time in comfortable silence. John didn't even look around to make sure there was no tail behind them; as soon as he retired a couple of blocks, he no longer felt any gazes or greedy attention at himself. Although he still couldn’t avoid new acquaintances.
Holmes had ignored him all morning, clearly realizing at once what he, John, was so focused on. Although they did not directly discuss the possibility for him to work somewhere else, Sherlock didn’t seem to mind, so he had nothing against it, or so John consoled himself.
John frowned. Sherlock seldom asked questions, only to inquire about something unimportant. The amulet was truly beautiful and was skillfully woven into blonde hair. But no matter how hard John tried, he did not see anything unusual in it.
“Wang Kun and Brian Lucas were couriers, who, under the guise of bringing souvenirs home, smuggled parts or materials for future artifacts into the country. Both returned to London on the same day, a few hours apart, and brought in another shipment for sale. But one of them turned out to be not so clean on hand, and stole a supposedly integral part of the artifact The Sphere of Harmony. I specifically inquired about it, and it’s not known for certain just what it is. There are suggestions that it is a Box, a Lock, and a Key. But those are just assumptions, in fact, their appearance, except for the Box itself, is unknown.”
Habitually joining the flow of people, John once again caught himself thinking that after meeting Sherlock, he began to perceive the people around him and the world as a whole in a completely different way. And it didn’t even concern magic, spells and echoes. Now everything around him was filled with hidden meaning with many clues. He didn't even need the Gift to see, notice, and draw conclusions. It was amazing and exciting as well as exhausting.
Now, he understood her strange at first glance words about humanity. He had never encountered half-demons before. Because of cultural differences and the mentality in Asia, half-breeds were much more common; there no one considered it reprehensible to have a relationship with a tengu or a kitsune. Harmonious coexistence with nature, spirits, and deities in Eastern culture often plunged Europeans into trembling horror, affecting the attitudes towards such mixed marriages, and, of course, the children born from such unions. No matter that they lived in the twenty-first century, prejudices against half-demons were as prevalent and strong as prejudices about skin color or sexual orientation.
“Oh, yes, yes! I, the Necromancer Molly Hooper, as the official representative of the Ministry, give permission to the mage Sherlock Holmes to participate in the ritual of Calling Souls. I take full responsibility.”
"Mycroft," John greeted the Necromancer politely; unlike Sherlock, he still worried about the generally accepted norms of decency, besides, he was a little shy in front of Holmes senior, and he wasn’t even ashamed to admit it.
And now, sitting opposite his potential employer and just nice, witch, John more and more desperately wanted the answer to be yes.
The dark mage did not like to go into details too boring for him and so necessary for everyone else, until he could exactly show off a coherent chain of his own deductions and conclusions. As John had already understood, in front of a grateful audience, usually in his  face, Holmes could speak without interruption for hours. Now he had to be content with a scant explanation, which only fueled his curiosity.
(2) Colloquial acronym for the Department for the Fight Against Magical Crimes and Illegal Trafficking of Magical Artifacts;
The very simple way to explain the stages of meditation is: 1 stage - relaxation and purification of consciousness, 2 - attunement to the flows of magic, 3 - direct finding or tuning to Balance.
“… Okay,” John finally got into a comfortable position and stopped looking through the window every now and then. The appearance of lesser demons unsettled him; it was worth seriously thinking about carrying a weapon with him constantly, or a strong defense. Although the latter had the most problems - he did not have even the slightest bit of a strong artifact, and Holmes, in principle, did not need them, so there was no point in even asking. In the end, it all again came down to looking for a job so that he finally had some extra money.
“Our parents are both alive. I'll introduce you to them someday,” No doubt, only to be heard, and not for some other reason, as John tried to assure himself, Sherlock leaned very close to him and pressed his lips to his ear. “I'm sure Mycroft has already reported you to them. It’s even surprising that Mummy still hasn’t called.”
Chalk with a funnel left by tea suddenly spread over the carpet at once, straightening into the correct lines and signs, until it froze, finally solidified in the desired shape. For the second time on Baker Street, a black intricate flower was blooming - a beautiful and intended only for his John, who now had to stand in its very core so that Anthea could activate her creation.
for helping me with this chapter)) we are also working on remaining one and litle bonus) so soon this part will be finally finished)))
When he only had to cross a narrow street and another gateway, an inconspicuous black car with tinted windows braked right in front of him. From the thrown open door smelling  of expensive cologne, leather and incense, and no matter how suspicious everything that was happening looked, he seemed to already know who was behind it all, therefore, without hesitation, jumped inside.
John was just typing his impressions of his "pillow" technique (1) when Sherlock's voice distracted him from posting a reply, after which he hurriedly excused himself and left the chat.
The allocated office in the east wing on the ground floor, though small, was bright and homely. From the former owner, lovely trinkets, and even a couple of plants remained. It was apparent someone took great care. The small wardrobe, desk, visitor’s chair, and couch behind the curtain were far from new, but he still liked the worn chair, remarkably comfortable to sit in. He liked, too, the simple rune pattern on the walls and floor, and even the curtains on the window
“Nothing wrong. It's wonderful that Sherlock has someone who is not devoid of manners.” This remark, of course, was directed at Sherlock, who, as always, with a calm air, ignored what wasn’t interesting to him. “You're welcome, John.”
“The rune that activates the last and final stage of the ritual is on the right. He would have to show a truly acrobatic skill so that, without changing position, he could reach it with his left hand. Of course, that’s if he had done everything himself and not with someone's help.”
“Good. I waited for you to guess,” Holmes loomed over him with sparkling eyes. There was clearly no trace of the former bad mood, for which John secretly rejoiced. And the dark mage again appeared next to him so suddenly that he couldn’t even understand from which "pocket" he came out. “Yours is in the hallway near your bedroom.”
After some time walking, a masonry of stones emerged from the fog as expected. The old cobbled road led down and up the slope, but like so many others, he had a tedious climb up, he lifted his head and peered up the hill. There froze, the blurry silhouette of a building that was already familiar to him. Tiled roofs, overhanging beams decorated with intricate carvings, and small windows – it was just one of a dozen other temples that threw open their doors for believers and seekers of Knowledge.
“But if you destroy the static nature of the ritual, the message will most likely be lost,” said John already pondering in his mind what could be done in the moment.
Holmes suddenly appeared behind him and stood quite close, so that his breath touched John's hair, and when he bent lower, hot breath tickled John’s neck, causing an involuntary shiver.
Sherlock reached out to his friend, his face open and surprisingly contrite as he took timid steps towards his flat mate, whose fists were clenching at his side. A hiss came from the doctors lips as the cuts on his palms were reopened. At the sound, Sherlock stopped in his tracks, shook his head a little as if to clear it, and made a beeline for the stairs, limping slightly. "
"Medical Conference." Sherlock closed his eyes as if he were in pain, a deep sigh passing his lips as he cut off john's ever growing consternation. Now this development was unfortunate. The conference Skype had been…eventful. Enjoyable at the time, yes extremely, but... Damn Moriarty for exposing things
Now, John was not an insecure man. He knew that Sherlock loved him, but he was only human. After an especially taxing argument or on bad days when his PTSD would grip him by the throat and torture him with no sleep- the less said about those, the better -, he would sometimes get it into his head that he did not deserve Sherlock. That Sherlock was embarrassed to be seen with a man like John; broken, slightly grey haired and older: Normal, not amazing in the slightest. After these episodes, he always felt like a stupid, overbearing teenager. He
"Yes, John's right Lestrade, we- wait you told him?! What could have possibly convinced you to let that out? Other than stupidly large amounts of alcohol, although you've never come home extremely drunk, not since I said I would withhold se-"
Sherlock looked over at him, eyes flickering over his face and body. Cheeks slightly flushed, won't look at me or the others: embarrassed then, but not so much over their relationship, he wouldn't be acting like this with Sherlock if it was. So, something John had done, whilst Sherlock wasn't there. Could be anything at this point, yet he wouldn't blush at just anything. Therefore: sentimental, or sexual. Sherlock let his gaze run over him again. Ahhh, both. He forced himself to give his whole attention back to the matter at hand as John's voice permeated the room, hoarse and slightly despairing, quiet. Talking to himself in the hallway of 221. Sherlock was intrigued, he had never known John to talk to himself much, he was a quiet man, one who did not waste time with inane conversation. which was one of the many things that Sherlock loved about him.
He scrapped his chair across the floor and angled it so he was fully facing the screen, where he could just see himself begin to throw his arms up in the air in frustration, his head shaking disbelievingly at the long legs that were flitting up the staircase.
" I have several theories, yes. One which I am certain on, however. I will not explain it yet, it will become apparent in due course as we watch these videos. Which reminds me: Lestrade, is there any way in which a minimum amount of people get to see this? I realise you have protocol to carry out, but... I don't really care. I could just take them and destroy them, then you would have nothing. So,  failing that, what are your suggestions?"
And with that, Captain John Watson crossed his arms and leaned back against the wall, a hard expression on his face that said he had the patience of a soldier and of a doctor, which added to form that of a saint.
sorry for the wait guys! hope you enjoy my longest chapter yet... i think they're steadily getting more lengthy :P
John gave a sad smile that portrayed his own self loathing, and Sherlock could not at this point stop himself from wrapping his arms around his blogger, hands resting naturally, casually as if a move that had been executed a thousand times before, on his waist. Their eye contact was extremely intense, more so then Lestrade or Donovan had ever seen between the two men. They debated on whether or not to give the couple some privacy, but that had long gone out the window.
"Huh, I guess he must be a psycho freak in bed as well then. I guess if that's what your into John, you can keep it to yourself."
They watched as one as the Sherlock of the past cupped John’s cheek, whispered goodnight and bent down to plant a chaste kiss on his forehead.
"Of course he didn't tell me, I am a detective for a reason other than to save your so called reputation from diminishing due to the 'impossible' cases thrown your way. Now shut up, I'm trying to tell John how much I love him and you're ruining my speech flow. Where was I..? Oh yes..."
He directed his mind outwards to observe what was going on. John was knelt in front of him, his hands bracketing his own face and fingers slightly stroking the ridge of his zygomatic arches as he talked him through breathing. It must have been at least a minute since he had last actually been able to see beyond the cacophony occurring in his skull. Sally's reaction surprised him. She was looking at him worriedly (for her) as he came back, her hands holding his wrists tightly as she counted out his pulse which was just starting to slow. He could see by the indents made in her fingers and the barely there pale pressure marks that she had pried apart his fisted hands. Lestrade had his back to him, filling a tiny plastic cup with the bottle of water that always adorned the DIs desk.
“He always does that when he’s immensely overwhelmed. It doesn’t happen often, but last time I had to put socks on his hands to stop him scratching.” John muttered quietly, gazing at his Sherlock. “You hid the truth from me, love. I thought that you were just messing about. That the scratches were from-”
Lestrade was once again muted, there was no point in trying to prevent this train wreck from occurring. To be honest, it was easier for him if Sherlock just figured it out, no more stuttering and looking like a fool in front of him. He watched sympathetically as Sherlock reacted and john stared down at him like he always did, a slight, affectionate tilt to the head that said: go on, you git, tell me what you deduced now. After his initial (what Lestrade liked to call his deduction  gasp) sound of enlightenment, Sherlocks face morphed into an array of configurations, ranging from confusion, derision and then a slightly horrified look as he paled with each passing moment.
After Lestrade had become less red in the face, and had finished spluttering he finally inserted himself into the conversation. "Sherlock… Just- Don't. If you wanna take notes, be my guest but do not, under any circumstances, say the word 'masturbate' out loud ever again. And that includes variations as well. It's just…too weird, even for you."
Oh, so they were going to have this out straight away, were they? Sherlock would have preferred to wait, at least until he had had a chance to see the letter Moriarty had sent them, but that was not going to happen. I suppose if they discussed this now, they could save time later.
Because she could see it. See the way that they just... Fitted. It shouldn't work. Sherlock was a cold, almost skeletal man who radiated the kind of posh, up his own arse beauty that would not look out of place on the catwalk. He had the arrogance to match it and all. He was a super genius, not caring about people, only taking cases for the thrill of the chase and the more gruesome the better. John was warm, full muscled and short, and where Sherlock was beautiful he was cute, the guy next door. John was so caring about peoples health, yes he enjoyed the cases but he was always there for the victim, dead or alive. They were polar opposites, the love of danger and their dark humour the only thing they seemed to have in common. It was like they were the sun and the moon, Sally thought. Sherlock was warmed by John's presence, and seemed to glow from his praises since the very first case. John was enhanced by Sherlock, and when he needed to step back and stop caring so much in order to think, Sherlock would dim his brightness, but never extinguish it.
The door violently flung open and John marched into the room, gun raised, all access and egress routes checked and accounted for before he lowered the Sig slightly, not fully relaxed until he had had a chance to check every room in the building. There was what looked like a civilian here, and it was best not to scare him. He may have an improvised weapon and John would not act until all threats had been verified.
Sally sat back smugly and waited for the penny to drop. Even though she felt sorry for them, it didn't mean she couldn't get some enjoyment out of winding them up and watching their reactions play out. This was going to be good, she thought as scenarios ran throughout her head. Her favourite so far was Sherlock shutting down completely, his vocabulary being reduced to keyboard smash letters, and the army man fainting from the shock. It was all a bit of fun, wasn't it? Nothing serious would come of it, just an embarrassment waiting for all of them. The less Sally thought about that, the better.
John looked away panting deeply and clutching at Sherlock's wrist like a lifeline. The taller man, still shocked, managed to twist it so he could grab John's arm in return, a crushing grip that spoke volumes.
"Yes, please do spare me, I don't think I want to be here when you unleash all your pent up frustration on Lestrades desk, thank you very much. I'll probably get a show of that later, knowing my luck and this... Moriarty's sick sense of humour."
“Sally? Is there something wrong or…?” John had become… if not friends with her but at least friendly acquaintances that shared good mornings and how do you dos. It had become a game between them for Sally to come up with hobbies that John could take up instead of going with Sherlock all the time, and after the first few times John accepted it for the banter that it had slowly developed into and that was that. Except that John was bemused right now, he had no idea what he was doing here apart from something to do with Moriarty, had no clue as to why Lestrade could not meet his eyes when he had pleadingly looked to his mate for answers, and was completely lost as to why Sally had suddenly developed into hysterics due to his expression. He looked over at his (secret) lover and found that he was scowling, that face he got when he did not understand something. He glanced over at John and raised an eyebrow at him, eliciting a shrug and a slight out stretch of the hands. Sherlock returned his eyes back to the pair and sneered.
And that was before I even knew what I felt about you!" John shook his head and laughed, not like on the tape, a real laugh that made Sherlock feel better about everything. "but it
Sherlock, slowly tilting his head towards John at a glaciers pace, clenched his jaw and tried to deduce what John was going to say. He couldn't, although he detected concern and a healthy dose of shame in his eyes.
Donovan was now seriously considering leaving at this point, muttering to herself about how much of a freak he was was not helping her mood at all. Sherlock darted his eyes over to her and she watched as he clenched his jaw, his face overcome by burning determination, meeting John's eyes once again.
At the end of the search, a surprising amount had been found, the floor littered with crushed circuitry. Even Sherlock looked taken aback by the sheer number. He was sure that they had got all of them, but if they hadn't, well, they had done all they could. They all gravitated to the centre of the room, standing in a loose circle apart from where Sherlock brushed shoulders and hands unconsciously with John.
All of this flashed through both of their heads in a moment: Sherlock had turned and shuffled towards the edge of the bed, dragging John with him, to pick up the damned mobile.
He placed it on the ground and stomped on it in disgust, without Sherlock having to tell him. Sherlock gave him a small nod. There was no point keeping it to try and get a placement on Moriarty, the mastermind would have planned for all outcomes, no matter how arrogant he seemed. He had also found an audio device, and two cameras that had been placed in expert hiding places. For once Sherlock was glad that his brother had a perchance for spying: it had taught him everything to know about bugging devices and where to place them. They rotated around several times so they all got a chance to look in the same area.
completely. John had stopped laughing by now, and was looking at Sherlock in confusion, wondering why he had that awestruck look on his face and rapt eyes. He stroked across his cheekbone with a finger, swirled shooting stars to land on his cupids bow: an angels kiss. John would never get over how gorgeous this man was to him, how essential he was to his happiness. Alive. Sherlock made him feel alive.
"YES! John you're brilliant! You check over there in that quarter," at this he gave a smack to John's firm arse to get him moving. John gave a surprised yelp: he had always wanted to do that.
John laughed reluctantly. His partner could never fail to see the scientific benefits of such an experience, although how much of it was faked or used to counteract his or John's embarrassment was yet to be seen. Sherlock was weird about things like that: The man had no pattern to follow according to what crossed the line into personal territory and what he considered to be perfectly socially acceptable.
"If you told a stranger that that man there, Sally, was a sociopath, they would laugh in your face and doubt your sanity.”
“What do you mean ‘the moment that you knew’? All I can see is the two of you getting wound up to epic proportions!”
John came back to himself gradually, mortified at the memories rushing through his head. He swiveled in his chair slowly, hiding his face from Sherlock as much as possible, turning so the detective's arms were still securely wrapped around him, pointy chin digging into his shoulder and razor edge cheekbone brushing his burning cheeks. Greg and Sally still looked at them in confusion and john could no longer stand it, worrying about how they would see him after this, the humiliation too much to bare.
Standing up from her chair, Sally crossed her arms and marched over to the door. “Am I going to miss anything important? No? I’m getting coffee. Anyone? Frea- Holmes?”
“Woah, John. Getting his kit off already? You’re a fast mover and smooth talker my friend. Ah just joking with ya. Poor Sherlock looks like he’s about to have an aneurysm though! Never thought you’d be shy about your ‘transport’. I don’t know how you boys didn’t spontaneously combust with all that tension. And Jesus, Sherlock! it’s a miracle you have any hair and skin left after all that pulling, lad.” Greg frowned over at him, the sympathy choking in the back of his throat. He couldn’t help but glance at Sherlock’s arms to check if there were any scars.
“Lestrade, as you are calling at such an early hour and using the emergency protocol, I deduce that you’ve bollixed something up. More than usual, I might add. Tell me, what have those moronic apes that you call officers done this time?” Sherlock smirked at him, a playful glint in his eye. Oh of course he didn’t, John thought, sheepishly amused: he could just deduce that his reasons were 100% truthful. He realised in that moment that whenever he had these dark thoughts, Sherlock was unfailingly there: he would stay in bed instead of running off to his experiments, there would be a slightly tidier kitchen and he would smile at John more, make him laugh. Warmth bubbled through him at this insight; he felt stupid that it had taken him this long to notice it.
Even with the depth of his slumber, he bolted up right as a muffled crash could be heard, the gun in his hands and his body half way out the door before seconds could pass, ever the soldier.
"... And on that lovely note, let's please get back to business, Lestrade. I can only deal with so much sentiment and my quota for the day has been by far filled up."
"So what were you gonna say? Any ideas on why he didn't realise, or are you just gonna sit there and get lost in that palace of yours?"
Sherlock snapped out of his panic before it could gain momentum. “Lestrade, I don’t have time for your stupid mumblings, John and I will head to the yard.
Heya all! Ummm just a note to say that this chapter was really difficult to write, and if they seem a bit ooc, I'm sorry. Hope you enjoy it anyway :)
Then, he threw it with a shout of fury, no planned direction. Unfortunately, the phone careened straight into a beaker set on the kitchen table.
John felt like he would get physical whiplash from just watching Sherlock pace a flaming line into the floor, and emotional from how his expectations of Sherlocks reaction were widely off base.
There was a thud as his head hit the wall of the entrance way of 221; the exact same place where they had laughed together, what seemed like years ago. Sherlock was not beside him this time, instead pacing in front of him with a stricken expression on his face, eyes wide as he muttered to himself. You couldn’t make out much of what he was saying, just random words, his pacing speeding up exponentially with his level of frantic energy, a positive correlation.
"And despite knowing all that, i love you so completely that I don't know how I survived before you. I almost didn't."
Sherlock was thankful for john’s touch: he had begun to get caught up in his own head again. He needed John to ground him, lest he float away on a sea of churning black thoughts, barbed as Poseidon’s trident and just as terrifying. They glinted in the waves of feeling, like sun reflections from the jewellery of drowned sailors. His head and heart pounded as one, for once: john had caused that beat to finally match perfectly, now in sync more than he ever had been. He closed his eyes for a moment, just as two dark, bedraggled creatures emerged from the taxi on screen, rotten, algae draped deckhands emerging from the moonlit froth on a beach far, far from here. Sherlock shook his head slightly, murmuring a gentle:
The four of them stood there in awkward silence for a moment, all of them craving answers to different questions, none of them making eye contact until John decided to turn towards Sherlock and pretend, as much as it was possible, that they were alone in the room. He cleared his throat and raised his eyes to Sherlock's, dark blue irises catching lighter ones.
John’s arm went limp, thudding onto the sofa in the small space that was between them. Neither noticed that they were in fact still gripping each other’s fingers, their intertwined hands resting naturally together as John blinked in confusion, his anger leaving so quickly that it almost made him dizzy.
. His privacy in tatters, no place to be himself, by himself. And this hadn't even been the worst of it, not by a long shot. This was
Something in his brain stalled. God it was so obvious, it had been staring him in the face. He just didn’t want it to be true. Moriarty, sending videos, Sherlock’s face after the pool, the longing glances, the flirtatious teasing,  the way they watched each other in a room. God no wonder the detective thought they were blind. He wanted to be happy for them, he did. John was such a good influence on Sherlock, and he actually seemed to genuinely care about him. The soldier who fell in love with the sociopath.
"What I feel for you is magnified by millions compared to them. You- you never want to irreversibly change me, and you accept me as I am. John, you are much more of an idiot than I thought you were if you for one second believe that you don't deserve me. You are wrong, so laughably wrong. It is I who does not deserve you or your love. I know I shouldn't accept it, I should do the right thing and let someone else handle your amazing, human heart... But because I am selfish I will take that heart for myself and hoard it closely to my chest, right next to mine. I didn't want to... lose you. I want to keep you to myself, cling to you completely and I thought that if everyone knew, they would try their hardest to take you away from me, warn you and then you would suddenly realise that you deserve so much better. Or worse, take you away from me without your consent and harm you before I could find you. But you are mine, John Watson, and I hope to show you off to the world as such."
" well, you've chosen a great time to become unobservant, fr- Sherlock. Go on, have a look around and deduce it. Then maybe you can tell that soldier of yours to back down for one minute, so that we can continue our jobs of baby sitting you two clowns. God sake we're trying to help you here!"
Sherlock stood behind John’s armchair, curls in extreme disarray, hands automatically raised in a ‘surrender’ position. Even in the depths of misery and confusion, Sherlock had still remembered that John could be dangerous, and tonight especially may have triggered an episode of detachment. Being woken from sleep by a loud cracking noise wasn’t exactly a breakfast in bed for the average PTSD suffering veteran, let alone one who had spent the evening strapped to a bomb, played with emotionally and then had to witness that same bomb explode, albeit a hundred or so feet away.
He carefully took hold of his hand and pressed it against his chest, above his heart, so Sherlock could feel his heartbeat as well as his exaggerated lung movements. Sherlock calmed fairly quickly under the doctor’s tender care, until he sagged headlong into the uninjured, muscular shoulder that was wrapped in a comforting woolly jumper.
"well hello there...Would ya look at that... Sherlock, I think I have an audio bug here. Bloody tiny thing."
"John, I... I hate to break it to you but... London's finest? Really?" Sherlock snorted out a laugh as John elbowed him with a grin across his face. "Ouch. I am sorry though. It kills me to see you so hurt, and for me to be the cause of it."
I am now the queen of procrastination, I left all my school work to do today and I decided to write another chapter instead :D
"Well, it got to my office at around... Uh..." Lestrade looked at his watch, noted it was now 10:05, and replied "I suppose just under an hour ago, d'ya reckon, Sally? Not sure when it came to the yard, Gregson had it apparently."
"Well someone has to, we won't end up watching these at this rate if they keep pausing and talking over it." She rolled her eyes at all three of them and strode over to steal the remote.
Sherlock watched his partners face fall slightly and swallow back words as he looked away from him. He let John process this for a bit, but he couldn't stand that look on his face anymore so he hurriedly carried on his sentence.
"Sherlock I..." John sighed heavily and licked his lips. "I know this isn't the time for this... But, I just-"
Right, Gregory, just shut up now. Oh bollocks, Sherlock’s now looking, smirking little sod. Great. That's just dandy, caught thinking about their sex life. He hadn't had sex for bloody ages and he finds out his best mate's been shagging his surrogate child for 8 months, what else is he meant to bloody think about! He wished Donovan would just do something now, anything, but she was deciding to be quiet, now of all times, when he needed her to be her usual provocative self. Say something, anything, Lestrade thought desperately, his mind was now going in circles and his paranoia was only growing as Sherlock’s smirk became more pronounced with each second.
Before Lestrade had chance to retaliate, John looked over at him with an apologetic expression and made his way over to his partner and gently tugged on the curls at the nape of his neck in a soft reprimand.
“Nothing that bad sir, just the usual inappropriate giggles and intense eye gazing. Who has got the bets on this month? I swear the sexual tension is killing me.” Sally said all this jokingly; she never thought that it would be true, never thought for a moment that someone would collect that £126 prize money.
It was Sherlock and Donovan’s own game anyway, to see who could insult the other the most. He tuned in as he registered with alarm the line that Sherlock’s’ mouth became as his face shuttered down all emotions.
John looked up, astonished at Sherlock's tone of voice. So quiet and… careful, as he stared dead forward, not even glancing his way. Sherlock was trying to process all this new information about the doctor; another wrong deduction.
“Oh goody, I'm guessing this is the part where you say an embarrassing goodnight and one of you kisses the other on the cheek right? Or is that too boring for you two?" Sally sneered, starting to snort in derision, that is until she caught the scowling blush on their cheeks.
“Jesus Sherlock! He could have bloody shot you!” Lestrade had been on the edge of his seat since seeing John grab the gun, even the fact that Sherlock sat in front of him alive and well hadn’t made much difference to his worry.
"Alright you two, that's enough. Seriously, you can stop now, I'm afraid I'm gonna get cavities you soppy buggers."
Sherlock grinned at him happily, his eyes shinning as he watched John's thought processes. He understood. And he hadn't even had to give the disgustingly mushy speech he had been saving for this moment... In fact, he may just have to as a reward to his clever John.
to me, the fact that I could just assume you were going along with things just as I was, or the fact that I
He is broken: his battery has run out, his heart stops for a minute and everything seems to be a much bigger deal than it used to be. Sherlock remembers that moment like it was yesterday, the moment when he knew he was defeated. The chemical defects had caught up, manifested in his system, without him even
As john slapped him, Sherlock suddenly resurfaced from the overwhelming mire of his head to find that he was on the verge of a slight panic attack. This wasn't the first time this had happened. Too much data, mixed with a load of feelings chucked on him tended to cause his mind to need a slight reboot. This was why he refused point blank to take the tube, no matter how much john had complained. He now knew better, after they had been forced down there for case. That was the first time john had seen this reaction, only one and a half months into living with each other, which he had handled with surprising skill.
He seems to stop dead. All strings cut as his hands flop to his sides from their previous position of fluttering beside his head, a great swooshing noise that Sherlock swears he can hear over the tape. His face, which had been parallel to the floor, eyes screwed shut so tight that it’s a wonder his eyeballs weren’t crushed by the pressure, now snaps up as he gasps.
"Alright, alright, settle down love. I am listening, don't worry, so please go on. It's not often I get treated to a nice soliloquy on how amazing I am."
"Looks like Moriarty pulled out all the stops in the surveillance, hmm?" John cracked, his tone mock bright and addressed to no-one in particular.
Sherlock looked away from John to give a smug grin to her, and then redirected his eyes back to his partner. His eyes roamed over his body, noted the straight back posture and the no nonsense wide line of his shoulders. He left the best to last, John’s face, his army face. The one that Sherlock loved to see and made him proud, whilst simultaneously making him a bit hot under the collar. His John may be small, but damn he could take charge of a room, he filled it and even Lestrade seemed to bow under that control. Not that his lover used it much. He would have to persuade him to use it more often, they hadn’t really done that much role-play in the bedroom yet…
Lestrade must keep pet crickets in his office, for Sherlock could have sworn he heard their chirping.
He rushed off before John could say anything, his singed hair waving a pathetic, lank goodbye to the weary Watson, the soft
John saw that Sherlock was now becoming desperate, his bum almost hovering off of the chair to get closer as his hands tugged John impossibly nearer so that his whole vision was filled with the sun mottled forrest and sky ensigns of a tortured soul.
“John it’s not nice to laugh in someone’s face, is it now? Who’s the one who is always talking about ‘taking social cues’ and ‘
Sherlock took a deep breath and congratulated himself on his verbal prowess, waiting for John to agree with him so that they could get on with it and stop dragging this encounter out unnecessarily, whilst in front of an audience. He may need to call Mycroft for damage control, the fat git could do with something to keep him occupied.
Sherlock growled under his breath for a second, and John joins in with some rather spectacular swears. He slips his hands down Sherlock’s front, prolonging the contact as much as possible under the pretense of straightening his shirt, as Sherlock’s hand slips around his waist. In the background, he can hear the thud-thud-thud of one pair of feet going up the staircase to 221B. He knows it’s Sherlock, remembers the confusion he felt as his friend suddenly came back to life with shaking hands, took one look at him and… well, legged it up the stairs. The Sherlock in an office in Scotland Yard is now looking over his shoulder, curious about how he reacted. The one good thing about all this mess is the objective view they can gain from it: analyse their partners reaction to things they either didn’t notice or weren’t there for. As John thinks this he straightens suddenly.
