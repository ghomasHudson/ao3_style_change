"I want to be as close to you as possible, John, I don't want you to miss out on anything that you could have with someone else." John shook his head but Sherlock held up his hand to stop any argument. "Please, let me explain."
"Would you?" John asked.
"Have you really thought about this?" he asked in a quick break between kisses.
"Not good."
Finally, John drank up the last of his pint and eased back in his chair. "I think that's me," he said through a stretch. "Let's do this again, when I have more energy."
"Taxi," John called before Sherlock could get very far, and before he knew it John had taken his hand and was pulling him into the back of a cab.
Sherlock's face grew soft, eyes letting slip the purity of his thoughts as he said, "I know, I'm sorry it took me so long to get here."
"Ah."
John sighed at himself, at his inability to be honest and clear about anything. "Wait," he suddenly said. "He gives you his washing? What- ahh why am I even surprised." He shook his head and crunched on his biscuit. Mrs Hudson waited. "I mean, with... talking though, generally. Or about his feelings?"
"I've wanted you, like this, for so long," John admitted, the words coming as a whisper.
"John, look at me," Sherlock whispered, and his voice shook too.
"Thank you, John."
"Ah, right. Yes. Good." A bad day had just got a whole lot worse with those few words. John pulled himself together. Sherlock had every right to deny anything between them, especially to someone he had only just met. They weren't a couple. They had never been a couple. And John had to keep reminding himself of that so that he didn't hurt himself any further.
John sighed and Mary gave him an encouraging look. "At least he hasn't brought a client with him this time," she said.
John nodded into his shoulder. "Yeah, I'm getting a bit cold, if I'm honest," he said, reluctantly.
, he really wanted to kiss this man.
John's eyebrows rose in surprise at that. "Excuse me, but when did I become your live-in chef?"
Sherlock studied him with wide eyes. "Feel free to take something off," he said, and he let his sheet drag away from his body as he shifted off John's lap, suddenly completely naked and apparently John was allowed to look, to touch... He kept his eyes on Sherlock's as he fumbled with his buttons, breathing out a small sigh of relief when he got his hand into his pants and took hold of himself properly. Then Sherlock was back in his lap, no sheet, just his lithe, firm body pressed up against John's; kissing his neck, his cheek, his lips, hands clutching tightly again to John's shoulders. While John stroked himself off.
John took in a hitched breath and closed his eyes. Without anything to compare this to, Sherlock had responded perfectly. John couldn't fault him at all. "Sherlock, no, you don't have to do that. I didn't have any expectations." He opened his eyes, took a look at his friend to see if that was as offensive to him as it sounded to John. Sherlock just raised an eyebrow. "We're ok," John finished lamely.
"Did you mention anything to Angelo? About us?" John asked as he tucked into his pasta. Sherlock enjoyed watching him when they were out together. The previous occasions had involved rather too much alcohol to really appreciate everything that went on on one of John's 'dates'. He enjoyed John choosing wine he thought they would both like, found it much easier to choose the same food as John to avoid making another unnecessary decision. Watching John from across a small table, being able to reach across and touch his hand, it was all new and very pleasant.
"Yes, I promise. John, look at me, please?" Sherlock said.
He fell into Sherlock's arms, stomachs slippery with cum, heaving breaths in as if there wasn't enough air.
Sherlock spun around at John's words and John looked away guiltily, but he had nowhere to go.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and nodded slowly. He picked up his glass of water and took a slow sip before reaching for the buttons on his suit jacket and unbuttoning one and then the next. He slid it off his shoulders and twisted to hang it over his chair before turning back and catching John's expression. Now he looked almost dazed, just watching Sherlock over his glass. What had Sherlock done to him now? It was all very well to test out a theory, but there was a time and a place and he wasn't sure that this was the right time to have put John into a lustful haze when Sherlock had wanted to practice having dinner. It might be fun though.
"I don't know, but I did. This... this feels right. To have you beside me."
"You're late," Sherlock stated, without turning around.
"Can we just-"
"You had a visitor today," Sherlock added.
John started at the voice by his ear. He turned to find Sherlock perched on the adjacent stool. "Sherlock," he began, but he couldn't find another thing to add. He shook his head a little.
"Just a sprain, I think," Sherlock said.
Sherlock sat down next to him. "John, if there's anything you need to talk about, I'm sure Mrs Hudson is still awake."
John didn't hesitate again, he kissed Sherlock sloppily before launching straight onto his cock, sucking him through tight lips and trying for as much in his mouth as he could. He heard Sherlock cry out, gripped his hips as he eased back a bit, breathing heavily through his nose as he curled his tongue around Sherlock's cock head, licking over the ridges of soft skin, before taking him back in, further this time, cheeks sucking in around the thick shaft. It would probably be obvious to Sherlock that John had done this before, but he didn't care. They could talk later, this was happening now, and John had Sherlock writhing under his hands as he bobbed up and down on his cock.
He was hurt, John had underestimated him. "I'm sorry, Sherlock, sorry, I- you've taken me by surprise, that's all," he said. "This really is good," he added, through another mouthful.
"Oh, for fuck's sake," John murmured, completely taken in by the adorable nature of his man-child of a friend. "We need to stop doing this."
John just smiled. Of course. Well, at least there didn't seem to be any lingering uneasiness about last night, maybe they were already passed it? John pushed down the twinge of hurt as he closed the fridge door. He should, theoretically, feel better, having got the burden of feelings off his chest. Unfortunately, it didn't seem to have worked like that for him.
"I can't begin to imagine what you think of me, I don't even recognise myself, from that day, I don't-" he faltered, drawing another sharp breath, he refused to spare himself a moment of tears. He wasn't here for Sherlock to pity him, he needed to get this said. "Sherlock," he whispered, and he came to a halt again. John looked up into eyes so soft and adoring, and how... how could Sherlock still look at him that way? After what John had said, what he had done?
"No, ah... do whatever you need to."
John nodded, certain that was never going to happen, but really wanting to appease the man and have Sherlock to himself again.
"Oh God, yes."
"I'll do anything
"I'm sorry, I forgot the kettle," he admitted.
"Oh," he murmured, grinning now. "That works out quite well then."
"Yes," Sherlock said, going back to his reading.
He didn't need a drink to do this - with a bit of practice they could enjoy this without any level of panic. He was just so determined not to mess it up. He needed to relax, stop berating himself, stop worrying about the future - just enjoy each moment.
"Ah, what is your
"Yes, very much." He rolled over and met John's eyes. "You have many skills, Doctor Watson."
John looked at him, blinking away the remaining tears. His therapist had told him the same thing. If he could forgive himself he had a better chance of recovering from this. But what about Sherlock? And that's why he was here of course. To apologise. To seek forgiveness. To see if there was any hope for them.
"No," John said, feeling a little sick at the directness again, as well as Sherlock's concern. "No, it was perfect. What we said - I thought about it all night," he admitted.
"Oh, right, tea please," John said, with a slight shrug.
"Sorry," he mumbled, dropping his hand. He immediately swayed and this time Sherlock grabbed a hold of his arm and linked them together as they stumbled on.
"I don't mind, you go ahead."
"Oh, yeah, I do remember pizza. Since when did a bloody Hawaiian pizza bar spring up?"
He was fine. And that had definitely not been a date.
John looked. He saw a man he would never have dreamed of. Someone he admired and respected beyond measure. A man whose actions, whose company caused John both joy and pain and he wouldn't change anything - not one thing about Sherlock. He was so grateful to have him at all. John wiped at his eyes.
"Well, no," John admitted. He needed to head this off before Sherlock could get any deeper. "But see, until you've experienced it... I mean," he was fumbling. "Ok, how about you? Have you ever... um, been with anyone?"
John rushed into the kitchen to see what was so urgent, expecting flames at the very least. "What is it?"
"John, John, please. I think you'll agree that a man knows his own brother better than most. More so, certainly, than someone who has never taken a personal interest in his own sibling. Why should I believe you have the best of intentions for mine?"
He finished showering, dried himself off and walked, naked, to his room. In the back of his wardrobe, on a high shelf, was a pair of dark blue jeans he had hardly worn because he was a creature of habit and had grown accustomed to his suits. He pulled them out now and threw them onto the bed, found some black pants from the drawer and tugged them on before finding his favourite purple shirt. They had both found clothes to be rather a distraction recently, but he felt that John might appreciate this small effort he was making for tonight. If John was planning a dinner date, it would be the first since they had begun to wank each other off at every opportunity and that made it a celebration of sorts, surely.
"Wow," John said, as he lay staring up at the ceiling.
Except it was only 5.30pm. He huffed as he went to make tea and checked his phone. John had replied with a convincing,
"John," Sherlock began softly, "this won't change anything? The work, or..."
They stepped out together and bumped hands reaching for a towel. John loved it that they were doing these completely mundane things and that they were doing them together. He dried himself more slowly than he would normally, glancing to Sherlock now and again as he did the same. John had a permanent smile on his face, he knew he did.
"Yes," Sherlock replied simply.
"Fuck me, Sherlock, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I don't know how to apologise enough for what I did to you, I didn't come here to beg for forgiveness because I don't know how you're dealing with what I did, and I don't want to set you back or make you feel worse, I just..." Another swipe across his eyes. "I'm sorry. I was so-
He pulled Sherlock to him with his free hand and kissed him again, delving straight in, licking and sucking on Sherlock's tongue, groaning into his mouth when Sherlock pressed his hand against his cock.
"The kettle, John, the kettle!" Sherlock stated loudly.
"I tried," Sherlock mumbled from behind a surgical mask. "Molly's on holiday and no one else would let me in."
"Sherlock," he said, pushing down his desires for now. He could easily do that, he was well-practiced. "I don't want you to do this tonight." Sherlock's face fell and John's heart dropped at the thought of causing him any pain. But he had to be sensible. "We have to wait, what if it's just the drink? I can't do that to you."
Then there was just one word - "Bed?" - and they both nodded and edged off the sofa, turning off lights before wandering towards the hall. Towards Sherlock's bedroom.
"Hmm," Sherlock murmured, still glaring at John as if this was all his fault.
John put down his fork. "They're not though are they," he said, leaning closer to Sherlock over the table. "they're not just jeans. They make your bum look almost as enticing as it is naked, they make you walk differently, you stand around even more often with a hand on your hip when you've got them on - they do things to you Sherlock." He cleared his throat. "To both of us. Have you finished that?" he added as he took another long sip of his wine, clearly waiting for him.
But Sherlock was suddenly rambling, "I don't know if I can - I don't know, John... What if I can't and there's nothing between us? I don't want you to be frustrated... what if-"
"Exploded? What were you doing in there?"
Sherlock let out a sigh and John didn't dare to move in case he spoiled the moment, but his hand slowly slipped from his friend's shoulder when Sherlock didn't respond further.
John frowned, shaking his head, managing words from somewhere despite the sudden change of direction here. "No, no that would never happen," he said firmly. "What we have... Sherlock, you and I, we're friends. When friends become... more than that, then surely they have a strong foundation to build on?" He was desperate. Sherlock couldn't let John's past affect their future. It wasn't fair, especially not since he was discounting his own past so readily.
John wanted to turn away, cover his warming face, but he didn't. He smiled a little at Sherlock's beautiful words and tried to breathe through his tightened chest.
"Is that for me?" Sherlock asked.
John heard himself chuckle and Mrs Hudson pushed the plate of biscuits further towards him. "Thank you, Mrs Hudson."
"Uh- yeah, I'll just get a glass of water I think-"
"Yeah, Sainsbury's was closed, some kind of emergency. Had to backtrack."
He could hear and feel Sherlock's heartbeat like this, strong and regular beneath his ear. He rested his other palm against Sherlock's chest and Sherlock held him firmly around his waist. He knew he was drifting off and he didn't want to, he wanted to stay awake to appreciate what they were doing, finally, together in each other's arms.
Sherlock was waiting when John got home. He stood quickly when John came in and could obviously see the recent distress. He stopped short of John's personal space and asked, "Will she do it?"
"Um, yeah, yes, it was a good day, I suppose, a couple of leads on the new case."
Finally, John rested on his palm by Sherlock's hip, wiping his mouth with the back of his other hand. He looked down into Sherlock's face, he had his eyes closed now, head on the floor, hands spread out at his sides. John smiled, stroked gentle fingertips down Sherlock's chest and murmured, "Hey."
“Yes.”
and wraps his arms around him, holding him so tight he has to stifle a cry, or perhaps a sob, that radiant smile curing all of Sherlock’s ailments, if only for a little while.
“What. Did I. Do.”
John Watson, as he learns, is the anticipation of a lightning strike, the seconds before electricity surges through the sky, enough to make the hair on the back of Sherlock’s neck stand up. But the actual strike never comes and he’s left waiting, holding his breath, skin prickling. Desperate for something to change.
As if hearing the tentative question, the curse sends a wave of pain along his torso.
With a jolt he realises that John has moved closer in his sleep, though the distance is still quite modest. Acceptable for friends, he supposes, not that he knows much about bed sharing. Only, there’s a hand lying on top of his, fingers curling around Sherlock’s own longer ones, and this is probably not so usual. John’s lying on his back, quite peaceful – he’s not had nightmares. The pillow he was leaning on is only partly under his head, which is turned slightly towards him. His lips are parted and dry, and soft breaths are moving his chest in an even rhythm.
But Sherlock wants this storm; in fact, he doesn’t remember not wanting it.
Sherlock’s eyes snap open, and he would grab John by the jumper and pull it off if John wasn’t already doing it himself. After he has struggled his arms out of the sleeves and let the jumper drop on the floor with a soft thud, they both stare at his chest, searching for the single black dot.
“What? No!” Sherlock manages to free the sheet from the handle and hides the curse from sight.
“Hm?”
He decides that he wants a friend. Or at least someone who tolerates his experiments and his talking and not talking, and his magician’s hat full of moods, like rabbits whose colour even he can seldom guess before they jump out of it. The inside of his head is not always the safest place to be, so he would appreciate company. He might call his mind a palace, but sometimes it reminds him more of a labyrinth, its hedges high and the right path hard to find.
“Okay,” John says. “That’s good. Tell me if it becomes too much. I don’t want you to lose consciousness again.”
, he means.
When John finally comes home, he doesn’t so much
He finds nothing.
“Yes, you were rather straightforward. Or perhaps not so ‘straight’ in retrospect.” Sherlock quirks a smile at his own terrible joke.
Lately, Sherlock has found another thing he can’t seem to control.
“No, no you bloody can’t. You sleep way too little, you barely eatꟷ Sherlock? You okay?”
But he’s not wrong about the limp. As they leave the restaurant in a hurry, Sherlock throws a quick look back and smirks, proud of himself, and pulls out his phone to send a text.
“Anyway, I’m going to test my theory now, okay?”
you? Who? Why?”
John’s eyes bore into his. “Let what happen?”
“You mean someone
“Yes, well… I didn’t think you’d want it. I told myself I’d have to give up on you, that there was no way you could, you know. Because you said… And it would be fine. I mean, it’s still fine. I just, uh.” Probably realising he’s not making much sense, John shakes his head and leaves the sentence unfinished. “By the way, sorry about the, er, personal questions.”
Once, John comes home early.
I'm back earlier than expected because apparently I just can't stop writing this? Now I really have to focus on school stuff for a while, though.
Still, after all this time, he longs for something he’s not supposed to have.
This finally silences John. Sherlock catches a glimpse of his hurt look as he turns away, and it’s just like he imagined: John’s mouth is a hard line and his eyes are burning. But there’s no other choice. Sherlock grabs his coat and scarf and tries to forget the gentle hand that had held his just a few minutes ago.
, a soft puff against John’s cheek.
He is standing on a rooftop, looking down at a tiny ant of a man, yet even from this height he recognizes the familiar posture and gait. Hearing John’s confusion and fear on the phone makes his hands shake.
Stirring in surprise, John clears his throat and doesn’t face him either as he says, “Well, it was my turn.”
“Hi,” John says, relief evident in the roughness of his voice, unaware of the little storm brewing inside Sherlock. “How are you feeling?”
“Piss off,” he mutters.
The storm rages around Sherlock, snowflakes seeming to target his face like missiles as he twists on his feet, squinting at the street in search of a cab. His eyelashes and cheeks are already damp where the snow has melted, and his hair is sticking to his forehead; he must look as terrible as he feels. He wraps the scarf better around his neck, at last spotting the black vehicle he’s looking for.
When he blinks awake to the seven a.m. light, he groans and tries to cling to the edges of the last dream, but it fades away like they always do, leaving him vulnerable, drenched in sweat and painfully hard.
“Perhaps not,” Sherlock says. “But I
Apparently the question is so out of nowhere that John forgets his anger. “Of course I’m real,” he says. “What’s this about, then?”
“Brother dear,” Mycroft says with an exasperated sigh Sherlock knows all too well, “I assure you I’m not pretending. Call anyone in this room, and they will tell you that there is nothing out of ordinary on your chest, or any other part of you, for that matter.”
John studies him for a moment still, then nods as if making a decision and retreats to his bedroom upstairs.
“I don’t know for sure,” he lies, “but I must have done something to make it appear.” Indeed, and he’s doing the same thing at this very moment, letting John in, letting him see and hear and sense.
“It’s… fine,” Sherlock mumbles. He waits for silence to settle, then breaks it again. “When exactly did you notice the curse?”
The taste of regret lingers in his mouth mixed with that of blood from where he has been gnawing at his cheek. For the first time in months he craves a cigarette, or, if he’s completely honest with himself, something much more effective.
A sudden searing pain makes Sherlock groan; he no longer cares if John hears. There is a tiny ripping sound as a thorn pushes through his shirt, making them both gasp. Others are already waiting for their turn under his skin, he can feel them, and there are more of them than he could count with his fingers. He squeezes his eyes shut - if a nightmare is going to take him alive, he’d rather not see it happen. The least he can do is not let it take John, too, though.
Next chapter should be up within a month, but I'm currently working on my bachelor's thesis, so I can't make absolute promises.
Jeff Hope is clever, but after sitting and talking with him long enough Sherlock starts to grow tired of his so-called game. A poisoned pill is not how he’d kill himself - it rather lacks a dramatic aspect. But his expectations might be a bit high: he has a curse, after all. It doesn’t get much more dramatic than that.
If you had mentioned curses to Sherlock Holmes twelve years ago, he would certainly have scoffed and turned away before you got to the end of the sentence. Curses belonged to the world of children, as did magic and all the other ridiculous fantasies some people insisted on believing in.
He stays silent and studies the wall, lips pressed tight together. John looks thoughtful, and after a while he removes his hand, letting Sherlock wrap the sheet better around his body and hide the now throbbing branches from sight.
“You’d know if I didn’t.”
It’s been a while since he indulged in… this.
“Fine,” Sherlock says. He tries to keep his expression neutral, but gives in and breaks into chuckles as John grunts at the obvious understatement. “More than fine. Don’t stop.”
“Right,” John says. “I’m sorry I can’t help.”
Clever boy. No use pretending, then. “Mm. I’d like you to tell me something.”
Sherlock crosses his legs in his armchair. “John. I assumed you were going to be late.”
Sherlock glances out of the window once more, the undeniable warmth outside almost teasing, urging him to solve the mystery. But for once in his life, he sets it aside and walks over to John, a much more interesting one.
In all honesty, he is afraid of the right words, the correct translations and what they might reveal about him. What saying them might do to him, and what hearing them might do to John. What kind of pain they would cause, and how he would never be able to erase them once they were out of his mouth.
“What?”
The words curl around Sherlock like silk. “Of course not.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The driver (
There is a word for almost everything. He doesn’t know them all ꟷ that would be impossible and a waste of time ꟷ but he knows enough to bend the world with them.
(Better, but perhaps not the best option if he wants John to actually talk to him.)
“No. You’re way too worked up. You visited someone. Was it Mycroft?”
“Not ‘someone’. Something.”
His stare, however, is blank. “Am I supposed to be looking at something other than your… bare chest?”
John is standing there, hands clasped behind his back, and though Sherlock tends to sneer at romanticism, he has to admit that in this moment John looks like an unlikely hero more than anything. Sherlock’s mind seems to have frozen somewhere between two thoughts:
“It’s not nothing, I saw it. Come on, you can admit if you have a tattoo.”
Sherlock stares silently as his eyes dim and his pained gasps grow fainter. His own body trembles once, twice, until he inhales deeply and composes himself. Not much later the police burst in, lead him out of the building and put some sort of a blanket on him. He isn’t paying much attention, his mind too preoccupied with the mysterious shooter. But as he’s trying to explain the possible leads to Lestrade, his eyes drift to a figure behind the police tape and his mouth falls open.
“You said I was making it worse. What did you mean?”
tell others not to become too attached to their theories if they’re not supported by all the facts,” John says, the blow softened with a crooked smile.
“I know.”
“Bloody hell, I’m trying to help you!”
“You’ve been doing very well for the past few years, and you never seemed to care about my advice anyway. Why are you asking this now?”
“I don’t understand.”
“Sherlock?” he mumbles, rubs his eyes, and is suddenly wide awake. “Where are you going?”
“I thought it wasn’t.” His voice is barely a whisper, not carrying the defensive tone the words might suggest.
“Did he say something weird? Mycroft.”
“Oh. Oh wow,” John says suddenly, in a completely different tone.
“Yes, I did, but still. I want to help you.” John raises his gaze and fixes Sherlock with a serious stare, determination set deep in the curve of his mouth.
The case of the pink lady provides an excellent chance to prove his deduction right, but somewhere along the way Sherlock gets too carried away and soon realises he has left John behind. John with his bad leg and undoubtedly dark thoughts, John who has yet to decide whether he wants to move in with him or not (though Sherlock suspects, endeavours to make sure he does). John who’s quite possibly hiding a gun in his drawer.
He has been keeping a certain distance after the dangerous closeness of their first evening together. It’s not entirely unbearable, but sometimes, when they join in laughter and the corners of John’s eyes crinkle just so, he longs to get up from his chair andꟷ
“Sentiment.”
“How’s that?” John breathes into Sherlock’s neck in between kisses, making his skin tingle.
“Oh. The thing you realised when you came home early.”
But first, John.
“Stop complaining and start sleeping. And don’t even think about faking it.”
As expected, Mike has left his own in his coat pocket, and Sherlock has successfully created an opening for himself.
“Can’t hear you, love.”
They grin at each other. The world seems to have grown quiet, and something unsaid drifts in the air between them, just out of reach. In Sherlock’s chest, the curse continues its slumber. Perhaps he had indeed been wrong about its cause.
“I can’t imagine why. You will have a headache, by the way.”
Not long after, he bursts into Mycroft’s office, not bothering to knock.
Sherlock lets go of the shoulder he’s still clasping and watches as John ascends the stairs, his movements agonisingly slow but determined now that he’s carrying out an order. A bit of sentimentality engulfs him at the sight, and he tries not to pay attention to the pain that comes with it.
John’s eyelids are drooping. He seems quite content now that his questions are answered, although his knees are threatening to buckle under him. He lets out a huge yawn, and oh how weak Sherlock feels. With an exaggerated sigh he gets up from his armchair and settles his hand on John’s shoulder, keeping him from slumping into his chair and falling asleep right there and then.
John sucks in a sharp breath and pinches the bridge of his nose. “Shit. Sorry.”
“Okay, good. But in order for me to do that, we need to talk.”
For a few seconds, John’s voice seems far away, which is completely illogical because he’s standing right there and Sherlock can still feel the ghost of his touch on his chest. He blinks rapidly and catches his balance.
The first weeks of February are quiet and snowy; clearly the sudden warmth on the day they met had been merely a whim of the weather, as there’s no sign of the snow melting anytime soon now. In Baker Street, the days consist of tea, violin music and bickering. They get a few cases, and John writes them up on his blog (which Sherlock pretends to hate-read, but really he absorbs every word). The mood in the flat has lost some of its intensity, though Sherlock still thinks there’s some invisible spider tickling his neck.
John shoots him a glare and crosses his arms. “Why would having a friend make it worse? It doesn’t make any sense.”
Sherlock swallows and looks at the small puddle his shoes have made on the floor and swallows again, but the lump in his throat won’t go away. “You really can’t see it?” he asks. It’s been a long time since he’s spoken so quietly in front of Mycroft, and it feels humiliating to show so much weakness, but he needs to be sure.
“But... No, it can’t be–“
John is dancing away with someone else in his arms.
He also dreams about finding John, or maybe it’s John finding him; he’s not sure. These dreams are much vaguer, a rapid slideshow of hands on thighs, whispered pleadings and content sighs. Perhaps it would be more accurate to call them fantasies, fragile to the touch.
John purses his lips thoughtfully. “Well. That’s definitely weird.”
John sighs, once again filling the role of exasperated friend. “No, really, Sherlock. How’s the pain?”
“Ridiculous. If it was, we wouldn’t be in this situation to begin with.”
Warnings are pretty much the same as in previous chapters!
“Curse?” Mycroft echoes, puzzled.
“What?” John says, but quickly gets the idea as Sherlock pulls him even closer. He kicks the chair away and scrambles on top of Sherlock on the sofa, arms and legs on either side of him.
John nods. ”It’s just, I realised something. I think.” He doesn’t elaborate.
John raises a finger to silence him and takes a couple of steps towards the stairs, not exactly the epitome of gracefulness, but steady enough.
, and he covers John’s hand with his own and agrees.
“Hm?”
“It does seem like one because I certainly don’t see any ‘thorns’. Are you high? No, I suppose not. If you’re in pain, perhaps it would be wise to see a doctor. Oh, but you have one in Baker Street now, don’t you. How is he?”
“Fine.”
“Figured you’d forgotten about it. You kissed me right before you lost consciousness.”
But he had failed to listen, and this pain, this
“Yes,” he says, “I am.”
“It’s never been a problem for me,” Mycroft says. There’s something strange in his expression that Sherlock can’t quite put his finger on, but it’s only there for a moment. Mycroft is a master of hide and seek, after all.
“You didn’t find any help on the internet?” John asks, when the last bit of naked skin is safely behind cloth.
His protests are quickly silenced as John pushes him into his bedroom, strong hands clasping his shoulders and guiding him. This is not exactly how he imagined being taken to bed by John Watson.
He lets the phone slide from his hand, instead counting the seconds between each throb the curse elicits. Seven, five, nine, four; there doesn’t seem to be a pattern.
Sherlock gives him an unhappy smile in return. “There’s a chance it won’t spread if you do what is needed. I failed to do the same, but you still have time.”
He mentally shakes himself back into focus.
“Starving.”
Beta'd by
Encouraged by this, Sherlock smiles and winks at John before leaving the laboratory. As soon as the doors shuts behind him he lets a sheepish grin spread across his face. Perhaps it had been a little too much, perhaps the man won’t come tomorrow, but at least he had tried.
“So it would seem,” he manages to say.
“Fine.”
They don’t talk about that night, and John doesn’t write about it either, though Sherlock is sure he does remember most of the conversation.
“Bedroom,” he commands, realising the double meaning a second too late.
A shiver runs through Sherlock as he registers the implications of this, the truth landing on his shoulders like a huge bird, the flutter of its wings tickling his neck.
“No, but it can’t hurt. Now get ready, I’ll go and get you some water. Or tea, maybe?”
It takes him almost a whole cab ride to notice the pain in his chest has eased considerably.
Dreams are one of the few things in Sherlock’s life he can’t control. He has tried, of course, but each time his subconscious fights back with vigorous force, presenting whatever scenarios it pleases. Sometimes they are quite pleasant: images of London in slow motion, beautiful molecule structures, detailed black-and-white maps or the gentle buzz of bees.
However, because he generally sleeps little, having no control over the dreams hasn’t been a problem until lately.
“You okay?” John asks softly, a smile tugging at his lips, but as Sherlock just stares, a hint of nervousness starts creeping back to his features. He squeezes Sherlock’s hand, just once, then lets go.
“I was right. It’s gone,” John says needlessly, his voice full of wonder. “The pain, too.”
! Neither of us is a native speaker, though, so feel free to point out any glaring errors.
“What, when?”
“It’s fine.
On one January evening, when the grey mass of snow stretches across the city like a tired sigh, a single black curve creeps a few inches upward on its way towards his neck, just below his clavicle. Sherlock has been kicked out of his flat by a furious landlord
“That’s good. So, um. Do you? Want this?” John gestures at the two of them, pulling back a little to see Sherlock’s face better.
Sherlock frowns. “I thought even you had a little more discretion, Mycroft. I’m actually asking for your help. Imagine that.”
And Sherlock has to smile at that, just a little. “As far as declarations of love go, I suppose yours wasn’t the worst possible.”
He didn’t use to be so afraid.
John lets out a hollow laugh. “Bit too late for that now, don’t you think?”
He wakes up to a shaky feeling and finds his whole body trembling. There’s no aftertaste of a dream, just something stale and metallic on his tongue. But that’s not what’s causing his body to protest; rather, it’s a side effect of the same thing.
“What did you mean, earlier?” John asks after a while.
. After quickly dealing with Lestrade, he walks over to John, who avoids his gaze and appears nonchalant until Sherlock reveals that he has worked it out.
“I… suppose you’re reasonably good-looking for someone of your age.”
He shrugs, and the sheet decides to fall off of his other shoulder as well. John finally seems to become aware of the intimacy of the situation; his lips part, his shoulders tense a little and his gaze flickers up to meet Sherlock’s, then drops quickly back down as if what he sees there is too revealing. Clearing his throat, he resumes studying the thorns, his touch now impossibly light.
“John,” he says helplessly, staring at the thorns still sticking out of his own chest, heart throbbing with the knowledge that they might disappear if he could just summon the strength to say the things he’s been keeping to himself for so long. It’s utterly terrifying.
“What? Of course I didn’t, and I’m not going to, either.”
“I… I’m… It does hurt.”
“John,” Sherlock says, letting the name roll slow and heavy on his tongue. “If you haven’t deduced from our current position, I don’t mind your… advances. Well, not anymore.”
, there’s the life that had been missing from his eyes. Sherlock finds he can’t look away either and fights to keep his expression neutral as the thorns twist and expand, quickly cooling his body. His stomach churns.
“Sherlock?”
“Then what was that?”
“Sherlock, dear, why are you shouting? Some of us like to have a bit of quiet in the morning, you understand.”
John’s eyes don’t leave Sherlock’s as they abandon the rest of their clothes on the bedroom floor. It’s a fierce look overflowing with life, and it opens locked doors in Sherlock’s mind, allowing John to step in and walk the labyrinth without fear.
“Leave it, John.” Sherlock grits his teeth as his fingers fumble to catch the approaching hand, but John has already got hold of the sheet and pushed it aside to reveal the curse. Now it just seems like Sherlock is pressing John’s palm there, over his heart, and he quickly lets his hand drop and resigns himself to staying very still while John studies the black shapes. His little puffs of breath tickle Sherlock’s skin, and he shivers delicately.
“Why?”
Sherlock takes a deep breath. “I need to break the curse.”
“Yeah, but please. Tell me properly.”
“Actually,” he admits, “you’re very handsome, John. Now go to bed.”
“It’s a curse, John, it doesn’t ‘think’. But yes, that’s it in essence. Now if you’re going to be like my intolerable brother and insist that it’s all my invention–”
“Yes. You can carry me there,” he says, wrapping his arms around John’s shoulders and pulling his knees up expectantly.
His heart jumping, Sherlock has to shut his eyes to make sense of the words, to savour them. As he listens to the endless echo of them, the deductions start to become crystal clear, organising themselves in his mind in ways that should have been obvious, and yet it took them months to get there.
He lets his smile fade slowly, then sniffs. “Good night, John.”
“Why do you think Mycroft didn’t see the curse but we did?” John asks, his frame warm and lazy next to Sherlock’s.
“Yeah, I know,” John says, “I know we’re rubbish at it, but I don’t think ignoring it is going to work this time. So please, Sherlock. Tell me what happened twelve years ago.”
John shifts, embarrassed. “You remember that, huh?”
, and Sherlock almost believes him.
Pathetic, really.
For once, he wishes Mycroft could read his mind (well, read it even better). He’s tired of explaining, and he’s tired of people still not understanding after he’s laid it all out before them in the most logical way possible. Frankly, he’s tired of everything. “Not… care,” he says through gritted teeth.
“Yeah, if you’re interested. Appeared this morning.”
But as they come home from the Chinese restaurant, bodies warm and heavy from all the exertion, there it is again, something prickling at his skin. John is still looking at him in the same way he has been ever since they walked away from the crime scene, like he’s waiting for something, and
Is John, too, merely a figment of his imagination?
(See the end of the chapter for
him, not quite in the same way he’d seen John, but he’d looked at Sherlock and understood, perhaps on some subconscious level, the forces driving him because the same forces were driving him as well.
Obviously he’s not ashamed of the fact, but saying it feels strange. He has never denied his orientation, though it doesn’t come up often in detective work, and John hasn’t asked before, at least not directly. After his initial assumption at Angelo’s he seems to have decided Sherlock doesn’t go in for that sort of thing (which is indeed true and for a very good reason) ꟷ until tonight, it seems. He wonders if the question had been burning on John’s tongue for a long time, and if something had happened at the bar that made him ask now. Again, he has no answer. Very annoying.
Sherlock sighs; there’s no getting out of the situation. Should have just lied it was a tattoo. “It’s a curse.”
As his brain works its way through a series of recent memories, rearranging and reinterpreting them, he is hit by a wave of amusement.
for the beta work <3
“What I’m saying is, I think it’s the opposite of sentiment. Repressing emotions or something like that.”
He waits for a few minutes, but willing it away doesn’t seem to be working this time, so he squeezes his eyes shut once more, shifts onto his back and lets his right hand drift under the covers.
“Oh, most likely you will remember everything.”
Sherlock needs to keep him in the room. “Sorry. About… you know. That.”
As soon as the confession leaves his mouth, air rushes into his lungs as if he’d been holding his breath for the last few months. Years, even. Two of the three-dimensional thorns crumble to dust, and the black branch-shaped markings stretching across his skin start to fade slowly, taking the dull ache with them.
“Your turn?”
“Hang on, your neck,” John says suddenly, and the steps he takes are definitely in the wrong and oh-so-right direction as he reaches out and puts his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders. Now that Sherlock thinks about it, there’s definitely something cold trickling up his neck, twisting and turning on its way, slowly beginning to constrict him like a python. John’s fingers feel hot against his skin, his thumb settling over Sherlock’s pulse point.
Sherlock comes to with a gasp, a soft voice from the vast space between dream and reality he was just floating in still echoing in his ears. His eyes snap open and scan the dim room in a few quick sweeps. He’s lying on the sofa, his shredded shirt unbuttoned and a blanket covering his lower body, letting his toes peek out from under it. The fire is still crackling, but the storm has calmed a little, the roar of it now a gentle breath against the window.
“That would be for the best.”
At this, John looks up at him with dark, intense eyes, and his nostrils twitch in an angry sniff. “Yeah, whatever it was, this is not fair.”
He must seem jittery because the driver keeps glancing over his shoulder. “Are you okay?” he asks after the fourth time.
Sherlock studies the dark blue eyes, so wide and intent, and decides to believe him. After all, he has already been wrong about John Watson once before.
“Yeah.”
“A case – but – what about the curse?”
(deleted)
With the intention of leaving
“Experiment.”
Sherlock’s mouth has fallen open. It’s as if he’s been living in an upside-down world only to find it flipped around with just a few words.
The question, then, is: how can he call John back? Danger, he decides. And indeed, not long after he sends the texts he hears the already familiar thuds of the cane on the stairs.
“Don’t,” Sherlock starts, but John is not listening to him anymore, not really.
Sometimes, though, the curse doesn’t even leave him alone in his sleep, but instead takes the form of amber and cerulean icicles piercing his chest. In these dreams, he often opens his eyes only to find a new darkness awaiting him; the thorns have spread all over his body, binding him in place.

“Come and see for yourself.”
And Mycroft, well, he doesn’t know half as much as he thinks he does.
He takes John out to Angelo’s to pass the time and to ask the owner about anything unusual happening near the restaurant, which turns out to be fruitless. John tries to fill the silence at the table, and while the incessant drivel and “small talk” of other people usually works only to annoy Sherlock, he finds he doesn’t mind John’s questions, even though he can’t really see the point to them and they rather distract him from the case. At least until John for some unfathomable reason starts interrogating him about romantic relationships.
“But you know, the pain started right after I had some pretty mean thoughts. The kind of shit you say that I don’t think even you really believe.”
fine.”
“So it would seem,” Sherlock repeats. He burrows his face into John’s shoulder and breathes him in, too overwhelmed to look at him right now. It feels strange, being this close, but entirely right in a way few things in his life have.
Sherlock gives him a noncommittal grunt. “You didn’t leave, then.”
“Kiss your boyfriend?” Sherlock asks with a half-serious, half-teasing face, for once allowing himself to be a bit ridiculous. It’s the endorphins, no doubt.
“This morning?” John manages to splutter. “When did I– Oh God, I didn’t… do anything in my sleep, did I?”
There’s a guilty lump in Sherlock’s throat, now that his breathing has slowed to a normal speed, now that reality has caught up with him and the thorns are pricking his chest in earnest. He can’t face the real John, not now.
And even here John finds him
It only takes one carelessly wrapped sheet around Sherlock’s body to change everything, and certainly not for the better. The lack of interesting cases in March renders him bored and lazy, and on some days he doesn’t bother putting his clothes on at all; instead, he walks around in a sheet. He’s always careful to hide the curse, but as all secrets, it finds a way to become known. This time it’s Sherlock passing by the bathroom one evening and the sheet getting caught in the door handle, causing it to fall off of his left shoulder, and John choosing just this moment to enter the same space.
John grins at him, eyes bright. Sherlock counts his heartbeats, five rapid thuds, before John presses him flat against the sofa and kisses him. At first it’s just a taste, a shared breath and a brief meeting of lips, all fluttery feeling. But then it deepens, gradually revealing the underlying desire, their hands joined or wandering across warm backs and thighs.
Sherlock closes his eyes and endures.
He sounds pleased, almost proud.
“No, I know it’s real.”
“I’m not surprised.”
“Oh, it’s not contagious.”
John huffs out a reluctant laugh. “Yeah, definitely not. Sorry, really. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.”
Sherlock groans. “How cliché. We might want to make this one more memorable.”
“I meant exactly that. It seems my f… that is, our association is making the curse spread.”
It is not until the early hours of the morning that he realises the reason for the pain; the terrible mistake he’s made. He flops onto the sofa, turns on his laptop and starts rapidly hitting the keys.
Stunned, Sherlock shakes his head furiously, trying to gather the pieces of his mask that’s shattered on the floor. Because even if John is right, he can’t let it slip. He can’t.
Sherlock falls, but doesn’t get the relief of waking up in the middle of the air that usually comes with nightmares.
“I do wish I knew.”
Following his intuition, Sherlock goes to the sitting room and draws the curtains aside. When the sudden excess of light stops hurting his eyes, he takes in the view that’s so different from the day before it makes him wonder for a second if he’s stepped into some sort of alternative universe.
He wakes up before John, slips out of a dream so light he might as well have been awake all along. He glances briefly at his chest, not yet used to the absence of pain. The marks have faded a bit more and the last of the real thorns has disintegrated; out of habit, he collects some of the black dust still left on his skin for future examination.
He swallows in the ringing silence, the story a foul taste on his tongue, and hastens to continue before John can put one word after another. “You, then. You said yours appeared this morning. If we assume it can spread via personal contact, and one must touch the curse itself in order to become ‘infected’, there has been only one instance you could have caught it, yesterday evening. However, if any kind of physical contact will do it, there are numerous options, the latest of which was this morning.”
All that remains is to point out some of his own worst qualities in order to test the waters a bit, see if John Watson flinches and comes up with an awkward excuse to leave the situation, like most people probably would. But from his dumbstruck (though also confused and slightly annoyed) expression Sherlock can tell he’s not most people.
“You want me to leave?”
Another nod, but the silence doesn’t change. He decides to throw caution to the wind. “Are you real?”
) gives him a small smile, which is brave of him and doesn’t seem to fit the situation at all. Sherlock ignores the pleasantries, rattles the address in a clipped tone and settles on the backseat. He flips his phone out of his pocket and is annoyed to notice his hands are shaking. He no longer remembers what he was going to do with the phone.
“Fine, we’ll talk about it later, but can I come?” John kicks off the corner of the blanket he’s stolen and starts to get up, frowning a little at the unfamiliar bed.
Thanks for reading! Let me know if you enjoyed this :)
“Kindly do the same and put your shirt back on, for God’s sake.”
London has been under winter’s rule for exactly three years, one month and five days. Sherlock is used to the snow by now, even enjoys it occasionally. The frost outside is considerably easier to handle than the cold nestling inside his body.
(See the end of the chapter for
! I'm planning a post-s4 getting together fic that I'll probably write sometime this summer.
“John, erm… I think you should know that I consider myself married to my work, and while I’m flattered by your interest, I’m really not looking for anythingꟷ“
“Mm. Yeah, it was this. I tried to find some company at the bar but I just wasn’t feeling it, and then I realised I just wanted to come home. To you. Freaked me out a bit, to be honest, so I probably had too much to drink.”
John rubs his knuckles against his thighs, breathing deeply through his nose to calm himself. “Sherlock. Please.”
“Stupid choice. You’re risking worse infection.”
“I have no time for games, Sherlock.”
Sherlock snaps his gaze back to him. “What?”

“Yeah, about that. I’ve been thinking.” John straightens his shoulders and sucks in a breath, but Sherlock interrupts him.
“You mean you, what, care about me a bit?” John stops, frowns and shakes his head, like he can’t quite believe what he’s saying. It pains Sherlock to think he’s played his part so well that John thinks this massive understatement is too much. He lets out a frustrated grunt as John continues, “And this curse thinks it’s not allowed and decides to poke you with thorns? Christ, that’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard.”
In what feels like a whole another lifetime he is standing on a dancefloor, surrounded by joyful music and smiling people. His own mouth is confused, the other half of his face still trying to keep up the grin that had been there a moment ago, not quite succeeding.
As he descends the stairs in a few long, angry strides, Mrs Hudson comes out of her flat holding a frying pan.
“No.”
Sherlock breathes out a silent

Sherlock is very... thirsty in this chapter.
“I do, John. I do,” Sherlock says quietly, basking in the knowledge that he can actually say this without a sharp stab of pain. “Come on then, your back must be hurting you.”
is the first word that pops into his head. It’s as if he’s been swinging at his own shadow the entire time, fighting against a non-existent enemy - moreover, losing to it. That is, if he chooses to believe Mycroft, chooses to believe that the curse doesn’t exist.
Eventually he had to let that go, too, as the layer of dirt under his nails got a little too thick, the days blurred into one another, and the thorns still wouldn’t disappear.
“God yes. Shame we already had our first kiss, though.”
“Fine,” Sherlock says automatically; the need to cut off inquiries about personal matters is almost a reflex. He touches the real thorns on his chest tentatively – there are three of them now. The skin around them is itchy but soft, and there’s a faint smell of antiseptic cream on his fingers as he brings them to his lips.
“Do what?”
“I’ve been this way for the last twelve years, John, I think I can handle myself.”
“Yes it does, I can tell.”
"My mother's recipe," Sherlock said.
lured his victims onto dinner dates." He raised his eyebrows to see if Sherlock had actually done this deliberately, was attempting to get rid of him by practicing the same techniques, or if he really had thought nothing of it.
"The shoes."
John stared at him. It wasn't a case. It was another non-date? So well-organised this time that John hadn't even considered it was anything but work. But apparently Sherlock had gone for pre-arranged this time, not just a spontaneous restaurant, but an actual booking of tickets, inviting his friend beforehand, not-spontaneous, non-date. Oh. And John hadn't even realised.
Sherlock was just looking at him when he caught his eye. "Shall we go in?" he said, and he stood up while John drained the last of his wine.
"Oh, really," John said, advancing on him which made Sherlock's stomach flip dramatically and his palms begin to tingle. He could feel his heart reaching unprecedented levels already and they were merely standing in the hallway, talking about sex. At least, that's what he thought John had been describing to him last night as he kissed his neck and wrapped his palm around Sherlock's cock. At that point, things had become a little blurry.
"You'll need to be a bit more specific, dear, I have noticed he's brought his laundry downstairs more frequently."
"What? Sherlock, you're not
"After you," John said, and he followed Sherlock to their seats.
Sherlock had reached down and was pulling open the jeans - dark blue and so tight and so wonderful over his hip bones,
Sherlock leaned back into the wall as John kissed him, he slipped his hands inside the shirt once he'd finished with the buttons, aware that Sherlock had dressed up for him and unable to compose himself long enough to ask if undressing him was actually annoying.
"To another successful case, Dr Watson."
"I was relaxed," John continued more calmly, "until you told me to relax."
"Do you think you might be using alcohol as a coping mechanism?"
Sherlock hummed and thought about it. "I forgot," he lied. John scowled at him.
"I'm fine," he said, and pulled the blanket over himself, closing his eyes again.
Greg pursed his lips together. "Hmm," he said. "I won't bother repeating to you what I've already told Sherlock here. But you two aren't teenagers, John, you should maybe remind each other of that now and again."
"I do not creep-"
Sherlock frowned. "John, it's ok, we don't need 'doctor mode'."
Sherlock looked over from where he was obviously attempting to get comfortable on the thin mattress. "How is this my fault?" he asked.
"Did you sleep well?" Sherlock asked.
"Sherlock, no, honestly, that's not what I meant," John started to explain, lowering his voice, a hand on Sherlock's wrist to stop him dashing off, glancing around them to ensure they weren't making a scene, but then not caring about that and ploughing on. "I was glad you came tonight, I
John gave him a look which Sherlock had only seen in bed. And in the shower. Then he shook his head slowly and said, "Not here," and Sherlock got that feeling in his stomach that he'd only had in their bed. And in the shower.
"No," Sherlock pulled John back to him, into a slippery embrace. "Perfect, John, thank you."
He really wanted to hold Sherlock's hand across the table. Instead he reached for his glass. Empty. Of course. John cleared his throat, Sherlock was watching him. "So," John started, genuinely at a loss now and feeling unsettled about that. Sherlock waited patiently for him to go on. "Greg," he blurted. "Haven't seen him lately, has he run out of work?"
"Oh, God, no, Sherlock not at all, not from my point of view, no," John insisted.
His breath caught as he stroked himself, and Sherlock looked down, his expression somewhere between shocked and turned on.
to get into, and John had nothing on so he'd go along with it.
John was speechless for a moment, "How-" he let out and immediately regretted it.
"Why does anyone? It's called 'love' Sherlock, and love doesn't allow us to choose the recipient. It just...
John chuckled. "You don't need to change, Sherlock, I'll just try to get my head out of my arse."
"Uh, well, no." He had no other response - facts were facts, no deductions required.
John's mood had been fixed now for days. He picked up his phone at the sound of the text alert and put it in his pocket without checking the screen. Sherlock looked over as John glanced up at him.
He never knew how people did it though, became a parent. How did they even go about making that decision? Even when he was in his dating women phase (which is how he now chose to think of his life, prior to accepting that he loved his best friend and no other) he had never for a moment been able to truly consider having a child with any of them. Which was another reason for so many break-ups, he supposed.
He would be the first to admit that he had been neglecting his cases, he was able to solve most within the time to took to write a text of course, but the lengthier ones were building up and for some reason John hadn't been demanding that Sherlock get to them. His reputation was on the line, he should get back to it. But at the moment his concern was John. What they had together, what they had managed to achieve between them once Sherlock had struggled through his emotions and realised he could do this.
"John, it's ok-"
Sherlock jumped up. "I'll get it," he said, and quickly filled a glass and passed it to him before reaching for a jug and filling it as well, placing it on the table beside John. "Did I forget anything else?" he asked.
"I'm sorry, Sherlock, it's me... I-"
Sherlock slipped his arms around John's waist and pulled him closer. After another moment he grunted a little and tugged at John. "Closer," he said, slightly demanding but that was all good as far as John was concerned. Whatever Sherlock needed he could have it.
"That I'm a serial failure when it comes to relationships? I already knew that."
Harry nodded and John could see beyond the sad eyes to the little girl he had taught to jump from the garden wall into the compost heap, ridden bikes to the park with, helped up when she fell. Family. That was all John had ever dreamed about. Maybe they could get some of that back?
And John had made a terrible mistake making Sherlock wear something so sexy, something that John had bought for him. He swallowed hard as Sherlock flopped onto the sofa.
Sherlock gently dropped the peas on to the coffee table and turned further towards John. John straightened up, clearing his throat.
"No, never," John replied instantly.
"So your past, is also firmly in its place?" Sherlock asked, tentatively.
"Something involving less noise and less people, I'd imagine."
John really wanted to lean his head against Sherlock's shoulder and close his eyes as well. He kept his eyes on the streets outside and eased back on his own seat, trying to get comfy for the short journey whilst ignoring the swirling warnings of nausea in his stomach.
"You ok?" John gasped out, only just capable of rational thought himself, but he forced himself to be aware.
want," John told him pointedly.
"The case," John said, voice lowered. "Who are we looking for?"
"Sherlock, I want to talk... to you," John nodded, as if confirming this to himself as well as to Sherlock, who was watching from his chair. "Yes," he added, and planted his feet, hands on hips. He waited for a moment, Sherlock didn't speak, didn't appear to understand why John wasn't speaking. "Ah- right."
John tried hard over the next few days to reach for tea and not alcohol. To not over-think what he wanted to ask Sherlock, because taking it slow was actually the best thing they could do, he knew that. Kissing Sherlock was more than he had ever imagined possible and he would smile just thinking about the next time he'd be able to touch him. The rest... well, there was no rush.
John pursed his lips and breathed in through his nose, eyes closed, head back against the cushions for a second. "No," he finally said. "No, no, it's fine."
"I really didn't think you would be this upset, John."
"Are you sleeping?" Sherlock murmured, and John was so shocked to hear the soft voice above him he looked up again into his face.
Sherlock clapped Lestrade on the shoulder and all but shoved him towards the door. He'd unceremoniously evicted people from his presence many times but this seemed altogether gentler. John couldn't help but think Sherlock was glad that their friends now knew about them. John was glad. Mortified, but glad.
"Nothing I haven't done before. There was less sodium this time, maybe that's where I went wrong..." Sherlock mused as they wandered.
"All right, I'll leave you to it - but you have to promise me to come down to the station and tell me all about this. Both of you," he said, pointing a finger at each of them in turn.
"I think it's fair to say that you started these relationships the wrong way around," Sherlock continued on, apparently oblivious to John's discomfort, or maybe just enjoying it. "Did you make friends with any of these women first? Was there anything between you that made you enjoy their company, first and foremost, as opposed to their bodies?"
Over his anger now, since the last time they talked about his sister, John asked, "What do you think? Should I give her another chance?"
"Right, well..." Sherlock sat up and looked at himself. "I suddenly feel rather under-dressed for this," he said quietly, seriously.
He turned back and John was staring, waiting for a response. Sherlock frowned. "What was what?" he asked. He had pulled on his jacket but left his coat over one arm, giving John a better view. He knew he'd like that.
John nodded, "True." Mary went back to her desk. She had only a week left to work her notice and John would miss the ease of their routine during his surgeries. He didn't expect his next receptionist would be so willing to handle Sherlock.
John wanted to kick himself. What the actual fuck was he thinking, doing this to Sherlock? "God, no, no not at all. Shit, I'm so sorry." He hung his head, he felt terrible. "Nothing is going to change, Sherlock, I just needed to get this out there... but, with hindsight, I definitely should have kept it to myself."
"Mmm?"
John wanted to reach across and yank him over their breakfast things so he could show him just what friends could do if they both wanted it.
Sherlock wasn't like that. Soft words, forgiveness, understanding where there was nothing to understand. That was Sherlock's way.
“Not long after you stormed off,” John glances at him sideways, “I noticed my chest hurt a bit. Went to the loo and noticed this little dot. I was so pissed off I tried to just ignore it, and that made me think. I’m pretty sure it doesn’t spread via personal contact. It’s more like an idea or, uh, a certain way of thinking.”
“No. No, I’m not asking… No. I’m just saying, it’s all fine.”
“Nope, don’t lie. First of all, you said sentiment made the curse worse.”
The chase that follows is a blurry collection of sweat, adrenaline and laughter, and when they are finally leaning back against the wall in Baker Street, shoulders brushing, Sherlock’s chest doesn’t even twinge. The thorns are sleeping, the cold more manageable than in years. Contrary to what he’d expected, having someone akin to a friend accompanying him seems to have a positive effect on the curse. An unsettling thought – he needs more data. But that has to wait. The case requires his attention; he has no time to listen to John’s admittedly charming, high-pitched giggle.
“I know the curse is real,” John cuts in again, “because there’s one on me, too.”
“I suppose it was what people might call ‘hand-holding’, though most likely you just reached for the closest available source of warmth.”
Talking, of course. Sherlock closes his eyes in annoyance and sighs.
The next day turns out to be a bizarre one. He is almost thankful for the two hours of sleep he managed to get because it makes his currently racing thoughts a bit duller at the edges. He tries to busy himself with moving his possessions in the new flat in Baker Street, but can’t resist counting the awfully long minutes until seven p.m.
“It’s spring,” Sherlock blurts out, more to himself than John.
“Goddammit,” John breathes as an afterthought, then relaxes as if the weight of what he’s just said had come close to crushing him. Maybe it really had; Sherlock knows his own feelings are consuming him from the inside out.
Still, the idea keeps nagging at him.
Sherlock comes to a halt at the top of the stairs, peering into the flat as he tries to catch his breath. He immediately knows John isn’t home, and it only boosts his anxiety, however unreasonable it is. He hangs his soaking coat in the bathroom, dries off his hair, and lights a fire in the fireplace, all without turning on the lights. He isn’t completely sure why, but it feels safer somehow.
They fill the gaps in his dreams, stopping to ask for less or more if needed, whispers turning into sighs. And there, in the rocking of their bodies, is the lightning strike he’s been waiting for, electric heat in his fingertips; and a shuddering plea, heard and answered.
It’s not there.
Outside, the view is changing, flickering between a clear indigo night sky and a burgundy one almost hidden from sight by falling snow, like a broken television.
