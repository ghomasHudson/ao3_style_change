Catherine had been like a fond, but distant memory or dream. Now she will never be any more than that. He thought he knew the pain of regret. It’d been a constant in his life since the day Sherlock jumped from Barts.
"I will speak with the manager and she will talk to the gardener."  The young man smiles, with a hint of nervousness.  Sherlock must have had a word with him during the night.  It amuses John, and warms his heart.
to Dr Watson, right outside your door, about the probable cause of death."  He looks at her pointedly.  "It's perfectly understandable, though unadvisable, to burn the very things that killed your friend.  It's no offence to burn some leaves in your garden now and again.  You simply mistook how flammable the weed would be, and the shed sadly burned along with it.  You panicked and fled the scene, but there was no harm done, no risk of endangering the neighbours, since the Fire Brigade was already on its way.  How could you have known what Brian was planting and pickling?  You didn't know anything about it until you heard our conversation.  The only connection is through your cousin's botched attempt to buy a house, and there's not a soul at Scotland Yard who would ever get the idea to look into that."
They follow him around the muddy perimeter.  A large area behind the shed is charred, the former shrubbery obliterated, only thin blackened stems lying like jack-straws on the ground.
"Very neat, indeed," Sherlock agrees.  "However inadequate, I'm afraid.  Japanese knotweed is hard and time-consuming to get rid of.  It's a growing problem, no pun intended."
John gives Sherlock a look, imploring him to make an apology, even though he knows it's a fruitless attempt.
--in an even more sinister way than when John was dressed in explosives.  It's a thought Sherlock can't shake off.  It made him recognise the necessity of omitting the fact that he'd just had tea with Moriarty in their flat, on the day when John came home from court, intensely worried about Moriarty's release.
The cracking facade of his wife, revealing a stranger who still looked, spoke and acted like the woman who picked him up from the trenches of sorrow.
The all male close quarters of the army had messed with John’s mind. He had to hide a few erections, terrified of being found out. As time progressed and the squaddies became a squad, being there for each other, eventually a bunch of them developed some very secret, very straight, circle jerks with regular intervals.
Greg, Molly, Mrs Hudson, Stella and Ted gather in their living room for tea and cake. Mycroft is actually invited, to Sherlock’s irritation, but he never shows up, though there is a conspicuous, neatly wrapped package by the fireplace. John will have to write a thank you note to Mycroft later, when Sherlock isn’t in the flat.
John twists the wire off the bulge at the top of the bottle and turns to the sun, ever the marksman, to pop the bottle open.  He doesn't see where the cork lands.  When he turns back, he's met by Sherlock's warm smile.
“And you managed to do better,” Sherlock drops his voice. He puts his feet on John’s thighs, sliding his toes up to the edge of the trunks.
"There isn't anything substantial to be gained from these bloody receipts!"  Sherlock is about to shove all the bloody mess off the table before he stops and looks curiously at John.  "What do you mean, working?"
He’d avoided babysitting Sherlock after that, making several excuses. Molly, Greg, Mrs Hudson - no-one blamed him for having his schedule full, with shifts at the clinic and single parenting.
“ You know - the old lesbian living alone forever after the love of her life died scenario. I’m not saying she didn’t live a good and rich life after Dorothy passed. I’m just saying it’s not for me. It did feel as though it was the end for a while, after Clara. We were so young when we got together, it was hard to imagine life without her.”
They change in separate cubicles, and as soon as John has put his things in the locker, he hurries into the shower room, feeling jumpy. The showers have partitions, but no doors or curtains. It’s all nice and fancy. There’s beautiful mosaic patterns on the walls and the showerheads provide a rainfall effect.
"Ah, right.  And you're positive it wasn't Miss Cushing trying to poison her tenant?"  John's smile is crooked.
"Why are we talking about this?"  Sherlock's annoyance is evident.  He regards John with narrowed eyes.
But he seems to have forgotten it, and it can’t stay on the floor, because Rosie will find it and possibly eat it. If Rosie didn’t live in the flat, Sherlock would most likely just have kicked the ring under John’s chair. That’s sadly not an option.
"The seagulls better watch out,"  John says.  "That was vicious."  Sherlock doesn't answer, only presses his lips together, tightly.  "Sherlock?" John asks, tentative.
“I guess it’s payback time,” says John as Rosie begins to bang on it, squealing when discordant sounds fill the air.
When they all started finding some routines with a bit more sleep, they almost always ended up at Baker Street. For being two seemingly polite and easygoing people, John and Mary were really crap at finding new friends - not any playground parents by a long shot.
There's very few people about.  An elderly couple treads slowly on the walking paths, gravel crunching beneath their feet.  Otherwise, it's as silent as it can be in a park in a city centre.  There's a wind playing in the leaves of the elm they're sat beneath.  The rattling sound is oddly soothing.
Rosie’s fringe has started falling into her eyes, so after breakfast, while she still sits firmly in her highchair, John plaits the long strands on the top of her head into french braids, as he did Harry’s when they were kids. Some things the body can’t forget, even if it was many years ago. Braiding and knotting macrame - he’s still got it in his hands.
"Well, if she'd paid any attention while searching the flat, she would have noticed them too, long before I texted Lestrade about it."
The vocalist's voice is pleasant, the words beautiful, even though he doesn't know their meaning.  The piano's jazzy, the sway of the music captivating.  Sherlock taps out the 10/8 meter against the warm skin of John's palm.  Warm skin, a warm gaze, bathed in the warm colours of candlelight.
"Yeah, so did all three of them, until Brian died," says John, catching up.  "So what's the real reason you suspect her?  You're not usually that shallow in your analyses."
John doesn’t know if clubbing would be the right thing for a first date, or whatever he should call the conversation they need to have.
Sherlock would very much like to devour John in public. John’s inventive streak in the bedroom aside, he’s still a very private man. They’ll probably need to work up to it. He could start by snogging John under the weeping willow by the lake. There’s not many days left until the green leaves will explode and cover the bare black branches of the old majestic tree. Squirrels, still unconcealed by foliage, run hurriedly about the tree trunk.
They've had long silences before; relaxed silence spent alongside each other in their flat, Sherlock minding his own business and John puttering about.  Sherlock doing experiments at the kitchen table while John blogged.  Reading in silence and doing Mind Palace-housekeeping in silence.
Rosie is perplexed at first. But after a while, she starts bobbing her head to the rhythm, imitating Harry’s movements.
Sherlock breathes in slowly, then out.  John recognises that he's unusually short-tempered, but trying to rein himself in.
Molly sighs.  "You'll just have to read the report, like everyone else.  All I can say is there were no signs of foul play."
Sherlock’s ordered a lush chocolate cake. He seems to be convinced that he’ll be able to cultivate Rosie’s taste by starting early.
Little by little he touches Sherlock’s cheeks, following the cheekbones to his temples, up over his forehead, circling around the scar, then following the brow ridge, and back down all the way to his jawbones, resting his fingertips in the hollow below Sherlock’s earlobes. His left thumb lingers on Sherlock’s bottom lip, feeling the warm huff of breath.
Sherlock steadies him with his left hand.  "You don't need to create excuses to touch me.  It's all right," he says.  "I can bring the backpack down for you, and you can sit here beside me."
Sherlock shifts.  "Good luck, Molly," he says sincerely, which makes Molly roll her eyes, before she turns around to leave.
Him being there for her out of obligation seems to be worth something. This growing bundle, who loves him unconditionally, happily bites his nose and pulls his hair, because she doesn’t know any better. Apparently, a worthless human being such as himself can find comfort in the love from a baby. She’s happily ignorant of the abuse he’s let Sherlock suffer. She doesn’t know what kind of man John is.
That isn't remotely true. But Sherlock doesn't say so. Instead, he deflects.  "Molly will most likely do the autopsy tomorrow."
They put on their bathrobes again and head back to the relaxation room. Sherlock staggers and sniggers. He looks feverish.
“I’m a yoga instructor, as well as an instructor in different yoga fusion classes at a gym. I’m training to become a PT.”
“I beat the scalpel out of his hand. I shouted and shoved him hard against the wall to get him to wake up, come to his senses. I punched him hard, and then I punched him more. I didn’t stop.”
They don't talk about anything that happened in the bathroom.  John feigns interest in his phone while Sherlock dresses in his now mostly dry trousers.  He must be cold from being out in the rain.  He catches a glimpse of Sherlock shivering and John wishes he could warm him up beneath the covers.  At the same time, he dreads the coming night, having to share a bed.  John has no one to blame but himself; he put them in this awkward position, after all.
John's bevy of inopportune moments are astronomical.  This is not the time.  It could have been, a few minutes ago; they could have tasted each other, made love, awkwardly, on a rooftop in full daylight.  They could have ended up on the rough tarmac, scraped and bruised and utterly spent.  And Sherlock would be soaring.  Dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin.  Yet, he would have been grounded, feeling John's warmth, John's heartbeat.  But only if he hadn't known that at an allotment in Croydon grows the very flowers that were sent to Miss Cushing to threaten her.
He’s always loved Harry fiercely. She’s rude and sharp, witty, never afraid to be inappropriate. Has the annoying habit of being right about most things. A bit like Sherlock, that. People who’d never met Harry while sober didn’t understand that that was who she was. It was too easy to reduce her to the rude, despicable alcoholic.
He can hide behind Rosie. He can fail to mention he has Eileen as a regular sitter. He can find justifiable excuses to not go on cases when Sherlock texts him.
“I didn’t say that. I do believe you when you say you’re off the booze for good, even if it’s contrary to previous experiences.”
“You mean how do I support myself now that I’m not living on people’s couches? Jesus John, that was twenty years ago. Do keep up.”
John follows her to the car, carrying her bag.  When Sherlock hears the engine start, he can't help but walk right over the coffee table and flop down on the couch for just a moment, stretching.
Sherlock's well aware that John's been staring at him.  Not only just now, but for a time, increasingly more frequent than before.  It isn't unexpected in itself; Sherlock regularly does things which amazes John.  However, the soft look on his face when Sherlock catches him staring, is a rather peculiar development.  It's not as if they've had any adrenaline inducing chases, or the like, in the last couple of weeks.  Even so, there's a distinct change in John's demeanour when observing Sherlock.  Yes, that's it.  It's not merely an expression of wonder at Sherlock's capabilities, he is actually observing.
He’d had relationships with women. Not very successful, but at least he wanted it. Or did he? Why did he never commit? Did he self-sabotage on purpose? It’s been the easy way, choosing to hide. At least it seemed easy, until Sherlock came along. But what’s the cost for hiding from oneself?
Sherlock watches his red glans with heavy-lidded eyes, lips wet from saliva. Then he pushes forward, letting John’s cock slide in between his lips, into the wetness of his mouth. He hums and John almost hyperventilates from the sound of his voice and - at last - the sensation of it, too. Sherlock doesn’t move, only presses his tongue lightly against John’s frenulum. Waits until John’s breathing evens out.
“Nevermind,” he starts again. “Sherlock pushed me to get back with Mary. That’s mainly it. So I did the honourable thing. But I was crap at it. I almost missed Rosie’s birth because I was too wrapped up in following Sherlock on cases. Well, partly it was because Mary had a rather fast labour progression. A first time delivery usually-”
' to Sherlock.  "Sorry?  Ah, um, right, right.  No.  No, that's not a problem.  It's fine.  It's all fine.  Yeah.  Right.  Ta... Oh, wait!  We need transport.  Wonderful!  Um, we're at... where are we Sherlock?"
They had talked long into the night - about Catherine and Dorothy, about how they had been able to fly under the radar. How lesbian and gay experiences differ due to society’s expectations. How the contempt for femininity affects gay men, how the sexualisation of lesbians makes them a target for straight men. How bisexuals are largely invisible, leaving people like John feeling isolated, without role models. About the crushing loneliness of being on one’s own, trusting no-one, fearing everyone’s judgement, wondering - fearing - if they might be right. About ignoring it, pushing it back into secrecy until you meet someone who can’t be reduced to a quick shameful shag in the dark. About choosing conformity, just so you can label it and get a grip around something. Something tangible, traditional, safe. About still feeling lonely and then losing it all.
He goes through the motions of her funeral, letting Stella and Ted take care of Rosie as much as they offer.
That whole night had been about nostalgia, as arranged by Sherlock. With it had come, unexpectedly, drunken horny John Watson. The physical attraction that had been evident from the day they met had returned, transformed from sparkling electricity between them to open lust, treacle slow and dangerous, because acting on it could have ruined the life John sought.
He looks as debauched and giddy as John feels. Sherlock’s head is lolling, he brushes his cheek against the inside of John’s thigh, inhaling him. John’s cock jerk at the sight.
John blinks.  He's suddenly feeling warm and fluttery, like an infatuated schoolboy, as he remembers the kiss in their little humming tunnel of love.  The memory of his blatant demonstration of desire makes his cheeks heat in reminiscence.  He was ready to take things further right then and there.  He can't be sure, but it seemed Sherlock was in a similar mood just now, on the roof, before John tried to be cheeky and made stupid remarks.
They continue to sort through close to two-hundred receipts, confirming each and every one of them listing the payment by the same card.
“You know how it was. It was all sissy this and faggot that, poof here and queer there, and burn those disease spreading perverts and cut the balls off that fucking pedophile before he assaults our kids. Fucking Dad, and all other homophobes,” he spits with a sudden anger he hasn’t felt in many years, hasn’t directed to its source. “It wasn't anything I could ever talk to someone about. Not any way I could know that I wasn't abnormal, liking both boys and girls. But unlike you, I had a choice. I still liked girls and could ignore the other part, the sick part of me. I didn't have to put myself in your situation.”
So he offers a false apology, creates a tale of dangers and risks and horrible outcomes. He writes Sherlock a letter, saying he can’t do such things anymore, not when he’s become a father.
"No, I mean it," Sherlock insists.  "Apparently I drew the wrong conclusions.  I thought it meant I should keep you at a distance, as to not endanger you further.  I could not have been more wrong."
As it happens, they all three sit down on that wooden bench, now covered in dew.  John is in the middle, as a physical manifestation of the bumper role he often takes upon himself when Sherlock is dealing with clients.  They listen as Wendy Badu tells her story.
At the beginning of November, Rosie empties the kitchen of all its boxes and bowls with a determined energy. She then proceeds to throw them down the stairs, one by one, watching in fascination how all of them tumble and bounce differently. She laughs uproariously when each item lands at the bottom. Sherlock, of course, chooses to let it all play out while he documents her deeds for posterity on his phone, smirking as he recalls it’s Guy Fawkes Day and silently applauds her destruction in honor of civil disobedience.
“You never seemed scared. You always had a clever comeback. As I remember it, you provoked him frequently.”
John needs to get close. Closer. Unable to help himself, he crowds Sherlock, stepping into him, stepping beyond him until Sherlock loses his balance and needs to take a step back. John does it again, and somehow they stumble into something similar to their dancing lessons.
"And the cardboard box came right before Moriarty's arrest.  The Crown Jewels, John!  Miss Cushing's
He hopes the spa setting will offer them a relaxed, laid back atmosphere. The conversation John is planning to have with Sherlock will be fraught with tension. He needs to own up to his failings, admit his transgressions. Say it to Sherlock’s face, and ask for forgiveness. He should have done it a very long time ago.
He had invited Harry to plant the tomato seeds with Rosie. John and Rosie had spent weeks observing them through the condensation of the bottle ends, looking for signs of development each day.
"Because you wanted something long term," John says gently, warm eyes regarding Sherlock in his struggle to contain the emotional turmoil.  "Because you wanted love."
“I chose to not conform. I guess that’s what I did differently. Actually, I’m not even sure it was a
“Fail again and again,” she cuts him off. “Yeah, I know it’s not very uplifting. But don’t worry. As you can see I’ve managed.”
"I agree, though," says John, conversationally.  "Sexual response doesn't necessarily have anything to do with love and devotion."
"It's normal, John,” she had said reassuringly. And he didn't have to answer, and it was good, very good. Mary meant less struggle, more complacency.
”No, John. You’re letting fear cloud your judgement,” Sherlock lectures, pacing. “Just like this case. The fear will affect you and you’ll end up making the wrong decision, like the manager did. It will make you overvalue the risk. It’s exactly the same fear-mongering that baby equipment marketing engages in.”
She perks up, warily watching the movements of his bow arm. Eventually she seems content with her observations and her eyes start to droop.
"Her partner, Kate, who we met in Belgravia, later told me that Irene is fond of Scrabble and silly word games."
John snickers, turns away.  He watches John stretch, then lean back against the trunk again, regarding Sherlock with a sincere expression.  "Why would she kill Brian, though?  She seemed fond of him, even though it might have been a bit of an instrumental relationship.  And how?"
.  It's important."  Sherlock tilts his head to the side and lets his voice go smooth:  "Didn't I ask nicely?"
"You don't have to tell me twice," mutters Sherlock as he picks up his coat and steps past Donovan, already digging in the coat pockets for a fag.  He's out the door and quick down the stairs.
His fingertips are wrinkled after so many hours of water and moisture. There's nothing in-between them now. No nitrile gloves. No distance. He’s steady and sure but his heart beats and his ears roar when Sherlock lets him inside. He has to pause. To see,
"Of course!  I will examine the contents of this box, and do the soil sample analysis, but this needs to be analysed too.  It
John sips his tea and Sherlock eats two more cakes before John clears his throat, gathering courage.
Of course. He was talking as if he still lives at Baker Street. In the back of his head he always does, but it’s painful to admit that he actually doesn’t.
“Sounds like old times,” Sherlock shrugs casually. In fact it sounds even more like John is asking him to co-parent. Clearly he must have gotten the wording wrong due to the fragility of the moment.
Sherlock swings around on the sofa and plants his feet on the floor for the first time since morning.  "A lovely day to you, Inspector!"
He can’t imagine Sherlock clubbing. Actually, he can, but not in his usual posh suits. He can vividly imagine a junkie-Sherlock clubbing. But that’s an uncomfortable thought. Stunning beauty and devastating disaster, like when John had shut him out, only younger.
Having Rosie in their lives has forced them to become better at communication. For practical reasons, and to avoid misunderstandings and hurt feelings.
"Well, she clearly has full access to the house if she wants."  Sherlock leans in a little closer.  "She only needs to ask to use the kitchen."
"Well, more like too low a level of acid, or not high enough temperature.  If it's not done properly, it can create a breeding ground for harmful bacteria like botulism."
anymore. I didn’t belong. I wasn’t his doctor. A doctor would intervene, would have made sure he got treatment. It was
"Yeah, those could have been nicked either inside of her home, or from the bins," John suggests.  He rubs the back of his neck as guilt creeps up his spine.  "Damn, I feel bad about this.  I didn't even open the letter.  I'm usually not that careless with these kinds of things, even if it's something you've dismissed."
“You thought it was Catherine’s?” Harry is astounded. “It was only us who slept there, stupid. When we stayed over. She always slept upstairs, with Dorothy.”
He takes one swift step forward and slaps John's cheek with considerable force. John blinks and stumbles backwards, taken aback by the sudden outburst, clearly not expecting Sherlock to oblige that quickly.
After Sherlock's toes have become uncomfortably numb, he ambles back to where John is sitting, and wiggles his foot in front of his amused face.  John shakes his head, but decides to strip down to his vest and uses his own shirt to dry Sherlock's feet, and then helps him into his socks and shoes, tying them off.  John points out powdery smudges on the back of Sherlock's trousers.  It's rusty red-brown residue from the pebbles, and he insists on helping rub them off.  He puts his shirt back on, full of wet patches, and proceeds to rub off their coats too.  They put them on and grab their things.  Sherlock rests his hand across his chest, tucked inside the coat, ducking his head a bit as a brisk wind is picking up.
reasonable to not cheat on your wife,” he snaps. “Especially with a newborn baby. I don’t understand why I do such things to those I love. Why I barely manage to reach the minimum expectations.”
John grabs Sherlock’s posh shirt, waltzes him backwards until he stumbles over the armrest of his chair, making him sit down. John sits back in his own chair, taking in the mess that is Sherlock Holmes, the wondrous man stripped of all his masks and mannerisms, all those walls of rudeness and indifference completely shattered. The silky fabric of his shirt is wrinkled, even a few buttons undone. He looks bereft, slumped in the chair, his eyes searching John’s face.
At the end of one of those awkward sittings, an unfortunate and familiar text alert triggers John’s latent jealousy. But he is trying to be a better man, so he rants at Sherlock about missed opportunities, and it somehow turns into a confession about his cheating on Mary. She’s there, listening. Tells him to be the man he wants to be. And then she’s gone.
John quirks an eyebrow. "I mean, if someone wants to drive her 'round the bend, they're about to succeed, with you, at least."
“I don’t- I don’t know how. How to-” he stutters, digging his fingers hard into his thigh. “How to not be a shitty boyfriend, husband. To value what I have. To show that I care.”
"Oh!  Of course," she agrees with a smile.  "I thought you'd like to see them for yourself.  Just a moment, they're safe in a cupboard."
Sherlock grins too.  He wants to kiss John again and bring him back to the crime scene, if only to giggle inappropriately.
"If you want to. You don’t have to. John, you can consider it for a while. There's no hurry, the offer still stands if you want to-"
"We're also allowed to kip on a sofa, until the first morning train," Sherlock says with a light tone.  "If you're still keen on Brighton, that is," he adds carefully.
He’d made calculations. What was the maximum dose far beyond recommended, but not fatal and with only reversible damage? How much could he numb his mind before it got dangerously pleasant? He knew, of course, that this was the road to hell, but he followed it willingly, ignoring the danger of increasing the dose to counteract his escalating tolerance.
The tears come rushing before he knows it. He covers his face with one hand, the other caught by Harry. She squeezes it gently.
Sherlock is momentarily dumbstruck by this new deviation, when it dawns on him that John is fully awake and not sleep-talking.
Rosie has made a mess, requiring the need to hose her down in the shower. She squeals in protest as he tries to hold her slippery body and get rid of all the poo from the crevices on her increasingly chubby body. He needs to ask Eileen if she’s eaten something unusual.
"Well, the medication affects the levels of tyramine in your body, which regulates blood pressure.  In a worst-case scenario, the tyramine is increased to a dangerous level, which can lead to hypertensive emergency, meaning the blood-pressure is so high, it can cause organ damage.  Without immediate intensive care treatment, it can lead to brain swelling, heart muscle damage and swelling of lung tissue.  That's why it's contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease or hyperthyroidism.  In short, without treatment--death."
The kid makes a futile attempt to chase the bird.  Sherlock chuckles low, close to John's ear.  "I didn't say that I
But with the guilt comes the insomnia, and the constant stream of thoughts surrounding the events since Sherlock’s return.
John can’t help nibbling at Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock drags his teeth along John’s jaw. They kiss fervently, teeth clacking together, as they pant into each others mouths. John is certain he’s going to come in his pants any second now, sliding his tongue deep into Sherlock’s mouth.
Sherlock slides his hand across John's, positioning thumb above thumb.  He presses down lightly, so that John can feel the jumping of the artery.  "With all your medical prowess, can you tell the difference with only one point of data, from merely a touch?"
Sherlock sleeps in.  John would rather like to as well, but they're still back to back, and he doesn't want to push his luck by giving in to the longing to be near.
John notices Sherlock looking at him, watching his body. They’ve sat like this another time, only John was the one looking, and fully clothed. It had been so silly, Sherlock in a sheet. Then John had seen a glimpse, thanks to Mycroft’s pettiness. Now he’s seen more than ever. Though it’s dark, the scars are still visible. The one Mary put there, and the one he’s responsible for.
They walk slowly along the shore, eastwards, with the sun on their backs.  John is a bit unsteady, as he'd been downing champagne too fast, considering the lack of sleep and highly irregular meals during the last twenty-four hours.
Sherlock does feel a bit stiff after their interrupted sleep on restaurant sofas and train seats.  He's fiddling with his phone when it buzzes from an incoming text.
John spies a slight blush on Sherlock’s impossible cheeks. It surprises and tickles him. What a smooth way to get Sherlock hot and bothered.
"Epitome of ice cream weather?  What are you on about?"  John shakes his head.  "You're ridiculous.  Just put your coat on and pop the collar up and... um, yeah."
Sherlock turns to the next pile.  "Grapes and apples.  Shreddies and beans.  Milk... eggs... tomatoes," he continues, but John's scribbling has stopped.
This apparently amuses Sherlock, as he sniggers.  "Tell yourself that, if it makes you feel better."
She leaves them on the bench, soon swallowed up by the darkness, and with that, all John's diplomacy is used up for the night.  He lets out his frustration.
been allowed to have this.  "We could always christen every surface in the flat, sell the footage from Mycroft's CCTV capture.  That would earn you a pretty penny, I wager, enough to find a flat of your own where you can woo insipid females to your heart's content."
“Sherlock,” murmurs John, terrified and mesmerised, heart pounding in his chest. He can’t afford to get this wrong, so he lets go and steps back.
John checks his watch and the sun's position.  "I don't think we'll manage to get there before sunset."
The shed is small, the door opening narrow.  It would be crowded if all three of them went in there. The deceased man inside is Brian James, a retired cabdriver.  He sits slumped to one side, on a wooden chair in the middle of the shed, facing the open door.  The floodlight shines off the skin along his receding hairline.  He looks quite fit for his age, but death, and the insufferable heat, has made him bloated.
He had never imagined Sherlock being so- passionate, decadent. He had imagined things he’d like to do to him. He’s overwhelmed by Sherlock being so receptive, both pliant and indulgent. It felt as if they were doing everything
"Presumably, yes," John says, pointing to just under the man's jaw.  "There's no vibices or tardieu spots, no ligature marks."
He’d had to set a routine, to keep himself sane and both of them fed, cleaned and dressed in clean clothes. It was a mission, keeping up his side of things while being updated by Sherlock on Mary’s movements.
The way Sherlock said it suggests... something. John’s thoughts go astray. He’d surely like to hold Sherlock down, in general. But not then -
Molly sighs and rolls her eyes.  "While I'm happy to dig around in stomach content, pickles in a jar isn't exactly within my field of expertise."  She stands up to leave.  "And I don't have time for it, I need to finish the report."
"A fall.  I.O.U.  I owe you--it's just words and riddles.  I've never liked riddles."  Sherlock glowers.  "Moriarty said '
“You may not care about your ‘transport’, but that’s irrelevant. This is about us. About trust. Us trusting each other and me trusting myself. I don’t know if I do. Trust myself.”
"The physical closeness, whispering in your ear, the target practise--it was all intentional to gauge your response," Sherlock offers, waiting for the inevitable disappointment, hurt and anger.  "The chase was fake--there was never any pickpocket!  I merely pointed you in a direction and watched your reaction, adding the lie about a knife to see how a threat would affect you."
"You dismissed her.  Not interesting enough.  You thought people were just throwing any old rubbish at you, just to get in contact, after they'd seen you in the papers.  Remember?"
Besides, he’s of the private opinion that it’s far better that she play with household items than risking the flat being flooded with garish playthings of questionable quality.
"When I was 'dead', I spent some time in Serbia," he begins, and tells John succinctly but straightforwardly what had happened there, and how the thoughts of returning to John had kept him sane during his captivity.
"See?"  John grins.  "I told you you needed to get away.  You're not as sharp as usual.  Even Sherlock Holmes needs a little break once in a while."
John goes into the kitchen to inspect the freezer for ice cubes.  He closes the glass doors behind him to hopefully limit the amount of smoke that drifts in from the main room.  The ice cube tray is predictably empty, so he fills it up with fresh water, contemplating whatever they could have for dinner, that isn't in any way hot.
Since she doesn't seem prepared to flee, John soon lowers his gun and puts it away at the back of his jeans.
“You know, there are queer spaces that you could go, to see if you feel comfortable being in that environment,” she says, rubbing her hand up and down his back. “You don’t have to go to a gay club. There are pubs, coffee shops… It’s not the nineties anymore, John.”
A patch of African lilies grow by the garden stairs, their deep violet blue enhanced by the afternoon sun.
They need to put the kitchen chairs on top of the table and let the remaining chairs lie down on the floor all across the flat.
Sherlock reluctantly sorts through a bag of hand-me-down baby clothes that John got from a colleague. Why aren’t there any trousers? Why are there only dresses? The societal pressure to conform, maybe especially to gender roles,
Regent’s Park would be nice. Not the small park in the neighbourhood of his flat. Too many kind-hearted do-gooders whispering
It would have got him done for perjury in a court of law all the same, because while it’s the truth, it’s not the whole truth.
"Miss Badu," Sherlock says gently.  "There's no need to be upset about being caught at the scene. Even if you'd gotten away and managed to dispose of the fuel you're carrying, you wouldn't have passed my notice."
He’s so quiet, impossibly quiet for being Sherlock. John can see Sherlock’s fingers twitch with wanting to touch John’s foot, so he does what he did on his stag night. He lets his foot slowly drop to the floor, then he very deliberately leans over, without the shield of overplayed intoxication, and puts his hand on Sherlock’s knee. They both stare at it, Sherlock taking deep shuddering breaths. John needs to use his other hand to adjust himself, feeling the immediate burn of Sherlock’s eyes on his crotch.
blamed me for her death,” Sherlock mumbles calmly into his ear, stroking his back. “You merely agreed.”
"It's nothing, John."  He goes back to running his fingers through the stones, finding a shell.  His thumb caresses the broken and mellowed form, repeating the gesture several times.  John finds it incredibly sensual.
"I wouldn't have believed that someone would get the idea of trying to vandalise the place where they live, to be able to stay there, and then trying to eat their way out of the conundrum.  So, I guess anything is possible."  John shrugs.  "Maybe she's just seen too many episodes of
John had moved to London, feeling bad for leaving Harry behind. She’d mostly stayed at Catherine’s and managed to come after within a year, living on people’s couches in various groups on the outskirts of society.
John snorts.  "Yeah, I can imagine that.  But that isn't what this is."  He cups Sherlock's face with his left hand.  "I'm afraid too," he says gently.  "But let's see what we've got, hmm?  Let me tell you what I observe about you."  John brushes his thumb across Sherlock's heated cheek.  "Firstly, I can see that you're flushed, which would indicate sexual arousal."
"I mentioned it to Brian.  He was the one who carried it out.  The knotweed spreads along roadsides and riverbanks, and Brian knew just where to find some.  He asked his fly-fishing mates, they know everything about the streams nearby.  So by the end of last summer he brought it here to test it first, to see if he could make it grow. And it sure did, so he planted it behind the shed in Miss Cushing's garden too."
He returns to the present, noting that the hand, which delivered the matey shoulder clap, is still on his shoulder. He feels it slide down a fraction, turning into a warm presence, a grounding grip on his deltoid.
She sits in her cot, gripping the bars and looking like a prisoner contemplating escape plans. Sherlock wouldn’t be surprised if she was. It’s too easy to underestimate the intellect and escapologist skills of a child.
"Remember when Miss Cushing first told us about the bouquet?  And I said the flowers were significant.  I was fooled by the nonsensical receipts, but you pointed out they were designed to drive someone 'round the bend.  Think of the sustained terror of getting your own receipts in the mail, no threats, no demands.  Someone stealing your jewellery and then returning it, only demonstrating that they can break the privacy of your own home.  And a funeral bouquet.  So very elaborate.  Professional."
It’s a repeated hunt after this little crawler who is gone in an instant, as soon as you blink an eye, already on her way to create the next disaster.
Sherlock is already peeling off the foil of another cigarette pack.  He taps the back to get a fag out.
He gets his socks off, but has a difficult time trying to pull up his trouser legs.  John crouches down to help him, feeling slightly unbalanced, realising he's been a bit liberal with the champagne.  It happens to provide a perfect excuse to rest his forehead against Sherlock's thigh, while folding up his trouser legs.  He realises Sherlock will be semi-dependent on him to get through daily functions.  There's an intimacy inherent in the role of caregiver, of seeing people at their most vulnerable.  John would be lying to himself if he didn't admit that his ethics are becoming a little flexible when it comes to Sherlock, given the situation.
Sherlock sighs.  This is all too vague, nothing concrete.  No clues.  Moriarty's always been dropping clues.  If '
Catherine, practical as ever, had brought out her hand drill and a drill bit barely as thick as a pencil lead to rectify the issue.
When the addiction came creeping in he had tried to stand by her side, offer his help. But it was too late, not enough trust left between them.
“But you wouldn’t be lying. You’ve just stopped lying to yourself. You’re not alone, John. People tend to do that - lie about things they have reason to believe might hurt them, only they end up hurting themselves in the process. You need to face it, John. You’ve been hiding for so many years. Christ, you managed to hide from
“If I’m being honest, which I presume you want me to be,” Sherlock tries to backtrack. “It’s likely not going to help this conversation. You know I’m terrible at not insulting people, and-” he stops himself, sighs, furrows his brows. “I just did, didn’t I? Insult you.”
All he can do is to breathe her in. The familiar scent of her shampoo, the warmth of her skin, soon to fade away. The only traces of the mother of his child, ripped away too soon. Leaving him alone. Alone with his life in ruins.
His tone is unnecessarily defensive. She’s just asking. It’s natural she has questions, after so many years of estrangement. Harry regards him with a frown.
“I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t. I would have closed that door and never come back. Feeling miserable. Just one more failure on a long list.”
"No."  John angles the man's head as best he can.  "Advanced state of protrusion."  He takes another look at the back of the man's neck.  "There's significant swelling around the base of the brain stem, near the cerebellum."  He sifts through the man's greying hair, presumably in search of an injury, but finds none.  "Was he hypertensive?"  He prods at the bulge and grimaces, then glances at Lestrade.  "Another hour here and you're going to have a degloving situation on your hands."
John let the movements of the crowd pull him along, started working himself towards the area in front of the stage, filled with wildly dancing people, never taking his eyes off him. The beating of the drums and the vibrations from the base pulsated through his body, reverberating inside his chest. In that moment, there was no fear that someone would see or notice if they happened to touch his swollen state in the chaos. No fear of making eye contact, only a wild lust that overcame his whole being, wanting to touch and taste the roaring boy and his raw energy.
Sherlock has no idea where that terrible sentence came from, but the words are spell-breaking, because now there's a giggle inserting itself between the sobs in the bathroom.
"Yeah, you've said that repeatedly.  So let me take your word for it.  Hang on."  John pulls out his phone.  Luckily he gets through immediately.  "Hi Sally, it's John Watson.  Are you with Miss Cushing right now?  Susan Cushing that is.  Great!  I have a very important question for you: exactly when did Miss Cushing receive the flower bouquet?  Mhm, sure, I'll wait."
“I was supposed to disarm him. He was high as a kite, delusional and he was about to cut someone with a scalpel. I
Sherlock finds John's eyes and stares hard, a rare sincerity imbued in his gaze.  "You are an unassailable record keeper, John.  I don't doubt it."  He gives John a small smile.  "It seems, however, you may have had more pressing things on your mind."
John figures Sherlock wants to have an undisturbed quick look around, so he follows Miss Cushing out into the hallway, ready to delay their return to the sitting room if needed.  She withdraws a set of keys and opens a cupboard beneath the stairs, picking out a rather full plastic bag.
"Aren't you going to have a shower and a shave or, I don't know, maybe get out of your pyjamas?" asks John, following Sherlock into the kitchen.
John steps closer, hesitating.  Sherlock unwinds his scarf, lets it hang loosely over his shoulders.  Waiting, holding his breath.
This soothes John.  When he's finally drifting off to sleep, he becomes aware of a touch to his calf.  He presumes it's a mistake, Sherlock merely turning in bed.  Then, he senses a distinct push, Sherlock pressing the sole of his foot back against John's leg.  The foot glides, the heel massaging his calf muscle.  Then, it comes to rest, the bulge of the muscle fitting perfectly in the concave arch, still pressing.  Nothing more.  They fall asleep like that.
“I’ll think about it,” John chuckles. He loves chatty Harry. And now he can see her insecurities too, when he isn’t too wrapped up in his own.
John is suddenly very aware of where Sherlock’s legs are, only inches away, invisible under the bubbling surface. He resists his impulse to capture them and instead wipes away the droplets that had landed on his face.
Sherlock shakes himself, trying to let go of these meaningless musings.  He's not very successful, though.  "All right," he says.  "Let's catch that train!"
is a very good question, John."  Sherlock presses the tips of his index fingers to his lips.  "Though it bugs me that Miss Badu tried to give the impression that she doesn't know who I am."
John is tender-eyed.  He caresses Sherlock's hand.  Every touch sends a sparkle through him.  Electrodermal activity.  His sympathetic nervous system is highly aroused.  A polygraph would undoubtedly detect it.
"Oh, my god." Strong, blunt fingers trace the line of what Sherlock knows is still the most livid, prominent welt of scar tissue on his back; but feather-light, so delicately that it almost tickles.
me to fight back. You sprained Wiggins’ arm for waving about a knife. You would know how to effectively disarm any junkie. But you didn’t. You wanted something from me. Otherwise, you’d just have taken the scalpel and
He looks like Jesus on the cross, with his arms spread like that. John wants to linger there, to let those arms embrace him once more. Sherlock does, and John touches the skin on his chest. He rests his head against Sherlock’s ribs, listening for his heartbeat. He can’t hear it, can’t feel any vibration. But Sherlock’s skin is warm against his cheek. There’s a scar slightly left of the middle of his chest. John has tended to that wound. He touches it with his fingertip. It’s wet to the touch. Strange. It’s wet and hot and it’s gushing blood. It’s a flood, swallowing John whole.
John feels his cheeks heat. Blossoming could be a word for it. Depraved would also fit. His blood rushes just from thinking about it. Luckily nowadays, he’s got a bit more stamina than during their first encounters. The mere satisfaction of giving pleasure to Sherlock used to tip him over the edge embarrassingly fast. He’s since learnt to pleasure him in so many ways. Sometimes reluctant to meet Sherlock’s very specific demands, but always ending up getting off on it anyway. There’s always ongoing negotiations, as Sherlock pushes boundaries and John struggles with his ingrained fear of being deviant. They’re still learning, and learning is progress.
Sherlock has never been able to deny him. This whole conversation is futile. He’ll go wherever John wants him to, do whatever John asks of him.
“I know. I’m just teasing.” Sherlock smiles, eyes glittering. “It was quite entertaining at the time, seeing your jealousy on full display. But if I’d gone any further with her, I definitely wouldn’t have a chance acquiring her beehives.”
"Monoamine oxidase inhibitor," John explains.  "It's an older, very effective antidepressant where phobic symptoms are present, or where other antidepressants have failed.  A GP would only prescribe it with the guidance of a specialist."
Ella has reassured him, repeatedly, when he’s in doubt, of the sometimes slow progression of therapy, and it’s seemingly rambling nature:
He wonders briefly how high up the tide usually reaches.  Are they sitting above the waterline now?  Would their feet get wet if they stayed exactly where they are when the tide comes in, or does the water only rarely reach that high?
It’s a stab to the heart. She’s forgiven him, but he doesn’t know how to let it go. So many years of guilt, pushed to the side unacknowledged, still able to burn in his throat.
It’s the shower situation that triggers the nervousness. The feeling of being found out, the fear of being caught with inappropriate thoughts, or worse, bodily reactions. He doesn’t ogle, he avoids letting his eyes linger anywhere near another body. It’s probably a very common behaviour in public showers, out of politeness, but his is imbued with fear.
Because he knew she’d have wanted him to be open, supportive, exposing himself like she had done. And he just couldn’t do that.
"Courtesy of Miss Cushing."  Sherlock smiles, dangling the keys in front of him.  "Catch again!"  He hurls the keys and Sally snags them one-handed.
"You're living proof that we evolved from monkeys," John says, exasperated, carefully extracting her from a bookcase. At eye level.
But in hindsight, it’s just another tell that he didn’t notice in the moment. Mary had always wanted her independence. She’d been an agent and couldn’t be tied down bodily to an infant. She’d always been ready to leave him and Rosie behind, even before A.G.R.A. resurfaced.
“Right. Well, we’ve been playing peekaboo a lot lately. She really laughs her head off. That giggle, it’s- you can’t stop smiling,” John muses. “I do this thing where I hide under the table, and then I’m playing with her dummy, you now, making silly sounds, making it walk along the edge of the table. And then I stick my head up and do a silly face. And she- she just doesn’t stop laughing. She can’t beg me to do it again, but I can swear that’s what she’s saying even if she doesn’t know how to speak. She’ll laugh until she gets the hiccoughs.”
Sherlock is bored, sitting with one of the multiple laptops littering the desk, scrolling restlessly when he hears the lock turn downstairs and the sound of John’s unmistakable gait storming up the stairs. He glances at the clock. John should still be at the surgery, but something is apparently out of sorts.
John doesn't look forward to going back to the frowsty, hot flat.  But right now, he rather longs for his bed... and something to eat, as his stomach loudly informs him.
When Sherlock only quirks his mouth in response, John shakes his head, then picks up his tumbler and knocks back the last of his drink.  "Let the woman do her work in peace!" he admonishes, throwing himself back against the pillows and pulling the duvet up to his chin.
"Just come here," Sherlock urges with a sudden impatience.  John doesn't move.  "Oh, come on!  We've already established that you can't deny me."  John tilts his head and narrows his eyes, as if Sherlock is up to something a bit not good.  "
John helps dig out the magnifying glass from Sherlock's inner coat pocket.  He leans in closer than strictly necessary, just to get a whiff of him.  He gives Sherlock a smug smile.
"I guess it's my roundabout way of telling you that you have my love and devotion," John says earnestly. "And exclusivity regarding the sex."  He leans away for a moment, quirking an eyebrow, waiting for a response.  "If you want it?" he adds carefully.
When he’s cooled off to near freezing he gets out of the pool, seeing Sherlock come sauntering towards him. He’s apparently got rid of his erection - hopefully not by actually releasing himself in the tub - since he’s wearing his towel over his shoulders instead of using it to cover his crotch.
John clears his throat, no doubt hoping to shift the focus away from him.  "Did Miss Cushing say what kind of threats she'd received?"
She huffs.  "What do you think?  After nearly twenty years in nurseries and preschools?  Of course I have bloody tinnitus, and of course I told you the truth about wearing noise-cancelling headphones at home.  I told you and the officers the truth when I said I don't know what happened to Brian, and that I hope you catch the killer.  How's that going for you?"
"Okay.  Just seems awfully complicated to me.  But I tap the laptop keyboard with my index fingers, so what do I know of computer codes?"  John shrugs and takes a bite of his abandoned baklava.
, he wants to touch him now, just a little bit. Be close, feel his warmth. Like when Sherlock embraced him in this very room. John longs to touch his skin.
Today, it’s an up-and-coming young man in a posh suit. It’s not as perfectly tailored as Sherlock’s, and the man’s not even near average intelligence.
"Oh, please," Sherlock sneers and shrugs him off.  "Anderson working on this?"  He runs his hands through his hair and pulls at his curls in frustration.  "Let John examine the body before Andersson makes a fool of himself."
The lawns extend beyond a small garden café, shaded by old and new elm trees.  They sit down on the grass beneath one of the larger ones.  The sun has risen, but it's still low enough to reach them beneath the foliage. It provides a pleasant warmth on their faces, as they're resting their backs against the tree trunk.
, but more of a journey that must be taken in order to survive - steady, constant, multidirectional, like Sherlock himself.  And when night falls, like in the closing suite of
. So very tired of bereavement, of obfuscation, deception and straight up lies. It’s like there’s nothing left to feel. And
Sometimes John plays with the thought of contacting E again. Just to have someone to text to when Rosie is tucked in for the night, since he’s made it a habit of not answering Sherlock’s texts.
Sherlock asks John to move back in. It’s a spur of the moment decision, when they’re sitting in front of the fireplace in the early morning, warming up after a night out, having successfully solved a case ending with John’s smooth and very controlled takedown of a suspect.
Sherlock tilts his head, considering.  "Ah, interesting.  Very generous of you.  Though we didn't actually say, we didn't plan to stay the night.  Or, at least I didn't."
He throws his hands up.  "I don't know!  All I know is that, if there were pickles in all the empty jars, and he's been on MAOIs, then he'd be severely risking his health if he's eaten all those bloody gherkins!"
Choosing celibacy because relationships are messy and people generally intolerable is one thing. Then it’s perfectly doable to ignore the craving and live by small sensations.
He barely has time to register the small smile forming on Sherlock's lips, before he whirls around and sets off towards the restaurant, John struggling to keep equal steps with him.
"A couple of weeks ago.  I saw you on the telly, all caught up in that trial.  Star witness!  I figured you were busy, so I didn't bother writing again."
"Keep it safe," he says and winks, then pushes the box of gardening tools towards her.  "And these, too."
The free hand-out of chips has naturally attracted more seagulls.  One of them pilfers a chunk of fish from the boy's hand.  He becomes upset.
Sherlock's had enough of John's tip-toeing around this topic.  "You want to keep talking about Irene Adler?  Well then, I have some important conclusions to share."  He takes a deep drag on the cigarette and then lets the words surge out of his mouth, along with the smoke.  "One, I know for a fact that Irene Adler is exclusively attracted to women, never mind the performances she puts up in her line of work.  She and I are very similar; it was a bit like looking into a mirror, a form of validation.  She could read people in a way I can't.  But she read them all the same, with her own methods of deduction.  I felt a kinship, and I think she felt the same."
They're back at Majida's.  John can't believe she's accepting their shoddy appearance in her restaurant when there's other customers around.  Majida readily reserved the table in the farthest corner for them.  Quite prescient of her.  She must have been in a dire situation when Sherlock helped her out.
"Um, the same kind of jars, possibly these, filled with homemade pickles.  Miss Cushing used a key to open the cupboard."
“I generally kicked furniture when I found out about my wife’s lies. Threatened to hit Sherlock when he seemed to blame me for her lies. I didn’t mean it of course. I truly didn’t. If I did, I wouldn’t be here, trying to move on after- after actually battering him. It never occurred to me that I would ever be in a situation where I’d do it.”
Sherlock saunters down the slope and out into the shallow water.  He walks just a bit too far out, apparently realising his mistake and making a jump to avoid the incoming wave, but ultimately ends up with his trousers wet up over his knees.  He laughs about it and turns to John, who meets his eyes with a genuine, relaxed grin.  Sherlock gestures for John to come join him.  John declines; he's rather content sitting there, watching Sherlock's striking silhouette against the glittering water.
The realisation is obvious in its simplicity.  "I fell into that trap, even without Moriarty being involved.  I started to believe every clue was directed at me.  I expected him to leave those traces so I could follow."
John finds papery pants at the bottom of the basket, supposed to be worn under the towel during massage for added modesty, but Sherlock scoffs at their ugliness, declaring he’d rather go in the buff.
A crimson streak runs down Sherlock’s face. How could this happen? John tries to squeeze the tear shut with his fingertips, but now it’s starting to bleed profusely. He grabs the back of Sherlock’s head, putting pressure on the wound with the heel of his other hand. It bleeds through John’s fingers, warm and pulsing, an ungodly amount.
The crying catches up, forcefully. He walks briskly down the street, chest burning, turns a corner and doubles over, leaning against a tree. He cries his eyes out for what feels like an eternity.
John used to cycle around here, when he felt the need to get away from home, which happened frequently.
“Of course. I had time to have a walk in Chelmsford after I met with Inspector Baynes. Let myself into the rugby club and found a binder with some very old team photos.”
This morning, John's defences were down, due to lack of sleep.  Now, they're back up again and he's starting to second-guess what he's prepared.  He's rather content though, sitting here, even if he'll soon get a sunburn.  Where the stifling heat of London was constant, here the increasing wind is treacherous, cooling the skin and whirling away the warmth, while the invisible radiation keeps damaging the skin over time.  At this moment, John couldn't care less.  At this moment, with the mesmerising movement of water, the sound of waves ever-changing, yet constant, and his fingers buried in pebbles, John feels as rooted as Sherlock seems.  The only thing he longs for is the courage to lean into him again.  To put his cheek to the sun-warmed fabric of Sherlock's shirt, without the pretence of falling asleep.  To stay there, to be allowed to stay there, feeling the slight movements of Sherlock's breathing.
For that reason, he orders John a new baby carrier, since Rosie has outgrown the previous one by four pounds. John hasn’t noticed that yet, but Sherlock has found that he's less grudging about forgiving other people's lack of observational skills than he used to, especially when it's John. He can see it’s still very practical for John to be able to lull his daughter to sleep on his chest, rocking her while still being able to move about with his hands free. The new one is more accommodating for both of them, allowing John the freedom to carry his daughter for longer periods of time, and flexible enough to also enable him to carry her on his back. It will be excellent on a case. That is, if John will ever agree to bring his daughter along during such activities.
"Fucking fight me, you coward!" he provokes, shouting into John's face, and there's a small gleam of resistance in John’s eyes, though his body is still.
"Jesus, Sherlock," John splutters, flakes of phyllo dough flying.  He grabs his napkin, pressing it to his mouth until he can speak properly.  "I told you, I phoned you as soon as I got out of there to tell you he'd come after you."
"I was convinced there was a professional behind this.  The lack of fingerprints, or any other traces on the letters, guaranteed the anonymity of the sender.  But this-" Sherlock gestures towards the charred remnants of the shed.  "-this tells me that it's an attempted cover-up.  It also tells me that the person behind this isn't quite the type I was envisioning."
"It will express water from the fabric.  Can't hang them if they're too wet; they might lose their shape."
"Ah, right," says Sherlock, in a neutral tone.  "Must feed you up."  To John's relief, he stands up.  "Let's go and have a look at the menu, then."
John's a bit worried.  The Moriarty spin Sherlock put on the case was convincing.  Sherlock was very sure.  But why did he wait until the very last minute to tell John about his suspicions?  Why did he bring the gun?  He must have had it with him from the start of the case; throughout their visit to the crime scene, the interviews with witnesses and even in Brighton.  He'd had it on himself when they were sitting on the beach, the ultimate de-stressor.  If he had it in his coat pocket throughout, then it was there when they kissed for the first time, when John sneaked his arms around Sherlock to grab his arse.  And on the roof, just hours ago, where things got heated.
Sherlock is hungry enough, so John helps unwrap his sarnie.  Sherlock starts in on it while John wrangles the bottle out of the backpack.
The hot room is sweltering. It has marbled walls, benches and floors, and they start to sweat profusely within minutes.
There is something nagging Sherlock's mind, but it's just out of reach.  Only a slight irritation telling him there's something he should pay attention to.
“When I’ve been on and off with Clara, yes. And some after. But at this point in life I’m quite content with living on my own.”
"Susan Cushing.  The lady who wrote to you asking you to take her case.  Something with strange letters."
, however, to sleep on a pull-out in the residence of a woman who owes Sherlock.  What the hell did she do that she owes him?  But, if he can get Sherlock to agree to get out of London, anywhere that will bring a change of scenery, even for just a day, to get a break from the past week's growing insanity, he's actually very keen.
Sherlock crouches down. "The shoelaces are tied from the same angle he would have used if he put them on himself.  Of course, someone could have tied them for him, from that angle, as opposed to being tied from in front of him, like you'd usually would do if helping a small child tie their shoes.  But, the level of thoughtfulness needed to emulate the deceased's tying of shoelaces is statistically very rare when committing a crime.  So, we can reasonably conclude that he put on those shoes by himself."
Sherlock starts to open all the envelopes while John takes diligent notes.  It seems the envelopes have been posted chronologically, the postmarks matching the dates of the content.  No surprising patterns there.
They’re alone with the palm trees again. They find fresh drinks in a stylish designer fridge, and they lay down in their chairs, gulping them down.
“No, you’re not sorry. You’re feeling sorry for yourself, quite the difference. It doesn’t suit you John.”
“Yeah. He made excuses for her, right from the start. And then when I- I went back to Baker Street for awhile. I cared for-” he clears his throat. Now he’s really got himself tangled up.
"That's not what I'm saying, John," Sherlock says patiently.  "My point is, that my assumption, my disregard of what she said about herself at Battersea--"  He notices John gaping and adds, before he has the capacity to form words,  "Yes I was there, and yes, I heard your conversation.  Now, the point is, that I came to the wrong conclusion.  I thought she'd let her heart rule her head, but it eventually transpired that her one mistake was to be herself.  Turned out Molly Hooper was right: 'We all do silly things', and Irene Adler was no exception.  She chose a simple, silly wordplay when constructing her phone password, believing her true silly self was disparate enough from her persona of clever and naughty misbehaviour.  She wasn't lying, as I assumed, though clearly trying to manipulate you, when she told you she was gay.  I was wrong; it wasn't Irene who was '
with a susurration of cellos, everything slows, only to return anew with the dawn.  Such is the cycle of life.  He closes his eyes to hear the bees more clearly, rubbing the shell in his pocket.  He'd thought it would disintegrate with all the fiddling he did last night after dinner.  He'd walked in the dark, through fields and shrubbery on the slope above the cliff's edge, trying to clear his head.  He mulled over different future scenarios of development in his relationship with John, as he watched the passing car lights of the A259 below, and the Marina glimmering in the darkness beyond.
The next song is familiar. One of those almost symphonic ones. He’s tried it out on his violin many years ago, in one of his rare forays into popular music. It has many dynamics, from soft pizzicato to intense arcos.
"And then there were the letters, the cardboard box with Miss Cushing's jewellery and finally the beheaded flowers, which not so incidentally grow on the other side of this hedge."
He’d do better by her, make sure to say those words while he had the chance. Make sure he wouldn’t lose what they had. It was time to finally say goodbye to the spectre that had haunted him for nearly two years.
“There’s no excuse for what I did. I caused a lesion on his left eyebrow, nosebleed, gave him a swollen eye, a broken blood vessel in his sclera, kicked his guts. No excuse.”
"You miss him,” she had said, and it was like a blow, but when the air had gone out of him, he could breathe in again, deep.
"Huh.  It's a shame she's gone," John says, then remembers to add, "To the witness protection thingy."
"Not that it went smoothly.  Last night I had better luck; there were no officers around, and Miss Cushing hadn't come home either. I didn't want to go inside the shed, so I piled up all the jars behind it and stomped down some stems to make a pyre around them.  Once I had managed to set fire to the shed, it felt so good to see it burn, like a big bonfire.  It felt good to know that the place where Brian sat dead for hours wouldn't be anymore.  I stood there crying, watching the flames take hold of the whole shrubbery.  I was planning to call it in, so the fire could be contained, but someone else was faster.  The sound of sirens sent me into a panic.  What would the kids' parents say if I was arrested for arson?  So I fled back in the house, cowardly.  The firefighters knocked on my door to inform me of the fire, and reassured me they had it under control.  In the morning, I went to work like nothing ever happened."  She pats the wrap protecting her braids.  "And you're completely right, I did scorch part of my hair."
Sherlock has a relaxed, dreamy look on his face, the kind he gets just before he collapses after a case. John smiles tentatively and closes his eyes as the therapists douses them with warm, fragrant water. He groans with how good it feels, just on the right side of hot. He opens his eyes again. Sherlock smirks at him.
"The body is about to leave the shed," Sherlock informs him.  "I saw the transport arrive."  He grins.  "Anderson is helping them."
He puts on his coat, but it can’t close around them both. In John’s room, he finds Mary’s long knitted scarf and he grabs it, hurrying to get them both outside. He sets his path towards Regent’s Park.
Sherlock leans into the foliage, close to the bees, to study their work.  They're busy now, before the cold autumn weather hits, not bothered by a nosey human.  They're buzzing all around his head, the ebb and flow of low vibrations, like the gradual crescendo of strings from Philip Glass'
"So, what are you thinking about the possible arsonist?" John asks, because he can see the gears are turning in Sherlock's mind.
"Well, I've used inferior equipment to do operations and succeeded."  John shakes the shaving gel bottle.  "Let's get rid of the couch-sulking beard, shall we?"

He clearly hears the fondness behind the dismissal. And now the giggling overtakes the sobs almost completely, and it reminds Sherlock of a less complicated time. The doorknob twists in his hand and he lets go of it, moves to the side, leaning against the doorframe with a pretend casualty, as John opens the door. Sherlock's eyes begins to sting.
As they traverse the A215, John fills Sherlock in on the correspondence they've had with Susan Cushing.  She'd repeatedly received mysterious envelopes in the mail, containing her own discarded receipts.  It had been going on for some time when she'd contacted Sherlock.  It could have been considered threatening, but she'd stated clearly in her letter that she'd never made any enemies and that there was never any letters accompanying the receipts.  While looking for the notes he took when he'd rang her up, John found another letter from her, unopened.  He hands it to Sherlock now, and after he opens it, they read it together.  Apparently, she wrote again because she'd received something different: a cardboard box containing her own jewellery.
Miss Badu claims to be unaware of anything suspicious happening, as she's teaching all weekdays and often uses noise-cancelling headphones at home since she suffers from tinnitus.
Sherlock squints.  He then puts the phone down on the narrow table between them and starts to ruffle around in his coat pockets.  "John,"  he says with reluctance.  "I'm in need of some assistance."
Sherlock gets a grip on himself, and since his aim is fairly good, he manages to hit the mark, though not straight in the bull's eye, like John.
Sherlock stops speaking, eyes narrowed, one hand left hanging mid-air. This is a sure indication that he’s close to a breakthrough.
The most structured period had, strangely enough, been when Mary was away. When he didn’t know when or if she’d come back, if he would be alone with Rosie forever. He’d learned so much during those weeks. Instant single parenting was an acid test of his ability to care for his daughter.
Indeed, and the better part of it is in Sherlock's pants.  He snorts derisively.  "It's all due to the sympathetic nervous system responding to external stimuli," he sputters, while fighting the urge to close his eyes from the sensation.  "And we've just kissed, so that's only to be expected."
Oddly enough, this time Sherlock doesn't register the moment John wakes up, mainly because he doesn't jerk or clear his throat, or even lean away from him.  The first indication that John is awake is a murmur into the fabric of Sherlock's coat.
"Target practise," Sherlock whispers and winks.  Then he pulls John's SIG-Sauer out of his coat pocket and puts it in John's hand.  John glares daggers at him in the dark, but the weight of the gun in his hand is still comforting.  Sherlock raises his brows in inquiry and John nods silently.  They step out from behind the Japanese knotweed not-hedge, simultaneously, and in one smooth motion John takes aim at the figure standing in Brian James' lot.
John needs a moment to regain his breath.  He's never been a sprinter, more of a marathon runner.  Now, he's probably far from the stamina of his youth, but at least living with Sherlock keeps him on his feet with a certain regularity.
The beauty, the fragility of it all. It’s all too much. He shudders, blinks back tears. Sherlock takes his hands, guides him out.
Unsurprisingly the boy chasing the seagull soon becomes the target of, one can assume, its even larger mother... and its horde of other family members.
John feels a sudden pang of melancholia.  He knows all about a hard as rock outer shell, with a beautiful inside.  If only Sherlock wasn't so hard to crack open.
“Come, Watson! Let’s find something to build us a bee hotel,” he prompts, winking at John and standing up in a flurry. Sherlock’s still wearing his coat. It should be too hot in this weather, but John can’t deny it’s very practical in these situations.
“How would I know you’d want to come to her funeral? You haven’t been in contact with her for what? Fifteen years? Not since Mum passed.”
John squeezes his eyes shut, his whole face contorting. His breath stutters, wheezing, and he turns his face to the side, away from Sherlock.
"I have permission to speak to potential witnesses, though with your inability to register anything even remotely out of the ordinary, I don't know if I should even bother!"
"That's a very tempting idea, but no.  I was thinking of something else.  When we were on the train, approaching Croydon, we passed an allotment area.  And then, I was thinking of those gardening tools, so I texted Sally Donovan again."
"Evidently."  Sherlock glares at his hand, attempting to make a grip although the bandage is restricting the movement, but even such minuscule movement clearly pains him.
"Oh, God.  What did he do to you?  Why didn't you tell me?"  John is predictably upset, but still keeps his voice down, in an admirable attempt to not overstep Majida's generosity by disturbing her customers.
It had worked pretty well until he was accepted into grammar school. He’d been a bright kid, but being bullied for whatever inane reason his bullies had, combined with the way things were at home was just too much, the pressure overwhelming.
When there had been two parents in the house, with Rosie so very small and squealing, it had all been a haze of too little sleep, and what felt like a million ways of trying to ease her cranky tum. They’d had two weeks of relative peace, where she mostly slept and slowly looked less like a scrunched up monkey and more like a tiny hairless human.
John stares. The bricks look identical, the same kind of brick all over as far as he can see. Sherlock lets out a theatrical long-suffering sigh and points at the mortar in-between the bricks. John sees it now; there’s an area, roughly the size of a bin lid where there are white spots on the surface of the bricks. That’s not out of the ordinary. He’s seen thousands of variations of brick surfaces with and without spots, with algae, moss or simple dirt coating the surface.
Sherlock blinks. Blinks hard, as a meaningless protest forms on his lips:  "I- I couldn't know that!  It was too soon!  That's why I brushed you off that first night."
In a way, it was a blessing that John fled from Sherlock's tobacco fumes to his stupid clinic to do boring locum work.  Because otherwise, he might have realised that Sherlock wasn't bored, but actually fretting over the precarious situation with Moriarty.  He's been desperately trying to decipher Moriarty's riddles, figure out what he's up to, without dragging John into it.  Partly to avoid the admonishment he knows will come if John finds out about the visit, but primarily for John's safety.
Dressed in swimming trunks and wrapped in a fluffy towel, John sets out to investigate the first room. He’s carrying his basket kit along as instructed, feeling a bit like he’s having a picnic. There are several hydrotherapy tubs of different sizes lowered into the floor, a cold pool and the entrance door to the sauna. He realises there are designated shelves for the baskets and pegs for the bathrobes right by that door.
"Interesting," Sherlock muses, eyes alight.  "And you believe all these things sent to you are from the same individual?"
It seems impossible for him to become the man Mary had thought he was, the kind of man who he wants to be. What he does for his daughter isn’t enough.
Mr Chamoun had regularly been very willing since Sherlock returned to find John bound for marriage. He was younger than Sherlock, nice looking, well groomed and very well dressed when he wasn’t working. He was kind, polite and openly religious, wearing a cross of gold around his neck, but decidedly not boring to engage with sexually. He was clearly bisexual and, like a majority of the men Sherlock had sought out in his sexually active years, a closeted man with some degree of internalised homophobia.
They don’t see each other ‘in a bit’, since Sherlock heads to Scotland Yard, to go through all the evidence from the case. He’s not at home when John returns with Rosie. They don’t meet in the evening, as John joins his daughter in slumber while putting her to bed. The next day Sherlock is at home, pacing the flat while John has long shifts at the surgery.
Majida takes them in her car, even though they're not far from the station, and drops them off with plenty of time left before departure.
the consequences of blunt trauma to the abdomen. It can be superficial, but it can also be life threatening.
But he’d come to know how it felt to be held by him, know the scent where his collar opened up, know the feeling of Sherlock’s warm breath ghosting over his hair.
John ghosts a kiss over Sherlock's bulge.  Then presses in, openmouthed.  Sherlock can't breathe.  He can feel the heat and moisture of John's breath through the fabric of his trousers.  John looks up again, their eyes meet.  He licks his lips.
"Maybe he'd had enough of the constant banging on pipes.  Tired of running errands like an unpaid servant?"
They have certainly shared a bed before, but not like this.  Not after a day of intense silences, coupled with intimate relaxation.  Not when Sherlock's been experimenting with John's reactions to certain stimuli.  Not when John's evidently prepared himself for
Brian seems to have been an avid reader.  John peruses his bookshelves while Sherlock inspects the small dining table.  "You said more than twelve hours since death?"
And it feels wrong, saying it like this, once again putting Mary between them, and suddenly the words fall out of him, words to make things right.
He’s right in the middle of one of the fears he’s trying to overcome. Even if no-one can see what’s going on, there’s people close by, the lights are on, they’re undressed and touching, and John is awfully sober. Only a bit lightheaded from feeling weightless and warmed up by the bubbling water.
He still occasionally falls asleep on his old bed while putting Rosie to sleep, only to be gently woken by Sherlock when he’s about to go to bed in the early morning hours.
“I-I do have a cup of coffee once in a while,” he tries to smooth it over. He scrabbles in his mind. What on earth were they talking about before his silly embarrassment? Hippies, right!
Ahead of them is a seemingly endless stretch of water.  The sea is calm, though the wind is constant. The waves break like white lace when they reach the shallow waters.  The sound, different from a sandy beach, is soothing, hypnotising.
“I have no idea,” Sherlock shrugs happily. “Could be murder, could be the take from a heist. Which admittedly would be very impractical unless someone wants to save it for future relatives.”
"Believe me Sherlock, that's not what dementia looks like.  I've come across it at the clinic, and this isn't it."
"You needn't worry about that.  I have all the keys in my flat, except when I give mine to Brian, as I said."
He could casually touch women. He could affectionately touch women. His hands would roam the usual paths.
John feels awkward, under Sherlock's scrutiny.  He carries on with his delicate work, trying to seem indifferent.  "You know..."
“What if your judgement is poor? Did you anticipate he would come running back at you, before you went up after him? That he’d try to trip you?”
Sherlock will gladly let Mycroft believe this was his debut. He’s always been careful and discreet, and luckily managed to keep Mycroft out of things like this. He’s overplayed his innocence and ignorance in these matters, to be able to keep a semblance of privacy. He would very much like to keep it that way, and the best way of putting Mycroft off is throwing unnecessary details in his face.
"What will you do until then?  I doubt Donovan will let us in here again.  And, you hate waiting.  I know you'll be pestering Molly about it tomorrow."  John nudges Sherlock's arm with his elbow.  "Let's not do that, this time, yeah?  Let's leave this bloody case and city, just for a day.  And, maybe you'll even figure it out while we're away."
The beach feels endless.  The colour of the sky and the sea start to merge, and it's greyer than ever.  They pass an odd collection of flint statues and a deserted beach volleyball court.  Here, the white stuccoed Regency style buildings rise high up behind them on top of the steep cliff.  Even the bold souls of the naturist beach forgoes to brave the incoming storm.
"I see your point.  You want to be sure any arousal or feelings are genuine," says John, contemplating while kneading Sherlock's arse cheeks.  "But we're not in danger now.  God knows about Moriarty's next move, but there's no imminent threat here.  Nothing to cause an adrenaline spike.  We're not even in the public eye.  We're secluded from view by this bloody shrub.  No-one can hear us over the sound of the sea."  He chuckles a little and shrugs.  "Hell, we're not even deathly allergic to bee stings."
Sherlock seems to be in his element, commenting knowingly on the proceedings, asking about the products being used, while John struggles to stay awake. It’s exactly what John expected. He’s glad he didn’t skimp on this. They leave the barbers’ with baby smooth faces, smelling very nice.
Before he met Sherlock, John didn’t know he wanted it. He can’t remember having urges like these with anyone else. He’s generally been a quick shag, chasing the climax. He’s learnt the hard way, through constant breakups, to become a decent lover, learnt the importance of not leaving it solely to your girlfriend to achieve her own climax.
The craft box is bulky and heavy. He’s afraid he’ll drop it on another passenger if he tries to put it in the overhead compartment, so he pushes it under his seat instead. He’s got a plastic bag on his knees, with a watercolour landscape wrapped in tissue paper and the dusty smelling macrame wall hanging. Maybe he can let it hang outside for a few days, to get the smell out?
He wonders if Sherlock misses him. If he understands why John suddenly has become so busy. If staying clean drives Sherlock mad. If he’s having setbacks.
The sloping lawn is partly overgrown by a two meter high, dense hedge, which obscures the view from their room.  The sun illuminates clusters of thousands of delicate, creamy-white flowers found throughout the foliage. It literally hums with bees. The bamboo-like stems with heart-shaped leaves arch a bit, almost creating a tunnel, adorned with fluffy spikes of flower clusters.  Sherlock steps into the narrow pathway.  It must be a shortcut to the cliffs, which Sherlock missed last night when he was making circles in the garden as dusk was falling, smoking one cigarette after the other.
He doesn't want to leave Sherlock by himself.  Not until they have spoken about it, for real.  He never answered John's plea of being included--it was just a long quiet walk to the restaurant.
Sherlock looks like he belongs on the catwalk. He’s wrapped himself up in several towels, sweeping one over his shoulder with the same air as a Bollywood heroine sweeping the end of her sari in slow motion.
He’d ended up with resignation, had fallen back on familiar ground; soldiered on and done his duties. Smiled when expected, winked when words clogged his throat, and tried to step into ill-fitting boots made for another kind of man.
