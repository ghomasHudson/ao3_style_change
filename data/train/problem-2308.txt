Chin said softly, "I…" she looked at Billy. "Should talk to Sherlock first. A conversation that is long overdue."
"It was so long and fat that when he stuck his Sugar Baby with it the naughty Sugar Baby couldn't take it all in at once." Sherlock's ring finger nudged against John's lips. John obligingly opened his mouth and let it in for a suck. "He cried out, 'Daddy, it's too much.' But his Sugar Daddy knew he could take it because he'd taken it many time before and science is all about repeatability and he was a 'very' good scientist."
"You are amazing. Wonderful. Responsive. Perfect. You've come exactly as I desired. Done exactly as I wanted. Needed." John climbed out of the tub. He waited patiently for Sherlock to get out on pleasure limp legs. Motioned him to sit upon a short wide ebony stool. John had programmed a brush on a tray, not knowing the bounty Sherlock would bring. John groomed his beautiful groaning, purring boy. He brushed his long wavy hair. Taking extra care to rub the bristles of the brush against his scalp. To tell him how brilliant, wonderful, amazing he was. Compliment his blushing cheeks. The delicate curve of his changeable eyes. The base of his neck.
It was true. Sestre had begun his mental training, but he had only merged minds with his father or mother. Only under the guidance of an adult. This wasn't even a carbon based lifeform.
"Not a him. Not a Morg. Not a her. Not an Eymorg." She looked at him dubiously. "Controller can't get sick. Controller is Controller. Controller loses lights maybe. But new Controller. Lots of lights. I have things need moving. Big strong Morg. Move things. Get fed." She looked Washington over. "Maybe get delight."
"That you didn't tell me my in-laws are..." John wasn't sure how quite to sum up the sum of what they were.
"Oh, sorry, um… I can call back." John felt like an idiot.
"Maybe…" John licked his lips. His hands now loose by his hips. "You just need a break." He put his hand on Sherlock's arm. "We could go to the holodeck together. Then I wouldn't need to fuck light."
"You don't know," said Wiglaf, "But how don't you know? You're from the 21st Century and everything."
Sherlock had better figure out how to reverse this.
Lestrade said, "Sh'Alaack, we've prepared everything you asked for. We have a route for you into the palace and a cover identity. Newly captured shen, you'll be assigned as a servitor. There's a replicator on level five that has had the safeties turned off."
A small pale skinned child with wildly curling brown hair ran up the hall and skidded to a halt in front of them. A voice called out, "Stop, Connor. You're going too fast. We don't know what's down there." A voice soon followed by a grown omega, who paused as they saw the two of them. "Apparently, what's down here is you. Who are you? Do you know me? Where we are?" They smiled hopefully.
Sherlock flushed, which indicated that his hearing was just as good as always.
Since the schoolroom had a bathroom with a working sink, John rinsed out his clothes, which were frankly disgusting. He felt a bit of a berk wandering around in just his robe, but it was better than nothing.
John glared at the alpha. "Take me to Sherlock." Then in case yet they were a typically inbred Superior. "Or he will be very annoyed with you," and raised his eyebrows to let them reflect on what that meant.
alignment has made their perspective very clear through several wars. Our current compact is that they are our ancestors too. Just as we are all Breen. Their diversity lends us strength."
Sally did what she could. Let the runners run. Missed a lot of shots.
John emerged in the midst of a warm torrential downpour. It was difficult to see anything through the rain.
Several of the omegas were clustered together, crying. Their scent showing that for now their heat was done with the tinge that meant it would begin again.
"All visitors to Beta Aurigae are carefully monitored. I am in charge of monitoring them and all communications. If she pretended her niece was on world, then it was a kindness I shall see if I can repay. However, given that Prince William," Chin coughed, "Prince Sherlock has not responded in person to our communication that Billy's shuttle did not arrive, given that John was lured to get on the shuttle, and given what my people learned from the Ferengi that bought you in, that makes it likely there something is very amiss on the Bakerstreet."
Sherlock said conversationally, "I'm covered in vendarite dust. Yes, this is Klingon blood mixed in with it. Let's fight."
Victorius sighed. "I'll never be an agent. We have to be princes. It's so boring."
Dionysus murmured. "I see. You have already chosen a different god. Very well." They spread their arms wide. "Maenads, attend your master." The crew turned as if one mindless laughing mass.
A week of research and John was no closer to figuring out what was going on than when he started. So, sitting at dinner with Sherlock, who was ranting about an ongoing conflict on the planet of Neural, and looking absurdly attractive, John blurted out "Let's keep it simple. Tomorrow. Eight hundred hours, come prepared for a day at the beach on Risa," he hadn't intended to say that, and with Sherlock staring at him with those gorgeous changeable eyes, he added, "and bring a horga'hn."
Connor didn't know where to look, so he looked away. This was entirely outside of his experience of his mum. Even when Ms. Yao had come over to dinner most nights in the months before she left, she had sat across the table from Mummy with Connor between them.
Sherlock's scent was almost unbearably rich there in the dappled thicket deep in the woods.
Felt as if every barrier melted away the longer he looked.
"Captain tranquilized your body with enough tranquilizer to take down thirty Gorn," said Julian. He pulled a med kit down from the wall administered stimulants to the crew. At least he was starting with the security and engineering staff, Sherlock was happy to see.
Robin Hood fantasy
"But it could be anywhere," said Snow Sparkles.
"We wouldn't be together on the same ship," said John. "I want to have mad adventures with you. Not," he forced out the words, "be some sort of a captain."
He heard, "He's enormous." "When did he get so big?" "How many do you think he's having?" "Shut the fucking fuck up!"
Look at around minute 3:06
It was a good warning to know that this level was watched.
Just in case Sherlock failed.
"And I had some old friends to visit," said Dax easily.
They put on a skit about the legend of when Thasilar of Andor worked with members of a rival clan, racing across the ice, to bring medicine to a village stricken with fever. His Father, as Thasilar, gave an incredible performance. His willingness to do whatever it took to help was palpable. His mother equally amazing as she buried her ice hatchet for the common good.
"Mr. Wilkes," said Doctor Culverton.
Mollyhoo stood over an alpha, pocked with wounds. Toby's muzzle red with the alpha's blood. "Look out!"
Promised herself that she'd put one out every day the ship wasn't actively in a firefight.
"We were artists. Journalists," said Marida. "Do you want us to write cutting articles about their sartorial style? How about a series of sculptures I could call it gender politics? Maybe sing a song?"
Mollyhoo darted over to the knife on the ground. She looked around the cave to where the last few omegas to still be expressing an active estrus cycle were moving restlessly. This round triggered based on the alpha pheromones in the chamber and aroused by the fight, but not ready to make a move. She ran the stone knife across the flame and sliced Ayaba's arm, repeated the steps with Fasha while Ayaba was still protesting. Mollyhoo said, "It's important before one of you, and only one of you, has sex with Sherlock," and they both quieted.
"Why's it called Twins, Papa Ishros?" asked his little sister, Shrilaas, even though she perfectly well knew. They all knew. Ugh.
John even spotted Garak.
Soo-Lin pulled back briefly. She looked sad. Soo-Lin leaned forward and kissed Mum. It was…
Killander slammed his hands down flat on the table top. "Stop lying to me." He tapped his com. Another man came in with a sheet of thin cloth and a pitcher of water.
There was an aggrieved sigh over the com. "That's what you think." Which really didn't help.
"Then you will need to wait to talk to Billy," said Sherlock who did not have the patience for this. Not now that John was finally near him again. Now that John's hand was in his. The oils his body were producing as a result of things Sherlock shied away from thinking about adding additional comfort to the comfort John's presence always brought. He said, "Do something useful and imprison these Ferengi for kidnapping, trafficking in sentient beings, and attempted murder based on intergalactic statute. Round up the Klingons who are high on sex pollen while you're at it."
When they reached John's regular bed time, they looked at each other awkwardly.
Sherlock blushed and examined the intricate floor, "No. No. While Mummy was away I invented something that will enable us to avoid… consequences." He looked at the teens, "We love you. We do. Mummy too no matter what I said before." He took John's hand and kissed it. "I know I've said this before, but this time it will absolutely work. We won't even share coitus." He placed his other hand on his heart. "I promise."
"Lieutenant Palmer, you are insubordinate!" said Captain Killander.
"If you observe anything out of place, don't hesitate to contact the Bakerstreet. Even if you haven't seen your sister yet. Go back to the shuttle."
He was more than a bit surprised to have Sh'Alaack come in holding her flabbjellah. He nodded and went into his office. She followed him. He made tea, because his mother had always told him to make tea if he wasn't sure what to do next.
With the ease of long practice, Shroleb said, "While I blame their Aunt Harry." He slanted Bihr a glance.
Owen looked at Khatri and Lui. "I don't like the idea of you having to ride herd on a bunch of muck it up crew who don't know anything about our girl. She's tetchy. Requires care from people who love her." He patted the tertiary controls for the core infusion.
Sherlock only had time to snort, before Donovan said, "The fucking hell. You're not fucking gods and we don't want to live a life of ease. We've been given a fucking mission. Release our ship."
He'd kind of hoped they'd pick up on the not drinking the questionable wine part.
Sherlock glared his own turnips, which John had to admit hadn't been the best idea. "It never interested me until you." He was blushing. Glaring and blushing and his lower lip was just that little bit extended in a proto-pout.
She shook her head. There were injuries to deal with. While Marymor's injury was more severe, she was already getting care from half the omegas and then some. It wasn't as if they hadn't had some good examples for how to set a break since they'd arrived in the past.
She was the blood that remained.
Nearly three times the losses of the battle of Wolf 359.
She went to her lab. Was slightly shorter, but she could replicate a stool. She had to assemble it. The replicator in her lab was one of the smaller models, but she could use a screwdriver. She wasn't useless.
It was a certain something that Sherlock had going on downstairs too. Because he'd done something to heal John's reproductive system. Because fallopian tubes that had been sealed didn't grow back on their own. Even down to repairing the scarring. It was as if it had never happened.
Power.
John groaned as he pushed down. Just the tip of John's cock pressed up inside Sherlock's body. A tease. A taste. Sherlock threw his head back. Exposed. Vulnerable to the one he most wanted to see him. Love him. Need him. Learn who he was and never want to leave him. "You pushed me down on the couch and you had your wicked," he pushed down, air struggling in his lungs at the feel of John cock filling the ache, enormous, slightly painful and yet wonderful, "wicked, wicked way with me." He needed more. "You despoiled me. Spoiled me for anyone but you."
John's power wasn’t about his height. It was in the way he walked. Legs slightly parted. One of Mr. Garak's bespoke suits as perfect as a suit of armor. A power suit. Powerful.
"Who is Victor?" He had a suspicion, but he needed confirmation.
John scratched the hair behind his ears. "Sherlock loves John."
"You don't think that…" Chin glanced at Billy, "our new ally has perhaps misunderstood my parents' objectives."
"Of whether I'm going to, as you so quaintly put it, fuck you or not? Oh, that will happen," drawled Victor.
Bailey said, "It was as if he took an urban myth about Augments being sold into sexual slavery by pick your alien race, and then turned it into some sort of Augment plot. It was bizarre."
He even had a conversation with Odo before he talked to Sherlock. Because if there was a being intent on a mystery – other than Sherlock – it was Odo. John said, "Sherlock's secret isn't all that complicated. He joined Starfleet at age fifteen."
She did wonder if anyone had told Harry that her twin was now not a twin. Looking at her own sets of twins, different in each their own ways, she resolved that if it they were unable to resolve this issue, she would make sure that Doctor Watson contacted her.
The omega bared his neck. "Check to see if your teeth marks match the scar on my neck."
"Get away from the controls," yelled the first voice. "I do not know who any of you are, but it would be illogical to trust you under the circumstances." Followed by a blast that burned through the silk of his trousers. He gritted his teeth at the pain of third degree burns. He hooked an arm around the rung of the ladder. There was a small device attached to the external controls. Based on what he'd read, that was not part of the deflector array controls.
"Oh, my goodness no," said Frankland smiling jovially at John. "We're a modern facility. We allow our guests to roam freely about the rehabilitation level. We encourage them to perform simple tasks, explore their artistic side, provided they keep up with their treatments. Oh, ho, that's a key component to our success here."
Killander glared at Sisko. “I thought we had agreed to keep the nature of the charges a secret.”
Connor couldn't any of that.
Alignment rambling."
"Or," said an unfamiliar voice, "You could follow me." John turned to see a tall handsome silver haired alpha in his early sixties. He was blinking tears back from his blue eyes. "I never thought I would be so fortunate as to be reunited with three grandchildren in one day. I never thought to see one of my sweet Dora's children and his son."
"Oh, uh…" John needed to stop this line of conversation. It could only go to a bad place. "I believe you. You absolutely do not need to prove to me that Sherlock and I are meant for each other." After a pause. "It's our anniversary tomorrow and we're going to celebrate. Lovingly. Proving our love for each other."
But fairly relevant for my thinking for both this story and really the whole Breen plotline:
They went into a connecting chamber. Some form of bathing room. There was a small basin. The omega removed their uniform with no hint of shyness. In fact gave him a saucy wink before rinsing them in a basin.
John had a choice. He could press back. Sherlock already knew from the shift in his breathing that he was awake. Or he could drift back to sleep.
"Err…" said John, since the last time he'd seen Trelane, he'd acted like he thought kissing caused plague. "Since when do you worry about if someone likes you?"
It got a bit blurry after that. John woke up in their cottage and made use of a toilet, a hangover cure, a mint, and a good snog with Sherlock.
John didn't protest that he had actually rinsed them already. Instead he asked the billion credit question, "What happened?"
"Okay, got atmo, let's travel," said John, whose grip on his chair was getting increasingly white knuckled.
"I was thinking the same thing."
Given Mycroft's presence at the time, he felt compelled to say, "Technically I had already freed myself from my shackles and was in the process of escaping on my own."
There was another round of nutrients and liquid.
John looked up. "It would be on the third shelf." He and Bashir climbed up the ladder to the first cryo chamber. There was a hiss as they opened it. The whine of medical tricorders. "There's something in here."
"Sod off," was the only reasonable response.
"Unless Sherlock fucked us better," said Sarabeth, and got a punch in the arm from Mollyhoo. "I see being pregnant makes you aggressive." She lowered her voice. "I like it. Honey, I know you're a fundamentalist and you always followed the direction of your matriarch, but you are your own matriarch now. We can do this. We’ve been doing this. And I want… yeah. Let's do this. And if... if this isn’t something you want, we'll figure that out."
"Mycroft was," Sherlock put on a smile, "correct."
This situation could not continue as it was, and yet it was probable that the only cure for unexpected youth was time.
"I don't particularly want to become a cave man," whispered John. "I always preferred space person to cave person."
"Maybe I can help," said John. "I'm a doctor. Maybe the Controller is sick. Take to me to him."
"That," Mollyhoo considered the situation from every angle. It wasn't ideal. John, as the only omega from his crèche was therefore his own matriarch, and wasn't that an odd idea. A matriarch that was still having active estrus cycles. Then again the things John and Sherlock said were often very strange and made no sense, but, "it could work. With proximity to alpha pheromones and the periodic exposure to alpha hormones in semen, proper vaginal stimulation through distension of the posterior vagina, which we could use some of the bladders to trigger a pseudo ovular response since there's so many of us and only one alpha, that would shorten the estrus cycle, and lengthen the periods between estrus. During estrus our instinct will be to…"
While all the while, John questioned everything he'd ever known.
Hudson ran an analysis on the scans while Sherlock waited impatiently. "All the cities are in ruins. Based on the level of decay, for at least four hundred years. I'm also getting some Human life signs. Not more than a hundred thousand scattered around the planet." She tapped a control and the monitor updated with a pale green marker. "The greatest concentration is here, which if this were Earth, it would be White Sands New Mexico."
Alexis almost asked about Dionysus, but something in Apollo's expression, in years of relationships that had ended with Alexis most precious belongings set on fire or smashed, they held back the words. A trend to the data that had them return a god's kiss, which turned into further embraces.
He stepped away and held the tricorder to provide light as the final light in the sphere dimmed.
Sherlock might not have swept him into an embrace in front of everyone, bending his face into his neck, pressed frantic kisses over John's face, while saying, "Missed you. Missed you. Missed you. Lost without you. I've been so lonely. Why did you go? I know why. You were angry with me. Stupid question. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. But you're here now. Never going to let you go." More velvet octopus squeeze. "I'll take such good care of you. How could you leave me? You knew how much I needed you."
First Father stood between them. "They are all our children."
She frowned unhappily. "Come home and Mummy will tell you."
"Well, that's…" Snow swirled in the wind over them. Dry and light. "Bad." John shivered in the cold. "We have to get inside before our core body temperature drops further."
"Maybe that's why they're having so much sex," said Marida. "I just thought they were…" he shrugged, "it had something to do with the time dilation. But maybe Sherlock's… I don't know… keeping him healthy with his magic cock."
Mycroft smiled.
Martha looked at her. If she had her telepathy, she could have read Donovan's thoughts. Would have known precisely how to turn the discussion the way it needed to go. "I know that I am competent. Therefore I have no intention of doing so. Dismissed."
Mollyhoo grimaced from the bed of woven grass and furs. She tugged frantically on her cock. "Please, John, tell him it's okay. You know he won't do anything otherwise."
Warning: This scene involves references to times in the past Billy was tortured by Colonel Green's men, and some current waterboarding.
From the way Frankland crumpled, Bihr knew he was dead.
When they stopped in sickbay, he left his parents in Julian's capable hands with an agreement to meet later.
"That's not Sherlock," said John.
This was not the conversation he wanted to have. "No. I… can't yet."
But when he arrived in the holodeck, John wasn't in the midst of flirting with this or that hologram. He wasn't wearing some exceedingly skimpy garment that revealed significant portions of his skin.
A woman she'd tried to kill once upon a time. It had been so important. So critical. Vital to saving her father. Who'd shown her in the most definite way that wasn't what he would have wanted.
John let it be known that he'd be keeping open office hours for the next few days, no questions asked if anyone wanted to come in for an after heat pill or a day after pill. No records would be kept. An offer Julian couldn't make by his very nature.
Billy was huddled on a bunk with Connor tucked under his arm like a mama bird.
Sherlock had been hoping that he was going to impale the alpha with it, but to Sherlock's disgust, he lowered the pole into the pit and called out. "Come on, Marymor. Come on out of there."
John is talking about hormones that are produced in teens that are part of development.
Garak removed the tape from around Sherlock's neck and measured the breadth of Sherlock's shoulders. "I may have heard a rumor that Starfleet has misplaced some very historical prisoners they had in cryo storage and they suspect that an Augment helped liberate them." Garak measured the height of Sherlock's torso. "An interesting period in human history, the Eugenics Wars, and their subsequent dabble in Augmented Warcraft. I had reason to look up both when I met the good Doctor Bashir. What a dangerous weapon to have lost, don't you think?"
A small fire burned near the entrance. Both for warmth and a deterrent to predators given its placement.
As she'd walked down the hall, she'd wanted people to see how fun it was to be a teenager.
"It contains parameters for a plaque listing your many accomplishments on board this ship. Now that you have received a commission as a Lieutenant and will be building ships at the Tri-Rho Nautica shipyards, I wish those who will serve with you to understand your depth of knowledge. I would have replicated it, but this will travel better."
Sherlock had been right. All John needed was an adventure. Now Sherlock simply needed to ensure John didn't learn anything that would make him leave Sherlock.
Mummy's eyes flickered from Mycroft to William. The lights over the bio-bed blinking.
Connor exhaled, while Billy held his breath. Connor didn't say anything, looking as pale and sweaty as he had before the hypo injection.
He glared at Harry. "You tried to hurt Mama Bihr. I'm going to challenge you when I'm older."
"Acted like a virus," said blue hair angrily.
She was going to take one look and know. Dad, he couldn't be sure, but Mum would know.
His belly felt like it was full of those worms they'd learned about in school.
For the first time since John had met her, she didn’t sound apologetic.
More and more Breen removed their helmets. Exclaimed about how this was the moment that the future had told them to wait for.
Now. Future was now.
Ordinarily, Martha would have known what they were without Lucy telling her. Lucy would have practically shouted the thought. Instead she had to wait for Lucy to hand her a bottle and tell her what was in it. "Oil from the leaves of the Lethe plant."
Khatri indicated that Killander had thought that Khatri's age was incorrect in her official Starfleet record until she was sitting in front of him. She had, however, come prepared with references from her former university connections, her grandson, and many cousins on Earth. A benefit of being one of the last to be questioned.
John promised himself that he really would have a real conversation with Sherlock as soon as they were back home on the Bakerstreet, which was going to rendezvous with them at DS9.
Donovan came in. Sherlock was aware that she often could not sleep. Hudson's jibber jabber was that she felt displaced in this century. A subject Sherlock was more than happy not to discuss.
Hudson as always said, "You know my standard pick, dear. Please add it."
"And the void looks back into us," said Karidian, who walked out into the middle of the room.
His mum sighed. "Sweetheart, your father joined a travelling theater troop that encountered hundreds of thousands of people over decades. Put his face on advertisements plastered on hundreds of worlds. If he wanted to hide, he could have swept floors in some remote colony where no one goes. When we met, I thought he was running from something painful, but now knowing, I wonder what if he wanted to caught. I don't know what friend helped him on the Enterprise, but what if they wanted to absolve that life out of pity and all he wanted was to be called to account. Heavy is the head that wears the crown. What if I had simply asked him while we were on the Bakerstreeet? After that Andorian woman was injured?" Her left hand, the one that always reached for Dad's curled around her tea cup. "Would he be sitting next to me now? Playwright, write that."
John rubbed the side of his face. A baby rattlesnake. In the past, when he'd ovulated, it had been one at a time. Hell, since he'd started nuking his ovaries every day, when the universe decided to fuck with his suppressants, he'd managed to keep the accidents down to a reasonable two or three. This time, it had felt like an explosion every single fucking time, and he and Sherlock had fucked non-stop for three fucking days. He had a feeling that he and Sherlock had gone for a new high order magnitude number of fertilized cytoblasts currently floating their merry fucking way down his fallopian tubes to his uterus.
"My operational design hasn't really been very helpful to you over the years." He said ruefully. Almost as if he were a real person.
It was annoying. Generally Hudson wasn't so self focused. Not when people around her were this close to giving into panic. "Do you have any idea what could have caused this?" Lucy felt desperate. Even the plants that she'd been holding had regressed to seedlings.
Hobb licked his lips. "I do believe our initial proposal was for the fusion generator to be included as part of the initial ten year lease.
"Wouldn't a scanner be more efficient?" Sherlock had very little idea about how clothing was made, but a physical device had to be inefficient.
Hudson said, "Birds are in their nest. Head to first position." John gave himself an anti-nausea shot, which was a relief. Grabbed some real medical tricorders – children's toys only went to so far – and as many biomasks as he could fit in a rucksack from the emergency stash. Things they hadn't been able to carry between levels.
Sherlock had been smarter.
Blue hair, immune to the moods of the crowd said, "And the 6
And Sherlock, he really was unexpected for an alpha. An attitude Sarabeth kept chiding her over, but really he was. Obviously, his matriarch had done a wonderful job home schooling him, because one evening John had made some off-hand remark about something called a Molotov cocktail, Sherlock had leapt up, called John his shining light, snatched up the candlestick and ran off.
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fetal-cells-microchimerism/
It was relatively simple to lower the unit. The promenade was empty. Still dark. Whatever was affecting the power hadn't been fixed. There were several hundred round rocks on the storage unit.
She grimaced. "Maybe. I was very young." Her pink rimmed eyes narrowed. "I'd know his scent. I dream about it sometimes, smothering me." She swallowed. "He was an Augment. An alpha. I don't hold it against Humans though. He's dead!" Her heart rate increased again. "He has to be dead. Everyone told me that that monster was dead." She picked up the spanner and held it in a pale knuckled grip.
His scent shifted to a slightly sour note.
The cost in time was high. The Bakerstreet had made little progress tunneling their way through the solid rock of the structure, which was miles below the surface. There were thousands of possible areas to search for the central location of his consciousness. For the interface where it had been injected into this facility. Based on the sound of his body's heartbeat through the com on his chest, his biological body was failing despite John's best efforts.
Yao said only, "The scope of their questioning can only grow if we do not cut it off."
"A likely story," yelled Protector.
"One day, our parents came to get us. They told us we were lucky. We'd been selected to be cryo-frozen, but that sounded cold to me. So, I refused. I ran away deeper into the woods to hide. I somehow thought that I was going to find something to eat, but I was just a child. When I came back, they had left all of our remaining supplies in the shelter and a note that they loved me. To not to eat too quickly, because what I had would need to last for several weeks. It was so lonely there all alone. I went down to the main plaza."
Sherlock wasn't asleep. He was examining John's framed posters of the Watson troupe productions. Watsons present Hamlet. Watsons present the Logical Epigrams – Surak – a Life. Watsons sing the song of Thasilar the Last.
John and Sherlock both had appointments on the same day. They beamed into headquarters together, but were quickly routed in different directions. John told himself no matter what he had another week with Sherlock. No need to panic just yet.
Sherlock was not logical and reasonable about John. Which was why he'd ended up hacking the unpurged backups for the summer palace on the Breen homeworld when John sent him away on that fateful day.
Sherlock grinned and he winked at John.
Culverton said, with a wrinkle of his nose, "Delete the last ten minutes of memory. In fact, delete the program. He was annoying anyway."
Ishros held her and Shroleb kissed her cheek while she remembered her parents. Placed a drop of blood in a glass of water. Carried it to the altar they had erected in their quarters. She said, "Uzaveh the Infinite watch over them," and tried to believe it.
Frankly, it had always made Bihr's antennae twitch.
A lifetime of hiding.
Except when she visited Harry in the brig.
She couldn't get enough of a signal to communicate with Watson, but she could locate his position. She ran by empty rooms until she came to a wide open room.
(See the end of the chapter for
John didn't want to lose track of Euros, so he waved at the opening and did the sort of little bow that drew giggles from the children on the Bakerstreet. "After her Majesty," he pointed up at the crystals dripping off the chandelier, "after all, that looks like a magic crystal. Which makes you the Ice Queen and that's your treasure." Her dress was more than a bit like Queen Elsa's from that old classic Disney movie.
Actually, Moriarty had a sentimental attachment to that name. The first solid he'd killed in the Alpha Quadrant. Well, after he'd known what he was.
"Good. Keep me posted. If you contact Watson, tell him to keep his head down. The prince running this part of this fucking freakshow is hot for his arse."
He filtered out many contaminants through his filtration units. Unit A34 through B93 needed cleaning. He flexed mechanical arms – 456 to 460. They existed to manipulate the devices and filters. He had arms in all the key systems rooms. But no voice.
"I…" said John, "think I'd like to put some clothes on and be taken to Sherlock."
Only to find Sherlock squeeze his hand while on stage, Benedick kissed Beatrice's hand, and headed off the final scenes of the play.
Also, worth seeing the Andorian representative on the Federation Council and twenty of their staff glowering at Captain Killander, while he stumbled his way through an apology for abrogating the rights of citizens who had made such a great contribution to Federation society.
"Eva," said Lucy. "Why don't you finish telling Doctor Watson your story later? You both need a nap."
That was when Thil put something together. He couldn't believe he'd never noticed it before. He leaned in close to Shor. "Did you hear Papa Ishros?"
Bashir said, "Did you loop the feed?"
Also, I too lost to the tic tac toe playing chicken.
He was looking at John just like Sherlock would.
John looked at the camera directly above him. "Because you got nothing out of that? And don't think I don't know you practiced with the hose things before trying them on me." He waved an arm at the pile of small bolts where Sherlock had practiced with the pseudopods to get the pressure right.
"Did you get your orders?" He didn't to talk about his own just yet.
Chin's expression didn't change. "I'll tell our parents. But they didn't listen to be me before either." She said hesitantly, "Anything else?"
Dionysus' smile was wild and feral. "I am not the god who sees the future. If I were, I wouldn't drain each cup its dregs. Knowing tomorrow's price. Now drink my children, drink, or I'll think you're rejecting my hospitality." Lightening crackled in the sky. Dionysus grew fainter. Now only a head and a cup."
– about a course of medical treatment for Sebastian Wilkes.
But her mom just smiled as if Eva was just a kid. "It's not that simple."
"I've read the file on Khan," said Sisko. "I could list a dozen governments who would want access to his skill sets including, apparently, our own."
In a comparison with his own genetics, Sherlock's SNPs showed a significant number of variations in some really interesting places.
"There's a panel that's is out of order in the corridor outside of Doctor Watson's quarters. Put it on your schedule to repair it."
John growled softly and Sherlock left the other omegas to their stupidity. John leaned back against Sherlock. Sherlock rumbled and pulled John closer. Glaring at the alpha while rubbing his hands over the firm round curve of John's belly. Tenderly pressing his lips to John's neck where he'd made his marks so long ago.
Not casually fornicating in the holodeck.
"I'm not paying you for honor. I'm paying your for muscle," said the daimon. "Ah, I have it. Nom you watch the children, while the Klingons I'm paying to do as I say take the omega over to Profit's Aspiration and the Andorian to the planet."
Since the bag had a small short term anti-grav unit, Mr. Stonn handed the bag to Sestre, who appeared to have already forgotten all about Connor's mummy now that he had a bag of rocks. "Thank you, Father." Sestre pulled the sphere out of the bag and looked at it wonderingly.
"Lovely." John plucked the Horga'hn from Sherlock's grip and put it on a side table. He tugged Sherlock to his feet and led him to a cabana woven with rioting flower. Sherlock thought abstractly that the holodeck was doing an excellent job implementing his improvements for floral scents before John pushed him gently back onto the low wide bed in the cabana, and lay down next to him.
Moriarty left the room. Julian didn't appear. No further crew came into the room. Wilkes didn't come in either. Eventually, the alert stopped. Only to be followed by music softly playing from the loudspeakers. Violin music. Sherlock's Watson concerto.
John swallowed. He was going to say no.
Facts. Sherlock wanted facts and what he had were opinions. Conjecture.
"Right," said Mollyhoo. "Right."
"No, Doctor, what did he do?" said Lethe in soft voice.
He looked in the box. There were a variety of dildos, anal beads, ampules of lube, and cock rings inside.
"Sure." John took the drink dubiously, but it was good. He looked at Sherlock, who was looking impossibly tall and wonderful. Likewise eyeing his drink. With Sherlock's metabolism, he could drink them all under the table. John decided to pace his drinking. It wouldn't do to blurt out any sort of declarations while under the influence, while Sherlock was stone cold sober.
But when Connor lay back, no longer straining against the force bonds and said, "Mum. How are my friends? Could you tell them I'm feeling better? I don't want them to worry if they don't have to worry," Billy knew he could let go just a little.
"What?" Chin looked as disturbed as John felt.
Sherlock had Tregennis beam him down to a small relay station some forty kilometers from the colony and associated asylum. He should easily be able to carry out his research before John was ready to return to the ship on the shuttle, and if there were any issues, John had a phaser and was well equipped to take care of himself.
Not-Sherlock nodded. "Yes, yes. I just… Always a mistake to forecast might have beens. Probabilities, but Trois Primus, I depend on you to be…you're all that I have left of them. Do you understand? I can't lose any more of you."
"But you're not here to visit me, are you? Oh, no. You're here to see your dear sibling, Harry. Took me aback a moment when I first saw your picture. That I said to myself is the very picture of Harry Watson. That is just what I said."
"I would have put it differently," said Julian.
"Auntie Khatri," said Connor. "Could you show me how to knit." He held his hands out for the knitting needles. An old woman past her best speed and strength. A child who had yet to gain his.
Julian was treating Khel for some form of infection.
A tinge of red entered the waves of blue.
Trois Primus was looking desperate.
He sighed. Anytime a joke had to be explained, it was a dead joke. Unless Sestre was there and somehow that made it triple funny.
John was glad Khatri was on hand to organize the baby showers. He couldn't have. Hadn't even known how much he'd been hoping until there wasn't something to hope for.
The alpha insisted that he help them select an outfit. "Something you'll find attractive." They looked down almost shyly. It was funny. The alpha was taller, but when they looked down like that, he felt ten feet tall.
"Exactly like." The lift stopped. Billy stood up. "I'll see you later, John."
This is a list of characters who are referenced and appear in this story.
"Doctor Watson is always up to the task," said Martha firmly. It seemed to have been the right thing to say. But after weeks of paying attention, blind to everyone's thoughts, it appeared she'd rediscovered the knack for saying the right thing, because John nodded, looking very fierce.
There was a non-zero chance of dying that every omega faced when pregnant. The statistics that she was thinking about were for the future. Where there were hospitals. Even there, the Breenava had a higher chance of dying during pregnancy than the Fenisals. Although that was probably because of access to medical care, but this was a cave so minimum health care.
Stonn nodded wearily and communicated with the larger Horta, who hissed, but didn't react in a deadly way as John scanned the Horta. John laid careful trowels of the grey thermal concrete while kneeling in the glass beads of the smaller Horta's tears.
Because it wasn't real. They were all mistaken.
Behind them, the Atavachron popped and showered sparks. Trelane shrugged. "It was an antique and in all fairness I'm the reason it didn't do that while you were travelling through it. He grinned. "Subtlety is my middle name."
It was terrible.
As she rang the bell on Freddy's quarters, she suddenly realized that she hadn't even called ahead. The door slid open.
"Ah," said Sherlock. He put down his own knife. Rearranged the onions on his cutting board. "Yes. Your father. 4000 people dead."
He went to Billy's quarters after shift was over.
John grew more and more tired. Small wonder given the restless drumming inside him. Devouring his body with mass.
She looked at both of them. "Uh… Captain, are you aware that you're wearing pj's?"
There wasn't anything about Lucy in the thread other than her post about what had happened.
Sherlock gave him an indignant sniff. "I do not have the ability to see through solid objects."
Owen said with an evil grin, "I know exactly where to put this pollen in the air filtration system to get the whole ship. The Klingons will be more relaxed than they've ever been."
"I'm working," said Sebastian, continuing to type up his findings. His correlations. He was going to open everyone's eyes.
"I am more interested in the geologic value of the item," said Mr. Stonn. "What is its composition?"
"Hey, there. Easy." John resumed carding his fingers through Sherlock's hair. Sherlock melted into his touch. Time, if that was an accurate term given the location, passed.
Bihr had no idea how Donovan could speak with such disrespect about the Captain, or why the Captain allowed it.
Flat out nothing. The man who'd taught John to pity a magic pig for dying every night to produce food for its master wasn't the kind of man who could have killed thousands of people.
"I know." Mollyhoo sighed. "It was so nice while Sherlock and John were still unreverted to talk about science and medicine again." She looked at Sherlock sadly. "It's been weeks since Sherlock called anyone an idiot."
There was a high pitched beeping noise. John grabbed his hand. "Sherlock, we've got to go." He pulled him forward. They were approximately one hundred meters away when the fusion unit exploded, lifting them off their feet and throwing them another thirty meters forward.
John groaned. "Ugh don't remind me. He kept pinging me a few years ago." They talked about people they knew. They got to know each other a bit.
John insisted they had to try them on. Sherlock looked amazing in a black pinstripe suit that made his coloring even more striking. Made him look even taller. His shoulders wider. Beautiful. John's heart squeezed. He had to focus on fastening the buttons of his suit. When he finished, the suit did make him feel a fitting partner for Sherlock in a light blue plaid.
“Who?” Brittanus feigned shortness of breath, as the feeling in their limbs came back. A question. A ruse for time to gather strength.
If he and John could not travel back in time through the Breen time machine to assist the children he'd left behind, Sherlock would find another way. John rubbed his shoulder affectionately. Sherlock did not need to look to know that John's face was full of affection.
"Nothing. I just… for a moment this location appeared to be familiar." He looked around him. No sense of strange memories here, and really it was nothing he wanted to discuss just then.
"Oh," John's head fell back on the pillow. He felt his own body with his hands. It seemed very much like he normally kept it, which was an odd thing to do. He said very slowly, "How long have I been here? And where's my husband, Sherlock?"
"Harry," hissed Clara. "You're pissed."
John did the first thing he could think of. He lied. Loudly. Grandly and somewhat nauseously. "It's true. Please, you can't tell anyone. It's just, there was this very wealthy merchant when we made port on Maralonia. And he offered me ten bars of gold pressed latinum if I would gestate his children. Ten bars for nine months work. If you can call it working. Sitting around. No danger of dying at all." He waved his hand palm down in front of his chest. "I haven't told my father. I don't want to cut him in on the money. I thought I could conceal my condition."
Which was fine. His ankles weren't swelling while carrying a load of summer cut grass on his back like… John didn't remember what it was like, but for some reason that thing involved someone old carrying grass on their bark and someone handsome offering to carry the load. Sherlock had his own load.
John could feel his own tears forming.
Sherlock didn't look at him so he could imagine John was already himself. "Fortunate, as I love you." They opened the panel that would allow them to manually open the door and headed in separate directions.
Veema laughed nervously. "As a doctor, oh," they clutched armored hands together, "You are a doctor as I am, an unexpected alignment." At Pavan's cleared throat, Veema unlatched thier hands. "As a doctor, you know that it is not possible to trace inheritance genetically through the first twenty-two chromosomes past a few generations because of the sheer number of recombinations that are possible when gametes are produced through meiosis and then the pared homologous chromosomes separate. Why a single couple could have over 8 million possible genetic combinations and that's not even getting into when the genes between the two partners swap during the process of ummm…" they blushed again, "sexual and of course in vitro reproduction."
It was that horrible trolley problem he'd had to study in Medical Ethics class back at the academy. It was worse than the Kobayashi Maru test in a way. The professor has started them in the classic scenario. A trolley was bearing down on a family standing on the tracks. The conductor could change to a different track, but there was a single person standing on the other track. Either way, someone was going to die.
Sherlock pushed aside the grate and jumped down through the fragrant brush. Finney grunted and lowered himself down more slowly. Finney muttered, "You'll miss your hips when they're gone. When you can't be leaping about like a tick."
John crossed his arms. "I don't know, sir. It's nothing."
Imprid's eyes flicked to something above Billy's shoulder. "Provided you come back in the morning. We will need to closely monitor Connor's condition. He's been through a great deal and we need to understand the effects of the therapy." His smile was insincere.
Chin said, "I'm Chin Singh. We're all the children of the great Khans."
He was marrying John who loved him.
Sherlock examined previous missions in the last three months, only to find Hudson shaking him.
The Maralonian's understanding of medicine was completely outside of anything that John had learned through Starfleet. Full of new methods for treatment. Still, as mind expanding as that had been, he told Hudson, "It'll be good to get back to the Bakerstreet."
"Lovely," said Sherlock.
John clenched and unclenched his hand. Feeling the phaser in his hand. It had felt hot as he'd raised it to shoot Sh'Alaack and killed their father instead. As if the heat suffusing their father was going into his own hand.
Killander pushed the tablet across the desk. Along with the stylus. "A location and which theory is correct, and you'll retain your commission. Get me a genetic sample from your time traveler that will allow me to demonstrate that Khan and his followers weren't the bodies destroyed in those chambers, and a good deal of the black marks on your records can be made to… disappear."
Sherlock appeared have the same plan, because he didn't repeat it.
"My girlfriend gave that to me. Chin Singh works for the Breen. That's where she got it. Her employers." He squeezed his eyes to squeeze at the water clinging to the edges. "Shouldn't she have taken it from them?"
He had a face mask.
Of course not.
Sherlock stood back. It was good to see John talking about his obsession with hand made things.
She serenely felt Donovan skulk back to her station. There was still plenty to do. The Breen were claiming the planet for mineral rights based on their treaty with the Federation, but the Federation couldn't just let them turn the Ferengi and Klingon prisoners into slave labor. But the Bakerstreet was certainly not equipped to handle them either. There would be a good deal of discussion until the relevant authorities arrived.
Sherlock took in a deep breath.
Sometimes, Sherlock thought that that had been the last time they'd been happy. Really happy. Just the two of them. So much future ahead of them. With Sherlock treasuring the thought that maybe Mummy would let him see their Secundus when they were ready to leave John's safe harbor.
Melas came into sickbay later that day. After the exam, they placed their hand over their belly and said, "I'm going to keep it?" Took a deep breath. "Going to do my best to keep it."
Especially when Donovan said, "I figured after Sh'Alaack stayed on the Bakerstreet after the whole fucking Greek tragedy a few years back that the two of you had worked things out, but I don't need to be the freak to see that you've both got something fucked up between the two of you just now. If I see you're about to go at it down there, I'll stun the pair of you and came back to the ship, and fuck me if I won't."
Technically, he'd used it that morning too. Since a direct approach wasn't working with Sherlock, he'd figure maybe a scenario would work. After all, scenarios had played a big role in their relationship over the last nine years.
John raised blue eyes at him. "I need this. I can't think."
"Of course it did," said John. "But would you take me there? It'll help me learn how to fix the things?"
"Not that I in any way wish to be fair to Mycroft," they exchanged a look, "but she'd only been free for few months before I encountered her nine years ago. She was a child," he thought about the little girl he'd encountered, "she'd be in her late teens by now. How old was she when she was frozen? How old were we? What happened? I have nothing to examine but myself and now you."
Young Sherlock was alive, but non-responsive. John gave him a simulant, but there was no reaction. Outer extremities were absolutely white. Body pulling blood into the central core to keep it warm.
Which elicited, as she'd expected it would, a rant from Killander about how Veaker was holding back Killander's career and prospects and the very progress of Section 31. Veaker was an unlikeable and confrontational Human, but he was good at his job.
"No, no, no!" said Pavan, glaring at them. "The theological point of interest is not that he sent our ancestors back. The question is where did we come from in the first place? We are not a serpent consuming its own tail. We have an origin."
He wasn't mad at her any more.
Which meant he had the rather odd challenge of breaking into the Breen embassy.
Unfortunately, during this small speech Sherlock could see the closer individuals silently picking up a heavy bench as if one intelligence – Adam's if what Sherlock suspected was true – was directing them. Without a word or shout, they broke into a run in their direction.
Sally didn't really give a fuck about some prince's blue balls, beyond the part where the Federation was now overrun by augmented fuckers, who were fucking everything up.
"He says something that sweet and beautiful about you, and you ask after your sister." Mum shook her head. "Clearly, we should have focused more on romantic comedies and fewer tragedies when you were a child."
John said, "I'll head down with you. I need to go to sickbay. See what Moriarty did to Julian, and start checking on the crew."
She'd married a Tellarite drug smuggler to subvert a Romulan plot. She'd broken three thousand prisoners out of a Cardassian prisoner of war camp. She's stopped a megalomaniac from pointing a planet eating device at the Federation with a hair pin and some strategic pole dancing.
John floated on those waves. Panting.
It felt utterly familiar and utterly new.
"That was not the reaction I would have expected," said Killander sitting opposite him. "Tell me the truth. Where are you from?"
said, "None of your heretical 22
"You are very poetic," said John truthfully. The three months Trelane had spent grounded on the Bakerstreet had seen a surge in poetry written on the walls of the lab deck.
A lot of arguing.
"He's not my father, he's my Daddy." John sauntered forward, his entire gate different. A bizarre simulacrum of seduction given his apparent age and he was very clearly with chi… that he was very clearly pr… that Sherlock had bred a great many…. Sherlock's mind stuttered. John said, "The captain here picked me up on Deneb IV. He told me he'd get me to Risa. That all I'd have to do to pay for my passage was let him fuck me. Easy choice given that's what I was selling on Deneb IV." John came closer to Lurin.
"Yay," said Shrilaas, clapping her hands. She'd enjoyed the attention and even drew a picture for a lady who really liked the book.
John packed. He smiled. He helped Mum and Dad settle into his quarters on the Bakerstreet and told them it didn't matter if he slept on a replicated bed. He could have set them up in one of the empty quarters, but family time wasn't something to be wasted.
Sherlock groaned. "Of course you're much more interested in doing anything other than answer my questions. I have statements from multiple individuals claiming that…"
A smile bloomed on his face. "The Breen have been expelled from Janus VI for tampering with the site facilities. Murder of a member of the colony council. Their attempt to get another toe hold in Federation space was a step too far." His smile was superior. Condescending. Interesting given reports of some lifeform also causing mischief. "Perhaps the native creature would make a more reasonable suspect."
While John had been away, there had been a few of those. While she tried to figure out who she was. Not that he knew about them. He'd been away.
He should have identified that their current reproductive difficulty was a possible concern earlier. He should have done something to prevent it.
Sherlock glared at him, but Julian was unmoved. It was slightly better when Sherlock was able to manifest a monitor above him and review the scans. But Sherlock wouldn't be satisfied until John was found.
The three children gathered around him as he turned his voyages into a pirate's quest for treasure. For knowledge. Soon they were offering suggestions, mostly Victorius. Some of Chin's remarks about Victor made more sense now that he'd met the boy colored by her own perceptions.
As to evolutionary bottlenecks, a link. Also, an interesting lecture if you get a chance to see the Elephant Seals at Ano Nuevo State Park.
The dark skinned woman crossed her arms. "You can't both be the fucking captain,"
Elim wanted to be lied to. Have obfuscations trailed in front of him like veils upon the ground.
Sherlock said, "I see you've completed what you set out to do in sickbay." Another cut. Another sharp thunk. The blade embedded in the board.
The performance itself was great. His father had if anything gotten better as Lear. While he was quiet and reserved in social situations, the moment Karidian Watson stepped on a stage, he was transformed by the role. Harry was mostly sober in her role as Cordelia, the loving daughter. Clara in the role of Goneril appeared to be using her anger from her breakup with Harry to inform her rage. His mother was amazing as the wise fool. He was surprised to see his cousin Shelly in the cast and shocked to realize that many of the other roles were being filled by her now nearly grown children.
"Do you really think it was an egg?" pipped up Thil. This could mean nothing good. Nothing good ever came of that expression on Thil's face.
The Klingon who was in love shoved the communicator back in the pocket of his leather vest and returned to his discussion of B'Etor's many virtues and maddening faults.
John opened his mouth to protest and closed it.
"And what if a vessel answers the signal that these birds of garbage cannot deal with?" asked Nom. "These ships are held together by rust and Klingon vomit."
"I caught him once. I can catch him again. I'll just need the resources," said Sally.
"The profit is how I get paid by adults to entertain and occupy their children's time," said John absently, before remembering that it was something that his father used to say when Ferengi asked him the same question. Glory for Klingons. Position for Romulans. Profit for Ferengi.
Rows of prisoners and guards flowed around the shuttle. By Sherlock's calculations, all of the residents of penal colony and the asylum.
"I… I don't know." They looked over and Connor was looking at them. "Not right now. Maybe… not right now."
However, there was no way to force a cure.
It was ridiculous. John was alone in his quarters when he had a perfectly good husband.
"It was not my decision," said Apollo. "My father, Zeus, he decided that we were doing more harm than good and decreed that we must leave. But I have waited for you, all these years. While the others spread thin on the wind, until all that was left was wind, I held on, certain that you would come."
Course, they had been trying to figure out how to get access to sickbay and some of the items there. John screamed, because there was no reason not to. Not screaming wouldn't get him to sickbay.
Second Father threw up her hands. "Of course, there is a recording."
Killander, blood still trickling from his lower lip, swapped out his insignia for black insignia as well. "You're going to have a long time to regret that punch."
John repeated his question. "Where is the landing pad for the ion ship?"
He pleaded, aching, "Please, Master. May I come?"
"Do you, do you want me to come with you?" asked Mr. Billy, looking very worried. "I'm sorry, I only meant to leave you alone for a few minutes."
"You want to publish," said Donovan flatly. "Your boyfriend published his big story about Andorian reproduction and now you want a spot of glory."
Mollyhoo smiled awkwardly. "The children born that first year have… it's more complicated to figure out whose related to who than you might think."
Victorious was going to…
"You are a terror and a wonder," said John. "Of course, I need you." He laid one hand on Sherlock's lower back above his sacrum. With the other, he pulled out the plug. The scent of lube and sex and alpha musk filled the chamber. Sherlock rewarded him by hooking his legs over John's shoulders as John's cock took the place of the plug. Made use of his double joints. Sherlock groaned when John told him, "You belong to me."
http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Spock%27s_Brain_(episode)
A Breen with brilliant green piping warbled at him. Tapped a control and a computerized voice said, "You've returned to your own time period, but you've been suffering from extreme time dilation from your journey into the past of five thousand years ago."
Connor wished he'd read more about the first Augments when he'd had the chance, but he hadn't really wanted to think about it. He sent a message to the Bakerstreet so Eva could ask her mom recommend some books.
"Why are you loose, Human?" said the taller guard. "Are the Ferengi so pathetic they cannot even control children?"
John moved to Moriarty's right while Supersmart fanned out to his left.
John was just glad Washington lived up to his last name and knew all the words to something the defendants of Americans got worked up over. Anything to get the locals to leave them alone long enough for John to get his tricorder back and confirm that none of the away team were plague carriers.
John reached into the rucksack, one of the few items still remaining in the room, and rummaged around. He pulled out an empty bottle of water. Filled it from the sink Khel had insisted should be part of the holodeck suite, and drank near to the last swallow, before refilling it and tossing it to Sherlock. John said, "Why hasn't anyone come to find us?"
"And am I a match for Khan Brittanus?" A risk, but a worthwhile one. Attack. Attack. Attack. "You can scan me if you'd like." He folded his hands. "I'll wait."
"And…"
It added anticipation as an extra spice to their meals.
He must take it as an honor that Mummy has sent him to as their representative to the hasty meeting of the Alignments. Outside of the usual festivities of the Meiosis. While they had a conversation with their new ally about the meaning of the term, "Hands off."
"Who was trying to erase your memories?" Sherlock did so dislike it when people were imprecise using pronouns rather than actual names.
"Not that my brother elected to tell me that he travelled back in time and met my progenitor."
Their nod was subtle. Another squeeze of the shoulder.
"We love each other," said John carefully.
As they grew closer to the center, John could make out the faint outlines of buildings against the emergency lights, there was the sound of shouting and a phaser blast.
"Oh, you know how it is. Accidents happen. Backup instruments aren't calibrated. We were supposed to in for maintenance months ago. Now we're here having this conversation."
Sestre said, "It didn't kill anyone."
"True." They worked the stone until Bihr grew almost too weary to stand.
"Agreed," said Apollo. "But not her," said Apollo pointing at Donovan. "She is not welcome. She reminds me of the one who,"
"Who are you?" said the first voice.
"That is fortunate," said Hudson gravely. "No profit there."
Mollyhoo held up her hands protectively. "No one is going to hit anyone."
Benjamin poured a dose of whiskey into John's Hasperat and then a generous pour into his own.
They both stared at their cups. Occasionally, glancing at each other.
"I am. Good day, Doctor Watson." She left John sitting there bemused.
Sestre stood up. "I am well, Father. Ishrob and Shroleb took good care of us while we had no memories."
"But I don't understand how you'll use the bomb to help get them out," said Watson.
Apollo did not want to follow, but his sister, star showering Artemis said only, "Brother, it's time."
"I… don't know." Billy could almost hear Hudson telling him that he should always review all the information about the layout of a location before going there. He'd run the scenarios, but he hadn't applied the knowledge. But there was still time.
John's had the same determined cast as he stayed near her.
"There are bodily secretions on the collar I'm wearing. I'm verifying that you produced them." It was obvious even with their lack of information. He huffed an annoyed breath. "Your semen has been rubbed into its surface. The most likely scenario is you have ejaculated on my face or chest while I've worn the collar, perhaps both, in order to achieve that result."
It was yesterday.
"Because all they can think of is rutting," said Jovas. "Omegas go into heat once a year."
There was a flash of golden light around them. They were standing inside some sort of industrial facility.
She worked quietly through the morning and afternoon, clearing detritus from a seemingly infinite series of offices. Federation or Khanate, governments ran on bureaucracy, and that meant garbage and recycling. She was a little surprised by the green bins, which were to be gathered for worms to eat the organic waste.
John sent his genius off to find the computer. If a building hadn’t just fallen on Sherlock, he might have realized why John wanted him away.
"I'm a doctor. I'm here to help where I can," said Watson without a trace of confusion. She envied his ability to speak with such confidence.
And a couple more chapters to go in this particular story (not sure why the count was off), but I didn't want to hold onto this one now that we've reached this point.
"I don't think you believe me," said Moriarty. Then he shrugged. "We'll see if Wilkes was up to the task." He leaned forward. "Not that I'll need to deal with him long." He winked at Sherlock.
http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Captain%27s_Holiday_(episode)
"Huh, it's not often I get to explain things to you," John flashed a look at Bashir and mouthed, "Never." He continued, "We're seeing Human remains that have been subjected to a high energy flash and turned to ash."
Here, a Trill, Ezri, broke in to clarify that the prince was only raised on one of the moons. Ezri also appeared to argue with herself a good deal so there was that.
Cho snorted.
"You are bleeding." Sherlock examined the cut for glass with a micrometer. A wave of tenderness washed over John. He reached out to touch Sherlock's curling black hair with his other hand. It was silky as always. Sherlock said, very quietly, "Don't."
"While my alignment believes the sites are the same age," said Pavan. "The lack of archeological record is the reason Sarpeidon," Pavan spat on the ground, and John shivered although the room was perfectly warm, "built the Atavachron, a time dilation machine. He was a Fenisal, who believed that our kind were an abomination. He sterilized what he considered to be the weakest of us and sent them back into the past. So the first ancestors would waste time attempting to breed with them."
They were all cut off by Veema, who gave a loud Bronx whistle. When the crowd quieted, they said, "We don't all agree on all aspects of what occurred. You must understand there are no written records remaining from that period."
John swallowed. He wanted Sherlock. But his sexy, gorgeous husband, instead of getting naked was putting on clothes to sleep in their climate controlled room. They didn't need clothes!
"I…" John tried to remember what his reasoning for inventing such a device had been so long ago, but as was the case in most situations like this, Sherlock was right. "Yeah, I guess I did."
Fortunately, John was only called in once.
"Oh, I know exactly where that talented individual is. Your sibling is in our little theater. Yes, we have a theater. I encourage the guests to explore the arts, but we were blessed with Harry. Absolutely blessed." Frankland looked at John slyly. "She's putting on 'Twelfth Night', right now. We should go before someone mistakes you for Harry, or is it Sebastian." Because he must think John – growing up in the theater – had never gotten a Shakespeare joke about being a twin in his life.
"Treason! Mutiny!" shouted Wilkes. "I'll have anyone who joins with this man executed."
"But, that's not possible," said Sarabeth.
Sherlock was still wandering about their quarters in a sheet, which was going to be his new clothing of choice for the duration, when John went back to sickbay.
John leaned his head against Sherlock's shoulder. "Too bad we can't send a message to the future to get a ride home."
John said, "Pet, ask to suck my cock."
The omega came with a shout.
Before John left the ready room, he replicated a balloon and drew a smiling face for Sherlock to stare at from his desk.
"It could bring the whole fucking mine down around us," said Donovan sourly.
"What no seriously. But you're," Sherlock had to be at least ten years older than John and, "gorgeous."
If he were a teenager, he'd have an excuse. The vomeronasal organ didn't fully develop until the late teens.
