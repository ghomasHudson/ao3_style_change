“Why?”
Nodding, Steve turned his attention to the brunette. “What are you making anyway?”
“Yeah,” it was raspy, but with a clearing of the throat Tony was able to voice himself clearly. “Where are we going now?”
“I didn’t know a place like this existed so close.”
After a couple of moments a sigh escaped the blonde’s lips and he stood. “Are you hungry?”
“Okay,” Steve nodded, taking in that Tony wanted this more. That someone wanted him more. Everyday even. “I want you more too. Everyday more. But, maybe not completely public in front of paparazzi because I think they are pinning me with some dame down at SHEILD right now and I don’t know how many people believe it, but I look like a real serial dater right now—”
“You don’t say sorry much.”
“Seriously, though, Steve. It doesn’t sound selfish to me—and I know I’m not a role-model for the least selfish people on Earth—but you would go back and do it again to save him. And I’m entirely convinced you would do the exact same things you did in the process. Like beat fucking Nazis.” Tony watched Steve swallow, his Adam's apple bobbing. He thought about what it would feel like to press his lips against it, but stopped it there. “Even then, you’re allowed to be selfish at times. Don’t follow in my footsteps, of course. But… indulging in your desires is a good thing.”
Tony dove into the middle compartment before pulling out a glasses case containing a pair of sunglasses. Typically, if this were Bruce or Natasha or Clint, Tony would hand the glasses case over to the person in his passenger side and instruct him to put them on. But, a crush that Tony often neglects to recognize burned deep and he let his hands open the case and pull out a pair of sunglasses before sliding them onto Steve. It made Steve smile goofily, a smile he hadn’t given many men the pleasure of seeing unless he was drunk (and getting drunk was no longer an option for him).
“I mean, only the good things. I just want to be caught up,”
In the car, both men sat awkwardly for a couple seconds while Steve adjusted the bags in the back. The twisting movement that the man did while leaning was something that was just about to drive Tony crazy. Because he could see Steve’s muscles flex under the shirt and he desperately wanted to run his fingers over the abs just to see what they felt like. And he wanted to trace the vein that ran down his forearm.
“I don’t usually have a reason to.”
“Love it, actually, just too good to touch.”
Steve, of course, was in the car first. All that man did was throw on a dark hoodie and a black hat. (He also grabbed two pillows and a king sized blanket and stuffed it in the trunk, but that was nothing Tony knew about.) Tony, on the other hand, made sure to brush his teeth and wash his face (and his body with a rag) before pulling on a blue jacket and hat. Oh, and don’t forget his aviator sunglasses. He put those on as well.
After a couple seconds of fiddling a familiar tune was blasting. One Steve had blocked from his memory in complete and utter embarrassment. “Star Spangled Man”.
Tony let himself lean down and brush their lips together before adding any pressure. He thought that he would’ve been pushed away by then, that Steve would’ve definitely accused the man of taking things the wrong way. But, God, this was so right. Especially since Steve was kissing back and just as eager. Steve moved with Tony, following the kiss up to the point where Steve had himself propped on his elbows and was leaning towards Tony.
With a forced breath the blond finally responded: “Well, I mean, if we go to a gas station we can pick up food that we don’t have to make and then we can… I don’t know, pig out in some open area or parking lot. But I could cook for you, too. Hence the whole, grocery store part.”
“Please turn it off.” Tony was only singing louder, more obnoxiously. “Stark! Turn it off!” The subject shook his head no and grinned bigger as he rounded the corner. “Tony,” softer, pleading, “please.”
Tony didn’t know they were gone, of course, whenever someone went in he only half-listened to whatever they were talking about. Of course, that half of a listen was dedicated to making sure he could get a snarky comment or two in during the five minute conversations.
Turning off the literal music showed a clear perk in Steve and lead to the figurative music being turned off as well. However, it was in perfect time for Tony to pull into the gas station.
Meanwhile, Steve went for the inside of his arm just below the crook of his elbow and together the two of them wetted the napkins and placed the tattoos against their skin with enough pressure from the napkins to leave the tattoos on their skin until friction and water would wear them away.
“Do you want it to be?”
“One hundred percent.”
Part of Steven wanted to play at this side of Stark for once. Tony Stark was being complicit (and slightly sexual). Complicity was a characteristic of the man that didn’t come out much and teasing might ruin the fun that was waiting to happen. Steve pushed this teasing part of him down and failed to draw any attention to it, “I actually was thinking the grocery?”
One hand reached out, eyes still on the road, and went to run it’s fingertips over Steve’s jaw. It was an odd reaction to the answer, but at this point Steve wasn’t going to question Stark because the man was fairly unpredictable. (Or perhaps Steve was just too daft to catch the way the genius thought of him.)
It was hard for Tony to ignore the worry that this would be it, that they would have barely talked over food, packed up, and filed themselves back into the car to head home. Maybe the intimacy was all in Tony’s head. But instead, Steve joined Tony and laid next to him on their comforter island in the middle of the field.
“I’m selfish.” Steve finally said, pain spilling into the open air. “I did it to fight. To help. But now I’d go back and do the same thing just to save Buck. I’d rather him die by that fall, fighting with me than torture.”
“Crashing into the ice or the serum?”
Steve didn’t play around. He wasn’t playful like this. He was stone cold and never got that playful tone, not that that was unattractive it was just the norm. This was a new side of Steve. A side he craved to see more often and was going to devote the rest of his life to pulling out more often.
Steve tensed, eyebrows shooting up. Kids. So in this backstory he and Tony had adopted (or genetically made) children. He could roll with that. Hell, he wouldn’t mind it being a reality either.
Tony wanted to hear his name come out of Steve’s lips more often. His first name in specific. And because he loved the sound of it so much he happily obliged. Steve’s voice saying his name (and even that little please at the end), now that was music. Boy, would he love to hear that song while it laid beneath him. Maybe above, the man wasn’t too picky when it came to his taste in music.
“I didn’t listen to you during the mission and it got you cut up pretty bad, so I’m sorry.”
Steve shamelessly opened the packet of cookies and shoved one in his mouth.
“I might shave it again, I mean it’s a bit of stubble and it’s nowhere near a full beard. But I’ve also considered just letting it grow out, see where it takes me?”
The man turned, licking his lips and watching as the short brunette weaved his way through the aisles stuffing more and more food into the basket. Tony laughed at one point, dropping a bag of chips on the floor and picking it back up quickly. The man then turned, making eye contact with the super soldier through the aisle and he let out the biggest smile to ever grace Tony Stark’s lips in a sober state.
“You’re lewd.”
It made Steve smile (and that smile would make Tony’s heart rate increase) and before he could even think he was walking around the bench and holding his hand out to Tony.
If Tony were feuding with anyone else he would say it was a surprise that the other made the first move into neutral grounds. However, the billionaire was labeled as a genius for good reasons and he could predict that Cap would be the bigger man. After all, he was the pettiest and yet sweetest man to grace New York. (Also, the hottest, Tony couldn’t forget the last part even if he tried. Believe me, he tried real hard.)
, give her own stories about Steve Rogers. The unembellished, embarrassing, hilariously human side of the one and only super soldier. The stories Tony used to love as a kid. And she’d fade, and fade, and fade, and Tony would get further and further away from her on his quest to keep the earth safe until Fury called him at three am while he frantically worked on the Accords to tell him the unfortunate news. And although he’d quit months ago for Pepper, and the Avengers, and his quest to
, but goddamn it, Clint. Do you have any idea what it feels like to see your entire team dead or dying and for them to tell you it was your fault?”
“I betrayed them. I was sworn to protect them, and at the first difficulty I broke their trust. I built that prison. I may not have physically brought them in, but I may as well have put the restraints on them. The least I could do is try to give them their lives back. Let it go, T’Challa,” Tony says, and his voice break. It might be the only reason why the king does though he still looks upset. “They’d be the first to tell you that I mean next to nothing to them now. I mean, Clint has already said it to my face.”
“Honestly, it’s just a meeting. I’ll be okay. They’ll yell at me for a while, Cap will do the whole ‘we do this together or not at all so you listen to me, Stark’ schtick and then everyone will go on their merry way. We’ll pretend to get along, go on training, wanda and clint will go on hating me. It’ll be all right.”
Once again, like so many times before when one of his teammates said something scathing about Iron Man, Steve felt unease curl in his stomach. He had to bite his tongue to refute it, call out the evidence that clearly Tony was still thinking of them, and merely nod. He avoided their gazes, but couldn’t avoid Bucky’s. The man’s dark eyes looked into his, and not for the first time, Steve caught a bare hint of disapproval. The man looked away and got to his feet before the blond could confirm it, though. Steve heaved a sigh and nodded to the others. They left Scott where he was, figuring he wouldn’t wake before they were back, and made their way to their rooms slowly.
Tony is still at the compound a few weeks later, under pain of death from Natasha, when T’Challa brings the entourage. Tony is fiddling with his phone in the conference room, which should have been an obviously bad choice seeing as the last time they were all there Ross had been threatening them with the accords. Natasha is standing behind him with a hand on his shoulder. Rhodey is at therapy at the moment or so he’d said though he’s probably more likely calling his mother and updating her on Tony’s progress. That woman is terrifying, and partly the reason why he doesn’t seem to be able to let go of the phone.
Steve yanks him into a fierce hug, his whole frame shaking, as the puzzle finally falls into place. He had been so angry during the Ultron thing. He had thought and called Tony the worst things, and yet—and yet here the man was, years later, shaking from the fear of the things that he had seen. From the things he thought he was responsible for.
ot real! It’s not real, Tony!”
They’re quietly standing in the deserted hallway for a long time. Tony breathes in the smell of baby shampoo and pretends that his eyes aren’t tearing up. Part of his mind can’t compute what Sam is saying because what? Sam is Steve’s friend, perhaps his only one in this new century, and here he is taking Tony’s side? They’ve never even talked, not really. Tony had created Redwing and repaired the wings, sure, and sometimes when there was an Avengers event they would meet. Before Ultron, there were those parties that they all attended and Sam seemed to like him well enough, but… this. This is so much more than that.
“Bucky!” Sam says in as much shock as Steve.
“Clint, now is really not the time,” Laura says calmly. There’s barely control fury in her tone, and Tony marvels at her. The same way he’d marveled at Pepper. That tightly controlled storm that was tame just for a handful of people.
Once he has calmed his knee-jerk reaction enough, he meets her eyes and knows he can’t quite keep the contempt hidden. If Barton’s flare of protectiveness and anger is any indication he has done a very poor job, indeed. Tony doesn’t think he gives a shit about them at the moment. “Boy, if you think what we ended up with was bad,” and he laughs the little ugly laugh he’s become acquainted with so well in the last few months.

It feels as though they’re standing there together for an eternity. Steve is still cradling his face between his palms, his thumbs gentle on his cheeks, and Tony can feel himself starting to give in. Part of him, the part that is still seething with hatred and heartbreak, demands that he pull away. That he don’t allow Steve to… to… manipulate him as easily as he had in the past.

Also, Baby Nate continues to be the most perfect baby in existence.
Steve reared back at the venom in his voice, venom he hadn’t heard from the other man since the first days of Clint’s deliberate cruelty, and again felt as though he was missing something. That feeling, more than anything, is what kept him from starting a screaming match. That, and the guilt that always came from realizing that Tony was right. He opened his mouth to say something, but Tony looked up and he found his heart twisting at the look on the other man’s face. At the tiredness and the disappointment there.
This is fine, he screams at himself, this is the best solution. He cannot have any of his children so close to danger. One of these alien fuckers had been enough to wipe the floor with four enhanced people. There is no way he will have any of his kids around for that kind of showdown. If these were the appetizers, God only knows what Thanos will do with them once they get close enough to attack.
“You’re right,” Steve managed to croak out and he tried to clear his throat of the lump that had formed there. He didn’t want to start crying in the entryway of the compound where any of the others could see him. He didn’t want to make this day about himself when both Clint and Tony were going through their own emotional ordeal.
She’d been a godsend for him when he’d just moved to London; a director at the museum he was interning with and a no nonsense woman who had told him in no uncertain terms that she had no time for amateurs as soon as they’d met. Steve, never one to resist strong, independent, loud-mouthed brunettes, had been lost from the start. She produced in him a type of awe and adoration he had only ever felt once before. She was strong-willed and driven but also very funny and one of the most caring people he could have ever met. Steve had been too afraid to even say more than a quiet hello to her for the first few months of his new life, but then she had found him and asked him if he had anything against inviting a gal out for dinner.
“I heard,” Laura says sympathetically. She has a sad smile on her face as he looks over at him, and Clint’s heart squeezes. Dear God, how he loves her. “You just miss your uncle, don’t you, baby bird?” At Clint’s raised eyebrow, she chuckles and bounces the baby on her hip. “Peter’s nickname; it kind of just stuck after the first few times. Have you tried taking him to the others?” Clint knows she means the other children.
“Bruce,” he says quietly and Natasha hisses like she’s been punched in the stomach. “What the hell is going on?”
. God, was I wrong,” he laughs, a harsh sound that breaks out of his chest unbidden. “So when we discovered that Ana wasn’t going—how long she had, I thought I was ready. I mean, I was so goddamed doped up around those years that I just—I thought I had it under control. But when it came down to it, and I saw Jar—Jarbiss,” his name comes out with the familiar lips he used to have every time he got too upset. The one Howard and his bullies made sure to beat out of him, but the Jarvises always found so endearing. “I’d never seen Jarvis so upset, and something in me just

“Communal kitchen with Agent Romanoff, boss,” FRIDAY relays quietly. Once he makes his way a bit further into the room, Tony can see them talking though they don’t pay attention to him. He wonders if he should mention it then, but then he doesn’t have to.
That last one was Peter, and Steve gives him an unimpressed look. He doesn’t look at all chastised, and is working his way up to incredibly pissed, if the flush climbing up his cheeks is any indication. Steve doesn’t care about their hurt feelings at the moment, however, because now they’re just wasting time. Someone has to go after Tony, and he’d be damned if he sends two kids alone into the city. More than that, though, he feels as though he owes it to the genius. Tony has spent entirely too much time running after
“Like you helped when you talked to him?” Cooper’s voice is venomous from his place at the table. His hands are fisted over the table, one of them clutching his fork, and he glares daggers at his father. Steve can feel the archer tense. “You sent him near a panic attack. Is that helping? Is that what you want to do now?”
“It’s not December, is it?” and the tone of his voice is pleading. Because it can’t be. It would just make everything so much worse.
“Yeah,” she says as she watches a woman come out of the jet. Her eyes cut to Barton, still distracted with his game, and wonders if he can sense the storm that’s coming his way. She decides to keep quiet about it. Maybe he needs some retribution.
my worst fear, Barton. Has she told you what she showed me?” Clint was shaking his head before his brain had really connected. Stark was… manic, is the only way the archer could describe him, now. He ran a shaking hand through his head and took a step away from Clint. “You were all dead, Barton. Every single one of you. Even Thor and the Hulk, who I—it’s unthinkable, for me, imagining
“You… don’t want me to give a statement?” Tony asks uncertainly. He glances over to both his side, but Rhodey is looking just as confused as he feels and Natasha’s face is completely blank as she stares at the man on the other side.
had already had a no on the tip of his tongue. He’d never questioned the how or why of Tony knowing about that story. He’d never bothered to know why Charlie Spencer had ever come to pass the genius’s lips. Now,
“Dad?” Peter says, so quietly and tremulous Tony’s chest tightens. It’s the first time he’s ever called him dad.
“Yeah, he did,” Rhodes says, and when Steve meets his eyes some of the contempt has left. He looks… relieved.
“You needed us,” Harley says and ah, there’s that Stark stubbornness shining through again. “You always say that’s what we have you for, right? Then it makes sense that it would go both ways. that means we have your back too,” Harley says and then, after a brief moment of consideration, rushes to wrap his skinny arms around the man’s waist. “Even when I tattle.”
“What does that mean for us now?” Natasha asks, refocusing the group. Thor’s hands tighten in displeasure.
“I don’t know how,” Tony says truthfully, and Steve loses the battle. He grabs hold of the shorter man and pulls him to his chest and grips tight. He doesn’t know how he’ll ever manage to let go. He doesn’t really want to.
Tony’s back muscles tense for a second, in utter surprise at a
“Banner’s notes,” there’s heavy skepticism in Wanda’s voice, and Tony bites another angry retort back. The way things are going he feels as though he will soon be tasting blood. Natasha’s hand squeezes his and it isn’t until that moment that he notices that she’d had a hold of him the whole time. She gives him a look that begs him to be patient, and he can’t do nothing but slump back in his chair. They haven’t even been together for five minutes and he already feels as though this was one of the worst ideas he’s ever had. He created Ultron, that in and of itself says a lot.
“Steve?” Tony’s voice is hesitant as he pulls away to look up into the soldier’s eyes. He expects to see—he doesn’t know what he’s expecting to see, but it’s not the fragile hope he finds there. He wants to kiss the fear hidden behind the hope away. “ Stop?”
“Nah, I’m serious,” he presses something on the controls and gets off the chair. They continue gliding through airspace and Steve thanks Tony for his tech even if it does bring a pang to his sternum. “Did he know where you were going?” he directs the question at Vision.
“You’re dead meat,” Harley says solemnly.
Tony’s message is received by what’s left of the avengers on a Thursday. Steve has to stop Rhodey from shooting out of the room half-cocked before the recording is even up. It earns him a punch to the jaw, with one of them watch gauntlets Steve didn’t even know Rhodey had, but it’s well worth it. The rest of Tony’s message is… worrying. Steve’s a planner, a soldier, and he’s seen this before. The way Tony looks right now reminds him of Bucky when they rescued him and the rest of the 107
Sitting there, holding his son, Tony debates how much he can share with his boy. Up until this point he has been thinking that it’s his job to protect him. That he has to swallow all of it, all the pain and despair and pure
“Morning, Cap,” Rhodes said with mock cheer. His eyes were still trained on his brother’s back.
“These guys buggin’ you, Dum?” he pats the little bot again. There’s a beat of silence for which Steve doesn’t look back, the atmosphere with the boys and even Rhodes a little too tenuous, and continues to pat the bot.
“He’s not in these,” he says slowly. With the index finger of his metal hand, he points at the schematics. “These are all of us, plus Rhodes and the Vision. There is a room labeled as a visiting room for someone called Spider-Man, but there’s no—“
His eyes are barely open when he sees it, a bright flash. It seems to grow bigger, grows brighter and warmer, the more looks at it. His smile grows, and though he’s sure the next time he blinks his eyes won’t open, he tries his best. He knew it. He knew
“Morning, Rhodey.” His eyes were for Tony, alone, though. From his profile, Steve could see the deep bags under his eyes and the lines around his eyes. He looked as exhausted as he had been last night, and considering he seemingly hadn’t managed to stay asleep after Steve had left the bed this morning, he wasn’t surprised.
“Boss, you’ve been here for over nine hours without proper nutrition,” his youngest says. Tony rolls his eyes, but can’t help the smile that takes over his face. Though she is no JARVIS, she still manages to put just the right amount of fond exasperation to her voice. “Papa Bear,” Tony snorts at the name, “insists that you make your way to the kitchen so that he can, and I quote, put some meat on your old brittle bones.”
Peter takes a step back and pulls a chair close to Tony. He doesn’t say anything, and he gives Tony the space to try to control himself. God, he’s so goddamn tired of fucking everything up. He should be the one to be strong. He should be the one to ask Peter how he’s doing; with spider-man, his biology club, his SAT preps, that asshole kid Flash, hell, even about Gwendolyn. He should be the one to man up and make sure that the kid is okay.
“Tony,” Steve’s voice breaks. His name sounds more like a plea. “You’ve got
This chapter is for and because of you.
, that he deserves the way the other man is looking at him. It has been a long time, and he has been angry and insecure for a lot of it, and so he hadn’t even tried. When Rhodey had kept him in the car after he saw Tony at the cemetery was the first time they had even had an actual conversation. They had been friends, damn it, back before the Accords messed happened. They had ribbed each other good naturedly about their branches, had sparred on their free time; Rhodey had helped him with the history he’d missed and even some of the pop culture when Tony wasn’t around. They had had rapport, and he was damned if he was going to keep laying down while all of that was taken away. He had already lost the people that mattered to him once, and, if for nothing else, his ill-advised overzealousness for Bucky was proof that he would fight for the people he called friends.
“A goddamn adult!” Steve slams his hand on the table, rattling the plates there. Natasha doesn’t even blink, but Steve knows her. He can read the surprise on her face. He guesses she hadn’t been expecting him to break this fast, but it’s been a long time coming. He’s been fraying at the edges since he dragged Bucky out of that bunker. “She’s old enough to make her own decisions, Nat. She’s with Viz, anyway, if they’re in trouble I really wouldn’t want to be the person that messes with them.”
They spend the rest of the day at the cemetery exchanging stories about their mothers. The mechanic isn’t particularly inclined to talk about his father, but talking about his Mama makes the tight knot in his chest loosen a little bit. Steve has plenty to say about Sarah Rogers and her no-nonsense policies. After a couple of hours, Tony’s holding his sides from how much he is laughing at Steve’s latest story about his mother. Apparently, tiny Stevie Rogers had had quite a mouth on him when he got riled up. Mrs. Rogers had refused to
Steve is a nobody from Brooklyn who had managed to scrounge up a scholarship with his doodles and no guaranteed of good living after his degree. His days of comfort are numbered; there is
Then Tiberius fucking Stone happens, and Steve has to try his best to not go off the rails. Tony’s stay at the hospital, apparently, was just the tip of a long-coming iceberg. When he gets out of medical care, because of the secrecy SI maintained or because the news just loved to shit talk him, he is swarmed by reporters. He’s wearing sunglasses, but there’s a dark purple bruise that’s still visible despite them. His arm is in a cast, and when he walks out the doors holding on to Rhodey’s arm, he hunches in on himself as though his ribs pain him.
Tony smiles at the kid, thankful for the in he has just given him, and makes his way to Rhodey’s side. He senses Steve’s eyes on him, but he ignores him in favor of the food that is clearly laid out for him. In the three weeks that they have been back, Tony had successfully managed to avoid seeing any of the others. After the hostility of that first day he figured it was best to clear his, clearly unwelcomed, presence away from them. He would have booked it back to the Tower if it weren’t for the fact that, for one, Pepper is currently there with Happy and that is another type of pain he is not willing to revisit at the moment. For another, Natasha had threatened bodily harm if he didn’t stick around to at least try to slap a band-aid on the mess they had of a team. Tony flexes his jaw at the phantom pain, and wonders if it’s really worth it.
Wanda’s arms are wrapped around herself as if that will keep her together. Her fingertips flash red sparks in what everyone in the room recognizes as her nervous tick. “Bruce,” she acknowledges softly. “You were all dead, and Stark was the only one left. He—I don’t know how—I just—it was just him, and you, Captain.”
The blond gulps against his suddenly dry throat and moves to stand beside his friend. Not too close because even he, as emotionally blind as he is, can recognize how fragile the other man is. He would never forgive himself if he were to send Tony into yet another panic attack at a moment like this. So instead, he tries to take in as much detail as he can.
“Don’t,”Rhodey had all but snarled. Steve had a feeling they’d had this conversation before. “Don’t you fucking dare say it.
“Steve—” but whatever she was going to say is cut off by the sound of Sam falling off the couch. They both turn to look at him, and that’s when Steve notices it.
“What he said,” Peter says with a grin, and even goes as far as pat Steve on the back as he goes by. Tony lunges to rustle his hair, but the boy is too fast and dodges out of the way.
This isn’t about him, and he knows that. He’s managed to muck enough things up trying to protect Wanda, treating her like a kid, to not know when to keep his mouth shut. Still, the urge is there. Every time he looks at her he remembers the way she’d found her after Lagos. Curled up in her bed while the newscasters had tore apart her every action, had accused her of things that she wasn’t. His protective instinct had flared up then, and it’s flaring up now, but he knows he can’t say anything. If there is anything that he’s learned so far is that his meddling isn’t helpful, not always, and he refuses to hurt her more than he already has. His meddling had landed her in the raft, it took a long time for him to realize that, a long while of blaming Tony for it, but he’s begun to recognize his shortcomings a bit better now. At least he hopes. So he keeps his mouth shut.
“That’s a lot of—“
, but he has always know Tony’s tells. Always.
“Hey! You got it. Good job, buddy,” Sam said and offered his own fist for a bump. Nate giggled again.
but knows it’s implied. He can’t do anything but.
At thirteen, Tony had been forced away for the summer. Some kind of “socialization” experiment his step-mother had conjured up so he could ‘stop being such a recluse, Howard, he doesn’t have any friends.’ Ha! Joke’s on here because after Rhodey had come Pepper and then Bruce and though they
Back when he was designing the plans for the facility, Tony was struck by inspiration one night (or morning) after another bender. He’d been putting the finishing touches on the outside accommodations when he’d remembered one of his favorite places as a child. He’d immediately begun to sketch the plans on the blueprints he’d given to Pepper. He still remembers the bright smile she’d given him when she’d seen it.
"As much as I love this, if you don't stop right now, I don't think I'm going to be able to stop myself at all. In terms of full out sex. In case that wasn't clear. Because I honestly don't know if you're a virgin or not and if you even fully want to do 'it' with me, or just keep kissing."
. It’s one of the few things that had never been aired to the public like dirty laundry. Peggy had loved him, he knows, truly loved him, since before he had proven his worth by putting together a circuit board or building an engine. “Before Howard did… whatever it is that he did to destroy their friendship, she helped raise me. She’d drop by to see how I was doing.” Tony smiles his Peggy smile as he stares at her name, though his eyes burn with tears. “She bought me my first toy. I must have been, what, two? She gave me this Captain America action figure; Howard used to say I didn’t have time for toys, but she snuck it in when she was tucking me into bed one time and asked me to keep quiet. She used to do that a lot, you know, keep secrets with me. It made me feel special, I guess, ‘cause Aunt Peggy was so cool. She was my superhero.”
that his mother had died in an accident only to be told that she’d been murdered. And if he’d found out that
“I think this meeting can be adjourned now,” T’Challa says quietly. When Steve opens his mouth to argue, he raises a hand. “It seems what you and Anthony have to discuss is far too personal and involving no more than the two of you. It is time we retire, and let you speak with each other.”
settle on his shoulders. It’s lighter and warmer than the weight he’s carried since he held Erskine in his arms.

“He was going to visit with Jarvis,” understanding flickers in the other men’s expression. “Said he’d be a while and that we should head back. He, uh,” he rubs the back of his neck and feels heat crawl up to his ears. Shit, how is he supposed to even ask for this? The least they are entitled to do is let him walk his ass back to the compound. “He said you might be able to give me a ride home?” it ends up coming out more like a question.
Tony spent a few more minutes teaching the little boy about colors and shapes and new words. Nate was like a little sponge, soaking and repeating everything that the engineer told him, and though tony was fairly certain he wouldn’t remember most of it he still took great pleasure in teaching him all of it. If by the next visit he remembered even one word, Tony would consider it an accomplishment. The older kids played duck-duck-goose with Sam for a good bit, and then decided to make a puzzle. They were putting the final pieces together when there was a tentative knock from the entryway.
what the suit is capable, if you’d wanted us dead? Really, truly hurt? We never would have made it out of that bunker. We
—“Tony chokes out.
Everywhere he went. Every place he sought a distracted, there was always something that would make his mind run back to them. The color of the sky near twilight was exactly like Peter’s when he was in the sun. The feel of the breeze on his cheeks during another restless night ambling around the palace grounds reminded him of the first night of their honeymoon. The tech, goddamn it all, the tech brought a flash of brown eyes and a whiff of metal and cologne every single day.
“Steve! Look, I get it. This is hard for you, but this is serious. Our friend is—”
“News from the UN,” Natasha says, and her voice is unyielding. Steve knows that this is a point where Natasha had had no contention. She had struggled when they were sent to gather the Avengers, she had struggled when fighting them, she had struggled when she’d let him go, she had been torn afterwards and he knows it, but
though the engineer had no idea why he thought it necessary. At least, Tony had reached peace with one of them.
“Sham!” Baby Bart yelled out next, and the pilot scooted a little closer to them. “Sham, es-que. Blue!”
Tony allowed himself a second, with his eyes closed, to take it all in. He let himself bask in the fact that despite the heartbreak, his team, his
. “Do you every think about—I dunno, dating again?”
Ross, as always, is a piece of shit. Tony is so very glad that this might be the last meeting he will ever have to see the son of a bitch’s smarmy face. His pocket feels heavy where his phone, and all its secrets, rests. He fakes smiles and shakes the hands of every dirty politician he knows. He shares more genuine greetings with the few world leaders he actually is in good standing in, and humbles his expression with the ones he doesn’t. He sees King T’Challa across the room, and when their gazes meet Tony drops his own. They might have been working toward the same goal, aided by a redheaded shadow, but old habits die hard. And holding pain and anger in is a very old habit for him.
of all people lecture him after all the times the so-called genius has fucked up.
The rest of the restaurant falls silent behind Steve. Vaguely, he registers Sam asking for drinks for the table. Hears him asking if Bucky thinks this is a good idea, though he hasn’t been present enough to know what
“Height of steroid cocktails, maybe,” Harley mutters, and yup. Steve has a long, long road to forget ahead. He’s thinking it might just be worth it to get to know this small spit fire that Tony calls his, though.

, Tony thinks to the boy in his arms. And the next breath hurts a little less.
“I wish I could say the same,” her voice says and Steve is amazed to find her accent thickens as a human’s would. “Please redirect to your quarters.”
not cry. And most of those times happen when he’s talking
We're in the upswing now :)
“I didn’t know what else to do!”
, thought it was a good idea to… what? Lump me in with my father? The man that beat me and abused me when he paid attention to me, or ignored me like I was scum on his shoe when he didn’t? Is that when I had a choice to say anything? Or maybe it was in that bunker? When I had the living hell beat out of me? OR what about when you all came back? When the first thing you did when we saw each other was punch me in face? Tell me when, Barton!”
Now all Steve had was a pocket full of memories, and a chain with a ring around his neck, and the constant feeling of emptiness that filled his chest with every breath. He bowed his head again, gritted his teeth against the sobs that were threatening to choke him and put the phone against his ear.
the bitter angry part of Tony that sounds too much like Howard bites out. The other part, though, the part that is battered and hurt, says quietly that he’s already halfway there. Instead of voicing his conflict, Tony just nods. Steve’s eyes are still infinitely sad, but he nods back at the mechanic.
“Would you—would you tell me the poem? if you—if that’s okay?”
“Danvers?” she asks, and she frowns at him. Then she puts two fingers up to massage her temple, and Tony gets it. They don’t call him a genius for nothing, and this looks disturbingly familiar. He wonders what they made her do, and whether or not they had to recalibrate her the way Romanoff did to Barton.
to no avail.
“Phil, please,” Steve said raising a hand to stall the other man’s words. He felt his cheeks flush in embarrassment but he straightened his spine and looked at the agent head on. “While I appreciate the reminder, I have to say that it won’t be necessary,” he saw the way the other man raised a sardonic eyebrow at him and opened his mouth. “I spoke with Tony last night. I won’t be attending.”
family safe, Mr. Lang,” he said, and though he was still speaking quietly he knew that the blond had heard him. He caught the quirk at the side of that perfect mouth, and then the other man was gone.
Finally, Peter stands back up with a sigh and turns his big brown eyes on Tony, the aha! Smile he’d taken from his dad making him look even younger than he actually is. “Okay, so remember that really old movie Alien that you let me watch even though Papa said no?”
It wasn’t until after their breakup that he realized he’d never bothered to find a time for his girlfriend and his friends to meet. So now he just hung out with his friends, went on morning runs around the park and tried to find his footing again. He checks up on Tony through the news occasionally, knows when he might be okay and when he might not. Forces himself not to google him when he sees another gossip rag talking about his sex life. Tries his hardest to make himself believe he made the right choice.
Or maybe Steve is confusing father with son again, and he really needs to stop.
Also, Steve is... Damn it, boy. The work you're going to have to put in in a minute.
“I can see that,” Steve says and brings a spoonful of the cereal up to his mouth without even looking at it. Which is a mistake as he promptly spits it back out. He looks down at the bowl and the offending bright chunks floating on his milk and staining everything in off-putting colors and turns to stare at Tony in disbelief. “You didn’t,” he says, with feeling.
“Believe me, Agent Barton, if I had known the dangers I would have kept him home. Hell, I thought I was meeting my
He didn’t feel as comforted about it as he thought he should.
“We were going to make doodads,” Peter’s voice sounds sad. Tony wants to believe that the kid does mind, but really, who would he be kidding with that? There’s no contest between the mass murderer and America’s hero. Tony isn’t masochistic enough to put that into consideration.
Steve wakes up to kisses being placed all over his recent freckles. It’s the same way he’s woken up every summer for the last three years of his marriage and he can’t help the silly grin that spreads across his face. The man on top of him laughs and presses open mouthed kisses down his throat. Steve groans and rolls over, pinning the body of his husband over his as he blinks his eyes open.
“I didn’t mean to—“
“We’ll have time to finish them later, Spiderling,” he says with an easy smirk. Rhodey frowns at him, but Tony can’t seem to care. Steve’s surprise shows in his face as he stares at the kid, and the boy blushes. There, they should have something to talk about now that Steve isn’t concerned about speaking of important matters in front of a civilian. “I bet you have plenty of questions for Cap over here, and I bet he’d love to tell you those stories. You can drop by later if you have time.”
Sam and Bucky share a look, and Steve tries to not show his displeasure. He doesn’t know what it is, lately, that’s making him so angry and hollow at displays of… belonging like this. And it isn’t just with Sam and Bucky; just last week, Natasha had introduced him to her boyfriend Clint, and their easy banter had rubbed him the wrong way. His running partner, a lovely veteran woman with a no-nonsense attitude named Maria had introduced him to his wife Carol, and the same feeling had cropped up.
He sits up from the coat he had commandeered since he and Nebula had left Titan. There’s something on his arm, and when he turns he realizes it’s an IV line, and that despite his initial assessment nothing is the same. Turning his head, he realizes that although the ship might look similar it is not the same. For one, he can’t see them outside anymore. This medbay looks different, shinier and bigger, and though the cot remains uncomfortable at least it’s not the thin lumpy mess the other one was.
So although a part of him, the one that had always and would always love Maria with a fierce protectiveness, he mourned for them both when they passed.
“What if I just wait here,” the mechanic begins a few feet away from the entryway, “and one of you scavenges some food? or better yet, I can go back to the workshop and you can bring me left overs!” he turns his most charming grin on the two boys accompanying him and gets an eye roll from Harley and an unimpressed look from the Captain.
Thinking about Peggy snaps him out of his daze, and he finally feels inspiration come to him for something other than his self-destruction. He looks at the other man out of the corner of his eye; notices the still-red flush of his cheeks and the dried salt on his cheeks. He bites his lip, trying to decide if maybe this is the best idea at the moment, but now that he’s thought about it he feels as though he can’t contain himself. He
To know that Tony was back to that. That they’d pushed him to that again after
Tony just hums, the grief still a little too close in his heart despite how long it has been since he’s lost them. He blinks up at the sky, that distrustful part of him still too weary to show much around Steve, especially too afraid of letting the man see him this vulnerable. “Losing Mama was,” Tony shakes his head and bites his lip bloody. Steve’s hands tear at the dirt under his palms. “I never thought anything would hurt as much as that did. I know you probably think I’m an asshole for saying it, but losing Howard didn’t really change much in my life; I suppose I was sad,” he says a little louder when Steve opens his mouth as if to speak, a distressed look on his face. “But most of all I
“Yeah, you said we could come visit you and the boys. Har wants to see some of the improvements we made to the web shooters last time. Plus, the roadsters still needs a tune up! He could help,” Peter continued just as enthusiastically. Tony glanced up at his boys in amusement and exasperation, but merely nodded and they were off like a rocket. “We’ll see you down there!”
drops onto Steve and he has to blink up at the ceiling to keep the tears at bay, Tony’s there to press kisses to his shoulder. He doesn’t say anything. Doesn’t offer empty platitudes or meaningless comfort. He merely lets Steve’s thoughts run their course while he holds his hand.
The Merchant of Death had wreaked havoc on the world for a very long time. It was only fair that it came to collect tenfold.
When Steve had finally crawled out of the Bentley after his talk with Rhodes, he’d been in too bad of a headspace to do anything but beat it down to his room with his metaphorical tail tucked between his legs. In hindsight, he’s grateful that Rhodes had given a bit of Tony’s back story to him. That, perhaps, the lieutenant colonel had decided that despite his screw ups, Steve was worthy of knowing his friend. Hell, his brother. At the moment, though, he’d honest to God wished that Rhodes had spent however long that talk lasted threatening bodily harm rather than outlining in specific detail just how much Steve had misjudged the mechanic.
of not having to see the bags under his eyes and the pinched expression on Rhodey’s face. He’d looked after Harley long after the boy had disappeared around the corner. He’d tried to ask FRIDAY after her boss, but she’d stayed resolutely silent.
“Har, I was dealing—“
“Captain Rogers,” a painfully familiar voice tells him as he approaches a previously unexplored hallway. “You have been made aware of the restrictions to your access. I know my—
Tony had made peace with his own end back when the Battle of New York happened. Back then, when their biggest problem was a demigod on a power trip, it had felt like a good ending. It felt like… his arch was up. He had done everything he could, and after all he was just a man, anway. Broken. Vulnerable. Tiny. Human.
The soldier froze with his fork halfway to his mouth. The baby had never, and he means
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony’s eyes, that had been locked on the Baby’s and trying his better best not to look too besotted, immediately snapped up to the blond man’s. Barton has a scowl on his face, and his arm keeps the baby where he is. Bart-bot makes a whining noise and stretches a bit more with a fussy “’Onnyyyy.” Barton looks down at him and hushes him while Tony straightens.
“They sound like remarkable people,” the blond says after a moment of silence. “I’m glad you had them.”
Self-loathing drips out of Tony’s words despite his cavalier tone. How had he not noticed that? How had nobody clued in to the fact that every time the genius listed his shortcomings it wasn’t looking for adulation, but had merely been confirming what he already thought of himself?
He rushes past her to snatch them up, and she gives a breathy laugh at his enthusiasm. And then, without thinking, Tony plucks the folder from her hands. The mistrust and the panic don’t even register in his head. There is literally nothing here that would hurt him. On the contrary, it gives him more hope than most of the shitty things in his life. So he takes the folder from her, and then in a bout of unequivocal gratefulness and affection for the woman that had seen him through this process for so long, kisses her on the forehead.
Tony scurried away from the tallest man and towards one of the many food aisles but could hear a laugh and a “You have to stop saying that to me!” And despite the innuendo, the Star Spangled Man made his way to the refrigerators and began filling them with random energy drinks he saw Tony drink before and a couple of waters for himself.
And it clicks, all at once. Howard, probably at the brink of death, had texted
Steve releases his dick with a loud pop, the smug bastard, but the idea of Steve sucking him off is such a turn on. He gives the blond's hair another tug, beckoning him back up his body, and Steve goes willingly. They share another kiss, and Tony moans at the taste of his own spend on Steve's lips, his hands going down to cup Steve's beautifully sculpted ass.
"What? Is something else going on?" James asks, his eyebrows drawn in confusion.
Halfway through the movie he can't pretend to be paying attention to, a thought forms in Tony's head. Steve's still half hard from their make out session in the kitchen, though he keeps shifting in his seat in an effort to hide it. Slowly, and with his eyes fixed on the screen in front of them, he places his hand on Steve's thigh. Steve flickers his gaze down to Tony's hand, then looks up at Tony and away, embarrassed but not pushing the hand off him.
Then, Tony moved on to taking off Steve's pants. As he slid them down Steve's thighs, he kissed every inch that was being shown to him. Eventually, Steve was just left in his boxers.
for the blessed moment.
"Oh. That's true." Steve smiled into Tony's neck, realizing just how much Tony's words were implicating. There could really be a chance at a future for them - a future where Steve wouldn't simply be pining over Tony, wishing that he could be in arms reach. He could actually be in Steve's arms, not just a part of Steve's fantasies.
"Nightmares?"
"Oh, come on Steve, I didn't mean it like that. Don't look like you're going to crumble apart. Sorry, maybe I used the wrong words. I meant it as in I'm in love with you, and I know it. I don't just think it."
"Considering not that long ago I said I was in love with you, I think you can guess how I feel about that."
"We'll get to that in a bit, darling. Right now, I just want to focus on you." Steve could only nod as he slid to the end of the bed, so that Tony was kneeling right in front of him. How many times had Steve dreamed of this, never thinking that the dream would ever become a reality?
It would be a lie to say that Tony did anything but fully fulfill his promise to Steve. Tony swallowed Steve's head and several inches of his dick in seconds, and started to bob his head back and forth along the length of it.
"You're the one who I see die the most, and I always feel a different type of pain when it's you. It's like some form of animal is ripping my body and heart to shreds, and I feel that I deserve to go through that pain because I let
The cherry on the cake was when Steve accidentally thrust into Tony's mouth, and when he tried to pull back out, Tony grabbed Steve's ass and pushed him right back in. How could Tony be so perfect at everything, to where he knew just what to do to bring Steve beyond close to release in less than a minute?
"Did Captain America just curse? I'm beyond shocked that such language could ever come out of the lips of America's golden boy!"
"Would it be ok if I kissed you? Considering you don't seem to mind my thumb on your lip, or my other hand, which is behind your neck, I don't think you'd mind. But ya know, consent is always important."
"Tell me then. Telling me could help you get rid of the nightmares, and maybe in the process aid one or two other things."
Steve just stood where he was, debating on what he should do. Even though he did want to tell Tony, to tell someone, what had been affecting him for months, he knew that he would regret it in the morning. He was better off just not telling Tony about it, not worrying the man with something else, Steve was perfectly fine and could handle his own problems-
As Tony smirked at Steve's words, Steve wrapped his arm around Tony's chest, feeling comforted by the warmth that he brought. Despite the layer of stickiness that covered them both, neither felt like moving out the embrace that felt like it had been coming for years.
“Trust me, I want every part of you, Tony. I mean that in every sense. I’ve wanted this for so long, that at this point, there is no way I could go back. I’m yours, fully and completely.”
Tony resumed making the open-mouthed kisses that he had been giving to Steve before, except for this time, they weren't along his jaw - they were right next to his erection, which was steadily growing by the seconds.
"Are you feeling ok? You don't look too decent. It's not that you don't still look like a god, you do, just a very tired and slightly mentally beaten up one." Looking back at Tony, Steve picked up on the concerned look that Tony was giving him.
"As much as I enjoy the feeling of what you're doing, you need something more tonight. I want to take care of you. If you'd be so kind to move a bit so I could wiggle out from under you, we could get each other properly undressed and I could suck your cock. That is, if you want to do more than just hump each other..." While Tony had a slight smirk on his face when he spoke the words, especially with the end part, Steve knew there was more to it. Tony hadn't forgotten what had led them to this position; he still wanted to do something to comfort Steve from his nightmares.
"Steve, wait-
"Yeah?"
"Nightmares."
"Do you have any idea of why I would be in your nightmares, especially ones like these?"
"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I don't think I'm in love with you." Steve felt his world come crashing down around him. He'd been wrong, and now Tony was going to think he was some disgusting person who had lusted after Tony for years.
"Fuck, Tony, I'm going to come-" As he attempted to pull out again, Tony just pulled Steve right back in. Steve moaned in euphoria as he came, his cum filling up Tony's mouth. He felt like he kept coming for an eternity, although he knew it just had to have been a few seconds. It just felt that
"Couldn't sleep. I was heading down to get some food, but when I heard the music, I had a feeling I wasn't alone in being awake."
Simply put, Tony was his dream.
Steve opened his eyes again, and looked at Tony. There was a weird look in his eyes, like he was processing multiple emotions at once.
"Holy shit, Tony. That's hot." Tony's face lit up at Steve's response, as if he hadn't been sure how Steve would react.
Tony moaned at Steve’s words, and the look at he gave Steve let him know just what Tony was promising. Tony was giving Steve all of himself - and that had truly started with their first kiss.
"Does that matter?"
"The serum effected
"Yes, Steve, I came in my pants like a fucking teenager, from watching you come. The last time I did that was when I was an
"Hey, Tony?"
As of late, almost every single nightmare had focused on Tony. Steve knew that there were a multitude of reasons that this could be for; Steve's relationship with Tony was unlike any other one that he had. There was no one else who Steve could simultaneously both constantly be pissed off about and yet feel such a strong sense of fondness.
part of you, didn't it. My God, Steve." Steve's cock was slightly longer than the average person, but it was beyond thick. With every moment that Tony stared at it, it seemed to get larger and larger, to where Tony realized just how lucky he was not to have a gag reflex.
"If dreams and nightmares often feature certain people, then it means that you're thinking about those people a lot. Maybe worrying about them more than you should. Figuring out why those people are always on your mind could help get rid of the nightmares."
"Hips up, love." Steve had been so high on the pleasure that he hadn't even realized that Tony had been starting to pull his boxers down. As Tony pulled them to the ground, the look he gave Steve's cock could be described as nothing less than pure starvation, as if he had been waiting a lifetime for what was finally right in front of him.
Maybe after years of Steve telling himself that his attraction was only one-sided, it wasn't after all.
Apparently, that world was Steve's.
teenager, I think."
"I love you too, Tony."
"Do you want my mouth on your cock, baby? To be able to thrust into my wet and tight heat, while my tongue swirls around your slit?" Steve nodded, incapable of words.
"I've been having really bad nightmares for months, Tony. Ones of everyone dying, and that I'm always responsible for their deaths. I'm supposed to be the leader and protect them, but I can't, and I watch them die brutal and horrible deaths. Shit, Tony, they scare me so much, because they're such a real possibility."
"Yeah, with those lyrics, I'm sure you definitely wouldn't mind company." Steve realized what had just come out of his mouth only moments after he had said it - moments too late.
"How do you want this to go?"
Steve reached to take off Tony's tank, but Tony's hand reached out and grasped Steve's wrist, stopping him.
fucking stop.” Steve was grinding his body on top of Tony's, consistently thrusting so that their covered lengths would touch.
