People stared as Dean allowed himself to be shoved back out the door.  Stared when the strange, blue eyed man looked over his shoulder at them all.  Stared as Dean grabbed Castiel by the wrist before he could get in the car.
Something had been off about Cas for a long time – ever since they’d gotten Rowena to lift her curse from him, he hadn’t been right.
Dean's back was still carefully turned and his movements were soft and deliberate.  The cupboard hardly made a noise when he grabbed the tin of coffee grounds and closed the door.
“Ok,” Sam sounded very much like he was quickly trying to wrap his brain around the ridiculousness of the situation.  “Ok.  Give me some more details.  What did you and Cas tell them?”
“That’s ok, Cas, I’m coming to get you.”  There were people talking in the background.  Laughing between the sound of knives and forks on plates.  “You did great, buddy, I’m gonna come get you now.”
to each other.  It's a safety thing, knowing one of their own is close by in case shit hits the fan.  They're pack animals -”
want to know who barbarically enslaved your angel?” Crowley looked between them and, judging by the budding look of disbelieving realisation, he could see through their poor attempts to hide their guilt.
“I know you're having a hard time with this,” Dean said, letting one hand leave Cas' shoulder to settle on the side of his neck.  “And I can't even begin to understand what your going through.  But Hannah told us some stuff last night and it...I think I'm starting to understand a little better.  But you gotta be straight with me, Cas.  With
Castiel bristled at the comparison, and at the evidence the brothers had been discussing him while he wasn’t around and comparing him to birds.  Instead of lecturing them about the many reasons he was
When he felt the hunter start dabbing tenderly at the drying blood on his shoulder with an alcohol swab, Castiel could not help but look over.
Confused, mostly.  Which explained a lot about most of Cas’ very limited range of facial expressions.
There was no response to his question and he didn't need to turn on the light – they'd tried that once and it hadn't gone over well – to know that Cas wasn't truly in the room anymore.
Dean's heart beat frantically at his ribs and heat rushed to his face when he felt Castiel's arms slip around his chest, wrapping all the way around until he felt Cas' hand grip his shoulder tightly, right over the same spot his grace brand used to be.
It was cold, but not dangerously so.  As long as they kept moving, Dean was sure he wouldn’t get too chilly.
Even though he'd been immobilized and in agony every second for years and years and years he'd never stopped trying to get away, had never been
The two of them headed back to the motel, shuffling into the room and locking the door, double checking it before silently shedding their dirty clothes.  Cas was down to his jeans before he fell back onto his bed, but when he gave a sudden, sharp cry of pain, Dean rushed over.
For a while Castiel laid there, unable to do much else.  But the less slippery time got, the more agitated his grace became.  He fought against the bonds even though he knew it would only hurt more if he did.  Like a rabbit in a snare, he was only making it worse by struggling.
But Dean didn't care.  They'd been fighting all their lives and now it was time to have some good.  And he'd show Cas just how
Dean snapped to attention so quickly he worried he might have pulled something, but he forced himself to stay in his chair, made himself stay still and take a moment to look Cas over.
Castiel quickly reached out with one hand and pressed two fingers to the center of Sam’s forehead, bowing his head and closing his eyes in concentration while Dean kept his brother upright.
The most peculiar thing happened then.  All the little tiny feathers along the leading edges of Cas' wings rose up, like how a person’s hair stands on end when they get goosebumps, and Dean was caught halfway between wanting to smile and wanting keep his face perfectly straight.  He didn't know what that reaction meant, but if he had to guess, it was either embarrassment or Castiel felt threatened.
been created with the ability to feel.  That once upon a time it was natural for them to.  But a few hundred million years of knowing the exact opposite was probably warring for validity in Castiel's mind.  He was trying to reconcile what Hannah had told him was true with what he'd known all his life and the two concepts weren't meshing at all.
Dean looked to Cas, wondering if the word meant anything to him.  He was glad he'd come to know the angel so well, otherwise he would not have been able to read the micro-expressions on his face: a flash of recognition in his blue eyes and a curious frown.
It was well into the night, the moons hanging high in a crisp and cloudless sky, when they first spotted the Windhelm stables over the crest of a hill.  It has a spit of flickering light, likely from a window or two, but it was a destination in the dark and the sight of it renewed their energy a bit.
“I…” Dean swallowed.  “I just want you to be comfortable.  You look…” he cleared his throat like he was gargling rocks.  “Here, just…”
“Wake me if Cas comes around too,” his brother mumbled, stretching out on his front right in the dirt and arranging his bag under his head.
Instead, Dean glared moodily over at Sam and made a somewhat violent gesture in Castiel’s general direction.
Immediately, Dean walked away a few paces, his breathing ragged and his heart pounding.  Now that there was no danger of it further upsetting Castiel, Dean had no reason not to let his anger at the absolute
Cas was sprawled on his stomach on one of the beds, but sat up with his hair sticking out every which way to glared through narrowed eyes, obviously trying his best to stay focused.
The smell of the fire mingled with the mouth-watering scent of a home cooked meal and Dean felt his neglected stomach rumble angrily, demanding attention.
He should have called Crowley the second Cas had consented to the deal.  But he’d felt almost dirty, even with Cas’ consent, at the idea of going through with it and he’d put it off, hoping he could think of something
It continued, in short intervals and then longer pitches and falls that all rolled together into something that made no sense at all beyond the fact that some pitches kept repeating themselves. The longer he listened, the more a pattern began to emerge and he scrambled to pull all his pieces back together.
Jessy and Cesar threw their heads back and laughed and Sam had to cover his mouth to keep from spitting his sandwhich out.  Cas jumped at the sudden explosion of laughter but then he smiled tentatively, the same smile he always had when he didn’t know why people were laughing but happy they were all the same.
“Look, your badges are super cool and everything,” the young man said, “But rules are rules and there’s paperwork involved in releasing an
On the far side of the pit, a man in a brown tunic and a thick leather belt and green pants was plucking away on a strange looking string instrument that looked like a double-necked violin, and a few people were sitting on benches and chairs around the roaring fire with metal steins in their hands.  A few small tables with chairs were scattered along either wall and to the right of the fire pit, Dean saw the long wooden bar with a few empty stools placed in front of it.
– he could push things away indefinitely.  He could shove away hurt and sadness and loneliness and know that they would never come back.  Now, he could still push them away, but it was like throwing a ball in the air; it always came back, falling harder and faster and crashing in to him painfully when he was least prepared to deal with it.
“I’d like to know,” Sam continued gently, sincere. “If you’re comfortable telling me.  Even if you’re worried I might not understand.”
He let the truth of it pull legitimate frustration and worry into his expression and had to make sure he didn’t seem too eager when her smile slipped away and her brow furrowed.
There was a rusted machete by his foot and Dean plucked it from the ground, swinging it with everything he had just as the enraged demon lept forward. The sound of it's head hitting the dirty floor was more than satisfying and Dean sneered down at the corpse.
He took a deep breath, trying to picture Cas’ calm face.  Cas was always so even under pressure, nothing seemed to rattle the guy – nothing except cops bullying him into near flashbacks of torture.
Because Dean was alive and Sam was missing and Castiel was going to…do something about it.  What, exactly, he’d figure out later.  Step one was figuring out where he’d been banished to in the first place.
Cas had finally started being able to sleep for several hours at a time without being woken up screaming from nightmares and it had done all three of them some good. Sam and Dean hadn't gotten much more sleep than Cas over the last month. They were no strangers to nightmares themselves but when Cas woke up, so did they. There was no way to sleep through an angel screaming; it thundered through the concrete walls like a low grade explosion.
No matter what Dean talks about, Cas always listens intently, blue eyes soft while he sips his coffee.
"You should sleep too, Cas," Dean said, eyeing the plain ring on the angel's finger.  "You didn't get that boost from that nasty potion like we did and you healed Sam.  I know you’re feeling it."
“Yeah, this is bad.”  Sam took a deep breath and let it all out in a whoosh.  “Ok, we need to do damage control on this before it gets even more out of hand.  How bad is it?  It was hard to tell with the sweater on.”
She stifled a shout when she looked up from her ever-present clipboard, her face paling further under the fluorescent lights.
that might be helpful.  The thought of just being idle with everything that was going on made him anxious.  So, he scrolled through the list of articles he had yet to read and the one on mindfulness was one he had been putting off since Sam sent it to him.
The angel offered one of his half smiles.  “Of course,” he started down the hill and the brothers followed.  “The giants won't bother us as long as we don't get too close to them or their fire,” he told them confidently, even though Dean couldn't see a fire anywhere.
Eventually, after Dean had added the leeks and the cabbage, he spooned some of the soup into three wooden bowls.
So he turned his head, felt the sadness that had been clawing at him for months finally back off a bit when he saw Cas, clear and lucid and soft around the edges for the first time since he'd woken up three and a half weeks ago.
It made Dean wonder if Sam was looking for a hunt just to shut him up.  He found he really didn't care either way.
“We don't even know how many people are in there,” Dean said.  “And are we killing or just incapacitating?”
Sam merely nodded, looking exhausted and troubled.  With a last, worried glance at Castiel, Sam shuffled out of the room.
right next to the elves and the dragons.  “Ok...what other races or species are there that we should know about?”
Dean’s fancy blue metal goblet was nearly empty when an Elven woman approached them and sat on the edge of the fireplace next to Cas, evidently unbothered by the heat.
“God...”  Cas licked his lips, his smile small and fond, “There are rather a lot of things that exist.  No
Cas looked between them curiously, unhooking the bow from his back and tossing his quiver of arrows onto a nearby bed.  "What's wrong?"
He thought of all those times, after Cas had first woken up, that he had tried to tell Cas just what he meant to them.
Castiel lifted one of his wings, leaning more heavily onto the other, and stretched it out to the side with a grimace like it had cramped.  All around the big, bony joint Dean could see that the feathers were wet and sandy, matted in a way he knew the angel would likely find irritating once his focus shifted from the task at hand.  But then Cas folded the wing back and pressed the ball of the joint back into the ground and kept digging.
“You gotta use English, buddy,” Dean told him quietly, his voice was tight, like he was in pain. “We don't understand Enochian.”
"You know, maybe you should just hang tight in Seattle for a few days anyway and I'll head up there.  I'll be good as new by then," Sam was saying.  "They have good coffee in Seattle, you know."
His grace swelled inside him, tearing itself like pulled stitches and Castiel gasped with the pain of it, back hitting the wall.  He let himself sink to the floor, breathing harshly with the effort of controlling himself, but when he leaned his head back against the wall, the plaster cracked, a fissure spiking upwards like ice breaking over a lake.  Another deep breath and electricity arced between the microwave and coffee maker, blowing them both off the counter in a spray of sparks that had the brothers cursing and jumping out of harms way.
responsibilities the Dragonborn had or if it would give them away as aliens immediately.  It seemed like not knowing about the Dragonborn on this planet was like not knowing who Albert Einstein was on Earth, and they didn't want to be setting off anyone's red flags.
was terribly wrong…but not knowing what.  And then, as soon as he laid eyes on the source of the wrongness, the pain had brought him to his knees.
Cas shifted in his seat, one hand coming up to move over his mouth, fingertips dragging over his lips in a way Dean had come to realize was a nervous tick.
Cas had sounded near delirious in his panic.  His fear had been raw and primal in a way Dean had never heard.  In a way that, up until now, he had assumed the angel wasn’t capable of feeling.
One corner of Cas' mouth curled up and he huffed a laugh through his nose, eyes closing briefly.  There was obviously another layer to Hannah's question, hinting at a story or experience only the two of then shared.
They circled the house until they found an opening in the stone that looked like it might have been a door once and found a middle-aged man standing in the middle of the remains of a living room, in front of a smouldering fire that was putting out more smoke than warmth.
They'd been over this before, but it still made Dean's stomach drop whenever Cas lamented the loss of his healing powers.
They kept talking to him, kept asking him questions even though words had lost meaning again for the moment. He wished they would leave him alone for a while, he no sooner had managed to pull himself together long enough to respond to them then they were asking him to do it again.
like he had.  As it turned out, his body was whole, though he felt like he’d been hit by a truck. He was impressed with the illusion; it had certainly felt real.  Even knowing it wasn’t, Castiel was sure he would respond the same way if it happened again.
Castiel was eager to get outside and into the open air and stretch, his muscles stiff and sore from the serpent’s corrections and the tension that had been thrumming through him.  But, of course, it was not to be, because when they came to the war room, Mary was standing at the center of it looking shaken.
“It's ok, man, we got lots more where that came from,” Dean assured him with an easy smile spreading thickly under his troubled eyes.  He turned his back and resettled the coffee maker in it's place on the counter, leaving the microwave on the floor by the fridge.
He pushed at Cas’ shoulders, swallowing around the hard lump in his throat.  Cas laid back on the bed, pliant and docile, his gaze glassy again - like a doll.
He tried to move again, and this time he was more successful. He jerked his whole arm free of what was likely bloody claws or knives or hooks and ended up twisting his torso with the strength of the movement.
“Castiel is young, by angelic standards.  One of the youngest, actually.  And he was created out of necessity rather than love.  Our father needed more soldiers and so he made them.  What resulted from that was a wave of brand-new fledglings that did not have the luxury of time to be taught just
How had it come to this?  In just ten short years he’d gone from being one of Heaven’s highest-ranking commanders, mobilizing vast angelic armies and developing and deploying successful strategies to keep his father’s creations safe…to
He was doing good, he thought, with the 'being direct' thing.  It was easier than he thought it would be.  But then he looked back up at Cas and saw incomprehension written all over the angel's face.
He found Sam still sitting in the library, in front of his laptop now, with an intense frown and his fingers resting over his lips thoughtfully.
Dean watched his wings shift but didn't try to linger too close and instead went to the dresser and leaned against it, crossing his ankles and taking a careful sip of the still steaming coffee. On the bed, Cas made a content little noise in the back of his throat, the sound deep and rumbling as he curled his fingers around the warm mug and swallowed his first mouthful, seemingly uncaring of the high temperature. Dean shamelessly stared over the rim of his own cup, taking in details he hadn't noticed because of the enormous wings taking up all his attention.
Curling an arm around the dip in Cas' spine, Dean pressed one last kiss.  “Feeling any better about this whole 'feelings' thing yet?”
Cas' eyes were the exact same color as the water past the drop off and just as easy to drown himself in, if he wasn't careful.
Dean and Sam followed as Cas passed under the tree and the three of them spared a glance for a man yelling about some guy named Talos and how great he was in front of a statue that looked an awful lot like a cross.  Behind the cross, was a ten-foot-tall stone statue of a warrior sporting an elaborate winged helmet, chainmail, and a heavy cloak.  The statue of the man held a massive great sword to his chest, the point angled down towards the earth.
"On your way to Kynesgrove?"  the man asked them, folding his arms over the lip of the spring like it was a pool deck. Dirt clung to his wet arms but he didn't seem to care.  He was older, maybe in his late forties, and had a clean-shaven face and strong jaw.  The dark hair on top of his head was as thick as the hair on his arms and eyebrows.
Perhaps it was knowing that, if it weren't for Cas, he and his brother might just be dead.  Already.  After their very first encounter with another intelligent species.
There was a last-minute compromise when Dean pushed his concerns and they decided to skirt around the north-western edge of the blank space, and then were off, leaving a few more coins on the table for Gilfre to find.
Sam looked like he was going to be sick and Dean felt his own stomach drop heavily in response.  Sam was right.  There was something very wrong about the thought.  Something dirty and vile about the idea of taking something from a creature made of light and giving it to one made a darkness.
it.  An angel’s wings are more than just…arms.  They are our greatest weapon and our greatest weakness.  We use them to communicate, to touch, to comfort, and to kill.  There aren’t words in any language that can explain what it means to have lost them…let alone to have regained them.  I…” he cast around for the best word to describe how he had been feeling.
“Yeah,” Dean confirmed, quick and sharp with another look over his shoulder.  “Normally angels hide their wings in the ether just for practicality but Cas had some issues while he was healing at first and it was…easier for him to have them on
“Who is that?” he asked, because he figured he was supposed to, redundant though it seemed – obviously if Dean trusted her she was probably alright.
"Do you want something to eat, Castiel?"  Thorygg asked, standing.  "We have some bread and cheese left."
Dean went back to the stove and Castiel heaved himself out of his chair, feeling all of him protest the simple action, and moved to stand beside the hunter.
to walk barefoot down a hallway full of glass.  Because it hadn’t occurred to him that the brothers would come to him.
It was as good an answer as any, but Dean didn't really case; he never wanted Cas to hide his wings again because it made Dean's heart soar to know that he trusted him and Sam enough to be himself around them.
Unable to tell who they may be allied with, the trio merely nodded to them and moved on to avoid conversation.
The fire was still going strong – Cas had obviously kept it stoked through the night – and Dean huddled closer to it, holding his hands out towards the heat, surprised he hadn’t woken given that shivers were now making his teeth clack together.  He’d just been that exhausted he supposed.
He stared at the side of Cas’ face.  His voice was gravelly and raw from vomiting and it looked as if the last of his strength had been used to toss the one thing that might have given him a bit more.
Worst of all, Dean thought, was the times when none of them said anything at all.  They just sat and let their mental wounds fester and rot.  And the more Dean forced himself to think about it, the more he realized that Team Free Will’s silences had begun to outweigh their voices.
Sam's face brightened when he managed to stab it, holding it up for Dean and Cas to inspect with him.
“I find it difficult.  This.  Talking.  Explaining things that I am feeling that I was not given the ability to understand because I was never meant to.  I do not
It was the three humans across from him who looked like they’d just been through something traumatic.
"Good evening," the woman behind the counter greeted them kindly enough – until Cas came through the door behind them and her expression turned colder than the wind outside.
Dean closed his eyes and took a deep breath, feeling overwhelmed and saying as much.  “This is just…a lot a heavy shit.  And I just don’t know where to start.  This Biblical stuff keeps getting crazier and crazier…not to mention more depressing.  No wonder angels are so messed up.”
“But Cas managed to get away, though it wasn’t easy.  And I think angels would probably be a lot more like him if they could get away too.  So I can’t speak for all angels, ‘cause I only care about the one.”  He grinned, because no one could see him anyway.  “Cas is pretty quiet and crazy smart.  He’s got the biggest god damn heart of anyone I know and spends most of his time trying to help the little guy.”  He thought of all the days he’d spent in the woods with Cas, just watching him pour grace into the soil, watching the trees strengthen and grow, watching the little ground cover plants sprout under his hand.  Watching the way Cas smiled.  “He doesn’t understand pop culture references and never really got the hang of using a computer.  He’s…”
It had obviously just finished raining before they arrived.  The hardy grass and scraggly brown shrubs were dark and damp and the smell of saturated wood and wet earth was heavy in the cold, humid air.  As they walked, grass whipped against their leather boots and in some areas it was tall enough to soak their pant legs.  In the dark, it was hard to see where their feet were landing before they made contact with the ground and progress was slow as they picked their way through the clumps of foliage and occasional exposed rock, careful not to twist their ankles or fall.
Then Dean was alone, standing there staring at Cas and wondering how someone so familiar could feel like such a stranger.
On the other side of his wing, out of sight, but no less present, Dean huffed.  It was impossible to tell what that meant.
Cas seemed to take a moment to contemplate Dean’s words and, after a moment, a shy and ridiculously cute little smile stretched Cas’ full lips.  Dean felt himself grinning in response, because, above all,
So, he laid there, flexing and relaxing over and over, sure that it was the fangs imbedded in his brain that had scrambled his thoughts so thoroughly.  He tried to calm himself with a vivid fantasy of sinking his claws into the world serpent’s fat coils and stripping the meat from its bones.
It had started with talking – if you could call it that – about John Winchester and had ended with them storming away from each other and slamming their bedroom doors.
Cas was staring at Liam with cautious intrigue.  Perhaps as impressed with Liam’s ability to translate for him so accurately as the brothers were.
“What do you think I am doing when I 'zap' you places?  I am flying you from point A to point B in the etheric plane,” Cas explained patiently.  “The reason I can move so fast is because there is no gravity and no air – much like space – but we're flying such short distances that the lack of oxygen is not a concern.”
But then the now familiar rumbling stopped him with it's sudden reappearance. It was different this time, the vibrations high and close together and...urgent. He could read urgency within the sounds and it made him pause, made him start to pull back a few chunks of grace just so he might be able to figure out this sudden oddity.
Dean felt his eyebrows climbing and huffed a laugh, looking over at Sam, who had a similar expression on his face.  “And I thought
The three of them kept moving, following Cas, who weaved between the trees like a shadow despite the huge wings hugging his back.  Dean watched him whenever he wasn't busy watching the ground for stray roots looking to trip him, and studiously took in how Cas would glide past tress and saplings, disturbing the foliage no more than a breeze would.  His booted feet left no imprints in the soft earth and dead leaves coating the forest floor and barely a sound was made by the angel at all.  If Dean closed his eyes, it would be like Cas wasn't even there.
As they pushed deeper through the mountain pass, the trees thinned and disappeared, and there was nothing left but the occasional scraggly bush, mangled from the constant wind, and hunks of rock that had broken away from the mountains centuries ago and tumbled into the road below.
It was cosy and quiet but Dean followed his brother and his angel back out to the common room all the same and the three of them claimed three comfortable stuffed chairs next to the fireplace.  For now, Dean forced himself not to glare around at every person in the room and instead focused his attention on warming up and making sure no one came too close to Cas.
"No." Dean swallowed bile, his hand shaking as he grabbed at Cas' thigh, squeezing hard enough to hurt. "That's not an option. Tell me what to do to
“Agreed,” Sam intoned with a small smile tilting his lips.  He looked fondly between his brother and Cas for a second before his gaze turned stern. “But the next place we stay will have doors on the cabins.”
Their lunch at the inn was quick – soft bread and a chunk of meat, the origin of which neither Sam or Dean chose to question, and a mug of mulled wine – then they were bidding Hulda goodbye and heading for the city gates.
“About a days walk directly South of Riverwood, which is only a couple hours up into that valley over there.
They had to brush aside a few stray branches hanging over the path to avoid getting hit in the face and a few weeks ago Dean would have been down there with clippers and a saw.  But now he knew he'd face the angel's wrath if he so much as mentioned cutting the plants back off the trail.
Coming to stand next to Cas, Dean could feel the heat of the fire at his back, radiating through his thin tunic.
“...makes Narfi very, very sad.  Narfi needs Reyda to say goodbye.”  He turned to look Cas in the eye.  “If...if you see Reyda, tell her Narfi misses her and tell her to come home soon.” He nodded firmly.
Behind them, Dean eyed the two tents and cold fire pit on the opposite side of the pool., but turned his attention back to Cas and the two strangers he was suddenly in the company of.  He and Sam made their way over to the edge of the water, still too far away to make out what the two people were saying to Cas but it was obvious they were urging the angel to join them.
It had been, but Castiel was sure Liam didn’t need him to say it out loud.  Instead, he tried to do what Sam and Dean had asked of him before, and explain what it felt like.  Perhaps, with the added help of being able to read his colors, Liam may be able to understand.
Dean stared, searching the angel's face closely.  There was something big there, hiding in that answer, and he was itching with curiosity.  But the angel's tone warned of a dark story, memories Cas likely didn't want to relive at the moment, so he refrained from asking and instead slapped his hands down on the armrests of his chair.
They followed the road through the small settlement.  On their left, they passed the wood mill.  There was a man with sharp features and even sharper eyes watching over a long tree trunk that was being pulled into a track that lead to a massive saw blade.  There were chains wrapped around the wood, a system of pullies powered by the water wheel in the river, sluggishly pulling the giant log in to place.
The inn was larger than one would expect, given that it was in the middle of nowhere at a three-way intersection of the roads.  Cas kept grumbling about his wings still being wet and stoked a huge fire in their room, huddling close and fanning his wings as much as the enclosed space would allow while the brothers went to fetch some food.
Not anymore, Dean thought bitterly.  Cas rarely spoke these days unless he was asked a direct question.  He’d learned that staying quiet was safer when it came to the Winchesters.
“Mine isn't the same kind of love.” He'd come this far and he was damn well going to make sure Cas understood exactly what he meant. “It's not like how I love Sam or even how you love Sam, it's -”
Liam, mercifully ignoring his open-faced surprise, clapped his hands together with an encouraging smile, “Now, given all that, I think it best if perhaps we do this introduction outside, do you agree?”
“Hey, wait!”  Dean called, jogging out onto the sand.  It was so wet and compact that it nearly felt like running on pavement.
Dean's green eyes started to look a little glossy and the man nodded, his lips twitching. “Yeah, Cas, that's me,” he choked.
They pressed on, catching themselves as they slipped on wet prarie grass and occasionally having to stop and tear their tunic free of brambles.  After just a few more minutes of slogging their way across the rugged terrain, they discovered that the spot they had glimpsed earlier wasn't just a water-logged dip in the ground but the bend in a creek.  The shallow body of water was less than ten feet across and was flowing lazily.
The grace spilling from the fresh wound was brighter than the lamp and Sam’s face looked pale and drawn, lit from underneath like he was holding a flashlight under his chin.  Sam gave Cas’ shoulder a squeeze, telling him he did great and that it was over for another day.
“Nobody does, Cas,” Sam tried to assure him, but the wide grin on his face killed most of the sincerity behind it.
Cas, having decided the brothers had had enough time to stare around with their mouths hanging open, started up the street and, as he followed, Dean's head turned this way and that, trying to take in everything all at once.
Across the back seat from Cas, was Hannah, gazing out her own window, her eyes on the darkening sky much like Cas' were, but with a little smile tilting her lips and her head resting back against the seat.
the rot on its tongue.  Castiel had been bound before; he’d been under the effects of spells, curses, and any number of magics.  None of it had felt like this.
“This is like last time, isn't it, Cas?”  Dean asked him.  “This is like a couple weeks ago when you froze up before we left the bunker.”  He wasn't asking anymore.
“How many times?”  Dean asked.  He looked like he was scared of the answer, but determination had hardened his gaze.
Sam got to his feet, arms still crossed and a scowl etched into his face, and stomped off towards the creek, presumably to splash some water on his face.
It wasn’t what Castiel had meant by ‘tired’ but he chose not to correct the man.  He didn’t sleep.  He didn’t
Cas turned away from her with his chin in the air, his wings flicking, feathers lifting prim and haughty in a way that was definitely meant to provoke Hannah's ire and Sam snorted beside him.
He lifted his arm over his shoulder and blindly positioned the point of the blade over his fourth rib, right next to his spine.  He’d hoped the pain of his grace being strangled might distract from the pain of the incision he was making.
Castiel’s expression cleared now that the thing was no longer screaming and he watched it now, instead of the flowers, letting his free hand dip into the water at his side, absently wiggling his fingers.
Blue eyes flicked between both of them, a touch of sympathy there.  “I will fly as hard and fast as I can, but it will still take me between twelve and fourteen minutes to reach Nirn.  Just so you are aware and can prepare yourselves.”
He'd tried asking Cas about them, asking why he was keeping his wings out now when he never had before, but all he got were confused head tilts and answers that didn't make much sense to him.
; knowing that no matter what planet they'd been born on that they'd have to deal with the same shit and that there were other people and other species going through the same things.
Dean stood, scrubbing his eyes viciously, and grabbed the angel's bare shoulder. The skin under his hand was cold but he shook the man anyway.
With another sigh that he knew was over-dramatic, he slouched down in the uncomfortable wooden chair until he could lean his head against the back and stare up at the fan above him, it's dusty old blades spinning slow and lazy.
Dean tentatively brought the rim of the bowl to his lips and tasted, humming when he discovered it had actually turned out pretty good.
Cas was silent and Dean almost moved to pull his hand away but then felt Cas' fingers skittering over his knuckles and he froze, scared to move, as if Cas was a skittish animal that might run away if he moved too suddenly.
Dean swung his sword around, the weight of the steel making it feel like he was moving under water.  His attempt was also casually knocked aside and when the green man grinned at him, it revealed a row of sharp teeth.
A niggling of guilt wormed its way into Castiel’s chest as the four of them walked the dark hallways.  No one mentioned the mess.
As the years kept passing and Castiel kept leaving just like Dean was wordlessly telling him to, and then coming back like Dean longed for, Dean withdrew even more without really knowing why. Now he wondered if it wasn't just the sheer magnitude of what that meant, to have an angel choose you over and over and over again.
But Liam regarded him shrewdly from overtop his glasses.  “From what you described to me, that was a horrifically traumatising experience for all three of you.  Given both their ingrained need to please you both
“And you, considering I never thought I would again.”  Castiel had to remind himself not to hug the fragile human back as hard as he wanted and pulled away sooner than he’d have liked to.  Dean was warm and solid and
“Oh, well if you like soft stuff I got another pair of those.  Never even worn them!”  he turned to rummage through the drawer again, “When we first moved in I thought the bunker was gonna be super cold so I got a couple pairs of these but never really used them.”
The door to the tavern slammed opened and Castiel strode out, moving swiftly down the stairs, wings arched stiffly behind his back as if he was ready to take flight at any moment.  He strode past the brothers, with an urgent, “Follow me.  Quickly!” hissed out the corner of his mouth.
The spruce trees all around the path were tall and straight, reaching up to where the tufty tops could feel the sun and leaving their trunks bare save for a few scraggly, dead branches and scruffy Old Man’s Beard moss.  There were a few sleepy bird calls echoing through the trees from chickadees and sparrows – which Castiel had taken the time to teach him one long afternoon a few weeks ago.  Down by their feet on either side of the path, ferns and fiddle heads whipped at their ankles from time to time, smearing their pants with cold water.
“Ok, it’s ok,” Dean told him cradling the back of Cas’ head.  He thanked god for small miracles and told himself to at least be grateful that Cas’ shoulder wasn’t causing him pain at the moment.
“Leeks!  Can you believe it?  We're on another planet in another galaxy and they have one of the same vegetables that we do!  Ha!”  he shoved the steamed, butter-coated plant into his mouth, chewing around a smile.
After several seconds passed and Cas said nothing else, Dean folded his arms and leaned his hip against the edge of the table, trying to figure out the best way to coax the information out of his friend.
Like there was a stain at the end of their gun that they were itching to blast off the face of the earth.
He'd intended to ask Sam or Dean how to deal with it the last time this had happened, but a good time had never seemed to come up.  It was hard to ask them something he knew would make them worried when they'd been smiling so much recently.  And, he supposed, he wanted to believe he wouldn't
“Cas…” his name whistled weakly from Dean’s throat and the hunter cleared it aggressively, shaking his head to dispel something unwanted from his thoughts.  “Cas, we would
He stumbled back into the nearest corner like a drunk, legs feeling like lead and wings reflexively spreading for balance.  But they hit the walls and he pitched sideways – somewhat ungracefully – his center of gravity far from where he was used to it being, and crumbled to the floor in the corner of his bedroom.
“How are you both so warm?” he grumbled as the intro credits rolled on the tv.  He sounded exactly as jealous as he felt and did nothing to hide it.  “I’m always cold.  I
He supposed, in the grand scheme of things, a bit more blood on the floor wasn’t that big a deal.  Not when Castiel was standing with his wings spread, grace shining from the self-inflicted wound over his chest and through his eyes.  Blood seemed fairly tame in comparison.  The brothers likely wouldn’t even notice it.
Cas tightened his fingers around his mug like he was thinking about lifting it to his mouth, or resisting the urge to crush it, but said nothing.
Once they'd stuffed their pockets, the trio found a map of the entire province on a table by the door and, after a quick glance, rolled it up and secured it under one of the straps across Sam's back.
Now Liam looked as if he thought Sam might be joking.  Given the seriousness of the situation, he also looked annoyed about it.  “Angels eat.  Of course they eat.  They’re living creatures.”
The urge to pray was becoming stronger again, and he flicked his wing in irritation.  For whatever reason, and by whatever forces – he was starting to doubt that force was his Father – he had been given this gift and he wished he could just be happy about it.
.'  Though he supposed it wasn't nearly as strange now that he knew how many other intelligent species there really were.  Humans were just one of many.
The old ink, worn off the stiff, brittle paper in some places, sat placidly under his gaze.  Those words had nowhere to be, Castiel told himself, they had sat in that book for hundreds of years and would continue to sit there and exist for a hundred more.  He thought of closing the book and doing it later but was reluctant to face Sam's unimpressed face.  It made him feel guilty, much like his disappointed face or his annoyed face or that face he made when he wanted someone to do something for him.
Sam looked around desperately, trying to spot this city Cas had mentioned, but there wasn't a thing in sight except grass and shrubs and a few big boulders.
So, he tried instead to let those thoughts go, and concentrated on accepting that this was just what was happening.  He didn’t
“Ok, man you're really freaking us out, ok?”  Dean said, still standing safely in the doorway.  Behind him, Sam was hovering anxiously again.  “Just...just talk to us.  Tell us what's going on -”
He'd been wondering because while it seemed like some things – the state of the civil war, for instance – were just as the angel remembered them, Cas seemed not to know any of the city or province names and it left Dean wondering how much time had passed.  Civil wars could last through generations but changing the name of a city or territory happened even less often.
was injured, Cas, he needed your grace way more than I did.  This is just some bruises.  I’ll be fine, quit…hovering.”
as an order, he always seemed to kind of struggle with…something.  Like he consciously has to think about what he wants to do instead of just…doing it.  Almost like he’s fighting the impulse to immediately comply and has to actually think for a second to –“
God would be able to take credit for all of it,” he shrugged, “Though some try.  It is more common, as it is with my Father, that it is the fanatical followers who claim such impossible things.”
.  I am worried for him but…I have to look after myself and my business.  I do not want the Thieves Guild to come looking for him here.  I have tried to help him in the past but his safety is not my responsibility!"
Here she paused again, and Dean tried to follow along with the story, but was having a hard time with all the strange names of people and places he knew nothing about.  He kept glancing at Cas, noting the angel’s hardening posture.
Sleep was slow to leave him, which was unusual in itself.  Normally he was asleep and then he was just…awake.  Sometimes he was already running before he even realized it.
Boisterous applause and a few encouraging whistles followed the end of the song and then everyone sat back down as the bard started strumming out a more melodic tune, meant to fill in the background noise of the chatting and laughing, while people went to refill their cups.
When he straightened himself again, Sam’s eyes were glassy and downcast and Dean’s anger drained away.
They towered before them, even higher than the city walls on either side.  They looked to be made of metal, which had then been reinforced with iron bars that ran from the top to the bottom and also side to side.  At the very top, Dean had to crane his neck to see, the stone wall arched over the doors and there were three massive eagle heads glaring down at them, beaks open in a silent screech and eyes carved in purposefully menacing detail.
Soon enough his smile dropped away and he folded his wings close to his back.  It was impossible to hide them now.  Though they contained a small amount of his grace, he could not shove them back across the etheric barrier without access to all of it.
He glanced over at his left wing and then his right, wishing he had just put up with the pain instead of alienating himself even more.  It was already obvious to everyone he met that he wasn’t
Castiel was mostly fueled by a burst of pure rage when he lunged forward faster than Mary’s human eyes could register.  A niggling pull to
Had he been injured in battle?  Was he lying vulnerable on the war field while the medics tried to help him, pinning him down because he was trying to fight them? It wouldn’t be the first time, but he could never remember having this dizzying sense of disorientation.  No matter how hard he tried, Castiel just couldn’t get his head to stop spinning.  On top of not being able to tell
He was glad Cas was in front of him so he couldn’t see the mirth in Dean’s eyes or the grin on his lips.
kinda funny.  He looked back over at Cas and jumped when he found the angel glaring at them both as if reading their minds.
you weren’t under a spell designed to keep you from doing exactly that, you cannot expect yourself to be able to control your emotions all the time.  Emotions are volatile, they cannot
Dean's misery was a physical thing, filling his stomach like cement. "No...Cas..." a shaky breath punched out of his chest and he placed his hand on the side of Cas' face, using his thumb to wipe a smear of blood from the corner of the angel's eye. He longed to see the deep, dark blue again, but in it's place was Rowena's poison. "We'll figure this out Cas, I'm not gonna let you die. Not after...not after everything." Not when he could
A middle-aged man stood behind an old wooden bar, beneath a collection of herbs, spices, garlic, and rabbit skins drying from hooks in the ceiling.  Behind him, from floor to ceiling, were stacked barrels of varying sizes, each with a copper tap in the end.
Dean scrambled out of the car, but Cas still had a hand on the door and was taking deep breaths through his nose, eyes closed like he was trying hard to keep control of whatever was going on in his head.
“Talk, Cas!”  Dean barked.  Ordered.  He barely sounded frightened at all.  “Tell us what's happening!”
Sam was wearing an intimidating and expensive looking suit and his hair was pulled back in a low pony tail, leaving a few pieces of hair that were too short to stay in the elastic to hang out.  It made his face look angular and sharp; that combined with the suit, his six foot, four inches of height and the way his eyes were narrowed like a cat on the hunt made his brother look like the most imposing lawyer that had probably ever set foot in this precinct.
Almost always one or both of the brothers was in the room with him. Sam's laptop pretty much had permanent residence on the dresser now and had exclusively been used for Netflix for some time. Though they had both been surprised to find out Cas held little interest in it now. They would watch Game of Thrones or The Office or any other number of things and Castiel would occasionally look up, his gaze lingering on the screen like he was making a half-hearted attempt to understand what he was looking at, before it would drop back to whatever book happened to be in his lap that day.
Sam shook his head, an incredulous look on his face.  “Well, is he ok?!  Did he say why he didn’t call?  Is –“
“We got you out of the cage three and a half months ago,” Dean continued gently. “You've been here with us since then. Try to remember, Cas.”
But Dean had to shift his focus back to his own – thankfully smaller and more human-looking – opponent.  He side-stepped a charge from the little crazy guy, the dodge requiring very little effort, and simply bashed the pommel of his sword into the back of the bandit’s greasy head, smirking when he hit the dirt like a sack of potatoes.
Briefly, something nudged at Castiel, telling him that the right thing to do in that moment might be to back down.  But that just wasn’t in his nature.  He twitched, making a solid effort to show her his back, but couldn’t manage it, instincts stopping him.
Castiel let his eyes snap sideways, to where he could make out the back of a blond head of hair in the passenger seat.
It was very strange, hearing things like that, Dean realized.  He was no stranger to apocalypses, that was for sure, but for some reason, finding out that there were similar problems all over the universe was...humbling.  He wondered if Cas could sum up the apocalypses they had dealt with so succinctly.  It didn't sound like such a big deal when it was all summarized from the point of view of an angel; it left Dean feeling disjointed and out of sorts.
But it had been years – decades – he was sure. He'd lost count, had had to pull in every ounce of his focus just to keep his mind from splintering apart. A creature of light and pureness did not belong in a place like Hell; with all its festering corruption and putrid, rancid darkness, an angel – a mere seraph – stood little chance of escaping intact – if they stood any chance of escaping at all.
When he opened his eyes, he let the calm settled into his chest, and saw that Cas had crossed the room and was standing at the bar. Dean was relived to see that no one even gave him a second look.
“Although,” Castiel suddenly said, the tone of his voice once again uncertain. “I wouldn't mind learning how to make coffee.” He blinked his big blue eyes owlishly and Dean felt his mouth go dry. “Could you teach me?”
“It’s not locked,” Liam suddenly said from the floor below.  He was staring up at Cas, watching his every move like a hawk.  “You can leave whenever you wish.”
“I thought…” her eyes were wide and unsure, flicking past the brothers to Castiel before bouncing away again.  “What happened to the lights?”
Dean peered down at the apparently magical object.  It was just a plain silver band, pretty scuffed up, the shine having long since worn off it.  It wasn't glowing or anything; there was no indication that it was magical at all.
about?” Castiel snapped, feeling no small amount of alarm.  He looked to Dean for help, but the man looked as unconcerned as ever, a stark contrast to his usual range of facial expressions any time Crowley’s name was mentioned.  Surely, they could not be so
The next time Castiel woke it was, thankfully, gentler than the last.  But after a moment, he felt a tingling up his spine and both his marginal and secondary coverts rose to attention.
With a monumental effort, Dean pushed himself to his feet, groaning when his muscles resisted.  He felt heavy, like he was full of sand.  Though he supposed it might have something to do with being on angel life support for fifteen minutes.
It was well into the night and the waiting room was dark, one of the fluorescent lights in the corner of the ceiling burnt out and the windows all black.  It had just been Sam and Dean there for the last two hours, save for the occasional nurse that would shuffle by.
The bear reared out of the brush on its hind legs and roared loud and angry like they'd personally offended it.  If it had been next to them, it would have towered even over Sam.
"They should have let the city burn," the third soldier, who had thus far remained silent, suddenly snarked.
Dean took a few moments to arrange the blankets on the bench, thinking that it was far from his memory foam, but roughing it was part of camping, right?  Plus, he was tired enough from the hunt that once his belly was full, he'd have been able to sleep out on the sand.
"Sure is."  Dean clapped him on the shoulder, realizing only too late that Cas wasn't wearing a shirt and
wrong with you.  You are perfect just the way you are.” He took Cas’ hands in his and kissed them, “You are strong and kind and amazing and brilliant and I don’t want you to doubt that
Cas and Hannah were close enough now that he could just distinguish their wings, rising and falling in slow but powerful beats that he knew were propelling them even faster than the impala could drive on an open highway.
Dean glared fiercely when he caught sight of another patron giving Cas a dirty look, cocking a brow in challenge until the man looked away and then turning to glare over his shoulder at the rest of the room for good measure, wondering what everyone’s goddamn problem was.
The room was dark and choked with tension, a current of energy vibrating between the three occupants.
When he hauled the heavy door open, he was distantly surprised to note that the sky was getting dark behind the old man standing before him.
She looked up with a little smile, going right back to her paper work.  “It means I have a terrible sense of humor and an inflated ego.”
It was less than an hour later when the three of them crested a shallow incline and abruptly found themselves in front of the city of Helgen.
Dean shook his head, “And to think, Sam, we always thought he was so stoic and soldiery...if only we could have seen his wings!  Could have read him like a book!”
He imagined forgetting that was harder now that his wings were visible and his grace was so damaged and angry that it hissed and bucked beneath his skin, trying to free itself from the binding.  He knew they could see it drifting outside the confines of his vessel sometimes.
He felt like he was coming back to life, like power being restored to a city; whole chunks of him flickering back online one block at a time.
Hot on the heals of no sleep, constant pain and a setback in his fear of touch-equals-pain from the whole Metatron thing, Castiel looked legitimately scared at the threat of being taken somewhere against his will and Dean’s feet were moving before his brain could remind him it was a terrible idea.
“So how come you know all about the Imperials and Stormcloaks but aren't familiar with the town names and stuff?”
to let their ‘inner critics’ – seriously where had Sam come up with these terms anyway – have too much control.
Being in front, Dean was the first to spot Cas and nearly tripped over his own feet, which, given the ten-foot drop-off immediately to his left, would have ended badly for him.
Cas merely answered with a slow blink and then tucked his head further under the blanket, his shoulders rolling like he was trying to wrap his wings tighter around himself.
At the end of it, he was exhausted, but he refused to close his eyes, trying to piece together his memories from the past couple days and make some kind of sense of them.
He slipped the shirt of Cas’ shoulders and sucked a breath past his teeth.  It looked worse now.  It definitely looked worse.  The skin from the top of Cas’ shoulder to halfway down the right side of his back was mottled purple and blue and he was holding himself stiffly, as if even tiny movements were causing him pain.
“Cas,” Dean said cautiously, gesturing for Sam to back up a few steps while he did the same. “Cas, you're fine, whatever you're seeing right now is in the past.”
Holgier punched his shoulder with a shit-eating grin, "You're just sore you couldn't even keep up with a bunch of overgrown kittens."
When Dean sat up, Cas was just sitting down between him and Sam, wet pants still dripping, and the stupid adorable tree rat was still sitting calmly on his shoulder like it had no intention of moving unless made to do so.  It had finished the coconut – as had Cas, Dean observed with a twinge of satisfaction – and was now inching along Cas’ shoulder, its little nose twitching over his sleek feathers.
He peeled his eyes open again.  He wanted to get a look at his captors so he could see if they had souls he could smite as soon as he got the chance, but his vision was still a nauseating slurry of shades of red that told him nothing.  Luckily, the flash of an angel blade was something he would always be able to distinguish through the blur of battle.
Tentatively, he raised his arm and Castiel only realized what he was doing when Dean's large hand settled over his wrist.
Castiel tried to hide his sudden grimace behind his wing but Sam caught it.  The younger brother cleared his throat and exchanged a glance with Dean.  “Right.  Bird in a shoebox.”
A withering look from Sam confirmed he was thinking along the same vein.  “We have to talk to Cas.  We can’t make this decision without him.”
- and maybe make some burgers for his brother and his angel and finally catch up on the last three seasons of Game of Thrones.  For a moment he’d felt free.  Free of the Mark, free of Rowena’s hold on Cas…free to be
wings shredded, bleeding and broken that had ruined him.  His wings had helped him slay enemies and win battles and had carried him and those he loved away to safety more times than he could count.  To not only have lost them, but to have them ruined, to have to carry them like they were now...it was unberable.
had even come up with such a crude spell before he realized it didn’t matter.  Whoever had made it had obviously been going for efficiency over quality.
As the sun – thankfully there was only one – climbed higher and the clouds slowly drifted away, Dean felt his gaze being pulled from the surrounding landscape to the angel in front of him.  Cas was leading their little caravan and Sam was bringing up the rear, so Dean was free to stare all he wanted without feeling like
The floor was pressing into his back again and the glass in his skin shifted, burning.  He clenched his teeth and screwed his eyes shut, overwhelmed, able to see nothing but shades of red whenever he opened his eyes.  He spread his wings along the floor, tried to feel who or what was around him.  There was glass between his feathers too.
The angel's eyes fluttered open and for a moment he looked confused, trapped in that place between unconsciousness and waking where you tried to remember where you were and why you were there. His blue eyes snapped to the fire and one of his wings twitched at his back.  After that the memories must have caught up with him, for his ever-present frown smoothed by a fraction and he tilted his head back to stare up at Dean.
He wasn’t sure how long he lay, instinctively frozen, as if the Serpent had snatched him out of the sky and was only waiting for him to start struggling before he pierced the angel with his fangs.
them – but that was it. There was nothing else there save for the vague shape of something he'd only just forgotten. He tried to dig it out, but it was buried too deep.
“The monks that live up on the mountain.”  Wilhelm took another swig of his ale.  “Not from around here, are you?  Everyone's heard of the Greybeards in Skyrim.  Rumor has it they're the only ones who can use the voice besides the Dragonborn.”
“You’re ok, Cas,” Dean assured him.  He spoke so softly.  So un-Dean like.  “We’re home, we just…here, let me help you.”
“We don’t have time for…I don’t need…”  Cas started and stopped, his thoughts obviously jumbled, and Dean reached out instinctively, wrapped his fingers around Cas’ arm to stop him fidgeting.
The angels shared a look, seemingly having an entire conversation without talking in the span of a millisecond, before they both looked back with identical looks of appeasement, their mouths opening at the same time.
“And about the whole Cas/Hannah thing...Dean you didn't ruin anything.  You need to – and I really can't stress this enough – you
He stopped just where he was close enough to see them clearly through the fog, taking in the still surreal sight of two angels just...being angels, in such a normal setting.
Dean walked back out of the little hut and looked around for the two angels, finding them both hovering shoulder to shoulder in the doorway of the next hut over, taking turns peeking curiously inside and murmuring in low tones.
He wondered if maybe Naomi hadn’t been on to something after all.  A lobotomy might not be such a bad idea if it meant he could forget the last few years of his life.
.  But nothing seems to be working."  He paused, sniffing and then gruffly clearly his throat, green eyes sweeping this way and that over Castiel's face.  "We, uh, we dosed you with some heavy-duty pain killers.  Did they help?  At all?”
Dean  paused outside the shop to readjust the steel brestplates strapped to his chest.  He filled his lungs up and loosened the straps around his waist a bit, releived when he could breathe properly again.  That would do for now, but he was going to need to spend some time firguring out how to make it all fit comfortably.  Or maybe he just needed to get used to it.  He hoped that was the case, because the thought of having to fight something in this getup seemed impossible.  He felt like he could hardly move.
But, miraculously, Castiel seemed to be getting his breathing under control and his eyes lifted enough to meet Sam's and held his gaze, even if it wasn't entirely focused. Sam offered the angel a small, reassuring smile and kept talking smoothly, low and soft enough that Dean only caught half of what he was saying. Nonsense, he realized, the only purpose of the words so that Cas could hear his voice.
?” he gasped through ruined vocal cords, in Enochian because it was the only language he could remember, “
Cas was suddenly standing right in front of him and Dean had to smother the urge to jump; though the shock was quick to fade when he caught sight of the smirk tugging at the angel's lips.
Both the angels startled all the same, their heads snapping up and hands slapping palms down onto the sand so that their wings could raise and arc out in case of the need to take immediate flight.
“What you probably never would have,” volleyed Dean, keeping his expression as open and neutral as he could in the face of Castiel's suddenly frigid, angelic attitude.
here.  But he couldn’t give them his real name.  Dean Winchester had died years ago…according to the FBI.
“You doing ok, Cas?”  he asked after a while.  He still didn't feel a hundred percent himself but he hadn't been the one doing any of the work to get here.
"Well, they're based in Riften and from what I hear they're struggling but trying to get back on their feet.  There was some kind of disturbance there a few months ago and people passing through the inn have said that their presence in the city is getting stronger.  There is a woman, Maven Black-Briar, who is a powerful ally of theirs and works as a liaison between the guild and the guards there.  She's somewhat of a middle man, keeping the guards from looking too deep and bribing them to turn the other way when a guild member gets caught breaking the law.  In exchange, they help
Until there was suddenly hands everywhere, grabbing at him, trying to pull his body down and put his limbs straight. He realized then that he was laying on something, could feel it's solid presence under his back and legs and, with a gut wrenching ferocity, memories of a table – a
“Yeah, here you go, knock yourself out.”  He handed the flowers off to Sam, who took them like they were made of glass and disappeared down the hall leading to the kitchen.
“Cas!”  he gasped when the burn in his lungs became unbearable.  He stumbled to a halt, using the sturdiness of a nearby tree to keep himself from falling over while his legs shook, seeing Sam in a similar state, a poor sapling bowing under his brother's weight.
Something fierce and angry thrummed in Dean’s chest like a lion’s roar.  It was a feeling that reared its head more and more frequently around Cas; a feeling Dean was too scared to look closely at.
Dean had forbidden him from praying any more, the binding around his grace was sharp and tight, and the black maw of despair in his chest was growing bigger and bigger.
There was the troll, just like Cas had said, standing eight or nine feet tall with long, harry knuckle-draggers for arms and a face crammed full of too many eyes and sharp teeth.  It was grunting and growling as it lumbered around in the mouth of its little cave, only just able to be heard over the rushing water beside them.
“Sorry, I didn't catch your name,” Sam said as Dean shoveled a spoonful of warm beef stew into his mouth.
He bowed his head and ran a hand through his hair, scrubbing it down his face.  “But they won’t let me see him.  Won’t even tell me where he is.  Just that he’s being held for evaluation and that I need paperwork to even talk to him.”
He sighed, realigning his view of the situation.  “Right.  Ok, you go call the nurse, I’ll make sure Cas hasn’t managed to choke on his pizza.”
"Alright fine," he grudgingly conceded and Cas looked immediately relieved. "But when we get back to the bunker we need to have a serious talk about your eating habits - and if you put up any more of a stink about it I'm going to sick Sam and his salads on you, got it?"
Dean smiled, feeling giddy and warm. The worry that Cas might not have his wings anymore had been weighing on both him and Sam for weeks. After all, Cas hadn't let the weighted blanket out of his sight since waking and spent almost every moment of every day wrapped up in it. The book had briefly touched on angel's using their wings like a comforting cocoon and Dean had seen the validity of the books observations with his own eyes. Cas was noticeably calmer and less prone to flashbacks or bouts of blank stares when he was wrapped up in the blanket. His own wings could only help.
“Look, I know that my little mud-monkey brain probably can’t even begin to understand what you’re going through…or how it feels to get your wings back, or what it even means or how – how an angel responds to trauma – ”
It was a welcome distraction, but they barely made it through the first twenty minutes of Star Trek Into Darkness before the sound of Cas moving under the weight of his blanket drew their attention.
It didn’t help that the polished concrete under his feet was like stepping on ice, but he grit his teeth and stumbled in the dark for the door, because he was nothing if not a soldier.  He needed to take a piss and no god damn
“Shit...” he took a step back, dragging a hand over his tingling lips.  “Fuck, Cas, I'm sorry.”  He thought of Hannah, back at the cabins with Sam, helping him get their dinner ready, and felt his stomach sink further.  “
“Let's get him back on the bed,” was all Sam said. He stood and set the empty syringe of etorphine on the night stand and Dean's red-rimmed eyes lingered on it, hating that they'd had to use it at all. Jody had gotten it for them, in the off chance they ended up needing it. She'd told them it was a sedative zoo caretakers frequently used to knock out the elephants, so it should be enough to put an angel under.
Or, more accurately, he was struck by how unreal his life was sometimes.  His best friend was an angel who liked to sleep in the woods and meditate by waterfalls and scolded Dean for stepping on baby plants.  His best friend had wings and grace and wasn’t human and had the power to level entire cities, but instead chose to spend his time hanging out with little woodland creatures and plants.  Cas was a hurricane in a glass bottle and Dean wanted to wrap him in a blanket and protect him; wanted to shelter
He followed the feeling of his own skin down over his back, tried shifting the muscles there. He might have felt something pull, somewhere far, far away that he could not reach – but he might have felt nothing at all. He couldn't be sure. Maybe, if he could
, the potion was doing its job.  The throb in his bones had vanished and his feet felt like he'd been off them all day.  He flipped Cas the bird and swallowed another two mouthfuls, tossing the bottle to his brother to finish and then retching into the bushes.
The weapons room was large, almost big enough to be called a gymnasium.  Through the double doors and to the right, most of the wall was covered with an array of melee weapons – all of which Castiel was much more comfortable wielding than the guns the brothers preferred.  The rest of the walls were pretty much bare, save for a few family crests that held no meaning to him and some ornate flags up higher near the ceiling.
Cas had picked up the stone and placed it gently over the low burning coals.  It was long and flat and thin, probably shale by the look of it; perfect for setting the pots on to boil.  His finger tips lingered on it and then the stone glowed red hot.
They scoured the place quickly and efficiently, finding some food – a half eaten loaf of bread and some more cheese, which they ate on the go with the rest of the cheese they had gotten from Wilhelm.  Two small red bottles that Cas grabbed and shoved into his bag and an ornate chest shoved into the corner of a storage room full of barrels and burlap sacks.
“That’s what happened when he froze up earlier,” Dean said woodenly.  “The spell was forcing him to do what we said.”
When Cas finally held a tiny glass bottle filled with blue liquid out to Sam, Sam took it reluctantly, with fingers that were nearly white and refusing to cooperate.
It didn’t matter what that meant, because right now he existed in this moment as a soldier who had orders to survive, and that was it.  He felt nothing, not in his head, his heart, or his body.  Objectively, he knew he should feel surprised.  Or perhaps impressed with himself.  To say he was out of practice would be generous, yet he’d still managed it.
He wanted to snap at Sam for getting blood on his face, because his heart was still pounding and his hands were shaking with adrenaline and because getting blood splatter on your face is always a little unpleasant.
look while Cas was talking about Hannah with such warmth in his voice – but he could hear the angel’s smile.  “Our garrison leaders thought the same thing.
After a few moments, when he had composed himself enough to not cause Cas further distress, Dean gently pulled back enough to cup Castiel’s face in his hands, waiting until Cas’ dazed, red rimmed eyes focused on his face as much as they could.
to see that crazy look gone from his eyes.  But even under the soft light of old bulbs, Cas was too pale, like there wasn’t a drop of blood left in him.  His eyes were clear, but he stared straight ahead, exhaustion evident in every line of his body; blinks were slow and far between and it took Dean calling his name three times before Cas raised his eyes from the floor, his gaze flicking sluggishly around the room before it landed on Dean.
When they got to Kynesgrove the sun was glowing behind the clouds near the tops of the trees around them and both Dean and Sam were
They were both in the library, sitting across from each other with layers of open books before them and steaming mugs of – he sniffed – peppermint and lavender tea.  It smelled…nice.
It felt strangely intimate to deliberately touch Cas’ wing.  When the angel had passed out in the field after landing, they’d had to use some rope to tie his wings up so they could safely carry him across the terrain.  So, of course, they had touched him, but it had been out of necessity, it had been unavoidable, and it hadn’t felt any different than any of the many, many times they had lifted him into the Impala when he was hurt or heaved him onto a bed when he was unconscious.
He stood while he still had the power to do so and backed away while Cas blinked up at him with wide and confused eyes, swaying into the space Dean had vacated.
Castiel's lips twitched like he was trying hard not to smile and Dean felt something light and warm swell in his chest.  He'd made it his life's mission, since Cas had moved in to the bunker a few months ago, to make the angel laugh out loud.  So far, he hadn't been able to pinpoint Cas' type of humour, but he was getting closer.  He'd come to learn that half of what came out of Cas' mouth was sarcasm - had been even when he was an angel - but the delivery was always so deadpan and underhanded that a lot of the time it flew over peoples' heads.  Dean was starting to think that dry humour would probably make Cas laugh.  Maybe some older British comedies like Black Adder or Fawlty Towers.  He vowed to stop at a Wal-Mart on the way home to try and find them.
"Oh my god," Sam huffed a groggy laugh, abandoning his futile attempt to fix his hair.  "Dean, look."
No, he pushed everything far, far away – he’d gotten quite good at that – and vowed to deal with it in a few hours when it all inevitably came crashing back down on him.  Because it always did.
He took a moment to relish the feeling of taking his weight off his feet, then began the struggle of trying to maneuver his sword so that he could sit fully in the chair.  Eventually, he just unstrapped it from his hip and leaned it up against the side of his chair, out of the way.
“Everyone 'n their cat's herd 'bout that damn dragon!”  the man bellowed, scaring a stray chicken out of the bushes at the bottom of the stairs.  They dog’s ears perked forward but he didn’t lift his head.
His grace clawed at the inside of his skin and needled down into his muscles, making him twitch with the urge to fight.  But he held fast, clutched at the arm rests until they splintered.
With a look that could have withered the plants around them, Cas brushed past Sam and led the way over the bridge.  “I have watched the evolution of life on Earth from the first fish hauling itself onto the beach to now and remember every second of it in exquisite detail, Sam, do you think I may have mistaken dinosaurs for dragons?”
Adrianne and her husband shared a look and then the two of them were rushing out from behind the counter, nearly tripping over themselves in their haste to present their merchandise.
Dean smiled, fondness overtaking him and, for a moment, he let it.  But while he watched Cas scoot another inch closer to the fire, curiosity made him break their comfortable silence.
When Dean barely brushed his fingers over the ridge of Castiel's shoulder blade, he cried out sharply and jerked out of Dean's hold.
“So God...your...your Father...has a name?  Just like Kali and all the others?”  Saying the words felt strange for some reason.  Talking about God like he was Cas' dad, like he'd spent Cas' childhood sitting in some leather lazy-boy with a beer in his hand felt…wrong.  He didn’t know why.
Darkness stared back and he slammed them closed again, curling into a tighter ball under the warmth and weight still around him.
It stood to reason that maybe he should say these things out loud.  The brothers had been insisting that they all say things that were personal and oftentimes deeply uncomfortable to hear.  They were trying to communicate on a deeper level, they told him, and were trying to fix a lifetime of
The inn keeper, Iddra, was standing by the huge fire pit in the centre of the room, her back to Dean.  In front of her was a man about the same age with his blond beard tied into a knot under his chin.
Swallowing thickly, Sam nodded.  “Ok…ok.  I’m gonna make a call, I know someone who’s a nurse, and we’ll figure out the best way to help Cas.”
“Uhh might be some drift wood lying around but it'd be soaked,”  Sam said, glancing out over the smooth expanse of sand.
But that was a problem to be dealt with later.  Priority right now went to the fact that he needed to get rid of his blade before the walls gave way and emotion changed his mind about ending everything once and for all.  So, he left his room to find either Sam or Dean, whichever he came upon first.  His blade was held loosely in his right hand, feeling, for the first time, almost too heavy to carry.
Dean was trying to help, he really was, but his brain – which still felt like it was hurtling through space – was in no shape to process all the strange things his eyeballs were asking it to make sense of.
Castiel's left wing gave a twitch but he didn't step away from Sam, though he did give a shaky nod and glance over at Dean.
Sam was closest to him, so Castiel twirled his sword in his hand and delicately grabbed the blade, holding it out hilt-first to the younger brother.
Cas held up his hand again in an obvious gesture for them to stay put and then took a few steps forward into the courtyard, turning so that he was facing the brothers and drawing another arrow, slowly this time and aiming up over the alcove, his wings spread a little behind him.
Castiel nodded, pulling a hunting knife from under his seat; the blade was a foot and a half long and the end of it was serrated.
Sam visibly took a moment to carefully word his next question.  “You believe the Dragonborn is really back?”
Cas might have kept going, if Dean hadn’t started to frantically shake his head and crowd closer, reaching up to cup Cas’ face in his hands.
She shrugged, folding her hands in her lap. "It seems to make people feel better.  In light of the evidence of the dragons returning and the Dragonborn...gone missing, people like to be reminded of the prophecy's promise – if you believe in that sort of thing.  It gives them hope."
She laughed and then nodded again, her eyes crinkling at the corners.  “Alright then.  What else can I get for you?”
Several days later, Dean was still smiling, thinking of all the little stolen kisses he and Cas had shared since then, thinking of how just that morning, he'd finally dared to press close to Cas, had closed the distance between them until they were touching from chest to hip, and let his arm curl around the angel's waist to rest his hand at the dip in his spine.
Surprisingly, Sam – who was normally the voice of reason in these kinds of situations – was carefully picking up and putting down weapons himself.  He ended up with one of the hand guns tucked neatly in the pocket of his suit jacket while Dean opted for the sawed off shotgun because he wasn’t fucking around here and wanted everyone to know it.
…well, it was the Winchesters that he wanted to make sure felt more comfortable.  He did not want them to start looking at him like he was something to be feared; something to be
The realization would have put him on his knees if he hadn’t already been crouching against the wall like a frightened, savage beast.  Even after realizing the danger he was putting them in, Castiel was finding it alarmingly difficult to stop.
for a change.  He supposed they should have seen it coming.  God was light and Amara was darkness, it wasn’t as if those two things hadn’t been canceling each other out since the beginning of time – Dean had just expected it to be harder.  It was always harder.
want to.  But it was hard to remember to ask nicely when he was being distracted by Cas' muscular torso.
.  The way his wings were shaking a little, the way his dark blue eyes kept lifting like they wanted to meet Dean's but couldn't quite manage it.
“I see.” Liam’s voice was solemn with understanding, and Dean felt like a kid that had just disappointed his wise old grandfather.  “Your mother shares the unfortunate viewpoint of most hunters; that anything that isn’t human isn’t
“Yeah, ok.  We can just…you can sleep, ok?”  Dean told the angel quietly, approaching him from the side, slowly enough for Cas to realize he was there.  He let his hand rest heavily on Cas’ shoulder, squeezing a little, trying to get him to look up from the floor.
"Only in some ways." Dean said. He let his hand brush down the back of Castiel's neck and between his shoulder blades, spreading his fingers against soft skin. "Come on, angel, I'll teach you how to make decent coffee."
He hated it.  He hated himself.  He hated that their lives just couldn’t be simple and easy for once.
She sent them away with a loaf of bread and some cheese wrapped in cloth for when they headed out and the brothers went back to the table where Cas was still staring down at the map.
“Shit, Sam, stop, stop, stop, put him down,” he rasped, breathing hard.  He hoped the spots of light dancing at the corner of his eyes were some kind of alien fireflies.
Echoes of power sparked under his fingertips as he dragged them over the angel’s soft, golden skin.  In the wake of his touch, Castiel trembled.
Sam, who had probably realised the same thing ages ago, seemed to already have the information on how to get started ready to go on his laptop.  He inundated Dean’s inbox with article after article on trauma, PTSD, self-care, journaling, mental health awareness, and a load of other crap that Dean hadn’t even known was something people talked about, much less studied.
Until he caught sight of Jessy, Cesar and Sam coming down the path and his blue eyes widened and his wings flared wide again – alarmed by the sight of the two strangers coming towards him.  Grace lit up his eyes, light replacing the deep blue in his irises – an instinctual reaction Dean knew he had no control over.  Just like a shot of adrenalin or a scream, his grace was reacting, warning him, getting Cas ready to fight or run.
Over the last few days there had been some serious self reflection going on inside the bunker.  It had taken his best friend throwing himself to the ground and praying to a god that was no longer listening until he passed out from exhaustion, but finally Dean had realised that something about their lives and how they moved through it needed to change.
!  Oh, those Windhelm folk don't have an ounce of trusting blood in them!  You know they found a Dark Elf dead in her room at the inn there not too long ago?  She was butchered, no two ways about it!  Not a thing was done, they just dumped her body in the river and kept on.  Dreadful business.” He shook his head, stringy grey hair skittering around his face.  “The only reason the jarl can even keep that city running is because flocks of young students have to pass through it to get to the mage college in Winterhold.”
Dean could hardly hear anything inside the police cruiser but his brain helpfully supplied the little whimpers and gasps likely spilling from Castiel’s lips in that moment…because he’d heard them before, back when Castiel would have waking nightmares about this
“We didn’t really have that kind of relationship back then,” Sam huffed a disquieted laugh, glancing over his shoulder at Cas’ unmoving form.
Dean let the rest of his tension go in a big exhale, giving Cas some space and going to pick up his sword, eyeing the body of the man he'd nearly split down the middle in his rage.
The brothers took a seat on a stool to either side of him, taking one last look around the room and the patrons within it, before turning to the woman behind the bar.  She was thin, with olive tone skin, dark, warm eyes and dark red hair pulled back in a pony tail.  She looked tired, but her smile was sincere.
Cas had told him he wouldn't be able to, but just as he'd suspected, that did nothing to calm his instincts.  His brain was telling his body that he was suffocating, even though he knew he wasn't, and his body was responding to it.  His muscles were cramping, trying to draw him into a fetal position and his lungs were still stubbornly twitching in his chest and it was all so fucking uncomfortable and he was
After a while, it had become second nature, keeping Cas at what he'd decided was a safe distance. But even then, he'd used any viable excuse to call him down. Of course, the only viable excuse in Dean's mind was when they needed help with something they might not be able to handle on their own. He'd shamelessly soaked up Castiel's presence and attention from afar, giving nothing back in return and not bothering to stop and think if his selfish actions had any affect on the angel.
Owen blinked at them, looking like she’d been slapped.  Or like she suddenly realized two psychotic men had broken in to her ward to steal back their equally psychotic friend.
They hadn't gotten far with the angel and as soon as Dean went through the little side door he was following bodies instead of dirt tracks.  Two headless corpses lay in the hallway and further up he could see just the feet of another body jutting out from an open doorway.  An empty syringe halfway down the hall and Dean started running, skidding around the corner and through another door just in time to see Cas get shoved to the floor, his back hitting the concrete with a dull thud and a sharp gasp.  His bloody hunting knife was three feet away, out of his reach and four vamps held each of his limbs, pinning him to the floor like a butterfly to a show board.
The hunter held his hands up as a sign of peace and took several steps back.  “Sorry, man, I didn’t mean to…to grab for it, I just,” he cleared his throat, the sound jagged, while he ran a hand down his face, “I just wanna help.  I can see your hands shaking and I know the lines gotta be clean.”  Another swipe, at his eyes this time, followed by a hollow, broken laugh.  “But hey, I get it.  You don’t want a hunter carving stuff into your chest with one of the few things that can kill you.  ‘Specially since it’s my fault you even have to –“
He shook Sam off, something cold and dark and terrifying clawing it's way up his throat with every second that passed. Cas didn't move. He wasn't
Cas' wingbeats remained wide and slow, unlike Hannah's quick controlled ones, and he kicked up the sand like a helicopter would.  Still, despite the mess, his landing was much more delicate and controlled than Hannah's was, in the sense that he let one foot ease onto the ground and then the other, rolling on the balls of his feet and letting his body weight sink rather than drop.  His wings stayed open too after he'd stepped onto the sand, stretching with a groan just like Hannah had.
He stopped walking immediately and somehow that made his feet and legs ache more.  Up ahead, the damn angel just kept on walking, like he could go on doing so for years, and Dean felt irrationally annoyed by it.
“Jesus, don’t you ever sleep?!”  Dean hissed, taking all of Cas’ weight when Sam carefully stepped away.
He had to resist the urge to reach out; everything they'd read on the internet about trauma victims had been clear about not touching without permission. Ever. A difficult thing to remember when every fibre of his being was telling him to wrap Cas in his arms again. But, they'd seen first hand what happened when they did so, this time, Dean clenched the arm rests of his chair till his knuckles were white and kept his body still and his voice soft.
The ‘nest’ had been his idea.  After watching Cas try to curl up on that standard twin mattress with his wings as big as they were…well.  It couldn’t have been comfortable and he doubted angels were meant to take their rest in beds.  He wasn’t trying to think of angels as birds, since it obviously irked said angel, but there
One of Castiel’s wings came around him, damp feathers feeling like a silk sheet against his back, and the angel shifted ever so slightly.
But that was too broad a question and there were just too many painful answers.  He didn’t know where to start and when he opened his mouth nothing came out.
“That's ok, that's totally normal.” Dean rolled his bottom lip between his teeth, hesitated. “Is it alright if I come closer?”
Fall was coming, Dean remarked absently, kicking a few dead leaves under his feet.  Above his head, here and there, leaves were starting to let go, fluttering to the ground and creating a patchwork of yellow and orange spots, looking like a moth-eaten blanket covering the dirt road that lead to the bunker.
“Yes.  Thank you.  I'm sorry, I...”  Cas cleared his throat and looked away, as if embarrassed.  “I pushed myself too hard trying to get here as fast as possible and lessen the length of your and Sam's discomfort.” He shifted his shoulders as if to dispel a kink in the muscle and the wings shifted with him.  But then his expression cleared and he actually looked a bit smug.  “But I got us here in seven minutes.”
Dean blinked, clearing his throat awkwardly when he realized what the fuck he was actually thinking about.  It was one thing to admit that Castiel had nice eyes, it was another problem all together to start waxing poetic about them.
Until he saw Cas behind him, still pressed close to the wall, and did a double take, skidding to a stop with wide eyes and a gaping mouth. His gaze flicked between his brother and Cas and he repeated, with a little more focus and a lot more confusion.
That too, had everything to do with emotion.  His blade was not really heavier, it only felt that way; his subconscious playing tricks on him because every other part of him wanted to keep that blade with him where it
Wilhelm nodded, his expression grave.  “That’s what we've been hearing too.  My guess is the poor lass panicked, couldn't handle the responsibility and ran.  Who can blame her?”
Castiel felt tired – exhausted even – and his eyes closed all on their own despite him trying to keep them open until Dean was out of the room.  It was an accomplished tired, though.  He felt as if he might have worked himself through something and come out the other side.  He felt rejuvenated in a way that wasn’t at all physical and he thought about the way Dean had been looking at him – not the way he usually did, like he was worried or scared or both – but like he had hope that they might pull through this together, now that they were actually
For a second after Dean reached him, the two of them just stared at one another until Cas looked away, out over the open water.  Dean wondered again if he could see through the fog.
The access road to the bunker was long, dark, and littered with potholes and Dean eased the Impala down it at a crawl, vowing – as he always did – to get some gravel and fill them in sometime soon.
He gave Castiel an unsteady smile and said, “You mind watching the sauce for me so it doesn't burn?  I'm gonna go tell Sam that supper is ready.”
It had been a long time since he’d had a panic attack of this magnitude and it was hard to fight his way past the gut-wrenching images of what Cas had almost done to focus on the breathing exercises he’d been practicing.
Dean slowly made his way around the front of the car and came to stand beside Cas, glad to see he at least seemed more calm after a few breaths of fresh air.
Dean shook himself out of the memory, “Yeah, I’ll warn them when they get here.  Sometime after supper, they said.  Apparently they thought they could make it all the way to Alaska in one go but,” Dean grinned, remembering the way Cesar had mumbled into the phone, obviously trying to keep Jessy from hearing, “I guess things were getting a little tense.”
They managed to get the weakened angel to the car and then Cas all but collapsed across the back seat and the brothers climbed into the front. The entire ride back to the bunker - all eight hours of it - was silent. Cas never stirred once and the brothers both stared straight out the windshield, lost in their own deafening thoughts. The road kept disappearing under the tires but Dean felt like it was infinite, like he was driving on a treadmill, and for the eternity it took to get them all back home, Dean couldn't stop replaying what Cas had asked him to do. Over and over.
“You three look like you could use a cup of mead and a warm bed,” the guard to the right of the door suddenly said, sounding sincere.  “You folks ever been to Whiterun before?”
Sam sighed, setting the tray of gross looking sandwhiches down on the table.  “Well, that’s probably for the best.  You need to eat something and we should probably head to the psych ward waiting room, then you can catch some sleep too.  Even if it’s just a few minutes.”
He shared an uncertain glance with Sam, because that didn’t make sense.  Castiel was graceless.  He wasn’t fully human but he certainly wasn’t fully angel either and Castiel had vocally lamented not only the loss of his siblings’ voices in his head, but the ability to hear Sam and Dean’s prayers and feel their presence.
There was a tense few moments where no one moved.  Cas looked mildly relived at the prospect of not having to explain what Metatron had done out loud – which he had not yet been able to do successfully – and wary of having to get close enough to Liam to touch him.
Sam shrugged, looking lost and frustrated, but casting around for ideas anyway.  “To…to study them?  To get information?  Maybe the Norse people worshipped them or thought they were gods?” He frowned, “No, that doesn’t make sense, they wouldn’t forcibly abduct and enslave their gods.  Maybe as a sacrifice
to push out everything he was feeling and not have to deal with it.  But Liam had asked him not to do that anymore and, because Liam was clever, he’d framed the hold Castiel’s emotions had on him as the enemy.
“Sam!”  Dean barked at his brother when he just kept staring.  “Back off, man, you're freaking him out.”  He didn't bother mentioning to the angel that
Panic inched its way back into his awareness, his body curling into the fetal position as the pain of his bonds burned through the medication numbing his nerves.
For the first time in a very long time, Castiel felt himself unable to speak.  Memories of Metatron restraining him with gleaming metal cuffs invaded his memory.  His breath had smelled awful.  His giggles had been even worse.  He’d never felt more helpless in his entire existence as he had when the scribe had leaned over him with such glee and cut him open.  He’d been nothing to Metatron.  Just a useless animal that he’d needed a piece of for his recipe.  And he’d tied Castiel down and taken it so easily.
“Your boyfriend was either intoxicated or suffers from a mental illness, I was simply trying to narrow down the possibility of either.”
.” Dean pressed his forehead to the tangle of their hands and his fingers trembled as they squeezed around the angel’s so hard that his knuckles were white.  “We don’t know
Sam covered a laugh beside him by abruptly turning it into a cough and Dean rolled his shoulders, the weight of the angels' silence and attention making him want to move.
Cas stepped off the road and motioned for them to stick close and, together, the three of them disappeared into the surrounding shrubs and trees.  They were sparse and not much for cover but they were better than nothing if a bandit happened to look out one of those windows or peek over the crumbling wall.
Sam's voice had turned grave but he didn't let it shake; though from the corner of his eye, Dean saw him wipe a hand down his face before leaning forward to rest his elbows on his thighs.
He tried to take a few deep breaths and push the anger away, trying to see things from their point of view.
Sam barrelled down the stairs and towards him with such urgency that Castiel felt himself taking a step back, the tweezers still held delicately just under his skin.
Dean dumped his pile of coins right on the counter between them.  “We need everything.  Weapons and full sets of armor for both of us.”  He motioned for Sam to dump his coins too and he did so with a nervous twitch of his lips.
Settling down beside him but still a few feet away, Liam fixed him with a heavy stare.  “I’m sorry that we restrained you, Castiel.  I know you’ve experienced trauma related to being restrained in the past and I truly felt dreadful having to do it but I didn’t want you to come to and find you had injured Sam or Dean.  We weren’t able to tell if you were aware of your surroundings and you were…very angry.  You gave us quite a fright.”
Normally, Dean would be the last one to roll himself out of bed at eight in the morning but, well, he hadn’t seen Cas in a day and a half and a small pile of flowers was no substitute for seeing the angel’s face, talking to him, just…being around him.  And besides that, Jessy and Cesar had said they needed a few days off from driving; what better way to take a break from sitting than to go for a little hike in the woods to introducing them to an angel for the first time?
Dean had spent the last five weeks lying awake at night wondering if Cas knew what it meant when his stomach growled at him.  Or if he knew how much water he should drink a day.  How long had it taken him to figure out that he had to sleep
He was angry.  Angry at Crowley for having this power over them.  Angry they needed Crowley in the first place.  Angry at
“Saadia even had time to bake some deserts today,” she went on, “If you're in the mood for something sweeter we have some boiled cream treats and fresh apple pie.”
Castiel offered him a small smile and a gentle squeeze of his shoulder.  "I will sleep later, Dean."
“I’m sorry,” Castiel said, out of habit.  He was always apologizing for scaring the brothers.  He wished he wasn’t so frightening.  “I wasn’t aware.  Of anything.  I wasn’t even sure where I was.  You did the right thing, I…” he looked down, fidgeting with his hands in his lap.  He let his wings slide down over his shoulders a bit as he leaned into the wall.  “I wanted to hurt you.  I didn’t know who any of you were,” he added, as if that made it any less horrifying that, had he managed to get free, he likely would have slaughtered them all.
“Ok,” he quietly agreed.  He could give Sam and Dean this time alone.  He would pretend to sleep and stay out of the way like they needed.  It was the least he could do after all the trouble he had caused.
Dean started to cut up some of the vegetables he’d found in the barrels and then sent Cas back out and down to the river with the cauldron to fill with water.  Despite the fact that, full of water, it might have weighed close to a hundred pounds, he carried it effortlessly hooked over his arm like a basket of flowers.
“I'll just go help Sam with breakfast, shall I?”  Hannah suggested, turning towards the cabins where the fire was still roaring high.
bear arms – with the claws still in them – around his neck like a scarf and fur armor that somehow managed to look even more intimidating than it did cozy.
They weren't able to get anything else out of him.  He broke down into hysterical sobs, skinny arms wrapped around his middle like he’d been kicked in the gut.  They checked the rest of the house but there was only one small room where Narfi had a moldy bedroll and a threadbare blanket laid out on the damp floorboards in front of the fireplace.
Cas stepped in front of them, spreading his wings halfway to block the wind while he dug through his satchel.  The wind whipped his hair wildly and the tips of his longest flight feathers were fluttering against the brothers’ legs.
Without being asked, the first time Dean had punched Cas in the face rose to the forefront of his memory.  It had been like punching a marble statue and he reminded himself that, while the body was human, the creature pulling the string inside was not.
All the breath left Dean's lungs in a woosh and he smiled through the tears blurring his vision because Cas' deep, dark, ocean water eyes were looking up at him, a little dazed but without that terrifying feral look that had been there last time. Dean felt like he might pass out.
It made him feel a little better, hearing them jingle with every step he took.  It made him feel like he was at least
fighting. But he'd been clawing his way through battle after battle for most of his life and this sitting
Dean shushed him, “It's alright, Cas, we can figure this out together. I'm here,” he breathed when Cas shyly lifted his gaze again, “I'm right here with you, angel, however you need me, and I ain't going anywhere.”
Castiel’s hand came up to rest against the side of his face and he nodded, already leaning up to kiss him again with a bit more certainty.
To be honest, he didn’t feel like cooking tonight.  He was tired, and with every day that passed, it was getting harder and harder not to jump in the Impala and go find Cas himself.  But he knew that Cas was aiming for the bunker.  If he drove off in a random direction, Dean knew he would likely only be putting more distance between himself and wherever Cas eventually
With his return to the conscious world, input assaulted him.  After so many hours of blocking everything out, sounds and smells brushed up against his awareness like the gritty drag of sandpaper on skin.
have been surprised, though.  Or impressed.  He was a soldier and soldiers were meant to do what needed to be done at any cost, without praise, no matter how rusty they were.
But it had been worth it, once it was on, because Cas had at least stopped shivering and the frightened sounds had stopped slipping from his lips.
“Fine,” Cas answered at once without looking away from the fire.  His wings shifted behind him, long flight feathers sliding along the floor boards.  “Just thinking about what our next course of action should be.  We still have very little to go on.  It is very frustrating.”
if he indulged in such comforts.  There was no one to see or judge him, former commander of heavenly armies, nearly catatonic while he behaved like a fledgling.
He tried to remind himself as often as possible now that Cas wasn’t just Cas.  He was Castiel, and he had
She hummed her assent, all her limbs pulling back, wings folded loose and happy, as she turned to watch Castiel finally head for the shore.
Gilfre hadn't been kidding when she said the house hadn't been used in a while and the trio had to step around bushes that were growing up between the wooden boards in the flat deck.  But the rain was falling even harder now and the misty gray canopy over their heads was enough to tell them that it would last for hours yet.  So, they made their way inside and, honestly, it wasn't too bad.
“On three,” Cas rumbled calmly.  The silver band around the angel's finger was hot against Dean's skin.
, I’m not fucking kidding.  You haven’t seen him yet; you don’t get it.  He’s exhausted and at the end of his rope.  He needs to
Cas glanced around, as if looking for the answers to their problems in the bushes on either side of the road, and then sighed.
The drive to the inner city was distractingly wonderful in contrast to the grim reason they were there to see it.  The sun was starting to set, casting sharp shadows and silhouetting the tall buildings with golden, pink sunlight.  They'd rolled the windows down to try and stir a breeze in the oppressive heat but even still Cas was sprawled on the passenger side again, one arm hanging out the window, his thighs spread with one knee resting against the door and his other arm stretched out across the back of the bench seat - Dean knew Cas' hand was sitting behind his right shoulder and its ghostly presence tickled over his nerve endings.
He supposed that explained the incident with the pizza.  He hadn’t felt hungry in days but the second he’d laid his eyes of the plate of food, he’d been consumed with the desire to devour every last crumb.  It had been a primal instinct flaring in the back of a brain that shouldn’t have even been connected to Castiel’s consciousness.  But he was stuck in this body now, and was a slave to it’s baser needs.
With a smirk, Liam said, “That is because Crowley does not know.  He knows I work with angels and have for a long time, but that is mostly it.  No, I was a psychologist for two lifetimes, always moving on before people could get suspicious of how I wasn’t growing older.  I loved it.  I was helping people, you know?  But then I met Adriel and everything changed.  They fell, literally and metaphorically, into the edge of the estate I was occupying at the time.  They were…severely injured.  I wasn’t sure what to do, or how to help.  By then I had
This was enough, he told what was left of himself. This echo of pain was so much better than what it
He froze with a piece of meat half way to his mouth and waited for Cas to reach back to the base of his wing again. This time he saw that the angel's fingers were shiny and wet with something and that he was using it to coat his feathers.
Cas had been still as a marble statue when he'd walked in and nothing had changed yet. He was so still Dean was sure he wasn't even breathing – he didn't sometimes, when he forgot to – and his arms were wrapped so tightly around his knees that his skin had gone white. His head was resting on his knees, face turned towards the wall, but Dean couldn't see well enough to tell if his eyes were closed or open and staring. He wasn't sure which was better anyway.
His stomach dropped.  In the chaos of the last twenty-four hours, he’d forgotten to try and modify a sweater for him.
to and he needed every bit of himself that was left to figure it out because this had never happened before and that had to mean something. It
He growled, letting his grace crackle out from under his boots and spider web across the floor, vaporizing the mats to dust instantly.
Dean couldn't stop the grin from spreading over his face even if he’d tried.  He felt the simultaneous urge to mercilessly tease the angel and to go stand protectively outside the tent to make sure no one disturbed his rest.
Ozone, he realized.  It smelled like ozone.  Like a thunderstorm had just passed in this room alone.  He wondered why he never noticed it before.
“So uh, tell me you have some kind of Les Stroud survival skills I don't know about and can get a fire going by rubbing some sticks together,” Dean joked once he’d planted himself on his ass next to their sad pile of kindling.
"It was a very long time ago."  Cas deftly dropped a deadthbell blossom into the pulverized nightshade and started crushing it up too.  In the distance, the owl hooted again.
” he breathed with all the conviction he could muster. The black thing in his chest kept shredding his insides and the hands holding him down didn't relent, so he submitted to them, went limp, and let his unseeing eyes stare blankly.
A waterfall cascaded down the sheer rock face to their left.  It was impossible to see where it started with the dense mist curling over their heads, and it dropped away below the bridge for hundreds of feet, disappearing into another cloud of billowing mist, leaving it’s base an unknown distance away.  The water rushing past the edge of the bridge was so close that the stones were soaked and lush, dark green moss had covered almost the entire half of it.
He pressed a kiss to the top of Cas’ head, just a gentle pressure to gauge his reaction.  Adorably, Castiel turned his face in to Dean’s chest and he could feel the angel smiling.
Gentle pressure moving from the top of his wing down, over and over.  So gentle and soft.  It was…nice.  Almost as nice as Dean’s voice as he sang – nearly whispered – somewhere behind Castiel’s head.
Liam had listened, silent and understanding even when Dean knew he wasn’t making any sense and prompting him when emotion clogged his throat.  And he’d had a
His mind conjured up an unhelpful image of blood spattering on the angel's lips, splashing up from within his ruined vocal chords, and Dean cursed, scraping together the dregs of his energy, pushing aside the ache in his muscles and launching himself at the filthy demon who'd been twisting those screws deeper into Castiel's brain.
gesture in Sam's general direction and kept an eye on Cas as the angel inched towards the open archway Sam had just come through. His steps were reluctant, like he was being pulled along by a rope but didn't really want to go.
He forced himself to keep his eyes open, watched how the blue glow was seeping out from under Castiel's closed eyes, and felt his orgasm getting ready to crash over him, thought of how Cas probably felt like he was standing on the edge of a cliff.
Now he’d gone and made it that much more obvious.  Up until now his wings had always been a source of pride for him.  They were sleek and powerful, meant for diving and weaving and cutting down his enemies.  He kept them impeccably groomed.  Not a feather out of place, as was expected for a Seraph of his ranking.
He wasn’t sure how he felt about the fact that they had figured out that it was comforting to him.  Angels weren’t supposed to need comfort, where they?  He didn’t care, he was too tired.  He looked at the empty space next to him and decided it was a good enough spot to have a nap but before he could fully pitch himself sideways, Sam’s hand left his wing and caught him under the arm, keeping him upright.
Cas had left immediately after dropping the mother of all hunting trips in their laps, supposedly to give them some time to think about it, but both brothers were already fully on board.  The problem was that it was hard to prepare for something this epic when you had no idea what you were going in to.
Less than an hour later, the brothers were walking across the parking lot to the old Dodge Charger Sam had taken from the bunker’s garage and ,once Sam was behind the wheel, Dean was in the passenger seat and the doors were closed, Dean finally released a shaky breath, adrenaline still pumping through him even though that had been the most efficient and controlled escape they had ever made from a situation.
inside these concrete walls.  The bunker had always felt cramped but now that his wings were free, it felt even smaller.  Angels didn’t belong in boxes and they certainly did not belong underground.
Behind the gesticulating preacher – who was dressed in heavy grey robes that dragged on the ground as he walked back and forth and yelled at passerbys – the building that they had seen trekking towards the city the day before loomed tall, strong and formidable.
Cas and Hannah were crouched on the ground, their wings down over their shoulders with the large joints resting on the wet sand, holding them up like an extra pair of hands.  Cas was elbow deep in the hole he had dug but was still scooping out sand and adding it to the pile next to him.  When he leaned down again, the joint of his wing pushed into the sand, sliding out an inch or two, digging into the dirt.
Dean cleared his throat again and, before the hunter could awkwardly pull his hand away, Castiel folded his wings in tight to his back and pushed himself to his knees, sitting on his heels.
Standing up and fanning his wings as best he could, Cas let the water cascaded off of them and, for a moment, the sound of it was loud enough to be a dull roar and the woman's giggles turned into a gasp of surprise.  Cas' wings beat slowly at the air, siphoning water off his feathers in a thousand directions like a sprinkler.  He had to brace himself, widening his stand when the power of his own muscles pulled at him and threatened to take him over backwards.
The trio looked and could see the faint outline of a very large hill in the distance, where, presumably the center of the blank space on the map was.
They were still doorless shacks on a rainy beach, but they were nice, Dean thought, for what they were trying to accomplish.
It had taken them all of twenty minutes to put together, and Cas had reacted like they had done something huge.  It was sobering, to realize just how low the bar had been set for them, and that such a simple gesture had shocked the angel so much.
“Your face is turning the same shade as your beard!”  Dean howled, grabbing Castiel's shoulder so he didn't trip over anything in the dark.
Dean found himself glancing over at his brother and their eyes met.  It was obvious they were thinking the same thing.  Tracking someone down wasn't exactly difficult, most of the time. They temselves had done it dozens of times before.  Why did Cas seem so reluctant to tell them about it?
“Oh, Jesus,” Dean breathed sadly, “Oh, Cas...”  Carefully, he sat down with his side pressed against Cas’, taking one of the angel’s hands and squeezing it tight.  “Fuck, Cas, I’m so sorry.”
of his sudden ability to do so. For so long those jagged pieces of himself had rattled and shook with endless pain, constantly trembling like pebbles in an earthquake; he couldn't have pulled himself together even if he'd wanted to.
It was well into the night and so dark it was hard for Sam and Dean to see more than a few yards in front of them, especially with the rain pelting them from above and the fog pushing in on all sides.  The clouds seemed close enough to reach out and touch, hanging swollen and heavy over their heads.  In just a few minutes, the rain had soaked through their armor and was pulling heat from their skin.
He could tell the moment the sigil was complete.  His grace stuttered like a flame in the wind and then faded; receding from the searing coils of the bonds like a kicked dog moving to the back of its cage.
“Angels can read souls and sense intention, and even some emotion, from them.  I was just letting Castiel see for themselves that I mean no harm to them or to either of you and that I genuinely do want to help.”  He gave them a shrewd look, “Forbidding an angel from reading souls would be like trying to decipher someone’s mood and intentions with a blindfold on.”
being dead.  He remembered feeling strange, disconnected, confused – no real ground gained there, he thought ruefully; he often felt that way.
He was out of the car before the engine even stopped running and made an effort to at least slow his charge forward into more of a march when he nearly bowled over two little old ladies coming out the door.
If he had, he could have avoided this entire uncomfortable encounter.  If he hadn’t been in the state he was, she never would have had time to even squeeze the trigger.
Dean sank in to a chair at the table, rubbing the bridge of his nose.  “Well, I don’t either, but…” he shrugged.  What else were they supposed to do?  “What if what Crowley said is true?  What if we’ll never be able to really get through to him?  What if that binding is slowly driving him crazy?  What then?  You saw what happened to him earlier!  He just froze up like a marble statue until I
they were.  Instead of communing with their brothers and sisters and learning what it meant to be part of the Host and part of a family, they were given a weapon, branded with battle sigils and sent to war.”
Eventually he became aware of pressure on his chest. Between the icy-hot shards of glass working themselves into his skin and the great serpent’s fangs inside his brain, it was easy enough to ignore.
They'd both watched the brothers first, watched how they opened the clams and removed them from the half shell before pinching the dark part at one end and shucking it off before putting the whole thing in their mouth.  Then they had mimicked them exactly and it was the most endearing thing about the two of them sometimes.
Dean's heart jumped into his throat when the stomping seemed to get closer.  It was chasing them!  He didn't even look over his shoulder to make sure, he just flat out sprinted right past Cas – seeing Sam blow past the angel on the other side - who called an inquiry after both of them, sounding calmly perplexed.
On a good day, when they were full of energy and could actually see, carrying an unconscious, six-foot-tall man over uneven terrain would have been difficult.
that there was something going right over his head; he thought he was doing something wrong by not being able to figure out how to answer the officer’s questions correctly and it broke Dean’s heart a little.
“What the fuck, are you fucking kidding me?!” Dean growled over his shoulder.  He couldn’t see where Castiel and Calwell were but he could hear Calwell trying to subdue the angel.  Every few seconds he heard Castiel gasp with pain and he felt rage bubbling inside him with nowhere to go.
Her brown eyes flicked over his shoulder to his wings before coming back to his face, her smile gentling.  “We've only got two beds right now.  But one of them is big enough to fit two people.”
he'd come to know him and it bothered him. He couldn't tell if this burn low in his gut was good or bad, if it was love or hatred or both, and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't find the memories that would answer that question. He thought he almost might be able to feel them, throbbing under all the mess, far, far out of his reach.
“Soon as word spread that the girl had helped kill a dragon terrorizing Whiterun, the Greybeards called, but so far as anyone knows, she never showed up.”  Wilhelm shrugged helplessly, draining the rest of his ale.  “We can only hope now that she finds the courage to fulfill her destiny...or, if the stories are to be believed, we're all doomed.”
The confession hung between them, delicate and breakable, but Dean suddenly felt like he could breathe again for the first time in years. His heart still hammered against his ribs and he still worried that he might have just ruined the best friendship he'd ever had but, he
He pulled the plug in the sink and wiped his hands on his jeans, fingers catching on the edge of the cell phone in his other pocket, and turned in time to see Sam come through the door.
Castiel's brow scrunched adorably and his mouth dropped around another gasp, his eyes half-closing with whatever sensation Dean's fingers were giving him.  The sight of it had heat pooling low in Dean's stomach and he wiggled his fingers a little, watching with rapt attention the way Castiel's face scrunched up again, how his long fingers clutched convulsively at Dean's jacket, how he arched his whole body towards Dean.
Liam’s frown softened, “Alright, well, that was a very unfair thing to ask of you and I am giving you my permission to look.  In fact, I am asking you to.”
The air rushed from Castiel’s lungs again and for a long moment, he didn’t bother refilling them.  All he could hear was the sound of pressurized water blasting out of the wall beside him, or maybe it was the sound of blood roaring between his ears.  It was difficult to tell.
"Why were you sleeping then?" Dean blurted. The tightness in his chest had eased a little in the face of Cas' nonchalance but he had to make sure he understood what was going on.
Dean gave a start when he heard footsteps on the stone alcove over their heads and looked up, reaching to grab the pommel of his sword but not drawing it just yet.  It would only make noise and give away their position.
"That was worse than the dog hair thing," he gasped as soon as he was sure he could open his mouth without incident.
“Ok so,” Sam licked his lips, brain nearly whirring audibly, “So him being underweight was one possibility.  The other one you said was…he’s smaller than most angels or something?  What does that mean?”
Finally, he emerged from within the crumbling tree, still using the joint of his wing like an extra hand, using the trunk – which was apparently still quite sturdy – to push himself to his feet.
Liam opened his mouth, but it was Cas, once again smelling his little tin of tea, that simply stated, “No.” from behind Dean.
Dean flopped back onto his bed and turned his back to Sam to give him some privacy, listening to him grumble about the best way to wash his hair – he couldn't resist making a jab about cutting it off – until he heard Sam pulling his pants back on and he rolled off the bed, catching the clean cloth his brother tossed at him.
Sam’s giant hand was on his wing, the touch hesitant.  But the weight of it was…surprisingly comforting.  Much like Dean’s touch had been.  He focused on it instead of the feeling of being crushed under an ever-growing mountain.
A cathedral ceiling loomed over their heads and a massive rectangular fire pit – at least eight feet long – sat sunken in to the middle of the Hall floor just like the one in The Bannered Mare.  Up near the ceiling, the smoke from the fire swirled laizly, drifting out the slats in the roof slowly.  On either side of the fire were two long tables filled with expensive looking place settings and some food here and there as if a feast had just ended.
“Yeah, he doesn't do much during the day but he's active at night.  You don't want to be caught out here after dark and Kynesgrove is still a few hours away.”  The woman rolled her bottom lip between her teeth, looking worried.
Cas filled them in as they trudged through the forest, stepping between tall trees and shaggy bushes as the last rays of light disappeared over the edge of the mountains and plunged them into darkness.  With the trees blocking most of the moonlight, picking their way over roots, rocks and uneven ground slowed their progress to a sluggish crawl.
She nodded and turned her attention back to Dean, her expression serious in a way that reminded Dean of television doctors breaking bad news to a patient’s family.
When the first rays of dawn light were waking the world with grey-ish pink overtones, Dean and Sam rounded another gentle bend in the road to see Castiel crouching beside an enormous, dead tree trunk.  The old tree was as big as a red wood but had been snapped off eight or so feet from the ground; jagged, weather-smoothed remnants of it's former glory jabbing into the air.  The trunk was hollow now, likely serving as a makeshift den for many animals over the years, and Cas had his head stuck in it, wings twitching and flaring for balance every time he tried to reach deeper into the hollowed-out trunk.
they pulled him out of the cage just to lock him up here. But he told himself to let the anger go; swallowed around a reflex to retch when he remembered just what they had saved him
“It wasn’t a theory,” Castiel corrected darkly. “I would recognize that particular stench of death anywhere.  Their magic leaves something toxic that lingers long after they have left.”
It wasn’t a great plan but it was the only plan they had at the moment.  Their only other option was wandering aimlessly from town to town and asking suspicious questions, which would likely involve the same amount of walking anyway.
His back hit the concrete wall with crushing and destructive impact.  He felt it give and crumble under his back; felt his true form rattle through his vessel's barrier again and groaned when he managed to land on his feet – though the only reason he didn't fall flat on his face was because he drove his sword into the floor and clung to it.
Besides, it somehow seemed different in this context.  From what he understood, an angel's wings were somewhat vulnerable and Cas wasn't used to having them visible.  He was probably feeling a bit exposed.
After talking to Liam for only a couple hours, Dean felt better than he had in weeks.  While the crushing weight of the task ahead still weighed heavily on his mind, it felt a tiny bit lighter.  It was clear Liam knew his stuff.  They had help now.  Experienced, professional, help.
"Cas?" he called gently. He placed his hand to the side of the angel's bloody face, using his thumb to push Cas' chin up a bit, trying to meet his gaze. "Cas? Hey, can you hear me, buddy?"
Deam had to wait until he was sure his voice wouldn’t shake, rubbing slowly up and down Cas’ arm, before he said.  “Well I’m here now.  And I’m gonna get you out of here, ok?”
Castiel had flinched away from his touch so hard that he nearly rolled off the bed and both his and Sam's initial reflex had been to grab him, keep him from falling to the floor. Their hands had no sooner touched him than Castiel was screaming with a primal, gut wrenching terror. He flung himself off the bed and scrambled away until his back hit the wall, where he'd curled into a terrorized, trembling ball and didn't move and it had all happened so fast, the brothers had been left standing in shock. Months without so much as a flutter of eyelids and then...
He thought of all the questions Cas used to ask them – and all the questions he still asks.  Cas was always trying to learn more about humans, trying to deepen his knowledge so he could understand and fit in to their lives better.  What had Dean done in return?
Dean briefly wondered why Crowley knew so much about binding spells for angels but decided he didn’t want to know.
When they walked through the library on their way to the kitchen, it was, of course, in the same state they'd left it in; an absolute mess.  Open books covered every inch of both long tables, stacks of closed ones they had yet to go through jutting out from within the swamp of books like the decaying pillars or some long forgotten stronghold.
eagerly, but there was no denying that the angel definitely wanted to be in that hot water five minutes ago.
Dean winced.  Was that all humans had bothered to learn about Cas’ species? How to snare, enslave, and dispose of them?
“You ok?”  Dean asked, just to be sure.  He got a breathless nod in response, blue light shining brightly through hooded eyes, so he moved one hand around to the front of Cas' jeans, dragging his hand across the hard bulge there in question.
“So,” Dean drawled into the comfortable silence.  They'd built up the fire again and set the cauldron aside, letting it cool.  “What's the plan.”
He watched Castiel practically press himself against the wall as he walked swiftly down the hallway.  Every few seconds he would glance over his shoulder, back the way he had come, then raise his eyes to land on Dean before looking ahead once more.
find her.  Maybe she just needs a few good fighters by her side.  Ah well, I best get back to work.  You lads might want to turn in sooner rather than later 'cause the chickens'll be waking you at dawn either way.” He chuckled as he walked away, leaving them by the fire.
Silence rang between the three of them and on some level Dean felt annoyed with how Cas was just sitting there calmly as if he knew he needed to wait for the two poor humans to wrap their tiny minds around the hugeness of what he'd just said.  He tried to make his brain process it faster merely out of spite; tried to get over the shock of it quicker than he normally would.
Castiel’s scowl deepened, but he turned to stare out the small window that was slowly icing over.  "I cannot
.”  Dean was blindsided by the question and it must have shown on his face, for as Mike checked off a box on the paper work, he explained.
Castiel refused to turn his back on Mary and she, in kind, seemed unwilling to move close enough to Castiel to sit at the table.
He was so broken he doubted even Naomi would be able to fix him, but for the first time, he found himself wishing she was still alive.  He’d have gotten in her chair willingly this time, if it meant she might be able to glue some of his pieces back together.  What good was he to anyone now?  He was chained, subdued, and useless, stuffed in a concrete box under the ground.
, Dean thought dejectedly.  So far, this entire hunt had been them following one flimsy lead to the next.  They were just wandering around in the dark hoping they might trip over something useful.
There was another name tied to that one and Castiel said it when it floated up from the back of his mind.
The weight of Dean's gaze drew Castiel's attention more than the movement of him turning from the stove, and he looked up to see the hunter giving him a strange look.
The books were swept closed and chairs skidded a few inches across the floor with a powerful beat of his wings.  Castiel took a moment to reign himself in.  He’d been…unaware just how heavily this issue had been weighing on him.  But the pounding of his vessel’s heart in tune with his grace was…revealing.
Cas' breathing was fast and shallow, his wings slowly spreading as he backed away from the memory of Dean hurting him. The burnt amber flight feathers fanned out, making his wings look like serrated blades, and the tips glowed like low-burning coals.
“Understandable given that you have suddenly returned from the dead after thirty years.  Resurrection, even when you are expecting it, can be a bit jarring.”
There was the usual stoic, confused by pop-culture, angelic warrior Castiel that Dean had known and fought beside for so many years and then now there was…this.
With no indication that he even realized that there was twenty people staring at him, Cas, again, led the way like he'd walked through the city a hundred times already and knew exactly where to go.  Though Dean supposed it was easy to guess that the Jarl would likely be in the big fancy building they'd seen sitting at the highest point in the city.
Castiel nearly pointed out that he already was, but then he realized it wasn’t his vessel’s eyes he was watching Dean with.
He could feel the evilness of Hell spreading through him like a disease, burrowing into his grace like larva into rotten meat and his entire being had been screaming for decades, with all the noise and ferocity of a collapsing star. Except, unlike a star, for
Unwanted, the image of two great eagles trapped in tiny metal cages made something in Dean's chest twinge and he glanced up in the mirror again, grimacing when he saw that Cas' eyes were closed now, as if he didn't want to look at the sky at all if he couldn't be up in it.
There was a palpable weight behind both her words and her gaze and Dean tried hard not to read too much into it.  There did not seem to be any hostility there, at least.
Dean shoved the limp body off him and pulled himself free of the splintered wood, looking around frantically in the sudden stillness.
But, surprisingly, Cas shrugged one shoulder, looking wholly unconcerned.  “It may just be that the message never reached them.  Communicating with them is...tricky.”
Once the wings had come out, the little flying excursions had started and it was lucky the bunker was as secluded as it was.  Cas and Hannah spent hours flying around the miles and miles of forest surrounding the bunker.  Sometimes, when there was nothing more pressing than the need to fight over Netflix, the two of them would leave the bunker at dawn and wouldn't return until sunset, squeezing through the bunker door with their cheeks red and hair wild from the wind, breathing hard and giggling, their eyes alight with shining grace, practically oozing happiness.
"If you get any closer to that fire you're going to burst into flame," Sam half joked while looking mildly concerned.
close, they believed.  And before the dark ages to keep us busy there wasn't much to do and it frequently got boring, watching over earth.  We,” a laugh huffed from Castiel's chest and it was such an uncharacteristically unintentional sounds that Dean looked up to stare at Cas' profile, his own lips tugging into a grin.  Cas was smiling with the fondness of a good memory, “We kept sneaking away from our posts to find something more interesting to do.  We spent a few years in India once, moving around with a pack of Bengal tigers.”
He thought about what Lucifer had told them, spitting the words out through the blood filling his mouth when he realized he was about to lose to the Winchesters
What Sam had said about Cas' wings matching his personality suddenly made a lot more sense.  Cas had always been deceptively soft and gentle on the outside...until he brought out his claws and you realized too late just how dangerous he was underneath.
Sam shook his head.  “No, I came straight here.  They likely wouldn’t let me see him anyway if he was put in the hospital by the police.”
“So, Sam, how have you been?  You are looking much better than the last time I saw you.”  He offered what he hoped was a somewhat pleased smile.  “I’m glad.  I was worried about you.”
Castiel brought the point of the blade to where he’d left off with the sigil.  When the brothers both reached for him, he looked over, met their gaze and calmly continued carving the sigil into his skin.  This one was intricate, and he had all his other eyes on it to make sure it was perfect.
“If you're still hungry,” Sam said, coming to stand beside him and watching the angel's bicker, “We could always cook the little birds flying around your head.  They probably taste just like chi -”
He nodded.  “It looked like blood.  Even though I knew it wasn't.”  Looking back on it now it seemed so simple and he felt foolish.  “I knew it wasn't.”
The bickering continued between the brothers for several more minutes, until Castiel finally snapped at them.
anything useful in them.  Which seems unlikely because besides that one page with the spell on it I can’t find
“How long have I been unconscious?”  Castiel asked.  He knew he was the reason behind that nauseated look on Dean’s face and didn’t want to dwell on it.  He had other, somewhat more pressing matters on which to dwell.
He didn't know who he might be talking to or if they were listening, but something ingrained deep in his consciousness made him say it, over and over.
"What the hell are you doing, Cas?"  Dean asked.  He watched intently as he noticed Cas was using the large, bony joint of his right wing to brace against the opening of the trunk as he leaned farther in, the other wing tucked close to his side and half inside the trunk with the rest of his body.
Jessy and Cesar were knocking on their door right when they said they would be and, after a round of sturdy hand shakes and smiles much wider than the ones Dean had last seen on their faces, they dug in to the burgers.
For a moment he let himself mourn the days where he could tell his vessel to do something and it would obey.  He could shut emotions off as easy as flicking a switch.  He could push muscle and bone and blood beyond their natural capacity.  He could rip his own arm off and beat someone with it if he’d felt compelled.
Cas swallowed the chunk of baked potato in his mouth and Dean swore he could see a little dusting of pink on his cheeks.
He decided not to mention that the pasta noodles were still sitting on the counter in their unopened box.
to help was overpowering. He could wrap Cas in heated blankets and use words to try and get him to understand how much he was loved and wanted, but Dean had realized too late that there were wounds inside Castiel that he could not reach. Wounds
“Wait, are we walking through the night?”  Dean asked.  “Cas, I gotta tell you I feel good right now but I don't have another ten hours of walking in me.  Not with all this gear – it weighs a ton.”
Next to them, a young man in a fur cap and pale green tunic was heaving a huge hunk of meat into the wooden cart of woman in a plain green dress.  A boy that looked no older than eleven or so cut his way through the small market space, a big grey dog that looked a lot like an Irish Wolfhound lumbering along behind him.  When the dog stopped to sniff curiously at the meat stall, the boy whistled sharply, and the dog reluctantly followed him down the street.
But the thought of confessing to Hannah what he'd done made his stomach churn and he turned back to check the pots sitting on the hot stone.  There was steam billowing out from under the lid, which meant the clams would almost be done and he grabbed the handle, shimmied the pot a bit to resettle them, and tried to breath in the smell of whisky reducing down, wishing he could find a little courage from it just like he would a drink.
All in all, it was a dim and sad place, efficiency having edged out any kind of warmth long ago.  It was a harsh reminded that there were things just as dark and dangerous to fight outside of demons and vampires.  In some ways, the kinds of battles some of these people were fighting in their heads were considerably more difficult.
When they came to the intersection in the cobblestone road, Cas turned right, and they began a steady but thankfully shallow climb up switchbacks that had been cut into the hill and woven between large boulders and chunks of rock that had broken away from the mountain ages ago and were ever so slowly being overtaken by earth and foliage.  Tall pine trees began to dot the landscape, more and more of them rising up from the ground the closer to the mountain base they got, and the sound of the rushing rapids in a narrow river to the East was a quiet hum against the backdrop of gentle bird song and the breeze passing through the surrounding trees.
A crushing force ground his muscles against his bones, and he screamed, the suddenness of it even more jarring than the pain.
Dean suddenly remembered that he had a really big knife in his hand and he lept dazedly into action, finally allowing himself to look at the angel properly.
Dean fished around for something reassuring to say but came up empty handed.  He obviously couldn’t relate but, glancing behind him and around the room he tried to imagine how he would feel if he suddenly took up twice as much space as he normally did.  The room seemed much smaller from the new point of view.
The water was slowly seeping up the legs of Cas' jeans, the denim drawing the water up like a sponge.  Cas didn't move, only made another aborted attempt to look Dean in the eye and then half turned like he intended to walk right into the open ocean and hide from his problems with the fish.
Although, it wasn't all that dissimilar, he supposed.  He and Castiel were farther apart than even John and Pochahontas.  Separated not only by race, custom and home land, but by species, millennia and entire galaxies.  Pochahontas had loved John, and it was her love for him that ended up killing her.
,” Dean tried order but it sounded more like he was begging.  He grabbed both of Cas’ shoulders and squeezed hard.  “Cas,
,’ Dean numbly corrected himself.  He dunked the soapy plate in his hands back into the sink, scrubbing at a bit of dried cheese that was refusing to let go.
“There are a few things we need to discuss before we can leave, and a few precautions we must take,” Castiel told them, breezing past Dean.
Mary’s eyes darted to Castiel again, taking in the freshly glowing sigil on his chest.  Her lips thinned and Castiel could smell the unease – already permeating the air around her – spike when she looked at him.  She knew he was the one to blame.
“He’s not my -” the officer shouldered the door open and they stepped in to the room; Dean bit his tongue, immediately knowing what the two of them would see:
The point of his blade hovered at the topmost curve of the sigil and there was a heave in his guts at the thought of having to cut through the fresh scar tissue again.  He’d never been the queasy type, had never hesitated to hurt himself if it was necessary, but the thought of bringing the needle-like point to the delicate skin – the edges of which were so, so irritated and inflamed from all the previous cuts – made him feel sick.
Beside him, Sam ran a hand through his sopping wet hair, slicking it back over his head to keep it out of his eyes.  His brother’s five o’clock shadow was nearly a beard now, Dean noticed, and for a moment he had to wrestle a bark of laughter into submission.  There was definitely some ginger in his brother’s beard and he was going to make fun of him as soon as they were safe and out of the rain.
For what felt like the hundredth time since they'd coaxed the story from Cas, Dean wondered what the catch was here, because he didn't think Cas would put himself through such a taxing venture just to help a bunch of strange monks.  Although, perhapse, like the brothers, he had just been bored.
“Cas,” Sam said, drawing his attention.  “What did it look like?  Was that what started everything?”
He was about to ask what time it was when he realized it didn't really matter and with a gargantuan effort, heaved himself into a sitting position.
"Night shade,” Cas informed them, carefully placing the flowers in the little pouch on his hip.  "Relatively rare in this climate.  They make a powerful toxin when combined with other ingredients."
After a few minutes of steadily rising voices, Castiel lifted his head out of his pillow enough to remind them, “This is how our last three days got started, perhaps you could both stop yelling.”
