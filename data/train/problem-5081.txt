Dean stared him.
“Usually it’s demons clamoring to get
changed because of this new position?”
It was the middle of the night and still the light of the angels against the horizon. The bed, which was usually bathed in darkness, was cut with the sharp edges of a searing brightness, the merest glimpse of which had yet crawled over them. The sky overhead was still deep and soundless, without stars. The stars—well, they were on the ground, advancing with blades. Fucking celestials. Alastair hated them more than ever. He looked over at Dean, lying beside him, sleepy with a grin. Pressed his hand to the Winchester’s soft hair, petting absently. Watched the tension drain out of him, the look in his eyes losing their usual edge. He liked the softness, too—when it was directed at him. Liked it when he remembered how well he’d taught the boy to carve.
“Hey don’t give me that look,” replies Jake, defensively.
“What the…?” he rubbed the blood off onto his suit, and looked at the grey stain it left behind. But on his hand, the fresh blood was still a brilliant red. Cas walked back into his office, staring at his hand.
"Just you. Anything you want. Touch me. Hurt me. Ah—"
Dean was in the kitchen, making dinner with Jack, when Cas came in from work. “How was your day at the office?” Dean asked.
Uriel gave him a look. “There’s an extra zero on your paycheck. Now get to work before I take it away again. You’re late.”
“As always,” Alastair said drily.
Her apartment in the upper city was well-warded, the closets filled to the brim with paraphernalia she'd collected over thousands of years; the main room, however, was bare of any personal touches. One creaky bed was pushed almost absently against the wall, and every so often Meg would collapse on top of it, becoming dead to the world. She'd spent more time there than she'd have liked recently, what with being banished to Hell by the Winchesters twice. Instead of decorating, she'd taken long walks through the city, daring anyone to look at her wrong. If they did, she killed them.
The police had not found anyone to arrest for the death of Zachariah. In fact, they did not know that Zachariah was dead. They only knew he was missing, although they had their suspicions.
He was running now.
“Hey!” the fishmonger snapped at him. “Don’t even think about it!”
better not get caught.”
Alastair gave him a flat look. "Really, Dean? After all this time and you still don't believe in Him?"
“Yes,” says Cas, grimly. “It’ll be just like when you’re reading those Asian magazines when you think I’m not looking.”
. The poor damned thing was in his element under Alastair’s thumb, just as he should be. Fuck Lilith. Fuck her and her smarmy ways. ‘Others just grovel and scrape.’ He’d been doing this for more than aeons; just because that stuck-up bitch was the first demon she thought she was so special. He thought about what she’d said: The Archangel Michael parading around in the guttered remnants of this gorgeous boy. What a fucking waste.
It was endless darkness for a long time. The only way Dean could pinpoint direction was by the glowing light of the portal behind him, which grew smaller and smaller until it was a single burning pinprick, like a distant fire. Dean had thought this place might be crowded, if it was filled with every angel or demon that had ever died; he’d imagined it as a sort of frozen purgatory, with everyone piled on the ground asleep. But he’d realized he’d assumed too much, like that there would even be “ground” in the first place. The endless space had no up or down, forward or back, and there was no sense of space within the nothingness at all. For something so vast, it was the most claustrophobic afterlife he’d ever been in, nothing like the ever-moving terrain of Purgatory, Heaven, or Hell. There was nothing to interact with or to fight; there was no sounds, no sight, and no touch, and as he moved, he began to wonder if he was even moving, or only imagining that he did. The only thing that reassured him he was actually getting somewhere was by looking back at the portal and seeing it fade into the distance.
“It’s pretty cool,” Dean said offhandedly, leaning against the sill next to him, his gaze opened on the view.
“No, you haven’t.”
"Is that what you wanted?"
They spent the next forty minutes sticking the hairpin in the keyhole, twisting it around, alternately swearing and dropping it. But, somehow, eventually, they did manage to get inside.
“Don’t make me ask twice.”
“Damn thing swore its allegiance to Him, y’know. I wouldn’t’ve guessed if I hadn’t’ve seen it myself.”
It was then that Uriel stepped into the room, and despite seeming overly-casual, he had a sense of extreme gravity that caused the entire room to glance up in nervous anticipation.
"They're coming for you."
Cas was seated and in handcuffs inside the single holding cell. Ben and Jerry stood outside with their arms crossed.
“True,” Dean agreed.
. He’d never needed or wanted anything about Earth. Didn’t know why everyone went so gaga over it. It’s a religious matter, he reminded himself.
“If I could do better, I would. But the Empty is one of the earliest beings. As powerful as God… hacking through it and keeping a portal open won’t exactly be easy.”
“Or maybe,” Cas said pointedly, “they’re just talking, like friends do.”
Uriel didn’t pause on Cas’ face, just kept scanning, before putting the bug back in his pocket and walking out.
It felt like being saved.
His dream was a memory. They’d just made it out of Apocalypse World and saved the hunters there, and somehow an impromptu party had started. For the first and only time, the bunker being filled with people had felt exciting. Every public area was filled with people laughing, drinking and talking; and someone had put a phone into a glass and was playing some party songs playlist while a whole group of hunters had started dancing.
He looked out at the still air. The view beyond the window, that mighty, Heavenly force.
In the dream, Dean was terrified. But he didn't run. Somehow—it was as though he couldn't.
It paused. From inside its sleeve, it took a shining sword, taller than Bela herself—
is used to mean "seraph" "serpent" and "fiery/burning" (or "fiery flying serpent" or dragon) depending on where it appears.
"Of course," Alastair said, sending him a lazy grin. "You were a hunter; you have experience with these things. Well Dean, welcome to the other side.
“Wow,” Dean said. “And here I thought they were all goody-two-shoes.”
Before he got two feet, Cas reached out, grabbing his arm and pulling him back. “No,” he said.
“I’m 41, dude,” Dean said, with a smirk. “I think I can handle a cosmic being on my own.”
When he awoke, his face was wet; his lips tasted of salt.
The baby in the basket glitched. A boy—perhaps in his teens or early twenties—now stood beside the table. “Hello,” he said, with an awkward, cheerful wave. “It’s nice to meet you! My name is Jack.”
“The businessman from the lake,” said Jerry. “Zachariah.”
They opened the door and walked in.
Uriel took that moment to stroll into the room, upon which Balthazar took his feet off the desk and Cas began signing documents. As soon as Uriel exited, Balthazar turned toward Cas and winked.

“I wouldn’t say no.” Dean had never been more emotional about the prospect of being nailed.

The stench of rotting things was full in the air. At his back, the light was burning, red as blood.

“Man,” Dean said, taking the book back. “You had one job.”
“It’s not about him helping save Cas,” Sam said. “Not really. I mean, I understand why he might not wanna show up and piss off another cosmic being by stealing what’s…

Sandover was just as inhospitable when it was empty as when it wasn’t. The corridors were long and echoed when they tried to walk quietly through them. None of the lights were on, so even though it was sunny outside, they were moving through gloom. They walked through empty rooms filled with typewriters and stacks of paper, with nameplates glinting from a select few, and they walked through cubicles, and past closed and locked doors, until they finally got to Uriel’s office. Cas stared at the door. “I don’t have a key for this one,” he said.
“…Right,” Dean said.
"Hey, I've never seen him, I reserve the right to think it's just a story to keep poor shmucks in line," Dean said with a shrug.
Alastair grunted again.

“Well, I asked Anna to look into it,” Cas continued. “I felt that Uriel was doing something underhanded with the Essential Venue for Integrated Labefaction, and nobody else at Sandover seems appropriately suspicious.”
In the light, everything was made red; the solemn trees, the half-forgotten sky. Though the earth swallowed the sound of his footsteps, there was a ringing that set the dry branches to shivering; some broke with a sharp crack and fell to the ground. The light felt as warm as honey, and as slow. It called to him to turn around.
“Yes, he’s here in the Empty with me.”
“Alastair,” Dean started, and met Alastair’s blank white gaze. “Is there something… wrong?” What a dumb thing to ask.

“Really?” Belphagor said, looking at Jack. “Guess so.”
“It’s a new flick,” Belphagor said. “From the boys up in Hollywood.”
Cas picked it up. “Hello? Winchester residence,” he said. “Oh, hello Anna! Really? That’s terrible! Are you sure? Yes, I’ll be there right away.” He hung up.
The sun was getting lower in the sky as Castiel walked home from work. He passed the park, and the barber shop with its white-and-grey twirling sign. He went down the street toward his home, and saw, on the corner, the stop sign, which was red. Cas glared at it as he passed.
Trading work days wasn’t exactly unheard of in Hell. Since, apart from food and sex, there wasn’t exactly any other reward on offer. Dean had spent a lot of time trying very hard to impress upon Alastair that he wasn’t a slacker. A low, clammy feeling in his gut told him he might’ve screwed that up.
The pain wasn’t anything new; he’d felt worse, had worse ways to die. And honestly? This wasn’t top of the list, not even close, but something about it felt different. It had nothing to do with the blade pulled back out of his chest or the bubbling tang crawling up his throat, and everything to do with the look of reverence in Sam’s eyes, which were filled with tears, big, weepy tears that Dean brushed away with the pad of his fingers, and the calm certainty of Castiel’s presence before him, the ocean blue of his gaze.
“We’ll be in my room if you need us,” Jack said. Belphagor smiled at Dean and Cas and followed Jack upstairs. Dean and Cas looked after them, hearing the door closing, then loud rock music playing.
“There isn’t a school,” Jack said.
“Balthazar, you’re too old for trick-or-treating.”
Outside, the night was dark and removed, and if God was watching, so what. This wasn’t about him at all. It never had been, and maybe it had taken Dean too long to realize that, but he was getting there.
Alastair laughed a little, a small, wheezing chuckle like it had been surprised out of him. “Ah, Dean, you’re cute.”
Cas nodded, with a little shrug. “I suppose he was,” he admitted. He squinted at Uriel questioningly. “Do

The ruler of the Empty didn’t pounce on him. There was no evil presence looking over his shoulder. In fact, there was no presence at all. He could’ve been the only person to exist in the whole universe. Dean kept walking, but started to wonder if he would keep on walking until his time had run out, getting nowhere.
The radio on the counter had been on and muttering static for ages, but now it cleared into a song:
Dean took a drink, and didn’t quite realize when the blur of the movie had drifted away, and he’d fallen into an exhausted sleep.
. Without thinking, Dean threw the mug away from him—against the wall—overcome by a wave of fear and frustration. The cup shattered with a crash, and a dark stain dripped down the formerly pristine surface. Cas stared in astonishment.
“Yeah?” Dean said, distracted. “Do what you like, man, do what makes you happy.” The statement came out harsher then he’d intended. The coffee seemed to be inching its way across the inside of his cup, as though some kind of suction were drawing it along the sides. Dean flinched, and a bit of coffee spilled onto his hand.
you to go to work today,” Dean said.
Rowena recited the incantation and purple energy shot from her hands. A dark fissure opened up in the wall. Sam and Dean walked towards it, but stepped back quickly when the portal squelched to half its size.
Dean stared at the phone for a second. “For what?!”
“So,” she said. “Give me the scoop. Dean Winchester. Still making daddy proud?”
“Dean,” Cas said, lowly, and Dean could feel the vibrations of it, shivering close enough to brush his neck with warmth, to sear his bones. “What deal did you make? What did you
“And he agreed to this?” Dean said. “Or are we just working on… blind faith here?”
he reminded himself.
“I don’t know how many times I have to say it, I never slept with that woman’s husband.”
She couldn't bring herself to regret it.
Time crawled. Occasionally, Alastair would sing, the echoes bouncing back to meet them. In between was silence, and they sat across from each other in the circle. Neither wandered; the forbidding nature of the mountains was too clear; it was as though they were there on sufferance. And what would they even look for if they did wander? More sharp points, more melted metal ground; cliff-faces that dropped sheer into the mist below. Above, the sky was empty.
Sam and Dean looked toward it, and Dean realized that there was no way they were going to even get through the portal, let alone back out.
“Oh come on, Cas,” Balthazar said.
The manacles breached the meat of her flexor and with a scream, she fell lower, feet driving into the ground crawling with ants. She made a choked sob that Dean couldn’t help grinning at.

“Yeah, maybe,” Dean said, looking up toward the stairs. “Or doing drugs,” he said, a suspicious look on his face. “Or eating
“What about it?” Balthazar said.

Dean went to the kitchen and grabbed a whole unopened pack of beer, carrying it into the Dean Cave and shutting the door. It was dark in there, but Dean didn’t bother to turn on the light, making his way through the gloom with his phone flashlight. He sat down in his chair and stared ahead, putting the beer down on the floor beside him, and feeling alone enough, in the dark and the chill, to let himself cry.
The End
“Fine,” Cas said.
Sam looked at Dean worriedly. “I don’t know, Dean,” he said. “Cas might be right. We did the spell, Cas should’ve gotten out by now.” But instead, the form that had seemed to clear a moment ago was getting swallowed in the blackness.
, Dean,” Cas said, annoyed. “The police station.”
“There’s a way for you to come out?” Dean asks.

If he just looked away from the edge it wasn't too bad. Brought back a flash of memory, weirdly enough; picking his way down a slope not too different from this one, when? Sometime when he was a kid? He remembered swaying from side to side. Riding a donkey? Not much else. Terrified he'd fall, or that Sammy would. Had they been to the Grand Canyon?
And Dean let out a breath. He’d known the silence, dead crypt silence, had had him freaked; it reminded him of those times late in the Leviathan purge when he and Sam had rolled through so many empty towns; it reminded him of Croatoan, and Hell in between the interesting bits; it reminded him of the Bunker’s dungeon, last sleepless night, when he’d shook and the buzz of the emergency phone rang and he’d thought;
Dean crouched down on his heels to speak with the sapling face-to-face. "Hey," he said quietly.
“Dean,” Sam said, very seriously. “If you are gonna not take care of this problem, I swear I’m gonna go out and marry the first blurry-looking person I see, just to get out of here. Maybe you don’t care about living in a crap-heap, but I don’t want to.”
He didn't even notice when he finally came until it had happened, and he was spurting onto the shining metal ground.
“You have
The sapling rustled in his hands. "Where are we going?" they craned their branches around, and their leaves shook. "I don't think this is the right way. The light is back there."
“Cas!” Dean said.
"That's why we're not staying here," Alastair said. "The lava's a magical nullifier that will quickly disperse the trail of our teleportation. Plus, the sigils around the place will stop any angel from entering. The seraph will have to bring down the whole cave if it wants to get in, and by that time, any trace of our whereabouts will be wiped out by the angel's own power."
“What the hell are you watching?” Dean asked.
The screen… glitched.
“That’s true,” said Cas. “It’s somewhat of a miracle.” His eyes widened at that realization. “Dean…” Cas said, staring at his husband in breathless awe, “you’re like the Virgin Mary.”
Alastair ripped Dean's shirt into thin strips and made a circumference of them. Inside, he drew the angel warding again:
Dean shook his head. He was being morbid, probably because he was bored. It wasn’t that Dean was discontent with being a homemaker—he loved it—but he just had this strange feeling that there should be something
, the voice in his head warned.
“And nothing. It was just annoying. The amount of time he strolls through here like a watchdog, as if he’s worried we’re slacking off!” Balthazar said, leaning back, legs crossed on his desk, opening a tin of peanuts and popping a few in his mouth.
What kind of town only had two kids in it? Dean thought. Something about that seemed concerning. But not as concerning as what happened next, which wiped those thoughts from his head completely.
“It’s in your job description,” Balthazar said. “If you don’t like it, quit.”
“She could lose her job over that!”
When Alastair touched his shoulder, Dean flinched, spinning around.
The last time they’d watched a movie in here had been before Mary died. Dean hadn’t come in since; no reason to, really.
Below the bulk of the army, close enough that its scales, which rippled past the meathook-chains, looked like shining cables dappled with purple, green, and red scales, was the serpent. She couldn't tell how large it was, because of the way it curled under and over itself, but it was vaster than the platform, vaster than the chains, and its continuous movement reminded her of a roiling sea. Its wings were like shards of glass, casting a shattered prism of reflection onto her bruised knees. When it opened its mouth, the air became filled with flame, and flame raced along the length of its scales as though it were burning, turning into a streak of continual fire.
Cas looked uncomfortable. “Oh,” he said, taking the book out of his trench coat. “My apologies. I’m afraid your privacy has been compromised.”
The shot zoomed out to reveal that somehow, while no one was paying attention, this had, in fact, come to pass.
“I’m at the station.”
, Dean thought, walking away. He couldn’t wait for this kid to go home.
, Alastair thought. Then:
Sam glances at the television, looking away just as quickly. “Uh, okay. Let me know if you uh, need anything.” He leaves the motel room awkwardly and sits on a bench outside. He texts Eileen to keep himself busy.
, Dean thought mulishly. But that, of course, he couldn’t say.
“What cuts?” Jack asked. “I’m gonna go make myself a sandwich,” he said, walking into the kitchen. Dean looked after him in undisguised worry.
MY MAKER WAS DIVINE AUTHORITY,
It had been a pretty good shirt. Dean didn't exactly begrudge it this second life, but he was cold, and colder without it. He crossed his arms and stood within the circle, hoping the seraph would get his ass down here asap so they could leave. He felt exposed; whenever he moved inadvertently or scuffed his foot against the metal ground, the echo crawled back around as though it was trying to aim for his neck. He had to fight the urge to scan the place constantly, as though looking for whatever it was that was watching him. There was no place for anything corporeal to hide. And if it wasn't—well, Dean wouldn't exactly be able to kill it.
, he reminded himself.
Uriel twirled a small metal device in his hand, looking at it as though interested in what it was.
“Shut up,” said Dean. He turned to Rowena. “What do I have to do?”
“...I’m sure.”
It appeared as though it was sitting beside him, the constant, slow-moving coils gleaming as though in lamplight, wound around the dead trees. Its wings, six of them, moved like a constant breath, in and out, and in and out, and in. They enclosed the sky as though covering him, protecting him in a glittering cave. Its colors stained Dean's hands sea-green, and its flank was like a banked fire.
As Alastair left the room, the crying fell silent, suddenly, with a sharp
Sometimes Alastair would go slow. Not content until he had wrung every last yes from Dean's aching throat, he would leave Dean just as silently, spent on his back under the sunless sky, his nails blackened with dirt.
Dean was ready for the pain of teleportation this time; it only took him a moment to recover and look around.
“I know,” said Cas. “You have to listen to me Dean, they said I don’t have much time.”
Alastair cracked a smile. “Sure.”
Dean stared at him for a moment, flustered. “Okay, yeah. That was a good one.”
“They’ve
There was such an assortment of demons on either side; tall and hunched with greyish skin, short and bundled up, with any number of claws and tails, that it was easy to lose sight of the sagging buildings to one side; squat, dour things with unlit windows and peeling paint. Death-rattle coughs made their way from some of the lower windows, where, like pale moons, Dean caught the glimpse of hollow faces peering from basement apartments. And that was only what made it in past the piles of huts and shacks that had been built one on top of the other, as though eager to reach the water. There were all sorts of fresh delicacies: liver and spleen, hipbones, virgin blood (cut with the blood of sinners but still exorbitantly pricey), something which purported to be 100% PURE BABY MEAT but looked a lot more like a cut of lean adolescent. It would have been easy, if you stood still for a moment, to become trampled to death in the crowd, and Dean noticed there were a few that apparently had; broken bodies scrabbling for purchase under the constant press of heels; faces that tried to pull at his shoes with gnashing teeth until he kicked them in the jaw. Through it all, Alastair tugged him unerringly ahead until they’d broken out of the crowd onto the edge of the bay, and they rested for a moment on the rotting edge of a sagging boardwalk. Grey dinghies pushed off from the seawall, children threw pebbles, trying to get them to land in the mouths of drowning souls. In the further distance, ghost ships flickered in and out of a fog bank that moved with them, covering the rest of the waters from view.
After twenty minutes of walking in complete silence except for the creepy noises of the forest, they see something in the distance, something glowing blue.
"Wait a minute, that back there was something you do every time?" Sam asks as he closes the door behind him.
"It was, and I yelled at them for it and the date was over," Vanessa mumbles, graciously taking the fishing pole from Dean. "We don't have any bait," she glances over at Dean who only now realizes that.
"Then what is it then?"
"Well I hoped you two had a great one," the man says cheerfully as he hands them their things in a little baggy. "That'll be ten eighty please."
"Do they have pie?" Dean asks somewhat quietly.
"Oh sorry, okay give me your hands," he says offering his hands, she swims closer to the edge and grabs his soft hands. He crouches down towards her to get a better grip and pulls her out of the water with ease.
"What? Oh no, they have like a billion different types of animals there, Bobby took us here once, and it was amazing," Dean grins. "Trust me you'll like it, love it even."
"You're so beautiful, you know that?" Dean hums, planting a kiss on Vanessa's wet hair. "And I can't believe you are all mine," he pulls her closer to his bare chest, leaving another kiss on her right temple.
Dean lets out a pitiful sound and worms his way into his blankets, making sure every part of him is covered.
"Thank you, Castiel," Vanessa murmurs as she slowly falls asleep in his arms.
Sliding over to their pantry, Dean plucks a half-empty box of pancake mix and sets it on the counter. He balances the egg carton and milk in both hands before pouring the right amount of ingredients into a large mixing bowl. Then he adds the "secret ingredient" (a splash of vanilla extract) before mixing it all.
"Thanks," Dean says as he buckles up too. He drives from underneath the small birch tree and manages to turn around in the narrow road and starts driving towards the exit.
"Damn," Dean snaps his fingers. "Missed the best one!"
He grabs a flashlight, his gun, extra ammo for the said gun, and a knife that he can store in his boot for emergencies. He turns on the flashlight to make sure it still works.
"Thanks, now, get in the water," Castiel turns her towards the pool.
"You did?" Dean asks confused.
"Morning sleepyhead," Dean tries to be as nonchalant as possible. He hears Tim stretch loudly and pops his back, which makes Dean's backache.
Dean shakes his head. This isn't a date, a date requires two people, in Dean's book. Someone pays for the whole thing if it's a first date (like dinner), and both people have to at least like each other, it can't be one-sided. That is exactly why this isn't a date. It's a friend date! No that's still a date, this is nothing like a date.
"Don't go giving all my secrets away" Vanessa says as she walks toward them with a sly smile on her face.
"All I did was heat it up," he mutters.
Dean violently shakes his head no. Vanessa slowly approaches him, holding out the mug, showing him what it is. She slowly sits on the bed, she hands it to him, making sure her hand doesn't touch his. He looks at it and frowns, he lifts it up to his nose and takes a big whiff of it and gags.
As soon as it reaches her it stops in mid-air, "you really tried that?" Vanessa asks and chuckles. Vanessa lifts her arm in the air and both boys' jaws drop, from her shoulder fading to her fingers all of Vanessa's veins light up the same pink color of her hair. She twirls her finger in a circle and the knife follows. Slowly the knife turns from her head to the old witches.
Vanessa walks past the coffee table and pauses before the front door, she turns her head to look at Castiel. He's slightly leaning forward to help his large black wings. "You'll have to take off that coat sweetie, " she says with a smile. He nods and slowly starts to take it off as Vanessa walks past the stairs towards the kitchen. She walks through the archway, turns the overhead light on, walks past the table, and walks straight towards her herb cabinet, she grabs what she needs and all the bandages that are inside and an emergency bottle of whiskey.
"So, tell me all about your case," Vanessa says as she swiftly walks back to the boys. She hands everyone their beers and takes a seat next to Bobby, with a snap of her fingers all of the beers open and the bottle caps land on the coffee table.
"I am assuming you asked zomething, and correct me if I am vrong, but zoday is Zhursday, June 3, my birthday/hatchday," Vanessa guesses.
"I could never forget such a pretty face," he says patting where she stuffed the piece of paper with her number on it.
"Will you stay with me tonight?" Vanessa asks lowly.
Feel free to leave comments and kudos, I'll try to respond to them as quickly as I can!
"A book that Cas brought, haven't read that much into it yet, hopefully, it can shed some light on why we can see his wings," Vanessa holds up the book for Dean to see. "Suppose to be about their anatomy, so it'll be fun I guess."
"Oh God, I'm going to make it up to him" Vanessa declares, "you two probably don't wanna hear how, but I can make my walls soundproof."
“Stop!”
“I thought I’d come in today since I have a bit of spare time. I just got off school. It could really do me some good, coming in here as much as possible. Confessing will keep me from further sin.” The Pastor raised a brow but didn’t comment further, just guided the young man into the confession booth.
“I’ll be down once I wash up!” He called back, quickly making his way to the bathroom. While washing his hands, he glanced up into the mirror only to see Jimmy standing right behind him.
“Yeah, whatever. What I mean is, that was some major eye candy waltzin’ out of that church today, right?” Jimmy wiggled his eyebrows, a smirk present on his face.
When Castiel entered his house it was like someone had turned down the saturation of the world. All the colours had faded, leaving a whole lot of greys and blues that looked like greys.
“What? You’re seriously going on a hunt alone?” Dean scoffs, “I’m 26, dude. I’m pretty sure I can handle myself just fine, I mean, I was pretty well by myself when you decided to run away to college.” Sam opened and closed his mouth, no words deciding to leave. Dean shakes his head, because he knew that his brother had no argument against him. He was right.
“I uh- I just need to talk to the Pastor and get home, I can’t be late, I’m sorry.” His words were genuine, and Dean didn’t want to keep him if he had to be somewhere. “Oh, yeah, of course. Alright, well do you mind if I give you my number? Maybe I can pick your brain a little later?” He didn’t get a response right away, so he just took it as a yes as he pulled a card with his phone number written across it from his pocket and passed it to the slightly shorter man. The card was taken from his hand with only a fraction of hesitation.
The other guy nodded anyway, a curious look spreading across his face before it just dropped all together.
“I didn’t wake you, did I?” The man asks, suddenly sounding guilty.
Castiel is a boy who lives in a small and quiet town full of religious families, his included. He liked it in that small quiet town. He grew up there, went to school there, saw other people make friends there… he was never the type to have friends, he was a bit of a loner all throughout school. He focused on his studies more than anything, he had to work hard so he could get into the medical field to make his parents proud, so he considered the fact that he had no distractions a blessing. He had one person he talked to, although sometimes he thought he could be a bad influence on him, but he kept him company. And he was okay with that life in that small and quiet town, living in his house with his perfect family, cracking down on his studies, attending the church every Sunday and whenever his father suggested they should pay an extra visit. That was until the biggest distraction of all decided to crash down into his life in a way that was anything but smooth.
“And the other place I… Father at…. Thought it would be good if I came down here, come check out the place?” He winces, mentally kicking himself as the words left his mouth.
“I was just calling to see if we could meet up. You know, since you wanted to ask me some questions?”
“Bless us, O Lord, and these, thy gifts, which we are about to receive from Thy bounty…” Castiel and his father both join in and they all say their grace before ending with, “Amen.”
“Goodbye, Pastor Jim.” The blue-eyed man said, something resembling a smile on his face. When he left the church he breathed in the fresh air. Castiel felt a little less trapped out here, but not really. He knew it wouldn’t last long, the feeling of calm would disappear. He had to go home.
“Jimmy, please. Can you not use such vulgar language?” He heard a snort from across the room.
“Right… have you noticed anything strange the last couple of days? Cold spots, weird noises or smells?”
Eventually he stumbled across a website that had information on the town’s biggest church, which was only their only church for that matter. Dean rolled his eyes exaggeratively at that but continued reading. Honestly, if he thought about it, he probably should have looked closely into it sooner. The site said that the church had been built in 1987. And before it was built, the area beneath it had been a cemetery. No matter how hard he looked into that piece of information, he could not find anything on
“Jerk…”
He realised that he’d been staring when the man gave him a puzzled look.
When he was about to leave the church’s, he noticed another man, his face turned to the ground. He looked like the regular church goer type. When he looked up from the ground, the young man’s eyes darted from Dean to the Pastor and then back to Dean. Dean gasped quietly, hoping the sound didn’t reach anyone else. But he couldn’t help it, those eyes. They were the prettiest shade of blue he’d ever seen on another person, he felt like he could stare into them all day and not even get bored, they were like-
He went downstairs, seating himself in front of one of the plates of food. His mother smiled at him before reaching out her hand to take his. His father did the same, only minus the smile. Of course. The family closed their eyes as Naomi began saying grace.
“Of fucking course.” The young man mumbled too himself a little too loudly, getting a scolding look from an elderly lady sitting across from him. He mumbled a quiet, ‘sorry’, checking his watch before packing up his things and heading for the library’s exit. It was almost noon. He’d have to find out more about the church later, for the moment what he had to focus on was making it to the diner and getting whatever info he could out of his blue-eyed mystery man.
There was a deadfall in the forest, half-filling a hollow in the ground. The broken limbs of the fallen trees had crowded over one another into a precarious lattice into which sediment had gathered. Good dirt, this was, and not the salted earth underneath. In that tiny space grew a black-leaved sapling.
“I’m not gonna leave you, Cas. Even if I could, I wouldn’t.”
“In good time,” Alastair said. “Once we’ve gotten far enough away. I promise I’ll explain everything.”
Belphagor groaned. “You’re no help,” he said.
weak it was, but Alastair was the one with the know-how, so it must be possible.
"...You're serious." Dean said. He thought for a moment. "That makes no fucking sense. What the fuck?" he sat up, grimacing at the twinge of protest his body made at the movement. "The devil's just a story they tell at demon sunday school."
The janitor, picking up his stuff, gave Cas a nasty eye. “Watch where you’re going,” he said. Cas winced down at his hand as he stood up, and then stopped short—there was a red cut on his hand. He looked at it, confused.

•Alastair's garden is inspired by a short fic I read once and unfortunately didn't keep track of; it was a creepy Dean & Alastair torture fic where everything was botanically inspired. If I find it again, I'll add the name.
“It’s been forever since we’ve played a game,” Cas said.
She thought a lot about the apocalypse. Not about the destruction they'd get to ravage on Earth, not about the prizes that might be found there—stories and whispers already passing through the streets that it was time, it was time; didn't you see the angels attacked? It's starting—

“Dude!”
ONE Magazine, published from 1953 to 1967, was the first pro-gay magazine in America.
“Oh you’re one to talk. Whadda you sign, one contract an hour?”
Cas glared too, fists clenched as though he were seriously considering punching the entity right in his nasty little bearded smirk.
"I thought I was alone," the sapling said, at last, as though in wonder. "I woke up and I was alone. There was nothing on either side but abandoned forest. I couldn't move, but I grew upward toward a sun that doesn't exist in this sky. But now you!"
“Maybe,” Cas said.
“Hey, Cas,” he said, and fuck if his voice didn’t shake. He didn’t want to do this in front of God, didn’t want his emotions playing across the cosmic screen; it pulled something twisted from low in his belly, felt like grief. And still, still he felt like shouting in triumph, just flipping his middle finger to fate, because Cas was back; he reached down to help the angel up, and—slipped. Like there was a buzzing between his fingers and Cas’s, a sort of oily nothingness, a repelling force, stopping them from making contact. He stared down, and Cas stared up, and for a moment Dean almost screamed, almost cried, almost curled down on the blacktop and refused to move like that would change a thing. Then he stepped back, letting Cas get up on his own, and swung his gaze back to Chuck.
“Isn’t it?” Cas cocked an eyebrow.
Nothing in the kitchen seemed ready to answer his musings, however.
“Dean?” Cas’ eyes stared sightlessly forward, but he knew Dean was there—of course he knew.
. Dean knew. But right now it didn't seem to matter. The more he climbed, the more the adrenaline chased away his aches and pains; the higher he got, the more the crisp new scent of ozone carried, replacing the crackling heat of lava. When he heaved himself over the lip of the canyon and stood facing the way he'd come, he could see it properly: the storm. It lit the edge of the horizon; in the gaps between flashes of lightning, instead of empty sky, he saw a moving shape, dark against dark; something undulating, circling. He couldn't make out what it was, knew only that it was coming nearer. For too long he just watched it, thoughtlessly, as though he was ready to wait until it arrived; that creature of the vast heavens. As though the thing that made the storm had called to him.
“If he hasn’t done anything with it yet, I doubt he was ever intending to,” Rowena said. “In fact it’s possible he did it on accident.”
“Okay,” he said. “So the rules of this place are different.” At least, Dean thought he said that. His mouth moved, he could feel the words in his throat, but when he spoke they disappeared into the complete soundlessness around him; that lack of anything that made him wonder if he even had a body at all.
he thought, goading them.
"Alastair…" Dean stood up. It didn't matter what he was feeling. What he thought about this Apocalypse plan. What he thought about starting it all. The buzz that went through him, liquid and bright, when he heard Alastair's words—it wiped all that out. He crowded Alastair at the cave opening, uncaring of the drop down to lava miles below. Kissed him, sharp with teeth; rolled his hips forward and let out an exhale when Alastair reached round his ass, pulling him closer, steering the wild, uncoordinated rut into something purposeful, dragging his fingers around the waistband of Dean's jeans. Dean sucked at Alastair's exposed skin, fumbling for the buttons on his mentor's shirt. He didn't know what he was feeling, but it was at the tips of his fingers, it was tracing its heated way down his body.
Dean had a whole month of free time on his hands, now, that he didn’t know what to do with. On earth, forty years ago, he’d have spent the time finding a good lay, conning folks out of their money, and looking for something to hunt. It sounded pretty pathetic when he thought about it; but there it was, the truth: he was a fucking workaholic. In Hell, that meant spending time with a few of his special projects. Like he’d let Bela lay one rotting claw on
It was okay.
He was coming to pieces. That was okay. Alastair had seen him broken. Alastair knew just where to push to make it happen. How to piece him back together after. Perhaps as something different than he had been before.
Dean turned around and slugged the Empty square in the face. Or he tried to. But where the Empty had been when he started swinging was just… well,
(See the end of the chapter for
“In that case, maybe I should ‘order some pizza.’” Dean said, suggestively.
"The Sword, actually," Alastair said. "The Sword of Michael. It was destined before you were even born. We've been waiting for the end for a long time. But…"

enough,” said Azazel. “Because apparently, I’m worrying for the both of us. The most important part of any scheme is insurance—and you don’t seem to have enough. So tell me, what exactly is your protocol if anyone gets wind of what we’re up to? Are you prepared to do what needs to be done?”
Days in the ghost forest passed slowly, like an itch.
The spell seemed to be taking hold. A form was coalescing out of darkness, pulling itself together like the Leviathan had, in purgatory. Something that looked like Cas if he’d been dipped in tar; eyes shining with a blue light, fingers dripping black goo.
Dean grabbed Cas’s arm, but it was already liquifying, no different from the darkness around it. “Cas, don’t you dare leave me again. You didn’t even give me time to answer…” he tugged, but there was nothing to hold onto, only black goo that ran over his palm before snapping away again.
“I haven’t been moved to another department?”
The mud was growing slipperier. Stagnant water was pooling over his boots. Dean trudged forward. The water moved up past his thighs.
“We really shouldn’t talk about this here. My office is right down the hall.”
“You don’t see it?” Cas asked. He frowned, closed his hand, and opened it again to see that the blood was all black and white, as it should have been all along.
"I've got it," Dean muttered. He wasn't a bad dancer. Not that he'd had a lotta time to practice, especially when he was alive; but Alastair had been as meticulous in teaching him this as anything else. It wasn't the steps itself that had been giving him trouble but something about the echoes, which seemed to aim right between his shoulderblades like a shiver, as though something were creeping up behind him.
“Ooh, aren’t you just the
“I got the idea from Gabriel,” Cas replies. “And I knew I could count on Dean to keep watching. I was able to pull this off with the help of Jake here.”
It would serve her right if Dean just—
“Anyone who finds out, who is loyal to Sandover,” said Uriel, “will be eliminated. You shouldn’t have to ask how far I’m willing to take this for the cause. You heard what happened to my husband, didn’t you?”

a moment later. Dean unbalanced and fell, and the Empty giggled again, slamming a foot into Cas’ stomach over and over as Dean heard the crack of bone. Dean watched, sickly, as the thing that looked like him took such utter glee in hurting his friend.
"I'm assuming you have a plan," Dean said.
Dean let go and stumbled back, eyes flying open into the dark, waking up in his chair in a cold sweat. The movie was long over, and the room was quiet, and echoing, and cold.
At Lover’s Lake, the view was serene. Birds chirped, cherry blossoms drifted through the air, covering the drive, as the tide turned gently.
The scrublands along the river were dry and empty. Every so often, a fleeing ghost would be buffeted past, as though being knocked about in a high wind, but the air was dry and still. There were no other demons to be seen. Dean trudged through the sandy ground beside Alastair. The virgin blood he'd had in the lower city was looking real good right about now; his mouth was parched. But he ignored it. He squinted through the monotonous twilight. Oh, look—a lizard! A scorpion! Ugh, more sand. A little fleshy-leafed plant, pressed close to the dirt like it wanted to stay out of sight. Rinse, repeat.
He moved slowly, heavy steps toward the prickle of salt, his feet sinking into ground that turned to muck.

“You didn’t think I’d make this
He grabbed Dean by the neck, pressed his face against the rough stone sill, hard enough it scraped blood. Dean went with the motion, letting himself be held. That far-away look wrenched from his eyes, his pupils expanding as his half-turned gaze met Alastair’s unyielding expression. His tongue wetting his lips just barely. That debauched cockslut. He might be promised to the angels but right now, right now he belonged to no one else. Alastair yanked the pants from around Dean’s hips, the boy helping with a shimmy, bracing his legs open. And Alastair spit on his hand, wet his cock and pushed in. Not soft. He could do soft, sometimes. Had taught Dean to respect that just as much as violence. But right now, no—he wanted hurt. The keen that his protege let out, melting into a strangled groan. The wet play of tears in his eyes. The open mouth, and the catch of lips on teeth; his hot, tight, shudder. Rock hard and bucking back against him. Nowhere else in the world, just here.

Not that he was in any danger of that.
“For…”
“I do like pepper flakes.”
“Yes!” Jack said, turning and motioning to the kitchen doorway, where Dean and Cas were peering out to spy on them. “These are my parents.” Jack and the other kid walked over. “Dad,” Jack said looking at Dean, “father,” he said, looking at Cas, “this is Belphagor.”
“Hi!” Jack said, holding his hand up in a wave.
"No, we're not—"
When Cas got to his desk he set down his giant stack of papers. Balthazar shot him a look that said ‘better you than me’ and grinned at him. “Promotion’s a bitch, I see,” he said.
“Wait, so then… you wouldn’t be able to feel any of this,” Dean said, with dawning realization. “Or, register it, at least…” He didn’t have to think twice. “Do it.”
“Maybe,” Anna said, grinning.
Bela dragged a hand through her matted hair and squinted at the pool of brightness that had been hovering like a lens-flare, burning ever wider. Her hands were shaking. Her mind crawling through its itinerary.
“You add all the spice you want,” Dean said.
Dean looked at him for a moment. “You want to dance?”
“The point is,” Cas says, “he was nice enough to help me get in touch with you.”
“Or maybe… they’re
“Not so much,” the ferryman said. He shook his head as though in wonderment. “Damndest thing I ever seen,” he repeated quietly, as though to himself.
He’d have to give up his position. Go on the run, and for what? For a soul barely past its baby steps, not even a demon yet. Why would he bother? If he did nothing, he could keep on no matter who won or lost. Same as always.
“Well,” Cas said, thoughtfully, “you are much older than him.”
Dean blinked up at him for a moment, confused. “Why? Did something happen?”
Dean stared blankly at her.
“You came,” she said.
“Which are?”
"It's okay kid," Dean said. "We're getting there."
Jack seemed to compose himself, stepping back out of Dean’s hold. He moved his hands across his wounds, which glowed gold and disappeared with a warm hum, reuniting both skin and fabric above it like nothing had happened. “I’m fine,” Jack said, reassuringly. He smiled.
Beyond the wall, the brightness in the sky was rising.
“Besties,” Belphagor said.
“Right where you left it.”

“Right,” said Cas. “So—my desk—”
In a lavish sitting room, the windowless walls covered in damask drapery perfumed with roses, polished silver chalices on every surface, and the mounted heads of her enemies staring down in empty-eyed beauty, sat the Queen of the Crossroads and the High Inquisitor. They sat across from each other on either side of a polished ebony coffee table inlaid with rubies and ivory.
“Good luck,” Rowena said, as he walked through, leaving the bunker behind.
Dean picked it up, confused, and dropped it into the empty fruit bowl on the coffee table. “Huh,” he said. “I don’t remember putting that there.” Things being where they shouldn’t was always a bad sign. Before he’d moved here it would’ve made him think there was a ghost at work, but somehow Dean knew that wasn’t a problem in Arcadia.
“I don’t want to go to work today,” Cas said at last.
Dean pulled back for a moment, curious. “Do you really?”
“What kind would you like to order?” Cas said, putting his arms around Dean’s waist.
are cool and star-shaped.
Alastair just smiled at him enigmatically, shaking his head. Dean had promised not to ask for the whole scoop until Alastair was ready to give it but just for a moment he wanted to shake him.
“Where are you going?” Jack asked, sitting down at the kitchen table.
Dean remembered this part: Cas was staring down at their feet as they moved further and then closer in time to the fast-paced song, and Dean just allowed himself to look. A small part of him felt awkward and overwhelmed; feelings he was usually so practiced at pushing aside hovering so close to the surface he felt like it was sparking along his skin, too obvious, too bright. But he just couldn’t bring himself to care… not now. And Cas, he had a slight smile on his face, like he was actually letting his hair down and having fun; so breathtakingly stunning that Dean felt something almost like pain, like he was missing this moment before it had even passed.
“So it
"I assume it started with the torture chambers to catch the scent and went from there," Alastair called from below. Dean glanced down at him—
doing this plot line.”
“What do you mean?”
"So you figure the seraph won't look for us in the place no sane demon would hang out," Dean said. "Are we supposed to just—stay here?" As hiding spots went, it was worse than the cave. There, at least, Dean didn't constantly feel like he was gonna be turned into a fucking statue. He almost hoped the angel caught up with them soon so they'd have to move again. As for that—"you can't think it'll just give up. It'll catch us eventually, the moment we slip up. And we will."
behind him. As he did so, Lilith leaned forward, a spark of glee in her eyes.
“He didn’t—he
“My lady is too kind,” Alastair said with some sarcasm. Lilith just grinned at him before taking the baby in her hands.
Dean laughed, patting Cas on the back. “You’ll be fine. We’ll figure it out.”
. Inside. You know who does that? Douchebags.”
Half the time, in dreaming, Alastair was in front of him chained to the rack. Dean made cut after cut and leaned in close enough to feel Alastair's breath in his mouth. He wanted to hurt the bastard. He wanted to feel the quiver of unwilling flesh. He wanted to see the salt-track of tears and hear screams. He wanted Alastair to bend his head and admit that Dean had bested him; that the protege had outstripped his teacher at last.
Meg laughed, whooping into the air, the heady taste of power filling her mouth, her pendant swinging on her breast. Her dark eyes flashed and glittered as she craned her neck back toward the endless pit, where a nuclear glow had been rising for weeks. "I'll get the bastard," she promised Hell's army. "I'll make sure everything goes right.
Yeah. He knew of many ways to die, quick and slow, humiliating and peaceful, pointless and fucking
“Yeah well,” Dean said, “
"I changed my mind," Alastair said. "Because of you." He shook his head. "It's all come down to you, Dean. You were the first seal on the cage, the domino to set the whole chain of events rolling. You're prophesied." He fell silent for a moment, and when he spoke again his voice was softer, almost reverent. "'And it is written that the first seal shall be broken when a righteous man sheds blood in Hell. As he breaks, so shall it break.' It was over," he said, "the moment you picked up my razor and sliced into that weeping bitch. After that it was just a matter of waiting for the incursion."
“So, what I’m hearing is,” Sam said, smirking at Dean, “Cas imprinted on you?”
"It's not coming for you, kid," Dean said.
“Fine,” Dean said. “I won’t ask again. Not till you’re ready to tell me.” Dean paused, meaningfully, in case Alastair felt overcome with the need to tell him then and there.
“These are stressful,” said Cas, flatly, putting down another contract. “I’m going to take a break.” He got up. “I’ll just be a minute.”
Finally he stopped.
“But it’s true,” Cas said, sensing further opportunity to tease his husband. “I’m older than your great-grandfather, I’m older than the
The deadfall was right where he'd left it; the suicide tree sapling had its black leaves opened toward the light, and its veins and its stem glowed like fire.
“I get it,” Dean said—or imagined that he said. “There’s no external world here, right? It’s all about your mind.” He closed his eyes and kept walking. He stopped looking back at the portal, instead, he reached for Cas. He didn’t know
“I’ll cover for you if Uriel comes back,” Balthazar said.
“Yes, I see,” Cas said, with a tone of deep concentration. So they danced, Dean doing a few swing steps he’d picked up over the years and just letting Cas follow along however he felt like, until he noticed that Cas had gotten the pattern.
• the song Dean & Alastair sing is
“What?”
"But?" Dean said.
by Ryunosuke Akutagawa
“Dean,” said Cas.
He made his way to the edge of the crowd. “Hey, Cas,” he said. “How you doing?”
“No sir,” Dean whispered. His hands clenching and unclenching, the movement rippling up his ams, his shoulders. Alastair chuckled.
“Did you contact our backup?” Rowena asked.
“What’s not making sense, mate?” said Balthazar, sorting files on his desk. “Besides our very existence?”
“Well don’t get
“What,” said Dean. “What did you do?”
“Oh! I’ll get it!” Jack said, hopping out of his seat. He was wearing his usual white over-large t-shirt with a few stripes across the middle. He hurried into the other room and opened the door, smiling at a guest who looked exactly like him. Except this version had a blue jacket with white stripes up the side and a pair of black dudebro sunglasses.
As far as inhospitality went, this took the cake.
my soul? What for?”
Belphagor shot them a peace-sign.
"Not much longer now," Alastair said, and Dean nodded. Concentrating on one foot in front of the other. There was a burn in every limb, the piercing agony of moving past what he could stand that he hadn't felt since the rack. How many days had it been since they up and left Alastair's penthouse? Going on a week now? And not a moment's rest or sleep. Not that they needed it, technically, but hell if Dean didn't daydream about Alastair's clean, pressed sheets and memory foam pillows. At least the pain and tiredness made it hard to think, harder to worry. Everything clean, bright. Not quite as good as cutting into someone else but getting there. One foot after another. Sand making his eyes gritty. He had blisters on his feet that had long since popped and leaked into his socks. It didn't matter.
Belphagor was just leaving when Cas returned. Cas waved at him cheerily as they passed on the driveway. Belphagor shot him that cross-between a gang sign and a salute. Despite the sunglasses, Cas had a distinct feeling Belphagor was giving his trenchcoat the evil eye.
Dean looked around, amazed. This bunch had seemed like such a dour group, but there was something in the euphoria of having saved the day that was carrying everyone along. He didn’t know how he’d ended up next to the dancing or why he felt the urge to join in the crowd; he looked around, noticing that there were only strangers there; Sam and Jack and Mary off somewhere else. Nobody knew him here, or cared, so he stepped onto the dance floor, took a turn with a woman he’d never seen before; and in the moment between that song and the next, as he stepped back to change partners, he saw Cas standing at the edge of the room, watching the crowd with an odd, wistful expression.
It was ridiculous how much heights still made his heart pound; that vertigo fucking with his brain, he'd been on and off the racks for forty years in the endless well and he still had to psych himself up for a moment, wiping his palms on the sides of his jeans. Okay, okay, he could do this. He had to, anyway, whether he could or not. That decided him. He started down after Alastair.
“True,” Dean allowed. “So… she found something?”
“I—I really miss Cas, man, and that one dude really looks like him. Spitting image.”
“Yeah?”
Jack screamed in pain as a sharp cut appeared across his face, red with blood.
“Oh,” Cas said. He stared down at their joined hands and Dean followed his gaze, suddenly feeling self-conscious. He glanced around, worried that people would be watching them, judging—but no one was paying them any mind.
“Uncomfortable family dinners,” Cas agreed.
Anna looked at him as though this was not the response she had in mind, but continued on anyway. “So, what are you planning to do with this, Cas?”
“So hot,” Cas replied, taking off Dean’s shirt. “Steamy, even.”
Dean stepped down the first crumbling stone step, hand gliding against the side to steady himself in his descent. Alastair stayed behind for a bare moment, casting his eye over the life he’d built for himself. Well, the trappings of it. He’d never felt at home anywhere but the racks, and they weren’t visible from here.
“What?” said Dean, almost dropping the casserole pan he was holding.
The thought of it was a fire in her heart. Reminded her to keep going. On dawnless mornings when she woke shivering in her bed and didn't want to move. On dark evenings when she almost considered making a misstep in a fight and letting her blood soak the ground.
Signing contracts was so tedious, Cas thought. What were these contracts for? Why was he signing them? He didn’t even know what they said, too much fine print to take in at a glance.
“This door won’t stay open very long, so you’ve got to go in and bring him back as fast as you can,” Rowena said.
“What is this?” Cas said, showing Balthazar his hand, with the red blood on it. Balthazar looked at his palm. From his point of view, the shot was simple and ordinary: everything ubiquitously black and white.
THE HIGHEST WISDOM, AND THE PRIMAL LOVE.
“No, you’ve just got to wait a minute… Sam?”
“No, no,” Alastair said. “I’ll leave the details to you.” His pale eyes glittered, staring at Dean, but he said and did nothing more. So, with a shrug, Dean turned back to work.
Cas kissed his neck and whispered, “if you don’t mind, I might add some spice to that pizza.”
Dean held his cup in his hands, staring into it. “What,” he asked.
Dean couldn't help but look at it. The idea he'd had when they'd arrived, that perhaps the sky had been ripped open, wouldn't leave him; but however long he stared, he could never quite find the tear. But torn it had been, he was sure of it. It only stayed above, dour and mute, its secrets its own. Dean sank into the deep place in his mind.
"You can move," the tree said. "You can fight. I can only watch, and reach toward an empty sky. When I killed myself I wished for nonexistence, but now I have nothing but time. I thought I was alone." The tree reached toward him again, tremblingly. Touching him with their deep leaves as though he would disappear. The rustle of their branches was quiet, but in the dead place, it felt like a song.
“Fight me, you son of a bitch,” Dean shouted, but the Empty didn’t even seem to hear him anymore, and when he tried to catch hold of it, somehow he missed each time, as though it was always a little bit off from where he’d been aiming.
After they played a few rounds, Jack and Belphegor made their way downstairs, Belphagor holding a VHS. He and Jack went into the living room where Dean and Cas were sitting on the rug, and turned on the TV. Belphagor slid the tape into the player, and he and Jack settled down on the couch to enjoy what revealed itself to be a horror movie called
“The second your angel’s returned, the Empty will no doubt come into the world in order to drag him back,” Rowena said. “The Empty’s supposed stay where it belongs, and we figure the earth is God’s domain.”
Lilith furrowed her brow. “Sometimes sacrifices have to be made, Ali, in order to bring about a more perfect kingdom.”
“No,” Anna agreed. “In fact, they might even enlist their own phone line spies. It seems the CEO at Labefaction is getting into politics, and you know what that means.”
"Yes it is," the suicide tree insisted. "You should have seen it. I woke up and I was alone, but now the burning one is here."
And now they were back, all the ordinary sounds; cars going by and the hum of machinery and the heavy thrum of a city, a country, a whole world with individuals walking down their streets like eight billion lighters in an endless void. And sprawled out on the ground, shocked, confused, staring back at him: Cas. Cas, bereft, stony, betrayed; still as gorgeous as he had looked when they first met, when he’d stepped over that salt line in the barn, like it was nothing, like he hadn’t turned the entire world over on its axis, shook the magnetic poles out of whack, changed Dean forever.
“What is it now?” Castiel asked before looking back down to the sink, turning the faucet to stop the water from flowing. He dried his hands on a towel before turning to where Jimmy should have been standing.
“Right… I’m just saying, you don’t look very happy about what he’s spurting out.”
He wasn’t too fond at computers, didn’t help that he wasn’t too good at them either, it was always Sam’s forte. Dean swore the kid could bring up thirty pages of information faster than he could even conjure up a thought. He typed away regardless and searched for any deaths that may have occurred
Dean yawned, straining to keep his eyes opened as he looked over the news articles and print outs, he had already spread out onto one of the motel room’s walls.  He had gone over some of the weird murders that had happened in town before these recent ones, but he’d been coming up blank despite all the information the Pastor had given him. He decided to push that aside for now and investigate the connections between the victims. He flipped through a few of the articles where it had some information about the victims, it only said what the Pastor had told him. They all went to church. He paused his swirling storm of thoughts for a moment, that could definitely be a lead. He then decides that going down to the local library might be a good idea. Digging up deaths or even murders that had anything to do with the church or religion could help his investigation.
“Castiel, you’re home. Oh, good. I have dinner cooking as we speak.” Castiel sniffed the air, nose wrinkling at the bland and all too familiar smell. He very much disliked these ‘dietary laws’ and the food that came along with it, but he knew better than to question or speak up on any of his parent’s decisions. Even as a kid he was never fond of the food, but he never argued. And even though he knew it was wrong, he would much rather a juicy cheeseburger instead. Even those crappy ones from the equally as crappy restaurant down the street made his stomach growl in a way that no lamb stew -if you could even call that rubbery, flavourless substance that - could calm.
“Welcome, father. I haven’t seen you around these parts before, what brings you to this little neck of the woods?” Dean gives the older man a friendly smile, coming up with one of his bullshit excuses on the spot. “Oh, you know, the lord works in mysterious ways.” He looked up to the tall ceiling of the church, before back down at the Pastor who looked like he understood what he was saying.
“Okay…” He paused for a moment and Dean assumed he was going over his options. “How does noon sound? And we could meet up at the local diner, it’s hard to miss.”
“Hey Sammy, check this out.” Dean said, shoving the newspaper under his brother’s nose. Sam glared at him before taking the paper and running his eyes over the words. Three deaths had occurred a few towns over, all of them mysterious. “According to that, they all died in rooms that locked from the inside in the exact same way, sounds pretty suspicious right?”
“Come on Castiel, why the hell do you have to go to church for the small amount of time you have free? I mean, shit, you could be out there, having fun, making friends.” Said a voice like his but more chipper and filled with personality. Castiel’s eyes widened at the use of language and scolded the other man.
“I assume you’ve heard of the murders that have been happening in this town recently?” Dean saw the opportunity and wasn’t going to let it pass him by. “Yeah, I have, tragic. You know, now that you mention it, I actually have some questions about that… if you don’t mind?” The Pastor gave a quick nod and motioned for Dean to take a seat on the pew, placing himself beside him. “What is it you’d like to know? I’ll try to answer what I can.”
“Ah, it’s nothing, you probably wouldn’t believe it anyway. I’m not sure that I do.” The hunter looked at him, “Try me.”
daydreaming about what kind of baked goods the diner had. Nope. Not at all, he was focused.
Running a hand down his face, Dean took a few steps toward the motel bed, flopping unceremoniously down onto it. He made a minimal effort to strip out of his clothes, becoming tangled in them a few times, groaning in annoyance. Once he had finally escaped the cloth prison and he was down to his boxers, he closed his eyes. It wasn’t that hard, it had gotten to the point where it hurt to keep them open. His breathing regulated as he quickly felt himself drift off into the world of the unconscious.
Castiel watched the young man leave, curiosity tugging at his mind. He’d never seen him before. He must have been new. It was a small town, and everybody was at least aware of who lived next door. He blinked a few times when he realised that the man was out of sight. How long was he staring out there for? He couldn’t help it, there was something about him that just grabbed his attention. Shaking his head, he went over to the Pastor. When he caught sight of Castiel, the saddened look on his face was replaced with a warm and inviting smile.
The hunter was suddenly awake as he answers, “Yeah, that’s right. I’m glad you made use of the number I gave you.”
“It’s Sam.” His brother rolls his eyes, “So, you think it’s our kind of thing?” Sam asked, picking at his salad, Dean making a disgusted noise in the process. “No, Sam. It’s my kind of thing.” Dean stood, picking his leather jacket from the flat motel bed he’d dropped it on earlier, sliding it over his shoulders. “It looks like it’s probably just a simple salt and burn, not really a two-man job, right? So, I’ll go, and you can do… I don’t know whatever nerdy shit you do when I’m not around.” Sam’s head whips around as the sounds of the keys ring through the motel room, the object dangling from the elder Winchester’s hands as he lifts them from the table beside him. He shoves them into his pocket, raising a brow at the look on his little brother’s face.
“Right… hey, do you mind if I ask you some questions? Because I was curious about the recent deaths in this town and I was wondering if-”
“See ya in a few days, Sammy.”
“What do you mean? I didn’t think it was bad to begin with.”
The older man let out a defeated hum at Dean’s silence. “Like I said, it’s nothing that any normal person would believe.” Dean gave a small nod of his own, keeping a mental note of all the things the older man was saying while trying to appear as sympathetic as he possibly could. “I know this must be difficult to talk about, especially to someone you’ve never even met but do you think you could tell me more about the victims? Connections, what they did, things like that? Oh, and if you know about any deaths that occurred before all of these recent ones, one’s that would be considered ‘weird’, I’d really appreciate hearing about them.” The Pastor gave Dean another questioning look but agreed to talk some more anyway which Dean was thankful for.
“Fine, I’ll ‘let it go.” He spat out, making air quotations with his fingers. And then he did as he was told, the rest of the night went on smoothly without another word from Jimmy, the family eating their dinner with minimal conversation as usual.
“Ah, Castiel. Good to see you son, what brings you in today?”
“You know, you don’t have to do what they want, right?” Castiel jumped in his seat as he heard the voice beside him, almost spitting the beverage from his mouth. Both his mother and father gave him weird looks, but Castiel gave them what he hoped was a reassuring smile and they turned back to their food.

"Possibly," Meg said. "I like to think of it as visionary, but each to her own." She snapped her fingers, and Nanghait bowed his head, letting Meg onto his back. She held onto his neck and pressed her knees in as the curling storm of feathers widened, taking the shape of wings, flickering dark and vast as void. With a beat of his wings and a jump of his hindlimbs, Nanghait had taken to the air, slipping through the walls like a shadow and spinning to dizzying heights above the star-shaped bastion fortress of Dis' upper city. He swooped through the sideways spires, darting through sky that felt like a rushing current around her.
by InHisImage (Dean & Alastair, but gen) a hell-fic describing an ordinary day of torture and perfectly manages to capture a messed-up, fascinating dynamic. I have not, sadly, managed to write a portrayal of Alastair half as brilliant as any of these.
Dean cracked an eye open skeptically. “What?”
But today, for the first time, words were beginning to pop up on the edge of the page. Cas looked down, and noticed that a few words were quite clear to him, in fact they seemed to take up more space than they really should. “True happiness,” it said. Cas looked at the sheet quizzically, for a moment, signed his name at the bottom , and placed it to the side. He grabbed the next paper, another phrase dripping out from a sea of illegible text. “Shall forthwith be detained for eternity.”
Alastair circled the open edge of the cave, drawing blood sigils on the wall and floor. Stuff to hide them from sight, Dean thought—powerful stuff. He'd never seen it before. Only when he'd finished did Alastair sit down across from him, a pensive expression on his face. Then, with a sigh, he said, "The angels aren't coming for me."
Dean was not. He traveled. It didn't matter that the ghost forest was uncanny, it was better than sitting like a rat in a trap, with nothing to do but think.
“Maybe… five minutes?”
“Don’t judge us,
When Cas arrived at work, he hurried through the endless white rooms toward his desk, hoping to get there before anyone noticed his tardiness. Unfortunately, someone stepped out of a room right into his path.
“Just keep it open as long as you can,” Dean said.
So without really thinking they moved back to the Impala and Cas slid into the front seat, eyes never leaving Dean, and Dean bit his lip. So many things to say. So many things he’d never had the courage to do, that graceful creature he’d been so afraid of shattering, like if he laid him down on those seats and touched him he’d break, never be able to stop.
Rowena sighed. “Powerful beings can place claims on human souls, creating a bond. At first, it probably would have left a physical brand,” she continued. “A powerful witch like myself can sense magic that strong.”
because as many times as you died a hero it never changed a thing; but this? Something about this was different. Chuck, that poor bastard, didn't get it. He could make them his puppets. He could force them to do whatever he wanted to fulfill his sick storyline. But the meaning?
“These papers,” Cas said, gesturing to them. “Why do I sign these papers every day?” he asked as he began to straighten them.
*got kicked out of our motel room cause Dean’s watching porn of his dead boyfriend.*
Dean was at home, vacuuming the living room, humming
“So Gabriel really likes candy, and so do I. And you guys have a kid, which means you’re going trick-or-treating. So you can bring us along, right?”
"Can't do that. Look, we're almost there."
—before he'd managed to catch himself and had to pause a moment, taking deep breaths. It was a long drop. Alastair kept speaking. "It'd have to be pretty damn persistent but evidently, it is. Seraphs are just serpents with wings; if any angel would be able to find us so quickly, it would be one of them."
; and somehow all the breath had been sucked from his lungs into racking sobs.
“…I’m pregnant.”
Cas gave him a look. “Dean,” he said. “That is our son’s best friend you’re talking about.”
He could feel his mentor walking behind him, the press of his shoes on the stone. Every so often, when Dean didn’t move fast enough, they would be close enough that the heat of him warmed Dean’s back, and they could almost touch. He focused on it—that careful distance between them. Keeping up a constant pace. It was a little game he could play to spur himself on. If he stopped, he’d just lean back into Alastair and not let go, and then Alastair probably
“Cas!”
"Yours. Your instrument, your toy, your protege, all yours. It doesn't matter it doesn't matter what you do it doesn't matter—"
Dean tried to grasp the edges of the memory, put it into some kind of order, but that's all it was. Sammy. Fuck, he hadn't thought about that kid for years. Something about that image of him, pudgy-cheeked, curly-haired, it hurt deep. He'd thought he was over this.
“Dean, the toilet is broken!!!” Sam shouted, bursting into the room.
Dean smiled, completely forgetting he’d been annoyed at Cas earlier. As Cas left the house, Dean hoped he wouldn’t get into too much trouble, if Uriel really was doing something shady. As this thought crossed his mind, it was punctuated by ominous music from the other room, and a chorus of croaking frogs.
The blob of brightness, which had been a reflective bowl almost a moment ago, had differentiated into a mass of crawling shapes streaking through the chain-linked sky. She made out numerous four-headed creatures in the heavenly army: lion, ox, eagle, and human faces; a mass of feathers in brown and gold, legs of a calf with hooved feet gleaming like polished brass. Below the high shriek of noise was a beat that pounded through her chest like waves, the beat of the army's wings. Blood was streaked across the nails of their human hands, and with every wingbeat, a light mist of blood fell onto Bela's shoulders and her upturned face. Like discs, behind them, were the kind of concentric circles Bela associated with optical illusions, as they seemed to be moving both inward and outward, forward and back, but always round and round, glowing a gold so bright she could barely look at them. They swooped above the rest of the army like UFOs, gazing to every side with an uncanny number of eyes; whenever a bat-winged demon came close enough to attack one they would be unceremoniously sliced in half by the spinning blades, their bodies falling through the clear green air. Even from where she stood, Bela could tell that, despite the dark swarm of demons filling the air with smoke and teeth, the armies of Heaven were wiping the floor with them. She gazed at the clash slack-jawed, her torturing forgotten; she couldn't move. If she moved, she knew, they would be on her. She would be sucked into the noise and the light and would never find herself again.
“I am,” Castiel said, confused.
"I'm not sure I'd say that," Dean said. Whoever this poor bastard had been in life, by killing themself they'd bypassed the rack. No endless torture, no turning into a demon. Just an endless underworld existence as a tree.
Why had he climbed up. It was so much harder to try to get back down in a hurry.
"I'm serious," Alastair said. "They mean to raise you. Cleanse your soul of the demonic taint—it's still possible, you know, you're not quite one of us yet—" Dean frowned and opened his mouth to interrupt, but Alastair waved him quiet. "Then the Archangel Michael will possess you and fight Lucifer in the Apocalypse."
a post-hell, canon-compliant fic by jaimeykay, mariahlee, and Smilla, where Dean doesn't know that the woman he's hooking up with is actually possessed by Alastair. It's creepy, eerie, weird, and features a really interesting look at Dean's character. (2)
“Nothing,” Cas said softly, stepping forward. He placed a gentle hand on Dean’s cheek, staring into that breathtaking green. “You’re beautiful.”
Alastair shrugged. "The promise of better times ahead. Paradise for demons. Everything we'd ever want. But everything I'd ever want is already here. I can only lose." He turned back to Dean, and the look in his pale eyes burned like magnesium fire. "I won't lose you, Dean. You're my greatest creation."
, where did they—?”
,” giving them a
“Five minutes. Are you kidding?”
Dean, Alastair thought with an ironic twist to his lips, was very fond of the give-them-hope-and-snatch-it-away approach. He’d gotten his first big break through the slow psychological undoing of a soul, giving it a hellhound as a pet, letting it gather meager scraps of comfort from the puppy before he killed the bitch in front of it. As a wet-off-the-rack newbie, his unique approach had earned him whispers of respect that catapulted him to notoriety in record time. And he kept at it. Always trying something new and inventive, when others would stick to the tried-and-true, too scared of not getting results to really play around. This wasn’t his finest work, but it still had the flair Alastair had come to associate with the infamous Dean Winchester.
“Of course,” Cas said. “What is it, Anna?” He went to stand beside her, leaning on the rail too. They stared out onto the green grass.
Sam… found something deeply disturbing about that dog. It had seemed all right when they first found her. But he had begun to be suspicious when it turned up a week later at their door, still as neat and clean and well-fed as ever, still without a collar. How had it even found the bunker.
“Jimmy?” He said in a hushed tone before deciding to just drop it. Leave it to Jimmy to be creepy for literally no reason at all. “Seriously?”
“You need to stop saying such things, Jimmy. It’s false. I was looking at that man no way other than friendly and for a suitable amount of time, you know that things like that is forbidden so- “
“Hey there.” Dean offered one of his hands to the other man.
“No, no, you’re fine. I had to get up anyway. So, what can I do for you?”
“Mother?” He called out, loud enough that she could hear but not too loud to avoid bothering his father. He heard her respond from the kitchen.
“Jimmy, I am trying to enjoy my meal.” He hissed at the other man, trying to be as quiet as possible. Jimmy looked at his plate before meeting his eyes.
“I guess the trip wasn’t all bad though, right?”
Saying that Castiel’s family was religious was an understatement… The family was made to pray every night and say grace before all meals otherwise they would not be allowed to eat. When Castiel was younger, he had defied saying grace and went to bed with an empty stomach. Castiel now said it even when he was getting lunch at school, quietly to himself, it was just a habit that he kind of hated. He never said it aloud though, he didn’t want to think about the hell that would break loose.
“Thank you, I hope I get to speak with you soon.” Dean dipped his head, dismissing himself before his legs guided him out of the church. With every step he could feel those piercing eyes on him even as he grew further away
“Hello?” At first there was no response so he thinks that maybe they misdialled, it wouldn’t be the first time that had happened, but then he hears a familiar voice on the other end of the line.
“Hello there, this is Father Winchester, correct?”
“Just let it go, okay? Like Father said, they want what’s best for me and that’s all that matters. My only duty is to be a good son to them.” The other’s face seemed to drop, and Castiel could feel the disappointment radiating from him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dinner is silent at first, just the sounds of cutlery clanking against each other. Castiel isn’t sure if he likes it or not. Sometimes silence can be louder than a siren. The silence is soon interrupted by his father clearing his throat.
He finally broke eye contact before stepping up to the guy, a friendly smile creeping its way onto his face.
“Yes, they were regulars, they came as often as they could to show their faith. They were good souls. God knows they didn’t deserve what happened to them.”
the first mysterious death was reported. For a while he struggled to find anything that stuck out in the slightest, just a few car minor car accidents here and completely normal heart attacks there, there was nothing that really screamed, ‘I died a horrific death and came back as a bat-crap crazy ghost!’ The hunter checks over his shoulder every so often as he clicked different links, paranoid that someone would just be there, looking over his shoulder and see what he was doing. It wouldn’t do him any good for the people of the town to think the newcomer was some creepy weirdo who started researching weird deaths on his second day there…
“Castiel! Come down for dinner!” His father’s voice boomed from downstairs, making goosebumps form on the young man’s.
Once outside, Dean slid himself into the driver’s side of his Baby. He let out a breath of air, his hands digging through his extensive collection of cassette tapes, pulling out his favourite Zeppelin one and putting it into the player. He rested his hand on the wheel as the tune to ‘Ramble On’ starts up, looking to the road with a slight up-turn to his lips. “Been a while since I played dress up.”
“Castiel.” The young man stiffened at the deep sound of his father’s voice behind him. He turned around to look up at him, being seemingly towered by the older man. “Father.” He said in response, the other just nodded and went in the direction of the dining room. Castiel let out a breath he hadn’t known he was holding and decided to head upstairs to his room while dinner was being prepared.
“Right, I’ll meet up with you in a few days. Call me if you need anything or if something important comes up. And hey, maybe try to get laid, you’ve been a little tense lately.” Sam throws him one of his bitch-faces as Dean opens the motel room door, so he gives him a grin in return, one foot already outside.
“Oh, that’s awesome. Look, I have to do something this morning so anytime after that I’m free if that works for you.”
“What, really? Vulgar? If you think that’s vulgar then buddy I have some fuc-“
They were in there for a while, Castiel dancing around the topic of what is truly bothering him. The Pastor didn’t press on it though which he was thankful for. He thanked the man before stepping out of the booth.
“I know you don’t hate what you’re doing now, but you don’t love it.”
“Fuck, I know that. I just meant—you seemed so into picturing it. Anyway, I’ll be sure to toast to you when I down a pint.”
"You're mad."
So, a little late, lol... but we're here with the next chapter!
"That's actually a pretty good plan," Dean said. He edged his way down the last few feet toward the cave entrance.
. Your Nephilim causes trouble. Your angel causes trouble. Your
“And it looks like you’ve just confessed to being an accessory to the crime.”
. Still standing.
“Fine.” The footsteps trailed away. Cas was a bit concerned. He left the closet and sneaked down the hall. “What is he up too?” he muttered. Cas kneeled down and looked through the keyhole of Uriel’s office. Inside, Uriel was offering a drink to a man with eyes that shone disturbingly yellow in the sunlight.
"Come on, take me, use me up like this I'm yours. Alastair, please—"
Once Dean got bored enough that even the threat of salt didn't stop him from moving, he'd started picking his way through the bare trees, trying to learn the lay of the land around their hiding spot. Their hiding spot was created from stripped trees he and Alastair had tamped down into the earth side by side, logs with sharpened tips, creating a circular palisade. On the ground inside, and on the dead wood, Alastair had drawn more sigils to keep them from the angel and aid their next escape. Alastair was patient.
BEFORE ME NOTHING BUT ETERNAL THINGS
“Perhaps a stand-up fellow… with potential,” Uriel mused, as he walked away.
Cas reminded himself that people were allowed their own opinions about fashion. Even really stupid ones, like Belphagor’s.
“Dean,” Sam said, quietly.
It was at that moment that the phone rang. Dean hurried over and lifted the receiver.
“I don’t think there’s anyone at Sandover I could bring it up to,” Cas said; “Uriel’s in such a high position.” He thought for a moment. “What we need is more information about this breakthrough.”
“Oh,” Dean said. “Huh. Maybe we should go out on a case then.”
“I know,” Dean said, opening the front door. Cas smiled, pecking Dean on the cheek before slipping outside. The door swung closed behind him, shutting with a click. Dean turned to survey the living room. “Well,” he said, “guess it’s just me then.”
The other person answered, “that’s all well and good, but we need a report: how’s it going.”
The flash of hurt in Dean’s eyes was quickly hidden. He flopped back down, grimacing, and closed his eyes. “Whatever. See you then.”
“He’s a teenager, man. Can’t he put himself to sleep?” Dean asked.
"We're not going down that," he said, as Alastair began to pick his way down the side. That thing was way too tall. You could fall down and get roasted to death. Of course Alastair didn't care. Didn't even bother to answer him and so, after a moment, Dean dragged himself closer to the edge.
A good memory.
“What is that supposed to mean,” he muttered.
Cas looked down at his desk and continued straightening his papers. “That’s because we spend most of our time talking to each other.”
"I can do that," Dean breathed. He stepped backward, slowly. Found his balance on the metal ground and reached for the collar of his shirt. Unbuttoned it slowly, staring at Alastair all the while. He swayed, as though the music was still playing; got the shirt over his head.
Cas went home.
In a few minutes, Sam and Rowena had finished setting up the spell, and Dean, who had gone to his room, reentered with a machete in one hand and a flamethrower in the other. “I’m ready to fight anything,” he said.
Cas squinted at him. “Why don’t you just buy candy, they’ll have discounts.”
“I looked into what you asked. You were right. Uriel’s definitely up to something, but I can’t tell what,” Anna said. “They keep speaking in code. All I can get is mentions of something called ‘the breakthrough’, an initiative he seems to be backing with the Essential Venue for Integrated Labefaction. And, as far as I can tell, that company’s one of Sandover’s biggest competitors on the market.”
Dean stared forward, a wave of hopelessness crashing over him.
“How did you do that?” Dean asked.
Dean held out his hands in surrender. “I wasn’t trying to steal your fucking fingers, come on!”
